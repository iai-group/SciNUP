II Abstract: Previous work by the authors (this journal, \\vol{60} (2008), 1009-1044)\nproduced equations that hold on certain loci of the Jacobian of a cyclic\n$C_{rs}$ curve. A curve of this type generalizes elliptic curves, and the\nequations in question are given in terms of (Klein's) generalization of\nWeierstrass' $\\sigma$-function. The key tool is a matrix with entries that are\npolynomial in the coordinates of the affine plane model of the curve, thus can\nbe expressed in terms of $\\sigma$ and its derivatives. The key geometric loci\non the Jacobian of the curve give a stratification of Brill-Noether type. The\nresults are of the type of Riemann-Kempf singularity theorem, the methods are\ngermane to those used by J.D. Fay, who gave vanishing tables for Riemann's\n$\\theta$-function and its derivatives.

The main concern is\nwhether their restriction to the real locus reflects all the richness of the\ncomplex dynamics. This question is declined in two directions: the topological\nentropy and the Fatou set.\n  For the first one, we introduce a purely geometric quantity depending only on\nthe surface, and we call it concordance. Then we show that the ratio of real\nand complex entropies is linked to this quantity. The concordance is\nexplicitely computed for many examples of surfaces, especially abelian surfaces\nwhich are broadly studied, as well as some K3 surfaces.\n  In the second part, we are interested in the Fatou set, which corresponds to\ncomplex points for which the dynamics is simple. Thanks to previous results of\nDinh and Sibony about closed positive currents, we prove that this set is\nhyperbolic in the sense of Kobayashi, after possibly deleting some curves which\nare fixed by (an iterate of) our transformation. From this property we deduce\nthat, except for some exceptional cases in which the topology of the real locus\nis simple and the dynamics well understood, this real locus cannot be entirely\ncontained in the Fatou set.

At low energies some of them flow to non-linear sigma\nmodels with Calabi-Yau target spaces, which emerge from non-Abelian strong\ncoupling dynamics. The observed phase structure results in a non-trivial\nduality proposal among skew symplectic sigma models and connects non-complete\nintersection Calabi-Yau threefolds, that are non-birational among another, in a\ncommon quantum Kahler moduli space. As a consequence we find non-trivial\nidentifications of spectra of topological B-branes, which from a modern\nalgebraic geometry perspective imply derived equivalences among Calabi-Yau\nvarieties. To further support our proposals, we calculate the two sphere\npartition function of skew symplectic sigma models to determine geometric\ninvariants, which confirm the anticipated Calabi-Yau threefold phases. We show\nthat the two sphere partition functions of a pair of dual skew symplectic sigma\nmodels agree in a non-trivial fashion.

Existing methods for this problem make too restrictive assumptions\nand thus cannot model practical scenarios. The goal of this paper is to\nconsider the team formation problem in a realistic setting and present a novel\nformulation based on densest subgraphs. Our formulation allows modeling of many\nnatural requirements such as (i) inclusion of a designated team leader and/or a\ngroup of given experts, (ii) restriction of the size or more generally cost of\nthe team (iii) enforcing locality of the team, e.g., in a geographical sense or\nsocial sense, etc.\n  The proposed formulation leads to a generalized version of the classical\ndensest subgraph problem with cardinality constraints (DSP), which is an NP\nhard problem and has many applications in social network analysis.

For applications such as predicting users' political preference,\nit is particularly important to be able to analyze the dynamics of competing\nopinions. While observing the evolution of polar opinions of a social network's\nusers over time, can we tell when the network \"behaved\" abnormally?\nFurthermore, can we predict how the opinions of the users will change in the\nfuture? Do opinions evolve according to existing network opinion dynamics\nmodels? To answer such questions, it is not sufficient to study individual user\nbehavior, since opinions can spread far beyond users' egonets. We need a method\nto analyze opinion dynamics of all network users simultaneously and capture the\neffect of individuals' behavior on the global evolution pattern of the social\nnetwork.\n  In this work, we introduce Social Network Distance (SND) - a distance measure\nthat quantifies the \"cost\" of evolution of one snapshot of a social network\ninto another snapshot under various models of polar opinion propagation. SND\nhas a rich semantics of a transportation problem, yet, is computable in time\nlinear in the number of users, which makes SND applicable to the analysis of\nlarge-scale online social networks.

These form a wide class of potentially realistic\nfour-dimensional vacua of string theory. Despite all their phenomenological\npromise, there is little understanding of the metric on the moduli space of\nthese. What is sought is the analogue of special geometry for these vacua. The\nmetric on the moduli space is important in phenomenology as it normalises\nD-terms and Yukawa couplings. It is also of interest in mathematics, since it\ngeneralises the metric, first found by Kobayashi, on the space of gauge field\nconnections, to a more general context. Here we construct this metric, correct\nto first order in alpha', in two ways: first by postulating a metric that is\ninvariant under background gauge transformations of the gauge field, and also\nby dimensionally reducing heterotic supergravity. These methods agree and the\nresulting metric is Kahler, as is required by supersymmetry. Checking that the\nmetric is in fact Kahler is quite intricate and uses the anomaly cancellation\nequation for the H-field, in an essential way.

This paper addresses the problem of\nconstructing MDS vector codes which enable exact reconstruction of each code\nblock by downloading small amount of information from the remaining code\nblocks. The repair bandwidth of a code measures the information flow from the\nremaining code blocks during the reconstruction of a single code block.

In many large-scale applications, the\nconstruction of the index and its usage need to be considered as one unit of\ncomputation. Efficient string indexing and analysis in small space lies also at\nthe core of a number of primitives in the data-intensive field of\nhigh-throughput DNA sequencing. We report the following advances in string\nindexing and analysis. We show that the BWT of a string $T\\in\n\\{1,\\ldots,\\sigma\\}^n$ can be built in deterministic $O(n)$ time using just\n$O(n\\log{\\sigma})$ bits of space, where $\\sigma \\leq n$.

The \"magic\" of\npairing heaps lies in the restructuring that happens after the deletion of the\nsmallest item. The resulting collection of trees is consolidated in two rounds:\na left-to-right pairing round, followed by a right-to-left accumulation round.\nFredman et al. showed, via an elegant correspondence to splay trees, that in a\npairing heap of size $n$ all operations take $O(\\log{n})$ amortized time.

This makes the construction impractical even for graphs of\nmoderate size. Much faster spanner constructions do exist but they only achieve\nlightness $\\Omega_\\epsilon(kn^{1/k})$, even when randomization is used.

We also compare with the popular MurmurHash3, which has no\nproven guarantees. Mixed tabulation and MurmurHash3 both perform similar to\ntruly random hashing in our experiments. However, mixed tabulation is 40%\nfaster than MurmurHash3, and it has the proven guarantee of good performance on\nall possible input. \n\n"}

Unfortunately, all known solutions for secure\nkNN either require a large communication complexity between the parties, or are\nvery inefficient to run.\n  In this work we present a classifier based on kNN, that can be implemented\nefficiently with homomorphic encryption (HE). The efficiency of our classifier\ncomes from a relaxation we make on kNN, where we allow it to consider kappa\nnearest neighbors for kappa ~ k with some probability. We therefore call our\nclassifier k-ish Nearest Neighbors (k-ish NN).\n  The success probability of our solution depends on the distribution of the\ndistances from q to S and increase as its statistical distance to Gaussian\ndecrease.\n  To implement our classifier we introduce the concept of double-blinded\ncoin-toss.

It is well known that state-of-the-art methods for\nsplit-merge MCMC do not scale well. Strategies for rapid mixing requires smart\nand informative proposals to reduce the rejection rate. However, all known\nsmart proposals involve expensive operations to suggest informative\ntransitions. As a result, the cost of each iteration is prohibitive for massive\nscale datasets. It is further known that uninformative but computationally\nefficient proposals, such as random split-merge, leads to extremely slow\nconvergence. This tradeoff between mixing time and per update cost seems hard\nto get around.\n  In this paper, we show a sweet spot. We leverage some unique properties of\nweighted MinHash, which is a popular LSH, to design a novel class of\nsplit-merge proposals which are significantly more informative than random\nsampling but at the same time efficient to compute. Overall, we obtain a\nsuperior tradeoff between convergence and per update cost.

For each\nsuch compression scheme, several different indexing solutions have been\nproposed in the last two decades. To date, the fastest indexes for repetitive\ntexts are based on the run-length compressed Burrows-Wheeler transform and on\nthe Compact Directed Acyclic Word Graph. The most space-efficient indexes, on\nthe other hand, are based on the Lempel-Ziv parsing and on grammar compression.\nIndexes for more universal schemes such as collage systems and macro schemes\nhave not yet been proposed. Very recently, Kempa and Prezza [STOC 2018] showed\nthat all dictionary compressors can be interpreted as approximation algorithms\nfor the smallest string attractor, that is, a set of text positions capturing\nall distinct substrings. Starting from this observation, in this paper we\ndevelop the first universal compressed self-index, that is, the first indexing\ndata structure based on string attractors, which can therefore be built on top\nof any dictionary-compressed text representation. Let $\\gamma$ be the size of a\nstring attractor for a text of length $n$.

Sorting\nperfectly in this model is impossible, and the objective is to minimize the\n\\emph{dislocation} of each element in the output sequence, that is, the\ndifference between its true rank and its position. Existing lower bounds for\nthis problem show that no algorithm can guarantee, with high probability,\n\\emph{maximum dislocation} and \\emph{total dislocation} better than\n$\\Omega(\\log n)$ and $\\Omega(n)$, respectively, regardless of its running time.\n  In this paper, we present the first \\emph{$O(n\\log n)$-time} sorting\nalgorithm that guarantees both \\emph{$O(\\log n)$ maximum dislocation} and\n\\emph{$O(n)$ total dislocation} with high probability. Besides improving over\nthe previous state-of-the art algorithms -- the best known algorithm had\nrunning time $\\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ -- our result indicates that comparison\nerrors do not make the problem computationally more difficult: a sequence with\nthe best possible dislocation can be obtained in $O(n\\log n)$ time and, even\nwithout comparison errors, $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ time is necessary to guarantee\nsuch dislocation bounds.\n  In order to achieve this optimal result, we solve two sub-problems, and the\nrespective methods have their own merits for further application.

If we take, for example, the standard representation of $\\GL(r)$ on\n$\\C^r$ we have to classify triples $(E,L,\\phi)$ consisting of $E$ as before and\na non-zero homomorphism $\\phi\\colon E\\lra L$ which includes the so-called\nBradlow pairs. For the representation of $\\GL(r)$ on $S^2\\C^3$ we find the\nconic bundles of Gomez and Sols. In the present paper, we will formulate a\ngeneral semistability concept for the above triples which depends on a rational\nparameter $\\delta$ and establish the existence of moduli spaces of\n$\\delta$-(semi)stable triples of fixed topological type. The notion of\nsemistability mimics the Hilbert-Mumford criterion for $SL(r)$ which is the\nmain reason that such a general approach becomes feasible. In the known\nexamples (the above, Higgs bundles, extension pairs, oriented framed bundles)\nwe show how to recover the \"usual\" semistability concept. This process of\nsimplification can also be formalized. Altogether, our results provide a\nunifying construction for the moduli spaces of most decorated vector bundle\nproblems together with an automatism for finding the right notion of\nsemistability and should therefore be of some interest. \n\n"}

Based on this, we have\nseveral detailed results on surfaces, and some results in higher dimensions.\n  For smooth affine varieties, we observe that for an affine algebraic group\nover an algebraically closed field, the diagonal is in fact a complete\nintersection; thus (D) holds, using the trivial bundle.

Our aim is to\ncontribute to the general theory of nilpotent pairs. Roughly speaking, a\nnilpotent pair (e_1,e_2) consists of two commuting elements in \\g that can\nindependently be contracted to the origin. A principal nilpotent pair is a\ndouble counterpart of a regular nilpotent element. Consequently, the theory of\nnilpotent pairs should stand out as double counterpart of the theory of\nnilpotent orbits. We show that any nilpotent pair has a characteristic\n(h_1,h_2), which is unique within to conjugacy. Generalizing Dynkin's approach\nto (sl_2)-triples, we prove that the number of G-orbits of characteristics of\nnilpotent pairs is finite and provide some estimates for the numerical labels\n\\alpha_j(h_i), where {\\alpha_j} are suitable simple roots of \\g. It was\nobserved by Ginzburg that the number of G-orbits of nilpotent pairs is\ninfinite. This means this class is too wide to have a reasonable theory. To\nresolve this difficulty, we introduce `wonderful' nilpotent pairs. We prove\nthat if two wonderful pairs have the same characteristic, then these are\nconjugate. This implies that there are finitely many G-orbits of wonderful\npairs. A number of nice properties of wonderful pairs shows that these can be\nregarded as right double analogue of nilpotent orbits. We also consider several\nnatural classes of wonderful pairs and describe characteristics for principal\nand almost principal nilpotent pairs. \n\n"}
