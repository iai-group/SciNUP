We\nfurther investigate the mechanisms underlying some reported instances of\nfailure of the Luttinger theorem. With one exception, for all the cases\nconsidered in this paper, we show that the apparent failures of the Luttinger\ntheorem can be attributed either to shortcomings of the employed\nsingle-particle Green functions or to misapplication of this theorem. The one\nexceptional case brings to light the possibility of a genuine failure of the\nLuttinger theorem for insulating ground states, which we show to be brought\nabout by a false limit that in principle can be reached on taking the\nzero-temperature limit without the value of mu coinciding with the\nzero-temperature limit of the chemical potential satisfying the equation of\nstate at finite temperatures; no such ambiguity can arise for metallic states. \n\n"}

While the attractive Hubbard\nmodel can be regarded as the generalization of BCS to Bose Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) crossover to a lattice, we find that the BEC limit of this\nHubbard model is very different from that of jellium, owing to the strong\ninter-site repulsion between pairs, which becomes important near half filling\nwhen the on-site attraction is strong. A central conclusion of our work is that\nin a lattice, around half filling, the smooth evolution from the BCS to the BEC\nlimits is interrupted. For the attractive Hubbard model, $T_c$ vanishes when\nthe system approaches the bosonic regime with increasing interaction strength.\nWe suggest that the vanishing of $T_c$ at strong coupling strength may signal a\nquantum critical transition to another form of superfluid not continuously\nconnected to a BCS-like phase.

We first describe the generic band\nstructure of an isolated FeAs layer. Use of its Abelian glide-mirror group\nallows us to reduce the primitive cell to one FeAs unit. From\ndensity-functional theory, we generate the set of eight Fe $d$ and As $p$\nlocalized Wannier functions for LaOFeAs and their tight-binding (TB)\nHamiltonian, $h(k)$. We discuss the topology of the bands, i.e. allowed and\navoided crossings, the origin of the d6 pseudogap, as well as the role of the\nAs $p$ orbitals and the elongation of the FeAs$_{4}$ tetrahedron. We then\ncouple the layers, mainly via interlayer hopping between As $p_{z}$ orbitals,\nand give the formalism for simple and body-centered tetragonal stackings. This\nallows us to explain the material-specific 3D band structures. Due to the high\nsymmetry, several level inversions take place as functions of $k_{z}$ or\npressure, resulting in linear band dispersions (Dirac cones). The underlying\nsymmetry elements are, however, easily broken, so that the Dirac points are not\nprotected, nor pinned to the Fermi level. From the paramagnetic TB Hamiltonian,\nwe form the band structures for spin spirals with wavevector $q$ by coupling\n$h(k)$ and $h (k+q)$. The band structure for stripe order is studied as a\nfunction of the exchange potential, $\\Delta$, using Stoner theory. Gapping of\nthe Fermi surface (FS) for small $\\Delta $ requires matching of FS dimensions\n(nesting) and $d$-orbital characters. The origin of the propeller-shaped FS is\nexplained. Finally, we express the magnetic energy as the sum over\nband-structure energies, which enables us to understand to what extent the\nmagnetic energies might be described by a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and the\ninterplay between the magnetic moment and the elongation of the FeAs4\ntetrahedron. \n\n"}

In\nthis article, we review theoretical studies of the Fermi liquid theory and\nCooper pairing instabilities of both electric and magnetic dipolar fermionic\nsystems from the perspective of unconventional symmetries. When the electric\ndipole moments are aligned by the external electric field, their interactions\nexhibit the explicit $d_{r^2-3z^2}$ anisotropy. The Fermi liquid properties,\nincluding the single-particle spectra, thermodynamic susceptibilities, and\ncollective excitations, are all affected by this anisotropy. The electric\ndipolar interaction provides a mechanism for the unconventional spin triplet\nCooper pairing, which is different from the usual spin-fluctuation mechanism in\nsolids and the superfluid $^3$He. Furthermore, the competition between pairing\ninstabilities in the singlet and triplet channels gives rise to a novel\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking superfluid state. Unlike electric dipole\nmoments which are induced by electric fields and unquantized, magnetic dipole\nmoments are intrinsic proportional to the hyperfine-spin operators with a Lande\nfactor. Its effects even manifest in unpolarized systems exhibiting an\nisotropic but spin-orbit coupled nature. The resultant spin-orbit coupled Fermi\nliquid theory supports a collective sound mode exhibiting a topologically\nnon-trivial spin distribution over the Fermi surface. It also leads to a novel\n$p$-wave spin triplet Cooper pairing state whose spin and orbital angular\nmomentum are entangled to the total angular momentum $J=1$ dubbed the\n$J$-triplet pairing.

Such a current can be stabilized by boundary\nmagnetic fields which do not penetrate into the bulk region of a\nsuperconductor, provided emergence of massive photons, i.e., Meissner effect.\nTherefore, we can expect that a surface persistent current is realized for a\nground/equilibrium state in the sense of stability against local perturbations.\nWe also apply Elitzur's theorem to superconductors at finite temperatures. As a\nresult, we prove absence of symmetry breaking of the global $U(1)$ phase of\nelectrons for almost all gauge fields.

This scientific field is a prime example of a domain where\ntwo-dimensional physics and photoemission-based spectroscopic techniques have\ntogether set up the development of the story. The discovery of a high-mobility\ntwo-dimensional electron system (2DES) at interfaces of transition metal oxides\nhas attracted an immense scientific interest due to new opportunities opened in\nthe emerging field of oxide electronics. The subsequent paradigm shift from\ninterfaces to the bare surfaces of TMOs made the confined electron system\naccessible to surface-sensitive spectroscopic techniques and this new era is\nthe focus of the present article. We describe how results by means of\nAngle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) establish the presence of\nconfined electron carriers at the bare surface of SrTiO$_{3}$(100), which\nexhibit complex physics phenomena such as orbital ordering, electron-phonon\ninteractions and spin splitting.

A U(1) slave-spin method\nwas used to analyze the model with nonzero orbital-level splittings. Here we\ndevelop a Landau free-energy functional to shed further light on this issue. We\nput the microscopic analysis from the U(1) slave-spin approach in this\nperspective, and show that the intersite spin correlations are crucial to the\nrenormalization of the bare hybridization amplitude towards zero and the\nconcomitant realization of the orbital-selective Mott transition. Based on this\ninsight, we discuss additional ways to study the orbital-selective Mott physics\nfrom a dynamical competition between the interorbital hybridization and\ncollective spin correlations. Our results demonstrate the robustness of the\norbital-selective Mott phase in the multiorbital models appropriate for the\niron-based superconductors. \n\n"}

This reduces the\nnumerical complexity of the calculation, which will allow us to pursue future\nDMFT simulations with more correlated impurity sites than in previous works.\nHere we present the ASCI-DMFT method and example calculations on the\none-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models that exemplify its efficient\nconvergence and timing properties. We show that the ASCI approach is several\norders of magnitude faster than the current best published ground state DMFT\nsimulations, which allows us to study the bath discretization error in\nsimulations with small clusters, as well as to address cluster sizes beyond the\ncurrent state of the art. Our approach can also be adapted for other embedding\nmethods such as density matrix embedding theory and self-energy embedding\ntheory. \n\n"}

We show that localization of large extended objects can be mapped\nto a lower-dimensional many-body localization problem. For example, motion of a\nstring involves propagation of point-like signals down its length to keep the\ndifferent segments in causal contact. For sufficiently strong disorder, all\nsuch internal modes will exhibit many-body localization, resulting in the\nlocalization of the entire string.

At a higher temperature a peak is seen in the magnetic\nsusceptibility, and changes in symmetry and in transport are seen at other\ncharacteristic temperatures. We report a meta-analysis of all measurements of\ncharacteristic temperatures well above $T_c$ in strontium doped lanthanum\ncuprate (LSCO) and oxygen doped YBCO. The experimental corpus shows that the\npseudogap line is one of a family of four straight lines which stretches across\nthe phase diagram from low to high doping, and from $T_c$ up to $700$ K. These\nlines all originate from a single point near the overdoped limit of the\nsuperconducting phase and increase as doping is reduced. The slope of the\npseudogap lines is quantized, with the second, third, and fourth lines having\nslopes that are respectively $1/2,\\;1/3,$ and $1/4$ of the slope of the highest\nline.

The persistence of the low-lying magnetic excitations at temperatures lower\nthan $T_c$ and $T_N$ is ascribed due to the uniform mixed phase of SC and AFM.\nLikewise, the $P$-induced HF superconductor CeRhIn$_5$ coexists with AFM on a\nmicroscopic level in $P = 1.5$ - 1.9 GPa. The unconventional gapless nature of\nSC in the low-lying excitation spectrum emerges due to the uniform mixed phase\nof AFM and SC. By contrast, in CeIn$_3$, we propose that the magnetic\nexcitations such as spin-density fluctuations induced by the first-order phase\ntransition from the AFM to the paramagnetism (PM) might mediate attractive\ninteraction to form the Cooper pairs in the novel phase of AFM. \n\n"}

The\nobservation of a pseudogap, e.g. in ARPES experiments, is a familiar example of\nthis physics. One potential explanation for this behaviour involves preformed\npairs with finite lifetimes existing in the normal state above T$_c$. In this\nway two characteristic temperatures can be established. A higher one T$^*$ at\nwhich pairs begin to form and the actual T$_c$ at which a phase-coherent\nsuperconducting phase is established.\n  In order to test these ideas we have investigated the negative U Hubbard\nmodel in two dimensions in the fully self-consistent ladder approximation at\nlow electron densities.
