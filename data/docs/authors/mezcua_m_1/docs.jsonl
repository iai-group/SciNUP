A vast array of\nscience will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST will\nhave unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is\ndriven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking\nan inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and\nmapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system sited at\nCerro Pach\\'{o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m\neffective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel\ncamera. The standard observing sequence will consist of pairs of 15-second\nexposures in a given field, with two such visits in each pointing in a given\nnight. With these repeats, the LSST system is capable of imaging about 10,000\nsquare degrees of sky in a single filter in three nights. The typical 5$\\sigma$\npoint-source depth in a single visit in $r$ will be $\\sim 24.5$ (AB). The\nproject is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations\nby 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg$^2$ with\n$\\delta<+34.5^\\circ$, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, $ugrizy$,\ncovering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. About 90\\% of the observing time\nwill be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will uniformly observe a\n18,000 deg$^2$ region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the\nanticipated 10 years of operations, and yield a coadded map to $r\\sim27.5$. The\nremaining 10\\% of the observing time will be allocated to projects such as a\nVery Deep and Fast time domain survey. The goal is to make LSST data products,\nincluding a relational database of about 32 trillion observations of 40 billion\nobjects, available to the public and scientists around the world. \n\n"}

We\ndetect a series of A-X bandheads from CO and estimate N(CO) = 10^16.5 cm^-2 and\nT_ex^CO > 100K.

Similarly, we observe H2 absorption\nvia the Lyman-Werner bands and estimate N(H2) = 10^21.2 cm^-2 with T_ex^H2 =\n10--300K. The afterglow photometry suggests an extinction law with R_V=4 and\nA_V=3.2 mag and requires the presence of a modest 2175A bump. Additionally,\nmodeling of the Swift/XRT X-ray spectrum confirms a large column density with\nN(H) = 10^22.58 cm^-2.

This interpretation is supported by the Butcher-Oemler effect.\n  We investigate E+A galaxies as an intermediate state between late-type\ngalaxies in low density environments and early-type galaxies in high density\nenvironment to constrain the possible transformation processes. For this\npurpose we model a grid of post-starburst galaxies by inducing a burst and/or a\nhalting of star formation on the normal evolution of spiral galaxies with our\ngalaxy evolution code GALEV.\n  From our models we find that the common E+A criteria exclude a significant\nnumber of post-starburst galaxies and propose that comparing their spectral\nenergy distributions leads to a more sufficient method to investigate\npost-starbust galaxies. We predict that a higher number of E+A galaxies in the\nearly universe can not be ascribed solely to a higher number of starburst, but\nis a result of a lower metallicity and a higher burst strength due to more gas\ncontent of the galaxies in the early universe.

We find that the X-ray filament consists of five spatially\nresolved X-ray knots embedded in a continuous diffuse bridge. The spectrum of\neach knot is well fitted by a thermal model with temperatures ranging from\n0.3-0.7 keV and subsolar elemental abundances. In four of the five knots,\nnon-thermal models are a poor fit to the spectra, conclusively ruling out\nsynchrotron or IC/CMB mechanisms for their emission. The internal pressures of\nthe knots exceed that of the ambient ISM or the equipartition pressure of the\nNML by more than an order of magnitude, demonstrating that they must be short\nlived ($\\sim3\\times10^6$ yrs). Based on energetic arguments, it is implausible\nthat these knots have been ionized by the beamed flux from the active galactic\nnucleus of Cen A or that they have been shock-heated by supersonic inflation of\nthe NML. In our view, the most viable scenario for the origin of the X-ray\nknots is that they are the result of cold gas shock heated by a direct\ninteraction with the jet. The lifetimes of the X-ray knots in the NML are\nroughly the same as the age of the strong shock around the SW inner lobe,\nsuggesting they were created in the same AGN outburst. The most plausible model\nof the NML is that it is a bubble from a previous outburst that is being\nre-energized by the current outburst.

This limits the cutoff scale in the linear\nmatter power spectrum to k < 35/kpc which can be explained by e.g., warm dark\nmatter. Very near future Fermi observations will strongly constrain the minimum\nmass to be > 10^3 M_sun: if the true substructure cutoff is much smaller than\nthis, the DM interpretation of the Fermi/PAMELA/HESS data must be wrong.

The Suzaku spectrum exhibits highly\nstatistically significant absorption features near 9 keV in the quasar\nrest--frame. We show that the most plausible origin of the absorption is from\nblue-shifted resonance (1s-2p) transitions of hydrogen-like iron (at 6.97 keV\nin the rest frame). This indicates that a highly ionized outflow may be present\nmoving at near relativistic velocities (~0.25c). A possible hard X-ray excess\nis detected above 15 keV with HXD (at 99.8% confidence), which may arise from\nhigh column density gas (Nh>10^24cm^-2) partially covering the X-ray emission,\nor through strong Compton reflection.

If this is interpreted as an age\nspread, the multiple populations are separated by a few hundred Myr, which\nwould call into question the long held notion that clusters are simple stellar\npopulations. Here we show that stellar rotation in stars with masses between\n1.2-1.7 Msun can mimic the effect of a double or multiple population, whereas\nin actuality only a single population exists. The two main causes of the spread\nnear the turn-off are the effects of stellar rotation on the structure of the\nstar and the inclination angle of the star relative to the observer.

In particular, we show that if one records an\nanisotropy signal produced by heavy nuclei of charge Z above an energy E_{thr},\none should record an even stronger (possibly much stronger) anisotropy at\nenergies >E_{thr}/Z due to the proton component that is expected to be\nassociated with the sources of the heavy nuclei. This conclusion remains robust\nwith respect to the parameters characterizing the sources and it does not\ndepend at all on the modelling of astrophysical magnetic fields. As a concrete\nexample, we apply this test to the most recent data of the Pierre Auger\nObservatory. Assuming that the anisotropy reported above 55EeV is not a\nstatistical accident, and that no significant anisotropy has been observed at\nenergies <10EeV, we show that the apparent clustering toward Cen A cannot be\nattributed to heavy nuclei. Similar conclusions are drawn regarding the\napparent excess correlation with nearby active galactic nuclei.

We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before).

They are interesting both because they may allow one to\ndetermine fundamental neutron-star properties by modeling their spectra, and\nbecause they appear to be a large fraction of the overall neutron-star\npopulation. Here, we describe a series of XMM-Newton observations of the nearby\nisolated neutron star RX J0806.4-4123, taken as part of larger program of\ntiming studies. From these, we limit the spin-down rate to\ndnu/dt=(-4.3+/-2.3)*10^{-16} Hz/s.

The first model assumes the injection of\nrelativistic particles into a downstream region of a shock wave inside a jet\nthat creates the emitting source. The model precisely describes the evolution\nof the particle energy spectrum inside the source and takes into account a\nlight-crossing time effect for the produced radiation.

We find that the star-forming\nregions within the GMCs are invariably formed by gravitational contraction.\nAfter an initial period of contraction, the collapsing clouds begin forming\nstars, whose feedback evaporates part of the clouds' mass, opposing the\ncontinuing accretion from the infalling gas. The competition of accretion\nagainst dense gas consumption by star formation (SF) and evaporation by the\nfeedback, regulates the clouds' mass and energy balance, as well as their SFE.\nWe find that, in the presence of feedback, the clouds attain levels of the SFE\nthat are consistent at all times with observational determinations for regions\nof comparable SF rates (SFRs). However, we observe that the dense gas mass is\nlarger in general in the presence of feedback, while the total (dense gas +\nstars) is nearly insensitive to the presence of feedback, suggesting that the\ntotal mass is determined by the accretion, while the feedback inhibits mainly\nthe conversion of dense gas to stars.

Basically, the propagation of photons emitted by a GRB through cosmic\nmagnetic fields with a domain-like structure induces photon-ALP mixing, which\nis expected to produce a strong modification of the original photon\npolarization. Because of the random orientation of the magnetic field in each\ndomain, this effect strongly depends on the orientation of the photon line of\nsight. As a consequence, photon-ALP conversion considerably broadens the\noriginal polarization distribution.

As a result, the surface temperature of the star can become\nsignificantly higher than it is in the normal state resulting from\nthermonuclear burning. We wonder whether high energy electrons and gamma-rays,\ninjected within the binary system, can efficiently interact with this enhanced\nradiation field. To decide this, we calculate the optical depths for the\ngamma-ray photons in the radiation field of such irradiated star as a function\nof the phase of the binary system. Based on these calculations, we conclude\nthat compact low mass X-ray binary systems may also become sources of high\nenergy gamma-rays since conditions for interaction of electrons and gamma-rays\nare quite similar to these ones observed within the high mass TeV gamma-ray\nbinaries such as LS 5039 and LSI 303 +61.

However, the\nphysical processes that initiate and govern the birth of massive stars remain\npoorly understood. Two widely discussed models are monolithic collapse of\nmolecular cloud cores and competitive accretion. To learn more about massive\nstar formation, we perform simulations of the collapse of rotating, massive,\ncloud cores including radiative heating by both non-ionizing and ionizing\nradiation using the FLASH adaptive mesh refinement code. These simulations show\nfragmentation from gravitational instability in the enormously dense accretion\nflows required to build up massive stars. Secondary stars form rapidly in these\nflows and accrete mass that would have otherwise been consumed by the massive\nstar in the center, in a process that we term fragmentation-induced starvation.\nThis explains why massive stars are usually found as members of high-order\nstellar systems that themselves belong to large clusters containing stars of\nall masses. The radiative heating does not prevent fragmentation, but does lead\nto a higher Jeans mass, resulting in fewer and more massive stars than would\nform without the heating. This mechanism reproduces the observed relation\nbetween the total stellar mass in the cluster and the mass of the largest star.\nIt predicts strong clumping and filamentary structure in the center of\ncollapsing cores, as has recently been observed. We speculate that a similar\nmechanism will act during primordial star formation. \n\n"}

Abstract: A time-resolved spectral analysis for a sample of 22 intense, broad GRB\npulses from the BATSE GRB sample is presented. We fit the spectra with the Band\nfunction and investigate the correlation between the observed flux (F) and the\npeak energy (E_p) of the $\\nu f_\\nu$ spectrum in the rising and decaying phases\nof these pulses. Two kinds of E_p evolution trends, i.e., hard-to-soft (the\ntwo-third pulses in our sample) and $E_{\\rm p}$-tracing-$F$ (the one-third\npulses in our sample) are observed in pulses from different GRBs and even from\ndifferent pulses of the same burst. No dependence of spectral evolution feature\non the pulse shape is found. A tight $F-E_{\\rm p}$ positive correlation is\nobserved in the decaying phases, with a power-law index $\\sim 2.2$, which is\nmuch shallower than that expectation of the curvature effect. In the rising\nphase, the observed $F$ is either correlated or anti-correlated with $E_{\\rm\np}$, depending on the spectral evolution feature, and the power-law index of\nthe correlation is dramatically different among pulses. More than $80%$ of the\nlow energy photon indices in the time-resolved spectra whose $E_{\\rm p}$ is\nanti-correlated with $F$ during the rising phase violate the death line of the\nsynchrotron radiation, disfavoring the synchrotron radiation model for these\ngamma-rays. The $F-E_{\\rm p}$ correlation, especially for those GRBs with\n$E_{\\rm p}$-tracking-$F$ spectral evolution, may be due to the viewing angle\nand jet structure effects. In this cenario, the observed $F-E_{\\rm p}$\ncorrelation in the rising phase may be due to the line of sight from off-beam\nto on-beam toward a structured jet (or jitter), and the decaying phase is\ncontributed by both the on-beam emission and the decayed photons from high\nlatitude of the GRB fireball,resulting in a shallower slope of the observed\n$F-E_{\\rm p}$ correlation than that predicted by the pure curvature effect. \n\n"}

The model explaining this\nnew behavior of flare activity could be consistent with adiabatically cooling\nplasma blobs that are expanding but also partially eclipsing the background\nquiescent emission from Sgr A*. When a flare is launched, the plasma blob is\nmost compact and is brightest in the optically thin regime whereas the emission\nin radio/submm wavelengths has a higher opacity. Absorption in the observed\nlight curve of Sgr A* at radio/submm flux is due to the combined effects of\nlower brightness temperature of plasma blobs with respect to the quiescent\nbrightness temperature and high opacity of plasma blobs. This implies that\nplasma blobs are mainly placed in the magnetosphere of a disk-like flow or\nfurther out in the flow.

One of the\nappealing models is the late internal dissipation model, where X-ray emission\nduring the shallow-decay phase is attributed to internal dissipation, analogous\nto the prompt gamma-ray emission. We discuss possible scenarios of the late\nprompt emission, such as late internal shocks, magnetic reconnection, and\nphotospheric dissipation. We also consider the consequences of late dissipation\nand a two-component (early and late) jet model for the high-energy (GeV-TeV)\nemission. We study not only synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission from the\nearly and late jets but also external inverse-Compton (EIC) emission, which is\nnaturally predicted in the late dissipation model. For the latter, we perform\nnumerical calculations taking into account the equal-arrival-time surface of\nEIC photons and show that the EIC component typically has a peak at ~1-100 GeV\nwhich may dominate over the SSC components.

Observations and theory support models in\nwhich these cusps are formed by dissipative gas inflows and nuclear starbursts\nin gas-rich mergers.

We argue\nthat the power-law surface density profiles observed are a natural consequence\nof the gravitational instabilities that dominate angular momentum transport in\nthe gravitational potential of a central massive black hole. The dominant mode\nat these radii is an m=1 lopsided/eccentric disk instability, in which stars\ntorquing the gas can drive rapid inflow and accretion. Such a mode first\ngenerically appears at large radii and propagates inwards by exciting\neccentricities at smaller and smaller radii, where M*(<R)<<M_BH. When the\nstellar surface density profile is comparatively shallow with n<1/2, the modes\ncannot efficiently propagate to R=0 and so gas piles up and star formation\nsteepens the profile.

We find that the covering fraction of\nmolecular gas at z~3 is not adequate to explain the emission in the outskirts\nof LBGs, while the covering fraction of neutral atomic-dominated hydrogen gas\nat high redshift is sufficient. We develop a theoretical framework to connect\nthis emission around LBGs to the expected emission from neutral H I gas i.e.,\ndamped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs), using the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation.\nWorking under the hypothesis that the observed FUV emission in the outskirts of\nLBGs is from in situ star formation in atomic-dominated hydrogen gas, the\nresults suggest that the SFR efficiency in such gas at z~3 is between factors\nof 10 and 50 lower than predictions based on the local KS relation. The total\nSFR density in atomic-dominated gas at z~3 is constrained to be ~10% of that\nobserved from the inner regions of LBGs. In addition, the metals produced by in\nsitu star formation in the outskirts of LBGs yield metallicities comparable to\nthose of DLAs, which is a possible solution to the \"Missing Metals\" problem for\nDLAs.

As a result, heavy elements will be\nunder-ionized after they have passed through the accretion shock. We have\nstudied systematically the effects of non-equilibrium ionization for relaxed\nclusters in the LambdaCDM cosmology using one-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations. We found that non-equilibrium ionization effects do not depend on\ncluster mass but depend strongly on redshift which can be understood by\nself-similar scaling arguments. The effects are stronger for clusters at lower\nredshifts. We present X-ray signatures such as surface brightness profiles and\nemission lines in detail for a massive cluster at low redshift. In general,\nsoft emission (0.3-1.0 keV) is enhanced significantly by under-ionization, and\nthe enhancement can be nearly an order of magnitude near the shock radius. The\nmost prominent non-equilibrium ionization signature we found is the O VII and O\nVIII line ratio. The ratios for non-equilibrium ionization and collisional\nionization equilibrium models are different by more than an order of magnitude\nat radii beyond half of the shock radius. These non-equilibrium ionization\nsignatures are equally strong for models with different non-adiabatic shock\nelectron heating efficiencies.

The hard X-ray spectra of\nSeyferts as well as of Galactic stellar-mass black holes (GBHs) are well\nrepresented by thermal Comptonization, but the origin of the seed photons is\nless certain. The MeV tails observed in GBHs provide evidence in favour of\nnon-thermal electron tails and it is possible that such electrons are also\npresent in the X-ray emitting regions of AGNs. Using simulations with the\nkinetic code that self-consistently models electron and photon distributions,\nwe find that the power-law-like X-ray spectra in AGNs can be explained in terms\nof the synchrotron self-Compton radiation of hybrid thermal/non-thermal\nelectrons, similarly to the hard/low state of GBHs. Under a very broad range of\nparameters the model predicts a rather narrow distribution of photon spectral\nslopes consistent with that observed from LINERs and Seyferts at luminosities\nless than 3 per cent of the Eddington luminosity. The entire infrared to X-ray\nspectrum of these objects can be described in terms of our model, suggesting a\ntight correlation between the two energy bands.

In particular, we consider the possibility that the rise\nin the positron fraction observed by the PAMELA satellite is due to the\nproduction through (hadronic) cosmic ray spallation and subsequent acceleration\nof positrons, in the same sources as the primary cosmic rays. We present a new\nanalytical estimate of the range of possible fluctuations in the high energy\nelectron flux due to the discreteness of plausible cosmic ray sources.

We have built a mixed\ndwarfs+clusters sample containing some of the most promising nearby dwarf\ngalaxies (Draco, Ursa Minor, Wilman 1 and Segue 1) and local galaxy clusters\n(Perseus, Coma, Ophiuchus, Virgo, Fornax, NGC5813 and NGC5846), and then\ncompute their DM annihilation flux profiles by making use of the latest\nmodeling of their DM density profiles. We also include in our calculations the\neffect of DM substructure. Willman 1 appears as the best candidate in the\nsample. However, its mass modeling is still rather uncertain, so probably other\ncandidates with less uncertainties and quite similar fluxes, namely Ursa Minor\nand Segue 1, might be better options.

After initially considering radio loudnesses derived using total\nradio luminosities, we repeat the investigation using core radio luminosities\nonly, applying a previously established mass correction for these core\nluminosities. In both cases, for Eddington ratios < 1 per cent, Fanaroff-Riley\ntype I and broad-line radio galaxies are on average more radio-loud than\nSeyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. However, the\ndistribution of radio loudnesses for the mass-corrected, core-only sample is\nmuch narrower than that of the clearly bimodal total radio loudness\ndistribution. The advantages and disadvantages of using core- or lobe-dominated\nradio luminosity as a measure of instantaneous jet power are discussed. We\nfurthermore compare the core and total radio luminosities for the entire\nsample, as well as illustrating the importance of the mass term by comparing\nthe AGN with a sample of black hole X-ray binaries.

The fact that the most massive clusters probe the\nhigh-mass tail of the mass function, where the difference between LCDM and\nalternative cosmological models is strongest, makes our method particularly\ninteresting as a cosmological probe.

Spectra of SN2010jp display an unprecedented triple-peaked\nH$\\alpha$ line profile, showing: (1) a narrow (800 km/s) central component that\nsuggests shock interaction with dense CSM; (2) high-velocity blue and red\nemission features centered at -12600 and +15400 km/s; and (3) broad wings\nextending from -22000 to +25000 km/s. These features persist during 100 days\nafter explosion. We propose that this line profile indicates a bipolar\njet-driven explosion, with the central component produced by normal SN ejecta\nand CSM interaction at mid latitudes, while the high-velocity bumps and broad\nline wings arise in a nonrelativistic bipolar jet. Two variations of the jet\ninterpretation seem plausible: (1) A fast jet mixes 56Ni to high velocities in\npolar zones of the H-rich envelope, or (2) the reverse shock in the jet\nproduces blue and red bumps in Balmer lines when a jet interacts with dense\nCSM.

We vary four parameters: the gas polytropic\nindex Gamma, its temperature at large radii T_xi, the DM logarithmic slope at\nlarge radii zeta and its concentration c_vir. When comparing the model to the\nobserved mass-temperature (M-T) relation of local clusters, our results are\nindependent of both T_xi and c_vir. We thus obtain constraints on Gamma, by\nfixing the DM profile, and on zeta, by fixing the gas profile. For an NFW DM\nprofile, we find that 6/5<Gamma<13/10, which is consistent with numerical\nsimulations and observations of individual clusters. Taking 6/5<Gamma<13/10\nallows the DM profile to be slightly steeper than the NFW profile at large\nradii. Upon including local groups, we constrain the mass-dependence of Gamma\nand the value of T_xi. Interestingly, with Gamma=6/5 and zeta=-3, we reproduce\nthe observed steepening/breaking of the M-T relation at low M, if 10^6\nK<T_xi<10^7 K, consistent with simulations and observations of the warm-hot\nintergalactic medium.

In particular, at high redshift, models\nexpect that feedback associated with quasar-driven outflows is so efficient\nthat the gas in the host galaxy is largely swept away or heated up, hence\nsuppressing star formation in massive galaxies. We observationally investigate\nthis phenomenon by using VLT-SINFONI integral field spectroscopy of the\nluminous quasar 2QZJ002830.4-281706 at z=2.4. The spectra sample the optical\nemission lines redshifted into the near-IR. The [OIII]5007 emission-line\nkinematics map reveals a massive outflow on scales of several kpc. The\ndetection of narrow Halpha emission reveals star formation in the quasar host\ngalaxy, with SFR=100 Msun/yr. However, the star formation is not distributed\nuniformly, but is strongly suppressed in the region with the highest outflow\nvelocity and highest velocity dispersion. This result indicates that star\nformation in this region is strongly quenched by the quasar outflow, which is\ncleaning the galaxy disk of its molecular gas. This is one of the first direct\nobservational proofs of quasar feedback quenching the star formation at high\nredshift. \n\n"}

Abstract: The Galactic centre - as the closest galactic nucleus - holds both intrinsic\ninterest and possibly represents a useful analogue to star-burst nuclei which\nwe can observe with orders of magnitude finer detail than these external\nsystems. The environmental conditions in the GC - here taken to mean the inner\n200 pc in diameter of the Milky Way - are extreme with respect to those\ntypically encountered in the Galactic disk. The energy densities of the various\nGC ISM components are typically ~two orders of magnitude larger than those\nfound locally and the star-formation rate density ~three orders of magnitude\nlarger. Unusually within the Galaxy, the Galactic centre exhibits\nhard-spectrum, diffuse TeV (=10^12 eV) gamma-ray emission spatially coincident\nwith the region's molecular gas. Recently the nuclei of local star-burst\ngalaxies NGC 253 and M82 have also been detected in gamma-rays of such\nenergies. We have embarked on an extended campaign of modelling the broadband\n(radio continuum to TeV gamma-ray), non- thermal signals received from the\ninner 200 pc of the Galaxy. On the basis of this modelling we find that\nstar-formation and associated supernova activity is the ultimate driver of the\nregion's non-thermal activity. This activity drives a large-scale wind of hot\nplasma and cosmic rays out of the GC. The wind advects the locally-accelerated\ncosmic rays quickly, before they can lose much energy in situ or penetrate into\nthe densest molecular gas cores where star-formation occurs. The cosmic rays\ncan, however, heat/ionize the lower density/warm H2 phase enveloping the cores.\nOn very large scales (~10 kpc) the non-thermal signature of the escaping GC\ncosmic rays has probably been detected recently as the spectacular 'Fermi\nbubbles' and corresponding 'WMAP haze'. \n\n"}

G2 is a sensitive probe of the hot accretion\nzone of Sgr A*, requiring gas temperatures and densities that agree well with\nmodels of captured shock-heated stellar winds. Its mass is equal to the\ncritical mass below which cold clumps would be destroyed quickly by\nevaporation. Its mass is also constrained by the fact that at apocenter its\nsound crossing timescale was equal to its orbital timescale. Our numerical\nsimulations show that the observed structure and evolution of G2 can be well\nreproduced if it formed in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding in 1995 at\na distance from the SMBH of 7.6e16 cm. If the cloud would have formed at\napocenter in the 'clockwise' stellar disk as expected from its orbit, it would\nbe torn into a very elongated spaghetti-like filament by 2011 which is not\nobserved.

Both Type I\n(single exponential) and Type II (down-turning) observed disk\nsurface-brightness profiles can be explained by our findings.

We suggest\nthat the naturally occurring larger resonance widths at galactic radii beyond\nfour scale-lengths may have profound consequences on the formation and location\nof breaks in disk density profiles, provided spirals are present at such large\ndistances. We also consider the effect of gas inflow and show that when\nin-plane smooth gas accretion of ~5 M_sun/yr is included, the outer disks\nbecome more unstable, leading to a strong increase in the stellar velocity\ndispersion.

Using a sample with a broad range in orientation\nangle, including radio galaxies and blazars, we find that very high power\nsources (L_kin > 10^45.5 erg s^{-1}) show a significant increase in the ratio\nof inverse Compton to synchrotron power (Compton dominance) with decreasing\norientation angle, as measured by the radio core dominance and confirmed by the\ndistribution of superluminal speeds. This increase is consistent with beaming\nexpectations for external Compton (EC) emission, but not for synchrotron self\nCompton (SSC) emission. For the lowest power jets (L_kin < 10^43.5 erg s^{-1}),\nno trend between Compton and radio core dominance is found, consistent with\nSSC. Importantly, the EC trend is not seen for moderately high power flat\nspectrum radio quasars with strong external photon fields.

Massive molecular\noutflows have recently been revealed in some AGN hosts. However, the physical\nproperties and structure of these AGN-driven molecular outflows are still\npoorly constrained. Here we present new IRAM PdBI observations of Mrk231, the\nclosest quasar known, targeting both the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) transitions. We\ndetect broad wings in both transitions, tracing a massive molecular outflow\nwith velocities up to 800 km/s. The wings are spatially resolved at high\nsignificance level (5-11 sigma), indicating that the molecular outflow extends\non the kpc scale. The CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ratio of the red broad wings is\nconsistent with the ratio observed in the narrow core, while the blue broad\nwing is less excited than the core. The latter result suggests that quasar\ndriven outflow models invoking shocks (which would predict higher gas\nexcitation) are not appropriate to describe the bulk of the outflow in Mrk231.\nHowever, we note that within the central 700 pc the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ratio of\nthe red wing is slightly, but significantly, higher than in the line core,\nsuggesting that shocks may play a role in the central region.

Galactic outflows driven by supernovae/stellar winds are the\nleading mechanism for explaining this fact. The scaling relation between galaxy\nmass and outer rotation velocity (also known as the baryonic Tully-Fisher\nrelation, BTF) has recently been used as evidence against this viewpoint. We\nuse a LCDM based semi-analytic disk galaxy formation model to investigate these\nclaims. In our model, galaxies with less efficient star formation and higher\ngas fractions are more efficient at ejecting gas from galaxies. This is due to\nthe fact that galaxies with less efficient star formation and higher gas\nfractions tend to live in dark matter haloes with lower circular velocities,\nfrom which less energy is required to escape the potential well. In our model\nthe intrinsic scatter in the BTF is 0.15 dex, and mostly reflects scatter in\ndark halo concentration. The observed scatter, equal to 0.24 dex, is dominated\nby measurement errors. The best estimate for the intrinsic scatter is that it\nis less than 0.15 dex, and thus our LCDM based model (which does not include\nall possible sources of scatter) is only just consistent with this. In our\nmodel, gas rich galaxies, at fixed virial velocity (V_vir), with lower stellar\nmasses have lower baryonic masses. This is consistent with the expectation that\ngalaxies with lower stellar masses have had less energy available to drive an\noutflow. However, when the outer rotation velocity (V_flat) is used the\ncorrelation has the opposite sign, with a slope in agreement with observations.\nThis is due to scatter in the relation between V_flat and V_vir. In summary,\ncontrary to some previous claims, we show that basic features of the BTF are\nconsistent with a LCDM based model in which the low efficiency of galaxy\nformation is determined by galactic outflows. \n\n"}

Ultra-violet (UV) emission from a quasar is normally\nfree from the contamination from its host galaxy. Polarization fraction of the\nquasar's disc emission can therefore be determined by comparing total UV\nemission with polarized visible to near-infrared (NIR) emission; and the\nresulting continuum spectrum from UV to infrared can reveal the theoretically\nexpected Balmer edge absorption feature.

The physical\nparameters of the model - proton injection rate, electron-to-proton ratio and\ndownstream magnetic field strength - are determined through a fit of the result\nto the observed spatially-integrated synchrotron emission properties. The only\nremaining unknown astronomical parameter, the circumstellar gas number density,\nis determined by a normalization of the amplitude of the gamma-ray flux to the\nobserved amplitude. The bipolar morphology of both nonthermal X-ray and\ngamma-ray emissions is explained by the preferential injection of suprathermal\nnuclei and subsequent magnetic field amplification in the quasi-parallel\nregions of the outer supernova shock. The above parameters provide an improved\nfit to all existing nonthermal emission data, including the TeV emission\nspectrum recently detected by H.E.S.S., with the circumstellar hydrogen gas\nnumber density $N_H\\approx 0.06 cm^{-3}$ close to values derived from\nobservations of thermal X-rays.

To date, our understanding of why Xco should be so\nconstant remains poor. Using a combination of extremely high resolution (~ 1\npc) galaxy evolution simulations and molecular line radiative transfer\ncalculations, we suggest that Xco displays a narrow range of values in the\nGalaxy due to the fact that molecular clouds share very similar physical\nproperties. In our models, this is itself a consequence of stellar feedback\ncompeting against gravitational collapse.

Therefore, the X-ray emission from lensed quasars is\nfirst strongly lensed by the black hole before it is lensed by the foreground\ngalaxy and star fields. We present a scheme that combines the initial strong\nlensing of a Kerr black hole with standard linearized microlensing by\nintervening stars. We find that X-ray microlensed light curves incorporating\nKerr strong gravity can differ significantly from standard curves. The\namplitude of the fluctuations in the light curves can increase or decrease by\n~0.65-0.75 mag by including Kerr strong gravity. Larger inclination angles give\nlarger amplitude fluctuations in the microlensing light curves. Consequently,\ncurrent X-ray microlensing observations might have under or overestimated the\nsizes of the X-ray emission regions. We estimate this bias using a simple\nmetric based on the amplitude of magnitude fluctuations. The half light radius\nof the X-ray emission region can be underestimated up to ~50% or overestimated\nup to ~20%. Underestimates are found in most situations we have investigated.\nThe only exception is for a disk with large spin, radially flat emission\nprofile, and observed nearly face on, where an overestimate is found. Thus,\nmore accurate microlensing size constraints should be obtainable by including\nKerr lensing. The caustic crossing time can differ by months after including\nKerr strong gravity. A simultaneous monitoring of gravitational lensed quasars\nin both X-ray and optical bands with densely sampled X-ray light curves might\nreveal this feature.

To investigate this\nproposal, we compare the metallicity of the hosts of LGRBs, broad-lined Type Ic\n(Ic-bl) supernovae (SNe), and Type II SNe to each other and to the metallicity\ndistribution of star-forming galaxies using the SDSS to represent galaxies in\nthe local universe and the TKRS for galaxies at intermediate redshifts.\n  The differing metallicity distributions of the LGRB hosts and the star\nformation in local galaxies forces us to conclude that the low-metallicity\npreference of LGRBs is not primarily driven by the anti-correlation between\nstar-formation and metallicity, but rather must be overwhelmingly due to the\nastrophysics of the LGRBs themselves. Three quarters of our LGRB sample are\nfound at metallicities below 12+log(O/H) < 8.6, while less than a tenth of\nlocal star-formation is at similarly low metallicities. However, our SN samples\nare statistically consistent with the metallicity distribution of the general\ngalaxy population.

Several mysteries cloud the interpretation\nof this event: (1) extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray\nlight curve during the first 10 days after the gamma-ray trigger; (2)\nunexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission months after\ntrigger; (3) no obvious evidence for jet precession, despite misalignment\ntypically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disk and BH;\n(4) recent abrupt shut-off in jet X-ray emission after 1.5 years. Here we show\nthat all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one\nassumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Phi threading the BH.\nInitially, Phi is weak relative to high fall-back mass accretion rate, Mdot,\nand the disk and jets precess about the BH axis = our line of sight. As Mdot\ndrops, Phi becomes dynamically important and leads to a magnetically-arrested\ndisk (MAD). MAD naturally aligns disk and jet axis along the BH spin axis, but\nonly after a violent rearrangement phase (jet wobbling). This explains the\nerratic light curve at early times and the lack of precession at later times.\nWe use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain BH and disrupted star\nproperties, finding that a solar-mass main sequence star disrupted by a\nrelatively low mass, M~10^5-10^6 Msun, BH is consistent with the data, while a\nWD disruption (though still possible) is disfavored.

Turbulent disks are never completely\nstable: we calculate the (always finite) probability of forming\nself-gravitating structures via stochastic turbulent density fluctuations in\nsuch disks. Modest sub-sonic turbulence above Mach number ~0.1 can produce a\nfew stochastic fragmentation or 'direct collapse' events over ~Myr timescales,\neven if Q>>1 and cooling is slow (t_cool>>t_orbit). In trans-sonic turbulence\nthis extends to Q~100. We derive the true Q-criterion needed to suppress such\nevents, which scales exponentially with Mach number.

As part of\nthe \"Water In Star-forming regions with Herschel\" (WISH) key program, water and\nother important molecules, such as CO and OH, have been observed in 51 embedded\nyoung stellar objects (YSOs). The studied sample covers a range of luminosities\nfrom <1 to >10^5 L_sol. Aims; We analyse the CO line emission towards a large\nsample of protostars in terms of both line intensities and profiles. Methods;\nHerschel-HIFI spectra of the 12CO 10-9, 13CO 10-9 and C18O 5-4, 9-8 and 10-9\nlines are analysed for a sample of 51 YSOs. In addition, JCMT spectra of 12CO\n3-2 and C18O 3-2 extend this analysis to cooler gas components. Results; All\nobserved CO and isotopologue spectra show a strong linear correlation between\nthe logarithms of the line and bolometric luminosities across six orders of\nmagnitude on both axes. This suggests that the high-J CO lines primarily trace\nthe amount of dense gas associated with YSOs. This relation can be extended to\nlarger (extragalactic) scales. The majority of the detected 12CO line profiles\ncan be decomposed into a broad and a narrow Gaussian component, while the C18O\nspectra are mainly fitted with a single Gaussian. A broadening of the line\nprofile is also observed from pre-stellar cores to embedded protostars, which\nis due mostly to non-thermal motions (turbulence/infall). The widths of the\nbroad 12CO 3-2 and 10-9 velocity components correlate with those of the narrow\nC18O 9-8 profiles, suggesting that the entrained outflowing gas and envelope\nmotions are related independent of the mass of the protostar. These results\nindicate that physical processes in protostellar envelopes have similar\ncharacteristics across the studied luminosity range. \n\n"}

Abstract: The intrinsic X-ray emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is often found to be\nabsorbed over and above the column density through our own galaxy. The extra\ncomponent is usually assumed to be due to absorbing gas lying within the host\ngalaxy of the GRB itself. There is an apparent correlation between the\nequivalent column density of hydrogen, N(H,intrinsic) (assuming it to be at the\nGRB redshift), and redshift, z, with the few z>6 GRBs showing the greatest\nintrinsic column densities. We investigate the N(H,intrinsic) - z relation\nusing a large sample of Swift GRBs, as well as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nquasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energy\ndistributions of the two highest redshift GRBs. Various possible sample biases\nand systematics that might produce such a correlation are considered, and we\nconclude that the correlation is very likely to be real. This may indicate\neither an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contribution\nfrom gas along the line-of-sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) or\nintervening absorbing clouds. Employing a more realistic model for IGM\nabsorption than in previous works, we find that this may explain much of the\nobserved opacity at z>~3 providing it is not too hot, likely between 10^5 K and\n10^6.5 K, and moderately metal enriched, Z~0.2 Z_sun. This material could\ntherefore constitute the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium. However, a comparable\nlevel of absorption is also expected from the cumulative effect of intervening\ncold gas clouds, and given current uncertainties it is not possible to say\nwhich, if either, dominates.

Compared to previous work, we improve the\ncalculation of the radiative force due to X-rays. More importantly, in addition\nto radiative pressure and radiative heating/cooling directly from the central\nAGN, in the momentum equation we also include the force due to the scattered\nand reprocessed photons. We find that the accretion flow properties change\nsignificantly due to this \"re-radiation\" effect.

This effect is more significant when the\ndensity at the outer boundary is higher. The properties of outflows such as\nvelocity, momentum and energy fluxes, and the ratio of outflow rate and the\naccretion rate, are calculated. We find that the efficiency of transferring the\nradiation power into the kinetic power of outflow is typically $10^{-3}$, far\nbelow the value of $\\sim 0.05$ which is assumed in some cosmological\nsimulations.

Consolidating\nthe confidence levels during cross-correlation studies, understanding the\nartefacts induced by sampling irregularities, establishing detection limits for\nfuture observatories are just some of the applications of simulated data sets.\nCurrently, the widely used methodology of amplitude and phase randomisation is\nable to produce artificial light curves which have a given underlying power\nspectral density (PSD) but which are strictly Gaussian distributed. This\nrestriction is a significant limitation, since the majority of the light curves\ne.g. active galactic nuclei, X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts show strong\ndeviations from Gaussianity exhibiting `burst-like' events in their light\ncurves yielding long-tailed probability distribution functions (PDFs). In this\nstudy we propose a simple method which is able to precisely reproduce light\ncurves which match both the PSD and the PDF of either an observed light curve\nor a theoretical model.

While the\nspectrum, intensity, and angular distribution of this signal is in good\nagreement with predictions from annihilating dark matter, it has also been\nsuggested that a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars could be\nresponsible for this excess GeV emission from the Inner Galaxy. In this paper,\nwe consider this later possibility in detail.

In order to avoid these selection effects, we suggest to\ncalculate pseudo-redshifts for Swift GRBs according to the empirical L-E_p\nrelationship. Here, such a $L-E_p$ relationship is determined by reconciling\nthe distributions of pseudo- and real redshifts of redshift-known GRBs.

We also consider the influence of the star formation density\nthreshold, investigating both a low and high value (0.1 amu/$cm^{3}$ - 100\namu/$cm^{3}$).\n  The Nbody-SPH models that we use to self-consistently form and evolve dwarf\ngalaxies in isolation show that, in the absence of significant angular\nmomentum, metallicity gradients are gradually built up during the evolution of\nthe dwarf galaxy, by ever more centrally concentrated star formation adding to\nthe overall gradient. Once formed, they are robust, survive easily in the\nabsence of external disturbances and hardly decline over several Gyr, and they\nagree well with observed metallicity gradients of dwarf galaxies in the Local\nGroup. The underlying orbital displacement of stars is quite limited in our\nmodels, being of the order of only fractions of the half light radius over\ntime-spans of 5 to 10 Gyr in all star formation schemes.

Often they show\ncoordinated variability at different frequencies, suggesting that in these\ncases the same population of electrons is at work, in a single zone of the jet.\nThe location of this region along the jet is a matter of debate. The jet power\ncorrelates with the mass accretion rate, with jets existing at all values of\ndisk luminosities, measured in Eddington units, sampled so far. The most\npowerful blazars show clear evidence of the emission from their disks, and this\nhas revived methods of finding the black hole mass and accretion rate by\nmodelling a disk spectrum to the data.

The small-scale dynamo can\nconvert the turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic energy and amplify very weak\nprimordial magnetic seed fields on short timescales. The amplification takes\nplace in two phases: in the kinematic phase the magnetic field grows\nexponentially, with the largest growth on the smallest non-resistive scale. In\nthe following non-linear phase the magnetic energy is shifted towards larger\nscales until the dynamo saturates on the turbulent forcing scale. To describe\nthe amplification of the magnetic field quantitatively we model the\nmicrophysics in the interstellar medium (ISM) of young galaxies and determine\nthe growth rate of the small-scale dynamo. We estimate the resulting saturation\nfield strengths and dynamo timescales for two turbulent forcing mechanisms:\naccretion-driven turbulence and SN-driven turbulence.

The source exhibits remarkable spectral\nvariability from months to years timescales. The observed spectral variability\nis entirely due to variations of the column density of a neutral absorber\ntowards the intrinsic nuclear continuum. The column density is generally\nCompton-thin ranging from a few times 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ to a few times\n10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. However, one observation reveals a Compton-thick state\nwith column density of the order of 1.5 $\\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. The\nobserved variability offers a rare opportunity to study the properties of the\nX-ray absorber(s) in an active galaxy. We identify variable X-ray absorption\nfrom two different components, namely (i) a clumpy torus whose individual\nclumps have a density of $\\leq$ 1.7 $\\times$ 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$ and an average\ncolumn density of $\\sim$ 4 $\\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, and (ii) the broad\nline region (BLR), comprising individual clouds with density of 0.1-8 $\\times$\n10$^9$ cm$^{-3}$ and column density of 10$^{23}$-10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. The\nderived properties of the clumpy torus can also be used to estimate the torus\nhalf-opening angle, which is of the order of 47 $^\\circ$. We also confirm the\npreviously reported detection of two highly ionized warm absorbers with outflow\nvelocities of 1000-4000 km s$^{-1}$. The observed outflow velocities are\nconsistent with the Keplerian/escape velocity at the BLR. Hence, the warm\nabsorbers may be tentatively identified with the warm/hot inter-cloud medium\nwhich ensures that the BLR clouds are in pressure equilibrium with their\nsurroundings. The BLR line-emitting clouds may well be the cold, dense clumps\nof this outflow, whose warm/hot phase is likely more homogeneous, as suggested\nby the lack of strong variability of the warm absorber(s) properties during our\nmonitoring. \n\n"}

During the MAGIC\nobservations (February to April 2011) 3C 279 was in a low state in optical,\nX-ray and gamma rays. The MAGIC observations did not yield a significant\ndetection. These upper limits are in agreement with the extrapolation of the HE\ngamma-ray spectrum, corrected for extragalactic background light absorption,\nfrom Fermi-LAT. The second part of the MAGIC observations in 2011 was triggered\nby a high activity state in the optical and gamma-ray bands. During the optical\noutburst the optical electric vector position angle rotatated of about 180\ndegrees. There was no simultaneous rotation of the 43GHz radio polarisation\nangle.

We found that a recently published collection of SNRs in M33 (Long et\nal. 2010, ApJS,187,495) satisfies this requirement if we select the X-ray SNRs\nwith hardness ratios in a limited range of values.

Such a\ncurvature in the short wavelength range cannot be explained either by\nextinction at the host with standard extinction curves, intrinsic curvature of\nafterglow spectra, or by the known systematic uncertainties in the observed\nspectrum. The red damping wing by intervening HI gas outside the host can\nreduce the residual by about 3 sigma statistical significance.

For the time domain, the extent to which radio and visible wavelength\nobservations are required to understand several classes of transients was\nstressed, but there are also classes of radio transients for which no visible\nwavelength counterpart is yet known, providing an opportunity for discovery.\nFrom the LSST perspective, the LSST is expected to generate as many as 1\nmillion alerts nightly, which will require even more selective specification\nand identification of the classes and characteristics of transients that can\nwarrant follow up, at radio or any wavelength. The LSST will also conduct a\ndeep survey of the sky, producing a catalog expected to contain over 38 billion\nobjects in it. Deep radio wavelength sky surveys will also be conducted on a\ncomparable time scale, and radio and visible wavelength observations are part\nof the multi-wavelength approach needed to classify and understand these\nobjects. Radio wavelengths are valuable because they are unaffected by dust\nobscuration and, for galaxies, contain contributions both from star formation\nand from active galactic nuclei. The workshop touched on several other topics,\non which there was consensus including the placement of other LSST \"Deep\nDrilling Fields,\" inter-operability of software tools, and the challenge of\nfiltering and exploiting the LSST data stream. There were also topics for which\nthere was insufficient time for full discussion or for which no consensus was\nreached, which included the procedures for following up on LSST observations\nand the nature for future support of researchers desiring to use LSST data\nproducts. \n\n"}

The\nmechanism powering such events is thought to be linked to tapping of the\nangular momentum (spin) of the black hole, the rate of accretion through the\ndisc or some combination of the two. We can attempt to discriminate between\nthese possibilities by comparing proxies for jet power with spin estimates. Due\nto the small number of sources reaching Eddington rates and have therefore been\nsuggested to act as 'standard candles', there has been much recent debate as to\nwhether a significant correlation exists between jet power and spin. We perform\ncontinuum fitting to the high-quality, disc-dominated XMM-Newton spectra of the\nextragalactic microquasar discovered in M31. Assuming prograde spin, we find\nthat, for sensible constraints the spin is always very low (a < 0.15 at\n3-sigma). When combined with a proxy for jet power derived from the maximum 5\nGHz radio luminosity during a bright flaring event, we find that the source\nsits well above the previously reported, rising correlation that would indicate\nthat spin tapping is the dominant mechanism for powering the jets. The notable\nexceptions require the inclination to be improbably small or the jet to be very\nfast. We investigate whether this could be a by-product of selecting\nprograde-only spin, finding that the data statistically favour a substantially\nretrograde spin for the same constraints (a < -0.17 at 3-sigma). Although\ntheoretically improbable, this remarkable finding could be confirmation that\nretrograde spin can power such jets via spin-tapping, as has been suggested for\ncertain radio quasars. In either case this work demonstrates the value of\nstudying local extragalactic microquasars as a means to better understand the\nphysics of jet launching. \n\n"}

These composite SEDs were previously\nconstructed from the photometric catalogs of the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey, by\nstacking the observed photometry of galaxies that have similar rest-frame\nNUV-to-NIR SEDs. In this work, we include a stacked MIPS 24 micron measurement\nfor each SED type to extend the SEDs to rest-frame MIR wavelengths. Consistent\nwith previous studies, the observed MIR emission for most SED types is higher\nthan expected from only the attenuated stellar emission. We fit the NUV-to-MIR\ncomposite SEDs by the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) models, which\ninclude both stellar and dust emission. We compare the best-fit star formation\nrates (SFRs) to the SFRs based on simple UV+IR estimators. Interestingly, the\nUV and IR luminosities overestimate SFRs - compared to the model SFRs - by more\nthan ~ 1 dex for quiescent galaxies, while for the highest star-forming\ngalaxies in our sample the two SFRs are broadly consistent.

As the inner density profile of\nthe Milky Way's dark matter halo is uncertain, we study the impact of the slope\nof the Galactic density profile, inwards of the Sun, on the prospects for\ndetecting a dark matter signal with CTA. We find that the sensitivity achieved\nby CTA to annihilation signals is strongly dependent on the inner profile\nslope, whereas the dependence is more mild in the case of dark matter decay.\nSurprisingly, we find that the optimal choice of signal and background regions\nis virtually independent of the assumed density profile.

Using a recent compilation of HI and CO data we\nstudy the effects of the cluster on the molecular gas content of spiral\ngalaxies. We first identify M* as the scaling variable that traces the total H2\nmass of galaxies better. We show that, on average, HI-deficient galaxies are\nsignificantly offset from the M(H2) vs. M* relation for HI-normal galaxies. We\nuse the M(H2) vs. M* scaling relation to define the H2-deficiency parameter.\nThis parameter shows a weak and scattered relation with the HI-def, here taken\nas a proxy for galaxy interactions with the cluster environment. We also show\nthat, as for the HI, the extent of the H2 disc decreases with increasing\nHI-deficiency. These results show that cluster galaxies have, on average, a\nlower H2 content than similar objects in the field. The slope of the H2-def vs.\nHI-def relation is less than 1, while the D(HI)/D(i) vs. HI-def relation is\nsteeper than the D(CO)/D(i) vs. HI-def relation, thereby indicating that the H2\ngas is removed less efficiently than the HI. This result can be understood if\nthe HI is distributed on a flat disc more extended than the stellar disc, thus\nless anchored to the gravitational potential well of the galaxy than the H2.\nThere is a clear trend between the NUV-i colour and H2-def, which suggests that\nH2 removal quenches the activity of star formation. This causes galaxies\nmigrate from the blue cloud to the green valley and, eventually, to the red\nsequence. The total gas-consumption timescale of gas deficient cluster galaxies\nis comparable to that of isolated systems, and is significantly larger than the\ntypical timescale for total gas removal in a ram pressure stripping process,\nthus suggesting that ram pressure, rather than starvation, is the dominant\nprocess driving the evolution of these cluster galaxies. \n\n"}

An increasing flux density was observed in radio\nand mm bands from the beginning of 2009, in accordance with the increasing\ngamma-ray activity observed by Fermi-LAT, and peaking on 2011 January 27 in the\nmm regime (230 GHz). We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 4C\n+21.35 for the two periods of the VHE detection and a quiescent state, using a\none-zone model with the emission coming from a very compact region outside the\nbroad line region. The three SEDs can be fit with a combination of synchrotron\nself-Compton and external Compton emission of seed photons from a dust torus,\nchanging only the electron distribution parameters between the epochs. The fit\nof the optical/UV part of the spectrum for 2010 April 29 seems to favor an\ninner disk radius of <6 gravitational radii, as one would expect from a\nprograde-rotating Kerr black hole. \n\n"}

Furthermore, we use long slit high resolution data from\nHIRES/Keck at two different slit positions covering the GRB site, the center of\nthe galaxy and an HII region next to the GRB region. We compare the properties\nof different HII regions in the galaxy with the GRB site and study the global\nand local kinematic properties of this galaxy. The resolved data show that the\nGRB site has the lowest metallicity in the galaxy with around 1/3 Z_solar, but\nits specific SFR (SSFR) of 7.4 M_solar/yr/L/L* and age (determined by the\nHalpha EW) are similar to other HII regions in the host. The galaxy shows a\ngradient in metallicity and SSFR from the bulge to the outskirts as it is\ncommon for spiral galaxies.

We divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20\nclusters based on redshift and central density, performing an X-ray fit to all\nclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of the\ntemperature profile. This approach allows us to constrain the shape of the\ntemperature profile over 0<r<1.5R500, which would be impossible on a\nper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, on\naverage, 2000 X-ray counts. The results presented here represent the first\nconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 to\nz=1.2. We find that high-z (0.6<z<1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler both\nin the inner (r<0.1R500) and outer (r>R500) regions than their low-z\n(0.3<z<0.6) counterparts. Combining the average temperature profile with\nmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the average\npressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. Overall, our observed\npressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,\nsuggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of the\ncore. We find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile at\nr<0.7R500. We observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r>R500 in\nour high-z subsample.

High-resolution radio detections of MBHs are rare. Here we\npresent sensitive, contemporaneous Chandra X-ray, and very long baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI) radio observations with the European VLBI Network (EVN).\nThe source is detected in the X-rays, and shows no long-term variability. If\nthe hard X-ray source is powered by accretion, the apparent low accretion\nefficiency would be consistent with a black hole in the hard state. Hard state\nblack holes are known to show radio emission compact on the milliarcsecond\nscales. However, the central region of NGC 404 is resolved out on 10\nmilliarcsecond (0.15-1.5 pc) scales.

It can be applied even if the Bondi radius is not\nwell-resolved in X-ray observations. This method is based on two simple\nassumptions: (1) hot gas outside the Bondi radius is in nearly a hydrostatic\nequilibrium, and (2) the gas temperature near the galaxy centre is close to the\nvirial temperature. We apply this method to 28 bright elliptical galaxies in\nnearby galaxy clusters (27 of them are the brightest cluster galaxies; BCGs).\nWe find a correlation between the Bondi accretion rates and the power of jets\nassociated with the SMBHs over four orders of magnitude in \\dot M_B.

We also\nfind that more massive SMBHs in BCGs tend to have larger specific growth rates.\nThis may explain the hyper masses (~ 10^10 M_sun) of some of the SMBHs.\nComparison between the accretion rates and the X-ray luminosities of the AGN\nsuggests that the AGN in the BCGs are extremely radiatively inefficient\ncompared with X-ray binaries in the Milky Way, even when their Eddington\naccretion ratio, \\dot M_B/\\dot M_Edd, exceeds 0.01.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation\nmapping and could also be extended to multi-band data. Because the effect\ndescribed above produces a variability pattern in difference light curves\nbetween pairs of lensed images which is correlated with the time-lagged\ncontinuum variability, it can potentially produce systematic errors in\nmeasurement of time delays between pairs of lensed images. Simple simulations\nindicate that time-delay measurement techniques which use a sufficiently\nflexible model for the extrinsic variability are not affected by this effect\nand produce accurate time delays. \n\n"}

The geometrically thick funnel of the inner\nregion of slim disks produces strong self-shadowing effects that lead to very\nstrong anisotropy of the radiation field. We demonstrate that the degree of\nanisotropy of the radiation fields grows with increasing accretion rate. As a\nresult of this anisotropy, BLR clouds receive different spectral energy\ndistributions depending on their location relative to the disk, resulting in\ndiverse observational appearance of the BLR. We show that the self-shadowing of\nthe inner parts of the disk naturally produces two dynamically distinct regions\nof the BLR, depending on accretion rate.

Using the IR\nluminosities due to star formation, we investigate the average SFRs as a\nfunction of redshift and AGN luminosity. In agreement with previous studies, we\nfind a strong evolution of the average SFR with redshift, tracking the observed\nevolution of the overall star forming galaxy population. However, we find that\nthe relationship between the average SFR and AGN luminosity is flat at all\nredshifts and across all the AGN luminosities investigated; in comparison to\nprevious studies, we find less scatter amongst the average SFRs across the wide\nrange of AGN luminosities investigated. By comparing to empirical models, we\nargue that the observed flat relationship is due to short timescale variations\nin AGN luminosity, driven by changes in the mass accretion rate, which wash out\nany underlying correlations between SFR and L(AGN). Furthermore, we show that\nthe exact form of the predicted relationship between SFR and AGN luminosity\n(and it's normalisation) is highly sensitive to the assumed intrinsic Eddington\nratio distribution. \n\n"}

Abstract: The galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) is nearly time-independent\nfor $z < 4$. We therefore construct a time-independent SHMR model for central\ngalaxies, wherein the in-situ star formation rate (SFR) is determined by the\nhalo mass accretion rate (MAR), which we call Stellar-Halo Accretion Rate\nCoevolution (SHARC). We show that the $\\sim0.3$ dex dispersion of the halo MAR\nmatches the observed dispersion of the SFR on the star-formation main sequence\n(MS). In the context of \"bathtub\"-type models of galaxy formation, SHARC leads\nto mass-dependent constraints on the relation between SFR and MAR. Despite its\nsimplicity and the simplified treatment of mass growth from mergers, the SHARC\nmodel is likely to be a good approximation for central galaxies with $M_*=10^9-\n10^{10.5}M_\\odot$ that are on the MS, representing most of the star formation\nin the Universe. SHARC predictions agree with observed SFRs for galaxies on the\nMS at low redshifts, agree fairly well at $z\\sim4$, but exceed observations at\n$z>4$. Assuming that the interstellar gas mass is constant for each galaxy (the\n\"equilibrium condition\" in bathtub models), the SHARC model allows calculation\nof net mass loading factors for inflowing and outflowing gas.

In order to reconcile such\nastrophysical observations for self interaction with particle properties for\nDM, we consider the general scenario of self interacting Dirac fermionic DM,\n$\\chi$. Also since the exact particle physics model for DM is yet to be probed,\nwe simply adopt the effective model independent framework for DM self\ninteraction which occurs via the most general effective 4-fermion operators\ninvariant under both Lorentz and CPT transformations. From the thorough\ninvestigation of the interrelations among the parameters in this framework,\nnamely, the effective DM self couplings ($G_{i}$), DM mass ($m_{\\chi}$) and\nrelative velocity ($v_{\\rm rel}$), it can be inferred that $G_{i}$ decrease\nwith increasing $m_{\\chi}$ for a given DM self interaction strength.

They are a ubiquitous feature of the simulated clouds, which appear\nfrom the beginning of the simulation and are not formed by gradual\nfragmentation of larger filaments. Most of the sub-filaments are\ngravitationally sub-critical and do not fragment into cores, however, there is\nalso a significant fraction of supercritical sub-filaments which break up into\nstar-forming cores. The sub-filaments are coherent along their length, and the\nresidual velocities along their spine show that they are subsonically\ncontracting without any ordered rotation on scales of ~0.1 pc.

The two best-fit models\ndescribe the red galaxy clustering and lensing equally well, but halo quenching\nprovides significantly better fits to the blue galaxies above $10^{11}\nM_\\odot/h^2$.

Because the ISM is turbulent, a given\npatch of ISM exhibits sub-patches with a range of surface densities. The\nhigh-density patches are 'pushed' by feedback, thereby driving turbulence and\nself-regulating local star formation. Sufficiently low-density patches,\nhowever, are accelerated to above the escape velocity before the region can\nself-adjust and are thus vented as outflows. In the\nturbulent-pressure-supported regime, when the gas fraction is $\\gtrsim 0.3$,\nthe ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion to the circular velocity is\nsufficiently high that at any given time, of order half of the ISM has surface\ndensity less than the critical value and thus can be blown out on a dynamical\ntime. The resulting outflows have a mass-loading factor ($\\eta \\equiv M_{\\rm\nout}/M_{\\star}$) that is inversely proportional to the gas fraction times the\ncircular velocity. At low gas fractions, the star formation rate needed for\nlocal self-regulation, and corresponding turbulent Mach number, decline\nrapidly; the ISM is 'smoother', and it is actually more difficult to drive\nwinds with large mass-loading factors. Crucially, our model predicts that\nstellar-feedback-driven outflows should be suppressed at $z \\lesssim 1$ in\n$M_{\\star} \\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ galaxies. This mechanism allows massive\ngalaxies to exhibit violent outflows at high redshifts and then 'shut down'\nthose outflows at late times, thereby enabling the formation of a smooth,\nextended thin stellar disk. We provide simple fitting functions for $\\eta$ that\nshould be useful for sub-resolution and semi-analytic models. [abridged] \n\n"}

Abstract: The origin of cosmic rays is one of the long-standing mysteries in physics\nand astrophysics. Simple arguments suggest that a scenario of supernova\nremnants (SNRs) in the Milky Way as the dominant sources for the cosmic ray\npopulation below the knee could work: in a generic calculation, it can be shown\nthat these objects can provide the energy budget necessary to explain the\nobserved flux of cosmic rays. However, this argument is based on the assumption\nthat all sources behave in the same way, i.e.\\ they all have the same energy\nbudget, spectral behavior and maximum energy. In this paper, we investigate if\na realistic population of SNRs is capable of producing the cosmic ray flux as\nit is observed below the knee. We use 21 SNRs that are well-studied from radio\nwavelengths up to gamma-ray energies. It could be shown previously (Mandelartz\n& Becker Tjus 2015) that the high-energy bump in the energy spectrum of these\n21 sources can be dominated by hadronic emission. Here, gamma-rays are produced\nvia $\\pi^{0}-$decays from cosmic ray interactions in molecular clouds near the\nsupernova remnant, which serves as the cosmic ray accelerator. The cosmic ray\nspectra show a large variety in their energy budget, spectral behavior and\nmaximum energy. These sources are assumed to be representative for the total\nclass of SNRs, where we assume that about 100 - 200 cosmic ray emitting SNRs\nshould be present today. Finally, we use these source spectra to simulate the\ncosmic ray transport from individual SNRs in the Galaxy with the GALPROP code\nfor cosmic ray propagation. We find that the cosmic ray budget can be matched\nwell for a diffusion coefficient that is close to $D\\propto E^{0.3}$. A\nstronger dependence on the energy, e.g. $E^{0.5}$, would lead to a spectrum at\nEarth that is too steep when compared to what is detected and the energy budget\ncannot be matched, in particular toward high energies. \n\n"}

The\nclustering strength of quiescent galaxies exceeds that of star-forming\ngalaxies, implying that quiescent galaxies are preferentially located in more\nmassive halos. When using local density measurement, we find a clear positive\nquiescent fraction--density relation at $z < 1$, consistent with earlier\nresults.

The lower\nfraction of quiescent galaxies seen in large-scale dense environments, if\nconfirmed to be true, may be associated with the fact that the star formation\ncan be more easily sustained via cold stream accretion in `large-scale'\nhigh-density regions, preventing galaxies from permanent quenching.

We first measure the\nstar forming galactic disk sizes, as well as the SFRs of these galaxies, using\ndata from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer, and then show that 1) the\nspecific 0.5-2~keV luminosity of the coronal emission correlates with the\nspecific SFR in a {\\sl sub-linear} fashion: on average, $L_X/L_K \\propto\n(SFR/M_*)^{\\Gamma}$ with $\\Gamma =0.29\\pm0.12$; 2) the efficiency of the\nemission $ L_X/SFR$ decreases with increasing surface SFR ($I_{SFR}$; $\\Gamma =\n-0.44\\pm0.12$); and 3) the characteristic temperature of the X-ray-emitting\nplasma weakly correlates with $I_{SFR}$ ($\\Gamma = 0.08\\pm0.04$).

Mass and spin are the first two\nmultipole moments of the Kerr spacetime and completely determine all\nhigher-order moments. The no-hair theorem and, hence, general relativity can be\ntested by measuring potential deviations from the Kerr metric affecting such\nhigher-order moments. Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is a prime target for precision\ntests of general relativity with several experiments across the electromagnetic\nspectrum. First, near-infrared (NIR) monitoring of stars orbiting around Sgr A*\nwith current and new instruments is expected to resolve their orbital\nprecessions.

In the presence of a rotating bar, these neighbouring\nstream stars experience different bar orientations during pericentric passage\nand hence each star receives a different torque from the bar. These differing\ntorques reshape the angular momentum and energy distribution of stars in the\nstream, which in turn changes the growth rate of the stream. For a progenitor\norbiting in the same sense as the bar's rotation and satisfying a resonance\ncondition, the resultant stream can be substantially shorter or longer than\nexpected, depending on whether the pericentric passages of the progenitor occur\nalong the bar's minor or major axis respectively.

This 'galaxy\nformation efficiency' correlates strongly and with little scatter with halo\nmass, dropping steadily towards dwarf galaxies. The baryonic mass of a galaxy\nmay thus be used to place a lower limit on total halo mass and, consequently,\non its asymptotic maximum circular velocity. A number of observed dwarfs seem\nto violate this constraint, having baryonic masses up to ten times higher than\nexpected from their rotation speeds, or, alternatively, rotating at only half\nthe speed expected for their mass. Taking the data at face value, either these\nsystems have formed galaxies with extraordinary efficiency - highly unlikely\ngiven their shallow potential wells - or their dark matter content is much\nlower than expected from {\\Lambda}CDM haloes. This 'missing dark matter' is\nreminiscent of the inner mass deficit of galaxies with slowly-rising rotation\ncurves, but cannot be explained away by star formation-induced 'cores' in the\ndark mass profile, since the anomalous deficit applies to regions larger than\nthe luminous galaxies themselves.

The TeV blazar Mrk 501 is one of the best targets among BL Lac objects\nfor studying the nature of off-axis jet structures because it shows different\njet position angles at different scales. The aim of this study is to\ninvestigate the properties of the off-axis jet structure through\nhigh-resolution mm-VLBI images at the jet base and physical parameters such as\nkinematics, flux densities, and spectral indices.

The Predicted Radio Emission Abstract: Accretion discs in AGN may be associated with coronal gas, as suggested by\ntheir X-ray emission. Stellar coronal emission includes radio emission, and AGN\ncorona may also be a significant source for radio emission in radio quiet (RQ)\nAGN. We calculate the coronal properties required to produce the observed radio\nemission in RQ AGN, either from synchrotron emission of power-law (PL)\nelectrons, or from cyclo-synchrotron emission of hot mildly-relativistic\nthermal electrons. We find that a flat spectrum, as observed in about half of\nRQ AGN, can be produced by corona with a disc or a spherical configuration,\nwhich extends from the innermost regions out to a pc scale. A spectral break to\nan optically thin power-law emission is expected around 300-1000 GHz, as the\ninnermost corona becomes optically thin. In case of thermal electrons, a sharp\nspectral cutoff is expected above the break. The position of the break can be\nmeasured with VLBI observations, which exclude the cold dust emission, and it\ncan be used to probe the properties of the innermost corona. Assuming\nequipartition of the coronal thermal energy density, the PL electrons energy\ndensity, and the magnetic field, we find that the energy density in a disc\ncorona should scale as $\\sim R^{-1.3}$, to get a flat spectrum.

Grain shape and\nstructure effects are considered, as well as 30 CR elemental constituents with\nan updated energy spectrum corresponding to a translucent cloud with $A_V=2$\nmag. Energy deposition by CRs in grain material was calculated with the SRIM\nprogram. We report full $T_{\\rm CR}$ spectra for all nine grain types and\nconsider initial grain temperatures of 10 K and 20 K. We also provide\nfrequencies for a range of minimum $T_{\\rm CR}$ values. The calculated dataset\ncan be simply and flexibly implemented in astrochemical models. The results\nshow that, in the case of translucent clouds, the currently adopted rate for\nheating of whole grains to temperatures in excess of 70 K is underestimated by\napproximately two orders of magnitude in astrochemical numerical simulations.\nAdditionally, grains are heated by CRs to modest temperatures (20--30 K) with\nintervals of a few years, which reduces the possibility of ice chemical\nexplosions. \n\n"}

The goal of this study is to aid the interpretation of spectroscopic\nsearches for binaries and help test one of the leading models of binary\naccretion flows in the literature: SBHB in a circumbinary disk. In this work we\npresent the methodology and a comparison of the preliminary model with the\ndata. We model SBHB accretion flows as a set of three accretion disks: two\nmini-disks that are gravitationally bound to the individual black holes and a\ncircumbinary disk. Given a physically motivated parameter space occupied by\nsub-parsec SBHBs, we calculate a synthetic database of nearly 15 million broad\noptical emission line profiles and explore the dependence of the profile shapes\non characteristic properties of SBHBs. We find that the modeled profiles show\ndistinct statistical properties as a function of the semi-major axis, mass\nratio, eccentricity of the binary, and the degree of alignment of the triple\ndisk system. This suggests that the broad emission line profiles from SBHB\nsystems can in principle be used to infer the distribution of these parameters\nand as such merit further investigation. Calculated profiles are more\nmorphologically heterogeneous than the broad emission lines in observed SBHB\ncandidates and we discuss improved treatment of radiative transfer effects\nwhich will allow direct statistical comparison of the two groups. \n\n"}

However, all three parameters are\nsusceptible to biases that might affect the observed strength of the relation\nbetween them. We analyze possible sources of systematic error, including sample\nbias, application of signal-to-noise ratio cuts on emission lines, choice of\nmetallicity calibration, uncertainty in stellar mass determination, aperture\neffects, and dust. We present the first analysis of the relation between\nstellar mass, gas phase metallicity, and SFR using strong line abundance\ndiagnostics from Dopita et al.

Using these abundance diagnostics yields a 30-55% weaker\nanti-correlation between metallicity and SFR at fixed stellar mass than that\nreported by Mannucci et al. (2010).

We want to measure the LyC signal from a sample\nof sources in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) and COSMOS fields for which\nultra-deep VIMOS spectroscopy as well as multi-wavelength Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) imaging are available.\n  We select a sample of 46 galaxies at $z\\sim 4$ from the VIMOS Ultra Deep\nSurvey (VUDS) database, such that the VUDS spectra contain the LyC part of the\nspectra, that is, the rest-frame range $880-910\\AA$.

We first show, by\nmeans of pure N-body simulations, that initially co-spatial stellar populations\nwith different in-plane random motions separate when a bar forms. The radially\ncooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and\npeanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a\nvertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,\nvelocity dispersion that dominates this evolution. Assuming that early stellar\ndiscs heat rapidly as they form, then both the in-plane and vertical random\nmotions correlate with stellar age and chemistry, leading to different density\ndistributions for metal-rich and metal-poor stars. We then use a\nhigh-resolution simulation, in which all stars form out of gas, to demonstrate\nthat this is what happens. When we apply these results to the Milky Way we show\nthat a very broad range of observed trends for ages, densities, kinematics and\nchemistries, that have been presented as evidence for contradictory paths to\nthe formation of the bulge, are in fact consistent with a bulge which formed\nfrom a continuum of disc stellar populations which were kinematically separated\nby the bar.

Abstract: Supermassive stars (SMS; ~ 10^5 M_sun) formed from metal-free gas in the\nearly Universe attract attention as progenitors of supermassive black holes\nobserved at high redshifts. To form SMSs by accretion, central protostars must\naccrete at as high rates as ~ 0.1-1 M_sun/yr. Such protostars have very\nextended structures with bloated envelopes, like super-giant stars, and are\ncalled super-giant protostars (SGPSs). Under the assumption of hydrostatic\nequilibrium, SGPSs have density inverted layers, where the luminosity becomes\nlocally super-Eddington, near the surface. If the envelope matter is allowed to\nflow out, however, a stellar wind could be launched and hinder the accretion\ngrowth of SGPSs before reaching the supermassive regime. We examine whether\nradiation-driven winds are launched from SGPSs by constructing steady and\nspherically symmetric wind solutions. We find that the wind velocity does not\nreach the escape velocity in any case considered. This is because once the\ntemperature falls below ~ 10^4 K, the opacity plummet drastically owing to the\nrecombination of hydrogen and the acceleration ceases suddenly. This indicates\nthat, in realistic non-steady cases, even if outflows are launched from the\nsurface of SGPSs, they would fall back again. Such a \"wind\" does not result in\nnet mass loss and does not prevent the growth of SGPSs. In conclusion, SGPSs\nwill grow to SMSs and eventually collapse to massive BHs of ~ 10^5 M_sun, as\nlong as the rapid accretion is maintained. \n\n"}

We calculate\nconstraints on the DM parameter space for both attenuated and idealized spikes,\nconsidering different choices for the steepness profiles in each case.

For more optimistic choices of parameters corresponding to spikes\nthat have not been attenuated, bounds on DM masses can be obtained for a\nvariety of choices of steepness profiles.

At a\nfixed stellar mass, galaxies with higher $D_n4000$ have larger velocity\ndispersions and smaller sizes. $D_n4000$ is a proxy for stellar population age,\nthus these trends suggest that older galaxies typically have larger velocity\ndispersions and smaller sizes. We combine velocity dispersion and size into a\ndynamical mass estimator, $\\sigma^2 R$. At a fixed stellar mass, $\\sigma^2 R$\ndepends on $D_n4000$. The S\\'ersic index is also correlated with $D_n4000$. The\ndependence of $\\sigma^2 R$ and S\\'ersic index on $D_n4000$ suggests that\nquiescent galaxies are not structurally homologous systems.

Another technique uses accretion disk models to fit\nthe AGN continuum emission (the continuum-fitting, or CF, method). Although\neach technique has model-dependent uncertainties, these are the best empirical\ntools currently available and should be vetted in systems where both techniques\ncan be applied. A detailed comparison of the two methods is also useful because\nneither method can be applied to all AGN. The X-ray reflection technique\ntargets mostly local (z $\\lesssim$ 0.1) systems, while the CF method can be\napplied at higher redshift, up to and beyond the peak of AGN activity and\ngrowth.

We dub our method LIGER, short for `light cones with general\nrelativity'. LIGER takes a (N-body or hydrodynamic) Newtonian simulation as an\ninput and outputs the distribution of galaxies in comoving redshift space. This\nresult is achieved making use of a coordinate transformation and simultaneously\naccounting for lensing magnification. The calculation includes both local\ncorrections and terms that have been integrated along the line of sight. Our\nfast implementation allows the production of many realizations that can be used\nto forecast the performance of forthcoming wide-angle surveys and to estimate\nthe covariance matrix of the observables. To facilitate this use, we also\npresent a variant of LIGER designed for large-volume simulations with low mass\nresolution. In this case, the galaxy distribution on large scales is obtained\nby biasing the matter-density field. Finally, we present two sample\napplications of LIGER. First, we discuss the impact of weak gravitational\nlensing onto the angular clustering of galaxies in a Euclid-like survey.

Our sample-mean BHARs are derived from the\n$Chandra$ Deep Field-South 7 Ms observations, while the SFRs and $M_*$ have\nbeen estimated by the CANDELS team through SED fitting. The average BHAR is\ncorrelated positively with both SFR and $M_*$, and the BHAR-SFR and BHAR-$M_*$\nrelations can both be described acceptably by linear models with a slope of\nunity. However, BHAR appears to be correlated more strongly with $M_*$ than\nSFR. This result indicates that $M_*$ is the primary host-galaxy property\nrelated to black-hole growth, and the apparent BHAR-SFR relation is largely a\nsecondary effect due to the star-forming main sequence. Among our sources,\nmassive galaxies ($M_* \\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$) have significantly higher\nBHAR/SFR ratios than less-massive galaxies, indicating the former have higher\nblack-hole fueling efficiency and/or higher SMBH occupation fraction than the\nlatter.

However, how AGN jets heat and suppress cooling flows\nremains highly debated. Using an idealized simulation of a cool-core cluster,\nwe study the development of central cooling catastrophe and how a subsequent\npowerful AGN jet event averts cooling flows, with a focus on complex\ngasdynamical processes involved. We find that the jet drives a bow shock, which\nreverses cooling inflows and overheats inner cool core regions. The shocked gas\nmoves outward in a rarefaction wave, which rarefies the dense core and\nadiabatically transports a significant fraction of heated energy to outer\nregions. As the rarefaction wave propagates away, inflows resume in the cluster\ncore, but a trailing outflow is uplifted by the AGN bubble, preventing gas\naccumulation and catastrophic cooling in central regions. Inflows and trailing\noutflows constitute meridional circulations in the cluster core. At later\ntimes, trailing outflows fall back to the cluster centre, triggering central\ncooling catastrophe and potentially a new generation of AGN feedback. We thus\nenvisage a picture of cool cluster cores going through cycles of\ncooling-induced contraction and AGN-induced expansion. This picture naturally\npredicts an anti-correlation between the gas fraction (or X-ray luminosity) of\ncool cores and the central gas entropy, which may be tested by X-ray\nobservations. \n\n"}

We calculate both effects in a hard-edged beaming model where each\nsource has a random orientation, using an equilibrium Boltzmann hierarchy in\nterms of spherical harmonics.

The stripped gas\nis more turbulent, with velocity dispersions up to > 100 km/s}, and is excited\nby shocks as traced by high values of [OI]/H$\\alpha$ and [NII]/H$\\alpha$ ratio.\nIn the tail of UGC 6697 we identify numerous bright compact knots with line\nratios typical of HII regions.

It turns out that the resultant total density profiles (baryons plus\nCDM), for halos with mass ranges from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters, can\nmatch the observations of the rotation curves better than NFW profile.

It is often assumed that only very\nfew elemental abundances can be measured from such low-resolution spectra,\nlimiting their utility for Galactic archaeology studies. However, Ting et al.\n(2017) used ab initio models to argue that low-resolution spectra should enable\nprecision measurements of many elemental abundances, at least in theory. Here\nwe verify this claim in practice by measuring the relative abundances of 14\nelements from LAMOST spectra with a precision of $\\lesssim$ 0.1 dex for objects\nwith ${\\rm S/N}_{\\rm LAMOST}$ > 30 (per pixel). We employ a spectral modeling\nmethod in which a data-driven model is combined with priors that the model\ngradient spectra should resemble ab initio spectral models.

Our analysis is constrained to the\nnumber of elemental abundances measured in the APOGEE survey, which is the\nsource of the training labels. Obtaining high quality/resolution spectra for a\nsubset of LAMOST stars to measure more elemental abundances as training labels\nand then applying this method to the full LAMOST catalog will provide a sample\nwith more than 20 elemental abundances that is an order of magnitude larger\nthan current high-resolution surveys, substantially increasing the sample size\nfor Galactic archaeology. \n\n"}

The central regions of the host have a higher metallicity, lower\nspecific star-formation rate and lower ionization. Modeling the stellar\npopulations gives a different picture: The SLSN region has two dominant stellar\npopulations with different ages, the youngest one with an age of 2-10 Myr and\nlower metallicity, likely the population from which the SN progenitor\noriginated. Emission line kinematics of NGC 3191 show indications of\ninteraction with its neighbour MCG+08-19-017 at $\\sim$45 kpc, which might be\nresponsible for the recent starburst.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the demographics of dark matter (DM) substructure is of\nparamount importance for many fields of astrophysics, including gravitational\nlensing, galaxy evolution, halo occupation modeling, and constraining the\nnature of dark matter. Because of its strongly non-linear nature, DM\nsubstructure is typically modeled using N-body simulations, which reveal that\nlarge fractions of DM subhaloes undergo complete disruption. In this paper we\nuse both analytical estimates and idealized numerical simulations to\ninvestigate whether this disruption is mainly physical, due to tidal heating\nand stripping, or numerical (i.e., artificial). We show that, contrary to naive\nexpectation, subhaloes that experience a tidal shock $\\Delta E$ that exceeds\nthe subhalo's binding energy, $|E_{\\rm b}|$, do not undergo disruption, even\nwhen $\\Delta E/|E_{\\rm b}|$ is as large as 100. Along the same line, and\ncontrary to existing claims in the literature, instantaneously stripping matter\nfrom the outskirts of a DM subhalo also does not result in its complete\ndisruption, even when the instantaneous remnant has positive binding energy. In\naddition, we show that tidal heating due to high-speed (impulsive) encounters\nwith other subhaloes (`harassment'), is negligible compared to the tidal\neffects due to the host halo. Hence, we conclude that, in the absence of\nbaryonic processes, the complete, physical disruption of CDM substructure is\nextremely rare, and that most disruption in numerical simulations therefore\nmust be artificial. We discuss various processes that have been associated with\nnumerical overmerging, and conclude that inadequate force-softening is the most\nlikely culprit. \n\n"}

Our\ninvestigation specifically focuses on how well various Chandrasekhar-based\ndynamical friction models can predict the orbital decay of kicked black holes\nwith $m_{bh} \\lesssim 100 M_\\odot$ due to an inhomogeneous background stellar\nfield. In general, the orbital evolution of a kicked black hole follows that of\na damped oscillator where two-body encounters and dynamical friction serve as\nsources of damping.

We demonstrate that a ULX with\nLx~10^40-10^41 erg/s (isotropic-equivalent luminosity in the 0.1-10 keV energy\nband) shining for ~10^5 years (the expected duration of a supercritically\naccreting phase in HMXBs) can significantly ionise the ISM in its host dwarf\ngalaxy of total mass M~10^7-10^8 Msun and thereby reduce its opacity to soft\nX-rays. As a result, the fraction of the soft X-ray (below 1 keV) radiation\nfrom the ULX escaping into the intergalactic medium (IGM) can increase from\n~20-50% to ~30-80% over its lifetime. This implies that HMXBs can induce a\nstronger heating of the IGM at z>10 compared to estimates neglecting the ULX\nfeedback on the ISM. However, larger galaxies with M>3 x 10^8 Msun could not be\nsignificantly ionised even by the brightest ULXs in the early Universe.

The case\n  of electron scattering Abstract: Bow shocks and related density enhancements produced by the winds of massive\nstars moving through the interstellar medium provide important information\nregarding the motions of the stars, the properties of their stellar winds, and\nthe characteristics of the local medium. Since bow shocks are aspherical\nstructures, light scattering within them produces a net polarization signal\neven if the region is spatially unresolved. Scattering opacity arising from\nfree electrons and dust leads to a distribution of polarized intensity across\nthe bow shock structure. That polarization encodes information about the shape,\ncomposition, opacity, density, and ionisation state of the material within the\nstructure. In this paper we use the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SLIP to\ninvestigate the polarization created when photons scatter in a bow shock-shaped\nregion of enhanced density surrounding a stellar source. We present results\nassuming electron scattering, and investigate the polarization behaviour as a\nfunction of optical depth, temperature, and source of photons for two different\ncases: pure scattering and scattering with absorption. In both regimes we\nconsider resolved and unresolved cases. We discuss the implication of these\nresults as well as their possible use along with observational data to\nconstrain the properties of observed bow shock systems. In different situations\nand under certain assumptions, our simulations can constrain viewing angle,\noptical depth and temperature of the scattering region, and the relative\nluminosities of the star and shock. \n\n"}

The fraction of\nred (quiescent) galaxies, whether in groups or isolated, increases with both\nstellar mass and large-scale (5 Mpc) density. At fixed stellar mass, the red\nfraction is on average higher for satellites of red centrals than of blue\n(star-forming) centrals, a galactic conformity effect that increases with\ndensity. Most of the signal originates from groups that have the highest\nstellar mass, reside in the densest environments, and have massive, red only\ncentrals. Assuming a color-dependent halo-to-stellar-mass ratio, whereby red\ncentral galaxies inhabit significantly more massive halos than blue ones of the\nsame stellar mass, two regimes emerge more distinctly: at log(Mhalo/Msol) < 13,\ncentral quenching is still ongoing, conformity is no longer existent, and\nsatellites and group centrals exhibit the same quenching excess over field\ngalaxies at all mass and density, in agreement with the concept of \"group\nquenching\"; at log(Mhalo/Msol) > 13, a cutoff that sets apart massive\n(log(M*/Msol) > 11), fully quenched group centrals, conformity is meaningless,\nand satellites undergo significantly more quenching than their counterparts in\nsmaller halos. The latter effect strongly increases with density, giving rise\nto the density-dependent conformity signal when both regimes are mixed. The\nstar-formation of blue satellites in massive halos is also suppressed compared\nto blue field galaxies, while blue group centrals and the majority of blue\nsatellites, which reside in low mass halos, show no deviation from the\ncolor-stellar mass relation of blue field galaxies. \n\n"}

The main insight from this study is\nthat LTG bulges form a continuous sequence of increasing dmB with increasing\nM*T, M*B, stellar mass surface density S* and mass-weighted age and\nmetallicity: high-dmB bulges are the oldest, densest and most massive ones, and\nvice versa. Furthermore, we find that the bulge-to-disk age and metallicity\ncontrast, as well as the bulge-to-disk mass ratio increase with M*T, raising\nfrom, respectively, ~0 Gyr, 0 dex and 0.25 to ~3 Gyr, ~0.3 dex and 0.67 across\nthe mass range covered by our sample. Whereas gas excitation in lower-mass\nbulges is invariably dominated by star formation (SF), LINER- and\nSeyfert-specific emission-line ratios were exclusively documented in high-mass,\nhigh-S* bulges. The continuity both in the properties of LTG bulges themselves\nand in their age and metallicity contrast to their parent disks suggests that\nthese components evolve alongside in a concurrent process that leads to a\ncontinuum of physical and evolutionary characteristics. Our results are\nconsistent with a picture where bulge growth in LTGs is driven by a\nsuperposition of quick-early and slow-secular processes, the relative\nimportance of which increases with M*T. These processes, which presumably\ncombine in situ SF in the bulge and inward migration of material from the disk,\nare expected to lead to a non-homologous radial growth of S* and a trend for an\nincreasing Sersic index with increasing galaxy mass. \n\n"}

Unlike most other\nwork, we use a model-free approach based on the relative polar image angles of\nquads, and their position in 3D space with respect to the Fundamental Surface\nof Quads. The FSQ is defined by quads produced by elliptical lenses. We have\ngenerated thousands of quads from synthetic populations of lenses with\nsubstructure consistent with $\\Lambda$CDM simulations, and found that such\nperturbations are not sufficient to match the observed distribution of quads\nrelative to the FSQ. The result is unchanged even when subhalo masses are\nincreased by a factor of ten, and the most optimistic lensing selection bias is\napplied. We then produce quads from galaxies created using two components,\nrepresenting baryons and dark matter. The transition from the mass being\ndominated by baryons in inner radii to being dominated by dark matter in outer\nradii can carry with it asymmetries, which would affect relative image angles.\nWe run preliminary experiments using lenses with two elliptical mass components\nwith nonidentical axis ratios and position angles, perturbations from\nellipticity in the form of nonzero Fourier coefficients $a_4$ and $a_6$, and\nartificially offset ellipse centers as a proxy for asymmetry at image radii.

In this work, we investigate how a precision measurement of\nthe electron magnetic moment places meaningful constraints on both chameleons\nand symmetrons. Two effects are identified: First, virtual chameleons and\nsymmetrons run in loops to generate quantum corrections to the intrinsic value\nof the magnetic moment; a common process widely considered in the literature\nfor many scenarios beyond the Standard Model. A second effect, however, is\nunique to scalar fields that exhibit screening. A scalar bubblelike profile\nforms inside the experimental vacuum chamber and exerts a fifth force on the\nelectron, leading to a systematic shift in the experimental measurement. In\nquantifying this latter effect, we present a novel approach that combines\nanalytic arguments and a small number of numerical simulations to solve for the\nbubblelike profile quickly for a large range of model parameters. Taken\ntogether, both effects yield interesting constraints in complementary regions\nof parameter space. While the constraints we obtain for the chameleon are\nlargely uncompetitive with those in the existing literature, this still\nrepresents the tightest constraint achievable yet from an experiment not\noriginally designed to search for fifth forces. We break more ground with the\nsymmetron, for which our results exclude a large and previously unexplored\nregion of parameter space.

By means of high-resolution two-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we study the three feedback effects (the stellar wind heating, SNe\nfeedback, and AGN feedback) in suppressing star formation activities on the\nevolution of early-type galaxies with different stellar masses. AGN feedback\nmodels are updated based on \\citet{Yuan2018}. The gas sources comes exclusively\nfrom the mass losses of dying low-mass stars for most of our models. We find\nthat SNe feedback can keep star formation at a significantly low level for low\nmass elliptical galaxies for a cosmological evolution time. For the high mass\ngalaxies, AGN feedback can efficiently offset the radiative cooling and thus\nregulate the star formation activities.

Hydrodynamical simulations undertaken to explore our scenario show\nthat supermassive, gravitationally bound gaseous disks, weighing a billion\nsolar masses and of a few pc in size, form in the nuclei of merger remnants in\nless than $10^5$ yr.

Stellar photometry, therefore,\nprovides an economical method to obtain intrinsic stellar parameters. With the\naddition of distance information - deriving reliable ages from photometry is a\npossibility. We have developed a Bayesian method that generates 2D probability\nmaps of a star's age and metallicity from photometry and parallax using\nisochrones. Our synthetic tests show that including a near-UV passband enables\nus to break the degeneracy between a star's age and metallicity for certain\nevolutionary stages. It is possible to find well-constrained ages and\nmetallicities for turn-off and sub-giant stars with colours including a U band\nand a parallax with uncertainty less than ~20%. Metallicities alone are\npossible for the main sequence and giant branch. We find good agreement with\nthe literature when we apply our method to the Gaia benchmark stars,\nparticularly for turn-off and young stars. Further tests on the old open\ncluster NGC 188, however, reveal significant limitations in the stellar\nisochrones. The ages derived for the cluster stars vary with evolutionary\nstage, such that turn-off ages disagree with those on the sub-giant branch, and\nmetallicities vary significantly throughout. Furthermore, the parameters vary\nappreciably depending on which colour combinations are used in the derivation.\nWe identify the causes of these mismatches and show that improvements are\nneeded in the modelling of giant branch stars and in the creation and\ncalibration of synthetic near-UV photometry. Our results warn against applying\nisochrone fitting indiscriminately. In particular, the uncertainty on the\nstellar models should be quantitatively taken into account. Further efforts to\nimprove the models will result in significant advancements in our ability to\nstudy the Galaxy. \n\n"}

The CO\nobservation shows that the SNR delineated by the radio emission is projectively\ncovered by a molecular cloud (MC) complex at V$_{\\rm {LSR}}$ = $-60$ to $-54$\nkm s$^{-1}$. Both the symmetric axis of the radio emission and the trailing\nX-ray PWN appear projectively to be along a gap between two molecular gas\npatches at $-58$ to $-57$ km s$^{-1}$. Asymmetric broad profiles of $^{12}$CO\nlines peaked at $-58$ km s$^{-1}$ are found at the eastern and southwestern\nedges of the radio emission. This represents a kinematic signature consistent\nwith an SNR-MC interaction.

Spinning dust is one variety of AME that\ncould be partially polarized and therefore relevant for ongoing and future\ncosmic microwave background polarization studies. The Planck satellite mission\nidentified candidate AME regions in approximately $1^\\circ$ patches that were\nfound to have spectra generally consistent with spinning dust grain models. The\nspectra for one of these regions, G107.2+5.2, was also consistent with\noptically thick free-free emission because of a lack of measurements between 2\nand 20 GHz. Follow-up observations were needed. Therefore, we used the C-band\nreceiver (4 to 8 GHz) and the VEGAS spectrometer at the Green Bank Telescope to\nconstrain the AME mechanism. For the study described in this paper, we produced\nthree band averaged maps at 4.575, 5.625, and 6.125 GHz and used aperture\nphotometry to measure the spectral flux density in the region relative to the\nbackground. We found if the spinning dust description is correct, then the\nspinning dust signal peaks at $30.9 \\pm 1.4$ GHz, and it explains the excess\nemission. The morphology and spectrum together suggest the spinning dust grains\nare concentrated near S140, which is a star forming region inside our chosen\nphotometry aperture.

If confirmed, one\nimplication is that the spin temperature of the 21 cm line is coupled to the\ngas temperature by z=20. The known mechanism for accomplishing this is the\nWouthuysen-Field effect, whereby Lyman-alpha photons scatter in the\nintergalactic medium (IGM) and impact the hyperfine level populations. This\nsuggests that early star formation had already produced a copious Lyman-alpha\nbackground by z=20, and strongly constrains models in which the linear matter\npower spectrum is suppressed on small-scales, since halo and star formation are\ndelayed in such scenarios. Here we consider the case that the dark matter\nconsists of ultra-light axions with macroscopic de Broglie wavelengths (fuzzy\ndark matter, FDM). We assume that star formation tracks halo formation and\nadopt two simple models from the current literature for the halo mass function\nin FDM. We further suppose that the fraction of halo baryons which form stars\nis less than a conservative upper limit of $f_\\star \\leq 0.05$, and that ~10^4\nLyman-alpha to Lyman-limit photons are produced per stellar baryon.

The constraint is insensitive to the precise\nminimum mass of halos where stars form. As the global 21 cm measurements are\nrefined, the coupling redshift could change and we quantify how the FDM\nconstraint would be modified. A rough translation of the FDM mass bound to a\nthermal relic warm dark matter (WDM) mass bound is also provided. \n\n"}

The spin parameter value of the gas component is higher than in\nthe no stream velocity case, which even in the absence of cooling, may result\nin more prolate objects. We also generalize the spin parameter to the SIGOs and\nfind that they typically have a larger spin parameter with respect to their\ndark matter counterparts and that there is no correlation of the spin parameter\nand the prolateness of such structures.

The Pal 5 stream is one such system for which we have some of the\nbest data.

While radio bubbles inflated by AGN jets\ncould be dynamically supported by cosmic rays (CRs), the impact of CR-dominated\njets are not well understood. In this work, we perform three-dimensional\nsimulations of CR-jet feedback in an isolated cluster atmosphere; we find that\nCR jets impact the multiphase gas differently than jets dominated by kinetic\nenergy. In particular, CR bubbles can more efficiently uplift the cluster gas\nand cause an outward expansion of the hot ICM. Due to adiabatic cooling from\nthe expansion and less efficient heating from CR bubbles by direct mixing, the\nICM is more prone to local thermal instabilities, which will later enhance\nchaotic cold accretion onto the AGN.

The most promising explanation for\nthis obesity is that the BH-BH merger occurred at low metallicity (Z): when the\niron (Fe) contents is lower this is expected to result in weaker mass loss\nduring the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase. We therefore critically evaluate the claims\nfor the reasons of heavy BHs as a function of Z in the literature. Furthermore,\nweaker stellar winds might lead to more rapid stellar rotation, allowing WR and\nBH progenitor evolution in a chemically homogeneous manner. However, there is\nas yet no empirical evidence for more rapid rotation amongst WR stars in the\nlow Z environment of the Magellanic Clouds.

This process can repeat several times and lead to\nsignificant mass growth. In this paper, we calculate the mass of the largest BH\nthat can be formed through repeated mergers of stellar seed BHs and determine\nhow its value depends on the physical properties of the host cluster. We adopt\nan analytical model in which the energy generated by the black hole binaries in\nthe cluster core is assumed to be regulated by the process of two-body\nrelaxation in the bulk of the system. This principle is used to compute the\nhardening rate of the binaries and to relate this to the time-dependent global\nproperties of the parent cluster.

We modeled in a similar way the UV plane defined by\nthe Mg II line and Fe II UV pseudo-continuum, but here our approach is less\nsuccessful, in general overproducing the Fe II strength. We found that the Fe\nII optical and UV emissivity depend in a different way on the turbulent\nvelocity and metallicity, and the best extension of the model in order to cover\nboth planes is to allow very large turbulent velocities in the Broad Line\nRegion clouds. \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.03332", "contents": "Title: Type Ibn Supernovae May not all Come from Massive Stars Abstract: Because core-collapse supernovae are the explosions of massive stars, which\nhave relatively short lifetimes, they occur almost exclusively in galaxies with\nactive star formation. On the other hand, the Type Ibn supernova PS1-12sk\nexploded in an environment much more typical of thermonuclear (Type Ia)\nsupernovae: on the outskirts of the brightest elliptical galaxy in a galaxy\ncluster. The lack of any obvious star formation at that location presented a\nchallenge to models of Type Ibn supernovae as the explosions of very massive\nWolf-Rayet stars. Here we present a supplementary search for star formation at\nthe site of PS1-12sk, now that the supernova has faded, via deep ultraviolet\nimaging of the host cluster with the Hubble Space Telescope. We do not detect\nany ultraviolet emission within 1 kpc of the supernova location, which allows\nus deepen the limit on star formation rate by an order of magnitude compared to\nthe original study on this event. In light of this new limit, we discuss\nwhether the progenitors of Type Ibn supernovae can be massive stars and what\nreasonable alternatives have been proposed. \n\n"}

By using the new observed\nradio data of the Andromeda galaxy, we rule out the existence of $\\sim 100-300$\nGeV thermal relic annihilating dark matter for ten annihilation channels. The\nlower limits of annihilating dark matter mass are improved to larger than 330\nGeV for the most conservative case, which is a few times larger than the\ncurrent best constraints. Moreover, these limits strongly disfavor the\nbenchmark model of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) produced through\nthe thermal freeze-out mechanism. \n\n"}

We derived accurate stellar ages for the cluster NGC6530,\nassociated with the Lagoon Nebula to infer its SF history. We use the Gaia-ESO\nsurvey observations and Gaia DR2 data, to derive cluster membership and\nfundamental stellar parameters. We identified 652 confirmed and 9 probable\nmembers. The reddening inferred for members and non-members allows us to\ndistinguish MS stars and giants, in agreement with the distances inferred from\nGaia DR2 data. The foreground and background stars show a spatial pattern that\ntraces the 3D structure of the nebular dust component. We derive stellar ages\nfor 382 confirmed cluster members and we find that the gravity-sensitive gamma\nindex distribution for M stars is correlated with stellar age. For all members\nwith Teff<5500 K, the mean logarithmic age is 5.84 (units of years) with a\ndispersion of 0.36 dex. The age distribution of stars with accretion and/or\ndisk (CTTSe) is similar to that of stars without accretion and without disk\n(WTTSp). We interpret this dispersion as evidence of a real age spread since\nthe total uncertainties on age determinations, derived from Monte Carlo\nsimulations, are significantly smaller than the observed spread. This\nconclusion is supported by the evidence of a decreasing of the\ngravity-sensitive gamma index as a function of stellar ages. The presence of\nthe age spread is also supported by the spatial distribution and the kinematics\nof old and young members. In particular, members with accretion and/or disk,\nformed in the last 1 Myr, show evidence of subclustering around the cluster\ncenter, in the Hourglass Nebula and in the M8-E region, suggesting a possible\ntriggering of star formation events by the O-type star ionization fronts. \n\n"}
