Much of this\nexcitement has centred on the claim that a certain class of quantum dimer\nmodel, defined on a bipartite lattice, can support a quantum U(1)-liquid phase\nwith deconfined fractional excitations in three dimensions. These fractional\nmonomer excitations are quantum analogues of the magnetic monopoles found in\nspin ice. In this article we use extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations to\nestablish the ground-state phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on the\nthree-dimensional, bipartite, diamond lattice as a function of the ratio {\\mu}\nof the potential to kinetic energy terms in the Hamiltonian. We find that, for\n{\\mu}_c = 0.75 +/- 0.04, the model undergoes a first-order quantum phase\ntransition from an ordered \"R-state\" into an extended quantum U(1)-liquid\nphase, which terminates in a quantum critical \"RK point\" for {\\mu}=1.

However,\nDRMG suffers from inherent accuracy restrictions when multiple states are\ninvolved due to multi-state targeting and also the approximate representation\nof the Hamiltonian and other operators. By formulating the variational approach\nof DMRG explicitly for MPSs one can avoid errors inherent in the multi-state\ntargeting approach. Furthermore, by using the Matrix Product Operator (MPO)\nformalism, one can exactly represent the Hamiltonian and other operators. The\nMPO approach allows 1D Hamiltonians to be templated using a small set of finite\nstate automaton rules without reference to the particular microscopic degrees\nof freedom. We present two algorithms which take advantage of these properties:\neMPS to find excited states of 1D Hamiltonians and tMPS for the time evolution\nof a generic time-dependent 1D Hamiltonian.

While there are empirical\nsuggestions of particular increasing length scales that accompany such\ntransitions, this identification is not universal. To better understand such\nbehavior in quantum systems, we extend a known mapping (earlier studied in\nstochastic, or supersymmetric, quantum mechanics) between finite temperature\nclassical Fokker-Planck systems and related quantum systems at zero temperature\nto include general non-equilibrium dynamics. Unlike Feynman mappings or\nstochastic quantization methods (or holographic type dualities), the classical\nsystems that we consider and their quantum duals reside in the same number of\nspace-time dimensions. The upshot of our exact result is that a Wick rotation\nrelates (i) dynamics in general finite temperature classical dissipative\nsystems to (ii) zero temperature dynamics in the corresponding dual many-body\nquantum systems. Using this correspondence, we illustrate that, even in the\nabsence of imposed disorder, many continuum quantum fluid systems (and possible\nlattice counterparts) may exhibit a zero-point \"quantum dynamical\nheterogeneity\" wherein the dynamics, at a given instant, is spatially\nnon-uniform. While the static length scales accompanying this phenomenon do not\nexhibit a clear divergence in standard correlation functions, the length scale\nof the dynamical heterogeneities can increase dramatically.

Our goal is to explore the impact of trap\nlocation on the efficiency of trapping in these two important polymer systems,\nwith the efficiency being measured by the average trapping time (ATT) that is\nthe average of source-to-trap mean first-passage time over every staring point\nin the whole networks. For Cayley trees, we derive an exact analytic formula\nfor the ATT to an arbitrary trap node, based on which we further obtain the\nexplicit expression of ATT for the case that the trap is uniformly distributed.\nFor Vicsek fractals, we provide the closed-form solution for ATT to a\nperipheral node farthest from the central node, as well as the numerical\nsolutions for the case when the trap is placed on other nodes. Moreover, we\nderive the exact formula for the ATT corresponding to the trapping problem when\nthe trap has an uniform distribution over all nodes. Our results show that the\ninfluence of trap location on the trapping efficiency is completely different\nfor the two polymer networks. In Cayley trees, the leading scaling of ATT\nincreases with the shortest distance between the trap and the central node,\nimplying that trap's position has an essential impact on the trapping\nefficiency; while in Vicsek fractals, the effect of location of the trap is\nnegligible, since the dominant behavior of ATT is identical, respective of the\nlocation where the trap is placed. We also present that for all cases of\ntrapping problems being studied, the trapping process is more efficient in\nCayley trees than in Vicsek fractals.

More generally, an infinite family of lattice loop\nmodels is studied on the torus and related to the corresponding\nFortuin-Kasteleyn random cluster models. Starting with a cylinder, the\ncommuting periodic single-row transfer matrices are built from the periodic\nTemperley-Lieb algebra extended by the shift operators Omega and Omega^{-1}. In\nthis enlarged algebra, the non-contractible loop fugacity is alpha and the\ncontractible loop fugacity is beta. The torus is formed by gluing the top and\nbottom of the cylinder. This gives rise to a variety of non-contractible loops\nwinding around the torus. Because of their nonlocal nature, the standard matrix\ntrace does not produce the proper geometric torus. Instead, we introduce a\nmodified matrix trace for this purpose. This is achieved by using a\nrepresentation of the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra with a parameter\nv that keeps track of the winding of defects on the cylinder. The transfer\nmatrix representatives and their eigenvalues thus depend on v. The modified\ntrace is constructed as a linear functional on planar connectivity diagrams in\nterms of matrix traces Tr_d (with a fixed number of defects d) and Chebyshev\npolynomials of the first kind. For critical dense polymers, where beta=0, the\ntransfer matrix eigenvalues are obtained by solving a functional equation in\nthe form of an inversion identity. The solution depends on d and is subject to\nselection rules which we prove. Simplifications occur if all non-contractible\nloop fugacities are set to alpha=2 in which case the traces are evaluated at\nv=1.

In the presence of hard-core or other interaction, however, the\ncomparison is not trivial. Nevertheless, the ground-state energy of hard-core\nbosons is proved to be lower than that of spinless fermions, if all the hopping\namplitudes are nonnegative.

By mapping the many-body Hamiltonian to a\ntight-binding model on a fictitious lattice, we show that the Fermi statistics\nof the original particles introduces an effective magnetic flux in the\nfictitious lattice.

We are particularly\nconcerned by the time between these extreme events, called respectively waiting\ntime and quiet time. If the thresholds are high enough it is possible to\njustify the existence of scaling laws for the probability distribution of the\ntimes as a function of the threshold value, although the scaling functions are\ndifferent in each case. For point processes, in addition to the trivial Poisson\nprocess, one can obtain double-power-law distributions with no finite mean\nvalue. This is justified in the context of renormalization-group\ntransformations, where such distributions arise as limiting distributions after\niterations of the transformation. Clear connections with the generalized\ncentral limit theorem are established from here. The non-existence of finite\nmoments leads to a semi-parametric scaling law in terms of the sample mean\nwaiting time, in which the (usually unkown) scale parameter is eliminated but\nnot the exponents. In the case of time series, scaling can arise by considering\nrandom-walk-like signals with absorbing boundaries, resulting in distributions\nwith a power-law \"bulk\" and a faster decay for long times. For large thresholds\nthe moments of the quiet-time distribution show a power-law dependence with the\nscale parameter, and isolation of the latter and of the exponents leads to a\nnon-parametric scaling law in terms only of the moments of the distribution.\nConclusions about the projections of changes in the occurrence of natural\nhazards lead to the necessity of distinguishing the behavior of the mean of the\ndistribution with the behavior of the extreme events. \n\n"}

The progress in SCCS\ntheory is reviewed in an `author-centered' frame to limit its scope. Our\nefforts, i.e., with Fran\\c{c}ois Perrot, sought to apply density functional\ntheory (DFT) to SCCS calculations. DFT was then poised to become the major\ncomputational scheme for condensed matter physics. The ion-sphere models of\nSalpeter and others evolved into useful average-atom models for finite-$T$\nCoulomb systems, as in Lieberman's Inferno code. We replaced these by\ncorrelation-sphere models that exploit the description of matter via density\nfunctionals linked to pair-distributions. These methods provided practical\ncomputational means for studying strongly interacting electron-ion Coulomb\nsystems like warm-dense matter (WDM). The staples of SCCS are wide-ranged,\nviz., equation of state, plasma spectroscopy, opacity (absorption, emission),\nscattering, level shifts, transport properties, e.g., electrical and heat\nconductivity, laser- and shock- created plasmas, their energy relaxation and\ntransient properties etc. These calculations need pseudopotentials and\nexchange-correlation functionals applicable to finite-$T$ Coulomb systems that\nmay be used in ab initio codes, molecular dynamics, etc. The search for simpler\ncomputational schemes has proceeded via proposals for orbital-free DFT,\nstatistical potentials, classical maps of quantum systems using classical\nschemes like HNC to include strong coupling effects (CHNC).

At this precise value of\nfrustration, the classical model has a very large degeneracy which makes the\nproblem difficult to handle. We show that introducing a ferromagnetic $J_3$\ncoupling partially lifts this degeneracy. It gives rise to a four-site magnetic\nunit cell with the constraint that the spins on every square must add to zero.\nThis leads to a two-parameter family of ground states and an emergent vector\norder parameter. We reinterpret this family of ground states as coexistence\nstates of three spirals. Using spin wave analysis, we show that thermal and\nquantum fluctuations break this degeneracy differently. Thermal fluctuations\nbreak it down to a threefold degeneracy with a N\\'eel phase and two stripe\nphases.

We describe the solution of the\nanisotropic XY spin chain; of the Lieb-Liniger model of bosons with contact\ninteraction at zero and finite temperature; and of the XXZ spin chain, first in\nthe coordinate and then in the algebraic approach. To establish the connection\nbetween the latter and the solution of two dimensional classical models, we\nalso introduce and solve the 6-vertex model. Finally, the low energy physics of\nthese integrable models is mapped into the corresponding conformal field\ntheory. Through its style and the choice of topics, this book tries to touch\nall fundamental ideas behind integrability and is meant for students and\nresearchers interested either in an introduction to later delve in the advance\naspects of Bethe Ansatz or in an overview of the topic for broadening their\nculture. \n\n"}

The RG flow of the\ndisorder-averaged theories takes place in the space of their coupling constants\nand also in the space of distributions for the disordered couplings, and the\ntwo mix together. We write down a generalization of the Callan-Symanzik\nequation for the flow of disorder-averaged correlation functions.
