Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

This interpretation is supported by the Butcher-Oemler effect.\n  We investigate E+A galaxies as an intermediate state between late-type\ngalaxies in low density environments and early-type galaxies in high density\nenvironment to constrain the possible transformation processes.

However, the observed polarization may be modified\ndue to photon propagation through the star's magnetosphere. For photon\nfrequencies much larger than the typical radio frequency, vacuum birefringence\ndue to strong-field quantum electrodynamics dominates over the plasma effect.\nWe study the evolution of photon polarization in the magnetized QED vacuum of a\nneutron star magnetosphere, paying particular attention to the propagation\neffect across the quasi-tangential (QT) point, where the photon momentum is\nnearly aligned with the magnetic field. In agreement with previous studies, we\nfind that in most regions of the magnetosphere, the photon polarization modes\nare decoupled due to vacuum birefringence, and therefore a large net linear\npolarization can be expected when the radiation escapes the magnetosphere.\nHowever, we show that X-ray polarization may change significantly when the\nphoton passes through the QT region. When averaging over a finite emission\narea, the net effect of QT propagation is to reduce the degree of linear\npolarization; the reduction factor depends on the photon energy, magnetic field\nstrength, geometry, rotation phase and the emission area, and can be more than\na factor of two.

SCA is a class of non-linear techniques for transforming\nobserved data (e.g., photometric colours for each galaxy, where the data lie on\na complex subset of p-dimensional space) to a simpler, more natural coordinate\nsystem wherein we apply regression to make redshift predictions. As SCA relies\nupon eigen-decomposition, our training set size is limited to ~ 10,000\ngalaxies; we use the Nystrom extension to quickly estimate diffusion\ncoordinates for objects not in the training set. We apply our method to 350,738\nSDSS main sample galaxies, 29,816 SDSS luminous red galaxies, and 5,223\ngalaxies from DEEP2 with CFHTLS ugriz photometry.

The model galaxy is employed from an ultra-high-resolution\nchemodynamic simulation of a primordial galaxy by Mori & Umemura (2006),which\nwell reproduces the observed properties of LAEs and LBGs. The total mass of\nmodel galaxy is 10^{11}M_sun. We solve not only photo-ionization but also\ncollisional ionization by shocks. In addition, according to the chemical\nenrichment, we incorporate the effect of dust extinction, taking the size\ndistributions of dust into account. As a result, we find that dust extinction\nreduces the escape fractions by a factor 1.5-8.5 in the LAE phase and by a\nfactor 2.5-11 in the LBG phase, while the collisional ionization by shocks\nincreases the escape fractions by a factor ~ 2.

These results\nare well concordant with the recent estimations derived from the flux ratio at\n1500 angstrom to 900 angstrom of LAEs and LBGs.

While the additional term of IC\nlosses off of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is negligible in the local\nUniverse, the rapid increase in the strength of the CMB energy density (i.e.\n$\\sim(1+z)^{4})$ suggests that evolution in the FIR-radio correlation should\noccur with infrared (IR; $8-1000 \\micron$)/radio ratios increasing with\nredshift. At present, observations do not show such a trend with redshift;\n$z\\sim6$ radio-quiet QSOs appear to lie on the local FIR-radio correlation\nwhile a sample of $z\\sim4.4$ and $z\\sim2.2$ SMGs exhibit ratios that are a\nfactor of $\\sim$2.5 {\\it below} the canonical value.

The\nsurvey, which primarily targets H-alpha emitters at z < 3, uses the Wide Field\nCAMera on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope and a custom narrow-band filter\nin the J band to reach a Lyman-alpha luminosity limit of ~10^43.8 erg/s over a\nco-moving volume of 1.12x10^6 Mpc^3 at z = 8.96+-0.06.

Recent data from a variety of sources,\nincluding the cluster catalogue of von der Linden et al. are compared to the\nsemi-analytic models of De Lucia & Blaizot. We find that these models predict\ntoo many passive satellite galaxies in clusters, too few passive central\ngalaxies with low stellar masses, and too many passive central galaxies with\nhigh masses. We then outline a series of modifications to the model necessary\nto solve these problems: a) Instead of instantaneous stripping of the external\ngas reservoir after a galaxy becomes a satellite, the gas supply is assumed to\ndecrease at the same rate that the surrounding halo loses mass due to tidal\nstripping, b) The AGN feedback efficiency is lowered to bring the fraction of\nmassive passive centrals in better agreement with the data. We also allow for\nradio mode AGN feedback in satellite galaxies. c) We assume that satellite\ngalaxies residing in host haloes with masses below 10^12 M_sun do not undergo\nany stripping. We highlight the fact that in low mass galaxies, the external\nreservoir is composed primarily of gas that has been expelled from the galactic\ndisk by supernovae driven winds. This gas must remain available as a future\nreservoir for star formation, even in satellite galaxies. Finally, we present a\nsimple recipe for the stripping of gas and dark matter in satellites that can\nbe used in models where subhalo evolution is not followed in detail. \n\n"}

The X-ray spectrum of 1ES 1210-646 is described using a simple powerlaw\nshape or, in the case of INTEGRAL data, with a blackbody plus powerlaw model.\nSpectral variability is found in connection with different flux levels of the\nsource. A strong and transient iron emission line with an energy of about 6.7\nkeV and an equivalent width of about 1.6 keV is detected when the source is\nfound at an intermediate flux level. The line strength seems to be tied to the\norbital motion of the accreting object, as this feature is only apparent at the\nperiastron.

In order to test this hypothesis we run\na series of 15 high-resolution N-body simulations for different cosmological\nmodels. These consists of three LCDM cosmologies best fitting WMAP-1, 3 and 5\nyears data, and three toy-models characterized by a Ratra-Peebles quintessence\npotential with different slopes and amounts of dark energy density. These toy\nmodels have very different evolutionary histories at the background and linear\nlevel, but share the same sigma8 value. For each of these models we measure the\nmass function from catalogues of halos identified in the simulations using the\nFriend-of-Friend (FoF) algorithm. We find redshift dependent deviations from a\nuniversal behaviour, well above numerical uncertainties and of non-stochastic\norigin, which are correlated with the linear growth factor of the investigated\ncosmologies. Using the spherical collapse as guidance, we show that such\ndeviations are caused by the cosmology dependence of the non-linear collapse\nand virialization process. For practical applications, we provide a fitting\nformula of the mass function accurate to 5 percents over the all range of\ninvestigated cosmologies. We also derive an empirical relation between the FoF\nlinking parameter and the virial overdensity which can account for most of the\ndeviations from an exact universal behavior.

Moreover\nmasses become geometric, appearing as Weyl weights of tractors (conformal\nmultiplets of fields necessary to keep local unit invariance manifest). The\nrelationship between these weights and masses is through the scalar curvature.\nAs a consequence mass terms are spacetime dependent for off-shell gravitational\nbackgrounds, but happily constant for physical, Einstein manifolds.\nUnfortunately this introduces a naturalness problem because the scalar\ncurvature is proportional to the cosmological constant. By writing down tractor\nstress tensors (multiplets built from the standard stress tensor and its first\nand second derivatives), we show how back-reaction solves this naturalness\nproblem. We also show that classical back-reaction generates an interesting\npotential for scalar fields. We speculate that a proper description of how\nphysical systems couple to scale, could improve our understanding of\nnaturalness problems caused by the disparity between the particle physics and\nobserved, cosmological constants.

At high luminosities the source switched between two types\nof Z source behavior and at low luminosities we observed a transition from Z\nsource to atoll source behavior. These transitions between subclasses primarily\nmanifest themselves as changes in the shapes of the tracks in X-ray color-color\nand hardness-intensity diagrams, but they are accompanied by changes in the kHz\nquasi-periodic oscillations, broad-band variability, burst behavior, and/or\nX-ray spectra. We find that the low-energy X-ray flux is a good parameter to\ntrack the gradual evolution of the tracks in color-color and hardness-intensity\ndiagrams, allowing us to resolve the evolution of the source in greater detail\nthan before and relate the observed properties to other NS-LMXBs.

In this research note we re-assess the spectral\nresolution of the MILES stellar library and of the stellar population models\nbased on it. This exercise was performed, because of a recent controversy over\nthe exact MILES resolution. We perform our test through the comparison of MILES\nstellar spectra with three different sets of higher-resolution templates, one\nfully theoretical - the MARCS library - and two empirical ones, namely the\nIndo-U.S. and ELODIE v3.1 libraries. The theoretical template has a\nwell-defined very high (R=20000) resolution. Hence errors on this theoretical\nvalue do not affect our conclusions. Our approach based on the MARCS library\nwas crucial to constrain the values of the resolution also for the other two\nempirical templates. We find that the MILES resolution has previously been\nslightly overestimated. We derive a new spectral resolution of 2.54 A FWHM,\ninstead of the nominal 2.3 A. The reason for this difference is due to an\noverestimation of the resolution for the Indo-U.S. library that was previously\nused for estimates of the MILES resolution. For the Indo-U.S. we obtain a new\nvalue of 1.35 A FWHM. Most importantly, the results derived from the MARCS and\nELODIE libraries are in very good agreement.

On a\n25-class data set of 1542 well-studied variable stars, we achieve a 22.8%\noverall classification error using the random forest classifier; this\nrepresents a 24% improvement over the best previous classifier on these data.\nThis methodology is effective for identifying samples of specific science\nclasses: for pulsational variables used in Milky Way tomography we obtain a\ndiscovery efficiency of 98.2% and for eclipsing systems we find an efficiency\nof 99.1%, both at 95% purity. We show that the random forest (RF) classifier is\nsuperior to other machine-learned methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and\nrelative immunity to features with no useful class information; the RF\nclassifier can also be used to estimate the importance of each feature in\nclassification. Additionally, we present the first astronomical use of\nhierarchical classification methods to incorporate a known class taxonomy in\nthe classifier, which further reduces the catastrophic error rate to 7.8%.\nExcluding low-amplitude sources, our overall error rate improves to 14%, with a\ncatastrophic error rate of 3.5%. \n\n"}

In this study we\nuse several prescriptions of stellar accretion and a description of the\nGalactic gas distribution to simulate the luminosities and spatial distribution\nof massive protostellar population of the Galaxy. We then compare the\nobservables of each simulation to the results of the Red MSX Source (RMS)\nsurvey, a recently compiled database of massive young stellar objects. We find\nthat the observations are best matched by accretion rates which increase as the\nprotostar grows in mass, such as those predicted by the turbulent core and\ncompetitive accretion (i.e. Bondi-Hoyle) models. These 'accelerating accretion'\nmodels provide very good qualitative and quantitative fits to the data, though\nwe are unable to distinguish between these two models on our simulations alone.\nWe rule out models with accretion rates which are constant with time, and those\nwhich are initially very high and which fall away with time, as these produce\nresults which are quantitatively and/or qualitatively incompatible with the\nobservations.

In this context, we study here the prospects for\nconstraining the dark matter parameter space with the next generation of\nton-scale detectors. Using realistic experimental capabilities for a wide range\nof targets (including fluorine, sodium, argon, germanium, iodine and xenon),\nthe role of target complementarity is analysed in detail while including the\nimpact of astrophysical uncertainties in a self-consistent manner. We show\nexplicitly that a multi-target signal in future direct detection facilities can\ndetermine the sign of the ratio of scalar couplings $f_n/f_p$, but not its\nscale. This implies that the scalar-proton cross-section is left essentially\nunconstrained if the assumption $f_p\\sim f_n$ is relaxed.

We designate this region as the star forming (SF) disk, in which metals\nare produced from supernova explosions (SNexp) while at the same time inflows\nare driven by SNexp-excited turbulent viscosity to accrete onto the SMBHs. In\nthis paper, an equation of metallicity governed by SNexp and radial advection\nis established to describe the metal distribution and evolution in the SF disk.\nWe find that the metal abundance is enriched at different rates at different\npositions in the disk, and that a metallicity gradient is set up that evolves\nfor steady-state AGNs.

The cold, dusty\nclumps surrounding RCW 120 are arranged in an almost spherical shell and\nharbour many young stellar objects. By performing high-resolution,\nthree-dimensional SPH simulations of HII regions expanding into fractal\nmolecular clouds, we investigate whether the formation of massive clumps in\ndense, swept-up shells necessarily requires the C&C mechanism. In a second\nstep, we use RADMC-3D to compute the synthetic dust continuum emission from our\nsimulations, in order to compare them with observations of RCW 120 made with\nAPEX-LABOCA at 870 micron. We show that a distribution of clumps similar to the\none seen in RCW 120 can readily be explained by a non-uniform initial molecular\ncloud structure. Hence, a shell-like configuration of massive clumps does not\nimply that the C&C mechanism is at work. Rather, we find a hybrid form of\ntriggering, which combines elements of C&C and Radiatively Driven Implosion\n(RDI). In addition, we investigate the reliability of deriving clump masses\nfrom their 870 micron emission. We find that for clumps with more than 100\nM_sun the observational estimates are accurate to within a factor of two and\nthat, even at these long wavelengths, it is important to account for the\nradiative heating from triggered, embedded protostars. \n\n"}

We show that various estimates for the\nGalactic SFR are consistent with one another once they have been normalized to\nthe same initial mass function (IMF) and massive star models, converging to 1.9\n+/- 0.4 M_sun/yr. However, standard SFR diagnostics are vulnerable to\nsystematics founded in the use of indirect observational tracers sensitive only\nto high-mass stars. We find that absolute SFRs measured using resolved\nlow/intermediate-mass stellar populations in Galactic H II regions are\nsystematically higher by factors of ~2-3 as compared with calibrations for SFRs\nmeasured from mid-IR and radio emission. We discuss some potential explanations\nfor this discrepancy and conclude that it could be allayed if (1) the power-law\nslope of the IMF for intermediate-mass (1.5 M_sun < m < 5 M_sun) stars were\nsteeper than the Salpeter slope, or (2) a correction factor was applied to the\nextragalactic 24 micron SFR calibrations to account for the duration of star\nformation in individual mid-IR-bright H II regions relative to the lifetimes of\nO stars.

Font et\nal. have recently demonstrated that these simulations are able to successfully\nreproduce the satellite luminosity functions and the metallicity and surface\nbrightness profiles of the spheroids of the Milky Way and M31. A key to the\nsuccess of the simulations is a significant contribution to the spheroid from\nstars that formed in situ. While the outer halo is dominated by accreted stars,\nstars formed in the main progenitor of the galaxy dominate at r < ~30 kpc. In\nthe present study we show that this component was primarily formed in a\nproto-disc at high redshift and was subsequently liberated from the disc by\ndynamical heating associated with mass accretion. As a consequence of its\norigin, the in situ component of the spheroid has different kinematics (namely\nnet prograde rotation with respect to the disc) than that of the spheroid\ncomponent built from the disruption of satellites. In addition, the in situ\ncomponent has a flattened distribution, that is due in part to its rotation.

We use Fisher analysis to study the\neffectiveness of COSEBIs. We show our results in terms of figure-of-merit\nquantities, based on Fisher matrices. Results. We find that a relatively small\nnumber of COSEBIs modes is always enough to saturate to the maximum information\nlevel. This number is always smaller for 'logarithmic COSEBIs' than for 'linear\nCOSEBIs', and also depends on the number of redshift bins, the number and\nchoice of cosmological parameters, as well as the survey characteristics.\nConclusions. COSEBIs provide a very compact way of analyzing cosmic shear data,\ni.e., all the E-/B-mode separable second-order statistical information in the\ndata is reduced to a small number of COSEBIs modes. Furthermore, with this\nmethod the arbitrariness in data binning is no longer an issue since the\nCOSEBIs modes are discrete. Finally, the small number of modes also implies\nthat covariances, and their inverse, are much more conveniently obtainable,\ne.g., from numerical simulations, than for the shear correlation functions\nthemselves. \n\n"}

We now provide a model in which a copy of the electroweak\ngauge group is added to the Standard Model. We spontaneously break this new\ngauge group to the diagonal Z_2 center which is used to stabilize a dark matter\ncandidate. In addition to the dark matter candidate, anomaly free messenger\nfermions are included which transform non-trivially under all the gauge groups.\nIn analogy to electroweak baryogenesis, the model generates an excess of\nmessenger \"baryons\". These \"baryons\" subsequently decay to the Standard Model\nand dark matter to generate an excess of Standard Model baryons. The\nbaryon-to-dark matter number density ratio is ultimately due to the requirement\nof gauge anomaly freedom. Dark sphalerons generate operators which violate B -\nL but preserves B + L. Thus, the asymmetry is not washed out by the Standard\nModel. The model radiatively generates a dark matter mass of order of the\nelectroweak vacuum expectation value suppressed by a loop factor therefore\nsetting the dark matter-to-baryon relic abundance.

The detection of gamma rays from star-forming galaxies by the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) has allowed the determination of a functional\nrelationship between star formation rate and gamma-ray luminosity (Ackermann\net. al. 2012). Since star formation is known to scale with total infrared\n(8-1000 micrometers) and radio (1.4 GHz) luminosity, the observed infrared and\nradio emission from a star-forming galaxy can be used to quantitatively infer\nthe galaxy's gamma-ray luminosity. Similarly, star forming galaxies within\ngalaxy clusters allow us to derive lower limits on the gamma-ray emission from\nclusters, which have not yet been conclusively detected in gamma rays. In this\nstudy we apply the relationships between gamma-ray luminosity and radio and IR\nluminosities derived in Ackermann et. al. 2012 to a sample of galaxy clusters\nfrom Ackermann et. al. 2010 in order to place lower limits on the gamma-ray\nemission associated with star formation in galaxy clusters. We find that\nseveral clusters have predicted lower limits on gamma-ray emission that are\nwithin an order of magnitude of the upper limits derived in Ackermann et. al.\n2010 based on non-detection by Fermi-LAT. Given the current gamma-ray limits,\nstar formation likely plays a significant role in the gamma-ray emission in\nsome clusters, especially those with cool cores. We predict that both Fermi-LAT\nover the course of its lifetime and the future Cherenkov Telescope Array will\nbe able to detect gamma-ray emission from star-forming galaxies in clusters. \n\n"}

Changes in its\nradio morphology suggested in the past the hypothesis of a precessing\nmicroquasar. In 2006, a set of VLBA observations performed all around the orbit\nwere not used to study the precession because the souce was explained in the\ncontext of the pulsar model, the alternative model for this system. However, a\nsuccessive radio spectral index analysis has confirmed the predictions of the\nmicroquasar scenario in LSI+61303. At the light of these results we reanalysed\nthe set of VLBA observations that constitutes a unique tool to determine the\nprecession period and render a better understanding of the physical mechanism\nbehind the precession. We improved the dynamic range of the images by a factor\nof four using self-calibration, and the self-calibrated maps reveal, in six out\nof ten images, a double-sided structure. The double-sided structure has\nvariable position angle and switches at some epochs to a one-sided structure.\nThese variations indicate a scenario where the precessing jet, inducing\nvariable Doppler boosting, points close to our line of sight - a microblazar,\nthe galactic version of the extra-galactic blazars. High energy observations of\nLSI+61303 are consistent with the microblazar nature of this object. Moreover,\nwe suggest in LSI+61303 the first case of core shift effect observed in a\nmicroquasar. Because of this effect, well known in AGN, the cm-core of the jet\nis rather displaced from the system center. In LSI+61303, the cm-core of the\njet traces a large ellipse, 7 times larger than the orbit, in a period of about\n28 d. Our hypothesis is that this ellipse is the cross-section of the\nprecession cone of the jet at the distance of the 3.6 cm-core, and its period\nis the precession period. \n\n"}

We further argue that if\nmagnetic fields should be present in such clouds at a level that could affect\nthe stability properties, they need to be strong enough to compete with the\nradiation pressure on the cloud. This would imply magnetic field values of a\nfew Gauss for a sample of Active Galactic Nuclei we draw from the literature.\nWe then investigate the effect of several magnetic configurations on cloud\nstability in axi-symmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations.

This assumption has been confirmed by\nSZ signal detection in hundreds of clusters but, in comparison with the huge\nnumbers of clusters within optically selected samples from Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) data, this only accounts for a few per cent of clusters. Here we\nintroduce a model-independent new method to confirm the assumption that most\ngalaxy clusters can offer the thermal SZ signal as their main foreground\neffect. For the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) seven-year data\n(and a given galaxy cluster sample), we introduced a parameter d1 as the\nnearest-neighbour cluster angular distance of each pixel, then we classified\ndata pixels as 'to be' (d1--> 0 case) or 'not to be' (d1 large enough) affected\nby the sample clusters. By comparing the statistical results of these two kinds\nof pixels, we can see how the sample clusters affect the CMB data directly. We\nfind that the Planck Early Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (ESZ) sample and X-ray samples\n(~10^2 clusters) can lead to obvious temperature depression in the WMAP\nseven-year data, which confirms the SZ effect prediction. However, each\noptically selected sample (>10^4 clusters) shows an opposite result: the mean\ntemperature rises to about 10uK. This unexpected qualitative scenario implies\nthat the main foreground effect of most clusters is $not$ always the expected\nSZ effect.

In\nthis paper, we attempt to confirm the existence of the narrow-line HI emission\n(NHIE) clouds by using the data from the Parkes Galactic all-sky survey (GASS)\nand try to find their place among other coldest constituents of the ISM.\nMethods.

In some\nelliptical galaxies cold interstellar dust emitting at 70 and 160 microns may\narise from recent gas-rich mergers. However, we argue that most of the large\nrange of 70 micron luminosity in elliptical galaxies is due to dust transported\nfrom galactic cores by feedback events in (currently IR-quiet) active galactic\nnuclei.

To\ncompare such models to observations, one must understand how to translate\nbetween surface densities observed averaging over large (~kpc) scales and\nsurface densities on the scale of individual clouds (~pc scale), which are\ntreated by models. We define a \"clumping factor\" that captures this translation\nas the ratio of the mass-weighted surface density, which is often the quantity\nof physical interest, to the area-weighted surface density, which is observed.\nWe use high spatial resolution (sub-kpc) maps of CO and HI emission from nearby\ngalaxies to measure the clumping factor of both atomic and molecular gas. The\nmolecular and atomic ISM exhibit dramatically different degrees of clumping. As\na result, the ratio H2/HI measured at ~kpc resolution cannot be trivially\ninterpreted as a cloud-scale ratio of surface densities.

Methods: We combine a\ngas-grain chemical model with radiative transfer calculations to simulate\ndensity and temperature structure in starless cores. The chemical model\nincludes deuterated forms of species with up to 4 atoms and the spin states of\nthe light species H2, H2+ and H3+ and their deuterated forms. Results: We find\nthat HD eventually depletes from the gas phase because deuterium is efficiently\nincorporated to grain-surface HDO, resulting in inefficient HD production on\ngrains. HD depletion has consequences not only on the abundances of e.g. H2D+\nand D2H+, whose production depends on the abundance of HD, but also on the spin\nstate abundance ratios of the various light species, when compared with the\ncomplete depletion model where heavy elements do not influence the chemistry.\nConclusions: While the eventual HD depletion leads to the disappearance of\nlight deuterium-bearing species from the gas phase in a relatively short\ntimescale at high density, we find that at late stages of core evolution the\nabundances of H2D+ and D2H+ increase toward the core edge and the disributions\nbecome extended.

VI. hierarchical inference of the initial mass\n  functions of bulges and discs Abstract: The long-standing assumption that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is\nuniversal has recently been challenged by a number of observations. Several\nstudies have shown that a \"heavy\" IMF (e.g., with a Salpeter-like abundance of\nlow mass stars and thus normalisation) is preferred for massive early-type\ngalaxies, while this IMF is inconsistent with the properties of less massive,\nlater-type galaxies. These discoveries motivate the hypothesis that the IMF may\nvary (possibly very slightly) across galaxies and across components of\nindividual galaxies (e.g. bulges vs discs). In this paper we use a sample of 19\nlate-type strong gravitational lenses from the SWELLS survey to investigate the\nIMFs of the bulges and discs in late-type galaxies. We perform a joint analysis\nof the galaxies' total masses (constrained by strong gravitational lensing) and\nstellar masses (constrained by optical and near-infrared colours in the context\nof a stellar population synthesis [SPS] model, up to an IMF normalisation\nparameter). Using minimal assumptions apart from the physical constraint that\nthe total stellar mass within any aperture must be less than the total mass\nwithin the aperture, we find that the bulges of the galaxies cannot have IMFs\nheavier (i.e. implying high mass per unit luminosity) than Salpeter, while the\ndisc IMFs are not well constrained by this data set. We also discuss the\nnecessity for hierarchical modelling when combining incomplete information\nabout multiple astronomical objects. This modelling approach allows us to place\nupper limits on the size of any departures from universality. More data,\nincluding spatially resolved kinematics (as in paper V) and stellar population\ndiagnostics over a range of bulge and disc masses, are needed to robustly\nquantify how the IMF varies within galaxies. \n\n"}

As\na result, perturbations developed with time such as lens orbital motion can\nmake considerable deviations in astrometric trajectories. The rotation of the\nsource trajectory due to lens orbital motion produces a more detectable\nastrometric deviation because the astrometric cross-section is much larger than\nthe photometric one.

However, if the scalar field is identified as\nthe quintessence field, by detailed discussing both the entropy and adiabatic\nperturbation modes for the first time, we find that the anisotropies of the\nrotation angle are always too small to be detectable.In addition, as the main\ngoal of this paper, we investigate the effect of rotated polarization power\nspectrum on the detection of relic gravitational waves. we find that, the\nrotated B-mode polarization could be fairly large, and comparable with those\ngenerated by the gravitational waves. This forms a new contamination for the\ndetection of relic gravitational waves in the CMB. In particular, we also\npropose the method to reconstruct and subtract the rotated B-mode polarization,\nby which the residuals become negligible for the gravitational-wave detection. \n\n"}

The galaxies in RXJ0848.6+4453\npopulate the Fundamental Plane similar to that found for lower redshift\nclusters with a zero point offset corresponding to an epoch of last star\nformation at z_form= 1.95+-0.2. The spectra of the galaxies in RXJ0848.6+4453\nare dominated by young stellar populations at all galaxy masses and in many\ncases show emission indicating low level on-going star formation. The average\nage of the young stellar populations (estimated from H-zeta) is consistent with\na major star formation episode 1-2 Gyr prior, which in turn agrees with\nz_form=1.95. Galaxies dominated by young stellar populations are distributed\nthroughout the cluster. We speculate that low level star formation has not yet\nbeen fully quenched in the center of this cluster may be because the cluster is\nsignificantly poorer than other clusters previously studied at similar\nredshifts, which appear to have very little on-going star formation in their\ncenters. \n\n"}

The study of the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) in relation to\nthe galaxy environment and the stellar mass density profile, rho(r), is a\npowerful tool to constrain models of galaxy evolution. Aims. We determine the\nSMF of the z=0.44 cluster of galaxies MACS J1206.2-0847 separately for passive\nand star-forming (SF) galaxies, in different regions of the cluster, from the\ncenter out to approximately 2 virial radii.

Stellar masses are obtained by SED fitting\non 5-band photometric data obtained at the Subaru telescope. We identify 1363\ncluster members down to a stellar mass of 10^9.5 Msolar. Results. The whole\ncluster SMF is well fitted by a double Schechter function. The SMFs of cluster\nSF and passive galaxies are statistically different. The SMF of the SF cluster\ngalaxies does not depend on the environment. The SMF of the passive population\nhas a significantly smaller slope (in absolute value) in the innermost (<0.50\nMpc), highest density cluster region, than in more external, lower density\nregions. The number ratio of giant/subgiant galaxies is maximum in this\ninnermost region and minimum in the adjacent region, but then gently increases\nagain toward the cluster outskirts. This is also reflected in a decreasing\nradial trend of the average stellar mass per cluster galaxy. On the other hand,\nthe stellar mass fraction, i.e., the ratio of stellar to total cluster mass,\ndoes not show any significant radial trend. Conclusions. Our results appear\nconsistent with a scenario in which SF galaxies evolve into passive galaxies\ndue to density-dependent environmental processes, and eventually get destroyed\nvery near the cluster center to become part of a diffuse intracluster medium. \n\n"}

Recent studies have pointed out that extracting\nmerger trees from numerical simulations of structure formation is non-trivial;\ndifferent tree building algorithms can give differing merger histories. These\ndifferences should be carefully understood before merger trees are used as\ninput for models of galaxy formation. We investigate the impact of different\nhalo merger trees on a semi-analytic model. We find that the z=0 galaxy\nproperties in our model show differences between trees when using a common\nparameter set. The star formation history of the Universe and the properties of\nsatellite galaxies can show marked differences between trees with different\nconstruction methods. Independently calibrating the semi-analytic model for\neach tree can reduce the discrepancies between the z=0 global galaxy\nproperties, at the cost of increasing the differences in the evolutionary\nhistories of galaxies. Furthermore, the underlying physics implied can vary,\nresulting in key quantities such as the supernova feedback efficiency differing\nby factors of 2.

Here we add a mechanism for emulating the effect of\na full bias matrix to the Planck likelihood code through the parameter\nestimation code SCoPE.

We fit each cluster's CMD to measure its\nmass function (MF) slope for stars >2 Msun. For the ensemble of clusters, the\ndistribution of stellar MF slopes is best described by\n$\\Gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$ with a very small intrinsic scatter. The data\nalso imply no significant dependencies of the MF slope on cluster age, mass,\nand size, providing direct observational evidence that the measured MF\nrepresents the IMF. This analysis implies that the high-mass IMF slope in M31\nclusters is universal with a slope ($\\Gamma=+1.45^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$) that is\nsteeper than the canonical Kroupa (+1.30) and Salpeter (+1.35) values.

As we follow the collapse of this gas, we find that the\ncharacter of the flow changes at two radii, the disk radius $r_d$, and the\nradius $r_*$ where the enclosed gas mass exceeds the stellar mass. Accretion\nstarts at large scales and works inwards. In line with recent analytical work,\nwe find that the density evolves to a fixed attractor, $\\rho(r,t ) \\rightarrow\n\\rho(r)$, for $r_d<r<r_*$; mass flows through this structure onto a\nsporadically gravitationally unstable disk, and from thence onto the star. In\nthe bulk of the simulation box we find that the random motions $v_T \\sim r^p$\nwith $p \\sim 0.5$, in agreement with Larson's size-linewidth relation. In the\nvicinity of massive star forming regions we find $ p \\sim 0.2-0.3$, as seen in\nobservations. For $r<r_*$, $v_T$ increases inward, with $p=-1/2$. Finally, we\nfind that the total stellar mass $M_*(t)\\sim t^2$ in line with previous\nnumerical and analytic work that suggests a nonlinear rate of star formation. \n\n"}

They open a window into the very distant and high-energy Universe\nthat is difficult to access by any human means and devices. The possibility of\ndetecting them in large exposure space-based apparatus, like JEM-EUSO, is an\nexperimental challenge. In this paper we present an estimation of the\nfeasibility of detection of UHE tau neutrino by the JEM-EUSO telescope. The\ninteractions of tau-neutrino in sea water and Earth's crust have been\ninvestigated. The estimation of the propagation length and energy of the\noutgoing tau-lepton shows that if its decay occurs in the atmosphere close\nenough to the Earth's surface, e.g. below $\\sim$ $5 km$ altitude, the cascade\nis intensive enough and the generated light can be detected from space.

{"id": "1509.06758", "contents": "Title: Mapping stellar content to dark matter halos. II. Halo mass is the main\n  driver of galaxy quenching Abstract: We develop a simple yet comprehensive method to distinguish the underlying\ndrivers of galaxy quenching, using the clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing of\nred and blue galaxies in SDSS. Building on the iHOD framework developed by Zu &\nMandelbaum (2015a), we consider two quenching scenarios: 1) a \"halo\" quenching\nmodel in which halo mass is the sole driver for turning off star formation in\nboth centrals and satellites; and 2) a \"hybrid\" quenching model in which the\nquenched fraction of galaxies depends on their stellar mass while the satellite\nquenching has an extra dependence on halo mass. The two best-fit models\ndescribe the red galaxy clustering and lensing equally well, but halo quenching\nprovides significantly better fits to the blue galaxies above $10^{11}\nM_\\odot/h^2$. The halo quenching model also correctly predicts the average halo\nmass of the red and blue centrals, showing excellent agreement with the direct\nweak lensing measurements of locally brightest galaxies. Models in which\nquenching is not tied to halo mass, including an age-matching model in which\ngalaxy colour depends on halo age at fixed $M_*$, fail to reproduce the\nobserved halo mass for massive blue centrals. We find similar critical halo\nmasses responsible for the quenching of centrals and satellites\n(~$1.5\\times10^{12} M\\odot/h^2$), hinting at a uniform quenching mechanism for\nboth, e.g., the virial shock-heating of infalling gas. The success of the iHOD\nhalo quenching model provides strong evidence that the physical mechanism that\nquenches star formation in galaxies is tied principally to the masses of their\ndark matter halos rather than the properties of their stellar components. \n\n"}

{"id": "1509.07877", "contents": "Title: A Constrained-Gradient Method to Control Divergence Errors in Numerical\n  MHD Abstract: In numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a major challenge is maintaining\nzero magnetic field-divergence (div-B). Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are\nsufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using\nonly the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,\norder-of-magnitude errors. \n\n"}
{"id": "1509.08477", "contents": "Title: Flooded Dark Matter and S Level Rise Abstract: Most dark matter (DM) models set the DM relic density by some interaction\nwith Standard Model particles. Such models generally assume the existence of\nStandard Model particles early on, with the DM relic density a later\nconsequence of those interactions. Perhaps a more compelling assumption is that\nDM is not part of the Standard Model sector and a population of DM too is\ngenerated at the end of inflation. This democratic assumption does not\nnecessarily provide a natural value for the DM relic density, and superficially\nleads to too much entropy in the dark sector. We address the latter issue by\nthe late decay of heavy particles produced at early times, associating the DM\nrelic density with the lifetime of a long-lived state. We ask what it would\ntake for this scenario to be compatible with observations in what we call\nFlooded Dark Matter (FDM) and discuss several interesting consequences. One is\nthat DM can be very light and furthermore, light DM is in some sense the most\nnatural scenario in FDM as it is compatible with larger couplings of the\ndecaying particle. Moreover, the decay of the field with the smallest coupling\nand hence the longest lifetime dominates the entropy and possibly the matter\ncontent of the Universe, a principle we refer to as 'Maximum Baroqueness'. We\nalso show that the dark sector should be colder than the ordinary sector,\nrelaxing the free-streaming constraints on light DM. We will discuss the\nimplications for the core-cusp problem in a follow-up paper. FDM also has\ninteresting baryogenesis implications. One possibility is that both DM and\nbaryon asymmetries are simultaneously diluted by a late entropy dump.\nAlternatively, FDM is compatible with an elegant non-thermal leptogenesis\nimplementation in which decays of a heavy RH neutrino lead to late time\nreheating of the Standard Model and provide suitable conditions for creation of\na lepton asymmetry. \n\n"}

As a result, the theory we consider can explain the non-zero\nreported variation in the evolution of alpha by purely considering disformal\ncouplings. We also find that if matter and photons are coupled in the same way\nto the scalar field, disformal couplings itself do not lead to a variation of\nthe fine-structure constant. A number of scenarios are discussed consistent\nwith the current astrophysical, geochemical, laboratory and the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation constraints on the cosmological evolution of\nalpha. The models presented are also consistent with the current type Ia\nsupernovae constraints on the effective dark energy equation of state. We find\nthat the Oklo bound in particular puts strong constraints on the model\nparameters.

To obtain\ntheoretical constraints on the polarization of MDE, we first compute the degree\nof alignment of big silicate grains incorporated with magnetic inclusions.

The\nclustering strength of quiescent galaxies exceeds that of star-forming\ngalaxies, implying that quiescent galaxies are preferentially located in more\nmassive halos.

However, the quiescent fraction--density relation reverses its trend\nat intermediate redshifts ($1 < z < 1.5$) with marginal significance\n(<1.8$\\sigma$) and is found to be scale dependent (1.6$\\sigma$). The lower\nfraction of quiescent galaxies seen in large-scale dense environments, if\nconfirmed to be true, may be associated with the fact that the star formation\ncan be more easily sustained via cold stream accretion in `large-scale'\nhigh-density regions, preventing galaxies from permanent quenching.

We show that\npairwise peculiar velocity statistics, in particular the relative radial\nvelocity dispersion, $\\sigma_\\parallel$ , can be used to observe this\ntransition when they are binned by some measure of halo environment. We\nestablished this by measuring the radial velocity dispersion between pairs of\nhalos in N-body simulations for three $f(R)$ gravity and four symmetron models.\nWe developed an estimator involving only line-of-sight velocities to show that\nthis quantity is observable, and binned the results in halo mass, ambient\ndensity, and the isolatedness of halos. Ambient density is found to be the most\nrelevant measure of environment; it is distinct from isolatedness, and\ncorrelates well with theoretical expectations for the symmetron model.

This case is important because the resonant\ninteraction can amplify the TTV effect and allow planets to be detected more\neasily. We develop an analytic model of the resonant dynamics valid for small\norbital eccentricities and use it to derive the principal TTV terms.

The resonant TTV period is proportional (m/M_*)^(-2/3), where m and\nM_* are the planetary and stellar masses.

In this thesis such an implementation is attempted for the combined\nnumerical hydrodynamics and N-body simulation software Arepo (Springel, 2010)\nfor the high density gas in the ISM only. This allows supernova driven\nturbulence in boxes of 400pc cubed to be studied. In a stochastic process a\nlarge amount of thermal energy is imparted on a number of neighbouring cells,\nmimicking the effect of a supernova explosions. We test this approach by\nmodelling the explosion of a single supernova in a uniform density medium and\ncomparing the evolution of the resulting supernova remnant to the\ntheoretically-predicted behaviour. We also run a simulation with our feedback\ncode and a fixed supernova rate derived from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation\n(Kennicutt, 1998) for a duration of about 20 Myrs. We describe our method in\ndetail in this text and discuss the properties of our implementation. vii \n\n"}

The irradiation of the ice was\nmonitored by means of infrared spectroscopy and the molecules in the gas phase\nwere detected using quadrupole mass spectroscopy. Fully deuterated methanol was\nused for confirmation of the results. The photodesorption of methanol to the\ngas phase was not observed in the mass spectra at different irradiation\ntemperatures.

In order to fully exploit the potential of these data sets, it\nis important to understand the systematic effects associated with the\ninstrument and the analysis pipeline. A common approach to tackle this is to\nforward-model the entire system - from the hardware to the analysis of the data\nproducts. For this purpose, we introduce two newly developed, open-source\nPython packages: the HI Data Emulator (HIDE) and the Signal Extraction and\nEmission Kartographer (SEEK) for simulating and processing single-dish radio\nsurvey data. HIDE forward-models the process of collecting astronomical radio\nsignals in a single-dish radio telescope instrument and outputs pixel-level\ntime-ordered-data. SEEK processes the time-ordered-data, removes artifacts from\nRadio Frequency Interference (RFI), automatically applies flux calibration, and\naims to recover the astronomical radio signal. The two packages can be used\nseparately or together depending on the application. Their modular and flexible\nnature allows easy adaptation to other instruments and data sets. We describe\nthe basic architecture of the two packages and examine in detail the noise and\nRFI modeling in HIDE, as well as the implementation of gain calibration and RFI\nmitigation in SEEK.

In this Letter, we investigate whether\npulsar braking by combined between the magnetic dipole emission and the\ngravitational radiation might have a braking index greater than three. For\nconventional neutron star and low mass quark star candidates, the inferred\nellipticities derived by the observed braking index are obviously much larger\nthan the theoretical estimated maximum value.

Core creation is\nregarded as one of the most promising solutions to potential issues faced by\nthe lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmology on small scales. For example,\nthe reduced dynamical mass enclosed by cores can explain the low rotational\nvelocities measured for nearby dwarf galaxies, thus possibly lifting the\nseeming contradiction with the LambdaCDM expectations (the so-called \"too big\nto fail\" problem). Here we test core creation as a solution of cosmological\nissues by using a sample of dwarfs with measurements of their atomic hydrogen\n(HI) kinematics extending to large radii. Using the NIHAO hydrodynamical\nsimulation as an example, we show that core creation can successfully reproduce\nthe kinematics of dwarfs with small kinematic radii, R <~ 1.5 kpc.

Additionally, L(7.7)/L(IR) is significantly\nlower in the youngest quartile of our sample (ages of 500 Myr) compared to\nolder galaxies, which may be a result of the delayed production of PAHs by AGB\nstars.

Rare low-metallicity star\nformation during galaxy assembly can produce more detected compact binaries\nthan typical star formation. Using detailed simulations of galaxy and chemical\nevolution, we determine how sensitively the compact binary populations of\ngalaxies with similar present-day appearance depend on the details of their\nassembly.

Such quiet star formation across the giant disk is obtained in a\ndisk model calibrated for the Milky Way, but with an angular momentum\napproximately 20 times larger.

We present a\nscattering mitigation framework for radio imaging with very long baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI) that partially overcomes this limitation. Our framework,\n\"stochastic optics,\" derives from a simplification of strong interstellar\nscattering to separate small-scale (\"diffractive\") effects from large-scale\n(\"refractive\") effects, thereby separating deterministic and random\ncontributions to the scattering. Stochastic optics extends traditional\nsynthesis imaging by simultaneously reconstructing an unscattered image and its\nrefractive perturbations. Its advantages over direct imaging come from\nutilizing the many deterministic properties of the scattering -- such as the\ntime-averaged \"blurring,\" polarization independence, and the deterministic\nevolution in frequency and time -- while still accounting for the stochastic\nimage distortions on large scales. These distortions are identified in the\nimage reconstructions through regularization by their time-averaged power\nspectrum. Using synthetic data, we show that this framework effectively removes\nthe blurring from diffractive scattering while reducing the spurious image\nfeatures from refractive scattering.

The radially\ncooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and\npeanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a\nvertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,\nvelocity dispersion that dominates this evolution. Assuming that early stellar\ndiscs heat rapidly as they form, then both the in-plane and vertical random\nmotions correlate with stellar age and chemistry, leading to different density\ndistributions for metal-rich and metal-poor stars.

(Further results with\n  application to a set of ALMA and ATCA data) Abstract: The matched filter (MF) is one of the most popular and reliable techniques to\nthe detect signals of known structure and amplitude smaller than the level of\nthe contaminating noise. Under the assumption of stationary Gaussian noise, MF\nmaximizes the probability of detection subject to a constant probability of\nfalse detection or false alarm (PFA). This property relies upon a priori\nknowledge of the position of the searched signals, which is usually not\navailable. Recently, it has been shown that when applied in its standard form,\nMF may severely underestimate the PFA. As a consequence the statistical\nsignificance of features that belong to noise is overestimated and the\nresulting detections are actually spurious. For this reason, an alternative\nmethod of computing the PFA has been proposed that is based on the probability\ndensity function (PDF) of the peaks of an isotropic Gaussian random field. In\nthis paper we further develop this method. In particular, we discuss the\nstatistical meaning of the PFA and show that, although useful as a preliminary\nstep in a detection procedure, it is not able to quantify the actual\nreliability of a specific detection. For this reason, a new quantity is\nintroduced called the specific probability of false alarm (SPFA), which is able\nto carry out this computation. We show how this method works in targeted\nsimulations and apply it to a few interferometric maps taken with the Atacama\nLarge Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Australia Telescope Compact\nArray (ATCA). We select a few potential new point sources and assign an\naccurate detection reliability to these sources. \n\n"}

Here we present an application of such a method, called\none-class support vector machines (OCSVM), to search for anomalous patterns\namong sources preselected from the mid-infrared AllWISE catalogue covering the\nwhole sky. To create a model of expected data we train the algorithm on a set\nof objects with spectroscopic identifications from the SDSS DR13 database,\npresent also in AllWISE. OCSVM detects as anomalous those sources whose\npatterns - WISE photometric measurements in this case - are inconsistent with\nthe model.

However, this can only be achieved if both the instrumental\nspectral response and the stellar spectrum can be determined to a relative\nprecision of <= 1e-4 between adjacent spectral channels. Absolute flux\ncalibration is not required, and the method is insensitive to the strong\nbroadband variability of the host star.

A sizeable fraction of the total C2H\nline emission is detected from the r~1.3kpc starburst (SB) ring. However, the\nbrightest C2H emission originates from a r~200pc off-centered circumnuclear\ndisk (CND), where evidence of a molecular outflow has been previously found in\nother molecular tracers imaged by ALMA. We also detect significant emission\nthat connects the CND with the outer disk. We derived the fractional abundances\nof C2H (X(C2H)) assuming LTE conditions. Our estimates range from X(C2H)~a few\n10^-8 in the SB ring up to X(C2H)~ a few 10^-7 in the outflow region.

We find an accurate\ncompleteness correction accounting for extended emission reveals a very steep\nfaint-end slope of the LF, alpha, down to luminosities of log10 L erg s^-1<\n41.5, applying both the 1/Vmax and maximum likelihood estimators.

This implies that LAEs may contribute more\nto the star-formation activity of the early Universe than previously thought -\nany additional interglactic medium correction would act to further boost the\nLya luminosities. Finally, assuming fiducial values for the escape of Lya and\nLyC radiation, and the clumpiness of the IGM, we integrated the maximum\nlikelihood LF at 5.00 < z < 6.64 and find we require only a small extrapolation\nbeyond the data (< 1 dex in L) for LAEs alone to maintain an ionised IGM at z ~\n6. \n\n"}

The main insight from this study is\nthat LTG bulges form a continuous sequence of increasing dmB with increasing\nM*T, M*B, stellar mass surface density S* and mass-weighted age and\nmetallicity: high-dmB bulges are the oldest, densest and most massive ones, and\nvice versa. Furthermore, we find that the bulge-to-disk age and metallicity\ncontrast, as well as the bulge-to-disk mass ratio increase with M*T, raising\nfrom, respectively, ~0 Gyr, 0 dex and 0.25 to ~3 Gyr, ~0.3 dex and 0.67 across\nthe mass range covered by our sample. Whereas gas excitation in lower-mass\nbulges is invariably dominated by star formation (SF), LINER- and\nSeyfert-specific emission-line ratios were exclusively documented in high-mass,\nhigh-S* bulges. The continuity both in the properties of LTG bulges themselves\nand in their age and metallicity contrast to their parent disks suggests that\nthese components evolve alongside in a concurrent process that leads to a\ncontinuum of physical and evolutionary characteristics. Our results are\nconsistent with a picture where bulge growth in LTGs is driven by a\nsuperposition of quick-early and slow-secular processes, the relative\nimportance of which increases with M*T. These processes, which presumably\ncombine in situ SF in the bulge and inward migration of material from the disk,\nare expected to lead to a non-homologous radial growth of S* and a trend for an\nincreasing Sersic index with increasing galaxy mass. \n\n"}

Unlike most other\nwork, we use a model-free approach based on the relative polar image angles of\nquads, and their position in 3D space with respect to the Fundamental Surface\nof Quads. The FSQ is defined by quads produced by elliptical lenses.

The result is unchanged even when subhalo masses are\nincreased by a factor of ten, and the most optimistic lensing selection bias is\napplied. We then produce quads from galaxies created using two components,\nrepresenting baryons and dark matter. The transition from the mass being\ndominated by baryons in inner radii to being dominated by dark matter in outer\nradii can carry with it asymmetries, which would affect relative image angles.\nWe run preliminary experiments using lenses with two elliptical mass components\nwith nonidentical axis ratios and position angles, perturbations from\nellipticity in the form of nonzero Fourier coefficients $a_4$ and $a_6$, and\nartificially offset ellipse centers as a proxy for asymmetry at image radii.

Using\nthe new parallax we find that its absolute $J$-band magnitude is ~0.4 mag\nfainter than equivalent-type field brown dwarfs, suggesting that the binary\nhypothesis is unlikely. The fundamental properties of 2MASS J13243553+6358281\nfollow the spectral type sequence of other known high-likelihood members of the\nAB Doradus moving group. The effective temperature of 2MASS J13243553+6358281\nprovides the first precise constraint on the L/T transition at a known young\nage, and indicates that it happens at a temperature of ~1150 K at ~150 Myr,\ncompared to ~1250 K for field brown dwarfs. \n\n"}

We present new VLA HI observations that reveal the cold gas\nkinematics along the minor axis in unprecedented detail. This includes the\ndetection of HI up to 10 kpc along the minor axis toward the South and beyond 5\nkpc to the North. A surprising aspect of these observations is that the\nline-of-sight HI velocity decreases substantially from about 120 km/s to 50\nkm/s from 1.5 to 10 kpc off the midplane. The velocity profile is not\nconsistent with the HI gas cooling from the hot wind. We demonstrate that the\nvelocity decrease is substantially greater than the deceleration expected from\ngravitational forces alone. If the HI consists of a continuous population of\ncold clouds, some additional drag force must be present, and the magnitude of\nthe drag force places a joint constraint on the ratio of the ambient medium to\nthe typical cloud size and density. We also show that the HI kinematics are\ninconsistent with a simple conical outflow centered on the nucleus, but instead\nrequire the more widespread launch of the HI over the ~1 kpc extent of the\nstarburst region. Regardless of the launch mechanism for the HI gas, the\nobserved velocity decrease along the minor axis is sufficiently great that the\nHI may not escape the halo of M82.

With strong, (mostly) double-peaked Lyman Alpha\nprofiles, these galaxies allow us to observe Mg II in the limit of low H I\ncolumn density. We find strong Mg II emission and little-to-no absorption.

The colors of optical SETI Abstract: It has recently been argued from a laser engineering point of view that there\nare only a few magic colors for optical SETI.

Next best choices would be\nthe sum frequency and/or second harmonic generation of Nd:YAG and Nd:YLF laser\nlines, 393.8 nm (near Fraunhofer CaK), 656.5 nm (H$\\alpha$) and 589.1 nm\n(NaD2). In this paper, we examine the interstellar extinction, atmospheric\ntransparency and scintillation, as well as noise conditions for these laser\nlines. For strong signals, we find that optical wavelengths are optimal for\ndistances $d\\lesssim\\,$kpc. Nd:YAG at $\\lambda=1{,}064\\,$nm is a similarly good\nchoice, within a factor of two, under most conditions and out to\n$d\\lesssim3\\,$kpc.

All of these characteristics are consistent\nwith models of self-scattering of submillimeter-wave emission from an optically\nthin inclined disk. The distribution of the polarization position angles across\nthe disk reveals that while the average orientation is along the minor axis,\nthe polarization orientations show a significant spread in angles; this can\nalso be explained by models of pure scattering. We compare the polarization\nwith that of the Class I/II source HL Tau. A comparison of cuts of the\npolarization fraction across the major and minor axes of both sources reveals\nthat IM Lup has a substantially higher polarization fraction than HL Tau toward\nthe center of the disk. This enhanced polarization fraction could be due a\nnumber of factors, including higher optical depth in HL Tau, or scattering by\nlarger dust grains in the more evolved IM Lup disk.

We have determined the densities of the planets Kepler-9b and 9c to\nthe very precise values of rho_b = 0.439 +/-0.023 g/cm3 and rho_c = 0.322 +/-\n0.017 g/cm3. Our analysis reveals that Kepler-9c will stop transiting in about\n30 years. This results from strong dynamical interactions between Kepler-9b and\n9c, near 2:1 resonance, that leads to a periodic change in inclination. Over\nthe next 30 years the inclination of Kepler-9c (-9b) will decrease (increase)\nslowly. This should be measurable by a substantial decrease (increase) in the\ntransit duration, in as soon as a few years' time. Observations that contradict\nthis prediction might indicate the presence of additional objects. If this\nprediction proves true, this behaviour opens up a unique chance to scan the\ndifferent latitudes of a star. \n\n"}

However, previous afterglow modeling studies\nwere based on a simplified assumption that the acceleration efficiency is\nextremely high, i.e. all electrons in the shock are accelerated as a nonthermal\npopulation. This affects the estimate of the minimum electron energy and hence\n$\\nu_m$, the peak frequency of the afterglow spectrum. Here we present Bayesian\nfitting to the observed data with a more natural electron energy distribution,\nin which the acceleration efficiency is a free parameter. Interestingly, the\nmaximum likelihood solutions are found with radio flux below $\\nu_m$ in the\nearly phase, in contrast to previous studies that found the radio frequency\nalways above $\\nu_m$. Therefore the $\\nu_m$ passage through the radio band\ncould have been clearly detected for GW170817, if sufficient low-frequency\nradio data had been taken in early time.

We\nmodel internal and external Faraday depolarization at small scales and assume a\nfrequency independent depolarization. It is found that the internal and\nexternal Faraday depolarization becomes comparable inside the disk and the\ndispersion of Faraday depth becomes about 4rad/m^{2} for face-on view and\n40rad/m2 for edge-on view, respectively. The internal depolarization becomes\nineffective in the halo.

We compare the rates of stellar captures in galactic nuclei\ncontaining a binary to those of galaxies with a single SMBH.

Only in triaxial systems both the\nbinary hardening rates and the capture rates remain sufficiently high during\nthe entire evolution. We find that the hardening rate is not influenced by star\ncaptures, nor does it depend on eccentricity; however, it is higher when the\ndifference between the black hole masses is greater.

At the end of two outbursts the\nsystem was seen to go through a phase of lower brightness, characterized by an\nout-of-eclipse level ~15 per cent lower than the typical quiescent level and by\nthe fairly symmetric eclipse of a compact source at disc centre with little\nevidence of a bright spot at disc rim.

The residuals with respect to the linear\nephemeris are well described by a sinusoid of amplitude 1.2 minutes and period\n\\~4 years and are possibly related to a solar-like magnetic activity cycle in\nthe secondary star. Eclipse phases of the compact central source and of the\nbright spot were used to derive the geometry of the binary.

In the island part\nof the color-color diagram (corresponding to the hardest energy spectra) the\npower spectrum of 4U 1728-34 shows several features such as a band-limited\nnoise component present up to a few tens of Hz, a low frequency quasi-periodic\noscillation (LFQPO) at frequencies between 20 and 40 Hz, a peaked noise\ncomponent around 100 Hz, and one or two QPOs at kHz frequencies.

This\nis thought to be the result of nongravitational processes influencing the\nphysical state of the ICM. In this paper, we investigate whether heating by a\ncentral AGN can explain the distribution of excess entropy as a function of\nradius. The AGN is assumed to inject buoyant bubbles into the ICM, which heat\nthe ambient medium by doing pdV work as they rise and expand. Several authors\nhave suggested that this \"effervescent heating\" mechanism could allow the\ncentral regions of clusters to avoid the ``cooling catastrophe''.

It has been argued that quasar lifetimes may therefore be\ninferred from their clustering length, which determines the typical mass of the\nquasar host. Here we point out that the relationship between the mass of the\nblack-hole and the circular velocity of its host dark-matter halo is more\nfundamental to the determination of the clustering length. In particular, the\nclustering length observed in the 2dF quasar redshift survey is consistent with\nthe galactic halo - black-hole relation observed in local galaxies, provided\nthat quasars shine at ~10-100% of their Eddington luminosity. The slow\nevolution of the clustering length with redshift inferred in the 2dF quasar\nsurvey favors a black-hole mass whose redshift-independent scaling is with halo\ncircular velocity, rather than halo mass. These results are independent from\nobservations of the number counts of bright quasars which may be used to\ndetermine the quasar lifetime and its dependence on redshift. We show that if\nquasar activity results from galaxy mergers, then the number counts of quasars\nimply an episodic quasar lifetime that is set by the dynamical time of the host\ngalaxy rather than by the Salpeter time.

Similar arguments lead to bounds on the mass of\nthe companion star immediately before its supernova: 3+/-1 Msun. The result is\na coherent scenario for the formation of the observed binary. After the first\nsupernova explosion, the neutron star that would eventually become the observed\npulsar was in a Be/X-ray type binary system with a companion of at least 10--12\nMsun.

Gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs) provide a large flux of gamma-rays that Compton scatter and create a\ncharge separation in the gas because the electrons are displaced from the\npositive ions. The electric field easily exceeds the breakdown value of ~1 V\nm^-1 over distances of order 0.1 AU. The energy in a giant lightning discharge\nexceeds a terrestrial lightning flash by a factor of ~10^12. The predicted\npost-burst emission of gamma-rays from accretion into the newly formed black\nhole or spin-down of the magnetar is sufficiently intense to cause a lightning\nstorm in the nebula that lasts for days and is more probable than the GRB\nbecause the radiation is beamed into a larger solid angle. The giant outbursts\nfrom nearby soft gamma-ray repeater sources (SGRs) are also capable of causing\ngiant lightning discharges.

However, it has been unclear whether the\ncompact UV nuclear sources present in many LINERs are clusters of massive\nstars, rather than being directly related to the accretion process. We have\nused HST to monitor the UV variability of a sample of 17 galaxies with LINER\nnuclei and compact nuclear UV sources. Fifteen of the 17 galaxies were observed\nmore than once, with two to five epochs per galaxy, spanning up to a year. We\ndetect significant variability in most of the sample, with peak-to-peak\namplitudes from a few percent to 50%. In most cases, correlated variations are\nseen in two independent bands (F250W and F330W). Comparison to previous UV\nmeasurements indicates, for many objects, long-term variations by factors of a\nfew over decade timescales. Variability is detected in LINERs with and without\ndetected compact radio cores, in LINERs that have broad H-alpha wings detected\nin their optical spectra (``LINER 1's''), and in those that do not (``LINER\n2s''). This variability demonstrates the existence of a non-stellar component\nin the UV continuum of all types, and sets a lower limit to the luminosity of\nthis component. We note a trend in the UV color (F250W/F330W) with spectral\ntype - LINER 1s tend to be bluer than LINER 2s. This trend may indicate a link\nbetween the shape of the nonstellar continuum and the presence or the\nvisibility of a broad-line region.

We\nclearly detected rapid time variability on a time scale of about 1000 s from\nthe light curve above 2 keV. The excess variance of the time variability\n(sigma2_RMS) is calculated to be ~0.12, and the periodogram of the light curve\nis well represented by a power law function with a slope of 1.75. In contrast\nwith previous results from Seyfert 2 nuclei, these variability characteristics\nare consistent with those of Seyfert 1 galaxies. This consistency suggests that\nNGC 6300 has a similar black hole mass and accretion properties as Seyfert 1\ngalaxies. Using the relation between time variability and central black hole\nmass by Hayashida et al. (1998), the black hole mass of NGC 6300 is estimated\nto be ~2.8x10^5 Mo.

In particular, we have examined the cases of L_cut =\nf_cut L_box with f_cut=1 (i.e. no truncation), 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4. In common with\nprevious studies, we find that the suppression of long wavelength perturbations\nreduces the strength of clustering, as measured by a suppression of the 2-point\ncorrelation function xi(r), and reduces the numbers of the most massive haloes,\nas reflected in the depletion of the high mass end of the mass function n(M).\nInterestingly, we find that truncation has little impact on the internal\nproperties of haloes. The masses of high mass haloes decrease in a systematic\nmanner as L_cut is reduced, but the distribution of concentrations is\nunaffected. On the other hand, the median spin parameter is ~50% lower in runs\nwith f_cut<1.

The groups and clusters that we study are drawn from the C4\ncatalogue of Miller et al.

The mass-dependent\ndiffuse light fraction is governed primarily by the empirical fact that the\nmass-to-light ratio in galaxy halos must vary as a function of halo mass.\nGalaxy halos have little diffuse light because they accrete most of their mass\nin small subhalos that themselves have high mass-to-light ratios; stellar halos\naround galaxies are built primarily from disrupted dwarf-irregular-type\ngalaxies with M*~10^8.5 M_sun.

The model predicts\nremarkably well all the main observed temporal and spectral properties of GRBs.\nIts success strongly suggests that GRBs are $\\gamma$ ray tomography pictures of\nDSRs in galaxies at cosmological distances with unprecedented resolution: A\ntime resolution of $dt\\sim 1~ms$ in a GRB can resolve stars at a Hubble\ndistance which are separated by only $D\\sim 10^{10}cm$. This is equivalent to\nthe resolving power of an optical telescope with a diameter larger than one\nAstronomical Unit! \n\n"}

The effects of the suppression of galaxy\nnumbers in voids, and their enhancement in regions of high density, are\nconsidered, independently and in combination. We compare results from numerical\nsimulations with the predictions of simple analytic models. We find that the\nbias is generally scale-dependent, so that the shape of the galaxy power\nspectrum differs from that of the underlying mass distribution. The degree of\nbias is always a monotonic function of scale, tending to an asymptotic value on\nscales where the density fluctuations are linear.

By\ncomparing the observed and simulated metallicity distributions of Galactic\nglobular clusters and halo field stars, we estimate the level of fragmentation\nin the collapsing proto-Galaxy.

These can be\nproduced prior to big bang nucleosynthesis by the Z' interactions, leading to a\nfaster expansion rate and too much ^4He. We quantify the constraints on the Z'\nproperties from nucleosynthesis for Z' couplings motivated by a class of E_6\nmodels parametrized by an angle theta_E6. The rate for the annihilation of\nthree approximately massless right-handed neutrinos into other particle pairs\nthrough the Z' channel is calculated. The decoupling temperature, which is\nhigher than that of ordinary left-handed neutrinos due to the large Z' mass, is\nevaluated, and the equivalent number of new doublet neutrinos Delta N_nu is\nobtained numerically as a function of the Z' mass and couplings for a variety\nof assumptions concerning the Z-Z' mixing angle and the quark-hadron transition\ntemperature T_c. Except near the values of theta_E6 for which the Z' decouples\nfrom the right-handed neutrinos, the Z' mass and mixing constraints from\nnucleosynthesis are much more stringent than the existing laboratory limits\nfrom searches for direct production or from precision electroweak data, and are\ncomparable to the ranges that may ultimately be probed at proposed colliders.\nFor the case T_c = 150 MeV with the theoretically favored range of Z-Z'\nmixings, Delta N_nu < 0.3 for M_Z' > 4.3 TeV for any value of theta_E6. Larger\nmixing or larger T_c often lead to unacceptably large Delta N_nu except near\nthe nu_R decoupling limit. \n\n"}

For such a braneworld cosmology, the difficulty of\njustifying some preferred initial conditions inevitably arises. The various\nproposals for inflation restricted to the brane only partially explain the\nhomogeneity and isotropy of the resulting braneworld universe because the\nhomogeneity and isotropy of the bulk must be assumed. We propose a mechanism by\nwhich a brane surrounded by AdS space arises naturally so that the homogeneity\nand isotropy of both the brane and the bulk are guaranteed. We postulate an\ninitial false vacuum phase of (4+1)-dimensional Minkowski or de Sitter space\nsubsequently decaying to a true vacuum of anti-de Sitter space, assumed\ndiscretely degenerate. This decay takes place through bubble nucleation. When\ntwo bubbles of the true AdS vacuum collide, a brane (or domain wall) inevitably\nforms between the two AdS phases. We live on this brane. The SO(3,1) symmetry\nof the collision geometry ensures the three-dimensional spatial homogeneity and\nisotropy of the universe on the brane as well as of the bulk. In the\nsemi-classical limit, this symmetry is exact. We sketch how the leading quantum\ncorrections translate into cosmological perturbations. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0403203", "contents": "Title: An Inflationary Model in String Theory Abstract: We construct a model of inflation in string theory after carefully taking\ninto account moduli stabilization. The setting is a warped compactification of\nType IIB string theory in the presence of D3 and anti-D3-branes. The inflaton\nis the position of a D3-brane in the internal space. By suitably adjusting\nfluxes and the location of symmetrically placed anti-D3-branes, we show that at\na point of enhanced symmetry, the inflaton potential V can have a broad\nmaximum, satisfying the condition V''/V << 1 in Planck units. On starting close\nto the top of this potential the slow-roll conditions can be met. Observational\nconstraints impose significant restrictions. As a first pass we show that these\ncan be satisfied and determine the important scales in the compactification to\nwithin an order of magnitude. One robust feature is that the scale of inflation\nis low, H = O(10^{10}) GeV. Removing the observational constraints makes it\nmuch easier to construct a slow-roll inflationary model. Generalizations and\nconsequences including the possibility of eternal inflation are also discussed.\nA more careful study, including explicit constructions of the model in string\ntheory, is left for the future. \n\n"}

We propose methods to detect a\ngranular structure by the single-event intensity interferometry. We find that\nthe correlation function from a chaotic source of granular droplets exhibits\nlarge fluctuations, with maxima and minima at relative momenta which depend on\nthe relative coordinates of the droplet centers. The presence of this type of\nmaxima and minima of a single-event correlation function at many relative\nmomenta is a signature for a granular structure and a first-order QCD phase\ntransition. We further observe that the Fourier transform of the correlation\nfunction of a granular structure exhibits maxima at the relative spatial\ncoordinates of the droplet centers, which can provide another signature of the\ngranular structure. \n\n"}

To\nreliably predict astrophysical signatures of color superconductivity, a better\nunderstanding of the role of the star's magnetic field in the color\nsuperconducting phase that realizes in the core is required. This paper is an\ninitial step in that direction. The field scales at which the different\nmagnetic phases of a color superconductor with three quark flavors can be\nrealized are investigated. Coming from weak to strong fields, the system\nundergoes first a symmetry transmutation from a Color-Flavor-Locked (CFL) phase\nto a Magnetic-CFL (MCFL) phase, and then a phase transition from the MCFL phase\nto the Paramagnetic-CFL (PCFL) phase. The low-energy effective theory for the\nexcitations of the diquark condensate in the presence of a magnetic field is\nderived using a covariant representation that takes into account all the\nLorentz structures contributing at low energy. The field-induced masses of the\ncharged mesons and the threshold field at which the CFL $\\to$ MCFL symmetry\ntransmutation occurs are obtained in the framework of this low-energy effective\ntheory. The relevance of the different magnetic phases for the physics of\ncompact stars is discussed. \n\n"}

The principal distortions of invisibility\nare due to reflections and time delays. Reflections can be made exponentially\nsmall for devices that are large in comparison with the wavelength of light.\nTime delays are unavoidable and will result in wave-front dislocations. This\npaper considers invisibility devices based on optical conformal mapping. The\npaper shows that the time delays do not depend on the directions and impact\nparameters of incident light rays, although the refractive-index profile of any\nconformal invisibility device is necessarily asymmetric. The distortions of\nimages are thus uniform, which reduces the risk of detection.
