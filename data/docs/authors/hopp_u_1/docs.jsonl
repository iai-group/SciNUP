Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts. An increase in luminosity below z =\n0.06 is also seen.

The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO\n137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses. Therefore, stripping of\nthe ISM not only contributes to the ICM, but also adds to the intracluster\nstellar light through subsequent star formation.

The VL\nrelation at I- and K-bands is independent of surface brightness, size and light\nconcentration. The log-slope of the I- and K-band RL relations is a strong\nfunction of morphology and varies from 0.25 to 0.5. The average dispersion\nsigma_ln(RL) decreases from 0.33 at I-band to 0.29 at K, likely due to the\n2MASS selection bias against lower surface brightness galaxies.

We begin\nin this paper with a derivation of the self-force on a compact object moving in\nthe background spacetime of a supermassive black hole. The EFT approach\nutilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are the\nsize of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the background\nspacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as an\neffective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. Ultraviolet\ndivergences are regularized using Hadamard's {\\it partie finie} to isolate the\nnon-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part. The latter is\nconstructed from a momentum space representation for the graviton retarded\npropagator and is evaluated using dimensional regularization in which only\nlogarithmic divergences are relevant for renormalizing the parameters of the\ntheory. As a first important application of this framework we explicitly derive\nthe first order self-force given by Mino, Sasaki, Tanaka, Quinn and Wald. Going\nbeyond the point particle approximation, to account for the finite size of the\nobject, we demonstrate that for extreme mass ratio inspirals the motion of a\ncompact object is affected by tidally induced moments at $O(\\epsilon^4)$, in\nthe form of an Effacement Principle. The relatively large radius-to-mass ratio\nof a white dwarf star allows for these effects to be enhanced until the white\ndwarf becomes tidally disrupted, a potentially $O(\\epsilon^2)$ process, or\nplunges into the supermassive black hole. This work provides a new foundation\nfor further exploration of higher order self force corrections, gravitational\nradiation and spinning compact objects. \n\n"}

Abstract: Most multi-planetary systems are characterized by hot-Jupiters close to their\ncentral star, moving on eccentric orbits. From a dynamical point of view,\ncompact multi-planetary systems form a specific class of the general N-body\nproblem (where N>=3). Moreover, extrasolar planets are found in prograde orbits\nabout their host star, and often in mean motion resonances (MMR). In a first\nstep, we study theoretically a new stabilizing mechanism suitable for compact\ntwo-planet systems. This mechanism involves counter-revolving orbits forming a\nretrograde MMR. In a second step, we investigate the feasibility of planetary\nsystems hosting counter-revolving planets. Dynamical stability, observations,\nand formation processes of these systems are analyzed and discussed. To\ncharacterize the dynamical behavior of multi-dimensional planetary systems, we\napply our technique of global dynamics analysis based on the MEGNO indicator\n(Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits) that provides the fine\nstructure of the phase space. In a few cases of possible counter-revolving\nconfigurations, we carry out new fits to the observations using the Pikaia\ngenetic algorithm.

The aim of this work is to propose a versatile and powerful method for\nspectral estimation on the sphere which can easily deal with non-stationarity,\nforegrounds and multiple experiments with various specifications. In this\npaper, we use needlets (wavelets) on the sphere to construct natural and\nefficient spectral estimators for partially observed and beamed CMB with non\nstationary noise. In the case of a single experiment, we compare this method\nwith Pseudo-$C_\\ell$ methods. The performance of the needlet spectral\nestimators (NSE) compares very favorably to the best Pseudo--$C_\\ell$\nestimators, over the whole multipole range. On simulations with a simple model\n(CMB + uncorrelated noise with known variance per pixel + mask), they perform\nuniformly better.

We demonstrate that close\nencounters between massive subhalos and galactic disks since z~1 should be\ncommon occurrences in LCDM models.

Starting with the toroidal compactification of the NS/NS sector\nin (D+d) dimensions, we first obtain an effective $D$-dimensional action, and\nthen compactify one of the $(D-1)$ spatial dimensions by introducing two\norbifold branes as its boundaries. By combining the Gauss-Codacci and Lanczos\nequations, we write down explicitly the general gravitational field equations\non each of the two branes, while using distribution theory we express the\nmatter field equations on the branes in terms of the discontinuities of the\nfirst derivatives of the matter fields. Afterwards, we address three important\nissues: (i) the hierarchy problem; (ii) the radion mass; and (iii) the\nlocalization of gravity, the 4-dimensional Newtonian effective potential and\nthe Yukawa corrections due to the gravitational high-order Kaluza-Klein (KK)\nmodes.

In\ncontrast, the observed behaviour in the optical band is complex (from 10$^2$ up\nto 10$^6$ s). We investigate the light curve behaviour in the context of the\nstandard forward/reverse shock model; associating the peak in the optical light\ncurve at $\\sim$450 s with the fireball deceleration time results in a Lorenz\nfactor $\\Gamma \\approx 350$ at this time. In contrast, the shallow optical\ndecay between 450 and 1500 s remains problematic, requiring a reverse shock\ncomponent whose typical frequency is above the optical band at the optical peak\ntime for it to be explained within the standard model. This predicts an\nincreasing flux density for the forward shock component until t $\\sim$ 4\n$\\times$ 10$^6$ s, inconsistent with the observed decay of the optical emission\nfrom t $\\sim$ 10$^4$ s.

However,\ntides can also be compressive. When the potential of two galaxies overlap, as\nhappens during a merger, fully compressive tides can develop and have a strong\nimpact on the dynamics of substructures such as star clusters or tidal dwarf\ngalaxies. Using N-body simulations of a large set of mergers, we noticed the\nimportance of these tidal modes at cluster scale. With a model of the Antennae\ngalaxies, we conclude that the positions and timescales of these tidal modes\nmatch the actual distribution of young clusters. A detailed study of the\nstatistics of the compressive tides shows a stunning correlation between this\npurely gravitational effect and the observed properties of the star clusters.\nIn this contribution, we introduce the concept of compressive tide and show its\nrelevance in the special case of the Antennae galaxies. We extend our\nconclusions to a broad range of parameters and discuss their implications on\nseveral critical points such as the infant mortality, multiple star formation\nepochs in clusters or the age distribution. \n\n"}

The origin of the radio emission is\nunclear,it could be due either to a jet, as in microquasars, or to the shock\nboundary between the Be star and a possible pulsar wind. We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before). We show that this result qualitatively\nand quantitatively agrees with the two-peak accretion/ejection model proposed\nin the past for LS I +61303. We conclude that the radio emission in LS I +61303\noriginates from a jet and suggest that the variable TeV emission comes from the\nusual Compton losses expected as an important by-product in the shock-in-jet\ntheory. \n\n"}

Here we address the comparison\nwith observations, and show how the TP-AGB recipe affects the performance of\nthe model in reproducing the colours and near-IR luminosities of high-redshift\ngalaxies. We find that the semi-analytic model with the TP-AGB better matches\nthe colour-magnitude and colour-colour relations at z ~ 2, both for\nnearly-passive and for star-forming galaxies. The model with TP-AGB produces\nstar-forming galaxies with red V-K colours, thus revising the unique\ninterpretation of high-redshift red objects as 'red & dead'. We also show that\nwithout the TP-AGB the semi-analytic model fails at reproducing the observed\ncolours, a situation that cannot be corrected by dust reddening. We also\nexplore the effect of nebular emission on the predicted colour-magnitude\nrelation of star-forming galaxies, to conclude that it does not play a\nsignificant role in reddening their colours, at least in the range of\nstar-formation rates covered by the model. Finally, the rest-frame K-band\nluminosity function at z ~ 2.5 is more luminous by almost 1 magnitude.

Simulations show that if octupolar field strongly dominates\nat the disc-magnetosphere boundary, then matter flows into the ring-like\noctupolar poles, forming ring-shape spots at the surface of the star above and\nbelow equator. The light-curves are complex and may have two peaks per period.\nIn case where the dipole field dominates, matter accretes in two ordered funnel\nstreams towards poles, however the polar spots are meridionally-elongated due\nto the action of the octupolar component. In the case when the fields are of\nsimilar strengths, both, polar and belt-like spots are present.

After\nentering the disc inner cavity, tidal interaction would cause the period ratios\nto increase from two but with the inner pair deviating less than the outer\npair, counter to what occurs in HD 40307. However, the relationship between\nthese pairs that occurs in HD 40307 might be produced if the resonance is\nimpulsively modified by an event like a close encounter shortly after the\nplanetary system decouples from the disc. We find this to be in principle\npossible for a small relative perturbation on the order of a few 1.d-3 but then\nwe find that evolution to the present system in a reasonable time is possible\nonly if the masses are significantly larger than the minimum masses and tidal\ndissipation is very effective. On the other hand we found that a system like HD\n40307 with minimum masses and more realistic tidal dissipation could be\nproduced if the eccentricity of the outermost planet was impulsively increased\nto about 0.15. The form of resonantly coupled tidal evolution we consider here\nis quite general and could be of greater significance for systems with inner\nplanets on significantly shorter orbital periods characteristic of for example\nCoRoT 7 b. \n\n"}

Usual approaches to compute them\nare based on the template fitting of observed spectral energy distributions\n(SED) and, thus, require multi-colour photometry. Here, we demonstrate that, in\ncases of widely used optical and near-infrared filters, K-corrections can be\nprecisely approximated as two-dimensional low-order polynomials of only two\nparameters: redshift and one observed colour.

Typically if the wavelength of the\nobservation is comparable to the Schwarzschild radius of lensing object,\ndiffraction leaves an observable imprint on the lensing signature. The\ncommissioning of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) over the next decade begs the\nquestion of whether it will become possible to follow up lensing events with\nradio observations because the SKA may have sufficient sensitivity to detect\nthe typical sources, giant stars in the bulge.

The distance between the 2, measured in\nthe HST/ACS image, is 0.495\" that, at the redshift of the source, corresponds\nto a projected separation of 2.46 kpc. A large (~1200 km/s) velocity offset\nbetween the narrow and broad components of Hbeta has been measured in three\ndifferent optical spectra from the VLT/VIMOS and Magellan/IMACS instruments.\nCID-42 is also the only X-ray source having in its X-ray spectra a strong\nredshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing an\ninverted P-Cygni profile. The Chandra and XMM data show that the absorption\nline is variable in energy by 500 eV over 4 years and that the absorber has to\nbe highly ionized, in order not to leave a signature in the soft X-ray\nspectrum.

Using galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey, we investigate the halo mass-luminosity relation (MLR) and the halo\nmass-stellar mass relation (MSR) of central galaxies. In particular, we focus\non the dependence of these scaling relations on the colour of the central\ngalaxy. We find that red central galaxies on average occupy more massive haloes\nthan blue central galaxies of the same luminosity. However, at fixed stellar\nmass there is no appreciable difference in the average halo mass of red and\nblue centrals, especially for M* $\\lsim$ 10^{10.5} h^{-2} Msun. This indicates\nthat stellar mass is a better indicator of halo mass than luminosity.\nNevertheless, we find that the scatter in halo masses at fixed stellar mass is\nnon-negligible for both red and blue centrals. It increases as a function of\nstellar mass for red centrals but shows a fairly constant behaviour for blue\ncentrals. We compare the scaling relations obtained in this paper with results\nfrom other independent studies of satellite kinematics, with results from a\nSDSS galaxy group catalog, from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements, and\nfrom subhalo abundance matching studies.

Mass is the most important parameter\nof a planet and can only be measured by observing the motion of the star around\nthe planet-star center of mass. A single image of a planet, however, does not\nprovide evidence that the planet is Earth mass or that it is in a habitable\nzone orbit. The planet's orbit, however, can be measured either by imaging the\nplanet at multiple epochs or by measuring the position of the star at multiple\nepochs by space-based astrometry. The measurement of an exo-planet's orbit by\ndirect imaging is complicated by a number of factors: (1) the inner working\nangle (IWA); (2) the apparent brightness of the planet depending on the orbital\nphase; (3) confusion arising from the presence of multiple planets; and (4) the\nplanet-star contrast.

Theoretical\nstudies of mass loss from the brightest stars derive significantly higher\nstellar-origin BH masses (30-80 Msun) than previously estimated for sub-solar\ncompositions.

In our specific model, the Lagrangian contains (i) the curvature\nscalar $R$ and the curvature pseudo-scalar $X$ linearly and quadratically\n(including an $RX$ term) and (ii) pieces quadratic in the torsion {\\it vector}\n$\\cal V$ and the torsion {\\it axial} vector $\\cal A$ (including a ${\\cal\nV}{\\cal A}$ term). We show generally that in quadratic PG models we have nearly\nthe same number of parity conserving terms (`world') and of parity violating\nterms (`shadow world'). This offers new perspectives in cosmology for the\ncoupling of gravity to matter and antimatter. Our specific model generalizes\nthe fairly realistic `torsion cosmologies' of Shie-Nester-Yo (2008) and Chen et\nal.\\ (2009). With a Friedman type ansatz for an orthonormal coframe and a\nLorentz connection, we derive the two field equations of PG in an explicit form\nand discuss their general structure in detail. In particular, the second field\nequation can be reduced to first order ordinary differential equations for the\ncurvature pieces $R(t)$ and $X(t)$. Including these along with certain\nrelations obtained from the first field equation and curvature definitions, we\npresent a first order system of equations suitable for numerical evaluation.\nThis is deferred to the second, numerical part of this paper. \n\n"}

The equation of\nstate, which takes into account the \\beta-equilibrium, the nuclear and the\nCoulomb interactions between the nuclei and the surrounding electrons, is\nobtained as a function of the compression by considering each atom constrained\nin a Wigner-Seitz cell. The contribution of quantum statistics, weak, nuclear,\nand electromagnetic interactions is obtained by the determination of the\nchemical potential of the Wigner-Seitz cell. The further contribution of the\ngeneral relativistic equilibrium of white dwarf matter is expressed by the\nsimple formula $\\sqrt{g_{00}}\\mu_{\\rm ws}$= constant, which links the chemical\npotential of the Wigner-Seitz cell $\\mu_{\\rm ws}$ with the general relativistic\ngravitational potential $g_{00}$ at each point of the configuration.

The GC surface density profile\naround the central massive elliptical galaxy, NGC 4874, is dominated at large\nradii by a population of IGCs that extend to the limit of our data (R<520 kpc).\nWe estimate that there are 47000+/-1600 (random) +4000/-5000 (systematic) IGCs\nout to this radius, and that they make up ~70% of the central GC system, making\nthis the largest GC system in the nearby Universe. Even including the GC\nsystems of other cluster galaxies, IGCs still make up ~30-45% of the GCs in the\ncluster core. Observational limits from previous studies of the intracluster\nlight (ICL) suggest that the IGC population has a high specific frequency.

Since period doubling\nwas observed only in Blazhko-modulated stars so far, the phenomenon can help in\nthe understanding of the modulation as well. Utilising the Florida-Budapest\nturbulent convective hydrodynamical code, we identified the phenomenon in\nradiative and convective models as well. A period-doubling cascade was also\nfollowed up to an eight-period solution confirming that the destabilisation of\nthe limit cycle is indeed the underlying phenomenon. Floquet stability roots\nwere calculated to investigate the possible causes and occurrences of the\nphenomenon. A two-dimensional diagnostic diagram was constructed to display the\nvarious resonances between the fundamental mode and the different overtones.\nCombining the two tools, we confirmed that the period-doubling instability is\ncaused by a 9:2 resonance between the 9th overtone and the fundamental mode.\nDestabilisation of the limit cycle by a resonance of a high-order mode is\npossible because the overtone is a strange mode.

In order to understand the origin of S0s\nin groups, we investigate numerically the morphological transformation of\nspirals into S0s through group-related physical processes. Our chemodynamical\nsimulations show that spirals in group environments can be strongly influenced\nby repetitive slow encounters with group member galaxies so that those with\nthin disks and prominent spiral arm structures can be transformed into S0s with\nthick disks and without prominent spiral arm structure. Such tidal interactions\ncan also trigger repetitive starbursts within the bulges of spirals and\nconsequently increase significantly the masses of their bulges. Owing to rapid\nconsumption of gas initially in spirals during the bulge growth, the S0s can\nbecome gas-poor. The S0s transformed from spirals in this way have young and\nmetal-rich stellar populations in the inner regions of their bulges. The\nsimulated S0s have lower maximum rotational velocities and flatter radial\nline-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles in comparison to their progenitor\nspirals.

Of the 38\nvisually-classified S0 galaxies, with masses ranging from log(M_*)~10-11, we\ndetect only one in the NUV channel, a strongly star-forming S0 that is the\nbrightest UV source with a measured redshift placing it in SG1120.

This\nassumption is challenged by the growing evidence from optical and X-ray\nobservations that the total baryon mass fraction increases towards rich\nclusters. In this context, we investigate the dependence of stellar, and total\nbaryon mass fractions as a function of mass. To do so, we used a subsample of\nnineteen clusters extracted from the X-ray flux limited sample HIFLUGCS that\nhave available DR-7 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. From the optical\nanalysis we derived the stellar masses. Using XMM-Newton we derived the gas\nmasses. Then, adopting a scaling relation we estimate the total masses. Adding\nthe gas and the stellar mass fractions we obtain the total baryonic content\nthat we find to increase with cluster mass, reaching 7-year Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe (WMAP-7) prediction for clusters with M_500 = 1.6 x 10^{15}\nM_sun.

This result suggests a difference in the number of\nstars formed per unit of halo mass, though with a large scatter for low-mass\nsystems.

It\nfollows immediately that the dependence of the stellar mass fraction on total\nmass results in an increase of the mass-to-light ratio from lower to higher\nmass systems.

This virial state is a consequence of the low gas fractions within\nthe subclusters, caused by the accretion of gas onto the stars and the\naccretion-induced shrinkage of the subclusters. Because the subclusters are\ngas-poor, up to a length scale of 0.1-0.2 pc at the end of the simulation, they\nare only weakly affected by gas expulsion. The fraction of subclusters that\nreaches the high density required to evolve to a gas-poor state increases with\nthe density of the star-forming region.

In each of 6 redshift bins, the cosmological\ndistances will be measured to 3% precision via BAO, and redshift-space\ndistortions will be used to constrain structure growth to 6% precision. In the\nGA program, radial velocities and chemical abundances of stars in the Milky Way\nand M31 will be used to infer the past assembly histories of spiral galaxies\nand the structure of their dark matter halos.

One important question is\nwhether the chemical abundances in this star reflect the chemical composition\nof the gas cloud from which it was formed or if they have been severely\naffected by other processes, such as dust-gas winnowing. Aims: We measure or\nprovide an upper limit to the abundance of the volatile element sulphur, which\ncan help to discriminate between the two scenarios. Methods: We observed HE\n1327-2326 with the high resolution infra-red spectrograph CRIRES at the VLT to\nobserve the S I lines of Multiplet 3 at 1045 nm. Results: We do not detect the\nS I line. A 3sigma$upper limit on the equivalent width (EW) of any line in our\nspectrum is EW<0.66 pm. Using either one-dimensional static or\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamical model-atmospheres, this translates into a\nrobust upper limit of [S/H]<-2.6. Conclusions: This upper limit does not\nprovide conclusive evidence for or against dust-gas winnowing, and the evidence\ncoming from other elements (e.g., Na and Ti) is also inconclusive or\ncontradictory. The formation of dust in the atmosphere versus an origin of the\nmetals in a metal-poor supernova with extensive \"fall-back\" are not mutually\nexclusive. It is possible that dust formation distorts the peculiar abundance\npattern created by a supernova with fall-back, thus the abundance ratios in HE\n1327-2326 may be used to constrain the properties of the supernova(e) that\nproduced its metals, but with some caution. \n\n"}

In these\n\\eta-parametrised asymmetric dark matter models (\\eta-ADM), the dark matter\nparticles have an annihilation cross section close to the weak interaction\ncross section, and a value of \\eta-dark matter asymmetry close to the baryon\nasymmetry \\eta_B.

Here we employ ray-tracing N-body simulations in which we manually\nsteepen the density profile of each dark matter halo, mimicking the cooling and\nconcentration of baryons into dark matter potential wells.

We then study the impact of the halo concentration increase on the\npeak counts, and find the following. (i) Low peaks (with convergence 0.02 <\nkappa_peak < 0.08), remain nearly unaffected. These peaks are created by a\nconstellation of several halos with low masses (10^12-10^13 M_sun) and large\nangular offsets from the peak center (> 0.5 R_vir); as a result, they are\ninsensitive to the central halo density profiles.

An important condition, however, is\nthat the initial vacuum cannot produce observers from rare fluctuations\n(Boltzmann brains). Here we consider more general initial conditions where\nmultiple vacua have nonzero initial probability.

We identify general criteria and apply\nthem to two nontrivial examples of such initial probability distributions. The\nHartle-Hawking state is superexponentially dominated by the vacuum with\nsmallest positive cosmological constant, so one might expect that other initial\nvacua can be neglected; but in fact, their inclusion drastically narrows the\nrange of theory parameters for which an arrow of time is predicted.

We now have a sample of 1987A-like SNe that arise from the core\ncollapse (CC) of BSGs.

Both\nindirect and direct metallicity measurements of 13 BSG SN host galaxies are\npresented, and compared to those of other CC SN types. Indirect measurements\nare based on the known luminosity-metallicity relation and on published\nmetallicity gradients of spiral galaxies. To provide direct estimates based on\nstrong line diagnostics, we obtained spectra of each BSG SN host both at the SN\nexplosion site and at the positions of other HII regions. Continuum-subtracted\nHa images allowed us to quantify the association between BSG SNe and\nstar-forming regions. BSG SNe explode either in low-luminosity galaxies or at\nlarge distances from the nuclei of luminous hosts. Therefore, their indirectly\nmeasured metallicities are typically lower than those of SNe IIP and Ibc. This\nis confirmed by the direct estimates, which show slightly sub-solar values\n(12+log(O/H)=8.3-8.4 dex), similar to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC),\nwhere SN 1987A exploded.

Hydrostatic mass is\none of the most common methods for estimating the masses of individual galaxy\nclusters, which suffer from biases due to departures from hydrostatic\nequilibrium. Using a large, mass-limited sample of massive galaxy clusters from\na high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, in this work we show\nthat in addition to turbulent and bulk gas velocities, acceleration of gas\nintroduces biases in the hydrostatic mass estimate of galaxy clusters. In\nunrelaxed clusters, the acceleration bias is comparable to the bias due to\nnon-thermal pressure associated with merger-induced turbulent and bulk gas\nmotions. In relaxed clusters, the mean mass bias due to acceleration is small\n(<3%), but the scatter in the mass bias can be reduced by accounting for gas\nacceleration. Additionally, this acceleration bias is greater in the outskirts\nof higher redshift clusters where mergers are more frequent and clusters are\naccreting more rapidly. Since gas acceleration cannot be observed directly, it\nintroduces an irreducible bias for hydrostatic mass estimates.

This paper presents the first attempt to use solely\nobservational peculiar velocities to constrain cosmological simulations of the\nnearby universe. In order to set up Initial Conditions, a Reverse Zel'dovich\nApproximation (RZA) is used to displace constraints from their positions at z=0\nto their precursors' locations at higher redshifts. An additional new feature\nreplaces original observed radial peculiar velocity vectors by their full 3D\nreconstructions provided by the Wiener-Filter (WF) estimator. Subsequently, the\nConstrained Realization of Gaussian fields technique (CR) is applied to build\nvarious realizations of the Initial Conditions. The WF/RZA/CR method is first\ntested on realistic mock catalogs built from a reference simulation similar to\nthe Local Universe. These mocks include errors on peculiar velocities, on\ndata-point positions and a large continuous zone devoid of data in order to\nmimic galactic extinction. Large scale structures are recovered with a typical\naccuracy of 5 Megaparsecs/h in position, the best realizations reaching a 2-3\nMpc/h precision, the limit imposed by the RZA linear theory.

It is\nalso known for hosting a bright galaxy, NGC 1400, with a large radial velocity\n(1200 km s$^{-1}$) with respect to the group center. Previous ROSAT X-ray\nobservations revealed an extended region of enhanced surface brightness just\neastward of NGC 1400.

Abstract: If the B-mode signal in the CMB polarization seen by the BICEP2 experiment is\nconfirmed, it has dramatic implications for models of inflation. The result is\nalso in tension with Planck limits on standard inflationary models. It is\ntherefore important to investigate whether this signal can arise from\nalternative sources. If so, this could lessen the pressure on inflationary\nmodels and the tension with Planck data. We investigate whether vector and\ntensor modes from primordial magnetic fields can explain the signal. We find\nthat in principle, magnetic fields generated during inflation can indeed\nproduce the required B-mode, for a suitable range of energy scales of\ninflation. In this case, the primordial gravitational wave amplitude is\nnegligible, so that there is no tension with Planck and no problems posed for\ncurrent inflationary models. However, the simplest magnetic model is in tension\nwith Planck limits on non-Gaussianity in the trispectrum. It may be possible to\nfine-tune the magnetogenesis model so that this non-Gaussianity is suppressed.\nAlternatively, a weaker magnetic field can pass the non-Gaussianity constraints\nand allow the primordial tensor mode to be reduced to r~0.09, thus removing the\ntension with Planck data and alleviating the problems with simple inflationary\nmodels. \n\n"}

To investigate this\ncorrelation, we use a phenomenological model that successfully describes star\nformation rates, luminosities and stellar masses of star forming galaxies,\napplying it to GRB production. We predict luminosities, stellar masses, and\nmetallicities of host galaxies depending on the metallicity bias. Our\nbest-fitting model includes a moderate metallicity bias, broadly consistent\nwith the large majority of long-duration GRBs in metal-poor environments\noriginating from collapsars (probability ~83%), but with a secondary\ncontribution (~17%) from metal-independent production channels, such as binary\nevolution. Because of the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies, the maximum\nlikelihood model predicts that the metal-independent channel becomes dominant\nat z<2, where hosts have higher metallicities and collapsars are suppressed.\nThis possibly explains why some studies find no clear evidence of a metal-bias\nbased on low-z samples.

For low altitude emission locales, general relativistic\ninfluences are found to be important.

We then study the\ndistribution of galaxies belonging to the red sequence, the green valley, and\nthe blue cloud within the different cluster substructures. Our analysis\nindicates that all the most massive galaxies are slow rotators and are the\ndominant galaxies of the different cluster substructures generally associated\nwith a diffuse X-ray emission. They are probably the result of major merging\nevents that occurred at early epochs. Slow rotators of lower stellar mass are\nalso preferentially located within the different high-density substructures of\nthe cluster. They are virialised within the cluster, thus Virgo members since\nits formation. They have been shaped by gravitational perturbations occurring\nwithin the infalling groups that later formed the cluster. On the contrary,\nlow-mass star-forming systems are extremely rare in the inner regions of the\nVirgo cluster A, where the density of the intergalactic medium is at its\nmaximum. Our ram pressure stripping models consistently indicate that these\nstar-forming systems can be rapidly deprived of their interstellar medium\nduring their interaction with the intergalactic medium. The lack of gas\nquenches their star formation activity transforming them into quiescent dwarf\nellipticals. This mild transformation does not perturb the kinematic properties\nof these galaxies which still have rotation curves typical of star-forming\nsystems. \n\n"}

We present two-dimensional axisymmetric\nhydrodynamical simulations which start from a collapsar engine and evolve all\nthe way through the late afterglow phase. The resultant outflow includes a jet\ncore which is highly relativistic after breaking out of the star, but becomes\nbaryon-loaded after colliding with a massive outer shell, corresponding to mass\nfrom the stellar atmosphere of the progenitor star which became trapped in\nfront of the jet core at breakout. The prompt emission produced before or\nduring this collision would then have the signature of a high Lorentz factor\njet, but the afterglow is produced by the amalgamated post-collision ejecta\nwhich has more inertia than the original highly relativistic jet core and thus\nhas a delayed deceleration. This naturally explains the early light curve\nbehavior discovered by Swift, including a steep decay and a long plateau,\nwithout invoking late-time energy injection from the central engine. The\nnumerical simulation is performed continuously from engine to afterglow,\ncovering a dynamic range of over ten orders of magnitude in radius.

In the simplest version of the\nmodel, some of the couplings need to be fine tuned to very small values. We\nformulate the problem of fine tuning of these couplings.

Their orbits are expected to be circular\ndue to tidal interactions during the binary evolution, as observed in most of\nthe binary MSPs. There are some peculiar systems that do not fit this picture.\nThree recent examples are PSRs J2234$+$06, J1946$+$3417 and J1950$+$2414, all\nof which are MSPs in eccentric orbits but with mass functions compatible with\nexpected He white dwarf companions. It has been suggested these MSPs may have\nformed from delayed accretion-induced collapse of massive white dwarfs, or the\neccentricity may be induced by dynamical interaction between the binary and a\ncircumbinary disk. Assuming that the core density of accreting neutron stars in\nLMXBs may reach the density of quark deconfinement, which can lead to phase\ntransition from neutron stars to strange quark stars, we show that the\nresultant MSPs are likely to have an eccentric orbit, due to the sudden loss of\nthe gravitational mass of the neutron star during the transition. The\neccentricities can be reproduced with a reasonable estimate of the mass loss.\nThis scenario might also account for the formation of the youngest known X-ray\nbinary Cir X$-$1, which also possesses a low-field compact star in an eccentric\norbit. \n\n"}

As in the other cases, though the quantum geometric effects resolve\nthe physical singularity and result in a non-singular bounce, after the bounce\na spacetime with small spacetime curvature does not emerge in either the\nsubsequent backward or the forward evolution.

Analysis of the components of the Ricci tensor shows that after the\nsingularity resolution, the Kantowski-Sachs spacetime leads to an effective\nmetric which can be interpreted as the `charged' Nariai, while the higher genus\nblack hole interior can similarly be interpreted as anti Bertotti-Robinson\nspacetime with a cosmological constant.

We determined\nthat the accretion disc radius, measured from the double-peaked emission line\nprofiles, is persistently large and lies within the range of 0.45-0.52a, where\na is the binary separation. This is close to the tidal truncation radius\nr_max=0.52a. This result contradicts with previous radius measurements. An\nextensive set of Doppler maps has revealed a very complex emission structure of\nthe accretion disc. Apart from a ring of disc emission, the tomograms display\nat least three areas of enhanced emission: the hot spot from the area of\ninteraction between the gas stream and the disc, which is superposed on the\nelongated spiral structure, and the extended bright region on the leading side\nof the disc, opposite to the location of the hot spot. The position of the hot\nspot in all the emission lines is consistent with the trajectory of the gas\nstream. However, the peaks of emission are located in the range of distances\n0.22-0.30a, which are much closer to the white dwarf than the disc edge.

Measurements of their rotation rates provide insights\ninto these mechanisms, but few rotation periods are available for these stars\nat field ages. Using photometry from the MEarth transit survey, we measure\nrotation periods for 387 nearby, mid-to-late M dwarfs in the Northern\nhemisphere, finding periods from 0.1 to 140 days. The typical detected rotator\nhas stable, sinusoidal photometric modulations at a semi-amplitude of 0.5 to\n1%. We find no period-amplitude relation for stars below 0.25Msun and an\nanti-correlation between period and amplitude for higher-mass M dwarfs.

The Galactic\nkinematics of our sample is consistent with the local population of G and K\ndwarfs, and rotators have metallicities characteristic of the Solar\nNeighborhood. We use the W space velocities and established age-velocity\nrelations to estimate that stars with P<10 days are on average <2 Gyrs, and\nthat those with P>70 days are about 5 Gyrs. The period distribution is mass\ndependent: as the mass decreases, the slowest rotators at a given mass have\nlonger periods, and the fastest rotators have shorter periods. We find a lack\nof stars with intermediate rotation periods. [Abridged] \n\n"}

A feedback-driven origin for the\nturbulence predicts a velocity dispersion that rises more sharply with star\nformation rate, and that does not depend on the gas fraction (i.e. $\\dot{M}_*\n\\propto \\sigma^2$), while a gravity-driven model yields a shallower rise and a\nstrong dependence on gas fraction (i.e. $\\dot{M}_* \\propto f_g^2 \\sigma$).

The Nondip Spectrum in the Low/Hard State - Modulations with Orbital\n  Phase Abstract: The accretion onto the black hole in the system HDE 226868/Cygnus X-1 is\npowered by the strong line driven stellar wind of the O-type donor star.

Here, we show how it is possible to extract information on a VSL\nsignal on an extended redshift range. We use mock cosmological data from future\ngalaxy surveys (BOSS, DESI, \\emph{WFirst-2.4} and SKA): the sound horizon at\ndecoupling imprinted in the clustering of galaxies (BAO) as an angular diameter\ndistance, and the expansion rate derived from those galaxies recognized as\ncosmic chronometers.

In this work, these\nrelativistic corrections are investigated in the magnification angular power\nspectrum, using both (standard) noninteracting dark energy (DE), and\ninteracting DE (IDE).

Within this framework, particles are accelerated at supernova\nremnant shocks and then released in the interstellar medium. The mechanism\nthrough which CRs are released and the way in which they propagate still remain\nopen issues. The main difficulty is the high non-linearity of the problem: CRs\nthemselves excite the magnetic turbulence that confines them close to their\nsources. We solve numerically the coupled differential equations describing the\nevolution in space and time of the escaping particles and of the waves\ngenerated through the CR streaming instability. The warm ionized and warm\nneutral phases of the interstellar medium are considered. These phases occupy\nthe largest fraction of the disc volume, where most supernovae explode, and are\ncharacterised by the significant presence of neutral particles. The friction\nbetween those neutrals and ions results in a very effective wave damping\nmechanism.

The bubble formed by\nthe wind eventually breaks out of the disk, and most of the wind moves directly\nout of the galaxy and is definitively lost. The fraction of the wind moving\nnearly parallel to the galactic plane carves a hole in the disk which will\ncontract after the end of the SN activity. During the interval of time between\nthe end of the SN explosions and the \"closure\" of the hole, very O-poor stars\n(the Extreme population) can form out of the super-AGB (asymptotic giant\nbranch) ejecta collected in the GC center. Once the hole contracts, the AGB\nejecta mix with the pristine gas, allowing the formation of stars with an\noxygen abundance intermediate between that of the very O-poor stars and that of\nthe pristine gas.

A key to understanding their peculiar instability is\ntheir high observed luminosities, which often depends on uncertain distances.\nHere we report direct distances and space motions of four canonical Milky Way\nLBVs---AG~Car, HR~Car, HD~168607, and (candidate) Hen~3-519---from the Gaia\nfirst data release. Whereas the distances of HR~Car and HD~168607 are\nconsistent with previous literature estimates within the considerable\nuncertainties, Hen~3-519 and AG~Car, both at $\\sim$2~kpc, are much closer than\nthe 6--8~kpc distances previously assumed.

Deeper surveys have now reported evidence for\npopulations of massive, quiescent galaxies at even higher redshifts and earlier\ntimes, however the evidence for their existence, and redshift, has relied\nentirely on coarsely sampled photometry. These early massive, quiescent\ngalaxies are not predicted by the latest generation of theoretical models.\nHere, we report the spectroscopic confirmation of one of these galaxies at\nredshift z=3.717 with a stellar mass of 1.7$\\times$10$^{11}$ M$_\\odot$ whose\nabsorption line spectrum shows no current star-formation and which has a\nderived age of nearly half the age of the Universe at this redshift. The\nobservations demonstrates that the galaxy must have quickly formed the majority\nof its stars within the first billion years of cosmic history in an extreme and\nshort starburst. This ancestral event is similar to those starting to be found\nby sub-mm wavelength surveys pointing to a possible connection between these\ntwo populations.

We define\ntest statistics, based on a novel method that first destroys Gaussian\ncorrelations in a dataset, and then measures the non-Gaussian correlations that\nremain. This procedure flags pairs of datapoints which depend on each other in\na non-Gaussian fashion, and thereby identifies where the assumption of a\nGaussian likelihood breaks down. Using this diagnostic, we find that\nnon-Gaussian correlations in the CFHTLenS cosmic shear correlation functions\nare significant. With a simple exclusion of the most contaminated datapoints,\nthe posterior for $s_8$ is shifted without broadening, but we find no\nsignificant reduction in the tension with $s_8$ derived from Planck Cosmic\nMicrowave Background data. However, we also show that the one-point\ndistributions of the correlation statistics are noticeably skewed, such that\nsound weak lensing data sets are intrinsically likely to lead to a\nsystematically low lensing amplitude being inferred. The detected\nnon-Gaussianities get larger with increasing angular scale such that for future\nwide-angle surveys such as Euclid or LSST, with their very small statistical\nerrors, the large-scale modes are expected to be increasingly affected. The\nshifts in posteriors may then not be negligible and we recommend that these\ndiagnostic tests be run as part of future analyses. \n\n"}

The most well-known of these is the mass distribution $\\mathrm{d}\nN/\\mathrm{d} M\\propto M^{-2}$ which (to first order) describes stars,\nprotostellar cores, clumps, giant molecular clouds, star clusters and even dark\nmatter halos. In this paper we propose that this ubiquity is not a coincidence\nand that it is the generic result of scale-free structure formation where the\ndifferent scales are uncorrelated.

This is the narrowest\npossible spectrum and it differs from a Planck function. We also present\nnumerical spectra from photospheres occurring during the transition into the\ncoasting phase of the flow. Using these spectral models, we reanalyse Fermi\nobservations of GRB100507 and GRB101219, which both have been reported to have\nvery narrow spectra. The bursts can be fitted by the spectral models: For\nGRB101219 the spectrum is consistent with the photosphere occurring below or\nclose to the saturation radius, while for GRB100507 the photosphere position\nrelative to the saturation radius can be determined as a function of time. In\nthe latter case, we find that the photosphere initially occurs in the\nacceleration phase and thereafter transitions into the coasting phase. We also\nfind that this transition occurs at the same time as the change in observed\ncooling behaviour: the temperature is close to constant before the break and\ndecays after. We argue that such a transition can be explained by an increasing\nmass outflow rate. Both analysed bursts thus give strong evidence that the jets\nare (initially) radiation dominated. \n\n"}

The cold outer belts of many systems have been imaged,\nfacilitating their study in great detail. Far less is known about the warm\ncomponents, including the origin of the dust. The regularity of the disk\ntemperatures indicates an underlying structure that may be linked to the water\nsnow line.

However there remains a lack of\nconsensus on the physical mechanism(s) responsible for initiating it. One\npotential avenue is disc photoevaporation, wherein the preferential removal of\nrelatively dust-free gas increases the disc metallicity. Late in the disc\nlifetime, photoevaporation dominates viscous accretion, creating a gradient in\nthe depleted gas surface density near the location of the gap. This induces a\nlocal pressure maximum that collects drifting dust particles, which may then\nbecome susceptible to the streaming instability. Using a one-dimensional\nviscous evolution model of a disc subject to internal X-ray photoevaporation,\nwe explore the efficacy of this process to build planetestimals. Over a range\nof parameters we find that the amount of dust mass converted into planetesimals\nis often < 1 M_Earth and at most a few M_Earth spread across tens of AU.

Most of these sources\nare likely to be forming super star clusters (SSCs) based on their inferred\ndynamical and gas masses, association with 36 GHz radio continuum emission, and\ncoincidence with line emission tracing dense, excited gas. One source coincides\nwith a known SSC, but the rest remain invisible in Hubble near-infrared (IR)\nimaging. Our observations imply that gas still constitutes a large fraction of\nthe overall mass in these sources.

Detailed analyses suggest that the width of point spread\nfunction has a significant effect on the measured ICL fraction, while the\nrelatively small pixel size shows almost no influence. It is found that the\nmeasured ICL fraction depends strongly on the SBL.

A necessary\ncondition for the existence of such exomoons is their long-term dynamical\nstability. Here, we investigate the stability of exomoons around the Kepler\nCBPs using numerical $N$-body integrations. We determine regions of stability\nand obtain stability maps in the (a_m,i_pm) plane, where a_m is the initial\nexolunar semimajor axis with respect to the CBP, and i_pm is the initial\ninclination of the orbit of the exomoon around the planet with respect to the\norbit of the planet around the stellar binary. Ignoring any dependence on i_pm,\nfor most Kepler CBPs the stability regions are well described by the location\nof the 1:1 mean motion commensurability of the binary orbit with the orbit of\nthe moon around the CBP. This is related to a destabilizing effect of the\nbinary compared to the case if the binary were replaced by a single body, and\nwhich is borne out by corresponding 3-body integrations. For high inclinations,\nthe evolution is dominated by Lidov-Kozai oscillations, which can bring moons\nin dynamically stable orbits to close proximity within the CBP, triggering\nstrong interactions such as tidal evolution, tidal disruption, or direct\ncollisions.

HI absorption is a powerful tracer on all scales,\nfrom the pc scales to many tens of kpc. Given the strong radio continuum often\nassociated with the central activity, HI absorption can be used to study the HI\nnear an AGN out to much higher redshifts than is possible using HI emission.

In the last two decades, significant\nprogress has been made in all these areas. It is now well established that many\nradio loud AGN are surrounded by small, regularly rotating gas disks that\ncontain a significant fraction of HI.

We detail the resonant trapping comparing semi-analytical\nformulae and numerical simulations in the case of two equal-mass coplanar\nplanets trapped in first order resonances. We describe the family of resonant\nstable equilibrium points (zero-amplitude libration orbits) using expanded and\nnon-expanded Hamiltonians. We show that during convergent migration the planets\nevolve along these families of equilibria. Eccentricity damping from the disk\nleads to a final equilibrium configuration that we predict analytically. The\nfact that observed multi-exoplanetary systems are rarely seen in resonances\nsuggests that the resonant configurations achieved by migration can become\nunstable after the removal of the disk. We probe the stability of the\nresonances as a function of planetary mass. To do this, we fictitiously\nincrease the masses of the planets, adiabatically maintaining the low-amplitude\nlibration regime until instability. We discuss two hypotheses for instability:\nlow-order secondary resonance of the libration frequency with a fast synodic\nfrequency, and minimal approach distance between planets.

We obtained\nSOFIA FORCAST 11.1, 19.7 and 31.5 micron photometry of SN\\,1987A in 2016.\nCompared with Spitzer measurements 10 years earlier, the 31.5 micron flux has\nsignificantly increased. The excess at 31.5 micron appears to be related to the\nHerschel 70 micron excess, which was detected 5 years earlier. The dust mass\nneeded to account for the the 31.5--70 micron excess is 3--7x10^-4 Msun, more\nthan ten times larger than the ring dust mass (1x10^-5 Msun) estimate from the\ndata 10-years earlier.

In the\npost-shock region, atoms can stick to surviving dust grains, and the dust mass\nmay have increased (grain growth), or dust grains might have condensed directly\nfrom the gas. An alternative possibility is that the outer part of the\nexpanding ejecta dust might have been heated by X-ray emission from the\ncircumstellar ring.

We show here that, within the\ncontext of leading models of GRB jet evolution, measurement of the GRB beaming\nangle using optical orphan searches is extremely difficult, perhaps impossible\nin practice. This is because in the leading model of GRB jets, the effective\nafterglow beaming angle scales with the jet angle for small angles, and so the\nratio of detected orphan afterglows to GRBs is independent of the jet opening\nangle. Thus, the number of expected afterglow detections is the same for\nmoderate jet angles (e.g. 20 deg) as for arbitrarily small jet angles (<< 0.1\ndeg). For nearly isotropic GRB geometry, or for radio afterglow searches in\nwhich the jet has become non-relativistic, the ratio of afterglows to GRBs may\ngive information on collimation. However, using a simple model we estimate the\nexpected number of orphan detections in current supernova surveys, and find\nthis number to be less than one, for all jet opening angles. Even for future\nsupernova surveys, the small detection rate and lack of dependence on\ncollimation angle appear to ruin the prospects of determining GRB beaming by\nthis method. Radio searches may provide the best hope to find the missing\norphans. \n\n"}

Though the reported excess power at $\\ell \\sim 2000 -\n6000$ by CBI and BIMA is roughly consistent with a secondary contribution\nresulting from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, this requires a higher\nnormalization for the matter power spectrum than measured by other means. In\naddition to a local red-shift contribution, another strong possibility for\nanisotropies at very small scales involve non-standard aspects of inflationary\nmodels. To distinguish between contributions from early universe and local\nstructures, including a potential point source contribution, and to understand\nthe extent to which structures at low red-shifts contribute to small scale\ntemperature anisotropies, it maybe necessary to perform a combined study\ninvolving CMB and the large scale structure. We suggest a cross-correlation of\nthe temperature data with a map of the large scale structure, such as the\ngalaxy distribution. For next generation small angular scale CMB experiments,\nmulti-frequency observations may be a necessary aspect to allow an additional\npossibility to distinguish between these different scenarios. \n\n"}

Based on our analysis, we formulate a model to characterise the\nredshift dependence of the star formation history and compare it to results\nobtained from a set of hydrodynamic simulations which include star formation\nand feedback. At early times, densities are sufficiently high and cooling times\nsufficiently short that abundant quantities of star-forming gas are present in\nall dark matter halos that can cool by atomic processes. Consequently, the star\nformation density generically rises exponentially as z decreases, independent\nof the details of the physical model for star formation, but dependent on the\nnormalisation and shape of the cosmological power spectrum. This part of the\nevolution is dominated by gravitationally driven growth of the halo mass\nfunction.

We consider three processes whereby supernovae can\naffect the forming galaxy: (1) reheating of disk gas to the halo temperature;\n(2) expansion of the diffuse halo gas; (3) expulsion of cold disk gas from the\nhalo. While feedback of form (1) is able to flatten the faint end of the\nluminosity function, this alone does not produce the sharp cut-off observed at\nlarge luminosities. Feedback of form (2) is also unable to solve this problem.\nThe relative paucity of very bright galaxies can only be explained if cooling\nin massive halos is strongly suppressed. Conduction is a promising mechanism,\nbut an uncomfortably high efficiency is required to suppress cooling to the\ndesired level. If, instead, superwinds are responsible for the lack of bright\ngalaxies, then the total energy budget required to obtain a good match to the\ngalaxy luminosity function greatly exceeds the energy available from supernova\nexplosions.

The setting\nis a theory of N charged scalar fields coupled to an abelian gauge field, that\nundergoes a phase transition at a critical temperature much larger than the\nelectroweak scale. The dynamics after the transition features two distinct\nstages: a spinodal regime dominated by linear long-wavelength instabilities,\nand a scaling stage in which the non-linearities and backreaction of the scalar\nfields are dominant.This second stage describes the growth of horizon sized\ndomains.We implement a formulation based on the non-equilibrium Schwinger-Dyson\nequations to obtain the spectrum of magnetic fields that includes the\ndissipative effects of the plasma. We find that large scale magnetogenesis is\nefficient during the scaling regime.Charged scalar field fluctuations with\nwavelengths of the order of the Hubble radius induce large scale magnetogenesis\nvia loop effects. The leading processes are: pair production, pair annihilation\nand low energy bremsstrahlung, these processes while forbidden in equilibrium\nare allowed strongly out of equilibrium.The ratio between the energy density on\nscales larger than L and that in the background radiation r(L,T)= rho_B(L,T)/\nrho_{cmb}(T) is r(L,T) sim 10^{-34} at the Electroweak scale and r(L,T) sim\n10^{-14} at the QCD scale for L sim 1 Mpc.The resulting spectrum is insensitive\nto the magnetic diffusion length and equipartition between electric and\nmagnetic fields does not hold.

The relative frequency shifts of the \"Coherent Raman\nEffect on Incoherent Light\" (CREIL) which is obtained do not depend on the\nintensity and, in a first approximation, on the frequency of the light. As\nCREIL does not blur the images and the spectra, its shifts may be confused with\nDoppler shifts. ISRS and CREIL are parametric effects which do not excite the\nmatter, transferring energy from hot beams to cold beams; for CREIL, the cold\nlight is thermal radiation which is heated.\n  CREIL requires low pressure gases acting as catalysts. These gases must have\nRaman transitions in the radiofrequencies range: for instance H2+ or excited\natomic hydrogen in a magnetic field.\n  The spectral lines resulting from a simultaneous absorption (or emission) and\nCREIL have a width at least equal to the frequency shift, so that the lines of\na complex spectrum may be weakened and mixed, becoming nearly invisible.

The idea is to start from a supersymmetric\nconfiguration with two parallel static Dp-branes, and slightly break the\nsupersymmetry conditions to produce a very flat potential for the field that\nparametrises the distance between the branes, i.e. the inflaton field. This\nbreaking can be achieved in various ways. I will describe one of the simplest\nexamples described in Ref. [1]: two almost parallel D4-branes in a flat\ncompactified space, with a small relative angle between the branes, softly\nbreaking supersymmetry. If the breaking parameter is sufficiently small, a\nlarge number of e-folds can be produced within the D-brane, for small changes\nof the configuration in the compactified directions. Such a process is local,\ni.e. it does not depend very strongly on the compactification space nor on the\ninitial conditions. Moreover, the breaking induces a very small velocity and\nacceleration, which ensures very small slow-roll parameters and thus an almost\nscale invariant spectrum of metric fluctuations, responsible for the observed\ntemperature and polarization anisotropies in the microwave background. Another\nprediction of the model is the small amplitude of the gravitational wave\nspectrum, which may not be detectable in the near future. Inflation ends as in\nhybrid inflation, triggered by the negative curvature of the string tachyon\npotential. \n\n"}

At WMAP Q, V, and W bands, the genus\nand genus-related statistics imply that the observed CMB sky is consistent with\nGaussian random phase field.

Numerical simulations indicate that once a gas\nclump acquires this mass, it undergoes a slow, quasi-hydrostatic contraction\nwithout further fragmentation. Here we show that as soon as the primordial gas\n- left over from the Big Bang - is enriched by supernovae to a carbon or oxygen\nabundance as small as ~0.01-0.1% of that found in the Sun, cooling by\nsingly-ionized carbon or neutral oxygen can lead to the formation of low-mass\nstars. This mechanism naturally accommodates the discovery of solar mass stars\nwith unusually low (10^{-5.3} of the solar value) iron abundance but with a\nhigh (10^{-1.3} solar) carbon abundance. The minimum stellar mass at early\nepochs is partially regulated by the temperature of the cosmic microwave\nbackground. The derived critical abundances can be used to identify those\nmetal-poor stars in our Milky Way galaxy with elemental patterns imprinted by\nthe first supernovae. \n\n"}

This implies that the Andromeda\ngalaxy possesses a substantial dark matter halo. We fit the orbit of the stream\nin different galaxy potential models. In a simple model with a composite bulge,\ndisk and halo, where the halo follows a ``universal'' profile that is\ncompressed by the formation of the baryonic components, we find that the\nkinematics of the stream require a total mass inside 125 kpc of\n7.5^(+2.5)_(-1.3) x 10^{11} M_Sun, or more than 5.4 x 10^{11} M_Sun at the 99%\nconfidence level.

In absence of spiral density waves, star formation occurs largely\nstochastically. The scattered star-forming regions tend to be long-lived and\nmigrate slowly. Older populations have a spatially more extended and regular\ndistribution. In fast-rotating Irrs high star formation rates with stronger\nconcentration toward the galaxies' center are observed, and cluster formation\nis facilitated. In slowly or nonrotating dwarf Irrs (dIrrs) star formation\noccurs more quiescently, and the formation of OB associations is common. Irrs\nand dIrrs tend to experience continuous star formation with amplitude\nvariations and to continue to form stars for another Hubble time. Irrs exhibit\nlower effective yields than spirals, and [alpha/Fe] ratios below the solar\nvalue. This may be indicative of fewer Type II SNe and lower astration rates in\ntheir past. Alternatively, many metals may be lost from the shallow galaxy\npotential wells due to selective winds. The differences in the\nmetallicity-luminosity relation between dIrrs and dwarf spheroidals (which,\ndespite their lower masses, tend to have too high a metallicity for their\nluminosity as compared to dIrrs) further supports the idea of slow astration\nand slow enrichment in dIrrs. The current data on age-metallicity relations are\nstill too sparse to distinguish between infall, leaky-box, and closed-box\nmodels. The preferred location of dIrrs in the outer parts of galaxy groups and\nclusters and in the field as well as the positive correlation between gas\ncontent and distance from massive galaxies indicate that these dIrrs probably\nhave not yet experienced significant interactions or galaxy harassment.\n(Abridged) \n\n"}

This source remains, however, quite enigmatic.\nSome properties of this system can be explained assuming that the unseen\ncompanion is a non-accreting young pulsar with a relativistic wind strongly\ninteracting with the wind of the Be star. On the contrary, other properties of\nLSI+61303 fit a model where the companion is accreting even with two events of\nsuper-critical accretion along the orbit. The very recent discovery of a radio\njet extending ca. 200 AU at both sides of a central core has definitely proved\nthe occurrence of accretion--ejection processes in this system. Therefore it is\nof great interest to combine this result with previous observations at other\nwavelengths within the framework of the two-peak accretion (ejection) model.\nConcerning the first ejection, we show that the observed gamma-rays variations\nmight be periodic with outbursts confined around the periastron passage (i.e.\nwhere the first accretion-rate peak occurs and high-energy emission but no\nradio emission is predicted).

Abstract: The widely accepted assumption is that metals detected in the spectra of a\nfew cool helium-rich white dwarfs cannot be of primordial origin and therefore\nmust be accreted from the interstellar medium. However, the observed abundances\nof hydrogen are much too low to be compatible with the high accretion rates\ninferred from metal accretion. Hydrogen accretion is therefore suppressed\ncompared to metal accretion. The hypothesis most widely discussed as cause for\nthis ``hydrogen screening'' is the propeller mechanism: Metals are accreted in\nthe form of grains onto a slowly rotating, weakly magnetized white dwarf,\nwhereas ionized hydrogen is repelled at the Alfv\\'en radius. We have obtained\ncircular polarization spectra of the helium-rich white dwarfs GD 40\n(WD0300-013) and L745-46A (WD0738-172) -- which both show strong metal lines as\nwell as hydrogen -- in order to search for signatures of a weak magnetic field.\nThe magnetic field strengths necessary for the propeller mechanism to work in\nthese stars are at least 144000 G and 3000 G, respectively.

We find that the transition\nbetween the two front types is indeed a critical condition for the complete\nionization of halos of cosmological interest.

Based on the\nultra-relativistic, ultracompact X-ray binary model introduced in the\naccompanying paper (Mosquera Cuesta 2004a), I present here a self-consistent\nexplanation for such an striking feature. I suggest that both the fundamental\nmode and the overtones observed in SGR1900+14 stem from pulsations of a massive\nwhite dwarf (WD). The fundamental mode (and likely some of its harmonics) is\nexcited because of the mutual gravitational interaction with its orbital\ncompanion (a NS, envisioned here as point mass object) whenever the binary\nKeplerian orbital frequency is a multiple integer number ($m$) of that mode\nfrequency (Pons et al. 2002). Besides, a large part of the powerful irradiation\nfrom the fireball-like explosion occurring on the NS (after partial accretion\nof disk material) is absorbed in different regions of the star driving the\nexcitation of other multipoles (Podsiadlowski 1991,1995), i.e., the overtones\n(fluid modes of higher frequency). Part of this energy is then reemitted into\nspace from the WD surface or atmosphere. This way, the WD lightcurve carries\nwith it the signature of these pulsations inasmuch the way as it happens with\nthe Sun pulsations in Helioseismology. It is shown that our theoretical\nprediction on the pulsation spectrum agrees quite well with the one found by\nBeppoSAX (Feroci et al. 1999).

By constructing type-dependent stellar\nmass functions, we show that in each of three redshift intervals, E/S0's\ndominate the higher mass population, while spirals are favored at lower masses.\nThis transition occurs at a stellar mass of 2--3 times 10^{10} Msun at z~0.3\n(similar to local studies) but there is evidence that the relevant mass scale\nmoves to higher mass at earlier epochs.

We compare the\nrest-frame B-band luminosity functions from z~0--2 with the predictions of a\nsemi-analytic hierarchical model of galaxy formation, and find qualitatively\ngood agreement. In particular, the model predicts at least as many optically\nluminous galaxies at z~1--2 as are implied by our observations. \n\n"}

The recent\nproposal that the endpoint of gravitational collapse can be a \"dark energy\nstar\" implies that the mass-energy of the nucleons undergoing gravitational\ncollapse can be converted to vacuum energy when one gets near to conditions\nwhere classical general relativity predicts that a trapped surface would form.\nThe negative pressure associated with a large vacuum energy prevents an event\nhorizon from forming, thus resolving the long-standing puzzle as to why\ngravitational collapse always leads to an explosion. An indirect consequence is\nthat the reverse process - creation of matter from vacuum energy - should also\nbe possible. Indeed this process may be responsible for the \"big bang\".

Caustics are places where the CDM\nparticles are naturally focussed. Our focus is upon the caustic rings which are\nclosed tubes whose cross-section is an elliptic umbilic catastrophe with three\ndual cusps. A caustic ring has a specific density profile, a specific geometry\nand, therefore, precisely calculable gravitational lensing signatures. The\nmagnification monotonically increases as the line of sight approaches to the\ncusps where it diverges in the limit of zero velocity dispersion. In this\nlimit, we find 37% magnification at a sample point near the outer cusps of the\nCDM caustic rings at cosmological distances. In the presence of finite velocity\ndispersion, the lower and upper bounds of the effective velocity dispersions of\nthe axion and WIMP flows in galactic halos may be used to constrain the lensing\neffects at the cusps. For a cosmological axion caustic ring, we find that the\nmagnification may range between 3% and 2800% at the outer cusp, and between 2%\nand 46% at the non-planer cusps. For a cosmological WIMP caustic ring, on the\nother hand, we constrain the magnification between 3% and 28% at the outer\ncusp, and between 2% and 5% at the non-planer cusps. The images of extended\nsources may also show distortions that can be unambiguously attributed to\nlensing by dark matter caustics. Finally, we derive the Catastrophe Function of\nthe triaxial caustic rings. We obtain the flow equations as the equilibrium\npoints of this Catastrophe Function. The analysis of the Stability (Hessian)\nMatrix show that the caustic rings are structurally stable. \n\n"}

While some particles gain and others lose, friction arises when\nthere is an excess of gainers over losers. This imbalance results from the\ngenerally decreasing numbers of particles with increasing angular momentum, and\nfriction can therefore be avoided if there is no gradient in the density of\nparticles across the major resonances. Here we show that anomalously weak\nfriction can occur for this reason if the pattern speed of the bar fluctuates\nupwards. After such an event, the density of resonant halo particles has a\nlocal inflexion created by the earlier exchanges, and bar slowdown can be\ndelayed for a long period; we describe this as a metastable state. We show that\nthis behavior in purely collisionless N-body simulations is far more likely to\noccur in methods with adaptive resolution. We also show that the phenomenon\ncould arise in nature, since bar-driven gas inflow could easily raise the bar\npattern speed enough to reach the metastable state.

Contrary to\ncommonly used constant density models, our absorbing cloud is assumed to be\nunder constant total (gas plus radiation) pressure. This assumption implies the\ncoexistence of material at different temperatures and ionization states, which\nis a natural consequence of pressure and thermal equilibrium. Our\nphotoionization code allows us to compute the profiles of the density, the\ntemperature, the gas pressure, the radiation pressure and the ionization state\nacross the cloud, and to calculate the radiative transfer of continuum and\nlines including Compton scattering. Therefore, equivalent widths of both\nsaturated and unsaturated lines are properly modeled. For each pair of the\nincident spectrum slope and the ionization parameter at the cloud surface there\nis a natural upper limit to the total column densities of the cloud due to\nthermal instabilities. These maximum values are comparable to the observational\nconstraints on the column density of warm absorbers which may give support to\nconstant total pressure models.

The kHz QPOs\nhave the same origin as variability at lower frequencies - independent of the\nnature of the \"clock\", the actual luminosity modulation takes place on the NS\nsurface. The boundary layer spectrum remains nearly constant during luminosity\nvariations and can be represented by the Fourier frequency resolved spectrum.\nIn the range of Mdot~(0.1-1)*Mdot_Edd it depends weakly on the global mass\naccretion rate and in the limit Mdot~Mdot_Edd is close to Wien spectrum with\nkT~2.4 keV. Its independence on the Mdot lends support to the suggestion by\nInogamov & Sunyaev (1999) that the boundary layer is radiation pressure\nsupported.\n  Based on the knowledge of the boundary layer spectrum we attempt to relate\nthe motion along the Z-track to changes of physically meaningful parameters.\nOur results suggest that the contribution of the boundary layer to the observed\nemission decreases along the Z-track from conventional ~50% on the horizontal\nbranch to a rather small number on the normal branch. This decrease can be\ncaused, for example, by obscuration of the boundary layer by the geometrically\nthickened accretion disk at Mdot~Mdot_Edd. Alternatively, this can indicate\nsignificant change of the structure of the accretion flow at Mdot~Mdot_Edd and\ndisappearance of the boundary layer as a distinct region of the significant\nenergy release associated with the NS surface. \n\n"}

The model assumes\na massive and young stellar cluster surrounded by a large collection of clouds.\nThese are thus exposed to the most important star-formation feedback\nmechanisms: photoionization and the cluster wind. The models show how the two\nfeedback mechanisms compete in the disruption of clouds and lead to two\ndifferent hydrodynamic solutions: The storage of clouds into a long lasting\nragged shell that inhibits the expansion of the thermalized wind, and the\nsteady filtering of the shocked wind gas through channels carved within the\ncloud stratum. Both solutions are claimed to be concurrently at work in giant\nHII regions and HII galaxies, causing their detailed inner structure.

According to recent studies the capture into a\nresonance is the result of a planetary migration process induced by the\ninteraction of the planets with a protoplanetary disk. If the migration is slow\nenough (adiabatic) next to a mean motion resonance, the two planets will also\nbe in apsidal corotation.\n  The recently refined orbital parameters of the system HD 128311 suggest that\nthe two giant planets are in a 2:1 mean motion resonance, however without\nexhibiting apsidal corotation.

In addition, although BCGs are hardly\noffset from the Fundamental Plane defined by the bulk of the early-type\npopulation, they show considerably smaller scatter. The larger than expected\nsizes of BCGs, and the increased homogeneity, are qualitatively consistent with\nmodels which seek to explain the colors of the most massive galaxies by\ninvoking dry dissipationless mergers, since dissipation tends to reduce the\nsizes of galaxies, and wet mergers which result in star formation would tend to\nincrease the scatter in luminosity at fixed size and velocity dispersion.\nFurthermore, BCGs define the same g-r color-magnitude relation as the bulk of\nthe early-type population. If BCGs formed from dry mergers, then BCG\nprogenitors must have been red for their magnitudes, suggesting that they\nhosted older stellar populations than typical for their luminosities. Our\nfindings have two other consequences. First, the R_e-L relation of the\nearly-type galaxy population as a whole (i.e., normal plus BCG) exhibits some\ncurvature. Some of this curvature must be a consequence of the fact that an\nincreasing fraction of the most luminous galaxies are BCGs. The second\nconsequence is suggested by the fact that, despite following a steeper\nsize-luminosity relation, BCGs tend to define a tight relation between\ndynamical mass R_e sigma^2/G and luminosity. As consequence, we find that BCGs\ndefine a shallower sigma-L relation than the bulk of the early-type galaxy\npopulation. \n\n"}

It is this force that is responsible for the transfer of angular\nmomentum of a neutron star to an outgoing magneto-dipole wave. If a pulsar is\nsurrounded by plasma, and there is no longitudinal current in its\nmagnetosphere, there is no energy loss (Beskin, Gurevich & Istomin 1993,\nMestel, Panagi & Shibata 1999). It is the longitudinal current closing within\nthe pulsar polar cap that exerts the retardation torque acting on the neutron\nstar.

In the past a wide range of possible depletion factors, ranging from\nminimal in standard (non-rotating) stellar models to as much as an order of\nmagnitude in models including rotational mixing have been suggested. Using\nrecent progress in the study of the angular momentum evolution of low mass\nstars, which now permits the construction of theoretical models that reproduce\nthe angular momentum evolution of low mass open cluster stars, along with the\nobserved distribution of initial angular momenta inferred from stellar rotation\ndata in young open clusters, we study lithium depletion in main sequence halo\nstars. We predict a well-defined, nearly flat (in T_eff) halo lithium plateau\nwith modest scatter and a small population of outliers. We also examine the\nrelative depletions of 6Li and 7Li finding that the dispersion in the plateau\nand the 6Li/7Li depletion ratio scale with the absolute 7Li depletion. Using\nobservational data to bound the 7Li depletion in main sequence halo stars, we\nfind a maximum depletion of 0.4 dex is set by the observed dispersion and the\n6Li/7Li depletion ratio, and a minimum depletion of 0.2 dex is required by both\nthe presence of highly overdepleted halo stars and consistency with the solar\nand open cluster 7Li data.

As an alternative, we construct a\nphysically motivated model for the adiabatic collapse of pre-heated gas into an\nisothermal potential that improves upon the original work of Kaiser (1991). The\nluminosity and temperature of the gas is calculated, assuming an appropriate\ndistribution of halo formation times and radiation due to both bremsstrahlung\nand recombination processes. This model successfully reproduces the slope and\ndispersion of the luminosity-temperature relation of galaxy groups. We also\npresent calculations of the temperature and luminosity functions for galaxy\ngroups under the prescription of this model. This model makes two strong\npredictions for haloes with total masses M<10^13 M_sun, which are not yet\ntestable with current data: (1) the gas mass fraction will increase in direct\nproportion to the halo mass; (2) the gas temperature will be larger than the\nvirial temperature of the mass. The second effect is strong enough that group\nmasses determined from gas temperatures will be overestimated by about an order\nof magnitude if it is assumed that the gas temperature is the virial\ntemperature. The entropy required to match observations can be obtained by\nheating the gas at the turnaround time, for example, to about 3 X 10^6 K at\nz=1, which is too high to be generated by a normal rate of supernova\nexplosions. This model breaks down on the scale of low mass clusters, but this\nis an acceptable limitation, as we expect accretion shocks to contribute\nsignificantly to the entropy of the gas in such objects. \n\n"}

The afterglow from\nthe shock at the nonrelativistic stage decays more rapidly than at the\nrelativistic stage. Since some models for GRB energy sources predict that a\nstrongly magnetic millisecond pulsar may be born during the formation of GRB,\nwe discuss the effect of such a pulsar on the evolution of the nonrelativistic\nshock through magnetic dipole radiation.

Recent progress in numerical\ntechniques made it possible to simulate halos in large volumes with a such\naccuracy that halos survive in dense environments of groups and clusters of\ngalaxies. Dark matter halos in simulations look like real galaxies, and, thus,\ncan be used to study the biases - differences between galaxies and the dark\nmatter. For the standard LCDM model we find that the correlation function and\nthe power spectrum of galaxy-size halos at z=0 are antibiased on scales\nr<5Mpc/h and k=(0.15-30)h/Mpc. The biases depend on scale, redshift, and\ncircular velocities of selected halos.
