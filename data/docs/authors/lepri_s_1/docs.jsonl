The new phase, termed the\nHaldane Insulator (HI) in analogy with the gapped phase of spin-1 chains, is\ncharacterized by a non local order parameter, which can only be written as an\ninfinite string in terms of the bosonic densities. We show that the string\norder can nevertheless be probed with physical fields that couple locally, via\nthe effect those fields have on the quantum phase transitions separating the\nexotic phase from the conventional Mott and density wave phases.

Because of the crudeness of current\nmodels of intrinsic alignment, we have developed a model-independent, purely\ngeometrical method to remove shear-ellipticity correlations. We eliminate the\ncontributions to a tomographic cosmic shear signal that may be subject to\ncontamination by shear-ellipticity correlations, making use of the\ncharacteristic dependence of these correlations on redshift. By introducing an\nappropriately chosen weight function to the lensing efficiency that nulls\nsignals stemming from certain distances, new second-order measures of cosmic\nshear, free of intrinsic alignment, can be constructed. The loss of information\ninduced by this nulling technique and the subsequent degradation of constraints\non cosmological parameters is quantified in a likelihood analysis.

The key aspect of our model which makes it match these\nobservations is that the precession is of a radially extended region of the hot\ninner flow. The outer radius is set by the truncation radius of the disc as\nabove, but the inner radius lies well outside of the last stable orbit at the\npoint where numerical simulations show that the density drops off sharply for a\nmisaligned flow.

However, even in such a\nleptophilic DM scenario there are loop induced DM-hadron interactions, where\nthe photons emitted from virtual leptons couple to the charge of a nucleus.\nUsing a general effective field theory approach we show that, if such an\ninteraction is induced at one or two-loop level, then DM-nucleus scattering\ndominates over DM-electron scattering.

In agreement with other authors, we find\nthat thermohaline mixing substantially reduces the abundance of helium-3 on the\nupper part of the red giant branch in our lowest mass model. However, the small\namount of helium-3 that remains is enough to drive thermohaline mixing on the\nAGB.

The carbon-12 to carbon-13 ratio is substantially lowered during the\nearly thermal pulses but the efficacy of the process is seen to diminish\nrapidly.

The\nproblem of finding the ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and superconducting\nsymmetry broken solutions of the correlated lattice fermion models was\ndiscussed within the irreducible Green functions method. A unified scheme for\nthe construction of generalized mean fields (elastic scattering corrections)\nand self-energy (inelastic scattering) in terms of the Dyson equation was\ngeneralized in order to include the source fields. The interrelation of the\nBogoliubov's idea of quasiaverages and the concepts of symmetry breaking and\nquantum protectorate was discussed briefly in the context of quantum\nstatistical physics. The idea of quantum protectorate reveals the essential\ndifference in the behaviour of the complex many-body systems at the low-energy\nand high-energy scales.

In our first\npaper (Crimier et al. 2010), we determined the physical structure\n(density-temperature radial profiles) of the protostellar envelopes. Here, we\nstudy the CO depletion and N2H+ deuteration. We observed the millimeter lines\nof C18O, C17O, N2H+ and N2D+ toward the protostars using the IRAM 30m\ntelescope. Based on these observations, we derived the C18O, N2H+ and N2D+\nradial abundance profiles across their envelopes using a radiative transfer\ncode. In addition, we modeled the chemistry of the protostellar envelopes. All\nthe C18O 1-0 maps are well fit assuming that the C18O abundance decreases\ninwards within the protostellar envelope until the gas and dust reach the CO\nevaporation temperature, 20-25K, where the CO is released back to the gas\nphase. The N2H+ deuterium fractionation in Class 0 IMs is\n[N2D+]/[N2H+]=0.005-0.014, two orders of magnitude higher than the elemental\n[D/H] value in the interstellar medium, but a factor of 10 lower than in\npre-stellar clumps. Chemical models account for the C18O and N2H+ observations\nif we assume the CO abundance is 2 times lower than the canonical value in the\ninner envelope. This could be the consequence of the CO being converted into\nCH3OH on the grain surfaces prior to the evaporation and/or the\nphotodissociation of CO by the stellar UV radiation. The deuterium\nfractionation is not fitted by chemical models. This discrepancy is very likely\ncaused by the simplicity of our model that assumes spherical geometry and\nneglects important phenomena like the effect of bipolar outflows and UV\nradiation from the star. More important, the deuterium fractionation is\ndependent on the ortho-to-para H2 ratio, which is not likely to reach the\nsteady-state value in the dynamical time scales of these protostars. \n\n"}

We describe this method\nin detail; a system's probability distribution is represented by a matrix\nproduct state (MPS) of finite dimension and then its time-evolution is\nefficiently simulated by repeatedly updating and approximately re-factorizing\nthis representation. We examine the use of MPS as an approximation method,\nlooking at parallels between the interpretations of applying it to quantum\nstate vectors and probability distributions.

In the case of protostellar accretion, rapid\nmagnetic diffusion (through Ohmic dissipation with additional support from\nambipolar diffusion) near the protostar causes dramatic magnetic flux loss. By\ndoing so, it also allows the formation of a centrifugal disk, thereby avoiding\nthe magnetic braking catastrophe. \n\n"}

Instead, the early\nuniverse is described by a conformal field theory minimally coupled to gravity.\nThe conformal fields develop a time-dependent expectation value which breaks\nthe flat space so(4,2) conformal symmetry down to so(4,1), the symmetries of de\nSitter, giving perturbations a scale invariant spectrum.

The eclipse\ntimes during the tails of eruptions are systematically and substantially\nshifted with respect to the ephemerides from the eclipses in quiescence, with\nthis being caused by shifts of the center of light during the eruption.

We find that the rotation of the disks deeply\naffects the Oseledec splitting and the structure of the tangent space. For both\nthe smooth and rough hard disks, the stable, unstable and central manifolds are\ntransverse to each other, although the minimal angle between the unstable and\nstable manifolds of the RHDS typically is very small. Both systems are\nhyperbolic. However, the central manifold is precisely orthogonal to the rest\nof the tangent space only for the smooth-particle case and not for the rough\ndisks. We also demonstrate that the rotations destroy the Hamiltonian character\nfor the rough-hard-disk system. \n\n"}

The\ndirection of the estimated proper motion coincides with the extension of the\npulsar's X-ray tail, suggesting that this is a jet.

Similar\nresults are found for effectively short-range nonlocal hoppings (\\beta > 2): At\nvariance, for longer-ranged hoppings (1 < \\beta < 2) there is no longer any\nmodulational stability.

But if disks are\nturbulent, this neglects a spectrum of stochastic density fluctuations that can\nproduce rare, high-density mass concentrations.

Turbulent disks are never completely\nstable: we calculate the (always finite) probability of forming\nself-gravitating structures via stochastic turbulent density fluctuations in\nsuch disks. Modest sub-sonic turbulence above Mach number ~0.1 can produce a\nfew stochastic fragmentation or 'direct collapse' events over ~Myr timescales,\neven if Q>>1 and cooling is slow (t_cool>>t_orbit).

What is less known is that atoms near higher partial wave Feshbach\nresonances also have remarkable universal properties. We illustrate this with a\nsingle atom interacting resonantly with two fixed static centers.

The 3-40 keV NuSTAR intensity of the inner 20\narcsec (~400 pc) nuclear region varied by a factor of ~2 across the three\nmonitoring observations. The Chandra data reveal that the nuclear region\ncontains three bright X-ray sources, including a luminous (L2-10 keV ~ few x\n10^39 erg/s) point source ~1 arcsec from the dynamical center of the galaxy\n(within the 3sigma positional uncertainty of the dynamical center); this source\ndrives the overall variability of the nuclear region at energies >3 keV. We\nmake use of the variability to measure the spectra of this single hard X-ray\nsource when it was in bright states. The spectra are well described by an\nabsorbed (NH ~ 1.6 x 10^23 cm^-2) broken power-law model with spectral slopes\nand break energies that are typical of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), but\nnot AGN.

We extend the computation of the I-Q relation\nto models rotating up to the mass-shedding limit and show that the universality\nof the relations is lost. With increasing rotation rate, the normalized I-Q\nrelation departs significantly from its slow-rotation limit deviating up to 40%\nfor neutron stars and up to 75% for strange stars. The deviation is also EOS\ndependent and for a broad set of hadronic and strange matter EOS the spread due\nto rotation is comparable to the spread due to the EOS, if one considers\nsequences with fixed rotational frequency. Still, for a restricted sample of\nmodern realistic EOS one can parameterize the deviations from universality as a\nfunction of rotation only. The previously proposed I-Love-Q relations should\nthus be used with care, because they lose their universality in astrophysical\nsituations involving compact objects rotating faster than a few hundred Hz. \n\n"}

A hybrid model, consisting\nof two component oscillators of the same frequency, is proposed as a means to\nfit the data over the entire cycle. One component exhibits a sawtooth-like\nvelocity waveform while the other is nearly sinusoidal. One method of\ngenerating such a hybrid is presented: a nonlinear model is developed for the\nfirst overtone mode, which, if excited to large amplitude, is found to drop\nstrongly in frequency and become highly non-sinusoidal. If the frequency drops\nsufficiently to become equal to the fundamental frequency, the two can become\nphase locked and form the desired hybrid. A relationship is assumed between the\nhybrid mode velocity and the observed light curve, which is approximated as a\npower series. An accurate fit of the hybrid model is made to actual Kepler data\nfor RR Lyr. The sinusoidal component may tend to stabilize the period of the\nhybrid which is found in real Blazhko data to be extremely stable. It is\nproposed that the variations in amplitude and phase might result from a\nnonlinear interaction with a third mode, possibly a nonradial mode at 3/2 the\nfundamental frequency. The hybrid model also applies to non-Blazhko RRab stars\nand provides an explanation for the light curve bump. A method to estimate the\nsurface gravity is also proposed. \n\n"}

We present delay times of double-detonation SNe, in which\na sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accretes non-dynamically\nfrom a helium-rich companion. One of the main uncertainties in quantifying SN\nrates from double-detonations is the (assumed) retention efficiency of He-rich\nmatter. Therefore, we implement a new prescription for the treatment of\naccretion/accumulation of He-rich matter on white dwarfs. In addition, we test\nhow the results change depending on which criteria are assumed to lead to a\ndetonation in the helium shell. In comparing the results to our standard case\n(Ruiter et al. 2011), we find that regardless of the adopted He accretion\nprescription, the SN rates are reduced by only 25% if low-mass He shells (<\n0.05 Msun) are sufficient to trigger the detonations. If more massive (0.1\nMsun) shells are needed, the rates decrease by 85% and the delay time\ndistribution is significantly changed in the new accretion model - only SNe\nwith prompt (< 500 Myr) delay times are produced. Since theoretical arguments\nfavour low-mass He shells for normal double-detonation SNe, we conclude that\nthe rates from double-detonations are likely to be high, and should not\ncritically depend on the adopted prescription for accretion of He. \n\n"}

In a flat space, such energy growth is due to an inverse\ncascade, which builds a constant part of the velocity autocorrelation function\nproportional to time and expanding in scales, while the moments of the velocity\ndifference saturate during a time depending on the distance. For the curved\nspace, we analyze the long-time long-distance scaling limit, that lives in a\ndegenerate conical geometry, and find that the energy-containing mode linearly\ngrowing with time is not constant in space.

The energy current across scales does not increase linearly\nwith the scale, as in a flat space, but reaches a maximum around the curvature\nradius.

The population of WD+MS PCEBs has been simulated by several authors\nin the past and compared with observations. However, most of those predictions\ndid not take the possible contributions to the envelope ejection from\nadditional sources of energy (mostly recombination energy) into account. Here\nwe update existing binary population models of WD+MS PCEBs by assuming that a\nfraction of the recombination energy available within the envelope contributes\nto ejecting the envelope. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of 10^7 MS+MS\nbinaries for 9 different models using standard assumptions for the initial\nprimary mass function, binary separations, and initial-mass-ratio distribution\nand evolved these systems using the publicly available BSE code. Including a\nfraction of recombination energy leads to a clear prediction of a large number\nof long orbital period (>~10 days) systems mostly containing high-mass WDs. The\nfraction of systems with He-core WD primaries increases with the CE efficiency\nand the existence of very low-mass He WDs is only predicted for high values of\nthe CE efficiency (>~0.5). All models predict on average longer orbital periods\nfor PCEBs containing C/O-core WDs than for PCEBs containing He WDs. This effect\nincreases with increasing values of both efficiencies.

Motivated by the quantum annealing method, we\npresent three strategies to prepare the low-temperature state that exploit\nquantum mechanics in remarkable ways. We focus on implementations without\nuncontrolled errors induced by the environment. This allows us to rigorously\nprove a quantum advantage. The first strategy uses a classical-to-quantum\nmapping, where the equilibrium properties of a classical system in $d$ spatial\ndimensions can be determined from the ground state properties of a quantum\nsystem also in $d$ spatial dimensions. We show how such a ground state can be\nprepared by means of quantum annealing, including quantum adiabatic evolutions.\nThis mapping also allows us to unveil some fundamental relations between\nsimulated and quantum annealing.

The wind contribution is uncertain because\nthe boundary between the wind and interstellar medium is difficult to observe.\nMid-infrared observations (e.g., of the H II region RCW 120) show arcs of dust\nemission around O stars, contained well within the H II region bubble. These\narcs could indicate the edge of an asymmetric stellar wind bubble, distorted by\ndensity gradients and/or stellar motion. We present two-dimensional,\nradiation-hydrodynamics simulations investigating the evolution of wind bubbles\nand H II regions around massive stars moving through a dense (n=3000 cm^{-3}),\nuniform medium with velocities ranging from 4 to 16 km/s. The H II region\nmorphology is strongly affected by stellar motion, as expected, but the wind\nbubble is also very aspherical from birth, even for the lowest space velocity\nconsidered. Wind bubbles do not fill their H II regions (we find filling\nfactors of 10-20%), at least for a main sequence star with mass M~30 Msun.\nFurthermore, even for supersonic velocities the wind bow shock does not\nsignificantly trap the ionization front. X-ray emission from the wind bubble is\nsoft, faint, and comes mainly from the turbulent mixing layer between the wind\nbubble and the H II region. The wind bubble radiates <1 per cent of its energy\nin X-rays; it loses most of its energy by turbulent mixing with cooler\nphotoionized gas. Comparison of the simulations with the H II region RCW 120\nshows that its dynamical age is <=0.4 Myr and that stellar motion <=4 km/s is\nallowed, implying that the ionizing source is unlikely to be a runaway star but\nmore likely formed in situ. The region's youth, and apparent isolation from\nother O or B stars, makes it very interesting for studies of massive star\nformation and of initial mass functions. \n\n"}

Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass\naccretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in\nthe disk. We calculate the snow line location from recent observations of mass\naccretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed\ndispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial\ndisk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow line\nlocations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass\naccretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow line\nlocations of 0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the one-sigma snow line location\namong solar mass stars of the same age ranges from 2 to 5 au. For more\nrealistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located\nup to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of\nN-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial\nplanets that formed in situ in the habitable zone.

One of\nthe main goals of NIKA2 is to measure the pressure distribution in galaxy\nclusters at high resolution using the thermal SZ (tSZ) effect. Such\nobservations have already proved to be an excellent probe of cluster pressure\ndistributions even at high redshifts.

We use a representation of the problem via the $CP^{N-1}$ sigma\nmodel in the limit $N \\rightarrow 1$ to determine the stability of this\ncritical point. First we prove that the DS critical exponents are robust, so\nlong as the polymer does not cross itself: they can arise in a generic lattice\nmodel, and do not require fine tuning. This resolves a longstanding theoretical\nquestion. However there is an apparent paradox: two different lattice models,\napparently both in the DS universality class, show different numbers of\nrelevant perturbations, apparently leading to contradictory conclusions about\nthe stability of the DS exponents. We explain this in terms of subtle\ndifferences between the two models, one of which is fine-tuned (and not\nstrictly in the DS universality class). Next, we allow the polymer to cross\nitself, as appropriate e.g. to the quasi-2D case.

We present evidence that\nsuggests that deviations from hyperuniformity in putative maximally random\njammed (MRJ) packings can in part be explained by a shortcoming in generating\nexactly-jammed configurations due to a type of \"critical slowing down\" as the\nnecessary rearrangements become difficult to realize by numerical protocols.\nAdditionally, various protocols are able to produce packings exhibiting\nhyperuniformity to different extents, but this is because certain protocols are\nbetter able to approach exactly-jammed configurations. Nonetheless, while one\nshould not generally expect exact hyperuniformity for disordered packings with\nrattlers, we find that when jamming is ensured, our packings are very nearly\nhyperuniform, and deviations from hyperuniformity correlate with an inability\nto ensure jamming, suggesting that strict jamming and hyperuniformity are\nindeed linked.

In the present paper, we analyze quantum-scale heat engines,\nemploying the measurement-based formulation of the work extraction recently\nintroduced by Hayashi and Tajima~[arXiv:1504.06150].

We\nperform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core\ncluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via\ncollimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via\nstreaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming\ninstability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient\nneeded for AGN feedback to self-regulate, at least within the context of the\nphysical model considered here. When CR streaming is neglected, the suppression\nof CR mixing with the ICM by magnetic fields significantly reduces ICM heating,\nwhich leads to cooling catastrophes. In the opposite case, CRs come into\ncontact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, which results in globally\nstable atmospheres. Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the\ncentral AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present. We find that\nCR streaming heating dominates over the heating due to Coulomb and hadronic\nprocesses. Importantly, in simulations that include CR streaming, CR pressure\nsupport in the central 100 kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate\nobservational constraints. On the contrary, when CR streaming is neglected, CR\nenergy is not spent on the ICM heating and CR pressure builds up to the level\nthat is in disagreement with the data. Overall, our models demonstrate that CR\nheating is a viable channel for the thermalization of AGN energy in clusters,\nand likely also in elliptical galaxies, and that CRs play an important role in\ndetermining AGN intermittency and the dynamical state of cool core atmospheres. \n\n"}

One possible solution is that the accretion process is episodic. FU\nOri-type stars (FUors) are thought to be the visible examples for objects in\nthe high accretion state. FUors are often surrounded by massive envelopes,\nwhich replenish the disk material and enable the disk to produce accretion\noutbursts. However, we have insufficient information on the envelope dynamics\nin FUors, about where and how mass transfer from the envelope to the disk\nhappens. Here we present ALMA observations of the FUor-type star V346 Nor at\n1.3 mm continuum and in different CO rotational lines. We mapped the density\nand velocity structure of its envelope and analyze the results using channel\nmaps, position-velocity diagrams, and spectro-astrometric methods.

Abstract: The mass, accretion rate and formation time of dark matter haloes near\nproto-filaments (identified as saddle points of the potential) are analytically\npredicted using a conditional version of the excursion set approach in its\nso-called \"upcrossing\" approximation. The model predicts that at fixed mass,\nmass accretion rate and formation time vary with orientation and distance from\nthe saddle, demonstrating that assembly bias is indeed influenced by the tides\nimposed by the cosmic web. Starved, early forming haloes of smaller mass lie\npreferentially along the main axis of filaments, while more massive and younger\nhaloes are found closer to the nodes. Distinct gradients for distinct tracers\nsuch as typical mass and accretion rate occur because the saddle condition is\nanisotropic, and because the statistics of these observables depend on both the\nconditional means and their covariances. The theory is extended to other\ncritical points of the potential field. The response of the mass function to\nvariations of the matter density field (the so-called large scale bias) is\ncomputed, and its trend with accretion rate is shown to invert along the\nfilament.

In the last few years, interest in constraining the\nuncertain structure of their deep interiors has been renewed by insights from\nasteroseismology. Recently, Spruit (2015) proposed a limit for the rate of\ngrowth of helium-burning convective cores based on the higher buoyancy of\nmaterial ingested from outside the convective core. In this paper we test the\nimplications of such a limit for stellar models with a range of initial mass\nand metallicity. We find that the constraint on mixing beyond the Schwarzschild\nboundary has a significant effect on the evolution late in core helium burning,\nwhen core breathing pulses occur and the ingestion rate of helium is fastest.\nOrdinarily, core breathing pulses prolong the core helium burning lifetime to\nsuch an extent that models are at odds with observations of globular cluster\npopulations. Across a wide range of initial stellar masses ($0.83 \\leq\nM/\\text{M}_\\odot \\leq 5$), applying the Spruit constraint reduces the core\nhelium burning lifetime because core breathing pulses are either avoided or\ntheir number and severity reduced. The constraint suggested by Spruit therefore\nhelps to resolve significant discrepancies between observations and theoretical\npredictions.

Recently,\na quantum version of the Boltzmann machine was introduced by Amin, et. al.,\nhowever, non-commutativity of quantum operators renders the training process by\nminimizing a cost function inefficient. Recent advances in the study of\nnon-equilibrium quantum integrable systems, which never thermalize, have lead\nto the exploration of a wider class of statistical ensembles. These systems may\nbe described by the so-called generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE), which\nincorporates a number of \"effective temperatures\". We propose that these GGE's\ncan be successfully applied as the basis of a Boltzmann-machine-like learning\nalgorithm, which operates by learning the optimal values of effective\ntemperatures. We show that the GGE algorithm is an optimal quantum Boltzmann\nmachine: it is the only quantum machine that circumvents the quantum\ntraining-process problem. We apply a simplified version of the GGE algorithm,\nwhere quantum effects are suppressed, to the classification of handwritten\ndigits in the MNIST database. While lower error rates can be found with other\nstate-of-the-art algorithms, we find that our algorithm reaches relatively low\nerror rates while learning a much smaller number of parameters than would be\nneeded in a traditional Boltzmann machine, thereby reducing computational cost. \n\n"}

The measured azimuthal anisotropy is shown to be not strongly dependent\non the assumed vertical-to-radial dispersion ratio of the ellipsoid. The\nanisotropy distribution shows a large diversity in the orbital structure of\ndisk galaxies from tangential to radial stellar orbits. Globally, the orbits\nare isotropic in inner disk regions and become more radial as a function of\nradius, although this picture tends to depend on galaxy morphology and\nluminosity. The Milky Way orbital anisotropy profile measured from the Second\nGaia Data Release is consistent with those of CALIFA galaxies.

In this work, we\ninvestigate the nature of these arc-like structures connected to the HL Tau\ndisk. We conducted new observations in the 13CO and C18O (3-2; 2-1) lines with\nJCMT and IRAM 30m, and obtained the ACA data with the 7-m array. With the\nsingle-dish, ACA, and ALMA data, we analyzed the gas motions on both 0.1 pc and\n1000 au scales in the HL Tau region. We constructed new kinematical models of\nan infalling and rotating envelope with the consideration of relative motion\nbetween HL Tau and the envelope. By including the relative motion between HL\nTau and its protostellar envelope, our kinematical model can explain the\nobserved velocity features in the arc-like structures. The morphologies of the\narc-like structures can also be explained with an asymmetric initial density\ndistribution in our model envelope. In addition, our single-dish results\nsupport that HL Tau is located at the edge of a large-scale (0.1 pc) expanding\nshell driven by the wind or outflow from XZ Tau, as suggested in the\nliterature. The estimated expanding velocity of the shell is comparable to the\nrelative velocity between HL Tau and its envelope in our kinematical model.\nThese results hints that the large-scale expanding motion likely impacts the\nprotostellar envelope around HL Tau and affects its gas kinematics. We found\nthat the mass infalling rate from the envelope onto the HL Tau disk can be\ndecreased by a factor of two due to this impact by the large-scale expanding\nshell. \n\n"}

We derived accurate stellar ages for the cluster NGC6530,\nassociated with the Lagoon Nebula to infer its SF history. We use the Gaia-ESO\nsurvey observations and Gaia DR2 data, to derive cluster membership and\nfundamental stellar parameters. We identified 652 confirmed and 9 probable\nmembers.

Fluid Accretion Abstract: When gas accretes onto a black hole, at a rate either much less than or much\ngreater than the Eddington rate, it is likely to do so in an \"adiabatic\" or\nradiatively inefficient manner. Under fluid (as opposed to MHD) conditions, the\ndisk should become convective and evolve toward a state of marginal\ninstability. The resulting disk structure is \"gyrentropic,\" with convection\nproceeding along common surfaces of constant angular momentum, Bernoulli\nfunction and entropy, called \"gyrentropes.\" We present a family of\ntwo-dimensional, self-similar models which describes the time-averaged disk\nstructure. We then suppose that there is a self-similar, Newtonian torque and\nthat the Prandtl number is large. This torque drives inflow and meridional\ncirculation and the resulting flow is computed. Convective transport will\nbecome ineffectual near the disk surface. It is conjectured that this will lead\nto a large increase of entropy across a \"thermal front\" which we identify as\nthe effective disk surface and the base of an outflow. The conservation of\nmass, momentum and energy across this thermal front permits a matching of the\ndisk models to self-similar outflow solutions. We then demonstrate that\nself-similar disk solutions can be matched smoothly onto relativistic flows at\nsmall radius and thin disks at large radius. This model of adiabatic accretion\nis contrasted with some alternative models that have been discussed recently.\nThe disk models developed in this paper should be useful for interpreting\nnumerical, fluid dynamical simulations. Related principles to those described\nhere may govern the behaviour of astrophysically relevant, magnetohydrodynamic\ndisk models. \n\n"}

A model of a single halo,\nas an isolated object with finite mass, follows by smoothly matching the NFW\nspacetime to a Schwarzschild vacuum exterior along the virial radius, the\nphysical \"cut-off'' customarily imposed, as the mass associated with NFW\nprofiles diverges asymptotically.

The treatment of an arbitrary number of fermions requires a\nmodification of the chemical potential, similar to the one proposed by\nLandsberg for Bose-condensed systems.

It has been found that as soon as such a factor is introduced to the\nBarabasi-Albert Scale-Free model, the network will be significantly\ntransformed. The network will be clustered even with infinitely large size, and\nthe clustering coefficient varies greatly with the intensity of the aging\neffect, i.e. it increases linearly with $\\beta $ for small values of $\\beta $\nand decays exponentially for large values of $\\beta $. At the same time, the\naging effect may also result in a hierarchical structure and a disassortative\ndegree-degree correlation.

The dynamics of s(t) in such a limit would\nbe diffusive, with a mean translocation time scaling as N^2 in the absence of a\nforce, and proportional to N when a force is applied. We demonstrate that the\nassumption of equilibrium must break down for sufficiently long polymers (more\neasily when forced), and provide lower bounds for the translocation time by\ncomparison to unimpeded motion of the polymer.

The first part of the paper\nconcerns the applications of methods used in classical differential geometry to\nstudy the chaotic dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. Starting from the identity\nbetween the trajectories of a dynamical system and the geodesics in its\nconfiguration space, a geometric theory of chaotic dynamics can be developed,\nwhich sheds new light on the origin of chaos in Hamiltonian systems. In fact,\nit appears that chaos can be induced not only by negative curvatures, as was\noriginally surmised, but also by positive curvatures, provided the curvatures\nare fluctuating along the geodesics. In the case of a system with a large\nnumber of degrees of freedom it is possible to give an analytical estimate of\nthe largest Lyapunov exponent by means of a geometric model independent of the\ndynamics. In the second part of the paper the phenomenon of phase transitions\nis addressed and it is here that topology comes into play. In fact, when a\nsystem undergoes a phase transition, the fluctuations of the\nconfiguration-space curvature exhibit a singular behavior at the phase\ntransition point, which can be qualitatively reproduced using geometric models.\nIn these models the origin of the singular behavior of the curvature\nfluctuations appears to be caused by a topological transition in configuration\nspace. This leads us to put forward a Topological Hypothesis (TH).

Both for\nensembles and individual orbits, as N increases there is a smooth convergence\ntowards a continuum limit. Discreteness effects are well modeled by Gaussian\nwhite noise with relaxation time t_R = const * (N/log L)t_D, with L the Coulomb\nlogarithm and t_D the dynamical time scale. Discreteness effects accelerate\nemittance growth for initially localised clumps. However, even allowing for\ndiscreteness effects one can distinguish between orbits which, in the continuum\nlimit, feel a regular potential, so that emittance grows as a power law in\ntime, and chaotic orbits, where emittance grows exponentially. For sufficiently\nlarge N, one can distinguish two different `kinds' of chaos. Short range\nmicrochaos, associated with close encounters between charges, is a generic\nfeature, yielding large positive Lyapunov exponents X_N which do not decrease\nwith increasing N even if the bulk potential is integrable. Alternatively,\nthere is the possibility of larger scale macrochaos, characterised by smaller\nLyapunov exponents X_S, which is present only if the bulk potential is chaotic.\nConventional computations of Lyapunov exponents probe X_N, leading to the\noxymoronic conclusion that N-body orbits which look nearly regular and have\nsharply peaked Fourier spectra are `very chaotic.' However, the `range' of the\nmicrochaos, set by the typical interparticle spacing, decreases as N increases,\nso that, for large N, this microchaos, albeit very strong, is largely\nirrelevant macroscopically.
