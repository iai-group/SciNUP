Results: The\nalpha-effect increases monotonically as rotation increases. Turbulent\ndiffusivity, eta_t, is proportional to the square of the turbulent vertical\nvelocity. Whereas eta_t decreases approximately inversely proportional to the\nwavenumber of the field, the alpha-effect and turbulent pumping show a more\ncomplex behaviour. In the presence of shear and no rotation a small\nalpha-effect is induced which does not seem to show any consistent trend as a\nfunction of shear. If the shear is large enough, this small alpha is able to\nexcite a dynamo in the mean-field model. The coefficient responsible for\ndriving the shear-current effect shows several sign changes as a function of\ndepth but is also able to contribute to dynamo action in the mean-field model.\nThe growth rates in these cases are well below those in direct simulations\nsuggesting that an incoherent alpha-shear dynamo may also act in them.

This has been\nachieved in one of two distinct ways: (1) by initializing the system in a\nquantum entangled state, and/or (2) by applying quantum communication channels.\nIn this paper, we explain why some of these prior claims are misleading, in the\nsense that they rely on changes to the model unrelated to quantum processing.\nOn the positive side, we consider the aforementioned quantum extensions when\napplied to Linial's well-established LOCAL model of distributed computing.\n  For both types of extensions, we put forward valid proof-of-concept examples\nof distributed problems whose round complexity is in fact reduced through\ngenuinely quantum effects, in contexts which do not depend on the anonymity of\nnodes.\n  Finally, we show that even the quantum variants of the LOCAL model have\nnon-trivial limitations, captured by a very simple (purely probabilistic)\nnotion which we call \"physical locality\" (PLOCAL). While this is strictly\nweaker than the \"computational locality\" of the classical LOCAL model, it\nnevertheless implies that for many distributed combinatorial optimization\nproblems, such as Maximal Independent Set, the best currently known lower time\nbounds cannot be broken by applying quantum processing, in any conceivable way. \n\n"}

The presence of E1 strength is solely due to\nthe Coulomb interaction between the protons and the resulting isospin-symmetry\nbreaking. The smallness of its value is related to the form of the transition\ndensity, due to translational invariance. The calculated values of E1 and ISD\nstrength carried by the IS-LED depend on the effective interaction used.\nAttention is drawn to the possibility that in N-not-equal-Z nuclei this\ndistinct mode of IS surface vibration can develop as such or mix strongly with\nskin modes and thus influence the pygmy dipole strength as well as the ISD\nstrength function. In general, theoretical models currently in use may be unfit\nto predict its precise position and strength, if at all its existence. \n\n"}

We show that in the theory there can be no a priori classical\ncurvature, with all curvature having to result from quantization. In the\nconformal theory gravity requires no independent quantization of its own, with\nit being quantized solely by virtue of its being coupled to a quantized matter\nsource. Moreover, because it is this very coupling that fixes the strength of\nthe gravitational field commutators, the gravity sector zero-point energy\ndensity and pressure fluctuations are then able to identically cancel the\nzero-point fluctuations associated with the matter sector.

If the early Universe contained only\nthe known standard-model particles ($g\\approx 100$), then the energy density at\nthe big bounce was about 15 times larger than the Planck energy. The minimum\nscale factor of the Universe (at the bounce) was about $10^{32}$ times smaller\nthan its present value, giving $\\approx 50 \\mum$.

In general, if\na large non-Gaussian signal exists at the start of reheating, it will remain\nnon zero at the end of reheating. Unless all isocurvature modes have completely\ndecayed before the start of reheating, we find that the non-linearity\nparameter, f_NL, can be sensitive to the reheating timescale, and that this\ndependence is most appreciable for `runaway' inflationary potentials that only\nhave a minimum in one direction.

We then confront these\nresults with the Planck data. The model is characterized by the quantity \\gamma\n= (g^2 Q^2)/H^2 (where g is the gauge coupling constant, Q the vector vev, and\nH the Hubble rate). For \\gamma < 2, the scalar perturbations show a strong\ntachyonic instability. In the stable region, the scalar power spectrum n_s is\ntoo low at small \\gamma, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio r is too high at\nlarge \\gamma.

Traditionally, they are included in a\nmean-field description of atomic nuclei through the approximate\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer or Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov formalism. Purpose: We\npropose a new hybrid ''relativistic-mean-field-plus-pairing'' approach in which\npairing is treated exactly so the number of particles is conserved. To verify\nthe reliability of the formalism, we apply it to the study of both ground-state\nproperties and isoscalar monopole excitations of the Tin isotopes. Methods:\nAccurately-calibrated relativistic mean-field models supplemented by an exact\ntreatment of pairing correlations are used to compute ground-state observables\nalong the isotopic chain in Tin. In turn, ground-state densities are used as\ninput to the calculation of giant monopole resonances through a\nconstrained-relativistic approach. Results: We compute a variety of\nground-state observables sensitive to pairing correlations as well as the\nevolution of giant monopole energies along the isotopic chain in Tin.

Due to rotations and gravity gradients, the classical\ntrajectories characterizing the motion of the wave packets for the two branches\nof the interferometer do not close in phase space, an effect which increases\nsignificantly with the interferometer time. The relative displacement between\nthe interfering wave packets in such open interferometers leads to a fringe\npattern in the density profile at each exit port and a loss of contrast in the\noscillations of the integrated particle number as a function of the phase\nshift. Paying particular attention to gravity gradients, we present a simple\nmitigation strategy involving small changes in the timing of the laser pulses\nwhich is very easy to implement.

In the low-redshift region the holographic dark energy\nmodels are degenerate with each other and with the $\\Lambda$CDM model in the\n$H(z)$ and $q(z)$ evolutions. In particular, the HDE model is highly degenerate\nwith the $\\Lambda$CDM model, and in the HDE model the cases with different\nparameter values are also in strong degeneracy. Since the observational data\nare mainly within the low-redshift region, it is very important to break this\nlow-redshift degeneracy in the $H(z)$ and $q(z)$ diagnostics by using some\nquantities with higher order derivatives of the scale factor. It is shown that\nthe statefinder diagnostic $r(z)$ is very useful in breaking the low-redshift\ndegeneracies. By employing the statefinder diagnostic the holographic dark\nenergy models can be differentiated efficiently in the low-redshift region.

Motivated by the\nprofound importance of the discovery of gravitational waves from the early\nUniverse, we examine to what extent a combination of Galactic foregrounds and\nlensed E-modes could be responsible for the signal. We reanalyze the BICEP2\nresults and show that the 100x150 GHz and 150x150 GHz data are consistent with\na cosmology with r=0.2 and negligible foregrounds, but also with a cosmology\nwith r=0 and a significant dust polarization signal. We give independent\nestimates of the dust polarization signal in the BICEP2 region using four\ndifferent approaches. While these approaches are consistent with each other,\nthe expected amplitude of the dust polarization power spectrum remains\nuncertain by about a factor of three. The lower end of the prediction leaves\nroom for a primordial contribution, but at the higher end the dust in\ncombination with the standard CMB lensing signal could account for the BICEP2\nobservations, without requiring the existence of primordial gravitational\nwaves. By measuring the cross-correlations between the pre-Planck templates\nused in the BICEP2 analysis and between different versions of a data-based\ntemplate, we emphasize that cross-correlations between models are very\nsensitive to noise in the polarization angles and that measured\ncross-correlations are likely underestimates of the contribution of foregrounds\nto the map. These results suggest that BICEP1 and BICEP2 data alone cannot\ndistinguish between foregrounds and a primordial gravitational wave signal, and\nthat future Keck Array observations at 100 GHz and Planck observations at\nhigher frequencies will be crucial to determine whether the signal is of\nprimordial origin.

Systematic calculations with the ImQMD model show that the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation found in the symmetric head-on fusion\nreactions at energies just above the Coulomb barrier fades out when the\nincident energy increases.

There is little systematic knowledge of the contribution\nof collective excitations to the interaction between nuclei, particularly in\nthe overlap region of heavy nuclei.\n  Purpose: To study the dynamic polarization potential (DPP) generated by\nchannel coupling that had been validated for a case where scattering is\nsensitive to the nuclear potential over a wide radial range; to exhibit\nevidence of the non-locality due to collective coupling; to validate, or\notherwise, the representation of DPPs by uniform renormalization of potentials.\n  Methods: S-matrix to potential inversion yields local potentials reproducing\nthe elastic channel S-matrix of coupled channel calculations. Subtracting the\nelastic channel uncoupled potential yields a local L-independent representation\nof the DPP. The dependence of the DPP on the nature of the coupled states and\nother parameters can be studied.\n  Results: Local DPPs were found due to the excitation of C-12 and the combined\nexcitation of O-16 and C-12. The radial forms found were very different from\nuniform renormalization of the potential. Full coupling led to a 10 percent\nincrease in the volume integral of the real potential. Evidence for the\nnon-locality of the underlying formal DPP and the effect of direct coupling\nbetween the collective states is found.\n  Conclusions: The local DPP generating the secondary rainbow is found. DPPs\nhave forms depending on the specific excitations and cannot be represented by a\nuniform renormalization of the potential. The method is useful for study of the\ncontribution of collective excitations to internuclear potentials, concerning\nwhich remarkably little is known in general. \n\n"}

In principle, a system that implements QEC can actually pass a\n\"break-even\" point and preserve quantum information for longer than the\nlifetime of its constituent parts. Reaching the break-even point, however, has\nthus far remained an outstanding and challenging goal.

However, these works primarily\nillustrate the signatures or scaling properties of QEC codes rather than test\nthe capacity of the system to extend the lifetime of quantum information over\ntime. Here we demonstrate a QEC system that reaches the break-even point by\nsuppressing the natural errors due to energy loss for a qubit logically encoded\nin superpositions of coherent states, or cat states of a superconducting\nresonator.

We first study the low energy excitations\nand the low temperature behavior of the free energy, which coincides with that\nof a $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1$\nwhen the chemical potential lies in the critical interval $(0,\\mathcal\nE(\\pi))$, $\\mathcal E(p)$ being the dispersion relation.

One compelling interpretation of the data is that it\ncaptures an $x_p$-dependent decrease in the average interaction strength of the\nnucleon in the projectile undergoing a hard scattering. A weakly interacting or\n\"shrinking\" nucleon in the projectile strikes fewer nucleons in the nucleus,\nresulting in a particular pattern of centrality-dependent modifications to\nhigh-$p_T$ processes.

The approach is based on the effective Feynman\ndiagrammatic method which allows to account for the relativistic effects\nimportant in the SRC domain. In addition to two-nucleon SRC with center of mass\nmotion we derive also the contribution of three-nucleon SRCs to the nuclear\nspectral functions. The latter is modeled based on the assumption that 3N SRCs\nare a product of two sequential short range NN interactions. This approach\nallowed us to express the 3N SRC part of the nuclear spectral function as a\nconvolution of two NN SRCs. Thus the knowledge of 2N SRCs allows us to model\nboth two- and three-nucleon SRC contributions to the spectral function.

Atoms in such traps often experience strongly spatially varying\nAC Stark shifts which are proportional to the magnetic quantum number of the\nrespective energy level.

Unfortunately, NMT systems are\nknown to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation\ninference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words.

Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder\nlayers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and\ntherefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom\nlayer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final\ntranslation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference\ncomputations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited\nset of common sub-word units (\"wordpieces\") for both input and output. This\nmethod provides a good balance between the flexibility of \"character\"-delimited\nmodels and the efficiency of \"word\"-delimited models, naturally handles\ntranslation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the\nsystem.

After refactoring, the gradients\nof the loss propagated by the chain rule through the graph are low variance\nunbiased estimators of the gradients of the expected loss.

This formula cannot be used to\ncalculate the gravitational field of disk galaxies, with their rich MOND\nphenomenology. Notably, it cannot predict their rotation curves, except\nasymptotically.

These phenomena are best understood using an often overlooked\nexplanation for the equilibrium Fe-As bond geometry, which is set by a\ncompetition between covalent bonding and exchange splitting between strongly\nhybridized Fe $3d$ and As $4p$ states. In this framework, the collapsed\ntetragonal phase emerges when covalent bonding completely wins out over\nexchange splitting. Thus the collapsed tetragonal phase is properly understood\nas a strong, covalent phase that is fully nonmagnetic with the As-As bond\nforming as a byproduct. \n\n"}

Gate error\nstems from a combination of control errors and random single qubit errors from\ninteraction with the environment. While great strides have been made in\nmitigating control errors, intrinsic qubit error remains a serious problem that\nsets the primary limit for gate fidelity in modern superconducting qubit\narchitectures. Simultaneously, recent developments of small error-corrected\nlogical qubit devices promise significant increases in logical state lifetime,\nbut translating those improvements into increases in gate fidelity is a complex\nchallenge. In this Letter, we propose a new formalism for implementing gates on\nand between small logical qubit devices which inherit the parent device's\ntolerance to single qubit errors which occur at any time before or during the\ngate.

Here we show that the state collapse rules of the von Neumann or\nL\\\"{u}ders-type measurements, as special cases of genuinely incoherent\noperations (GIO), are consistent with the resource theories of quantum\ncoherence.

We\nsupposed that the system state is governed by the quantum master equation\n(QME). We investigated the quantum pump and the excess entropy production. In\nthe first half of the thesis, we investigated the quantum pump using the full\ncounting statistics with quantum master equation (FCS-QME) approach. In the\nlatter part of the thesis, we investigated the excess entropy production. The\naverage entropy production is composed of the time integral of the\ninstantaneous steady entropy production rate and the excess entropy production.\nWe define average entropy production rate using the average energy and particle\ncurrents, which are calculated by using the full counting statistics with QME.\nThe excess entropy production is given by a line integral in the control\nparameter space and its integrand is called the Berry-Sinitsyn-Nemenman (BSN)\nvector. In the weakly nonequilibrium regime, we show that BSN vector is\ndescribed by $\\ln \\rho_0^{(-1)}$ and $\\rho_0$ where $\\rho_0$ is the\ninstantaneous steady state of the QME and $\\rho_0^{(-1)}$ is that of the QME\nwhich is given by reversing the sign of the Lamb shift term. In general, the\npotential dose not exist. The origins of the non-existence of the potential are\na quantum effect (the Lamb shift) and the breaking of the time-reversal\nsymmetry. The non-existence of the potential means that the excess entropy\nessentially depends on the path of the modulation. If the system Hamiltonian is\nnon-degenerate or the Lamb shift term is negligible, the excess entropy\nproduction approximately reduces to the difference between the von Neumann\nentropies of the system. We pointed out that the expression of the entropy\nproduction obtained in the classical Markov jump process is different from our\nresult and showed that these are approximately equivalent only in the weakly\nnonequilibrium regime. \n\n"}

A threshold $\\zeta_{\\rm th}$ for the\ncurvature perturbation is somewhat inappropriate for this purpose, because it\ndepends significantly on environmental effects, not essential to the local\ndynamics. By contrast, a threshold $\\delta_{\\rm th}$ for the density\nperturbation at horizon crossing seems to provide a more robust criterion.

Information reconciliation is a part of CPP in\nwhich parties are given correlated variables and attempt to eliminate the\ndiscrepancies between them while disclosing a minimum amount of information.\nThe elegant reconciliation protocol known as \\emph{Cascade} was developed\nspecifically for QKD in 1992 and has become the de-facto standard for all QKD\nimplementations. However, the protocol is highly interactive. Thus, other\nprotocols based on linear block codes such as Hamming codes, low-density\nparity-check (LDPC) codes, and polar codes have been researched. In particular,\nreconciliation using LDPC codes has been mainly studied because of its\noutstanding performance. Nevertheless, with small block size, the bit error\nrate performance of polar codes under successive-cancellation list (SCL)\ndecoding with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is comparable to state-of-the-art\nturbo and LDPC codes.

The\n  case of a single planet Abstract: A large planet orbiting a star in a protoplanetary disk opens a density gap\nalong its orbit due to the strong disk-planet interaction and migrates with the\ngap in the disk. It is expected that in the ideal case, a gap-opening planet\nmigrates at the viscous drift speed, which is referred to as type II migration.\nHowever, recent hydrodynamic simulations have shown that in general, the\ngap-opening planet is not locked to the viscous disk evolution. A new physical\nmodel is required to explain the migration speed of such a planet. For this\nreason, we re-examined the migration of a planet in the disk, by carrying out\nthe two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in a wide parameter range. We have\nfound that the torque exerted on the gap-opening planet depends on the surface\ndensity at the bottom of the gap. The planet migration slows down as the\nsurface density of the bottom of the gap decreases. Using the gap model\ndeveloped in our previous studies, we have constructed an empirical formula of\nthe migration speed of the gap-opening planets, which is consistent with the\nresults given by the hydrodynamic simulations performed by us and other\nresearchers.

Switching on an interaction between the two subsystems\nleads to feedback effects which result in a rich dynamical structure in both of\nthem. Such feedback features are studied on the basis of the flow equation\ntechnique - an infinite series of infinitesimal unitary transformations - which\nleads to a gradual elimination of the inter-subsystem interaction. As a result\nthe two subsystems get decoupled but their renormalized kinetic energies become\nmutually dependent on each other. Choosing for the inter - subsystem\ninteraction a charge exchange term (the Boson-Fermion model) the initially\nlocalized Bosons acquire itinerancy through their dependence on the\nrenormalized Fermion dispersion.

The approach is inspired by the mathematical formalisms that have\nbeen developed in axiomatic quantum mechanics, where a specific type of quantum\ncontextuality is modelled.

The problem turns out\nto be ill-posed since we do not know which representation of the algebra of\ncanonical commutation relations (CCR) to choose for field quantization. Once we\nmake a choice, we can solve the question of entanglement unambiguously. So the\ndifficulty is not with mathematics, but with physics of the problem. In order\nto make the discussion explicit we analyze from this perspective a popular\nargument based on a photon leaving a beam splitter and interacting with two\ntwo-level atoms. We first solve the problem algebraically in Heisenberg\npicture, without any assumption about the form of representation of CCR. Then\nwe take the $\\infty$-representation and show in two ways that in two-mode\nstates the modes are maximally entangled with vacuum, but single-mode states\nare not entangled. Next we repeat the analysis in terms of the representation\nof CCR taken from Berezin's book and show that two-mode states do not involve\nthe mode-vacuum entanglement. Finally, we switch to a family of reducible\nrepresentations of CCR recently investigated in the context of field\nquantization, and show that the entanglement with vacuum is present even for\nsingle-mode states. Still, the degree of entanglement is here difficult to\nestimate, mainly because there are $N+2$ subsystems, with $N$ unspecified and\nlarge. \n\n"}
