In these cases the asymptotic expansions of the free\nenergies given by the logarithm of the partition functions lead to the\ndispersionless (i.e. continuous) limits for the Toda and Pfaff lattice\nhierarchies. There is a universality between all three ensembles of random\nmatrices, one consequence of which is that the leading orders of the free\nenergy for large matrices agree.

As\na consequence one obtains a generalization of the following theorem of Youngs:\nIf a quadrangulation of the projective plane is not bipartite it has chromatic\nnumber four. The generalization states that in this case the local chromatic\nnumber is also four. Both papers [1] and [13] generalize Youngs's result to\narbitrary non-orientable surfaces replacing the condition of the graph being\nnot bipartite by a more technical condition of an odd quadrangulation. This\npaper investigates when these general results are true for the local chromatic\nnumber instead of the chromatic number. Surprisingly, we find out that (unlike\nin the case of the chromatic number) this depends on the genus of the surface.\nFor the non-orientable surfaces of genus at most four, the local chromatic\nnumber of any odd quadrangulation is at least four, but this is not true for\nnon-orientable surfaces of genus 5 or higher.

In the focus of this paper\nlies a simplicial complex K_P which carries complete information about the\ncombinatorial type of P. In the case when P is simple, K_P is the same as dP*,\nwhere P* is a polar dual polytope. Using the canonical embedding of a polytope\nP into nonnegative orthant, we introduce a moment-angle space Z_P for a\npolytope P. It is known, that in the case when P is simple the space Z_P is\nhomeomorphic to the polyhedral product (D^2,S^1)^{K_P}. When P is not simple,\nwe prove that the space Z_P is homotopically equivalent to the space\n(D^2,S^1)^{K_P}. This allows to introduce bigraded Betti numbers for any convex\npolytope. A Stanley-Reisner ring of a polytope P can be defined as a\nStanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex K_P. All these considerations lead\nto a natural question: which simplicial complexes arise as K_P for some\npolytope P? We have proceeded in this direction by introducing a notion of a\npolytopic simplicial complex. It has the following property: link of each\nsimplex in a polytopic complex is either contractible, or retractible to a\nsubcomplex, homeomorphic to a sphere. The complex K_P is a polytopic simplicial\ncomplex for any polytope P. Links of so called face simplices in a polytopic\ncomplex are polytopic complexes as well. This fact is sufficient enough to\nconnect face polynomial of a simplicial complex K_P to the face polynomial of a\npolytope P, giving a series of inequalities on certain combinatorial\ncharacteristics of P. Two of these inequalities are equalities for each P and\nrepresent Euler-Poincare formula and one of Bayer-Billera relations for flag\nf-numbers.

For the analogous Rosenbluth algorithm, which samples unconfined\nself-avoiding walks of length n, the variance of the corresponding estimator is\nbelieved to be exponential in n. A few years ago, Bassetti and Diaconis showed\nthat, for a sampler \\`a la Knuth, that generates walks crossing a k\\times k\nsquare and consisting of North and East steps, the relative variance is only\nO(\\sqrt k).

In the eighties, three physicists, Knizhnik, Polyakov et\nZamolodchikov (KPZ) came up in \\cite{\\KPZ} with a novel and far-reaching\napproach in order to understand the critical behavior of these models. Among\nthese, one finds for example random walks, percolation as well as the Ising\nmodel. The main underlying idea of their approach is to study these models\nalong a two-step procedure as follows: a/ First of all, instead of considering\nthe model on some regular lattice of the plane (such as $\\Z^2$ for example),\none defines it instead on a well-chosen \"random planar lattice\". Doing so\ncorresponds to studying the model in its {\\it quantum gravity} form. In the\ncase of percolation, the appropriate choice of random lattice matches with the\nso-called planar maps. b/ Then it remains to get back to the actual {\\it\nEuclidean} setup. This is done thanks to the celebrated {\\bf KPZ formula} which\ngives a very precise correspondence between the geometric properties of models\nin their quantum gravity formulation and their analogs in the Euclidean case.\n  The nature and the origin of such a powerful correspondence remained rather\nmysterious for a long time. In fact, the KPZ formula is still not rigorously\nestablished and remains a conjectural correspondence. The purpose of this\nsurvey is to explain how the recent work of Duplantier and Sheffield enables to\nexplain some of the mystery hidden behind this KPZ formula. To summarize their\ncontribution in one sentence, their work implies a beautiful interpretation of\nthe KPZ correpondence through a uniformization of the random lattice, seen as a\nRiemann surface. \n\n"}

In particular, we consider Glauber (block)\ndynamics. We show a dramatic improvement on the bounds for rapid mixing in\nterms of the number of colours and the fugacity for the corresponding models.\nFor both models the bounds we get are only within small constant factors from\nthe conjectured ones by the statistical physicists.\n  We use Path Coupling to show rapid mixing. For k and \\lambda in the range of\nour interest the technical challenge is to cope with the high degree vertices,\ni.e. vertices of degree much larger than the expected degree d. The usual\napproach to this problem is to consider block updates rather than single vertex\nupdates for the Markov chain. Taking appropriately defined blocks the effect of\nhigh degree vertices somehow diminishes. However, devising such a construction\nof blocks is a highly non trivial task.\n  We develop for a first time a weighting schema for the paths of the\nunderlying graph. Vertices which belong to \"light\" paths, only, can be placed\nat the boundaries of the blocks. Then the tree-like local structure of G(n,d/n)\nallows the construction of simple structured blocks. \n\n"}

First, we provide a new interpretation of\nShemer's classical Sewing Construction for neighborly polytopes in terms of\nlexicographic extensions of oriented matroids. This allows us to provide a\nsimplified proof and to generalize it to oriented matroids in two ways: the\nExtended Sewing Construction and the Gale Sewing Construction. Estimating the\nnumber of polytopes constructed with the later, we can provide new lower bounds\nfor the number of combinatorial types of neighborly polytopes that even improve\nthe current best bounds for the number of polytopes. The combination of both\nnew techniques also allows us to construct many non-realizable neighborly\noriented matroids.\n  The degree of a point configuration is the maximal codimension of its\ninterior faces. The second part of the thesis presents various results on the\ncombinatorial structure of point configurations whose degree is small compared\nto their dimension; specifically, those whose degree is smaller than [(d+1)/2],\nthe degree of neighborly polytopes. The study of this problem comes motivated\nby Ehrhart theory, where a notion equivalent to the degree - for lattice\npolytopes - has been widely studied during the last years.

By contrast, it has been\nargued in the science literature that such networks are highly vulnerable to a\ntargeted attack, and removing a small number of key nodes in the network will\ndramatically change the topological structure. Here we analyse a class of\npreferential attachment networks in the robust regime and prove four main\nresults supporting this claim: After removal of an arbitrarily small proportion\nepsilon>0 of the oldest nodes (1) the asymptotic degree distribution has\nexponential instead of power law tails; (2) the largest degree in the network\ndrops from being of the order of a power of the network size n to being just\nlogarithmic in n; (3) the typical distances in the network increase from order\nlog log n to order log n; and (4) the network becomes vulnerable to random\nremoval of nodes. Importantly, all our results explicitly quantify the\ndependence on the proportion epsilon of removed vertices. For example, we show\nthat the critical proportion of nodes that have to be retained for survival of\nthe giant component undergoes a steep increase as epsilon moves away from zero,\nand a comparison of this result with similar ones for other networks reveals\nthe existence of two different universality classes of robust network models.\nThe key technique in our proofs is a local approximation of the network by a\nbranching random walk with two killing boundaries, and an understanding of the\nparticle genealogies in this process, which enters into estimates for the\nspectral radius of an associated operator. \n\n"}

We believe that our approach via tropical mirror symmetry naturally\ncarries the potential of being generalized to more adventurous situations of\nmirror symmetry. Moreover, our tropical approach has the advantage that all\ninvolved invariants are easy to compute. Furthermore, we can use the techniques\nfor computing Feynman integrals to prove that they are quasimodular forms.\nAlso, as a side product, we can give a combinatorial characterization of\nFeynman graphs for which the corresponding integrals are zero. More generally,\nthe tropical mirror symmetry theorem gives a natural interpretation of the\nA-model side (i.e., the generating function of Gromov-Witten invariants) in\nterms of a sum over Feynman graphs. Hence our quasimodularity result becomes\nmeaningful on the A-model side as well. Our theoretical results are\ncomplemented by a Singular package including several procedures that can be\nused to compute Hurwitz numbers of the elliptic curve as integrals over Feynman\ngraphs. \n\n"}

The $k$-connectivity property quantifies how resilient is the\nconnectivity of a graph against node or edge failures. On the other hand,\n$k$-robustness measures the effectiveness of local diffusion strategies (that\ndo not use global graph topology information) in spreading information over the\ngraph in the presence of misbehaving nodes. In addition to presenting the\nresults under the general random intersection graph model, we consider two\nspecial cases of the general model, a binomial random intersection graph and a\nuniform random intersection graph, which both have numerous applications as\nwell. For these two specialized graphs, our results on asymptotically exact\nprobabilities of $k$-connectivity and asymptotic zero-one laws for\n$k$-robustness are also novel in the literature. \n\n"}

{"id": "1710.11513", "contents": "Title: Designing RNA Secondary Structures is Hard Abstract: An RNA sequence is a word over an alphabet on four elements $\\{A,C,G,U\\}$\ncalled bases. RNA sequences fold into secondary structures where some bases\nmatch one another while others remain unpaired. Pseudoknot-free secondary\nstructures can be represented as well-parenthesized expressions with additional\ndots, where pairs of matching parentheses symbolize paired bases and dots,\nunpaired bases. The two fundamental problems in RNA algorithmic are to predict\nhow sequences fold within some model of energy and to design sequences of bases\nwhich will fold into targeted secondary structures. Predicting how a given RNA\nsequence folds into a pseudoknot-free secondary structure is known to be\nsolvable in cubic time since the eighties and in truly subcubic time by a\nrecent result of Bringmann et al. (FOCS 2016). As a stark contrast, it is\nunknown whether or not designing a given RNA secondary structure is a tractable\ntask; this has been raised as a challenging open question by Anne Condon (ICALP\n2003). Because of its crucial importance in a number of fields such as\npharmaceutical research and biochemistry, there are dozens of heuristics and\nsoftware libraries dedicated to RNA secondary structure design. It is therefore\nrather surprising that the computational complexity of this central problem in\nbioinformatics has been unsettled for decades.\n  In this paper we show that, in the simplest model of energy which is the\nWatson-Crick model the design of secondary structures is NP-complete if one\nadds natural constraints of the form: index $i$ of the sequence has to be\nlabeled by base $b$. This negative result suggests that the same lower bound\nholds for more realistic models of energy. It is noteworthy that the additional\nconstraints are by no means artificial: they are provided by all the RNA design\npieces of software and they do correspond to the actual practice. \n\n"}

Usually, these interactions are abstractions of the\ncommunication/diffusion channels between the units of the system. Real complex\nnetworks, e.g. traffic networks, reveal different operation phases governed by\nthe dynamical stress of the system. Here we show how, communicability, a\ntopological descriptor that reveals the efficiency of the network functionality\nin terms of these diffusive paths, could be used to reveal the transitions\nmentioned. By considering a vibrational model of nodes and edges in a\ngraph/network at a given temperature (stress), we show that the communicability\nfunction plays the role of the thermal Green's function of a network of\nharmonic oscillators. After, we prove analytically the existence of a universal\nphase transition in the communicability structure of every simple graph. This\ntransition resembles the melting process occurring in solids. For instance,\nregular-like graphs resembling crystals, melts at lower temperatures and\ndisplay a sharper transition between connected to disconnected structures than\nthe random spatial graphs, which resemble amorphous solids. Finally, we study\ncomputationally this graph melting process in some real-world networks and\nobserve that the rate of melting of graphs changes either as an exponential or\nas a power-law with the inverse temperature.

The study of Gromov hyperbolicity for geodesic metric spaces can be\nreduced to the study of graph hyperbolicity. The main contribution of this\npaper is a new characterization of the hyperbolicity of graphs. This\ncharacterization has algorithmic implications in the field of large-scale\nnetwork analysis. A sharp estimate of graph hyperbolicity is useful, e.g., in\nembedding an undirected graph into hyperbolic space with minimum distortion\n[Verbeek and Suri, SoCG'14]. The hyperbolicity of a graph can be computed in\npolynomial-time, however it is unlikely that it can be done in subcubic time.\nThis makes this parameter difficult to compute or to approximate on large\ngraphs. Using our new characterization of graph hyperbolicity, we provide a\nsimple factor 8 approximation algorithm for computing the hyperbolicity of an\n$n$-vertex graph $G=(V,E)$ in optimal time $O(n^2)$ (assuming that the input is\nthe distance matrix of the graph). This algorithm leads to constant factor\napproximations of other graph-parameters related to hyperbolicity (thinness,\nslimness, and insize). We also present the first efficient algorithms for exact\ncomputation of these parameters. All of our algorithms can be used to\napproximate the hyperbolicity of a geodesic metric space.\n  We also show that a similar characterization of hyperbolicity holds for all\ngeodesic metric spaces endowed with a geodesic spanning tree. Along the way, we\nprove that any complete geodesic metric space $(X,d)$ has such a geodesic\nspanning tree. We hope that this fundamental result can be useful in other\ncontexts. \n\n"}

The first problem is related to random graph statistics. We\nconsider a certain class of Galton-Watson random trees and look at the total\nheight statistic. We provide an automated procedure for computing values of the\nmoments of this statistic.\n  Next, we investigate several problems related to lattice paths staying below\na line of rational slope. These results are largely data-based. Using the\ngenerated data, we are able to find recurrences for the number of such paths\nfor the cases of slopes 3/2 and 5/2. There is also investigation of a\ngeneralization of these problems to three dimensions.\n  We also examine generalizations of Sister Celine's method and Gosper's\nalgorithm for evaluating summations. For both, we greatly extend the classes of\napplicable functions and applications to proving, or reproving in an automated\nway, interesting combinatorial problems. For the generalization of Sister\nCeline's method, we allow summations of arbitrary products of hypergeometric\nterms and linear recurrent sequences with rational coefficients.\n  We also show a partial result related to the bunk bed conjecture, a problem\nconcerning random finite graphs.

This motivates\nthe study of the local chromatic number of graphs for which these quantities\nare far apart. Such graphs include Kneser graphs, their vertex color-critical\nsubgraphs, the Schrijver (or stable Kneser) graphs; Mycielski graphs, and their\ngeneralizations; and Borsuk graphs. We give more or less tight bounds for the\nlocal chromatic number of many of these graphs.\n  We use an old topological result of Ky Fan which generalizes the Borsuk-Ulam\ntheorem. It implies the existence of a multicolored copy of the balanced\ncomplete bipartite graph on t points in every proper coloring of many graphs\nwhose chromatic number t is determined via a topological argument. (This was in\nparticular noted for Kneser graphs by Ky Fan.) This yields a lower bound of\nt/2+1 for the local chromatic number of these graphs. We show this bound to be\ntight or almost tight in many cases.\n  As another consequence of the above we prove that the graphs considered here\nhave equal circular and ordinary chromatic numbers if the latter is even.

{"id": "math/9907183", "contents": "Title: On Multi-color partitions and the generalized Rogers-Ramanujan\n  identities Abstract: Basil Gordon, in the sixties, and George Andrews, in the seventies,\ngeneralized the Rogers-Ramanujan identities to higher moduli. These identities\narise in many areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. One of these areas\nis representation theory of infinite dimensional Lie algebras, where various\nknown interpretations of these identities have led to interesting applications.\nMotivated by their connections with Lie algebra representation theory, we give\na new interpretation of a sum related to generalized Rogers-Ramanujan\nidentities in terms of multi-color partitions. \n\n"}
