By\nanalysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse\nproximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:\nQSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,\n$\\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\\vartheta=16.28$\narcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably\ncreated by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the\ncorresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of\nthe extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the\nUV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three\nforeground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background\nmodels dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal\nline systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints\non the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars\nshow a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of\nthe UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.\nThus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in\noverdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.\nFurthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative\ntransfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed\nspectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of\nQSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr. \n\n"}

Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO\n137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses.

We generalize this\napproach to the case of non-radial global modes. This enables us to estimate\nthe energy supplied to high-($\\ell$) acoustic modes. Qualitative arguments as\nwell as numerical calculations are used to illustrate the results. We find that\nnon-radial effects for $p$ modes are non-negligible:\n  - for high-$n$ modes (i.e. typically $n > 3$) and for high values of $\\ell$;\nthe power supplied to the oscillations depends on the mode inertia.\n  - for low-$n$ modes, independent of the value of $\\ell$, the excitation is\ndominated by the non-diagonal components of the Reynolds stress term. We\ncarried out a numerical investigation of high-$\\ell$ $p$ modes and we find that\nthe validity of the present formalism is limited to $\\ell < 500$ due to the\nspatial separation of scale assumption. Thus, a model for very high-$\\ell$\n$p$-mode excitation rates calls for further theoretical developments, however\nthe formalism is valid for solar $g$ modes, which will be investigated in a\npaper in preparation. \n\n"}

For\nconformal gravity to be phenomenologically viable requires that the conformal\nsymmetry is not manifest at the energy scales of the other known physical\nforces. Hence we require a mechanism for the spontaneous breaking of conformal\ninvariance. In this paper we study the possibility that conformal invariance is\nspontaneously broken due to interactions with conformally coupled matter\nfields. The vacuum of the theory admits conformally non-invariant solutions\ncorresponding to maximally symmetric space-times and variants thereof. These\nare either de Sitter space-time or anti-de Sitter space-time in the full four\nspace-time dimensions or in a lower dimensional sub-space. We consider in\nparticular normalizable, linearized gravitational perturbations around the\nanti-de Sitter background. Exploiting the conformal flatness of this\nspace-time, we show to second order, that these gravitational fluctuations,\nthat are taken to be fourier decomposable, carry zero energy-momentum. This\nsquares well with the theorem that asymptotically flat space-times conformal\ngravity contain zero energy and momentum \\cite{bhs}. We also show the\npossibility of domain wall solitons interpolating between the ground states of\nspontaneously broken conformal symmetry that we have found.

Spectral energy\ndistributions are constructed, sampling a wide range of properties such as age,\nstar formation rate (SFR), dust obscuration and metallicity. By summing the\nSFRs in the pixels, we demonstrate that the distribution of total galaxy SFR\nshifts to lower values as the local density of surrounding galaxies increases,\nas found in other studies.

Abstract: The prediction that (due to the limited amount of hydrogen available as fuel\nin the Sun) the future duration of our favourable terrestrial environment will\nbe short (compared with the present age of the Earth) has been interpreted as\nevidence for a hard step scenario. This means that some of the essential steps\n(such as the development of eukaryotes) in the evolution process leading to the\nultimate emergence of intelligent life would have been hard, in the sense of\nbeing against the odds in the available time, so that they are unlikely to have\nbeen achieved in most of the earth-like planets that may one day be discovered\nin nearby extra-solar systems. It was originally estimated that only one or two\nof the essential evolutionary steps had to have been hard in this sense, but it\nhas become apparent that this figure may need upward revision, because recent\nstudies of climatic instability suggest that the possible future duration of\nour biologically favourable environment may be shorter than had been supposed,\nonly about one Giga year rather than five.

The three stages involves a neutron star phase, a quark star (QS)\nand a black hole phase as described in Staff et al. (2007). We find that the QS\nstage allows for more energy to be extracted from neutron star to QS conversion\nas well as from ensuing accretion onto the QS. The QS accretion phase naturally\nextends the engine activity and can account for both the prompt emission and\nirregular early X-ray afterglow activity. Following the accretion phase, the QS\ncan spin-down by emission of a baryon-free outflow. The magnetar-like magnetic\nfield strengths resulting from the NS to QS transition provide enough spin-down\nenergy, for the correct amount of time, to account for the plateau in the X-ray\nafterglow. In our model, a sharp drop-off following the plateau occurs when the\nQS collapses to a BH during the spin-down, thus shutting-off the secondary\noutflow.

No absorption features at\nnegative velocities strongly argue against the widely-used large distance of 19\nto 21 kpc for Kes 75, and show that Kes 75 is within the Solar circle, i.e. a\ndistance $d<$13.2 kpc.

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers\nafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably\ndissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be\napproximately proportional to the increase in mass. This model successfully\nreproduces the observed evolution since z~2 in the mean size and in the\ncomoving mass density of massive early-type galaxies.

The theoretical results are used to develop models of\nbinary or multiple system formation from RPPs, and explain the observation that\na greater fraction of binaries originated farther from the Sun. At the stage of\nRPPs, small-body satellites can form in two ways: a merger between RPPs can\nhave two centers of contraction, or the formation of satellites from a disc\naround the primary or the secondary. Formation of the disc can be caused by\nthat the angular momentum of the RPP formed by the merger is greater than the\ncritical angular momentum for a solid body.

The survey data consists of images taken\nwith ACS on HST, supplemented with archival data and new WFPC2 imaging taken\nafter the failure of ACS. Survey images include wide field tilings covering the\nfull radial extent of each galaxy, and single deep pointings in uncrowded\nregions of the most massive galaxies in the volume. The new wide field imaging\nin ANGST reaches median 50% completenesses of m_F475W=28.0 mag, m_F606W=27.3\nmag, and m_F814W=27.3 mag, several magnitudes below the tip of the red giant\nbranch (TRGB). The deep fields reach magnitudes sufficient to fully resolve the\nstructure in the red clump. The resulting photometric catalogs are publicly\naccessible and contain over 34 million photometric measurements of >14 million\nstars. In this paper we present the details of the sample selection, imaging,\ndata reduction, and the resulting photometric catalogs, along with an analysis\nof the photometric uncertainties (systematic and random), for both the ACS and\nWFPC2 imaging.

Structures on the stellar photosphere have been detected in the\nvisible and near-infrared as well as a compact molecular environment called the\nMOLsphere. Mid-infrared observations have revealed the nature of some of the\nmolecules in the MOLsphere, some being the precursor of dust. Aims: Betelgeuse\nis an excellent candidate to understand the process of mass loss in red\nsupergiants. Using diffraction-limited adaptive optics (AO) in the\nnear-infrared, we probe the photosphere and close environment of Betelgeuse to\nstudy the wavelength dependence of its extension, and to search for\nasymmetries. Methods: We obtained AO images with the VLT/NACO instrument,\ntaking advantage of the \"cube\" mode of the CONICA camera to record separately a\nlarge number of short-exposure frames. This allowed us to adopt a \"lucky\nimaging\" approach for the data reduction, and obtain diffraction-limited images\nover the spectral range 1.04-2.17 $\\mu$m in 10 narrow-band filters. Results: In\nall filters, the photosphere of Betelgeuse appears partly resolved.

The CN molecule provides an excellent match to the\n1.09 mic bandhead in absorption in front of the stellar photosphere, but the\nemission spectrum of the plume is more difficult to interpret. Conclusions: Our\nAO images show that the envelope surrounding Betelgeuse has a complex and\nirregular structure.

At the\nsame time, recent work has shown that thermal conduction in clusters is likely\na time-variable phenomenon. We consider if time-variable conduction and AGN\noutbursts could be responsible for the cool-core (CC), non cool-core (NCC)\ndichotomy. We show that strong AGN heating can bring a CC cluster to a NCC\nstate, which can be stably maintained by conductive heating from the cluster\noutskirts. On the other hand, if conduction is shut off by the heat-flux driven\nbuoyancy instability, then the cluster will cool to the CC state again, where\nit is stabilized by low-level AGN heating. Thus, the cluster cycles between CC\nand NCC states. In contrast with massive clusters, we predict the CC/NCC\nbimodality should vanish in groups, due to the lesser role of conductive\nheating there.

The spatial\ndistribution of the metals are studied using radial metallicity profiles and 2D\nmetallicity maps of the model clusters as they would be observed by X-ray\ntelescopes like XMM-Newton. Analytical approximations for the mass loss by\ngalactic winds driven by thermal and cosmic ray pressure are derived from the\nBernoulli equation and implemented in combined N-body/hydrodynamic cosmological\nsimulations with a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. Observable\nquantities like the mean metallicity, metallicity profiles, and 2D metal maps\nof the model clusters are derived from the simulations. We find that galactic\nwinds alone cannot account for the observed metallicity of the ICM. At redshift\n$z=0$ the model clusters have metallicities originating from galactic winds\nwhich are almost a factor of 10 lower than the observed values. For massive,\nrelaxed clusters we find, as in previous studies, a central drop in the\nmetallicity due to a suppression of the galactic winds by the pressure of the\nambient ICM.

In this paper we use the different metallicity\ndependance of X-ray photoevaporation and planet formation to discriminate\nbetween these two processes. We study the effects of metallicity, Z, on the\ndispersal timescale, t_phot, in the context of a photoevaporation model, by\nmeans of detailed thermal calculations of a disc in hydrostatic equilibrium\nirradiated by EUV and X-ray radiation from the central source.

By means of analytical\nestimates we derive instead a much stronger negative power dependance on\nmetallicity of the disc lifetime for a dispersal model based on planet\nformation. A census of disc fractions in lower metallicity regions should\ntherefore be able to distinguish between the two models.

Unfortunately the large\nGunn-Peterson optical depth of the surrounding neutral intergalactic medium\n(IGM) is thought to render this line extremely difficult to detect prior to\nreionization. In this paper we demonstrate that the radiative transfer effects\nin the interstellar medium (ISM), which cause Lya flux to emerge from galaxies\nat frequencies where the Gunn-Peterson optical depth is reduced, can\nsubstantially enhance the prospects for detection of the Lya line at high\nredshift. In particular, scattering off outflows of interstellar HI gas can\nmodify the Lya spectral line shape such that >5% of the emitted Lya radiation\nis transmitted directly to the observer, even through a fully neutral IGM. It\nmay therefore be possible to directly observe `strong' Lya emission lines (EW >\n50 Angstrom rest frame) from the highest redshift galaxies that reside in the\nsmallest HII `bubbles' early in the reionization era with JWST. In addition, we\nshow that outflows can boost the fraction of Lya radiation that is transmitted\nthrough the IGM during the latter stages of reionization, and even\npost-reionization. Coupled with the fact that the first generation of galaxies\nare thought to have very large intrinsic equivalent Lya equivalent widths, our\nresults suggest that the search for galaxies in their redshifted Lya emission\nline can be competitive with the drop-out technique out to the highest\nredshifts that can be probed in the JWST era. \n\n"}

Sufficient quantities of molecular gas are available in most BCGs to\npower their AGN by accretion alone. However, we find no correlation between AGN\npower and molecular gas mass over the range of jet power considered here. For a\ngiven AGN power, the BCG's gas mass and accretion efficiency, defined as the\nfraction of the available cold molecular gas that is required to power the AGN,\nboth vary by more than two orders of magnitude. Most of the molecular gas in\nBCGs is apparently consumed by star formation or is driven out of the nucleus\nby the AGN before it reaches the nuclear black hole. Bondi accretion from hot\natmospheres is generally unable to fuel powerful AGN, unless their black holes\nare more massive than their bulge luminosities imply.

Abstract: Recent studies emphasize that an empirical relation between the stellar mass\nof galaxies and the mass of their host dark matter subhaloes can predict the\nclustering of galaxies and its evolution with cosmic time. In this paper we\nstudy the assumptions made by this methodology using a semi-analytical model\n(SAM). To this end, we randomly swap between the locations of model galaxies\nwithin a narrow range of subhalo mass (M_infall). We find that shuffled samples\nof galaxies have different auto-correlation functions in comparison with the\noriginal model galaxies. This difference is significant even if central and\nsatellite galaxies are allowed to follow a different relation between M_infall\nand stellar mass, and can reach a factor of 2 for massive galaxies at redshift\nzero. We analyze three features within SAMs that contribute to this effect: a)\nThe relation between stellar mass and subhalo mass evolves with redshift for\ncentral galaxies, affecting satellite galaxies at the time of infall. b) The\nstellar mass of galaxies falling into groups and clusters at high redshift is\ndifferent from the mass of central galaxies at the same time. c) The stellar\nmass growth for satellite galaxies after infall can be significant and depends\non the infall redshift and the group mass. We show that the above is true for\ndiffering SAMs, and that the effect is sensitive to the treatment of dynamical\nfriction and stripping of gas in satellite galaxies. We find that by using the\nFoF group mass at redshift zero in addition to M_infall, an empirical model is\nable to accurately reproduce the clustering properties of galaxies. On the\nother hand, using the infall redshift as a second parameter does not yield as\ngood results because it is less correlated with stellar mass. Our analysis\nindicates that environmental processes are important for modeling the\nclustering and abundance of galaxies. (Abridged) \n\n"}

Motivated by recent numerical models of the Sgr tidal\nstream that predict a substantial amount of rotation in the dwarf remnant core,\nwe compare the kinematic data against N-body models that simulate the stream\nprogenitor as (i) a pressure-supported, mass-follows-light system, and (ii) a\nlate-type, rotating disc galaxy embedded in an extended dark matter halo.

We further show\nthat standard analyses of SDSS-depth images typically miss 20% of the total\nstellar light and underestimate the size of LRGs by 10% compared to our best\nfit r-band Sersic model of n=5.5 and r_e=13.1 kpc. If the excess light at r>100\nkpc is considered to be part of the galaxy, the best fit r-band Sersic\nparameters are n=5.8 and r_e=13.6 kpc. In addition we study the radially\ndependent stack ellipticity and find an increase with radius from e=0.25 at\nr=10 kpc to e=0.3 at r=100 kpc. This provides support that the stellar light\nthat we trace out to at least 100 kpc is physically associated with the\ngalaxies themselves and may confirm that the halos of individual LRGs have\nhigher ellipticities than their central parts. Lastly we show that the\nbroadband color gradients of the stacked images are flat beyond roughly 40 kpc,\nsuggesting that the stellar populations do not vary significantly with radius\nin the outer parts of massive ellipticals. \n\n"}

All the previous studies on the core-accretion\nmodel assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly. In fact,\nthe envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals\nbecause icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via\nstrong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope.

This is confirmed in hydro-AMR\nzoom-in simulations of galaxies in a cosmological context. In most high-z\nclumps, the centrifugal force dominates the support, R=Vrot^2/Vcirc^2 > 0.5,\nwhere Vrot is the rotation velocity and Vcirc is the circular velocity. The\nclump spin indeed tends to be in the sense of the global disc angular momentum,\nbut substantial tilts are frequent. Most clumps are in Jeans equilibrium, with\nthe rest of the support provided by turbulence. Simulations of isolated\ngas-rich discs that resolve the clump substructure reveal that the cosmological\nsimulations may overestimate R by ~30%, but the dominance of rotational support\nat high-z is not a resolution artifact. In turn, isolated gas-poor disc\nsimulations produce at z=0 smaller gaseous non-rotating transient clouds,\nindicating that the difference in rotational support is associated with the\nfraction of cold baryons in the disc.

It also allows\nstraightforward calculations of covariance with the CMB. We find that the\ncorrelation between the ISW and RSD signals are low since the probes are\nsensitive to different modes. For our default surveys, on large scales ($k<0.05\n\\Mpc/h$), the ISW can improve constraints on $f\\sigma_8$ by more than 10%\ncompared to using RSDs alone. In the future, when precision RSD measurements\nare available on smaller scales, the cosmological constraints from ISW\nmeasurements will not be competitive; however, they will remain a useful\nconsistency test for possible systematic contamination and alternative models\nof gravity. \n\n"}

The effect of metallicity, and the distance\n  to the LMC Abstract: The extragalactic distance scale builds directly on the Cepheid\nPeriod-Luminosity (PL) relation as delineated by the sample of Cepheids in the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC). However, the LMC is a dwarf irregular galaxy,\nquite different from the massive spiral galaxies used for calibrating the\nextragalactic distance scale. Recent investigations suggest that not only the\nzero-point but also the slope of the Milky Way PL relation differ significantly\nfrom that of the LMC, casting doubts on the universality of the Cepheid PL\nrelation. We want to make a differential comparison of the PL relations in the\ntwo galaxies by delineating the PL relations using the same method, the\ninfrared surface brightness method (IRSB), and the same precepts. The IRSB\nmethod is a Baade-Wesselink type method to determine individual distances to\nCepheids. We apply a newly revised calibration of the method as described in an\naccompanying paper (Paper I) to 36 LMC and five SMC Cepheids and delineate new\nPL relations in the V,I,J, & K bands as well as in the Wesenheit indices in the\noptical and near-IR. We present 509 new and accurate radial velocity\nmeasurements for a sample of 22 LMC Cepheids, enlarging our earlier sample of\n14 stars to include 36 LMC Cepheids. The new calibration of the IRSB method is\ndirectly tied to the recent HST parallax measurements to ten Milky Way\nCepheids, and we find a LMC barycenter distance modulus of 18.45+-0.04 (random\nerror only) from the 36 individual LMC Cepheid distances.

Comparisons of\nthe systemic redshifts of the host galaxies and the velocity distribution of\nabsorbing clouds revealed in early-time afterglow spectra further show that the\nmajority of the absorbing clouds are redshifted from these compact star-forming\ngalaxies.

To this aim, we integrate\nin time the equations of mass and energy conservation under self-regulated\ninstability of a two-component disc of gas and stars. The disc is assumed to be\ncontinuously fed by cold gas at the average cosmological rate. The gas forms\nstars and is partly driven away by stellar feedback. The gas and stars flow\ninward through the disc to a central bulge due to torques that drive angular\nmomentum outwards. The gravitational energy released by the mass inflow down\nthe gravitational potential gradient drives the disc turbulence that maintains\nthe disc unstable with a Toomre instability parameter Q~1, compensating for the\ndissipative losses of the gas turbulence and raising the stellar velocity\ndispersion. We follow the velocity dispersion of stars and gas as they heat and\ncool respectively and search for disc `stabilization', to be marked by a low\ngas velocity dispersion comparable to the speed of sound ~10 km/s. We vary the\nmodel parameters that characterize the accreted gas fraction, turbulence\ndissipation rate, star-formation rate, and stellar feedback. We find that as\nlong as the gas input roughly follows the average cosmological rate, the disc\ninstability is a robust phenomenon at high redshift till z~1, driven by the\nhigh surface density and high gas fraction due to the intense cosmological\naccretion. For a broad range of model parameter values, the discs tend to\n`stabilize' at z~0-0.5 as they become dominated by hot stars. When the model\nparameters are pushed to extreme values, the discs may stabilize as early as\nz~2, with the gas loss by strong outflows serving as the dominant stabilizing\nfactor. \n\n"}

A key to the\nsuccess of the simulations is a significant contribution to the spheroid from\nstars that formed in situ. While the outer halo is dominated by accreted stars,\nstars formed in the main progenitor of the galaxy dominate at r < ~30 kpc. In\nthe present study we show that this component was primarily formed in a\nproto-disc at high redshift and was subsequently liberated from the disc by\ndynamical heating associated with mass accretion. As a consequence of its\norigin, the in situ component of the spheroid has different kinematics (namely\nnet prograde rotation with respect to the disc) than that of the spheroid\ncomponent built from the disruption of satellites. In addition, the in situ\ncomponent has a flattened distribution, that is due in part to its rotation.

We measure a\ndensity profile that is slightly but not significantly shallower than\nisothermal at R_E. We decompose the mass of the lensing galaxy into a de\nVaucouleurs (deV) component to trace the stars and an additional dark\ncomponent. The spread of multiple image components over a large radial range\nalso allows us to determine the amplitude of the deV and dark matter components\nseparately. We get a mass to light ratio of M_deV/L_B~5.5\\pm1.5M/L_sun,B and a\ndark matter fraction within R_E of ~20 to 40%. Modelling the star formation\nhistory assuming composite stellar populations at solar metallicity to the\ngalaxy's photometry yields a mass to light ratio of\nM_star,salp/L_B~4.0_{-1.3}^{+0.6}M/L_sun,B and\nM_star,chab/L_B~2.3_{-0.8}^{+0.3}M/L_sun,B for Salpeter and Chabrier IMFs,\nrespectively. Hence, the mass to light ratio derived from lensing is more\nSalpeter-like, in agreement with results for massive Coma galaxies and other\nnearby massive early type galaxies. We examine the consequences of the galaxy\ngroup in which the lensing galaxy is embedded, showing that it has little\ninfluence on the mass to light ratio obtained for the deV component of the\nlensing galaxy. Finally, we decompose the projected, azimuthally averaged 2D\ndensity distribution of the deV and dark matter component of the lensing signal\ninto spherically averaged 3D density profiles. We can show that the 3D dark and\nluminous matter density within R_E~0.6R_eff of this SLACS galaxy is similar to\nthe values of Coma galaxies with the same velocity dispersions. \n\n"}

The sample\nincludes galaxies both on and above the main sequence (MS) traced by\nstar-forming galaxies in the SFR-M* plane. The far-infrared data are used to\nderive dust masses, Mdust. Combined with an empirical prescription for the\ndependence of the gas-to-dust ratio on metallicity (GDR), the CO luminosities\nand Mdust values are used to derive for each galaxy the CO-to-H2 conversion\nfactor, alpha_co. Like in the local Universe, the value of alpha_co is a factor\nof ~5 smaller in starbursts compared to normal star-forming galaxies (SFGs). We\nalso uncover a relation between alpha_co and dust temperature (Tdust; alpha_co\ndecreasing with increasing Tdust) as obtained from modified blackbody fits to\nthe far-infrared data. While the absolute normalization of the alpha_co(Tdust)\nrelation is uncertain, the global trend is robust against possible systematic\nbiases in the determination of Mdust, GDR or metallicity. Although we cannot\nformally distinguish between a step and a smooth evolution of alpha_co with the\ndust temperature, we can conclude that in galaxies of near-solar metallicity, a\ncritical value of Tdust=30K can be used to determine whether the appropriate\nalpha_co is closer to the starburst value (1.0 Msun(K kms pc^2)^-1, if\nTdust>30K) or closer to the Galactic value (4.35 Msun (K kms pc^2)^-1, if\nTdust<30K).

Abstract: Using collisionless N-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky\nWay (MW) we construct realistic models of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies of\nthe Local Group. The dwarfs are initially composed of stellar disks embedded in\ndark matter haloes with different inner density slopes and are placed on an\neccentric orbit typical for MW subhaloes. After a few Gyr of evolution the\nstellar component is triaxial as a result of bar instability induced by tidal\nforces. Observing the simulated dwarfs along three principal axes of the\nstellar component we create mock data sets and determine the their half-light\nradii and line-of-sight velocity dispersions. Using the estimator proposed by\nWolf et al. we calculate masses within half-light radii. The masses obtained\nthis way are over(under)estimated by up to a factor of two when the line of\nsight is along the longest (shortest) axis of the stellar component. We then\ndivide the initial stellar distribution into an inner and outer population and\ntrace their evolution in time. The two populations, although affected by tidal\nforces, retain different density profiles even after a few Gyr. We measure the\nhalf-light radii and velocity dispersions of the stars in the two populations\nalong different lines of sight and use them to estimate the slope of the mass\ndistribution in the dwarfs following the method proposed by Walker &\nPenarrubia. The inferred slopes are systematically over- or underestimated,\ndepending on the line of sight. In particular, when the dwarf is seen along the\nlongest axis of the stellar component, a significantly shallower density\nprofile is inferred than the real one measured from the simulations. Since most\ndSphs are non-spherical and their orientation with respect to our line of sight\nis unknown, the method can be reliably applied only to a large sample of dwarfs\nwhen these systematic errors are expected to be diminished. \n\n"}

These binaries are expected to precess. Gravitational wave science\nrequires a tractable model for precessing binaries, to disentangle precession\nphysics from other phenomena like modified strong field gravity, tidal\ndeformability, or Hubble flow; and to measure compact object masses, spins, and\nalignments. Moreover, current searches for gravitational waves from compact\nbinaries use templates where the binary does not precess and are ill-suited for\ndetection of generic precessing sources. In this paper we provide a closed-form\nrepresentation of the single-spin precessing waveform in the frequency domain\nby reorganizing the signal as a sum over harmonics, each of which resembles a\nnonprecessing waveform.

Such an approach has recently been developed for the case when\ndark energy is vacuum energy, which does not cluster at all. We extend this\nrelativistic analysis to deal with dynamical dark energy. Using three\nquintessence potentials as examples, we compute the angular power spectrum for\nthe case of an HI intensity map survey. Compared to the concordance model with\nthe same small-scale power at z=0, quintessence boosts the angular power by up\nto ~15% at high redshifts, while power in the two models converges at low\nredshifts. The difference is mainly due to the background evolution, driven\nmostly by the normalization of the power spectrum today. The dark energy\nperturbations make only a small contribution on the largest scales, and a\nnegligible contribution on smaller scales. Ironically, the dark energy\nperturbations remove the false boost of large-scale power that arises if we\nimpose the (unphysical) assumption that the dark energy is smooth. \n\n"}

These differences can best be explained\nif the onset of high eccentricity planet migration is also a time when planet\nare sent into merge with the star. Planet migration into the star is likely a\ncomplementary explanation to the view that systems with higher initial iron\nabundance form more planets, and that more crowded planets are more likely to\nscatter into eccentric orbits. Planets of iron-rich single stars have\neccentricity distributions that are higher than planets of iron-poor single\nstars (where \"rich\" and \"poor\" are stars whose [Fe/H] is above and below solar,\nrespectively).

An emphasis is placed upon the\ntemporal history of chemical enrichment during its passage through the corona\nand CGM. We derive the distributions of time between gas crossing the virial\nradius and being accreted to the star forming region (which allows mixing\nwithin the corona), as well as the time between gas being accreted to the star\nforming region and then forming stars (which allows mixing within the disc).\nSignificant numbers of stars are formed from gas that cycles back through the\nhot halo after first accreting to the star forming region. Gas entering high\nmass galaxies is pre-enriched in low mass proto-galaxies prior to entering the\nvirial radius of the central progenitor, with only small amounts of primordial\ngas accreted, even at high redshift (z~5). After entering the virial radius,\nsignificant further enrichment occurs prior to the accretion of the gas to the\nstar forming region, with gas that is feeding the star forming region\nsurpassing 0.1Z by z=0.

In particular, an hybrid solution in which the\nstructure of galaxies and their stellar population are the main contributors to\nthe FP tilt seems to be favoured. We find that the bulk of the tilt should be\nattributed to structural non-homology, while stellar population effects play an\nimportant but less crucial role. Our data indicate that the differential FP\ntilt between the V and K-band is due to a sort of entanglement between\nstructural and stellar population effects, for which the inward steepening of\ncolor profiles (V-K) tends to increase at increasing the stellar mass of ETGs.\nThe same analysis applied to the ATLAS3D and SDSS data in common with WINGS\n(WSDSS throughout the paper) confirms our results, the only remarkable\ndifference being the less important role of the stellar mass-to-light-ratio in\ndetermining the FP tilt. The ATLAS3D data also suggest that the tilt depends as\nwell on the dark matter (DM) fraction and on the rotational contribution to the\nkinetic energy (Vrot/sigma).

First, we explore the effects of several physical\nprocesses which influence the formation and evolution of abundance gradients.\nThey are: i) the inside-out formation of the disk, ii) a threshold in the gas\ndensity for star formation, iii) a variable star formation efficiency along the\ndisk, iv) radial flows and their speed, and v) different total surface mass\ndensity (gas plus stars) distributions for the halo. We are able to reproduce\nat best the present day gradients of oxygen and iron if we assume an inside-out\nformation, no threshold gas density, a constant efficiency of star formation\nalong the disk and radial gas flows. It is particularly important the choice of\nthe velocity pattern for radial flows and the combination of this velocity\npattern with the surface mass density distribution in the halo.

Cases for both\nopen and closed boundary conditions are investigated, where magnetic flux and\nparticles are lost and conserved respectively. It is found that reconnection\nrates and out-of-plane currents in the $X$-point increase more rapidly and peak\nsooner in the closed boundary case, but higher values are reached in the open\nboundary case. The normalized reconnection rate is fast: 0.10-0.25. In the open\nboundary case an increase of guide-field yields later onsets in the\nreconnection peak rates, while in the closed boundary case initial peak rates\noccur sooner but are suppressed. The reconnection current increases for low\nguide-fields but then decreases similarly.

Possible causes of the vortex generation, based on\nthe flow of particles in the diffusion region and localized plasma heating, are\ndiscussed.

The slope of the H2-def vs.\nHI-def relation is less than 1, while the D(HI)/D(i) vs. HI-def relation is\nsteeper than the D(CO)/D(i) vs. HI-def relation, thereby indicating that the H2\ngas is removed less efficiently than the HI.

Our\ndata support the general concept of an alpha-enhanced plateau at early epochs,\nfollowed by a well-defined \"knee\", caused by the onset of SNe Ia, and finally a\nsecond plateau with sub-solar [alpha/Fe] values. We find the position of this\nknee to be at [Fe/H]=-1.9 and therefore significantly more metal-poor than\nexpected from comparison with other dSphs and standard evolutionary models.\nSurprisingly, this value is rather comparable to the knee in Sculptor, a dSph\nabout 10 times less luminous than Fornax. Using chemical evolution models, we\nfind that both the position of the knee as well as the subsequent plateau at\nsub-solar level can hardly be explained unless the galaxy experienced several\ndiscrete star formation events with a drastic variation in star formation\nefficiency, while a uniform star formation can be ruled out. One possible\nevolutionary scenario is that Fornax experienced one or several major accretion\nevents from gas-rich systems in the past, so that its current stellar mass is\nnot indicative of the chemical evolution environment at ancient times. If\nFornax is the product of several smaller building blocks, this may also have\nimplications of the understanding on the formation process of dSphs in general. \n\n"}

Therefore, conformity manifestly\nviolates the widely adopted assumption that the dark matter halo mass Mvir\nexclusively governs galaxy occupation statistics. This paper is the first in a\nseries studying the implications of the observed conformity signal for the\ngalaxy-dark matter connection. We show that recent measurements of conformity\non scales R ~1-5 Mpc imply that central galaxy quenching statistics cannot be\ncorrectly predicted with the knowledge of Mvir alone. We also demonstrate that\nejected (or `backsplash') satellites cannot give rise to the signal. We then\ninvoke the age matching model, which is predicated on the co-evolution of\ngalaxies and halos. We find that this model produces a strong signal, and that\ncentral galaxies are solely responsible.

Some stripped galaxies, in particular in merging\nclusters, develop spectacular star-forming tails, giving them a jellyfish-like\nappearance. In merging clusters, merger shocks in the intra-cluster medium\n(ICM) are thought to have overrun these galaxies, enhancing the ambient ICM\npressure and thus triggering SF, gas stripping and tail formation. We present\nidealised hydrodynamical simulations of this scenario, including standard\ndescriptions for SF and stellar feedback.

In fact, gas easily crosses the gap on\nhorseshoe orbits, nullifying this necessary premise which would set the\nmigration rate.

The unique\nband of the AKARI IRC spectroscopy enables us to access both the 3.3 um\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission feature from star forming\nactivity and the continuum of torus-dust emission heated by an active galactic\nnucleus (AGN). Applying our AGN diagnostics to the AKARI spectra, we discover\n14 buried AGNs. The large fraction of buried AGNs suggests that AGN activity\nbehind the dust is almost ubiquitous in ultra-/luminous infrared galaxies\n(U/LIRGs). We also find that both the fraction and energy contribution of\nburied AGNs increase with infrared luminosity from 10 < log(L_IR / Lsun) < 13,\nincluding normal infrared galaxies with log (L_IR / Lsun) < 11. The energy\ncontribution from AGNs in the total infrared luminosity is only ~7% in LIRGs\nand ~20% in ULIRGs, suggesting that the majority of the infrared luminosity\noriginates from starburst activity. Using the PAH emission, we investigate the\nluminosity relation between star formation and AGN. We find that these infrared\ngalaxies exhibit higher star formation rates than optically selected Seyfert\ngalaxies with the same AGN luminosities, implying that infrared galaxies could\nbe an early evolutionary phase of AGN. \n\n"}

Eight radio source\nsamples are combined to produce a catalogue of 211 radio-loud AGN with\n0.5<z<1.0, which are spectroscopically classified into jet-mode and\nradiative-mode (radiatively-efficient) AGN classes. Comparing with large\nsamples of local radio-AGN from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the cosmic\nevolution of the radio luminosity function of each radio-AGN class is\nindependently derived. Radiative-mode radio-AGN show an order of magnitude\nincrease in space density out to z~1 at all luminosities, consistent with these\nAGN being fuelled by cold gas. In contrast, the space density of jet-mode\nradio-AGN decreases with increasing redshift at low radio luminosities (L_1.4 <\n1e24 W/Hz) but increases at higher radio luminosities. Simple models are\ndeveloped to explain the observed evolution. In the best-fitting models, the\ncharacteristic space density of jet-mode AGN declines with redshift in\naccordance with the declining space density of massive quiescent galaxies,\nwhich fuel them via cooling of gas in their hot haloes. A time delay of 1.5-2\nGyr may be present between the quenching of star formation and the onset of\njet-mode radio-AGN activity. The behaviour at higher radio luminosities can be\nexplained either by an increasing characteristic luminosity of jet-mode\nradio-AGN activity with redshift (roughly as (1+z) cubed) or if the jet-mode\nradio-AGN population also includes some contribution of cold-gas-fuelled\nsources seen at a time when their accretion rate was low.

Compared to an ideal gas polytrope, the inclusion of molecular\nhydrogen (H_2) dissociation and variable occupation of H_2 rotational states\nincreases M_crit. Specifically, M_crit increases by a factor of ~2 if the H_2\nspin isomers, ortho- and parahydrogen, are in thermal equilibrium, and by a\nfactor of ~2-4 if the ortho-to-para ratio is fixed at 3:1. Lower opacities due\nto grain growth reduce M_crit. For a standard disk model around a Solar mass\nstar, we calculate M_crit ~ 8 M_Earth at 5 AU, decreasing to ~5 M_Earth at 100\nAU, for a realistic EOS with an equilibrium ortho-to-para ratio and for grain\ngrowth to cm-sizes. If grain coagulation is taken into account, M_crit may\nfurther reduce by up to one order of magnitude. These results for the minimum\ncritical core mass are useful for the interpretation of surveys that find\nexoplanets at a range of orbital distances. \n\n"}

METHODS: Using high-resolution spectra obtained with MIKE, FEROS,\nSOFIN, FIES, UVES and HARPS spectrographs, we determine Sc, V, Mn, and Co\nabundances for a large sample of F and G dwarfs in Solar neighbourhood. The\nmethod is based on spectral synthesis and using one-dimensional (1-D),\nplane-parallel, LTE model stellar atmospheres calculated with the MARCS 2012\ncode. NLTE corrections from literature were applied to Mn and Co. RESULTS: We\nfind that the abundance trends derived for Sc (594 stars), V (466 stars), and\nCo (567 stars) are very similar to what has been observed for the\nalpha-elements in the thin and thick disks. On the contrary Mn (569 stars) is\ngenerally underabundant relative to the Sun (i.e. [Mn/Fe]<0) for [Fe/H]<0.\nAlso, for Mn, when NLTE corrections are applied, the trend changes and is\nalmost flat over the entire metallicity range that the stars in our sample span\n(-2<[Fe/H]<+0.4). The [Sc/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance trends show a small separation\nbetween the thin and thick disks, while for V and Co they completely overlap.\nFor Mn there is a small difference in [Mn/Fe] but only when NLTE corrections\nare used. Comparisons with Ti as a reference element show flat trends for all\nthe elements except for Mn that show well separated [Mn/Ti]-[Ti/H] trends for\nthe thin and thick disks.

These effects relate to\nthe enhancement or depletion, respectively, in coronal abundance with respect\nto photospheric values of elements with FIP below about 10~eV. They are\ninterpreted in terms of the ponderomotive force due to the propagation and/or\nreflection of magnetohydrodynamic waves in the chromosphere. This acts on\nchromospheric ions, but not neutrals, and so can lead to ion-neutral\nfractionation.\n  A detailed description of the model applied to closed magnetic loops, and to\nopen field regions is given, accounting for the observed difference in solar\nFIP fractionation between the slow and fast wind. It is shown that such a model\ncan also account for the observed depletion of helium in the solar wind.

We compare clouds formed in a high\nresolution galaxy simulation identified as continuous structures within a\ncontour, in the simulator's position-position-position (PPP) co-ordinate space\nand the observer's position-position-velocity space (PPV). Results indicate\nthat the properties of the cloud populations are similar in both methods and up\nto 70% of clouds have a single counterpart in the opposite data structure.\nComparing individual clouds in a one-to-one match reveals a scatter in\nproperties mostly within a factor of two. However, the small variations in\nmass, radius and velocity dispersion produce significant differences in derived\nquantities such as the virial parameter. This makes it difficult to determine\nif a structure is truely gravitationally bound. The three cloud types\noriginally found in the simulation in Fujimoto et al.

However, the more crowded environment lowered the ability to\nmatch clouds between techniques to 40%. The three cloud types also became\nharder to separate, especially in the PPV data set. The method used for cloud\nidentification therefore plays a critical role in determining cloud properties,\nbut both PPP and PPV can potentially identify the same structures. \n\n"}

We identify the combination of mass, projected\noffset, and redshift that determines the importance of a perturbing galaxy for\nlensing. Foreground structures have a stronger effect on the lens potential\nthan background structures, due to nonlinear effects in the foreground and\ndownweighting in the background. There is dramatic variation in the net\nstrength of ENV/LOS effects across different lens fields; modeling fields\nindividually yields stronger priors for $H_0$ than ray tracing through $N$-body\nsimulations.

Our results show that PNG\nhave an impact on cluster scalings laws. The mass power-law indexes of the\nscalings are almost unaffected by the existence of PNG but the amplitude and\nredshift evolution of their normalizations are clearly affected. The effect is\nstronger for the evolution of the Y-M and Yx-M normalizations, which change by\nas much as 22% and 16% when $f_{NL}$ varies from -500 to 500, respectively.\nThese results are consistent with the view that positive/negative $f_{NL}$\naffect cluster profiles due to an increase/decrease of cluster concentrations.\nAt low values of $f_{NL}$, as suggested by present Planck constraints on a\nscale invariant $f_{NL}$, the impact on the scalings normalizations is only a\nfew percent, which is small when compared with the effect of additional gas\nphysics and other cosmological effects such as dark energy. However if $f_{NL}$\nis in fact a scale dependent parameter, PNG may have larger positive/negative\namplitudes at clusters scales and therefore our results suggest that PNG should\nbe taken into account when galaxy cluster data is used to infer cosmological\nparameters or to asses the constraining power of future cluster surveys. \n\n"}

Recent galaxy formation simulations\nhave demonstrated the need for active CR transport either in the form of\ndiffusion or streaming to successfully launch winds in galaxies. However, due\nto computational limitations, most previous simulations have modeled CR\ntransport isotropically. Here, we discuss high resolution simulations of\nisolated disk galaxies in a $10^{11}\\rm{M_\\odot}$ halo with the moving mesh\ncode {\\sc Arepo} that include injection of CRs from supernovae, advective\ntransport, CR cooling, and CR transport through isotropic or anisotropic\ndiffusion. We show that either mode of diffusion leads to the formation of\nstrong bipolar outflows. However, they develop significantly later in the\nsimulation with anisotropic diffusion compared to the simulation with isotropic\ndiffusion. Moreover, we find that isotropic diffusion allows most of the CRs to\nquickly diffuse out of the disk, while in the simulation with anisotropic\ndiffusion, most CRs remain in the disk once the magnetic field becomes\ndominated by its azimuthal component, which occurs after $\\sim 300\\,{\\rm\nMyrs}$. This has important consequences for the gas dynamics in the disk. In\nparticular, we show that isotropic diffusion strongly suppresses the\namplification of the magnetic field in the disk compared to anisotropic or no\ndiffusion models. We therefore conclude that reliable simulations which include\nCR transport inevitably need to account for anisotropic diffusion. \n\n"}

We oppose this opinion\nand show that two main factors are responsible for the extremely low intensity\nof the observed stellar EBL: (1) a low mean surface brightness of galaxies,\nwhich causes a low luminosity density in the local Universe, and (2) light\nextinction due to absorption by galactic and intergalactic dust. Dust produces\na partial opacity of galaxies and of the Universe. The galactic opacity reduces\nthe intensity of light from more distant background galaxies obscured by\nforeground galaxies. The effective extinction AV for light passing through a\ngalaxy is 0.2 mag. This causes that distant background galaxies do not\ncontribute to the EBL significantly. In addition, light of distant galaxies is\ndimmed due to absorption by intergalactic dust. Even a minute intergalactic\nopacity of 1x10^(-2) mag per Gpc is high enough to produce significant effects\non the EBL. The absorbed starlight heats up the galactic and intergalactic dust\nand is further re-radiated at the IR, FIR and micro-wave spectrum.

However, if dust is\nconsidered, the predicted stellar EBL is about 290 nWm^(-2)sr^(-1), which is\nonly 5 times higher than the observed value. Hence, the presence of dust has\nhigher impact on the EBL than currently assumed. In the expanding universe, the\ncalculated value of the EBL is further decreased, because the obscuration\neffect and intergalactic absorption become more pronounced at high redshifts\nwhen the matter was concentrated at smaller volume than at present. \n\n"}

First, we study a\nsuperthin, LSB galaxy UGC 7321 and show that it does not support discrete\nglobal spiral modes when modeled as a disk-alone system or as a disk plus dark\nmatter system. Even a moderate increase in the stellar central surface density\ndoes not yield any global spiral modes. This naturally explains the observed\nlack of strong large-scale spiral structure in LSBs.

We\nfound that this difference arises due to the different dispersion relation used\nin the two cases and which plays a crucial role in the search for global spiral\nmodes. Thus the correct treatment of stars as a collisionless system as done\nhere results in the suppression of global spiral modes, in agreement with the\nobservations.

We\nexamine a MW-mass halo at the present epoch whose evolution is characterized by\nseveral major mergers to isolate the importance of merger history on black hole\naccretion.

Abstract: Blazars are active galactic nuclei (AGN) whose relativistic jets point nearly\nto the line of sight. Their compact radio structure can be imaged with very\nlong baseline interferometry (VLBI) on parsec scales. Blazars at extremely high\nredshifts provide a unique insight into the AGN phenomena in the early\nUniverse. We observed four radio sources at redshift $z>4$ with the European\nVLBI Network (EVN) at 1.7 and 5 GHz. These objects were previously classified\nas blazar candidates based on X-ray observations. One of them, J2134$-$0419 is\nfirmly confirmed as a blazar with our VLBI observations, due to its\nrelativistically beamed radio emission. Its radio jet extended to $\\sim$10\nmilli-arcsec scale makes this source a promising target for follow-up VLBI\nobservations to reveal any apparent proper motion. Another target, J0839+5112\nshows a compact radio structure typical of quasars. There is evidence for flux\ndensity variability and its radio \"core\" has a flat spectrum. However, the EVN\ndata suggest that its emission is not Doppler-boosted. The remaining two blazar\ncandidates (J1420+1205 and J2220+0025) show radio properties totally unexpected\nfrom radio AGN with small-inclination jet. Their emission extends to arcsec\nscales and the Doppler factors of the central components are well below 1.\nTheir structures resemble that of double-lobed radio AGN with large inclination\nto the line of sight. This is in contrast with the blazar-type modeling of\ntheir multi-band spectral energy distributions. Our work underlines the\nimportance of high-resolution VLBI imaging in confirming the blazar nature of\nhigh-redshift radio sources. \n\n"}

Recent simulations predict that a\nBrightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) inside a cored galaxy cluster will exhibit\nresidual wobbling due to previous major mergers, long after the relaxation of\nthe overall cluster. This phenomenon is absent with standard cold dark matter\nwhere a cuspy density profile keeps a BCG tightly bound at the centre. We test\nthis hypothesis using cosmological simulations and deep observations of 10\ngalaxy clusters acting as strong gravitational lenses. Modelling the BCG wobble\nas a simple harmonic oscillator, we measure the wobble amplitude, $A_w$, in the\nBAHAMAS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, finding an upper\nlimit for the CDM paradigm of $A_w < 2$kpc at the 95% confidence limit.

While our small sample of galaxy clusters already\nindicates a non-zero $A_w$, with larger surveys, e.g. Euclid, we will be able\nto not only to confirm the effect but also to use it to determine whether or\nnot the wobbling finds its origin in new fundamental physics or astrophysical\nprocess. \n\n"}

A hybrid MPI/OpenMP execution model is adopted, where work tasks\nare controlled by a rank-local `dispatcher' which selects, from a set of tasks\ngenerally much larger than the number of physical cores (or hardware threads),\ntasks that are ready for updating. The definition of a task can vary, for\nexample, with some solving the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD),\nothers non-ideal MHD, radiative transfer, or particle motion, and yet others\napplying particle-in-cell (PIC) methods. Tasks do not have to be grid-based,\nwhile tasks that are, may use either Cartesian or orthogonal curvilinear\nmeshes. Patches may be stationary or moving. Mesh refinement can be static or\ndynamic.

Destruction of GCs by tidal stripping and\ndynamical friction destroy clusters over too small a range of galactocentric\nradii. We show that cluster destruction by tidal shocks from giant molecular\nclouds in the high-density formation environments of GCs becomes increasingly\nefficient towards high galaxy masses and, hence, towards high metallicities.\nThe predicted cluster-to-star ratio decreases by a factor 100-1000 towards high\nmetallicities and should only weakly depend on galactocentric radius due to\norbital mixing during hierarchical galaxy merging, consistent with the\nobservations. The observed, strong dependence of the cluster-to-star ratio on\nmetallicity and the independence of its slope on galactocentric radius can be\nexplained by cluster destruction and hierarchical galaxy growth. As a result,\nwe find that the metallicity-dependence of the cluster-to-star ratio does not\nreflect a GC formation efficiency, but a survival fraction. (Abridged) \n\n"}

The basic idea is that primary\nparticles are accelerated in astrophysical sources, such as supernova remnant\nshocks and eventually propagate in the Galactic volume, occasionally\ninteracting with gas, mainly in the disc of the Galaxy, and there they produce\nsecondary nuclei through spallation. At sufficiently high energy, typically\n$\\gtrsim 100$ GeV/n, the ratio of fluxes of the secondary nucleus to that of\nthe main primary nucleus is found to scale as $E_{k}^{-\\delta}$, where $E_{k}$\nis the energy per nucleon (a conserved quantity in spallation reactions) and\n$\\delta$ identifies the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient. The\nsame shock waves that may be responsible for cosmic ray acceleration in the\nfirst place also pick up any other charged particle in the upstream, provided\nbeing above threshold for injection. The secondary nuclei produced by\nspallation in the interstellar medium are no exception, hence they also get\naccelerated. This effect is unavoidable, only its strength may be subject of\ndebate.

In particular, the accretion shock region, where the accreting\nmaterial is heated to temperatures of a few MK as it continues its inward bulk\nmotion, can be probed by X-ray spectroscopy. To attempt to detect for the first\ntime the motion of this X-ray-emitting post-shock material, we searched for a\nDoppler shift in the deep Chandra/HETGS observation of the CTTS TW Hya. This\ntest should unveil the nature of this X-ray emitting plasma component in CTTS,\nand constrain the accretion stream geometry. We searched for a Doppler shift in\nthe X-ray emission from TW Hya with two different methods, by measuring the\nposition of a selected sample of emission lines, and by fitting the whole TW\nHya X-ray spectrum, allowing the line-of-sight velocity to vary.

After gas disk dissipation, fully\nformed planets could interact with nearby planetesimals from a remnant\nplanetesimal disk. These interactions would often lead to planetesimal\naccretion due to the relatively high ratio between the planet size and the hill\nradius for typical planets. We present calculations using the open-source\nstellar evolution toolkit MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar\nAstrophysics) modified to include the deposition of planetesimals into the H/He\nenvelopes of sub-Neptunes (~1-20 MEarth). We show that planetesimal accretion\ncan alter the mass-radius isochrones for these planets. The same initial planet\nas a result of the same total accreted planetesimal mass can have up to ~5%\ndifference in mean densities several Gyr after the last accretion due to\ninherent stochasticity of the accretion process. During the phase of rapid\naccretion these differences are more dramatic.

Separately, wave\nturbulence usually produces a direct energy cascade, while solenoidal planar\nturbulence transports energy to large scales by an inverse cascade. Here, we\nconsider turbulence at finite Mach numbers when the interaction between\nacoustic waves and vortices is substantial. We employ solenoidal pumping at\nintermediate scales and show how both direct and inverse energy cascades are\nformed starting from the pumping scale. We show that there is an inverse\ncascade of kinetic energy up to a scale $\\ell$, where a typical velocity\nreaches the speed of sound; this creates shock waves, which provide for a\ncompensating direct cascade. When the system size is less than $\\ell$, the\nsteady state contains a system-size pair of long-living condensate vortices\nconnected by a system of shocks. Thus turbulence in fluid layers processes\nenergy via a loop: Most energy first goes to large scales via vortices and is\nthen transported by waves to small-scale dissipation. \n\n"}

Contemporaneous data from Chandra, HST, and Swift\nare used to model the optical-UV-X-ray continuum and determine the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) at two epochs, 13 years apart.

The HETGS\nspectroscopy shows that the AGN wind in NGC 7469 consists of four ionisation\ncomponents, with their outflow velocities ranging from -400 to -1800 km/s. From\nour modelling we find that the change in the ionising continuum shape between\nthe two epochs results in some variation in the ionisation state of the wind\ncomponents.

This paper investigates the evolution\nof such discs if they are very massive, as may be the case if their progenitor\nwas a terrestrial planet, moon, or dwarf planet. Assuming the discs are\nphysically thin and flat, like Saturn's rings, their evolution is governed by\nPoynting-Robertson drag or viscous spreading, where the disc's effective\nviscosity is due to self-gravity wakes. For discs with masses >10^26 g, located\nin the outer parts of the tidal disruption zone, viscous spreading dominates\nthe evolution, and mass is transported both in- and outwards. When\noutwards-spreading material flows beyond the Roche limit, it coagulates into\nnew (minor) planets in a process analogous to the ongoing formation of moonlets\nat the outer edge of Saturn's rings. The newly formed bodies migrate outwards\nby exchanging angular momentum with the disc and coalesce into larger objects\nthrough mutual collisions. Eventually, the disc's Roche-limit overflow recycles\ntens of percent of the original disc mass; most ends up in a single large body\nnear 2:1 mean-motion resonance with the disc's outer edge. Hence, the recycling\nof a tidally disrupted super-Earth, for example, could yield an Earth-mass\nplanet on a ~10-h orbit, located in the habitable zone for 2-to-10-Gyr-old\nwhite dwarfs. The recycling process also creates a population of smaller bodies\njust outside the Roche limit, which may explain the minor planets recently\npostulated to orbit WD 1145+017. \n\n"}

A\nparameter which is common to and plays a key role in both the GW and the EM\nanalyses is the viewing angle of the binary's orbit. If a binary is viewed from\ndifferent angles, the amount of GW energy changes (implying that orientation\nand distance are correlated) and the EM signatures can vary, depending on the\nstructure of the emission. Information about the viewing angle of the binary\norbital plane is therefore crucial to the interpretation of both the GW and the\nEM data, and can potentially be extracted from either side.\n  In the first part of this study, we present a systematic analysis of how well\nthe viewing angle of binary neutron stars can be measured from the GW data. We\nshow that if the sky position and the redshift of the binary can be identified\nvia the EM counterpart and an associated host galaxy, then for 50$\\%$ of the\nsystems the viewing angle can be constrained to $\\leq 7^{\\circ}$ uncertainty\nfrom the GW data, independent of electromagnetic emission models.

We use simulations to deduce the lengths that we should\ntrim from the capacitor fingers in order to shift the resonances to the desired\nfrequencies.

We\nuse stellar kinematics and HI gas rotation curves to infer the inner dark\nmatter densities of eight dwarf spheroidal and eight dwarf irregular galaxies\nwith a wide range of star formation histories.

Here we\nperform N-body simulations of the moons' orbital evolution from various initial\nconditions -- assuming that the moons were formed from Saturn's hypothetical\nmassive ring -- and investigate possible paths to solve the above difficulties.\nIf the influence of the rings is neglected, we find that the Tethys-Dione pair\ncannot avoid becoming trapped in the mean-motion resonances as they recede from\nSaturn, and that the Tethys-Enceladus pair cannot avoid collisions after the\nresonance trapping, in case Saturn's quality factor is smaller than 15,000.\nThese findings are inconsistent with the current orbital configuration.\nHowever, taking into account both the eccentricity excitation and the orbital\nexpansion caused by the ring torque, we find that these resonance captures are\navoided. With the high eccentricity pumped up by the torque, Enceladus passes\nthrough the resonances with Tethys, and the Dione-Tethys pair passes through\ntheir 2:1 and possibly the 3:2 resonance as well. After Enceladus resides\nbeyond the 2:1 resonance with the outer ring edge, the eccentricity can be\ntidally damped. While this is a promising path of evolution, in most runs,\nEnceladus collides with Tethys by the excited eccentricity. There is a hint\nthat a ring mass decrease could avoid the collision. The tidal heat due to the\neccentricity excitation by the ring torque is stored in the moons and slowly\nradiated away. It may account for the current high heat flow. \n\n"}

After selecting all the quiescent\ngalaxies from the ALHAMBRA survey by the dust-corrected stellar mass$-$colour\ndiagram, we built a shared sample of $\\sim850$ quiescent galaxies with reliable\nsizes from the HST. The stellar population properties were retrieved using the\nSED-fitting code MUFFIT with various sets of composite stellar population\nmodels. Age, formation epoch, metallicity, and extinction were studied on the\nstellar mass$-$size plane as function of size through a Monte Carlo approach.\nThis accounted for uncertainties and degeneracy effects amongst stellar\npopulation properties. The stellar population properties of quiescent galaxies\nand their stellar mass and size since $z\\sim1$ are correlated. At fixed stellar\nmass, the more compact the quiescent galaxy, the older and richer in metals it\nis ($1$Gyr and $0.1$dex, respectively). In addition, more compact galaxies may\npresent slight lower extinctions than their more extended counterparts at the\nsame stellar mass ($<0.1$ mag). By means of studying constant regions of\nstellar population properties across the stellar mass$-$size plane, we obtained\nempirical relations to constrain the physical mechanism that governs the\nstellar mass assembly of the form $M_\\star \\propto r_\\mathrm{c}^\\alpha$, where\n$\\alpha$ amounts to $0.50-0.55 \\pm 0.09$.

We found that most of these properties and correlations are the\nresult of three (cosmological) initial factors and their dispersions: the\nvirial mass, the halo mass aggregation history (MAH), and the angular momentum\ngiven through the spin parameter \\lambda. The MAH determines mainly the halo\nstructure and the color indexes while \\lambda determines mainly the surface\nbrightness and the bulge-to-disk ratio. We calculated star formation (SF) using\na gravitational instability criterion and a self-regulation mechanism in the\nturbulent ISM. The efficiency of SF in this model is almost independent from\nthe mass. We show that the luminosity-dependent dust absorption empirically\ndetermined by Wang & Heckman explains the observed color-magnitude and color\nTully-Fisher (TF) relations without the necessity of introducing a\nmass-dependent SF efficiency. The disks in centrifugal equilibrium form within\ngrowing CDM halos with a gas accretion rate proportional to the MAH. The disks\npresent exponential surface density and brightness profiles, negative radial\ncolor index gradients, and nearly flat rotation curves.

Our recently proposed\nanalytic halo model for N-point correlation functions now provides a tool for\ncalculating gravitational clustering properties in the strongly nonlinear\nregime. This model also provides a new physical framework for an independent\nevaluation of the validity of the stable clustering hypothesis. We derive the\nasymptotic nonlinear behavior of the N-point correlation functions and pairwise\npeculiar velocities in terms of dark matter halo properties. We show that these\nstatistics exhibit stable clustering only when the halo mass function and halo\ndensity profile obey specific relations.

This model predicts that sub-mm luminosity peaks\nafter only ~ 0.2 Gyr. However, without a very massive seed black hole,\nEddington-limited growth means that a black hole mass of 10^9 solar masses, and\nhence very luminous AGN activity, cannot be produced until > 0.5 Gyr after the\nformation of the first massive stars in the halo. The model thus predicts a\ntime-lag between the peak of sub-mm luminosity and AGN luminosity in a massive\nproto-elliptical of a few times 10^8 years. For a formation redshift z = 5,\nthis means that powerful AGN activity is delayed until z = 3.5, by which time\nstar formation in the host is 90% complete, and sub-mm luminosity has declined\nto ~ 25% of its peak value. This provides a natural explanation for why\nsuccessful sub-mm detections of luminous radio galaxies are largely confined to\nz > 2.5. Conversely the model also predicts that while all high-redshift\nluminous sub-mm-selected sources should contain an active (and growing) black\nhole, the typical luminosity of the AGN in such objects is ~1000 times smaller\nthan that of the most powerful AGN. This is consistent with the almost complete\nfailure to detect sub-mm selected galaxies with existing X-ray surveys. Finally\nthe model yields a black-hole:spheroid mass ratio which evolves rapidly in the\nfirst Gyr, but asymptotes to ~ 0.001-0.003 in agreement with results at low\nredshift. This ratio arises not because the AGN terminates star formation, but\nbecause fueling of the massive black hole is linked to the total mass of gas\navailable for star formation in the host. \n\n"}

We first model the protoplanetary\nnebula as a time-dependent accretion disc and find self-similar solutions to\nthe equations of the accretion disc that give to us explicit formulas for the\nspatial structure and the temporal evolution of the nebula. These equations are\nthen used to obtain the migration rate of the planet in the planetesimal disc\nand to study how the migration rate depends on the disc mass, on its time\nevolution and on some values of the dimensionless viscosity parameter alpha. We\nfind that planets that are embedded in planetesimal discs, having total mass of\n10^{-4}-0.1 M_{\\odot}, can migrate inward a large distance for low values of\nalpha (e.g., alpha \\simeq 10^{-3}-10^{-2}) and/or large disc mass and can\nsurvive only if the inner disc is truncated or because of tidal interaction\nwith the star.

The spectrum contains\nat least 14 independent C IV absorption systems longward of the Ly-alpha\nforest. These systems are found over a path length of Delta z = 0.984,\nconstituting one of the highest densities per unit redshift of C IV absorption\never observed. One of the C IV systems is trough-like and resembles a weak\nBAL-type outflow. Two of the C IV are ``associated'' absorption systems with\n|v|<3000 km/s. Of the 11 remaining systems with v>3000 km/s, eight are either\nresolved or require multiple discrete systems to fit the line profiles. In\naddition to C IV absorption, there are two low-ionization Mg II absorption\nsystems along with two damped Ly-alpha systems, at least one of which may be a\nC IV system. The overdensity of C IV absorption spans a redshift range of Delta\nz=1. Superclusters along the line of sight are unlikely to cause an overdensity\nstretching over such a long redshift path, thus the absorption may be an\nexample of narrow, high-velocity, intrinsic absorption that originates from the\nquasar. We suggest that this quasar is a member of a transitional class of BAL\nquasars where we are just barely seeing the spatial, density, or temporal edge\nof the BAL-producing region (or period); the multiple high-velocity absorption\nsystems may be the remnants (or precursors) of a stronger BAL outflow.

To this end, we investigate the origin of the dispersion\nobserved in the evolution of both nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio and galaxy\nluminosity as a function of metallicity for a large sample of starburst\ngalaxies. We find that the variation of the star formation efficiency, in the\nframework of continuous star formation models, produce a scatter equivalent to\nwhat is observed in the N/O versus O/H diagram for low-mass HII galaxies only.\nHowever, continous star formation models are unable to reproduce i) the scatter\nobserved for massive starburst and UV-selected galaxies in the N/O versus O/H\nrelation, and ii) the scatter in the luminosity versus O/H scaling relation\nobserved for the whole sample of starburst galaxies. The dispersion associated\nwith the distribution of N/O as a function of metallicity, for both low-mass\nand massive galaxies, is well explained in the framework of bursting star\nformation models.

In addition, abundance ratios are derived from the\nratios of line strengths, whose temperature dependences are small within the\ntemperature range of the ICM of M~87. The abundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe\nshow strong decreasing gradients outside 2$'$ and become nearly constant within\nthe radius at $\\sim1.5$ solar. The Fe/Si ratio is determined to be 0.9 solar\nwith no radial gradient. In contrast, the O abundance is less than a half of\nthe Si abundance at the center and has a flatter gradient. The Mg abundance is\n$\\sim$1 solar within 2$'$, which is close to stellar abundance within the same\nradius. The O/Si/Fe pattern of M~87 is located at the simple extension of that\nof Galactic stars. The observed Mg/O ratio is about 1.25 solar, which is also\nthe same ratio as for Galactic stars. The O/Si/Fe ratio indicates that the SN\nIa contribution to Si and Fe becomes important towards the center and SN Ia\nproducts have similar abundances of Si and Fe at least around M~87, which may\nreflect dimmer SN Ia observed in old stellar systems. The S abundance is\nsimilar to the Si abundance at the center, but has a steeper gradient. This\nresult suggests that the S/Si ratio of SN II products is much smaller than the\nsolar ratio. \n\n"}

A similar, but\ndistinct, and also long standing question is whether the structural appearances\nof galaxies, as seen through their stellar light distributions, contain enough\nphysical information to offer this classification. We argue through the use of\n240 images of nearby galaxies that three model independent parameters measured\non a single galaxy image reveal its major ongoing and past formation modes, and\ncan be used as a robust classification system. These parameters quantitatively\nmeasure: the concentration (C), asymmetry (A) and clumpiness (S) of a galaxy's\nstellar light distribution. When combined into a three dimensional `CAS' volume\nall major classes of galaxies in various phases of evolution are cleanly\ndistinguished.

We estimate this function with\nthe aid of hydrodynamic simulations of the Lambda CDM model, finding it\nsignificantly different from the mass density PDF, and not simply related to it\nby linear bias or any of the other prescriptions commonly adopted. If the\noptical light PDF is, in reality, similar to what we find in the simulations,\nthen some measures of Omega_M based on mass-to-light ratio and the cosmic\nvirial theorem will have significantly underestimated Omega_M.

The charge depletion due\nto global flows of charged particles, causes a large electric field along the\nmagnetic field lines. Migratory electrons and/or positrons are accelerated by\nthis field to radiate gamma-rays via curvature and inverse-Compton processes.\nSome of such gamma-rays collide with the X-rays to materialize as pairs in the\ngap. The replenished charges partially screen the electric field, which is\nself-consistently solved together with the energy distribution of particles and\ngamma-rays at each point along the field lines. By solving the set of Maxwell\nand Boltzmann equations, we demonstrate that an external injection of charged\nparticles at nearly Goldreich-Julian rate does not quench the gap but shifts\nits position and that the particle energy distribution cannot be described by a\npower-law.

The probability distribution function of the\nmass field in the LN model is long tailed and so plays an important role in\nrare events, such as the formation of the first generation of baryonic objects.\nWe calculate density and velocity distributions of the IGM at very high spatial\nresolutions, and simulate the distributions at resolution of 0.15 kpc from z=7\nto 15 in the LCDM cosmological model. We performed a statistics of the hydrogen\nclouds including column densities, clumping factors, sizes, masses, and spatial\nnumber density etc. One of our goals is to identify which hydrogen clouds are\ngoing to collapse. By inspecting the mass density profile and the velocity\nprofile of clouds, we found that the velocity outflow significantly postpones\nthe collapsing process in less massive clouds, in spite of their masses are\nlarger than the Jeans mass.

These components are identified\nwith the expanding circumstellar (CS) envelope (Sollerman, Cumming & Lundqvist\n1998), shocked cool gas in the forward postshock region, and multiple Thomson\nscattering in the CS envelope, respectively. The absence of broad P Cygni lines\nfrom the supernova (SN) is the result of the formation of an optically thick,\ncool, dense shell at the interface of the ejecta and the CS envelope.

The X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like gas subcluster just\nexiting the collision site.

Cores that collapse can be either internally sub- or\nsuper-sonic. The former cannot further fragment, and can possibly be associated\nwith the formation of a single or a few stars.

The\noutermost region, relative to the center of the system, is the most likely to\nbecome unstable because there the density gradient is the steepest. Using\nsimple analytical analysis, I find that off-center fat bubbles in PNs are much\nless stable than in clusters. In PNs bubbles become unstable when they are very\nsmall relative to their distance from the center; they can be stabilized\nsomewhat if the mass loss rate from the stellar progenitor decreases for a\ntime, such that the negative density gradient is much shallower. In clusters\nfat bubbles become unstable when their size is comparable to their distance\nfrom the center. I discuss some implications of this instability in clusters\nand in PNs. \n\n"}

For this purpose we use a very large high\nresolution N-body simulation, which allows us to simulate both the fluctuations\nin the ionizing radiation and the small scale LyaF within the same simulation.\nWe find an enhancement of power on large scales for quasars and a suppression\nfor galaxies.

We derive the bias of the QSOs which is a\nstrong function of redshift with b_qso(z=0.53)=1.13+-0.18 and\nb_qso(z=2.48)=4.24+-0.53. We use these bias values to derive the mean dark\nmatter halo (DMH) mass occupied by the QSOs. At all redshifts 2QZ QSOs inhabit\napproximately the same mass DMHs with M_DH=(3.0+-1.6)x10^12h-1M_sun, which is\nclose to the characteristic mass in the Press-Schechter mass function, M*, at\nz=0. If the relation between black hole (BH) mass and M_DH or host velocity\ndispersion does not evolve, then we find that the accretion efficiency\n(L/L_edd) for L* QSOs is approximately constant with redshift. Thus the fading\nof the QSO population from z~2 to 0 appears to be due to less massive BHs being\nactive at low redshift. We apply different methods to estimate, t_qso, the\nactive lifetime of QSOs and constrain this to be in the range 4x10^6-6x10^8\nyears at z~2. (Abridged). \n\n"}

Detailed cooling and heating processes in the interstellar medium are\ntaken into account using a mono-phase one-zone treatment which allows a more\nreliable modelling of the galactic wind regime with respect to previous work.\nThe model successfully reproduces simultaneously the mass-metallicity,\ncolour-magnitude, the L_X - L_B and the L_X - T relations, as well as the\nobserved trend of the [Mg/Fe] ratio as a function of sigma, by adopting the\nprescriptions of Pipino & Matteucci (2004) for the gas infall and star\nformation timescales. We found that a late secondary accretion of gas from the\nenvironment plays a fundamental role in driving the L_X - L_B and L_X - T\nrelations and can explain their large observational scatter. The iron\ndiscrepancy, namely the too high predicted iron abundance in X-ray haloes of\nellipticals compared to observations, still persists. On the other hand, we\npredict [O/Fe] in the ISM which is in good agreement with the most recent\nobservations.

The ionised component has yet to be detected directly, but is\nexpected to scatter CMB photons via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. We use\nhydrodynamic simulations of a LambdaCDM universe to create mock quasar spectra\nand CMB sky maps. We find that the high-z Lya forest gas causes temperature\nfluctuations of the order of 1 muK rms in the CMB on arcmin scales. The kinetic\nand thermal SZ effects have a similar magnitude at z=3, with the thermal effect\nbecoming relatively weaker as expected at higher z. The CMB signal associated\nwith lines of sight having HI column densities > 10^18 cm^-2 is only marginally\nstronger than that for lower column densities. The strong dependence of rms\ntemperature fluctuation on mean Lya absorbed flux, however, suggests that the\nCMB signal effectively arises in lower density material.

The unresolved signal in the 0.5-1 keV band\nis dominated by diffuse Galactic and local thermal-like emission. In the 1-8\nkeV band, the unresolved spectrum is adequately described by a power law with a\nphoton index 1.5.

Its resolved linear\nstructure and the convex broad-band spectral energy distributions of three\ndistinct knots are also a common feature among known powerful X-ray jets at\nlower-redshift.

The data are compared to two\ntheoretical optical depth distributions: a model distribution based on the\ndensity distribution of Miralda-Escude et al. (2000) (MHR00), and a lognormal\ndistribution. We assume a uniform UV background and an isothermal IGM for the\nMHR00 model, as has been done in previous works. Under these assumptions, the\nMHR00 model produces poor fits to the observed flux PDFs at redshifts where the\noptical depth distribution is well sampled, unless large continuum corrections\nare applied. However, the lognormal optical depth distribution fits the data at\nall redshifts with only minor continuum adjustments. We use a simple\nparametrization for the evolution of the lognormal parameters to calculate the\nexpected mean transmitted flux at z > 5.4. The lognormal optical depth\ndistribution predicts the observed Ly-alpha and Ly-beta effective optical\ndepths at z > 5.7 while simultaneously fitting the mean transmitted flux down\nto z = 1.6. If the evolution of the lognormal distribution at z < 5 reflects a\nslowly-evolving density field, temperature, and UV background, then no sudden\nchange in the IGM at z ~ 6 due to late reionization appears necessary.

This description allows a quick estimate of both the escape rate of the\natmospheric gas and the lifetime of a planet against the evaporation process.\nIn the energy diagram, we find an evaporation-forbidden region in which a\ngaseous planet would evaporate in less than 5 billion years. With their\nobserved characteristics, all extrasolar planets are found outside this\nevaporation-forbidden region. The escape rates are estimated to be in the range\n10^5 g/s to 10^{12} g/s, with few cases above 10^{11} g/s. The estimated escape\nrate for HD209458b is found to be consistent with the lower limit of 10^{10}\ng/s obtained from interpretation of the HI Lyman-alpha observations.\n  Finally, this diagram suggests possibilities for the nature of the recently\ndiscovered Neptune-mass planets. We find that GJ436b, 55Cnc_e and HD69830b\ncannot be low mass gaseous planets. With density necessarily above 0.5g/cm3 to\nsurvive evaporation, these planets must contain a large fraction of\nsolid/liquid material. Concerning GJ876d, we find that it must have a density\nlarger than ~3g/cm3 to survive the strong EUV energy flux from its nearby\nparent star.

Applying methods from the quantum theory of open systems (the Lindblad\nequation), we show that this basis is given by narrow Gaussians that\napproximate eigenstates of field amplitudes.

We show that magnification\nbias, which is the inevitable modulation of the foreground number counts by\ngravitational lensing, alters both the shape and amplitude of the observed ISW\nsignal. This is true especially at high redshifts because (1) the intrinsic\ngalaxy-temperature signal diminishes greatly back in the matter dominated era,\n(2) the lensing efficiency increases with redshift and (3) the number count\nslope generally steepens with redshift in a magnitude limited sample. At z >~\n2, the magnification-temperature correlation dominates over the intrinsic\ngalaxy-temperature correlation and causes the observed ISW signal to increase\nwith z, despite dark energy subdominance -- a result of the fact that\nmagnification probes structures between the observer and the sources. Ignoring\nmagnification bias can then lead to erroneous conclusions about dark energy.\nWhile the lensing modulation opens up an interesting high z window for ISW\nmeasurements, high z measurements are not expected to add much new information\nto low z ones if dark energy is the cosmological constant. This is because\nlensing introduces significant covariance across redshifts. The most compelling\nreason to pursue high z ISW measurements is to look for a potential surprise\nsuch as early dark energy domination or the signature of modified gravity. We\nconclude with a discussion of existing measurements, the highest z of which is\nat the margin of being sensitive to magnification bias.

(2004) already successfully tested against the wealth of data\non later evolutionary stages. Complementing the model with a simple, physically\nplausible, recipe for the evolution of dust attenuation in metal poor galaxies\nwe reproduce the luminosity functions (LFs) of LBGs and of LAEs at different\nredshifts. This recipe yields a much faster increase with galactic age of\nattenuation in more massive galaxies, endowed with higher star formation rates.\nThese objects have therefore shorter lifetimes in the LAE and LBG phases, and\nare more easily detected in the dusty submillimeter bright phase. The short UV\nbright lifetimes of massive objects strongly mitigate the effect of the fast\nincrease of the massive halo density with decreasing redshift, thus accounting\nfor the weaker evolution of the LBG LF, compared to that of the halo mass\nfunction, and the even weaker evolution between z~6 and z~3 of the LAE LF.

We identify the arc as a gravitationally lensed galaxy at a\nredshift of z=4.92. It is the highest redshift object currently known. A\ngravitational lens model was used to reconstruct images of the high-redshift\ngalaxy. The reconstructed image is asymmetric, containing a bright knot and a\npatch of extended emission 0.4 arcsec from the knot. The effective radius of\nthe bright knot is 0.022 arcsec or 130 h^-1 pc. The extended patch is partially\nresolved into compact regions of star formation. The reconstructed galaxy has\nI_AB= 24, giving a bolometric luminosity of about 3e11 Lsun. This can be\nproduced by a star formation rate of 36 h^-2 Msun /yr (q0=0.5), or by an\ninstantaneous star burst of 3e8 Msun.

This conclusion holds in all currently popular\nhierarchical models for structure formation, and is almost independent of the\nglobal cosmological parameters. We examine whether the sizes, luminosities,\nkinematics and star-formation rates of LBGs are also consistent with this\nidentification. Simple formation models tuned to give good fits to low redshift\ngalaxies can predict the distribution of these quantities in the LBG\npopulation. The LBGs should be small (with typical half-light radii of 0.6-2\nkpc/h), should inhabit haloes of moderately high circular velocity (180-290\nkm/s) but have low stellar velocity dispersions (70-120 km/s) and should have\nsubstantial star formation rates (15-100 Msun/yr). The numbers here refer to\nthe predicted median values in the LBG sample of Adelberger et al. (1998); the\nfirst assumes an Omega=1 universe and the second a flat universe with\nOmega=0.3. For either cosmology these predictions are consistent with the\ncurrent (rather limited) observational data. Following the work of Kennicutt\n(1998) we assume stars to form more rapidly in gas of higher surface density.\nThis predicts that LBG samples should preferentially contain objects with low\nangular momentum, and so small size, for their mass. In contrast, samples of\ndamped Lyman alpha systems (DLSs), should be biased towards objects with large\nangular momentum. Bright LBGs and DLSs may therefore form distinct populations,\nwith very different sizes and star formation rates, LBGs being smaller and more\nmetal-rich than DLSs of similar mass and redshift. \n\n"}

The nonthermal\ncomponent is well fitted by a power-law model with photon index about 2.2. This\ncomponent is attributed to the emission from the synchrotron nebula powered by\nan undiscovered central pulsar. The thermal component has a temperature of\nabout 0.4 keV.

Available terrestrial laboratory data on the isospin diffusion in\nheavy-ion reactions at intermediate energies constrain the slope of the\nsymmetry energy. Using this constraint, we show that the radius (radiation\nradius) of a 1.4 solar mass neutron star is between 11.5 (14.4) and 13.6 (16.3)\nkm. \n\n"}

The\nelectromagnetic transition amplitudes are calculated up to next-to leading\norder within the framework of pionless effective field theory with dibaryon\nfields. We also calculate the $d\\gamma\\to np$ cross section and the photon\nanalyzing power for the $d\\vec{\\gamma}\\to np$ process from the amplitudes. The\nvalues of low energy constants that appear in the amplitudes are estimated by a\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using the relevant low energy experimental\ndata. Our result agrees well with those of other theoretical calculations\nexcept for the $np\\to d\\gamma$ cross section at some energies estimated by an\nR-matrix analysis. We also study the uncertainties in our estimation of the\n$np\\to d\\gamma$ cross section at relevant BBN energies and find that the\nestimated cross section is reliable to within $\\sim$1% error. \n\n"}

We show how to extend the\nframework of the scalar Minkowski valuations to vector- and tensor-valued\nmeasures. The properties of these extensions are described in detail. We show\nthe versatility of these measures by using simple toy models as well as real\ndata. Our applications cover the morphology of galaxy clusters, the structure\nof spiral galaxies, and the geometry of molecules. Furthermore, we consider a\nphysical ansatz closely related to higher-rank Minkowski valuations, the\nRosenfeld functional known from density functional theory. \n\n"}
