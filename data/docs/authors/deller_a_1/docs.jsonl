Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors).

Atmospheres of hot,\nvirialized gas develop in halos above ~2.5e11 Msun, a transition mass that is\nnearly constant from z=3 to z=0. Cold accretion persists in halos above the\ntransition mass, especially at z>=2. It dominates the growth of galaxies in low\nmass halos at all times, and it is the main driver of the cosmic star formation\nhistory. Satellite galaxies have accretion rates similar to central galaxies of\nthe same baryonic mass at high redshifts, but they have less accretion than\ncomparable central galaxies at low redshift. Relative to our earlier results,\nthe Gadget-2 simulations predict much lower rates of \"hot mode\" accretion from\nthe virialized gas component of massive halos. At z<=1, typical hot accretion\nrates in halos above 5e12 Msun are below 1 Msun/yr, even though our simulation\ndoes not include AGN heating or other forms of \"preventive\" feedback. The inner\ndensity profiles of hot gas in these halos are shallow, with long associated\ncooling times. The cooling recipes typically used in semi-analytic models can\noverestimate the accretion rates in these halos by orders of magnitude, so such\nmodels may overemphasize the role of preventive feedback in producing observed\ngalaxy masses and colors.

Our calculations show that the highest mass black holes observed\nin the Galaxy M_bh = 15 Msun in the high metallicity environment (Z=Zsun=0.02)\ncan be explained with stellar models and the wind mass loss rates adopted here.\nTo reach this result we had to set Luminous Blue Variable mass loss rates at\nthe level of about 0.0001 Msun/yr and to employ metallicity dependent\nWolf-Rayet winds. With such winds, calibrated on Galactic black hole mass\nmeasurements, the maximum black hole mass obtained for moderate metallicity\n(Z=0.3 Zsun=0.006) is M_bh,max = 30 Msun. This is a rather striking finding as\nthe mass of the most massive known stellar black hole is M_bh = 23-34 Msun and,\nin fact, it is located in a small star forming galaxy with moderate\nmetallicity.

For the mass reduction case and recoil directed along the disk's\nangular momentum, oscillations are induced in the disk which then modulate the\ninternal energy and bremsstrahlung luminosities.

The design target for such\ninstruments calls for improved sensitivity at low frequencies, specifically in\nthe ~ 1-10 Hz range. This will allow the detection of gravitational waves\ngenerated in binary systems containing black holes of intermediate mass, ~\n100-1000 solar masses. We primarily discuss two different source types --\nmergers between two intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) of comparable mass,\nand intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) of smaller compact objects with\nmass ~ 1-10 solar masses into IMBHs. IMBHs may form via two channels: (i) in\ndark matter halos at high redshift through direct collapse or the collapse of\nvery massive metal-poor Population III stars, or (ii) via runaway stellar\ncollisions in globular clusters. In this paper, we will discuss both formation\nchannels, and both classes of merger in each case. We review existing rate\nestimates where these exist in the literature, and provide some new\ncalculations for the approximate numbers of events that will be seen by a\ndetector like the Einstein Telescope.

Relying on published\ndynamical estimates of the content of the Oort Cloud, we find that Kepler's\nmain program is expected to detect between 0 and ~100 occultation events by\ndeca-kilometer-sized Oort Cloud objects. The occultations rate depends on the\nmass of the Oort cloud, the distance to its \"inner edge\", and the size\ndistribution of its objects.

The thick disks used in the present study\noriginate from cosmologically-common 5:1 encounters between initially-thin\nprimary disk galaxies and infalling satellites. The growing thin disks are\nmodeled as static gravitational potentials and we explore a variety of\ngrowing-disk parameters that are likely to influence the response of thick\ndisks. We find that the final thick-disk properties depend strongly on the\ntotal mass and radial scale-length of the growing thin disk, and much less\nsensitively on its growth timescale and vertical scale-height as well as the\ninitial sense of thick-disk rotation. Overall, the growth of an embedded thin\ndisk can cause a substantial contraction in both the radial and vertical\ndirection, resulting in a significant decrease in the scale-lengths and\nscale-heights of thick disks. Kinematically, a growing thin disk can induce a\nnotable increase in the mean rotation and velocity dispersions of thick-disk\nstars.

The BH resides in a metal-rich [Fe/H]~0.2 globular cluster. After\nRZ2109 in NGC 4472 this is only the second black-hole X-ray source in a GC\nconfirmed via rapid X-ray variability. Unlike RZ2109, the X-ray spectrum of\nthis BH source did not change during the period of rapid variability. In\naddition to the short-term variability the source also exhibits long-term\nvariability. After being bright for at least a decade since 1993 within a span\nof 2 years it became progressively fainter, and eventually undetectable, or\nmarginally detectable, in deep Chandra and XMM observations. The source also\nbecame harder as it faded. The characteristics of the long term variability in\nitself provide sufficient evidence to identify the source as a BH. The long\nterm decline in the luminosity of this object was likely not recognized in\nprevious studies because the rapid variability within the bright epoch\nsuppressed the average luminosity in that integration.

This\nbehaviour of the entropy perturbations is preserved even when the fields are\ncoupled via kinetic interaction. Since, for assisted dark energy, the\nsubdominant field in the early epoch becomes dominant at late time, the entropy\nperturbations can significantly influence the dynamics of density perturbations\nin the universe. Assuming correlations between the entropy and curvature\nperturbations, the entropy perturbations can enhance the integrated Sachs-Wolfe\n(ISW) effect if the signs of the contributions from entropy perturbations and\ncurvature perturbations are opposite after the matter era, otherwise the ISW\ncontribution is suppressed. For canonical scalar field the effect of entropy\nperturbations on ISW effect is small because the initial value of the entropy\nperturbations estimated during inflation cannot be sufficiently large.

In this\nmanuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared.\nThere are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can\nonly be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of\ndegrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of\nreduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of\nreduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain.\nThis uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for\ndifferentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation\nprocedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is\nsurprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in\nastrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used\nwith due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear\nmodels at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods,\nwhich are also applicable to nonlinear models. \n\n"}

We find the\noptical/IR time variability properties of these blazars to be remarkably\nsimilar to those at the gamma-ray energies. The power spectral density (PSD)\nfunctions of the R-band variability of all six blazars are fit well by simple\npower-law functions with negative slope such that there is higher amplitude\nvariability on longer timescales. No clear break is identified in the PSD of\nany of the sources. The average slope of the PSD of R-band variability of these\nblazars is similar to what was found by the Fermi team for the gamma-ray\nvariability of a larger sample of bright blazars. This is consistent with\nleptonic models where the optical-IR and gamma-ray emission is generated by the\nsame population of electrons through synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes,\nrespectively. The prominent flares present in the optical-IR as well as the\ngamma-ray light curves of these blazars are predominantly symmetric, i.e., have\nsimilar rise and decay timescales, indicating that the long-term variability is\ndominated by the crossing time of radiation or a disturbance through the\nemission region rather than by the acceleration or energy-loss timescales of\nthe radiating electrons.

The\nmotivation comes from the fact that super magnetized neutron stars of $\\sim\n10^{15}$G, magnetars, and magnetized proto-neutron stars born after the\nmagnetically-driven supernovae are likely to have such strong toroidal magnetic\nfields. Long-term, three-dimensional general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic\nsimulations are performed, preparing isentropic neutron stars with toroidal\nmagnetic fields in equilibrium as initial conditions. To explore the effects of\nrotations on the stability, simulations are done for both non-rotating and\nrigidly rotating models. We find the emergence of the Parker and/or Tayler\ninstabilities in both the non-rotating and rotating models. For both\nnon-rotating and rotating models, the Parker instability is the primary\ninstability as predicted by the local linear perturbation analysis. The\ninterchange instability also appears in the rotating models. It is found that\nrapid rotation is not enough to suppress the Parker instability, and this\nfinding does not agree with the perturbation analysis. The reason for this is\nthat rigidly and rapidly rotating stars are marginally stable, and hence, in\nthe presence of stellar pulsations by which the rotational profile is deformed,\nunstable regions with negative gradient of angular momentum profile is\ndeveloped. After the onset of the instabilities, a turbulence is excited.\nContrary to the axisymmetric case, the magnetic fields never reach an\nequilibrium state after the development of the turbulence.

Given the uncertainties inherent to age-dating young\nstars, we propose an alternative approach that is to analyse the spatial\ndistribution of disc-bearing low-mass stars and compare it to that of\ndisc-bearing solar-type stars in the same cluster. A significant age difference\nbetween the two populations should be reflected in their average nearest\nneighbour distance (normalised to the number of sources), where the older\npopulation should appear more spread out.\n  To this aim, we perform a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis on the spatial\ndistribution of disc-bearing young stellar objects (YSOs) in six nearby low\nmass star forming regions.

Broadband foreground sources are\nexpected to be roughly four orders of magnitude larger than any cosmological\nsignals, so precise foreground models will be necessary. Such foreground models\noften contain a large number of parameters, reflecting the complicated physics\nthat governs foreground sources. In this paper, we concentrate on spectral\nmodeling (neglecting, for instance, bright point source removal from spatial\nmaps) and show that 21 cm tomography experiments will likely not be able to\nmeasure these parameters without large degeneracies, simply because the\nforeground spectra are so featureless and generic.

In this paper we investigate, using N-body simulations, whether such a\ndynamical scenario is consistent with the observed binary properties in the\nOrion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We find that several different primordial binary\npopulations are consistent with the overall fraction and separation\ndistribution of visual binaries in the ONC (in the range 67 - 670 au), and that\nthese binary systems are heavily processed. The substructured, cool-collapse\nscenario requires a primordial binary fraction approaching 100 per cent. We\nfind that the most important factor in processing the primordial binaries is\nthe initial level of substructure; a highly substructured cluster processes up\nto 20 per cent more systems than a less substructured cluster because of\nlocalised pockets of high stellar density in the substructure.

Currently sampling based methods, which are in general\nstochastic in nature, like Markov-Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC), are being commonly\nused for parameter estimation.

The approach involves two basic processing steps: (1)\nidentification of timing and location of magnetic flux origin and demise events\n(as defined by DeForest et al., 2007) by tracking spatiotemporal evolution of\nunipolar and bipolar photospheric regions, and (2) analysis of collective\nbehavior of the detected magnetic events using a generalized version of\nGrassberger - Procaccia correlation integral algorithm. The scale-free nature\nof the developed algorithms makes it possible to characterize the dynamics of\nthe photospheric network across a wide range of distances and relaxation times.\nThree types of photospheric conditions are considered to test the method: a\nquiet photosphere, a solar active region (NOAA 10365) in a quiescent\nnon-flaring state, and the same active region during a period of M-class\nflares. The results obtained show (1) the presence of a topologically complex\nasymmetrically fragmented magnetic network in the quiet photosphere driven by\nmeso- and supergranulation, (2) the formation of non-potential magnetic\nstructures with complex polarity separation lines inside the active region, and\n(3) statistical signatures of canceling bipolar magnetic structures coinciding\nwith flaring activity in the active region.

The showers are either induced by\ngamma rays or diffuse cosmic ray background. The commonly used test statistic\nto evaluate a possible gamma-ray excess is Li and Ma (1983), Eq. 17, which can\nbe applied to independent on- and off-source observations, or scenarios that\ncan be approximated as such. This formula however is unsuitable if the data are\ntaken in so-called \"wobble\" mode (pointing to several offset positions around\nthe source), if at the same time the acceptance shape is irregular or even\ndepends on operating parameters such as the pointing direction or telescope\nmultiplicity.

The data are\npart of a long-term program to monitor the expansion and energy scale of the\nrelativistic outflow, and to trace the parsec-scale environment around a\npreviously-dormant supermassive black hole (SMBH). The new observations reveal\na significant change in the radio evolution starting at \\sim1 month, with a\nbrightening at all frequencies that requires an increase in the energy by about\nan order of magnitude, and an overall density profile around the SMBH of rho\n\\propto r^{-3/2} (0.1-1.2 pc) with a significant flattening at r\\sim0.4-0.6 pc.\nThe increase in energy cannot be explained with continuous injection from an L\n\\propto t^{-5/3} tail, which is observed in the X-rays. Instead, we conclude\nthat the relativistic jet was launched with a wide range of Lorentz factors,\nobeying E(>Gamma) \\propto Gamma^{-2.5}. The similar ratio of duration to\ndynamical timescale for Sw1644+57 and GRBs suggests that this result may be\napplicable to GRBs as well. The radial density profile may be indicative of\nBondi accretion, with the inferred flattening at r\\sim0.5 pc in good agreement\nwith the Bondi radius for a \\sim10^6 M_sun black hole. The density at \\sim0.5\npc is about a factor of 30 times lower than inferred for the Milky Way galactic\ncenter, potentially due to a smaller number of mass-shedding massive stars.\nFrom our latest observations (\\sim216 d) we find that the jet energy is\nE_{iso}\\sim5x10^{53} erg (E_j\\sim2.4x10^{51} erg for theta_j=0.1), the radius\nis r\\sim1.2 pc, the Lorentz factor is Gamma\\sim2.2, the ambient density is\nn\\sim0.2 cm^{-3}, and the projected size is r_{proj}\\sim25 microarcsec.\nAssuming no future changes in the observed evolution we predict that the radio\nemission from Sw1644+57 should be detectable with the EVLA for several decades,\nand will be resolvable with VLBI in a few years. \n\n"}

In the case of 1.35-1.35 $M_{\\odot}$\nmergers the peak frequency scales particularly well with the radius of a NS\nwith 1.6 $M_{\\odot}$, where the maximum deviation from this correlation is only\n60 meters for fully microphysical EoSs which are compatible with NS\nobservations. Combined with the uncertainty in the determination of the peak\nfrequency it appears likely that a GW detection can measure the radius of a 1.6\n$M_{\\odot}$ NS with an accuracy of about 100 to 200 meters. We also uncover\nrelations of the peak frequency with the radii of nonrotating NSs with 1.35\n$M_{\\odot}$ or 1.8 $M_{\\odot}$, with the radius or the central energy density\nof the maximum-mass Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff configuration, and with the\npressure or sound speed at a fiducial rest-mass density of about twice nuclear\nsaturation density. Furthermore, it is found that a determination of the\ndominant postmerger GW frequency can provide an upper limit for the maximum\nmass of nonrotating NSs. The prospects for a detection of the postmerger GW\nsignal and a determination of the dominant GW frequency are estimated to be in\nthe range of 0.015 to 1.2 events per year with the upcoming Advanced LIGO\ndetector. \n\n"}

The strength of CIII 5696\ncritically depends on UV CIII lines at 386, 574 and 884 A. These lines control\nthe CIII 5696 upper and lower level population. CIII 884 plays a key role in\nlate O stars where it drains the lower level of CIII 5696. CIII 386 and CIII\n574 are more important at early spectral types.

Muon\nenergy has traditionally been determined by measuring the specific energy loss\n(dE/dx) along the muon's path and relating the dE/dx to the muon energy.\nBecause high-energy muons (E_mu > 1 TeV) lose energy randomly, the spread in\ndE/dx values is quite large, leading to a typical energy resolution of 0.29 in\nlog10(E_mu) for a muon observed over a 1 km path length in the IceCube\ndetector. In this paper, we present an improved method that uses a truncated\nmean and other techniques to determine the muon energy. The muon track is\ndivided into separate segments with individual dE/dx values. The elimination of\nsegments with the highest dE/dx results in an overall dE/dx that is more\nclosely correlated to the muon energy. This method results in an energy\nresolution of 0.22 in log10(E_mu), which gives a 26% improvement.

Hadronic CR interactions can also lead to a high\nluminosity in gamma rays and neutrinos, enhanced by the confinement of CRs from\ncluster accretion/merger shocks and active galactic nuclei.

Neutrino\nobservations are relevant at high energies, especially at >10 TeV. Our results\nshould be useful for improving experimental searches for high-energy neutrino\nemission. Neutrino telescopes are sensitive to extended sources formed by dark\nmatter substructures and CRs distributed over large scales.

Two different configurations are\nstudied in more detail; an N = 1 polytrope with a typical mass and radius and a\nmore massive polytropic N = 0.62 model with gravitational mass M = 1.98 Msun.\nWe study several evolutions with different initial rotation rates and\ntemperature and determine the gravitational waves radiated during the\ninstability.

In order to\ntrigger the accretion of gas, the core has to grow up to several Earth masses\nbefore the gas component of the protoplanetary disc dissipates. We compute the\nformation of planets, considering the oligarchic regime for the growth of the\nsolid core. Embryos growing in the disc stir their neighbour planetesimals,\nexciting their relative velocities, which makes accretion more difficult. We\ncompute the excitation state of planetesimals, as a result of stirring by\nforming planets, and gas-solid interactions. We find that the formation of\ngiant planets is favoured by the accretion of small planetesimals, as their\nrandom velocities are more easily damped by the gas drag of the nebula.\nMoreover, the capture radius of a protoplanet with a (tiny) envelope is also\nlarger for small planetesimals. However, planets migrate as a result of\ndisc-planet angular momentum exchange, with important consequences for their\nsurvival: due to the slow growth of a protoplanet in the oligarchic regime,\nrapid inward type I migration has important implications on intermediate mass\nplanets that have not started yet their runaway accretion phase of gas. Most of\nthese planets are lost in the central star. Surviving planets have either\nmasses below 10 ME or above several Jupiter masses. To form giant planets\nbefore the dissipation of the disc, small planetesimals (~ 0.1 km) have to be\nthe major contributors of the solid accretion process.

In order to strike a\nfavorable balance between suppression of the stellar halo and conservation of\ndisk flux, we explore the application of principal component analysis (PCA) to\nboth ADI and reference star subtraction.

Here we develop a new test of the cosmic evolution of supermassive\nblack holes (SMBHs) in disk galaxies by considering the local population of\nSMBHs. We show that substantial SMBH growth in spiral galaxies is required as\ndisks assemble. SMBHs exhibit a tight relation between their mass and the\nvelocity dispersion of the spheroid within which they reside, the M_BH-sigma\nrelation. In disk galaxies the bulge is the spheroid of interest. We explore\nthe evolution of the M_BH-sigma relation when bulges form together with SMBHs\non the M_BH-sigma relation and then slowly reform a disk around them. The\nformation of the disk compresses the bulge raising its sigma. We present\nevidence for such compression in the form of larger velocity dispersion of\nclassical bulges compared with elliptical galaxies at the same mass. This\ncompression leads to an offset in the M_BH-sigma relation if it is not\naccompanied by an increased M_BH. We quantify the expected offset based on\nphotometric data and show that, on average, SMBHs must grow by ~ 50-65% just to\nremain on the M_BH-sigma relation. We find no significant offset in the\nM_BH-sigma relations of classical bulges and of ellipticals, implying that\nSMBHs have been growing along with disks.

There exists coordinate transformation which brings the\nmetric into the form free of the horizon. This leads to some paradox since (i)\nthe BSW effect exists due to the horizon, (ii) E_{c.m.} is a scalar and cannot\ndepend on the frame. Careful comparison of near-horizon trajectories in both\nframes enables us to resolve this paradox. Although globally the space-time\nstructure of the metrics with acceleration horizons and black holes are\ncompletely different, locally the vicinity of the extremal black hole horizon\ncan be approximated by the metric of the acceleration one. The energy of one\nparticle from the viewpoint of the Kruskal observer (or the one obtained from\nit by finite local boost) diverges although in the stationary frame energies of\nboth colliding particles are finite.

Although\nphotons have not yet been discovered in the cosmic ray flux at highest\nenergies, the capabilities of the present cosmic ray detectors make their\ndiscovery possible, according to the predictions of conventional models, within\nthe next few years.

In addition, the radioactive decay of elements produced in NS\nbinary mergers may result in transients visible in the optical and infrared\nwith peak luminosities on hours-days timescales. Simultaneous observations of\nthe inspiral GWs and signatures in the electromagnetic band may allow us to\ndirectly and independently determine both the luminosity distance and redshift\nto a binary.

We revisit the\nimpact of this effect on imaging quality and study a new algorithmic strategy\nto deal with the associated operator in the image reconstruction process. In\nprevious studies it has been shown that image recovery in the framework of\ncompressed sensing is improved due to the spread spectrum effect, where the\nw-modulation can act to increase the incoherence between measurement and\nsparsifying signal representations. For the purpose of computational\nefficiency, idealised experiments were performed, where only a constant\nbaseline component w in the pointing direction of the telescope was considered.\nWe extend this analysis to the more realistic setting where the w-component\nvaries for each visibility measurement. Firstly, incorporating varying\nw-components into imaging algorithms is a computational demanding task. We\npropose a variant of the w-projection algorithm for this purpose, which is\nbased on an adaptive sparsification procedure, and incorporate it in compressed\nsensing imaging methods. This sparse matrix variant of the w-projection\nalgorithm is generic and adapts to the support of each kernel. Consequently, it\nis applicable for all types of direction-dependent effects.

In an earlier paper, we have\npresented a Chandra data analysis of the coronae of 53 nearby highly-inclined\ndisc galaxies. Here we study the correlation of the X-ray measurements with\nother galaxy properties and compare the results with those obtained for\nelliptical galaxies. A good correlation is present between the coronal\nluminosity Lx and the SFR.

The X-ray radiation\nefficiency (eta=Lx/ESN) has a mean value of ~0.4% with an rms of ~0.5dex. eta\nfurther correlates with MTF/M* (MTF is the baryon mass measured from the\nrotation velocity and the Tully-Fisher relation, M* is the stellar mass\nmeasured from the K-band luminosity) and the CC SN rate surface density (FSN,\nin units of SN/yr/kpc^2), which can be characterized as: eta=0.41%MTF/M* and\neta=1.4%FSN^-0.3. These correlations reflect the roles played by the\ngravitational mass and energetic feedback concentrations in determining eta.\nThe characteristic temperature of the corona shows little dependence on the\ntotal or specific SFR, the cold gas content, or Lx.

In an alternative formation channel, NSs are\nproduced via the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a massive white dwarf (WD)\nin a close binary. Here we investigate binary evolution leading to AIC and\nexamine if NSs formed in this way can subsequently be recycled to form MSPs\nand, if so, how they can observationally be distinguished from pulsars formed\nvia the standard core-collapse SN channel in terms of their masses, spins,\norbital periods and space velocities. Numerical calculations with a detailed\nstellar evolution code were used for the first time to study the combined pre-\nand post-AIC evolution of close binaries. We investigated the mass transfer\nonto a massive WD in 240 systems with three different types of non-degenerate\ndonor stars: main-sequence stars, red giants, and helium stars. When the WD is\nable to accrete sufficient mass (depending on the mass-transfer rate and the\nduration of the accretion phase) we assumed it collapses to form a NS and we\nstudied the dynamical effects of this implosion on the binary orbit.\nSubsequently, we followed the mass-transfer epoch which resumes once the donor\nstar refills its Roche lobe and calculated the continued LMXB evolution until\nthe end. We demonstrate that the final properties of these MSPs are, in\ngeneral, remarkably similar to those of MSPs formed via the standard\ncore-collapse SN channel. However, the resultant MSPs created via the AIC\nchannel preferentially form in certain orbital period intervals. Finally, we\ndiscuss the link between AIC and young NSs in globular clusters.

Generally, the spatial resolution is defined by (some\nmultiple of) the softening length, whose value is set as a compromise between\nthe desired resolution and the need for limiting small-scale noise. Several\nworks have studied the question whether a softening scale fixed in space and\ntime provides a good enough modelling of an astrophysical system.

We first follow the evolution of a galaxy-like object in\nisolation and then set up a simulation of an idealised merger event.

However, the nature of the mechanism responsible for the tidal\ndissipation in such systems remains uncertain. In this paper, we claim that the\nso-called elliptical instability may play a major role in these systems,\nexplaining some systematic features present in the observations. This\nhydrodynamic instability, arising in rotating flows with elliptical\nstreamlines, is suspected to be present in both planet and star of such\nsystems, which are elliptically deformed by tides. The presence and the\ninfluence of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies, such as stars or hot\nJupiters, are most of the time neglected. In this paper, using numerical\nsimulations and theoretical arguments, we consider several features associated\nto the elliptical instability in hot-Jupiter systems. In particular, the use of\nad hoc boundary conditions makes it possible to estimate the amplitude of the\nelliptical instability in gaseous bodies. We also consider the influence of\ncompressibility on the elliptical instability, and compare the results to the\nincompressible case. We demonstrate the ability for the elliptical instability\nto grow in the presence of differential rotation, with a possible synchronized\nlatitude, provided that the tidal deformation and/or the rotation rate of the\nfluid are large enough. Moreover, the amplitude of the instability for a\ncentrally-condensed mass of fluid is of the same order of magnitude as for an\nincompressible fluid for a given distance to the threshold of the instability.\nFinally, we show that the assumption of the elliptical instability being the\nmain tidal dissipation process in eccentric inflated hot Jupiters and\nmisaligned stars is consistent with current data. \n\n"}

We propose that the magnetic field was amplified to this values\nalready during the formation and the early evolution of the galaxies.\nTurbulence in young galaxies is driven by accretion as well as by supernova\n(SN) explosions of the first generation of stars. The small-scale dynamo can\nconvert the turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic energy and amplify very weak\nprimordial magnetic seed fields on short timescales. The amplification takes\nplace in two phases: in the kinematic phase the magnetic field grows\nexponentially, with the largest growth on the smallest non-resistive scale. In\nthe following non-linear phase the magnetic energy is shifted towards larger\nscales until the dynamo saturates on the turbulent forcing scale. To describe\nthe amplification of the magnetic field quantitatively we model the\nmicrophysics in the interstellar medium (ISM) of young galaxies and determine\nthe growth rate of the small-scale dynamo. We estimate the resulting saturation\nfield strengths and dynamo timescales for two turbulent forcing mechanisms:\naccretion-driven turbulence and SN-driven turbulence. We compare them to the\nfield strength that is reached, when only stellar magnetic fields are\ndistributed by SN explosions. We find that the small-scale dynamo is much more\nefficient in magnetizing the ISM of young galaxies. In the case of\naccretion-driven turbulence a magnetic field strength of the order of 10^-6 G\nis reached after a time of 24-270 Myr, while in SN-driven turbulence the dynamo\nsaturates at field strengths of typically 10^-5 G after only 4-15 Myr.

From a circular orbit fit to the\ncombined dataset, we obtained an improvement of a factor of two in the orbital\nperiod precision, and a factor of 2.5 in the epoch of inferior conjunction\n$T_0$. While the new orbital period is consistent with the previous value of\nGottllieb et al. (1975), the new $T_0$ (and the amplitude of variation of the\nBowen line velocities) exhibited a significant shift, which we attribute to\nvariations in the emission geometry with epoch. We propagate the uncertainties\non these parameters through to the expected Advanced LIGO & VIRGO detector\nnetwork observation epochs, and quantify the improvement obtained with\nadditional optical observations. \n\n"}

The key idea of RM is to measure the time lag $\\tau$\nbetween variations in the continuum emission from the accretion disc and\nsubsequent response of the broad line region (BLR). The measurement of $\\tau$\nis typically used to estimate the physical size of the BLR and is combined with\nother measurements to estimate the black hole mass $M_{\\rm BH}$. A major\ndifficulty with RM campaigns is the large amount of data needed to measure\n$\\tau$. Recently, Fine et al (2012) introduced a new approach to RM where the\nBLR light curve is sparsely sampled, but this is counteracted by observing a\nlarge sample of AGN, rather than a single system.

The\nprimary aim of this paper is the multiwavelength spectral characterization and\nmodeling of this blazar, which is made particularly interesting by the recent\ndiscovery of a lower limit of its redshift of z > 0.6 and makes it a promising\ncandidate to be the most distant VHE source. The source has been observed with\nthe MAGIC telescopes in VHE gamma rays for a total observation time of ~33.6 h\nfrom 2009 to 2011. The source was marginally detected in VHE gamma rays during\n2009 and 2010, and later, the detection was confirmed during an optical\noutburst in 2011. The combined significance of the stacked sample is ~7.2\nsigma. The differential spectra measured during the different campaigns can be\ndescribed by steep power laws with the indices ranging from 3.5 +/- 1.2 to 5.0\n+/- 1.7. The MAGIC spectra corrected for the absorption due to the\nextragalactic background light connect smoothly, within systematic errors, with\nthe mean spectrum in 2009-2011 observed at lower energies by the Fermi-LAT.

On the Relationship Between Disk Stability\n  and Star Formation Abstract: We study the relationship between the stability level of late-type galaxy\ndisks and their star-formation activity using integral-field gaseous and\nstellar kinematic data. Specifically, we compare the two-component (gas+stars)\nstability parameter from Romeo & Wiegert (Q_RW), incorporating stellar\nkinematic data for the first time, and the star-formation rate estimated from\n21cm continuum emission. We determine the stability level of each disk\nprobabilistically using a Bayesian analysis of our data and a simple dynamical\nmodel. Our method incorporates the shape of the stellar velocity ellipsoid\n(SVE) and yields robust SVE measurements for over 90% of our sample. Averaging\nover this subsample, we find a meridional shape of sigma_z/sigma_R =\n0.51^{+0.36}_{-0.25} for the SVE and, at 1.5 disk scale lengths, a stability\nparameter of Q_RW = 2.0 +/- 0.9. We also find that the disk-averaged\nstar-formation-rate surface density (Sigma-dot_e,*) is correlated with the\ndisk-averaged gas and stellar mass surface densities (Sigma_e,g and Sigma_e,*)\nand anti-correlated with Q_RW. We show that an anti-correlation between\nSigma-dot_e,* and Q_RW can be predicted using empirical scaling relations, such\nthat this outcome is consistent with well-established statistical properties of\nstar-forming galaxies. Interestingly, Sigma-dot_e,* is not correlated with the\ngas-only or star-only Toomre parameters, demonstrating the merit of calculating\na multi-component stability parameter when comparing to star-formation\nactivity. Finally, our results are consistent with the Ostriker et al. model of\nself-regulated star-formation, which predicts\nSigma-dot_e,*/Sigma_e,g/sqrt(Sigma_e,*). Based on this and other theoretical\nexpectations, we discuss the possibility of a physical link between disk\nstability level and star-formation rate in light of our empirical results. \n\n"}

Abstract: We describe the Carnegie-Spitzer-IMACS (CSI) Survey, a wide-field, near-IR\nselected spectrophotometric redshift survey with IMACS on Magellan-Baade. CSI\nuses a flux-limited sample of galaxies in Spitzer IRAC 3.6micron imaging of\nSWIRE fields to efficiently trace the stellar mass of average galaxies to\nz~1.5. This paper provides an overview of the survey selection, observations,\nand processing of the photometry and spectrophotometry. We also describe the\nanalysis of the data: new methods of fitting synthetic SEDs are used to derive\nredshifts, stellar masses, emission line luminosities, and coarse information\non recent star-formation. Our unique methodology for analyzing low-dispersion\nspectra taken with multilayer prisms in IMACS, combined with panchromatic\nphotometry from the ultraviolet to the IR, has yielded high quality redshifts\nfor 43,347 galaxies in our first 5.3 sq. degs of the SWIRE XMM-LSS field. A new\napproach to assessing data quality is also described, and three different\napproaches are used to estimate our redshift errors, with robust agreement.\nOver the full range of 3.6micron fluxes of our selection, we find typical\nredshift uncertainties of sigma_z/(1+z) < 0.015. In comparisons with previously\npublished spectroscopic redshifts we find scatters of sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.011 for\ngalaxies at 0.7< z< 0.9, and sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.014 for galaxies at 0.9< z< 1.2.\nFor galaxies brighter and fainter than i=23 mag, we find sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.008\nand sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.022, respectively. Notably, our low-dispersion\nspectroscopy and analysis yields comparable redshift uncertainties and success\nrates for both red and blue galaxies, largely eliminating color-based\nsystematics that can seriously bias observed dependencies of galaxy evolution\non environment. \n\n"}

Assuming\nthat these emissions are caused by magnetic cycles similar to the sunspot\ncycle, we construct flux transport dynamo models of $1M_{\\odot}$ stars rotating\nwith different rotation periods. We first compute the differential rotation and\nthe meridional circulation inside these stars from a mean-field hydrodynamics\nmodel. Then these are substituted in our dynamo code to produce periodic\nsolutions. We find that the dimensionless amplitude $f_m$ of the toroidal flux\nthrough the star increases with decreasing rotation period. The observational\ndata can be matched if we assume the emissions to go as the power 3-4 of $f_m$.\nAssuming that the Babcock-Leighton mechanism saturates with increasing\nrotation, we can provide an explanation for the observed saturation of emission\nat low Rossby numbers. The main failure of our model is that it predicts an\nincrease of magnetic cycle period with increasing rotation rate, which is the\nopposite of what is found observationally.

Large deviations between the abundances of\nthe host star and its gas giants seem likely to occur if the planet formation\nfollows the core-accretion scenario. These deviations stem from the separate\nevolution of gas and dust in the disk, where the dust forms the planet cores,\nfollowed by the final run-away accretion of the left-over gas. ProDiMo\nprotoplanetary disk models are used to predict the chemical evolution of gas\nand ice in the midplane. We find that cosmic rays play a crucial role in slowly\nun-blocking the CO, where the liberated oxygen forms water, which then freezes\nout quickly. Therefore, the C/O ratio in the gas phase is found to gradually\nincrease with time, in a region bracketed by the water and CO ice-lines.

For some analyses we add a currently unpublished set of SEEDS\nobservations, including the detections GJ 504b and GJ 758B. We conduct a\nuniform, Bayesian analysis of all stellar ages using both membership in a\nkinematic moving group and activity/rotation age indicators. We then present a\nnew statistical method for computing the likelihood of a substellar\ndistribution function. By performing most of the integrals analytically, we\nachieve an enormous speedup over brute-force Monte Carlo. We use this method to\nplace upper limits on the maximum semimajor axis of the distribution function\nderived from radial-velocity planets, finding model-dependent values of\n$\\sim$30--100 AU. Finally, we model the entire substellar sample, from massive\nbrown dwarfs to a theoretically motivated cutoff at $\\sim$5 M$_{\\rm Jup}$, with\na single power law distribution.

Secular dynamics controls its long term evolution with orbital\ncommensurability having negligible effect. Secular interactions transfer\nangular momentum between inner and outer orbits unless their apsidal lines are\nparallel or anti-parallel. These choices correspond, respectively, to\northogonal eigenmodes p and a. Each is characterized by an eccentricity ratio\nset by the masses and semi-major axes, i.e., $e_{p, 1}/e_{p, 2}\\sim a_1/a_2$\nwhile $e_{a, 1}/e_{a, 2}\\sim (a_1/a_2)^{-3/2}(m_2/m_1)$. Mode p dominates the\nsystem's current state so $e_1/e_2$ always remains close to $e_{p, 1}/e_{p,\n2}$. A small contribution by Mode a causes $e_1$ and $e_2$ to oscillate with\nperiod $\\sim 10^3\\,\\yr$. Orbital changes should be apparent in a few years.\nThese will reveal the forcing of the apsidal precession of the inner orbit by\ngeneral relativity (GR), and possibly also the smaller contribution due to the\ntidal and rotational distortion of the inner white dwarf (WD). Phinney (1992)\nproposes that the epicyclic energy of a WD-pulsar binary reaches equipartition\nwith the kinetic energy of a single convective eddy when the WD's progenitor\nfills its Roche lobe. We extend Phinney's theory to apply to modes rather than\nindividual orbits. Thus we predict that Mode p and Mode a achieved\nequipartition with eddies in the giant envelopes of the progenitors of the\nouter and inner WD, respectively. The most effective eddies are those with\nlifetimes closest to the orbit period. These were more energetic in the\nprogenitor of the outer WD. This explains why Mode p overwhelms Mode a, and\nalso why the inner binary's orbit is far more eccentric than other WD-pulsar\nbinaries with similar orbit periods. Mode a's small but finite amplitude places\na lower bound of $Q\\sim 10^6$ on the tidal quality parameter of the inner WD. \n\n"}

In this work we study the variation of the Cherenkov\nlight distribution as a function of the azimuth angle in the plane\nperpendicular to shower axis. It is found that the asymmetry induced by the\ngeomagnetic field is most significant for early stages of shower evolution and\nfor showers arriving almost perpendicular to the vector of the local\ngeomagnetic field. Furthermore, it is shown that ignoring the azimuthal\nasymmetry of Cherenkov light might lead to a significant under- or\noverestimation of the Cherenkov light signal especially at sites where the\nlocal geomagnetic field is strong. Based on CORSIKA simulations, the azimuthal\ndistribution of Cherenkov light is parametrized in dependence on the magnetic\nfield component perpendicular to the shower axis and the local air density.\nThis parametrization provides an efficient approximation for estimating the\nasymmetry of the Cherenkov light distribution for shower simulation and\nreconstruction in cosmic ray and gamma-ray experiments in which the Cherenkov\nsignal of showers with energies above 10^14 eV is observed. \n\n"}

We\nespecially wish to know when the spin-down flow forced by the mass loss\nsupersedes the baroclinic flows that pervade the radiative envelope of rotating\nstars. We consider a Boussinesq fluid enclosed in a rigid sphere whose flows\nare forced both by the baroclinic torque, the spin-down of an outer layer, and\nan outward mass flux. The spin-down forcing is idealized in two ways: either by\na rigid layer that imposes its spinning down velocity at some interface or by a\nturbulent layer that imposes a stress at this same interface to the interior of\nthe star. In the case where the layer is rigid and imposes its velocity, we\nfind that, as the mass-loss rate increases, the flow inside the star shows two\ntransitions: the meridional circulation associated with baroclinic flows is\nfirst replaced by its spin-down counterpart, while at much stronger mass-loss\nrates the baroclinic differential rotation is superseded by the spin-down\ndifferential rotation. In fact, we find three wind regimes: weak (or no wind),\nmoderate, and strong. In the first case, the flow in the radiative envelope is\nof baroclinic origin. In the moderate case, the circulation results from the\nspin-down while the differential rotation may either be of baroclinic or of\nspin-down origin, depending on the coupling between mass and angular momentum\nlosses. For fast rotating stars, our model says that the moderate wind regime\nstarts when mass loss is higher than ~1e-11 Msun/yr. In the strong wind case,\nthe flow in the radiative envelope is mainly driven by angular momentum\nadvection. This latter transition depends on the mass and the rotation rate of\nthe star, being around 1e-8 Msun/yr for a 3 Msun ZAMS star rotating at 200 km/s\naccording to our model. \n\n"}

The SFR in turn can be used to make a host of predictions\nconcerning the ionization history of the Universe, the chemical abundances, and\nsupernova rates. We compare the predictions made using a hierarchical model of\ncosmic chemical evolution based on three recently proposed SFRs: two based on\nextracting the SFR from the observed gamma-ray burst rate at high redshift, and\none based on the observed galaxy luminosity function at high redshift. Using\nthe WMAP/Planck data on the optical depth and epoch of reionization, we find\nthat only the SFR inferred from gamma-ray burst data at high redshift suffices\nto allow a single mode (in the initial mass function) of star formation which\nextends from z = 0 to redshifts > 10. For the case of the more conservative SFR\nbased on the observed galaxy luminosity function, the reionization history of\nthe Universe requires a bimodal IMF which includes at least a coeval high (or\nintermediate) mass mode of star formation at high redshift (z> 10). Therefore,\nwe also consider here a more general bimodal case which includes an\nearly-forming high mass mode as a fourth model to test the chemical history of\nthe Universe. We compute the abundances of several trace elements, as well as\nthe expected supernova rates, the stellar mass density and the specific SFR,\nsSFR, as a function of redshift\n  for each of the four models considered. We conclude that observational\nconstraints on the global metallicity and optical depth at high redshift favor\nunseen faint but active star forming galaxies as pointed out in many recent\nstudies. \n\n"}

When the Prandtl number is large\n- such that turbulent diffusion of heat is unimportant - radial radiative\ndiffusion reduces the burst duration compared to models with no diffusive\ntransport of heat. When the Prandtl number is small ($\\lesssim 25$) we find\nthat turbulent diffusion dominates the radial transport of heat, reducing the\nburst duration to $\\lesssim 10^3$ years as well as increasing the burst\nfrequency. Furthermore, inclusion of radial transport of heat extends the range\nof infall rates under which the disc undergoes accretion bursts from $10^{-8}$\nto $10^{-6}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with no diffusion, to $10^{-8}$ to\n$\\gtrsim10^{-4}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with radiative and strong turbulent\ndiffusion.

The H2 column density predicted from the observed column density of K\nI, using the Galactic relationship between N(K I) and N(H2), is comparable to\nN(H I), suggesting a high molecular fraction (~0.65) for the M51 gas toward NGC\n5195.

The observatories belonging to this\ngeneration are composed of arrays of surface detectors and fluorescence\ntelescopes. The duty cycle of the fluorescence telescopes is ~10 % in contrast\nwith the ~100 % of the surface detectors. Therefore, the energy calibration of\nthe events observed by the surface detectors is performed by using a\ncalibration curve obtained from a set of high quality events observed in\ncoincidence by both types of detectors. The advantage of this method is that\nthe reconstructed energy of the events observed by the surface detectors\nbecomes almost independent of simulations of the showers because just a small\npart of the reconstructed energy, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes,\ncomes from simulations.

The ranked classifier is\nsimple and quick to implement while a major advantage of the BAGIDIS wavelets\nis that they are translation invariant, hence they do not need the light curves\nto be aligned to extract features.

The model we used\nefficiently computes reflection and thermal emission contributions to the phase\ncurve, including inhomogeneous atmospheric reflection due to longitudinally\nvarying cloud coverage. We confirm Kepler-12b and Kepler-41b show a westward\nphase shift between the brightest region on the planetary surface and the\nsubstellar point, similar to Kepler-7b.

Here, I present the main conclusions from a\ncomprehensive atmospheric retrieval survey of eight hot Jupiters with\ndetectable molecular absorption in their near-infrared transmission spectra. I\nanalyze the eight transmission spectra using the newly-developed,\nself-consistent atmospheric retrieval framework, SCARLET. Unlike previous\nmethods, SCARLET combines the physical and chemical consistency of complex\natmospheric models with the statistical treatment of observational\nuncertainties known from atmospheric retrieval techniques. I find that all\neight hot Jupiters consistently require carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) below\n0.9. The finding of C/O<0.9 is highly robust for HD209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b,\nHAT-P-1b, and XO-1b. For HD189733b, WASP-17b, and WASP-43b, I find that the\npublished WFC3 transmission spectra favor C/O<0.9 at greater than 95%\nconfidence. I further show that the water abundances on all eight hot Jupiters\nare consistent with solar composition. The relatively small depth of the\ndetected water absorption features is due to the presence of clouds, not due to\na low water abundance as previously suggested for HD209458b. The presence of a\nthick cloud deck is inferred for HD209458b and WASP-12b. HD189733b may host a\nsimilar cloud deck, rather than the previously suggested Rayleigh hazes, if\nstar spots affect the observed spectrum. The approach taken in SCARLET can be\nregarded as a new pathway to interpreting spectral observations of planetary\natmospheres. In this work, including our prior knowledge of H-C-N-O chemistry\nenables me to constrain the C/O ratio without detecting a single carbon-bearing\nmolecule. \n\n"}

In that work, we focus only on the\nmorphology. In this paper we continue our study by calculating the gamma-ray\nradiation. Some cosmic ray protons (CRp) and electrons must be contained in the\nwinds, which are likely formed by physical processes such as magnetic\nreconnection. We have performed MHD simulations to study the spatial\ndistribution of CRp, considering the advection and diffusion of CRp in the\npresence of magnetic field. We find that a permeated zone is formed just\noutside of the contact discontinuity between winds and ISM, where the\ncollisions between CRp and thermal nuclei mainly occur. The decay of neutral\npions generated in the collisions, combined with the inverse Compton scattering\nof background soft photons by the secondary leptons generated in the collisions\nand primary CR electrons can well explain the observed gamma-ray spectral\nenergy distribution. Other features such as the uniform surface brightness\nalong the latitude and the boundary width of the bubbles are also explained.\nThe advantage of this accretion wind model is that the adopted wind properties\ncome from the detailed small scale MHD numerical simulation of accretion flows\nand the value of mass accretion rate has independent observational evidences.\nThe success of the model suggests that we may seriously consider the\npossibility that cavities and bubbles observed in other contexts such as galaxy\nclusters may be formed by winds rather than jets. \n\n"}

The MHD equations are\nsecond-order consistent and conservative. We augment these with a\ndivergence-cleaning scheme, which maintains div*B~0 to high accuracy. We\nimplement these in the code GIZMO, together with a state-of-the-art\nimplementation of SPH MHD. In every one of a large suite of test problems, the\nnew methods are competitive with moving-mesh and AMR schemes using constrained\ntransport (CT) to ensure div*B=0. They are able to correctly capture the growth\nand structure of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), MHD turbulence, and\nthe launching of magnetic jets, in some cases converging more rapidly than AMR\ncodes. Compared to SPH, the MFM/MFV methods exhibit proper convergence at fixed\nneighbor number, sharper shock capturing, and dramatically reduced noise, div*B\nerrors, and diffusion. Still, 'modern' SPH is able to handle most of our tests,\nat the cost of much larger kernels and 'by hand' adjustment of artificial\ndiffusion parameters.

As a result they converge more slowly on\nsome problems (involving smooth, slowly-moving flows) but more rapidly on\nothers (involving advection or rotation).

The fundamental\nchallenge in CCSN theory is to explain how a stalled accretion shock revives to\nexplode a star. In this manuscript, we assume that the shock revival is\ninitiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition\nfor spherically symmetric shock expansion, $v_s > 0$. One of the most useful\none-dimensional explosion conditions is the neutrino luminosity and\nmass-accretion rate ($L_{\\nu}-\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$) critical curve. Below this\ncurve, steady-state stalled solutions exist, but above this curve, there are no\nstalled solutions. Burrows & Goshy suggested that the solutions above this\ncurve are dynamic and explosive. In this manuscript, we take one step closer to\nproving this supposition; we show that all steady solutions above this curve\nhave $v_s > 0$. Assuming that these steady $v_s > 0$ solutions correspond to\nexplosion, we present a new dimensionless integral condition for explosion,\n$\\Psi > 0$. $\\Psi$ roughly describes the balance between pressure and gravity,\nand we show that this parameter is equivalent to the $\\tau$ condition used to\ninfer the $L_{\\nu}-\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$ critical curve. The illuminating\ndifference is that there is a direct relationship between $\\Psi$ and $v_s$.\nBelow the critical curve, $\\Psi$ may be negative, positive, and zero, which\ncorresponds to receding, expanding, and stalled-shock solutions. At the\ncritical curve, the minimum $\\Psi$ solution is zero; above the critical curve,\n$\\Psi_{\\rm min} > 0$, and all steady solutions have $v_s > 0$.

We have implemented our proposal in Balrog, a software\npackage which embeds fake objects in real imaging in order to accurately\ncharacterize measurement biases.\n  We demonstrate this technique with an angular clustering measurement using\nDark Energy Survey (DES) data. We first show that recovery of our injected\ngalaxies depends on a wide variety of survey characteristics in the same way as\nthe real data. We then construct a flux-limited sample of the faintest galaxies\nin DES, chosen specifically for their sensitivity to depth and seeing\nvariations. Using the synthetic galaxies as randoms in the standard\nLandy-Szalay correlation function estimator suppresses the effects of variable\nsurvey selection by at least two orders of magnitude.

In this paper we use high-resolution\nhydrodynamical cosmological simulations to compare the halo and stellar mass\ngrowth of galaxies in a large-scale overdensity to those in a large-scale\nunderdensity (on scales of about 20 Mpc). The simulation reproduces assembly\nbias, that halos have earlier formation times in overdense environments than in\nunderdense regions. We find that the stellar mass to halo mass ratio is larger\nin overdense regions in central galaxies residing in halos with masses between\n10$^{11}$-10$^{12.9}$ M$_{\\odot}$. When we force the local density (within 2\nMpc) at z=0 to be the same for galaxies in the large-scale over- and\nunderdensities, we find the same results. We posit that this difference can be\nexplained by a combination of earlier formation times, more interactions at\nearly times with neighbors, and more filaments feeding galaxies in overdense\nregions. This result puts the standard practice of assigning stellar mass to\nhalos based only on their mass, rather than considering their larger\nenvironment, into question. \n\n"}

In addition to standard\nmicrowave foregrounds, we separately model the microwave counterpart to the\nFermi Bubbles and the signal due to DM, and use component separation techniques\nto extract the signal associated with each template from the total emission. We\nconfirm the presence of the Haze at the level of 7% of the total sky intensity\nat 23GHz in our chosen region of interest, with a harder spectrum $I \\sim\n\\nu^{-0.8}$ than the synchrotron from regular cosmic-ray electrons.

During the dynamical\nevolution of the triple system, the \"eccentric Kozai-Lidov\" mechanism can cause\nlarge eccentricity excitations in the LMXB progenitor, resulting in three main\nBH-LMXB formation channels.

Six months of radio observations of\nthe 2012 nova V5589 Sgr with the VLA and 15 weeks of X-ray observations with\nSwift/XRT show that the radio emission consisted of: 1) a shock-powered,\nnon-thermal flare; and 2) weak thermal emission from $10^{-5}$ M$_\\odot$ of\nfreely expanding, photoionized ejecta.

The spectral evolution of the radio flare, its high\nradio brightness temperature, the presence of unusually hard ($kT_x > 33$ keV)\nX-rays, and the ratio of radio to X-ray flux near radio maximum all support the\nconclusions that the flare was shock-powered and non-thermal.

Our\nBayesian method relies on known prior probabilities in measured emission-line\nluminosity functions and equivalent width distributions for the galaxy\npopulations, and returns the probability that an object in question is an LAE\ngiven the characteristics observed. This approach will be directly relevant for\nthe Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), which seeks to\nclassify ~10^6 emission-line galaxies into LAEs and low-redshift [O II]\nemitters.

We estimate the strain amplitudes\nfrom individual binaries as a function of binary mass ratio for two samples of\nnearby galaxies: (1) those with direct dynamical measurements of $M_{bh}$ in\nthe literature, and (2) the 116 most massive early-type galaxies (and thus\nlikely hosts of the most massive black holes) within 108 Mpc from the MASSIVE\nSurvey. Our exploratory analysis shows that the current PTA upper limits on\ncontinuous waves (as a function of angular position in the sky) can already\nconstrain the mass ratios of hypothetical black hole binaries in many galaxies\nin our samples. The constraints are stronger for galaxies with larger $M_{bh}$\nand at smaller distances.

Gas\nflow is examined by following evolution of basic parameters of accretion flows.\nBoth codes show an overall agreement in the general features of the collapse,\nhowever, many subtle differences exist. For isolated models, the codes increase\ntheir spatial and mass resolutions at different pace, which leads to\nsubstantially earlier collapse in SPH than in AMR cases due to higher\ngravitational resolution in GADGET-3. In cosmological runs, the AMR develops a\nslightly higher baryonic resolution than SPH during halo growth via cold\naccretion permeated by mergers. Still, both codes agree in the buildup of DM\nand baryonic structures. However, with the onset of collapse, this difference\nin mass and spatial resolution is amplified, so evolution of SPH models begins\nto lag behind.

Transient artifacts are detected and masked in each single\nepoch image through comparison with an artifact free, PSF-matched simulated\nimage that is constructed using the PSF-corrected, model fitting catalog from\nthe artifact free coadd image together with the position variable PSF model of\nthe single epoch image. This approach works well not only for cleaning single\nepoch images with worse seeing than the PSF homogenized coadd, but also the\ntraditionally much more challenging problem of cleaning single epoch images\nwith better seeing. In addition to masking transient artifacts, we have\ndeveloped an interpolation approach that uses the local PSF and performs well\nin removing artifacts whose widths are smaller than the PSF full width at half\nmaximum, including cosmic rays, the peaks of saturated stars and bleed trails.\nWe have tested this algorithm on Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data\nand present performance metrics.

Our data, starting from $\\sim16$ days before maximum\nlight and extending to $\\sim463$ days after maximum, provide an unprecedented\ntime series of spectra and photometry for a normal SN~Ia.

Combining the published\nultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) photometry, we derive the contribution\nof UV/NIR emission relative to the optical. SN 2011fe is found to have stronger\nUV emission and reaches its UV peak a few days earlier than other SNe~Ia with\nsimilar $\\Delta m_{15}(B)$, suggestive of less trapping of high-energy photons\nin the ejecta. Moreover, the $U$-band light curve shows a notably faster\ndecline at late phases ($t\\approx 100$--300 days), which also suggests that the\nejecta may be relatively transparent to UV photons.

Aimed at producing a reliable compact source\nsurvey, our automated data reduction pipeline efficiently processed more than\n2000 hours of observations with minimal human interaction. Through application\nof innovative techniques such as image-based flagging, direction-dependent\ncalibration of ionospheric phase errors, correcting for systematic offsets in\nantenna pointing, and improving the primary beam model, we created good quality\nimages for over 95 percent of the 5336 pointings. Our data release covers\n36,900 square degrees (or 3.6 pi steradians) of the sky between -53 deg and +90\ndeg DEC, which is 90 percent of the total sky.

As a proof of concept, we provide results for visibility simulations\nof individual galaxies with flux density S >= 10 muJy at the phase centre of\nthe proposed SKA1-MID baseline configuration, adopting 12 frequency channels in\nthe band 950 - 1190 MHz.

The fraction of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs;\nequivalent width (EW)=>20A) increases from ~10% at z~2 to ~40% at z~5-6, which\nis consistent with previous studies that employ higher Lyman alpha EW cut. This\nincrease in the LAE fraction could be, in part, due to a decrease in the dust\ncontent of galaxies as redshift increases. When we compare best-fit SED\nestimated stellar parameters for LAEs and non-LAEs, we find that E(B-V) is\nsmaller for LAEs at all redshifts and the difference in the median E(B-V)\nbetween LAEs and non-LAEs increases as redshift increases, from 0.05 at z~2 to\n0.1 at z~3.5 to 0.2 at z~5-6. For the luminosities probed here (~L*), we find\nthat star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses of galaxies, with and\nwithout Lyman alpha in emission, show small differences such that, LAEs have\nlower SFRs and stellar masses compared to non-LAEs. This result could be a\ndirect consequence of the sample selection. Our sample of LAEs are selected\nbased on their continuum magnitudes and they probe higher continuum\nluminosities compared to narrow-band/emission line selected LAEs. Based on our\nresults, it is important to note that all LAEs are not universally similar and\ntheir properties are strongly dependent on the sample selection, and/or\ncontinuum luminosities. \n\n"}

We study\nthe formation of a gaseous proto-cluster inside a molecular cloud by performing\nhigh resolution MHD simulations and associate its internal properties to those\nof the parent cloud by varying the level of the initial turbulence of the\ncloud, with a view to better characterize the subsequent stellar cluster\nformation.

Without any additional contributions to the gas velocity field, a\nlarge fraction of the apparently supersonic (${\\cal M}\\sim$2-3) linewidths\nmeasured in both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO (J=1-0) lines can be explained by the\nsaturation of their corresponding sonic-like, optically-thin C$^{18}$O\ncounterparts assuming standard isotopic fractionation.

It is optimized to handle data that results from sophisticated\nmagneto-hydrodynamic simulations. The main purpose of the code is to prepare\nand analyze multi-wavelength continuum polarization measurements in the context\nof magnetic field studies in the interstellar medium. An exemplary application\nis the investigation of the role of magnetic fields in star formation\nprocesses.\n  Methods: We combine currently discussed state-of-the-art grain alignment\ntheories with existing dust heating and polarization algorithms. We test the\nPOLARIS code on multiple scales in complex astrophysical systems that are\nassociated with different stages of star formation. POLARIS uses the full\nspectrum of dust polarization mechanisms to trace the underlying magnetic field\nmorphology.\n  Results: Resulting temperature distributions are consistent with the density\nand position of radiation sources resulting from magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) -\ncollapse simulations.

For each peak in the LS\nperiodogram, we evaluate the statistical significance in two different ways.\nThe first method involves calculating the False Alarm Probability (FAP) using\nnon-parametric bootstrap resampling, and the second method is by calculating\nthe difference in Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) between the null\nhypothesis, viz. the data contains only noise, compared to the hypothesis that\nthe data contains a peak at a given frequency. Using these methods, we scan the\nfrequency range between 7-14 cycles per year to look for any peaks caused by\nsolar rotation, since this is the proposed explanation for the statistically\nsignificant peaks found by Sturrock and collaborators in the Super-K dataset.\nFrom our analysis, we do confirm that similar to Sturrock et al, the maximum\npeak occurs at a frequency of 9.42/year, corresponding to a period of 38.75\ndays. The FAP for this peak is about 1.5% and the difference in BIC (between\npure white noise and this peak) is about 4.8.

Our sample consists of ~50,000 galaxies in the CANDELS fields\n($\\sim880$ $arcmin^2$), which we divide into four main morphological types,\ni.e. pure bulge dominated systems, pure spiral disk dominated, intermediate\n2-component bulge+disk systems and irregular disturbed galaxies. Our main\nresults are:\n  Star-formation: At $z\\sim 2$, 80\\% of the stellar mass density of\nstar-forming galaxies is in irregular systems. However, by $z\\sim 0.5$,\nirregular objects only dominate at stellar masses below $10^9M\\odot$.

Also, quenching implies the\npresence of a bulge: the abundance of massive red disks is negligible at all\nredshifts over 2~dex in stellar mass. However the dominant quenching mechanism\nevolves. At $z>2$, the SMF of quiescent galaxies above $M^*$ is dominated by\ncompact spheroids. Quenching at this early epoch destroys the disk and produces\na compact remnant unless the star-forming progenitors at even higher redshifts\nare significantly more dense. At $1<z<2$, the majority of newly quenched\ngalaxies are disks with a significant central bulge. This suggests that\nmass-quenching at this epoch starts from the inner parts and preserves the\ndisk.

Drawing z\nand M* from the observed galaxy stellar mass functions, we associate a star\nformation rate (SFR) to each galaxy from the tight SFR-M* main sequence, while\ndust attenuation, optical colors and morphologies (including bulge-to-total\nratios, sizes and aspect ratios) are obtained from empirical relations that we\nestablish from the high quality Hubble and Herschel observations available in\nthe CANDELS fields. Random scatter is introduced in each step to reproduce the\nobserved distributions of each parameter. Based on these observables, a\npanchromatic spectral energy distribution (SED) is selected for each galaxy and\nsynthetic photometry is produced by integrating the redshifted SED in common\nbroad-band filters.

In this article, we aim to study this particular evolutionary stage\nsystematically and give the properties of violent WD mergers. By employing the\nEggleton stellar evolution code, we followed a large number of binary\ncalculations and obtained the regions in parameter space for producing violent\nmergers based on the WD + He subgiant channel.

Here after briefly reviewing our previous work on constraining\ngravitational radiation from elliptically deformed pulsars with terrestrial\nnuclear laboratory data in light of the recent gravitational wave detection, we\nestimate the maximum gravitational wave strain amplitude, using an optimistic\nvalue for the breaking strain of the neutron star crust, for 15 pulsars at\ndistances 0.16 kpc to 0.91 kpc from Earth, and find it to be in the range of\n$\\sim[0.2-31.1]\\times 10^{-24}$, depending on the details of the EOS used to\ncompute the neutron star properties.

If the efficiency of converting accreted baryons into stars\nvaries with time, halos of the same present-day mass but different formation\nhistories will have different z=0 galaxy stellar mass. This is one of the\nsources of scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass, $\\sigma_{\\log M\\ast}$.\nFor massive halos that undergo rapid quenching of star formation at z~2,\ndifferent mechanisms that trigger this quenching yield different values of\n$\\sigma_{\\log M\\ast}$. We use this framework to test various models in which\nquenching begins after a galaxy crosses a threshold in one of the following\nphysical quantities: redshift, halo mass, stellar mass, and stellar-to-halo\nmass ratio. Our model is highly idealized, with other sources of scatter likely\nto arise as more physics is included. Thus, our test is whether a model can\nproduce scatter lower than observational bounds, leaving room for other\nsources. Recent measurements find $\\sigma_{\\log M\\ast}=0.16$ dex for 10^11 Msol\ngalaxies. Under the assumption that the threshold is constant with time, such a\nlow value of $\\sigma_{\\log M\\ast}$ rules out all of these models with the\nexception of quenching by a stellar mass treshold. Most physical quantities,\nsuch as metallicity, will increase scatter if they are uncorrelated with halo\nformation history. Thus, to decrease the scatter of a given model, galaxy\nproperties would correlate tightly with formation history, creating testable\npredictions for their clustering. Understanding why $\\sigma_{\\log M\\ast}$ is so\nsmall may be key to understanding the physics of galaxy formation. \n\n"}

These\npredefined intervals serve as our \"active temporal windows\" in a search for an\nexcess of neutrinos, relative to Poisson fluctuations of the near-isotropic\natmospheric neutrino background which dominates at these energies. After\ndefining the parameters of an optimized search, we confirm the expected Poisson\nbehavior with Monte Carlo simulations prior to testing for excess neutrinos in\nthe actual data. We make two searches: One for excess neutrinos associated with\nthe bright flares of Mrk 421 that occurred during the IC40 run, and one for\nexcess neutrinos associated with the brightest emission periods of five other\nblazars (Mrk 501, 1ES 0805+524, 1ES 1218+304, 3C66A, and W Comae), all\nsignificantly fainter than the Mrk 421 flares.

Previous extensive X-ray studies of SN 2010jl have revealed\nthat X-ray spectra are dominated by thermal emission, which likely arises from\na hot plasma heated by a forward shock propagating into a massive circumstellar\nmedium (CSM). Interestingly, an additional soft X-ray component was required to\nreproduce the spectra at a period of ~1-2 yr after the SN explosion. Although\nthis component is likely associated with the SN, its origin remained an open\nquestion. We find a similar, additional soft X-ray component from the other two\nSNe IIn as well.

However, the\ndifferences in central galaxy and group properties in and outside of filaments\nare not clear in some group mass bins. We show that the differences in central\ngalaxy properties are due to the higher abundances of elliptical galaxies in\nfilaments. Filamentary structures in the cosmic web are not simply visual\nassociations of galaxies, but rather play an important role in shaping the\nproperties of groups and their central galaxies. The differences in central\ngalaxy and group properties in and outside of cosmic web filaments are not\nsimple effects related to large-scale environmental density.

We provide a self-consistent, unified treatment of TDEs by non-spinning\n(Schwarzschild) black holes, investigating several effects of general\nrelativity including changes to the boundary in phase space that defines the\nloss-cone orbits on which stars are tidally disrupted or captured. TDE rates\ndecrease rapidly at large black-hole masses due to direct stellar capture, but\nthis effect is slightly countered by the widening of the loss cone due to the\nstronger tidal fields in general relativity. We provide a new mapping procedure\nthat translates between Newtonian gravity and general relativity, allowing us\nto better compare predictions in both gravitational theories. Partial tidal\ndisruptions in relativity will strip more material from the star and produce\nmore tightly bound debris than in Newtonian gravity for a stellar orbit with\nthe same angular momentum. However, for deep encounters leading to full\ndisruption in both theories, the stronger tidal forces in relativity imply that\nthe star is disrupted further from the black hole and that the debris is\ntherefore less tightly bound, leading to a smaller peak fallback accretion\nrate. We also examine the capture of tidal debris by the horizon and the\nrelativistic pericenter precession of tidal debris, finding that black holes of\n$10^6$ solar masses and above generate tidal debris precessing by $10^\\circ$ or\nmore per orbit. \n\n"}

Here\nwe report the sub-arcsecond localization of FRB 121102, the only known\nrepeating burst source, using high-time-resolution radio interferometric\nobservations that directly image the bursts themselves. Our precise\nlocalization reveals that FRB 121102 originates within 100 mas of a faint 180\nuJy persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with\nnon-thermal emission, and a faint (25th magnitude) optical counterpart. The\nflux density of the persistent radio source varies by tens of percent on day\ntimescales, and very long baseline radio interferometry yields an angular size\nless than 1.7 mas. Our observations are inconsistent with the fast radio burst\nhaving a Galactic origin or its source being located within a prominent\nstar-forming galaxy. Instead, the source appears to be co-located with a\nlow-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a previously unknown type of\nextragalactic source. [Truncated] If other fast radio bursts have similarly\nfaint radio and optical counterparts, our findings imply that direct\nsub-arcsecond localizations of FRBs may be the only way to provide reliable\nassociations. \n\n"}

We find these galaxies to reside in a diverse range of\nenvironments measured by four methods: group membership (whether a galaxy is a\nbrightest group/cluster galaxy, satellite, or isolated), halo mass, large-scale\nmass density (measured over a few Mpc), and local mass density (measured within\nthe $N$th neighbour). The spatially resolved IFS stellar kinematics provide\nrobust measurements of the spin parameter $\\lambda_e$ and enable us to examine\nthe relationship among $\\lambda_e$, $M_*$, and galaxy environment. We find a\nstrong correlation between $\\lambda_e$ and $M_*$, where the average $\\lambda_e$\ndecreases from $\\sim 0.4$ to below 0.1 with increasing mass, and the fraction\nof slow rotators $f_{\\rm slow}$ increases from $\\sim 10$% to 90%. We show for\nthe first time that at fixed $M_*$, there are almost no trends between galaxy\nspin and environment; the apparent kinematic morphology-density relation for\nETGs is therefore primarily driven by $M_*$ and is accounted for by the joint\ncorrelations between $M_*$ and spin, and between $M_*$ and environment.

Although the number\nof GRBs identified at z>6 remains small, they provide a unique window on\ntypical star-forming galaxies at that time, and thus are complementary to deep\nfield observations. We report the identification of the optical drop-out\nafterglow of Swift GRB 120923A in near-infrared Gemini-North imaging, and\nderive a redshift of z=7.84_{-0.12}^{+0.06} from VLT/X-shooter spectroscopy. At\nthis redshift the peak 15-150 keV luminosity of the burst was 3.2x10^52 erg/s,\nand in fact the burst was close to the Swift/BAT detection threshold. The X-ray\nand near-infrared afterglow were also faint, and in this sense it was a rather\ntypical long-duration GRB in terms of rest-frame luminosity. We present ground-\nand space-based follow-up observations spanning from X-ray to radio, and find\nthat a standard external shock model with a constant-density circumburst\nenvironment with density, n~4x10^-2 cm^-3 gives a good fit to the data. The\nnear-infrared light curve exhibits a sharp break at t~3.4 days in the observer\nframe, which if interpreted as being due to a jet corresponds to an opening\nangle of ~5 degrees.

Because the $Z'$ is\nanomalous, these kinds of DM models can be realized only as effective field\ntheories (EFTs) with a well-defined cutoff, where heavy spectator fermions\nrestore gauge invariance at high energies. We formulate these EFTs, estimate\ntheir cutoff and properly take into account the effect of the Chern-Simons\nterms one obtains after the spectator fermions are integrated out.

We present an MHD method that can stably evolve essentially force-free,\nhighly magnetized regions, and describe the first time-dependent relativistic\nsimulations of magnetized accretion onto millisecond pulsars.

The unprecedented five hours of strictly\nsimultaneous X-ray and radio continuum coverage for the first time\nunambiguously show a highly reproducible, anti-correlated variability pattern.\nThe characteristic switches from the X-ray high mode into a low mode are always\naccompanied by a radio brightening with duration that closely matches the X-ray\nlow mode interval.

We show that the\nfraction of systems reaching high eccentricities is enhanced relative to triple\nsystems, over a broader range of parameter space. We show that this fraction\ngrows with time, unlike triple systems evolved at quadrupole order.

We discuss these results in the context of\nstar-star and white dwarf-white dwarf(WD) binaries, with emphasis on WD-WD\nmergers and collisions relevant to the Type Ia supernova problem. For star-star\nsystems, we find that more than 30% of systems reach high eccentricity within a\nHubble time, potentially forming triple systems via stellar mergers or close\nbinaries.

Our detection rate and the\nmaximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable to previous surveys,\nall made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating\ncircular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose\nthat the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength\nsample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly\npolarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.\nCircular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or\nshorter than our median sampling interval <1 month.

As the deviation parameter related to\nquadrupole mass moment is negative, the shadow of compact object is prolate and\nthere are two disconnected main shadows with eyebrows located symmetrically on\nboth sides of the equatorial plane. As the deviation parameter is positive, the\nshadow becomes oblate and the main shadow is joined together in the equatorial\nplane.

However, our understanding of\nhow galaxy mergers, a major evolutionary transformation, impact the CGM remains\ndeficient. We present a theoretical study of the effect of galaxy mergers on\nthe CGM. We use hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations of a major\nmerger selected from the Illustris project such that the z=0 descendant has a\nhalo mass and stellar mass comparable to the Milky Way. To study the CGM we\nthen re-simulated this system at a 40 times better mass resolution, and\nincluded detailed post-processing ionization modelling. Our work demonstrates\nthe effect the merger has on the characteristic size of the CGM, its\nmetallicity, and the predicted covering fraction of various commonly observed\ngas-phase species, such as H I, C IV, and O VI. We show that merger-induced\noutflows can increase the CGM metallicity by 0.2-0.3 dex within 0.5 Gyr\npost-merger. These effects last up to 6 Gyr post-merger. While the merger\nincreases the total metal covering fractions by factors of 2-3, the covering\nfractions of commonly observed UV ions decrease due to the hard ionizing\nradiation from the active galactic nucleus, which we model explicitly.

After few days, the HeI\n5876 A transition appears with a P-Cygni profile and an expansion velocity of\nabout 8700 km/s. Fifty days after maximum, the spectrum shows signs typically\nseen in interacting supernovae. A broad (FWHM~8000 km/s) Halpha becomes more\nprominent with time until ~150 days after maximum and quickly declines later\non. At these phases Halpha starts to show an intermediate component, which\ntogether with the blue pseudo-continuum are clues that the ejecta begin to\ninteract with the CSM. The spectra at the latest phases look very similar to\nthe nebular spectra of stripped-envelope SNe. The early part (the first 40 days\nafter maximum) of the bolometric curve, which peaks at a luminosity\nintermediate between normal and superluminous supernovae, is well reproduced by\na model in which the energy budget is essentially coming from ejecta\nrecombination and 56Ni decay.

The two main channels for such an energy increase are (i)\n\\emph{radial}: more energy carried by slower material (in the visible region)\ngradually catches up with the afterglow shock and energizes it, and (ii)\n\\emph{angular}: more energy in relativistic outflow moving at different angles\nto our line of sight, whose radiation is initially beamed away from us but its\nbeaming cone gradually reaches our line of sight as it decelerates. One cannot\ndistinguish between these explanations (or combinations of them) using only the\nX-ray to radio $F_\\nu(t)$.

The rates of tidal dissipation and tidal\nevolution of orbits are estimated, assuming an Earth-like rheology for the\nplanets. We find that under this assumption the planets b, d, e were captured\nin the 3:2 or higher spin-orbit resonances during the initial spin-down but\nslipped further down into the 1:1 resonance. Dependent on its rheology, the\ninnermost planet b may be captured in a stable pseudosynchronous rotation.\nNon-synchronous rotation ensures higher levels of tidal dissipation and\ninternal heating. The positive feedback between the viscosity and the\ndissipation rate -- and the ensuing runaway heating -- are terminated by a few\nself-regulation processes. When the temperature is high and the viscosity is\nlow enough, the planet spontaneously leaves the 3:2 resonance.

Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new\nmaterialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2,\nwhich is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic\nsources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue\nsource list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the\ntwo data releases as independent. \n\n"}

To exploit the epoch astrometry of asteroids in Gaia DR2 it is\nnecessary to take into account the unusual properties of the uncertainty, as\nthe position information is nearly one-dimensional. When this aspect is handled\nappropriately, an orbit fit can be obtained with post-fit residuals that are\noverall consistent with the a-priori error model that was used to define\nindividual values of the astrometric uncertainty. The distribution of residuals\nallowed us to identify possible contaminants in the data set. Photometry in the\nG band was compared to computed values from reference asteroid shapes and to\nthe flux registered at the corresponding epochs by the red and blue photometers\n(RP and BP). The overall astrometric performance is close to the expectations,\nwith an optimal range of brightness G~12-17. In this range, the typical\ntransit-level accuracy is well below 1 mas.

However, when observed\nscatter of BMR tilts around Joy's law with a standard deviation of $15^\\circ$,\nis considered, our model produces a variation in the solar cycle, including\nnorth-south asymmetry comparable to the observations. The morphology of\nmagnetic fields closely resembles observations, in particular the surface\nradial field possesses a more mixed polarity field. Observed scatter also\nproduces grand minima.

The thermal phase mapping problem has previously been solved\nanalytically, with orthogonal maps---spherical harmonics---yielding orthogonal\nlightcurves---sinusoids.

Previous\nefforts have either adopted spherical harmonics, or various ad hoc map\nparameterizations, none of which produce orthogonal lightcurves.

Previous numerical studies of isolated\ngalaxies suggest that a fast dynamo amplification might suffice to bridge the\ngap spanning many orders of magnitude in strength between the weak early\nUniverse magnetic fields and the ones observed in high redshift galaxies.

A\ngalactic turbulent dynamo is found to be naturally excited in this cosmological\nenvironment, being responsible for most of the amplification of the magnetic\nenergy. Indeed, we find that the magnetic energy spectra of simulated galaxies\ndisplay telltale inverse cascades. Overall, the amplification process can be\ndivided in three main phases, which are related to different physical\nmechanisms driving galaxy evolution: an initial collapse phase, an\naccretion-driven phase, and a feedback-driven phase.

In this study, we use two-point auto, cross and mark correlation\nfunctions to investigate the extent to which small-scale clustering properties\nof star forming galaxies can be used to gain physical insight into\ngalaxy-galaxy interactions between galaxies of similar optical brightness and\nstellar mass. The Halpha star formers, drawn from the highly spatially complete\nGalaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, show an increase in clustering on small\nseparations. Moreover, the clustering strength shows a strong dependence on\noptical brightness and stellar mass, where (1) the clustering amplitude of\noptically brighter galaxies at a given separation is larger than that of\noptically fainter systems, (2) the small scale clustering properties (e.g. the\nstrength, the scale at which the signal relative to the fiducial power law\nplateaus) of star forming galaxies appear to differ as a function of increasing\noptical brightness of galaxies. According to cross and mark correlation\nanalyses, the former result is largely driven by the increased dust content in\noptically bright star forming galaxies.

In all\ncases, a BH binary forms and hardens on time-scales of at most 100~Myr,\ncoalescing on another few hundred Myr time-scale, depending on the\ncharacteristic density and orbital eccentricity. Overall, the sinking of the BH\nbinary takes no more than $\\sim$0.5~Gyr after the merger of the two galaxies is\ncompleted, but can be much faster for very plunging orbits. Comparing with\nprevious numerical simulations following the decay of BHs in massive early-type\ngalaxies at $z \\sim 3$, we confirm that the characteristic density is the most\ncrucial parameter determining the overall BH merging time-scale, despite the\nstructural diversity of the host galaxies.

Despite many efforts in trying to mitigate the effect of\nstellar activity using empirical and statistical techniques, it seems that we\nare facing an obstacle that will be extremely difficult to overcome using\ncurrent techniques. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to derive\nprecise RVs considering the wealth of information present in high-resolution\nspectra. This new method consists in building a master spectrum from all\nobservations and measure the RVs of each spectral line in a spectrum relative\nto it. When analysing several spectra, the final product is the RVs of each\nline as a function of time. We demonstrate on three stars intensively observed\nwith HARPS that our new method gives RVs that are extremely similar to the ones\nderived from the HARPS data reduction software. Our new approach to derive RVs\ndemonstrates that the non-stability of daily HARPS wavelength solution induces\nnight-to-night RV offsets with an standard deviation of 0.4 m/s, and we propose\na solution to correct for this systematic. Finally, and this is probably the\nmost astrophysically relevant result of this paper, we demonstrate that some\nspectral lines are strongly affected by stellar activity while others are not.\nBy measuring the RVs on two carefully selected subsample of spectral lines, we\ndemonstrate that we can boost by a factor of 2 or mitigate by a factor of 1.6\nthe red noise induced by stellar activity in the 2010 RVs of Alpha Cen B.

Because of their success, CNN-based methods\nare becoming increasingly popular in Cosmology.

Graphs are\nversatile data structures that can act as a discrete representation of a\ncontinuous manifold. Using the graph-based representation, we define many of\nthe standard CNN operations, such as convolution and pooling. With filters\nrestricted to being radial, our convolutions are equivariant to rotation on the\nsphere, and DeepSphere can be made invariant or equivariant to rotation. This\nway, DeepSphere is a special case of a graph CNN, tailored to the HEALPix\nsampling of the sphere. This approach is computationally more efficient than\nusing spherical harmonics to perform convolutions. We demonstrate the method on\na classification problem of weak lensing mass maps from two cosmological models\nand compare the performance of the CNN with that of two baseline classifiers.\nThe results show that the performance of DeepSphere is always superior or equal\nto both of these baselines. For high noise levels and for data covering only a\nsmaller fraction of the sphere, DeepSphere achieves typically 10% better\nclassification accuracy than those baselines.

Although the long period variables cannot be fully\ncharacterized within the time span of this program, the enormous advance in\nsensitivity provided by the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space\nTelescope allows accurate characterization of the RR Lyrae population in this\nfield. We find 29 RRab stars with a mean period of 0.594 days, 25 RRc stars\nwith a mean period of 0.316 days, and 1 RRd star with a fundamental period of\n0.473 days and a first overtone period of 0.353 days.

MOND requires\ngravitation to depart from Newtonian theory in the extragalactic regime where\ndynamical accelerations are small. So far relativistic gravitation theories\nproposed to underpin MOND have either clashed with the post-Newtonian tests of\ngeneral relativity, or failed to provide significant gravitational lensing, or\nviolated hallowed principles by exhibiting superluminal scalar waves or an\n\\textit{a priori} vector field. We develop a relativistic MOND inspired theory\nwhich resolves these problems. In it gravitation is mediated by metric, a\nscalar field and a 4-vector field, all three dynamical. For a simple choice of\nits free function, the theory has a Newtonian limit for nonrelativistic\ndynamics with significant acceleration, but a MOND limit when accelerations are\nsmall. We calculate the $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ PPN coefficients showing them to\nagree with solar system measurements. The gravitational light deflection by\nnonrelativistic systems is governed by the same potential responsible for\ndynamics of particles. To the extent that MOND successfully describes dynamics\nof a system, the new theory's predictions for lensing by that system's visible\nmatter will agree as well with observations as general relativity's predictions\nmade with a dynamically successful dark halo model. Cosmological models based\non the theory are quite similar to those based on general relativity; they\npredict slow evolution of the scalar field. For a range of initial conditions,\nthis last result makes it easy to rule out superluminal propagation of metric,\nscalar and vector waves. \n\n"}

We present one-zone chemical evolution models for two dwarf\nstarburst galaxies, NGC 1705 and NGC 1569. Using information about the past\nstar formation history and initial mass function of the systems previously\nobtained from Hubble Space Telescope colour-magnitude diagrams, we identify\npossible scenarios of chemical enrichment and development of galactic winds. In\norder not to overestimate the current metallicity of the interstellar gas\ninferred from H II region spectroscopy, we suggest that the winds efficiently\nremove from the galaxies the metal-rich ejecta of dying stars. Conversely,\nrequiring the final mass of neutral gas to match the value inferred from 21-cm\nobservations implies a relatively low efficiency of interstellar medium\nentrainment in the outflow, thus confirming previous findings that the winds\ndriving the evolution of typical starbursts are differential. These conclusions\ncould be different only if the galaxies accrete huge fractions of unprocessed\ngas at late times. By assuming standard stellar yields we obtain a good fit to\nthe observed nitrogen to oxygen ratio of NGC 1569, while the mean N/O ratio in\nNGC 1705 is overestimated by the models. Reducing the extent of hot bottom\nburning in low-metallicity intermediate-mass stars does not suffice to solve\nthe problem.

Estimating the\n  L_TIR/L_FUV ratio Abstract: We analyze the dust attenuation properties of a volume-limited,\noptically-selected sample of normal star forming galaxies in nearby clusters as\nobserved by GALEX. The internal attenuation is estimated using three\nindependent indicators, namely: the ratio of the total infrared to\nfar-ultraviolet emission, the ultraviolet spectral slope beta and the Balmer\ndecrement. We confirm that normal galaxies follow a L_TIR/L_FUV-beta relation\noffset from the one observed for starburst galaxies. This offset is found to\nweakly correlate with the birthrate parameter, thus with the galaxy star\nformation history. We study the correlations of dust attenuation with other\nglobal properties, such as the metallicity, dynamical mass, ionized gas\nattenuation, Halpha emission and mass surface density. Metal-rich, massive\ngalaxies are, as expected, more heavily extinguished in the UV than are small\nsystems. For the same gas metallicity normal galaxies have lower L_TIR/L_FUV\nratio than starbursts, in agreement with the difference observed in the\nL_TIR/L_FUV-beta relation. Unexpectedly we find however that normal star\nforming galaxies follow exactly the same relationship between metallicity and\nultraviolet spectral slope beta determined for starbursts, complicating our\nunderstanding of dust properties. This result might indicate a different dust\ngeometry between normal galaxies and starbursts, but it could also be due to\naperture effects eventually present in the IUE starbursts dataset. The present\nmultiwavelength study allows us to provide some empirical relations from which\nthe total infrared to far ultraviolet ratio (L_TIR/L_FUV) can be estimated when\nfar infrared data are absent. \n\n"}
