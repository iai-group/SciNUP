Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors).

Here, we calculate this damping in detail. We derive an analytical\ndescription of the propagation of the flow rate using the solution of\nLynden-Bell & Pringle, in which the disc is assumed to extend to infinity. In\nparticular, we derive the accretion-rate Green's function, and its Fourier\ntransform, which gives the fractional damping at a given variability frequency.\nWe then compare this model to that of a finite disc with the mass supply at its\nouter edge. We find significant differences with respect to the infinite disc\nsolution, which we find to overestimate the viscous damping.

At higher energies, we\ndemonstrate that the electron/positron flux measured at the Earth will be\ndominated by a few young nearby pulsars, and therefore the spectrum would\ncontain bumplike features. We argue that the presence of such features at high\nenergies would strongly suggest a pulsar origin of the anomalous contribution\nto electron and positron fluxes. The absence of features either points to a\ndark matter origin or constrains pulsar models in such a way that the\nfluctuations are suppressed. Also we derive that the features can be partially\nsmeared due to spatial variation of the energy losses during propagation. \n\n"}

GCs\nare therefore expected to host large numbers of MSPs. This is also confirmed\nobservationally. The MSPs continuously inject relativistic electrons into the\nambient region beyond their light cylinders, and these relativistic particles\nproduce unpulsed radiation via the synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC)\nprocesses. It is thus possible, in the context of General Relativistic (GR)\nframe-dragging MSP models, to predict unpulsed very high energy radiation\nexpected from nearby GCs. We use a period-derivative cleaned sample of MSPs in\n47 Tucanae, where the effects of the cluster potential on the individual period\nderivatives have been removed. Using a Monte Carlo process to include effects\nof pulsar geometry, we obtain average injection spectra (with relatively small\nerrors) of particles leaving the MSPs. These spectra are next used to predict\ncumulative synchrotron and IC spectra expected from 47 Tucanae, which is a\nlower limit, as no reacceleration is assumed. We find that the IC radiation\nfrom 47 Tucanae may be visible for H.E.S.S., depending on the nebular field B\nas well as the number of MSPs N in the GC.

The theory of\ngravitational aether is an alternative to general relativity that does not\nsuffer from this fine-tuning problem, as it decouples the quantum field theory\nvacuum from geometry, while remaining consistent with other tests of gravity.\nIn this paper, we study static black hole solutions in this theory and show\nthat it manifests a UV-IR coupling: Aether couples the spacetime metric close\nto the black hole horizon, to metric at infinity.

The currently increased INTEGRAL data\nstimulate us to investigate the reality of this source. We analyze all\navailable observations carried out by INTEGRAL and Swift on IGR J19405-3016. We\nfind that IGR J19405-3016 has a detection significance of ~ 9.4 sigma in the\n20-60 keV band during the observational period between March 2003 and March\n2008. Thus confirms a real source detection reported previously. The source\nposition and error location are therefore updated. The source is found to be\nconstant over years at the hard X-rays. Over the three XRT observations, the\nsource flux varied by up to 39% from the average, and the spectrum is generally\nsoft. The combined XRT/ISGRI spectrum is well fitted with a simple power law\nmodel (photon index 2.11+-0.03). Such a photon index is well consistent with\nthe mean value 1.98 (dispersion 0.27) as obtained from Swift/BAT AGN samples at\n14-195 keV. The spectral slope of IGR J19405-3016 is larger than the average\nspectral slope found by Molina et al. (2009). A similar discrepancy is found\nwith the results of Beckmann et al.

Such an\nassumption is valid in the weak field, as verified by precision experiments and\nobservations, but it need not hold in the dynamical strong-field regime where\ntests are lacking. Fundamental bias can cause systematic errors in the\ndetection and parameter estimation of signals, which can lead to a\nmischaracterization of the universe through incorrect inferences about source\nevent rates and populations.

In three dimensions,\nthis Standing Accretion Shock Instability (SASI) can develop spiral modes that\nspin-up the protoneutron star. Here we study these non-axisymmetric modes by\ncombining linear stability analysis and three-dimensional, time-dependent\nhydrodynamic simulations with Zeus-MP, focusing on characterizing their spatial\nstructure and angular momentum content. We do not impose any rotation on the\nbackground accretion flow, and use simplified microphysics with no neutrino\nheating or nuclear dissociation. Spiral modes are examined in isolation by\nchoosing flow parameters such that only the fundamental mode is unstable for a\ngiven polar index, leading to good agreement with linear theory. We find that\nany superposition of sloshing modes with non-zero relative phases survives in\nthe nonlinear regime and leads to angular momentum redistribution. It follows\nthat the range of perturbations required to obtain spin-up is broader than that\nneeded to obtain the limiting case of a phase shift of pi/2. The bulk of the\nangular momentum redistribution occurs during a phase of exponential growth,\nand arises from internal torques that are second order in the perturbation\namplitude. This redistribution gives rise to at least two counter rotating\nregions, with the maximum angular momentum of a given sign approaching a\nsignificant fraction of the mass accretion rate times the shock radius squared\n(Mdot * r_shock^2 ~ 1E+47 g/cm^2/s, spin period ~60 ms).

They are interesting\nsince binary systems with sub-Chandrasekhar-mass primary white dwarfs should be\ncommon and this scenario would suggest a simple physical parameter which\ndetermines the explosion brightness, namely the mass of the exploding white\ndwarf. Here we perform one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, associated\npost-processing nucleosynthesis and multi-wavelength radiation transport\ncalculations for pure detonations of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. The light\ncurves and spectra we obtain from these simulations are in good agreement with\nobserved properties of Type Ia supernovae. In particular, for white dwarf\nmasses from 0.97 - 1.15 Msun we obtain 56Ni masses between 0.3 and 0.8 Msun,\nsufficient to capture almost the complete range of Type Ia supernova\nbrightnesses.

Localizations by the instruments on Fermi in combination with\nfollow-up by Swift provide accurate positions for observations at longer\nwavelengths leading to the determination of redshifts, the true energy budget,\nhost galaxy properties and facilitate comparison with pre-Fermi bursts.\nMulti-wavelength follow-up observations were performed on the afterglows of\nfour bursts with high energy emission detected by Fermi/LAT : GRB090323,\nGRB090328, GRB090510 and GRB090902B. They were obtained in the\noptical/near-infrared bands with GROND mounted at the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope\nand additionally of GRB090323 in the optical with the 2 m telescope in\nTautenburg, Germany. Three of the events are classified as long bursts while\nGRB090510 is a well localized short GRB with GeV emission. In addition, host\ngalaxies were detected for three of the four bursts. Spectroscopic follow-up\nwas initiated with the VLT for GRB090328 and GRB090510. The afterglow\nobservations in 7 bands are presented for all bursts and their host galaxies\nare investigated. Knowledge of the distance and the local dust extinction\nenables comparison of the afterglows of LAT-detected GRBs with the general\nsample.

The afterglows of long bursts exhibit power-law decay\nindices alpha from less than 1 to ~2.3 and spectral indices (beta) values from\n0.65 to ~1.2 which are fairly standard for GRB afterglows.

Calvera was observed in the X-rays with XMM/EPIC\ntwice for a total exposure time of ~50 ks. The source spectrum is thermal and\nwell reproduced by a two component model composed of either two hydrogen\natmosphere models, or two blackbodies (kT_1~ 55/150 eV, kT_2~ 80/250 eV,\nrespectively, as measured at infinity).

In this thesis,\nwe argue however that these signals are plagued by irreducible astrophysical\nbackgrounds and show how plausible conventional physics can mimic the alleged\ndark matter signals. In particular, we consider the possibility that the rise\nin the positron fraction observed by the PAMELA satellite is due to the\nproduction through (hadronic) cosmic ray spallation and subsequent acceleration\nof positrons, in the same sources as the primary cosmic rays. We present a new\nanalytical estimate of the range of possible fluctuations in the high energy\nelectron flux due to the discreteness of plausible cosmic ray sources. Fitting\nour result for the total electron-positron flux measured by the Fermi satellite\nallows us to fix the only free parameter of the model and make an independent\nprediction for the positron fraction. This model can be tested by considering\nsimilar effects expected for nuclear secondary-to-primary ratios such as B/C. A\nrise predicted above O(100) GeV/n would be an unique confirmation of our\nexplanation for a rising positron fraction and rule out the dark matter\nexplanation.

It is timely to\nreinvestigate how it is calculated and to assess the various uncertainties\nwhich are likely to affect the accuracy of the predictions.

Particular attention is paid to cosmic ray\npropagation. Nuclear cross sections, the proton and helium fluxes at the Earth,\nthe Galactic radial profile of supernova remnants and the hydrogen distribution\ncan also severely affect the signal. The propagation of cosmic ray species\nthroughout the Galaxy is described in the framework of a semi-analytic two-zone\ndiffusion/convection model. This allows to convert the constraints set by the\nboron-to-carbon data into a theoretical uncertainty on the diffuse emission.\nNew deconvolutions of the HI and CO sky maps are also used to get the hydrogen\ndistribution within the Galaxy.

We examine R-parity conserving models where the neutralino is\nthe lightest SUSY particle, so that a mixture of neutralinos and axions serve\nas cold dark matter. The mixed axion/neutralino CDM scenario can match the\nmeasured dark matter abundance for SUSY models which typically give too low a\nvalue of the usual thermal neutralino abundance, such as models with wino-like\nor higgsino-like dark matter. The usual thermal neutralino abundance can be\ngreatly enhanced by the decay of thermally-produced axinos to neutralinos,\nfollowed by neutralino re-annihilation at temperatures much lower than\nfreeze-out. In this case, the relic density is usually neutralino dominated,\nand goes as \\sim (f_a/N)/m_{axino}^{3/2}. If axino decay occurs before\nneutralino freeze-out, then instead the neutralino abundance can be augmented\nby relic axions to match the measured abundance.

Through these processes, this work\nexplored the constituent structure of baryons and the mechanisms through which\nthe interactions between these constituents ultimately control the selected\nreactions. First, hard nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering was studied\nconsidering the quark exchange (QE) between the nucleons to be the dominant\nmechanism of interaction in the constituent picture. It was found that an\nangular asymmetry exhibited by proton-neutron (pn) elastic scattering data is\nexplained within this framework if a quark-diquark picture dominates the\nnucleon's structure instead of a more traditional SU(6) model. The latter\nyields an asymmetry around 90 deg center of mass scattering with a sign\nopposite to what is experimentally observed. The second process is the hard\nbreakup by a photon of a nucleon-nucleon system in light nuclei. Proton-proton\n(pp) and pn breakup in 3He, and double Delta-isobars production in deuteron\nbreakup were analyzed in the hard rescattering model (HRM), which in\nconjunction with the QE mechanism provides a QCD description of the reaction.\nCross sections for both channels in 3He photodisintegration were computed\nwithout the need of a fitting parameter. The results presented here for pp\nbreakup show excellent agreement with recent experimental data. In double\nDelta-isobars production in deuteron breakup, HRM angular distributions for the\ntwo double Delta channels were compared to the pn channel and to each other. An\nimportant prediction from this study is that the Delta++ Delta- channel\nconsistently dominates Delta+Delta0, which is in contrast with models that\nunlike the HRM consider a double Delta system in the initial state of the\ninteraction. For such models both channels should have the same strength. \n\n"}

Its lightcurves in both the prompt and afterglow phases are\nsimilar to GRB 060614, a nearby long GRB without an associated SN. We analyze\nthe observational data of this event and discuss the possible origins of its\nmulti-wavelength emission. We show that its joint lightcurve at 1 keV derived\nfrom Swift BAT and XRT observations is composed of two distinguished\ncomponents. The first component, whose spectrum is extremely soft (\\Gamma =\n4.32), ends with a steep decay segment, indicating the internal origin of this\ncomponent. The second component is a slowly-rising, broad bump which peaks at\n~10^5 seconds post the BAT trigger. Assuming that the late bump is due to onset\nof the afterglow, we derive the initial Lorentz factor (Gamma_0) of the GRB\nfireball and find that it significantly deviates from the relation between the\nGamma_0 and Eiso of typical GRBs. We also check whether it follows the same\nanti-correlation between X-ray luminosity and the break time observed in the\nshallow decay phase of many typical GRBs, which is usually regarded as a signal\nof late energy injection from the GRB central engine. However, we find that it\ndoes not obey this correlation. We propose that the late bump could be\ncontributed by a two-component jet.

The jets can be either powered by rotating black holes or the\naccretion disks surrounding black holes, or both. In this work, we choose the\nmost energetic cavity, MS 0735+7421, with stored energy ~ 10^62 erg, to\nconstrain the jet formation mechanisms and the evolution of the central massive\nblack hole in this source. The bolometric luminosity of the AGN in this cavity\nis ~ 10^(-5) L_Edd, however, the mean power of the jet required to inflate the\ncavity is estimated as ~ 0.02 L_Edd, which implies that the source has\nexperienced strong outbursts previously. During outbursts, the jet power and\nthe mass accretion rate should be significantly higher than its present values.\nWe construct an accretion disk model, in which the angular momentum and energy\ncarried away by jets is properly included, to calculate the spin and mass\nevolution of the massive black hole. In our calculations, different jet\nformation mechanisms are employed, and we find that the jets generated with the\nBlandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism are unable to produce the giant cavity with ~\n10^62 erg in this source. Only the jets accelerated with the combination of the\nBlandford-Payne (BP) and BZ mechanisms can successfully inflate such a giant\ncavity, if the magnetic pressure is close to equipartition with the total\n(radiation+gas) pressure of the accretion disk.

We find that during the\nfirst one and a half week of the outburst the X-ray light curves display drops\nin intensity at regular intervals, which we interpret as absorption dips. About\nthree weeks into the outbursts, again drops in intensity are seen. These dips\nhave, however, a spectral behaviour opposite to that of the absorption dips,\nand are related to fast spectral state changes (hence referred to as transition\ndips). The absorption dips recur with a period of 2.414+/-0.005 hrs, which we\ninterpret as the orbital period of the system.

This work\nrelied on charged current neutrino interaction rates that are appropriate for a\nfree nucleon gas. Here, it is shown in detail that the inclusion of the nucleon\npotential energies and collisional broadening of the response significantly\nalters this conclusion. Iso-vector interactions, which give rise to the nuclear\nsymmetry energy, produce a difference between the neutron and proton\nsingle-particle energies $\\Delta U=U_n-U_p$ and alter the kinematics of the\ncharged current reactions. In neutron-rich matter, and for a given\nneutrino/antineutrino energy, the rate for $\\nu_e+n\\rightarrow e^-+p$ is\nenhanced while $ \\bar{\\nu}_e+p\\rightarrow n+e^+$ is suppressed because the $Q$\nvalue for these reactions is altered by $\\pm\\Delta U$, respectively.

For the stellar core collapse simulation, we present the\nlatest numerical results. We employed a purely nucleonic EOS (Shen-EOS). As an\ninitial condition, we adopted a 100 $M_{\\odot}$ presupernova model calculated\nby Umeda and Nomoto. Changing the degree of rotation for the initial condition,\nwe clarify the strong dependence of the outcome of the collapse on this. When\nthe rotation is rapid enough, the shock wave formed at the core bounce is\ndeformed to be a torus-like shape. Then, the infalling matter is accumulated in\nthe central region due to the oblique shock at the torus surface, hitting the\nPNS and dissipating the kinetic energy there. As a result, outflows can be\nlaunched. The PNS eventually collapses to a BH and an accretion torus is formed\naround it. We also found that the evolution of the BH and torus depends\nstrongly on the rotation initially given. In the BNS merger simulations, we in\naddition employ an EOS incorporating a degree of freedom for hyperons. The\nnumerical simulations show that for the purely nucleonic EOS, a HMNS with a\nlong lifetime ($\\gg 10$ ms) is the outcome for the total mass $M \\lesssim\n3.0M_{\\odot}$.

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM.

If the GeV emission takes place within the BLR, the\ninverse Compton (IC) scattering of the BLR ultraviolet (UV) seed photons that\nproduces the gamma-rays takes place at the onset of the Klein-Nishina regime.\nThis causes the electron cooling time to become practically energy independent\nand the variation of the gamma-ray emission to be almost achromatic. If on the\nother hand the gamma-ray emission is produced farther out in the pc-scale MT,\nthe IC scattering of the infrared (IR) MT seed photons that produces the\ngamma-rays takes place in the Thomson regime, resulting to energy-dependent\nelectron cooling times, manifested as faster cooling times for higher Fermi\nenergies.

{"id": "1210.6093", "contents": "Title: Outflow from Hot Accretion Flows Abstract: Numerical simulations of hot accretion flows have shown that the mass\naccretion rate decreases with decreasing radius. Two models have been proposed\nto explain this result. In the adiabatic inflow-outflow solution (ADIOS), it is\nthought to be due to the loss of gas in outflows. In the convection-dominated\naccretion flow (CDAF) model, it is explained as because that the gas is locked\nin convective eddies. In this paper we use hydrodynamical (HD) and\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to investigate which one is physical.\nWe calculate and compare various properties of inflow (gas with an inward\nvelocity) and outflow (gas with an outward velocity). Systematic and\nsignificant differences are found. For example, for HD flows, the temperature\nof outflow is higher than inflow; while for MHD flows, the specific angular\nmomentum of outflow is much higher than inflow. We have also analyzed the\nconvective stability of MHD accretion flow and found that they are stable.\nThese results suggest that systematic inward and outward motion must exist,\ni.e., the ADIOS model is favored. The different properties of inflow and\noutflow also suggest that the mechanisms of producing outflow in HD and MHD\nflows are buoyancy associated with the convection and the centrifugal force\nassociated with the angular momentum transport mediated by the magnetic field,\nrespectively. The latter mechanism is similar to the Blandford & Payne\nmechanism but no large-scale open magnetic field is required here. Possible\nobservational applications are briefly discussed. \n\n"}

One way\nto distinguish between the SDS and the double-degenerate scenario is to search\nfor the post-impact remnant stars (PIRSs) in SN Ia remnants. Using a technique\nthat combines multi-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations with one-dimensional\nstellar evolution simulations, we have examined the post-impact evolution of\nhelium-rich binary companions in the SDS.

Subsequently, they\ncontract and evolve to become hot blue-subdwarf-like (sdO-like) stars by\nreleasing gravitational energy, persisting as sdO-like stars for several\nmillion years before evolving to the helium red-giant phase.

GAPS utilizes a\ndistinctive detection method using atomic X-rays and charged particles from the\nexotic atom as well as the timing, stopping range and dE/dX energy deposit of\nthe incoming particle, which provides excellent antideuteron identification. In\nanticipation of a future balloon experiment, an accelerator test was conducted\nin 2004 and 2005 at KEK, Japan, in order to prove the concept and to precisely\nmeasure the X-ray yields of antiprotonic exotic atoms formed with different\ntarget materials [1]. The X-ray yields of the exotic atoms with Al and S\ntargets were obtained as ~ 75%, which are higher than were previously assumed\nin [2]. A simple, but comprehensive cascade model has been developed not only\nto evaluate the measurement results but also to predict the X-ray yields of the\nexotic atoms formed with any materials in the GAPS instrument. The cascade\nmodel is extendable to any kind of exotic atom (any negatively charged\ncascading particles with any target materials), and it was compared and\nvalidated with other experimental data and cascade models for muonic and\nantiprotonic exotic atoms. The X-ray yields of the antideuteronic exotic atoms\nare predicted with a simple cascade model and the sensitivity for the GAPS\nantideuteron search was estimated for the proposed long duration balloon\nprogram [3], which suggests that GAPS has a strong potential to detect\nantideuterons as a dark matter signature.

Here we present XMM-Newton and Swift X-ray observations taken after the\nlatest, and presumably the final, outburst of SN 2009ip. We use these\nobservations as well as new near infra-red and visible light spectra, and\npublished radio and visible light observations to put six independent\norder-of-magnitude constrains on the mass-loss rate of the SN progenitor prior\nto the explosion. Our methods utilize: the X-ray luminosity, the bound-free\nabsorption, the H alpha luminosity, the SN rise-time, free-free absorption, and\nthe bolometric luminosity of the outburst detected prior to the explosion.\nAssuming spherical mass-loss with a wind density profile, we estimate that the\neffective mass-loss rate from the progenitor was between 10^-3 to 10^-2 solar\nmasses per year, over a few years prior to the explosion, with a velocity of\n~1000 km/s.

This hypothesis is\nmotivated by two characteristics found generically in simulations of binaries\nembedded in prograde accretion discs: (i) the formation of a central,\nlow-density cavity around the binary, and (ii) the leakage of gas into this\ncavity, occurring once per orbit via discrete streams on nearly radial\ntrajectories. The first feature would reduce the emergent optical/UV flux of\nthe system relative to active galactic nuclei powered by single SMBHs, while\nthe second can trigger quasiperiodic fluctuations in luminosity. I argue that\nthe quasiperiodic accretion signature may be much more dramatic than previously\nthought, because the infalling gas streams can strongly shock-heat via\nself-collision and tidal compression, thereby enhancing viscous accretion. Any\noptically thick gas that is circularized about either SMBH can accrete before\nthe next pair of streams is deposited, fueling transient, luminous flares that\nrecur every orbit. Due to the diminished flux in between accretion episodes,\nsuch cavity-accretion flares could plausibly be mistaken for the tidal\ndisruptions of stars in quiescent nuclei. The flares could be distinguished\nfrom tidal disruption events if their quasiperiodic recurrence is observed, or\nif they are produced by very massive SMBHs that cannot disrupt solar-type\nstars. They may be discovered serendipitously in surveys such as LSST or\neROSITA. I present a heuristic toy model as a proof of concept for the\nproduction of cavity-accretion flares, and generate mock light curves and\nspecta.

A gap-opening secondary close to the primary will\nleave an imprint in the broad component of the FeKa emission line, which varies\nin a unique and predictable manner. If the gap persists into the innermost\ndisk, the effect consists of a pair of dips in the broad line which ripple\nblue-ward and red-ward from the line centroid energy respectively, as the gap\nmoves closer to the primary. This ripple effect could be unambiguously\ndetectable and allow an electromagnetic monitoring of massive black hole\nmergers as they occur. As the mass ratio of the secondary to primary black hole\nincreases to q>0.01, we expect the gap to widen, possibly clearing a central\ncavity in the inner disk, which shows up in the broad FeKa line component. If\nthe secondary stalls at >100r_{g} in its in-migration, due to low co-rotating\ngas mass, a detectable ripple effect occurs in the broad line component on the\ndisk viscous timescale as the inner disk drains and the outer disk is dammed.\nIf the secondary maintains an accretion disk within a central cavity, due to\ndam bursting or leakage, a periodic 'see-saw' oscillation effect is exhibited\nin the observed line profile. Here we demonstrate the range of ripple effect\nsignatures potentially detectable with Astro-H and IXO/Athena, and oscillation\neffects potentially detectable with XMM or LOFT for a wide variety of merger\nand disk conditions. Observations of the ripple effect and periodic\noscillations can be used to provide an early warning of gravitational radiation\nemission from the AGN. \n\n"}

We propose a\nnovel scenario in which known extragalactic positron sources such as radio jets\nof active galactic nuclei (AGN) fill the intergalactic medium with MeV e+e-\npairs, which are then accreted into the Milky Way. We show that interpreting\nthe diffuse cosmic radio background (CRB) as arising from radio sources with\ncharacteristics similar to the observed cores and radio lobes in powerful AGN\njets suggests that the intergalactic positron-to-electron ratio could be as\nhigh as 10^{-5}, although this can be decreased if the CRB is not all produced\nby pairs and if not all positrons escape to the intergalactic medium.

This paper shows that several properties of the Crab are best\nsuited to Type IIn-P explosions (Type IIn spectra with plateau light curves).\nThese events probably arise from relatively low-energy (1e50 erg) explosions\nwith low 56Ni yield resulting from electron-capture SNe (ecSNe), but their high\nluminosity and Type IIn spectra are dominated by shock interaction with CSM.\nAfter about 120 days, nearly all of the mass in the CSM and ejecta ends up in a\nslow dense shell. In the scenario proposed here for SN1054, this thin shell is\naccelerated by the growing pulsar wind nebula, producing the complex network of\nfilaments seen today. There is no need to invoke the invisible fast SN envelope\nhypothesized to reside outside the Crab. SNeIIn-P explain several observed\nfeatures of the Crab: (1) No blast wave or rapidly expanding SN envelope\noutside the filaments, (2) a total mass of 5 Msun swept up in a thin shell, (3)\na high peak luminosity despite the low kinetic energy, and (4) chemical\nabundances consistent with an 8-10 Msun star and low 56Ni yield.

The flow structure is\ngeometrically thick, and independent of the gas density and cooling, if the\ncooling time is longer than the viscous timescale (i.e., $t_{\\rm cool} \\gtrsim\nt_{\\rm visc}$). For higher densities, the gas can cool before it can accrete\nand forms the standard geometrically thin, optically thick Shakura-Sunyaev\ndisk. For usual cooling processes (such as bremsstrahlung), we expect an inner\nhot flow and an outer thin disk. For a short cooling time the accretion flow\nseparates into two phases: a radiatively inefficient hot coronal phase and a\ncold thin disk. We argue that there is an upper limit on the density of the hot\ncorona corresponding to a critical value of $t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff} (\\sim\n10-100)$, the ratio of the cooling time and the free-fall time. Based on our\nsimulations, we have developed a model for transients observed in black hole\nX-ray binaries (XRBs). An XRB in a quiescent hot RIAF state can transition to a\ncold black-body dominated state because of an increase in the mass accretion\nrate. The transition from a thin disk to a RIAF happens because of mass\nexhaustion due to accretion; the transition happens when the cooling time\nbecomes longer than the viscous time at inner radii. Since the viscous\ntimescale for a geometrically thin disk is quite long, the high-soft state is\nexpected to be long-lived. The different timescales in black hole transients\ncorrespond to different physical processes such as viscous evolution, cooling,\nand free-fall. Our model captures the overall features of observed state\ntransitions in XRBs. \n\n"}

One\nmethod that could be used to measure $M$ and $R$ is to analyze the\nenergy-dependent waveforms of the X-ray flux oscillations seen during some\nthermonuclear bursts from some neutron stars. These oscillations are thought to\nbe produced by X-ray emission from hotter regions on the surface of the star\nthat are rotating at or near the spin frequency of the star. Here we explore\nhow well $M$ and $R$ could be determined by generating, and analyzing using\nBayesian techniques, synthetic energy-resolved X-ray data that we produce\nassuming a future space mission having 2--30 keV energy coverage and an\neffective area of 10 m$^2$, such as the proposed \\textit{LOFT} or\n\\textit{AXTAR} missions.\n  We find that if the hot spot is within 10$^\\circ$ of the rotation equator,\nboth $M$ and $R$ can usually be determined with an uncertainty of about 10% if\nthere are $10^6$ total counts from the spot, whereas waveforms from spots\nwithin 20$^\\circ$ of the rotation pole provide no useful constraints.

Most of these high-energy\ngamma-ray spectra, like those of other extreme high-frequency peaked BL Lac\nobjects, can be well explained either by gamma rays emitted at the source or by\ncascades induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, as we show specifically for\nKUV 00311$-$1938.

Aims: This paper shows that the sensitivity of the IceCube\nneutrino telescope in its 40-string configuration (IC-40) is already at the\nlevel of constraining the parameter space of purely hadronic scenarios of\nactivity of blazars. Methods: Assuming that the entire source power originates\nfrom hadronic interactions, and assuming that the models describe the data, we\nestimate the expected neutrino flux from blazars based on the observed\ngamma-ray flux by Fermi, simultaneously with IC-40 observations. We consider\ntwo cases separately to keep the number of constrainable parameters at an\nacceptable level: proton-proton or proton-gamma interactions are dominant.\nComparing the IC-40 sensitivity to the neutrino flux expected from some of the\nbrightest blazars, we constrain model parameters characterizing the parent\nhigh-energy proton spectrum. Results: We find that when pp interactions\ndominate, some constraints on the primary proton spectrum can be imposed. For\ninstance, for the tightest constrained source 3C 454.3, the very high energy\npart of the spectra of blazars is constrained to be harder than E^-2 with\ncut-off energies in the range of Ecut >10^18 eV.

Even though one\nmight expect a background composed of a high-redshift cosmological population\nof sources to be fairly isotropic, deviations from isotropy may be indicative\nof local GW hotspots or some form of continuous anisotropy in the\nangular-distribution of GW-power. A GWB induces time-of-arrival deviations in\npulsar signals which are correlated between separated pulsars.

From a circular orbit fit to the\ncombined dataset, we obtained an improvement of a factor of two in the orbital\nperiod precision, and a factor of 2.5 in the epoch of inferior conjunction\n$T_0$.

(1975), the new $T_0$ (and the amplitude of variation of the\nBowen line velocities) exhibited a significant shift, which we attribute to\nvariations in the emission geometry with epoch. We propagate the uncertainties\non these parameters through to the expected Advanced LIGO & VIRGO detector\nnetwork observation epochs, and quantify the improvement obtained with\nadditional optical observations. \n\n"}

Vela is one of the nearest Galactic composite\nSNRs to Earth accompanied by the Vela pulsar and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN)\nVela X. The Vela SNR is one of the most studied remnants and it benefits from\nprecise estimates of various physical parameters such as distance and age.\nTherefore, it is a perfect object for a detailed study of physical processes in\nSNRs. The Vela SNR expands into the highly inhomogeneous cloudy interstellar\nmedium (ISM) and its dynamics is determined by the heating and evaporation of\nISM clouds. It features an asymmetrical X-ray morphology which is explained by\nthe expansion into two media with different densities. This could occur if the\nprogenitor of the Vela SNR exploded close to the edge of the stellar wind\nbubble of the nearby Wolf-Rayet star $\\gamma^2$Velorum and hence one part of\nthe remnant expands into the bubble. The interaction of the ejecta and the main\nshock of the remnant with ISM clouds causes formation of secondary shocks at\nwhich additional particle acceleration takes place. This may lead to the close\nto uniform distribution of relativistic particles inside the remnant.

In this work we examine the\nenergetics of a well-resolved, three-dimensional, global magnetohydrodynamic\naccretion disk simulation by evaluating statistically-averaged mean-field\nequations for magnetic, kinetic, and internal energy using simulation data. The\nresults reveal that turbulent magnetic (kinetic) energy is primarily injected\nby the correlation between Maxwell (Reynolds) stresses and shear in the (almost\nKeplerian) mean flow, and removed by dissipation. This finding differs from\nprevious work using local (shearing-box) models, which indicated that turbulent\nkinetic energy was primarily sourced from the magnetic energy reservoir.\nLorentz forces provide the bridge between the magnetic and kinetic energy\nreservoirs, converting ~ 1/5 of the total turbulent magnetic power input into\nturbulent kinetic energy. The turbulent energies (both magnetic and kinetic)\nare mainly driven by terms associated with the turbulent fields, with only a\nminor influence from mean magnetic fields.

While more and more\nmultiwave observations of magnetars are available, unfortunately, we see\naccumulating failed predictions of the traditional magnetar model. These\nchallenges urge rethinking of magnetar. Wind braking of magnetars is one of the\nalternative modelings. The release of magnetic energy may generate a particle\noutflow (i.e., particle wind), that results in both an anomalous X-ray\nluminosity and significantly high spindown rate. In this wind braking scenario,\nonly strong multipole field is necessary for a magnetar (a strong dipole field\nis no longer needed).

For SMBHB mergers, the memory is created\nprimarily during the most violent moments of the inspiral immediately preceding\nthe final plunge and ring-down when the strongest gravitational fields are at\nwork and the non-linearities of general relativity are most pronounced.

The X-ray light curve of Sw J1644+57 from 5-30 days\npresents two kinds of quasi-periodic variations: a 200 second quasi-periodic\noscillation (QPO) and a 2.7-day quasi-periodic variation.

We find that the fastest\ngrowing linear MRI structures on both local and global domains can look very\ndifferent to the eigenmodes, invariably resembling waves shearing with the\nbackground flow (shear waves).

Recent neutrino data have, however,\nstarted to constrain this possibility in the simplest models with only one\nemission zone. In the classical theory of gamma-ray bursts, it is expected that\nparticles are accelerated at mildly relativistic shocks generated by the\ncollisions of material ejected from a central engine. We consider neutrino and\ncosmic-ray emission from multiple emission regions since these internal\ncollisions must occur at very different radii, from below the photosphere all\nthe way out to the circumburst medium, as a consequence of the efficient\ndissipation of kinetic energy.

The PeV-energy\nneutrino flux observed by IceCube gives strong bounds on the\nphotomeson-production optical depth of protons in their sources and the\nintensity of the proton component of extragalactic cosmic rays. The neutrino\nflux implies that extragalactic cosmic-ray sources should have the optical\ndepth greater than $\\sim 0.01$ and contribute to more than a few percent of the\nobserved bulk of cosmic rays at 10 PeV. If the spectrum of cosmic rays from\nthese extragalactic sources extends well beyond 1 EeV, the neutrino flux\nindicates that extragalactic cosmic rays are dominant in the observed total\ncosmic-ray flux at 1 EeV and above, favoring the dip transition model of cosmic\nrays. The cosmic-ray sources are also required to be efficient neutrino\nemitters with the optical depth close to unity in this case.

Abstract: Measurements of the cosmic ray antiproton spectrum can be used to search for\ncontributions from annihilating dark matter and to constrain the dark matter\nannihilation cross section.

We\nrevisit this topic, utilizing a set of propagation models fit to the cosmic ray\nboron, carbon, oxygen and beryllium data. We derive upper limits on the dark\nmatter annihilation cross section and find that when the cosmic ray propagation\nparameters are treated as nuisance parameters (as we argue is appropriate), the\nresulting limits are significantly less stringent than have been previously\nreported. We also note (as have several previous groups) that simple\nGALPROP-like diffusion-reacceleration models predict a spectrum of cosmic ray\nantiprotons that is in good agreement with PAMELA's observations above ~5 GeV,\nbut that significantly underpredict the flux at lower energies. Although the\ncomplexity of modeling cosmic ray propagation at GeV-scale energies makes it\ndifficult to determine the origin of this discrepancy, we consider the\npossibility that the excess antiprotons are the result of annihilating dark\nmatter.

Although the synchrotron self-Compton model has been very successful in\nexplaining the spectral energy distribution and spectral variability of these\nsources, it has not been able to describe these atypical flaring events.

The jet power we find is $(v/2M)^2 \\Phi^2/(4\\pi)$, where $v$ is the\nhole's velocity, $M$ is its mass, and $\\Phi$ is the magnetic flux. We show that\nenergy extraction from boosted black holes is conceptually similar to energy\nextraction from spinning black holes. However, we highlight two key technical\ndifferences: in the boosted case, jet power is no longer defined with respect\nto a Killing vector, and the relevant notion of black hole mass is observer\ndependent. We derive a new version of the membrane paradigm in which the\nmembrane lives at infinity rather than the horizon and we show that this is\nuseful for interpreting jets from boosted black holes. Our jet power prediction\nand the assumptions behind it can be tested with future numerical simulations. \n\n"}

In the past several years, 3D numerical\nsimulations made it possible to compute pulsar spindown luminosity from first\nprinciples and revealed that oblique pulsar winds are more powerful than\naligned ones. However, what causes this enhanced power output of oblique\npulsars is not understood. In this work, using time-dependent 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and force-free simulations, we show that, contrary to\nthe standard paradigm, the open magnetic flux, which carries the energy away\nfrom the pulsar, is laterally non-uniform. We argue that this non-uniformity is\nthe primary reason for the increased luminosity of oblique pulsars. To\ndemonstrate this, we construct simple analytic descriptions of aligned and\northogonal pulsar winds and combine them to obtain an accurate 3D description\nof the pulsar wind for any obliquity. Our approach describes both the warped\nmagnetospheric current sheet and the smooth variation of pulsar wind properties\noutside of it. We find that generically the magnetospheric current sheet\nseparates plasmas that move at mildly relativistic velocities relative to each\nother. This suggests that the magnetospheric reconnection is a type of driven,\nrather than free, reconnection. The jump in magnetic field components across\nthe current sheet decreases with increasing obliquity, which could be a\nmechanism that reduces dissipation in near-orthogonal pulsars. Our analytical\ndescription of the pulsar wind can be used for constructing models of pulsar\ngamma-ray emission, pulsar wind nebulae, and magnetar-powered core-collapse\ngamma-ray bursts and supernovae. \n\n"}

We observed Sgr A* with four European stations of the Global Millimeter\nVery Long Baseline Interferometry Array (GMVA) at 86 GHz on 1 October 2013 when\nparts of G2 had already passed the pericenter. We searched for possible\ntransient asymmetric structure -- such as jets or winds from hot accretion\nflows -- around Sgr A* caused by accretion of material from G2. The\ninterferometric closure phases remained zero within errors during the\nobservation time.

The GW signals will be\nredshifted due to the cosmological expansion and we measure only the\n\"redshifted\" masses. By assuming a cosmology, it is possible to estimate the\ngravitational masses by inferring the redshift from the measured posterior of\nthe luminosity distance.

We assume emission is given by the general triaxial non-aligned model of\nJones, whose waveform under certain conditions reduces to that of a biaxial\nprecessing star, or a simple rigidly rotating triaxial aligned star. The\ntriaxial non-aligned and biaxial models can produce emission at both the star's\nrotation frequency ($f$) and $2f$, whilst the latter only emits at $2f$. We\nhave studied parameter estimation for signal models using both a set of\nphysical source parameters, and a set of waveform parameters that remove a\ndegeneracy. We have assessed the signal detection efficiency, and used Bayesian\nmodel selection to investigate how well we can distinguish between the three\nmodels. We found that for signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) $\\gtrsim 6$ there is no\nsignificant loss in efficiency if performing a search for a signal at $f$ and\n$2f$ when the source is only producing emission at $2f$. However, for sources\nwith emission at both $f$ and $2f$ signals could be missed by a search only at\n$2f$. We also find that for a triaxial aligned source, the correct model is\nalways favoured, but for a triaxial non-aligned source it can be hard to\ndistinguish between the triaxial non-aligned model and the biaxial model, even\nat high SNR. Finally, we apply the method to a selection of known pulsars using\ndata from the LIGO fifth science run. We give the first upper limits on\ngravitational wave amplitude at both $f$ and $2f$ and apply the model selection\ncriteria on real data. \n\n"}

It has been also argued that, in these conditions, the best candidate\nparticle acceleration mechanism is efficient reconnection of magnetic field\nlines, for which it is predicted that magnetic field and accelerated\nrelativistic electron energy densities are in equipartition.Through the\nmodeling of the jet non--thermal emission, we explore if equipartition is\nindeed possible in BL Lac objects, i.e. low-power blazars with weak or absent\nbroad emission lines.

As a consequence, the jet kinetic power largely exceeds the magnetic\npower.

However, since H2-rich regions\nhost significant star formation and numerous supernova remnants, the morphology\nof observed H2 gas should also provide a physically motivated, high-resolution\ntracer for cosmic-ray injection.

In Graham & Fruchter (2013), we showed that LGRBs\nexhibit a strong and apparently intrinsic preference for low metallicity\nenvironments (12+log(O/H) < 8.4 in the KK04 scale) in spite of these three\ncases with abundances of about solar and above. These exceptions however are\nconsistent with the general star-forming galaxy population of comparable\nbrightness & redshift. This is surprising: even among a preselected sample of\nhigh metallicity LGRBs, were the metal aversion to remain in effect for these\nobjects, we would expect their metallicity to still be lower than the typical\nmetallicity for the galaxies at that luminosity and redshift. Therefore we\ndeduce that it is possible to form an LGRB in a high metallicity environment\nalthough with greater rarity.\n  From this we conclude that there are three possible explanations for the\npresence of the LGRBs observed in high metallicity hosts as seen to date: (1)\nLGRBs do not occur in high metallicity environments and those seen in high\nmetallicity hosts are in fact occurring in low metallicity environments that\nhave become associated with otherwise high metallicity hosts but remain\nunenriched. (2) The LGRB formation mechanism while preferring low metallicity\nenvironments does not strictly require it resulting in a gradual decline in\nburst formation with increasing metallicity.

We show that this result is strongly dependent on the vertical\naspect ratio of the computational domain $L_z/L_x$. When $L_z/L_x\\lesssim 1$,\nwe recover previous results. However, when the vertical domain is extended\n$L_z/L_x \\gtrsim 2.5$, we find the saturation level of the stress is greatly\nincreased (giving a ratio of stress to pressure $\\alpha \\gtrsim 0.1$), and\nmoreover the results are independent of numerical resolution. Consistent with\nprevious results, we find that saturation of the MRI in this regime is\ncontrolled by a cyclic dynamo which generates patches of strong toroidal field\nthat switches sign on scales of $L_x$ in the vertical direction. We speculate\nthat when $L_z/L_x\\lesssim 1$, the dynamo is inhibited by the small size of the\nvertical domain, leading to the puzzling dependence of saturation amplitude on\nresolution. We show that previous toy models developed to explain the MRI\ndynamo are consistent with our results, and that the cyclic pattern of toroidal\nfields observed in stratified shearing box simulations (leading to the\nso-called butterfly diagram) may also be related. In tall boxes the saturation\namplitude is insensitive to whether or not explicit dissipation is included in\nthe calculations, at least for large magnetic Reynolds and Prandtl number.\nFinally, we show MRI turbulence in tall domains has a smaller critical\n$\\rm{Pm}_c$, and an extended lifetime compared to $L_z/L_x\\lesssim 1$ boxes. \n\n"}

Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we\ninvestigate particle and radiation beaming, finding a very different picture.\nInstead of having a relativistic average bulk motion with isotropic electron\nvelocity distribution in its rest frame, we find that the bulk motion of\nparticles in X-points is similar to their Lorentz factor gamma, and the\nparticles are beamed within about 5/gamma. On the way from the X-point to the\nmagnetic islands, particles turn in the magnetic field, forming a fan confined\nto the current sheet. Once they reach the islands they isotropise after\ncompleting a full Larmor gyration and their radiation is not strongly beamed\nanymore.

GBM observations at the time of\nthe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) event GW150914\nreveal the presence of a weak transient above 50 keV, 0.4~s after the GW event,\nwith a false alarm probability of 0.0022 (2.9$\\sigma$).

In an\nextension of our previous work Roy et al., [Phys. Lett. B 750, 45 (2015)], we\nconsider the fluid to have a non-zero magnetization. First, we assume a\nconstant magnetic susceptibility $\\chi_{m}$ and consider an ultrarelativistic\nideal gas equation of state. For a paramagnetic fluid (i.e., with\n$\\chi_{m}>0$), the decay of the energy density slows down since the fluid gains\nenergy from the magnetic field. For a diamagnetic fluid (i.e., with\n$\\chi_{m}<0$), the energy density decays faster because it feeds energy into\nthe magnetic field. Furthermore, when the magnetic field is taken to be\nexternal and to decay in proper time $\\tau$ with a power law $\\sim\\tau^{-a}$,\ntwo distinct solutions can be found depending on the values of $a$ and\n$\\chi_m$. Finally, we also solve the ideal magnetohydrodynamical equations for\none-dimensional Bjorken flow with a temperature-dependent magnetic\nsusceptibility and a realistic equation of state given by lattice-QCD data. We\nfind that the temperature and energy density decay more slowly because of the\nnon-vanishing magnetization.

Only for magnetic\nfields which are about an order of magnitude larger than expected for heavy-ion\ncollisions, the system is substantially reheated and the lifetime of the quark\nphase might be extended. \n\n"}

Two main models have been proposed to explain this\nphase, relativistic wind bubbles (RWBs) and structured ejecta, which could\noriginate from millisecond magnetars and rapidly-rotating black holes,\nrespectively.

We\nconfirm this expectation and explicitly construct examples of such Kerr black\nholes with Proca hair (KBHsPH). For a single complex Proca field, these BHs\nform a countable number of families with three continuous parameters (ADM mass,\nADM angular momentum and Noether charge).

Supressing the\nfast variability requires an intervening structure preventing the hard X-rays\nfrom illuminating the disc. We propose this is the disc itself, perhaps due to\natomic processes in the UV lifting the photosphere, increasing the\nscale-height, making it less dense and less able to thermalise, so that it\nradiates low temperature Comptonised emission as required to produce the soft\nX-ray excess.

The transient shows\nsignificant polarization at both the observed epochs: one 24 days before\nmaximum light in the rest-frame, and the subsequent at 27 days after peak\nluminosity. Analysis of the Q-U plane suggests the presence of a dominant axis\nand no physical departure from the main axis at either epoch. The polarization\nspectrum along the dominant axis is characterized by a strong wavelength\ndependence and an increase in the signal from the first to the second epoch. We\nuse a Monte Carlo code to demonstrate that these properties are consistent with\na simple toy model that adopts an axi-symmetric ellipsoidal configuration for\nthe ejecta. We find that the wavelength dependence of the polarisation is\npossibly due to a strong wavelength dependence in the line opacity, while the\nhigher level of polarisation at the second epoch is a consequence of the\nincrease in the asphericity of the inner layers of the ejecta or the fact that\nthe photosphere recedes into less spherical layers.

The neutrino energy relevant to the neutrino-nucleus\nreactions spans a broad range and, accordingly, the dominant reaction mechanism\nvaries across the energy region from quasi-elastic scattering through nucleon\nresonance excitations to deep inelastic scattering. This corresponds to\ntransitions of the effective degree of freedom for theoretical description from\nnucleons through meson-baryon to quarks. The main purpose of this review is to\nreport our recent efforts towards a unified description of the neutrino-nucleus\nreactions over the wide energy range; recent overall progress in the field is\nalso sketched. Starting with an overview of the current status of\nneutrino-nucleus scattering experiments, we formulate the cross section to be\ncommonly used for the reactions over all the energy regions. A description of\nthe neutrino-nucleon reactions follows and, in particular, a dynamical\ncoupled-channels model for meson productions in and beyond the $\\Delta$(1232)\nregion is discussed in detail.

Our results show\nthat for some DMEOSs, the mass-radius relations are in agreement with new\nobservations, e.g. EXO 1745-248, 4U 1608-52, and 4U 1820-30, which are\ninconsistent with the normal neutron stars. We conclude that both DMEOSs and\ncentral pressure ratios of DM to NM affect the slope of the mass-radius\nrelation of DMANSs. This is because of the interaction between DM and NM, which\nleads to gravitationally or self-bound DMANSs. We study the radius of the NM\nsphere as well as the radius of the DM halo for different DMANSs. The results\nconfirm that, in some cases, a NM sphere with a small radius is surrounded by a\nhalo of DM with a larger radius. Our calculations verify that, due to the\ndifferent degrees of DM domination in DMANSs, with a value of the visible\nradius of a star two possible DMANSs with different masses can be exist. The\ngravitational redshift is also calculated for DMANSs with different DMEOSs and\ncentral pressure ratios.

Recently a\nseries of investigations on SNe Ic-BL with the magnetar (plus 56Ni) model were\ncarried out. Evidence for magnetar formation was found for the well-observed\nSNe Ic-BL 1998bw and 2002ap.

We find that the magnetar+56Ni\nmodel provides a good description of the light curves and velocity evolution of\nour sample of SNe Ic-BL, although some SNe (not all) can also be described by\nthe pure-magnetar model or by the two-component pure-56Ni model (3 out of 12\nare unlikely explained by two-component model). In the magnetar+56Ni model, the\namount of 56Ni required to explain their luminosity is significantly reduced,\nand the derived initial explosion energy is, in general, in accordance with\nneutrino heating.

With a CRHWP, single detectors can measure\nthree of the Stokes parameters, $I$, $Q$ and $U$, thereby avoiding the set of\nsystematic errors that can be introduced by mismatches in the properties of\northogonal detector pairs. We focus on the implementation of CRHWPs in large\naperture telescopes (i.e. the primary mirror is larger than the current maximum\nhalf-wave plate diameter of $\\sim$0.5 m), where the CRHWP can be placed between\nthe primary mirror and focal plane. In this configuration, one needs to address\nthe intensity to polarization ($I{\\rightarrow}P$) leakage of the optics, which\nbecomes a source of 1/f noise and also causes differential gain systematics\nthat arise from CMB temperature fluctuations. In this paper, we present the\nperformance of a CRHWP installed in the POLARBEAR experiment, which employs a\nGregorian telescope with a 2.5 m primary illumination pattern. The CRHWP is\nplaced near the prime focus between the primary and secondary mirrors.

We demonstrate,\nhowever, that by subtracting the leakage correlated with the intensity signal,\nthe 1/f noise knee frequency is reduced to 32 mHz ($\\ell \\sim$39 for our scan\nstrategy), which is very promising to probe the primordial B-mode signal.

We argue\nthat these observations, along with a substantial population of other extended\nTeV sources coincident with pulsar wind nebulae, constitute a new morphological\nclass of spatially extended TeV halos. We show that HAWCs wide field-of-view\nunlocks an expansive parameter space of TeV halos not observable by atmospheric\nCherenkov telescopes. Under the assumption that Geminga and Monogem are typical\nmiddle-aged pulsars, we show that ten-year HAWC observations should eventually\nobserve 37$^{+17}_{-13}$ middle-aged TeV halos that correspond to pulsars whose\nradio emission is not beamed towards Earth.

The resulting radiation could potentially be detected\nby the James Webb Space Telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope, or the European\nExtremely Large Telescope. This mechanism also produces optical emission from\nneutron stars in the galactic bulge, and X-ray emission near the galactic\ncenter, because dark matter is denser in these regions. For GeV - PeV mass dark\nmatter, dark kinetic heating would initially unmask any spin-independent or\nspin-dependent dark matter-nucleon cross-sections exceeding $2 \\times 10^{-45}$\ncm$^2$, with improved sensitivity after more telescope exposure. For\nlighter-than-GeV dark matter, cross-section sensitivity scales inversely with\ndark matter mass because of Pauli blocking; for heavier-than-PeV dark matter,\nit scales linearly with mass as a result of needing multiple scatters for\ncapture.

The stellar evolution was computed using\nthe STELLAR evolution code developed by Yorke & Bodenheimer with recent\nmodifications by Hosokawa et al.

The disagreement between accreting and\nnon-accreting models in terms of the total stellar luminosity L_st, stellar\nradius R_st and effective temperature T_eff depends on the thermal efficiency\nof accretion, i.e., on the fraction of accretion energy absorbed by the central\nobject.

Our detection rate and the\nmaximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable to previous surveys,\nall made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating\ncircular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose\nthat the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength\nsample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly\npolarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.\nCircular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or\nshorter than our median sampling interval <1 month.

This is because thermal radiation is normally observed in the\nsoft X-ray band, and it is thought to be linearly polarized because of\ndifferent opacities for two polarization modes of photons in the magnetized\natmosphere of neutron stars and the dielectric properties of the vacuum in\nstrong magnetic fields.

Shocks occurring below the jet photosphere are\nmediated by radiation. It was previously found that radiation mediated shocks\n(RMSs) inside GRB jets are inefficient photon producers, and the photons that\nmediate the RMS must originate from an earlier stage of the explosion. We show\nthat this conclusion is valid only for non-magnetized jets. RMSs that propagate\nin moderately magnetized plasma develop a collisionless subshock which locally\nheats the plasma to a relativistic temperature, and the hot electrons emit\ncopious synchrotron photons inside the RMS. We find that this mechanism is\ngenerally effective for mildly relativistic shocks and may be the main source\nof photons observed in GRBs. We derive a simple analytical formula for the\ngenerated photon number per proton, $Z$, which gives $Z=10^5$-$10^6$,\nconsistent with observations. The photons are initially injected with low\nenergies, well below the observed GRB peak. Their number is controlled by two\nmain factors: (1) the abundance of electron-positron pairs created in the\nshock, which is self-consistently calculated, and (2) the upper limit on the\nbrightness temperature of soft radiation set by induced downscattering.

We propose\nthat the formation of the dissipative structures in the jet is controlled by\nthe time variability of the accretion disc. We argue that the open magnetic\nfield lines through the black hole, which drive a strongly magnetized jet, may\nhave their polarity reversing over time-scales related to the growth of the\nmagneto-rotational dynamo in the disc. Consequently, the jet is characterized\nby an alternating toroidal field polarity along its propagation axis, i.e., it\nis a \"striped jet\". Magnetic reconnection in the current sheets that form\nbetween the stripes dissipates the alternating-field energy and thus powers\nfurther jet acceleration. Here, we consider a jet with a broad distribution of\nstripe widths $l>l_{\\rm min}$, above a dominant scale $l_{\\rm min}$. We find\nthat the bulk acceleration of the jet, driven by the annihilation of the\nstripes, is very gradual.

This wind is discovered in a deep Suzaku\nobservation that was performed in 2010. Overall the X-ray spectrum of\nMCG-03-58-007 is highly absorbed by a neutral column density of NH~10^23 cm^-2,\nin agreement with the optical classification as a type 2 AGN. In addition, this\nobservation unveiled the presence of two deep absorption troughs at E = 7.4 +-\n0.1 keV and E = 8.5 +- 0.2 keV. If associated with blue-shifted FeXXVI, these\nfeatures can be explained with the presence of two highly ionised (log \\xi/(erg\ncm/s)~ 5.5) and high column density (NH~5-8 x 10^23cm^-2) outflowing absorbers\nwith v_out1~ -0.1c and v_out2~ -0.2c. The disk wind detected during this\nobservation is most likely launched from within a few hundreds gravitational\nradii from the central black and has a kinetic output that matches the\nprescription for significant feedback. The presence of the lower velocity\ncomponent of the disk wind is independently confirmed by the analysis of a\nfollow-up XMM-Newton & NuSTAR observation.

No model currently explains this\nsuppression. We show that cosmic-ray self-confinement can significantly inhibit\ndiffusion near pulsars. The steep cosmic-ray gradient generates Alfven waves\nthat resonantly scatter the same cosmic-ray population, suppressing diffusion\nwithin ~20 pc of pulsars younger than ~100 kyr. In this model, TeV halos evolve\nthrough two phases, a growth phase where Alfven waves are resonantly generated\nand cosmic-ray diffusion becomes increasingly suppressed, and a subsequent\nrelaxation phase where the diffusion coefficient returns to the standard\ninterstellar value. Intriguingly, cosmic-rays are not strongly confined early\nin the TeV halo evolution, allowing a significant fraction of injected e+e- to\nescape.

Most TDEs and candidates discovered in the optical/UV\nhave broad optical emission lines with complex and diverse profiles of puzzling\norigin.

While commonly\nattributed to the breakout of a supernova shock into a dense wind, the great\ndistances to the transients of this class found so far have hampered detailed\ninvestigation of their properties. We present photometry and spectroscopy from\na comprehensive worldwide campaign to observe AT2018cow (ATLAS18qqn), the first\nfast-luminous optical transient to be found in real time at low redshift. Our\nfirst spectra (<2 days after discovery) are entirely featureless. A very broad\nabsorption feature suggestive of near-relativistic velocities develops between\n3-8 days, then disappears. Broad emission features of H and He develop after\n>10 days. The spectrum remains extremely hot throughout its evolution, and the\nphotospheric radius contracts with time (receding below R<10^14 cm after 1\nmonth). This behaviour does not match that of any known supernova, although a\nrelativistic jet within a fallback supernova could explain some of the observed\nfeatures.

These have been routinely detected in radio\nimages, and components associated with a circumbinary disk have also been\nsuggested in optical emission lines. We wish to spatially resolve the regions\nproducing the stationary emission lines of SS 433 to shed light on its\ncircumbinary structure and outflows.

We use the\noptical interferometer VLTI+GRAVITY to spatially resolve SS 433 in the\nnear-infrared K band at high spectral resolution ($R\\approx 4000$) on three\nnights in July 2017. The stationary Br$\\gamma$ line is clearly dominated by an\nextended $\\sim 1 \\text{ mas} \\sim 5 \\text{ AU}$ circumbinary structure\nperpendicular to the jets and with a strong rotation component. The rotation\ndirection is retrograde relative to the jet precession, in accordance with the\nslaved disk precession model.

We identify all plausible Roche-lobe overflowing binaries\nat the start of mass transfer, and compare our theoretical mass transfer tracks\nto the population of well-studied Milky Way LMXBs. The mass transferring\nevolution depends on the accepted magnetic braking (MB) law for angular\nmomentum loss. The most common MB prescription (\"Skumanich MB\") originated from\nobservations of the time-dependence of rotational braking of Sun-type stars,\nwhere the angular momentum loss rate depends on the donor mass $M_d$, donor\nradius $R_d$, and rotation rate $\\Omega$, $\\dot{J} \\propto M_d R_d^{\\gamma}\n\\Omega^3$. The functional form of the Skumanich MB can be also obtained\ntheoretically assuming a radial magnetic field, isotropic isothermal winds, and\nboosting of the magnetic field by rotation.

In the analysis, we consider\nrealistic conditions inside supernovae and discuss both the Dirac and Majorana\ncases.

The dependence of the\naccretion mode on the rate and manner of the mass supply beyond the black hole\nsphere of influence is also discussed. It is argued that hydromagnetic outflows\nfrom accretion disks are generally expected over as many as six decades of\nradius and that they may be the source of emission line gas. These outflows\ncollimate the relativistic jets which are probably generated in an\nelectromagnetic form but become hydromagnetic as they entrain gas through\nboundary layers where most of the initial nonthermal emission occurs. It is\nproposed that the particle acceleration close to the hole emphasizes the proton\nchannel which allows secondary pairs to be created at far higher energies than\nis possible from direct acceleration. These pairs radiate synchrotron\ngamma-rays which can escape along the jet because the outflow effectively\nshields them from pair-producing, soft photons. Jets are subject to helical\ninstabilities which can tangle their magnetic field and may destroy them. The\njet should become plasma-dominated through intermittent, \"magnetoluminescent\"\nuntangling of the field which causes nonthermal emission all along its length.\nPowerful jets remain supersonic out to the \"hot spots\" at the extremities of\nthe source; weaker jets become subsonic plumes or bubbles.

The debris of a star whose initial spin is parallel to the orbital\nangular momentum has a mass distribution which extends to lower energy than\nthat of non-rotating star.

This is well consistent with the scenario\nthat super-Eddington accretion onto compact objects will power optically-thick\noutflows and indicates an accretion rate 60-80 times the critical value. This\nsuggests that super-Eddington accretion onto magnetized systems can also power\nmassive winds. At super-Eddington levels, the iron line becomes more\nsignificant and blueshifted, and is argued to be associated with the ultrafast\nwind in the central funnel or jets. This source, if located in external\ngalaxies, will appear like other ultraluminous pulsars. \n\n"}

We\nfollow the Two-Component Advective Flow (TCAF) paradigm for black holes, and\nfocus only on the advective component for the case of a neutron star. This low\nviscosity sub-Keplerian flow will create a normal boundary layer (or, NBOL)\nright on the star surface in addition to the centrifugal pressure supported\nboundary layer (or, CENBOL) present in a black hole accretion. These density\njumps could give rise to standing or oscillating shock fronts. During a hard\nspectral state, the incoming flow has a negligible viscosity causing more\nsub-Keplerian component as compared to the Keplerian disc component. We show\nthat our simulation of flows with a cooling and a negligible viscosity produces\nprecisely two shocks and strong supersonic winds from these boundary layers. We\nfind that the specific angular momentum of matter dictates the locations and\nthe nature of oscillations of these shocks. For low angular momentum flows, the\nradial oscillation appears to be preferred. For flows with higher angular\nmomentum, the vertical oscillation appears to become dominant. In all the\ncases, asymmetries w.r.t. the Z=0 plane are seen and instabilities set in due\nto the interaction of inflow and outgoing strong winds. Our results capture\nboth the low and high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations without invoking\nmagnetic fields or any precession mechanism. Most importantly, these solutions\ndirectly corroborate observed features of wind dominated high-mass X-ray\nbinaries, such as Cir X-1. \n\n"}

Most of these\nsources are extragalactic (e.g., blazars), while among the galactic ones there\nare pulsars and SN remnants.
