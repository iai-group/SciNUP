Performing such a transport along the null\ngeodesic of photons arriving from the galaxy, they found that the cosmological\nredshift is purely kinematic. Here we argue that one should rather transport\nthe velocity four-vector along the geodesic connecting the points of\nintersection of the world-lines of the galaxy and the observer with the\nhypersurface of constant cosmic time. We find that the resulting relation\nbetween the transported velocity and the redshift of arriving photons is not\ngiven by a relativistic Doppler formula. Instead, for small redshifts it\ncoincides with the well known non-relativistic decomposition of the redshift\ninto a Doppler (kinematic) component and a gravitational one. We perform such a\ndecomposition for arbitrary large redshifts and derive a formula for the\nkinematic component of the cosmological redshift, valid for any FLRW cosmology.\nIn particular, in a universe with Omega_m = 0.24 and Omega_Lambda = 0.76, a\nquasar at a redshift 6, at the time of emission of photons reaching us today\nhad the recession velocity v = 0.997c.

Thus, for recession velocities of\nsuch high-redshift sources, the effect of deceleration of the early Universe\nclearly prevails over the effect of its relatively recent acceleration. Last\nbut not least, we show that the so-called proper recession velocities of\ngalaxies, commonly used in cosmology, are in fact radial components of the\ngalaxies' four-velocity vectors.

A time-averaged energy spectrum is measured from 200 GeV\nto 2 TeV and is characterized by a power law (photon index of Gamma = 3.06 +-\n0.15 {stat} +- 0.10 {syst}).

We focus on\ncompact binaries whose total mass exceeds the maximum mass that a cold\ndegenerate star can support, and our goal is to determine the fate of such\nsystems. A fully general relativistic hydrodynamic computation of a realistic\nWDNS head-on collision is prohibitive due to the large range of dynamical time\nscales and length scales involved. For this reason, we construct an equation of\nstate (EOS) which captures the main physical features of NSs while, at the same\ntime, scales down the size of WDs. We call these scaled-down WD models\n\"pseudo-WDs (pWDs)\". Using pWDs, we can study these systems via a sequence of\nsimulations where the size of the pWD gradually increases toward the realistic\ncase. We perform two sets of simulations; One set studies the effects of the NS\nmass on the final outcome, when the pWD is kept fixed. The other set studies\nthe effect of the pWD compaction on the final outcome, when the pWD mass and\nthe NS are kept fixed.

We develop the computational method based on that of\nBombelli et al to obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$ of scalar fields whose\nLagrangian is quadratic with respect to the scalar fields. First we study $S_C$\nin $d+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In this case the state of the\nmassless free scalar field is the Minkowski vacuum state and we replace two\nblack holes by two imaginary spheres, and we take the trace over the degrees of\nfreedom residing in the imaginary spheres.

We will show that electrons in the atomic\nshells are stripped during the acceleration process, when the atoms already\nmove relativistically. For typical environment around SNRs the dominant\nionization process is the photo-ionization due to the background galactic\nradiation. The ionization has two interesting consequences.

It is found that\nrapid rotation is not enough to suppress the Parker instability, and this\nfinding does not agree with the perturbation analysis. The reason for this is\nthat rigidly and rapidly rotating stars are marginally stable, and hence, in\nthe presence of stellar pulsations by which the rotational profile is deformed,\nunstable regions with negative gradient of angular momentum profile is\ndeveloped. After the onset of the instabilities, a turbulence is excited.\nContrary to the axisymmetric case, the magnetic fields never reach an\nequilibrium state after the development of the turbulence. This conclusion\nsuggests that three-dimensional simulation is indispensable for exploring the\nformation of magnetars or prominence activities of magnetars such as giant\nflares. \n\n"}

The classical theory is distinguishable from\ngeneral relativity only in the presence of relativistic pressure (or\nvorticity). Since the interior of neutron stars has high pressure and as their\nmass and radius can be measured observationally, they are the perfect\nlaboratory for testing the validity of the aether theory. In this paper, we\nsolve the equations of stellar structure for the gravitational aether theory\nand find the predicted mass-radius relation of non-rotating neutron stars using\ntwo different realistic proposals for the equation of state of nuclear matter.\nWe find that the maximum neutron star mass predicted by the aether theory is\n12% - 16% less than the maximum mass predicted by general relativity assuming\nthese two equations of state. We also show that the effect of aether is similar\nto modifying the equation of state in general relativity. The effective\npressure of the neutron star given by the aether theory at a fiducial density\ndiffers from the values given by the two nuclear equations of state to an\nextent that can be constrained using future gravitational wave observations of\nneutron stars in compact systems.

The AD produces\nthe ionizing continuum which powers the broad and narrow emission lines. The\nmaximum AD effective temperature is given by Teff=fmax(Mdot/M^2)^1/4, where M\nis the black hole mass, Mdot the accretion rate, and fmax is set by the black\nhole spin a_*. For a low enough value of Mdot/M^2 the AD may become too cold to\nproduce ionizing photons. Such an object will form a lineless quasar. This\noccurs for a local blackbody (BB) AD with a luminosity Lopt=10^46 erg/s for\nM>3.6E9 Msun, when a_*=0, and for M>1.4E10 Msun, when a_*=0.998. Using the AD\nbased Mdot, derived from M and Lopt, and the reverberation based M, derived\nfrom Lopt and the Hbeta FWHM, v, gives Teff \\propto Lopt^-0.13v^-1.45. Thus,\nTeff is mostly set by v. Quasars with a local BB AD become lineless for v>\n8,000 km/s, when a_*=0, and for v> 16,000 km/s, when a_*=0.998. Higher values\nof v are required if the AD is hotter than a local BB. The AD becoming\nnon-ionizing may explain why line emitting quasars with v>10,000 km/s are rare.\nWeak low ionization lines may still be present if the X-ray continuum is\nluminous enough, and such objects may form a population of weak emission line\nquasars (WLQ).

Of the nine high-significance, high-latitude (|b|>60 degrees),\nnon-variable, unidentified sources contained in this catalog, only one or two\nare compatible with the spectrum of a dark matter particle heavier than\napproximately 50-100 GeV.

This population is consistent with the number of\nobservable subhalos predicted for a dark matter candidate in this mass range\nand with an annihilation cross section of a simple thermal relic (sigma\nv~3x10^{-26} cm^3/s). Observations in the direction of these sources at other\nwavelengths will be necessary to either reveal their astrophysical nature (as\nblazars or other active galactic nuclei, for example), or to further support\nthe possibility that they are dark matter subhalos by failing to detect any\nnon-gamma ray counterpart. \n\n"}

In this work we employ high\nresolution cosmological hydro-dynamical simulations to study the effects of\ndissipative processes on the inner distribution of dark matter in Milky-Way\nlike objects (M~1e12 Msun). Our simulations include supernova feedback, and the\neffects of the radiation pressure of massive stars before they explode as\nsupernovae. The increased stellar feedback results in the expansion of the dark\nmatter halo instead of contraction with respect to N-body simulations.

Theoretically, there exist\nnumerous inflationary scenarios which predict large and characteristic\nnon-Gaussianities in the primordial perturbations. These model-dependent\nnon-Gaussianities act as sources of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nbispectrum; therefore, the analysis of the CMB bispectrum is very important and\nattractive in order to clarify the nature of the early Universe. Currently, the\nimpacts of the primordial non-Gaussianities in the scalar perturbations, where\nthe rotational and parity invariances are kept, on the CMB bispectrum have been\nwell-studied. However, for a complex treatment, the CMB bispectra generated\nfrom the non-Gaussianities, which originate from the vector- and tensor-mode\nperturbations and include the violation of the rotational or parity invariance,\nhave never been considered in spite of the importance of this information. On\nthe basis of our current studies, this thesis provides the general formalism\nfor the CMB bispectrum sourced by the non-Gaussianities not only in the\nscalar-mode perturbations but also in the vector- and tensor-mode\nperturbations. Applying this formalism, we calculate the CMB bispectrum from\ntwo scalars and a graviton correlation and that from primordial magnetic\nfields, and we then outline new constraints on these amplitudes. Furthermore,\nthis formalism can be easily extended to the cases where the rotational or\nparity invariance is broken.

The templates map the waveform shapes to physical\nparameters, thus allowing us to produce posterior probability distributions for\nthese parameters. However, there are attendant dangers in using highly\nrestrictive signal priors. If strong field gravity is not accurately described\nby General Relativity (GR), then using GR templates may result in fundamental\nbias in the recovered parameters, or even worse, a complete failure to detect\nsignals.

First, we show that there exist modified theories compatible\nwith all existing tests that would fail to be detected by the LIGO/Virgo\nnetwork using searches based on GR templates, but which would be detected using\na one parameter post-Einsteinian extension. Second, we study modified theories\nthat produce departures from GR that turn on suddenly at a critical frequency,\nproducing waveforms that do not naively fit into the simplest parameterized\npost-Einsteinian (ppE) scheme.

We calculate the\ndramatic enhancement to the gamma ray flux from the Galactic center (GC) from\nsuch a spike if the 1-3 GeV excess observed in Fermi data is due to DM\nannihilations. We find that for the parameter values favored in recent fits,\nthe point source-like flux from the spike is 35 times greater than the flux\nfrom the inner $1^\\circ$ of the halo, far exceeding all Fermi point source\ndetections near the GC.

This last contribution is going to be characterised by the\nLISA Pathfinder mission, a technology precursor of future space-borne detectors\nlike eLISA.

A post-Friedmann approach shows\nthat the leading order correction to Newtonian theory is a vector potential in\nthe metric. This vector potential can be calculated from N-body simulations,\nrequiring a method for extracting the velocity field. Here, we present the full\ndetails of our calculation of the post-Friedmann vector potential, using the\nDelauney Tesselation Field Estimator (DTFE) code. We include a detailed\nexamination of the robustness of our numerical result, including the effects of\nbox size and mass resolution on the extracted fields.

Shocks\nnear the stellar pericenter and also near the apocenter of the most\ntightly-bound debris dissipate orbital energy, but only enough to make the\ncharacteristic radius comparable to the semi-major axis of the most-bound\nmaterial, not the tidal radius as previously thought. The outer shocks are\ncaused by post-Newtonian effects, both on the stellar orbit during its\ndisruption and on the tidal forces. Accumulation of mass into the accretion\nflow is non-monotonic and slow, requiring ~3--10x the orbital period of the\nmost tightly-bound tidal streams, while the inflow time for most of the mass\nmay be comparable to or longer than the mass accumulation time.

Such solutions have been proposed as exotic\nalternatives to the black-hole paradigm because they can be as compact as black\nholes and exist in any mass range. By constructing slowly-rotating, thin-shell\ngravastars to quadratic order in the spin, we compute the moment of inertia\n$I$, the mass quadrupole moment $Q$, and the tidal Love number $\\lambda$ in\nexact form. The $I$-$\\lambda$-$Q$ relations of a gravastar are dramatically\ndifferent from those of an ordinary compact star, but the black-hole limit is\ncontinuous, i.e. these quantities approach their Kerr counterparts when the\ncompactness is maximum. Therefore, such relations can be used to discern a\ngravastar from an ordinary compact star, but not to break the degeneracy with\nthe black-hole case.

Preliminary\nestimates, assuming a spin parameter $\\chi\\approx0.05$, show modifications\n$\\gtrsim10\\%$ relative to the static case, at an orbital distance of five\nstellar radii. Furthermore, the rotational Love numbers as functions of the\nmoment of inertia are much more sensitive to the equation of state than in the\nstatic case, where approximate universal relations at the percent level exist.\nFor a neutron-star binary approaching the merger, we estimate that the\napproximate universality of the induced mass quadrupole moment deteriorates\nfrom $1\\%$ in the static case to roughly $6\\%$ when $\\chi\\approx0.05$. Our\nresults suggest that spin-tidal couplings can introduce important corrections\nto the gravitational waveforms of spinning neutron-star binaries approaching\nthe merger. \n\n"}

Much effort has gone into\ncomputing \"self force\" corrections to this motion, arising from the small\nbody's own contributions to the system's spacetime. Another correction to the\nmotion arises from coupling of the small body's spin to the black hole's\nspacetime curvature. Spin-curvature coupling drives a precession of the small\nbody, and introduces a \"force\" (relative to the geodesic) which shifts the\nsmall body's worldline. These effects scale with the small body's spin at\nleading order. In this paper, we show that the equations which govern\nspin-curvature coupling can be analyzed with a frequency-domain decomposition,\nat least to leading order in the small body's spin.

We aim at computing accurately the complete reprocessed spectrum\n(thermal bump + reflected) of black-hole binaries over the entire X-ray band.\nWe also determine the strength of the direct component.

We also deduce the exact\nLense-Thirring (LT) precession frequency of a test gyroscope moving toward a\nrotating traversable Teo wormhole. The precession frequency diverges on the\nergoregion, a behavior intimately related to and governed by the geometry of\nthe ergoregion, analogous to the situation in a Kerr spacetime. Interestingly,\nit turns out that here the LT precession is inversely proportional to the\nangular momentum ($a$) of the wormhole along the pole and around it in the\nstrong gravity regime, a behavior contrasting with its direct variation with\n$a$ in the case of other compact objects. In fact, divergence of LT precession\ninside the ergoregion can also be avoided if the gyro moves with a non-zero\nangular velocity in a certain range. As a result, the spin precession frequency\nof the gyro can be made finite throughout its whole path, even very close to\nthe throat, during its travel to the wormhole.

Furthermore, observations of fast radio\nbursts (FRBs) have similarly resulted in a range of new models that might endow\nblack hole binaries with electromagnetic signatures. In this context, even the\nunlikely idea that astrophysical black holes may have significant charge is\nworth exploring, and here we present results from the simulation of weakly\ncharged black holes as they orbit and merge. Our simulations suggest that a\nblack hole binary with mass comparable to that observed in GW150914 could\nproduce the level of electromagnetic luminosity observed by Fermi GBM\n($10^{49}$ ergs/s) with a non-dimensional charge of $q \\equiv Q/M = 10^{-4}$\nassuming good radiative efficiency.

Space-based detectors will observe\nlong-lived sources that persist while the detector moves relative to their\nlocation on the sky, using Doppler shifts of the signal to locate the sky\nposition. While these methods improve the pointing capability of a detector or\nnetwork, the angular resolution is still coarse compared to the standards one\nexpects from electromagnetic astronomy. Another technique that can be used for\nsky localization is null-stream pointing. In the case where multiple\nindependent data streams exist, a single astrophysical source of gravitational\nwaves will appear in each of the data streams.

These \"I-Love-Q\"\nrelations have important implications for astrophysics and gravitational-wave\nastronomy. An interesting problem is whether similar relations hold for other\ncompact objects and how they approach the black-hole limit. To answer these\nquestions, here we investigate the deformation properties of a large class of\nthin-shell gravastars, which are exotic compact objects that do not possess an\nevent horizon nor a spacetime singularity. Working in a small-spin and\nsmall-tidal field expansion, we calculate the moment of inertia, the quadrupole\nmoment, and the (quadrupolar electric) tidal Love number of gravastars with a\npolytropic thin shell. The I-Love-Q relations of a thin-shell gravastar are\ndrastically different from those of an ordinary neutron star.

The\nsource has been observed using Swift and XMM-Newton. Its X-ray spectra were\ndominated by a thermal component. The thermal evolution showed a gradual X-ray\nluminosity decay from ~18 x 10^32 to ~4 x 10^32 (D/5.8 kpc)^2 erg s^{-1}\nbetween ~8 and ~379 d in quiescence, and the inferred neutron star surface\ntemperature (for an observer at infinity; using a neutron star atmosphere\nmodel) decreased from ~100 to ~71 eV. This can be interpreted as cooling of an\naccretion-heated neutron star crust. Modelling the observed temperature curve\n(using NSCOOL) indicated that the source required ~1.9 MeV per accreted nucleon\nof shallow heating in addition to the standard deep crustal heating to explain\nits thermal evolution. Alternatively, the decay could also be modelled without\nthe presence of deep crustal heating, only having a shallow heat source (again\n~1.9 MeV per accreted nucleon was required). However, the XMM-Newton data\nstatistically required an additional power-law component. This component\ncontributed ~30 per cent of the total unabsorbed flux in 0.5-10 keV energy\nrange. The physical origin of this component is unknown. One possibility is\nthat it arises from low-level accretion. The presence of this component in the\nspectrum complicates our cooling crust interpretation because it might indicate\nthat the smooth luminosity and temperature decay curves we observed may not be\ndue to crust cooling but due to some other process. \n\n"}

We restrict our attention to\nthe light rays which move on the plane midway between the two identical black\nholes, which allows us to employ techniques developed for the equatorial\nlensing in spherically symmetric spacetimes. If distance between the two black\nholes is below a certain threshold value, the system admits two photon spheres.\nAs in the case of single black hole, infinitely many relativistic images are\nformed due to the light rays which turn back from the region outside the outer\n(unstable) photon sphere, all of which lie beyond a critical angular radius\nwith respect to the lens. However in the presence of the inner (stable) photon\nsphere, the effective potential now increases again and the light rays that\nenter the outer photon sphere can turn back, leading to the formation of a new\nset of infinitely many relativistic images, all of which lie below the critical\nradius from the lens mentioned above. As the distance between the two black\nhole increases, two photon spheres approach each other, merge and eventually\ndisappear. In the absence of photon sphere, apart from the formation of a\nfinite number of discrete relativistic images, the system remarkably admits a\nradial caustic, which has never been observed in the context of relativistic\nlensing before. Thus the system of binary black hole admits novel features both\nin the presence and absence of photon spheres.

Including contemporary schemes for\nstellar wind and remnant-formation, such model clusters are evolved, for the\nfirst time, using the state-of-the-art direct N-body evolution program NBODY7,\nuntil their dissolution or at least for 10 Gyr. That way, a self-regulatory\nbehaviour in the effects of dynamical interactions among the BHs, especially\nwhile heating and expanding the cluster and self-depleting the BHs, is\ndemonstrated. The BBH mergers obtained here show a prominence in\ntriple-mediated mergers while being bound to the clusters, compared to those\noccurring among the BBHs that are dynamically ejected from the clusters. This\nis in contrast with earlier N-body computations and also with recent\nMonte-Carlo method based ones. A broader mass spectrum of BHs and ejection of\nBBHs generally of wider orbits and in lower numbers, for the cluster masses\nexplored here, might cause this which is yet to be fully understood.

A generic feature of these models is the replacement of the\nhorizon by a reflective surface.

First, applying Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques, we use the absence\nof dipolar radiation in the pulsar-timing observations of five binary systems\ncomposed of a NS and a white dwarf, and eleven equations of state (EOSs) for\nNSs, to derive the most stringent constraints on the two free parameters of the\nDEF scalar-tensor theory.

Then, we investigate if these scalarization windows could\nbe closed and if pulsar-timing constraints could be improved by\nlaser-interferometer GW detectors, when spontaneous (or dynamical)\nscalarization sets in during the early (or late) stages of a binary NS (BNS)\nevolution.

In particular, we prove\nthat the recently discovered cloudy Kerr black-hole spacetimes --\nnon-spherically symmetric non-static black holes which support linearized\nmassive scalar fields in their exterior regions -- also respect this no-short\nhair lower bound.

The Golden sample\nincludes 25 bursts mostly observed by GROND, and the Silver sample includes 45\nbursts observed by other telescopes. For the Golden sample, we find that 95\\%\nof the color indices do not vary over time. However, the color indices do vary\nduring short periods in most bursts. The observed variations are consistent\nwith effects of (i) the cooling frequency crossing the studied energy bands in\na wind medium (43\\%) and in a constant density medium (30\\%), (ii) early dust\nextinction (12\\%), (iii) transition from reverse shock to forward shock\nemission (5\\%), or (iv) an emergent supernova emission (10\\%).

This revises the\nreported BBH distances upwards by an order of magnitude, equal to the square\nroot of the magnification.

Notably, Planck cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) and the local Cepheid-supernovae distance ladder\nmeasurements determine $H_0$ with a precision of $\\sim 1\\%$ and $\\sim 2\\%$\nrespectively. A $3$-$\\sigma$ level of discrepancy exists between the two\nmeasurements, for reasons that have yet to be understood.

The first\njoint analysis of the GW signal from GW170817 and its EM localization led to a\nmeasurement of $H_0=74^{+16}_{-8}$ km/s/Mpc (median and symmetric $68\\%$\ncredible interval).

Abstract: Inspiraling and merging binary neutron stars (BNSs) are important sources of\nboth gravitational waves and coincident electromagnetic counterparts. If the\nBNS total mass is larger than a threshold value, a black hole ensues promptly\nafter merger. Through a statistical study in conjunction with recent LIGO/Virgo\nconstraints on the nuclear equation of state, we estimate that up to $\\sim\n25\\%$ of BNS mergers may result in prompt collapse. Moreover, we find that most\nmodels of the BNS mass function we study here predict that the majority of\nprompt-collapse BNS mergers have $q\\gtrsim 0.8$. Prompt-collapse BNS mergers\nwith mass ratio $q \\gtrsim 0.8$ may not be accompanied by detectable kilonovae\nor short gamma-ray bursts, because they unbind a negligible amount of mass and\nform negligibly small accretion disks onto the remnant black hole. We call such\nBNS mergers \"orphan\". However, recent studies have found that\n${10^{41-43}(B_p/10^{12}\\rm G)^2 erg\\, s^{-1}}$ electromagnetic signals can be\npowered by magnetospheric interactions several milliseconds prior to merger.\nMoreover, the energy stored in the magnetosphere of an orphan BNS merger\nremnant will be radiated away in ${\\mathcal O}(1\\ \\rm ms)$.

Nested sampling was\nmainly developed to calculate the marginal likelihood of a model but can\nproduce posterior samples as a by-product. Thermodynamic integration is\nemployed to calculate the evidence using samples generated by parallel\ntempering but has been found to be computationally demanding. Here we propose\nthe stepping-stone sampling algorithm, originally proposed by Xie et al.

The stepping-stone sampling algorithm is also based\non samples from the power posteriors of parallel tempering but has superior\nperformance as fewer temperature steps and thus computational resources are\nneeded to achieve the same accuracy.

I focus on the evolution of the apparent spin frequency, which is\ntypically associated with the motion of a specific point on the stellar surface\n(e.g., polar cap). I start from long-term evolution (on the timescale when\ninstability significantly changes the spin frequency). For this case, I reduce\nevolution equations to one differential equation and demonstrate that it can be\ndirectly derived from energy conservation law. This equation governs evolution\nrate through sequence of thermally equilibrium states and provides linear\ncoupling for the cooling power and rotation energy losses via gravitational\nwave emission. In particular, it shows that differential rotation do not affect\nlong-term spin-down. On the contrary, on the short timescales, differential\nrotation can significantly modify the apparent spin-down, if one examines a\nstrongly unstable star with very small initial amplitude of unstable mode. This\nstatement is confirmed by consideration of Newtonian non-magnetized perfect\nfluid and dissipative stellar models as well as magnetized stellar model. For\nexample, despite that widely applied evolution equations predict effective spin\nto be constant in absence of dissipation, the CFS-unstable star should be\nobserved as spinning-down. However, effects of differential rotation on\napparent spin-down are negligible for realistic models of neutron star\nrecycling, unless: (1) the neutron star is not magnetized, and (2) r-mode\namplitude is modulated faster than the shear viscosity dissipation timescale,\nbeing large enough that spin-down can be measured on modulation timescale. \n\n"}

If\nthese BBHs are the product of binary evolution, then PPISNe could occur in very\nclose binaries. Motivated by this, we discuss the implications of a PPISN\nhappening with a close binary companion, and what impact these events have on\nthe formation of merging BBHs through binary evolution.
