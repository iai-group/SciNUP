However, the light-cone average of the\ndensity as a function of redshift is affected by inhomogeneities. The effect\narises because, as the universe evolves, a photon spends more and more time in\nthe (large) voids than in the (thin) high-density structures. The\nphenomenological homogeneous model describing the light-cone average of the\ndensity is similar to the concordance model.

The LSST design is\ndriven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking\nan inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and\nmapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system sited at\nCerro Pach\\'{o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m\neffective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel\ncamera. The standard observing sequence will consist of pairs of 15-second\nexposures in a given field, with two such visits in each pointing in a given\nnight. With these repeats, the LSST system is capable of imaging about 10,000\nsquare degrees of sky in a single filter in three nights. The typical 5$\\sigma$\npoint-source depth in a single visit in $r$ will be $\\sim 24.5$ (AB). The\nproject is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations\nby 2022.

In\ncontrast, the observed behaviour in the optical band is complex (from 10$^2$ up\nto 10$^6$ s).

In contrast, the shallow optical\ndecay between 450 and 1500 s remains problematic, requiring a reverse shock\ncomponent whose typical frequency is above the optical band at the optical peak\ntime for it to be explained within the standard model. This predicts an\nincreasing flux density for the forward shock component until t $\\sim$ 4\n$\\times$ 10$^6$ s, inconsistent with the observed decay of the optical emission\nfrom t $\\sim$ 10$^4$ s.

For the same initial\nconditions, such as the fixed accretion rate, it is found that the intrinsic\nsize and radiation intensity of the images become larger, but the images become\nmore compact in the inner region, while the size of the black hole shadow\ndecreases with the increase of the black hole spin. With the increase of the\ninclination angles, the shapes of the black hole shadows change and become\nsmaller, even disappear at all due to the obscuration by the thick disks. For\nmedian inclination angles, the radial velocity observed at infinity is larger\nbecause of both the rotation and radial motion of the fluid in the disk, which\nresults in the luminous part of the images is much brighter. For larger\ninclination angles, such as the disk is edge on, the emission becomes dimmer at\nlonger observational wavelengths (such as at 7.0mm and 3.5mm wavelengths), or\nbrighter at shorter observational wavelengths (such as at 1.3 mm wavelength)\nthan that of the face on case, except for the high spin and high inclination\nimages.

The soft and hard band Power-Spectral\nDensities (PSDs) of these sources demonstrate variability over a wide range of\ntime-scales. However, on time-scales of tens of seconds, corresponding to the\nputative low-frequency Lorentzian in the PSD, there is additional power in the\nsoft band. To interpret this behaviour, we introduce a new spectral analysis\ntechnique, the `covariance spectrum', to disentangle the contribution of the\nX-ray spectral components to variations on different time-scales. We use this\ntechnique to show that the disc blackbody component varies on all time-scales,\nbut varies more, relative to the power-law, on longer time-scales. This\nbehaviour explains the additional long-term variability seen in the soft band.\nComparison of the blackbody and iron line normalisations seen in the covariance\nspectra in GX 339-4 implies that the short-term blackbody variations are driven\nby thermal reprocessing of the power-law continuum absorbed by the disc.\nHowever, since the amplitude of variable reflection is the same on long and\nshort time-scales, we rule out reprocessing as the cause of the enhanced disc\nvariability on long time-scales. Therefore we conclude that the long-time-scale\nblackbody variations are caused by instabilities in the disc itself, in\ncontrast to the stable discs seen in BHXRB soft states.

The optical spectrum of this object exhibits\nrather narrow Hbeta (FWHM(Hbeta) ~ 1500 km s^-1), weak forbidden lines and is\ntherefore classified as a narrow-line type I quasar. This class of objects is\nthought to have relatively small black hole mass and to accrete at high\nEddington ratio. The radio loudness and variability of the compact radio core\nindicates the presence of a relativistic jet. Quasi simultaneous\nradio-optical-X-ray and gamma-ray observations are presented. Both radio and\ngamma-ray emission (observed over 5-months) are strongly variable. The\nsimultaneous optical and X-ray data from Swift show a blue continuum attributed\nto the accretion disk and a hard X-ray spectrum attributed to the jet. The\nresulting broad band spectral energy distribution (SED) and, in particular, the\ngamma-ray spectrum measured by Fermi are similar to those of more powerful\nFSRQ. A comparison of the radio and gamma-ray characteristics of PMN J0948+0022\nwith the other blazars detected by LAT shows that this source has a relatively\nlow radio and gamma-ray power, with respect to other FSRQ.

Once the semimajor axis shrinks below a\ncritical value, angular momentum losses from gravitational waves dominate over\nviscous transport in hardening the binary. The inner disk then no longer\nresponds viscously to the inspiraling black holes. Instead, tidal interactions\nwith the secondary rapidly drive the inner disk into the primary.

While we do find signs of a bias against\nmassive, compact galaxies, this analysis suggests that the SDSS spectroscopic\nsample is missing at most a few objects in the regime we consider. Accepting\nthe high redshift results, it is clear that massive galaxies must undergo\nsignificant structural evolution over z<2 in order to match the population seen\nin the local universe.

We find that clusters at all\nexamined redshifts have accreted a significant fraction of their final galaxy\npopulations through galaxy groups.

Further, the galaxies which are accreted\nthrough groups are more massive, on average, than galaxies accreted through\nsmaller halos or from the field population. We find that at a given epoch, the\nfraction of galaxies accreted from isolated environments is independent of the\nfinal cluster or group mass. In contrast, we find that observing a cluster of\nthe same halo mass at each redshift epoch implies different accretion rates of\nisolated galaxies, from 5-6 % per Gyr at z=0 to 15% per Gyr at z=1.5. We find\nthat combining the existence of a Butcher Oemler effect at z=0.5 and the\nobservations that galaxies within groups display significant environmental\neffects with galaxy accretion histories justifies striking conclusions.

These magnetic fields can weaken the positive correlation between\nthe arrival directions of HECRs and the positions of their sources. In order to\nexplore the effect of GMF on the expected correlation, we simulate the arrival\ndistribution of protons with the energy above $6 \\times 10^{19}$ eV taking\nseveral GMF models into account, and then test the correlation between the\nprotons and their sources assumed in the simulation. The dependence of the\ncorrelation signals on GMF models are also investigated. The correlation can be\nobserved by accumulating $\\sim 200$ protons in a half hemisphere. Typical\nangular scale at which the positive signal of the correlation is maximized\ndepends on the spiral component of GMF models.

The X-ray spectrum is characterized by two main peculiar\nfeatures, i) a strong soft excess with a steep rise below about 1.3 keV and ii)\na deep drop in flux above 8.2 keV. We focus here on a reflection-based\ninterpretation which interprets both features, as well as the large soft\nexcess, in terms of partially ionized reflection off the inner accretion disc.\nWe show that the two peculiar spectral features mentioned above can be\nreproduced by two relativistic emission lines due to Fe K and Fe L. The lines\nare produced in the inner accretion disc and independently yield consistent\ndisc parameters. We argue that the high L/K intensity ratio is broadly\nconsistent with expectations from an ionized accretion disc reflection,\nindicating that they belong to a single ionized reflection component. The\nspectral shape, X-ray flux, and variability properties are very similar in the\nXMM-Newton and Suzaku observations, performed about 5 years apart.

I consider here the implications of the\nheavier composition on the sources of UHECRs. The smaller magnetic rigidity\nimplies that nuclei UHECRs are: (i) More easily accelerated (ii) Local, as they\ncan diffuse only a few Mpc from their sources before disintegrating (iii)\nIsotropic, because large deflections in the extra galactic and the galactic\nmagnetic fields erase the directional information. Uncertainties in the\nstrength and structure of the the extra galactic magnetic field (EGMF) makes it\ndifficult to estimate the overall effects.

A complete observability pipeline\nwas designed to calculate a probability estimation for a galaxy to be\nobservationally identified as a host for LGRBs detected by present\nobservational facilities. This new tool allows us to build an observable host\ngalaxy catalogue which is required to reproduce the current stellar mass\ndistribution of observed hosts. This observability pipeline predicts that the\nminimum mass for the progenitor stars should be ~75 solar masses in order to be\nable to reproduce BATSE observations. Systems in our observable catalogue are\nable to reproduce the observed properties of host galaxies, namely stellar\nmasses, colours, luminosity, star formation activity and metallicities as a\nfunction of redshift.

Therefore, the\ngravity on large scales should be dominant by the distribution of dark matter\nin the universe. However, a series of observations incontrovertibly show that\nthe velocity and density fields of baryonic matter are decoupling from\nunderlying dark matter field. This paper shows our attemps to unveil the\nphysics behind this puzzle. In linear approximation, the dynamics of the baryon\nfluid is completely governed by the gravity of the dark matter. Consequently,\nthe mass density field of baryon matter $\\rho_b({\\bf r},t)$ will be\nproportional to that of dark matter $\\rho_{\\rm dm}({\\bf r},t)$, even though\nthey are different from each other initially. In weak and moderate nonlinear\nregime, the dynamics of the baryon fluid can be sketched by Burgers equation. A\nbasic feature of the Burgers dynamics is to yield shocks. When the Reynolds\nnumber is large, the Burgers fluid will be in the state of Burgers turbulence,\nwhich consists of shocks and complex structures. On the other hand, the\ncollisionless dark matter may not show such shock, but a multivalued velocity\nfield. Therefore, the weak and moderate nonlinear evolution leads to the\nIGM-dark matter deviation. Yet, the velocity field of Burgers fluid is still\nirrotational, as gravity is curl-free. In fully nonlinear regime, the vorticity\nof velocity field developed, and the cosmic baryonic fluid will no longer be\npotential, as the dynamics of vorticity is independent of gravity and can be\nself maintained by the nonlinearity of hydrodynamics.

We assume that the\ncentral engines of a significant proportion of these bursts are provided by\nnewly born magnetars and consider two plausible GW emission mechanisms.\nFirstly, the deformation-induced triaxial GW emission from a newly born\nmagnetar. Secondly, the onset of a secular bar-mode instability, associated\nwith the long lived plateau observed in the X-ray afterglows of many gamma-ray\nbursts (Corsi & Meszaros 2009a). With regards to detectability, we find that\nthe onset of a secular instability is the most optimistic scenario: under the\nhypothesis that SL-GRBs associated with secularly unstable magnetars occur at a\nrate of (48; 80)Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1} or greater, cross-correlation of data from two\nEinstein Telescopes (ETs) could detect the GW background associated to this\nsignal with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 or greater after 1 year of\nobservation. Assuming neutron star spindown results purely from triaxial GW\nemissions, we find that rates of around (130;350)Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1} will be\nrequired by ET to detect the resulting GW background. We show that a background\nsignal from secular instabilities could potentially mask a primordial GW\nbackground signal in the frequency range where ET is most sen- sitive. Finally,\nwe show how accounting for cosmic metallicity evolution can increase the\npredicted signal-to-noise ratio for background signals associated with SL-GRBs. \n\n"}

The two pulsars resemble each other both in radio and in\ngamma-ray data. Both are rare in having a single gamma-ray pulse offset far\nfrom the radio peak. The high dispersion measure for PSR J0248+6021 (DM = 370\npc cm^-3) is most likely due to its being within the dense, giant HII region W5\nin the Perseus arm at a distance of 2 kpc, not beyond the edge of the Galaxy as\nobtained from models of average electron distributions.

Using\naxisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations with a self-consistent treatment of the\ndynamical cosmic ray (CR) - gas interaction, we show that the bubbles can be\ncreated with a recent active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet activity about 1 - 3\nMyr ago, which was active for a duration of ~ 0.1 - 0.5 Myr. The bipolar jets\nwere ejected into the Galactic halo along the rotation axis of the Galaxy. Near\nthe GC, the jets must be moderately light with a typical density contrast 0.001\n<~ \\eta <~ 0.1 relative to the ambient hot gas. The jets are energetically\ndominated by kinetic energy, and over-pressured with either CR or thermal\npressure which induces lateral jet expansion, creating fat CR bubbles as\nobserved.

This work investigates the origin of\nthe observed temperatures, by examining the relationship between them and the\ngalaxy structure, the gas heating due to Type Ia supernovae (SNIa's) and the\ngravitational potential, and the dynamical status of the gas flow. In galaxies\nwith sigma_c<200 km/s, the T's are close to a fiducial average temperature for\nthe gas when in outflow; at 200<sigma_c (km/s)<250, the T's are generally lower\nthan this, and unrelated with sigma_c, which requires a more complex gas flow\nstatus; at larger sigma_c, the T's may increase as sigma_c^2, as expected for\ninfall heating, though heating from SNIa's, independent of sigma_c, should be\ndominant. All observed T's are larger than the virial temperature, by up to\n~0.5 keV. This additional heating can be provided in the X-ray brightest\ngalaxies by SNIa's and infall heating, with a SNIa's energy input even lower\nthan in standard assumptions; in the X-ray fainter ones it can be provided by\nSNIa's, whose energy input would be required close to the full standard value\nat the largest sigma_c. This same energy input, though, would produce\ntemperatures larger than observed at low sigma_c, if entirely thermalized. The\nvalues of the observed T's increase from outflows to inflows; the gas is\nrelatively hotter in outflows, though, if the T's are rescaled by the virial\ntemperature. For 200<sigma_c(km/s)<250, lower L_X values tend to correspond to\nlower T's, which deserves further investigation. \n\n"}

Hence,\nclusters are expected to be luminous gamma-ray emitters since they also act as\nenergy reservoirs for additional CR sources, such as active galactic nuclei and\nsupernova-driven galactic winds. To detect the gamma-ray emission from CR\ninteractions with the ambient cluster gas, we conducted the deepest to date\nobservational campaign targeting a galaxy cluster at very high-energy\ngamma-rays and observed the Perseus cluster with the MAGIC Cherenkov telescopes\nfor a total of ~85 hr of effective observing time. This campaign resulted in\nthe detection of the central radio galaxy NGC 1275 at energies E > 100 GeV with\na very steep energy spectrum. Here, we restrict our analysis to energies E >\n630 GeV and detect no significant gamma-ray excess.

I argue that gamma rays are the source of ionization in the deepest\nmolecular clouds of dense starbursts, creating Gamma-Ray Dominated Regions\n(GRDRs). Gamma rays are not deflected by magnetic fields, have a luminosity up\nto ~1/3 that of the injected cosmic rays, and can easily penetrate column\ndepths of ~100 g/cm^2 before being attenuated by gamma-Z pair production. The\nionization rates of GRDRs, <~10^-16 s^-1, are much smaller than in cosmic ray\ndominated regions, but in the most extreme starbursts, they may still reach\nvalues comparable to those in Milky Way molecular clouds. The gas temperatures\nin GRDRs could be likewise low, <~10 K if there is no additional heating from\ndust or turbulence, while at high densities, the kinetic temperature will\napproach the dust temperature.

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with their higher luminosity are well suited\nto study galaxies out to the formation of the first stars at z > 10. Its large\nwavelength coverage makes the X-shooter spectrograph an excellent tool to study\nthe interstellar medium (ISM) of high redshift galaxies, in particular if the\nredshift is not known beforehand. Here we determine the properties of a GRB\nhost at z = 4.66723 from a number of resonant low- and high ionization and\nfine-structure absorption lines. This is one of the highest redshifts where a\ndetailed analysis with medium-resolution data has been possible. We detect one\nintervening system at z = 2.18. The velocity components of the absorption lines\nare fitted with Voigt-profiles and we determine a metallicity of [M/H] = -1.0\n\\pm 0.1 using S.

The physical\nparameters of the model - proton injection rate, electron-to-proton ratio and\ndownstream magnetic field strength - are determined through a fit of the result\nto the observed spatially-integrated synchrotron emission properties. The only\nremaining unknown astronomical parameter, the circumstellar gas number density,\nis determined by a normalization of the amplitude of the gamma-ray flux to the\nobserved amplitude. The bipolar morphology of both nonthermal X-ray and\ngamma-ray emissions is explained by the preferential injection of suprathermal\nnuclei and subsequent magnetic field amplification in the quasi-parallel\nregions of the outer supernova shock. The above parameters provide an improved\nfit to all existing nonthermal emission data, including the TeV emission\nspectrum recently detected by H.E.S.S., with the circumstellar hydrogen gas\nnumber density $N_H\\approx 0.06 cm^{-3}$ close to values derived from\nobservations of thermal X-rays.

Each\nobservation has been fitted with a realistic thermal comptonisation model for\nthe continuum emission. Prompted by the correlation between the UV and soft\nX-ray flux, we use a thermal comptonisation component for the soft X-ray\nexcess. The UV to X-rays/gamma-rays emission of Mrk 509 can be well fitted by\nthese components. The presence of a relatively hard high-energy spectrum points\nto the existence of a hot (kT~100 keV), optically-thin (tau~0.5) corona\nproducing the primary continuum. On the contrary, the soft X-ray component\nrequires a warm (kT~1 keV), optically-thick (tau~15) plasma. Estimates of the\namplification ratio for this warm plasma support a configuration close to the\n\"theoretical\" configuration of a slab corona above a passive disk. An\ninteresting consequence is the weak luminosity-dependence of its emission, a\npossible explanation of the roughly constant spectral shape of the soft X-ray\nexcess seen in AGNs. The temperature (~ 3 eV) and flux of the soft-photon field\nentering and cooling the warm plasma suggests that it covers the accretion disk\ndown to a transition radius $R_{tr}$ of 10-20 $R_g$. This plasma could be the\nwarm upper layer of the accretion disk. On the contrary the hot corona has a\nmore photon-starved geometry.

MPP is\nhowever similar to the earlier discovered and well known Blandford-Znajeck (BZ)\nmechanism in which the rotational energy of the hole is extracted out through a\npurely electromagnetic process. Though both the processes use magnetic field as\na device to extract rotational energy from the hole, yet their kernel is quite\ndifferent in spirit. For the former magnetic field provides the threshold\nenergy for particle to get onto negative energy orbit so that the other\nfragment goes out with enhanced energy while for the latter it generates an\nelectric potential difference between the equatorial plane and the polar\nregion, and it is the discharge of which that drives the energy flux out of the\nhole. In other words, MPP is still rooted in the spacetime geometry while BZ is\nessentially driven by electromagnetic interaction. \n\n"}

The source was\nfound in a quiet state, and its far-infrared spectrum is consistent with a\npower-law with a spectral index of alpha ~ 0.7. Our Herschel observations were\npreceded by two 'orphan' gamma-ray flares. The near-infrared data reveal the\nhigh-energy cut-off in the main synchrotron component, which cannot be\nassociated with the main gamma-ray component in a one-zone leptonic model.

While BL Lac objects can be\nrather successfully modelled within the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)\nscenario, the SED of low peaked Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQ) is more\ndifficult to reproduce. Their high-energy component needs the abundance of\nstrong external photon sources, giving rise to stronger cooling via the inverse\nCompton channel, and thusly to a powerful component in the SED. Recently, we\nwere able to show that such a powerful inverse Compton component can also be\nachieved within the SSC framework. This, however, is only possible if the\nelectrons cool by SSC, which results in a non-linear process, since the cooling\ndepends on an energy integral over the electrons. In this paper we aim to\ncompare the non-linear SSC framework with the external Compton (EC) output by\ncalculating analytically the external Compton component with the underlying\nelectron distribution being either linearly or non-linearly cooled. Due to the\nadditional linear cooling of the electrons with the external photons, higher\nnumber densities of electrons are required to achieve non-linear cooling,\nresulting in more powerful inverse Compton components. If the electrons\ninitially cool non-linearly, the resulting SED can exhibit a dominating SSC\nover the EC component. However, this dominance depends strongly on the input\nparameters.

The X-ray emission from the pulsar is consistent with a\nmagnetospheric non-thermal origin plus a thermal emission from a hot spot (or\nhot spots). The lack of a thermal component from the whole surface makes Morla\nthe coldest neutron star in its age range. We found marginal evidence for a\ndouble-peaked modulation of the X-ray emission. The study of the 9'-long tail\nconfirmed the lack of extended emission near the pulsar itself. The tail shows\na very asymmetric brightness profile and its spectrum lacks any spatial\nvariation. We found the nebular emission to be inconsistent with a classical\nbow-shock, ram-pressure dominated pulsar wind nebula. We propose thermal\nbremsstrahlung as an alternative mechanism for Morla's tail emission. In this\nscenario, the tail emission comes from the shocked interstellar medium (ISM)\nmaterial heated up to X-ray temperatures. This can fully explain the peculiar\nfeatures of the tail, assuming a hot, moderately dense interstellar medium\naround the pulsar. For a bremsstrahlung-emitting tail, we can estimate the\npulsar distance to be between 300 and 900 pc. A pulsar velocity of about 1900\nkm/s is required - which would make Morla the pulsar with the largest velocity\n- and high inclination angles (>70 degrees) are preferred.

Most\nAGN are radio quiet because the thin accretion disks that feed them are\ninefficient in depositing magnetic flux close to the black hole. Flux\naccumulation is more likely to occur during a hot accretion (or thick disk)\nphase, and we argue that radio-loud quasars and strong emission-line radio\ngalaxies occur only when a massive, cold accretion event follows an episode of\nhot accretion. Such an event might be triggered by the merger of a giant\nelliptical galaxy with a disk galaxy.\n  This picture supports the idea that flux accumulation can lead to the\nformation of a so-called magnetically choked accretion flow (MCAF). The large\nobserved range in radio loudness reflects not only the magnitude of the flux\npressed against the black hole, but also the decrease in UV flux from the disk,\ndue to its disruption by the \"magnetosphere\" associated with the accumulated\nflux. While the strongest jets result from the secular accumulation of flux,\nmoderate jet activity can also be triggered by fluctuations in the magnetic\nflux deposited by turbulent, hot inner regions of otherwise thin accretion\ndisks, or by the dissipation of turbulent fields in accretion disk coronae.\nThese processes could be responsible for jet production in Seyferts and\nlow-luminosity AGN, as well as jets associated with X-ray binaries. \n\n"}

Our primary result is that X-ray radiation from the\nshocks inhibits wind acceleration and can lead to a lower pre-shock velocity,\nand a correspondingly lower shocked plasma temperature, yet the intrinsic X-ray\nluminosity of the shocks, LX remains largely unaltered, with the exception of a\nmodest increase at small binary separations. Due to the feedback loop between\nthe ionizing X-rays from the shocks and the wind-driving, we term this scenario\nas self regulated shocks. This effect is found to greatly increase the range of\nbinary separations at which a wind-photosphere collision is likely to occur in\nsystems where the momenta of the two winds are significantly different.\nFurthermore, the excessive levels of X-ray ionization close to the shocks\ncompletely suppresses the line force, and we suggest that this may render\nradiative braking less effective.

Two dimensional\nhydrodynamical equations are solved at equatorial plane using the HRSCS to\nstudy the effect of perturbation on the stable systems. We have found that the\nperturbed torus creates an instability which causes the gas falling into the\nblack hole in a certain dynamical time. All the models indicate an oscillating\ntorus with certain frequency around their instant equilibrium. The dynamic of\nthe accreted torus varies with the size of initial stable torus, black hole\nspin and other variables, such as Mach number, sound speed, cusp location of\nthe torus, etc. The mass accretion rate is slightly proportional to the\ntorus-to-hole mass ratio in the black hole-torus system, but it strongly\ndepends on the cusp location of the torus. The cusp located in the\nequipotential surfaces of the effective potential moves outwards into the\ntorus. The dynamical change of the torus increases the mass accretion rate and\ntriggers the Papaloizou-Pringle instability. It is also observed that the\ngrowth of the $m=1$ mode of the Papaloizou-Pringle instability occurs for a\nwide range of fluid and hydrodynamical parameters and a black hole spin.

We compare\nour view of gas flows in M51 -- which arise due to departures from axi-symmetry\nin the gravitational potential (i.e. the nuclear bar and spiral arms) -- with\nthe global pattern of star formation as traced by Halpha and 24\\mu m emission.\nWe find that the dynamical environment of GMCs strongly affects their ability\nto form stars, in the sense that GMCs situated in regions with large streaming\nmotions can be stabilized, while similarly massive GMCs in regions without\nstreaming go on to efficiently form stars. We argue that this is the result of\nreduced surface pressure felt by clouds embedded in an ambient medium\nundergoing large streaming motions, which prevents collapse. Indeed, the\nvariation in gas depletion time expected based on the observed streaming\nmotions throughout the disk of M51 quantitatively agrees with the variation in\nobserved gas depletion time scale. The example of M51 shows that streaming\nmotions, triggered by gravitational instabilities in the form of bars and\nspiral arms, can alter the star formation law; this can explain the variation\nin gas depletion time among galaxies with different masses and morphologies. In\nparticular, we can explain the long gas depletion times in spiral galaxies\ncompared to dwarf galaxies and starbursts.

While the\nspectrum, intensity, and angular distribution of this signal is in good\nagreement with predictions from annihilating dark matter, it has also been\nsuggested that a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars could be\nresponsible for this excess GeV emission from the Inner Galaxy.

Often they show\ncoordinated variability at different frequencies, suggesting that in these\ncases the same population of electrons is at work, in a single zone of the jet.\nThe location of this region along the jet is a matter of debate. The jet power\ncorrelates with the mass accretion rate, with jets existing at all values of\ndisk luminosities, measured in Eddington units, sampled so far. The most\npowerful blazars show clear evidence of the emission from their disks, and this\nhas revived methods of finding the black hole mass and accretion rate by\nmodelling a disk spectrum to the data. Being so luminous, blazars can be\ndetected also at very high redshift, and therefore are a useful tool to explore\nthe far universe. One interesting line of research concerns how heavy are their\nblack holes at high redshifts. If we associate the presence of a relativistic\njet with a fastly spinning black hole, then we naively expect that the\naccretion efficiency is larger than for non-spinning holes. As a consequence,\nthe black hole mass in jetted systems should grow at a slower rate. In turn,\nthis would imply that, at high redshifts, the heaviest black holes should be in\nradio-quiet quasars.

Jet radio\nemission is expected from a sub-Eddington accreting IMBH in the low/hard (radio\nbright) state. In a search for such IMBH jet radio emission, we have observed\nwith the Very Large Array (VLA) at 5 GHz a sample of seven extreme ULXs whose\nX-ray properties indicate they are in the hard state. Assuming they remain in\nthis state, the non-detection of radio emission for six of the target sources\nallows us to constrain their black hole mass to the IMBH regime, thus ruling\nout a supermassive black hole nature.

The optical light curves are\nconsistent with a sinusoidal variability modulated with the orbital period,\nshowing evidence for a strongly irradiated companion star, in agreement with\nprevious findings. The observed colours cannot be accounted for by the\ncompanion star alone, suggesting the presence of an accretion disc during\nquiescence. The system is fainter in all analysed bands compared to previous\nobservations. The R band light curve displays a possible phase offset with\nrespect to the B and V band. Through a combined fit of the multi-band light\ncurves we derive constraints on the companion star and disc fluxes, on the\nsystem distance and on the companion star mass. The irradiation luminosity\nrequired to account for the observed day-side temperature of the companion star\nis consistent with the spin-down luminosity of a millisecond radio pulsar. The\nflux decrease and spectral evolution of the quiescent optical emission observed\ncomparing our data with previous observations, collected over 5 years, cannot\nbe well explained with the contribution of an irradiated companion star and an\naccretion disc alone. The progressive flux decrease as the system gets bluer\ncould be due to a continuum component evolving towards a lower, bluer spectrum.\nWhile most of the continuum component is likely due to the disc, we do not\nexpect it to become bluer in quiescence.

According to the Li-Paczynski kilonova\nmodel, the merger would launch sub-relativistic ejecta and a\nnear-infrared/optical transient would then occur, lasting up to days, which is\npowered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized in the ejecta.\nThe detection of a late bump using the {\\em Hubble Space Telescope} ({\\em HST})\nin the near-infrared afterglow light curve of the short-hard GRB 130603B is\nindeed consistent with such a model.

In this paper, we\ndetermine the number of distinct observables that can be derived from pulse\nprofile modeling and show that using only bolometric pulse profiles is\ninsufficient for breaking the degeneracy between inferred neutron-star radius\nand mass.

The collapsar model\nexplains GRB formation via the collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star with\n$M> 30M_\\odot$ into a black hole, which may imply a decrease of SFR at high\nredshift. However, we find that the \\emph{Swift} GRBs during 2005-2012 are\nbiased tracing the SFR, including a factor about $(1+z)^{0.5}$, which is in\nagreement with recent results. After taking this factor, the SFR derived from\nGRBs does not show steep drop up to $z\\sim 9.4$.

This is due to the very short\nlifetime of the charmed hadrons, which therefore do not lose energy before they\ndecay.

The model demonstrates that when the\nmedium is preheated to an entropy comparable to the halo virial entropy the\nbaryon accretion can be largely reduced and delayed. In addition, the preheated\nmedium can establish an extended low density gaseous halo when it accretes into\nthe dark matter halos, and result in a specific angular momentum of the cooling\ngas large enough to form central disks as extended as those observed. Combined\nwith simulated halo assembly histories, the preventative feedback model can\nreproduce remarkably well a number of observational scaling relations.

Physical processes\nsuch as star formation and supernovae are considered. The inner boundary of the\nsimulation domain is carefully chosen so that the fiducial Bondi radius is\nresolved and the accretion rate of the black hole is determined\nself-consistently. In analogy to previous works, we assume that the specific\nangular momentum of the galaxy is low. It is well-known that when the accretion\nrates are high and low, the central AGNs will be in cold and hot accretion\nmodes, which correspond to the radiative and kinetic feedback modes,\nrespectively. The emitted spectrum from the hot accretion flows is harder than\nthat from the cold accretion flows, which could result in a higher Compton\ntemperature accompanied by a more efficient radiative heating, according to\nprevious theoretical works. Such a difference of the Compton temperature\nbetween the two feedback modes, the focus of this study, has been neglected in\nprevious works. Significant differences in the kinetic feedback mode are found\nas a result of the stronger Compton heating and accretion becomes more chaotic.\nMore importantly, if we constrain models to correctly predict black hole growth\nand AGN duty cycle after cosmological evolution, we find that the favored model\nparameters are constrained: mechanical feedback efficiency diminishes with\ndecreasing luminosity (the maximum efficiency being $\\simeq 10^{-3.5}$) and\nX-ray Compton temperature increases with decreasing luminosity, although models\nwith fixed mechanical efficiency and Compton temperature can be found that are\nsatisfactory as well.

If the latter were true, then LBVs should be\nconcentrated in young clusters and found alongside main-sequence stars with\nsimilarly high inferred initial mass. This is decidedly not the case. Examining\nlocations of LBVs compared to O stars in our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds\nreveals that LBVs systematically avoid clusters of O stars, and many reside\nover 100 pc from any O star. In the LMC, LBVs are statistically much more\nisolated than O-type stars, and (perhaps most surprisingly) even more isolated\nthan most WR stars. This makes it impossible for LBVs to be massive stars in\ntransition to WR stars. Instead, we propose that massive stars and supernova\n(SN) subtypes are dominated by bifurcated evolutionary paths in interacting\nbinaries, wherein most WR stars and SNeIbc correspond to the mass donors, while\nLBVs (and their lower-mass analogs like B[e] supergiants, which we show to be\neven more isolated) are the mass gainers. LBVs are essentially the late\nevolutionary stage of massive blue stragglers.

There are two obstacles to deriving frequency-domain waveforms\nfor precessing systems: (i) the spin-precession equations do not admit\nclosed-form solutions for generic systems; (ii) the SPA fails catastrophically.\nPresently there is no general solution to the first problem, so we must resort\nto numerical integration of the spin precession equations.

Its apparent isotropic gamma-ray\nluminosity (E>100 MeV) averaged over $\\sim$ 3 years of observations and peaking\non 2010 October 14/15 at 2.9 X 10^{50} erg s^{-1}, makes it among the brightest\nhigh-redshift Fermi blazars. No published model with a single lens can account\nfor all of the observed characteristics of this complex system. Based on radio\nobservations, one expects time delayed variability to follow about 25 days\nafter a primary flare, with flux about a factor 1.5 less. Two large gamma-ray\nflares of PKS 1830-211 have been detected by the LAT in the considered period\nand no substantial evidence for such a delayed activity was found. This allows\nus to place a lower limit of about 6 on the gamma rays flux ratio between the\ntwo lensed images.

The resonant streaming instability, long invoked\nfor magnetic field amplification at shocks, can not provide sufficiently high\nfields and efficient enough scattering so as to ensure particle acceleration up\nto the knee. Here we discuss the non-resonant version of this instability\nwhich, with its faster growth and larger value of the amplified field,\nincreases the achievable maximum energy. Because of their higher explosion\nrate, we focus on type II SNe expanding in their red supergiant wind and we\nfind that the transition between Ejecta Dominated (ED) and Sedov-Taylor (ST)\nphases takes place at very early times. In this environment, the accelerated\nparticle spectrum shows no high energy exponential cut-off but a spectral break\nat the maximum energy (EM). Moreover, the maximum energy of protons can easily\nreach PeV energies. With this model, we tried to fit KASCADE Grande and ARGO\n-YBJ data but failed to find a parameter combination that can explain both data\nsets.

It was shown that in the\nnon-rotating case this can lead to a much stronger equation of state\nindependence and our goal is to generalize the static relations to the rapidly\nrotating case and values of the spherical mode number $l\\ge2$. We employ\nrealistic equations of state that cover a very large range of stiffness in\norder to check better the universality of the relations.

We refine previous models of this process by modelling the star's magnetic\nfield self-consistently as a 'twisted torus' configuration in non-barotropic\nequilibrium (which allows us to explore a greater range of equilibrium\nconfigurations). It is shown that, if the star's magnetic field is purely\ndipolar, the change in the toroidal field strength required to produce an\nanti-glitch of the observed size can be ~ 10 times larger than previously\ncalculated. If the star has a quadrupolar magnetic field component, then an\nanti-glitch of similar magnitude can be produced via a decay of the quadrupole\ncomponent, in addition to a decay of the toroidal component.

The sample consists of nearly 340 sources with\neither photometric (212) or spectroscopic (128) redshift in the above range.\nThe combination of deep and shallow survey fields provides a luminosity\nbaseline of three orders of magnitude, Lx(2-10keV)~1e43-1e46erg/s at z>3. We\nfollow a Bayesian approach to determine the binned AGN space density and\nexplore their evolution in a model-independent way. Our methodology accounts\nfor Poisson errors in the determination of X-ray fluxes and uncertainties in\nphotometric redshift estimates. We demonstrate that the latter is essential for\nunbiased measurement of space densities. We find that the AGN X-ray luminosity\nfunction evolves strongly between the redshift intervals z=3-4 and z=4-5. There\nis also suggestive evidence that the amplitude of this evolution is luminosity\ndependent. The space density of AGN with Lx<1e45erg/s drops by a factor of 5\nbetween the redshift intervals above, while the evolution of brighter AGN\nappears to be milder. Comparison of our X-ray luminosity function with that of\nUV/optical selected QSOs at similar redshifts shows broad agreement at bright\nluminosities, Lx>1e45erg/s. The faint-end slope of UV/optical luminosity\nfunctions however, is steeper than for X-ray selected AGN. This implies that\nthe type-I AGN fraction increases with decreasing luminosity at z>3, opposite\nto trends established at lower redshift. We also assess the significance of AGN\nin keeping the hydrogen ionised at high redshift. Our X-ray luminosity function\nyields ionising photon rate densities that are insufficient to keep the\nUniverse ionised at redshift z>4.

We present a search for potential dark matter subhalos in our Galaxy\nexploiting the high (HE, 100 MeV -- 100 GeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, >100\nGeV) gamma-ray bands. We assume a scenario where the dark matter is composed of\nweakly interacting massive particles of mass over 100 GeV, and is capable of\nself-annihilation into standard model products. Under such a hypothesis, most\nof the photons created by the annihilation of dark matter particles are\npredicted to lay in the HE gamma-ray band, where the Fermi-Large Area Telescope\nis the most sensitive instrument to date. However, the distinctive spectral\ncut-off located at the dark matter particle mass is expected in the VHE\ngamma-ray band, thus making imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes like\nVERITAS the best suited instruments for follow-up observations and the\ncharacterization of a potential dark matter signature.

Force-free turbulent relaxation is found\nto exhibit an inverse cascade in all settings, and in 3D to have a magnetic\nenergy spectrum consistent with the Kolmogorov $5/3$ power law. 3D relaxations\nalso obey the Taylor hypothesis; they settle promptly into the lowest energy\nconfiguration allowed by conservation of the total magnetic helicity.

All hadron masses decrease universally with the scalar field\ngrowth, whereas meson-nucleon coupling constants can vary differently. More\nspecifically we focus on two modifications of the KVOR model studied\npreviously.

The possible association of spectral residuals at\nsoft energies with atomic features seen in absorption and/or emission and\npotentially broadened by velocity dispersion could therefore hold the key to\nunderstanding much about these enigmatic sources. Here we show for the first\ntime that such residuals are seen in several sources and appear extremely\nsimilar in shape, implying a common origin.

It has never been clear how they fit into the\ngeneral scheme of accreting compact objects. To address this problem, we\nstudied a sample of seven ULSs with extensive Chandra and XMM-Newton coverage.\nWe find an anticorrelation between fitted temperatures and radii of the thermal\nemitter, and no correlation between bolometric luminosity and radius or\ntemperature. We compare the physical parameters of ULSs with those of classical\nsupersoft sources, thought to be surface-nuclear-burning white dwarfs, and of\nultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), thought to be super-Eddington stellar-mass\nblack holes. We argue that ULSs are the sub-class of ULXs seen through the\ndensest wind, perhaps an extension of the soft-ultraluminous regime. We suggest\nthat in ULSs, the massive disk outflow becomes effectively optically thick and\nforms a large photosphere, shrouding the inner regions from our view. Our model\npredicts that when the photosphere expands to >10,000 km and the temperature\ndecreases below approximately 50 eV, ULSs become brighter in the far-UV but\nundetectable in X-rays. Conversely, we find that harder emission components\nbegin to appear in ULSs when the fitted size of the thermal emitter is smallest\n(interpreted as a shrinking of the photosphere). The observed short-term\nvariability and absorption edges are also consistent with clumpy outflows.

This phenomenon has profound implications for the\ninterpretation of the multifrequency spectra of radiation from supernova\nremnants. Neutrals that undergo charge exchange with hot ions downstream of the\nshock may result in fast neutrals moving towards the upstream gas, where they\ncan suffer additional charge exchange or ionisation reactions, thereby\ndepositing energy and momentum upstream. Here we discuss the implications of\nthis neutral return flux, which was already predicted in our previous work on\nneutral mediated supernova shocks, and show how the spectra of accelerated\nparticles turn out to be appreciably steeper than $p^{-4}$, thereby affecting\nthe gamma ray spectra from supernova remnants in general and from Tycho\nspecifically. The theory that describes non-linear diffusive shock acceleration\nin the presence of neutral hydrogen has been developed in recent years. Here we\nuse a semi-analytical theory developed in previous work and specialise our\npredictions to the case of the Tycho supernova shock, where there is evidence\nthat the spectrum of the accelerated cosmic rays is steeper than expected from\nthe traditional theory of diffusive shock acceleration. We show that, if the\nfraction of neutral hydrogen in the vicinity of the Tycho supernova shock is,\nas suggested by observations, ~70-90, then spectra of accelerated protons\nsteeper than $p^{-4}$ may be a natural consequence of charge exchange reactions\nand the associated neutral return flux.

The leading decay channels which determine dark radiation predictions\nare to hidden sector axions, visible sector Higgses and SUSY scalars depending\non their mass.

The temperature across the bow shock jumps by a\nfactor of $\\sim$ 1.5 (from 4.1 keV to 6.2 keV), and is consistent with the Mach\nnumber $M = 1.6_{-0.3}^{+0.5}$. A second inner surface brightness edge is a\ncold front that marks the border between infalling subcluster cool core and the\nICM of the main cluster. The temperature across the cold front increases from\n$1.3_{-0.8}^{+0.3}$ keV to $6.2_{-0.6}^{+0.6}$ keV. We find an overpressurized\nregion $\\sim$ 250 kpc east of the cold front that is named \"the eastern\nextension (EE)\". The EE may be a part of the third subcluster in the ongoing\nmerger. We also find a tail shaped feature that originates near the bow shock\nand may extend up to a distance of $\\sim$ 1 Mpc. This feature is also likely\noverpressurized. The luminous FR-I radio galaxy, 3C89, appears to be the cD\ngalaxy of the infalling subcluster.

When q<< 1, the accretion takes\nplace mostly onto the more massive component, with the accretion rate onto the\nperturber being smaller than, or of order of, q^(1/3)M. However, this rate\nincreases when supermassive binary black holes are considered and gravitational\nwave emission is important. We estimate a typical duration of time for which\nthe accretion onto the perturber and gravitational waves could be detected. \n\n"}

However,\ntheir origin is still highly debated. In one of the leading formation\nscenarios, a black hole of $\\sim100$ M$_{\\odot}$ results from the collapse of\nthe inner core of a supermassive star ($\\gtrsim 10^{4-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$), created\nby the rapid accumulation ($\\gtrsim 0.1 $ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) of pristine\ngas at the centre of newly formed galaxies at $z\\sim 15$. The subsequent\nevolution is still speculative: the remaining gas in the supermassive star can\neither directly plunge into the nascent black hole, or part of it can form a\ncentral accretion disc, whose luminosity sustains a surrounding, massive, and\nnearly hydrostatic envelope (a system called a \"quasi-star\"). To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon. Less massive quasi-stars could form but last\nfor only $\\lesssim 10^4$ years before the accretion luminosity unbinds the\nenvelope, suppressing the black hole growth. We speculate that this might\neventually lead to a dual black hole seed population: (i) massive ($>10^{4}$\nM$_{\\odot}$) seeds formed in the most massive ($> 10^{8}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and rare\nhaloes; (ii) lighter ($\\sim 10^{2}$ M$_{\\odot}$) seeds to be found in less\nmassive and therefore more common haloes. \n\n"}

If not accounted for, even a small orbital eccentricity can cause a\npotentially significant systematic error in the mass parameters of an\ninspiralling binary. Gravitational-wave search templates typically rely on the\nquasi-circular approximation, which provides relatively simple expressions for\nthe gravitational-wave phase to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. The\nquasi-Keplerian formalism provides an elegant but complex description of the\npost-Newtonian corrections to the orbits and waveforms of inspiralling binaries\nwith any eccentricity.

However, how the feedback energy is\ntransformed into heat, and how the AGN jets heat the intracluster medium (ICM)\nisotropically, still remain elusive. In this work, we gain insights into the\nrelative importance of different heating mechanisms using three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations including cold gas accretion and momentum-driven jet\nfeedback, which are the most successful models to date in terms reproducing the\nproperties of cool cores. We find that there is net heating within two `jet\ncones' (within ~30 degrees from the axis of jet precession) where the ICM gains\nentropy by shock heating and mixing with the hot thermal gas within bubbles.\nOutside the jet cones, the ambient gas is heated by weak shocks, but not enough\nto overcome radiative cooling, therefore forming a `reduced' cooling flow.\nConsequently, the cluster core is in a process of `gentle circulation' over\nbillions of years. Within the jet cones, there is significant adiabatic cooling\nas the gas is uplifted by buoyantly rising bubbles; outside the cones, energy\nis supplied by inflow of already-heated gas from the jet cones as well as\nadiabatic compression as the gas moves toward the center. In other words, the\nfluid dynamics self-adjusts such that it compensates and transports the heat\nprovided by the AGN, and hence no fine-tuning of the heating profile of any\nprocess is necessary. Throughout the cluster evolution, turbulent energy is\nonly at the percent level compared to gas thermal energy, and thus turbulent\nheating is not the main source of heating in our simulation. \n\n"}

Here, we employ a suite of large-scale two-dimensional\nparticle-in-cell simulations in electron-positron plasmas to demonstrate that\nrelativistic magnetic reconnection can naturally account for the formation of\nquasi-spherical plasmoids filled with high-energy particles and magnetic\nfields. Our simulations extend to unprecedentedly long temporal and spatial\nscales, so we can capture the asymptotic physics independently of the initial\nsetup. We characterize the properties of the plasmoids that are continuously\ngenerated as a self-consistent by-product of the reconnection process: they are\nin rough energy equipartition between particles and magnetic fields; the upper\nenergy cutoff of the plasmoid particle spectrum is proportional to the plasmoid\nwidth w, corresponding to a Larmor radius ~0.2 w; the plasmoids grow in size at\n~0.1 of the speed of light, with most of the growth happening while they are\nstill non-relativistic (first they grow); their growth is suppressed once they\nget accelerated to relativistic speeds by the field line tension, up to the\nAlfven speed (then they go).

{"id": "1608.00487", "contents": "Title: Analysis of Neutron Stars Observations Using a Correlated Fermi Gas\n  Model Abstract: Background: The nuclear symmetry energy is a fundamental ingredient in\ndetermining the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NS). Recent\nterrestrial experiments constrain both its value and slope at nuclear\nsaturation density, however, its value at higher densities is unknown. Assuming\na Free Fermi-gas (FFG) model for the kinetic symmetry energy, the high-density\nextrapolation depends on a single parameter, the density dependence of the\npotential symmetry energy. The Correlated Fermi-gas (CFG) model improves on the\nFFG model by including the effects of short-range, correlated, high-momentum,\nnucleons in nuclear matter. Using the CFG model for the kinetic symmetry energy\nalong with constraints from terrestrial measurements leads to a much softer\ndensity dependence for the potential symmetry energy. Purpose: Examine the\nability of the FFG and CFG models to describe NS observables that are directly\nsensitive to the symmetry energy at high-density. Specifically, examine the\nability of the CFG model, with its softer density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy, to describe a two solar-mass NS. Methods: Using a Bayesian\nanalysis of NS observables we compare the CFG and FFG models and examine the\nresulting parameters in the NS EOS and the density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy. Results: Despite the large difference in the density\ndependence of the potential part of the symmetry energy, both models can\ndescribe the NS data and support a two solar-mass NS. The different density\ndependences has only a small effect on the NS EOS. Conclusions: While sensitive\nto the high-density values of the symmetry energy, NS observables alone are not\nenough to distinguish between the CFG and FFG models. This indicates that the\nNS EOS, obtain from Bayesian analysis of NS observables, is robust and is not\nsensitive to the exact nuclear model used for the kinetic symmetry energy. \n\n"}

Leading candidates for their origin are\nblue supergiant collapsars, magnetars, and white dwarf tidal disruption events\n(WD-TDEs) caused by massive black holes (BHs). Recent observations of\nsupernova-like (SN-like) bumps associated with ulGRBs challenged both the\nWD-TDE and the blue supergiant models because of the detection of SNe and the\nabsence of hydrogen lines, respectively. We propose that WD-TDEs can\naccommodate the observed SN-like bumps if the fallback WD matter releases\nenergy into the unbound WD ejecta. The observed ejecta energy, luminosity, and\nvelocity are explained by the gravitational energy, Eddington luminosity, and\nescape velocity of the formed accretion disk, respectively.

The SN-like light\ncurves (SN 2011kl) for the ulGRB 111209A are consistent with all three models,\nalthough a magnetar model is unnatural because the spin-down time required to\npower the SN-like bump is a hundred times longer than the GRB.

Furthermore, an accurate appropriately parameterised metric,\ni.e., a metric that is given in terms of parameters that are directly related\nto the physical structure of the neutron star, could be used to solve the\ninverse problem, which is to infer the properties of the structure of a neutron\nstar from astrophysical observations.

The pericenters of the orbits\nperform a random walk, and we consider cases where this random walk slowly\nbrings the binary to the Hills tidal separation radius (the so-called empty\nloss-cone regime). However, we find that in a majority of cases the expected\nseparation does not occur and instead the members of the binary merge together.\nThis happens because the binary's eccentricity is excited by tidal interactions\nwith the MBH, and the relative excursions of the internal eccentricity of the\nbinary far exceed those in its internal semimajor axis.

There is also a break close to the Eddington limit, above\nwhich the probability of an accretion event decreases steeply.

We present a\nseries of hydro-chemical simulations of an isotropic AGN wind interacting with\na uniform medium. We follow the time-dependent chemistry of 157 species,\nincluding 20 molecules, to determine whether molecules can form rapidly enough\nto produce the observed molecular outflows. We find H$_2$ outflow rates up to\n140 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, which is sensitive to density, AGN luminosity, and\nmetallicity. We compute emission and absorption lines of CO, OH and warm (a few\nhundred K) H$_2$ from the simulations in post-processing. The CO-derived\noutflow rates and OH absorption strengths at solar metallicity agree with\nobservations, although the maximum line of sight velocities from the model CO\nspectra are a factor $\\approx$2 lower than is observed.

If the disk luminosity temporary\nincreases by, e.g., limit-cycle oscillations, leading to a powerful radiatively\ndriven wind, strong shock waves propagate in the BLR. Because the dense clouds\nin the AGN BLRs typically have similar densities to those found in Type IIn\nsupernovae, strong radiative shocks emerge and efficiently convert the ejecta\nkinetic energy to radiation. As a result, transients similar to Type IIn\nsupernovae can be observed at AGN central regions. Since a typical black-hole\ndisk wind velocity is ~ 0.1c where c is the speed of light, the ejecta kinetic\nenergy is expected to be ~ 1e52 erg when ~ 1 Msun is ejected. This kinetic\nenergy is transformed to radiation energy in a timescale for the wind to sweep\nup a similar mass to itself in the BLR, which is a few hundred days. Therefore,\nboth luminosities (~ 1e44 erg/s) and timescales (~ 100 days) of the\nsuperluminous transients from AGN central regions match to those expected in\nour interaction model.

The origin of this emission is debated, with\nproposed explanations including supernova shock breakout, emission from a\ncocoon surrounding the jet, as well as emission from the jet itself. A larger\nsample of detections is needed in order to place constraints on these different\nmodels.

The\nself-similarity of the temperature profiles and tight mass--temperature\nrelation of relaxed cool-core clusters suggest that the maximum effect of\nsedimentation take place in the most massive virialized objects in the\nUniverse. However, Chandra and XMM-Newton observations demonstrate more complex\nscaling relations between the masses of early-type galaxies and other\nparameters, such as the ISM temperature and gas mass fraction. An important\nfact is that early-type galaxies can show both decreasing and increasing radial\ntemperature profiles.

Energy\nconservation guarantees that a bubble loses most of its energy to the ICM after\ncrossing several pressure scale heights. However, actual processes responsible\nfor transferring the energy to the ICM are still being debated. One attractive\npossibility is the excitation of internal waves, which are trapped in the\ncluster's core and eventually dissipate. Here we show that a sufficient\ncondition for efficient excitation of these waves in stratified cluster\natmospheres is flattening of the bubbles in the radial direction.

However, the Earth is not a fully transparent medium for neutrinos with\nenergies above a few TeV. At these energies, the charged-current\nneutrino-nucleon cross section is large enough so that the neutrino mean-free\npath in a medium with the Earth's density is comparable to the Earth's\ndiameter. Therefore, when neutrinos of these energies cross the Earth, there is\na non-negligible probability for them to be absorbed. Since this effect depends\non the distance traveled by neutrinos and on their energy, studying the zenith\nand energy distributions of TeV atmospheric neutrinos passing through the Earth\noffers an opportunity to infer the Earth's density profile.

Progenitors, accretion in the central engine, jet\n  acceleration mechanisms Abstract: The collapsar model was proposed to explain the long-duration gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs), while the short GRBs are associated with the mergers of compact\nobjects. In the first case, mainly the energetics of the events is consistent\nwith the proposed progenitor models, while the duration, time variability, as\nwell as the afterglow emission may shed some light on the detailed properties\nof the collapsing massive stars. In the latter case, the recent discovery of\nthe binary neutron star (NS-NS) merger in the gravitational wave observation\nmade by LIGO (GW170817), and the detection of associated electromagnetic\ncounterparts, for the first time gave a direct proof of the NS-NS merger being\na progenitor of a short GRB.\n  In general, all GRBs are believed to be powered by accretion through a\nrotationally supported torus, or by fast rotation of a compact object. For long\nones, the rotation of the progenitor star is a key property in order to support\naccretion over relatively long activity periods, and also to sustain the\nrotation of the black hole itself. The latter is responsible for ejection of\nthe relativistic jets, which are powered due to the extraction of the BH\nrotational energy, mitigated by the accretion torus and magnetic fields. The\njets must break through the stellar envelope though, which poses a question on\nthe efficiency of this process. Similar mechanisms of powering the jet ejection\nmay act in short GRBs, which in this case may freely propagate through the\ninterstellar medium. The power of the jets launched from the rotating black\nhole is at first associated mostly with the magnetic Poynting flux, and then at\nlarge distances it is transferred to the kinetic and finally radiative energy\nof the expanding shells. \n\n"}

One possibility is the dynamical\nchannel, in which binary formation and hardening is catalyzed by dynamical\nencounters in globular clusters (GCs). Previous studies have shown that the BH\nmerger rate from the present day GC density in the Universe is lower than the\nobserved rate. In this \\textit{Letter}, we study the BH merger rate by\naccounting for the first time for the evolution of GCs within their host\ngalaxies. The mass in GCs was initially $\\sim 8\\times$ higher, which decreased\nto its present value due to evaporation and tidal disruption. Many BH binaries\nthat were ejected long before their merger, originated in GCs that no longer\nexist. We find that the comoving merger rate in the dynamical channel from GCs\nvaries between $18$ to $35\\,{\\rm Gpc}^{-3}\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ between redshift\n$z=0.5$ to $2$, and the total rate is $1$, $5$, $24$ events per day within\n$z=0.5$, $1$, and $2$, respectively.

The radio and X-ray afterglows of GW170817 exhibited delayed\nonset, a gradual rise in the emission with time as t^0.8, a peak at about 150\ndays post-merger, followed by a relatively rapid decline.

Spacetime perturbations Abstract: Improvements in ground-based, advanced gravitational wave (GW) detectors may\nallow in the near future to observe the GW signal of a nearby core-collapse\nsupernova. For the most common type of progenitors, likely with slowly rotating\ncores, the dominant GW emission mechanisms are the post-bounce oscillations of\nthe proto-neutron star (PNS) before the explosion. We present a new procedure\nto compute the eigenmodes of the system formed by the PNS and the stalled\naccretion shock in general relativity including spacetime perturbations. The\nnew method improves on previous results by accounting for perturbations of both\nthe lapse function and the conformal factor. We apply our analysis to two\nnumerical core-collapse simulations and show that our improved method is able\nto obtain eigenfrequencies that accurately match the features observed in the\nGW signal and to predict the qualitative behaviour of quasi-radial\noscillations. Our analysis is possible thanks to a newly developed algorithm to\nclassify the computed eigenmodes in different classes (f-, p-, and g-modes),\nimproving previous results which suffered from misclassification issues. We\nfind that most of the GW energy is stored in the lowest order eigenmodes, in\nparticular in the $^2g_1$ mode and in the $^2f$ mode.

Using our recent solutions for the non-rigid precessional dynamics, and\nviscous dissipation integrals derived in this paper, we make the only\nself-consistent calculation to date of these dissipation rates.

The final state is an\neternally radiating relic, near the fundamental scale, which should make a\nviable dark matter candidate. We briefly comment on the black hole information\nloss problem and the production of such black holes in collider experiments. \n\n"}

This can be achieved, as in\ninflationary cosmology, thanks to the existence of a dynamical attractor, which\nmakes local observables equal to the unperturbed solution up to exponentially\nsmall terms. Assuming that the physics of the bounce is not extremely sensitive\nto these corrections, perturbations can be evolved even at non-linear level.\nThe resulting spectrum is not scale invariant and thus incompatible with\nexperimental data. This can be explicitly shown in synchronous gauge where,\ncontrary to what happens in the commonly used Newtonian gauge, all\nperturbations remain small going towards the bounce and the existence of the\nattractor is manifest. \n\n"}

The model is the ghost condensate with the global shift symmetry\nsoftly broken by a potential. We show that this system can drive a cosmological\nexpansion with dH/dt > 0. Demanding the absence of instabilities in this model\nrequires dH/dt <~ H^2. We then construct a general low-energy effective theory\nthat describes scalar fluctuations about an arbitrary FRW background, and argue\nthat the qualitative features found in our model are very general for stable\nsystems that violate the NEC. Violating the NEC allows dramatically\nnon-standard cosmological histories. To illustrate this, we construct an\nexplicit model in which the expansion of our universe originates from an\nasymptotically flat state in the past, smoothing out the big-bang singularity\nwithin control of a low-energy effective theory. This gives an interesting\nalternative to standard inflation for solving the horizon problem. We also\nconstruct models in which the present acceleration has w < -1; a periodic\never-expanding universe and a model with a smooth ``bounce'' connecting a\ncontracting and expanding phase. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-th/0702206", "contents": "Title: A New Dimension Hidden in the Shadow of a Wall Abstract: We propose a new way to hide the fifth dimension, and to modify gravity in\nthe far infra-red. A gravitating tensional membrane in five dimensions folds\nthe transverse space into a truncated cone, stoppered by the membrane. For\nnear-critical tension, the conical opening is tiny, and the space becomes a\nvery narrow conical sliver. A very long section, of length comparable to the\nmembrane radius divided by the remaining conical angle, of this sliver is well\napproximated by a narrow cylinder ending on the membrane. Inside this\ncylindrical throat we can reduce the theory on the circle. At distances between\nthe circle radius and the length of the cylinder, the theory looks 4D, with a\nBrans-Dicke-like gravity, and a preferred direction, while at larger distances\nthe cone opens up and the theory turns 5D. The gravitational light scalar in\nthe throat can get an effective local mass term from the interplay of matter\ninteractions and quantum effective potentials on the cone, which may suppress\nits long range effects. We discuss some phenomenologically interesting\nconsequences. \n\n"}

The string\ndynamics in cosmological and black hole spacetimes is investigated.The methods\nto solve the string equations of motion in curved spacetimes are described.That\nis, the perturbation approach, the null approach, the $\\tau$-expansion, and the\nconstruction of global solutions.The behaviour of strings in FRW and inflatio-\nnary spacetimes is obtained from the various types of string solutions. Three\ndifferent types of behaviour appear:{\\bf unstable, dual} to unstable and {\\bf\nstable}.For the unstable strings, the energy and size grow proportional to $R$\nfor large scale factors $R \\to \\infty$. For the dual to unstable strings, the\nenergy and size blow up for R\\to 0 as 1/R. For stable strings, the energy and\nsize are bounded. (In Minkowski, all solutions are of the stable type). The\nself-consistent solution to the Einstein equations for string dominated\nuniverses is reviewed. The energy-momentum tensor for a gas of strings is taken\nas source and from the above behaviours the string equation of state is {\\bf\nderived}. The self-consistent string solution exhibits realistic matter\ndominated behaviour for large times and radiation dominated behaviour for early\ntimes. We report on the {\\bf exact integrability} of the string dynamics in de\nSitter spacetime that allows to systematically find {\\bf exact} string\nsolutions by soliton methods. {\\bf Multistring solutions} are a new feature in\ncurved spacetimes.

{"id": "physics/0701039", "contents": "Title: Optimization of quantum Monte Carlo wave functions by energy\n  minimization Abstract: We study three wave function optimization methods based on energy\nminimization in a variational Monte Carlo framework: the Newton, linear and\nperturbative methods. In the Newton method, the parameter variations are\ncalculated from the energy gradient and Hessian, using a reduced variance\nstatistical estimator for the latter. In the linear method, the parameter\nvariations are found by diagonalizing a non-symmetric estimator of the\nHamiltonian matrix in the space spanned by the wave function and its\nderivatives with respect to the parameters, making use of a strong\nzero-variance principle. In the less computationally expensive perturbative\nmethod, the parameter variations are calculated by approximately solving the\ngeneralized eigenvalue equation of the linear method by a nonorthogonal\nperturbation theory. These general methods are illustrated here by the\noptimization of wave functions consisting of a Jastrow factor multiplied by an\nexpansion in configuration state functions (CSFs) for the C$_2$ molecule,\nincluding both valence and core electrons in the calculation. The Newton and\nlinear methods are very efficient for the optimization of the Jastrow, CSF and\norbital parameters. The perturbative method is a good alternative for the\noptimization of just the CSF and orbital parameters. Although the optimization\nis performed at the variational Monte Carlo level, we observe for the C$_2$\nmolecule studied here, and for other systems we have studied, that as more\nparameters in the trial wave functions are optimized, the diffusion Monte Carlo\ntotal energy improves monotonically, implying that the nodal hypersurface also\nimproves monotonically. \n\n"}
