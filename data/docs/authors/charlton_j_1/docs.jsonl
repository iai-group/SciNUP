Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

The three stages involves a neutron star phase, a quark star (QS)\nand a black hole phase as described in Staff et al. (2007). We find that the QS\nstage allows for more energy to be extracted from neutron star to QS conversion\nas well as from ensuing accretion onto the QS. The QS accretion phase naturally\nextends the engine activity and can account for both the prompt emission and\nirregular early X-ray afterglow activity. Following the accretion phase, the QS\ncan spin-down by emission of a baryon-free outflow. The magnetar-like magnetic\nfield strengths resulting from the NS to QS transition provide enough spin-down\nenergy, for the correct amount of time, to account for the plateau in the X-ray\nafterglow.

We find agglomeration is\npredominant when both the warm and cold components of the ISM are effectively\nstable to gravitational instabilities. In this case, the spacing (and\nconsequently mass) of clouds and spurs along the spiral arms is determined by\nthe orbits of the gas particles and correlates with their epicyclic radii (or\nequivalently spiral shock strength). Notably GMCs formed primarily by\nagglomeration tend to be unbound associations of many smaller clouds, which\ndisperse upon leaving the spiral arms.

Our models combine different\ncodes of chemical evolution, evolutionary population synthesis and\nphotoionization. The emitted spectrum of HII galaxies is reproduced by means of\nthe photoionization code CLOUDY (Ferland, 1998), using as ionizing spectrum the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) of the modelled HII galaxy, calculated using\nthe new and updated stellar population models PopStar (Molla & Garcia-Vargas\n2009, in prep.).This, in turn, is calculated according to a star formation\nhistory and a metallicity evolution given by a chemical evolution model.

The\ndistribution of high-redshift quasars was recently used to constrain the power\nasymmetry on scales k ~ 1.5h/Mpc, and the upper bound on the amplitude of the\nasymmetry was found to be a factor of six smaller than the amplitude of the\nasymmetry in the CMB. We show that it is not possible to generate an asymmetry\nwith this scale dependence by changing the relative contributions of the\ninflaton and curvaton to the adiabatic power spectrum. Instead, we consider\ncurvaton scenarios in which the curvaton decays after dark matter freezes out,\nthus generating isocurvature perturbations. If there is a superhorizon\nfluctuation in the curvaton field, then the rms amplitude of these\nperturbations will be asymmetric, and the asymmetry will be most apparent on\nlarge angular scales in the CMB. We find that it is only possible to generate\nthe observed asymmetry in the CMB while satisfying the quasar constraint if the\ncurvaton's contribution to the total dark matter density is small, but nonzero.\nThe model also requires that the majority of the primordial power comes from\nfluctuations in the inflaton field.

The environment studies, divided into two redshift\nbins, show that both the low mass, and the more massive LSBs possess an\nenvironment with a lower galaxy density than HSBs. The differences in the\ngalaxy density between LSBs and HSBs are significant on scales between 2 and 5\nMpc, the scales of groups and filaments. To quantify this, we have introduced\nfor the first time the LSB-HSB Antibias. The obtained LSB-HSB Antibias\nparameter has a value of 10%-15%. From these results we conclude that LSBs\nformed in low-density regions of the initial universe and have drifted until\nnow to the outer parts of the filaments and walls of the large-scale structure.\nFurthermore, our results, together with actual cosmological simulations, show\nthat LSBs are caused by a mixture of nature and nurture. \n\n"}

The metallicity evolution of the\ngas inside galaxies is broadly consistent with observations, but the diffuse\nIGM is under enriched at z $\\sim$ 2.5.

I: First Systematics Abstract: Star clusters are studied widely both as benchmarks for stellar evolution\nmodels and in their own right. Cluster age and mass distributions within\ngalaxies are probes of star formation histories, and of cluster formation and\ndisruption processes. The vast majority of clusters in the Universe is small,\nand it is well known that the integrated fluxes and colors have broad\nprobability distributions, due to small numbers of bright stars. This paper\ngoes beyond the description of predicted probability distributions, and\npresents results of the analysis of cluster energy distributions in an\nexplicitly stochastic context. The method developed is Bayesian. It provides\nposterior probability distributions in the age-mass-extinction space, using\nmulti-wavelength photometric observations and a large collection of Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of clusters of finite stellar masses. Both UBVI and UBVIK datasets\nare considered, and the study conducted in this paper is restricted to the\nsolar metallicity. We first reassess and explain errors arising from the use of\nstandard analysis methods, which are based on continuous population synthesis\nmodels: systematic errors on ages and random errors on masses are large, while\nsystematic errors on masses tend to be smaller. The age-mass distributions\nobtained after analysis of a synthetic sample are very similar to those found\nfor real galaxies in the literature. The Bayesian approach on the other hand,\nis very successful in recovering the input ages and masses.

Rather\nthan adopt a parameterized alpha prescription, we instead use the condition of\nmarginal gravitational instability to self-consistently determine the position-\nand time-dependent transport rates.

Lya radiative transfer substantially modifies the intrinsic Lya\nemission properties, compared to observed ones, depending on the density and\nvelocity structure environment around the Lya emitting galaxy. This\nenvironment-dependent Lya selection introduces new features in LAE clustering,\nsuppressing (enhancing) the line-of-sight (transverse) density fluctuations and\ngiving rise to scale-dependent galaxy bias. In real space, the contours of the\nthree-dimensional two-point correlation function of LAEs appear to be\nprominently elongated along the line of sight on large scales, an effect that\nis opposite to and much stronger than the linear redshift-space distortion\neffect.

It has\nresisted a both global and precise physical interpretation despite a consequent\nnumber of works, observational, theoretical or using numerical simulations. It\nappears that its precise properties depend on the population of galaxies in\nstudy. Instead of selecting a priori these populations, we propose to\nobjectively construct homologous populations from multivariate analyses. We\nhave undertaken multivariate cluster and cladistic analyses of a sample of 56\nlow-redshift galaxy clusters containing 699 early-type galaxies, using four\nparameters: effective radius, velocity dispersion, surface brightness averaged\nover effective radius, and Mg2 index. All our analyses are consistent with\nseven groups that define separate regions on the global fundamental plane, not\nacross its thickness. In fact, each group shows its own fundamental plane,\nwhich is more loosely defined for less diversified groups. We conclude that the\nglobal fundamental plane is not a bent surface, but made of a collection of\nseveral groups characterizing several fundamental planes with different\nthicknesses and orientations in the parameter space. Our diversification\nscenario probably indicates that the level of diversity is linked to the number\nand the nature of transforming events and that the fundamental plane is the\nresult of several transforming events. We also show that our classification,\nnot the fundamental planes, is universal within our redshift range (0.007 -\n0.053). We find that the three groups with the thinnest fundamental planes\npresumably formed through dissipative (wet) mergers. In one of them, this(ese)\nmerger(s) must have been quite ancient because of the relatively low\nmetallicity of its galaxies, Two of these groups have subsequently undergone\ndry mergers to increase their masses. In the k-space, the third one clearly\noccupies the region where bulges (of lenticular or spiral galaxies) lie and\nmight also have formed through minor mergers and accretions. The two least\ndiversified groups probably did not form by major mergers and must have been\nstrongly affected by interactions, some of the gas in the objects of one of\nthese groups having possibly been swept out. The interpretation, based on\nspecific assembly histories of galaxies of our seven groups, shows that they\nare truly homologous. They were obtained directly from several observables,\nthus independently of any a priori classification. The diversification scenario\nrelating these groups does not depend on models or numerical simulations, but\nis objectively provided by the cladistic analysis. Consequently, our\nclassification is more easily compared to models and numerical simulations, and\nour work can be readily repeated with additional observables. \n\n"}

For these radio galaxies, the median\nstellar mass is high, 2x10^11 M_sun, and remarkably constant within the range\n1<z<3. At z>3, there is tentative evidence for a factor of two decrease in\nstellar mass. This suggests that radio galaxies have assembled the bulk of\ntheir stellar mass by z~3, but confirmation by more detailed decomposition of\nstellar and AGN emission is needed.\n  The restframe 500 MHz radio luminosities are only marginally correlated with\nstellar mass but are strongly correlated with the restframe 5um hot dust\nluminosity.

The SFH of the Tucana dSph and the relative\n  ages of the isolated dSph galaxies Abstract: We present a detailed study of the star formation history (SFH) of the Tucana\ndwarf spheroidal galaxy. High quality, deep HST/ACS data, allowed us to obtain\nthe deepest color-magnitude diagram to date, reaching the old main sequence\nturnoff (F814 ~ 29) with good photometric accuracy. Our analysis, based on\nthree different SFH codes, shows that Tucana is an old and metal-poor stellar\nsystem, which experienced a strong initial burst of star formation at a very\nearly epoch (~ 13 Gyr ago) which lasted a maximum of 1 Gyr (sigma value). We\nare not able to unambiguously answer the question of whether most star\nformation in Tucana occurred before or after the end of the reionization era,\nand we analyze alternative scenarios that may explain the transformation of\nTucana from a gas-rich galaxy into a dSph. Current measurements of its radial\nvelocity do not preclude that Tucana may have crossed the inner regions of the\nLocal Group once, and so gas stripping by ram pressure and tides due to a close\ninteraction cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, the high star formation\nrate measured at early times may have injected enough energy into the\ninterstellar medium to blow out a significant fraction of the initial gas\ncontent. Gas that is heated but not blown out would also be more easily\nstripped via ram pressure.

We find that submm flux density and star formation rate\n(SFR) are related in dramatically different ways for quiescently star-forming\ngalaxies and starbursts. Because the stars formed in the merger-induced\nstarburst do not dominate the bolometric luminosity and the rapid drop in dust\nmass and more compact geometry cause a sharp increase in dust temperature\nduring the burst, starbursts are very inefficient at boosting submm flux\ndensity (e.g., a $\\ga16$x boost in SFR yields a $\\la 2$x boost in submm flux\ndensity). Moreover, the ratio of submm flux density to SFR differs\nsignificantly between the two modes; thus one cannot assume that the galaxies\nwith highest submm flux density are necessarily those with the highest\nbolometric luminosity or SFR. These results have important consequences for the\nbright submillimeter-selected galaxy (SMG) population. Among them are: 1. The\nSMG population is heterogeneous.

Inefficient fueling (and/or\nfeedback) from fast stellar winds has been invoked to explain this, but we\nargue this is unlikely in bright systems accreting primarily cold dense gas. We\nshow that such a delay can arise even in bright quasars for purely dynamical\nreasons. If some large-scale process produces rapid inflow, smaller scales will\nquickly become gas-dominated. As the gas density peaks, so does the SFR.\nHowever, gravitational torques which govern further inflow are relatively\ninefficient in gas-dominated systems; as more gas is turned into stars, the\nstars provide an efficient angular momentum sink allowing more rapid inflow.\nMoreover, the gas provided to the central regions in mergers or strong disk\ninstabilities will typically be ~100 times larger than that needed to fuel the\nBH; the system is effectively in the 'infinite gas supply' limit.

In this paper, the first in a series, we present and test a novel\nnumerical implementation of stellar feedback resulting from momentum imparted\nto the ISM by radiation, supernovae, and stellar winds. We employ a realistic\ncooling function, and find that a large fraction of the gas cools to <100K, so\nthat the ISM becomes highly inhomogeneous. Despite this, our simulated galaxies\nreach an approximate steady state, in which gas gravitationally collapses to\nform giant molecular clouds (GMCs), dense clumps, and stars; subsequently,\nstellar feedback disperses the GMCs, repopulating the diffuse ISM. This\ncollapse and dispersal cycle is seen in models of SMC-like dwarfs, the\nMilky-Way, and z~2 clumpy disk analogues. The simulated global star formation\nefficiencies are consistent with the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.\nMoreover, the star formation rates are nearly independent of the numerically\nimposed high-density star formation efficiency, density threshold, and density\nscaling. This is a consequence of the fact that, in our simulations, star\nformation is regulated by stellar feedback limiting the amount of very dense\ngas available for forming stars. In contrast, in simulations without stellar\nfeedback, i.e. under the action of only gravity and gravitationally-induced\nturbulence, the ISM experiences runaway collapse to very high densities. In\nthese simulations without feedback, the global star formation rates exceed\nobserved galactic star formation rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude,\ndemonstrating that stellar feedback is crucial to the regulation of star\nformation in galaxies. \n\n"}

The results show that in strong\nsupersonic shocks, the temperature of the post-shock gas quickly increases\nproportional to square of the Mach number, and then gradually decreases\naccording to the cooling processes.

The shallow gravitational potential of the dark matter\nsubhaloes (compared to the primary halo) allows us to use the epicyclic\napproximation, the equations of which we solve by modal analysis, i.e.,\nassuming a disc is composed of N radial rings with M modes. We show that\nproperties of dark matter subhaloes can be inferred from the profile and\namplitude of the modal energy of the disc.

No satisfactory explanation for the Blazhko effect\nhas been proposed so far. In this paper we focus on the Stothers (2006) idea,\nin which modulation is caused by changes in the structure of the outer\nconvective zone, caused by a quasi-periodically changing magnetic field.\nHowever, up to this date no quantitative estimates were made to investigate\nwhether such a mechanism can be operational and whether it is capable of\nreproducing the light variation we observe in Blazhko variables.

The approach assumes that all\nthese quantities can be mapped to problems involving the first crossing\ndistribution of a suitably chosen barrier by random walks. Most analytic\nexpressions for these distributions ignore the fact that, although different\nk-modes in the initial Gaussian field are uncorrelated, this is not true in\nreal space: the values of the density field at a given spatial position, when\nsmoothed on different real-space scales, are correlated in a nontrivial way. As\na result, the problem is to estimate first crossing distribution by random\nwalks having correlated rather than uncorrelated steps. In 1990, Peacock &\nHeavens presented a simple approximation for the first crossing distribution of\na single barrier of constant height by walks with correlated steps.

We study the impact of this effect on\nthe star formation history of galaxies. We incorporate metallicity-dependent\nstar formation and metal enrichment in a simple model that follows the\nevolution of a halo main progenitor. Our model shows that including the effect\nof metallicity leads to suppression of star formation at redshift z>2 in dark\nhalos with masses <~ 10^11 Msun, with the suppression becoming near total for\nhalos below ~10^9.5-10 Msun. We find that at high redshift the SFR cannot catch\nup with the gas inflow rate (IR), because the SFR is limited by the free-fall\ntime, and because it is suppressed further by a lack of metals. As a result, in\neach galaxy the SFR is growing in time faster than the IR, and the integrated\ncosmic SFR density is rising with time. The suppressed in situ SFR at high z\nmakes the growth of stellar mass dominated by ex situ SFR which implies that\nthe specific SFR (sSFR) remains constant with time.

This provides additional\nfuel for star formation in 10^10 - 10^12 Msun halos at z ~ 1-3, which allows\nthe SFR to exceed the instantaneous IR, and may enable an even higher outflow\nrate. At z<1, following the natural decline in IR with time due to the\nuniversal expansion, the SFR and sSFR are expected to drop. We specify the\nexpected dependence of sSFR and metallicity on stellar mass and redshift. At a\ngiven z, and below a critical mass, these relations are predicted to be flat\nand rising respectively. Our model predictions qualitatively match some of the\npuzzling features in the observed star formation history. \n\n"}

We collect and\nexploit these data in order to measure from the spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) precisely how much stellar radiation is intercepted and re-radiated by\ndust, and how this quantity varies with galaxy properties. By including SPIRE\ndata, we are more sensitive to emission from cold dust grains than previous\nanalyses at shorter wavelengths, allowing for more accurate estimates of dust\ntemperatures and masses.\n  The dust/stellar flux ratio, which we measure by integrating the SEDs, has a\nrange of nearly three decades. The inclusion of SPIRE data shows that estimates\nbased on data not reaching these far-IR wavelengths are biased low. We find\nthat the dust/stellar flux ratio varies with morphology and total IR\nluminosity.

Unfortunately, however, no single SFR estimator is\nuniversally available or even applicable in all circumstances: the numerous\ngalaxies found in deep surveys are often too faint (or too distant) to yield\nsignificant detections with most standard SFR measures, and until now there\nhave been no global, multi-band observations of nearby galaxies that span all\nthe conditions under which star-formation is taking place. To address this need\nin a systematic way, we have undertaken a multi-band survey of all types of\nstar-forming galaxies in the local Universe. This project, the Star Formation\nReference Survey (SFRS), is based on a statistically valid sample of 369 nearby\ngalaxies that span all existing combinations of dust temperature, SFR, and\nspecific SFR.

Noguchi (1998,1999) suggested another\nbulge formation scenario, `clump-origin bulge'. He demonstrated using a\nnumerical simulation that a galactic disc suffers dynamical instability to form\nclumpy structures in the early stage of disc formation since the premature disc\nis expected to be highly gas-rich, then the clumps are sucked into the galactic\ncentre by dynamical friction and merge into a single bulge at the centre. This\nbulge formation scenario, which is expected to happen only at the\nhigh-redshift, is different from the galactic merger and the secular evolution.\nTherefore, clump-origin bulges may have their own unique properties.

The disc is assumed to be\ncontinuously fed by cold gas at the average cosmological rate. The gas forms\nstars and is partly driven away by stellar feedback.

The gravitational energy released by the mass inflow down\nthe gravitational potential gradient drives the disc turbulence that maintains\nthe disc unstable with a Toomre instability parameter Q~1, compensating for the\ndissipative losses of the gas turbulence and raising the stellar velocity\ndispersion. We follow the velocity dispersion of stars and gas as they heat and\ncool respectively and search for disc `stabilization', to be marked by a low\ngas velocity dispersion comparable to the speed of sound ~10 km/s.

Extreme structural models Abstract: Concerning bivariate least squares linear regression, the classical results\nobtained for extreme structural models in earlier attempts are reviewed using a\nnew formalism in terms of deviation (matrix) traces which, for homoscedastic\ndata, reduce to usual quantities leaving aside an unessential (but dimensional)\nmultiplicative factor. Within the framework of classical error models, the\ndependent variable relates to the independent variable according to the usual\nadditive model. The classes of linear models considered are regression lines in\nthe limit of uncorrelated errors in X and in Y. For homoscedastic data, the\nresults are taken from earlier attempts and rewritten using a more compact\nnotation. For heteroscedastic data, the results are inferred from a procedure\nrelated to functional models. An example of astronomical application is\nconsidered, concerning the [O/H]-[Fe/H] empirical relations deduced from five\nsamples related to different stars and/or different methods of oxygen abundance\ndetermination. For low-dispersion samples and assigned methods, different\nregression models yield results which are in agreement within the errors for\nboth heteroscedastic and homoscedastic data, while the contrary holds for\nlarge-dispersion samples. In any case, samples related to different methods\nproduce discrepant results, due to the presence of (still undetected)\nsystematic errors, which implies no definitive statement can be made at\npresent. Asymptotic expressions approximate regression line slope and intercept\nvariance estimators, for normal residuals, to a better extent with respect to\nearlier attempts. Related fractional discrepancies are not exceeding a few\npercent for low-dispersion data, which grows up to about 10% for\nlarge-dispersion data.

The simulations include\na model for the formation and dynamical disruption of the entire star cluster\npopulation. We find that the dynamical heating of clusters by tidal shocks is\nabout an order of magnitude higher in interacting galaxies than in isolated\ngalaxies. This is driven by the increased gas density, and is sufficient to\ndestroy star clusters at a higher rate than new clusters are formed: the total\nnumber of clusters in the merger remnant is 2-50% of the amount in the\nprogenitor discs, with low-mass clusters being disrupted preferentially. By\nadopting observationally motivated selection criteria, we find that the\nobserved surplus of star clusters in nearby merging galaxies is caused by the\nbias to detect young, massive clusters. We provide a general expression for the\nsurvival fraction of clusters, which increases with the gas depletion\ntime-scale. Due to the preferential disruption of low-mass clusters, the mass\ndistribution of the surviving star clusters in a merger remnant develops a peak\nat a mass of about 10^3 Msun, which evolves to higher masses at a rate of\n0.3-0.4 dex per Gyr.

Nevertheless, we\nshow that NIR light curves can be reasonably fit with a template, especially if\nthe observations begin within 5 days after NIR maximum. For the subset of 13\nobjects in our dataset that excludes the highly reddened and fast declining SNe\nIa, and includes only those objects for which NIR observations began prior to\nfive days after maximum light, we find modest evidence for a peak\nluminosity-decline rate relation in Y, and stronger evidence in J and H.

The former result from\nthe direct collapse of gas in T_s^h >1.5x10^4K, H_2-free halos; the latter are\nthe endproduct of a standard H_2-based star formation process. The H_2-free\ncondition is attained by exposing halos to a strong (J_21 > 10^3) Lyman-Werner\nUV background produced by both accreting BHs and stars, thus establishing a\nself-regulated growth regime. We find that this condition is met already at z\nclose to 18 in the highly biased regions in which quasars are born. The key\nparameter allowing the formation of SMBHs by z=6-7 is the fraction of halos\nthat can form heavy seeds: the minimum requirement is that f_heavy>0.001; SMBH\nas large as 2x10^10 Msol can be obtained when f_heavy approaches unity.\nIndependently of f_heavy, the model produces a high-z stellar bulge-black hole\nmass relation which is steeper than the local one, implying that SMBHs formed\nbefore their bulge was in place. The formation of heavy seeds, allowed by the\nLyman-Werner radiative feedback in the quasar-forming environment, is crucial\nto achieve a fast growth of the SMBH by merger events in the early phases of\nits evolution, i.e. z>7. The UV photon production is largely dominated by stars\nin galaxies, i.e. black hole accretion radiation is sub-dominant.\nInterestingly, we find that the final mass of light BHs and of the SMBH in the\nquasar is roughly equal by z=6; by the same time only 19% of the initial baryon\ncontent has been converted into stars. The SMBH growth is dominated at all\nepochs z > 7.2 by mergers (exceeding accretion by a factor 2-50); at later\ntimes accretion becomes by far the most important growth channel.

For such events, the outer disk is very likely\nmisaligned with respect to the equatorial plane of the spinning SMBH, since the\nincoming star before disruption most likely has an inclined orbital plane. The\ntilted disk is subject to the Lense-Thirring torque, which tends to twist and\nwarp due to the Bardeen-Petterson effect. The inner disk tends to align with\nthe SMBH spin, while the outer region tends to remain in the stellar orbital\nplane, with a transition zone around the Bardeen-Petterson radius. The\nrelativistic jet launched from the spinning SMBH would undergo precession. The\n5-30 day X-ray lightcurve of Sw J1644+57 shows a quasi-periodic (2.7-day)\nvariation with noticeable narrow dips.

Using the Planck experiment as an example, we investigate the impact of\nincorrectly modelling foregrounds on estimates of the polarized CMB, quantified\nby the bias in tensor-to-scalar ratio r, and optical depth tau. We use a\nBayesian parameter estimation method to estimate the CMB, synchrotron, and\nthermal dust components from simulated observations spanning 30-353 GHz,\nstarting from a model that fits the simulated data, returning r<0.03 at 95%\nconfidence for an r=0 model, and r=0.09+-0.03 for an r=0.1 model. We then\nintroduce a set of mismatches between the simulated data and assumed model.\nIncluding a curvature of the synchrotron spectral index with frequency, but\nassuming a power-law model, can bias r high by ~1-sigma (delta r ~ 0.03). A\nsimilar bias is seen for thermal dust with a modified black-body frequency\ndependence, incorrectly modelled as a power-law. If too much freedom is allowed\nin the model, for example fitting for spectral indices in 3 degree pixels over\nthe sky with physically reasonable priors, we find r can be biased up to\n~3-sigma high by effectively setting the indices to the wrong values.\nIncreasing the signal-to-noise ratio by reducing parameters, or adding\nadditional foreground data, reduces the bias.

A less pronounced offset separates dwarf\nspheroidal (dSph) and dwarf irregular galaxies, making the former too\nmetal-rich for their luminosity, which indicates different formation conditions\nfor these two types of dwarfs. While environment (photo-evaporation through\nlocal re-ionization by massive galaxies, tidal and ram pressure stripping)\ngovern the observed morphology-distance relation, intrinsic properties (in\nparticular total mass) play a decisive role in dwarf galaxy evolution with\nrespect to the time and duration of star formation and the amount of\nenrichment. The metallicity distribution functions of nearby dwarfs can be\nunderstood taking pre-enrichment, gas infall, and winds into account. Many\ndwarfs show evidence for inhomogeneous, localized enrichment. Ultra-faint\ndSphs, which may have formed their metal-poor stars at high redshift via H2\ncooling, show an overabundance of metal-deficient stars as compared to the\n(inner) Galactic halo, but may, along with classical dSphs, have contributed\nsignificantly to the build-up of the outer halo. The abundance ratios measured\nin the irregular Large Magellanic Cloud are consistent with the postulated\nearly accretion of irregulars to form the inner Galactic halo. \n\n"}

This is worrisome because with only spectra, the global\n21cm signal can be difficult to distinguish from foregrounds such as Galactic\nsynchrotron radiation, as both are spectrally smooth and the latter is orders\nof magnitude brighter. We establish a mathematical framework for global signal\ndata analysis in a way that removes foregrounds optimally, complementing\nspectra with angular information. We explore various experimental design\ntrade-offs, and find that 1) with spectral-only methods, it is impossible to\nmitigate errors that arise from uncertainties in foreground modeling; 2)\nforeground contamination can be significantly reduced for experiments with fine\nangular resolution; 3) most of the statistical significance in a positive\ndetection during the Dark Ages comes from a characteristic high-redshift trough\nin the 21cm brightness temperature; and 4) Measurement errors decrease more\nrapidly with integration time for instruments with fine angular resolution.

Using data from\nHerschel, we study the formation of CH+ and SH+ in a typical high\nUV-illumination photon-dominated region (PDR), the Orion Bar. Herschel/HIFI\nprovides velocity-resolved data of CH+ 1-0 and 2-1 and three hyperfine\ntransitions of SH+.

The widths of the CH+ 2-1 and 1-0\ntransitions are of ~5 km/s, significantly broader than the typical width of\ndense gas tracers in the Orion Bar (2-3 km/s) and are comparable to the width\nof tracers of the interclump medium such as C+ and HF. The detected SH+\ntransitions are narrower compared to CH+ and have line widths of 3 km/s,\nindicating that SH+ emission mainly originates in denser condensations. Non-LTE\nradiative transfer models show that electron collisions affect the excitation\nof CH+ and SH+, and that reactive collisions need to be taken into account to\ncalculate the excitation of CH+. Comparison to PDR models shows that CH+ and\nSH+ are tracers of the warm surface region (AV<1.5) of the PDR with\ntemperatures between 500-1000 K. We have also detected the 5-4 transition of\nCF+ (FWHM=1.9 km/s) with an intensity that is consistent with previous\nobservations of lower-J CF+ transitions toward the Orion Bar. A comparison to\nPDR models indicate that the internal vibrational energy of H2 can explain the\nformation of CH+ for typical physical conditions in the Orion Bar near the\nionization front. H2 vibrational excitation is the most likely explanation of\nSH+ formation as well.

We simulate the nearby\n(radius 250 pc) part of this population, corresponding to the closest ~35 000\nblack holes, using current best estimates of the mass distribution of stellar\nmass black holes combined with two models for the velocity distribution of\nstellar-mass IBH which bracket likely possibilities. We distribute this\npopulation of objects appropriately within the different phases of the ISM and\ncalculate the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate, modified by a further dimensionless\nefficiency parameter \\lambda. Assuming a simple prescription for radiatively\ninefficient accretion at low Eddington ratios, we calculate the X-ray\nluminosity of these objects, and similarly estimate the radio luminosity from\nrelations found empirically for black holes accreting at low rates. The latter\nassumption depends crucially on whether or not the IBH accrete from the ISM in\na manner which is axisymmetric enough to produce jets. Comparing the predicted\nX-ray fluxes with limits from hard X-ray surveys, we conclude that either the\nBondi-Hoyle efficiency parameter \\lambda, is rather small (< 0.01), the\nvelocities of the IBH are rather high, or some combination of both.

Compared to the hosts of unobscured GRBs at\nsimilar redshifts, we find that the hosts of dust-obscured GRBs are (on\naverage) more massive by about an order of magnitude and also more rapidly\nstar-forming and dust-obscured. While this demonstrates that GRBs populate all\ntypes of star-forming galaxies including the most massive, luminous systems at\nz~2, at redshifts below 1.5 the overall GRB population continues to show a\nhighly significant aversion away from massive galaxies and a preference for\nlow-mass systems relative to what would be expected given a purely SFR-selected\ngalaxy sample.

To investigate the\nstructural evolution of another type of celestial bodies, we use the MESA code\nto extend these calculations to gaseous planets. We show that this function is\nconserved for all models during the whole planetary evolution and is\nindependent of the planet mass. We also analyse the cases for which this\nfunction is not conserved during some stellar evolutionary phases. For the PMS\nto the WD cooling sequences, we have found a connection between the strong\nvariations of \\Gamma(M, EOS) during the intermediary evolutionary phases and\nthe specific nuclear power. A threshold for the specific nuclear power was\ndetermined. Below this limit this function is invariant (~ 0.4) for these\nmodels, i.e., at the initial and final stages (PMS and WD). Concerning NS, we\nstudy the influence of the equation of state (EOS) on this function and refine\nthe exponent of the auxiliary function \\Lambda(R) to be ~ 0.8.

Therefore, we confirm that regardless of the final\nproducts of the stellar evolution, NS or WD, they recover the initial value of\n\\Gamma(M, EOS) ~ 0.4 acquired at the PMS.

In cases of no detection we\nestimated upper limits of the X-ray luminosities of possible AGNs at the\nredshifts of the sub-DLAs. In six cases we find possible X-ray emission within\n~ 1 arcsec of the background quasar consistent with the presence of a nearby\nX-ray source. If these nearby X-ray sources are at the redshifts of the\nsub-DLAs, their estimated 0.2-10 keV luminosities range between 0.8 x\n10^{44}h^{-2} and 4.2 x 10^{44}h^{-2} erg s^{-1}, thus ruling out a normal\nlate-type galaxy origin, and suggesting that the emission originates in a\ngalactic nucleus near the center of a protogalaxy. The projected distances of\nthese possible nearby X-ray sources from the background quasars lie in the\nrange of 3-7 h^{-1} kpc, consistent with our hypothesis that they represent\nAGNs centered on the sub-DLAs. Deeper follow-up X-ray and optical observations\nare required to confirm the marginal detections of X-rays from these sub-DLA\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

In this way,\nrather than discretizing the presence of both stellar bars and nuclear\nactivity, we are able to account for the continuum of bar strengths and degrees\nof AGN activity.

Strong bars do not favor brighter or more\nefficient nuclear activity, implying that at least for the low-luminosity\nregime, supermassive black hole fueling is not closely connected to large scale\nfeatures. \n\n"}

The most prominent sources\nof this system are a quasar and a submillimeter galaxy, separated by a\nprojected distance of about 24 kpc and characterized by very high SFR, higher\nthan 1000 Msun/yr. However, the ALMA observations reveal that these galaxies\napparently have undisturbed rotating disks, which is at variance with the\ncommonly accepted scenario in which strong star formation activity is induced\nby a major merger. We also detected faint components which, after spectral\ndeblending, were spatially resolved from the main QSO and SMG emissions. The\nrelative velocities and positions of these components are compatible with\norbital motions within the gravitational potentials generated by the QSO host\ngalaxy and the SMG, suggesting that they are smaller galaxies in interaction or\ngas clouds in accretion flows of tidal streams. We did not find any clear\nspectral evidence for outflows caused by AGN or stellar feedback. This suggests\nthat the high star formation rates might be induced by interactions or minor\nmergers with these companions, which do not affect the large-scale kinematics\nof the disks, however.

Abstract: With 3rd-order statistics of gravitational shear it will be possible to\nextract valuable cosmological information from ongoing and future weak lensing\nsurveys which is not contained in standard 2nd-order statistics, due to the\nnon-Gaussianity of the shear field. Aperture mass statistics are an appropriate\nchoice for 3rd-order statistics due to their simple form and their ability to\nseparate E- and B-modes of the shear. However, it has been demonstrated that\n2nd-order aperture mass statistics suffer from E-/B-mode mixing because it is\nimpossible to reliably estimate the shapes of close pairs of galaxies. This\nfinding has triggered developments of several new 2nd-order statistical\nmeasures for cosmic shear. Whether the same developments are needed for\n3rd-order shear statistics is largely determined by how severe this E-/B-mixing\nis for 3rd-order statistics. We test 3rd-order aperture mass statistics against\nE-/B-mode mixing, and find that the level of contamination is well-described by\na function of $\\theta/\\theta_{\\rm min}$, with $\\theta_{\\rm min}$ being the\ncut-off scale.

The optimal\nquadratic estimator is found to suppress foregrounds by an extra factor of\n$\\sim 10^5$ in power at the peripheries of the EoR window, boosting the\ndetection of the cosmological signal from $12\\sigma$ to $50\\sigma$ at the\nmidpoint of reionization in our fiducial models. If numerical issues can be\nfinessed, decorrelation techniques allow the EoR window to be further enlarged,\nenabling measurements to be made deep within the foreground wedge. These\ntechniques do not assume that foreground are Gaussian-distributed, and we\nadditionally prove that a final round of foreground subtraction can be\nperformed after decorrelation in a way that is guaranteed to have no\ncosmological signal loss. \n\n"}

We recast the model as a field theory for cosmological large scale\nstructure, adding a stochastic force to account for power generated from very\nshort, highly non-linear scales that is uncorrelated with the initial power\nspectrum. The dynamics of this Stochastic Adhesion Model (SAM) is reminiscent\nof the well known Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation with the difference that the\nviscosity and the noise spectrum are time dependent. Choosing the viscosity\nproportional to the growth factor $D$ restricts the form of noise spectrum\nthrough a 1-loop renormalization argument. For this choice, the SAM field\ntheory is renormalizable to one loop.

The typical stellar mass\nof this sample is Mstar~2x10^{11} Msun.

Here we review the current status of\nmodels that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy\nformation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We\nfocus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the\nglobal and structural properties of galaxies from roughly Cosmic High Noon\n($z\\sim 2-3$) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall,\nmodels show remarkable convergence between different methods and make\npredictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers seem\nto have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for\nshaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion,\nstrong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole\nfeedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and\nstructural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental\nprocesses. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological\nimplementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to\nobservations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a\nhierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood.

Abstract: Scale-dependent halo bias due to local primordial non-Gaussianity provides a\nstrong test of single-field inflation. While it is universally understood that\nsingle-field inflation predicts negligible scale-dependent bias compared to\ncurrent observational uncertainties, there is still disagreement on the exact\nlevel of scale-dependent bias at a level that could strongly impact inferences\nmade from future surveys. In this paper, we clarify this confusion and derive\nin various ways that there is exactly zero scale-dependent bias in single-field\ninflation. Much of the current confusion follows from the fact that\nsingle-field inflation does predict a mode coupling of matter perturbations at\nthe level of $f_{NL}^{loc} \\approx -5/3$, which naively would lead to\nscale-dependent bias. However, we show explicitly that this mode coupling\ncancels out when perturbations are evaluated at a fixed physical scale rather\nthan fixed coordinate scale. Furthermore, we show how the absence of\nscale-dependent bias can be derived easily in any gauge. This result can then\nbe incorporated into a complete description of the observed galaxy clustering,\nincluding the previously studied general relativistic terms, which are\nimportant at the same level as scale-dependent bias of order $f_{NL}^{loc} \\sim\n1$. This description will allow us to draw unbiased conclusions about inflation\nfrom future galaxy clustering data. \n\n"}

The\nfate of this dense wind material is important for models of second generation\nstar formation in massive star clusters. Mackey et al. (2014) showed that\nexternal photoionization can stall the wind of RSGs and accumulate mass in a\ndense static shell. We use 1D R-HD simulations of an externally photoionized\nwind to predict the Halpha and [NII] emission arising from photoionized winds\nboth with and without a dense shell. We analyse spectra of the Halpha and [NII]\nemission in the environment around W26 and compare them with predicted\nsynthetic emission. Simulations of slow winds that are decelerated into a dense\nshell show strongly limb-brightened line emission, with line radial velocities\nthat are independent of the wind speed. Faster winds (>22 km/s) do not form a\ndense shell, have less limb-brightening, and the line radial velocity is a good\ntracer of the wind speed. The brightness of the [NII] and Halpha lines as a\nfunction of distance from W26 agrees reasonably well with observations when\nonly the line flux is considered. The radial velocity disagrees, however: the\nbrightest observed emission is blueshifted by ~25 km/s relative to the radial\nvelocity of the star, whereas a spherically symmetric wind has the brightest\nemission at zero radial velocity. Our results show that the bright nebula\nsurrounding W26 must be asymmetric; we suggest it is confined by external ram\npressure from the wind of the nearby supergiant W9. We obtain a lower limit on\nthe nitrogen abundance within the nebula of 2.35 times solar. The line ratio\nstrongly favours photoionization over shock ionization, and so even if the\nobserved nebula is pressure confined there should still be an ionization front\nand a photoionization-confined shell closer to the star. \n\n"}

In complex systems in particular, where intense\nstar formation (SF) coexists with an active galactic nucleus (AGN), it is not\nclear yet from observations whether the SF, the AGN, or both are driving these\noutflows. Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are expected to influence\ntheir host galaxies through kinetic and radiative feedback processes, but in a\nSeyfert galaxy where the energy emitted in the nuclear region is comparable to\nthat of the body of the galaxy, it is possible that stellar activity is also\nplaying a key role in these processes. In order to achieve a better\nunderstanding of the mechanisms driving the gas evolution specially at the\nnuclear regions of these galaxies, we have performed high-resolution\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with radiative cooling considering\nthe feedback from both star formation regions including supernova (type I and\nII) explosions and an AGN jet emerging from the central region of the active\nspiral galaxy.

Previous studies have attempted to explain this excess with spatial\nfluctuations in the ionizing background, but found that this required either\nextremely rare sources or problematically low values for the mean free path of\nionizing photons. Here we report that much -- or potentially all -- of the\nobserved excess likely arises from residual spatial variations in temperature\nthat are an inevitable byproduct of a patchy and extended reionization process.\nThe amplitude of opacity fluctuations generated in this way depends on the\ntiming and duration of reionization. If the entire excess is due to temperature\nvariations alone, the observed fluctuation amplitude favors a late-ending but\nextended reionization process that was roughly half complete by z~9 and that\nended at z~6. In this scenario, the highest opacities occur in regions that\nreionized earliest, since they have had the most time to cool, while the lowest\nopacities occur in the warmer regions that reionized most recently. This\ncorrespondence potentially opens a new observational window into patchy\nreionization. \n\n"}

The observed equivalent width (EW) of\nthe NeVIII doublet show a ~4 sigma variation over a timescale of 2.8 months in\nthe QSO's rest-frame.

An increase in\nthe NeVIII covering fraction from f_c = 0.59\\pm0.05 to 0.72\\pm0.03 is observed\nover the same period. The NeVIII profiles are too highly saturated to be\nsusceptible to changes in the ionization state of the absorbing gas.

We, thus, propose transverse\nmotions of the absorbing gas being the cause of the observed variability. Using\na simple model of a transiting cloud we estimate a transverse speed of ~1800\nkm/s.

Robust detections of Zeeman\nsignatures at all observed epochs indicate a surface magnetic field, with\nlongitudinal magnetic field strengths varying between 1.0-3.2 G. Radial\nvelocity variations from night to night modulate on a similar timescale to the\nlongitudinal magnetic field measurements.

Along the jet axis we find\nstrong velocity reversals where the projected velocity swings from -150 km/s to\n+150 km/s. A simple model of a molecular jet precessing around an axis close to\nthe plane of the sky can reproduce the observations. The velocity of the\noutflowing gas is difficult to constrain due to the velocity reversals but we\nestimate it to be between 240 and 850 km/s and the jet to precess with a period\nP=0.3-1.1 Myr. The CO emission is clumpy along the jet and the total molecular\nmass in the high-velocity (+-(60 to 150 km/s)) gas lies between 2e6 Msun (light\njet) and 2e7 Msun (massive jet). There is also CO emission extending along the\nminor axis of NGC1377.

In this study, we show that these discrepancies\nin the spectrum and the position can be solved if turbulent (re)acceleration is\nvery effective behind the shock. This means that for some relics turbulent\nreacceleration may be the main mechanism to produce high-energy electrons,\ncontrary to the common belief that it is the DSA.

However, despite various attempts to\ndetermine quasar lifetimes, current estimates from a variety of methods are\nuncertain by orders of magnitude. This work combines cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations and 1D radiative transfer to investigate the\nstructure and evolution of the He II Ly$\\alpha$ proximity zones around quasars\nat $z \\simeq 3-4$. We show that the time evolution in the proximity zone can be\ndescribed by a simple analytical model for the approach of the He II fraction\n$x_{\\rm HeII}\\left( t \\right)$ to ionization equilibrium, and use this picture\nto illustrate how the transmission profile depends on the quasar lifetime,\nquasar UV luminosity, and the ionization state of helium in the ambient IGM\n(i.e. the average He II fraction, or equivalently the metagalactic He II\nionizing background). A significant degeneracy exists between the lifetime and\nthe average He II fraction, however the latter can be determined from\nmeasurements of the He II Ly$\\alpha$ optical depth far from quasars, allowing\nthe lifetime to be measured.

For the first time, we study the effect of grain surface\nchemistry (GSC) on star formation and its impact on the initial mass function\n(IMF). We follow a contracting translucent cloud in which we treat the\ngas-grain chemical interplay in detail, including the process of freeze-out. We\nperform 3d hydrodynamical simulations under three different conditions, a pure\ngas-phase model, a freeze-out model, and a complete chemistry model. The models\ndisplay different thermal evolution during cloud collapse. The equation of\nstate (EOS) of the gas becomes softer with CO freeze-out and the results show\nthat at the onset of star formation, the cloud retains its evolution history\nsuch that the number of formed stars differ (by 7%) between the three models.\nWhile the stellar mass distribution results in a different IMF when we consider\npure freeze-out, with the complete treatment of the GSC, the divergence from a\npure gas-phase model is minimal. We find that the impact of freeze-out is\nbalanced by the non-thermal processes; chemical and photodesorption. We also\nfind an average filament width of 0.12 pc ($\\pm$0.03 pc), and speculate that\nthis may be a result from the changes in the EOS caused by the gas-dust thermal\ncoupling.

Seven large flares, including five X-ray flares and two GeV gamma-ray\nflares with variable durations (3-58 days), and one X-ray outburst phase were\nidentified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy\ndistribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase. During the outburst\nphase and the seven flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to\nincrease from sub-keV to few keV. The TeV gamma-ray flux increases up to\n0.9-7.2 times the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV gamma-rays is\nfound to vary depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify\nflares into three groups according to the GeV flux variation.

We\naim to understand how a strong Lya emission line is able to escape from one of\nthose inclined disk galaxies, named Mrk1486 (z=0.0338).

However, as star\nformation in low-mass halos can be easily depressed or even quenched by\nionizing radiation, a turnover is expected at some faint UV magnitudes. Using a\nphysically-motivated analytical model, we quantify reionization feedback\neffects on the LF faint-end shape. We find that if reionization feedback is\nneglected, the power-law Schechter parameterization characterizing the LF\nfaint-end remains valid up to absolute UV magnitude $\\sim -9$. If instead\nradiative feedback is strong enough that quenches star formation in halos with\ncircular velocity smaller than 50 km s$^{-1}$, the LF starts to drop at\nabsolute UV magnitude $\\sim -15$, i.e. slightly below the detection limits of\ncurrent (unlensed) surveys at $z\\sim5$.

We suggest that the galaxy number counts data,\nparticularly in lensed fields, can put strong constraints on reionization\nfeedback. In models with stronger reionization feedback, stars in galaxies with\nabsolute UV magnitude higher than $\\sim -13$ and smaller than $\\sim - 8$ are\ntypically older.

An important systematic\nconcern for these surveys is line confusion from foreground or background\ngalaxies emitting in other lines that happen to lie at the same observed\nfrequency as the \"target\" emission line of interest. We develop an approach to\nseparate this \"interloper\" emission at the power spectrum level. If one adopts\nthe redshift of the target emission line in mapping from observed frequency and\nangle on the sky to co-moving units, the interloper emission is mapped to the\nwrong co-moving coordinates. Since the mapping is different in the line of\nsight and transverse directions, the interloper contribution to the power\nspectrum becomes anisotropic, especially if the interloper and target emission\nare at widely separated redshifts. This distortion is analogous to the\nAlcock-Paczynski test, but here the warping arises from assuming the wrong\nredshift rather than an incorrect cosmological model. We apply this to the case\nof a hypothetical [CII] emission survey at z~7 and find that the distinctive\ninterloper anisotropy can, in principle, be used to separate strong foreground\nCO emission fluctuations. In our models, however, a significantly more\nsensitive instrument than currently planned is required, although there are\nlarge uncertainties in forecasting the high redshift [CII] emission signal.\nWith upcoming surveys, it may nevertheless be useful to apply this approach\nafter first masking pixels suspected of containing strong interloper\ncontamination. \n\n"}

We show that long-lasting configurations of gas with 5 < t_cool /\nt_ff < 20 and radial entropy profiles similar to observations of local\ncool-core galaxy cluster cores are a natural outcome of precipitation-regulated\nfeedback.

But few pieces of observational evidence have been\nconfirmed directly demonstrating the existence of the inflows. The absorption\nline system in the spectra of quasar SDSS J112526.12+002901.3 presents an\ninteresting example, in which the rarely detected hydrogen Balmer and\nmetastable He I absorption lines are found redshifted to the quasar's rest\nframe along with the low-ionization metal absorption lines Mg II, Fe II, etc.\nThe repeated SDSS spectroscopic observations suggest a transverse velocity\nsmaller than the radial velocity.

We allow for repulsive self-interaction.\nIn a Lambda-SFDM universe, SFDM starts relativistic, evolving from stiff (w=1)\nto radiation-like (w=1/3), becoming nonrelativistic (w=0) at late times. Thus,\na stiff-SFDM-dominated era precedes the familiar radiation-dominated era. SFDM\nparticle mass $m$ and quartic self-interaction strength \\lambda, are therefore\nconstrained by cosmological observables, N_{eff}, the effective number of\nneutrino species during BBN, and z_{eq}, the matter-radiation equality\nredshift. Since the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from\ninflation is amplified during the stiff-SFDM-dominated era, it can also\ncontribute a radiationlike component large enough to affect these observables.\nRemarkably, this amplification makes this SGWB detectable by current GW\nexperiments, e.g., aLIGO/Virgo and LISA, for Lambda-SFDM models satisfying\ncosmological constraints, for a range of reheat temperatures T_{re} and\ncurrently allowed values of tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. For given r and\n$\\lambda/(mc^2)^2$, the marginally-allowed Lambda-SFDM model for each T_{re}\nhas the smallest m that satisfies cosmological constraints.

They also provide insights on close binary\nevolution and hierarchical structure formation. Sub-parsec BBHs cannot be\nspatially resolved but indirect methods can identify candidates. In 2015 Liu et\nal. reported an optical-continuum periodicity in the quasar PSO\nJ334.2028+01.4075, with the estimated mass and rest-frame period suggesting an\norbital separation of about 0.006 pc (0.7 micro-arcsec).

The total stellar mass content of the simulated clusters\nagrees with observations, but central cluster galaxies are too massive, by up\nto 0.6 dex. Passive satellite fractions are higher than in the field, and at\nstellar masses Mstar > 10^10 M_Sun this environmental effect is quantitatively\nconsistent with observations. The predicted satellite stellar mass function\nmatches data from local cluster surveys. Normalized to total mass, there are\nfewer low-mass (Mstar < 10^10 M_Sun) galaxies within the virial radius of\nclusters than in the field, primarily due to star formation quenching.\nConversely, the simulations predict an overabundance of massive galaxies in\nclusters compared to the field that persists to their far outskirts (>\n5r_200c). This is caused by a significantly increased stellar mass fraction of\n(sub-)haloes in the cluster environment, by up to ~0.3 dex even well beyond\nr_200c.

This work requires a database\nof multiwavelength imagery and photometry that greatly exceeds the scope (in\nterms of wavelength coverage and number of galaxies) of any previous\nlocal-Universe survey. We constructed a database containing our own custom\nHerschel reductions, along with standardised archival observations from GALEX,\nSDSS, DSS, 2MASS, WISE, Spitzer, and Planck. Using these data, we performed\nconsistent aperture-matched photometry, which we combined with external\nsupplementary photometry from IRAS and Planck. We present our multiwavelength\nimagery and photometry across 42 UV-microwave bands for the 875 DustPedia\ngalaxies. Our aperture-matched photometry, combined with the external\nsupplementary photometry, represents a total of 21,857 photometric\nmeasurements. A typical DustPedia galaxy has multiwavelength photometry\nspanning 25 bands.

We\nhave derived dust corrections based on the observed [Zn/Fe], [Si/Fe], or\n[S/Fe], and confirmed their robustness. We present dust-corrected metallicities\nin a scale of [Fe/H]$_{\\rm tot}$ for 236 DLAs over a broad range of $z$, and\nassess the extent of dust corrections for different metals at different\nmetallicities.

In this work we\ninvestigate theoretically the mass-loss properties of H-free WR stars of the\nnitrogen sequence (WN stars). We connect stellar structure models for He stars\nwith wind models for optically-thick winds and assess how both types of models\ncan simultaneously fulfill their respective sonic-point conditions. Fixing the\nouter wind law and terminal wind velocity, we obtain unique solutions for the\nmass-loss rates of optically-thick, radiatively-driven winds of WR stars in the\nphase of core He-burning. The resulting mass-loss relations as a function of\nstellar parameters, agree well with previous empirical relations. Furthermore,\nwe encounter stellar mass limits below which no continuous solutions exist.\nWhile these mass limits agree with observations of WR stars in the Galaxy, they\nare in conflict with observations in the LMC. While our results confirm in\nparticular the slope of oft-used empirical mass-loss relations, they imply that\nonly part of the observed WN population can be understood in the framework of\nthe standard assumptions of a smooth transonic flow and compact stellar core.\nThis means that alternative approaches, such as a clumped and inflated wind\nstructure, or deviations from the diffusion limit at the sonic point may have\nto be invoked.

Bayesian\n  Generalised Lomb-Scargle Periodogram with Trend Abstract: Period estimation is one of the central topics in astronomical time series\nanalysis, where data is often unevenly sampled. Especially challenging are\nstudies of stellar magnetic cycles, as there the periods looked for are of the\norder of the same length than the datasets themselves. The datasets often\ncontain trends, the origin of which is either a real long-term cycle or an\ninstrumental effect, but these effects cannot be reliably separated, while they\ncan lead to erroneous period determinations if not properly handled. In this\nstudy we aim at developing a method that can handle the trends properly, and by\nperforming extensive set of testing, we show that this is the optimal procedure\nwhen contrasted with methods that do not include the trend directly to the\nmodel. The effect of the form of the noise (whether constant or\nheteroscedastic) on the results is also investigated. We introduce a Bayesian\nGeneralised Lomb-Scargle Periodogram with Trend (BGLST), which is a\nprobabilistic linear regression model using Gaussian priors for the\ncoefficients and uniform prior for the frequency parameter. We show, using\nsynthetic data, that when there is no prior information on whether and to what\nextent the true model of the data contains a linear trend, the introduced BGLST\nmethod is preferable to the methods which either detrend the data or leave the\ndata untrended before fitting the periodic model.

In the latter case, the recent discovery of\nthe binary neutron star (NS-NS) merger in the gravitational wave observation\nmade by LIGO (GW170817), and the detection of associated electromagnetic\ncounterparts, for the first time gave a direct proof of the NS-NS merger being\na progenitor of a short GRB.\n  In general, all GRBs are believed to be powered by accretion through a\nrotationally supported torus, or by fast rotation of a compact object. For long\nones, the rotation of the progenitor star is a key property in order to support\naccretion over relatively long activity periods, and also to sustain the\nrotation of the black hole itself. The latter is responsible for ejection of\nthe relativistic jets, which are powered due to the extraction of the BH\nrotational energy, mitigated by the accretion torus and magnetic fields.

This\nproperty has motivated its recent use in multiple tests of GR. Recent work has\nsuggested that the magnification bias of galaxies due to foreground matter\nperturbations breaks the bias-independence of the $E_G$ statistic. The\nmagnitude of this effect is very sensitive to the clustering and magnification\nbiases of the galaxy sample. We show that for realistic values of the\nclustering and magnification biases, the effect for magnification bias is small\nrelative to statistical errors for most spectroscopic galaxy surveys but large\nfor photometric galaxy surveys. For the cases with significant magnification\nbias, we propose a method to calibrate magnification bias using measurements of\nthe lensing auto-power spectrum. We test this calibration method using\nsimulations, finding that our calibration method can calibrate $E_G$ from 2-4\ntimes the simulation error to well within the errors, although its accuracy is\nsensitive to the precision of the measured redshift distribution and\nmagnification bias, but not the clustering bias.

One could test each theory against observed data one at a\ntime, though a more efficient approach would be to first probe gravity in a\ntheory-agnostic way and map such information to that on specific theories\nafterward. One example of such model-independent tests with gravitational waves\nis the parameterized post-Einsteinian formalism, where one introduces generic\nparameters in the amplitude and phase that capture non-Einsteinian effects. In\nthis paper, we derive gravitational waveforms from inspiraling compact binaries\nin various modified theories of gravity that violate at least one fundamental\npillar in general relativity. We achieve this by deriving relations between\ncorrections to the waveform amplitude/phase and those to the frequency\nevolution and Kepler's third law, since the latter two have already been (or\ncan easily be) derived in many theories.

Even the evaluation of the jet power is not trivial, since\nthe radiation from the jet is enhanced by relativistic beaming, and there are\nfundamental uncertainties concerning the matter content of the jet\n(electron--proton or electron--positron plasma). However, in recent years,\nthere have been crucial advances mainly driven by the richness of data in the\n$\\gamma$-ray band. This is the band where blazars emit most of their\nelectromagnetic power. Furthermore, there are now large sample of $\\gamma$-ray\nloud blazars covered by optical spectroscopy. For the blazar sub-class of flat\nspectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) these data provide measurements of the main\nemission lines and of the underlying continuum. From these data, it is\nrelatively easy to infer the bolometric luminosity of the accretion disk. The\nrelativistic jet emission on one hand, and the disk luminosity on the other\nhand, allows us to compare the jet power and the accretion luminosity.

Today we also have\ninformation on isotopic abundances, which show some anomalies, as compared with\nthe interstellar medium. The known spectrum extends over energies from a few\nhundred MeV to 3*10^{20} eV and shows few clear spectral signatures: There is a\nsmall spectral break near 5*10^{15} eV, the \"knee\", where the spectrum turns\ndown; there is another spectral break near 3*10^{18} eV, the \"ankle\", where the\nspectrum turns up again. Up to the ankle the cosmic rays are usually\ninterpreted as originating from Galactic supernova explosions; however, we do\nnot know what the origin of the knee is. The particles beyond the ankle have to\nbe extragalactic, it is usually assumed, because the Larmor radii in the\nGalactic magnetic field are too large; this argument could be overcome if those\nparticles were very heavy nuclei as Fe, an idea which appears to be\ninconsistent, however, with the airshower data immediately above the energy of\nthe ankle. Due to interaction with the cosmic microwave background there is a\nstrong cut-off expected near 5*10^{19} eV, which is, however, not seen; The\nhigh energy cosmic rays beyond this \"GZK-cutoff\" (after its discoverers\nGreisen, Zatsepin and Kuzmin) are the challenge to interpret.

This faint (V=22.3) blue\n(V-I=0.7) star shows a large amplitude (60-70%) sinusoidal variation in both V\nand I. The period (3.19066 hr) and phase of the variation match those of the\nMSP 47 Tuc W (which does not have an accurate radio timing position) to within\n0.5 seconds and 1.2 minutes respectively, well within the ~1sigma errors.

In agreement\nwith previous studies, we find that relativistic jets are collimated by their\npassage through the stellar mantle. Interaction of these jets with the star and\ntheir own cocoons also causes mixing that sporadically decelerates the flow. We\nspeculate that this mixing instability is chiefly responsible for the variable\nLorentz factor needed in the internal shock model and for the complex light\ncurves seen in many GRBs. In all cases studied, the jet is shocked deep inside\nthe star following a brief period of adiabatic expansion. The jet that finally\nemerges from the star thus has a moderate Lorentz factor, modulated by mixing,\nand a very large internal energy. In a second series of calculations, we follow\nthe escape of that sort of jet. Because of the large ratio of internal to\nkinetic energy in both the jet and its cocoon, the opening angle of the final\njet is significantly greater than at breakout. A small amount of material\nemerges at large angles, but with a Lorentz factor still sufficiently large to\nmake a weak GRB. This leads us to propose a \"unified model\" in which a variety\nof high energy transients, ranging from x-ray flashes to \"classic\" GRBs, may be\nseen depending upon the angle at which a standard collapsar is observed. We\nalso speculate that the breakout of a relativistic jet and its collision with\nthe stellar wind will produce a brief transient with properties similar to the\nclass of \"short-hard\" GRBs.

Cooling leads to the condensation of gas\nin the inner regions of clusters, which in turn leads to steepening of the dark\nmatter profile. The cooling gas is replaced by the higher-entropy gas from the\nouter regions, which raises the entropy and temperature of gas in the cluster\ncore. The magnitude of these effects is likely overestimated in the current\nsimulations because they suffer from the overcooling problem: a much larger\nfraction of baryons is in the form of cold gas and stars than is observed. We\nfind that the thermal stellar feedback alone does not remedy this problem.\nAdditional ad-hoc preheating can lower the amount of cold gas but a simple\nuniform preheating results in incorrect star formation history, as it delays\nthe bulk of star formation until z<1. Our analysis shows that the overcooling\nin a cluster as a whole is really the overcooling in the central galaxy and its\nprogenitors at high redshifts.

We find that the M/L ratio decreases\nwith redshift: in particular, the average M/L ratio of early type galaxies\ndecreases with $z$, with a scatter that is indicative of a range of\nstar--formation time-scales and redshift of formation. More important, the\ntypical M/L of massive early type galaxies is larger than that of less massive\nones, suggesting that their stellar population formed at higher z.

We have employed\nthe 2-integral DFs given by Dejonghe & de Zeeuw for which flattened\nnon-rotating models are characterized by counter-streaming motion and are\nradially cool; we introduce net rotation in some models by changing the sign of\nthe z-component of angular momentum for a fraction of the particles. We have\nfound that all non-rotating and slowly rotating members of this sequence\nrounder than E7 are stable, and that even maximally rotating models rounder\nthan E4 are stable. In the absence of strong rotation, the most disruptive\ninstability, and the last to be stabilized by increasing thickness, is a\nlopsided (m=1) mode. This instability appears to be driven by counter-rotation\nin radially cool models. Its vigour is lessened as rotation is increased, but\nit remains strong even in models with net angular momentum 90% of that of a\nmaximally rotating model before finally disappearing in maximally rotating\nmodels. Strongly rotating models are more unstable to bar-forming modes which\nafflict maximally rotating models with c/a >~ 0.5, but this mode is quickly\nstabilized by moderate fractions of counter-rotating particles. Bending\ninstabilities appear not to be very important; they are detectable in the inner\nparts of the flatter models, but are less vigorous and more easily stabilized\nthan the lop-sided or bar modes in every case. We briefly discuss the possible\nrelevance of the lop-sided instability to the existence of many lop-sided disk\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

Simple formation models tuned to give good fits to low redshift\ngalaxies can predict the distribution of these quantities in the LBG\npopulation. The LBGs should be small (with typical half-light radii of 0.6-2\nkpc/h), should inhabit haloes of moderately high circular velocity (180-290\nkm/s) but have low stellar velocity dispersions (70-120 km/s) and should have\nsubstantial star formation rates (15-100 Msun/yr). The numbers here refer to\nthe predicted median values in the LBG sample of Adelberger et al. (1998); the\nfirst assumes an Omega=1 universe and the second a flat universe with\nOmega=0.3. For either cosmology these predictions are consistent with the\ncurrent (rather limited) observational data.

The\nregular part of the polarization operator is extracted from the realistic\nkaon-nucleon interaction based on the chiral and 1/N_c expansion. Contributions\nof the Lambda(1116), Sigma(1195), Sigma*(1385) resonances are taken explicitly\ninto account in the pole and regular terms with inclusion of mean-field\npotentials. The baryon-baryon correlations are incorporated and fluctuation\ncontributions are estimated. Results are applied for K- in neutron star matter.\nWithin our model a second-order phase transition to the s-wave K- condensate\nstate occurs at $rho_c \\gsim 4 \\rho_0$ once the baryon-baryon correlations are\nincluded. We show that the second-order phase transition to the p-wave $K^-$\ncondensate state may occur at densities $\\rho_c \\sim 3\\div 5 \\rho_0$ in\ndependence on the parameter choice. We demonstrate that a first-order phase\ntransition to a proton-enriched (approximately isospin-symmetric) nucleon\nmatter with a p-wave K- condensate can occur at smaller densities, $\\rho\\lsim 2\n\\rho_0$. The transition is accompanied by the suppression of hyperon\nconcentrations. \n\n"}

Interesting and\ninspiring new directions are also highlighted, including for example source\nimaging, lepton and photon interferometry, non-Gaussian shape analysis as well\nas many other new directions. Existing models are compared to two-particle\ncorrelation measurements and the so-called RHIC HBT puzzle is resolved.\nEvidence for a (directional) Hubble flow is presented and the conclusion is\nconfirmed by a successful description of the pseudorapidity dependence of the\nelliptic flow as measured in Au+Au collisions by the PHOBOS Collaboration. \n\n"}
