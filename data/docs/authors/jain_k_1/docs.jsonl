Aims: We\ntest whether downsizing is caused by activity shifting towards low-mass black\nholes accreting at near-Eddington rates, or by a change in the average rate of\naccretion onto supermassive black holes. We estimate the black hole masses and\nEddington ratios of an X-ray selected sample of AGN in the Chandra Deep Field\nSouth at z<1, probing the epoch where AGN cosmic downsizing has been reported.\nMethods: Black hole masses are estimated both from host galaxy stellar masses,\nwhich are estimated from fitting to published optical and near-infrared\nphotometry, and from near-infrared luminosities, applying established\ncorrelations between black hole mass and host galaxy properties. Both methods\ngive consistent results. Comparison and calibration of possible\nredshift-dependent effects is also made using published faint host galaxy\nvelocity dispersion measurements. Results: The Eddington ratios in our sample\nspan the range 10^{-5} to 1, with median log(L_bol/L_Edd)=-2.87, and with\ntypical black hole masses about 10^{8} solar masses.

Selection wins this\ncompetition if mutations performed at birth are few enough. By slowly\nincreasing the average number m of mutations, however, the population suddenly\nundergoes a mutational degradation precisely at a transition point mc. Above\nthis point, the \"bad\" alleles spread over the genetic pool of the population,\novercoming the selection pressure. Individuals become selectively alike, and\nevolution stops.

This is the finite population version of\nKingman's house of cards model [J.F.C. Kingman, \\textit{J. Appl. Probab.}\n\\textbf{15}, 1 (1978)]. In contrast to Kingman's work, the focus here is on\nunbounded distributions $g(w)$ which lead to an indefinite growth of the\npopulation fitness. The model is solved analytically in the limit of infinite\npopulation size $N \\to \\infty$ and simulated numerically for finite $N$. When\nthe genome-wide mutation probability $U$ is small, the long time behavior of\nthe model reduces to a point process of fixation events, which is referred to\nas a \\textit{diluted record process} (DRP). The DRP is similar to the standard\nrecord process except that a new record candidate (a number that exceeds all\nprevious entries in the sequence) is accepted only with a certain probability\nthat depends on the values of the current record and the candidate. We develop\na systematic analytic approximation scheme for the DRP.

BH scaling relations and the AGN luminosity function Abstract: We model the cosmological co-evolution of galaxies and their central\nsupermassive black holes (BHs) within a semi-analytical framework developed on\nthe outputs of the Millennium Simulation. This model, described in detail in\nCroton et al. (2006) and De Lucia & Blaizot (2007), introduces a `radio mode'\nfeedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at the centre of X-ray emitting\natmospheres in galaxy groups and clusters. Thanks to this mechanism, the model\ncan simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling\nflows; (ii) the exponential cut-off in the bright end of the galaxy luminosity\nfunction; and (iii) the bulge-dominated morphologies and old stellar ages of\nthe most massive galaxies in clusters. This paper is the first of a series in\nwhich we investigate how well this model can also reproduce the physical\nproperties of BHs and AGN. Here we analyze the scaling relations, the\nfundamental plane and the mass function of BHs, and compare them with the most\nrecent observational data.

In the model considered, Boolean networks\nevolve via a competition between nodes that punishes those in the majority. It\nis found that finite size networks evolve in a fundamentally different way than\ninfinitely large networks do. The symmetry of the evolutionary dynamics of\ninfinitely large networks that selects for canalizing Boolean functions is\nbroken in the evolutionary dynamics of finite size networks. In finite size\nnetworks there is an additional selection for input inverting Boolean functions\nthat output a value opposite to the majority of input values. These results are\nrevealed through an empirical study of the model that calculates the frequency\nof occurrence of the different possible Boolean functions. Classes of functions\nare found to occur with the same frequency. Those classes depend on the\nsymmetry of the evolutionary dynamics and correspond to orbits of the relevant\nsymmetry group. The empirical results match analytic results, determined by\nutilizing Polya's theorem, for the number of orbits expected in both finite\nsize and infinitely large networks. The reason for the symmetry breaking in the\nevolutionary dynamics is found to be due to the need for nodes in finite size\nnetworks to behave differently in order to cooperate so that the system\ncollectively performs as well as possible. The results suggest that both finite\nsize effects and symmetry are important for understanding the evolution of\nreal-world complex networks, including genetic regulatory networks. \n\n"}

The dynamical system for development is\nshaped through genetic evolution following natural selection based on the\nfitness of the phenotype.

When\nconsidered over sparse random graphs, the phase structure of the graph\nbisection problem displays certain familiar properties, but also some\nsurprises.

In this paper we investigate the existence of\nrealistic chances of such a discovery selecting some nearby dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies (dSph) as a target. We study the detectability with the Fermi-LAT of\nthe gamma-ray flux from DM annihilation in Draco, Ursa Minor, Carina, and\nSextans, for which the state-of-art DM density profiles were available. We\nassume the DM is made of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles such as the\nLightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) and compute the expected gamma-ray flux\nfor optimistic choices of the unknown underlying particle physics parameters.\nWe then compute the boost factors due to the presence of DM clumps and of a\ncentral supermassive black hole.

The population is\ndescribed by a continuous limit of the stepping stone model, which leads to the\nstochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov equation with additional terms\ndescribing mutations. Although the stepping stone model was first proposed for\npopulation genetics, it is closely related to \"voter models\" of interest in\nnonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The stepping stone model can also be\nregarded as an approximation to the dynamics of a thin layer of actively\ngrowing pioneers at the frontier of a colony of microorganisms undergoing a\nrange expansion on a Petri dish. We find that the population tends to segregate\ninto monoallelic domains. This segregation slows down genetic drift and\nselection because these two evolutionary forces can only act at the boundaries\nbetween the domains; the effects of mutation, however, are not significantly\naffected by the segregation.

In the latter sense\neach source occupies a region (bin) in the FWHM(H-beta) vs. optical FeII\nstrength plane that is significantly different from the others.

We\ncan adequately model all broad lines assuming the existence of three components\ndistinguished by blueshifted, unshifted and redshifted centroids (indicated as\nblue, broad and very broad component respectively). The broad component (high\nelectron density, low ionization parameter; high column density) is present in\nalmost all type-1 quasars and therefore corresponds most closely to the\nclassical broad line emitting region (the reverberating component). The blue\ncomponent emission (lower electron density; high ionization; low column\ndensity) arises in less optically thick gas; it is often thought to arise in an\naccretion disk wind.

Usual models introduce nonlinearities in the\nmacroscopic dynamics of the ecosystem that lead to different stable attractors\namong which the shift takes place. Here we propose an alternative explanation\nof catastrophic regime shifts based on a recent model that pictures ecological\ncommunities as systems in continuous fluctuation, according to certain\ntransition probabilities, between different micro-states in the phase space of\nviable communities.

Abstract: We have recently applied the second law to an isolated system, consisting of\na system {\\Sigma} such as a glass surrounded by an extremely large medium\n{\\Sigma}, to show that the instantaneous temperature T(t), thermodynamic\nentropy S(T_0,t) and enthalpy H(T_0,t) of {\\Sigma} decrease in any isothermal\nrelaxation towards their respective equilibrium values under isobaric cooling.\nThe Gibbs statistical entropy also conforms to the above relaxation behavior in\na glass, which however is contrary to the conjecture by Gupta, Mauro and\ncoworkers that the glass transition and the structural relaxation are inverse\nprocesses. However, they do not establish that the entropy loss during the\nglass transition is accompanied by a concomitant entropy gain of the medium to\nmaintain the second law. They use a novel statistical formulation of entropy\nbased on several conjectures such as it being zero for a microstate, but do not\ncompare its behavior with the thermodynamic entropy. The formulation is\ndesigned to show the entropy loss. Its subsequent rise not only contradicts our\nresult but also implies that the glass during relaxation must have a negative\nabsolute temperature. To understand these puzzling results and the above\nconjecture, we have carried out a critical evaluation of their unconventional\napproach. We find that the inverse conjecture is neither supported by their\napproach nor by the second law. The zero-entropy microstate conjecture is only\nconsistent with S(T_0,t)\\equiv 0 at all temperatures, not just at absolute zero\nand is found to have no scientific merit. We show that the maximum entropy gain\nof the medium during the glass transition invalidates the entropy loss\nconjecture. After pointing out other misleading, confusing and highly\nexaggerated statements in their work, we finally conclude that their\nunconventional statistical approach and computational scheme are not\nappropriate for glasses. \n\n"}

It takes into\naccount both galaxy evolution and the perturbing effects of large scale\nstructure. The key to the algorithm is a maximum likelihood (ML) method for\njointly estimating both the luminosity function (LF) and the overdensity as a\nfunction of redshift. The random catalogue algorithm then works by cloning each\ngalaxy in the original catalogue, with the number of clones determined by the\nML solution. Each of these cloned galaxies is then assigned a random redshift\nuniformly distributed over the accessible survey volume, taking account of the\nsurvey magnitude limit(s) and, optionally, both luminosity and number density\nevolution. The resulting random catalogues, which can be employed in\ntraditional estimates of galaxy clustering, make fuller use of the information\navailable in the original catalogue and hence are superior to simply fitting a\nfunctional form to the observed redshift distribution. They are particularly\nwell suited to studies of the dependence of galaxy clustering on galaxy\nproperties as each galaxy in the random catalogue has the same list of\nattributes as measured for the galaxies in the genuine catalogue. The\nderivation of the joint overdensity and LF estimator reveals the limit in which\nthe ML estimate reduces to the standard 1/Vmax LF estimate, namely when one\nmakes the prior assumption that the are no fluctuations in the radial\noverdensity.

The distance to the source,\nits transient nature, and high internal column density serve to complicate\nseveral means of estimating the mass of the black hole. Utilizing newly-refined\nrelationships between black hole mass, radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity,\nand de-beaming the source flux, a weak constraint on the black hole mass is\nobtained: log(M/Msun) = 5.5 +/- 1.1 (1 sigma confidence). The confidence\ninterval is determined from the current intrinsic scatter in the relation,\nwhich includes effects from X-ray variability and accretion modes. This mass\nrange is broad, but it includes low values that are consistent with some\nvariability arguments, and it safely excludes high mass values where it becomes\nimpossible for black holes to disrupt stars.

Unlike most traditional\napproaches to the dark-matter problem which hypothesize the existence of one or\nmore stable dark-matter particles, our dynamical dark-matter framework is\ncharacterized by the fact that the requirement of stability is replaced by a\ndelicate balancing between cosmological abundances and lifetimes across a vast\nensemble of individual dark-matter components.

In the late time Universe\nwhen reionisation occurs, the spectrum of the 21cm brightness temperature is\nthus affected. We study this effect for chameleon-f(R) models, dilatons and\nsymmetrons.

In our model, cooperators and defectors interact as in the\nclassical prisoner's dilemma game, where selection favors defection. However,\nhere the presence of a small number of cooperation facilitators enhances the\nfitness (reproductive potential) of cooperators, while it does not alter that\nof defectors. In a finite population of size N, the dynamics of the prisoner's\ndilemma with facilitators is characterized by the probability that cooperation\ntakes over (fixation probability) and by the mean times to reach the absorbing\nstates. These quantities are computed exactly and using Fokker-Planck\nequations. Our findings, corroborated by stochastic simulations, demonstrate\nthat the influence of facilitators crucially depends on the difference between\ntheir density z and the game's cost-to-benefit ratio r.

Below a critical energy\nE_c, depending on the initial condition, this distribution is Vlasov\ndynamically unstable.

The proposed dynamic is a generalization of the discrete replicator\ndynamic. The replicator dynamic has been successfully used to extract dense\nclusters of graphs; however, it is often sensitive to the degree distribution\nof a graph, and usually biased by vertices with large degrees, thus may fail to\ndetect the densest cluster. To overcome this problem, we introduce a dynamic\nparameter, called path parameter, into the evolution process. The path\nparameter can be interpreted as the maximal possible probability of a current\ncluster containing a vertex, and it monotonically increases as evolution\nprocess proceeds. By limiting the maximal probability, the phenomenon of some\nvertices dominating the early stage of evolution process is suppressed, thus\nmaking evolution process more robust. To solve the optimization problem with a\nfixed path parameter, we propose an efficient fixed point algorithm. The time\ncomplexity of the path following replicator dynamic is only linear in the\nnumber of edges of a graph, thus it can analyze graphs with millions of\nvertices and tens of millions of edges on a common PC in a few minutes.\nBesides, it can be naturally generalized to hypergraph and graph with edges of\ndifferent orders.

Such scenarios are generated by either a particular\nscalar field (the tachyon field) or the anti-Chaplygin gas.

After removing compact X-ray features, diffuse X-ray\nemission is clearly detected and is well reproduced by a three-component\nspectral model consisting of unabsorbed thermal emission (temperature kT ~0.1\nkeV from the Local Bubble (LB), absorbed kT ~0.3 keV thermal emission related\nto the NPS and/or Galactic Halo (GH), and a power-law component at a level\nconsistent with the cosmic X-ray background. The emission measure (EM) of the\n0.3 keV plasma decreases by ~50% toward the inner regions of the north-east\nbubble, with no accompanying temperature change. However, such a jump in the EM\nis not clearly seen in the south bubble data.

These\nswing provided the strongest confirmation of the pulsar recycling scenario\navailable so far. During the two XMM-Newton observations that were carried out\nwhile the source was in outburst in April 2013, IGR J18245-2452 displayed a\nunique and peculiar variability of its X-ray emission. In this work, we report\non a detailed analysis of the XMM- Newton data and focus in particular on the\ntiming and spectral variability of the source. IGR J18245-2452 continuously\nswitches between lower and higher intensity states, with typical variations in\nflux up to a factor of about 500 in time scales as short as few seconds. These\nvariations in the source intensity are sometimes associated to a dramatic\nspectral hardening, during which the power-law photon index of the source\nchanges from Gamma=1.7 to Gamma=0.9. The pulse profiles extracted at different\ncount rates and energies show a complex variability. These phenomena are not\nusually observed in accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, at least not on such a\nshort time scale. Fast variability was also found in the ATCA radio\nobservations carried out for about 6 hours during the outburst at a frequency\nof 5.5 and 9 GHz.

We present a numerical study of a\nminimal model that supports bistability and catastrophic shift on spatial\ndomain with demographic noise and an absorbing state. When the external\nparameter varies adiabatically the transition is continuous and the front\nvelocity renormalizes to zero at the extinction transition. Below the\ntransition one may identify three modes of desertification: accumulation of\nlocal catastrophes, desert invasion and global collapse.

Distant regions may be either out of phase or cycling through different\nfood web subloops (if any). Here we show that upon replacing a minimum fraction\n$Q_c$ of the short range interactions by long range ones, there is a Hopf\nbifurcation and global oscillations become stable.

Spreading at a\nconstant speed is generally predicted when dispersal is sufficiently\nshort-ranged. However, the case of long-range dispersal is unresolved: While it\nis clear that even rare long-range jumps can lead to a drastic speedup, it has\nbeen difficult to quantify the ensuing stochastic growth process.

Further, we show that the use of effective masses to\ncharacterize repulsive regions can lead to coordinate-dependent results\nwhereas, in our approach, repulsion emerges as a consequence of the spacetime\ngeometry in a completely invariant way. Our definition is tested in the\nspacetime of an electrically charged Kerr naked singularity and in all its\nlimiting cases. We show that a positive mass can generate repulsive gravity if\nit is equipped with an electric charge or an angular momentum. We obtain\nreasonable results for the spacetime regions contained inside the repulsion\nsphere whose size and shape depend on the value of the mass, charge and angular\nmomentum. Consequently, we define repulsive gravity as a classical relativistic\neffect by using the geometry of spacetime only. \n\n"}

Understanding the extent and the form that these\nevolutionary constraints may take is important to interpret the information in\nprotein sequences. To study this problem, we introduce a simple but physical\nmodel of protein evolution where selection targets allostery, the functional\ncoupling of distal sites on protein surfaces. This model shows how the\ngeometrical organization of couplings between amino acids within a protein\nstructure can depend crucially on its evolutionary history. In particular, two\nscenarios are found to generate a spatial concentration of functional\nconstraints: high mutation rates and fluctuating selective pressures. This\nsecond scenario offers a plausible explanation for the high tolerance of\nnatural proteins to mutations and for the spatial organization of their least\ntolerant amino acids, as revealed by sequence analyses and mutagenesis\nexperiments. It also implies a faculty to adapt to new selective pressures that\nis consistent with observations. Besides, the model illustrates how several\nindependent functional modules may emerge within a same protein structure,\ndepending on the nature of past environmental fluctuations. Our model thus\nrelates the evolutionary history and evolutionary potential of proteins to the\ngeometry of their functional constraints, with implications for decoding and\nengineering protein sequences. \n\n"}

The utility earned by each player depends on the\nfull random vector and on the actions of others. An example is a game where\ndifferent rewards are placed over multiple locations, each player only knows\nthe rewards in a subset of the locations, and players compete to collect the\nrewards. Sharing information can help others, but can also increase competition\nfor desirable locations. Standard Nash equilibrium and correlated equilibrium\nconcepts are inadequate in this scenario. Instead, this paper develops an\nalgorithm where, every round, all players pass their information and intended\nactions to a game manager. The manager provides suggested actions for each\nplayer that, if taken, maximize a concave function of average utilities subject\nto the constraint that each player gets an average utility no worse than it\nwould get without sharing.

Our simulations are based on the general relativistic hydrodynamics\ncode AGILE combined with the detailed neutrino transport scheme IDSA for\nelectron neutrinos and ALS for the muon and tau neutrinos.

The PUSH method locally increases the energy\ndeposition in the gain region through energy deposition by the heavy neutrino\nflavors. Our setup allows us to model the explosion for several seconds after\ncore bounce. We explore the progenitor range 18-21M$_{\\odot}$. Our studies\nreveal a distinction between high compactness (HC) and low compactness (LC)\nprogenitor models, where LC models tend to explore earlier, with a lower\nexplosion energy, and with a lower remnant mass.

We also discuss\ntantalising evidence of a potentially related, vastly-extended, nebulosity. The\n2014 eruption was discovered, before optical maximum, on October 2, 2014. We\nfind that the optical properties of M31N 2008-12a evolve faster than all\nGalactic recurrent novae known, and all its eruptions show remarkable\nsimilarity both photometrically and spectroscopically.

Direct reciprocity requires that\nindividuals keep track of their past interactions and find the right response.\nHowever, there are natural bounds on strategic complexity: Humans find it\ndifficult to remember past interactions accurately, especially over long\ntimespans. Given these limitations, it is natural to ask how complex strategies\nneed to be for cooperation to evolve.

Below the breaking energy, the Band function\nreduces to a cut-off power law, while above the breaking energy it is a simple\npower law. However, for some detectors (such as the Swift-BAT) whose working\nenergy is well below or just near the breaking energy, the observed spectra can\nbe fitted to cut-off power law with enough precision. Besides, since the energy\nband of Swift-BAT is very narrow, the spectra of most GRBs can be fitted well\neven using a simple power law. In this paper, with the most up-to-date sample\nof Swift-BAT GRBs, we study the effect of different spectral models on the\nempirical luminosity correlations, and further investigate the effect on the\nreconstruction of GRB Hubble diagram. We mainly focus on two luminosity\ncorrelations, i.e., the Amati relation and Yonetoku relation. We calculate\nthese two luminosity correlations on both the case that the GRB spectra are\nmodeled by Band function and cut-off power law. It is found that both\nluminosity correlations only moderately depend on the choice of GRB spectra.\nMonte Carlo simulations show that Amati relation is insensitive to the\nhigh-energy power-law index of the Band function. As a result, the GRB Hubble\ndiagram calibrated using luminosity correlations is almost independent on the\nGRB spectra. \n\n"}

The convective luminosity in the\nburning shells of carbon, neon, oxygen, and then silicon, are very high.

Magnetic flux tubes might buoy outward, and deposit\ntheir energy in the outer parts of the envelope. This in turn might lead to the\nexpansion of the envelope and to an enhanced mass loss rate.

Using data from the core of 47 Tuc in the ultraviolet (UV), we have\nidentified various stellar populations in the CMD, and used their radial\ndistributions to study the evolution and origin of BSS, and obtain a dynamical\nestimate of the mass of BSS systems. When we separate the BSS into two samples\nby their magnitude, we find that the bright BSS show a much more centrally\nconcentrated radial distribution and thus higher mass estimate (over twice the\nTO mass for these BSS systems), suggesting an origin involving triple or\nmultiple stellar systems. In contrast, the faint BSS are less concentrated,\nwith a radial distribution similar to the main sequence (MS) binaries, pointing\nto the MS binaries as the likely progenitors of these BSS. Putting our data\ntogether with available photometric data in the visible and using MESA\nevolutionary models, we calculate the expected number of stars in each\nevolutionary stage for the normal evolution of stars and the number of stars\ncoming from the evolution of BSS. The results indicate that BSS have a post-MS\nevolution comparable to that of a normal star of the same mass and a MS BSS\nlifetime of about 200-300 Myr.

This long-standing question belongs to\nthe extensively studied class of explore/exploit problems that arise in a wide\nrange of situations, from animal foraging, to robotic exploration, and to human\ndecision processes. Despite its broad relevance, the issue of optimal\nexploitation has previously only been tackled through two paradigmatic limiting\nmodels---patch-use and random search---that do not account for the interplay\nbetween searcher motion within patches and resource depletion. Here, we bridge\nthis gap by introducing a minimal patch exploitation model that incorporates\nthis coupling: the searcher depletes the resources along its random-walk\ntrajectory within a patch and travels to a new patch after it takes\n$\\mathcal{S}$ consecutive steps without finding resources. We compute the\ndistribution of the amount of resources $F_t$ consumed by time $t$ for this\nnon-Markovian random walker and show that exploring multiple patches is\nbeneficial.

In the KCC approach we describe the time evolution of the scalar\nfield cosmologies in geometric terms, by performing a \"second geometrization\",\nby considering them as paths of a semispray. By introducing a non-linear\nconnection and a Berwald type connection associated to the Friedmann and\nKlein-Gordon equations, five geometrical invariants can be constructed, with\nthe second invariant giving the Jacobi stability of the cosmological model.

However, the\nconnection between fixed points of GBP and the extremal points of the CVM\nfree-energy is usually not a one-to-one correspondence, because of the\nexistence of a gauge transformation involving the GBP messages.\n  Our contribution is twofold.

It was recently shown that\nthe only mechanisms that are simultaneously DSIC, SBB, and ex-post IR, are\nfixed price mechanisms, i.e., mechanisms that are parametrised by a price p,\nand trade occurs if and only if the valuation of the buyer is at least p and\nthe valuation of the seller is at most p. The gain from trade is the increase\nin welfare that results from applying a mechanism; here we study the gain from\ntrade achievable by fixed price mechanisms. We explore this question for both\nthe bilateral trade setting, and a double auction setting where there are\nmultiple buyers and sellers. We first identify a fixed price mechanism that\nachieves a gain from trade of at least 2/r times the optimum, where r is the\nprobability that the seller's valuation does not exceed the buyer's valuation.\nThis extends a previous result by McAfee. Subsequently, we improve this\napproximation factor in an asymptotic sense, by showing that a more\nsophisticated rule for setting the fixed price results in an expected gain from\ntrade within a factor O(log(1/r)) of the optimal gain from trade.

The problem is cast as a dynamic game among\nUAVs. To solve this game, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on\necho state network (ESN) cells, is proposed. The introduced deep ESN\narchitecture is trained to allow each UAV to map each observation of the\nnetwork state to an action, with the goal of minimizing a sequence of\ntime-dependent utility functions. Each UAV uses ESN to learn its optimal path,\ntransmission power level, and cell association vector at different locations\nalong its path. The proposed algorithm is shown to reach a subgame perfect Nash\nequilibrium (SPNE) upon convergence. Moreover, an upper and lower bound for the\naltitude of the UAVs is derived thus reducing the computational complexity of\nthe proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme\nachieves better wireless latency per UAV and rate per ground user (UE) while\nrequiring a number of steps that is comparable to a heuristic baseline that\nconsiders moving via the shortest distance towards the corresponding\ndestinations. The results also show that the optimal altitude of the UAVs\nvaries based on the ground network density and the UE data rate requirements\nand plays a vital role in minimizing the interference level on the ground UEs\nas well as the wireless transmission delay of the UAV. \n\n"}

This is important for planetary habitability\nbecause snowball events may trigger rises in the complexity of life, but could\nalso endanger complex life that already exists. Recent work has shown that\nplanets tidally locked in synchronous rotation states will transition smoothly\ninto the snowball state rather than experiencing bifurcations. Here we\ninvestigate the structure of snowball bifurcations on planets that are tidally\ninfluenced, but not synchronously rotating, so that they experience long solar\ndays.

In the latter case, the recent discovery of\nthe binary neutron star (NS-NS) merger in the gravitational wave observation\nmade by LIGO (GW170817), and the detection of associated electromagnetic\ncounterparts, for the first time gave a direct proof of the NS-NS merger being\na progenitor of a short GRB.\n  In general, all GRBs are believed to be powered by accretion through a\nrotationally supported torus, or by fast rotation of a compact object. For long\nones, the rotation of the progenitor star is a key property in order to support\naccretion over relatively long activity periods, and also to sustain the\nrotation of the black hole itself.

In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach of cyber risk management for blockchain-based service. In particular,\nwe adopt the cyber-insurance as an economic tool for neutralizing cyber risks\ndue to attacks in blockchain networks. We consider a blockchain service market,\nwhich is composed of the infrastructure provider, the blockchain provider, the\ncyber-insurer, and the users. The blockchain provider purchases from the\ninfrastructure provider, e.g., a cloud, the computing resources to maintain the\nblockchain consensus, and then offers blockchain services to the users. The\nblockchain provider strategizes its investment in the infrastructure and the\nservice price charged to the users, in order to improve the security of the\nblockchain and thus optimize its profit. Meanwhile, the blockchain provider\nalso purchases a cyber-insurance from the cyber-insurer to protect itself from\nthe potential damage due to the attacks. In return, the cyber-insurer adjusts\nthe insurance premium according to the perceived risk level of the blockchain\nservice. Based on the assumption of rationality for the market entities, we\nmodel the interaction among the blockchain provider, the users, and the\ncyber-insurer as a two-level Stackelberg game. Namely, the blockchain provider\nand the cyber-insurer lead to set their pricing/investment strategies, and then\nthe users follow to determine their demand of the blockchain service.\nSpecifically, we consider the scenario of double-spending attacks and provide a\nseries of analytical results about the Stackelberg equilibrium in the market\ngame. \n\n"}

In the context of the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM), I use\nempirically derived dilution factors of a sample of nearby SNe Ic, which were\nderived in Paper I of a two-paper series, as a proxy for the dilution factors\nof GRB-SNe.

We begin in 1D with arbitrary disorder assigned to a\nfinite number of bonds and study how the system renormalizes, finding\nnon-trivial fixed point structure for any given bond with a separatrix at zero\nbond strength, equivalent to inserting a break in the chain. Either side of\nthis critical line, renormalization group (RG) trajectories flow towards one of\ntwo attractors on which the disordered bonds settle onto ferromagnetic or\nanti-ferromagnetic (AF) couplings of equal and opposite magnitude. Bonds that\nsettle on an AF attractor are equivalent to inserting a twist in the chain at\nthe location of the bond, implying a multi-kink ground state solution.\nQualitatively different behavior emerges at the RG step when bonds start to\ncoalesce, with the chain `untwisting' whenever two AF bonds coalesce.

Collapse sets in to build up stars and star clusters.\n  Turbulence plays a dual role. On global scales it provides support, while at\nthe same time it can promote local collapse. Stellar birth is thus intimately\nlinked to the dynamical behavior of parental gas cloud, which determines when\nand where protostellar cores form, and how they contract and grow in mass via\naccretion from the surrounding cloud material to build up stars. Slow,\ninefficient, isolated star formation is a hallmark of turbulent support,\nwhereas fast, efficient, clustered star formation occurs in its absence.\n  The fact that Galactic molecular clouds are highly filamentary can be\nexplained by a combination of compressional flows and shear. The dynamical\nevolution of nascent star clusters is very complex. This strongly influences\nthe stellar mass spectrum. The equation of state (EOS) plays a pivotal role in\nthe fragmentation process.

Here, we examine some of the fundamental simplifying assumptions\nbehind this model and generalise it in several important ways. The model\npredicts that the ionized regions attain a well-defined characteristic size R_c\nthat ranges from R_c~1 Mpc in the early phases to R_c>10 Mpc in the late\nphases. We show that R_c is determined primarily by the bias of the galaxies\ndriving reionization; hence measurements of this scale constrain a fundamental\nproperty of the first galaxies. The variance around R_c, on the other hand, is\ndetermined primarily by the underlying matter power spectrum. We then show that\nincreasing the ionizing efficiency of massive galaxies shifts R_c to\nsignificantly larger scales and decreases the importance of recombinations.\nThese differences can be observed with forthcoming redshifted 21 cm surveys\n(increasing the brightness temperature fluctuations by up to a factor of two on\nlarge scales) and with measurements of small-scale anisotropies in the cosmic\nmicrowave background.

The gamma-ray spectra of both bursts are best fit with\nsteep power-laws, implying they are X-ray rich. GRB040223 is among the weakest\nand longest of INTEGRAL GRBs. The X-ray afterglow of this burst was detected 10\nhours after the prompt event by XMM-Newton. The measured spectral properties\nare consistent with a column density much higher than that expected from the\nGalaxy, indicating strong intrinsic absorption. We carried out near-infrared\nobservations 17 hours after the burst with the NTT of ESO, which yielded upper\nlimits. Given the intrinsic absorption, we find that these limits are\ncompatible with a simple extrapolation of the X-ray afterglow properties. For\nGRB040624, we carried out optical observations 13 hours after the burst with\nFORS 1 and 2 at the VLT, and DOLoRes at the TNG, again obtaining upper limits.\nWe compare these limits with the magnitudes of a compilation of promptly\nobserved counterparts of previous GRBs and show that they lie at the very faint\nend of the distribution.

During reionization peculiar motion of free electrons induces the\nDoppler anisotropy of the CMB, while density fluctuations of neutral hydrogen\ninduce the 21-cm line anisotropy. In our simplified model of inhomogeneous\nreionization, a positive correlation arises as the universe reionizes whereas a\nnegative correlation arises as it recombines; thus, the sign of the correlation\nprovides information on the reionization history which cannot be obtained by\npresently. The signal comes mainly from large scales (k~0.01 Mpc^-1) where\nlinear perturbation theory is valid and complexity due to patchy reionization\nis averaged out. Since the Doppler signal comes from ionized regions and the\n21-cm comes from neutral ones, the correlation has a well-defined peak(s) in\nredshift when the ionization fraction of the universe is about half.\nFurthermore, the cross-correlation is much less sensitive to systematic errors,\nespecially foreground emission, than the auto-correlation of 21-cm lines: this\nis analogous to the temperature-polarization correlation of the CMB being more\nimmune to systematic errors than the polarization-polarization. Therefore, we\nargue that the Doppler-21cm correlation provides a robust measurement of the\n21-cm anisotropy, which can also be used as a diagnostic tool for detected\nsignals in the 21-cm data -- detection of the cross-correlation provides the\nstrongest confirmation that the signal is of cosmological origin.

Based on the assumption that these tails\nand flares are of internal shock origin and that their decline behaviors are\ndominated by the curvature effect of the fireball, we present a\nself-consistency test for this scenario with a sample of 36\nprompt-emission-tails/flare-tails in 22 GRB XRT light curves. Our results show\nthat the t0 of the prompt emission tails and the tails of well-separated flares\nare usually at the rising segment of the last pulse of the prompt emission or\nthe corresponding X-ray flare, being self-consistent with the expectation of\nthe internal dissipation models for the prompt emission and X-ray flares. Our\nresults indicate that each X-ray flare forms a distinct new episode of central\nengine activity and the GRB central engine remains active after the prompt\nemission is over, sometimes up to ~1 day after the GRB trigger (e.g. GRB\n050502B & GRB 050724). This challenges the conventional central engine models\nand calls for new ideas to re-start the central engine. We further show that\nthe on-set time of the late central engine activity does not depend on the GRB\nduration. We also identify a minority group of GRBs whose combined BAT-XRT\nlight curves are smoothly connected without an abrupt transition between the\nprompt emission and the afterglow.

A\n  semianalytical and a purely numerical approach Abstract: Construction of a theory of orbits about a precessing oblate planet, in terms\nof osculating elements defined in a frame of the equator of date, was started\nin Efroimsky and Goldreich (2004) and Efroimsky (2005, 2006). We now combine\nthat analytical machinery with numerics. The resulting semianalytical theory is\nthen applied to Deimos over long time scales. In parallel, we carry out a\npurely numerical integration in an inertial Cartesian frame. The results agree\nto within a small margin, for over 10 Myr, demonstrating the applicability of\nour semianalytical model over long timescales. This will enable us to employ it\nat the further steps of the project, enriching the model with the tides, the\npull of the Sun, and the planet's triaxiality. Another goal of our work was to\ncheck if the equinoctial precession predicted for a rigid Mars could have been\nsufficient to repel the orbits away from the equator. We show that for low\ninitial inclinations, the orbit inclination reckoned from the precessing\nequator of date is subject only to small variations. This is an extension, to\nnon-uniform precession given by the Colombo model, of an old result obtained by\nGoldreich (1965) for the case of uniform precession and a low initial\ninclination. However, near-polar initial inclinations may exhibit considerable\nvariations for up to +/- 10 deg in magnitude. Nevertheless, the analysis\nconfirms that an oblate planet can, indeed, afford large variations of the\nequinoctial precession over hundreds of millions of years, without repelling\nits near-equatorial satellites away from the equator of date: the satellite\ninclination oscillates but does not show a secular increase.

A simple stellar evolution model, defined by a star-formation density\nthat rises from z=0 to z=1.5, a universal Salpeter IMF, and a moderate amount\nof dust with A_V=0.23 mag (A_1500=1.2 mag), is able to account for most of the\noptical-FIR extragalactic background light, and reproduces the global\nultraviolet, optical, and near-IR photometric properties of the universe.

This follows a long hiatus in the application of\nsuprathermal ion bremsstrahlung to astrophysical models since the early 1970s.\nThe potential importance of inverse bremsstrahlung relative to normal\nbremsstrahlung, i.e. where ions are at rest, hinges upon the underlying\nvelocity distributions of the interacting species. In this paper, we identify\nthe conditions under which the inverse bremsstrahlung emissivity is significant\nrelative to that for normal bremsstrahlung in shocked astrophysical plasmas. We\ndetermine that, since both observational and theoretical evidence favors\nelectron temperatures almost comparable to, and certainly not very deficient\nrelative to proton temperatures in shocked plasmas, these environments\ngenerally render inverse bremsstrahlung at best a minor contributor to the\noverall emission. Hence inverse bremsstrahlung can be safely neglected in most\nmodels invoking shock acceleration in discrete sources such as supernova\nremnants.

In the first model a \\pm\nJ-distribution of the bonds is chosen, in the second model a Gaussian\ndistribution. In both cases the first two moments of the distribution are\nchosen to be J_0=-1, Delta J=+1, so that no ferromagnetic ordering of the Potts\nspins can occur. We find that for all temperatures investigated the spin glass\nsusceptibility remains finite, the spin glass order parameter remains zero, and\nthat the specific heat has only a smooth Schottky-like peak. These results can\nbe understood quantitatively by considering small but independent clusters of\nspins. Hence we have evidence that there is no static phase transition at any\nnonzero temperature. Consistent with these findings, only very minor size\neffects are observed, which implies that all correlation lengths of the models\nremain very short. We also compute for both models the time auto-correlation\nfunction C(t) of the Potts spins. While in the Gaussian model C(t) shows a\nsmooth uniform decay, the correlator for the \\pm J model has several distinct\nsteps.

First, we note that the symmetry breaking transition of the\nferromagetic Ising model maps onto a non-symmetry breaking transition in dimer\nlanguage -- instead it becomes a deconfinement transition for test monomers.\nNext, we introduce a modification of Fisher's mapping in which a second dimer\nmodel, also equivalent to the Ising model, is defined on a generically\ndifferent lattice derived from the dual. In contrast to Fisher's original\nmapping, this enables us to reformulate frustrated Ising models as dimer models\nwith positive weights and we illustrate this by providing a new solution of the\nfully frustrated Ising model on the square lattice. Finally, by means of the\nmodified mapping we show that a large class of three-dimensional Ising models\nare precisely equivalent, in the time continuum limit, to particular quantum\ndimer models. As Ising models in three dimensions are dual to Ising gauge\ntheories, this further yields an exact map between the latter and the quantum\ndimer models. The paramagnetic phase in Ising language maps onto a deconfined,\ntopologically ordered phase in the dimer models. Using this set of ideas, we\nalso construct an exactly soluble quantum eight vertex model. \n\n"}

One is the destabilized-stabilized phase transition of the\nflat direction, which is in general induced by the Hubble parameter. The other\nis the phase transition related to the A-term, which induces the misalignment\nof the relative phase of the flat direction. In the conventional Affleck-Dine\nbaryogenesis they are supposed to start almost simultaneously. Of course these\nphase transitions can take place separately, but the latter must not be later\nthan the former because the phase transition of the A-term can not produce any\nbaryon number when there is no condensate of the relative charge.\n  In this paper we try to construct models where the original idea of\nAffleck-Dine baryogenesis is realized in a different way. We show examples in\nwhich the local domain of the false vacuum with the required condensate is\nformed after inflation and collapses in a safe way so that the domain wall\nproblem is avoided. We also show examples where the phase transition of the\nA-term starts before the decay of the condensate. As in the conventional\nAffleck-Dine mechanism, the phase transition of the A-term produces baryon\nnumber in the local domain of the condensate.

A consequence of the stochastic independence is\nthat species whose genotypes differ even by a single bit may have completely\ndifferent phenotypes. This is clearly unrealistic, as closely related species\nshould be similar in their interactions with the rest of the ecosystem. Here we\ntherefore study a model, in which the M_{ij} are correlated to a controllable\ndegree. We calculate, both analytically and numerically, the correlation\nfunction for matrix elements M_{ij} and M_{kl} versus the Hamming distance\nbetween the bitstrings representing the species. We compare Monte Carlo\nsimulations of coevolution models with uncorrelated and correlated\ninteractions. In particular, we consider the lifetimes of individual species.\nThe species-lifetime distribution is close to a power law with an exponent near\n-2 in both uncorrelated and correlated cases. The durations of quasi-steady\nstates and power spectral densities for the diversity indices display\nnoticeable differences.

New species are introduced through mutation. Both models are\namenable to exact linear stability analysis, and we compare the analytic\nresults with large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, obtaining the\npopulation size as a function of an average interspecies interaction strength.\nOver time, the models self-optimize through mutation and selection to\napproximately maximize a community fitness function, subject only to\nconstraints internal to the particular model.

Introducing spatial degrees of freedom\nand allowing for stochastic fluctuations generically invalidates the classical,\ndeterministic mean-field picture. Already within mean-field theory, however,\nspatial constraints, modeling locally limited resources, lead to the emergence\nof a continuous active-to-absorbing state phase transition. Field-theoretic\narguments, supported by Monte Carlo simulation results, indicate that this\ntransition, which represents an extinction threshold for the predator\npopulation, is governed by the directed percolation universality class. In the\nactive state, where predators and prey coexist, the classical center\nsingularities with associated population cycles are replaced by either nodes or\nfoci. In the vicinity of the stable nodes, the system is characterized by\nessentially stationary localized clusters of predators in a sea of prey.

Although there is a strong consensus that\ngeneral laws in biology may exist, opinions opposing such suggestion are\nabundant. Based on recent progress in both mathematics and biology, another\nattempt to address this issue is made in the present article. Specifically,\nthree laws which form a mathematical framework for the evolutionary dynamics in\nbiology are postulated. The second law is most quantitative and is explicitly\nexpressed in the unique form of a stochastic differential equation. Salient\nfeatures of Darwinian evolutionary dynamics are captured by this law: the\nprobabilistic nature of evolution, ascendancy, and the adaptive landscape. Four\ndynamical elements are introduced in this formulation: the ascendant matrix,\nthe transverse matrix, the Wright evolutionary potential, and the stochastic\ndrive. The first law may be regarded as a special case of the second law. It\ngives the reference point to discuss the evolutionary dynamics. The third law\ndescribes the relationship between the focused level of description to its\nlower and higher ones, and defines the dichotomy of deterministic and\nstochastic drives. It is an acknowledgement of the hierarchical structure in\nbiology. A new interpretation of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural\nselection is provided in terms of the F-Theorem.
