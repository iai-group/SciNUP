The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\napplications are discussed in detail. \n\n"}

This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either\nfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a\nformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude\nLANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow. \n\n"}

As usual, it is assumed that the system maximizes the entropy\nfunctional $S$, subjected to the standard conditions; i.e., constant energy and\nnormalization of the probability distribution.

This hypothesis is at variance with the assumption that the usual\ncontinuity equation holds but, in the inviscid limit, both models agree in the\nregular regions. Taking advantage of the formulation of the dynamics of this\n``geometrical model'' in terms of Legendre transforms and convex hulls, we\nstudy the evolution with time of the distribution of matter and the associated\npartitions of the Lagrangian and Eulerian spaces. We describe how the halo mass\ndistribution derives from a triangulation in Lagrangian space, while the dual\nVoronoi-like tessellation in Eulerian space gives the boundaries of empty\nregions with shock nodes at their vertices.

According to this\nanalysis, the stable stratification $N^2\\geq0$ has a destabilization mechanism,\nand the flow instability is due to the competition of the kinetic energy with\nthe potential energy, which is dominated by the total Froude number $Fr_t^2$.\nGlobally, $Fr_t^2 \\leq 1$ implies that the total kinetic energy is smaller than\nthe total potential energy. So the potential energy might transfer to the\nkinetic energy after being disturbed, and the flow becomes unstable. On the\nother hand, when the potential energy is smaller than the kinetic energy\n($Fr_t^2>1$), the flow is stable because no potential energy could transfer to\nthe kinetic energy. The flow is more stable with the velocity profile\n$U'/U'''>0$ than that with $U'/U'''<0$. Besides, the unstable perturbation must\nbe long-wave scale. Locally, the flow is unstable as the gradient Richardson\nnumber $Ri>1/4$.

Here we concentrate on Markov processes\ndescribing heat conducting systems, and develop a new method for deriving\nthermodynamic relations. We first present a new simpler derivation of the\nextended Clausius relation, and clarify its close relation with the linear\nresponse theory.

This is in full analogy to an\nold finding regarding the magnetic mean-field diffusivity in an electrically\nconducting turbulently moving compressible fluid. These phenomena occur if the\nirrotational part of the motion dominates the vortical part, the P\\`eclet or\nmagnetic Reynolds number is not too large, and, in addition, the variation of\nthe flow pattern is slow.

Abstract: Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn feature strong zonal wind patterns on\ntheir surfaces.

Here, we explore the possibility that the interplay of planetary\nrotation with the compression and expansion of the convecting fluid can drive\nmultiple deep zonal jets by a compressional Rhines-type mechanism, as\noriginally proposed by Ingersoll and Pollard (1982). In a certain limit, this\ndeep mechanism is shown to be mathematically analogous to the classical Rhines\nmechanism possibly operating at cloud level. Jets are predicted to occur on a\ncompressional Rhines length $l_R = (2 \\Omega \\langle H_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle\nv_{jet}^{-1} )^{-1/2}$, where $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity, $\\langle\nH_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle$ is the mean inverse density scale height and $v_{jet}$ is\nthe typical jet velocity.

In particular, it\nexhibits a nonequilibrium, discontinuous transition between a reactive and a CO\npoisoned phase. If one allows a nonzero rate of CO desorption ($k$), the line\nof phase transitions terminates at a critical point ($k_{c}$).

Of particular\ninterest are compact and low-power relaxation oscillators that have been\nrecently demonstrated using MIT (metal- insulator-transition) devices using\nproperties of correlated oxides. This paper presents an analysis of the\ndynamics and synchronization of a system of two such identical coupled\nrelaxation oscillators implemented with MIT devices. We focus on two\nimplementations of the oscillator: (a) a D-D configuration where complementary\nMIT devices (D) are connected in series to provide oscillations and (b) a D-R\nconfiguration where it is composed of a resistor (R) in series with a\nvoltage-triggered state changing MIT device (D). The MIT device acts like a\nhysteresis resistor with different resistances in the two different states. The\nsynchronization dynamics of such a system has been analyzed with purely charge\nbased coupling using a resistive (Rc) and a capacitive (Cc) element in\nparallel. It is shown that in a D-D configuration symmetric, identical and\ncapacitively coupled relaxation oscillator system synchronizes to an anti-phase\nlocking state, whereas when coupled resistively the system locks in phase.\nFurther, we demonstrate that for certain range of values of Rc and Cc, a\nbistable system is possible which can have potential applications in\nassociative computing.

In experiments or cosmological models one typically wants to\ncompute the out-of-equilibrium evolution of a given initial distribution of\nsuch waves. Wave Turbulence deals with out-of-equilibrium ensembles of weakly\nnonlinear waves, and is therefore well-suited to address this problem. As an\nexample, we consider the complex Klein-Gordon equation with a Mexican-hat\npotential. This simple equation displays two kinds of excitations around the\nfundamental state: massive particles and massless Goldstone bosons. The former\nare waves with a nonzero frequency for vanishing wavenumber, whereas the latter\nobey an acoustic dispersion relation. Using wave turbulence theory, we derive\nwave kinetic equations that govern the coupled evolution of the spectra of\nmassive and massless waves.

It is instead extremely\nhard to predict onset and decay of blockings. Covariant Lyapunov Vectors (CLVs)\noffer a suitable characterization of the linear stability of a chaotic flow,\nsince they represent the full tangent linear dynamics by a covariant basis\nwhich explores linear perturbations at all time scales. Therefore, we assess\nwhether CLVs feature a signature of the blockings. As a first step, we examine\nthe CLVs for a quasi-geostrophic beta-plane 2-layer model in a periodic channel\nbaroclinically driven by a meridional temperature gradient $\\Delta T$. An\norographic forcing enhances the emergence of localized blocked regimes. We\ndetect the blocking events with a Tibaldi-Molteni scheme adapted to the\nperiodic channel. When blocking occurs, the global growth rates of the fastest\ngrowing CLVs are significantly higher. Hence, against intuition, the\ncirculation is globally more unstable in blocked phases. Such an increase in\nthe finite time Lyapunov exponents with respect to the long term average is\nattributed to stronger barotropic and baroclinic conversion in the case of high\ntemperature gradients, while for low values of \\Delta T, the effect is only due\nto stronger barotropic instability. In order to determine the localization of\nthe CLVs we compare the meridionally averaged variance of the CLVs during\nblocked and unblocked phases.

The\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to assign the pore size\ndistribution to each component, and the dusty gas model (DGM) and generalized\nMaxwell-Stefan model (GMS) are adopted to calculate the apparent permeability\naccounting for multiple transport mechanisms including viscous flow, Knudsen\ndiffusion and surface diffusion. Effects of pore radius and pressure on\npermeability of both IOM and OM as well as effects of Langmuir parameters on OM\nare investigated. Moreover, the effect of total organic content and\ndistribution on the apparent permeability of the reconstructed shale matrix is\nalso studied. It is found that the distribution of OM and IOM has a negligible\ninfluence on apparent permeability, whereas the total organic content and the\nsurface diffusion play a significant role in gas transport in shale matrix. \n\n"}

In this article, we explore the\nholographic properties of networks of random tensors. We find that our models\nnaturally incorporate many features that are analogous to those of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. When the bond dimension of the tensors is large, we show that\nthe entanglement entropy of boundary regions, whether connected or not, obey\nthe Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula, a fact closely related to known properties\nof the multipartite entanglement of assistance. Moreover, we find that each\nboundary region faithfully encodes the physics of the entire bulk entanglement\nwedge. Our method is to interpret the average over random tensors as the\npartition function of a classical ferromagnetic Ising model, so that the\nminimal surfaces of Ryu-Takayanagi appear as domain walls. Upon including the\nanalog of a bulk field, we find that our model reproduces the expected\ncorrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula: the minimal surface is displaced and\nthe entropy is augmented by the entanglement of the bulk field. Increasing the\nentanglement of the bulk field ultimately changes the minimal surface\ntopologically in a way similar to creation of a black hole.

We address this question by considering stationary states,\nwhich provide the simplest examples of wave functions with stationary nodes. We\nprovide examples of stationary wave functions for which there is chaos, as\ndemonstrated by numerical computations, for one particle moving in 3 spatial\ndimensions and for two and three entangled particles in two dimensions. Our\nconclusion is that the motion of the nodes is not necessary for the generation\nof chaos. What is important is the overall complexity of the wave function.\nThat is, if the wave function, or rather its phase, has complex spatial\nvariations, it will lead to complex Bohmian trajectories and hence to chaos.\nAnother aspect of our work concerns the average Lyapunov exponent, which\nquantifies the overall amount of chaos. Since it is very hard to evaluate the\naverage Lyapunov exponent analytically, which is often computed numerically, it\nis useful to have simple quantities that agree well with the average Lyapunov\nexponent.

A\nrecent numerical study [Ba\\~{n}uls, Cirac, and Hastings, Phys. Rev.

One particular case called \"weak thermalization\" regime showed\napparently persistent oscillations of some observables. Here we provide an\nexplanation of such oscillations. We note that the corresponding initial state\nhas low energy density relative to the ground state of the model. We then use\nperturbation theory near the ground state and identify the oscillation\nfrequency as essentially a quasiparticle gap.

Self-pulsing regimes need to produce pulses very regularly\nand, as such, they are also known to be particularly sensitive to\nperturbations, such as noise or light injection.\n  We investigate the effect of delayed optical feedback on the dynamics of a\nself-pulsing semiconductor laser with saturable absorber (SLSA). More\nprecisely, we consider the Yamada model with delay -- a system of three\ndelay-differential equations (DDEs) for two slow and one fast variable -- which\nhas been shown to reproduce accurately self-pulsing features as observed in\nSLSA experimentally. This model is also of broader interest because it is quite\nclosely related to mathematical models of other self-pulsing systems, such as\nexcitable spiking neurons.\n  We perform a numerical bifurcation analysis of the Yamada model with delay,\nwhere we consider both the feedback delay, the feedback strength and the\nstrength of pumping as bifurcation parameters.

This\nmethod forms the basis of most currently operational weather forecasting\nsystems. In practice the optimization becomes infeasible if the time window is\ntoo long due to the non-convexity of the cost function, the effect of model\nerrors, and the limited precision of the ODE solvers. Hence the window has to\nbe kept sufficiently short, and the observations in the previous windows can be\ntaken into account via a Gaussian background (prior) distribution. The choice\nof the background covariance matrix is an important question that has received\nmuch attention in the literature.

The coherence of neuronal dynamics over different\nscales has been suggested as a clue to the mechanisms underlying this\nintegration. Balanced excitation and inhibition may amplify microscopic\nfluctuations to a macroscopic level, thus providing a mechanism for generating\ncoherent multiscale dynamics. Previous theories of brain dynamics, however,\nwere restricted to cases in which inhibition dominated excitation and\nsuppressed fluctuations in the macroscopic population activity. In the present\nstudy, we investigate the dynamics of neuronal networks at a critical point\nbetween excitation-dominant and inhibition-dominant states. In these networks,\nthe microscopic fluctuations are amplified by the strong excitation and\ninhibition to drive the macroscopic dynamics, while the macroscopic dynamics\ndetermine the statistics of the microscopic fluctuations. Developing a novel\ntype of mean-field theory applicable to this class of interscale interactions,\nwe show that the amplification mechanism generates spontaneous, irregular\nmacroscopic rhythms similar to those observed in the brain.

Abstract: In this paper we consider how the statistical moments of the separation\nbetween two fluid particles grow with time when their separation lies in the\ndissipation range of turbulence. In this range the fluid velocity field varies\nsmoothly, and the relative velocity of two fluid particles depends linearly\nupon their separation. While this may suggest that the rate at which fluid\nparticles separate is exponential in time, this is not guaranteed because the\nstrain-rate governing their separation is a strongly fluctuating quantity in\nturbulence. Indeed, the recent paper by Afik \\& Steinberg (Nat.

By reverting to an older,\nmore heuristic model it is shown that all of the technical difficulties are\neliminated. Application to a Lennard-Jones fluid results in a demonstration of\npower of ftDFT to describe crystallization in a highly inhomogeneous system.\nFirst, we show that droplets attached to a slightly hydrophobic wall\ncrystallize spontaneously upon being quenched. The resulting crystallites are\nclearly faceted structures and are predominantly HCP structures.

These are parametric perturbation growth arising from interaction\nof the perturbations with the fluctuating mean flow and transient growth of\nperturbations arising from nonlinear interaction between components of the\nperturbation field. By the method of comparing the turbulence maintained in the\nSSD and in the associated direct numerical simulation (DNS) in which these\nmechanisms have been selectively included and excluded, parametric growth is\nfound to maintain the perturbation field of the turbulence while the more\ncommonly invoked mechanism of transient growth of perturbations arising from\nscattering by nonlinear interaction is found to suppress perturbation growth.\nIn addition to verifying that the parametric mechanism maintains the\nperturbations in DNS it is also verified that the Lyapunov vectors are the\nstructures that dominate the perturbation energy and energetics in DNS. It is\nfurther verified that these vectors are responsible for maintaining the roll\ncirculation that underlies the self-sustaining process (SSP) and in particular\nthe maintenance of the fluctuating streak that supports the parametric\nperturbation growth. \n\n"}

The latter gives rise to a non-constant pressure gradient\nin the flow-wise direction and, hence, to a nonlinear flow rate--pressure drop\nrelation (unlike the Hagen--Poiseuille law for a rigid tube). Many biofluids\nare non-Newtonian, and are well approximated by generalized Newtonian (say,\npower-law) rheological models. Consequently, we analyze the problem of steady\nlow Reynolds number flow of a generalized Newtonian fluid through a slender\nelastic tube by coupling fluid lubrication theory to a structural problem posed\nin terms of Donnell shell theory. A perturbative approach (in the slenderness\nparameter) yields analytical solutions for both the flow and the deformation.\nUsing matched asymptotics, we obtain a uniformly valid solution for the tube's\nradial displacement, which features both a boundary layer and a corner layer\ncaused by localized bending near the clamped ends.

Even in the\nabsence of turbulence, Poisson fluctuations of collision times in dilute\nsuspensions may result in substantial variations in the growth process,\nresulting in a broad distribution of growth times to reach a certain droplet\nsize. We quantify the accuracy of the superdroplet algorithm in describing the\nfluctuating growth history of a larger droplet that settles under the effect of\ngravity in a quiescent fluid and collides with a dilute suspension of smaller\ndroplets that were initially randomly distributed in space ('lucky droplet\nmodel').

The immersed boundary(IB) method is a widely recognized and\neffective modeling paradigm for simulating fluid-structure interaction(FSI) in\nsuch systems, but a difficulty of the IB formulation is that the pressure and\nviscous stress are generally discontinuous at the interface. The conventional\nIB method regularizes these discontinuities, which typically yields low-order\naccuracy at these interfaces. The immersed interface method(IIM) is an IB-like\napproach to FSI that sharply imposes stress jump conditions, enabling\nhigher-order accuracy, but prior applications of the IIM have been largely\nrestricted to methods that rely on smooth representations of the interface\ngeometry. This paper introduces an IIM that uses only a C0 representation of\nthe interface,such as those provided by standard nodal Lagrangian FE methods.\nVerification examples for models with prescribed motion demonstrate that the\nmethod sharply resolves stress discontinuities along the IB while avoiding the\nneed for analytic information of the interface geometry.

A\nnew method is developed that allows one to systematically construct the\ncorrelation-time expansion for statistical characteristics of the field.

The\nsystem is driven out of equilibrium either by considering different values for\nthe noise strengths in the Langevin equations describing the evolution of the\ndynamic variables (effectively placing these at different temperatures), or\nmore generally by allowing for anisotropic noise strengths, i.e., by\nconstraining the dynamics to be at different temperatures in d_par- and\nd_perp-dimensional subspaces, respectively. In the first, case, we find one\ninfrared-stable and one unstable renormalization group fixed point. At the\nstable fixed point, detailed balance is dynamically restored, with the two\nnoise strengths becoming asymptotically equal. The ensuing critical behavior is\nthat of the standard equilibrium model H. At the novel unstable fixed point,\nthe temperature ratio for the dynamic variables is renormalized to infinity,\nresulting in an effective decoupling between the two modes. We compute the\ncritical exponents at this new fixed point to one-loop order. For model H with\nspatially anisotropic noise, we observe a critical softening only in the\nd_perp-dimensional sector in wave vector space with lower noise temperature.\nThe ensuing effective two-temperature model H does not have any stable fixed\npoint in any physical dimension, at least to one-loop order.

Here, we start with Mohr-Coulomb\nplasticity for quasi-2D granular materials to calculate (average) stresses and\nslip planes, but we propose a \"stochastic flow rule\" (SFR) to replace the\nprinciple of coaxiality in classical plasticity. The SFR takes into account two\ncrucial features of granular materials - discreteness and randomness - via\ndiffusing \"spots\" of local fluidization, which act as carriers of plasticity.\nWe postulate that spots perform random walks biased along slip-lines with a\ndrift direction determined by the stress imbalance upon a local switch from\nstatic to dynamic friction. In the continuum limit (based on a Fokker-Planck\nequation for the spot concentration), this simple model is able to predict a\nvariety of granular flow profiles in flat-bottom silos, annular Couette cells,\nflowing heaps, and plate-dragging experiments -- with essentially no fitting\nparameters -- although it is only expected to function where material is at\nincipient failure and slip-lines are inadmissible. For special cases of\nadmissible slip-lines, such as plate dragging under a heavy load or flow down\nan inclined plane, we postulate a transition to rate-dependent Bagnold\nrheology, where flow occurs by sliding shear planes.

For all Ehrenfest times, we show\nthat the shot-noise is enhanced by the tunnelling, while the weak-localization\nis suppressed. In the opaque barrier limit (small tunnelling rates with large\nlead widths, such that Drude conductance remains finite), the weak-localization\ngoes to zero linearly with the tunnelling rate, while the Fano factor of the\nshot-noise remains finite but becomes independent of the Ehrenfest time.

The canonical formalism and the principle of\nleast action also associate momentum, energy, and action with a\nsoliton-diffusive mode configuration and thus provides a selection criterion\nfor the noise-induced fluctuations. In a ``quantum mechanical'' representation\nof the path integral the noise fluctuations, corresponding to different paths\nin the path integral, are interpreted as ``quantum fluctuations'' and the\ngrowth morphology represented by a Landau-type quasi-particle gas of ``quantum\nsolitons'' with gapless dispersion and ``quantum diffusive modes'' with a gap\nin the spectrum. Finally, the scaling properties are dicussed from a heuristic\npoint of view in terms of a``quantum spectral representation'' for the slope\ncorrelations. The dynamic eponent z=3/2 is given by the gapless soliton\ndispersion law, whereas the roughness exponent zeta =1/2 follows from a\nregularity property of the form factor in the spectral representation. A\nheuristic expression for the scaling function is given by spectral\nrepresentation and has a form similar to the probability distribution for Levy\nflights with index $z$. \n\n"}

This interaction mixes the unperturbed shell-model\n(Hartree-Fock) basis states and produces chaotic many-body eigenstates. As a\nresult, an interaction-induced statistical equilibrium emerges in the system.\nThis equilibrium is due to the off-diagonal matrix elements of the Hamiltonian.\nWe show that it can be described by means of temperature introduced through the\ncanonical-type distribution. However, the interaction between the particles can\nlead to prominent deviations of the equilibrium distribution of the occupation\nnumbers from the Fermi-Dirac shape.

Both for\nensembles and individual orbits, as N increases there is a smooth convergence\ntowards a continuum limit.

Discreteness effects accelerate\nemittance growth for initially localised clumps. However, even allowing for\ndiscreteness effects one can distinguish between orbits which, in the continuum\nlimit, feel a regular potential, so that emittance grows as a power law in\ntime, and chaotic orbits, where emittance grows exponentially. For sufficiently\nlarge N, one can distinguish two different `kinds' of chaos. Short range\nmicrochaos, associated with close encounters between charges, is a generic\nfeature, yielding large positive Lyapunov exponents X_N which do not decrease\nwith increasing N even if the bulk potential is integrable.

The proofs make use of methods from entanglement\ntheory, as well as of results on matrix functions of block banded matrices.\nDisordered systems are also considered. We moreover construct a class of\nexamples for which the two-point correlation length diverges, yet still an area\nlaw can be proven to hold. We finally consider the scaling of classical\ncorrelations in a classical harmonic system and relate it to a quantum lattice\nsystem with a modified interaction. We briefly comment on a general\nrelationship between criticality and area laws for the entropy of entanglement. \n\n"}

The interaction follows from the obstructions to the (quantum\nmechanical) motions of the fermions caused by the presence of bubbles or other\n(heavy) particles in the Fermi sea, as, for example, nuclei in the neutron sea\nin the inner crust of a neutron star or superfluid grains in a normal Fermi\nliquid. The effect resembles the traditional Casimir interaction between\nmetallic mirrors in the vacuum. However, the fluctuating electromagnetic fields\nare replaced by fermionic matter fields. We show that the fermionic Casimir\nproblem for a system of spherical cavities can be solved exactly, since the\ncalculation can be mapped onto a quantum mechanical billiard problem of a\npoint-particle scattered off a finite number of non-overlapping spheres or\ndisks. Finally we generalize the map method to other Casimir systems,\nespecially to the case of a fluctuating scalar field between two spheres or a\nsphere and a plate under Dirichlet boundary conditions. \n\n"}
