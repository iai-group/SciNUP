Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

For heavy elements (like\niron) the expected linewidth is much larger than the width due to pure thermal\nbroadening and the contribution due to turbulent gas motions should be easily\ndetected with the new generation of X-ray micro-calorimeters, such as the\nSpektr-RG calorimeter (SXC). For instance in the Perseus cluster the turbulent\nvelocity required to balance radiative cooling (as derived by Rebusco et al.\n2006), would imply a width of the 6.7 keV Fe line of 10-20 eV, while the pure\nthermal broadening is ~4 eV.

In a few\nwell-studied cases, these ``short GRBs with extended emission'' show no\nevidence for a bright associated supernova (SN). We propose that these events\nare produced by the formation and early evolution of a highly magnetized,\nrapidly rotating neutron star (a ``proto-magnetar'') which is formed from the\naccretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD), the merger and collapse\nof a WD-WD binary, or, perhaps, the merger of a double neutron star binary. The\ninitial emission spike is powered by accretion onto the proto-magnetar from a\nsmall disk that is formed during the AIC or merger event. The extended emission\nis produced by a relativistic wind that extracts the rotational energy of the\nproto-magnetar on a timescale ~10-100 s. The ~3-10 s delay between the prompt\nand extended emission is the time required for the newly-formed proto-magnetar\nto cool sufficiently that the neutrino-heated wind from its surface becomes\nultra-relativistic. Because a proto-magnetar ejects little or no Ni56 (< 1e-3\nM_sun), these events should not produce a bright SN-like transient.

These induced\nprotogalaxies contain central black holes with mass ~10^5M_sun and look like\ndwarf spheroidal galaxies with central density spike. The subsequent merging of\ninduced protogalaxies and ordinary dark matter haloes corresponds to the\nstandard hierarchical clustering scenario of large-scale structure formation.\nThe coalescence of primordial black holes results in formation of supermassive\nblack holes in the galactic centers. As a result, the observed correlation\nbetween the masses of central black holes and velocity dispersion in the\ngalactic bulges is reproduced. \n\n"}

This\ngas represents the reservoir of material that is available for star formation\nat late times. As a result, observational identification of the systems in\nwhich this neutral hydrogen resides is an important missing ingredient in\nmodels of galaxy formation.

Constant\n  Density Medium Abstract: Direct multi-dimensional numerical simulation is the most reliable approach\nfor calculating the fluid dynamics and observational signatures of relativistic\njets in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We present a two-dimensional relativistic\nhydrodynamic simulation of a GRB outflow during the afterglow phase, which uses\nthe fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme and adaptive mesh\nrefinement. Initially, the jet has a Lorentz factor of 20. We have followed its\nevolution up to 150 years. Using the hydrodynamic data, we calculate\nsynchrotron radiation based upon standard afterglow models and compare our\nresults with previous analytic work. We find that the sideways expansion of a\nrelativistic GRB jet is a very slow process and previous analytic works have\noverestimated its rate. In our computed lightcurves, a very sharp jet break is\nseen and the post-break lightcurves are steeper than analytic predictions. We\nfind that the jet break in GRB afterglow lightcurves is mainly caused by the\nmissing flux when the edge of the jet is observed. The outflow becomes\nnonrelativistic at the end of the Blandford-McKee phase. But it is still highly\nnonspherical, and it takes a rather long time for it to become a spherical\nSedov-von Neumann-Taylor blast wave. We find that the late-time afterglows\nbecome increasingly flatter over time. But we disagree with the common notion\nthat there is a sudden flattening in lightcurves due to the transition into the\nSedov-von Neumann-Taylor solution. We have also found that there is a bump in\nlightcurves at very late times ($\\sim 1000$ days) due to radiation from the\ncounter jet. We speculate that such a counter jet bump might have already been\nobserved in GRB 980703. \n\n"}

The high equivalent widths of the lines imply a high BLR covering\nfactor, and the absence of clear evidence for absorption by the BLR means that\nthe BLR has a flattened distribution and that we always view it near pole-on.\nThe BLR gas is strongly self-shielding near the equatorial plane.\nVelocity-resolved reverberation mapping has long strongly excluded significant\noutflow of the BLR and shows instead that the predominant motions are Keplerian\nwith large turbulence and a significant net inflow. The rotation and turbulence\nare consistent with the inferred geometry. The blueshifting of high-ionization\nlines is a consequence of scattering off inflowing material rather than the\nresult of an outflowing wind. The rate of inflow of the BLR is sufficient to\nprovide the accretion rate needed to power the AGN.

Many proposals have been put forth to\nexplain these data, usually relying on a single particle to annihilate or decay\nto produce e+e-. In this paper, we consider models with multiple species of\nWIMPs with significantly different masses. We show if such dark matter\ncandidates chi_i annihilate into light bosons, they naturally produce equal\nannihilation rates, even as the available numbers of pairs for annihilation\nn_chi_i^2 differ by orders of magnitude. We argue that a consequence of these\nmodels can be to add additional signal naturally at lower (~100 GeV) versus\nhigher (~ TeV) energies, changing the expected spectrum and even adding bumps\nat lower energies, which may alleviate some of the tension in the required\nannihilation rates between PAMELA and Fermi.

At least half of this gas is lost\npermanently to the intracluster medium, as the tail extends beyond the tidal\nradius of the galaxy. We also detect a hot (400-550 K) component in the tail\nthat is approximately 1% of the mass. The large H_2 line to IR continuum\nluminosity ratio in the tail indicates that star formation is not a major\nexcitation source and that the gas is possibly shock-heated. This discovery\nconfirms that the galaxy is currently undergoing ram-pressure stripping, as\nalso indicated by its X-ray and Halpha tails found previously. We estimate the\ngalaxy is losing its warm H_2 gas at a rate of ~ 2-3 solar masses per year. The\ntrue mass loss rate is likely higher if we account for cold molecular gas and\natomic gas. We predict that the galaxy will lose most of its gas in a single\npass through the core and place a strong upper limit on the ram-pressure\ntimescale of 1 Gyr.

Yet we do not understand what drives the evolution of LCBGs, nor how\nthey will evolve. Based on single-dish HI observations, we know that they have\na diverse range of properties. LCBGs are HI-rich with M(HI)=10^{9-10.5} M(sun),\nhave moderate M(dyn)=10^{10-12} M(sun), and 80% have gas depletion timescales\nless than 3 Gyr. These properties are consistent with LCBGs evolving into\nlow-mass spirals or high mass dwarf ellipticals or dwarf irregulars. However,\nLCBGs do not follow the Tully-Fisher relation, nor can most evolve onto it,\nimplying that many LCBGs are not smoothly rotating, virialized systems. GMRT\nand VLA HI maps confirm this conclusion revealing signatures of recent\ninteractions and dynamically hot components in some local LCBGs, consistent\nwith the formation of a thick disk or spheroid. Such signatures and the high\nincidence of close companions around LCBGs suggest that star formation in local\nLCBGs is likely triggered by interactions. The dynamical masses and apparent\nspheroid formation in LCBGs combined with previous results from optical\nspectroscopy are consistent with virial heating being the primary mechanism for\nquenching star formation in these galaxies. \n\n"}

Abstract: It is generally assumed that the central galaxy in a dark matter halo, that\nis, the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy, is also the brightest\nhalo galaxy (BHG), and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matter\npotential well. This central galaxy paradigm (CGP) is an essential assumption\nmade in various fields of astronomical research. In this paper we test the\nvalidity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. For each group we compute two statistics, ${\\cal R}$\nand ${\\cal S}$, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and\nprojected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group\nmembers. By comparing the cumulative distributions of $|{\\cal R}|$ and $|{\\cal\nS}|$ to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out the\nnull-hypothesis that the CGP is correct. Rather, the data indicate that in a\nnon-zero fraction $f_{\\rm BNC}(M)$ of all haloes of mass $M$ the BHG is not the\ncentral galaxy, but instead, a satellite galaxy.

The angular resolution of the maps is as high as\n0.15arcsec, or 20AU at the distance of the Taurus cloud, which is a factor of 2\nhigher than has been achieved to date at these wavelengths. The unprecedented\ndetail of the resulting disk images enables us to address three important\nquestions related to the formation of planets. (1) What is the radial\ndistribution of the circumstellar dust? (2) Does the dust emission show any\nindication of gaps that might signify the presence of (proto-)planets? (3) Do\nthe dust properties depend on the orbital radius? We find that modeling the\ndisk surface density in terms of either a classical power law or the similarity\nsolution for viscous disk evolution, reproduces the observations well. The\n1.3mm image from RYTau shows two peaks separated by 0.2arcsec with a decline in\nthe dust emission toward the stellar position, which is significant at about\n2-4sigma. For both RYTau and DGTau, the dust emission at radii larger than 15\nAU displays no significant deviation from an unperturbed viscous disk model. In\nparticular, no radial gaps in the dust distribution are detected. Under\nreasonable assumptions, we exclude the presence of planets more massive than 5\nJupiter masses orbiting either star at distances between about 10 and 60 AU.\nThe radial variation of the dust opacity slope, beta, was investigated by\ncomparing the 1.3mm and 2.8mm observations.

We\nconsider a limiting case of \"cold\" disk accretion, whereby most of the stellar\nphotosphere can radiate freely with negligible backwarming from the accretion\nflow, and the accreting material settles onto the star with the same specific\nentropy as the photosphere. We compare our results to the calculated evolution\nvia spherically symmetric accretion, the opposite limit, whereby the material\naccreting onto the star contains the entropy produced in the accretion shock\nfront. We examine how different accretion geometries affect the evolution of\nmassive protostars. For cold disk accretion at 10^-3 M_sun/yr the radius of a\nprotostar is initially small, about a few R_sun. After several solar masses\nhave accreted, the protostar begins to bloat up and for M \\simeq 10 M_sun the\nstellar radius attains its maximum of 30 - 400 R_sun. The large radius about\n100 R_sun is also a feature of spherically symmetric accretion at the same\naccreted mass and accretion rate.

In this model optical\nhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circular\nvelocity, at higher redshifts. This model also predicts that the scaling\nrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than the\ncorresponding stellar relations.

Our analysis shows that gas accretion\nplays a role in the evolution of field early-type galaxies, but less so for\nthose in clusters. For detection limits of a few times 10^6 Msun, HI is\ndetected in about 2/3 of the field galaxies, while <10% of the Virgo objects\nare detected. In about half of the detections, the HI forms a regularly\nrotating disc or ring. All HI discs have counterparts of ionised gas and inner\nHI discs are also detected in molecular gas. The cold ISM is dominated by\nmolecular gas (M_H2/M_HI ~ 10). We conclude that accretion of HI is common for\nfield early-type galaxies, but the amount of material involved is usually\nsmall. Cluster galaxies appear not to accrete HI.

These processes can either reduce\nthe energy requirements for AGN heating of cool cores, or they can prevent\novercooling altogether. We perform 3D MHD simulations including field-aligned\nthermal conduction and self-gravitating particles to model this in detail.\nTurbulence is not confined to the wakes of galaxies but is instead\nvolume-filling, due to the excitation of large-scale g-modes.

Inefficient fueling (and/or\nfeedback) from fast stellar winds has been invoked to explain this, but we\nargue this is unlikely in bright systems accreting primarily cold dense gas. We\nshow that such a delay can arise even in bright quasars for purely dynamical\nreasons. If some large-scale process produces rapid inflow, smaller scales will\nquickly become gas-dominated. As the gas density peaks, so does the SFR.\nHowever, gravitational torques which govern further inflow are relatively\ninefficient in gas-dominated systems; as more gas is turned into stars, the\nstars provide an efficient angular momentum sink allowing more rapid inflow.\nMoreover, the gas provided to the central regions in mergers or strong disk\ninstabilities will typically be ~100 times larger than that needed to fuel the\nBH; the system is effectively in the 'infinite gas supply' limit. BH growth can\ntherefore continue for some time while the gas supply exhausts, until it has\nsignificantly depleted to the point where the BH is finally 'starved.' Both of\nthese effects act together with comparable magnitude, and mean that the peak of\nBH growth can lag the peak in the SFR measured at a given scale by a timescale\ncorresponding to the gas exhaustion time on that scale (~ 10-100 local\ndynamical times).

Magnetic fields in LG dwarfs are three times weaker than in\nthe normal spirals (<4.2+-1.8muG). The production of total magnetic fields\nappears to be regulated mainly by the star-formation surface density, with the\npower-law exponent of 0.30+-0.04, or by the gas surface density (with the\nexponent 0.47+-0.09). In addition, we find systematically stronger fields in\nobjects of higher global star-formation rate.

In this paper, the first in a series, we present and test a novel\nnumerical implementation of stellar feedback resulting from momentum imparted\nto the ISM by radiation, supernovae, and stellar winds. We employ a realistic\ncooling function, and find that a large fraction of the gas cools to <100K, so\nthat the ISM becomes highly inhomogeneous. Despite this, our simulated galaxies\nreach an approximate steady state, in which gas gravitationally collapses to\nform giant molecular clouds (GMCs), dense clumps, and stars; subsequently,\nstellar feedback disperses the GMCs, repopulating the diffuse ISM. This\ncollapse and dispersal cycle is seen in models of SMC-like dwarfs, the\nMilky-Way, and z~2 clumpy disk analogues. The simulated global star formation\nefficiencies are consistent with the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.\nMoreover, the star formation rates are nearly independent of the numerically\nimposed high-density star formation efficiency, density threshold, and density\nscaling. This is a consequence of the fact that, in our simulations, star\nformation is regulated by stellar feedback limiting the amount of very dense\ngas available for forming stars. In contrast, in simulations without stellar\nfeedback, i.e. under the action of only gravity and gravitationally-induced\nturbulence, the ISM experiences runaway collapse to very high densities. In\nthese simulations without feedback, the global star formation rates exceed\nobserved galactic star formation rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude,\ndemonstrating that stellar feedback is crucial to the regulation of star\nformation in galaxies. \n\n"}

Abstract: To gain new insights into the radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy reported for\nactive galactic nuclei, we examine radio loudness as a function of Eddington\nratio for a previously published sample of 199 AGN from five different\npopulations. After initially considering radio loudnesses derived using total\nradio luminosities, we repeat the investigation using core radio luminosities\nonly, applying a previously established mass correction for these core\nluminosities. In both cases, for Eddington ratios < 1 per cent, Fanaroff-Riley\ntype I and broad-line radio galaxies are on average more radio-loud than\nSeyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. However, the\ndistribution of radio loudnesses for the mass-corrected, core-only sample is\nmuch narrower than that of the clearly bimodal total radio loudness\ndistribution. The advantages and disadvantages of using core- or lobe-dominated\nradio luminosity as a measure of instantaneous jet power are discussed. We\nfurthermore compare the core and total radio luminosities for the entire\nsample, as well as illustrating the importance of the mass term by comparing\nthe AGN with a sample of black hole X-ray binaries.

We study the impact of this effect on\nthe star formation history of galaxies. We incorporate metallicity-dependent\nstar formation and metal enrichment in a simple model that follows the\nevolution of a halo main progenitor. Our model shows that including the effect\nof metallicity leads to suppression of star formation at redshift z>2 in dark\nhalos with masses <~ 10^11 Msun, with the suppression becoming near total for\nhalos below ~10^9.5-10 Msun. We find that at high redshift the SFR cannot catch\nup with the gas inflow rate (IR), because the SFR is limited by the free-fall\ntime, and because it is suppressed further by a lack of metals. As a result, in\neach galaxy the SFR is growing in time faster than the IR, and the integrated\ncosmic SFR density is rising with time. The suppressed in situ SFR at high z\nmakes the growth of stellar mass dominated by ex situ SFR which implies that\nthe specific SFR (sSFR) remains constant with time. The intensely accreted gas\nat high z is accumulating as an atomic gas reservoir. This provides additional\nfuel for star formation in 10^10 - 10^12 Msun halos at z ~ 1-3, which allows\nthe SFR to exceed the instantaneous IR, and may enable an even higher outflow\nrate. At z<1, following the natural decline in IR with time due to the\nuniversal expansion, the SFR and sSFR are expected to drop. We specify the\nexpected dependence of sSFR and metallicity on stellar mass and redshift. At a\ngiven z, and below a critical mass, these relations are predicted to be flat\nand rising respectively. Our model predictions qualitatively match some of the\npuzzling features in the observed star formation history. \n\n"}

The inclusion of SPIRE data shows that estimates\nbased on data not reaching these far-IR wavelengths are biased low.

We\nuse a collection of several state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulations to study the halo contraction effect in systems ranging from dwarf\ngalaxies to clusters of galaxies, at high and low redshift.

Classical bulges are thought to form by\ngalactic merger with bursty star formation, whereas pseudobulges are suggested\nto form by secular evolution due to spiral arms and a barred structure\nfunneling gas into the galactic centre. Noguchi (1998,1999) suggested another\nbulge formation scenario, `clump-origin bulge'. He demonstrated using a\nnumerical simulation that a galactic disc suffers dynamical instability to form\nclumpy structures in the early stage of disc formation since the premature disc\nis expected to be highly gas-rich, then the clumps are sucked into the galactic\ncentre by dynamical friction and merge into a single bulge at the centre. This\nbulge formation scenario, which is expected to happen only at the\nhigh-redshift, is different from the galactic merger and the secular evolution.\nTherefore, clump-origin bulges may have their own unique properties. We perform\na high-resolution N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation for\nthe formation of the clump-origin bulge in an isolated galaxy model and study\ndynamical and chemical properties of the clump-origin bulge. We find that the\nclump-origin bulge resembles pseudobulges in dynamical properties, a nearly\nexponential surface density profile, a barred boxy shape and a significant\nrotation. We also find that this bulge consists of old and metal-rich stars,\ndisplaying resemblance to classical bulges. These natures, old metal-rich\npopulation but pseudobulge-like structures, mean that the clump-origin bulge\ncan not be simply classified into classical bulges nor pseudobulges. From these\nresults, we discuss similarities of the clump-origin bulge to the Milky Way\nbulge. \n\n"}

This DM mass scale (warm DM) is in agreement with both\ncosmological and galactic observations.

Our\nfiducial model assumes an efficiency of ~0.5 per dynamical time for the decay\nof turbulence energy, and ~0.02 for each of the processes that deplete the disc\ngas, i.e., star formation, outflow, and inflow within the disc into a central\nbulge. In this case, the in-streaming drives a ratio of turbulent to rotation\nvelocity sigma/V~0.2-0.3, which at z~2 induces an instability with Q~1, both as\nobserved. However, in conflict with observations, this model predicts that\nsigma/V remains constant with time, independent of the cosmological accretion\nrate, because mass and turbulence have the same external source.

The variation of brightness temperature due to the silicate\nfeatures can be up to 20 K for an airless Earth analog, and the silicate\nfeatures are wide enough to be distinguished from atmospheric features with\nrelatively high-resolution spectra. The surface characterization thus provides\na method to unambiguously identify a rocky exoplanet. Furthermore,\nidentification of specific rocky surface types is possible with the planet's\nreflectance spectrum in near-infrared broad bands. A key parameter to observe\nis the difference between K band and J band geometric albedos (A_g (K)-A_g\n(J)): A_g (K)-A_g (J) > 0.2 indicates that more than half of the planet's\nsurface has abundant mafic minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene, in other\nwords primary crust from a magma ocean or high-temperature lavas; A_g (K)-A_g\n(J) < -0.09 indicates that more than half of the planet's surface is covered or\npartially covered by water ice or hydrated silicates, implying extant or past\nwater on its surface.

From a detailed analysis of the photometry, each object is found\nto have a 1216 A continuum luminosity in excess of L ~1e23 W/Hz, a critical\nvalue above which 21-cm has never been detected at any redshift. At these\nwavelengths, and below, hydrogen is excited above the ground state so that it\ncannot absorb in 21-cm. In order to apply the equation of photoionsation\nequilibrium, we demonstrate that this critical value also applies to the\nionising (< 912 A) radiation. We use this to show, for a variety of gas density\ndistributions, that upon placing a quasar within a galaxy of gas there is\nalways an ultra-violet luminosity above which all of the gas in the galaxy is\nionised. While in this state the hydrogen cannot be detected nor cannot engage\nin star formation.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the formation mechanism of MSPs by considering the pulsar recycling\nprocess in both intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) and low-mass X-ray\nbinaries (LMXBs). The IMXBs mainly lead to the formation of binary MSPs with a\nmassive carbon-oxygen (CO) or an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf (ONeMg WD)\ncompanion, whereas the LMXBs form recycled pulsars with a helium white dwarf\n(He WD) companion. We discuss the accretion physics leading to the spin-up line\nin the PPdot-diagram and demonstrate that such a line cannot be uniquely\ndefined. We derive a simple expression for the amount of accreted mass needed\nfor any given pulsar to achieve its equilibrium spin and apply this to explain\nthe observed differences of the spin distributions of recycled pulsars with\ndifferent types of companions. From numerical calculations we present further\nevidence for significant loss of rotational energy in accreting X-ray MSPs in\nLMXBs during the Roche-lobe decoupling phase (Tauris 2012) and demonstrate that\nthe same effect is negligible in IMXBs. We examine the recycling of pulsars\nwith CO WD companions via Case BB Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) of naked helium\nstars in post common envelope binaries. We find that such pulsars typically\naccrete of the order 0.002-0.007 M_sun which is just about sufficient to\nexplain their observed spin periods. We introduce isochrones of radio MSPs in\nthe PPdot-diagram to follow their spin evolution and discuss their true ages\nfrom comparison with observations. Finally, we apply our results of the spin-up\nprocess to the massive pulsar J1614-2230 (Paper I) and put new constraints on\nthe birth masses of a number of recycled pulsars. [Abridged] \n\n"}

Our new observations more than double the total number of\nspectroscopic stellar population age and metallicity measurements published for\nuntargeted SN Ibc host environments, and extend to a median redshift about\ntwice as large as previous statistical studies (z = 0.04).

However, the median\nmetallicity of the 7 broad-lined SN Ic (SN Ic-BL) in our sample is\nsignificantly lower, log(O/H)+12 = 8.34.

Networks of GW interferometers\nhave poor angular resolution on the sky and their EM signatures are predicted\nto be faint. Therefore, a challenging goal will be to unambiguously pinpoint\nthe EM counterparts to GW mergers. We perform the first comprehensive\nend-to-end simulation that focuses on: i) GW sky localization, distance\nmeasures and volume errors with two compact binary populations and four\ndifferent GW networks, ii) subsequent detectability by a slew of\nmultiwavelength telescopes and, iii) final identification of the merger\ncounterpart amidst a sea of possible astrophysical false-positives. First, we\nfind that double neutron star (NS) binary mergers can be detected out to a\nmaximum distance of 400 Mpc (or 750 Mpc) by three (or five) detector GW\nnetworks respectively.

Here we use cosmological zoom simulations of galaxy formation down to z\n= 2 to show that such strong self-regulation is required in the popular\nspherical Bondi accretion model, but that a plausible alternative model in\nwhich black hole growth is limited by galaxy-scale torques does not require\nself-regulation. Instead, this torque-limited accretion model yields black\nholes and galaxies evolving on average along the observed scaling relations by\nrelying only on a fixed, 5% mass retention rate onto the black hole from the\nradius at which the accretion flow is fed. Feedback from the black hole may\n(and likely does) occur, but does not need to couple to galaxy-scale gas in\norder to regulate black hole growth. We show that this result is insensitive to\nvariations in the initial black hole mass, stellar feedback, or other\nimplementation details. The torque-limited model allows for high accretion\nrates at very early epochs (unlike the Bondi case), which if viable can help\nexplain the rapid early growth of black holes, while by z = 2 it yields\nEddington factors of 1%-10%. This model also yields a less direct\ncorrespondence between major merger events and rapid phases of black hole\ngrowth. Instead, growth is more closely tied to cosmological disk feeding,\nwhich may help explain observational studies showing that, at least at z > 1,\nactive galaxies do not preferentially show merger signatures. \n\n"}

A gap-opening secondary close to the primary will\nleave an imprint in the broad component of the FeKa emission line, which varies\nin a unique and predictable manner. If the gap persists into the innermost\ndisk, the effect consists of a pair of dips in the broad line which ripple\nblue-ward and red-ward from the line centroid energy respectively, as the gap\nmoves closer to the primary. This ripple effect could be unambiguously\ndetectable and allow an electromagnetic monitoring of massive black hole\nmergers as they occur. As the mass ratio of the secondary to primary black hole\nincreases to q>0.01, we expect the gap to widen, possibly clearing a central\ncavity in the inner disk, which shows up in the broad FeKa line component. If\nthe secondary stalls at >100r_{g} in its in-migration, due to low co-rotating\ngas mass, a detectable ripple effect occurs in the broad line component on the\ndisk viscous timescale as the inner disk drains and the outer disk is dammed.\nIf the secondary maintains an accretion disk within a central cavity, due to\ndam bursting or leakage, a periodic 'see-saw' oscillation effect is exhibited\nin the observed line profile. Here we demonstrate the range of ripple effect\nsignatures potentially detectable with Astro-H and IXO/Athena, and oscillation\neffects potentially detectable with XMM or LOFT for a wide variety of merger\nand disk conditions. Observations of the ripple effect and periodic\noscillations can be used to provide an early warning of gravitational radiation\nemission from the AGN. \n\n"}

Abstract: The kinematic analysis of dark matter and hydrodynamical simulations suggests\nthat the vorticity in large-scale structure is mostly confined to, and\npredominantly aligned with their filaments, with an excess of probability of 20\nper cent to have the angle between vorticity and filaments direction lower than\n60 degrees relative to random orientations. The cross sections of these\nfilaments are typically partitioned into four quadrants with opposite vorticity\nsign, arising from multiple flows, originating from neighbouring walls. The\nspins of halos embedded within these filaments are consistently aligned with\nthis vorticity for any halo mass, with a stronger alignment for the most\nmassive structures up to an excess of probability of 165 per cent. On large\nscales, adiabatic/cooling hydrodynamical simulations display the same vorticity\nin the gas as in the dark matter. The global geometry of the flow within the\ncosmic web is therefore qualitatively consistent with a spin acquisition for\nsmaller halos induced by this large-scale coherence, as argued in Codis et al.\n(2012). In effect, secondary anisotropic infall (originating from the\nvortex-rich filament within which these lower-mass halos form) dominates the\nangular momentum budget of these halos. The transition mass from alignment to\northogonality is related to the size of a given multi-flow region with a given\npolarity.

The long-term evolution of SF rates and H_alpha\nmorphologies corresponding to the distributions of star-forming regions are\nparticularly investigated for different model parameters. The principal results\nare as follows. Whether ram pressure can enhance or reduce SF depends on M_h of\ndisk galaxies and inclination angles of gas disks with respect to their orbital\ndirections for a given orbit and a given environment. For example, SF can be\nmoderately enhanced in disk galaxies with M_h=10^12 M_sun at the pericenter\npassages in a cluster with M_h=10^14 M_sun whereas it can be completely shut\ndown (`quenching') for low-mass disks with M_h=10^10 M_sun.

The existing tension between Planck determination of these\nparameters in the frame of the base LambdaCDM model and their direct\nmeasurements generated lively discussions and several interpretations. In this\npaper we quantify this tension by exploring several extensions of the base\nLambdaCDM model that include the leptonic asymmetry. We set bounds on the\nradiation content of the Universe and neutrino properties by using the latest\ncosmological measurements, imposing also self-consistent BBN constraints on the\nprimordial helium abundance. For all cosmological asymmetric models we find the\npreference of cosmological data for smaller values of active and sterile\nneutrino masses. This increases the tension between cosmological and short\nbaseline neutrino oscillation data that favor a sterile neutrino with the mass\nof around 1 eV. For the case of degenerate massive neutrinos, we find that the\ndiscrepancies with direct determinations of the Hubble constant, the present\ncluster abundances and the age of the Universe are alleviated at ~ 1.3 sigma\nfor all leptonic asymmetric models.

The strength of the halo field is\ncomparable to that of the disk. The total and turbulent magnetic field strength\nis (weakly) increasing with the star formation. There are, however, indications\nthat stronger star formation reduces the magnetic field regularity globally.\nThe magnetic field in spiral galaxies is generally thought to be amplified and\nmaintained by dynamo action. During the galaxy's formation and evolution the\nturbulent dynamo amplifies the field strength to energy equipartition with the\nturbulent gas, while the large-scale (mean-field) dynamo mainly orders the\nmagnetic field. Hence, the large-scale magnetic field pattern evolves with\ntime. Supernova explosions causes a further continuous injection of turbulent\nmagnetic fields. Assuming that this small-scale field injection is situated\nonly within the spiral arm region where star formation mostly occurs lead to a\nlarge-scale field structure in which the magnetic field regularity is stronger\nin the interarm region as observed in several nearby spiral galaxies.

The SFR-dependence of the slope of the TH-IGIMF is found to be key\nto reproducing the correct [a/Fe]-stellar mass relation.

As a consequence of our analysis, the\nvalue of the minimum embedded star cluster mass and of the slope of the\nembedded cluster mass function, which are free parameters involved in the\nTH-IGIMF theory, are found to be as low as 5 solar masses and 2, respectively.\nA mild downsizing trend is present for galaxies generated assuming either a\nuniversal IMF or a variable TH-IGIMF.

Since AGN type is defined by the presence\nof broad emission lines in the optical spectrum, our observations demonstrate\nthat Mrk 590 has now become a \"changing look\" AGN.

We explore the formation of a protostar resulting from the collapse of\nprimordial gas in the presence of a strong Lyman-Werner radiation background.\nParticularly, we investigate the impact of turbulence and rotation on the\nfragmentation behaviour of the gas cloud.

The peak VLBI flux densities of these sources range\nfrom about 10 to 100 mJy/beam, and parsec-scale jet structure is detected in\nall sources. About half of the VLBI cores are resolved, with brightness\ntemperature upper limits of a few times 10^10 K, and we find that a brightness\ntemperature of about 2x10^10 K is consistent with the VLBI data for all but one\nof the sources. Such brightness temperatures do not require any relativistic\nbeaming to reduce the observed value below commonly invoked intrinsic limits;\nhowever, the lack of detection of counter-jets does place a modest limit on the\nbulk Lorentz factor of greater than about 2. These data are thus consistent\nwith a picture where weak-jet sources like the TeV HBLs develop significant\nvelocity structures on parsec-scales. We also extend consideration to the full\nsample of TeV HBLs by combining the new VLBI data with VLBI and gamma-ray data\nfrom the literature. By comparing measured VLBI and TeV fluxes to samples with\nintrinsically uncorrelated luminosities generated by Monte Carlo simulations,\nwe find a marginally significant correlation between the VLBI and TeV fluxes\nfor the full TeV HBL sample. \n\n"}

The theory provides an exponential (inflationary) scale factor\nindependent of the choice of the sectional curvature. In addition, the obtained\n$f(T)$ acts just like cosmological constant in the flat space model.\nNevertheless, it is dynamical in non-flat models. In particular, the open\nuniverse provides a decaying pattern of the $f(T)$ contributing directly to\nsolve the fine-tuning problem of the cosmological constant.

Abstract: We present follow-up observations of an optical transient (OT) discovered by\nROTSE on Jan. 21, 2009. Photometric monitoring was carried out with ROTSE-IIIb\nin the optical and Swift in the UV up to +70 days after discovery. The light\ncurve showed a fast rise time of ~10 days followed by a steep decline over the\nnext 60 days, which was much faster than that implied by 56Ni - 56Co\nradioactive decay. The SDSS DR10 database contains a faint, red object at the\nposition of the OT, which appears slightly extended. This and other lines of\nevidence suggest that the OT is of extragalactic origin, and this faint object\nis likely the host galaxy. A sequence of optical spectra obtained with the\n9.2-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) between +8 and +45 days after discovery\nrevealed a hot, blue continuum with no visible spectral features. A few weak\nfeatures that appeared after +30 days probably originated from the underlying\nhost. Fitting synthetic templates to the observed spectrum of the host galaxy\nrevealed a redshift of z = 0.19. At this redshift the peak magnitude of the OT\nis close to -22.5, similar to the brightest super-luminous supernovae; however,\nthe lack of identifiable spectral features makes the massive stellar death\nhypothesis less likely. A more plausible explanation appears to be the tidal\ndisruption of a sun-like star by the central super-massive black hole. We argue\nthat this transient likely belongs to a class of super-Eddington tidal\ndisruption events. \n\n"}

The uncertainties in the\ninclination and the surface properties of a few rapidly rotating stars have\nbeen substantially reduced by interferometric observations over the last\ndecade, and these stars can be used as tests of rotating stellar models, even\nif those stars themselves may not be Be stars.

In the former, an abundance of resonant chains is\nexpected, which the Kepler data do not support. In the latter, required disk\nmass surface densities may be too high. A recently proposed mechanism\nhypothesizes that planets form in situ at the pressure trap associated with the\ndead-zone inner boundary (DZIB) where radially drifting \"pebbles\" accumulate.\nThis scenario predicts planet masses ($M_p$) are set by the gap-opening process\nthat then leads to DZIB retreat, followed by sequential, inside-out planet\nformation (IOPF).

These capture advantages of both smoothed-particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) and adaptive mesh-refinement (AMR) schemes. Here, we extend\nthese to include ideal magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD). The MHD equations are\nsecond-order consistent and conservative. We augment these with a\ndivergence-cleaning scheme, which maintains div*B~0 to high accuracy. We\nimplement these in the code GIZMO, together with a state-of-the-art\nimplementation of SPH MHD. In every one of a large suite of test problems, the\nnew methods are competitive with moving-mesh and AMR schemes using constrained\ntransport (CT) to ensure div*B=0. They are able to correctly capture the growth\nand structure of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), MHD turbulence, and\nthe launching of magnetic jets, in some cases converging more rapidly than AMR\ncodes. Compared to SPH, the MFM/MFV methods exhibit proper convergence at fixed\nneighbor number, sharper shock capturing, and dramatically reduced noise, div*B\nerrors, and diffusion. Still, 'modern' SPH is able to handle most of our tests,\nat the cost of much larger kernels and 'by hand' adjustment of artificial\ndiffusion parameters. Compared to AMR, the new meshless methods exhibit\nenhanced 'grid noise' but reduced advection errors and numerical diffusion,\nvelocity-independent errors, and superior angular momentum conservation and\ncoupling to N-body gravity solvers. As a result they converge more slowly on\nsome problems (involving smooth, slowly-moving flows) but more rapidly on\nothers (involving advection or rotation). In all cases, divergence-control\nbeyond the popular Powell 8-wave approach is necessary, or else all methods we\nconsider will systematically converge to unphysical solutions. \n\n"}

Moreover as a UV resonance line, Lya\npossesses several unique characteristics that make it useful to study the ISM\nand ionizing stellar population at all cosmic epochs. In this review I present\na summary of Lya observations of galaxies in the nearby universe. At UV\nmagnitudes reachable with current facilities, only ~5% of the local galaxy\npopulation shows a Lya equivalent width (EW_Lya) that exceeds 20\\AA. This\nfraction increases dramatically at higher z, but only in the local universe can\nwe study galaxies in detail and assemble unprecedented multi-wavelength\ndatasets. I discuss many local Lya observations, showing that when galaxies\nshow net Lya emission, they ubiquitously produce large halos of scattered Lya,\nthat dominate the integrated luminosity.

This is connected with various properties, such that\nLya-emitters have lower metallicities (median value of 12+log(O/H) ~ 8.1) and\ndust reddening. However, the presence of galactic outflows is also vital to\nDoppler shift the Lya line out of resonance with the HI, as high EW_Lya is\nfound only among galaxies with winds faster than ~50km/s. The evidence is then\nassembled into a coherent picture, and the requirement for star formation\ndriven feedback is discussed in the context of an evolutionary sequence where\nthe ISM is accelerated and/or subject to fluid instabilities, which reduce the\nscattering of Lya.

Most studies so far have focused on large\ngalaxies, but dwarfs might also experience such events, since the halo mass\nfunction is scale-free in the concordance cosmological model. Notably, because\nof their low mass, most of their interactions will be with dark satellites. In\nthis paper we follow the evolution of gas-rich disky dwarf galaxies as they\nexperience a minor merger with a dark satellite. We aim to characterize the\neffects of such an interaction on the dwarf's star formation, morphology, and\nkinematical properties. We performed a suite of carefully set-up hydrodynamical\nsimulations of dwarf galaxies that include dark matter, gas, and stars merging\nwith a satellite consisting solely of dark matter. For the host system we vary\nthe gas fraction, disk size and thickness, halo mass, and concentration, while\nwe explore different masses, concentrations, and orbits for the satellite. We\nfind that the interactions cause strong starbursts of both short and long\nduration in the dwarfs. Their star formation rates increase by factors of a few\nto 10 or more. They are strongest for systems with extended gas disks and high\ngas fractions merging with a high-concentration satellite on a planar, radial\norbit. In contrast to analogous simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, many of\nthe systems experience strong morphological changes and become spheroidal even\nin the presence of significant amounts of gas. The simulated systems compare\nremarkably well with the observational properties of a large selection of\nirregular dwarf galaxies and blue compact dwarfs. This implies that mergers\nwith dark satellites might well be happening but not be fully evident, and may\nthus play a role in the diversity of the dwarf galaxy population. \n\n"}

During the first second\nafter bounce, the spiral mode of the Standing Accretion Shock Instability\n(SASI) is able to redistribute angular momentum and spin-up a neutron star born\nfrom a non-rotating progenitor. Our aim is to assess the robustness of this\nprocess. We perform 2D numerical simulations of a simplified setup in\ncylindrical geometry to investigate the timescale over which the dynamics is\ndominated by a spiral or a sloshing mode. We observe that the spiral mode\nprevails only if the ratio of the initial shock radius to the neutron star\nradius exceeds a critical value. In that regime, both the degree of asymmetry\nand the average expansion of the shock induced by the spiral mode increase\nmonotonously with this ratio, exceeding the values obtained when a sloshing\nmode is artificially imposed. With a timescale of 2-3 SASI oscillations, the\ndynamics of SASI takes place fast enough to affect the spin of the neutron star\nbefore the explosion. The spin periods deduced from the simulations are\ncompared favorably to analytical estimates evaluated from the measured\nsaturation amplitude of the SASI wave. Despite the simplicity of our setup,\nnumerical simulations revealed unexpected stochastic variations, including a\nreversal of the direction of rotation of the shock.

When\ninitiated with a vertical magnetic field of either zero or finite net flux, our\nglobal cylindrical simulations exhibit the magnetorotational instability (MRI)\nand large scale dynamo growth of radially alternating mean fields, averaged\nover height and azimuth. This dynamo growth is explained by our analytic\ncalculations of a non-axisymmetric fluctuation-induced EMF that is sustained by\nazimuthal shear of the fluctuating fields. The standard \"Omega effect\" (shear\nof the mean field by differential rotation) is unimportant. For the MRI case,\nwe express the large-scale dynamo field as a function of differential rotation.\nThe resulting radially alternating large-scale fields may have implications for\nangular momentum transport in disks and corona.

The majority of elliptical and lenticular\ngalaxies have relaxed structure, showing no signs of ongoing star formation.\nStructurally-disturbed galaxies, which tend to avoid the lowest-density\nregions, have higher star-formation activity and younger stellar populations\nthan undisturbed systems. Cluster spirals with reduced/quenched star formation\nhave somewhat less disturbed morphologies than spirals with \"normal\"\nstar-formation activity, suggesting that these \"passive\" spirals have started\ntheir morphological transformation into S0s. Visually identified mergers and\ngalaxies not identified as mergers but with similar roughness have similar\nspecific star formation rates and stellar ages. The degree of enhanced star\nformation is thus linked to the degree of structural disturbance, regardless of\nwhether it is caused by major mergers or not. This suggests that merging\ngalaxies are not special in terms of their higher-than-normal star-formation\nactivity. Any physical process that produces \"roughness\", or regions of\nenhanced luminosity density, will increase the star-formation activity in a\ngalaxy with similar efficiency. An alternative explanation is that star\nformation episodes increase the galaxies' roughness similarly, regardless of\nwhether they are merger-induced or not. \n\n"}

Dwarf galaxies in the field are often observed to\nhave peculiarities in their structure, morphology, and kinematics, as well as\nstrong bursts of star formation without apparent cause. We aim to characterize\nthe signatures of minor mergers of dwarf galaxies with dark satellites to aid\ntheir observational identification. We explore and quantify a variety of\nstructural, morphological, and kinematic indicators of merging dwarf galaxies\nand their remnants using a suite of hydrodynamical simulations. The most\nsensitive indicators of mergers with dark satellites are large asymmetries in\nthe gaseous and stellar distributions, enhanced central surface brightness and\nstarbursts, and velocity offsets and misalignments between the cold gas and\nstellar components. In general, merging systems span a wide range of values of\nthe most commonly used indicators, while isolated objects tend to have more\nconfined values.

For slowly rotating stars the\ncentre-to-limb convective variation dominated the residuals (with amplitudes of\n10s of cm/s to ~1 m/s); however, for faster rotating stars the dominant\nresidual signature was due a non-Gaussian intrinsic profile (with amplitudes\nfrom 0.5-9 m/s).

In linear theory, this cross-correlation\ncontains only monopole and quadrupole terms. At scales greater than the void\nradius, linear theory is a good match to voids traced out by haloes in N-body\nsimulations; small-scale random velocities are unimportant at these radii, only\ntending to cause small and often negligible elongation of the redshift-space\ncross-correlation function near its origin. By extracting the monopole and\nquadrupole from the cross-correlation function, we measure the linear growth\nrate without prior knowledge of the void profile or velocity dispersion. We\nrecover the linear growth parameter $\\beta$ to 9% precision from an effective\nvolume of 3(Gpc/h)^3 using voids with radius greater than 25Mpc/h. Smaller\nvoids are predominantly sub-voids, which may be more sensitive to the random\nvelocity dispersion; they introduce noise and do not help to improve the\nmeasurement. Adding velocity dispersion as a free parameter allows us to use\ninformation at radii as small as half of the void radius. The precision on\n$\\beta$ is reduced to approximately 5%. Contrary to the simple redshift-space\ndistortion pattern in overdensities, voids show diverse shapes in redshift\nspace, and can appear either elongated or flattened along the line of sight.\nThis can be explained by the competing amplitudes of the local density\ncontrast, plus the radial velocity profile and its gradient, with the latter\ntwo factors being determined by the cumulative density profile of voids. The\ndistortion pattern is therefore determined solely by the void profile and is\ndifferent for void-in-cloud and void-in-void. This diversity of redshift-space\nvoid morphology complicates measurements of the Alcock-Paczynski effect using\nvoids. \n\n"}

Using this large and homogeneous\ncatalog of UV and blue photometry, we demonstrate that the HB exhibits\ndiscontinuities that are remarkably consistent in color (effective\ntemperature). This consistency is apparent even among some of the most massive\nclusters hosting multiple distinct sub-populations (such as NGC 2808, omega\nCen, and NGC 6715), demonstrating that these phenomena are primarily driven by\natmospheric physics that is independent of the underlying population\nproperties.

The N-body subhalo study of Chamberlain et al. verified\nthis picture and pointed out a useful observational consequence: measurements\nof subhalo correlations beyond the tidal radius are sensitive to the infall\ntime, t_infall, of the subhalo onto its host. We perform this cross-correlation\nmeasurement using ~ 160,000 red satellite galaxies in SDSS redMaPPer clusters\nand find evidence that subhalo correlations do persist well beyond the tidal\nradius, suggesting that many of the observed satellites fell into their current\nhost less than a dynamical time ago, t_infall < t_dyn.

By comparing the distribution\nof the reflection fraction, the ratio of the normalization of the reflected\ncomponent to the direct radiation, we find that the low-luminosity,\nlow-redshift sub-sample had systematically higher reflection fraction values\nthan the high-redshift, high-luminosity one. On the other hand, no significant\ndifference is found between samples having similar luminosity but different\nredshift, suggesting that the structure of the torus does not evolve strongly\nwith redshift.

We oppose this opinion\nand show that two main factors are responsible for the extremely low intensity\nof the observed stellar EBL: (1) a low mean surface brightness of galaxies,\nwhich causes a low luminosity density in the local Universe, and (2) light\nextinction due to absorption by galactic and intergalactic dust. Dust produces\na partial opacity of galaxies and of the Universe. The galactic opacity reduces\nthe intensity of light from more distant background galaxies obscured by\nforeground galaxies. The effective extinction AV for light passing through a\ngalaxy is 0.2 mag. This causes that distant background galaxies do not\ncontribute to the EBL significantly. In addition, light of distant galaxies is\ndimmed due to absorption by intergalactic dust. Even a minute intergalactic\nopacity of 1x10^(-2) mag per Gpc is high enough to produce significant effects\non the EBL. The absorbed starlight heats up the galactic and intergalactic dust\nand is further re-radiated at the IR, FIR and micro-wave spectrum.

However, if dust is\nconsidered, the predicted stellar EBL is about 290 nWm^(-2)sr^(-1), which is\nonly 5 times higher than the observed value. Hence, the presence of dust has\nhigher impact on the EBL than currently assumed. In the expanding universe, the\ncalculated value of the EBL is further decreased, because the obscuration\neffect and intergalactic absorption become more pronounced at high redshifts\nwhen the matter was concentrated at smaller volume than at present. \n\n"}

Since $^{13}$CO is emitted from the\nsame medium as the $^{12}$CO, but saturates at a much higher column density,\nthis cross-correlation provides valuable information about both the gas density\ndistribution and isotopologue ratio, inaccessible from the $^{12}$CO alone.\nUsing a simple model of these molecular emission lines, we show that a future\nintensity mapping survey can constrain the abundance ratio of these two species\nand the fraction of emission from optically thick regions to order $\\sim30\\%$.\nThese measurements cannot be made by traditional CO observations, and\nconsequently the proposed method will provide unique insight into the physics\nof star formation, feedback, and galactic ecology at high redshifts. \n\n"}

These data are used to refine the lens model of SDSS\nJ2222+2745, compute the time delay and magnifications of the lensed quasar\nimages, and reconstruct the source image of the quasar host and a second lensed\ngalaxy at z=2.3. This second galaxy also appears in absorption in our Gemini\nspectra of the lensed quasar, at a projected distance of 34 kpc. Our model is\nin agreement with the recent time delay measurements of Dahle et al. (2015),\nwho found tAB=47.7+/-6.0 days and tAC=-722+/-24 days. We use the observed time\ndelays to further constrain the model, and find that the model-predicted time\ndelays of the three faint images of the quasar are tAD=502+/-68 days,\ntAE=611+/-75 days, and tAF=415+/-72 days. We have initiated a follow-up\ncampaign to measure these time delays with Gemini North. Finally, we present\ninitial results from an X-ray monitoring program with Swift, indicating the\npresence of hard X-ray emission from the lensed quasar, as well as extended\nX-ray emission from the cluster itself, which is consistent with the lensing\nmass measurement and the cluster velocity dispersion. \n\n"}

The BS provides the dynamical\norigin of the electroweak symmetry breaking, triggered by mixing between the\nelementary Higgs and a composite Higgs generated by a new-color strong\ndynamics, hypercolor (HC). At the HC strong coupling scale, the classical-scale\ninvariance assumed in the model is dynamically broken as well as the \"chiral\"\nsymmetry present in the HC sector. In addition to the composite Higgs, HC\nbaryons emerge to potentially be stable because of the unbroken HC baryon\nnumber symmetry. Hence the lightest HC baryon can be a DM candidate. Of\ninterest in the present scenario is that HC pions can be as heavy as the HC\nbaryon due to the possibly enhanced-explicit \"chiral\"-breaking effect triggered\nafter the BS mechanism, so the HC baryon pair cannot annihilate into HC pions.\nAs in the standard setup of freeze-in scenario, it is assumed that the DM was\nnever in the thermal equilibrium, which ends up with no thermal abundance. It\nis then the non-thermal BSP process that crucially comes into the game below\nthe HC scale: the HC baryon significantly couples to the standard-model Higgs\nvia the BS mechanism, and can non-thermally be produced from the thermal plasma\nbelow the HC scale, which turns out to allow the TeV mass scale for the\ncomposite baryonic DM, much smaller than the generic bound placed in the\nconventional thermal freeze-out scenario, to account for the observed relic\nabundance. Thus the DM can closely be related to the mechanism of the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking. \n\n"}

In particular, 85% of the cumulative SFHs are\nfitted to within a maximum error of 5% of the total stellar mass formed, and\n99% to within 10%. The log-normal performs systematically better than the\ncommonly used delayed-tau model, and is superseded only by functions with more\nthan three free parameters.

Such a suppression could be caused by some early-universe mechanism\n(e.g., broken scale invariance during inflation), leading to a modification of\nthe primordial power spectrum at the onset of the radiation-domination era.\nAlternatively, it may be due to nontrivial dark-matter properties (e.g., new\ndark-matter interactions or warm dark matter) that affect the matter power\nspectrum at late times, during radiation domination, after the perturbations\nre-enter the horizon. We show that early- and late-time suppression mechanisms\ncan be distinguished by measurement of the $\\mu$ distortion to the frequency\nspectrum of the cosmic microwave background.

To explain the\namplitude and the spatial range of galactic conformity two--halo terms or\nassembly bias become important.

Luminous red galaxies and galaxy clusters probe the\nmatter power spectrum on overlapping scales (0.02 Mpc$^{-1}$ < k < 0.7\nMpc$^{-1}$ [9-18]), while the Lyman-alpha forest reaches slightly smaller\nscales (0.3 Mpc$^{-1} < k < 3$ Mpc$^{-1}$; [19]). These observations indicate\nthat the primordial power spectrum is nearly scale-invariant with amplitude\nclose to $2 \\times 10^{-9}$, [5, 20-25]. They also strongly support Inflation\nand motivate us to obtain constraints reaching to smaller scales on the\nprimordial curvature power spectrum and by implication on Inflation.

Therefore, we can almost rule out\nPBH within their overlap scales with the UCMHs.

Taken at face value these constraints exclude multi-Solar mass PBHs\nmaking up all of the DM for both delta-function and extended mass functions.\nHowever the stellar microlensing event rate depends on the density and velocity\ndistribution of the compact objects along the line of sight to the Magellanic\nClouds.

It is thus difficult to use the information encoded in small\nscales to test cosmological models or probe subtle features of the galaxy-halo\nconnection. In this paper, we attempt to push halo modelling into the\n\"accurate\" regime with a fully numerical mock-based methodology and careful\ntreatment of statistical and systematic errors.

Developing the weak field\napproximation, we find that the here derived equation of motion corresponding\nto Newton's equation also contains a small outwards acceleration term. The new\nterm is particularly significant for very low density systems.\n  A modified virial theorem is derived and applied to clusters of galaxies. For\nthe Coma and Abell 2029 clusters, the dynamical masses are about a factor of 5\nto 10 smaller than in the standard case. This tends to let no room for dark\nmatter in these clusters. Then, the two-body problem is studied and an equation\ncorresponding to the Binet equation is obtained. The results are applied to the\nrotation curve of the outer layers of the Milky Way. Starting backwards from\nthe present rotation curve, we calculate the past evolution of the galactic\nrotation and find that, in the early stages, it was steep and Keplerian.

There is no evidence that the mean photometric and\nspectroscopic properties of SLSNe-I differ between low (z<1) and high redshift\n(z>1), but there is clear evidence of diversity in the spectrum at <2000A,\npossibly caused by the variations in temperature between events.

However, this\nmethod is limited by degeneracies between the density profile of dark matter\nand the stellar mass-to-light ratio. In this work we reduce this degeneracy by\ncombining weak lensing together with strong lensing and stellar kinematics. Our\nanalysis is based on two galaxy samples: 45 strong lenses from the SLACS survey\nand 1,700 massive quiescent galaxies from the SDSS main spectroscopic sample\nwith weak lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. We use a\nBayesian hierarchical approach to jointly model all three observables. We fit\nthe data with models of varying complexity and show that a model with a radial\ngradient in the stellar mass-to-light ratio is required to simultaneously\ndescribe both galaxy samples. This result is driven by a subset of strong\nlenses with very steep total density profile, that cannot be fitted by models\nwith no gradient. Our measurements are unable to determine whether $M_*/L$\ngradients are due to variations in stellar population parameters at fixed IMF,\nor to gradients in the IMF itself. The inclusion of $M_*/L$ gradients decreases\ndramatically the inferred IMF normalisation, compared to previous lensing-based\nstudies, with the exact value depending on the assumed dark matter profile. The\nmain effect of strong lensing selection is to shift the stellar mass\ndistribution towards the high mass end, while the halo mass and stellar IMF\ndistribution at fixed stellar mass are not significantly affected. \n\n"}

Despite our expectation that all neutron stars in the Universe obey the\nsame equation of state, i.e. the properties of the matter that forms them are\nuniversal, current tidal inference analyses treat the two bodies as\nindependent. We present a method to measure the effect of tidal interactions in\nthe gravitational wave signal -- and hence constrain the equation of state --\nthat assumes that the two binary components obey the same equation of state.\nOur method makes use of a relation between the tidal deformabilities of the two\nstars given the ratio of their masses, a relation that has been shown to only\nhave a weak dependance on the equation of state. We use this relation to link\nthe tidal deformabilities of the two stars in a realistic parameter inference\nstudy while simultaneously marginalizing over the error in the relation. This\napproach incorporates more physical information into our analysis, thus leading\nto a better measurement of tidal effects in gravitational wave signals.

Instead, the filtering mass,\nwhich corresponds directly to the scale over which baryonic perturbations are\nsmoothed in linear perturbation theory, provides a remarkably good fit to the\ncharacteristic mass scale. Thus, it appears that the effect of reionization on\nstructure formation in both the linear and nonlinear regimes is described by a\nsingle characteristic scale, the filtering scale of baryonic perturbations.

Under this assumption, the hydrostatic\nequilibrium uniquely fixes the two free parameters in the model, the\nmass-temperature normalization and the polytropic index, that determine the\ntemperature profile. This enables us to predict a universal gas profile from\nany universal dark matter profile. Our results show that gas tracing dark\nmatter in the outer parts of the haloes is inconsistent with gas being\nisothermal; on the contrary, it requires temperature to decrease slowly with\nradius, in agreement with observations. We compare our predictions for X-ray\nsurface brightness profiles of the haloes and the mass-temperature relation\nwith observations. We find that they are generally in a good agreement.

The rate of energy transfer into the low\ndensity IGM on a typical scale of 100 pc seems to be lower by 3-4 orders of\nmagnitude than the rate measured earlier for strong CIV metal absorption\nsystems.

Information obtained from such a measurement may provide new insights\nto the origin and evolution of angular momentum in hierarchical structure\nformation theory. For typical, well relaxed, clusters of mass a few times\n10$^{14}$ M$_{\\sun}$, the peak fluctuation is of the order a few $\\mu$K,\ndepending on the rotational velocity and the inclination angle of the\nrotational axis. For clusters which had underwent a recent merger, the\ncontribution to temperature fluctuations could be even larger. This dipole\nsignature is similar to the one produced by lensed CMB towards galaxy clusters,\nthough the lensing contribution spans a larger angular extent than the one due\nto rotational scattering as the former depends on the gradient of the cluster\npotential. Since the lensing contribution towards clusters are aligned with the\nlarge scale CMB gradient, when higher resolution observations towards clusters\nare combined with a wide field CMB map, these two effects can be separated.

Abstract: Using cosmological N-body simulations, we investigate the influence of the\nmatter density parameter Omega_m and the linear theory power spectrum P(k) on\nstatistical properties of the dark matter halo population -- the mass function\nn(M), the halo correlation function, and halo pairwise velocity statistics. For\nfixed P(k), the effect of changing Omega_m is simple: the halo mass scale M_*\nshifts in proportion to Omega_m, pairwise velocities (at fixed M/M_*) are\nproportional to Omega_m^{0.6}, and halo clustering at fixed M/M_* is unchanged.\nIf one simultaneously changes the P(k) amplitude sigma_8 to maintain a \"cluster\nnormalization\" condition sigma_8 x Omega_m^{0.5} = const, then n(M) stays\napproximately constant near M ~ 5e14 Msun, and halo clustering and pairwise\nvelocities are similar at fixed M. However, the shape of n(M) changes, with a\ndecrease of Omega_m from 0.3 to 0.2 producing a ~30% drop in the number of low\nmass halos. One can preserve the shape of n(M) over a large dynamic range by\nchanging the shape of P(k), but the required changes are substantial, and they\nsignificantly alter the halo clustering and halo velocities. The sensitivity of\nthe dark halo population to cosmological model parameters has encouraging\nimplications for efforts to constrain cosmology and galaxy bias with observed\ngalaxy clustering, since the predicted changes in the halo population cannot\neasily be masked by altering the way that galaxies occupy halos. A shift in\nOmega_m alone would be detected by any dynamically sensitive clustering\nstatistic; a cluster normalized change to sigma_8 and Omega_m would require a\nchange in galaxy occupation as a function of M/M_*, which would alter galaxy\nclustering; and a simultaneous change to P(k) that preserves the halo mass\nfunction would change the clustering of the halos themselves. \n\n"}

This is partly due to concerns about its need for helically\nforced turbulence, but mainly because simple \"textbook\" treatments are\nkinematic and linear.

We complement here the\n1999 Chalonge Lectures on out of equilibrium fields in self-consistent\ninflationary dynamics [astro-ph/0006446] investigating inflation driven by the\nevolution of highly excited quantum states. These states are characterized by a\nnon-perturbatively large number of quanta in a band of momenta and with zero or\nnonzero expectation value of the inflaton scalar field. They represent the\nsituation in which initially a non-perturbatively large energy density is\nlocalized in a band of high energy quantum modes and are coined tsunami-waves.\nThe self- consistent evolution of this quantum state and the scale factor is\nstudied analytically and numerically. It is shown that the time evolution of\nthese quantum states lead to two consecutive stages of inflation under\nconditions that are the quantum analogue of slow-roll. The evolution of the\nscale factor during the first stage has new features that are characteristic of\nthe quantum state. During this initial stage the quantum fluctuations in the\nhighly excited band build up an effective homogeneous condensate with a\nnon-perturbatively large amplitude as a consequence of the large number of\nquanta.The second stage of inflation is similar to the usual classical chaotic\nscenario but driven by this effective condensate.The excited quantum modes are\nsuperhorizon in the first stage and do not affect the power spectrum of scalar\nperturbations.Thus, this tsunami quantum state provides a field theoretical\njustification for chaotic scenarios driven by a classical homogeneous scalar\nfield of large amplitude. \n\n"}

In contrast,\nhalos in the hierarchical structure formation scenarios grow via multiple\nviolent mergers and accretion along filaments, and particle orbits in the halos\nare highly eccentric. We study the effects of the cooling of gas in the inner\nregions of halos using high-resolution cosmological simulations which include\ngas dynamics, radiative cooling, and star formation.

When the source is near a cusp\nin a smooth lens' caustic the sum of the magnifications of the three closest\nimages should be close to zero.

Less massive galaxies tend\nto be ungrouped blue star-forming discs, while more massive galaxies are\ntypically grouped red old-star spheroids. Colour-magnitude data show a gap\nbetween the red and blue sequences, extremely red luminous galaxies already at\nz~1, a truncation of today's blue sequence above L_*, and massive starbursts at\nz~2-4. We propose that these features are driven by the thermal properties of\nthe inflowing gas and their interplay with the clustering and feedback\nprocesses, all functions of the dark-matter halo mass and associated with a\nsimilar characteristic scale. In haloes below a critical shock-heating mass\nM_shock~10^{12}Msun, discs are built by cold streams, not heated by a virial\nshock, yielding efficient early star formation. It is regulated by supernova\nfeedback into a long sequence of bursts in blue galaxies constrained to a\n\"fundamental line\". Cold streams penetrating through hot media in M>M_shock\nhaloes preferentially at z>2 lead to massive starbursts in L>L_* galaxies. At\nz<2, in M>M_shock haloes hosting groups, the gas is heated by a virial shock,\nand being dilute it becomes vulnerable to feedback from energetic sources such\nas AGNs. This shuts off gas supply and prevents further star formation, leading\nby passive evolution to \"red-and-dead\" massive spheroids starting at z~1. A\nminimum in feedback efficiency near M_shock explains the observed minimum in\nM/L and the qualitative features of the star-formation history. The cold flows\nprovide a hint for solving the angular-momentum problem. When these processes\nare incorporated in simulations they recover the main bi-modality features and\nsolve other open puzzles. \n\n"}

When fitted with a Gaussian emission\nline,the feature has an equivalent width of 40-100eV and full-width at half\nmaximum of greater than 20,000 km/s, however the exact properties of this weak\nline are highly dependent upon the chosen continuum model. The width of the\nline suggests an origin in the inner accretion disk, which is, however,\ninconsistent with the lack of Compton reflection. We find that much of the\nbroad residual emission can be attributed to continuum curvature. The data are\nconsistent with a model in which the primary powerlaw continuum is reprocessed\nby an accretion disk which is truncated as small radii. Alternatively, the\nprimary source could be partially covered by a dense absorber. The latter model\nis less attractive than the former because of the small inclination angle of\nthe jet of 3C 111 to the line of sight.

To inspect this issue, we compare the black hole\n(BH) mass, the bulge luminosity and the far infrared luminosity among type I\nULIRGs, QSOs and elliptical galaxies. As a result, we find the following\nresults; (1) The type I ULIRGs have systematically smaller BH masses in spite\nof the comparable bulge luminosity relative to QSOs and elliptical galaxies.\n(2) The far-infrared luminosity of most type I ULIRGs is larger than the\nEddington luminosity. We show that above results do not change significantly\nfor 3 type I ULIRGs that we can estimate the visual extinction from the column\ndensity.

Relativistically beamed inverse Compton and `non-standard'\nsynchrotron models have been considered to account for such excess X-ray\nemission in other jets; both models are applicable to this high-redshift\nexample but with differing requirements for the underlying jet physical\nproperties, such as velocity, energetics, and electron acceleration processes.\nOne potentially very important distinguishing characteristic between the two\nmodels is their strongly diverging predictions for the X-ray/radio emission\nwith increasing redshift. This is considered, though with the limited sample of\nthree z>3 jets it is apparent that future studies targeted at very\nhigh-redshift jets are required for further elucidation of this issue.

In particular, we find that if the\nmagnetic field is aligned with the rotation axis of the molecular cloud core,\nthe effects of the magnetic field on fragmentation and disc structure are\nalmost entirely due to magnetic pressure, while if the rotation axis is\ninitially perpendicular to the magnetic field, magnetic tension plays a greater\nrole and can actually aid fragmentation.

Most\nemission lines are spectrally resolved, yet all have dispersions sigma<100km/s.\nFive of the 24 sample members have OII doublet line flux ratios which imply gas\ndensities in excess of 100 cm^-3. The line emission in these galaxies may be\ndominated by an active nucleus and the galaxies have been eliminated from the\nsubsequent analysis. The remaining 19 linewidths are too large by a factor of\ntwo (7sigma significance) to be attributed to turbulent motions within an\nindividual star forming region, and therefore most likely reflect the orbital\nmotion of ionized gas in the galaxy. We use Fabry--Perot observations of nearby\ngalaxies to construct simulated datasets that mimic our observational setup at\nz=0.25; these allow us to compute the expected distribution of (observable)\nlinewidths sigma_v for a galaxy of a given ``true'' (optical) rotation speed\nv_c. These simulations include the effects of random viewing angles, clumpy\nline emission, finite fibre aperture, and internal dust extinction on the\nemission line profile.

We investigate methods of achieving the\nobserved variability using symmetry. Since our model emphasizes geometric and\nstatistical considerations, rather than the detailed physics of the shell, it\nis applicable to any theory that relies on relativistic shells.

Second, the \"peaks\" in a time history can be ascribed to Poisson\nvariations in the actual number of entities contributing to the signal at any\ngiven time.

The code, named COSMOS, possesses several\nnew features which distinguish it from other PM-PPM codes. In particular, to\nsolve the Poisson equation we have written a new multigrid solver which can\ndetermine the gravitational potential of isolated matter distributions and\nwhich properly takes into account the finite-volume discretization required by\nPPM. All components of the code are constructed to work with a nonuniform mesh,\npreserving second-order spatial differences. The PPM code uses vacuum boundary\nconditions for isolated problems, preventing inflows when appropriate. The PM\ncode uses a second-order variable-timestep time integration scheme.

However, there are many\npossibilities which must be excluded before such a bound can be established.\nThere is an obvious degeneracy between the neutrino lifetime and the mixing\nparameters.

Many of the most exotic possibilities that\npresently complicate the extraction of a decay bound will be removed if the\nKamLAND reactor antineutrino experiment confirms the large-mixing angle\nsolution to the solar neutrino problem and measures the mixing parameters\nprecisely.

Abstract: It is of great interest whether the recent KamLAND bound on the flux of\nelectron antineutrinos from the Sun constrains the electromagnetic properties\nof the neutrino. We examine the efficiency of the electron antineutrino\nproduction in the solar magnetic fields, assuming the neutrinos are Majorana\nparticles with a relatively large transition moment. We consider fields both in\nthe radiative and convective zones of the Sun, with physically plausible\nstrengths, and take into account the recently established values of the\noscillation parameters. Our analysis shows that the production rate in question\nis presently unobservable. In the radiative zone, it is suppressed by the large\nmeasured value of the flavor mixing angle which eliminates the resonant level\ncrossing. A corresponding general resonance condition, valid for large as well\nas small values of the mixing angle, is derived. Likewise, in the convective\nzone, the strength of the small-scale magnetic field is likely insufficient.\nThus, no useful bound on the neutrino transition moment can be derived from the\npublished KamLAND bound.
