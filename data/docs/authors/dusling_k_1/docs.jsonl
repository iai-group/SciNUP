We discuss physical and formal aspects of this\napproach. In particular, we show that initial azimuthally asymmetric transverse\nflow develops for non-central collisions as a consequence of the sudden\nequilibration. Moreover, the energy-momentum tensor from the free-streaming\nstage matches very smoothly to the form used in the transverse hydrodynamics,\nwhereas matching to isotropic hydrodynamics requires a more pronounced change\nin the energy-momentum tensor. After the hydrodynamic phase statistical\nhadronization is carried out with the help of THERMINATOR.

One class of these\ncontributes to the energy evolution of multi-parton correlators in the nuclear\nwavefunctions. Another dominant class of unstable quantum fluctuations grow\nrapidly with proper time $\\tau$ after the collision.

The all-order result\ncan be expressed in terms of the spectrum of fluctuations on the initial proper\ntime surface.

Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light\nneutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses.

This anisotropy is characterized via a Fourier expansion of the\ndistribution of charged particles in azimuthal angle (phi), with the\ncoefficients v_n denoting the magnitude of the anisotropy. Significant v_2-v_6\nvalues are obtained as a function of transverse momentum (0.5<pT<20 GeV),\npseudorapidity (|eta|<2.5) and centrality using an event plane method. The v_n\nvalues for n>=3 are found to vary weakly with both eta and centrality, and\ntheir pT dependencies are found to follow an approximate scaling relation,\nv_n^{1/n}(pT) \\propto v_2^{1/2}(pT).

In this picture, the\nhard initial scatterings result in mainly longitudinal flux tubes, with\ntransversely moving pieces carrying the $p_{t}$ of the partons from hard\nscatterings. These flux tubes constitute eventually both bulk matter (which\nthermalizes and flows) and jets. We introduce a criterion based on parton\nenergy loss to decide whether a given string segment contributes to the bulk or\nleaves the matter to end up as a jet of hadrons. Essentially low $p_{t}$\nsegments from inside the volume will constitute the bulk, high $p_{t}$ segments\n(or segments very close to the surface) contribute to the jets. The latter ones\nappear after the usual flux tube breaking via q-qbar production (Schwinger\nmechanism). Interesting is the transition region: Intermediate $p_{t}$ segments\nproduced inside the matter close to the surface but having enough energy to\nescape, are supposed to pick up q-qbar pairs from the thermal matter rather\nthan creating them via the Schwinger mechanism.

We calculate the two-gluon production cross section while\nincluding all-order saturation effects in the heavy nucleus with the\nlowest-order rescattering in the lighter nucleus. We find four types of\ncorrelations in the two-gluon production cross section: (i) geometric\ncorrelations, (ii) HBT correlations accompanied by a back-to-back maximum,\n(iii) away-side correlations, and (iv) near-side azimuthal correlations which\nare long-range in rapidity. The geometric correlations (i) are due to the fact\nthat nucleons are correlated by simply being confined within the same nucleus\nand may lead to long-range rapidity correlations for the produced particles\nwithout strong azimuthal angle dependence. Somewhat surprisingly, long-range\nrapidity correlations (iii) and (iv) have exactly the same amplitudes along\nwith azimuthal and rapidity shapes: one centered around \\Delta \\phi =\\pi\\ with\nthe other one centered around \\Delta \\phi =0 (here \\Delta \\phi\\ is the\nazimuthal angle between the two produced gluons).

Abstract: We investigate the applicability of fluid dynamics in ultrarelativistic heavy\nion (AA) collisions and high multiplicity proton nucleus (pA) collisions. In\norder for fluid dynamics to be applicable the microscopic and macroscopic\ndistance/time scales of the system have to be sufficiently separated. The\ndegree of separation is quantified by the ratio between these scales, usually\nreferred to as the Knudsen number. In this work, we calculate the Knudsen\nnumbers reached in fluid dynamical simulations of AA and pA collisions at RHIC\nand LHC energies. For this purpose, we consider different choices of shear\nviscosity parametrizations, initial states and initialization times. We then\nestimate the values of shear viscosity for which the fluid dynamical\ndescription of ultrarelativistic AA and pA collisions breaks down. In\nparticular, we study how such values depend on the centrality, in the case of\nAA collision, and multiplicity, in the case of pA collision.

The second puzzle is that the\nsevere suppression of lepton-flavor-violating processes involving electrons,\ne.g. mu->3e, tau->e mu mu, etc., implies that generic new-physics contributions\nto lepton interactions cannot exist below O(10 - 100 TeV), whereas the 3.6sigma\ndeviation of the muon g-2 from the standard model can be explained by a\nnew-physics scale < O(1 TeV).

We consider the possibility of a gauged lepton-flavor\ninteraction that couples at tree level only to mu- and tau-flavored leptons and\nthe dark sector. Dark matter thus interacts appreciably only with particles of\nmu and tau flavor at tree level and has loop-suppressed couplings to quarks and\nelectrons.

It turns out that in the lowest Landau\nlevel, where only one spin direction is allowed, the spectrum consists of one\npositively (negatively) charged fermionic mode with positive (negative) spin.\nIn contrast, in higher Landau levels, as an indirect consequence of the double\nspin degeneracy of fermions, the spectrum consists of two massless collective\nmodes with left- and right-chiralities. The mechanism through which these new\ncollective excitations are created in a uniform magnetic field is similar to\nthe production mechanism of dynamical holes (plasminos) at finite temperature\nand zero magnetic fields. Whereas cold magnetized plasminos appear for moderate\nmagnetic fields and for all positive momenta of propagating fermions, hot\nmagnetized plasminos appear only in the limit of weak magnetic fields and soft\nmomenta. \n\n"}

The interaction between strings is realized in the accordance with the\nstring fusion model prescriptions by the introduction of the lattice in the\nimpact parameter plane and taking into account the finite rapidity length of\nstrings. The particles species differentiation is implemented according to\nSchwinger mechanism. The parameters of the model are fixed with the\nexperimental data on total inelastic cross section and charged multiplicity.

The TDHF theory is the lowest level of approximation\nof a range of methods to solve the quantum many-body problem, showing its\nuniversality to describe many-fermion dynamics at the mean-field level.

As a result, white\ndwarfs and neutron stars offer unique cosmic laboratories for studying matter\nat very high densities.

Arbitrary specifications of the initial quantum state (pure or\nmixed) results in initial time singularities which are not removed by the usual\nrenormalization counterterms. We study the initial time singularities in the\nlinearized equation of motion for the scalar condensate in a renormalizable\nYukawa theory in 3+1 dimensions. In this renormalizable theory the initial time\nsingularities are enhanced. We present a consistent method for removing these\ninitial time singularities by specifying initial states where the distribution\nof high energy quanta is determined by the initial conditions and the\ninteraction effects. This is done through a Bogoliubov transformation which is\nconsistently obtained in a perturbative expansion.The usual renormalization\ncounterterms and the proper choice of the Bogoliubov coefficients lead to a\nsingularity free evolution equation.
