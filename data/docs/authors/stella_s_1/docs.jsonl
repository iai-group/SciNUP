The main result\nis a complete description of the characteristic polynomial (both eigenvalues\nand their multiplicities) for the action of the operator $\\Psi_n$ on each\nhomogeneous component of $H$.

Here Xcan is the complement of an anticanonical\ndivisor in a Langlands dual quadric. The superpotential W is a regular function\non Xcan and is written in terms of coordinates which are naturally identified\nwith a cohomology basis of the original quadric. This superpotential is shown\nto extend the earlier Landau-Ginzburg model of Givental, and to be isomorphic\nto the Lie-theoretic mirror introduced by Rietsch.

We show that over finite\ndimensional algebras, representations with finitely many orbits, or finitely\nmany invariant subspaces, or distributive coincide, and further coincide with\nthin modules in the acyclic case. Incidence algebras produce examples of such\nmodules, and we show that algebras which are locally hereditary, and whose\nprojective are distributive, or equivalently, which have finitely many ideals,\nare precisely the deformations of incidence algebras, and they are the finite\ndimensional algebra analogue of Pr${\\rm \\ddot{u}}$fer rings. New\ncharacterizations of incidence algebras are obtained, such as they are exactly\nalgebras which have a faithful thin module. A main consequence is that \"every\nthin module comes from an incidence algebra\": if $V$ is either a thin module\nover a finite dimensional algebra $A$, or $V$ is distributive and $A$ is\nacyclic, then $A/{\\rm ann}(V)$ is an incidence algebra and $V$ can be presented\nas its defining representation.

One wide-open problem\nin this area is to determine when a given code can be algorithmically drawn in\nthe plane as a Venn diagram-like figure. A sufficient condition to do so is for\nthe code to have a property called $k$-inductively pierced. Gross, Obatake, and\nYoungs recently used toric algebra to show that a code on three neurons is\n$1$-inductively pierced if and only if the toric ideal is trivial or generated\nby quadratics. No result is known for additional neurons in the same\ngenerality, part of the difficulty coming from the large number of codewords\npossible when additional neurons are used.\n  In this article, we study two infinite classes of combinatorial neural codes\nin detail. For each code, we explicitly compute its universal Gr\\\"obner basis.\nThis is done for the first class by recognizing that the codewords form a\nLawrence-type matrix. With the second class, this is done by showing that the\nmatrix is totally unimodular. These computations allow one to compute the state\npolytopes of the corresponding toric ideals, from which all distinct initial\nideals may be computed efficiently.

{"id": "1812.08128", "contents": "Title: Exposed circuits, linear quotients, and chordal clutters Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be chordal if it has no induced cycles of length four\nor more. In a recent preprint Culbertson, Guralnik, and Stiller give a new\ncharacterization of chordal graphs in terms of sequences of what they call\n`edge-erasures'. We show that these moves are in fact equivalent to a linear\nquotient ordering on $I_{\\overline{G}}$, the edge ideal of the complement\ngraph. Known results imply that $I_{\\overline G}$ has linear quotients if and\nonly if $G$ is chordal, and hence this recovers an algebraic proof of their\ncharacterization. We investigate higher-dimensional analogues of this result,\nand show that in fact linear quotients for more general circuit ideals of\n$d$-clutters can be characterized in terms of removing exposed circuits in the\ncomplement clutter. Restricting to properly exposed circuits can be\ncharacterized by a homological condition. This leads to a notion of higher\ndimensional chordal clutters which borrows from commutative algebra and simple\nhomotopy theory. The interpretation of linear quotients in terms of\nshellability of simplicial complexes also has applications to a conjecture of\nSimon regarding the extendable shellability of $k$-skeleta of simplices.

Using it and other fundamental combinatorial problems, we\nintroduce a version of the K\\\"ahler package beyond positivity, allowing us to\nprove the hard Lefschetz theorem for toric varieties (and beyond) even when the\nample cone is empty. A particular focus lies on replacing the Hodge-Riemann\nrelations by a non-degeneracy relation at torus-invariant subspaces, allowing\nus to state and prove a generalization of theorems of Hall and Laman in the\nsetting of toric varieties and, more generally, the face rings of Hochster,\nReisner and Stanley. This has several applications:\n  - We fully characterize the possible face numbers of simplicial rational\nhomology spheres, resolving the $g$-conjecture of McMullen in full generality\nand generalizing Stanley's earlier proof for simplicial polytopes. The same\nmethods also verify a conjecture of K\\\"uhnel: if $M$ is a triangulated closed\n$(d-1)$-manifold on $n$ vertices, then \\[\\binom{d+1}{j}\\mathrm{b}_{j-1}(M)\\ \\le\n\\ \\binom{n-d+j-2}{j}\\ \\quad \\text{for}\\ 1\\le j\\le \\frac{d}{2}.\\]\n  - We prove that for a simplicial complex that embeds into $\\mathbb{R}^{2d}$,\nthe number of $d$-dimensional simplices exceeds the number of\n$(d-1)$-dimensional simplices by a factor of at most $d+2$.

In arXiv:math.AG/0409053 we associated to C and C-du by a Tannaka\nreconstruction a monoid M with a coordinate ring F[M] of matrix coefficients,\nas well as a Lie algebra Lie(M). We interpreted this situation algebraic\ngeometrically.\n  In particular, we showed: If the Lie algebra g is generated by one-parameter\nelements, then it identifies in a natural way with a subalgebra of Lie(M), and\nthere exists a subgroup of the unit group of M, which is dense in M. We now\nintroduce the coordinate ring of regular functions on this dense subgroup, as\nwell as the algebra of linear regular functions on the universal enveloping\nalgebra of g, and investigate their relation. We investigate and describe\nvarious coordinate rings of matrix coefficients associated to categories of\nintegrable representations of g. We specialize to integrable representations of\nKac-Moody algebras and free Lie algebras. Some results on coordinate rings of\nKac-Moody groups obtained by V. G. Kac and D. Peterson, some coordinate rings\nof the associated groups of linear algebraic integrable Lie algebras defined by\nV. G. Kac, and some results on coordinate rings of free Kac-Moody groups\nobtained by Y. Billig and A.

Write Bun_G and Bun_H for the stacks of G-torsors and H-torsors on X.\nThe theta-kernel on Bun_G\\times Bun_H yields the theta-lifting functors between\nthe derived categories of l-adic sheaves on Bun_G and Bun_H. We describe the\nrelation of these functors with Hecke operators.\n  In two particular cases it becomes the geometric Langlands functoriality for\nthis pair (in the nonramified case). Namely, for n=m the functor from the\nderived category on Bun_H to that on Bun_G commutes with Hecke functors with\nrespect to the inclusion of the Langlands dual groups SO_{2n}\\to SO_{2n+1}.
