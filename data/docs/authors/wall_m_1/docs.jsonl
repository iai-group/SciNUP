We study these\nmodels under an assumption, akin to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, in\nwhich the volatility has already relaxed to its equilibrium distribution and\nacts as a background to the evolution of the price process. In this\napproximation, we show that all models of stochastic volatility should exhibit\na scaling relation in the time lag of zero-drift modified log-returns. We\nverify that the Dow-Jones Industrial Average index indeed follows this scaling.\nWe then focus on two popular stochastic volatility models, the Heston and\nHull-White models.

We study systematically the\neffects of pairing fluctuations and address all filling fractions over the\nentire range of attractive interaction strength. While the attractive Hubbard\nmodel can be regarded as the generalization of BCS to Bose Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) crossover to a lattice, we find that the BEC limit of this\nHubbard model is very different from that of jellium, owing to the strong\ninter-site repulsion between pairs, which becomes important near half filling\nwhen the on-site attraction is strong. A central conclusion of our work is that\nin a lattice, around half filling, the smooth evolution from the BCS to the BEC\nlimits is interrupted. For the attractive Hubbard model, $T_c$ vanishes when\nthe system approaches the bosonic regime with increasing interaction strength.\nWe suggest that the vanishing of $T_c$ at strong coupling strength may signal a\nquantum critical transition to another form of superfluid not continuously\nconnected to a BCS-like phase.

An ultracold\nmolecular gas, with a temperature below 1 uK, provides a highly unusual regime\nfor chemistry, where polar molecules can easily be oriented using an external\nelectric field and where, moreover, the motion of two colliding molecules is\nstrictly quantized. Recently, atom-exchange reactions were observed in a\ntrapped ultracold gas of KRb molecules. In an external electric field, these\nexothermic and barrierless bimolecular reactions, KRb+KRb -> K2+Rb2, occur at a\nrate that rises steeply with increasing dipole moment. Here we show that the\nquantum stereodynamics of the ultracold collisions can be exploited to suppress\nthe bimolecular chemical reaction rate by nearly two orders of magnitude. We\nuse an optical lattice trap to confine the fermionic polar molecules in a\nquasi-two-dimensional, pancake-like geometry, with the dipoles oriented along\nthe tight confinement direction. With the combination of sufficiently tight\nconfinement and Fermi statistics of the molecules, two polar molecules can\napproach each other only in a \"side-by-side\" collision, where the chemical\nreaction rate is suppressed by the repulsive dipole-dipole interaction. We show\nthat the suppression of the bimolecular reaction rate requires quantum-state\ncontrol of both the internal and external degrees of freedom of the molecules.\nThe suppression of chemical reactions for polar molecules in a\nquasi-two-dimensional trap opens the way for investigation of a dipolar\nmolecular quantum gas. Because of the strong, long-range character of the\ndipole-dipole interactions, such a gas brings fundamentally new abilities to\nquantum-gas-based studies of strongly correlated many-body physics, where\nquantum phase transitions and new states of matter can emerge. \n\n"}

In this chapter we review a number\nof universal equations which describe various regimes of the dynamics of\nexciton-polariton condensates: the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which models\nweakly interacting equilibrium condensates, the complex Ginsburg-Landau\nequation---the universal equation that describes the behaviour of systems in\nthe vicinity of a symmetry--breaking instability, and the complex\nSwift-Hohenberg equation that in comparison with the complex Ginsburg-Landau\nequation contains additional nonlocal terms responsible for spacial mode\nselection. All these equations can be derived asymptotically from a generic\nlaser model given by Maxwell-Bloch equations. Such an universal framework\nallows the unified treatment of various systems and continuously cross from one\nsystem to another. We discuss the relevance of these equations, and their\nconsequences for pattern formation. \n\n"}

Ultracold quantum gases offer tremendous promise for this\napplication largely due to an unprecedented control over interactions.\nSpecifically, $a$, the two-body scattering length that characterizes the\ninteraction strength, can be tuned to any value. This offers prospects for\nexperimental access to regimes where the behavior is not well understood\nbecause interactions are strong, atom-atom correlations are important,\nmean-field theory is inadequate, and equilibrium may not be reached or perhaps\ndoes not even exist.

Out of equilibrium, an important outstanding problem is the\nefficient numerical simulation of the dynamics of these systems. In this work\nwe develop a new semiclassical phase-space approach (a.k.a. the truncated\nWigner approximation) for simulating the dynamics of interacting fermions in\narbitrary dimensions.

Therefore it is necessary to find strategies for\npreparing long-lived many-body states in Floquet systems.

When such excitations are present,\nthe system retains memory of initial correlations up to infinite times, thus\nevading decoherence. We demonstrate this connection in the context of the\nLuttinger model, the simplest quantum hydrodynamic model, and in the quantum\nKdV equation. In the standard Luttinger model, memory of all initial\ncorrelations is preserved throughout the time evolution up to infinitely large\ntimes, as a result of the purely ballistic dynamics.

A fundamental limit in nearly all applications based\non such systems arises from spontaneous emission, in which photons are absorbed\nby atoms and then re-scattered into undesired channels. In typical treatments\nof atomic ensembles, it is assumed that this re-scattering occurs\nindependently, and at a rate given by a single isolated atom, which in turn\ngives rise to standard limits of fidelity in applications such as quantum\nmemories or quantum gates. However, this assumption can be violated. In\nparticular, spontaneous emission of a collective atomic excitation can be\nsignificantly suppressed through strong interference in emission. Thus far the\nphysics underlying the phenomenon of subradiance and techniques to exploit it\nhave not been well-understood. In this work, we provide a comprehensive\ntreatment of this problem. First, we show that in ordered atomic arrays in free\nspace, subradiant states acquire an interpretation in terms of optical modes\nthat are guided by the array, which only emit due to scattering from the ends\nof the finite chain. We also elucidate the properties of subradiant states in\nthe many-excitation limit. Finally, we introduce the new concept of selective\nradiance.

However, till now the scope of GF2 applications was\nquite limited as they require computer resources which rise steeply with system\nsize. In each step of the self-consistent GF2 calculation there are two parts:\nthe estimation of the self-energy from the previous step's Green's function,\nand updating the Green's function from the self-energy.

We study a single hole described by the t-Jz\nmodel with Ising interactions between the spins in 2D. This situation can be\nexperimentally realized in quantum gas microscopes. When the hole hopping is\nmuch larger than couplings between the spins, we find strong evidence that\nmagnetic polarons can be understood as bound states of two partons, a spinon\nand a holon carrying spin and charge quantum numbers respectively. We introduce\na microscopic parton description which is benchmarked by comparison with\nresults from advanced numerical simulations. Using this parton theory, we\npredict a series of excited states that are invisible in the spectral function\nand correspond to rotational excitations of the spinon-holon pair. This is\nreminiscent of mesonic resonances observed in high-energy physics, which can be\nunderstood as rotating quark antiquark pairs. We also apply the strong coupling\nparton theory to study far-from equilibrium dynamics of magnetic polarons\nobservable in current experiments with ultracold atoms.

We show that localization of large extended objects can be mapped\nto a lower-dimensional many-body localization problem. For example, motion of a\nstring involves propagation of point-like signals down its length to keep the\ndifferent segments in causal contact. For sufficiently strong disorder, all\nsuch internal modes will exhibit many-body localization, resulting in the\nlocalization of the entire string.

Here, we show that quantum localization-by constraining\nthe time evolution through quantum interference-strongly bounds these errors\nfor local observables. Consequently, for generic quantum many-body\nHamiltonians, Trotter errors can become independent of system size and total\nsimulation time. For local observables, DQS is thus intrinsically much more\nrobust than what one might expect from known error bounds on the global\nmany-body wave function.

By\nproper engineering of the reservoirs and their couplings to a system, one may\ndrive the system towards desired quantum-correlated steady states, even in the\nabsence of internal Hamiltonian dynamics. An intriguing category of equilibrium\nmany-particle phases are those which are distinguished by topology rather than\nby symmetry. A natural question thus arises: which of these topological states\ncan be achieved as the result of dissipative Lindblad-type (Markovian)\nevolution? Beside its fundamental importance, it may offer novel routes to the\nrealization of topologically-nontrivial states in quantum simulators,\nespecially ultracold atomic gases. Here I give a general answer for Gaussian\nstates and quadratic Lindblad evolution, mostly concentrating on the example of\n2D Chern insulator states. I prove a no-go theorem stating that a finite-range\nLindbladian cannot induce finite-rate exponential decay towards a unique\ntopological pure state above 1D. I construct a recipe for creating such state\nby exponentially-local dynamics, or a mixed state arbitrarily close to the\ndesired pure one via finite-range dynamics. I also address the cold-atom\nrealization, classification, and detection of these states. Extensions to other\ntypes of topological insulators and superconductors are also discussed. \n\n"}

First, we define the variational class of Computational Graph\nStates (CGS) which gives a uniform framework for describing all computable\nvariational ansatz. Secondly, we develop a novel optimization scheme,\nsupervised wave-function optimization (SWO), which systematically improves the\noptimized wave-function by drawing on ideas from supervised learning. While SWO\ncan be used independently of CGS, utilizing them together provides a flexible\nframework for the rapid design, prototyping and optimization of variational\nwave-functions.

At finite $T$, non-condensed fermion pairs must be included, although\nthey have been generally ignored in the literature. Within this BEC regime we\ncompute the equations of state for the one and two channel models; these two\ncases correspond to whether Feshbach resonance effects are omitted or included.\nDifferences between these two cases can be traced to differences between the\nnature of a Cooper pair and bosonic condensate.
