In this series of paper we propose improvements of\nboth technical and conceptual aspects of excursion set theory, and we explore\nup to which point the method can reproduce quantitatively the data from N-body\nsimulations. In paper I of the series we show how to derive excursion set\ntheory from a path integral formulation. This allows us both to derive\nrigorously the absorbing barrier boundary condition, that in the usual\nformulation is just postulated, and to deal analytically with the non-markovian\nnature of the random walk. Such a non-markovian dynamics inevitably enters when\neither the density is smoothed with filters such as the top-hat filter in\ncoordinate space (which is the only filter associated to a well defined halo\nmass) or when one considers non-Gaussian fluctuations. In these cases, beside\n``markovian'' terms, we find ``memory'' terms that reflect the non-markovianity\nof the evolution with the smoothing scale. We develop a general formalism for\nevaluating perturbatively these non-markovian corrections, and in this paper we\nperform explicitly the computation of the halo mass function for gaussian\nfluctuations, to first order in the non-markovian corrections due to the use of\na tophat filter in coordinate space. \n\n"}

As a\nreference model, we consider an anti-Copernican inhomogeneous model that\nconsists of two inner negatively curved underdense regions and an outer flat\nEinstein-de Sitter region. We assume that these regions are connected by two\nthin-walls at redshifts z = 0.067 and z=0.45. In the inner two regions, the\nfirst-order ISW effect is dominant and comparable to that in the concordant\nflat-Lambda models. In the outer Einstein-de Sitter region, the first-order ISW\neffect vanishes but the second-order ISW effect plays a dominant role, while\nthe first-order ISW effect is dominant in the flat-Lambda models at moderate\nredshifts. This difference can discrimate the anti-Copernican models from the\nconcordant flat-Lambda model. At high redshits, the second-order ISW effect is\ndominant both in our inhomogeneous model and the concordant model. In the outer\nregion, moreover, the ISW effect due to large-scale density perturbations with\na present matter density contrast much less than 0.37 is negligible, while the\neffect due to small-scale density perturbations (such as clusters of galaxies,\nsuperclusters and voids) with matter density contrast much larger than 0.37\nwould generate anisotropies which are larger than those generated by the ISW\neffect in the concordant model. \n\n"}

Our calculations show that the highest mass black holes observed\nin the Galaxy M_bh = 15 Msun in the high metallicity environment (Z=Zsun=0.02)\ncan be explained with stellar models and the wind mass loss rates adopted here.\nTo reach this result we had to set Luminous Blue Variable mass loss rates at\nthe level of about 0.0001 Msun/yr and to employ metallicity dependent\nWolf-Rayet winds. With such winds, calibrated on Galactic black hole mass\nmeasurements, the maximum black hole mass obtained for moderate metallicity\n(Z=0.3 Zsun=0.006) is M_bh,max = 30 Msun. This is a rather striking finding as\nthe mass of the most massive known stellar black hole is M_bh = 23-34 Msun and,\nin fact, it is located in a small star forming galaxy with moderate\nmetallicity.

This\neffect is not negligible in acceptable and accessible regions of parameter\nspace. Enhancements in the predicted high-energy neutrino flux from the Sun of\ntens to hundreds of percent can be realized in broad regions of parameter\nspace. Enhancements as large as factors of several hundred may be realized in\nextreme regions of the viable parameter space. Large enhancements require the\ndark matter annihilation cross section to be relatively small, sigma*v <~\n10^-27 cm^3/s. This phenomenology is interesting.

The spectra of several of\nthese gravitational wave backgrounds on subhorizon scales have been extensively\nstudied in the literature. In this paper we analyze the shape and amplitude of\nthe gravitational wave spectrum on scales which are superhorizon at the time of\nproduction. Such gravitational waves are expected from the self ordering of\nrandomly oriented scalar fields which can be present during a thermal phase\ntransition or during preheating after hybrid inflation. We find that, if the\ngravitational wave source acts only during a small fraction of the Hubble time,\nthe gravitational wave spectrum at frequencies lower than the expansion rate at\nthe time of production behaves as $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(f) \\propto f^3$ with an\namplitude much too small to be observable by gravitational wave observatories\nlike LIGO, LISA or BBO. On the other hand, if the source is active for a much\nlonger time, until a given mode which is initially superhorizon ($k\\eta_* \\ll\n1$), enters the horizon, for $k\\eta \\gtrsim 1$, we find that the gravitational\nwave energy density is frequency independent, i.e. scale invariant.

In order to set up a\nstraw-man ultra-compact object with no event horizon, but which is otherwise\nalmost identical to a black hole, we consider a nonrotating thin-shell model\ninspired by Mazur and Mottola's gravastar, which has a Schwarzschild exterior,\na de Sitter interior and an infinitely thin shell with finite tension\nseparating the two regions.

In this paper I review our current\nunderstanding of these topics. I begin by considering whether AGN and BHBs show\nthe same X-ray spectral-timing `states' (e.g. low-flux, hard-spectrum or `hard'\nand high-flux, soft-spectrum or `soft'). Observational selection effects mean\nthat most of the AGN which we have monitored will probably be `soft state'\nobjects, but AGN are found in the other BHB states, although possibly with\ndifferent critical transition accretion rates. I examine timescale scaling\nrelationships between AGN and BHBs.

The relationship T_B proportional to M_BH/mdot_E is a good fit, implying\nthat no other potential variable, e.g. black hole spin, varies significantly.\nLags between hard and soft X-ray bands as a function of Fourier timescale\nfollow similar patterns in AGN and BHBs.

This process represents a path alternative to thermonuclear\ndisruption of accreting white dwarfs in Type Ia supernovae.

In combination with\nour previous work, totaling 40 Seyfert-1 galaxies, the covered range in BH mass\nis substantially increased, allowing us to determine for the first time\nintrinsic scatter and correct evolutionary trends for selection effects. We\nre-analyze archival HST images of 19 local reverberation-mapped active galaxies\nto match the procedure adopted at intermediate redshift. Correcting spheroid\nluminosity for passive luminosity evolution and taking into account selection\neffects, we determine that at fixed present-day V-band spheroid luminosity,\nM_BH/L_sph \\propto (1+z)^(2.8+/-1.2). When including a sample of 44 quasars out\nto z=4.5 taken from the literature, with luminosity and BH mass corrected to a\nself-consistent calibration, we extend the BH mass range to over two orders of\nmagnitude, resulting in M_BH/L_sph \\propto (1+z)^(1.4+/-0.2).

If one wants to take care of backreaction effects, then a\ntheory of quantum gravity is needed.

Hence, it is a priori a puzzle how a background dependent\nQFT on CS should emerge as a semiclassical limit out of a background\nindependent quantum gravity theory. In this article we point out that the\nBorn-Oppenheimer decomposition (BOD) of the Hilbert space is ideally suited in\norder to establish such a link, provided that the Hilbert space representation\nof the gravitational field algebra satisfies an important condition.

The\nrelation between the main features of the distribution of the delay times (DTD)\nand the masses of the progenitors is illustrated for the single (SD) and double\ndegenerate (DD) models. Mixed models, which assume contributions from both the\nSD and DD channels, are also presented and tested versus the observed\ncorrelations between the SN Ia rates and the parent galaxy properties. It is\nshown that these correlations can be accounted for with both single channel and\nmixed models, and that the rate in S0 and E galaxies may effectively provide\nclues on the contribution of SD progenitors to late epoch explosions. A wide\nrange of masses for the CO WD at the start of accretion is expected in almost\nall galaxy types; only in galaxies of the earliest types the properties of the\nprogenitors are expected to be more uniform.

For some of the EoS' we find that a new\nsolution branch, which allows highly massive neutron stars, exists for values\nof alpha greater than a few 10^9 cm^2.

For a cored isothermal cluster with the core radius\n$R_c$, the inner region with $R\\le R_c$ appears noisy containing on average\n$\\sim 2.4$ peaks with $\\nu\\ge 5$ for $R_c= 1.7\\hbox{ arcmin}$ and the true peak\nheight of the cluster $\\nu=5.6$, where $\\nu$ denotes the convergence signal to\nnoise ratio. For a NFW cluster of the same mass and the same central $\\nu$, the\naverage number of peaks with $\\nu\\ge 5$ within $R\\le R_c$ is $\\sim 1.6$. Thus a\nhigh peak corresponding to the main cluster can be identified more cleanly in\nthe NFW case. In the outer region with $R_c<R\\le 5R_c$, the number of high\nnoise peaks is considerably enhanced in comparison with that of the pure noise\ncase without the nearby cluster. (abridged) \n\n"}

During this 11 months period, the source was\ncharacterized by a complex variability at optical, UV and gamma-ray bands, on\ntime scales down to 6-12 hours. The brightest gamma-ray isotropic luminosity,\nrecorded on 2009 March 26, was ~ 2x10^48erg s^-1. The spectrum in the Fermi-LAT\nenergy range shows a mild curvature well described by a log-parabolic law, and\ncan be understood as due to the Klein-Nishina effect. The gamma-ray flux has a\ncomplex correlation with the other wavelengths. There is no correlation at all\nwith the X-ray band, a weak correlation with the UV, and a significant\ncorrelation with the optical flux. The gamma-ray flux seems to lead the optical\none by about 13 days. From the UV photometry we estimated a black hole mass of\n~ 5.4x10^8 solar masses, and an accretion rate of ~ 0.5 solar masses/year.\nAlthough the power in the thermal and non-thermal outputs is smaller compared\nto the very luminous and distant flat spectrum radio quasars, PKS 1510-089\nexhibits a quite large Compton dominance and a prominent big blue bump (BBB) as\nobserved in the most powerful gamma-ray quasars. The BBB was still prominent\nduring the historical maximum optical state in 2009 May, but the optical/UV\nspectral index was softer than in the quiescent state.

The directly measured optical depth \\tau at a given observed\nenergy is found to be constant on average at redshift z > 2, i.e., <\\tau (0.5\nkeV) >_{z > 2} = 0.40+/- 0.02. Such an asymptotic optical depth is expected if\nthe foreground diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) dominates the absorption\neffect, and if the metallicity of the diffuse IGM reaches ~ 0.2 - 0.4 solar at\nz = 0. To further test the IGM absorption hypothesis, we analyze the 12 highest\nS/N (> 5000 photon) z > 2 quasar spectra from the XMM-Newton archive, which are\nall extremely radio loud (RLQs). The quasar optical depths are found to be\nconsistent with the mean GRB value. The four lowest-z quasars (2 < z < 2.5),\nhowever, do not show significant absorption. The best X-ray spectra of\nradio-quiet quasars (RQQs) at z > 2 provide only upper limits to the\nabsorption, which are still consistent with the RLQs, albeit with much lower\nS/N (< 1000 photons at z ~ 4). Lack of quasar absorption poses a challenge to\nthe smooth IGM interpretation, and could allude to the opacity being rather due\nto the jets in RLQs and GRBs. However, the jet absorbing column would need to\nappear in RLQs only at z > 2.5, and in GRBs to strongly increase with z in\norder to produce the observed tendency to a constant mean \\tau.

In particular, the\ngravitational potential can be different from the Newtonian one commonly\nadopted when computing the circular velocity fitted to spiral galaxies rotation\ncurves. Phenomenologically modelling the modified point mass potential as the\nsum of a Newtonian and a Yukawa like correction, we simulate observed rotation\ncurves for a spiral galaxy described as the sum of an exponential disc and a\nNFW dark matter halo. We then fit these curves assuming parameterized halo\nmodels (either with an inner cusp or a core) and using the Newtonian potential\nto estimate the theoretical rotation curve. Such a study allows us to\ninvestigate the bias on the disc and halo model parameters induced by the\nsystematic error induced by forcing the gravity theory to be Newtonian when it\nis not. As a general result, we find that both the halo scale length and virial\nmass are significantly overestimated, while the dark matter mass fraction\nwithin the disc optical radius is typically underestimated. Moreover, should\nthe Yukawa scale length be smaller than the disc half mass radius, then the\nlogarithmic slope of the halo density profile would turn out to be shallower\nthan the NFW one. Finally, cored models are able to fit quite well the\nsimulated rotation curves, provided the disc mass is biased high in agreement\nwith the results in literature, favoring cored haloes and maximal discs.

In self-annihilating dark\nmatter scenarios, these objects could be visible in the gamma-ray band as faint\nand non-variable sources without astrophysical counterpart.

We study whether generic scalar-tensor\n(ST) theories can be further constrained with EMRIs. We show that in the EMRI\nlimit, all such theories universally reduce to massive or massless Brans-Dicke\ntheory and that black holes do not emit dipolar radiation to all orders in\npost-Newtonian (PN) theory. For massless theories, we calculate the scalar\nenergy flux in the Teukolsky formalism to all orders in PN theory and fit it to\na high-order PN expansion. We derive the PN ST corrections to the Fourier\ntransform of the gravitational wave response and map it to the parameterized\npost-Einsteinian framework. We use the effective-one-body framework adapted to\nEMRIs to calculate the ST modifications to the gravitational waveform. We find\nthat such corrections are smaller than those induced in the early inspiral of\ncomparable-mass binaries, leading to projected bounds on the coupling that are\nworse than current Solar System ones. Brans-Dicke theory modifies the\nweak-field, with deviations in the energy flux that are largest at small\nvelocities.

While a strong interaction\nbetween SN ejecta and dense circumstellar media (CSM) is a leading scenario,\nalternative models have been proposed. In this Letter, we suggest new\ndiagnostics to discriminate the strong SN-CSM interaction scenario from the\nothers: a decline in the luminosity ('dip') before the main peak of the light\ncurve. This dip is an unavoidable consequence of having a dense CSM within\nwhich the shock breakout occurs. If a dense CSM shell is located far at large\nradii from the progenitor inside, it takes time for the SN ejecta to reach it\nand the early light curve can be powered by the SN ejecta before the collision.\nOnce the SN ejecta collides with the dense CSM, the electron density and thus\nthe Thomson scattering opacity suddenly increase. Photons become unable to go\nout of the shock even if there is a source of emission inside, which results in\nthe dip in the light curve. This dip is a solid prediction from the strong\ninteraction scenario irrespective of a power source for the early emission.\nEventually the forward shock breaks out from within the dense CSM, and the\nluminosity increases by the continuous strong SN-CSM interaction, resulting in\nan SLSN.

Using a sample with a broad range in orientation\nangle, including radio galaxies and blazars, we find that very high power\nsources (L_kin > 10^45.5 erg s^{-1}) show a significant increase in the ratio\nof inverse Compton to synchrotron power (Compton dominance) with decreasing\norientation angle, as measured by the radio core dominance and confirmed by the\ndistribution of superluminal speeds. This increase is consistent with beaming\nexpectations for external Compton (EC) emission, but not for synchrotron self\nCompton (SSC) emission. For the lowest power jets (L_kin < 10^43.5 erg s^{-1}),\nno trend between Compton and radio core dominance is found, consistent with\nSSC. Importantly, the EC trend is not seen for moderately high power flat\nspectrum radio quasars with strong external photon fields. Coupled with the\nevidence that jet power is linked to the jet speed (Kharb et al. 2010), this\nfinding suggests that external photon fields become the dominant source of seed\nphotons in the jet comoving frame only for the faster and therefore more\npowerful jets. \n\n"}

Models in which the\ncontinuum above 10 keV is dominated by the direct (unscattered) continuum or\nCompton-scattered continuum give the highest and lowest intrinsic luminosities\nrespectively. Variability properties favor solutions in which the unscattered\ncontinuum dominates above 10 keV.

This leads to the fact that scalar radiation is emitted\nfrom a binary containing at least one BH. In this letter, we find the\nconstraints on this theory from BH low-mass X-ray binaries (BH-LMXBs). The main\nresult of this letter is that from the orbital decay rate of A0620-00, we\nobtained a conservative bound that is six orders of magnitude stronger than the\nsolar system bound. In addition to this, we look at XTE J1118+480, whose\norbital decay rate has been recently measured with an excess compared to the\ntheoretical prediction in GR due to the radiation reaction. The cause of this\nexcess is currently unknown. Although it is likely that the cause is of\nastrophysical origin, here we investigate the possibility of explaining this\nexcess with the additional scalar radiation in sGB theory. We find that there\nstill remains a parameter range where the excess can be explained while also\nsatisfying the constraint obtained from A0620-00. The interesting point is that\nfor most of other alternative theories of gravity, it seems difficult to\nexplain this excess with the additional radiation. This is because it would be\ndifficult to evade the constraints from binary pulsars or they have already\nbeen constrained rather strongly from other observations such as solar system\nexperiments.

The energy of one\nparticle from the viewpoint of the Kruskal observer (or the one obtained from\nit by finite local boost) diverges although in the stationary frame energies of\nboth colliding particles are finite.

The mass-energy delivered to the\nblack hole can be red-shifted by letting the dropping point of the shell\napproach the black-hole horizon.

This indicates that the smaller holes have higher\nsurface gravity. For analogue Hawking effects, however, the acoustic surface\ngravity is determined by the local values of the dynamical velocity of the\nstationary background fluid flow and the speed of propagation of the\ncharacteristic perturbation embedded in the background fluid, as well as by\ntheir space derivatives evaluated along the direction normal to the acoustic\nhorizon, respectively. The mass of the analogue system - whether classical or\nquantum - does not directly contribute to extremise the value of the associated\nacoustic surface gravity. For general relativistic axially symmetric background\nfluid flow in the Schwarzschild metric, we show that the initial boundary\nconditions describing such accretion influence the maximization scheme of the\nacoustic surface gravity and associated analogue temperature. Aforementioned\nbackground flow onto black holes can assume three distinct geometric\nconfigurations.

We find that for low-mass binaries within that\nfamily of configurations, where the observable waveform is dominated by the\ninspiral, the systematic bias in all physical parameters is smaller than the\nparameter uncertainty due to degeneracies between the mass ratio and the spins,\nat least up to signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 50.

A GWB induces time-of-arrival deviations in\npulsar signals which are correlated between separated pulsars.

These WD mass distributions are then\ncompared with the observed Galactic WD mass distribution and Monte Carlo\nsimulations of WD-WD binary populations.

Thus, if collisions produce a large fraction of SNe\nIa, then a mechanism must exist that favors large mass WDs. On the other hand,\nin an old stellar population, collisions would naturally result in a class of\nlow luminosity SNe Ia, and we suggest these may be related to 1991bg-like\nevents. For sub-Chandrasekhar detonations, we find that the average mass of the\nexploding WDs must be peaked at ~1.1Msun.

Our numerical results show that rapidly\nrotating neutron star models with a nontrivial scalar field exist in both cases\nand that the effect of the scalar field is stronger for rapid rotation. If we\nconsider values of the coupling parameters in accordance with current\nobservations, only the second example of scalar-tensor theories has significant\ninfluence on the neutron star structure. We show that scalarized, rapidly\nrotating neutron stars exist for a larger range of the parameters than in the\nstatic case, since a nontrivial scalar field is present even for values of the\ncoupling constant $\\beta>-4.35$, and that these solutions are energetically\nmore favorable than the general relativistic ones.

The perils of such a\nsearch may have appeared insurmountable when considering the coarse ring-shaped\nGW localizations spanning thousands of deg^2 using time-of-arrival information\nalone. We show that leveraging the amplitude and phase information of the\npredicted GW signal narrows the localization to arcs with a median area of only\n~250 deg^2, thereby making an EM search tractable. Based on the locations and\norientations of the two LIGO detectors, we find that the GW sensitivity is\nlimited to one polarization and thus to only two sky quadrants. Thus, the rates\nof GW events with two interferometers is only ~40% of the rate with three\ninterferometers of similar sensitivity. Another important implication of the\nsky quadrant bias is that EM observatories in North America and Southern Africa\nwould be able to systematically respond to GW triggers several hours sooner\nthan Russia and Chile.

The\nkey point is that the locus of emission of Hawking radiation is not the\nglobally defined event horizon. Rather the emission domain lies just outside a\ntimelike Marginal Outer Trapped Surface that is locally defined. The emission\ndomain is mainly located inside the event horizon. A spacelike singularity\nforms behind the event horizon, and most of the Hawking radiation ends up at\nthis singularity rather than at infinity. Whether any Hawking radiation reaches\ninfinity depends on the relation between the emission domain and the event\nhorizon. From the outside view, even if radiation is seen as always being\nemitted, the black hole never evaporates away, rather its mass and entropy\nasymptote to finite non-zero limits, and the event horizon always acts as a\nsink for matter and information.

The interpretation of this has\nbeen the subject of considerable debate, and it has been suggested that all\nredshifts are a relative velocity effect, raising the question of whether the\nwavelength always stretches in proportion to the emitter-receiver separation.\nHere we show that, for low redshift at least, $\\Delta\\log(\\lambda / D)$\nvanishes for a photon exchanged between any two freely-falling observers in a\nspatially constant tidal field, because such a field stretches wavelengths and\nthe space between the observers identically. But in general there is a\nnon-kinematic, and essentially gravitational, component of the redshift that is\ngiven by a weighted average of the gradient of the tidal field along the photon\npath. While the redshift can always be formally expressed using the Doppler\nformula, in situations where the gravitational redshift dominates, the\n`relative velocity' is typically quite different from the rate of change of $D$\nand it is misleading to think of the redshift as being a velocity or\n`kinematic' effect. \n\n"}

A serious obstacle here, however, is the challenge of\ncomputing theoretical waveforms for eccentric systems with the requisite\naccuracy for use in a matched-filter search. The corresponding waveforms are\nmore a sequence of concentrated bursts of energy emitted near periapse than a\ncontinuous waveform. Based on this, an alternative approach, stacking excess\npower over the set of time-frequency tiles coincident with the bursts, was\nrecently suggested as a more practical (though sub-optimal) detection strategy.\nThe leading-order \"observable\" that would be inferred from such a detection\nwould be a sequence of discrete numbers characterizing the position and size of\neach time-frequency tile. In General Relativity, this (possibly large) sequence\nof numbers is uniquely determined by the small set of parameters describing the\nbinary at formation.

Tidal\ncoupling also distorts the binary's members, changing them (at lowest order)\nfrom spheres to ellipsoids. At least in the limit of fluid bodies and Newtonian\ngravity, there are simple connections between the geometry of the distorted\nellipsoid and the impact of tides on the orbit's evolution. In this paper, we\ndevelop tools for investigating tidal distortions of rapidly rotating black\nholes using techniques that are good for strong-field, fast-motion binary\norbits. We use black hole perturbation theory, so our results assume extreme\nmass ratios. We develop tools to compute the distortion to a black hole's\ncurvature for any spin parameter, and for tidal fields arising from any bound\norbit, in the frequency domain. We also develop tools to visualize the\nhorizon's distortion for black hole spin $a/M \\le \\sqrt{3}/2$ (leaving the more\ncomplicated $a/M > \\sqrt{3}/2$ case to a future analysis). We then study how a\nKerr black hole's event horizon is distorted by a small body in a circular,\nequatorial orbit.

Both contain cosmological information. In this\npaper we are concerned with the magnification of the size and magnitude of\nindividual galaxies as a probe of cosmic convergence. We develop a Bayesian\napproach for inferring the convergence field from a measured size, magnitude\nand redshift and demonstrate that the inference on convergence requires\ndetailed knowledge of the joint distribution of intrinsic sizes and magnitudes.\nWe build a simple parameterised model for the size-magnitude distribution and\nestimate this distribution for CFHTLenS galaxies. In light of the measured\ndistribution, we show that the typical dispersion on convergence estimation is\n~0.8, compared to ~0.38 for shear. We discuss the possibility of physical\nsystematics for magnification (similar to intrinsic alignments for shear) and\ncompute the expected gains in the Dark Energy Figure-of-Merit (FoM) from\ncombining magnification with shear for different scenarios regarding\nsystematics: when accounting for intrinsic alignments but no systematics on the\nmagnification signal, including magnification could improve the FoM by upto a\nfactor of ~2.5, whilst when accounting for physical systematics in both shear\nand magnification we anticipate a gain between ~25% and ~65%.

Anisotropy is known to affect the\nbulk properties of nonrotating neutron stars in General Relativity.

{"id": "1505.04719", "contents": "Title: Metallicity at the explosion sites of interacting transients Abstract: Context. Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced\nby the explosions of massive stars that have lost mass shortly before the SN\nexplosion. There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous\nblue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been\nobserved before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as\nSN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still\nunclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the\nexistence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with\nsuperwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN\nprogenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on\nthe nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments,\nin particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain\nmetallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn,\nSNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained\nat the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives. Metallicity values\nfrom the literature complement our sample. We compare the metallicity\ndistributions among the different CSI SN subtypes and to those of other\ncore-collapse SN types. We also search for possible correlations between\nmetallicity and CSI SN observational properties. Results. We find that SN IMs\ntend to occur in environments with lower metallicity than those of SNe IIn.\nAmong SNe IIn, SN IIn-L(1998S-like) SNe show higher metallicities, similar to\nthose of SNe IIL/P, whereas long-lasting SNe IIn (1988Z-like) show lower\nmetallicities, similar to those of SN IMs. The metallicity distribution of SNe\nIIn can be reproduced by combining the metallicity distributions of SN IMs\n(that may be produced by major outbursts of massive stars like LBVs) and SNe\nIIP (produced by RSGs). The same applies to the distributions of the Normalized\nCumulative Rank (NCR) values, which quantifies the SN association to H II\nregions. For SNe IIn, we find larger mass-loss rates and higher CSM velocities\nat higher metallicities. The luminosity increment in the optical bands during\nSN IM outbursts tend to be larger at higher metallicity, whereas the SN IM\nquiescent optical luminosities tend to be lower. Conclusions. The difference in\nmetallicity between SNe IIn and SN IMs suggests that LBVs are only one of the\nprogenitor channels for SNe IIn, with 1988Z-like and 1998S-like SNe possibly\narising from LBVs and RSGs, respectively. Finally, even though linedriven winds\nlikely do not primarily drive the late mass-loss of CSI SN progenitors,\nmetallicity has some impact on the observational properties of these\ntransients.

Much effort has gone into\ncomputing \"self force\" corrections to this motion, arising from the small\nbody's own contributions to the system's spacetime. Another correction to the\nmotion arises from coupling of the small body's spin to the black hole's\nspacetime curvature.

Such solutions are often difficult to find in\nbeyond-general-relativity theories due to the inclusion of additional fields\nthat couple to the metric non-linearly and non-minimally. In this paper, we\nconsider rotating black hole solutions in one such theory, dynamical\nChern-Simons gravity, where the Einstein-Hilbert action is modified by the\nintroduction of a dynamical scalar field that couples to the metric through the\nPontryagin density. We treat dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as an effective\nfield theory and work in the decoupling limit, where corrections are treated as\nsmall perturbations from general relativity.

The agents responsible for mediating the MONDian force law are\nsuperfluid phonons that couple to ordinary (baryonic) matter. In this paper we\npropose an alternative way for the MOND phenomenon to emerge from DM\nsuperfluidity. The central idea is to use higher-gradient corrections in the\nsuperfluid effective theory. These next-to-leading order terms involve\ngradients of the gravitational potential, and therefore effectively modify the\ngravitational force law. In the process we discover a novel mechanism for\ngenerating the non-relativistic MOND action, starting from a theory that is\nfully analytic in all field variables. The idea, inspired by the symmetron\nmechanism, uses the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. For large\nacceleration, the symmetry is unbroken and the action reduces to Einstein\ngravity.

Such BHs bifurcate\nfrom the vacuum Kerr solution and can be regarded as a horizon within a\nrotating boson star. In a recent letter, it was shown that KBHsSH can exhibit\nvery distinct shadows from the ones of their vacuum counterparts. The setup\ntherein, however, considered the light source to be a celestial sphere\nsufficiently far away from the BH. Here, we analyse KBHsSH surrounded by an\nemitting torus of matter, simulating a more realistic astrophysical\nenvironment, and study the corresponding lensing of light as seen by a very far\naway observer, to appropriately model ground-based observations of Sgr A*. We\nfind that the differences in imaging between KBHsSH and comparable vacuum Kerr\nBHs remain, albeit less dramatic than those observed for the corresponding\nshadows in the previous setup.

Recently, the\nGHz-peaked spectrum source PKS 1718-649 was confirmed to be gamma-ray bright,\nproviding further evidence for the existence of a population of gamma-ray loud,\ncompact radio galaxies. A spectral turnover in the radio spectrum in the MHz to\nGHz range is a characteristic feature of these objects, which are thought to be\nyoung due to their small linear sizes.

We detect a low-frequency turnover of the spectrum and\nmeasure the peak position at about 490 MHz (rest-frame), which, using the known\nrelation of peak frequency and linear size, translates into a maximum linear\nsource size of ~1.4 kpc.

For astrophysical applications, one\nneeds to have a metric that captures all the properties of the spacetime around\na neutron star. Furthermore, an accurate appropriately parameterised metric,\ni.e., a metric that is given in terms of parameters that are directly related\nto the physical structure of the neutron star, could be used to solve the\ninverse problem, which is to infer the properties of the structure of a neutron\nstar from astrophysical observations. In this work we present such an\napproximate stationary and axisymmetric metric for the exterior of neutron\nstars, which is constructed using the Ernst formalism and is parameterised by\nthe relativistic multipole moments of the central object. This metric is given\nin terms of an expansion on the Weyl-Papapetrou coordinates with the multipole\nmoments as free parameters and is shown to be extremely accurate in capturing\nthe physical properties of a neutron star spacetime as they are calculated\nnumerically in general relativity. Because the metric is given in terms of an\nexpansion, the expressions are much simpler and easier to implement, in\ncontrast to previous approaches. For the parameterisation of the metric in\ngeneral relativity, the recently discovered universal 3-hair relations are used\nto produce a 3-parameter metric. Finally, a straightforward extension of this\nmetric is given for scalar-tensor theories with a massless scalar field, which\nalso admit a formulation in terms of an Ernst potential. \n\n"}

The afterglow position is\ncoincident with the disk of a galaxy ESO 580-49 at z= 0.01326 (~1\" from its\ncenter), which makes GRB 111005A the second closest GRB known to date, after\nGRB 980425. The radio afterglow of GRB 111005A was an order of magnitude less\nluminous than those of local low-luminosity GRBs, and obviously than those of\ncosmological GRBs. The radio flux was approximately constant and then\nexperienced an unusually rapid decay a month after the GRB explosion. Similarly\nto only two other GRBs, we did not find the associated supernovae (SN), despite\ndeep near- and mid-infrared observations 1-9 days after the GRB explosion,\nreaching ~20 times fainter than other SNe associated with GRBs. Moreover, we\nmeasured twice solar metallicity for the GRB location. The low gamma-ray and\nradio luminosities, rapid decay, lack of a SN, and super-solar metallicity\nsuggest that GRB 111005A represents a different rare class of GRBs than typical\ncore-collapse events. We modelled the spectral energy distribution of the GRB\n111005A host finding that it is a dwarf, moderately star-forming galaxy,\nsimilar to the host of GRB 980425. The existence of two local GRBs in such\ngalaxies is still consistent with the hypothesis that the GRB rate is\nproportional to the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) density, but suggests that\nthe GRB rate is biased towards low SFRs. Using the far-infrared detection of\nESO 580-49, we conclude that the hosts of both GRBs 111005A and 980425 exhibit\nlower dust content than what would be expected from their stellar masses and\noptical colours. \n\n"}

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are\nused to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of\nthe morphological classes.

The resulting classification and\ncharacterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and\nsubsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby\nimproving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations.

Simulating a BBH coalescence\nby solving Einstein's equations numerically is computationally expensive,\nrequiring days to months of computing resources for a single set of parameter\nvalues. Since theoretical predictions of the GWs are often needed for many\ndifferent source parameters, a fast and accurate model is essential. We present\nthe first surrogate model for GWs from the coalescence of BBHs including all\n$7$ dimensions of the intrinsic non-eccentric parameter space.

To examine formation and\noscillation of rapidly rotating neutron stars (NS) after merger, we present an\nexploratory study of fully general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations using\nthe public code Einstein Toolkit. The attention is focused on qualitative\naspects of long-term postmerger evolution. As simplified test models, we use a\nmoderately stiff Gamma=2 ideal-fluid equation of state and unmagnetized\nirrotational equal-mass binaries with three masses well below the threshold for\nprompt collapse.

Here we use our new population-synthesis code MOBSE,\nan upgraded version of BSE (Hurley et al. 2002), to investigate the demography\nof merging BHBs. MOBSE includes metallicity-dependent prescriptions for mass\nloss of massive hot stars. It also accounts for the impact of the\nelectron-scattering Eddington factor on mass loss.

However, most BHs in merging BHBs have masses <40 Msun.\nWe find merging BHBs with mass ratios in the 0.1 - 1.0 range, even if mass\nratios >0.6 are more likely.

We show through 2D (axisymmetric) simulations that rings and gaps\ndevelop naturally in magnetically coupled disk-wind systems on the scale of\ntens of au, where ambipolar diffusion (AD) is the dominant non-ideal MHD\neffect. In simulations where the magnetic field and matter are moderately\ncoupled, the disk remains relatively laminar with the radial electric current\nsteepened by AD into a thin layer near the midplane. The toroidal magnetic\nfield sharply reverses polarity in this layer, generating a large magnetic\ntorque that drives fast accretion, which drags the poloidal field into a highly\npinched radial configuration. The reconnection of this pinched field creates\nmagnetic loops where the net poloidal magnetic flux (and thus the accretion\nrate) is reduced, yielding dense rings. Neighbouring regions with stronger\npoloidal magnetic fields accrete faster, forming gaps. In better magnetically\ncoupled simulations, the so-called `avalanche accretion streams' develop\ncontinuously near the disk surface, rendering the disk-wind system more\nchaotic. Nevertheless, prominent rings and gaps are still produced, at least in\npart, by reconnection, which again enables the segregation of the poloidal\nfield and the disk material similar to the more diffusive disks.

In particular,\ndeviations from General Relativity can be observed by comparing incoming\nsignals to waveform templates that include parametrized deviations from General\nRelativity. However, it is essential that the General Relativity sector of\nthese templates accounts for all predictable physics. Otherwise, missing\nphysics might be mimicked by the \"beyond General Relativity\" sector of the\ntemplates, leading the analysis to report apparent deviations from General\nRelativity. Current parametrized tests implement templates that omit physical\nphenomena such as orbital eccentricity and higher-order modes. In this paper,\nwe show how the omission of higher modes can lead to false deviations from\nGeneral Relativity when these effects are strong enough. We study the extent of\nthese deviations as a function of the mass ratio and the orbital orientation.\nWe find that significant false deviations can arise when current tests are\nperformed on signals emitted by asymmetric binaries whose orbital angular\nmomentum is orthogonal to the line-of-sight. We estimate that the Advanced\nLIGO-Virgo network operating at its design sensitivity can observe false\nviolations with a significance above $5 \\sigma$ as often as once per year.\nSimilar results are expected for other tests of General Relativity that use\nmodified waveform models.

Here we find that\nthe first six binary black hole (BBH) merging events reported by LIGO/Virgo\nshow clear evidence for lensing in the plane of observed mass and source\ndistance. The four lowest frequency events follow an apparent locus in this\nplane, which we can reproduce by galaxy lensing, where the higher the\nmagnification, the generally more distant the source so the wave train is\nstretched more by the Universal expansion, by factors of 2-4. This revises the\nreported BBH distances upwards by an order of magnitude, equal to the square\nroot of the magnification. Furthermore, the reported black hole masses must be\ndecreased by 2-4 to counter the larger stretch factor, since the orbital\nfrequency is used to derive the black hole masses. This lowers the masses to\n5-15 solar masses, well below the puzzlingly high values of 20-35 solar masses\notherwise estimated, with the attraction of finding agreement in mass with\nblack holes orbiting stars in our own Galaxy, thereby implying a stellar origin\nfor the low frequency events in the far Universe.

Recent simulations of spinning black holes and (indirect) theoretical\npredictions, suggest that a somewhat analogous effect may occur for purely\ngravitational phenomena. The magnitude and precise direction of this\n\"gravitational Magnus effect\" is still the subject of debate. Starting from the\nrigorous equations of motion for spinning bodies in General Relativity\n(Mathisson-Papapetrou equations), we show that indeed such an effect takes\nplace and is a fundamental part of the spin-curvature force. The effect arises\nwhenever there is a current of mass/energy, non-parallel to a body's spin.

We have studied the orbital and spin evolution of\nbinary BHs in triple systems, where the tertiary companion excites large\neccentricity in the inner binary through Lidov-Kozai oscillations, causing the\nbinary to merge via gravitational radiation. Using the single-orbital-averaged\nand double-orbital-averaged secular dynamics equations of triples, we determine\nthe merger window (the range of companion inclinations that allows the inner\nbinary to merge) and the merger fraction as a function of various system\nparameters. For typical BH binaries, the merger fraction increases rapidly with\nthe perturber eccentricity $e_{\\rm out}$ because of the octupole perturbation,\nreaching $10-20\\%$ at $e_{\\rm out}=0.9$. We derive the analytical expressions\nfor the merger window and merger fraction for systems with negligible octupole\neffect, and apply them to neutron star binary mergers in triples. We also\nfollow the spin evolution of the BHs during the companion-induced orbital\ndecay. Starting from aligned spin axes, a wide range of final spin-orbit\nmisalignment angle $\\theta_{\\rm sl}^{\\rm f}$ can be generated when the binary\nenters the LIGO band.

Moreover, more than one branch of scalarized\nsolutions can bifurcate from the Schwarzschild branch, and these scalarized\nbranches are characterized by the number of nodes of the scalar field. The next\nstep is to consider the linear stability of these solutions, which is\nparticularly important due to the fact that the Schwarzschild black holes lose\nstability at the first point of bifurcation. Therefore we here study in detail\nthe radial perturbations of the scalarized EGB black holes. The results show\nthat all branches with a nontrivial scalar field with one or more nodes are\nunstable.

Particularly, the configurations of the compact subsystems,\nthat drive the in-cluster GR BBH coalescences, are tracked on the fly. Such an\napproach reveals that the GR coalescences within the open clusters take place\nprimarily via chaotic interactions involving triple BH systems.

We propose\nthat the formation of the dissipative structures in the jet is controlled by\nthe time variability of the accretion disc. We argue that the open magnetic\nfield lines through the black hole, which drive a strongly magnetized jet, may\nhave their polarity reversing over time-scales related to the growth of the\nmagneto-rotational dynamo in the disc. Consequently, the jet is characterized\nby an alternating toroidal field polarity along its propagation axis, i.e., it\nis a \"striped jet\". Magnetic reconnection in the current sheets that form\nbetween the stripes dissipates the alternating-field energy and thus powers\nfurther jet acceleration. Here, we consider a jet with a broad distribution of\nstripe widths $l>l_{\\rm min}$, above a dominant scale $l_{\\rm min}$. We find\nthat the bulk acceleration of the jet, driven by the annihilation of the\nstripes, is very gradual. The dissipation rate peaks at a distance $z_{\\rm\npeak}\\sim 10^6 R_g\\, (\\Gamma_\\infty/30)^2\\, (l_{\\rm min}/1000R_g)$, where\n$R_{g}$ is the black-hole's gravititional radius and $\\Gamma_{\\infty}$ the\njet's asymptotic Lorentz factor, and exhibits a very broad plateau extending by\n$\\sim 4-5$ orders of magnitude in distance.

The model can also account for the broad range of flaring timescales of\nblazars and the fact that their bulk acceleration appears to continue out to\n~100 pc scales. In GRB jets, the model predicts comparable power for the\nphotopsheric and Thomson-thin emission components. \n\n"}

One could test each theory against observed data one at a\ntime, though a more efficient approach would be to first probe gravity in a\ntheory-agnostic way and map such information to that on specific theories\nafterward. One example of such model-independent tests with gravitational waves\nis the parameterized post-Einsteinian formalism, where one introduces generic\nparameters in the amplitude and phase that capture non-Einsteinian effects. In\nthis paper, we derive gravitational waveforms from inspiraling compact binaries\nin various modified theories of gravity that violate at least one fundamental\npillar in general relativity. We achieve this by deriving relations between\ncorrections to the waveform amplitude/phase and those to the frequency\nevolution and Kepler's third law, since the latter two have already been (or\ncan easily be) derived in many theories. Such an analysis allows us to derive\ncorrections to the waveform amplitude, which extends many of previous works\nthat focused on phase corrections only.

In this paper, we extend the investigations of our previous\nwork, by proposing to measure (a) spin-induced quadrupole effects, (b)\nsimultaneous measurements of spin-induced quadrupole and octupole effects, in\nthe context of the third-generation detectors. We find that, using\nthird-generation detectors the symmetric combination of coefficients associated\nwith spin-induced quadrupole moment of each binary component may be constrained\nto a value $\\leq 1.1$ while a similar combination of coefficients for\nspin-induced octupole moment may be constrained to $\\leq 2$, where both\ncombinations take the value of 1 for a binary black hole system. Further, we\nconsider two different binary black hole populations, as proxies of the\npopulation that will be observed by the third generation detectors, and obtain\nthe resulting distribution of the spin-induced quadrupole coefficient. These\nestimates suggest that third-generation detectors can accurately constrain the\nfirst four multipole moments of the compact objects (mass, spin, quadrupole,\nand octupole) facilitating a thorough probe of their black hole nature. \n\n"}

This result is often\nrelated to a reformulation of the fourth-order equations for the metric into a\nset of second-order equations for a multiplet of fields, including a massive\nscalar field and a massive spin-2 field.

In this\nlimit, each of the fundamental fields can be excited from its ground state\nindependently from the others. The question is: does higher-derivative gravity\nadmit a test-field limit for its fundamental fields? It is easy to show that\nfor a f(R) theory the test-field limit does exist; then, we consider the case\nof Lagrangians quadratically depending on the full Ricci tensor.

Given that the model\nwith 4-fermion interactions is nonrenormalizable in the traditional sense, the\naim is to gain insight into the divergent integrals without resorting to\nexplicit regularization. We impose a restriction on the linearly divergent\nprimitive integrals, thus resolving the long-standing issue of momentum routing\nambiguity associated with fermion-antifermion condensations. The removal of the\nambiguity paves the way for the possible calculation of the true ratio of Higgs\nboson mass to top quark mass in the top condensation model.

The amplitudes of these modes\nare determined by the mass ratio of the system and the geometry of the\ncoalescence. This paper is part I of an analysis that aims to compute the\n\"excitation factors\" associated with misaligned binary black hole coalescence.\nTo simplify the analysis, we consider a large mass ratio system consisting of a\nnon-spinning body of mass $\\mu$ that inspirals on a quasi-circular trajectory\ninto a Kerr black hole of mass $M$ and spin parameter $a$, with $\\mu/M \\ll 1$.\nOur goal is to understand how different modes are excited as a function of the\nblack hole spin $a$ and an angle $I$ which characterizes the misalignment of\nthe orbit with the black hole's spin axis. Though the large mass ratio limit\ndoes not describe the binaries that are being observed by gravitational-wave\ndetectors today, this limit makes it possible to quickly and easily explore the\nbinary parameter space, and to develop insight into how the system's late\nringing waves depend on the binary's geometry.

Abstract: When simulating the inspiral and coalescence of a binary black-hole system,\nspecial care needs to be taken in handling the singularities. Two main\ntechniques are used in numerical-relativity simulations: A first and more\ntraditional one ``excises'' a spatial neighbourhood of the singularity from the\nnumerical grid on each spacelike hypersurface. A second and more recent one,\ninstead, begins with a ``puncture'' solution and then evolves the full\n3-metric, including the singular point. In the continuum limit, excision is\njustified by the light-cone structure of the Einstein equations and, in\npractice, can give accurate numerical solutions when suitable discretizations\nare used. However, because the field variables are non-differentiable at the\npuncture, there is no proof that the moving-punctures technique is correct,\nparticularly in the discrete case. To investigate this question we use both\ntechniques to evolve a binary system of equal-mass non-spinning black holes. We\ncompare the evolution of two curvature 4-scalars with proper time along the\ninvariantly-defined worldline midway between the two black holes, using\nRichardson extrapolation to reduce the influence of finite-difference\ntruncation errors.

In general relativity, causal structure is non-fixed. In\nquantum theory non-fixed quantities are subject to quantum uncertainty. It is\ntherefore likely that, in a theory of quantum gravity, we will have indefinite\ncausal structure. This means that there will be no matter of fact as to whether\na particular interval is timelike or not. We study the implications of this for\nthe theory of computation. Classical and quantum computations consist in\nivolving the state of the computer through a sequence of time steps. This will,\nmost likely, not be possible for a quantum gravity computer because the notion\nof a time step makes no sense if we have indefinite causal structure. We show\nthat it is possible to set up a model for computation even in the absence of\ndefinite causal structure by using a certain framework (the causaloid\nformalism) that was developed for the purpose of correlating data taken in this\ntype of situation. Corresponding to a physical theory is a causaloid, Lambda\n(this is a mathematical object containing information about the causal\nconnections between different spacetime regions). A computer is given by the\npair {Lambda, S} where S is a set of gates. Working within the causaloid\nformalism, we explore the question of whether universal quantum gravity\ncomputers are possible. We also examine whether a quantum gravity computer\nmight be more powerful than a quantum (or classical) computer. In particular,\nwe ask whether indefinite causal structure can be used as a computational\nresource. \n\n"}
