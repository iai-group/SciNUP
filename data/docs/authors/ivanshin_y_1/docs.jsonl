The decoherence parameters as well as their energy\ndependence are chosen in such a way that the damping affects only oscillations\nwith the large (atmospheric) $\\Delta m^2$ and rapidly decreases with the\nneutrino energy.

In\nthis model in addition to Standard Model one loop contributions these processes\nreceive tree level contributions from the Z boson and the new heavy electroweak\ngauge bosons. We analyse all these contributions that turn out to be dominated\nby tree level Z boson exchanges governed by right-handed couplings to down-type\nquarks. Imposing all existing constraints from Delta F=2 transitions analysed\nby us recently and fitting all quark masses and CKM mixing parameters we find\nthat a number of branching ratios for rare K decays can differ significantly\nfrom the SM predictions, while the corresponding effects in rare B decays are\nmodest, dominantly due to the custodial protection being more effective in B\ndecays than in K decays.

This contradiction could be solved if the form factor\nF^{B_s K} is smaller than the light cone sum rules estimation or the \"tree\"\namplitude has been over estimated in QCDF.

Methods: We calculate the neutrino flux from $\\beta$\nprocesses using nuclear statistical equilibrium abundances convoluted with\napproximate neutrino spectra of the individual nuclei and the thermal neutrino\nspectrum (pair+plasma). Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation.

It indicates that the anomalous Be-9\nresult should be explained by a different mechanism from the nuclear binding\nand Fermi motion. If nuclear-modification slopes d(F_2^A/F_2^D)/dx are shown by\nthe maximum local densities, the Be-9 anomaly can be explained by the AMD\npicture, namely by the clustering structure, whereas it certainly cannot be\ndescribed in the simple shell model. This fact suggests that the large nuclear\nmodification in Be-9 should be explained by large densities in the clusters.\nFor example, internal nucleon structure could be modified in the high-density\nclusters. The clustering aspect of nuclear structure functions is an unexplored\ntopic which is interesting for future investigations. \n\n"}

However, the SM fails to explain the non-visible but\ngravitationally active part of the universe.

Quantum states in the\ngravity potential are intimately related to other scalar field or spin-0-bosons\nif they exist.

Recent results from ALICE in Pb-Pb collisions exhibit\na smaller suppression with respect to previous measurements at the SPS and\nRHIC. The study of azimuthal anisotropy in particle production gives\ninformation on the collective hydrodynamic expansion at the early stage of the\nfireball, where the matter created in high-energy nuclear collisions is\nexpected to be in a deconfined state. In particular, J/psi elliptic flow v2 is\nimportant to test the degree of thermalization of heavy quarks.

Conventionally, this problem is overcome by the use of\nion-gating structures. This method, however, introduces large dead times and\nrestricts trigger rates to a few hundred per second. The ion gate can be\neliminated from the setup by the use of Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) foils for\ngas amplification, which intrinsically suppress the backflow of ions. This\nmakes the continuous operation of a TPC at high rates feasible.\n  In this work, Monte Carlo simulations of the buildup of ion space charge in a\nGEM-based TPC and the correction of the resulting drift distortions are\ndiscussed, based on realistic numbers for the ion backflow in a triple-GEM\namplification stack.

During the early stages of the Universe, the dark\nmatter particles are produced in a process similar to baryogenesis, and dark\nmatter freeze-out depends on the dark matter asymmetry and the annihilation\ncross section (s-wave and p-wave annihilation channels). In these\n\\eta-parametrised asymmetric dark matter models (\\eta-ADM), the dark matter\nparticles have an annihilation cross section close to the weak interaction\ncross section, and a value of \\eta-dark matter asymmetry close to the baryon\nasymmetry \\eta_B. Furthermore, we assume that dark matter scattering of\nbaryons, namely, the spin-independent scattering cross section, is of the same\norder as the range of values suggested by several theoretical particle physics\nmodels used to explain the current unexplained events reported in the\nDAMA/LIBRA, CoGeNT and CRESST experiments.

The measured Higgs mass constrains the scalar sparticles to\nbe below 10^5 TeV, while gauge coupling unification favors Higgsinos below 100\nTeV.

For the first\nproblem where experimental data have already been observed, the classical\nstatistical analysis involves constructing confidence intervals for the\nparameter {\\Delta}m^2_{32}. These intervals are deduced from the parent\ndistribution of the estimation of {\\Delta}m^2_{32} based on experimental data.\nDue to existing experimental constraints on |{\\Delta}m^2_{32}|, the estimation\nof {\\Delta}m^2_{32} is better approximated by a Bernoulli distribution (a\nBinomial distribution with 1 trial) rather than a Gaussian distribution.\nTherefore, the Feldman-Cousins approach needs to be used instead of the\nGaussian approximation in constructing confidence intervals.

First,\nwe analyze the data used to claim the observation of neutrinoless double beta\ndecay in Ge-76, and find strong evidence (according to Jeffrey's scale) for a\npeak in the spectrum and moderate evidence for that the peak is actually close\nto the energy expected for the neutrinoless decay. We also find a significantly\nlarger statistical error than the original analysis, which we include in the\ncomparison with other data. Then, we statistically test the consistency between\nthis claim with that of recent measurements using Xe-136. We find that the two\ndata sets are about 40 to 80 times more probable under the assumption that they\nare inconsistent, depending on the nuclear matrix element uncertainties and the\nprior on the smallest neutrino mass.

The telescope is\ndesigned around the dual capability of the Timepix ASICs to provide information\nabout either the deposited charge or the timing information from tracks\ntraversing the 14 x 14mm matrix of 55 x 55 um pixels. The rate of reconstructed\ntracks available is optimised by taking advantage of the shutter driven readout\narchitecture of the Timepix chip, operated with existing readout systems.\nResults of tests conducted in the SPS North Area beam facility at CERN show\nthat the telescope typically provides reconstructed track rates during the beam\nspills of between 3.5 and 7.5 kHz, depending on beam conditions. The tracks are\ntime stamped with 1 ns resolution with an efficiency of above 98% and provide a\npointing resolution at the centre of the telescope of 1.6 um . By dropping the\ntime stamping requirement the rate can be increased to 15 kHz, at the expense\nof a small increase in background.

Abstract: Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), if exist in nature, are expected to mix with\nphotons in the presence of an external magnetic field. The energy range of\nphotons which undergo strong mixing with ALPs depends on the ALP mass, on its\ncoupling with photons as well as on the external magnetic field and particle\ndensity configurations. Recent observations of blazars by the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope in the 0.1-300 GeV energy range show a break in their spectra\nin the 1-10 GeV range. We have modeled this spectral feature for the\nflat-spectrum radio quasar 3C454.3 during its November 2010 outburst, assuming\nthat a significant fraction of the gamma rays convert to ALPs in the large\nscale jet of this blazar. Using theoretically motivated models for the magnetic\nfield and particle density configurations in the kiloparsec scale jet, outside\nthe broad-line region, we find an ALP mass $m_a\\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-7}$ eV and\ncoupling $g_{a\\gamma} \\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ after performing an\nillustrative statistical analysis of spectral data in four different epochs of\nemission.

We compare the results of several simulation tools:\nleading-order matrix elements, next-to-leading order matrix elements,\nleading-order plus parton shower simulations, and merged samples that contain\nthe signal process with an additional hard jet radiated. We find that\npredictions from leading-order plus parton shower simulations can significantly\ndeviate from NLO QCD or LO merged samples and do not correctly model the\nkinematics of the ttbar + ETmiss signature. They are therefore not a good\nframework for modeling this new physics signature. On the other hand, the\nacceptances obtained with a merged sample of the leading-order process together\nwith the radiation of an additional hard jet are in agreement with the NLO\npredictions. We also demonstrate that the scale variation of the inclusive\ncross section, plus that of the acceptance, does not accurately reflect the\nuncertainty of the cross section after cuts, which is typically larger. We show\nthe importance of including higher-order QCD corrections when using kinematic\ndistributions to determine the spin of the top-quark partner. \n\n"}
{"id": "1309.3549", "contents": "Title: Summary of the Nobel Symposium on LHC Results Abstract: This is a personal summary of points made during, and arising from the\nsymposium, drawing largely from the talks presented there. The Standard Model\nis doing fine, including QCD, the electroweak sector and flavour physics. The\ngood news is that a Standard-Model-like Higgs boson has appeared with the\npredicted mass, but the bad news is that the LHC has provided no hint of other\nnew physics. On the other hand, physics beyond the Standard Model is needed to\nexplain neutrino masses and mixing, and we look forward to experiments\nrevealing their mass hierarchy and CP violation. Cosmology and astrophysics\nalso require new physics to explain the origin of matter, dark matter, dark\nenergy and the CMB fluctuations. I still think that supersymmetry is the\nbest-motivated extension of the Standard Model, and look forward to the next\nphases of LHC operation at higher energy and luminosity. In the mean time,\nideas abound for a new accelerator to study the Higgs boson in detail and/or\nwhatever else the LHC may reveal in its next run. \n\n"}

Abstract: Since its first observation in 2005, the vector charmonium $Y(4260)$ has\nturned out to be one of the prime candidates for an exotic state in the\ncharmonium spectrum. It was recently proposed that the $Y(4260)$ should have a\nprominent $D_1\\bar{D}+c.c.$ molecular component that is strongly correlated\nwith the production of the charged $Z_c(3900)$. In this paper we demonstrate\nthat the nontrivial cross section line shapes of $e^+e^-\\to J/\\psi\\pi\\pi$ and\n$h_c\\pi\\pi$ can be naturally explained by the molecular scenario. As a\nconsequence we find a significantly smaller mass for the $Y(4260)$ than\nprevious studied.

The DiFFs are\nextracted as Monte Carlo (MC) averages of corresponding multiplicities using\ntheir probabilistic interpretation. To simplify the model and highlight the\npossible mechanisms that create this modulation, we choose the elementary\nCollins function to be proportional to the elementary unpolarised fragmentation\nand a constant probability ($P_{SF}$) for the quark to flip its spin after a\nsingle hadron emission.

The\nsystem is operated in vacuum, uses a bi-phase CO2 cooling system, and the\nsensors are moved to 7 mm from the LHC beam for physics data taking. The\nperformance and stability of these characteristic features of the detector are\ndescribed, and details of the material budget are given. The calibration of the\ntiming and the data processing algorithms that are implemented in FPGAs are\ndescribed. The system performance is fully characterised. The sensors have a\nsignal to noise ratio of approximately 20 and a best hit resolution of 4\nmicrons is achieved at the optimal track angle. The typical detector occupancy\nfor minimum bias events in standard operating conditions in 2011 is around\n0.5%, and the detector has less than 1% of faulty strips. The proximity of the\ndetector to the beam means that the inner regions of the n+-on-n sensors have\nundergone space-charge sign inversion due to radiation damage.

For\ngeneric Dirac mass of the neutrinos, i.e. with all Yukawa couplings $\\lesssim\n10^{-5.5}$, it has been pointed out that successful leptogenesis requires a\nlower bound of 18 TeV on the $W_R$ mass, pushing it beyond the reach of LHC.\nSuch TeV-scale LRSM must, however, be parity-asymmetric for type-I seesaw to\ngive the observed neutrino masses. This class of models can accommodate larger\nYukawa couplings, which give simultaneous fits to charged-lepton and neutrino\nmasses, by invoking either cancellations or specific symmetry-textures for\nDirac ($M_D$) and Majorana ($M_N$) masses in the seesaw formula. We show that\nin this case, the leptogenesis bound on $M_{W_R}$ can be substantially weaker,\ni.e. $M_{W_R}\\gtrsim 3$ TeV for $M_N \\lesssim M_{W_R}$. This happens due to\nconsiderable reduction of the dilution effects from $W_R$-mediated decays and\nscatterings, while the washout effects due to inverse decays are under control\nfor certain parameter ranges of the Yukawa couplings. We also show that this\nmodel is consistent with all other low energy constraints, such as lepton\nflavor violation and neutrinoless double beta decay. Thus, a discovery of the\nright-handed gauge bosons alone at the LHC will not falsify leptogenesis as the\nmechanism behind the matter-antimatter asymmetry in our Universe. \n\n"}

We report the first results of the Nucifer\nexperiment, describing the performances of the 0.85m3 detector remotely\noperating at a shallow depth equivalent to 12m of water and under intense\nbackground radiation conditions. Based on 145 (106) days of data with reactor\nON (OFF), leading to the detection of an estimated 40760 electron\nantineutrinos, the mean number of detected antineutrinos is 281 +- 7(stat) +-\n18(syst) electron antineutrinos/day, in agreement with the prediction 277(23)\nelectron antineutrinos/day. Due the the large background no conclusive results\non the existence of light sterile neutrinos could be derived, however. As a\nfirst societal application we quantify how antineutrinos could be used for the\nPlutonium Management and Disposition Agreement. \n\n"}

A recombination model is\ndeveloped to explain the recombination probability as a function of recoil\nenergy at zero field and non-zero field. The role of e-ion recombination is\ndiscussed for both parent recombination and volume recombination. We find that\nthe volume recombination under non-zero field is constrained by a plasma\neffect, which is caused by a high density of charge carriers along the\nionization track forming a plasma-like cloud of charge that shields the\ninterior from the influence of the external electric field. Subsequently, the\nplasma time that determines the volume recombination probability at non-zero\nfield is demonstrated to be different between electronic recoils and nuclear\nrecoils due to the difference of ionization density between two processes. We\nshow a weak field-dependence of the plasma time for nuclear recoils and a\nstronger field-dependence of the plasma time for electronic recoils. As a\nresult, the time-dependent recombination is implemented in the determination of\ncharge and light yield with a generic model. Our model agrees well with the\navailable experimental data from xenon-based dark matter experiments. \n\n"}

Recent analysis demonstrated that this\napproach provides a satisfactory description of the experimental data for the\ninclusive hadron production in $pp/pA/AA$ collisions.

In this paper we consider the running\ncoupling corrected $k_T$ - factorization formula conjectured some years ago and\ninvestigate the impact of the running coupling corrections on the observables.\nIn particular, the pseudorapidity distributions and charged hadrons\nmultiplicity are calculated considering $pp$, $dAu/pPb$ and $AuAu/PbPb$\ncollisions at RHIC and LHC energies.

In particular, discrete $A_4$ symmetry is used to realize\nlepton flavor structures, and some scalars which are called flavon are\nintroduced to break this symmetry. In many models, flavons are assumed to be\nmuch heavier than the electroweak scale. However, our previous work showed that\nflavon mass around 100 GeV is allowed by experimental constraints in the $A_4$\nsymmetric model with residual $Z_3$ symmetry. In this paper, we discuss\ncollider search of such a light flavon $\\varphi_T$. We find that an electron -\nphoton collision, as a considerable option at the international linear\ncollider, has advantages to search for the signals. At the electron - photon\ncollider flavons are produced as $e^-\\gamma \\to l^- \\varphi_T$ and decay into\ntwo charged leptons. Then we analyze signals of flavor-conserving final-state\n$\\tau^+ \\tau^- e^-$, and flavor-violating final-states $\\tau^+ \\mu^- \\mu^-$ and\n$\\mu^+ \\tau^- \\tau^-$ by carrying out numerical simulation. For the former\nfinal-state, SM background can be strongly suppressed by imposing cuts on the\ninvariant masses of final-state leptons. For the later final-states, SM\nbackground is extremely small, because in the SM there are no such\nflavor-violating final-states. We then find that sufficient discovery\nsignificance can be obtained, even if flavons are heavier than the lower limits\nfrom flavor physics. \n\n"}

We concentrate on radiative neutrino scattering on atomic electrons\n(or on free electrons in a conductor). Such processes can be coherent provided\nthat the net electron recoil momentum, i.e. the momentum transfer from the\nneutrino minus the momentum of the emitted photon, is sufficiently small. The\nradiative processes is an attractive possibility as the energy of the emitted\nphotons can be as large as the momentum transfer to the electron system and\ntherefore the problem of detecting extremely low energy recoils can be avoided.\nThe requirement of macroscopic coherence severely constrains the phase space\navailable for the scattered particle and the emitted photon. We show that in\nthe case of the scattering mediated by the usual weak neutral current and\ncharged current interactions this leads to a strong suppression of the\nelementary cross sections and therefore the requirement of macroscopic\ncoherence results in a reduction rather than an increase of the total detection\ncross section. However, for the $\\nu e$ scattering mediated by neutrino\nmagnetic or electric dipole moments coherence effects can actually increase the\ndetection rates. Effects of macroscopic coherence can also allow detection of\nneutrinos in 100 eV -- a few keV energy range, which is currently not\naccessible to the experiment. A similar coherent enhancement mechanism can work\nfor relativistic particles in the dark sector, but not for the conventionally\nconsidered non-relativistic dark matter. \n\n"}

Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are mostly produced by initial hard\nscatterings before the formation of the QGP. Therefore heavy-flavour hadrons\nare ideal probes to investigate the properties of the hot and dense QCD matter.\nIn Pb-Pb collisions, a strong suppression of the production of heavy-flavour\nhadrons with high transverse momentum has been observed. A deeper understanding\nof heavy-flavour production and interaction with the QGP requires detailed\nstudies of Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects in order to clarify the role of\ninitial- and final-state effects on their production.

The differences are, however, fairly small, $\\sim\n5-10%$. The data are also accurate enough to show evidence for artifacts of\nquenching predicted by chiral perturbation theory.

If the neutrals can be measured, however, the\nfluctuations in the total number of pions provides a signature which\ndistinguishes disoriented chiral condensates from other hypothetical sources of\ncoherent states of pions. \n\n"}

In this article we try to give a\ncomprehensive overview of the subject. We start with a general introduction to\ncalorimetry where the basic elements that characterize the development of\nelectromagnetic and hadronic showers are discussed. Then we describe in detail\nthe operation principle and the properties of calorimeters equipped with quartz\nfibers. The main advantages of this type of calorimeters are the radiation\nhardness, the fast response and the compact detector dimensions, features that\nderive from the quartz material and the specific mechanism of operation. A\nsection is devoted to presenting the quartz fiber calorimeters that have been\nbuilt or planned to in various experiments to operate as centrality detectors,\ntrigger detectors, luminosity monitors or general purpose very forward\ncalorimeters. \n\n"}

New ideas\ninclude muon `phase rotation' using high-frequency rf cavities and rapid muon\nacceleration in non-scaling FFAG rings. The world-wide Neutrino Factory R&D\neffort is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of the required techniques by\nthe end of this decade. If this effort is successful and the next round of\nneutrino experiments confirms the need for a Neutrino Factory, a timely\ndecision to proceed to Neutrino Factory construction will then be possible. \n\n"}
