Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

In this paper, we study the current acceleration of the\nuniverse, using the formulas developed in \\cite{WS07}.

Many YSOs are formed from dense\nprestellar cores embedded in filaments, and therefore the relative orientations\nof outflows and filaments may place useful constraints on the dynamics of core\nformation.\n  Aims: We explore this possibility, from the viewpoint of what it may tell us\nabout the angular momentum delivered to a core forming in a filament. We stress\nthat we are not here addressing the issue of the relationship of filaments and\noutflows to the prevailing magnetic field direction, although this is evidently\nalso an interesting issue.\n  Results: Using the limited data available, and neglecting any possible\nselection effects or correlations between nearby outflows, we infer that the\nobserved outflows have a tendency to be orthogonal to the filaments that\ncontain their driving sources. Specfically, in the cases where the directions\nof the filaments and outflows are well defined, we infer statistically that 72%\nof outflows are within $45^{\\rm o}$ of being orthogonal to the filament, and\nonly 28% are within $45^{\\rm o}$ of being parallel to the filament.\n  Conclusions: This suggests that the prestellar cores which spawned the YSOs\ndriving the observed outflows had angular momenta which were approximately\northogonal to the filaments out of which the cores formed.

Stars with\nearlier spectral type (B-V <= 0.2) are either variable or associated to levels\nof uncertainties comparable to the RV rms observed on variable stars of same\nB-V. 2) We have detected one long-period planetary system around an F6IV-V\nstar. 3) We have quantified the jitter due to stellar activity and we show that\ntaking into account this jitter in addition to the stellar parameters, it is\nstill possible to detect planets with HARPS with periods of 3 days (resp. 10\ndays and 100 days) on 91% (resp. 83%, 61%) of them. We show that even the\nearliest spectral type stars are accessible to this type of search, provided\nthey have a low vsini and low levels of activity. 4) Taking into account the\npresent data, we compute the actually achieved detection limits for 107 targets\nand discuss the limits as a function of B-V. Given the data at hand, our survey\nis sensitive to short-period (few days) planets and to longer ones (100 days)\nat a lower extent (latest type stars). We derive first constrains on the\npresence of planets around A-F stars for these ranges of periods. \n\n"}

The metallicity gradients are measured out to one effective radius by\ncomparing nearly all of the Lick absorption-line indices to recent models of\nsingle stellar populations. The relation shows very different behaviour at low\nand high masses, with a sharp transition being seen at a mass of ~ 3.5 x 10^10\nM_sun (velocity dispersion of ~140 km/s, M_B ~ -19). Low-mass galaxies form a\ntight relation with mass, such that metallicity gradients become shallower with\ndecreasing mass and positive at the very low-mass end. Above the mass\ntransition point several massive galaxies have steeper gradients, but a clear\ndownturn is visible marked by a broad scatter. The results are interpreted in\ncomparison with competing model predictions. We find that an early star-forming\ncollapse could have acted as the main mechanism for the formation of low-mass\ngalaxies, with star formation efficiency increasing with galactic mass. The\nhigh-mass downturn could be a consequence of merging and the observed larger\nscatter a natural result of different merger properties.

The varying efficiency of the dissipative merger-induced\nstarburst and feedback processes have shaped the radial metallicity gradients\nin these high-mass systems. \n\n"}

We review the flux from a single pulsar and\nderive the flux from a distribution of pulsars. We point out that the particle\nacceleration in the pulsar magnetosphere is insufficient to explain the\nobserved excess of electrons and positrons with energy E ~ 1 TeV and one has to\ntake into account an additional acceleration of electrons at the termination\nshock between the pulsar and its wind nebula.

We believe that the LSUB$m$\napproximation provides reasonable results for the correlation functions for\nlattice separations roughly of order $r \\approx m$ for the square lattice. We\ncompare qualitatively our results for the square lattice to those results of\nquantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and we see that good correspondence is observed.\nIndeed as seen by QMC, the spin-spin correlation function initially decays\nstrongly with $|r|$ before becoming constant for larger values of $|r|$.

Abstract: [abridged]\n  Context: Very few examples of luminous blue variable (LBV) stars or LBV\ncandidates (LBVc) are known, particularly at metallicities below the SMC. The\nLBV phase is crucial for the evolution of massive stars, and its behavior with\nmetallicity is poorly known. V39 in IC 1613 is a well-known photometric\nvariable, with B-band changes larger than 1mag. over its period. The star,\npreviously proposed to be a projection of a Galactic W Virginis and an IC 1613\nred supergiant, shows features that render it a possible LBVc.\n  Method: We investigate mid-resolution blue and red VLT-VIMOS spectra of V39,\ncovering a time span of 40 days, and perform a quantitative analysis of the\ncombined spectrum using the model atmosphere code CMFGEN.\n  Results: We identify strong Balmer and FeII P-Cygni profiles, and a hybrid\nspectrum resembling a B-A supergiant in the blue and a G-star in the red. No\nsignificant Vrad variations are detected, and the spectral changes are small\nover the photometric period. Our analysis places V39 in the low-luminosity part\nof the LBV and LBVc region, but it is also consistent with a sgB[e] star.\n  Conclusions: The radial velocity indicates that V39 belongs to IC 1613. The\nlack of Vrad changes and spectroscopic variations excludes binary scenarios.\nThe features observed are not consistent with a W Virginis star, and this\npossibility is also discarded. We propose that the star is a B-A LBVc or sgB[e]\nstar surrounded by a thick disk precessing around it.\n  If confirmed, V39 would be the lowest metallicity resolved LBV candidate\nknown to date. Alternatively, it could represent a new transient phase of\nmassive star evolution, an LBV impostor. \n\n"}

Over the past years, observational evidence\nfor both old and young stellar populations, as well as individual H II regions,\nhas demonstrated that the outer disk is an actively evolving part of a galaxy.\nTo provide constraints on the origin of the aforementioned H-alpha truncation\nand the relation of H-alpha emission in the outer disk to the underlying\nstellar population, we measure the shape of the outer H-alpha surface\nbrightness profile of 15 isolated, edge-on late-type disk galaxies using deep,\nlong-slit spectroscopy.

The stellar continuum and H-alpha surface\nbrightness both exhibit a break at ~0.7 R_25, but the H-alpha emission drops\nmore steeply than the stellar continuum beyond that break.

Thus, a heating\nmechanism needs to be added to the cooling models in order to obtain agreement\nbetween theory and observation. Aims: Several internal heating mechanisms could\nbe operating in neutron stars, such as magnetic field decay, dark matter\naccretion, crust cracking, superfluid vortex creep, and non-equilibrium\nreactions (\"rotochemical heating\"). We study these mechanisms in order to\nestablish which could be the dominant source of thermal emission from old\npulsars. Methods: We show by simple estimates that magnetic field decay, dark\nmatter accretion, and crust cracking mechanism are unlikely to have a\nsignificant effect on old neutron stars. The thermal evolution for the other\nmechanisms is computed using the code of Fern\\'andez and Reisenegger. Given the\ndependence of the heating mechanisms on the spin-down parameters, we study the\nthermal evolution for two types of pulsars: young, slowly rotating \"classical\"\npulsars and old, fast rotating millisecond pulsars. Results: We find that\nmagnetic field decay, dark matter accretion, and crust cracking do not produce\ndetectable heating of old pulsars. Rotochemical heating and vortex creep can be\nimportant both for classical pulsars and millisecond pulsars. More restrictive\nupper limits on the surface temperatures of classical pulsars could rule out\nvortex creep as the main source of thermal emission. Rotochemical heating in\nclassical pulsars is driven by the chemical imbalance built up during their\nearly spin-down, and therefore strongly sensitive to their initial rotation\nperiod. \n\n"}

Since the two operations\ndo not commute, KSB gives biased results. (2) KSB implicitly assumes that\ngalaxy ellipticities are small, while weak gravitational lensing assures only\nthat the change in ellipticity due to the shear is small.

The moving hotspots are sandwiched between two shocks. An\ninner-facing shock receives momentum and cosmic rays from the jet and creates\nadditional cosmic rays that form a radio lobe elongated along the jet axis. An\nouter-facing bow shock moves directly into the undisturbed group or cluster\ngas, creating a cocoon of shocked gas enclosing the radio lobe. We describe\ncomputations that follow the self-consistent dynamical evolution of the shocked\ncluster gas and the relativistic synchrotron-emitting gas inside the lobes.\nRelativistic and non-relativistic components exchange momentum by interacting\nwith small magnetic fields having dynamically negligible energy densities. The\nevolution of Cygnus A is governed almost entirely by cosmic ray energy flowing\nfrom the hotspots.

The evolutionary storyline of\ngalaxy groups is dominated by a quasi-continuous gentle injection with\nsub-Eddington outflows (with mechanical power and velocity around 1.e44 erg/s\nand 1.e4 km/s). The cold and hybrid accretion models present, in addition, very\nshort quiescence periods, followed by moderate outbursts (10 times the previous\nphase), which generate a series of 10-20 kpc size cavities with high density\ncontrast, temperatures similar to the ambient medium and cold rims.

The ground state energy of nuclear\nmatter $\\alpha$ clusters is the same as for nucleons, thus it is degenerate.

We make\nnumerical models of a Be star decretion disc in which the spin of the Be star\nis misaligned with the orbital axis of a neutron star companion. Tidal torques\nfrom the neutron star truncate the disc at a radius small enough that the\nneutron star orbit does not intersect the disc unless the eccentricity or\nmisalignment is very large. A magnetic torque from the Be star that is largest\nat the equator, where the rotation is fastest, is approximated by an inner\nboundary condition.

This increase is consistent with the factor of 25-50\nincrease in the specific star formation rates (SSFRs) of normal, star-forming\n(main-sequence) galaxies. Indeed, the average SSFRs of AGN hosts are only\nmarginally (20 per cent) lower than those of main-sequence galaxies, with this\nsmall deficit being due to a fraction of AGNs residing in quiescent (low-SSFR)\ngalaxies. We estimate 79+/-10 per cent of moderate AGNs are hosted in\nmain-sequence galaxies, 15+/-7 per cent in quiescent galaxies and <10 per cent\nin strongly starbursting galaxies. The fractions of all main sequence galaxies\nat z<2 experiencing a period of moderate nuclear activity is strongly dependent\non galaxy stellar mass (Mstars); rising from a few per cent at\nMstars~10^{10}Msun to >20 per cent at Mstars>10^{11}Msun. Our results indicate\nthat it is galaxy stellar mass that is most important in dictating whether a\ngalaxy hosts a moderate luminosity AGN. We argue that the majority of moderate\nnuclear activity is fuelled by internal mechanisms rather than violent mergers,\nsuggesting that disk instabilities could be an important AGN feeding mechanism. \n\n"}

Radial Motions and Applications to Dust Annealing Abstract: The origin of crystalline grains in comets and the outer regions of\nprotoplanetary disks remains a mystery. It has been suggested that such grains\nform via annealing of amorphous precursors in the hot, inner region of a\nprotoplanetary disk, where the temperatures needed for such transformations\nwere found, and were then transported outward by some dynamical means. Here we\ndevelop a means of tracking the paths that dust grains would have taken through\na diffusive protoplanetary disk and examine the types and ranges of\nenvironments that particles would have seen over a 10$^{6}$ year time period in\nthe dynamic disk. We then combine this model with three annealing laws to\nexamine how the dynamic evolution of amorphous grains would have led to their\nphysical restructuring and their delivery to various regions of the disk. It is\nfound that \"sibling particles\"-- those particles that reside at the same\nlocation at a given period of time--take a wide range of unique and independent\npaths through the disk to arrive there. While high temperatures can persist in\nthe disk for very long time periods, we find that those grains which are\ndelivered to the cold outer regions of the disk are largely annealed in the\nfirst few $\\times10^{5}$ yrs of disk history.

Evidence for AGN activity is seen in two\ninner bubbles at 0.6 kpc, filled with 5 GHz and 1.5 GHz radio plasma and\ncoincident with Halpha emission, and in a ghost bubble at 5.2 kpc west of NGC\n5846's nucleus.

We present the formalism of curvature perturbations in\nan inflationary system with a time-dependent Newton constant. As an example we\nconsider a toy model in which G undergoes a sudden change during inflation. By\nimposing the appropriate matching conditions the imprints of this sharp change\nin G on curvature perturbation power spectrum are studied. We show that if G\nincreases (decreases) during the transition the amplitude of curvature\nperturbations on large scales decreases (increases). In our model with a sudden\nchange in G a continuous sinusoidal modulations on curvature power spectrum is\ninduced.

Abstract: The fraction of compact active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that exhibit\ninterstellar scintillation (ISS) at radio wavelengths, as well as their\nscintillation amplitudes, have been found to decrease significantly for sources\nat redshifts z > 2. This can be attributed to an increase in the angular sizes\nof the \\muas-scale cores or a decrease in the flux densities of the compact\n\\muas cores relative to that of the mas-scale components with increasing\nredshift, possibly arising from (1) the space-time curvature of an expanding\nUniverse, (2) AGN evolution, (3) source selection biases, (4) scatter\nbroadening in the ionized intergalactic medium (IGM) and intervening galaxies,\nor (5) gravitational lensing. We examine the frequency scaling of this redshift\ndependence of ISS to determine its origin, using data from a dual-frequency\nsurvey of ISS of 128 sources at 0 < z < 4. We present a novel method of\nanalysis which accounts for selection effects in the source sample. We\ndetermine that the redshift dependence of ISS is partially linked to the\nsteepening of source spectral indices ({\\alpha}^8.4_4.9) with redshift, caused\neither by selection biases or AGN evolution, coupled with weaker ISS in the\n{\\alpha}^8.4_4.9 < -0.4 sources. Selecting only the -0.4 < {\\alpha}^8.4_4.9 <\n0.4 sources, we find that the redshift dependence of ISS is still significant,\nbut is not significantly steeper than the expected (1+z)^0.5 scaling of source\nangular sizes due to cosmological expansion for a brightness temperature and\nflux-limited sample of sources. We find no significant evidence for scatter\nbroadening in the IGM, ruling it out as the main cause of the redshift\ndependence of ISS. We obtain an upper limit to IGM scatter broadening of <\n110\\muas at 4.9 GHz with 99% confidence for all lines of sight, and as low as <\n8\\muas for sight-lines to the most compact, \\sim 10\\muas sources. \n\n"}

Extrapolating their spectrum to their plausible injection\nenergy from some shock, implies an enormous hidden energy for a spectrum of\nindex ~-2.

Nevertheless, it seems implausible that more than at the very best\n1/3 of the jet energy, goes into the required flux of energetic particles thus,\none would need to allow for the possibility that there is an energy problem,\nwhich we would like to address in this work. Sequences of consecutive oblique\nshock features, or conical shocks, have been theorized and eventually observed\nin many AGN jets.

These galaxies deviate\nsignificantly from the main scaling relations, with high SFR and low metal\ncontent for a given M*.

The thermonuclear explosion of\na white dwarf can explain their observed properties, but neither the progenitor\nsystems nor any stellar remnants have been conclusively identified.\nUnderluminous SN Ia have been proposed to originate from a so-called\ndouble-detonation of a white dwarf. After a critical amount of helium is\ndeposited on the surface through accretion from a close companion, the helium\nis ignited causing a detonation wave that triggers the explosion of the white\ndwarf itself. We have discovered both shallow transits and eclipses in the\ntight binary system CD-30 11223 composed of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf and a\nhot helium star, allowing us to determine its component masses and fundamental\nparameters.

The source has been observed by\nROSAT, Chandra, and XMM-Newton on several occasions, exhibiting as a highly\nvariable persistent source or a recurrent transient with a flux variation\nfactor of >100, a high duty cycle (at least ~70%), and a peak luminosity of Lx\n~ 2X10^{39} erg/s (0.2-10 keV, absorbed). In the brightest observation, the\nsource is similar to typical low-luminosity ULXs, with the spectrum showing a\nhigh-energy cutoff but harder than that from a standard accretion disk. There\nare also sporadical short dips, accompanied by spectral softening. In a fainter\nobservation with Lx ~ 3.6X10^{38} erg/s, the source appears softer and is\nprobably in the thermal state seen in Galactic black-hole X-ray binaries\n(BHBs). In an even fainter observation (Lx ~ 9X10^{37} erg/s), the spectrum is\nharder again, and the source might be in the steep-powerlaw state or the hard\nstate of BHBs. In this observation, the light curve might exhibit ~7 hr\n(quasi-)periodic large modulations over two cycles. The source also has a\npossible point-like optical counterpart from HST images. In terms of the colors\nand the luminosity, the counterpart is probably a G8 supergiant or a compact\nred globular cluster containing ~2X10^5 K dwarfs, with some possible weak UV\nexcess that might be ascribed to accretion activity.

Using a simple analytic\nmodel for the fluctuations predicted in simulations, we estimate the\nrate-of-formation and mass function of self-gravitating, rapidly-collapsing\nplanetesimal-mass bodies formed by this mechanism. The statistics of this\nprocess depend sensitively on the size/stopping time of the grains, disk\nsurface density, and turbulent Mach numbers. However, when it occurs, we\npredict that the resulting planetesimal mass function is broad and\nquasi-universal, with a slope dN/dM~1/M^(1-2), spanning a size/mass range\n~10-1e4 km (~1e-9-5.0 M_Earth). Collapse to planetesimal through super-Earth\nmasses is possible. The key condition is that grain density fluctuations reach\nlarge amplitudes on large scales, where gravitational instability proceeds most\neasily (collapse of small grains is strongly suppressed by turbulent\nvorticity). We show this leads to a new criterion for 'pebble-pile' formation\nin terms of the dimensionless particle stopping time (tau_stop > f(Q,Z,alpha)).\nIn a MMSN, this requires grains larger than a=(50,1,0.1)cm at r=(1,30,100)au.\nAt small radii, it would depend on the existence of large boulders. However,\nbecause density fluctuations depend super-exponentially on tau_stop (inversely\nproportional to disk surface density), lower-density disks are more unstable.\nIn fact, we predict that cm-sized grains at ~1au will form pebble piles in a\ndisk with ~10% the MMSN density, so planet formation at ~au may generically\noccur late, as disks are evaporating. We also predict that conditions become\nprogressively more favorable for pebble-pile formation around lower-mass,\ncooler stars. \n\n"}

Abstract: In $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, structure formation is halted shortly after dark\nenergy dominates the mass/energy budget of the Universe. A manifestation of\nthis effect is that in such a cosmology the turnaround radius has an upper\nbound. Recently, a new, local, test for the existence of dark energy in the\nform of a cosmological constant was proposed based on this turnaround bound.\nBefore designing an experiment that, through high-precision determination of\nmasses and turnaround radii, will challenge $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we have to\nanswer two important questions: first, when turnaround-scale structures are\npredicted to be close enough to their maximum size, so that a possible\nviolation of the bound may be observable. Second, which is the best mass scale\nto target for possible violations of the bound. Using the Press-Schechter\nformalism, we find that turnaround structures have in practice already stopped\nforming, and consequently, the turnaround radius of structures must be very\nclose to the maximum value today. We also find that the mass scale of $\\sim\n10^{13} M_\\odot$ characterizes turnaround structures that start to form in a\nstatistically important number density today. This mass scale also separates\nturnaround structures with different cosmological evolution: smaller structures\nare no longer readjusting their mass distribution inside the turnaround scale,\nthey asymptotically approach their ultimate abundance from higher values, and\nthey are common enough to have, at some epoch, experienced major mergers with\nstructures of comparable mass; larger structures exhibit the opposite behavior.\nWe call this mass scale the transitional mass scale and we argue that it is the\noptimal for the purpose outlined above. As a corollary result, we explain the\ndifferent accretion behavior of small and larger structures observed in already\nconducted numerical simulations. \n\n"}

Two-dimensional global disk simulations Abstract: Recent observations of gaps and non-axisymmetric features in the dust\ndistributions of transition disks have been interpreted as evidence of embedded\nmassive protoplanets. However, comparing the predictions of planet-disk\ninteraction models to the observed features has shown far from perfect\nagreement. This may be due to the strong approximations used for the\npredictions. For example, spiral arm fitting typically uses results that are\nbased on low-mass planets in an isothermal gas. In this work, we describe\ntwo-dimensional, global, hydrodynamical simulations of disks with embedded\nprotoplanets, with and without the assumption of local isothermality, for a\nrange of planet-to-star mass ratios 1-10 M_jup for a 1 M_sun star. We use the\nPencil Code in polar coordinates for our models. We find that the inner and\nouter spiral wakes of massive protoplanets (M>5 M_jup) produce significant\nshock heating that can trigger buoyant instabilities. These drive sustained\nturbulence throughout the disk when they occur. The strength of this effect\ndepends strongly on the mass of the planet and the thermal relaxation\ntimescale; for a 10 M_jup planet embedded in a thin, purely adiabatic disk, the\nspirals, gaps, and vortices typically associated with planet-disk interactions\nare disrupted. We find that the effect is only weakly dependent on the initial\nradial temperature profile. The spirals that form in disks heated by the\neffects we have described may fit the spiral structures observed in transition\ndisks better than the spirals predicted by linear isothermal theory. \n\n"}

We find that in our nominal disc model the\nemergence of planetary embryos preferably occurs after approximately 2 Myr in\norder to not exclusively form gas giants, but also ice giants and smaller\nplanets. The high pebble accretion rates ensure that critical core masses for\ngas accretion can be reached at all orbital distances. Gas giant planets\nnevertheless experience significant reduction in semi-major axes by migration.\nConsidering instead planetesimal accretion for planetary growth, we show that\nformation time-scales are too long to compete with the migration time-scales\nand the dissipation time of the protoplanetary disc. Altogether, we find that\npebble accretion overcomes many of the challenges in the formation of ice and\ngas giants in evolving protoplanetary discs. \n\n"}

In charged-lepton deep inelastic scattering (DIS),\nthey are studied by the twist-two structure functions $b_1$ and $b_2$. The\nHERMES collaboration found unexpectedly large $b_1$ values than a naive\ntheoretical expectation based on the standard deuteron model. The situation\nshould be significantly improved in the near future by an approved experiment\nto measure $b_1$ at JLab (Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility).\nThere is also an interesting indication in the HERMES result that finite\nantiquark tensor polarization exists.

There is evidence that a Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) was\ncreated at experiments at RHIC and LHC. The transition from the QGP back to the\nhadron gas is found to be a smooth cross over. For larger net-baryon densities\nand lower temperatures, it is expected that the QCD phase diagram exhibits a\nrich structure, such as a first-order phase transition between hadronic and\npartonic matter which terminates in a critical point, or exotic phases like\nquarkyonic matter. The discovery of these landmarks would be a breakthrough in\nour understanding of the strong interaction and is therefore in the focus of\nvarious high-energy heavy-ion research programs. The Compressed Baryonic Matter\n(CBM) experiment at FAIR will play a unique role in the exploration of the QCD\nphase diagram in the region of high net-baryon densities, because it is\ndesigned to run at unprecedented interaction rates.

To overcome these barriers,\nspatial concentration of cm-sized dust pebbles and subsequent gravitational\ncollapse have been proposed.

As the jet is fragmenting, it is expected to go\nthrough two different phases. First, there is QCD branching that is calculable\nin perturbative QCD. Next, the produced partons hadronize in a non-perturbative\nway later in a hadronization process. The jet fragmentation can be studied\nusing the method of two particle correlations. A useful observable is the jet\ntransverse fragmentation momentum $j_{\\mathrm{T}}$, which describes the angular\nwidth of the jet. In this contribution, a differential study will be presented\nin which separate $j_{\\mathrm{T}}$ components for branching and hadronization\nwill be distinguished from the data measured by the ALICE experiment. The\n$p_{\\mathrm{Tt}}$ dependence of the hadronization component\n$\\sqrt{\\left<j_{\\mathrm{T}}^{2}\\right>}$ is found to be rather flat, which is\nconsistent with universal hadronization assumption.

In the first, where the\ncooling time is greater than five times the dynamical time, magnetic fields\nreduce spiral density wave amplitudes, which in turn suppresses fragmentation.\nThis is the case even if the magnetic pressure is only a tenth of the thermal\npressure. The second regime occurs when the cooling time is sufficiently short\nthat magnetic fields cannot halt fragmentation.\n  We find that magnetised discs produce more massive fragments, due to both the\nadditional pressure exerted by the magnetic field, and the additional angular\nmomentum transport induced by Maxwell stresses. The fragments are confined to a\nnarrower range of initial semimajor axes than those in unmagnetised discs.

Instead, the star formation\nrate is limited because only a small fraction of star-forming gas is converted\ninto stars before star-forming regions are dispersed by feedback and dynamical\nprocesses. Thus, gas cycles into and out of star-forming state multiple times,\nwhich results in a long time scale on which galaxies convert gas into stars.\nOur model does not rely on the assumption of equilibrium and can be used to\ninterpret trends of depletion times with the properties of observed galaxies\nand the parameters of star formation and feedback recipes in simulations.

While there can\nbe at most three canonical boundary charges on an equal-time slice, we consider\nall Fourier modes of these charges with respect to the Euclidean boundary time\nand study their associated algebras. Besides the (centerless)\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ current algebra we find for stricter boundary conditions a\nVirasoro algebra, a warped conformal algebra and a $\\mathfrak{u}(1)$ current\nalgebra. In each of these cases we get one half of a corresponding symmetry\nalgebra in three-dimensional Einstein gravity with negative cosmological\nconstant and analogous boundary conditions. However, on-shell some of these\nalgebras reduce to finite-dimensional ones, reminiscent of the on-shell\nbreaking of conformal invariance in SYK. We conclude with a discussion of\nthermodynamical aspects, in particular the entropy and some Cardyology. \n\n"}

Around $p_T\\simeq 60$\nGeV/c, a regime change occurs, which is characteristic for the phenomenon.

The morphology of these \"TeV halos\" requires\ncosmic-ray diffusion to be locally suppressed by a factor of ~100-1000 compared\nto the typical interstellar medium. No model currently explains this\nsuppression. We show that cosmic-ray self-confinement can significantly inhibit\ndiffusion near pulsars. The steep cosmic-ray gradient generates Alfven waves\nthat resonantly scatter the same cosmic-ray population, suppressing diffusion\nwithin ~20 pc of pulsars younger than ~100 kyr. In this model, TeV halos evolve\nthrough two phases, a growth phase where Alfven waves are resonantly generated\nand cosmic-ray diffusion becomes increasingly suppressed, and a subsequent\nrelaxation phase where the diffusion coefficient returns to the standard\ninterstellar value. Intriguingly, cosmic-rays are not strongly confined early\nin the TeV halo evolution, allowing a significant fraction of injected e+e- to\nescape. If these e+e- also escape from the surrounding supernova remnant, they\nwould provide a natural explanation for the positron excess observed by PAMELA\nand AMS-02.

While our default model relaxes too\nrapidly to explain the confinement of TeV cosmic rays around mature pulsars,\nsuch as Geminga, models utilizing a Kraichnan turbulence spectrum experience\nmuch slower relaxation.

An expression for the PI condition is\nderived in terms of a few microscopic parameters in each angular momentum\nchannel corresponding to a central interaction between the helical electrons.\nIt is found that because of the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC)\nthe Landau parameter, $\\bar{F}_{l}$ corresponding to a particular angular\nmomentum channel $l$ depends not only on the electron-electron interaction in\nthe same channel but also interactions in $(l+1)$ and $(l-1)$ channels. The\nformalism automatically excludes the $l=1$ PI in the HFL where the Galilean\ninvariance is broken because of the presence of strong SOC. It is also found\nthat the competing PIs can only be avoided until the appearance of $l=2$ PI.

We find that the\nmagnetic fields are amplified through field line stretching at a rate\nproportional to the difference between the velocity and the magnetic field\nstrength times a constant. Equipartition between the kinetic and magnetic\nenergy densities occurs at a scale somewhat smaller than the kinetic energy\npeak. Above the equipartition scale the velocity structure is, as expected,\nnearly isotropic. The magnetic field structure at these scales is uncertain,\nbut the field correlation function is very weak. At the equipartition scale the\nmagnetic fields show only a moderate degree of anisotropy, so that the typical\nradius of curvature of field lines is comparable to the typical perpendicular\nscale for field reversal.

During the closely\nspaced RXTE observations beginning on 2000 July 28, an ending of one flare and\na start of another are visible, associated with spectral changes, where the\nphoton index Gamma ranges between ~ 1.4 and 1.7, and the spectrum is harder\nwhen the source is brighter.

The\ntiming diagrams are caused by the correlated properties of the pulses in the\nburst and can be explained by a combination of factors including the Doppler\nboost factor Gamma, a viewing effect caused by a jet and different progenitors.\nGRBs with similar values of T90 have a wide range in the number of pulses.

We identify 12 cosmological systems, and 6 systems\nthat are either ejected from the background QSO or affected by its local\nradiation field. Almost all of the intergalactic OVI is associated with strong\nLy-a absorption (N_HI > 10^15.2 cm^-2), as well as absorption from CIV and\noften lower ionization species. The absorbing regions are conservatively\nconstrained to have L<=200 kpc and rho/rho_bar >= 2.5, with actual values\nprobably closer to L ~ 60 kpc and rho/rho_bar ~ 10-30. They also have two\ndistinct gas phases: one which produces photoionized CIV and SiIV at T ~ 30,000\nK, and a second which is seen only in OVI. The OVI temperature is difficult to\nconstrain due to uncertainty in the amount of nonthermal line broadening, but\nit does appear that this gas is hotter than the CIV/SiIV phase and could\nsupport collisional OVI production. The OVI is strongly clustered on velocity\nscales of dv=100-300 km/s, with weaker signal extending to dv = 750 km/s.

We find that the spatial distribution of the local power of the\ntransmitted flux on scales k >= 0.05 s/km is highly spiky or intermittent. The\nprobability distribution functions (PDFs) of the local power are long-tailed.\nThe power on small scales is dominated by small probability events, and\nconsequently, the uncertainty in the power spectrum of the transmitted flux\nfield is generally large. This uncertainty arises due to the slow convergence\nof an intermittent field to a Gaussian limit required by the central limit\ntheorem (CLT). To reduce this uncertainty, it is common to estimate the error\nof the power spectrum by selecting subsamples with an \"optimal\" size. We show\nthat this conventional method actually does not calculate the variance of the\noriginal intermittent field but of a Gaussian field. Based on the analysis of\nintermittency, we propose an algorithm to calculate the error. It is based on a\nbootstrap re-sampling among all independent local power modes. This estimation\ndoesn't require any extra parameter like the size of the subsamples, and is\nsensitive to the intermittency of the fields. This method effectively reduces\nthe uncertainty in the power spectrum when the number of independent modes\nmatches the condition of the CLT convergence. \n\n"}

Their statistical properties, relationship\nto the power spectrum, and uses for investigating the nature of the variability\nprocesses are discussed. We demonstrate that sigma_XS^2 (or similarly F_var)\nshows large changes from one part of the light curve to the next, even when the\nvariability is produced by a stationary process. This limits the usefulness of\nthese estimators for quantifying differences in variability amplitude between\ndifferent sources or from epoch to epoch in one source.

The excess variance can be\nuseful for comparing the variability amplitudes of light curves in different\nenergy bands from the same observation.

In the\nFundamental Plane, E+As stand apart from the E/S0s mainly due to their high\neffective surface brightness. Fading of the young stellar population and the\ncorresponding increase in their effective radii will cause these galaxies to\nmigrate toward the locus of E/S0s.

In order to examine to what extent the simulated MHD flows can account\nfor the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*),\nfor the first time we calculate the emergent spectra from 3D MHD flows in a\nwide range of wavelengths (from radio to X-ray) by solving the 3D radiative\ntransfer equations. We use the simulation data by Kato, Mineshige, and Shibata\n(2004) and perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, in which\nsynchrotron emission/absorption, free-free emission/absorption, and\nCompton/inverse Compton scattering are taken into account. We assume two\ntemperature plasmas and calculate electron temperatures by solving the electron\nenergy equation. Only thermal electrons are considered. It is found that the 3D\nMHD flow generally over-produces X-rays by means of bremsstrahlung radiation\nfrom the regions at large radii. A flatter density profile, r^{-a} with a<1,\nthan that of the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF), r^{-3/2}, is the\nmain reason for this.

If it is assumed that both the optical and X-ray afterglows\narise from the same outflow then, in the framework of the standard forward\nshock model, the chromaticity of the X-ray light-curve breaks indicates that\nthey do not arise solely from a mechanism related to the outflow dynamics (e.g.\nenergy injection) or the angular distribution of the blast-wave kinetic energy\n(structured outflows or jets). The lack of a spectral evolution accompanying\nthe X-ray light-curve breaks shows that these breaks do not arise from the\npassage of a spectral break (e.g. the cooling frequency) either.

Our\nsimulations consistently describe the formation of the structure and its\nchemical enrichment within a cosmological context. Our results indicate that\nthe luminosity-metallicity (LZR) and the stellar mass-metallicity (MZR)\nrelations are naturally generated in a hierarchical scenario. Both relations\nare found to evolve with redshift. In the case of the MZR, the estimated\nevolution is weaker than that deduced from observational works by approximately\n0.10 dex. We also determine a characteristic stellar mass, $M_c \\approx 3\n\\times 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$, which segregates the simulated galaxy population\ninto two distinctive groups and which remains unchanged since $z\\sim 3$, with a\nvery weak evolution of its metallicity content. The value and role played by\n$M_c$ is consistent with the characteristic mass estimated from the SDSS galaxy\nsurvey by Kauffmann et al. (2004).

The Be star system DW\n  Carinae, a member of the open cluster Collinder 228 Abstract: DW Carinae is a close but detached early B-type eclipsing binary in the young\nopen cluster Cr 228. We have measured accurate physical properties of its\ncomponents (masses and radii to 1%) and used these to derive the age,\nmetallicity and distance of Cr 228. The rotational velocities of both\ncomponents of DW Car are high, so we have investigated the performance of\ndouble-Gaussian fitting, one- and two-dimensional cross-correlation and\nspectral disentangling for measuring radial velocities in the presence of\nstrong line blending. Gaussian and cross-correlation analyses require\nsubstantial corrections for the effects of line blending, which are only\npartially successful for cross-correlation. Disentangling is to be preferred\nbecause it does not assume anything about the shapes of spectral lines, and is\nnot significantly affected by blending. Complete Stromgren uvby light curves\nhave been obtained and accurate radii have been measured from them using the\nWilson-Devinney program, constrained by an accurate spectroscopic light ratio.\nThe Teffs and reddening have been found from Stromgren photometric\ncalibrations.

In general, all the fossils\nwe study show regular and symmetric X-ray emission, indicating an absence of\nrecent major group mergers. We confirm that, for a given optical luminosity of\nthe group, fossils are more X-ray luminous than non-fossil groups. Fossils,\nhowever, fall comfortably on the conventional L_X-T_X relation of galaxy groups\nand clusters, suggesting that their X-ray luminosity and their gas temperature\nare both boosted, arguably, as a result of their early formation. This is\nsupported by other scaling relations including the L_X-sigma and T_X-sigma\nrelations in which fossils show higher X-ray luminosity and temperature for a\ngiven group velocity dispersion. We find that mass concentration in fossils is\nhigher than in non-fossil groups and clusters.

We show that\nthe mass-to-light ratio in fossils is rather high but not exceptional, compared\nto galaxy groups and clusters.

The two\ndimensional description only requires one discrete degree of freedom per Planck\narea and yet it is rich enough to describe all three dimensional phenomena.\nAfter outlining 't Hooft's proposal I give a preliminary informal description\nof how it may be implemented. One finds a basic requirement that particles must\ngrow in size as their momenta are increased far above the Planck scale. The\nconsequences for high energy particle collisions are described. The phenomena\nof particle growth with momentum was previously discussed in the context of\nstring theory and was related to information spreading near black hole\nhorizons. The considerations of this paper indicate that the effect is much\nmore rapid at all but the earliest times. In fact the rate of spreading is\nfound to saturate the bound from causality. Finally we consider string theory\nas a possible realization of 't Hooft's idea. The light front lattice string\nmodel of Klebanov and Susskind is reviewed and its similarities with the\nholographic theory are demonstrated. The agreement between the two requires\nunproven but plausible assumptions about the nonperturbative behavior of string\ntheory. Very similar ideas to those in this paper have been long held by\nCharles Thorn. \n\n"}

This is shown by taking some branes in the full M/string\ntheory and then taking a low energy limit where the field theory on the brane\ndecouples from the bulk. We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the\nnear horizon geometry for large $N$.
