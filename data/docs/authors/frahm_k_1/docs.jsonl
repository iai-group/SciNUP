The theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking however, is\ninherently an equilibrium theory, which does not address the dynamics of\nquantum systems in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we will use the example of a\nparticular antiferromagnetic model system to show that the presence of a\nso-called thin spectrum of collective excitations with vanishing energy -one of\nthe well-known characteristic properties shared by all symmetry-breaking\nobjects- can allow these objects to also spontaneously break time-translation\nsymmetry in the thermodynamic limit. As a result, that limit is found to be\nable, not only to reduce quantum mechanical equilibrium averages to their\nclassical counterparts, but also to turn individual-state quantum dynamics into\nclassical physics. In the process, we find that the dynamical description of\nspontaneous symmetry breaking can also be used to shed some light on the\npossible origins of Born's rule.

Current researchers have\nproposed several measures or algorithms, such as betweenness, PageRank and HITS\netc., to identify the node importance. However, these measures are based on\ndifferent aspects of properties of nodes, and often conflict with the others. A\nreasonable, fair standard is needed for evaluating and comparing these\nalgorithms. This paper develops a framework as the standard for ranking the\nimportance of nodes. Four intuitive rules are suggested to measure the node\nimportance, and the equivalence classes approach is employed to resolve the\nconflicts and aggregate the results of the rules. To quantitatively compare the\nalgorithms, the performance indicators are also proposed based on a similarity\nmeasure. Three widely used real-world networks are used as the test-beds. The\nexperimental results illustrate the feasibility of this framework and show that\nboth algorithms, PageRank and HITS, perform well with bias when dealing with\nthe tested networks.

Here we determine the dynamics of a crystalline tunnelling defect\nstrongly coupled to phonons incorporating the full 3D geometry in our\ndescription.

QC in NSs causes a blue shift of the gap\nenergy with decreasing NS dimension. Directly measuring the effect of QC is\ncomplicated by additional parameters, such as stress, interface and defect\nstates. In addition, differences in NS preparation lead to differences in the\nrelevant parameter set. A relatively simple model of QC, using a\n`particle-in-a-box'-type perturbation to the effective mass theory, was applied\nto Si and Ge quantum wells, wires and dots across a variety of preparation\nmethods. The choice of the model was made in order to distinguish contributions\nthat are solely due to the effects of QC, where the only varied experimental\nparameter was the crystallinity. It was found that the hole becomes\nde-localized in the case of amorphous materials, which leads to stronger\nconfinement effects. The origin of this result was partly attributed to\ndifferences in the effective mass between the amorphous and crystalline NS as\nwell as between the electron and hole.

Familiar formalism, experimental designs, and analysis\nmethods assume the absence of these interactions, and result in biased\nestimators of causal effects of interest. While some assumptions can lead to\nunbiased estimators, these assumptions are generally unrealistic, and we focus\nthis work on realistic assumptions. Thus, in this work, we evaluate methods for\ndesigning and analyzing randomized experiments that aim to reduce this bias and\nthereby reduce overall error. In design, we consider the ability to perform\nrandom assignment to treatments that is correlated in the network, such as\nthrough graph cluster randomization. In analysis, we consider incorporating\ninformation about the treatment assignment of network neighbors. We prove\nsufficient conditions for bias reduction through both design and analysis in\nthe presence of potentially global interference. Through simulations of the\nentire process of experimentation in networks, we measure the performance of\nthese methods under varied network structure and varied social behaviors,\nfinding substantial bias and error reductions.

Over time it became clear\nthat quality of life not only depends on one, but on three relatively different\nparameters: social, economic and well-being measures. In this study we focus\nonly on the first two, since the last one is often very subjective and\nconsequently hard to measure.

The unitary operator implementing\nthis transformation can be formulated as a sequence of one-qubit and two-qubit\nelementary quantum gates and is thus the exponential of an ordered quantum\nIsing model with sequential operations and with pattern-dependent interactions,\nexactly as in the classical case. Probabilistic quantum memories, that make use\nof postselection of the measurement result of control qubits, overcome the\nfamed linear storage limitation of their classical counterparts because they\npermit to completely {\\it eliminate crosstalk and spurious memories}.

Speed of spread means the number of readers\nthat the news has reached in a given time, while width of spread means how far\nthe story has travelled from the news originator within the social network.\nAfter analyzing six stories in a 30-hour time span, we found out that the\nlifetime of a story's popularity among the members of the social network has\nthree phases: Expansion, Front-page, and Saturation. Expansion phase starts\nwhen a story is published and the article spreads from a source node to nodes\nwithin a connected component of the social network.

This theory includes the peculiar Fermi arc states on the surface as\nwell as leakage of the states from the surface to the bulk. Subjecting the\nmodel to a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface results in quantum\noscillations. The oscillations are different from the usual ones since they do\nnot involve a closed Fermi surface cross section. It has been shown previously\nthat the Quantum oscillations can be understood semiclassically as resulting\nfrom motion of electrons on the surface Fermi arcs as well as tunneling through\nchiral Landau levels associated with the bulk. In this work we develop an\neffective surface theory and use it to analyze the quantum oscillation in the\nsemiclassical regime and beyond. Specifically, we show that when a pair of Weyl\npoints are close to each other the surface quantum oscillations acquire a phase\noffset which originates from the bulk. While the surface states are responsible\nfor a large part of the electron motion, tunneling through the bulk is\nnecessary for completing the orbit. This tunneling makes use of the bulk, zero\nenergy, chiral Landau level in each Weyl node. When the nodes are close in\nmomentum space their chiral levels overlap and a gap at zero energy is formed.\nThis gap causes the phase offset in the surface quantum oscillations. \n\n"}

We adopt a\nquantum-trajectory approach to investigate open quantum systems under feedback\ncontrol. In these systems, the measurement backaction in the forward process\nplays a key role, and therefore the corresponding time-reversed quantum\nmeasurement and post-selection must be considered in the backward process in\nsharp contrast to the classical case. The state reduction associated with\nquantum measurement, in general, creates a zero-probability region in the space\nof quantum trajectories of the forward process, which causes singularly strong\nirreversibility with divergent entropy production (i.e., absolute\nirreversibility) and hence makes the ordinary fluctuation theorem break down.\nIn the classical case, the error-free measurement ordinarily leads to absolute\nirreversibility because the measurement restricts classical paths to the region\ncompatible with the measurement outcome. In contrast, in open quantum systems,\nabsolute irreversibility is suppressed even in the presence of the projective\nmeasurement due to those quantum rare events that go through the classically\nforbidden region with the aid of quantum coherent driving. This suppression of\nabsolute irreversibility exemplifies the thermodynamic advantage of quantum\ncoherent driving.

Recently, we have witnessed breakthroughs in both\ndirections of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital\napplication in providing speed-ups in ML, critical in our \"big data\" world.\nConversely, ML already permeates cutting-edge technologies, and may become\ninstrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in\ndata analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments,\nquantum enhancements have also been demonstrated for interactive learning,\nhighlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works\nexploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments, and for\nperforming parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first\nsuccesses. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement, researchers have also\nbroached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of ML/AI concepts.\nThis deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a\nworld that is described by quantum mechanics.

Based on the calculation of\nthe localization length and the Hall conductivity, we present rich phase\ndiagrams due to the interplay of intra- and interorbital disorders. We find\nthat the WSM with well-separated Weyl nodes is stable to both weak intra- and\ninterorbital disorders. However, weak intraorbital disorder can gap out a WSM\nclose to the 3D QAHI phase in the clean phase diagram, forming a 3D QAHI, and\nit can also drive a NI near the WSM phase to a WSM.

K{\\'o}nya, et al.\n  In a recent paper [2], we have shown that the Power-Zienau-Woolley\nHamiltonian does not derived from the minimal-coupling hamiltonian with the\nhelp of a gauge transformation. This result has been challenged by G.\nK{\\'o}nya, al. in a comment 1 where the authors claim the equivalence between\nthe Power-Zienau-Woolley hamiltonian and the minimal-coupling hamiltonian in\nthe Poincar{\\'e} gauge. They claim that we have made one error and one wrong\nemphasis in our paper: The error as summarized by G. K{\\'o}nya al. would be:\n\"The canonical field momentum is not gauge invariant. Equivalent\ntransformations of the Lagrangian do change the momentum. In field theories,\ngauge transformations are special cases of such transformations. The electric\nfield E is gauge invariant, but its capacity of being the canonical momentum is\nnot. \" The wrong emphasis as summarized by G.K{\\'o}nya al. would be: \"The use\nof the canonical coordinate/momentum pair A p and E in Poincar{\\'e} gauge is\npresented as mandatory in Rousseau and Felbacq paper, whereas as there is a\ncertain freedom of choice in selecting this pair. Also in Poincar{\\'e} gauge it\nis possible to use A c as canonical coordinate, in which case the conjugate\nmomentum will be D. This is the most convenient choice in terms of the set of\nnontrivial Dirac brackets. Cf. Table 1 in G. K{\\'o}nya al. paper 1 for possible\nchoices.\"\n  We do not share these conclusions and show in this reply that these\nstatements are incorrect. Specifically, we show that under a gauge\ntransformation, the canonical momentum $\\pi$(x,t) conjugated to the vector\npotential A(x,t) is given by $\\pi$(x,t) = --$\\epsilon$\\_0 E(x,t). This happens\nbecause the Lagrangian does not contains terms proportional to $\\partial$\\_t\n$\\phi$ (x,t) where $\\phi$ (x,t) is the scalar potential.

Trace formulas establish links between the energy spectra\nof the quantum description and the spectrum of actions of periodic orbits in\nthe classical description. This duality is investigated in the present paper.\nThe duality holds for chaotic as well as for integrable systems. For billiards\nthe quantal spectrum (eigenvalues of the Helmholtz equation) and the classical\nspectrum (lengths of periodic orbits) are two manifestations of the billiard's\nboundary. The trace formula expresses this link as a Fourier transform relation\nbetween the corresponding spectral densities. It follows that the two-point\nstatistics are also simply related. The universal correlations of the quantal\nspectrum are well known, consequently one can deduce the classical universal\ncorrelations. An explicit expression for the scale of the classical\ncorrelations is derived and interpreted. This allows a further extension of the\nformalism to the case of complex billiard systems, and in particular to the\nmost interesting case of diffusive system.

The cuprates seems to exhibit statistics,\ndimensionality and phase transitions in novel ways. The nature of excitations\n[i.e. quasiparticle or collective] must be understood. The Hubbard model\ncaptures some of the behaviour of the phase transitions in these materials. On\nthe other hand the phases such as stripes in these materials bear relationship\nto quantum group or string-like solutions.

In a small grain with\nquantized electron states, referred to as a quantum dot, the magnitude of the\nconductance peak is directly related to the magnitude of the wavefunction near\nthe contacts to the dot. Since dots are generally irregular in shape, the\ndynamics of the electrons is chaotic, and the characteristics of Coulomb\nblockade peaks reflects those of wavefunctions in chaotic systems. Previously,\na statistical theory for the peaks was derived by assuming these wavefunctions\nto be completely random.

The Wall formula for the calculation of friction in\nnuclear physics and the Drude formula for the calculation of conductivity in\nmesoscopic physics can be regarded as two special results of the general\nformulation. We assume a time-dependent Hamiltonian $H(Q,P;x(t))$ with\n$x(t)=Vt$, where $V$ is slow in a classical sense. The rate-of-change $V$ is\nnot necessarily slow in the quantum-mechanical sense. Dissipation means an\nirreversible systematic growth of the (average) energy. It is associated with\nthe stochastic spreading of energy across levels. The latter can be\ncharacterized by a transition probability kernel $P_t(n|m)$ where $n$ and $m$\nare level indices. This kernel is the main object of the present study. In the\nclassical limit, due to the (assumed) chaotic nature of the dynamics, the\nsecond moment of $P_t(n|m)$ exhibits a crossover from ballistic to diffusive\nbehavior. We define the $V$ regimes where either perturbation theory or\nsemiclassical considerations are applicable in order to establish this\ncrossover in the quantal case. In the limit $\\hbar\\to 0$ perturbation theory\ndoes not apply but semiclassical considerations can be used in order to argue\nthat there is detailed correspondence, during the crossover time.

In spite of this lack of (detailed) correspondence there may be\nstill a restricted correspondence as far as the second-moment is concerned.\nSuch restricted correspondence is essential in order to establish the universal\nfluctuation-dissipation relation. \n\n"}

A systematic diagram technique\nis developed for perturbation study of the current in physical systems out of\nequilibrium governed by time - dependent Hamiltonians of the Anderson and the\nKondo models. The ensuing calculations prove to be too complicated for the\nAnderson model, and hence, a mapping on an effective Kondo problem is called\nfor. This is achieved by constructing a time - dependent version of the\nSchrieffer - Wolff transformation. Perturbation expansion of the current is\nthen carried out up to third order in the Kondo coupling J yielding a set of\nremarkably simple analytical expressions for the current.

When only two maps are considered we always find that the\ncritical coupling $\\epsilon_l$ for chaotic synchronization can be predicted\nwithin a linear analysis by the vanishing of the transverse Lyapunov exponent\n$\\lambda_T$. However, major differences between transitions driven by linear or\nnonlinear mechanisms are revealed by the dynamics of the transient toward the\nsynchronized state. As a representative example of extended systems a one\ndimensional lattice of chaotic maps with power-law coupling is considered. In\nthis high dimensional model finite amplitude instabilities may have a dramatic\neffect on the transition.
