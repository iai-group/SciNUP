The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S}$\ndecay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective\n$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct\nCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the\nlatter. (iii) For $B\\to K\\pi\\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonant\ncontributions in $K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\bar K^0\\pi^+\\pi^-$ modes, in agreement\nwith the Belle measurements but larger than the BaBar result. \n\n"}

Unlike the often studied Z' cases, in this framework, there are\nthree neutral gauge bosons due to the underlying SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_X\ngauge group in the bulk. Furthermore, couplings of these KK states to light\nquarks and leptons are suppressed, whereas those to top and bottom quarks are\nenhanced compared to the SM gauge couplings. Therefore, the production of light\nquark and lepton states is suppressed relative to other beyond the SM\nconstructions, and the fermionic decays of these states are dominated by the\ntop and bottom quarks, which are, though, overwhelmed by KK gluons dominantly\ndecaying into them.

For instance, in SUSY models where the\ngravitino is lighter than the LOSP, the LOSP decays to its superpartner and a\nlongitudinal gravitino via supercurrent couplings. In this paper, we show that\nLOSP decays can be substantially modified when there are multiple sectors that\nbreak supersymmetry, where in addition to the gravitino there are light uneaten\ngoldstini. As a particularly striking example, a bino-like LOSP can have a near\n100% branching fraction to a higgs boson and an uneaten goldstino, even if the\nLOSP has negligible higgsino fraction. This occurs because the uneaten\ngoldstino is unconstrained by the supercurrent, allowing additional operators\nto mediate LOSP decay.

Large part of interesting electroweak processes include production of\nneutrinos, while many new physics scenarios predict the existence of similarly\nweakly-interacting particles. In events with associated production of invisible\nparticles and hadronic jets, the measurement of the imbalance in transverse\nmomentum of the final state particles is the major leverage to reject the\notherwise dominant source of backgrounds in hadron colliders, i.e. the generic\nproduction of many jets by QCD interactions. Here we discuss a novel technique\nwhich utilizes the information derived from the spectrometer, eventually\ncoupled with the more straightforward calorimeter information, to infer the\npassage of invisible particles. We check the validity of this technique in data\nand Monte Carlo simulations in a broad range of topologies, starting from the\nsimplest, with two jets in the final state, to the ones with very large jet\nmultiplicities. We also suggest a new way, based on the same approach, to\nmeasure the yields and model the kinematics of the QCD multijet background in\ninvisible particles plus jets signatures.

This raises the\nquestion of whether there are interesting deca-TeV models for which the LHC may\nfind direct clues. A possible scenario for such physics is a 5D warped model of\nfermion masses and mixing, with Kaluza-Klein masses m_KK ~ 10 TeV, allowing it\nto avoid tension with stringent constraints, especially from flavor data.\nDiscovery of a Standard-Model-like Higgs boson, for which there are some hints\nat ~125 GeV at the LHC, would also require the KK masses to be at or above 10\nTeV. These warped models generically predict the appearance of a much lighter\nradion scalar. We find that, in viable warped models of flavor, a radion with a\nmass of a few hundred GeV and an inverse coupling of order m_KK ~ 10 TeV could\ntypically be accessible to the LHC experiments -- with sqrt(s) = 14 TeV and 100\nfb^-1 of data.

However, the SM fails to explain the non-visible but\ngravitationally active part of the universe. Its nature is unknown but the\nconfirmation of a scalar Higgs is giving a boost to scalar-field-theories. So\nfar gravity experiments and observations performed at different distances find\nno deviation from Newton's gravity law. Therefore dark energy must possess a\nscreening mechanism which suppresses the scalar-mediated fifth force. Our line\nof attack is a novel gravity experiment with neutrons based on a quantum\ninterference technique. The spectroscopic measurement of quantum states on\nresonances with an external coupling makes this a powerful search for dark\nmatter and dark energy contributions in the universe. Quantum states in the\ngravity potential are intimately related to other scalar field or spin-0-bosons\nif they exist.

We discuss the idea of using the\nMAC-E-Filter in a time-of-flight mode (MAC-E-TOF) in which the neutrino mass is\ndetermined by a measurement of the electron time-of-flight (TOF) spectrum that\ndepends on the neutrino mass. MAC-E-TOF spectroscopy here is a very sensitive\nmethod since the $\\beta$-electrons are slowed down to distinguishable\nvelocities by the MAC-E-Filter. Their velocity depends strongly on their\nsurplus energy above the electric retarding potential. Using MAC-E-TOF, a\nstatistical sensitivity gain is expected. Because a small number of\nretarding-potential settings is sufficient for a complete measurement, in\ncontrast to about 40 different retarding potentials used in the standard\nMAC-E-Filter mode, there is a gain in measurement time and hence statistical\npower. The improvement of the statistical uncertainty of the squared neutrino\nmass has been determined by Monte Carlo simulation to be a factor 5 for an\nideal case neglecting background and timing uncertainty. Additionally, two\nscenarios to determine the time-of-flight of the $\\beta$-electrons are\ndiscussed, which use the KATRIN detector for creating the stop signal and\ndifferent methods for obtaining a start signal.

One usually think that it is extremely\nimportant for the measurement of triple Higgs coupling at the high luminosity\nLHC. In this paper, we propose to search for the extra Higgs boson (denoted as\n$S$) utilizing pair production of the SM-like Higgs boson ($H$) which was\ndiscovered in July, 2012.The pair production of $H$ can be huge due to the\nresonant production of heavy scalar $S$, namely $PP \\rightarrow S \\rightarrow\nHH$. The couplings of $H$ with weak gauge boson are similar to ones in the SM\nand it implies that the couplings between $S$ and gauge bosons are likely\nsuppressed. Provided that $S$ is heavy enough, the decay into weak gauge bosons\nmay not be the dominant modes. Instead $S$ can decay into a pair of $H$ and\noffer the promising channel to discover it. In this paper, we studied the 5\npromising decay modes of $H$, i.e. $b\\bar{b}$, $WW^*$, $ZZ^*$, $\\gamma\\gamma$\nand $\\tau^+\\tau^-$, and simulated the signals and backgrounds for the 15\ncombination modes for $HH$ at the LHC with $\\sqrt{s}= 14$ TeV and integrated\nluminosity $\\mathcal{L}=1000fb^{-1}$.

Even if these particles are too massive\nto be produced on-shell at the LHC, it may be possible to see evidence of their\nexistence through the use of integral dispersion relations (IDRs). Making use\nof Cauchy's integral formula and the analyticity of the scattering amplitude,\nIDRs are sensitive in principle to changes in the cross section at arbitrarily\nlarge energies. We investigate some models of new physics. We find that a\nsudden, order one increase in the cross section above new particle mass\nthresholds can be inferred well below the threshold energy. On the other hand,\nfor two more physical models of particle production, we show that the reach in\nenergy and the signal strength of the IDR technique is greatly reduced. The\npeak sensitivity for the IDR technique is shown to occur when the new particle\nmasses are near the machine energy, an energy where direct production of new\nparticles is kinematically disallowed, phase-space suppressed, or if\napplicable, suppressed by the soft parton distribution functions. Thus, IDRs do\nextend the reach of the LHC, but only to a window around $M_\\chi\\sim\n\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm LHC}}}$. \n\n"}

First of all, I discuss why jet production\nis directly sensitive to the gluon and quark PDFs at large-x, and then review\nthe state-of-the-art perturbative calculations for jet production at hadron\ncolliders and the corresponding fast calculations required for PDF fitting.\nThen I present the results of various recent studies on the impact on PDFs, in\nparticular the gluon, that have been performed using as input jet measurements\nfrom ATLAS and CMS. I also review the available determinations of the strong\ncoupling constant based on ATLAS and CMS jet data, with emphasis on the fact\nthat LHC jet data provides, for the first time, a direct test of the\n$\\alpha_s(Q)$ running at the TeV scale.

Motivated by these\nintriguing hints of new physics, several authors have considered vector, axial\nvector, scalar and pseudo scalar operators as possible explanations of these\nmeasurements. However, tensor operators have widely been neglected in this\ncontext. In this paper, we consider the effect of tensor operators in $R_K$ and\n$R_{K^*}$.

Assuming that these\nanomalies have a new physics origin, we consider the possibility that a $Z'$\nboson is responsible for them.

Most of\nthese decays are not yet observed, and their rates are expected to be\nrelatively small in the SM.

A superfluid helium target has\nseveral advantageous properties, including a light nuclear mass for better\nkinematic matching with light dark matter particles, copious production of\nscintillation light, extremely good intrinsic radiopurity, a high impedance to\nexternal vibration noise, and a unique mechanism for observing phonon-like\nmodes via liberation of $^4$He atoms into a vacuum (`quantum evaporation'). In\nthis concept, both scintillation photons and triplet excimers are detected\nusing calorimeters, including calorimeters immersed in the superfluid. Kinetic\nexcitations of the superfluid medium (rotons and phonons) are detected using\nquantum evaporation and subsequent atomic adsorption onto a microcalorimeter\nsuspended in vacuum above the target helium. The energy of adsorption amplifies\nthe phonon/roton signal before calorimetric sensing, producing a gain mechanism\nthat can reduce the techonology's recoil energy threshold below the calorimeter\nenergy threshold. We describe signal production and signal sensing\nprobabilities, and estimate electron recoil discrimination. We then simulate\nradioactive backgrounds from gamma rays and neutrons.

The assumption made at the Tevatron is that the spectator parton\ninteraction energy is similar to the ambient level measured in minimum bias\nevents. In this paper, we test this assumption by measuring the ambient charged\ntrack momentum in events containing large transverse energy jets at\n$\\sqrt{s}=1800$ GeV and $\\sqrt{s}=630$ GeV and comparing this ambient momentum\nwith that observed both in minimum bias events and with that predicted by two\nMonte Carlo models.

In this paper we investigate four aspects related to the application\nof the model to $pp$ and $\\bar{p}p$ scattering, from accelerator to cosmic-ray\nenergies: 1) the effect of different estimations for $\\sigma_{tot}$ from\ncosmic-ray experiments; 2) the differences between individual and global\n(simultaneous) fits to $\\sigma_{tot}$ and $\\rho$; 3) the role of the\nsubtraction constant in the dispersion relations; 4) the effect of distinct\nasymptotic inputs from different analytic models.

Our focus is on the case where a neutralino (N1) is the\nnext-to-lightest SUSY particle (NLSP), for which we determine the relevant\nregions of the GMSB parameter space. Many observables are calculated and\ndiscussed, including production cross sections, NLSP decay widths, branching\nratios and distributions, for dominant and rare channels.
