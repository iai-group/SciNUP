Significant reduction in\nsystematic uncertainty of the measurement due to non-flow effects has been\nachieved by correlating particles at midrapidity, $|\\eta|<1.0$, with those at\nforward rapidity, $2.5<|\\eta|<4.0$. We also present azimuthal correlations in\np+p collisions at 200 GeV to help estimating non-flow effects. To study the\nsystem-size dependence of elliptic flow, we present a detailed comparison with\npreviously published results from Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. We observe that\n$v_{2}$($p_{T}$) of strange hadrons has similar scaling properties as were\nfirst observed in Au+Au collisions, i.e.: (i) at low transverse momenta,\n$p_T<2GeV/c$, $v_{2}$ scales with transverse kinetic energy, $m_{T}-m$, and\n(ii) at intermediate $p_T$, $2<p_T<4GeV/c$, it scales with the number of\nconstituent quarks, $n_q$. We have found that ideal hydrodynamic calculations\nfail to reproduce the centrality dependence of $v_{2}$($p_{T}$) for $K_{S}^{0}$\nand $\\Lambda$. Eccentricity scaled $v_2$ values, $v_{2}/\\epsilon$, are larger\nin more central collisions, suggesting stronger collective flow develops in\nmore central collisions. The comparison with Au+Au collisions which go further\nin density shows $v_{2}/\\epsilon$ depend on the system size, number of\nparticipants $N_{part}$. This indicates that the ideal hydrodynamic limit is\nnot reached in Cu+Cu collisions, presumably because the assumption of\nthermalization is not attained. \n\n"}

The nominal depletion\nvoltage being 3000V, the detector under investigation shows a peculiar behavior\nfor biases around 2000V: in a narrow range of about 100V the charge collection\nis strongly reduced. The detector seems to be composed by two parts: a small\nvolume around the HV contact where charges are efficiently collected as at\nhigher voltage, and a large volume where charges are poorly collected. A\nqualitative explanation of this behavior is presented. An event-by-event pulse\nshape analysis based on A/E (maximum amplitude of the current pulse over the\ntotal energy released in the detector) has been applied to events in different\nenergy regions and found very effective in rejecting non localized events. In\nconclusion, BEGe detectors are excellent candidates for the second phase of\nGERDA, an experiment devoted to neutrinoless double beta decay of Ge-76. \n\n"}

We found that the background\nspectrum near the region of interest for Dark Matter detection in the DEAP-1\ndetector can be described considering events from three sources: radon\ndaughters decaying on the surface of the active volume, the expected rate of\nelectromagnetic events misidentified as nuclear recoils due to inefficiencies\nin the pulse shape discrimination, and leakage of events from outside the\nfiducial volume due to imperfect position reconstruction. These backgrounds\nstatistically account for all observed events, and they will be strongly\nreduced in the DEAP-3600 detector due to its higher light yield and simpler\ngeometry. \n\n"}

To better constrain predictions of\nyields from these phenomena, we have performed a sensitivity study by\npost-processing thermodynamic histories from two different hydrodynamic,\nChandrasekhar-mass explosion models. We have individually varied all input\nreaction and, for the first time, weak interaction rates by a factor of ten and\ncompared the yields in each case to yields using standard rates.

Momentum degradation of the hard and semihard partons as they traverse\nthe inhomogeneous medium at various azimuthal angles results in a complicated\nconvolution of geometrical, nuclear and dynamical factors that cannot usually\nbe described in a transparent way. In this work a compact formula is found that\nrepresents the inclusive distributions of minijets of any parton type at the\nsurface of the medium for any collision centrality. They take into account the\ncontributions from all initiating partons created at any point in the medium.\nBy comparing with the case of no energy loss, a ratio has been determined that\nis analogous to the nuclear modification factor for minijets. Phenomenological\nreality of such distributions is examined by calculating the hadronization of\nthe minijets in the recombination model.

An important property made manifest\nin this study is that quarks and gluons must not lose energy in the same way\nbecause the partons form mesons and baryons differently by recombination and\nthe momenta of quarks and gluons must be degraded at different rates in order\nto reproduce the experimental pion and proton spectra.

These results represent the strongest demonstration\nthat the Standard Model of electroweak interactions is incomplete and that new\nPhysics beyond it must exist.

In measurements of\nthe basic weak muon capture reaction on the proton to determine the\npseudoscalar coupling g_P, capture occurs from both atomic and molecular\nstates. Thus knowledge of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ is required for a correct\ninterpretation of these experiments.\n  Purpose: Recently the MuCap experiment has measured the capture rate\n\\Lambda_S from the singlet p\\mu\\ atom, employing a low density active target to\nsuppress pp\\mu\\ formation (PRL 110, 12504 (2013)). Nevertheless, given the\nunprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge\nin \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ had to be improved.\n  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon\ndisappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen. By doping the hydrogen with 20 ppm\nof argon, a competing process to pp\\mu\\ formation was introduced, which allowed\nthe extraction of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ from the observed time distribution of decay\nelectrons.\n  Results: The pp\\mu\\ formation rate was measured as \\lambda_pp\\mu = (2.01 +-\n0.06(stat) +- 0.03(sys)) 10^6 s^-1. This result updates the \\lambda_pp\\mu\\\nvalue used in the above mentioned MuCap publication.\n  Conclusions: The 2.5x higher precision compared to earlier experiments and\nthe fact that the measurement was performed at nearly identical conditions to\nthe main data taking, reduces the uncertainty induced by \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ to a\nminor contribution to the overall uncertainty of \\Lambda_S and g_P, as\ndetermined in MuCap. Our final value for \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ shifts \\Lambda_S and\ng_P by less than one tenth of their respective uncertainties compared to our\nresults published earlier. \n\n"}

There is little systematic knowledge of the contribution\nof collective excitations to the interaction between nuclei, particularly in\nthe overlap region of heavy nuclei.\n  Purpose: To study the dynamic polarization potential (DPP) generated by\nchannel coupling that had been validated for a case where scattering is\nsensitive to the nuclear potential over a wide radial range; to exhibit\nevidence of the non-locality due to collective coupling; to validate, or\notherwise, the representation of DPPs by uniform renormalization of potentials.\n  Methods: S-matrix to potential inversion yields local potentials reproducing\nthe elastic channel S-matrix of coupled channel calculations. Subtracting the\nelastic channel uncoupled potential yields a local L-independent representation\nof the DPP. The dependence of the DPP on the nature of the coupled states and\nother parameters can be studied.\n  Results: Local DPPs were found due to the excitation of C-12 and the combined\nexcitation of O-16 and C-12. The radial forms found were very different from\nuniform renormalization of the potential. Full coupling led to a 10 percent\nincrease in the volume integral of the real potential.

The method is useful for study of the\ncontribution of collective excitations to internuclear potentials, concerning\nwhich remarkably little is known in general. \n\n"}

HPXe chambers are capable\nof imaging electron tracks, a feature that enhances the separation between\nsignal events (the two electrons emitted in the 0nbb decay of 136Xe) and\nbackground events, arising chiefly from single electrons of kinetic energy\ncompatible with the end-point of the 0nbb decay (Qbb ). Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction. Due to electron multiple scattering, this\nstrategy is not perfectly efficient on an event-by-event basis, but a\nstatistical estimator can be constructed which can be used to reject background\nevents by one order of magnitude at a moderate cost (approx. 30%) in signal\nefficiency. Combining this estimator with the excellent energy resolution and\ntopological signature identification characteristic of the HPXe TPC, it is\npossible to reach a background rate of less than one count per ton-year of\nexposure.

{"id": "1512.08214", "contents": "Title: Isoscalar dipole transition as a probe for asymmetric clustering Abstract: Background: The sharp $1^-$ resonances with enhanced isoscalar dipole\ntransition strengths are observed in many light nuclei at relatively small\nexcitation energies, but their nature was unclear. Purpose: We show those\nresonances can be attributed to the cluster states with asymmetric\nconfigurations such as $\\alpha$+$^{16}{\\rm O}$. We explain why asymmetric\ncluster states are strongly excited by the isoscalar dipole transition. We also\nprovide a theoretical prediction of the isoscalar dipole transitions in\n$^{20}{\\rm Ne}$ and $^{44}{\\rm Ti}$. Method: The transition matrix is\nanalytically derived to clarify the excitation mechanism. The nuclear model\ncalculations by Brink-Bloch wave function and antisymmetrized molecular\ndynamics are also performed to provide a theoretical prediction for $^{20}{\\rm\nNe}$ and $^{44}{\\rm Ti}$. Results: It is shown that the transition matrix is as\nlarge as the Weisskopf estimate even though the ground state is an ideal shell\nmodel state. Furthermore, it is considerably amplified if the ground state has\ncluster correlation. The nuclear model calculations predict large transition\nmatrix to the $\\alpha$+$^{16}{\\rm O}$ and $\\alpha$+$^{40}{\\rm Ca}$ cluster\nstates comparable with or larger than the Weisskopf estimate.\n  Conclusion: We conclude that the asymmetric cluster states are strongly\nexcited by the isoscalar dipole transition. Combined with the isoscalar\nmonopole transition that populates the $0^+$ cluster states, the isoscalar\ntransitions are promising probe for asymmetric clusters. \n\n"}

The tray\ncombination will allow for identification of kaons from 1 GeV/c up to 7.2\nGeV/c, reaching 10^-2 proton and 10^-3 pion rejection, with kaon detection\nefficiency better than 95%. The diffusion box of the detector is equipped with\n14 five-inch diameter photomultiplier tubes. Its interior walls are covered\nwith Gore diffusive reflector, which is superior to the commonly used Millipore\npaper and improved the detector performance by 35%. The inner surface of the\ntwo aerogel trays with higher refractive index is covered with Millipore paper,\nhowever, those two trays with lower aerogel refractive index are again covered\nwith Gore diffusive reflector for higher performance. The measured mean number\nof photoelectrons in saturation is ~12 for n=1.030, ~sim8 for n=1.020, ~10 for\nn=1.015, and ~5.5 for n=1.011. The design details, the results of component\ncharacterization, and initial performance tests and optimization of the\ndetector are presented. \n\n"}

In this work, the\ndemonstrator was commissioned and completed, which is discussed extensively.\nThe demonstrator works reliably and collects low-background physics data. One\nresult of the analysis of the data is that surface events are the dominating\nbackground component. To better understand and possibly discriminate this\nbackground, surface events were studied in detail. This was done mainly using\nlaboratory measurements. For a better interpretation of these measurements,\nsimulations of particle trajectories and ranges were done. The surface\nsensitivity tests showed large differences between the individual detectors.\nOften, a dead-layer was determined, especially at the surfaces where the\nnon-collecting anode (NCA) is the outermost anode rail. Due to this, the\nsensitivity of the surfaces where the collecting anode (CA) is adjacent was\ntypically about a factor of three larger than the NCA sensitivity. A comparison\nof the pulse shape analysis methods LSE and A/E was done. Laboratory\nmeasurements indicate, that the latter performs better.

For the nuclear\ninteraction we use the state of the art UNEDF1 parametrization, which was\nintroduced to study largely deformed nuclei, hence is suitable for studies of\nthe nuclear pasta. Density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy is\nsimulated by tuning two purely isovector observables that are insensitive to\nthe current available experimental data.

We estimate the critical beam flux by\nbalancing the energy of fusion production against the plasma thermo-energy and\nthe loss due to stopping power for the case of an inert plasma. The product of\ncritical flux and plasma lifetime is independent of plasma density and has a\nweak dependence on temperature.

BUGS utilises\nthree types of detector to facilitate a high-sensitivity, high-throughput\nradioassay programme to support the development of rare-event search\nexperiments. A Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector delivers sensitivity to\nlow-energy gamma-rays such as those emitted by 210Pb and 234Th. A Small Anode\nGermanium (SAGe) well-type detector is employed for efficient screening of\nsmall samples. Finally, a standard p-type coaxial detector provides fast\nscreening of standard samples. This paper presents the steps used to\ncharacterise the performance of these detectors for a variety of sample\ngeometries, including the corrections applied to account for cascade summing\neffects. For low-density materials, BUGS is able to radio-assay to specific\nactivities down to 3.6 mBq/kg for 234Th and 6.6 mBq/kg for 210Pb both of which\nhave uncovered some significant equilibrium breaks in the 238U chain.

These data should\nprovide the best test of lepton universality in a scattering experiment to\ndate, about an order of magnitude improvement over previous tests. Measuring\nscattering with both particle polarities will allow a test of two-photon\nexchange at the sub-percent level, about a factor of four improvement on\nuncertainties and over an order of magnitude more data points than previous low\nmomentum transfer determinations, and similar to the current generation of\nhigher momentum transfer electron experiments. The experiment has the potential\nto demonstrate whether the $\\mu p$ and $ep$ interactions are consistent or\ndifferent, and whether any difference results from novel physics or two-photon\nexchange. The uncertainties are such that if the discrepancy is real it should\nbe confirmed with $\\approx$5$\\sigma$ significance, similar to that already\nestablished between the regular and muonic hydrogen Lamb shift. \n\n"}

We present a novel DOI-estimation\napproach based on the supervised machine learning algorithm gradient tree\nboosting (GTB). GTB builds predictive regression models based on sequential\nbinary comparisons (decision trees). GTB models have been shown to be\nimplementable in FPGA if the memory requirement fits the available resources.\nWe propose two optimization scenarios for the best possible positioning\nperformance: One restricting the available memory to enable a future FPGA\nimplementation and one without any restrictions. The positioning performance of\nthe GTB models is compared with a DOI estimation method based on a single DOI\nobservable (SO) comparable to other methods presented in literature. For a 12\nmm high monolith, we achieve an averaged spatial resolution of 2.15 mm and 2.12\nmm FWHM for SO and GTB models, respectively. In contrast to SO models, GTB\nmodels show a nearly uniform positioning performance over the whole crystal\ndepth. \n\n"}

Here we discuss that\nobservable consequences of such changes can also be seen in more elementary\nreactions on nuclei. Particular emphasis is put on a discussion of actual\nobservables in photonuclear reactions; we discuss in detail $\\eta$- and\nvector-meson production. We show that photoproduction of $\\eta$'s can yield\nessential information on in-medium properties of the $S_{11}(1535)$ resonance\nwhile the $\\phi$ meson properties will probably not be accessible through the\n$K^+K^-$ decay channel. However, for $\\omega$ mesons the $\\pi^0\\gamma$ decay\nchannel, due to its reduced final state interaction, looks more promising in\nthis respect. Completely free of final state interactions is dilepton\nproduction in the few GeV range. We show that the sensitivity of this decay\nchannel to changes of hadronic properties in medium in photonuclear reactions\non nuclei is as large as in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.
