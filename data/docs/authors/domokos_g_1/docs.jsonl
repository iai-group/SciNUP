Here we present a mechanism for suppressing\nthe NP effects to FCNC processes. We consider the possibility that the source\nof NP contributions to FCNC processes share the same flavor symmetry underlying\nthe SM source of FCNC processes which are the quark and lepton mass matrices.\nWe call this the principle of shared flavor symmetry. In the flavor symmetric\nlimit, the quark and lepton mixing matrices have fixed forms and there are no\nNP FCNC processes. In the flavor symmetric limit, we take the quark mixing\nmatrix to be the identity matrix and the lepton mixing matrix to be given by\ntri-bimaximal mixing. Realistic mixing matrices are obtained by the small\nbreaking of the flavor symmetry. New contributions to FCNC processes arise\nbecause of non universal breaking of the flavor symmetry in the quark and\nlepton mass matrices and the NP sources of FCNC processes. In particular, we\nwill focus on new FCNC effects that arise due to the breaking of flavor\nsymmetry only in the quark and charged lepton mass matrices but not in the NP\nsector.

One effect of it is amplitude\nbirefringence of gravitational waves, whereby left and right\ncircularly-polarized waves propagate at the same speed but with different\namplitude evolution. Here we propose a test of this effect through coincident\nobservations of gravitational waves and short gamma-ray bursts from binary\nmergers involving neutron stars. Such gravitational waves are highly left or\nright circularly-polarized due to the geometry of the merger. Using\nlocalization information from the gamma-ray burst, ground-based gravitational\nwave detectors can measure the distance to the source with reasonable accuracy.\nAn electromagnetic determination of the redshift from an afterglow or host\ngalaxy yields an independent measure of this distance.

Observation of spectral splits in a future galactic\nsupernova signal is expected to throw light on the mass hierarchy pattern of\nthe neutrinos. However, since the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB)\ncomprises of a superposition of neutrino fluxes from all past supernovae, and\nsince different supernovae are expected to have slightly different initial\nfluxes, it is pertinent to check if the hierarchy dependent signature of\ncollective oscillations can survive this averaging of the flux spectra.

For such solutions,\nthe hydrodynamic variables remain constant. We construct asymptotically AdS\nsolutions of Einstein's gravity dual to such processes at strong coupling,\nperturbatively in the amplitude expansion, where the expansion parameter is the\nratio of the amplitude of the non-hydrodynamic shear-stress tensor to the\npressure. At each order, we sum over all time derivatives through exact\nrecursion relations. We argue that the metric has a regular future horizon,\norder by order in the amplitude expansion, provided the shear-stress tensor\nfollows an equation of motion. At the linear order, this equation of motion\nimplies that the metric perturbations are composed of zero wavelength\nquasinormal modes. Our method allows us to calculate the non-linear corrections\nto this equation perturbatively in the amplitude expansion. We thus derive a\nspecial case of our previous conjecture on the regularity condition on the\nboundary stress tensor that endows the bulk metric with a regular future\nhorizon, and also refine it further. We also propose a new outlook for\nheavy-ion phenomenology at RHIC and ALICE. \n\n"}

The ultimate\ngoal is to probe all kinematically allowed final states as a function of mass\nand, if all states are adequately excluded, set a lower limit to the WIMP mass.\nProbing the low-mass region is further motivated due to recent hints for a\nlight WIMP in direct and indirect searches.

Although\nthe large squeezing of the quantum state of the perturbations and the\nphenomenon of decoherence explain many aspects of the quantum to classical\ntransition, it remains to understand how a specific outcome can be produced in\nthe early universe, in the absence of any observer. The Continuous Spontaneous\nLocalization (CSL) approach to quantum mechanics attempts to solve the quantum\nmeasurement question in a general context. In this framework, the wavefunction\ncollapse is caused by adding new non linear and stochastic terms to the\nSchroedinger equation. In this paper, we apply this theory to inflation, which\namounts to solving the CSL parametric oscillator case. We choose the\nwavefunction collapse to occur on an eigenstate of the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable\nand discuss the corresponding modified Schroedinger equation. Then, we compute\nthe power spectrum of the perturbations and show that it acquires a universal\nshape with two branches, one which remains scale invariant and one with nS=4, a\nspectral index in obvious contradiction with the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) anisotropy observations. The requirement that the non-scale invariant\npart be outside the observational window puts stringent constraints on the\nparameter controlling the deviations from ordinary quantum mechanics...\n(Abridged). \n\n"}

The high-$Q^2$ processes\nassociated with the QCD evolution of the jet from production as a single hard\nparton through its fragmentation, up to but not including hadronization, are\ntreated perturbatively. The interactions between the partons in the shower and\nthe deconfined matter within which they find themselves lead to energy loss.\nThe momentum scales associated with the medium (of the order of the\ntemperature) and with typical interactions between partons in the shower and\nthe medium are sufficiently soft that strongly coupled physics plays an\nimportant role in energy loss. We model these interactions using qualitative\ninsights from holographic calculations of the energy loss of energetic light\nquarks and gluons in a strongly coupled plasma, obtained via gauge/gravity\nduality. We embed this hybrid model into a hydrodynamic description of the\nspacetime evolution of the hot QCD matter produced in heavy ion collisions and\nconfront its predictions with jet data from the LHC.

In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat, in addition to neutrino masses and dark matter, the scotogenic model also\nallows to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via low-scale\nleptogenesis. First, we consider the case of two right-handed neutrinos (RHNs)\nN_{1,2}, for which we provide an analytical argument why it is impossible to\npush the RHN mass scale below M_1^min ~ 10^10 GeV, which is identical to the\nvalue in standard thermal leptogenesis in the type-I seesaw scenario with the\nsame washout strength.

In a previous work [Correia {\\it et\nal.}, Phys.Rev.D90, 023521 (2014)] we numerically studied the evolution of\nvarious types of biased domain wall networks in the early universe, confirming\nthat anisotropic networks ultimately reach scaling while those with a biased\npotential or biased initial conditions decay.

Rather than looking at a generic modulated spectrum, our calculations\nare based on a specific model, and are intended as a case study for the sort of\nconstraints one could hope to apply on a well-motivated model of\ntrans-Planckian physics.

Since mtop is\nlarge, any GUT-scale phase in At feeds into other weak scale phases through\nRGEs, which in turn contribute to dn. Thus CP-violating effects due to a\nweak-scale At are strongly constrained.

Quantitative estimates of the\ncontributions to dn from Au, Ad and B show that substantial fine-tuning is\nstill required to satisfy the experimental bound on dn. While the low energy\nphases of the A's are not as strongly constrained as the phase of B(mz), we\nnote that the phase of a universal A(GUT) induces large contributions in the\nphase of B(mz) through RGEs, and is thus still strongly constrained in most\nmodels with squark masses below a TeV. \n\n"}

As a toy model we couple a free scalar boson\nquantum field to an exemplaric heat bath with some given temperature T. It will\nbe shown in detail that the emerging transport equations have to be understood\nas the ensemble average over stochastic equations of Langevin type. This\ncorresponds to the equivalence of the influence functional approach by Feynman\nand Vernon and the CTP technique. The former, however, gives a more intuitive\nphysical picture. In particular the physical role of (quantum) noise and the\nconnection of its correlation kernel to the Kadanoff-Baym equations will be\ndiscussed.

The auxiliary field, at\ntree level, has a \"negative squared mass\". By computing the one-loop effective\naction in the low energy effective theory, we show that a kinetic term for the\nauxiliary field emerges when an explicit non-perturbative mechanism for\nsupersymmetry breaking is introduced. We find that, due to the naive choice of\nthe Kaehler potential, the Higgs potential remains unbounded from the below. A\npossible scenario for solving this problem is presented. It is also shown that\nonce chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken via a non-zero vacuum expectation\nvalue of the Higgs field, the low energy composite fermion field acquires a\nmass and decouples, while in the supersymmetric limit it was kept massless by\nthe 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions. \n\n"}

DLCQ Approach Abstract: Dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the DLCQ method is investigated in\ndetail using a chiral Yukawa model closely related to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\nmodel.

A quantum\nanalysis demonstrates that a nonperturbative mean-field solution to the\n``zero-mode constraint'' for a scalar boson (sigma) can develop a nonzero\ncondensate while a perturbative solution cannot. This description is due to our\nidentification of the ``zero-mode constraint'' with the gap equation.
