We\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite.

Many measurements are destructive, removing more\ninformation from the system than they obtain. Quantum non-demolition (QND)\nmeasurements allow repeated measurements that give the same eigenvalue. They\ncould be used for several quantum information processing tasks such as error\ncorrection, preparation by measurement, and one-way quantum computing.\nAchieving QND measurements of photons is especially challenging because the\ndetector must be completely transparent to the photons while still acquiring\ninformation about them. Recent progress in manipulating microwave photons in\nsuperconducting circuits has increased demand for a QND detector which operates\nin the gigahertz frequency range. Here we demonstrate a QND detection scheme\nwhich measures the number of photons inside a high quality-factor microwave\ncavity on a chip. This scheme maps a photon number onto a qubit state in a\nsingle-shot via qubit-photon logic gates. We verify the operation of the device\nby analyzing the average correlations of repeated measurements, and show that\nit is 90% QND. It differs from previously reported detectors because its\nsensitivity is strongly selective to chosen photon number states.

The density of defects after the sweep\ncan be conveniently described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In particular, the\nnumber of kinks in the zigzag ordering can be derived from a time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau equation for the order parameter, here the zigzag transverse\nsize, under the assumption that the ions are continuously laser cooled. In a\nlinear Paul trap the transition becomes inhomogeneous, being the charge density\nlarger in the center and more rarefied at the edges. During the linear quench\nthe mechanical instability is first crossed in the center of the chain, and a\nfront, at which the mechanical instability is crossed during the quench, is\nidentified which propagates along the chain from the center to the edges. If\nthe velocity of this front is smaller than the sound velocity, the dynamics\nbecomes adiabatic even in the thermodynamic limit and no defect is produced.\nOtherwise, the nucleation of kinks is reduced with respect to the case in which\nthe charges are homogeneously distributed, leading to a new scaling of the\ndensity of kinks with the quenching rate. The analytical predictions are\nverified numerically by integrating the Langevin equations of motion of the\nions, in presence of a time-dependent transverse confinement.

These\ninsulators are not required to have gapless boundary modes in the energy\nspectrum. However, they do exhibit protected modes in the entanglement spectrum\nlocalized on the cut between two entangled regions. Their entanglement entropy\ncannot be made to vanish adiabatically, and hence the insulators can be called\ntopological. There is a direct connection between the inversion eigenvalues of\nthe band structure and the mid-gap states in the entanglement spectrum. The\nclassification of protected entanglement levels is given by an integer $n\\in\nZ$, which is the difference between the negative inversion eigenvalues at\ninversion symmetric points in the Brillouin zone, taken in sets of two. When\nthe Hamiltonian describes a Chern insulator or a non-trivial T-invariant\ntopological insulator, the entanglement spectrum exhibits spectral flow. If the\nChern number is zero for the former, or T is broken in the latter, the\nentanglement spectrum does \\emph{not} have spectral flow, but, depending on the\ninversion eigenvalues, can still have protected midgap bands. Although spectral\nflow is broken, the mid-gap entanglement bands cannot be adiabatically removed,\nand the insulator is `topological.'

Here we study electronic\nproperties of ABA-stacked trilayer graphene biased by a perpendicular electric\nfield. We find that the combination of the bias and trigonal warping gives rise\nto a set of new Dirac points: in each valley, seven species of Dirac fermions\nwith small masses of order of a few meV emerge. The positions and masses of the\nemergent Dirac fermions are tunable by bias, and one group of Dirac fermions\nbecomes massless at a certain bias value. Therefore, in contrast to bilayer\ngraphene, the conductivity at the neutrality point is expected to show\nnon-monotonic behavior, becoming of the order of a few e^2/h when some Dirac\nmasses vanish. Further, we analyze the evolution of Landau level spectrum as a\nfunction of bias. Emergence of new Dirac points in the band structure\ntranslates into new three-fold-degenerate groups of Landau levels. This leads\nto an anomalous quantum Hall effect, in which some quantum Hall steps have a\nheight of 3e^2/h. At an intermediate bias, the degeneracies of all Landau\nlevels get lifted, and in this regime all quantum Hall plateaus are spaced by\ne^2/h.

Under degeneracy of the electron gas (high concentration, low\ntemperature), a dip at the center of the polarization profile appears with a\npolarization maximum at a distance of about $2 \\; \\mu m$ from the center.

We analytically prove that the memory properties of UMMs endow them\nwith universal computing power - they are Turing-complete -, intrinsic\nparallelism, functional polymorphism, and information overhead, namely their\ncollective states can support exponential data compression directly in memory.\nWe also demonstrate that a UMM has the same computational power as a\nnon-deterministic Turing machine, namely it can solve NP--complete problems in\npolynomial time. However, by virtue of its information overhead, a UMM needs\nonly an amount of memory cells (memprocessors) that grows polynomially with the\nproblem size.

As such, the VHS contribution is not tied to the Fermi level\nbut rather turns on near $T_{VHS}=(E_F-E_{VHS})/k_B$ [where $E_F$ is the Fermi\nenergy and $E_{VHS}$ the energy of the VHS peak]. Identifying $T^*\\simeq\nT_{VHS}$ can explain many characteristic features of the pseudogap, including\nthe transport anomalies and the termination of the pseudogap when $E_{VHS}$\ncrosses the Fermi level. \n\n"}

The discipline, commonly called femtomagnetism, started\nwith the pioneering experiment by Beaurepaire and coworkers in 1996, who showed\nsubpicosecond demagnetization occurs in magnetic Ni thin films. This finding\nhas motivated extensive research worldwide. All-optical helicity-dependent spin\nswitching (AOS) represents a new frontier in femtomagnetism, where a single\nultrafast laser pulse can permanently switch spin without any assistance from a\nmagnetic field. This review summarizes some of the crucial aspects of this new\ndiscipline: key experimental findings, leading mechanisms, controversial\nissues, and possible future directions. The emphasis is on our latest\ninvestigation. We first develop the all-optical spin switching rule that\ndetermines how the switchability depends on the light helicity. This rule\nallows one to understand microscopically how the spin is reversed and why the\ncircularly polarized light appears more powerful than the linearly polarized\nlight.

Even though this\nphenomenon, known as superradiance, has been thoroughly analysed in several\ntheoretical scenarios (from eletromagnetic radiation scattering on a rotating\ncylinder to gravitational waves incident upon a rotating black hole), it has\nnever been observed. Here we describe in detail the first laboratory detection\nof superradiance. We observed that plane waves propagating on the surface of\nwater are amplified after being scattered by a draining vortex. The maximum\namplification measured in the experiment was 20%, obtained for 3.70 Hz waves,\nin a 6.25 cm deep fluid. Our results are consistent with superradiant\nscattering caused by rapid rotation. In particular, a draining fluid can\ntransfer part of its rotational energy to incident low-frequency waves. Our\nexperimental findings will shed new light on Black Hole Physics, since shallow\nwater waves scattering on a draining fluid constitute an analogue of a black\nhole. We believe, especially in view of the recent observations of\ngravitational waves, that our results will motivate further research (both\ntheoretical and experimental) on the observation of superradiance of\ngravitational waves. \n\n"}

We propose and prove a\nmodified Lieb-Shultz Mattis (LSM) theorem in this setting, which applies even\nwhen the spin in the enlarged magnetic unit cell is integral. There are two\nnontrivial outcomes for gapped ground states that preserve all symmetries. In\nthe first case, one necessarily obtains a symmetry protected topological (SPT)\nphase with protected edge states. This allows us to readily construct models of\nSPT states by decorating dimer models of Mott insulators to yield SPT phases,\nwhich should be useful in their physical realization. In the second case,\nexotic bulk excitations, i.e. topological order, is necessarily present. While\nboth scenarios require fractional spin in the lattice unit cell, the second\nrequires that the symmetries protecting the fractional spin is related to that\ninvolved in the magnetic translations. Our discussion encompasses the general\nnotion of fractional spin (projective symmetry representations) and magnetic\nflux (magnetic translations tied to a symmetry generator). The resulting SPTs\ndisplay a dyonic character in that they associate charge with symmetry flux,\nallowing the flux in the unit cell to screen the projective representation on\nthe sites.

The trapped cold atoms have been actively\nused as a clean and versatile simulator for classical and quantum-mechanical\nsystems, deepening understanding of the many-body physics behind. Here we\nreview the nonlinear and collective dynamics in a periodically modulated\nmagneto-optically trapped cold atoms. By temporally modulating the intensity of\nthe trapping lasers with the controlled phases, one can realize two kinds of\nnonlinear oscillators, the parametrically driven oscillator and the resonantly\ndriven Duffing oscillator, which exhibit the dynamical bistable states. Cold\natoms behave not only as the single-particle nonlinear oscillators, but also as\nthe coupled oscillators by the light-induced inter-atomic interaction, which\nleads to the phase transitions far from equilibrium in a way similar to the\nphase transition in equilibrium. The parametrically driven cold atoms show the\nideal mean-field symmetry-breaking transition, and the symmetry is broken with\nrespect to time translation by the modulation period.

Here we have\ncarried out a comparative study of the pressure-induced spin transition in\ncompounds with trivalent iron, octahedrally coordinated by oxygen.\nHigh-pressure single-crystal M\\\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy data for FeBO$_3$,\nFe$_2$O$_3$ and Fe$_3$(Fe$_{1.766(2)}$Si$_{0.234(2)}$)(SiO$_4$)$_3$ are\npresented together with detailed analysis of hyperfine parameter behavior.

The instability of iron octahedra,\ntogether with strong interactions between them in the vicinity of the critical\nvolume, may trigger a phase transition in the metastable phase.

These findings are most\napparent in the underdoped regime, where a pseudogap is also evident. While the\nconventional (Gaussian) fluctuation picture has been applied to address these\nresults, this preformed-pair approach omits the crucial effects of a pseudogap.\nIn this paper we remedy this omission by computing the diamagnetic\nsusceptibility and Nernst coefficient in the presence of a normal state gap.

This model was\nproposed by Polychronakos as a regularization of the noncommutative\nChern-Simons theory description of the Laughlin states proposed earlier by\nSusskind. Both models can be understood as describing the electrons in a FQH\nstate as forming a noncommutative fluid, i.e., a fluid occupying a\nnoncommutative space.

Nevertheless the model exhibits topological responses\nincluding the appearance of quantized fractional charge bound to rotational\ndefects (disclinations) and the pumping of angular momentum in response to\nthreading an elementary magnetic flux, which are described by a mutual\nChern-Simons coupling between the electromagnetic gauge field and an effective\ngauge field corresponding to the rotation symmetry. In addition, we show that\nalthough the filled bands of the model do not admit a symmetric Wannier\nrepresentation, this obstruction is removed upon the addition of appropriate\natomic orbitals, which implies `fragile' topology. As a result, the response of\nthe model can be derived by representing it as a superposition of atomic\norbitals with positive and negative integer coefficients.

A\ndiscussion on how to probe the Kondo destruction effect across the\nquantum-critical point using ARPES and STM measurements is presented.\nParticular emphasis is placed on the question of how to distinguish between the\nsignatures of the initial onset of hybridization-gap formation, which is the\n\"high-energy\" physics to be expected in all heavy-electron systems, and those\nof Kondo destruction, which characterizes the low-energy physics and, hence,\nthe nature of quantum criticality. Recent progress and possible challenges in\nthe experimental investigations are surveyed, the STM and ARPES spectra for\nseveral quantum-critical heavy-electron compounds are compared, and the\nprospects for further advances are outlined. \n\n"}

However,\nthe immense complexity of real cells obscures the fundamental tensions between\nenergy gradients and entropic contributions that underlie duplication. The\nstudy of synthetic, feasible systems reproducing part of the key ingredients of\nliving entities but overcoming major sources of biological complexity is of\ngreat relevance to deepen the comprehension of the fundamental thermodynamic\nprocesses underlying life and its prevalence. In this paper an abstract -- yet\nrealistic -- synthetic system made of small synthetic protocell aggregates is\nstudied in detail. A fundamental relation between free energy and entropic\ngradients is derived for a general, non-equilibrium scenario, setting the\nthermodynamic conditions for the occurrence and prevalence of duplication\nphenomena. This relation sets explicitly how the energy gradients invested in\ncreating and maintaining structural -- and eventually, functional -- elements\nof the system must always compensate the entropic gradients, whose\ncontributions come from changes in the translational, configurational and\nmacrostate entropies, as well as from dissipation due to irreversible\ntransitions.

In this paper, we present new diffuse scattering\nresults obtained on Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3 (PZN for short) and\n(1-x)Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3-xPbTiO3(PZN-xPT)single crystals (with x=4.5 and 9%),\naround various Bragg reflections and along three symmetry directions in the\n[100]-[011] zone. Diffuse scattering is observed around reflections with mixed\nindices, (100), (011) and (300), and along transverse and diagonal directions\nonly. No diffuse scattering is found in longitudinal scans. The diffuse\nscattering peaks can be fitted well with a Lorentzian function, from which a\ncorrelation length is extracted. The correlation length increases with\ndecreasing temperatures down to the transition at Tc, first following a\nCurie-Weiss law, then departing from it and becoming flat at very low\ntemperatures. These results are interpreted in terms of three temperature\nregions: 1) dynamic polarization fluctuations (i.e. with a finite lifetime) at\nhigh temperatures, 2) static polarization reorientations (condensation of polar\nnanoregions) that can still reorient as a unit (relaxor behavior) at\nintermediate temperatures and 3) orientational freezing of the polar\nnanoregions with random strain fields in pure PZN or a structural phase\ntransition in PZN-xPT at low temperatures. The addition of PT leads to a\nbroadening of the diffuse scattering along the diagonal ([111]) relative to the\ntransverse ([100]) direction, indicating a change in the orientation of the\npolar regions.

These properties can be essentially modified by\neven rather weak interaction between these components. One of them can be\nregarded as a rigid matrix, while another one as a filling in the form of\nisolated atoms, molecules or clusters. Structures containing voids of the\ndiameter up to D ~ (1 - 2)nm in diameter in the stoichiometric sublattice\nbelong to this class of compounds. These voids are filled by the second\ncomponent (of diameter d_{0}), which can be compressed or stretched because of\nthe sublattice parameters misfit. A stretched matter (D - d_{0} = h > 0) can\nexist in a unique intermediate state between the metal and the dielectric; this\nstate cannot be implemented by another way.

After reviewing our work on the interplay among Tc,\nhole content, and pressure in the bilayered and multilayered cuprate\nsuperconductors, we will discuss how the proximity to an electronic topological\ntransition (ETT) may give a microscopic justification of the ``intrinsic''\npressure dependence of Tc in the cuprates.

In order to\ndistinguish the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic contributions in spin injection,\nwe describe the current injection with four channels : the two spin populations\nof the conduction bands ($s$ or paramagnetic) and the two spin populations of\nthe more correlated electrons ($d$ or ferromagnetic). The redistribution of the\nconduction electrons at the interface is described by relaxation mechanisms\nbetween the channels. Providing that the $d$ majority-spin band is frozen,\n$s-d$ relaxation essentially concerns the minority-spin channels. Accordingly,\neven in the abscence of spin-flip scattering (i.e. without standard\nspin-accumulation or giant magnetoresistance), the $s-d$ relaxation leads to a\n$d$ spin accumulation effect. The coupled diffusion equations for the two\nrelaxation processes ($s-d$ and spin-flip) are derived.

We present\nsemiclassical, but otherwise first principle, study of this process at all\nenergies of colliding particles. We find that direct tunneling to the final\nstate occurs at energies below the critical value E_c, which is slightly higher\nthan the barrier height. Tunneling probability grows with energy in this\nregime. Above the critical energy, the tunneling mechanism is different. The\ntransition proceeds through creation of a state close to the top of the\npotential barrier (sphaleron) and its subsequent decay. At certain limiting\nenergy E_l tunneling probability ceases to grow. At higher energies the\ndominant mechanism of transition becomes the release of energy excess E-E_l by\nthe emission of a few particles and then tunneling at effectively lower energy\nE=E_l via the limiting semiclassical configuration.
