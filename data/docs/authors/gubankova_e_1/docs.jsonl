{"id": "0807.3037", "contents": "Title: K-inflationary Power Spectra in the Uniform Approximation Abstract: The advent of explicit Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) inflationary models within\nstring theory has drawn renewed interest to the cosmological role of unusual\nscalar field dynamics, usually referred to as k-inflation. In this situation,\nthe standard method used to determine the behavior of cosmological\nperturbations breaks down. We present a generic method, based on the uniform\napproximation, to analytically derive the power spectra of scalar and tensor\nperturbations. For this purpose, a simple hierarchy of parameters, related to\nthe sound speed of the cosmological fluctuations and its successive\nderivatives, is introduced in a k-inflation analogue of the Hubble flow\nfunctions. The scalar spectral index and its running are obtained up to next to\nnext to leading order for all k-inflationary models. This result relies on the\nexistence of a well-motivated initial state, which is not trivial in the\npresent context: having the wavelength of the Fourier mode smaller than the\nsonic horizon is indeed not enough and some conditions on the dynamics of the\nsound speed are also required. Our method is then applied to various models\nencountered in the literature. After deriving a generic slow-roll trajectory\nvalid for any DBI model, simple formulae for the cosmological observables are\nobtained. In particular, the running, as the spectral index, for the so-called\nUV and IR brane inflationary models is found to be uniquely determined by the\n't Hooft coupling. Finally, the accuracy of these cosmological predictions is\nassessed by comparing the analytical approximations with exact numerical\nintegrations. \n\n"}

In a seemingly contradictory statement, we show that a very\nstrong magnetic field can turn an empty space into a superconductor. The\nexternal magnetic field required for this effect should be about 10^{16} Tesla\n(eB ~ 1 GeV^2). The physical mechanism of the exotic vacuum superconductivity\nis as follows: in strong magnetic field the dynamics of virtual quarks and\nantiquarks is effectively one-dimensional because these electrically charged\nparticles tend to move along the lines of the magnetic field. In one spatial\ndimension a gluon-mediated attraction between a quark and an antiquark of\ndifferent flavors inevitably leads to formation of a colorless spin-triplet\nbound state (a vector analogue of the Cooper pair) with quantum numbers of an\nelectrically charged rho meson.

We point out the possibility that the Higgs bosons appear in\nmodels of top-quark condensation, where the masses of the bosonic excitations\nare related to the top quark mass by the sum rule similar to the Nambu sum rule\nof the NJL models \\cite{Nambu}. This rule was originally considered by Nambu\nfor superfluid $^3$He-B and for the BCS model of superconductivity. It relates\nthe two masses of bosonic excitations existing in each channel of Cooper\npairing to the fermion mass. An example of the Nambu partners is provided by\nthe amplitude and the phase modes in the BCS model describing Cooper pairing in\nthe s-wave channel. This sum rule suggests the existence of the Nambu partners\nfor the 125 GeV Higgs boson. Their masses can be predicted by the Nambu sum\nrule under certain circumstances. For example, if there are only two states in\nthe given channel, the mass of the Nambu partner is $\\sim$ 325 GeV.

The\ncorrection appears at second order in the disorder strength and scales\ninversely with k_0. We discuss the extension to a system with a finite initial\ncharge density. The disorder averaged DC conductivity may be calculated by\nadopting a technique developed for holographic lattices. \n\n"}

After the end of inflation,\nthe flat direction oscillates about the minimum of its potential, losing at\neach oscillation about 56% of its energy into bursts of gauge/gaugino and\nscalar quanta when crossing the origin. These particles then acquire a large\ninflaton VEV-induced mass and decay perturbatively into the MSSM quanta and\ngravitinos, transferring the inflaton energy very efficiently via instant\npreheating. Regarding thermalization, we show that the MSSM degrees of freedom\nthermalize very quickly, yet not immediately by virtue of the large vacuum\nexpectation value of the inflaton, which breaks the $SU(3)_C\\times U(1)_Y$\nsymmetry into a residual $U(1)$.

The constructions\nof [1] make heavy use of the notion of semiclassical states for QGR. In the\npresent paper, we employ the complexifier coherent states for QGR recently\nproposed by Thiemann and Winkler as semiclassical states, and thus fill the\ngeneral formulas obtained in [1] with life. We demonstrate how one can, under\nsome simplifying assumptions, explicitely compute expectation values of the\noperators relevant for the gravity-matter Hamiltonians of [1] in the\ncomplexifier coherent states. These expectation values give rise to effective\nmatter Hamiltonians on the background on which the gravitational coherent state\nis peaked and thus induce approximate notions of n-particle states and matter\npropagation on fluctuating spacetimes. We display the details for the scalar\nand the electromagnetic field. The effective theories exhibit two types of\ncorrections as compared to the the ordinary QFT on CST.

Once the heaviness of the strange quark (mass\n$m_s$) and the requirements of electric and color neutrality are taken into\naccount, the CFL pattern of color superconductivity requires the pairing of\nquarks that would, in the absence of pairing, have Fermi momenta that differ by\nof order $m_s^2/\\mu$, with $\\mu$ the quark number chemical potential.

It is described how duality in SQCD\nlinks many previously known duality transformations that were thought to be\ndistinct, including Olive-Montonen duality of N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory\nand quark-hadron duality in (S)QCD. A connection between Olive-Montonen duality\nand the confining strings of Yang-Mills theory is explained, in which a picture\nof confinement via non-abelian monopole condensation -- a generalized dual\nMeissner effect -- emerges explicitly.

We provide further support for this\nconjecture by computing a one-loop dilatation operator in all (super)symmetric\nYang-Mills theories on the light-cone ranging from gluodynamics all the way to\nthe maximally supersymmetric N=4 theory. We demonstrate that the dilatation\noperator takes a remarkably simple form when realized in the space spanned by\nsingle-trace products of superfields separated by light-like distances. The\nlatter operators serve as generating functions for Wilson operators of the\nmaximal Lorentz spin and the scale dependence of the two are in the one-to-one\ncorrespondence with each other.

In the case of ${\\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills in 3+1\ndimensions, scaling functions can be defined which are modular forms of a\nsubgroup of the full modular group and which interpolate between vacua.\nInfra-red fixed points at strong coupling correspond to $\\theta$-vacua with\n$\\theta$ a rational number that, in the case of pure SUSY Yang-Mills, has odd\ndenominator. There is a mass gap for electrically charged particles which can\ncarry fractional electric charge. A similar structure applies to the 2+1\ndimensional quantum Hall effect where the hierarchy of Hall plateaux can be\nunderstood in terms of an action of the modular group and the stability of Hall\nplateaux is due to the fact that odd denominator Hall conductivities are\nattractive infra-red fixed points. There is a mass gap for electrically charged\nexcitations which, in the case of the fractional quantum Hall effect, carry\nfractional electric charge. \n\n"}

In four dimensions the potential one-form and\nthe Kerr-AdS metric with properly re-scaled mass parameter solve the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations, thereby resulting in the familiar Kerr-Newman-AdS\nsolution. We solve the quartic equation governing the location of the event\nhorizons of the Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes and present closed analytic\nexpressions for the radii of the horizons.
