Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies).

Binary\n  Evolution in Collisional Nuclei Abstract: [Abridged] In galactic nuclei with sufficiently short relaxation times,\nbinary supermassive black holes can evolve beyond their stalling radii via\ncontinued interaction with stars. We study this \"collisional\" evolutionary\nregime using both fully self-consistent N-body integrations and approximate\nFokker-Planck models. The N-body integrations employ particle numbers up to\n0.26M and a direct-summation potential solver; close interactions involving the\nbinary are treated using a new implementation of the Mikkola-Aarseth chain\nregularization algorithm. Even at these large values of N, two-body scattering\noccurs at high enough rates in the simulations that they can not be simply\nscaled to the large-N regime of real galaxies. The Fokker-Planck model is used\nto bridge this gap; it includes, for the first time, binary-induced changes in\nthe stellar density and potential. The Fokker-Planck model is shown to\naccurately reproduce the results of the N-body integrations, and is then\nextended to the much larger N regime of real galaxies. Analytic expressions are\nderived that accurately reproduce the time dependence of the binary semi-major\naxis as predicted by the Fokker-Planck model.

Abstract: The evolution of the galaxy stellar mass--star formation rate relationship\n(M*-SFR) provides key constraints on the stellar mass assembly histories of\ngalaxies. For star-forming galaxies, M*-SFR is observed to be fairly tight with\na slope close to unity from z~0-2. Simulations of galaxy formation reproduce\nthese trends owing to the generic dominance of smooth and steady cold accretion\nin these systems. In contrast, the amplitude of the M*-SFR relation evolves\nmarkedly differently than in models. Stated in terms of a star formation\nactivity parameter alpha=(M*/SFR)/(t_H-1 Gyr), models predict a constant\nalpha~1 out to redshifts z=4+, while the observed M*-SFR relation indicates\nthat alpha increases by X3 from z~2 until today. The low alpha at high-z not\nonly conflicts with models, but is also difficult to reconcile with other\nobservations of high-z galaxies. Systematic biases could significantly affect\nmeasurements of M* and SFR, but detailed considerations suggest that none are\nobvious candidates to reconcile the discrepancy. A speculative solution is\nconsidered in which the stellar initial mass function (IMF) evolves towards\nmore high-mass star formation at earlier epochs. Following Larson, a model is\ninvestigated in which the characteristic mass Mhat where the IMF turns over\nincreases with redshift. The observed and predicted M*-SFR evolution may be\nbrought into agreement if Mhat=0.5(1+z)^2 Mo out to z~2. Such evolution broadly\nmatches recent observations of cosmic stellar mass growth, and the resulting\nz=0 cumulative IMF is similar to the paunchy IMF favored by Fardal et al to\nreconcile the observed cosmic star formation history with present-day fossil\nlight measures.

We begin\nin this paper with a derivation of the self-force on a compact object moving in\nthe background spacetime of a supermassive black hole. The EFT approach\nutilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are the\nsize of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the background\nspacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as an\neffective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. Ultraviolet\ndivergences are regularized using Hadamard's {\\it partie finie} to isolate the\nnon-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part. The latter is\nconstructed from a momentum space representation for the graviton retarded\npropagator and is evaluated using dimensional regularization in which only\nlogarithmic divergences are relevant for renormalizing the parameters of the\ntheory. As a first important application of this framework we explicitly derive\nthe first order self-force given by Mino, Sasaki, Tanaka, Quinn and Wald.

In our scenario, the KK protons (the KK\nexcited quarks/gluons within protons) within the framework of universal extra\ndimensions (UEDs), are produced by high energy p + p collisions in Fermi\naccelerated environments, with protonic isotropic spectrum d N / d E \\propto\nE^-2 up to at least 10^18 eV. Thus, because they are also electrically charged,\nthey should be re-accelerated by mechanism similar to normal protons. The KK\nstates (no matter whether they have already decayed to the lightest KK particle\nor not) should contaminate 10^-5 to 10^-2 of cosmic-ray events for some fixed\nenergy E (within some suitable assumptions). Hence, if we have techniques to\nidentify them from air shower data, we can constrain UEDs scenario. Our method\nis an \"existence proof\" that we can constrain new physics beyond TeV scale or\nmuch higher by classical astrophysical scenarios, which can also be generalized\nto supersymmetric models, the bulk Standard Model fields within the RS model,\nand the endlessly emerging new models. Moreover, it can exploit domains which\nhave no possibility to be studied in terrestrial experiments. \n\n"}

This\nobject was previously studied using Keck/HIRES data. The main improvement over\nthe HIRES results is our ability to accurately determine the number density of\nthe outflow. For the major absorption component, level population from five\ndifferent Fe II excited level yields n_H=10^4.4 cm^-3 with less than 20%\nscatter. We find that the Fe ii absorption arises from a region with roughly\nconstant conditions and temperature greater than 9000 K, before the ionization\nfront where temperature and electron density drop.

A model comparison perspective on the curvature of\n  the Universe Abstract: The question of determining the spatial geometry of the Universe is of\ngreater relevance than ever, as precision cosmology promises to verify\ninflationary predictions about the curvature of the Universe. We revisit the\nquestion of what can be learnt about the spatial geometry of the Universe from\nthe perspective of a three-way Bayesian model comparison. We show that, given\ncurrent data, the probability that the Universe is spatially infinite lies\nbetween 67% and 98%, depending on the choice of priors. For the strongest prior\nchoice, we find odds of order 50:1 (200:1) in favour of a flat Universe when\ncompared with a closed (open) model. We also report a robust, prior-independent\nlower limit to the number of Hubble spheres in the Universe, N_U > 5 (at 99%\nconfidence). We forecast the accuracy with which future CMB and BAO\nobservations will be able to constrain curvature, finding that a cosmic\nvariance limited CMB experiment together with an SKA-like BAO observation will\nconstrain curvature with a precision of about sigma ~ 4.5x10^{-4}. We\ndemonstrate that the risk of 'model confusion' (i.e., wrongly favouring a flat\nUniverse in the presence of curvature) is much larger than might be assumed\nfrom parameter errors forecasts for future probes. We argue that a 5-sigma\ndetection threshold guarantees a confusion- and ambiguity-free model selection.\nTogether with inflationary arguments, this implies that the geometry of the\nUniverse is not knowable if the value of the curvature parameter is below\n|Omega_curvature| ~ 10^{-4}, a bound one order of magnitude larger than the\nsize of curvature perturbations, ~ 10^{-5}.

If the jet power is in turn related to the mass accretion rate,\nthe most luminous hard X-ray blazars should pinpoint the largest accretion\nrates, and therefore the largest black hole masses. These ideas are confirmed\nby the Swift satellite observations of the blazar S5 0014+813, at the redshift\nz=3.366. Swift detected this source with all its three instruments, from the\noptical to the hard X-rays. Through the construction of its spectral energy\ndistribution we are confident that its optical-UV emission is thermal in\norigin. Associating it to the emission of a standard optically thick\ngeometrically thin accretion disk, we find a black hole mass of 40 billion\nsolar masses, radiating at 40% the Eddington value. The derived mass is among\nthe largest ever found. Super-Eddington slim disks or thick disks with the\npresence of a collimating funnel can in principle reduce the black hole mass\nestimate, but tends to produce spectra bluer than observed. \n\n"}

It is usually proposed that hyperaccreting disks\nsurrounding stellar-mass black holes with a huge accretion rate are central\nengines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, hyperaccretion disks around\nneutron stars may exist in some GRB formation scenarios. We study the structure\nand neutrino emission of a hyperaccretion disk around a neutron star. We\nconsider a steady-state hyperaccretion disk, and as a reasonable approximation,\ndivide it into two regions, the inner and outer disks. The outer disk is\nsimilar to that of a black hole. The inner disk has a self-similar structure,\nsuch as the entropy-conservation or the advection structure, depending on the\nenergy transfer and emission in the disk. We see that the neutron star disk can\ncool more efficiently, produce much higher neutrino luminosity and neutrino\nannihilation luminosity than a black hole disk. The neutrino emission from the\nneutron star surface boundary layer could increase the neutrino annihilation\nluminosity.\n  Moreover, we study the effects of a global magnetic field on\nviscously-rotating and vertically-integrated accretion disks around compact\nobjects using a self-similar treatment, and use two methods to study magnetized\nflows with convection.

Nature seems to provide a pathway\nfor the formation of these exotic binaries, and a number of key questions need\nto be addressed: How do massive black holes pair in a merger? Depending on the\nproperties of the underlying galaxies, do black holes always form a close\nKeplerian binary? If a binary forms, does hardening proceed down to the domain\ncontrolled by gravitational wave back reaction? What is the role played by gas\nand/or stars in braking the black holes, and on which timescale does\ncoalescence occur? Can the black holes accrete on flight and shine during their\npathway to coalescence? N-Body/hydrodynamical codes have proven to be vital\ntools for studying their evolution, and progress in this field is expected to\ngrow rapidly in the effort to describe, in full realism, the physics of stars\nand gas around the black holes, starting from the cosmological large scale of a\nmerger.

Structures on the stellar photosphere have been detected in the\nvisible and near-infrared as well as a compact molecular environment called the\nMOLsphere. Mid-infrared observations have revealed the nature of some of the\nmolecules in the MOLsphere, some being the precursor of dust. Aims: Betelgeuse\nis an excellent candidate to understand the process of mass loss in red\nsupergiants. Using diffraction-limited adaptive optics (AO) in the\nnear-infrared, we probe the photosphere and close environment of Betelgeuse to\nstudy the wavelength dependence of its extension, and to search for\nasymmetries. Methods: We obtained AO images with the VLT/NACO instrument,\ntaking advantage of the \"cube\" mode of the CONICA camera to record separately a\nlarge number of short-exposure frames. This allowed us to adopt a \"lucky\nimaging\" approach for the data reduction, and obtain diffraction-limited images\nover the spectral range 1.04-2.17 $\\mu$m in 10 narrow-band filters. Results: In\nall filters, the photosphere of Betelgeuse appears partly resolved. We identify\nan asymmetric envelope around the star, with in particular a relatively bright\n\"plume\" extending in the southwestern quadrant up to a radius of approximately\nsix times the photosphere. The CN molecule provides an excellent match to the\n1.09 mic bandhead in absorption in front of the stellar photosphere, but the\nemission spectrum of the plume is more difficult to interpret. Conclusions: Our\nAO images show that the envelope surrounding Betelgeuse has a complex and\nirregular structure. We propose that the southwestern plume is linked either to\nthe presence of a convective hot spot on the photosphere, or to the rotation of\nthe star. \n\n"}

In our approach, we evolve the canonical\nmomentum and the canonical energy per baryon and thus circumvent some of the\nproblems that have plagued earlier formulations of relativistic SPH. We further\nuse a much improved artificial viscosity prescription which uses the extreme\nlocal eigenvalues of the Euler equations and triggers selectively on a) shocks\nand b) velocity noise. The shock trigger accurately monitors the relative\ndensity slope and uses it to fine-tune the amount of artificial viscosity that\nis applied. This procedure substantially sharpens shock fronts while still\navoiding post-shock noise. If not triggered, the viscosity parameter of each\nparticle decays to zero. None of these viscosity triggers is specific to\nspecial relativity, both could also be applied in Newtonian SPH. The\nperformance of the new scheme is explored in a large variety of benchmark tests\nwhere it delivers excellent results. Generally, the grad-h terms deliver minor,\nthough worthwhile, improvements.

In particular, the outer Galactic halo contains GCs with redder HBs\nat a given metallicity than are found inside the Solar circle. Thus, at least a\nsecond parameter is required to characterize HB morphology.

Analysis of this homogeneous data set reveals that, after the influence\nof metallicity has been removed, the correlation between d(V-I) and age is\nstronger than that of any other parameter considered. Expanding the sample to\ninclude HST photometry of the 6 most distant Galactic GCs lends additional\nsupport to the correlation between d(V-I) and age.

We study a toy model where the flow behind a planar\nstationary accretion shock is adiabatically decelerated by an external\npotential. Two magnetic field geometries are considered: parallel or\nperpendicular to the shock. The entropy-vorticity wave, which is simply\nadvected in the unmagnetized limit, separates into five different waves: the\nentropy perturbations are advected, while the vorticity can propagate along the\nfield lines through two Alfven waves and two slow magnetosonic waves. The two\ncycles existing in the unmagnetized limit, advective-acoustic and purely\nacoustic, are replaced by up to six distinct MHD cycles.

We describe a procedure for identifying locations in\nkinematically hot environments where the light is dominated by a single star,\nand apply this method to spectra with 0.1 arcsec angular resolution covering\nthe 2.1 - 2.3 micron interval in the central regions of M32.

Three locations where at least 60% of the K-band light comes from\na single bright star, and another with light that is dominated by two stars\nwith very different velocities, are identified. The dominant stars are evolving\nnear the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), and have M5 III spectral\ntype. The lack of a dispersion in spectral-type suggests that the upper AGB\nwithin the central arcsec of M32 has a dispersion in J-K of only a few\nhundreths of a magnitude, in agreement with what is seen at larger radii.

Previous attempts to\nmeasure such deficits depended on fitting some functional form to the profile\nat large radii and extrapolating inwards; this is sensitive to the assumed\nfunctional form and does not allow for variation in nuclear profile shapes. We\ntake advantage of larger data sets to directly construct stellar mass profiles\nof observed systems and measure the stellar mass enclosed in a series of\nphysical radii (M(<R)), for samples of cusp and core spheroids at the same\nstellar mass. There is a significant bimodality in this distribution at small\nradii, and we non-parametrically measure the median offset between core and\ncusp populations (the deficit Delta_M(<R)). We construct the scoured mass\nprofile as a function of radius, without reference to any assumed functional\nform. The mass deficit rises in power-law fashion (Delta_M(<R) R^{1.3-1.8})\nfrom a significant but small mass at R<10pc, to asymptote to a maximum ~0.5-2\nM_BH at ~100pc.

The source exhibits\ntwo distinct states: the hard state shows emission from 1 to 150 keV, while the\nsoft state is mostly confined to be $<40$ keV. We model soft-state continuum\nspectra with two thermal components, one of which is a multicolor accretion\ndisk and the other is a single-temperature blackbody to describe the boundary\nlayer, with additional weak Comptonization represented by either a simple power\nlaw or the SIMPL model by Steiner et al. The hard-state continuum spectra are\nmodeled by a single-temperature blackbody for the boundary layer plus strong\nComptonization, modeled by a cutoff power law. While we are unable to draw firm\nconclusions about the physical properties of the disk in the hard state, the\naccretion disk in the soft state appears to approximately follow $L\\propto\nT^{3.2}$. The deviation from $L\\propto T^4$, as expected from a constant inner\ndisk radius, might be caused by a luminosity-dependent spectral hardening\nfactor and/or real changes of the inner disk radius in some part of the soft\nstate. The boundary layer apparent emission area is roughly constant from the\nhard to the soft states, with a value of about 1/11 of the neutron star\nsurface. The magnetic field on the surface of the NS in 4U~1705--44 is\nestimated to be less than about $1.9\\times 10^8$ G, assuming that the disk is\ntruncated by the ISCO or by the neutron star surface.

The purpose of this joint study is to robustly assess the possibility\nof significant offsets, a hallmark of the compact object binary merger model.\nFive such events exist in the current sample of 20 short bursts with optical\nafterglows, and we find that their optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission are\nsystematically fainter. These differences may be due to lower circumburst\ndensities (by about an order of magnitude), to higher redshifts (by dz~0.5-1),\nor to lower energies, although in the standard GRB model the smaller gamma-ray\nfluences cannot be explained by lower densities. To study the large-scale\nenvironments we use deep optical observations to place limits on underlying\nhosts and to determine probabilities of chance coincidence for galaxies near\neach burst. In 4 of the 5 cases the lowest probabilities of chance coincidence\n(P(<dR)~0.1) are associated with bright galaxies at separations of dR~10\",\nwhile somewhat higher probabilities of chance coincidence are associated with\nfaint galaxies at separations of ~2\".

Alternatively, the limits at the burst positions (>26 mag) can be\nexplained by typical short GRB host galaxies (L~0.1-1 L*) at z>2. Thus, two\npossibilities exist: (i) ~1/4 of short GRBs explode ~50 kpc or ~15 kpc from the\ncenters of z~0.3 or z>1 galaxies, respectively, and have fainter afterglows due\nto the resulting lower densities; or (ii) ~1/4 of short GRBs occur at z>2 and\nhave fainter afterglows due to their higher redshifts. \n\n"}

A key challenge for such models is to fit\nthe detailed spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We present a\ndetailed discussion of the small-scale CMB in an inhomogeneous universe,\nfocusing on spherically symmetric `void' models.

In light of the last decade of\ndiscovery in the field of PN, we revise this framework, which, although\nsimplistic, can still serve as a benchmark against which to test theories of PN\norigin and shaping. Within the framework, we revisit the role of planets in\nshaping PN. Soker invoked a planetary role in shaping PN because there are not\nenough close binaries to shape the large fraction of non-spherical PN. In this\npaper we adopt a model whereby only ~20% of all 1-8 solar mass stars make a PN.\nThis reduces the need for planetary shaping. Through a propagation of\npercentages argument, and starting from the assumption that planets can only\nshape mildly elliptical PN, we conclude, like in Soker, that ~20% of all PN\nwere shaped via planetary and other substellar interactions but we add that\nthis corresponds to only ~5% of all 1-8 solar mass stars.

They appear like spiral galaxies\nwith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals with\ndisky isophotes. Fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range of\nbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. The slow rotators are rounder and are\ngenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, elliptical\ngalaxies. We propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by Hubble as it\ngives a misleading description of ETGs. We study for the first time the\nkinematic morphology-density T-Sigma relation using fast and slow rotators to\nreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. We find that our relation is cleaner than\nusing classic morphology. Slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest density\nenvironments [f(SR)<2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(SR)~4%] of\nthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, with\nthe exception of the densest core of the Virgo cluster [f(SR)~20%]. We find a\nclean log-linear relation between the fraction f(Sp) of spiral galaxies and the\nlocal galaxy surface density. The existence of a smooth kinematic T-Sigma\nrelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment as\nmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators in\nlow-density environments. It shows that the segregation is driven by local\neffects at the small-group scale. Only at the largest densities in the Virgo\ncore does the f(Sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while the\nfraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. This suggests that\na different mechanism is at work there. (Abridged) \n\n"}

Since isolated population III stars are\nlikely to be beyond the reach of JWST, small population III galaxies may offer\nthe best prospects of directly probing the properties of metal-free stars.\nHere, we present Yggdrasil, a new spectral synthesis code geared towards the\nfirst galaxies.

The approach assumes that all\nthese quantities can be mapped to problems involving the first crossing\ndistribution of a suitably chosen barrier by random walks. Most analytic\nexpressions for these distributions ignore the fact that, although different\nk-modes in the initial Gaussian field are uncorrelated, this is not true in\nreal space: the values of the density field at a given spatial position, when\nsmoothed on different real-space scales, are correlated in a nontrivial way. As\na result, the problem is to estimate first crossing distribution by random\nwalks having correlated rather than uncorrelated steps. In 1990, Peacock &\nHeavens presented a simple approximation for the first crossing distribution of\na single barrier of constant height by walks with correlated steps. We show\nthat their approximation can be thought of as a correction to the distribution\nassociated with what we call smooth completely correlated walks.

For the latter, we show that a simple rescaling, inspired by bivariate\nGaussian statistics, of the unconditional first crossing distribution,\naccurately describes the conditional distribution, independently of the choice\nof analytical prescription for the former.

Here we demonstrate that the OIR colour-magnitude\ndiagrams (CMDs) of the evolution of the X-ray transient XTE J1550-564 in\noutburst can be used to separate the disc from the jet. Monitoring in two\nwavebands is all that is required. This outburst in 2000 was well studied, and\nboth disc and jet were known to contribute. During the outburst the data follow\na well defined path in the CMD, describing what would be expected from a heated\nsingle-temperature blackbody of approximately constant area, except when the\ndata appear redder than this track. This is due to the non-thermal jet\ncomponent which dominates the OIR moreso during hard X-ray states at high\nluminosities, and which is quenched in the soft state. The CMD therefore shows\nstate-dependent hysteresis, in analogy with (but not identical to) the well\nestablished X-ray hardness-intensity diagram of black hole transients.

The goal is to provide\na rigorous methodology for verifying a code on two dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability. We ran the problem in the Pencil Code, Athena, Enzo, NDSPHMHD, and\nPhurbas. A strict comparison, judgment, or ranking, between codes is beyond the\nscope of this work, though this work provides the mathematical framework needed\nfor such a study. Nonetheless, how the test is posed circumvents the issues\nraised by tests starting from a sharp contact discontinuity yet it still shows\nthe poor performance of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. We then comment on the\nconnection between this behavior to the underlying lack of zeroth-order\nconsistency in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics interpolation. We comment on the\ntendency of some methods, particularly those with very low numerical diffusion,\nto produce secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz billows on similar tests. Though the lack\nof a fixed, physical diffusive scale in the Euler equations lies at the root of\nthe issue, we suggest that in some methods an extra diffusion operator should\nbe used to damp the growth of instabilities arising from grid noise.

Since metal-poor planets are less dense and have larger radii than\nmetal-rich planets of the same mass, one might expect that metal-poor stars\nhost a higher proportion of gas giants with large radii than metal-rich stars.\nHere I present evidence for a negative correlation at the 2.3-sigma level\nbetween eclipse depth and stellar metallicity in the Kepler gas giant\ncandidates. Based on Kendall's tau statistics, the probability that eclipse\ndepth depends on star metallicity is 0.981. The correlation is consistent with\nplanets orbiting low-metallicity stars being, on average, larger in comparison\nwith their host stars than planets orbiting metal-rich stars. Furthermore,\nsince metal-rich stars have smaller radii than metal-poor stars of the same\nmass and age, a uniform population of planets should show a rise in median\neclipse depth with [M/H]. The fact that I find the opposite trend indicates\nthat substantial changes in gas giant interior structure must accompany\nincreasing [M/H].

This paper attempts to charts a course toward \"linked view\"\nsystems, where multiple views of high-dimensional data sets update live as a\nresearcher selects, highlights, or otherwise manipulates, one of several open\nviews. For example, imagine a researcher looking at a 3D volume visualization\nof simulated or observed data, and simultaneously viewing statistical displays\nof the data set's properties (such as an x-y plot of temperature vs. velocity,\nor a histogram of vorticities).

Our results show that the\nmotion of the knots is essentially ballistic, with the exception of the\nfarthest knots, which trace the large scale C-shape bending of the jet. The\nobserved bending of the jet can be produced by a relative motion of the HH 30\nstar with respect to its surrounding environment, caused either by a possible\nproper motion of the HH 30 star, or by the entrainment of environment gas by\nthe red lobe of the nearby L1551-IRS 5 outflow. Alternatively, the bending can\nbe produced by the stellar wind from a nearby CTTS, identified in the 2MASS\ncatalog. The proper motion velocities of the knots of the counterjet show more\nvariations than those of the jet. In particular, we identify two knots of the\ncounterjet that have the same kinematic age but whose velocities differ by\nalmost a factor of two. Thus, it appears that counterjet knots launched\nsimultaneously can be ejected with very different velocities.

Crossing the phantom divide happens due to a new type of\nthe neutrino DE effect where neutrinos pass through the state with zero mass\nand with the vacuum-like EoS P_{\\nu}=-\\rho_{\\nu}. \n\n"}

The X-ray heating and radiation pressure on the gas are\nexplicitly calculated using a ray-tracing method. This radiation feedback\ndrives a \"fountain\", that is, a vertical circulation of gas in the central a\nfew to tens parsecs. Interaction between the non-steady outflows and inflows\ncauses the formation of a geometrically thick torus with internal turbulent\nmotion. As a result, the AGN is obscured for a wide range of solid angles. In a\nquasi-steady state, the opening angles for the column density toward a black\nhole < 10^23 cm^-2 are approximately +-30 deg and +-50 deg for AGNs with 10%\nand 1% Eddington luminosity, respectively. Mass inflows through the torus\ncoexist with the outflow and internal turbulent motion, and the average mass\naccretion rate to the central parsec region is 2x10^-4 ~ 10^-3, M_sun/yr this\nis about ten times smaller than accretion rate required to maintain the AGN\nluminosity.

The ensuing collision between the fast ejecta and the CSM causes an\nincrease in brightness observed at the end of 1844, followed by a sustained\nhigh-luminosity phase lasting for 10-15 years that matches the historical light\ncurve. The emergent luminosity is powered by CSM interaction, analogous to the\nprocess in luminous Type IIn supernovae, except with 10 times lower explosion\nenergy and at slower speeds (causing a longer duration and lower emergent\nluminosity). Such an explosive event provides a natural explanation for the\nlight curve evolution, but also accounts for a number of puzzling attributes of\nthe Homunculus nebula: (1) rough equipartition of total radiated and kinetic\nenergy, (2) the double-shell structure of the Homunculus, (3) the apparent\nsingle age and Hubble-like flow resulting from the thin swept-up shell, (4) the\ncomplex mottled appearance of the polar lobes in HST images, arising from\nRaleigh-Taylor or Vishniac instabilities, (5) efficient and rapid dust\nformation, as seen in Type IIn supernovae, and (6) the fast (5000 km/s)\nmaterial outside the Homunculus, arising from the acceleration of the forward\nshock upon exiting the dense CSM.

If the HCCs constitute a certain fraction of it, their angular size\ndistribution has a specified shape. A fit to the data deduced from the SMC/LMC\nmaps supports this and yields for their radius 2.5 pc, with a small change when\nallowing for a spread in HCC radii. There are so many HCCs that they will make\nup all the missing Halo mass density if there is spherical symmetry and their\naverage mass is of order 15,000 Mo.

Recently, the IceCube collaboration announced the detection of a first\ndiffuse signal of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos. Directional information\ncannot unambiguously reveal the nature of the sources at this point due to low\nstatistics. A number of events come from close to the Galactic center and one\nof the main questions is whether at least a part of the signal can be of\nGalactic nature. In this paper, we show that the diffuse flux from\nwell-resolved SNRs is at least a factor of 20 below the observed flux. \n\n"}

Spectral and polarization parameters are derived from\nmultiwavelength data from existing radio surveys carried out at wavelengths\nbetween 6 and 92cm. In particular for the source G152.4-2.1 we also use new\nobservations at 11cm done with the Effelsberg 100m telescope.

The recently demonstrated correlation\nbetween timing noise and variation of pulse profile motivates us to further\ninvestigate its origins. We suggest that the quasi-periodicity feature of\ntiming noise, with rapid oscillations lying on lower frequency structure, comes\nfrom the geodetic precession of an unseen binary system, which induces\nadditional motion of the pulsar spin axis. The resultant change of azimuth and\nlatitude at which the observer's line of sight crosses the emission beam is\nresponsible for the variation of timing noise and pulse profile respectively.\nThe first numerical simulation to both timing noise and pulse profile variation\nare thus performed, from which the orbital periods of these pulsars are of 1-35\nminutes. Considering the existence of the ultracompact binary white dwarf of\norbital period of 5.4 minute, HM Cancri, such orbital periods to pulsar\nbinaries are not strange. The change of latitude of the magnetic moment\nexceeding the range of emission beam of a pulsar results in the intermittency,\nwhich explains the behavior of PSR B1931+24. Therefore, it provides not only a\nmechanism of the quasi-periodic feature displayed on some ``singular\" pulsars,\nlike timing noise, variation of pulse profile and intermittency; but also a new\napproach of searching ultra-compact binaries, possibly pulsar-black hole binary\nsystems. \n\n"}

When a star is disrupted in a bound\norbit with moderate eccentricity instead of a parabolic orbit, the temporal\nbehavior of the resulting stellar debris changes qualitatively. The debris is\ninitially all bound, returning to pericenter in a short time ~ the original\nstellar orbital timescale. The resulting fallback rate can thus be much higher\nthan the Eddington rate. Furthermore if the star is disrupted close to the\nhole, in a regime where general relativity is important, the stellar and debris\norbits display general relativistic precession. Apsidal precession can make the\ndebris stream cross itself after several orbits, likely leading to fast debris\nenergy dissipation. If the star is disrupted in an inclined orbit around a\nspinning hole, nodal precession reduces the probability of self-intersection,\nand circularization may take many dynamical timescales, delaying the onset of\nflare activity. An examination of the particle dynamics suggests that\nquasi-periodic flares with short durations, produced when the center of the\ntidal stream passes pericenter, may occur in the early-time light curve. The\nlate-time light curve may still show power-law behavior which is generic to\ndisk accretion processes. The detection triggers for future surveys should be\nextended to capture such \"non-standard\" short-term flaring activity before the\nevent enters the asymptotic decay phase, as this activity is likely to be more\nsensitive to physical parameters such as the black hole spin. \n\n"}

The flow structure is\ngeometrically thick, and independent of the gas density and cooling, if the\ncooling time is longer than the viscous timescale (i.e., $t_{\\rm cool} \\gtrsim\nt_{\\rm visc}$). For higher densities, the gas can cool before it can accrete\nand forms the standard geometrically thin, optically thick Shakura-Sunyaev\ndisk. For usual cooling processes (such as bremsstrahlung), we expect an inner\nhot flow and an outer thin disk. For a short cooling time the accretion flow\nseparates into two phases: a radiatively inefficient hot coronal phase and a\ncold thin disk. We argue that there is an upper limit on the density of the hot\ncorona corresponding to a critical value of $t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff} (\\sim\n10-100)$, the ratio of the cooling time and the free-fall time. Based on our\nsimulations, we have developed a model for transients observed in black hole\nX-ray binaries (XRBs). An XRB in a quiescent hot RIAF state can transition to a\ncold black-body dominated state because of an increase in the mass accretion\nrate. The transition from a thin disk to a RIAF happens because of mass\nexhaustion due to accretion; the transition happens when the cooling time\nbecomes longer than the viscous time at inner radii. Since the viscous\ntimescale for a geometrically thin disk is quite long, the high-soft state is\nexpected to be long-lived. The different timescales in black hole transients\ncorrespond to different physical processes such as viscous evolution, cooling,\nand free-fall.

The present study aims at characterizing the\nvariation of the molecular outflow properties with time, and at studying the\nSiO excitation conditions in outflows associated with massive YSOs.

Such constraints are independent of\nthe radial velocity (RV) analysis recently performed by Weiss and coworkers,\nand valuable in examining the reliability of the parameter estimate using TTVs.\nWe numerically fit the observed TTVs of KOI-94c, KOI-94d, and KOI-94e for their\nmasses, eccentricities, and longitudes of periastrons, and obtain the best-fit\nparameters including $m_{\\rm c} = 9.4_{-2.1}^{+2.4} M_{\\oplus}$, $m_{\\rm d} =\n52.1_{-7.1}^{+6.9} M_{\\oplus}$, $m_{\\rm e} = 13.0_{-2.1}^{+2.5} M_{\\oplus}$,\nand $e \\lesssim 0.1$ for all the three planets.

The hope is that a combination of a low-noise\nseismic environment and coherent noise subtraction using seismometers in the\nvicinity of the detector could suppress the Newtonian noise to below the\nprojected noise floor for future gravitational-wave detectors. In this paper,\nwe use Wiener filtering techniques to subtract coherent noise in a seismic\narray in the frequency band 0.05 -- 1\\,Hz. This achieves more than an order of\nmagnitude noise cancellation over a majority of this band. We show how this\nsubtraction would benefit proposed future low-frequency gravitational wave\ndetectors. The variation in the Wiener filter coefficients over the course of\nthe day, including how local activities impact the filter, is analyzed. We also\nstudy the variation in coefficients over the course of a month, showing the\nstability of the filter with time. How varying the filter order affects the\nsubtraction performance is also explored. It is shown that optimizing filter\norder can significantly improve subtraction of seismic noise, which gives hope\nfor future gravitational-wave detectors to address Newtonian noise. \n\n"}

This characteristic\nspectral energy distribution indicates the presence of an optically thin inner\ncavity within the dust disk believed to mark the disappearance of the\nprimordial massive disk. We present new Herschel Space Observatory PACS spectra\nof [OI] 63 micron for 21 transitional disks. Our survey complements the larger\nHerschel GASPS program \"Gas in Protoplanetary Systems\" (Dent et al. 2013) by\nquadrupling the number of transitional disks observed with PACS at this\nwavelength. [OI] 63 micron traces material in the outer regions of the disk,\nbeyond the inner cavity of most transitional disks. We find that transitional\ndisks have [OI] 63 micron line luminosities two times fainter than their full\ndisk counterparts. We self consistently determine various stellar properties\n(e.g. bolometric luminosity, FUV excess, etc.) and disk properties (e.g. disk\ndust mass, etc.) that could influence the [OI] 63 micron line luminosity and we\nfind no correlations that can explain the lower [OI] 63 micron line\nluminosities in transitional disks. Using a grid of thermo-chemical\nprotoplanetary disk models, we conclude that either transitional disks are less\nflared than full disks or they possess lower gas-to-dust ratios due to a\ndepletion of gas mass. This result suggests that transitional disks are more\nevolved than their full disk counterparts, possibly even at large radii. \n\n"}

Abstract: This paper explores if the mean properties of Early-Type Galaxies (ETG) can\nbe reconstructed from \"genetic\" information stored in their GCs (i.e., in their\nchemical abundances, spatial distributions and ages). This approach implies\nthat the formation of each globular occurs in very massive stellar\nenvironments, as suggested by some models that aim at explaining the presence\nof multi-populations in these systems. The assumption that the relative number\nof globular clusters to diffuse stellar mass depends exponentially on chemical\nabundance, [Z/H], and the presence of two dominant GC sub-populations blue and\nred, allows the mapping of low metallicity halos and of higher metallicity (and\nmore heterogeneous) bulges. In particular, the masses of the low-metallicity\nhalos seem to scale up with dark matter mass through a constant.

Generally, the\nproblem is mathematically under-determined unless a set of closures (Eddington\ncoefficients) is specified. We demonstrate that the hemispheric (or\nhemi-isotropic) closure naturally derives from the radiative transfer equation\nif energy conservation is obeyed, while the Eddington closure produces spurious\nenhancements of both reflected light and thermal emission.

Secular interactions transfer\nangular momentum between inner and outer orbits unless their apsidal lines are\nparallel or anti-parallel. These choices correspond, respectively, to\northogonal eigenmodes p and a. Each is characterized by an eccentricity ratio\nset by the masses and semi-major axes, i.e., $e_{p, 1}/e_{p, 2}\\sim a_1/a_2$\nwhile $e_{a, 1}/e_{a, 2}\\sim (a_1/a_2)^{-3/2}(m_2/m_1)$. Mode p dominates the\nsystem's current state so $e_1/e_2$ always remains close to $e_{p, 1}/e_{p,\n2}$. A small contribution by Mode a causes $e_1$ and $e_2$ to oscillate with\nperiod $\\sim 10^3\\,\\yr$. Orbital changes should be apparent in a few years.\nThese will reveal the forcing of the apsidal precession of the inner orbit by\ngeneral relativity (GR), and possibly also the smaller contribution due to the\ntidal and rotational distortion of the inner white dwarf (WD). Phinney (1992)\nproposes that the epicyclic energy of a WD-pulsar binary reaches equipartition\nwith the kinetic energy of a single convective eddy when the WD's progenitor\nfills its Roche lobe.

Using this approach, an accurate accounting of the timings and\nproperties of the individual SSPs composing model galaxies is possible. We\nanalyse the dependence of our chemical model on various ingredients, and apply\nit to six simulated haloes of roughly Milky Way mass and with no massive close\nneighbour at z=0. For all models considered, the [Fe/H] distributions of the\nstars in the disc component are in good agreement with Milky Way data, while\nfor the spheroid component (whose formation we model only through mergers)\nthese are offset low with respect to observational measurements for the Milky\nWay bulge.

But sources of new random information do exist; e.g., a central black\nhole with an accretion disk and jets could in principle broadcast small-scale\nquantum fluctuations over a substantial portion of a galaxy.\n  A speculative example of how this concept might be useful is in\ndifferentiating between warm (WDM) and cold (CDM) dark matter.

Determination of the fundamental interactions that\ngovern matter under such extreme conditions is one of the major unsolved\nproblems of modern physics, and -- since it is impossible to replicate these\nconditions on Earth -- a major scientific motivation for SKA. The most\nstringent observational constraints come from measurements of NS bulk\nproperties: each model for the microscopic behaviour of matter predicts a\nspecific density-pressure relation (its `Equation of state', EOS). This\ngenerates a unique mass-radius relation which predicts a characteristic radius\nfor a large range of masses and a maximum mass above which NS collapse to black\nholes. It also uniquely predicts other bulk quantities, like maximum spin\nfrequency and moment of inertia.

The progenitor is a nonrotating,\nzero-metallicity 9.6 Msun star with an iron core. While in spherical symmetry\noutward shock acceleration sets in later than 300 ms after bounce, a successful\nexplosion starts at ~130 ms postbounce in two dimensions (2D). The 3D model\nexplodes at about the same time but with faster shock expansion than in 2D and\na more quickly increasing and roughly 10 percent higher explosion energy of\n>10^50 erg. The more favorable explosion conditions in 3D are explained by\nlower temperatures and thus reduced neutrino emission in the cooling layer\nbelow the gain radius. This moves the gain radius inward and leads to a bigger\nmass in the gain layer, whose larger recombination energy boosts the explosion\nenergy in 3D. These differences are caused by less coherent, less massive, and\nless rapid convective downdrafts associated with postshock convection in 3D.\nThe less violent impact of these accretion downflows in the cooling layer\nproduces less shock heating and therefore diminishes energy losses by neutrino\nemission.

Assuming an incorrect cosmological model to convert\ngalaxy redshifts to distances, the shape of $\\xi(\\mu)$ appears anisotropic due\nto the AP effect, and the amplitude shifted by the change in comoving volume.\nDue to the redshift dependence of the AP and volume effect, both the shape and\namplitude of $\\xi(\\mu)$ exhibit redshift dependence.

Within error limits, it may\neither be a brown dwarf or a late M-type dwarf.\n  We aim to extract the secondary's contribution to the phase-dependent\ncomposite spectra. The spectrum and identified lines of the secondary decide on\nits nature.\n  In January 2014, we measured the phase-dependent spectrum of AA Dor with\nXSHOOTER over one complete orbital period. Since the secondary's rotation is\npresumable synchronized with the orbital period, its surface strictly divides\ninto a day and night side. Therefore, we may obtain the spectrum of its cool\nside during its transit and of its hot, irradiated side close to its\noccultation. We developed the Virtual Observatory (VO) tool TLISA to search for\nweak lines of a faint companion in a binary system.\n  We identified 53 spectral lines of the secondary in the ultraviolet-blue,\nvisual, and near-infrared XSHOOTER spectra that are strongest close to its\noccultation. We identified 57 (20 additional) lines in available UVES\n(Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph) spectra from 2001.

The mass of the secondary is Msec = 0.081 (+0.018 /\n-0.010) Msun and, hence, it is not possible to reliably determine a brown dwarf\nor an M-type dwarf nature.\n  Although we identified many emission lines of the secondary's irradiated\nsurface, the resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of our UVES and XSHOOTER\nspectra are not good enough to extract a good spectrum of the secondary's\nnonirradiated hemisphere. \n\n"}

However, during the first two months, the $\\gtrsim 10^6$\nK brightness temperature at low frequencies was too high to be due to thermal\nemission from the small amount of X-ray producing shock-heated gas. Radio\nimaging showed structures with velocities of 400 km s$^{-1}$ (d/6 kpc) in the\nplane of the sky, perpendicular to a more elongated 1500 km s$^{-1}$ (d/6 kpc)\nflow. The morpho-kinematic structure of the ejecta from V1723 Aql appears\nsimilar to nova V959 Mon, where collisions between a slow torus and a faster\nflow collimated the fast flow and gave rise to \\gamma -ray producing shocks.\nOptical spectroscopy and X-ray observations of V1723 Aql during the radio flare\nare consistent with this picture. Our observations support the idea that shocks\nin novae occur when a fast flow collides with a slow collimating torus.

In this manuscript, we assume that the shock revival is\ninitiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition\nfor spherically symmetric shock expansion, $v_s > 0$.

For this reason, the evolution of SMBHBs\nin merging galaxies is an essential problem.

Events can be analysed either monoscopically (i.e. using\nonly information of CT5) or stereoscopically (requiring at least two triggered\ntelescopes per event). To achieve a good performance, a sophisticated event\nreconstruction and analysis framework is indispensable.

Their bright phases typically last\nfor 100~d or less, rather than persisting for several years.

Previous global climate model\n(GCM) studies have shown that, for slowly-rotating planets, strong convection\nat the substellar point can create optically thick water clouds, increasing the\nplanetary albedo, and thus stabilizing the climate against a thermal runaway.\nHowever these studies did not use self-consistent orbital/rotational periods\nfor synchronously rotating planets placed at different distances from the host\nstar. Here we provide new estimates of the inner edge of the habitable zone for\nsynchronously rotating terrestrial planets around late-K and M-dwarf stars\nusing a 3-D Earth-analog GCM with self-consistent relationships between stellar\nmetallicity, stellar effective temperature, and the planetary\norbital/rotational period. We find that both atmospheric dynamics and the\nefficacy of the substellar cloud deck are sensitive to the precise rotation\nrate of the planet. Around mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with low metallicity,\nplanetary rotation rates at the inner edge of the HZ become faster, and the\ninner edge of the habitable zone is farther away from the host stars than in\nprevious GCM studies. For an Earth-sized planet, the dynamical regime of the\nsubstellar clouds begins to transition as the rotation rate approaches ~10\ndays. These faster rotation rates produce stronger zonal winds that encircle\nthe planet and smear the substellar clouds around it, lowering the planetary\nalbedo, and causing the onset of the water-vapor greenhouse climatic\ninstability to occur at up to ~25% lower incident stellar fluxes than found in\nprevious GCM studies. For mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with high metallicity and\nfor mid-K to early-M stars, we agree with previous studies. \n\n"}

We propose that the\ntransformation of NSCs into SMBHs occurs via runaway tidal captures, once NSCs\nexceed a certain critical central density and velocity dispersion. The\nbottleneck in this process, as with all collisional runaways, is growing the\nfirst e-fold in black hole mass. The growth of a stellar mass black hole past\nthis bottleneck occurs as tidally captured stars are consumed in repeated\nepisodes of mass transfer at pericenter. Tidal captures may turn off as a\ngrowth channel once the black hole reaches a mass ~100-1000 solar masses, but\ntidal disruption events will continue and appear capable of growing the seed\nSMBH to larger sizes. The runaway slows (becomes sub-exponential) once the seed\nSMBH consumes the core of its host NSC. While the bulk of the cosmic mass\ndensity in SMBHs is ultimately produced (via the Soltan-Paczynski argument) by\nepisodic gaseous accretion in very massive galaxies, the smallest SMBHs have\nprobably grown from strong tidal encounters with NSC stars. SMBH seeds that\ngrow for a time $t$ entirely through this channel will follow simple power law\nrelations with the velocity dispersion, $\\sigma$, of their host galaxy.

These two possibilities are\nequivalents, because both can emulate the same quantity of dark matter.\nHowever, in both cases, the central mechanism is the Davies-Unruh effect, this\nseems to indicate that the modification of the Davies-Unruh effect emulates\ndark matter which in turn can be see as a violation of the equivalence\nprinciple.

Through\nimage stacking and improved PSF fitting we push the completeness limit about\none magnitude deeper than in previous, comparable work. Contrary to previous\nwork, we analyse the stellar density in well-defined magnitude ranges in order\nto be able to constrain stellar masses and ages. The RC and brighter giant\nstars display a core-like surface density profile within a projected radius\nR<0.3 pc of the central black hole, in agreement with previous studies, but\nshow a cusp-like surface density distribution at larger R. The surface density\nof the fainter stars can be described well by a single power-law at R<2 pc. The\ncusp-like profile of the faint stars persists even if we take into account the\npossible contamination of stars in this brightness range by young pre-main\nsequence stars. The data are inconsistent with a core-profile for the faint\nstars.Finally, we show that a 3D Nuker law provides a very good description of\nthe cluster structure. We conclude that the observed stellar density at the\nGalactic Centre, as it can be inferred with current instruments, is consistent\nwith the existence of a stellar cusp around the Milky Way's central black hole,\nSgr A*.

The apparent lack of RC stars and brighter giants at\nprojected distances of R < 0.3 pc (R<8\") of the massive black hole may indicate\nthat some mechanism has altered their distribution or intrinsic luminosity. \n\n"}

We investigate here\nwhether the impact of the stellar metallicity on the evolution of the tidal\ndissipation inside the convective envelope of rotating stars and its resulting\neffect on the planetary migration might be a possible explanation for this\nobserved statistical trend.\n  We use a frequency-averaged tidal dissipation formalism coupled to an orbital\nevolution code and to rotating stellar evolution models to estimate the effect\nof a change of stellar metallicity on the evolution of close-in planets. We\nconsider here two different stellar masses: 0.4 and 1.0 $M_{\\odot}$ evolving\nfrom the early pre-main sequence phase up to the red giant branch.\n  We show that the metallicity of a star has a strong effect on the stellar\nparameters which in turn strongly influence the tidal dissipation in the\nconvective region.

If the BH spin magnitudes are large then (i) either\nboth BH spin vectors must be nearly in the orbital plane or (ii) the spin\nangular momenta of the BHs must be oppositely directed and similar in\nmagnitude.

In\nthe Standard Model before EWPT, the leptogenesis is well known to be driven by\nthe abelian anomaly in a massless hypercharge field. The generation of the\nneutrino asymmetry in the Higgs phase after EWPT, in its turn, has not been\nconsidered previously because of the absence of any quantum anomaly in an\nexternal electromagnetic field for such electroneutral particles as neutrino,\nunlike the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly for charged left and right polarized\nmassless electrons in the same electromagnetic field. Using the neutrino\nBoltzmann equation, modified by the Berry curvature term in the momentum space,\nwe establish the violation of the macroscopic neutrino current in plasma after\nEWPT and exactly reproduce the nonconservation of the lepton current in the\nsymmetric phase before EWPT arising in quantum field theory due to the nonzero\nlepton hypercharge and corresponding triangle anomaly in an external\nhypercharge field. In the last case, the non-conservation of the lepton current\nis derived through the kinetic approach without a computation of corresponding\nFeynman diagrams.

We compare the Landau-damped turbulent\ncascade model used in previous work with a new prescription we introduce based\non the results of particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic reconnection. With\nthe turbulent heating model, electrons are preferentially heated in the polar\noutflow, whereas with the reconnection model electrons are heated by nearly the\nsame fraction everywhere in the accretion flow.

Following Paper I, here\nwe numerically study the late stage of terrestrial planet formation, i.e., from\nembryos to full planets, in binary systems of various orbital configurations.\nWe identify an orbital alignment or anti-alignment effect; namely, although an\ninclined binary generally misaligns the planetary orbits with respect to the\nspin axis of the primary host star (i.e., causing large obliquity), it could\nalign or anti-align the planetary orbits with respect to the binary orbit. Such\nan orbital (anti-)alignment effect is caused by the combination of orbital\ndifferential precession and self-damping, and it is mostly significant in cases\nof intermediate binary separations, i.e., a_B~40-200 AU for terrestrial planet\nformation around 1 AU from the primary stars.

There are two main\ncontributing processes. 1) Lower mass galaxies are less rotationally supported.\nThis is confirmed observationally from the skewness of linewidths in bins of HI\nmass in both ALFALFA and HIPASS observations. 2) The HI distributions are less\nextended (relative to the dark matter halo) in dwarf galaxies. Coupled to the\nlower baryon-to-halo ratio results in rotation curves that are still rising at\nthe last measured data point, in agreement with observations from SPARC.\nCombining these two effects, in both simulations and observations lower mass\ngalaxies have on average lower W_50 / W_20.

Giant planets open gaps in their protoplanetary and subsequently\nsuffer so-called type II migration. Schematically, planets are thought to be\ntightly locked within their surrounding disks, and forced to follow the viscous\nadvection of gas onto the central star. This fundamental principle however has\nrecently been questioned, as migrating planets were shown to decouple from the\ngas' radial drift. Aims. In this framework, we question whether the\ntraditionally used linear scaling of migration rate of a giant planet with the\ndisk's viscosity still holds. Additionally, we assess the role of\norbit-crossing material as part of the decoupling mechanism. Methods. We have\nperformed 2D (r, {\\theta}) numerical simulations of point-mass planets embedded\nin locally isothermal {\\alpha}-disks in steady-state accretion, with various\nvalues of {\\alpha}. Arbitrary planetary accretion rates were used as a means to\ndiminish or nullify orbit-crossing flows. Results. We confirm that the\nmigration rate of a gap-opening planet is indeed proportional to the disk's\nviscosity, but is not equal to the gas drift speed in the unperturbed disk. We\nshow that the role of gap-crossing flows is in fact negligible. Conclusions.\nFrom these observations, we propose a new paradigm for type II migration : a\ngiant planet feels a torque from the disk that promotes its migration, while\nthe gap profile relative to the planet is restored on a viscous timescale, thus\nlimiting the planet migration rate to be proportional to the disk's viscosity.\nHence, in disks with low viscosity in the planet region, type II migration\nshould still be very slow.

The first gravitational-wave event GW170817 from a binary compact star\nmerger observed by the LIGO/VIRGO detectors have already put limits on the\ntidal deformability and provided constraints on the ultra-high nuclear density\nEOS. In view of this ground breaking discovery, we revisit and extend our\nprevious work [Phys. Rev.

Here we present a systematic analysis to search for\nthe GRBs that seem to show the transition from a fireball to the\nPoynting-flux-dominated outflow between well-separated pulses within a single\nburst, like the GRB 160626B, using the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data of the\n\\emph{Fermi} satellite.

Furthermore, based on the time-resolved spectra, we constrain the\noutflow properties for those thermal pulses and find them consistent with the\ntypical properties of the photosphere emission.

This state, which has been known to persist for\nyears, has recently been interpreted as emission from a shock that enshrouds\nthe pulsar. However, the pressure balance for such a configuration is a crucial\nunresolved issue. We consider two scenarios for pressure balance: a companion\nmagnetosphere and stellar mass loss with gas dominance. It is found that the\nmagnetospheric scenario requires several kilogauss poloidal fields for isobaric\nsurfaces to enshroud the MSP as well as for the magnetosphere to remain stable\nif there is significant mass loss.

Here, we provide a modern quantitative\nassessment of those relations, by modelling the rotation curves of galaxies\nfrom the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database with\nthe Einasto dark halo model. We focus in particular on the comparison between\nthe original SPARC parameters, with constant mass-to-light ratios for bulges\nand disks, and the parameters for which galaxies follow the tightest radial\nacceleration relation. We show that fits are improved in the second case, and\nthat the pure halo scaling relations also become tighter. We report that the\ndensity at the radius where the slope is -2 is strongly anticorrelated to this\nradius, and to the Einasto index. The latter is close to unity for a large\nnumber of galaxies, indicative of large cores. In terms of dark matter-baryon\nscalings, we focus on relations between the core properties and the extent of\nthe baryonic component, which are relevant to the cusp-core transformation\nprocess. We report a positive correlation between the core size of halos with\nsmall Einasto index and the stellar disk scale-length, as well as between the\naveraged dark matter density within 2 kpc and the baryon-induced rotational\nvelocity at that radius. This finding is related to the consequence of the\nradial acceleration relation on the diversity of rotation curve shapes,\nquantified by the rotational velocity at 2 kpc. While a tight radial\nacceleration relation slightly decreases the observed diversity compared to the\noriginal SPARC parameters, the diversity of baryon-induced accelerations at 2\nkpc is sufficient to induce a large diversity, incompatible with current\nhydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, while maintaining a tight\nradial acceleration relation. \n\n"}

The discovery is based on public HIRES\nradial velocity measurements taken at Keck Observatory between July 2007 and\nSeptember 2014. We estimate a stellar mass of 1.91$^{+0.09}_{-0.14}M_\\odot$ for\nHD202696, which is located close to the base of the red giant branch. A\ntwo-planet self-consistent dynamical modeling MCMC scheme of the radial\nvelocity data followed by a long-term stability test suggests planetary orbital\nperiods of $P_{\\rm b}$ = 517.8$_{-3.9}^{+8.9}$ days and $P_{\\rm c}$ =\n946.6$_{-20.9}^{+20.7}$ days, eccentricities of $e_{\\rm b}$ =\n0.011$_{-0.011}^{+0.078}$ and $e_{\\rm c}$ = 0.028$_{-0.012}^{+0.065}$ , and\nminimum dynamical masses of $m_{\\rm b}$ =\n2.00$_{-0.10}^{+0.22}$\\,$M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$ and $m_{\\rm c}$ =\n1.86$_{-0.23}^{+0.18}$,$M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$, respectively. Our stable MCMC\nsamples are consistent with orbital configurations predominantly in a mean\nperiod ratio of 11:6 and its close-by high order mean-motion commensurabilities\nwith low eccentricities.

The self-similar part of profile takes the form of a\ndouble power law with inner and outer exponents taking the values near -1.5 and\n-3 respectively. The precise value of the inner exponent depends on the\nmagnitude and duration of the noisy epoch and most likely on form of the inner\nprofile to start. The outer exponent is the result of evolution dominated by\nthe external l=1 multipole resulting from the inner halo's response to noise.\n  Three different noise processes are studied: (1) a bombardment by blobs of\nmass small compared to the halo mass (`shrapnel'); (2) orbital evolution of\nsubstructure by dynamical friction (`satellites'); and (3) noise caused by the\norbit of blobs in the halo (`black holes').

I present a simple\nanalytical model that describes the asymptotic behavior of the field in the\nstrong-expansion limit.

Converting between the Ly-alpha forest\nobservations and the linear mass power spectrum requires a careful treatment of\nnuisance parameters and modeling with cosmological simulations.

Spatial fluctuations in the decay rate of the inflaton field to\nordinary matter lead to fluctuations in the reheating temperature. We argue\nthat in most realistic models of inflation the coupling of the inflaton to\nnormal matter is determined by the vacuum expectation values of fields in the\ntheory. If those fields are light during inflation (this is a generic situation\nin the minimal models of supersymmetric inflation) they will fluctuate leading\nto density perturbations through the proposed mechanism. We show that these\nfluctuations could easily dominate over the ones generated through the standard\nmechanism. The new scenario has several consequences for inflation model\nbuilding and observations. The proposed mechanism allows to generate the\nobserved level of density perturbations with a much lower scale of inflation\nand thus generically predicts a smaller level of gravitational waves. The\nrelation between the slope of the spectrum of the produced density\nperturbations and the potential of the inflaton field is different from the\nstandard relations obtained in the context of slow roll inflation. Because the\nfield responsible for the fluctuations is not the inflaton, it can have\nsignificantly larger self couplings and thus density perturbations could be\nnon-Gaussian.

Sometime after recombination, the neutral,\nchemically pristine gas was reionized by ultraviolet photons emitted from the\nfirst stars, but also enriched with heavy elements when these stars ended their\nlives as energetic supernovae. Using the results from previous high-resolution\ncosmological simulations of early structure formation that include radiative\ntransfer, we show that a significant volume fraction of the IGM can be\nmetal-polluted, as well as ionized, by massive Population III stars formed in\nsmall-mass (10^6-10^7 Msun) halos early on. If most of the early generation\nstars die as pair-instability supernovae with energies up to 10^{53} ergs, the\nvolume-averaged mean metallicity will quickly reach Z ~ 10^{-4}Zsun by a\nredshift of 15-20, possibly causing a prompt transition to the formation of a\nstellar population that is dominated by low-mass stars.

We report the discovery of 605 s\npulsations in the X-ray flux. The Doppler delay curve is measured and provides\na mass function of 6.1 Msun which is a lower limit to the mass of the binary\ncompanion of the neutron star. The degree of attenuation of the low-energy end\nof the spectrum is found to be a strong function of orbital phase. A simple\nmodel of absorption in a stellar wind from the companion star fits the orbital\nphase dependence reasonably well and limits the orbital inclination angle to\nthe range 38 to 72 degrees. These measured parameters lead to an orbital\nseparation of 60 to 80 lt-s, a mass for the companion star in the range 9-31\nMsun, and an upper limit to the size of the companion of ~22 Rsun.

Such a perfect blackbody spectrum is puzzling since\nradiative transport through typical neutron star atmospheres causes noticeable\ndeviation from blackbody. Previous studies have shown that in a strong magnetic\nfield, the outermost layer of the neutron star may be in a condensed solid or\nliquid form because of the greatly enhanced cohesive energy of the condensed\nmatter. The critical temperature of condensation increases with the magnetic\nfield strength, and can be as high as 10^6 K (for Fe surface at B \\sim 10^{13}\nG or H surface at B \\sim a few times 10^{14} G). Thus the thermal radiation can\ndirectly emerge from the degenerate metallic condensed surface, without going\nthrough a gaseous atmosphere.

Subtle differences are found\ncompared with traditional models of Photon Dominated Regions (PDRs) because of\nthe higher temperatures and higher gas-phase H2O abundance caused by\nevaporation of ices in the inner region.

As explained in Efroimsky and Goldreich (2004), this\nopinion originated from a wrong interpretation of a (mathematically correct)\nresult obtained in terms of non-osculating orbital elements. A similar analysis\ncarried out in the language of osculating elements will endow the planetary\nequations with some extra terms caused by the planet's obliquity change. Some\nof these terms will be nontrivial, in that they will not be amendments to the\ndisturbing function. Due to the extra terms, the variations of a planet's\nobliquity may cause a secular drift of its satellite orbit inclination. In this\narticle we set out the analytical formalism for our study of this drift. We\ndemonstrate that, in the case of uniform precession, the drift will be\nextremely slow, because the first-order terms responsible for the drift will be\nshort-period and, thus, will have vanishing orbital averages (as anticipated 40\nyears ago by Peter Goldreich), while the secular terms will be of the second\norder only. However, it turns out that variations of the planetary precession\nmake the first-order terms secular. For example, the planetary nutations will\nresonate with the satellite's orbital frequency and, thereby, may instigate a\nsecular drift. A detailed study of this process will be offered in the\nsubsequent publication, while here we work out the required mathematical\nformalism and point out the key aspects of the dynamics. \n\n"}

Simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of Galactic sources have\nshown that the outflow is strong at low accretion rates, but it weakens\ndramatically or disappears completely at high accretion rates, manifesting\nstructural changes in the accretion flow. It is reasonable to assume that SMBHs\nfollow the same trend. For low luminosity SMBHs in nearby elliptical galaxies\nand clusters, recent observations strongly suggest that the outflows play the\ncentral role in keeping the gas hot (mechanical feedback). If the outflow is\nquenched in SMBHs at high accretion rates similarly to the behavior of galactic\nsources, then the straightforward consequence is a relatively weak feedback of\nrapidly accreting SMBHs. We argue that elliptical galaxies and their central\nengines should then evolve through two stages. Early on, the central SMBH\nrapidly grows by accreting cooling gas at a near-Eddington rate with high\nradiative efficiency but with weak feedback on the infalling gas. This stage\nterminates when the black hole has grown to a sufficiently large mass that its\nfeedback (radiative and/or mechanical), despite the low gas heating efficiency,\nis able to suppress gas cooling.

We confirm earlier results by Shetrone that for M 13, the\nratio varies from (25+26)Mg/24Mg = 1 in stars with the highest Al abundance to\n(25+26)Mg/24Mg = 0.2 in stars with the lowest Al abundance. However, we\nseparate the contributions of all three isotopes and find a spread in the ratio\n24Mg:25Mg:26Mg with values ranging from 48:13:39 to 78:11:11. As in NGC 6752,\nwe find a positive correlation between 26Mg and Al, an anticorrelation between\n24Mg and Al, and no correlation between 25Mg and Al. In M 71, our one star has\na ratio 70:13:17. For both clusters, the lowest ratios of 25Mg/24Mg and\n26Mg/24Mg exceed those observed in field stars at the same metallicity, a\nresult also found in NGC 6752. The contribution of 25Mg to the total Mg\nabundance is constant within a given cluster and between clusters with\n25Mg/(24+25+26)Mg = 0.13. For M 13 and NGC 6752, the ranges of the Mg isotope\nratios are similar and both clusters show the same correlations between Al and\nMg isotopes suggesting that the same process is responsible for the abundance\nvariations in these clusters. While existing models fail to reproduce all the\nobserved abundances, we continue to favor the scenario in which two generations\nof AGB stars produce the observed abundances. A first generation of metal-poor\nAGB stars pollutes the entire cluster and is responsible for the large ratios\nof 25Mg/24Mg and 26Mg/24Mg observed in cluster stars with compositions\nidentical to field stars at the same metallicity.

During this flare, which peaks at\nt_peak ~210s after the BAT trigger, a flux variation of (delta F)/F~6 in a very\nshort time (delta t)/t_peak<<1 was observed. Its measured fluence in the 0.2-10\nkeV band was ~1.4x10^-8 erg cm^-2, which corresponds to 1-15% of the prompt\nfluence. We present indications of spectral variations during the flare. We\nargue that the producing mechanism is late internal shocks, which implies that\nthe central engine is still active at 210s, though with a reduced power with\nrespect to the prompt emission. The X-ray light curve flattens to a very\nshallow slope with decay index of ~0.5 after ~4400s, which also supports\ncontinued central engine activity at late times. This burst is classified as an\nX-ray flash, with a relatively low fluence (~10^-7 erg cm^-2 in the 15-350 keV\nband, E_iso~10^51 erg), a soft spectrum (photon index 2.65), no significant\nflux above ~50 keV and a peak energy E_p<15 keV.

Here\nwe propose a simple empirical test for this anthropic argument within the\nboundaries of the observable Universe.

Recently, a novel\nmodel-independent method for the estimation of CMB angular power spectrum from\nmulti-frequency observations has been proposed and implemented on the first\nyear WMAP (WMAP-1) data by Saha et al.~2006. We review the results from WMAP-1\nand also present the new angular power spectrum based on three years of the\nWMAP data (WMAP-3). Previous estimates have depended on foreground templates\nbuilt using extraneous observational input to remove foreground contamination.\nThis is the first demonstration that the CMB angular spectrum can be reliably\nestimated with precision from a self contained analysis of the WMAP data. The\nprimary product of WMAP are the observations of CMB in 10 independent\ndifference assemblies (DA) distributed over 5 frequency bands that have\nuncorrelated noise. Our method utilizes maximum information available within\nWMAP data by linearly combining DA maps from different frequencies to remove\nforegrounds and estimating the power spectrum from the 24 cross power spectra\nof clean maps that have independent noise. An important merit of the method is\nthat the expected residual power from unresolved point sources is significantly\ntempered to a constant offset at large multipoles (in contrast to the ~l^2\ncontribution expected from a Poisson distribution) leading to a small\ncorrection at large multipoles. Hence, the power spectrum estimates are less\nsusceptible to uncertainties in the model of point sources. \n\n"}

However, we have recently discovered that these PDS\nresult from the improper addition/subtraction of non-simultaneous lightcurves.\nAims: To understand the properties and origins of the artefact. Methods: We\nre-analysed our XMM-Newton observations of M31 with non-simultaneous and\nsimultaneous lightcurves, then combined simulated lightcurves at various\nintensities with various offsets and found that the artefact is more dependent\non the offset than the intensity. Results: The lightcurves produced by the\nXMM-Newton Science Analysis Software (SAS) are non-synchronised by default.\nThis affects not only the combination of lightcurves from the three EPIC\ndetectors (MOS1, MOS2 and pn), but also background subtraction in the same CCD.\nIt is therefore imperative that all SAS-generated lightcurves are synchronised\nby time filtering, even if the whole observation is to be used. We also find\nthat the reported timing behaviour for NGC 4559 ULX-7 was also contaminated by\nthe artefact; there is no significant variability in the correctly-combined\nlightcurves of NGC 4559 ULX-7. Hence, the classification of this source as an\nintermediate-mass black hole is no longer justified. Conclusions: While\nprevious timing results from M31 have been proven wrong, and also the broken\npower law PDS in NGC 4559 ULX-7, XMM-Newton was able to detect aperiodic\nvariability in just 3 ks of observations of NGC 5408 ULX1.

Here, we\nshow that simulations with two unequal mass planets starting on nearly circular\norbits predict a reduced frequency of collisions and a broader range of final\neccentricities. The two-planet scattering model can easily reproduce the\nobserved eccentricities with a plausible distribution of planet mass ratios.\nFurther, the two-planet scattering model predicts a maximum eccentricity of\nabout 0.8, independent of the distribution of planet mass ratios, provided that\nboth planets are initially place on nearly circular orbits.

In this paper, we present extensive synthetic HB simulations to\ndetermine whether peculiar distributions in the underlying physical parameters\nare needed to explain the observed HB morphology. We find that a unimodal mass\ndistribution along the HB can satisfactorily account for the observed HB\nbimodality, *provided* the mass dispersion is substantially larger than usually\ninferred for the Galactic globular clusters. In this case, NGC 6229 should have\na well-populated, extended blue tail. A truly bimodal distribution in HB masses\ncan also satisfactorily account for the observed HB morphology, although in\nthis case the existence of an extended blue tail is not necessarily implied.\nThe other two well-known bimodal-HB clusters, NGC 1851 and NGC 2808, are\nbriefly analyzed. While the HB morphology of NGC 1851 can also be reproduced\nwith a unimodal mass distribution assuming a large mass dispersion, the same is\nnot true of NGC 2808, for which a bimodal, and possibly multimodal, mass\ndistribution seems definitely required.\n  The problem of gaps on the blue HB is also discussed.

The simplest LAEMW approach predicts a slower\ndecay in observed afterglow peak frequency and faster decay in flux than the\nsimplest blast-wave model, though more complicated models of both can provide\ndifferent dependences. LAEMW do not require the rapid magnetic field\namplification demanded of the blast-wave approach because the emission\noriginates from a nearly fixed radius. Different time dependent behavior of GRB\nand post-GRB emission is also predicted. Observational evidence for a pulsar in\na GRB would make some GRB engine models, such as neutron star mergers and black\nholes unlikely. Therefore, the question of whether a pulsar is present is an\nimportant one even if it could drive a canonical fireball. \n\n"}

We review two approaches\nused to quantify back-reaction. In the first approach, the effect of the\nfluctuations on the background is expressed in terms of an effective\nenergy-momentum tensor.
