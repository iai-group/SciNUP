The motivation is extended topological quantum field theory (TQFT),\nwhere the 2-category of unitary 2-representations of a finite group is thought\nof as the `2-category assigned to the point' in the untwisted finite group\nmodel.\n  The first result is that the braided monoidal category of transformations of\nthe identity on the 2-category of unitary 2-representations of a finite group\ncomputes as the category of conjugation equivariant vector bundles over the\ngroup equipped with the fusion tensor product. This result is consistent with\nthe extended TQFT hypotheses of Baez and Dolan, since it establishes that the\ncategory assigned to the circle can be obtained as the `higher trace of the\nidentity' of the 2-category assigned to the point.\n  The second result is about 2-characters of 2-representations, a concept which\nhas been introduced independently by Ganter and Kapranov. It is shown that the\n2-character of a unitary 2-representation can be made functorial with respect\nto morphisms of 2-representations, and that in fact the 2-character is a\nunitarily fully faithful functor from the complexified Grothendieck category of\nunitary 2-representations to the category of unitary equivariant vector bundles\nover the group.\n  The final result is about pivotal structures on fusion categories, with a\nview towards a conjecture made by Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik.

In particular, for\nlarge families of hyperplane arrangements, this fundamental group, being\nisomorphic to the fundamental group of a complement of a line arrangement, has\nsome remarkable properties: either it is a direct sum of free groups and a free\nabelian group, or it has a conjugation-free geometric presentation.\n  In this paper, we first give a complete proof to the following key lemma: if\nwe draw a new line through only one intersection point of a given real line\narrangement whose fundamental group is conjugation-free, then the fundamental\ngroup of the new arrangement is also conjugation-free.\n  Second, we generalize this lemma to the case of conic-line arrangements.\nMoreover, we prove that once the graph associated to conic-line arrangements\n(defined slightly different than the corresponding graph for line arrangements)\nhas no cycles, then the fundamental group of its complement has a\nconjugation-free geometric presentation and in addition can be written as a\ndirect sum of free groups and a free abelian group. Also, we show that if the\ngraph consists of one cycle, and the conic does not pass through all the\nmultiple points corresponding to the vertices of the cycle, then the\nfundamental group has a conjugation-free geometric presentation as well.\n  For conclusion, we extend the family of real line arrangements having a\nconjugation-free geometric presentation (for their fundamental group) by\ndefining the notion of a conjugation-free graph. We also extend this notion to\ncertain families of conic-line arrangements. \n\n"}

The so-called\n'symmetric squaring construction' in \\v{C}ech homology with Z/2-coefficients\nwas introduced by Schick et al. 2007 as a map from the k-th \\v{C}ech homology\ngroup of a space X to the 2k-th \\v{C}ech homology group of X \\times X divided\nby the above mentioned involution.

The homotopy relation between 2-crossed\nmodule maps will be defined in a similar way to Crans' 1-transfors between\nstrict Gray functors, however being pointed, thus this corresponds to Baues'\nhomotopy relation between quadratic module maps. Despite the fact that this\nhomotopy relation between 2-crossed module morphisms is not, in general, an\nequivalence relation, we prove that if $A$ and $A'$ are 2-crossed modules, with\nthe underlying group $F$ of $A$ being free (in short $A$ is free up to order\none), then homotopy between 2-crossed module maps $A \\to A'$ yields, in this\ncase, an equivalence relation. Furthermore, if a chosen basis $B$ is specified\nfor $F$, then we can define a 2-groupoid $HOM_B(A,A')$ of 2-crossed module maps\n$A \\to A'$, homotopies connecting them, and 2-fold homotopies between\nhomotopies, where the latter correspond to (pointed) Crans' 2-transfors between\n1-transfors.\n  We define a partial resolution $Q^1(A)$, for a 2-crossed module $A$, whose\nunderlying group is free, with a canonical chosen basis, together with a\nprojection map ${\\rm proj}\\colon Q^1(A) \\to A$, defining isomorphisms at the\nlevel of 2-crossed module homotopy groups.

The abstract notion of a \"pattern\"\nis introduced, which may be seen as an analogue of the space group of\nisometries preserving a tiling but where, instead, one considers partial\nisometries preserving portions of it. These inverse semigroups of partial\ntransformations are the suitable analogue of the space group for patterns with\nFLC but few global symmetries. In a similar vein we introduce the notion of a\n\\emph{collage}, a system of equivalence relations on the ambient space of a\npattern, which we show is capable of generalising many constructions applicable\nto the study of FLC tilings and Delone sets, such as the expression of the\ntiling space as an inverse limit of approximants.\n  An invariant is constructed for our abstract patterns, the so called\npattern-equivariant (PE) homology. These homology groups are defined using\ninfinite singular chains on the ambient space of the pattern, although we show\nthat one may define cellular versions which are isomorphic under suitable\nconditions. For FLC tilings these cellular PE chains are analogous to the PE\ncellular cochains \\cite{Sadun1}. The PE homology and cohomology groups are\nshown to be related through Poincar\\'{e} duality.\n  An efficient and highly geometric method for the computation of the PE\nhomology groups for hierarchical tilings is presented. The rotationally\ninvariant PE homology groups are shown not to be a topological invariant for\nthe associated tiling space and seem to retain extra information about global\nsymmetries of tilings in the tiling space.

An explicit construction of Henriques\nproduces certain Lie $\\infty$-groupoids called `Lie $\\infty$-groups' by\nintegrating finite type Lie $n$-algebras. In order to study the compatibility\nbetween this integration procedure and the homotopy theory of Lie $n$-algebras\nintroduced in the companion paper arXiv:1809.05999, we present a homotopy\ntheory for Lie $\\infty$-groupoids. Unlike Kan simplicial sets and the higher\ngeometric groupoids of Behrend and Getzler, Lie $\\infty$-groupoids do not form\na category of fibrant objects (CFO), since the category of manifolds lacks\npullbacks. Instead, we show that Lie $\\infty$-groupoids form an `incomplete\ncategory of fibrant objects' in which the weak equivalences correspond to\n`stalkwise' weak equivalences of simplicial sheaves. This homotopical structure\nenjoys many of the same properties as a CFO, such as having, in the presence of\nfunctorial path objects, a convenient realization of its simplicial\nlocalization.

A significant challenge is that this\nsmoothing process involves the choice of a parameter and persistent homology is\nhighly sensitive to that choice; moreover, important scale information is lost.\nWe propose a novel topological summary plot, called a persistence terrace, that\nincorporates a wide range of smoothing parameters and is robust, multi-scale,\nand parameter-free. This plot allows one to isolate distinct topological\nsignals that may have merged for any fixed value of the smoothing parameter,\nand it also allows one to infer the size and point density of the topological\nfeatures.

The main idea is that the\ncategory of homotopy types can be embedded in a new category of dihomotopy\ntypes, the embedding being realized by the Globe functor.

Examples of this are the\nbraids in a braided monoidal category, and the pentagon which appears in the\ndefinitions of both monoidal category and A_infinity space.\n  I will try to give a Friday-afternoonish description of some of the dreams\npeople have for higher-dimensional category theory and its interactions with\ntopology. Grothendieck, for instance, suggested that tame topology should be\nthe study of n-groupoids; others have hoped that an n-category of cobordisms\nbetween cobordisms between ... will provide a clean setting for TQFT; and there\nis convincing evidence that the whole world of n-categories is a mirror of the\nworld of homotopy groups of spheres. \n\n"}

This amounts to precise\nways of handling the requisite additional structure encapsulating the various\ncoherence conditions. Given e. g. two augmented differential graded algebras A\nand B, an sh-map from A to B is a twisting cochain from the reduced bar\nconstruction of A to B and, in this manner, the class of morphisms of augmented\ndifferential graded algebras is extended to that of sh-morphisms.

There are several conjectures connecting the\nstring topology BV algebra with algebraic structures on the Hochschild\ncohomology of algebras related to the manifold X, but none of them has been\nverified for manifolds of dimension n>1.\n  In this work we study string topology in the case when X is aspherical (i.e.\nits homotopy groups \\pi_i(X) vanish for i > 1). In this case the Hochschild\ncohomology Gerstenhaber algebra HH^*(A) of the group algebra A of the\nfundamental group of X has a BV structure. Our main result is a theorem\nestablishing a natural isomorphism between the Hochschild cohomology BV algebra\nHH^*(A) and the string topology BV algebra H_*(LX). In particular, for a closed\noriented surface X of hyperbolic type we obtain a complete description of the\nBV algebra operations on H_*(LX) and HH^*(A) in terms of the Goldman bracket of\nloops on X. The only manifolds for which the BV algebra structure on H_*(LX)\nwas known before were spheres and complex Stiefel manifolds.\n  Our proof is based on a combination of topological and algebraic\nconstructions allowing us to compute and compare multiplications and BV\noperators on both H_*(LX) and HH^*(A). \n\n"}

A map is n-phantom if it is null when restricted to\nfinite spectra of type at least n. We define divisibility and finite type\nconditions which are suitable for studying n-phantom maps. We show that the\nduality functor W_{n-1} defined by Mahowald and Rezk is the analog of\nBrown-Comenetz duality for chromatic phantom maps, and give conditions under\nwhich the natural map Y --> W_{n-1}^2 Y is an isomorphism. \n\n"}

We formalize using $n$-stacks the notion of shape underlying\nthis nonabelian cohomology. A generalization of the de Rham construction to any\nappropriate formal category or family of formal categories, yields various\nalgebraic aspects of Hodge theory for the de Rham shape, such as the Hodge\nfiltration, the Gauss-Manin connection, Griffiths transversality, an extension\nof the Gauss-Manin connection with regular singularities across singular\npoints, etc. Along the way, we develop a little bit more technology for\n$n$-categories, such as a canonical fibrant replacement for the $n+1$-category\n$nCAT$; and we pose the following general type of question: what are the\nproperties of the nonabelian cohomology $n$-stack $Hom(X,T)$ as a function of\nthe properties of the coefficient $n$-stack $T$ and the domain $n$-stack $X$? \n\n"}
