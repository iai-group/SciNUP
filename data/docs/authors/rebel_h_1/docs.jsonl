Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach.

We analyzed all\navailable observations carried out by RXTE on IGR J17473-2721 during its later\noutburst and as well all the available SWIFT/BAT data. The flux of the latter\noutburst rose in ~ one month and then kept roughly constant for the following ~\ntwo months. During this time period, the source was in a low/hard state. The\nsource moved to a high/soft state within the following three days, accompanied\nby the occurrence of an additional outburst at soft X-rays and the end of the\npreceding outburst in hard X-rays. During the decay of this soft outburst, the\nsource went back to a low/hard state within 6 days, with a luminosity 4 times\nlower than the first transition. This shows a full cycle of the hysteresis in\ntransition between the hard and the soft states. The fact that the flux\nremained roughly constant for ~ two months at times prior to the spectral\ntransition to a high/soft state might be regarded as the result of balancing\nthe evaporation of the inner disk and the inward accretion flow, in a model in\nwhich the state transition is determined by the mass flow rate. Such a balance\nmight be broken via an additional mass flow accreting onto the inner disk,\nwhich lightens the extra soft outburst and causes the state transition.\nHowever, the possibility of an origin of the emission from the jet during this\ntime period cannot be excluded. The spectral analysis suggests an inclined XRB\nsystem for IGR J17473-2721.

This will allow the detection of gravitational waves\ngenerated in binary systems containing black holes of intermediate mass, ~\n100-1000 solar masses. We primarily discuss two different source types --\nmergers between two intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) of comparable mass,\nand intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) of smaller compact objects with\nmass ~ 1-10 solar masses into IMBHs. IMBHs may form via two channels: (i) in\ndark matter halos at high redshift through direct collapse or the collapse of\nvery massive metal-poor Population III stars, or (ii) via runaway stellar\ncollisions in globular clusters.

Observations of the non-thermal radio and X-ray emission spectra\nas well as the H.E.S.S. measurements of the very high energy gamma-ray emission\nare used to constrain the astronomical and CR acceleration parameters of the\nsystem.

Abstract: We study the emission observed at energies greater than 100 MeV of 11 Gamma\nRay Bursts (GRBs) detected by the Fermi/Large Area Telescope (LAT) until\nOctober 2009. The GeV emission has three main properties: (i) its duration is\noften longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by the Gamma\nBurst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi [this confirms earlier results from the\nEnergetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET)]; (ii) its spectrum is\nconsistent with F(v) propto v^(-1) and does not show strong spectral evolution;\n(iii) for the brightest bursts, the flux detected by the LAT decays as a power\nlaw with a typical slope: t^(-1.5). We argue that the observed >0.1 GeV flux\ncan be interpreted as afterglow emission shortly following the start of the\nprompt phase emission as seen at smaller frequencies. The decay slope is what\nexpected if the fireball emission is produced in the radiative regime, i.e. all\ndissipated energy is radiated away. We also argue that the detectability in the\nGeV energy range depends on the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma of the bursts, being\nstrongly favoured in the case of large Gamma. This implies that the fraction of\nbursts detected at high energies corresponds to the fraction of bursts having\nthe largest Gamma. The radiative interpretation can help to explain why the\nobserved X-ray and optical afterglow energetics are much smaller than the\nenergetics emitted during the prompt phase, despite the fact that the collision\nwith the external medium should be more efficient than internal shocks in\nproducing the radiation we see. \n\n"}

Between directional sweeps, the\nthree-dimensional data is rotated in memory so that the sweep is always\nperformed in a cache-efficient way along the direction of contiguous memory.\nHence, the code only requires a one-dimensional description of the conservation\nequations to be solved. This approach also enable an elegant novel\nparallelisation of the code that is based on persistent communications with MPI\nfor cubic domain decomposition on machines with distributed memory.

If differential gas motions are present then a photon\nemitted in one region of the cluster will be scattered in another region only\nif their relative velocities are small enough and the Doppler shift of the\nphoton energy does not exceed the line width. This affects both the degree and\nthe direction of polarization. The changes in the polarization signal are in\nparticular sensitive to the gas motions perpendicular to the line of sight.

This may reveal the geometry of the explosion and its\nconnection to the equatorial ring and the outer rings around SN 1987A. We have\nused integral field spectroscopy to image the supernova ejecta and the\nequatorial ring in the emission lines of [Si I]+[Fe II] and He I. The spectral\ninformation can be mapped into a radial velocity image revealing the expansion\nof the ejecta both as projected onto the sky and perpendicular to the sky\nplane. The inner ejecta are spatially resolved in a North-South direction and\nare clearly asymmetric. We argue that the bulk of the ejecta is situated in the\nsame plane as defined by the equatorial ring and does not form a bipolar\nstructure as has been suggested. The exact shape of the ejecta is modelled and\nwe find that an elongated triaxial ellipsoid fits the observations best.

In order to shed light on\nthese issues, we investigate the state-of-the-art models of Hubeny et al. that\ndescribe the continuum spectrum of thin accretion discs and include\nrelativistic effects. We explore the bolometric corrections as a function of\nmass accretion rates, black hole masses and viewing angles, restricted to the\nparameter space expected for type-1 quasars. We find that a nonlinear\nrelationship log L_bol=A + B log(lambda L_lambda) with B<=0.9 is favoured by\nthe models and becomes tighter as the wavelength decreases. We calculate from\nthe model the bolometric corrections corresponding to the wavelengths lambda =\n1450A, 3000A and 5100A. In particular, for lambda=3000A we find A=9.24 +- 0.77\nand B=0.81 +- 0.02.

In the collapsar\nmodel for LGRBs, gamma rays are produced in an ultrarelativistic jet launching\nfrom the magnetosphere of the black hole that forms in the aftermath of the\ncollapse of a rotating progenitor star. The jet is collimated along the star's\nrotation axis, but the concomitant luminous supernova should be\nrelatively--though certainly not entirely--spherical, and should synthesize a\nsubstantial mass of 56Ni. Our goal is to provide a qualitative assessment of\nthe possibility that accretion of the progenitor envelope onto the black hole,\nwhich powers the LGRB, could also deposit sufficient energy and nickel mass in\nthe envelope to produce a luminous supernova. For this, the energy dissipated\nnear the black hole during accretion must be transported outward, where it can\ndrive a supernova-like shockwave. Here we suggest that the energy is\ntransported by convection and develop an analytical toy model, relying on\nglobal mass and energy conservation, for the dynamics of stellar collapse. The\nmodel suggests that a ~10,000 km/s shock can be driven into the envelope and\nthat ~10^51 erg explosions are possible. The efficiency with which the\naccretion energy is being transferred to the envelope is governed by the\ncompetition of advection and convection at distances ~100-1,000 km from the\nblack hole and is sensitive to the values of the convective mixing length, the\nmagnitude of the effective viscous stress, and the specific angular momentum of\nthe infalling envelope. Substantial masses of 56Ni may be synthesized in the\nconvective accretion flow over the course of tens of seconds from the initial\ncircularization of the infalling envelope around the black hole. The\nsynthesized nickel is convectively mixed with a much larger mass of unburned\nejecta. \n\n"}

We utilized analyses of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) to\nassess the role of moderate-luminosity AGNs in galaxy evolution. First, we\nconfirm some previous results and extend them to higher redshifts, e.g., there\nis no apparent color bimodality for AGN hosts from z~0-2, but non-AGN galaxy\ncolor bimodality exists up to z~3; most AGNs reside in massive hosts and the\nAGN fraction rises strongly toward higher stellar mass up to z~2-3; and the\ncolors of both AGN hosts and non-AGN galaxies become redder as the stellar mass\nincreases up to z~2-3. Second, we point out that it is critical to use\nmass-matched samples to examine color-magnitude relations of AGN hosts and\nnon-AGN galaxies. We show that for mass-matched samples up to z~2-3, AGN hosts\nlie in the same CMD region as non-AGN galaxies; i.e., there is no specific\nclustering of AGN hosts around the red sequence, the top of the blue cloud, or\nthe green valley in between. The AGN fraction (~10%) is mostly independent of\nhost-galaxy color, providing an indication of the duty cycle of SMBH growth in\ntypical massive galaxies. These results are in contrast to those obtained with\nnon-mass-matched samples where there is apparent AGN clustering in the CMD and\nthe AGN fraction generally increases as the color becomes redder. We also find,\nfor mass-matched samples, that the SFRs of AGN hosts are typically a factor of\n~2-3 larger than those of non-AGN galaxies at z~0-1, whereas this difference\ndiminishes at z~1-3. Our results can be reasonably explained by two main\ningredients, color-mass correlation and passive or secular evolution of\ngalaxies; and thus tightly constrain any effects from moderate-luminosity AGN\nfeedback upon color-magnitude properties over the ~80% of cosmic time. \n\n"}

All the strong K_alpha line\nemission show broader widths at the center than at the rim, while the centroid\nenergies are constant across the remnant (except for Ca).

One of the\nappealing models is the late internal dissipation model, where X-ray emission\nduring the shallow-decay phase is attributed to internal dissipation, analogous\nto the prompt gamma-ray emission. We discuss possible scenarios of the late\nprompt emission, such as late internal shocks, magnetic reconnection, and\nphotospheric dissipation. We also consider the consequences of late dissipation\nand a two-component (early and late) jet model for the high-energy (GeV-TeV)\nemission. We study not only synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission from the\nearly and late jets but also external inverse-Compton (EIC) emission, which is\nnaturally predicted in the late dissipation model. For the latter, we perform\nnumerical calculations taking into account the equal-arrival-time surface of\nEIC photons and show that the EIC component typically has a peak at ~1-100 GeV\nwhich may dominate over the SSC components. We demonstrate that very high\nenergy gamma rays from both these components are detectable for nearby and/or\nenergetic gamma-ray bursts, with current and future Cherenkov detectors such as\nMAGIC, VERITAS, CTA and HAWC, and possibly Fermi. Although the expected event\nrate would not be large, detections should be useful as a test of the model.\nMulti-wavelength observations using both the ground-based telescopes and the\nSwift and/or Fermi satellites are also important to constrain the models. \n\n"}

In anticipation of the first detections, the\nexpected distribution of GW sources in the local universe is of considerable\ninterest. Here we investigate the full phase space distribution of coalescing\ncompact binaries at $z = 0$ using dark matter simulations of structure\nformation. The fact that these binary systems acquire large barycentric\nvelocities at birth (\"kicks\") results in merger site distributions that are\nmore diffusely distributed with respect to their putative hosts, with mergers\noccurring out to distances of a few Mpc from the host halo. Redshift estimates\nbased solely on the nearest galaxy in projection can, as a result, be\ninaccurate. On the other hand, large offsets from the host galaxy could aid the\ndetection of faint optical counterparts and should be considered when designing\nstrategies for follow-up observations. The degree of isotropy in the projected\nsky distributions of GW sources is found to be augmented with increasing kick\nvelocity and to be severely enhanced if progenitor systems possess large kicks\nas inferred from the known population of pulsars and double compact binaries.\nEven in the absence of observed electromagnetic counterparts, the differences\nin sky distributions of binaries produced by disparate kick-velocity models\ncould be discerned by GW observatories, within the expected accuracies and\ndetection rates of advanced LIGO--in particular with the addition of more\ninterferometers. \n\n"}

In addition to the previously\nstudied pointlike source at the pulsar's position, we detected extended\nemission on the south-southwest side of this source. The pointlike source\nspectrum can be described by the absorbed power-law model with the hydrogen\ncolumn density N_H = (2.5+/-0.6)*10^{21} cm^{-2}, photon index Gamma =\n1.6+/-0.1, and luminosity L_{0.5-8 keV} = 1.3*10^{33} d_3^2 erg/s, where d_3 is\nthe distance scaled to 3 kpc. This emission likely includes an unresolved part\nof the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) created by the colliding winds from the pulsar\nand the Be companion, and a contribution from the pulsar magnetosphere.

In this work we study its spectral and timing\nproperties during the 2009 outburst based on Swift and RXTE data. Our spectral\nanalysis of the source indicates only slight spectral shape evolution during\nthe entire outburst. The equivalent width of the iron line and the apparent\narea of the blackbody emission associated with the hotspot at the stellar\nsurface both decrease significantly during the outburst. This is consistent\nwith a gradual receding of the accretion disc as the accretion rate drops. The\npulse profile analysis shows absence of dramatic shape evolution with a\nmoderate decrease in pulse amplitude. This behaviour might result from a\nmovement of the accretion column footprint towards the magnetic pole as the\ndisc retreats. The time lag between the soft and the hard energy pulses\nincrease by a factor of two during the outburst. A physical displacement of the\ncentroid of the accretion shock relative to the blackbody spot or changes in\nthe emissivity pattern of the Comptonization component related to the\nvariations of the accretion column structure could cause this evolution.

We have built a mixed\ndwarfs+clusters sample containing some of the most promising nearby dwarf\ngalaxies (Draco, Ursa Minor, Wilman 1 and Segue 1) and local galaxy clusters\n(Perseus, Coma, Ophiuchus, Virgo, Fornax, NGC5813 and NGC5846), and then\ncompute their DM annihilation flux profiles by making use of the latest\nmodeling of their DM density profiles. We also include in our calculations the\neffect of DM substructure. Willman 1 appears as the best candidate in the\nsample. However, its mass modeling is still rather uncertain, so probably other\ncandidates with less uncertainties and quite similar fluxes, namely Ursa Minor\nand Segue 1, might be better options. As for galaxy clusters, Virgo represents\nthe one with the highest flux. However, its large spatial extension can be a\nserious handicap for IACT observations and posterior data analysis. Yet, other\nlocal galaxy cluster candidates with more moderate emission regions, such as\nPerseus, may represent good alternatives. After comparing dwarfs and clusters,\nwe found that the former exhibit annihilation flux profiles that, at the\ncenter, are roughly one order of magnitude higher than those of clusters,\nalthough galaxy clusters can yield similar, or even higher, integrated fluxes\nfor the whole object once substructure is taken into account. Even when any of\nthese objects are strictly point-like according to the properties of their\nannihilation signals, we conclude that dwarf galaxies are best suited for\nobservational strategies based on the search of point-like sources, while\ngalaxy clusters represent best targets for analyses that can deal with rather\nextended emissions. Finally, we study the detection prospects for IACTs\n[ABRIDGED] \n\n"}

Correlations between Flux, Color, and\n  Polarization Abstract: We report on the correlation between the flux, color and polarization\nvariations on time scales of days--months in blazars, and discuss their\nuniversal aspects. We performed monitoring of 42 blazars in the optical and\nnear-infrared bands from 2008 to 2010 using TRISPEC attached to the \"Kanata\"\n1.5-m telescope. We found that 28 blazars exhibited \"bluer-when-brighter\"\ntrends in their whole or a part of time-series data sets. This corresponds to\n88% of objects that were observed for >10 days. Thus, our observation\nunambiguously confirmed that the \"bluer-when-brighter\" trend is common in the\nemission from blazar jets. This trend was apparently generated by a variation\ncomponent with a constant and relatively blue color and an underlying red\ncomponent. Prominent short-term flares on time scales of days--weeks tended to\nexhibit a spectral hysteresis; their rising phases were bluer than their decay\nphases around the flare maxima. In contrast to the strong flux--color\ncorrelation, the correlation of the flux and polarization degree was relatively\nweak; only 10 objects showed significant positive correlations. Rotations of\npolarization were detected only in three objects: PKS 1510-089, 3C 454.3, and\nPKS 1749+096, and possibly in S5 0716+714.

From these observational\nphenomena we derive possible constraints on the magnetic field strengths of the\nneutron stars in four SFXTs with known spin periods. While IGR J11215$-$5952,\nIGR J16465$-$4507, and IGR J18483$-$0311 may have magnetic fields (up to a few\n$10^{11}-10^{12}$ G) similar to those of normal X-ray pulsars, the magnetic\nfield of AX J1841.0$-$0536 is considerably low ($\\la 10^{10}$ G). The high-mass\ncompanion stars in SFXTs implies that the neutron stars are relatively young\nobjects, with age less than $\\sim 10^7$ yr.

The conditions\nin the compressed low-mass WD (M_WD < 0.9M_sun) in our model mimics those of a\nChandrasekhar mass WD. The spin-down luminosity from the QN compact remnant\n(the quark star) provides additional power that makes the QN-Ia light-curve\nbrighter and broader than a standard SN-Ia with similar 56Ni yield. In QNe-Ia,\nphotometry and spectroscopy are not necessarily linked since the kinetic energy\nof the ejecta has a contribution from spin-down power and nuclear decay.\nAlthough QNe-Ia may not obey the Phillips relationship, their brightness and\ntheir relatively \"normal looking\" light-curves means they could be included in\nthe cosmological sample.

We vary four parameters: the gas polytropic\nindex Gamma, its temperature at large radii T_xi, the DM logarithmic slope at\nlarge radii zeta and its concentration c_vir. When comparing the model to the\nobserved mass-temperature (M-T) relation of local clusters, our results are\nindependent of both T_xi and c_vir. We thus obtain constraints on Gamma, by\nfixing the DM profile, and on zeta, by fixing the gas profile. For an NFW DM\nprofile, we find that 6/5<Gamma<13/10, which is consistent with numerical\nsimulations and observations of individual clusters. Taking 6/5<Gamma<13/10\nallows the DM profile to be slightly steeper than the NFW profile at large\nradii. Upon including local groups, we constrain the mass-dependence of Gamma\nand the value of T_xi. Interestingly, with Gamma=6/5 and zeta=-3, we reproduce\nthe observed steepening/breaking of the M-T relation at low M, if 10^6\nK<T_xi<10^7 K, consistent with simulations and observations of the warm-hot\nintergalactic medium. When extrapolated to high redshift z, the model with a\nconstant Gamma reproduces the expected self-similar behaviour. We also account\nfor the observed, non-self-similar relations provided by some high-z clusters,\nas they provide constraints on the evolution of Gamma. Comparing our model to\nthe observed luminosity-temperature relation, we discriminate between different\nM-c_vir relations: a weak dependence of c_vir on M is currently preferred by\ndata.

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40.

Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio.

The reason is that stellar winds have\nbeen found to be clumped, which results in the reduction of unclumped empirical\nmass-loss rates. Most stellar evolution models employ theoretical mass-loss\nrates which are already reduced by a moderate factor of ~2-3 compared to\nnon-corrected empirical rates. A key question is whether these reduced rates\nare of the correct order of magnitude, or if they should be reduced even\nfurther, which would mean that the alternative of eruptive mass loss becomes\nnecessary. Here we introduce the transition mass-loss rate (dM/dt)_trans\nbetween O and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Its novelty is that it is model\nindependent. All that is required is postulating the spectroscopic transition\npoint in a given data-set, and determining the stellar luminosity, which is far\nless model dependent than the mass-loss rate. The transition mass-loss rate is\nsubsequently used to calibrate stellar wind strength by its application to the\nOf/WNh stars in the Arches cluster. Good agreement is found with two\nalternative modelling/theoretical results, suggesting that the rates provided\nby current theoretical models are of the right order of magnitude in the\n~50Msun mass range. Our results do not confirm the specific need for eruptive\nmass loss as Luminous Blue Variables, and current stellar evolution modelling\nfor Galactic massive stars seems sound.

As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM. The galaxies with more turbulent ISM, yet still\ncharacterised by very weak turbulence, can hold larger amounts of the ICM.\n[Abridged] \n\n"}

Abstract: The origin of the 6.67 hr period X-ray source, 1E161348-5055, in the young\nsupernova remnant RCW 103 is puzzling. We propose that it may be the descendant\nof a Thorne-Zytkow Object (TZO). A TZO may at its formation have a rapidly\nspinning neutron star as a core, and a slowly rotating envelope. We found that\nthe core could be braked quickly to an extremely long spin period by the\ncoupling between its magnetic field and the envelope, and that the envelope\ncould be disrupted by some powerful bursts or exhausted via stellar wind. If\nthe envelope is disrupted after the core has spun down, the core will become an\nextremely long-period compact object, with a slow proper motion speed,\nsurrounded by a supernova-remnant-like shell. These features all agree with the\nobservations of 1E161348-5055.

We investigate the BAT data\nand follow-up observations obtained with the X-ray and ultraviolet/optical\ntelescopes to demonstrate that both triggers are consistent with thermonuclear\nX-ray bursts.

The single-degenerate scenario is a\nwell-explored model of SNe Ia where unstable thermonuclear burning initiates in\nan accreting, Chandrasekhar-mass WD and forms an advancing flame. By several\nproposed physical processes the rising, burning material triggers a detonation,\nwhich subsequently consumes and unbinds the WD. However, if a detonation is not\ntriggered and the deflagration is too weak to unbind the star, a completely\ndifferent scenario unfolds. We explore the failure of the\nGravitationally-Confined Detonation (GCD) mechanism of SNe Ia, and demonstrate\nthrough 2D and 3D simulations the properties of failed-detonation SNe. We show\nthat failed-detonation SNe expel a few 0.1 solar masses of burned and\npartially-burned material and that a fraction of the material falls back onto\nthe WD, polluting the remnant WD with intermediate-mass and iron-group\nelements, that likely segregate to the core forming an WD whose core is iron\nrich.

Fast magnetic reconnection which takes\nplace in the presence of turbulence can induce a process of reconnection\ndiffusion (RD). Extending earlier numerical studies of reconnection diffusion\nin cylindrical clouds, we consider more realistic clouds with spherical\ngravitational potentials and also account for the effects of the gas\nself-gravity. We demonstrate that within our setup RD is efficient. We have\nalso identified the conditions under which RD becomes strong enough to make an\ninitially subcritical cloud clump supercritical and induce its collapse. Our\nresults indicate that the formation of a supercritical core is regulated by a\ncomplex interplay between gravity, self-gravity, the magnetic field strength\nand nearly transonic and trans-Alfv\\'enic turbulence, confirming that RD is\nable to remove magnetic flux from collapsing clumps, but only a few of them\nbecome nearly critical or supercritical, sub-Alfv\\'enic cores, which is\nconsistent with the observations.

One natural scenario for energy\ninjection invokes a millisecond magnetar as the central engine of GRBs, because\nthe conventional model of a pulsar predicts a nearly constant\nmagnetic-dipole-radiation luminosity within the spin-down timescale. However,\nwe note that significant brightening occurs in some early afterglows, which\napparently conflicts with the above scenario. Here we propose a new model to\nexplain this significant brightening phenomena by considering a hyperaccreting\nfallback disk around a newborn millisecond magnetar. We show that for typical\nvalues of the model parameters, sufficient angular momentum of the accreted\nmatter is transferred to the magnetar and spins it up. It is this spin-up that\nleads to a dramatic increase of the magnetic dipole radiation luminosity with\ntime and thus significant brightening of an early afterglow. Based on this\nmodel, we carry out numerical calculations and fit well early afterglows of 12\nGRBs assuming sufficiently strong fallback accretion. If the accretion is very\nweak, our model turns out to be the conventional energy-injection scenario of a\npulsar. Therefore, our model can provide a unified explanation for the shallow\ndecay phase, plateaus, and significant brightening of early afterglows. \n\n"}

Additional information contained\nin the electromagnetic signal, such as the sky location or distance to the\nsource, can help rule out false alarms, and thus lower the necessary threshold\nfor a detection. Here, we develop a framework for determining how much\nsensitivity is added to a gravitational-wave search by triggering on an\nelectromagnetic transient. We apply this framework to a variety of relevant\nelectromagnetic transients, from short GRBs to signatures of r-process heating\nto optical and radio orphan afterglows. We compute the expected rates of\nmulti-messenger observations in the Advanced detector era, and find that\nsearches triggered on short GRBs --- with current high-energy instruments, such\nas Fermi --- and nucleosynthetic `kilonovae' --- with future optical surveys,\nlike LSST --- can boost the number of multi-messenger detections by 15% and\n40%, respectively, for a binary neutron star progenitor model.

If the injection fraction of cosmic-ray (CR)\nparticles is greater than 2x10^{-4}, for the shock parameters relevant for\nyoung supernova remnants, DSA is efficient enough to develop a significant\nshock precursor due to CR feedback, and magnetic field can be amplified up to a\nfactor of 20 via CR streaming instability in the upstream region. If scattering\ncenters drift with Alfven speed in the amplified magnetic field, the CR energy\nspectrum can be steepened significantly and the acceleration efficiency is\nreduced. Nonlinear DSA with self-consistent MFA and Alfvenic drift predicts\nthat the postshock CR pressure saturates roughly at 10 % of the shock ram\npressure for strong shocks with a sonic Mach number ranging 20< M_s< 100. Since\nthe amplified magnetic field follows the flow modification in the precursor,\nthe low energy end of the particle spectrum is softened much more than the high\nenergy end.

The disc is initially threaded by a weak magnetic field\nwhere the magnetic pressure is significantly less than the kinetic pressure in\nthe disc. The viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are modelled by two \"alpha\"\nparameters, while the coronal region above the disc is treated using ideal MHD.\nThe initial magnetic field is taken to consist of three poloidal field loops\nthreading the disc. The motivation for this study is to understand the\nadvection of disc matter and magnetic field by the turbulent/diffusive disc. At\nearly times the innermost field loop twists and its field lines become open.\nThe twisting of the opened field lines leads to the formation of both an inner\ncollimated, magnetically-dominated jet, and at larger distances from the axis a\nmatter dominated uncollimated wind. For later times, the strength of the\nmagnetic field decreases owing to field reconnection and annihilation in the\ndisc. For the early times, we have derived from the simulations both the matter\naccretion speed in the disc and the accretion speed of the magnetic field. We\nshow that the derived matter accretion speed agrees approximately with the\npredictions of a model where the accretion speed is the sum of two terms, one\ndue to the disc's viscosity (which gives a radial outflow of angular momentum\nin the disc), and a second due to the twisted magnetic field at the disc's\nsurface (which gives a vertical outflow of angular momentum). For early times\nwe find that the magnetic contribution is roughly twice the viscous\ncontribution for the case where the alpha parameters are both equal to 0.1. At\nlater times the magnetic contribution to the matter speed becomes small\ncompared to the viscous contribution. \n\n"}

In this paper, we study the hot\nX-ray coronae beyond the optical disks of two normal massive spirals, NGC1961\nand NGC6753. Based on XMM-Newton X-ray observations, hot gaseous emission is\ndetected to ~60 kpc - well beyond their optical radii. The hot gas has a\nbest-fit temperature of kT~0.6 keV and an abundance of ~0.1 Solar, and exhibits\na fairly uniform distribution, suggesting that the quasi-static gas resides in\nhydrostatic equilibrium in the potential well of the galaxies. The bolometric\nluminosity of the gas in the (0.05-0.15)r_200 region (r_200 is the virial\nradius) is ~6e40 erg/s for both galaxies. The baryon mass fractions of NGC1961\nand NGC6753 are f_b~0.1, which fall short of the cosmic baryon fraction.

Immediate knowledge of such precise position allows the use of sensitive\ncoherent beams of array telescopes for follow-up timing observations, which\nsubstantially reduces the use of telescope time (~ 20X for the GMRT). In\naddition, precise a-priori astrometric position reduces the effect of large\ncovariances in timing fit (with discovery position, pulsar period derivative\nand unknown binary model), which in-turn accelerates the convergence to initial\ntiming model.

While all relativistic jet models display anti-beaming of GW\nradiation away from the jet axis, thus radiating away from directions of GRBs'\ngamma radiation, this effect is not overwhelming. The decrease of the signal\namplitude towards the cone of gamma-ray detectability is weak, and for some\nmodels and parameters the GW signal reaches a significant amplitude for much of\nthe gamma-ray cone. Thus both signals may be jointly detected. We find\ndifferent waveforms and fourier signatures for uniform jets and structured jet\nmodels - thus offering a method of using GW signatures to probe the internal\nstructure and acceleration of GRB jets. The GW signal peaks just outside the\njet (core) of a uniform (structuted) jet. Within the jet (core) the GW signal\ndisplays wiggles, due to a polarization effect; thus for a uniform jet, the\npeak amplitude accompanies a smoother signal than the peak of a structured jet.\nFor the most probable detection angle and for typical GRB parameters, we expect\nfrequencies < ~600Hz and amplitudes h~10^-25.

This is largely because it is a bright and persistent X-ray\npulsar, showing the largest variety of observable phenomena, partly due to the\nfavorable geometry in observing the binary nearly edge-on. Her X-1 is the\nbinary X-ray pulsar in which the first cyclotron line (or Cyclotron Resonant\nScattering Feature - CRSF) was detected in 1975. Since then, we have made an\neffort to observe the source and the CRSF around 40 keV as often as possible,\nusing those X-ray satellites which cover the high energy X-ray range. Extended\ncontributions are from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), {INTEGRAL,\nSuzaku and Swift. The most recent contribution with a new degree of quality is\nfrom the high energy imaging telescope on NuStar. We have found that the CRSF\nis variable with flux, with phase (both pulsational and precessional phase) and\nwith time. The historical evolution of the pulse phase averaged CRSF centroid\nenergy Ecyc since its discovery is characterized by an initial value around 35\nkeV, an abrupt jump upwards to beyond ~40$ keV between 1990 and 1994 and an\napparent secular decay thereafter. Much of this decay, however, was found to be\ndue to an artifact, namely a correlation between Ecyc and the X-ray luminosity\nLx discovered in 2007, amounting to a change of ~7% in energy for a factor of\ntwo in luminosity. In observations since 2007, however, we now find a\nstatistically significant trend of a true secular decrease of the cyclotron\nline energy. In addition, we discuss recent results of pulse phase spectroscopy\nand evidence for the suspected variation in Ecyc with phase of the 35 d\nprecessional period (which is observed both in the modulation of the X-ray flux\nand in the systematic variation in shape of the 1.24 s pulse profile. \n\n"}

This leads to an\nunexpected richness of possible theoretical models able to describe such\nphenomenology. Hints of emission at tens of GeV are indeed known since the\nEGRET observations during the '90s and confirmed in the Fermi-LAT data.\nHowever, our comprehension of these phenomena is still far to be satisfactory.\nIn this respect, the VHE characterization of GRBs may constitute a breakthrough\nfor understanding their physics and, possibly, for providing decisive clues for\nthe discrimination among different proposed emission mechanisms, which are\nbarely distinguishable at lower energies. The current generation of Cherenkov\nobservatories, such as the MAGIC telescopes, have opened the possibility to\nextend the measurement of GRB emission, and in general to any short time-scale\ntransient phenomena, fromfew tens of GeV up to the TeV energy range, with a\nhigher sensitivity with respect to gamma-ray space-based instruments.

Wolf-Rayet stars are the\nmost plausible LGRB progenitors, since the free-fall time of the envelope is\nconsistent with the duration, and the natural outcome of the progenitor is a\nType Ic SN. While a new population of ultra-long GRBs (ULGRBs), GRB 111209A,\nGRB 101225A, and GRB 121027A, has a duration of ~ 10^4 s, two of them are\naccompanied by superluminous-supernova (SLSN) like bumps, which are <~ 10 times\nbrighter than typical hypernovae. Wolf-Rayet progenitors cannot explain ULGRBs\nbecause of too long duration and too bright SN-like bump. A blue supergiant\n(BSG) progenitor model, however, can explain the duration of ULGRBs. Moreover,\nSLSN-like bump can be attributed to the so-called cocoon-fireball photospheric\nemissions (CFPEs).

The\ncause of this low radio detection rate has previously been attributed to\nlimited observing sensitivity.

We investigate this by performing a detailed time-resolved spectral\nanalysis of the superburst from 4U 1636-536 observed in 2001 with the Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer. Superbursts are attributed to the thermonuclear burning\nof carbon, and are approximately 1000 times more energetic than the regular\nshort Type I bursts. This allows us to study detailed spectra for over 11 ks,\ncompared to at most 100 s for regular bursts. A feature is present in the\nsuperburst spectra around 6.4 keV that is well fit with an emission line and an\nabsorption edge, suggestive of reflection of the superburst off the accretion\ndisk. The line and edge parameters evolve over time: the edge energy decreases\nfrom 9.4 keV at the peak to 8.1 keV in the tail, and both features become\nweaker in the tail. This is only the second superburst for which this has been\ndetected, and shows that this behavior is present even without strong radius\nexpansion. Furthermore, we find the persistent flux to almost double during the\nsuperburst, and return to the pre-superburst level in the tail. The combination\nof reflection features and increased persistent emission indicates that the\nsuperburst had a strong impact on the inner accretion disk, and it emphasizes\nthat X-ray bursts provide a unique probe of accretion physics. \n\n"}

As charged particles in\nextensive air showers are deflected by the magnetic field of the Earth, a\ndeformation of the angular distribution of the Cherenkov light, that would be\napproximately symmetric about the shower axis if no magnetic field were\npresent, is expected. In this work we study the variation of the Cherenkov\nlight distribution as a function of the azimuth angle in the plane\nperpendicular to shower axis. It is found that the asymmetry induced by the\ngeomagnetic field is most significant for early stages of shower evolution and\nfor showers arriving almost perpendicular to the vector of the local\ngeomagnetic field. Furthermore, it is shown that ignoring the azimuthal\nasymmetry of Cherenkov light might lead to a significant under- or\noverestimation of the Cherenkov light signal especially at sites where the\nlocal geomagnetic field is strong. Based on CORSIKA simulations, the azimuthal\ndistribution of Cherenkov light is parametrized in dependence on the magnetic\nfield component perpendicular to the shower axis and the local air density.\nThis parametrization provides an efficient approximation for estimating the\nasymmetry of the Cherenkov light distribution for shower simulation and\nreconstruction in cosmic ray and gamma-ray experiments in which the Cherenkov\nsignal of showers with energies above 10^14 eV is observed. \n\n"}

Three of the four detections correspond to\nevents consistent with being optically-obscured \"dark\" bursts. Our overall\ndetection fraction implies that between 9-23% of GRBs between 0.5 < z < 2.5\noccur in galaxies with S_3GHz > 10 uJy, corresponding to SFR >50 Msun/yr at z~1\nor >250 Msun/yr at z~2. Similar galaxies contribute approximately 10-30% of all\ncosmic star-formation, so our results are consistent with a GRB rate which is\nnot strongly biased with respect to the total star-formation rate of a galaxy.\nHowever, all four radio-detected hosts have modest stellar masses (~few x 10^10\nMsun), significantly lower than IR/submillimeter-selected field galaxies of\nsimilar luminosities. We suggest that the GRB rate may be suppressed in\nmetal-rich environments but independently enhanced in intense starbursts,\nproducing a strong efficiency dependence on mass but little net dependence on\nbulk galaxy star-formation rate. \n\n"}

The array consists of 5 telescopes in a square layout with one central\ntelescope, known as the Pevatron eXplorer or PeX. PeX is a PeV (10^{15} eV)\ncosmic ray explorer that aims to study and discover gamma-ray sources in the 1\nto 500 TeV range. The initial PeX design has been influenced by the HEGRA\nCT-System and H.E.S.S. configurations. One important feature of multi-TeV air\nshowers is their ability to trigger telescopes at large core distance (>400m).\nPeX will utilise large core distance events to improve the performance and\nillustrate the viability of a sparse array for multi-TeV gamma-ray astronomy.\n  One important aspect of the thesis (Chapter 6) was the investigation of a new\ntime-based image cleaning method. The arrival time between photons in two\nadjacent pixels in the camera is used to apply an extra cut which helps\nmitigate night sky background. To illustrate the robustness of the time\ncleaning cut, various level of night sky background have been considered.

Current stochastic background searches assume\nthat pulsars in a PTA are separated from each other and the Earth by many GW\nwavelengths. As more millisecond pulsars are discovered and added to PTAs, some\nmay be separated by only a few radiation wavelengths or less, resulting in\ncorrelated GW phase changes between close pulsars in the array. Here we\ninvestigate how PTA overlap reduction functions (ORFs), up to quadrupole order,\nare affected by these additional correlated phase changes, and how they are in\nturn affected by relaxing the assumption that all pulsars are equidistant from\nthe solar system barycenter. We find that in the low frequency GW background\nlimit of $f\\sim10^{-9}$~Hz, and for pulsars at varying distances from the\nEarth, that these additional correlations only affect the ORFs by a few percent\nfor pulsar pairs at large angular separations, as expected. However when nearby\n(order 100 pc) pulsars are separated by less than a few degrees, the correlated\nphase changes can introduce variations of a few tens of percent in the\nmagnitude of the isotropic ORF, and much larger fractional differences in the\nanisotropic ORFs-- up to 188 in the $m=0$, $l=2$ ORF for equidistant pulsars\nseparated by 3 degrees. In fact, the magnitude of most of the anisotropic ORFs\nis largest at small, but non-zero, pulsar separations. Finally, we write down a\nsmall angle approximation for the correlated phase changes which can easily be\nimplemented in search pipelines, and for completeness, examine the behavior of\nthe ORFs for pulsars which lie at a radiation wavelength from the Earth. \n\n"}

We report\non a survey for X-ray cavities in 83 massive, high-redshift (0.4<z<1.2)\nclusters of galaxies selected by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signature in the\nSouth Pole Telescope data.

Further, due to the\nlimitations of Chandra at high redshift, this search misses small (<10 kpc),\nunresolved X-ray cavities at high (z>0.5) redshift. Despite these limitations,\nour results suggest that the power generated by AGN feedback in brightest\ncluster galaxies has remained unchanged for over half of the age of the\nUniverse (>7 Gyrs at z=0.8). On average, the detected X-ray cavities have\npowers of 0.8-5*10^45 erg/s, enthalpies of 3-6*10^59 erg, and radii of 17 kpc.\nIntegrating over 7 Gyrs, we find that the supermassive black holes in the\nbrightest cluster galaxies may have accreted 10^8 to several 10^9M_sun of\nmaterial to power these outflows. This level of accretion indicates that\nsignificant supermassive black hole growth may occur not only at early times,\nin the quasar era, but at late times as well.

In earlier work, it has been\nsuggested that the power released by fast reconnection events between the\nmagnetic field lines lifting from the inner accretion disk region and the lines\nanchored into the central black hole could accelerate relativistic particles\nand produce the observed radio emission from microquasars and low luminosity\nAGNs (LLAGNs). Moreover, it has been proposed that the observed correlation\nbetween the radio emission and the mass of these sources, spanning $10^{10}$\norders of magnitude in mass, might be related to this process. In the present\nwork, we revisit this model comparing two different fast magnetic reconnection\nmechanisms, namely, fast reconnection driven by anomalous resistivity (AR) and\nby turbulence (as described in Lazarian and Vishiniac 1999). We apply the\nscenario above to a much larger sample of sources (including also blazars, and\ngamma-ray bursts - GRBs), and find that LLAGNs and microquasars do confirm the\ntrend above. Furthermore, when driven by turbulence, not only their radio but\nalso their gamma-ray emission can be due to magnetic power released by fast\nreconnection, which may accelerate particles to relativistic velocities in the\ncore region of these sources. Thus the turbulent-driven fast reconnection model\nis able to reproduce better the observed emission than the AR model. On the\nother hand, the emission from blazars and GRBs does not follow the same trend\nas that of the LLAGNs and microquasars, suggesting that the radio and gamma-ray\nemission in these cases is produced further out along the jet, by another\npopulation of relativistic particles, as expected. \n\n"}

However, recently, it has been claimed that nonlinear Landau damping\nrenders it physically irrelevant by reducing the effective damping rate to a\nlow level. Here, we show with numerical calculations that the effective damping\nrate is $8\\times 10^{-4}$ of the growth rate of the linear instability, which\nis sufficient for the \"oblique\" instability to be the dominant cooling\nmechanism of these pair beams. In particular, we show that previous estimates\nof this rate ignored the exponential cutoff in the scattering amplitude at\nlarge wavenumber and assumed that the damping of scattered waves entirely\ndepends on collisions, ignoring collisionless processes. We find that the total\nwave energy eventually grows to approximate equipartition with the beam by\nincreasingly depositing energy into long wavelength modes. As we have not\nincluded the effect of nonlinear wave-wave interactions on these long\nwavelength modes, this scenario represents the \"worst-case\" scenario for the\noblique instability. As it continues to drain energy from the beam at a faster\nrate than other processes, we conclude that the \"oblique\" instability is\nsufficiently strong to make it the physically dominant cooling mechanism for\nhigh-energy pair beams in the intergalactic medium. \n\n"}

The observed anomaly in the positron fraction triggered a\nlot of excitement, as it could be interpreted as an indirect signature of the\npresence of dark matter species in the Galaxy. Alternatively, it could be\nproduced by nearby astrophysical sources, such as pulsars. Both hypotheses are\nprobed in this work in light of the latest AMS-02 positron fraction\nmeasurements. The transport of the primary and secondary positrons in the\nGalaxy is described using a semi-analytic two-zone model. MicrOMEGAs is used to\nmodel the positron flux generated by dark matter species. The description of\nthe positron fraction from astrophysical sources is based on the pulsar\nobservations included in the ATNF catalogue. We find that the mass of the\nfavoured dark matter candidates is always larger than 500 GeV. The only dark\nmatter species that fulfils the numerous gamma ray and cosmic microwave\nbackground bounds is a particle annihilating into four leptons through a light\nscalar or vector mediator, with a mixture of tau (75%) and electron (25%)\nchannels, and a mass between 0.5 and 1 TeV.

The nucleon self-energies are made available online as\nelectronic tables. The discussion is mostly restricted to relativistic\nmean-field models.\n  In the first part of the article, the generic properties of this class of\nmodels at finite temperature and asymmetry are studied. It is found that the\nquadratic expansion of the EOS in terms of asymmetry works reasonably well at\nfinite temperatures and deviations originate mostly from the kinetic part. The\ninteraction part of the symmetry energy is found to be almost temperature\nindependent. At low densities, the account of realistic nucleon masses requires\nthe introduction of a linear term in the expansion.

Our quasi-adiabatic, fully-relativistic analysis shows that:\n(i) gravitational-wave emission does not have a significant effect on the\nevolution of the black hole, (ii) accretion plays an important role and (iii)\nalthough the mass of the scalar cloud developed through superradiance can be a\nsizeable fraction of the black-hole mass, its energy-density is very low and\nbackreaction is negligible.

In this contribution I review the evidence collected during the last\nyears showing that the ridge-lines of helical radio-jets do not correspond to\nobservational artifacts. This conclusion was reached by studying a number of\nVLBI observations of the radio jet in the quasar S5~0836+710 at different\nfrequencies and epochs. The ridge-line of the emission in the jet coincides at\nall frequencies within the errors. Moreover, small differences between the\nridge-lines as observed at different epochs reveal wave-like motion transversal\nto the jet propagation axis.

Abstract: IceCube has reported the detection of a diffuse TeV-PeV neutrino emission,\nfor which the flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) have been proposed to be the\ncandidate sources. Here we assume that the neutrino flux from FSRQs is\nproportional to their gamma-ray ones, and obtain the gamma-ray/neutrino flux\nratio by the diffuse gamma-ray flux from Fermi-LAT measurement of FSRQs and the\ndiffuse neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We apply this ratio to individual\nFSRQs and hence predict their neutrino flux. We find that a large fraction of\ncandidate FSRQs from the northern sky in the IceCube point source search has\npredicted neutrino flux above the IceCube upper limit; and for the sample of\nstacking search for neutrinos by IceCube, the predicted stacked flux is even\nlarger than the upper limit of stacked flux by orders of magnitude. Therefore\nthe IceCube limit from stacking searches, combined with the Fermi-LAT\nobservations, already rejects FSRQs as the main sources of IceCube-detected\ndiffuse neutrinos: FSRQs can only account for <10% (4%) of the IceCube-detected\ndiffuse neutrino flux, according to the stacking searches from the whole\n(northern) sky.

Such parent population\nproved to be very elusive, and escaped direct detection in radio surveys so\nfar. High redshift blazars themselves seem to be failing in producing extended\nradio-lobes, raising questions about the connection between such class and the\nvaster population of radio-galaxies.

For Crab-like spectrum\nsources, the GRID angular resolution (FWHM of ~4deg at 100 MeV; ~0.8deg at 1\nGeV; ~0.9deg integrating the full energy band from 100 MeV to tens of GeV) is\nstable across a large field of view, being characterized by a flat response up\nto 30deg off-axis.

In this article, we construct quasi-equilibrium\nconfigurations for different spins, eccentricities, mass ratios, compactnesses,\nand equations of state. For this purpose we employ the SGRID code, which allows\nus to construct such data in previously inaccessible regions of the parameter\nspace. In particular, we consider spinning neutron stars in isolation and in\nbinary systems; we incorporate new methods to produce highly eccentric and\neccentricity reduced data; we present the possibility of computing data for\nsignificantly unequal-mass binaries; and we create equal-mass binaries with\nindividual compactness up to 0.23. As a proof of principle, we explore the\ndynamical evolution of three new configurations. First, we simulate a $q=2.06$\nmass ratio which is the highest mass ratio for a binary neutron star evolved in\nnumerical relativity to date. We find that mass transfer from the companion\nstar sets in a few revolutions before merger and a rest mass of\n$\\sim10^{-2}M_\\odot$ is transferred between the two stars. This configuration\nalso ejects a large amount of material during merger, imparting a substantial\nkick to the remnant. Second, we simulate the first merger of a precessing\nbinary neutron star. We present the dominant modes of the gravitational waves\nfor the precessing simulation, where a clear imprint of the precession is\nvisible in the (2,1) mode.

Originally the luminosity was expected in high-energy X-rays\nor gamma-rays, however we conjecture that some of the battery power is emitted\nin the radio bandwidth. While the luminosity and timescale are suggestive of\nfast radio bursts (FRBs; millisecond-scale radio transients) NS--BH coalescence\nrates are too low to make these a primary FRB source. Instead, we propose the\ntransients form a FRB sub-population, distinguishable by a double peak with a\nprecursor.

Current timing algorithms\nroutinely correct pulse times of arrival (TOAs) for time-variable delays due to\ncold plasma dispersion. However, none of the major pulsar timing groups correct\nfor delays due to scattering from multi-path propagation in the ISM. Scattering\nintroduces a frequency-dependent phase change in the signal that results in\npulse broadening and arrival time delays. Any method to correct the TOA for\ninterstellar propagation effects must be based on multi-frequency measurements\nthat can effectively separate dispersion and scattering delay terms from\nfrequency-independent perturbations such as those due to a gravitational wave.\nCyclic spectroscopy, first described in an astronomical context by Demorest\n(2011), is a potentially powerful tool to assist in this multi-frequency\ndecomposition.

In most scenarios the median of the false alarm probability (FAP)\nestimator under the \"all samples\" mode is consistent with the exact FAP. On the\nother hand the \"coincidence removal\" mode is found to be unbiased for the mean\nof the estimated FAP. While the numerical values at which discrepancies become\napparent are specific to the details of our experiment, we believe that the\nqualitative differences in the behaviour of the median and mean of the FAP\nestimator have more general validity.

Its prime scientific\ngoal is to measure the masses and radii of non-accreting neutron stars via fits\nto the energy-dependent waveforms produced by the rotation of hot spots on\ntheir surfaces. These measurements will provide valuable input to theoretical\nmodels of cold matter beyond nuclear density. Here we propose that PSR\nJ1614$-$2230, despite its low count rate, is a promising source to observe with\nNICER. The reason is that XMM-Newton observations suggest that the fractional\noscillation amplitude from PSR J1614$-$2230 could be high enough that this star\ncannot be very compact.

The dip-like feature has been observed up to $\\sim$70 keV. The\n1-110 keV broad-band spectroscopy of both observations revealed that the\nbest-fit model comprised of a partially absorbed Negative and Positive power\nlaw with EXponential cutoff (NPEX) continuum model along with a blackbody\ncomponent for the soft X-ray excess and two Gaussian functions at 6.4 and 6.7\nkeV for emission lines.

In extremely low\naccretion rate systems, the collisional mean-free path of electrons is large\ncompared with the length-scale of the system, thus thermal conduction is\ndynamically important. When the magnetic field is present, the thermal\nconduction is anisotropic and energy transport is along magnetic field lines.\nIn this paper, we study the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction on the\nwind production in hot accretion flows by performing two-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations. We find that thermal conduction has only\nmoderate effects on the mass flux of wind. But the energy flux of wind can be\nincreased by a factor of $\\sim 10$ due to the increase of wind velocity when\nthermal conduction is included. The increase of wind velocity is because of the\nincrease of driving forces (e.g. gas pressure gradient force and centrifugal\nforce) when thermal conduction is included.

Axions (or any bosons) in this mass range cause\nrapidly rotating BHs to shed their spin into a large cloud of axions in atomic\nBohr orbits around the BH, through the effect of superradiance (SR).

Using this structure FermiFAST rapidly finds the photons that could\nhave originated from a potential gamma-ray source. It calculates a likehihood\nratio for the contribution of the potential source using the angular\ndistribution of the photons within the region of interest.

However, there are\nmany types-1 AGNs with unexplained intermediate values for both positional\nangles and polarization degrees. Our explanation of polarization degree and\npositional angle of Seyfert-1 AGNs focuses on the reflection of non-polarized\nradiation from sub-parsec jets in optically thick accretion discs.

The p/He decrease is often\ninterpreted in terms of particle-dependent acceleration, which is in contrast\nwith the universal nature of DSA mechanisms. A different explanation is that\nthe p-He anomaly reflects a flux transition between two components: a sub-TeV\nflux component (L) provided by hydrogen-rich supernova remnants with soft\nacceleration spectra, and a multi-TeV component (G) injected by younger sources\nwith amplified magnetic fields and hard spectra. In this scenario the\nuniversality of particle acceleration is not violated because both sources\nprovide composition-blind injection spectra. The present work is aimed at\ntesting this model using the low-energy CR flux which is expected to be\nL-dominated. However, at $E\\sim\\,$0.5-10 GeV, the fluxes are affected by energy\nlosses and solar modulation for which a proper modeling is required.

Our 3-D hydrodynamic AGN jet-ICM\n(intracluster medium) simulations, looking at the detailed angular momentum\ndistribution of cold gas and its time variability for the first time, show that\nthe angular momentum of the cold gas crossing $\\lesssim 1$ kpc is essentially\nisotropic.

We conclude that both DMEOSs and\ncentral pressure ratios of DM to NM affect the slope of the mass-radius\nrelation of DMANSs. This is because of the interaction between DM and NM, which\nleads to gravitationally or self-bound DMANSs. We study the radius of the NM\nsphere as well as the radius of the DM halo for different DMANSs.

As photons from different\nbands emerge from different radial ranges in the accretion disk, the lags\nconstrain the sizes of the accretion disks. We select 240 quasars with\nredshifts $z \\approx 1$ or $z \\approx 0.3$ that are relatively emission line\nfree. The light curves are sampled from day to month timescales, which makes it\npossible to detect lags on the scale of the light crossing time of the\naccretion disks. With the code JAVELIN, we detect typical lags of several days\nin the rest frame between the $g$ band and the $riz$ bands. The detected lags\nare $\\sim 2-3$ times larger than the light crossing time estimated from the\nstandard thin disk model, consistent with the recently measured lag in NGC5548\nand micro-lensing measurements of quasars. The lags in our sample are found to\nincrease with increasing luminosity. Furthermore, the increase in lags going\nfrom $g-r$ to $g-i$ and then to $g-z$ is slower than predicted in the thin disk\nmodel, particularly for high luminosity quasars.

We\nperform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core\ncluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via\ncollimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via\nstreaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming\ninstability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient\nneeded for AGN feedback to self-regulate, at least within the context of the\nphysical model considered here. When CR streaming is neglected, the suppression\nof CR mixing with the ICM by magnetic fields significantly reduces ICM heating,\nwhich leads to cooling catastrophes. In the opposite case, CRs come into\ncontact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, which results in globally\nstable atmospheres. Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the\ncentral AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present. We find that\nCR streaming heating dominates over the heating due to Coulomb and hadronic\nprocesses. Importantly, in simulations that include CR streaming, CR pressure\nsupport in the central 100 kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate\nobservational constraints. On the contrary, when CR streaming is neglected, CR\nenergy is not spent on the ICM heating and CR pressure builds up to the level\nthat is in disagreement with the data. Overall, our models demonstrate that CR\nheating is a viable channel for the thermalization of AGN energy in clusters,\nand likely also in elliptical galaxies, and that CRs play an important role in\ndetermining AGN intermittency and the dynamical state of cool core atmospheres. \n\n"}

Motivated by the recent measurements from\nthe Pierre Auger Observatory, which indicates a metal-rich cosmic-ray\ncomposition at ultrahigh energies, we investigate the fate of UHECR nuclei\nloaded in TDE jets. First, we consider the production and survival of UHECR\nnuclei at internal shocks, external forward and reverse shocks, and\nnonrelativistic winds. Based on the observations of Swift J1644+57, we show\nthat the UHECRs can survive for external reverse and forward shocks, and disk\nwinds. On the other hand, UHECR nuclei are significantly disintegrated in\ninternal shocks, although they could survive for low-luminosity TDE jets.\nAssuming that UHECR nuclei can survive, we consider implications of different\ncomposition models of TDEs.

The observed mean\ndepth of the shower maximum and its deviation could be explained by\noxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs, but they may be too rare to be the sources\nof UHECRs. \n\n"}

The ultra-long duration GRB 111209A, one of the\nlongest GRBs ever detected, also has the best-monitored afterglow in this rare\nclass of GRBs. We want to address the question whether GRB 111209A was a\nspecial event beyond its extreme duration alone, and whether it is a classical\nGRB or another kind of high-energy transient. The afterglow may yield\nsignificant clues. We present afterglow photometry obtained in seven bands with\nthe GROND imager as well as in further seven bands with the UVOT telescope\non-board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The light curve is analysed by\nmulti-band modelling and joint fitting with power-laws and broken power-laws,\nand we use the contemporaneous GROND data to study the evolution of the\nspectral energy distribution. We compare the optical afterglow to a large\nensemble we have analysed in earlier works, and especially to that of another\nultra-long event, GRB 130925A. We furthermore undertake a photometric study of\nthe host galaxy. We find a strong, chromatic rebrightening event at approx 0.8\ndays after the GRB, during which the spectral slope becomes redder. After this,\nthe light curve decays achromatically, with evidence for a break at about 9\ndays after the trigger. The afterglow luminosity is found to not be\nexceptional. We find that a double-jet model is able to explain the chromatic\nrebrightening. The afterglow features have been detected in other events and\nare not unique. The duration aside, the GRB prompt emission and afterglow\nparameters of GRB 111209A are in agreement with the known distributions for\nthese parameters. While the central engine of this event may differ from that\nof classical GRBs, there are multiple lines of evidence pointing to GRB 111209A\nresulting from the core-collapse of a massive star with a stripped envelope. \n\n"}

For many of them, we must measure their\nperiods and determine timing solutions relying on the timing of their\nindividual pulses, while some of the less sporadic RRATs can be timed by using\nfolding techniques as we do for other pulsars. Here, based on Parkes and Green\nBank Telescope (GBT) observations, we introduce our results on eight RRATs\nincluding their timing-derived rotation parameters, positions, and dispersion\nmeasures (DMs), along with a comparison of the spin-down properties of RRATs\nand normal pulsars. Using data for 24 RRATs, we find that their period\nderivatives are generally larger than those of normal pulsars, independent of\nany intrinsic correlation with period, indicating that RRATs' highly sporadic\nemission may be associated with intrinsically larger magnetic fields. We carry\nout Lomb$-$Scargle tests to search for periodicities in RRATs' pulse detection\ntimes with long timescales.

However, several RRATs exhibit power-law tails, as seen for\npulsars emitting giant pulses. This, along with consideration of the selection\neffects against the detection of weak pulses, imply that RRAT pulses generally\nrepresent the tail of a normal intensity distribution. \n\n"}

In addition, the maximum energy\nof acceleration capability of the sources grows linearly in Z, while the energy\nloss per distance traveled decreases with increasing A. Each of these two\npoints tend to favor heavy nuclei at the highest energies. The traditional\nbi-dimensional analyses, which simultaneously reproduce Auger data on the\nspectrum and nuclear composition, may not be capable of incorporating the\nrelative importance of these phenomena.

A white noise power spectral density (PSD) is expected at low\nfrequency in this model, however, direct observational constraint to the low\nfrequency PSD slope is hard due to limited lengths of the light curves\navailable.

We argue that the process generating\ncircular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose\nthat the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength\nsample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly\npolarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.\nCircular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or\nshorter than our median sampling interval <1 month. Longer time scales of about\none year are occasionally detected, but severely limited by the weakness of the\nsignal. At variance with some longer wavelength investigations we find that the\nsign of circular polarisation changes in most sources, while only 7 sources,\nincluding 3 already known, have a strong preference for one sign. The degrees\nof circular and linear polarisation do not show any systematic correlation. We\ndo find however one particular event where the two polarisation degrees vary in\nsynchronism during a time span of 0.9 years. The paper also describes a novel\nmethod for calibrating the sign of circular polarisation observations. \n\n"}

This mass-energy loss\ngenerates an outward-propagating pressure wave that steepens into a shock near\nthe stellar surface, potentially powering a weak transient associated with an\notherwise-failed supernova.

Such rare objects probably also dominated\nthe production of X-rays in the early Universe. We demonstrate that a ULX with\nLx~10^40-10^41 erg/s (isotropic-equivalent luminosity in the 0.1-10 keV energy\nband) shining for ~10^5 years (the expected duration of a supercritically\naccreting phase in HMXBs) can significantly ionise the ISM in its host dwarf\ngalaxy of total mass M~10^7-10^8 Msun and thereby reduce its opacity to soft\nX-rays. As a result, the fraction of the soft X-ray (below 1 keV) radiation\nfrom the ULX escaping into the intergalactic medium (IGM) can increase from\n~20-50% to ~30-80% over its lifetime. This implies that HMXBs can induce a\nstronger heating of the IGM at z>10 compared to estimates neglecting the ULX\nfeedback on the ISM. However, larger galaxies with M>3 x 10^8 Msun could not be\nsignificantly ionised even by the brightest ULXs in the early Universe.

There is no intrinsic flux-related\nspectral change in the the variable components in any band with small apparent\nvariations due only to contamination by a second constant component, possibly a\n(hard) reflection component in the X-rays and the (red) host galaxy in the\nUV/optical bands. Relative to the shortest wavelength band, UVW2, the lags of\nthe other UV and optical bands are mostly in agreement with the predictions of\nreprocessing of high energy emission from an accretion disc. The U-band lag is,\nhowever, far larger than expected, almost certainly because of reprocessed\nBalmer continuum emission from the more distant broad line region gas. The UVW2\nband is well correlated with the X-rays but lags by ~6x more than expected if\nthe UVW2 results from reprocessing of X-rays on the accretion disc. However, if\nthe lightcurves are filtered to remove variations on timescales >5d, the lag\napproaches the expectation from disc reprocessing. MEMEcho analysis shows that\ndirect X-rays can be the driver of most of the variations in the UV/optical\nbands as long as the response functions for those bands all have long tails (up\nto 10d) in addition to a strong peak (from disc reprocessing) at short lag\n(<1d). We interpret the tails as due to reprocessing from the surrounding gas.\nComparison of X-ray to UVW2 and UVW2 to V-band lags for 4 AGN, including NGC\n4593, shows that all have UVW2 to V-band lags which exceed the expectations\nfrom disc resprocessing by factor < 2.

TSV is an edge-smoothing variant of Total Variation (TV), leading\nto reducing the sum of squared gradients. First, we demonstrate that our\ntechnique may achieve super-resolution of $\\sim 30$% compared to the\ntraditional CLEAN beam size using synthetic observations of two point sources.\nSecond, we present simulated observations of three physically motivated static\nmodels of Sgr A* with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) to show the performance\nof proposed techniques in greater detail. We find that $\\ell_1$+TSV\nregularization outperforms $\\ell_1$+TV regularization with the popular\nisotropic TV term and the Cotton-Schwab CLEAN algorithm, demonstrating that TSV\nis well-matched to the expected physical properties of the astronomical images,\nwhich are often nebulous.

Abstract: Although type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are very useful in many astrophysical\nfields, their exact progenitor nature is still unclear.

Observationally,\nsome SNe Ia show such signal, while the others do not. Here, we propose a\nuniversal model to explain these observations based on the spin-up/spin-down\nmodel, in which a white dwarf (WD) will experience a spin-down phase before\nsupernova explosion, and the spin-down timescale is determined by its initial\nmass, i.e. the more massive the initial WD, the shorter the spin-down timescale\nand then the more likely the SN Ia to show the SD signature. Therefore, our\nmodel predicts that the SNe Ia from hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon WDs are more\nlikely to show the SD signature observationally, as some peculiar SNe Ia\nshowed. \n\n"}

These joint detections allow us to probe\ngravitational-wave sources in greater detail and provide us with the\npossibility of confidently establishing events that would not have been\ndetected in gravitational-wave data alone. In this paper, we explore the\nprospects of using the electromagnetic follow-up of low-significance\ngravitational-wave event candidates to increase the sample of confident\ndetections with electromagnetic counterparts.

In the firn, the index of refraction\nchanges due to the transition from snow at the surface to glacial ice below,\naffecting the propagation of radio signals in that region. We compare our\nobservations to a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) electromagnetic wave\nsimulation, which supports the existence of three classes of propagation: a\nbulk propagation ray-bending mode that leads to so-called \"shadowed\" regions\nfor certain geometries of transmission, a surface-wave mode induced by the\nice/air interface, and an arbitrary-depth horizontal propagation mode that\nrequires perturbations from a smooth density gradient. In the non-shadowed\nregion, our measurements are consistent with the bulk propagation ray-bending\nmode both in timing and in amplitude. We also observe signals in the shadowed\nregion, in conflict with a bulk-propagation-only ray-bending model, but\nconsistent with FDTD simulations using a variety of firn models for Summit\nStation.

The 'shadow' is\ncaused by the Circum Nuclear Disk that surrounds SgrA* at a distance of about 1\nto 2 parsec. This detection allows us to do a detailed investigation of the\nphysical properties of the surroundings of the super massive black hole.\nFurther in, the cluster of high velocity stars orbiting the central super\nmassive black hole SgrA* represents an ideal probe for the gravitational\npotential and the degree of relativity that one can attribute to this area.\nRecently, three of the closest stars (S2, S38, and S55/S0-102) have been used\nto conduct these investigations. In addition to the black hole mass and\ndistance a relativistic parameter defined as ${\\Upsilon}=r_s/r_p$ could be\nderived for star S2.

The newly\nintroduced fields share an odd charge under a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ parity symmetry.\nThis model, commonly known as \"Scotogenic\", was designed to provide a mechanism\nfor active neutrino mass generation as well as a viable dark matter candidate.\nIn this paper we consider a scenario in which the dark matter particle is at\nthe keV-scale. Such particle is free from X-ray limits due to the unbroken\nparity symmetry that forbids the mixing between active and right-handed\nneutrinos. The active neutrino masses are radiatively generated from the new\nscalars and the two heavier right-handed states with $\\sim \\mathcal{O}(100)$\nGeV masses. These heavy fermions can produce the observed baryon asymmetry of\nthe Universe through the combination of Akhmedov-Rubakov-Smirnov mechanism and\nrecently proposed scalar decays.

Using data from the GMRT we show\nthat post-correlation beamformation results in a many-folds increase in the\nsignal-to-noise for periodic signals from pulsars and several order of\nmagnitude reduction in the number of false triggers from single pulse events\nlike fast radio bursts (FRBs). This difference arises primarily because the\npost-correlation beam contains less red-noise, as well as less radio frequency\ninterference. The post-correlation beam can also be more easily calibrated than\nthe incoherent or phased array beams. We also discuss two different modes of\npost-correlation beamformation, viz. (1) by subtracting the incoherent beam\nfrom the coherent beam and (2) by phased addition of the visibilities. The\ncomputational costs for both these beamformation techniques as well as their\nsuitability for studies of pulsars and FRBs are discussed. Techniques discussed\nhere would be of interest for all upcoming surveys with interferometric arrays.\nFinally, we describe a time-domain survey with the GMRT using the\npost-correlation beamformation as a case study. We find that post-correlation\nbeamforming will improve the current GMRT time-domain survey sensitivity by ~ 2\ntimes for pulsars with periods of few 100s of millisecond and by many-folds for\neven slower pulsars, making it one of the most sensitive surveys for pulsars\nand FRBs at low and mid radio frequencies. \n\n"}

They are believed to be dusty\nstarbursts, and hence should have high rates of supernovae (multiple events per\nyear). Due to their extremely dusty environment, however, such supernovae could\nonly be detected in restframe infrared and longer wavelengths, where our\ncurrent facilities lack the capability of finding them individually beyond the\nlocal universe. We propose a new technique for higher redshifts, which is to\nsearch for the presence of supernovae through the variability of the integrated\nrest-frame infrared light of the entire hosts. We present a pilot study to\nassess the feasibility of this technique. We exploit a unique region, the \"IRAC\nDark Field\" (IDF), that the Spitzer Space Telescope has observed for more than\n14 years in 3--5 micron. The IDF also has deep far-infrared data (200--550\nmicron) from the Herschel Space Observatory that allow us to select\nhigh-redshift (U)LIRGs. We obtain a sample of (U)LIRGs that have secure optical\ncounterparts, and examine their light curves in 3--5 micron. While the\nvariabilities could also be caused by AGNs, we show that such contaminations\ncan be identified. We present two cases where the distinct features in their\nlight curves are consistent with multiple supernovae overlapping in time.\nSearching for supernovae this way will be relevant to the James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST) to probe high-redshift (U)LIRGs into their nuclear regions\nwhere JWST will be limited by its resolution. \n\n"}

{"id": "1808.02858", "contents": "Title: Tidal Deformabilities and Neutron Star Mergers Abstract: Finite size effects in a neutron star merger are manifested, at leading\norder, through the tidal deformabilities (Lambdas) of the stars. If strong\nfirst-order phase transitions do not exist within neutron stars, both neutron\nstars are described by the same equation of state, and their Lambdas are highly\ncorrelated through their masses even if the equation of state is unknown. If,\nhowever, a strong phase transition exists between the central densities of the\ntwo stars, so that the more massive star has a phase transition and the least\nmassive star does not, this correlation will be weakened. In all cases, a\nminimum Lambda for each neutron star mass is imposed by causality, and a less\nconservative limit is imposed by the unitary gas constraint, both of which we\ncompute. In order to make the best use of gravitational wave data from mergers,\nit is important to include the correlations relating the Lambdas and the masses\nas well as lower limits to the Lambdas as a function of mass. Focusing on the\ncase without strong phase transitions, and for mergers where the chirp mass\nM_chirp<1.4M_sun, which is the case for all observed double neutron star\nsystems where a total mass has been accurately measured, we show that the\ndimensionless Lambdas satisfy Lambda_1/Lambda_2= q^6, where q=M_2/M_1 is the\nbinary mass ratio; $M$ is mass of each star, respectively. Moreover, they are\nbounded by q^{n_-}>Lambda_1/Lambda_2> q^{n_{0+}+qn_{1+}}, where\nn_-<n_{0+}+qn_{1+}; the parameters depend only on M_chirp, which is accurately\ndetermined from the gravitational-wave signal. We also provide analytic\nexpressions for the wider bounds that exist in the case of a strong phase\ntransition. We argue that bounded ranges for Lambda_1/Lambda_2, tuned to\nM_chirp, together with lower bounds to Lambda(M), will be more useful in\ngravitational waveform modeling than other suggested approaches. \n\n"}

A thermonuclear helium flash in the\nstar's envelope powered a burst that reached the Eddington limit.

According to the theoretical model, the optical\nradiation from a neutron star merger originates from the radioactive decay of\nunstable nuclides freshly synthesized in the merger ejecta.

For typical BH binaries with masses $m_{1,2}\\simeq\n20M_\\odot-30M_\\odot$ and initial semimajor axis $a_0\\sim100$ AU (such that the\nbinaries have no chance of merging by themselves within $\\sim10^{10}$ yrs), we\nshow that binary-binary interactions can significantly increase the LK window\nfor mergers (the range of companion inclinations that allows the BH binary to\nmerge within 10~Gyrs). This increase arises from a secular resonance between\nthe LK oscillation of the BH binary and the nodal precession of the outer\n(binary-binary) orbit driven by the tertiary binary. Therefore, in the presence\nof tertiary binary, the BH merger fraction is increased to $10-30\\%$, an order\nof magnitude larger than the merger fraction found in similar triple systems.\nOur analysis (with appropriate scalings) can be easily adapted to other\nconfigurations of systems, such as relatively compact BH binaries and\nmoderately hierarchical triples, which may generate even higher merger\nfractions. Since the occurrence rate of stellar quadruples in the galactic\nfields is not much smaller than that of stellar triples, our result suggests\nthat dynamically induced BH mergers in quadruple systems may be an important\nchannel of producing BH mergers observed by LIGO/VIRGO. \n\n"}

The machine learning\nmodel is then applied to available observed parameters for Galactic GCs to\nidentify which of them that are most likely to be hosting a sizeable number of\nBHs and reveal insights into what properties lead to the formation of BH\nsubsystems. With our machine learning model, we were able to shortlist 21\nGalactic GCs that are most likely to contain a BH subsystem. We show that the\nclusters shortlisted by the machine learning classifier include those in which\nBH candidates have been observed (M22, M10 and NGC 3201) and that our results\nline up well with independent simulations and previous studies that manually\ncompared simulated GC models with observed properties of Galactic GCs.

Detections of gravitational waves from\nthese sources by LIGO and Virgo have garnered widespread media and public\nattention. Among these sources, precessing systems (with misaligned black-hole\nspin/orbital angular momentum) are of particular interest because of the rich\ndynamics they offer. However, these systems are, in turn, more complex compared\nto nonprecessing systems, making them harder to model or develop intuition\nabout. Visualizations of numerical simulations of precessing systems provide a\nmeans to understand and gain insights about these systems. However, since these\nsimulations are very expensive, they can only be performed at a small number of\npoints in parameter space.

We find a formula to estimate the extension based on\nthe observed bolometric light curves and show that for most SNe IIP 56Ni\nextends the plateau by about 20%. Another effect of 56Ni consists in reduction\nof the plateau decline rate, i.e. 56Ni presented in the ejecta flattens the\nplateau.

We started\na long-term monitoring campaign with Swift (45 observations), Chandra (5\nobservations) and NuSTAR (4 observations) from the activation until 2018 April.\nDuring the campaign, Swift BAT registered the occurrence of multiple bursts,\naccompanied by two other enhancements of the X-ray persistent flux. The long\ntime span covered by our observations allowed us to study the spectral as well\nas the timing evolution of the source. After 11 months since the 2017 May\noutburst onset, the observed flux was about 15 times higher than its historical\nminimum level and a factor of 3 higher than the level reached after the 2006\noutburst. This suggests that the crust has not fully relaxed to the quiescent\nlevel, or that the source quiescent level has changed following the multiple\noutburst activities in the past 10 years or so. This is another case of\nmultiple outbursts from the same source on a yearly time scale, a somehow\nrecently discovered behaviour in magnetars. \n\n"}

AT2017gfo was\nthe first kilonova that could be extensively monitored in time both\nphotometrically and spectroscopically.

In this work, we aim\nto search the fingerprints of AT2017gfo-like kilonova emissions in the\noptical/NIR light curves of 39 short GRBs with known redshift. For the first\ntime, our results allow us to study separately the range of luminosity of the\nblue and red components of AT2017gfo-like kilonovae in short GRBs. In\nparticular, the red component is similar in luminosity to AT2017gfo, while the\nblue kilonova can be more than 10 times brighter.

From fitting of the {\\it\nNuSTAR} data of 10 sources, we derived clear $E_{cut}$ values for the first\ntime in 8 sources and a lower limit in one source, thereby, doubling the number\nof AGN with $E_{cut}$ measurements from {\\it NuSTAR} data. Broad Fe K$\\alpha$\nline was noticed in 7 sources, while, excess emission in the energy range\nbeyond $\\sim$15 keV arising from Compton reflection was seen in all the\nsources. We also investigated the correlation of $E_{cut}$ with various\nphysical characteristics of the AGN such as black hole mass ($M_{BH}$),\nEddington ratio ($\\lambda_{Edd.}$) and X-ray photon index ($\\Gamma$). We found\nno correlation between $E_{cut}$ and $M_{BH}$ and between $E_{cut}$ and\n$\\lambda_{Edd.}$, however, $E_{cut}$ correlates with $\\Gamma$ in a complex\nmanner. Also, timing analysis of the 10 sources indicates that they all are\nvariable with indications of more variations in the soft band relative to the\nhard band in some individual sources, however, considering all the sources\ntogether, the variations are indistinguishable between hard and soft bands. \n\n"}

We confirm that\nthe overall properties of the opacity are not significantly affected by the\naccuracies of the atomic calculations. The impact to the Planck mean opacity is\nup to a factor of 1.5, which affects the timescale of kilonova at most 20 %.\nHowever, we find that the wavelength dependent features in the opacity are\naffected by the accuracies of the calculations.

New generation superbeams or beta-beams need giant\ndetectors. The liquid Argon TPC technology has great potentials for both\napplications. Although the ICARUS program has demonstrated that this technology\nis mature, the possibility to built a giant liquid argon TPC is viewed by many\nas a technically impossible and unsafe task.

Such a detector would in addition cover a broad physics program,\nincluding the observation of atmospheric neutrinos, solar neutrinos, supernova\nneutrinos, and search for proton decays, in addition to the accelerator physics\nprogram.
