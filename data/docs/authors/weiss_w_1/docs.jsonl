Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

This result\nnot only supports the earlier finding that the azimuthal and polar widths of\nthese subbeams narrow with distance (as R^(-3) and R^(-1), respectively), but\nalso implies that the boundary contribution to the solution of the wave\nequation governing the radiation field does not always vanish in the limit\nwhere the boundary tends to infinity. There is a fundamental difference between\nthe classical expressions for the retarded potential and field: while the\nboundary contribution for the potential can always be made zero via a gauge\ntransformation preserving the Lorenz condition, that for the field may be\nneglected only if it diminishes with distance faster than the contribution of\nthe source density in the far zone. In the case of a rotating superluminal\nsource, however, the boundary term in the retarded solution for the field is by\na factor of order R^(1/2) larger than the source term of this solution in the\nlimit, which explains why an argument based on the solution of the wave\nequation governing the field that neglects the boundary term (such as that\npresented by J.

Given\nthat the distribution of the radiation field of an accelerated superluminal\nsource in the far zone is not known a priori, the only way to calculate the\nfree-space radiation field of such sources is via the retarded solution for the\npotential.

This particular subset of the 'superdisk' radio galaxies is\nchosen because of a highly asymmetric location of the host elliptical galaxy\nrelative to the gap's central axis. In addition to posing a considerable\nchallenge to the existing models, such a morphology also means that the two\njets traverse highly unequal distances through the superdisk material. One thus\nhas a possibility to directly investigate if the marked asymmetry between the\ntwo jets' interaction with the (much denser) ambient medium, during their\npropagation, has a significant import for the brightness of the hotspot forming\nnear each jet's extremity. We also propose a new explanation for the formation\nof superdisks through the merger of a smaller elliptical galaxy with the\nmassive host, in which the gas attached to the infalling galaxy deposits its\nangular momentum into the host's circumgalactic gas, thereby causing it to\nflatten into a fat pancake, or superdisk. The asymmetric location of the host\ngalaxy can be assisted by the kick imparted to it during the merger.

Weak lensing signals are\ndetected at high significance for all four clusters, whose redshifts range from\nz=0.28 to 0.64. We demonstrate that adding strong lensing information with\nknown arc redshifts significantly improves constraints on the mass density\nprofile, compared to those obtained from weak lensing alone. While the mass\nprofiles are well fitted by the universal form predicted in N-body simulations\nof the LCDM model, all four clusters appear to be slightly more centrally\nconcentrated (the concentration parameters c_vir \\sim 8) than theoretical\npredictions, even after accounting for the bias toward higher concentrations\ninherent in lensing selected samples.

However, in order to fit the strong break in\nw(theta) at theta=10 arcsec, nearly all satellite galaxies in the DRG\nluminosity range are required to be DRGs. Within this luminosity-threshold\nsample, the fraction of galaxies that are DRGs is ~44%, implying that the\nformation of DRGs is more efficient for satellite galaxies than for central\ngalaxies. Despite the evolved stellar populations contained within DRGs at\nz=2.3, 90% of satellite galaxies in the DRG luminosity range have been accreted\nwithin 500 Myr. Thus, satellite DRGs must have known they would become\nsatellites well before the time of their accretion. This implies that the\nformation of DRGs correlates with large-scale environment at fixed halo mass,\nalthough the large-scale bias of DRGs can be well fit without such assumptions.\nFurther data are required to resolve this issue. Using the observational\nestimate that ~30% of DRGs have no ongoing star formation, we infer a timescale\nfor star formation quenching for satellite galaxies of 450 Myr, although the\nuncertainty on this number is large. However, unless all non-star forming\nsatellite DRGs were quenched before accretion, the quenching timescale is\nsignificantly shorter than z~0 estimates.

Taking into account the Doppler effects, the model naturally\nreproduces the broken power-law turbulence spectra observed in the solar wind\nand predicts that a higher break frequency always comes along with a softer\ndissipation range spectrum that may be caused by the increase of the turbulence\nintensity, the reciprocal of the plasma \\beta, and/or the angle between the\nsolar wind velocity and the mean magnetic field. These predictions can be\ntested by detailed comparisons with more accurate observations. \n\n"}

Abstract: Type II-linear supernovae are thought to arise from progenitors that have\nlost most of their H envelope by the time of the explosion, and they are poorly\nunderstood because they are only occasionally discovered. It is possible that\nthey are intrinsically rare, but selection effects due to their rapid\nluminosity evolution may also play an important role in limiting the number of\ndetections. In this context, the discovery of a subluminous type II-linear\nevent is even more interesting. We investigate the physical properties and\ncharacterise the explosion site of the type II SN 1999ga, which exploded in the\nnearby spiral galaxy NGC 2442. Spectroscopic and photometric observations of SN\n1999ga allow us to constrain the energetics of the explosion and to estimate\nthe mass of the ejected material, shedding light on the nature of the\nprogenitor star in the final stages of its life. The study of the environment\nin the vicinity of the explosion site provides information on a possible\nrelation between these unusual supernovae and the properties of the galaxies\nhosting them. Despite the lack of early-time observations, we provide\nreasonable evidence that SN 1999ga was probably a type II-linear supernova that\nejected a few solar masses of material, with a very small amount of radioactive\nelements of the order of 0.01 solar masses. \n\n"}

The survey galaxies are assumed\nto be pre-selected active, star-forming galaxies observed by their line\nemission with a constant number density across the redshift bin. Star-forming\ngalaxies have a redshift desert in the region 1.6 < z < 2, and so this redshift\nrange was excluded from the analysis. We use the Seo & Eisenstein (2007)\nfitting formula for the accuracies of the BAO measurements, using only the\ninformation for the oscillatory part of the power spectrum as distance and\nexpansion rate rulers. We go beyond our earlier analysis by examining the\neffect of including curvature on the optimal survey configuration and updating\nthe expected `prior' constraints from Planck and SDSS. We once again find that\nthe optimal survey strategy involves minimizing the exposure time and\nmaximizing the survey area (within the instrumental constraints), and that all\ntime should be spent observing in the low-redshift range (z<1.6) rather than\nbeyond the redshift desert, z>2.

A number of analyses have been carried out\nto investigate the dynamical behaviour and consequences of these discs,\nincluding disc thickness and eccentricity growth as well as mutual interaction\nand warping. However, most of these studies have neglected the influence of the\nstellar cusp surrounding the black hole, which is believed to be 1-2 orders of\nmagnitude more massive than the disc(s).\n  By means of N-body integrations using our bhint code, we study the impact of\nstellar cusps of different compositions. We find that although the presence of\na cusp does have an important effect on the evolution of an otherwise isolated\nflat disc, its influence on the evolution of disc thickness and warping is\nrather mild in a two-disc configuration. However, we show that the creation of\nhighly eccentric orbits strongly depends on the graininess of the cusp (i.e.\nthe mean and maximum stellar masses): While Chang (2009) recently found that\nfull cycles of Kozai resonance are prevented by the presence of an analytic\ncusp, we show that relaxation processes play an important role in such highly\ndense regions and support short-term resonances. We thus find that young disc\nstars on initially circular orbits can achieve high eccentricities by resonant\neffects also in the presence of a cusp of stellar remnants, yielding a\nmechanism to create S-stars and hyper-velocity stars.\n  Furthermore, we discuss the underlying initial mass function (IMF) of the\nyoung stellar discs and find no definite evidence for a non-canonical IMF. \n\n"}

That is why both phenomena should be taken into account\nside by side, as the gravitational collapse is considered. Since, under the\nabove transition, the hadronic-phase vacuum (filled up with gluon and chiral\n$q\\bar q$-condensates) turns into the \"empty\" (perturbation) subhadronic-phase\none and, thus, the corresponding (very high) pressure falls down rather\nabruptly, the formerly cold (degenerated) nuclear medium starts to implode into\nthe new vacuum. If the mass of a star is sufficiently large, then this\nimplosion produces an enormous heating, which stops only after quark-gluon\nplasma of a temperature about 100 MeV (or even higher) is formed to withstand\nthe gravitational compression (whereas the highest temperatures of supernovae\nbursts are, at least, one order lower).

The framework\nis developed from a randomized initial condition that leads to a sample of\nsimulated SN Ia whose Ni56 masses have a similar average and range to those\nobserved, and have many other modestly realistic features such as the velocity\nextent of intermediate mass elements. The intended purpose is to enable\nstatistically well-defined studies of both physical and theoretical parameters\nof the SN Ia explosion simulation. We present here a thorough description of\nthe outcome of the SN Ia explosions produced by our current simulations. A\nfirst application of this framework is utilized to study the dependence of the\nSN Ia on the Ne22 content, which is known to be directly influenced by the\nprogenitor stellar population's metallicity. Our study is very specifically\ntailored to measure how the Ne22 content influences the competition between the\nrise of plumes of burned material and the expansion of the star before these\nplumes reach DDT conditions.

Abstract: I argue that the Doppler shift asymmetries observed in some young stellar\nobject (YSO) result from the interaction of the jets with the circumstellar\ngas, rather than from jets' rotation.

I will challenge any future\nobservation that will claim to detect jet rotation in YSOs that requires the\njets (and not a wind) to be launched from radii much larger than the accreting\nstellar radius.

We investigate the effects of temperature-dependent cooling\nfunctions on the disc's gravitational stability through controlled numerical\nexperiments using an SPH code. We find that such cooling functions raise the\nsusceptibility of discs to fragmentation through the influence of temperature\nperturbations - the average value of Omega*tcool has to increase to prevent\nlocal variability leading to collapse. We find the effects of temperature\ndependence to be most significant in the \"opacity gap\" associated with dust\nsublimation, where the average value of Omega*tcool at fragmentation is\nincreased by over an order of magnitude. We then use this result to predict\nwhere protoplanetary discs will fragment into bound objects, in terms of radius\nand accretion rate.

Following\nprevious works, we focus our investigations on a ``geometrical'' model, where\nthe matter evolution within the shock manifold is defined from a geometrical\nconstruction. This hypothesis is at variance with the assumption that the usual\ncontinuity equation holds but, in the inviscid limit, both models agree in the\nregular regions. Taking advantage of the formulation of the dynamics of this\n``geometrical model'' in terms of Legendre transforms and convex hulls, we\nstudy the evolution with time of the distribution of matter and the associated\npartitions of the Lagrangian and Eulerian spaces. We describe how the halo mass\ndistribution derives from a triangulation in Lagrangian space, while the dual\nVoronoi-like tessellation in Eulerian space gives the boundaries of empty\nregions with shock nodes at their vertices. We then emphasize that this\ndynamics actually leads to halo fragmentations for space dimensions greater or\nequal to 2 (for the inviscid limit studied in this article). This is most\neasily seen from the properties of the Lagrangian-space triangulation and we\nillustrate this process in the two-dimensional (2D) case. In particular, we\nexplain how point-like halos only merge through three-body collisions while\ntwo-body collisions always give rise to two new massive shock nodes (in 2D).\nThis generalizes to higher dimensions and we briefly illustrate the\nthree-dimensional (3D) case. This leads to a specific picture for the\ncontinuous formation of massive halos through successive halo fragmentations\nand mergings. \n\n"}

The\nclusters are formed following a cluster initial mass function (CMF) similar to\nthe stellar initial mass function (IMF). Both the IMF and the CMF favour\nlow-mass objects. The numerous low-mass clusters will lack high mass stars. If\nthe integrated galactic initial mass function originates from stars formed in\nclusters, the IGIMF could be steeper than the IMF. We investigate how well\nconstrained this steepening is and how it depends on the choice of sampling\nmethod and CMF. We compare analytic sampling to several implementations of\nrandom sampling of the IMF, and different CMFs. We implement different IGIMFs\ninto GALEV to obtain colours and metallicities for galaxies. Choosing different\nways of sampling the IMF results in different IGIMFs. Depending on the lower\ncluster mass limit and the slope of the cluster mass function, the steepening\nvaries between very strong and negligible. We find the size of the effect is\ncontinuous as a function of the power-law slope of the CMF, if the CMF extends\nto masses smaller than the maximum stellarmass. The number of O-stars detected\nby GAIA might help in judging on the importance of the IGIMF effect.

The Fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particle\ndark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pair\nannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Local Group dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the cold\ndark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches for\ndark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matter\ndominated environments. No significant gamma-ray emission was detected above\n100 MeV from the candidate dwarf galaxies.

We study the evolution of massive\nprotostars at such high rates by numerically solving the stellar structure\nequations. In this paper we examine the evolution via disk accretion. We\nconsider a limiting case of \"cold\" disk accretion, whereby most of the stellar\nphotosphere can radiate freely with negligible backwarming from the accretion\nflow, and the accreting material settles onto the star with the same specific\nentropy as the photosphere. We compare our results to the calculated evolution\nvia spherically symmetric accretion, the opposite limit, whereby the material\naccreting onto the star contains the entropy produced in the accretion shock\nfront. We examine how different accretion geometries affect the evolution of\nmassive protostars. For cold disk accretion at 10^-3 M_sun/yr the radius of a\nprotostar is initially small, about a few R_sun. After several solar masses\nhave accreted, the protostar begins to bloat up and for M \\simeq 10 M_sun the\nstellar radius attains its maximum of 30 - 400 R_sun. The large radius about\n100 R_sun is also a feature of spherically symmetric accretion at the same\naccreted mass and accretion rate. Hence, expansion to a large radius is a\nrobust feature of accreting massive protostars. At later times the protostar\neventually begins to contract and reaches the Zero-Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) for\nM \\simeq 30 M_sun, independent of the accretion geometry.

These are compared\nwith similar estimates for more luminous Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nquasars to investigate the relationship between black hole mass and quasar\nluminosity. We find a strong correlation between MgII FWHM and UV luminosity\nand that most quasars at this early epoch are accreting close to the Eddington\nlimit. Thus these quasars appear to be in an early stage of their life cycle\nwhere they are building up their black hole mass exponentially. Combining these\nresults with the quasar luminosity function, we derive the black hole mass\nfunction at z=6. Our black hole mass function is ~10^4 times lower than at z=0\nand substantially below estimates from previous studies. The main uncertainties\nwhich could increase the black hole mass function are a larger population of\nobscured quasars at high-redshift than is observed at low-redshift and/or a low\nquasar duty cycle at z=6.

We see that at the level of dark matter, the concentration of haloes\naffects moderately the dark matter correlation function only at small scales.\nHowever the galaxy correlation function is extremely sensitive to the HOD\ndetails, even when only the HOD of a small fraction of haloes is modified. \n\n"}

The former case is suggested\nby its association with a decaying non-thermal radio source, while the latter\nis suggested by its peculiar transient light curve and its low initial\nexpansion velocities. The crucial difference is that the star survives a\ntransient eruption but not an SN. All stars identified as possible survivors\nare significantly fainter, L_opt ~ 10^5 Lsun, than the L_opt ~ 3 10^6 Lsun\nprogenitor star at optical wavelengths. While this can be explained by dust\nabsorption in a shell of material ejected during the transient, the survivor\nmust then be present as a L_IR ~ 3 10^6 Lsun mid-infrared source. Using\narchival Spitzer observations of the region, we show that such a luminous\nmid-IR source is not present. The brightest source of dust emission is only\nL_IR ~ 10^5 Lsun and does not correspond to the previously identified\ncandidates for the surviving star. The dust cannot be made sufficiently distant\nand cold to avoid detection unless the ejection energy, mass and velocity\nscales are those of a SN or greater. We conclude that SN 1961V was a peculiar,\nbut real, supernova. Its peculiarities are probably due to enhanced mass loss\njust prior to the SN, followed by the interactions of the SN blast wave with\nthis ejecta. This adds to the evidence that there is a population of SN\nprogenitors that have major mass loss episodes shortly before core collapse.\nThe progenitor is a low metallicity, ~1/3 solar, high mass, M_ZAMS > 80 Msun,\nstar, which means either that BH formation can be accompanied by an SN or that\nsurprisingly high mass stars can form a NS. \n\n"}

Although\npost-main-sequence mass transfer explains the masses and tight orbit, it leaves\nunexplained the observed X-Ray luminosity, star's underluminosity, black hole's\nspin, and eccentricity. A common envelope phase, or rotational mixing, could\nexplain the orbit, but the former would lead to a merger and the latter to an\noverluminous companion. A merger would also ensue if mass transfer to the black\nhole were invoked for its spin-up. Here we report that, if M33 X-7 started as a\nprimary of 85-99 Msun and a secondary of 28-32 Msun, in a 2.8-3.1 day orbit,\nits observed properties can be consistently explained.

For\nmagnetars, as core densities exceed a threshold, the strong interaction induces\na phase transition to a neutral pion condensate that aligns all magnetic\nmoments. The core magnetic field is initially shielded by the ambient high\nconductivity plasma. With time the shielding currents dissipate transporting\nthe core field out, first to the crust and then breaking through the crust to\nthe surface of the star. Recent observations provide strong support for this\nmodel which accounts for several properties of magnetars and also enables us to\nidentify new magnetars. \n\n"}

Analysis of the toroidal field component Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are believed to be old pulsars spun up by a surrounding\naccretion disc. Magnetic fields are thought to play a leading role in this,\nboth by determining the location of the inner edge of the disc and by exerting\nan additional torque on the star (as a result of the interaction between the\nstellar magnetic field and the disc plasma motion, which creates a toroidal\ncomponent B_phi). In some well-known analytic models, developed in the 1980s,\nthe B_phi profile was taken to be proportional to the relative angular velocity\nbetween the disc plasma and the neutron star, multiplied by a vertical dipolar\nfield. The present work stands in the line of improving those models,\nsuggesting a new profile for B. In a previous paper, we discussed the poloidal\ncomponent of the magnetic field and here we consider the toroidal component,\nagain making the kinematic approximation and looking for steady solutions of\nthe induction equation for axisymmetric models.

The crossing of a few 10^6 Msun halos\nand the gas accretion through larger scale filaments generate a turbulent\nenvironment within this region. Due to the short cooling time caused by the\nnon-equilibrium formation of H2, the supersonic turbulence results in a very\nfragmented mass distribution, where dense, gravitationally unstable clumps\nemerge from a complex network of dense filaments. At z=10.87, we find\napproximately 25 well defined, gravitationally unstable clumps, with masses of\n4 x 10^3-9 x 10^5 Msun, temperatures of approximately 300K, and cooling times\nmuch shorter than the free-fall time.

The high photometric\nprecision has resulted in the discovery of two new RR1 stars and thirteen SX\nPhe stars. A detailed identification chart is given for all the variable stars\nin the field of our images of the cluster. Periodicities were calculated for\nall RR Lyraes and SX Phe stars and a critical comparison is made with previous\ndeterminations.\n  Out of four probable SX Phe variables reported by Dekany & Kovacs (2009), the\nSX Phe nature is confirmed only for V80, V81 is an unlikely case while V82 and\nV83 remain as dubious cases.

The distance to the source,\nits transient nature, and high internal column density serve to complicate\nseveral means of estimating the mass of the black hole. Utilizing newly-refined\nrelationships between black hole mass, radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity,\nand de-beaming the source flux, a weak constraint on the black hole mass is\nobtained: log(M/Msun) = 5.5 +/- 1.1 (1 sigma confidence). The confidence\ninterval is determined from the current intrinsic scatter in the relation,\nwhich includes effects from X-ray variability and accretion modes. This mass\nrange is broad, but it includes low values that are consistent with some\nvariability arguments, and it safely excludes high mass values where it becomes\nimpossible for black holes to disrupt stars. Future refinements in\nrelationships between black hole mass, radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity\nwill be able to reduce the uncertainty in related mass estimates by a factor of\ntwo, making this technique comparable to estimates based on the M-sigma\nrelationship. Possible difficulties in placing such events on the fundamental\nplane, a potential future test of their suitability, and uncertainties in mass\nstemming from variable X-ray emission are discussed. As near and longer-term\nsurvey efforts such as Pan-STARRS, LSST, LOFAR, the Square Kilometer Array, and\neROSITA begin to detect many tidal disruption events, black hole mass estimates\nfrom combined X-ray and radio observations may prove to be very pragmatic. \n\n"}

UCD and extended star cluster candidates are\nidentified through the analysis of their structural parameters, colors, spatial\ndistribution, and luminosity using deep Hubble Space Telescope observations in\ntwo filters: the F475W (Sloan g) and F850LP (Sloan z). The median effective\nradius of these UCDs is r_h=13.0 pc. Two types of UCDs are identified in the\nvicinity of NGC 1132, one type shares the same color and luminosity of the\nbrightest globular clusters and traces the onset of the mass-size relation. The\nsecond kind of UCD is represented by the brightest UCD candidate, a M32-type\nobject, with an effective radius of r_h=77.1 pc, located at ~6.6 kpc from the\nnucleus of NGC 1132. This UCD candidate is likely the remaining nucleus of a\nminor merger with the host galaxy.

Three main basic ingredients enter the\nproblem influencing the total dust budget and the mixture of the dust grains:\nthe types and amounts of dust injected by AGB stars and SNae and the\naccretion/destruction processes of dust in the ISM. They govern the relative\nabundances of the gas and dust in the ISM. In this study, we focus on star-dust\nand present a database of condensation efficiencies for the refractory elements\nC, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca and Fe in AGB stars and SNae that can be easily applied to\nthe gaseous ejecta, in order to determine the amount and kind of refractory\nelements locally embedded into dust and injected into the ISM. The best\ntheoretical recipes available nowadays in literature to estimate the amount of\ndust produced by SNae and AGB stars have been discussed and for SNae compared\nto the observations to get clues on the problem. The condensation efficiencies\nhave been analyzed in the context of a classical chemical model of dust\nformation and evolution in the Solar Neighbourhood and Galactic Disk. Tables of\ncoefficients are presented for (i) AGB stars at varying the metallicity and\n(ii) SNae at varying the density n_H of the ISM where the SNa explosions took\nplace.

Joint observations provide sufficient data to look into the behavior\nof IGR J17473--2721 at the rising part of the outburst. We find that the joint\nenergy spectra can be well fitted with a model composed of a blackbody and a\ncutoff power-law, with a cutoff energy decreasing from $ \\sim$ 150 keV to\n$\\sim$ 40 keV as the source leaves the quiescent state toward the low hard\nstate. This fits into a scenario in which the corona is cooled by the soft\nX-rays along the outburst evolution, as observed in several other atoll\nsources. By using the flux measured in the 1.5--30 keV band of the type-I\nbursts during the outburst, we find that the linear relationship between the\nburst duration and the flux still holds for those bursts that occur at the\ndecaying part of the low hard state, but with a different slope than the\noverall one that was estimated with the bursts happening in the whole extent\nof, and for the rest of the low hard state.

This dichotomy may be understood in a scenario where part of\nthe accreting material forms a corona on the way of falling onto the surface of\nthe neutron star during the decaying part of the low hard state. Based on the\naccretion rates of the preceding LHS, estimated from type-I X-ray bursts and\nfrom persistent emission, at least for IGR J17473-2721, most of the accretion\nmaterial may fall on the neutron star (NS) surface in the LHS.

{"id": "1109.3699", "contents": "Title: The Dependence of the Galactic Star Formation Laws on Metallicity Abstract: We describe results from semi-analytical modelling of star formation in\nprotocluster clumps of different metallicities. In this model, gravitationally\nbound cores form uniformly in the clump following a prescribed core formation\nefficiency per unit time. After a contraction timescale which is equal to a few\ntimes their free-fall times, the cores collapse into stars and populate the\nIMF. Feedback from the newly formed OB stars is taken into account in the form\nof stellar winds. When the ratio of the effective energy of the winds to the\ngravitational energy of the system reaches unity, gas is removed from the clump\nand core and star formation are quenched. The power of the radiation driven\nwinds has a strong dependence on metallicity and it increases with increasing\nmetallicity. Thus, winds from stars in the high metallicity models lead to a\nrapid evacuation of the gas from the protocluster clump and to a reduced star\nformation efficiency, as compared to their low metallicity counterparts. We\nderive the metallicity dependent star formation efficiency per unit time in\nthis model as a function of the gas surface density Sigma_g. This is combined\nwith the molecular gas fraction in order to derive the dependence of the\nsurface density of star formation Sigma_SFR on Sigma_g.

Furthermore, the results show a dependence of Sigma_SFR on metallicity\nover the entire range of gas surface densities, and can also explain part of\nthe scatter in the observations. \n\n"}

{"id": "1110.1452", "contents": "Title: Excitation of Unidentified Infrared Bands by H atom impact Abstract: A model was developed for the excitation of the UIBs by H atom impacts in the\nInterstellar Medium. It builds upon the fact that, in the presence of far UV\nradiation and hydrocarbon grains, the hydrogen gas will be partially\ndissociated and the grain surface will be partially hydrogenated and partially\ncovered with free carbon bonds. Under such a statistical equilibrium, H atoms\nfrom the gas will recombine with C atoms at the grain surface at some rate. At\neach recombination, the H atom deposits an energy of about 5 eV in the grain.\nHalf of this is directly converted into vibrational excitation, always\ndistributed in the same way among the most tightly coupled vibration modes of\nthe grain. Absent frequent grain-grain collisions, the only outlet for this\nenergy is IR reemission, part of it in the UIBs, provided the chemical\nstructure of the grains is adequate, and the other part in the continuum. The\npartition only depends upon the grain size, all grains being assumed to have\nthe same constitution. Only a fraction, about 0.25, of the grains (among the\nsmallest ones) will contribute significantly to the UIBs.\n  It is shown quantitatively that H impacts are generally more efficient\nexcitation agents than UV absorption because of the overwhelming abundance of\nhydrogen relative to UV photons. Only very close to young bright stars is this\nno longer true because photon flux then largely exceeds H atom flux. Thus H\nimpacts and FUV absorption are both necessary to understand the variety of\nobserved UIB spectra.\n  The model translates into a small number of equations enabling a quantitative\ncomparison of its predictions with available astronomical observations, which\nhave become exquisitely rich and accurate in the last two decades. \n\n"}

The torque equations are integrated\nnumerically with a small step in time, includng the oscillating triaxial torque\ncomponents but neglecting the layered structure of the planet and assuming a\nzero obliquity. We find that a Mercury-like planet with its current value of\norbital eccentricity (0.2056) is always captured in the 3:2 resonance. The\nprobability of capture in the higher 2:1 resonance is approximately 0.23. These\nresults are confirmed by a semi-analytical estimation of capture probabilities\nas functions of eccentricity for both prograde and retrograde evolution of spin\nrate.

Next, we explore the IPHAS and 2MASS\ncatalogues for possible counterparts of the eruption. Our analysis shows that\nthe VLTP scenario outperforms all other proposed scenarios as an explanation of\nNSV 11749. We identify an IPHAS/2MASS source at the eruption location of NSV\n11749. The derived colors suggest that the object is not enshrouded in a thick\ndust shell as V605 Aql and V4334 Sgr.

When considering a single Sweet-Parker topology, the particles\naccelerate predominantly through a first-order Fermi process, as predicted in\nprevious work (de Gouveia Dal Pino & Lazarian, 2005) and demonstrated\nnumerically in Kowal, de Gouveia Dal Pino & Lazarian (2011). When turbulence is\nincluded within the current sheet, the acceleration rate, which depends on the\nreconnection rate, is highly enhanced. This is because reconnection in the\npresence of turbulence becomes fast and independent of resistivity (Lazarian &\nVishniac, 1999; Kowal et al., 2009) and allows the formation of a thick volume\nfilled with multiple simultaneously reconnecting magnetic fluxes.

This phase of\nthe energy dissipation process is thus global and lasts far longer than the\ninitial purely local phase. In the process a significant fraction of the energy\n(25%-60%) remains as undissipated fast magnetosonic waves propagating away from\nthe reconnection site, primarily upward. This flare-generated wave is initiated\nby unbalanced Lorentz forces in the reconnection-disrupted current sheet,\nrather than by dissipation-generated pressure, as some previous models have\nassumed. Depending on the orientation of the initial current sheet the wave\nfront is either a rarefaction, with backward directed flow, or a compression,\nwith forward directed flow. \n\n"}

The jet diverges with a\nsemi-opening angle of about $9^\\circ$, and is nearly constant in integrated\nbrightness over its length. A faint feature north-east of the core does not\nappear to be a true counter-jet, but rather an extended lobe of this FR-II\nradio source seen in projection. The absence of a counter-jet is sufficient to\nplace modest constraints on the speed of the jet on these scales, requiring\n$\\beta \\ga 0.5$.

But if disks are\nturbulent, this neglects a spectrum of stochastic density fluctuations that can\nproduce rare, high-density mass concentrations. Here, we use a\nrecently-developed analytic framework to predict the statistics of these\nfluctuations, i.e. the rate of fragmentation and mass spectrum of fragments\nformed in a turbulent Keplerian disk. Turbulent disks are never completely\nstable: we calculate the (always finite) probability of forming\nself-gravitating structures via stochastic turbulent density fluctuations in\nsuch disks. Modest sub-sonic turbulence above Mach number ~0.1 can produce a\nfew stochastic fragmentation or 'direct collapse' events over ~Myr timescales,\neven if Q>>1 and cooling is slow (t_cool>>t_orbit). In trans-sonic turbulence\nthis extends to Q~100. We derive the true Q-criterion needed to suppress such\nevents, which scales exponentially with Mach number. We specify to turbulence\ndriven by MRI, convection, or spiral waves, and derive equivalent criteria in\nterms of Q and the cooling time. Cooling times >~50*t_dyn may be required to\ncompletely suppress fragmentation. These gravoturbulent events produce mass\nspectra peaked near ~M_disk*(Q*M_disk/M_star)^2 (rocky-to-giant planet masses,\nincreasing with distance from the star). We apply this to protoplanetary disk\nmodels and show that even minimum mass solar nebulae could experience\nstochastic collapse events, provided a source of turbulence. \n\n"}

The light curve\npeaked at z_P1=21.7 mag, making PS1-10afx comparable to the most luminous known\nSNe, with M_u = -22.3 mag. Our extensive optical and NIR observations indicate\nthat the bolometric light curve of PS1-10afx rose on the unusually fast\ntimescale of ~12 d to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1e44 erg/s (M_bol\n= -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. Equally important, the SED is\nunusually red for a SLSN, with a color temperature of 6800 K near maximum\nlight, in contrast to previous H-poor SLSNe, which are bright in the UV. The\nspectra more closely resemble those of a normal SN Ic than any known SLSN, with\na photospheric velocity of 11,000 km/s and evidence for line blanketing in the\nrest-frame UV. Despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very large\nemitting radius (>5e15 cm). We demonstrate that no existing theoretical model\ncan satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (i) a nickel-powered\nlight curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fast\ntimescale; (ii) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly-rotating\nmagnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (iii) models\ninvoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain the\nobserved spectra or color evolution.

However, there are uncertainties from the ambiguity of colour\nand magnitude and the effects of interstellar reddening.\n  Aims: In this paper we present a detailed reddening map of the central 30\nDoradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud; for community use and to test the\nmethods used. The reddening, a measurement of dust extinction, acts as a tracer\nof the interstellar medium (ISM).\n  Methods: Near infrared photometry of red clump stars are used to measure\nreddening as extinction is the main cause of their colour and magnitude\nvariance. The star formation history is used to convert colour to reddening\nvalues which are subsequently converted to visual extinction.\n  Results: Presented is a dust map for the 30 Doradus field. This map samples a\nregion of 1x1.5 deg, containing ~1.5x10^5 red clump stars which probe reddening\nup to AV=6 mag. We compare our map with maps from the literature, including\noptical extinction maps and radio, mid- and far-infrared maps of atomic\nhydrogen and dust emission. Through estimation of column density we locate\nmolecular clouds.\n  Conclusions: This new reddening map shows correlation with equivalent maps in\nthe literature, validating the method of red clump star selection. We make our\nreddening map available for community use. In terms of ISM the red clump stars\nappear to be more affected by the cooler dust measured by 70 micron emission\nbecause there is stronger correlation between increasing emission and\nextinction due to red clump stars not being located near hot stars that would\nheat the dust.

Adopting a realistic gas\ntemperature and metallicity, we derive that in the (0.05-0.15)r_200 region\n(where r_200 is the virial radius) the bolometric X-ray luminosity of the hot\ngas is (4.3 +/- 0.8) x 10^40 erg/s and the gas mass is (9.1 +/- 0.9) x 10^9\nM_sun.

They form in dense cores of molecular clouds that are observed to be\nsignificantly magnetized. Our previous study shows that magnetic braking can\ntighten the binary separation during the protostellar mass accretion phase by\nremoving the angular momentum of the accreting material. Recent numerical\ncalculations of single star formation have shown that misalignment between the\nmagnetic field and rotation axis may weaken both magnetic braking and the\nassociated magnetically driven outflows. These two effects allow for disk\nformation even in strongly magnetized cores. Here we investigate the effects of\nmagnetic field misalignment on the properties of protobinaries. Somewhat\nsurprisingly, the misaligned magnetic field is more efficient at tightening the\nbinary orbit compared to the aligned field. The main reason is that the\nmisalignment weakens the magnetically-driven outflow, which allows more\nmaterial to accrete onto the binary. Even though the specific angular momentum\nof this inner material is higher than in the aligned case, it is insufficient\nto compensate for the additional mass. A corollary of this result is that a\nweaker field is required to achieve the same degree of inward migration when\nthe field is tilted relative to the rotation axis. Large field misalignment\nalso helps to produce rotationally-supported circumbinary disks even for\nrelatively strong magnetic fields, by weakening the magnetically-dominated\nstructure close to the binary. Our result may provide an explanation for the\ncircumbinary disks detected in recent SMA and ALMA observations. \n\n"}

The only previously known sdO pulsator is\nsignificantly hotter at 68,500 K and log g = 6.1. All of the sdO pulsators\nidentified so far are fainter than 17.4 in the V band and, thus, are poor\ncandidates for an in-depth follow-up with asteroseismology. We therefore\nobtained high S/N light curves and spectroscopy for a number of field sdO stars\nto attempt to discover bright counterparts to these stars, particularly the\nOmega Cen pulsators. Our primary sample consisted of 19 sdO stars with\nhydrogen-rich atmospheres, log N(He)/N(H) < -1.0, effective temperatures in the\nrange 40,000 K < Teff < 67,000 K, and surface gravities 5.3 < log g < 6.1.

With the advent of future galaxy redshift surveys aiming at precisely\nmeasuring the RSD, an accurate modeling of RSD going beyond linear theory is a\ncritical issue in order to detect or disprove small deviations from general\nrelativity (GR).

Two sources are confirmed to be\neclipsing: CX207 and CX794. CX207 shows a broad asymmetric Halpha profile\nblue-shifted by >300 km/s. Such line profile characteristics are consistent\nwith a magnetic (Polar) CV. CX794 is an eclipsing nova-like CV in the period\ngap. Time-resolved photometry and the large broadening of the Halpha emission\nlines in CX446 (2100 km/s FWHM) suggest that this is also an eclipsing or\nhigh-inclination accreting binary.

In this work, first the definition\nof Be stars is contrasted to similar classes, and common observables obtained\nfor Be stars are introduced and the respective formation mechanisms explained.\nWe then review the current state of knowledge concerning the central stars as\nnon-radially pulsating objects and non-magnetic stars, as far as it concerns\nlarge scale, i.e., mostly dipolar, global fields. Localized, weak magnetic\nfields remain possible, but are as of yet unproven. The Be phenomenon, linked\nwith one or more mass ejection processes, acts on top of a rotation rate of\nabout 75% of critical or above. The properties of the process can be well\nconstrained, leaving only few options, most importantly, but not exclusively,\nnon-radial pulsation and small scale magnetic fields. Of these, it is well\npossible that all are realized: In different stars, different processes may be\nacting.

These corrections cannot be obtained by Newtonian\nnumerical simulations, so it is important to accurately estimate the magnitude\nof these relativistic effects. Density fluctuations couple to produce a\nbackground of gravitational waves, which is larger than any primordial\nbackground. A similar interaction produces a much larger spectrum of vector\nmodes which represent the frame-dragging rotation of spacetime. These can\nchange the metric at the percent level in the concordance model at scales below\nthe equality scale. Vector modes modify the lensing of background galaxies by\nlarge-scale structure. This gives in principle the exciting possibility of\nmeasuring relativistic frame dragging effects on cosmological scales. The\neffects of the non-linear tensor and vector modes on the cosmic convergence are\ncomputed and compared to first-order lensing contributions from density\nfluctuations, Doppler lensing, and smaller Sachs-Wolfe effects. The lensing\nfrom gravitational waves is negligible so we concentrate on the vector modes.\nWe show the relative importance of this for future surveys such as Euclid and\nSKA.

In the $n$-dimensional\nsetting, however, it requires the inversion of an $n \\times n$ covariance\nmatrix, $C$, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, $\\det(C)$. In many\ncases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of\nthe form $C = \\sigma^2 I + K$, where $K$ is computed using a specified\ncovariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters\n(hyperparameters). The matrix $C$ is typically dense, causing standard direct\nmethods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require $\\mathcal O(n^3)$\nwork. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling.

The photon power-law index\nGamma_{2} is almost constant (Gamma_{2}~2) for all spectral states.

Observationally, there is a\nsufficient evidence that the emerging radiation is polarized parallel or\nperpendicular to the magnetic field line planes that should be associated with\nthe ordinary O and extraordinary X plasma modes respectively, excited by some\nradiative process.

This process has been studied numerically and\nanalytically in the context of Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion (HLA). Yet, within a\nCE, accretion structures may span a large fraction of the envelope radius, and\nin so doing sweep across a substantial radial gradient of density. We quantify\nthese gradients using detailed stellar evolution models for a range of CE\nencounters. We provide estimates of typical scales in CE encounters that\ninvolve main sequence stars, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes with\ngiant-branch companions of a wide range of masses. We apply these typical\nscales to hydrodynamic simulations of 3D HLA with an upstream density gradient.\nThis density gradient breaks the symmetry that defines HLA flow, and imposes an\nangular momentum barrier to accretion. Material that is focused into the\nvicinity of the embedded object thus may not be able to accrete. As a result,\naccretion rates drop dramatically, by 1-2 orders of magnitude, while drag rates\nare only mildly affected. We provide fitting formulae to the\nnumerically-derived rates of drag and accretion as a function of the density\ngradient. The reduced ratio of accretion to drag suggests that objects that can\nefficiently gain mass during CE evolution, such as black holes and neutron\nstars, may grow less than implied by the HLA formalism. \n\n"}

One of the criteria we used for the identification was the\npresence of an Ha emission line. The spectra of several sources revealed an Ha\nemission line only after careful subtraction of the F or G stellar spectral\nabsorption lines. In a sub-class of three of these sources the residual Halpha\nemission line is broad (> 400 km/s) which suggests that it is formed in an\naccretion disk, whereas in other cases the line width is such that we currently\ncannot determine whether the line emission is formed in an active star/binary\nor in an accretion disk.

It is caused by a spiral deformation, the pattern of which rotates\nslower with respect to the double-core structure in center of the remnant. This\nsecondary peak is typically well separated in frequency from the secondary peak\nproduced by a nonlinear interaction between a quadrupole and a quasi-radial\noscillation. The new mechanism allows for an explanation of low-frequency\nmodulations seen in a number of physical characteristics of the remnant, such\nas the central lapse function, the maximum density and the separation between\nthe two cores.

In this case the collisions\nbetween pulsars and SNs is inevitable, and these collisions would lead to\nglitches when enough elastic energy has been accumulated during the spin-down\nprocess. The SNs-triggered glitches could release less energy, because the\naccumulated elastic energy would be less than that in the scenario of glitches\nwithout SNs.

Because the ISM is turbulent, a given\npatch of ISM exhibits sub-patches with a range of surface densities. The\nhigh-density patches are 'pushed' by feedback, thereby driving turbulence and\nself-regulating local star formation. Sufficiently low-density patches,\nhowever, are accelerated to above the escape velocity before the region can\nself-adjust and are thus vented as outflows. In the\nturbulent-pressure-supported regime, when the gas fraction is $\\gtrsim 0.3$,\nthe ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion to the circular velocity is\nsufficiently high that at any given time, of order half of the ISM has surface\ndensity less than the critical value and thus can be blown out on a dynamical\ntime.

At low gas fractions, the star formation rate needed for\nlocal self-regulation, and corresponding turbulent Mach number, decline\nrapidly; the ISM is 'smoother', and it is actually more difficult to drive\nwinds with large mass-loading factors.

This dissertation examines the role of stellar radiation in\ndriving (ablating) material away from these circumstellar disks.\n  A key result is that the observed month to year decay of Classical Be disks\ncan be explained by line-driven ablation without, as previously done, appealing\nto anomalously strong viscous diffusion. Moreover, the higher luminosity of O\nstars leads to ablation of optically thin disks on dynamical timescales of\norder a day, providing a natural explanation for the lack of observed Oe stars.\nIn addition to the destruction of Be disks, this dissertation also introduces a\nmodel for their formation by coupling observationally inferred non-radial\npulsation modes and rapid stellar rotation to launch material into orbiting\nKeplerian disks.\n  In contrast to such Be decretion disks, star-forming accretion disks are much\ndenser and so are generally optically thick to continuum processes. To\ncircumvent the computational challenges associated with radiation hydrodynamics\nthrough optically thick media, we develop an approximate method for treating\ncontinuum absorption in the limit of geometrically thin disks.

While NGC 6397 is often considered a core\ncollapse cluster, our analysis suggests a flattening of the surface brightness\nprofile at the smallest radii.

The reason for this dichotomy of wind-fed HMXBs is still a matter\nof debate. Among the several explanations that have been proposed, some of them\ninvoke specific stellar wind properties of the donor stars. Only dedicated\nempiric analysis of the donors' stellar wind can provide the required\ninformation to accomplish an adequate test of these theories. However, such\nanalyses are scarce. To close this gap, we perform a comparative analysis of\nthe optical companion in two important systems: IGR J17544-2619 (SFXT) and Vela\nX-1 (SGXB). We analyse the spectra of each star in detail and derive their\nstellar and wind properties.

An important difference between the\nstellar winds of the two stars is their terminal velocities v_inf=1500km/s in\nIGR J17544-2619 and v_inf=700km/s in Vela~X-1, which has important consequences\non the X-ray luminosity of these sources.

An alternative explanation, first suggested by Williams & Berger\n(2016b), is that the identified counterpart may instead be a compact AGN. The\nputative counterpart's variation may then instead be extrinsic, caused by\nrefractive scintillation in the ionized interstellar medium of the Milky Way,\nwhich would invalidate the association with FRB150418.

Transiting planets currently represent the most informative data\nset on the ensemble properties of exoplanets within 1 AU of their star.\nHowever, the transit method is inherently biased due to both geometric and\ndetection-driven effects. In this work, we derive the overall observational\nbiases affecting the most basic transit parameters from first principles. By\nassuming a trapezoidal transit and using conditional probability, we infer the\nexpected distribution of these terms both as a joint distribution and in a\nmarginalized form. These general analytic results provide a baseline against\nwhich to compare trends predicted by mission-tailored injection/recovery\nsimulations and offer a simple way to correct for observational bias. Our\nresults explain why the observed population of transiting planets displays a\nnon-uniform impact parameter distribution, with a bias towards near-equatorial\ngeometries.

We calculate the coronal properties required to produce the observed radio\nemission in RQ AGN, either from synchrotron emission of power-law (PL)\nelectrons, or from cyclo-synchrotron emission of hot mildly-relativistic\nthermal electrons. We find that a flat spectrum, as observed in about half of\nRQ AGN, can be produced by corona with a disc or a spherical configuration,\nwhich extends from the innermost regions out to a pc scale. A spectral break to\nan optically thin power-law emission is expected around 300-1000 GHz, as the\ninnermost corona becomes optically thin. In case of thermal electrons, a sharp\nspectral cutoff is expected above the break. The position of the break can be\nmeasured with VLBI observations, which exclude the cold dust emission, and it\ncan be used to probe the properties of the innermost corona.

Attempts over the last two decades to\ncalibrate the degree of overshooting with stellar mass using detached\ndouble-lined eclipsing binaries have been largely inconclusive, mainly due to a\nlack of suitable observational data. Here we revisit the question of a possible\nmass dependence of overshooting with a more complete sample of binaries, and\nexamine any additional relation there might be with evolutionary state or metal\nabundance Z. We use a carefully selected sample of 33 double-lined eclipsing\nbinaries strategically positioned in the H-R diagram, with accurate absolute\ndimensions and component masses ranging from 1.2 to 4.4 solar masses.

For this reason, large-eddy simulations (LES),\nwhich only simulate large and intermediate scales directly, are employed.

This hybrid model is constructed by allowing\nthe surface flux transport (SFT) simulation described in Lemerle et al. 2015 to\nprovide the poloidal source term to an axisymmetric FTD simulation defined in a\nmeridional plane, which in turn generates the BMRs required by the SFT. A key\naspect of this coupling is the definition of an emergence function describing\nthe probability of BMR emergence as a function of the spatial distribution of\nthe internal axisymmetric magnetic field. We use a genetic algorithm to\ncalibrate this function, together with other model parameters, against observed\ncycle 21 emergence data. We present a reference dynamo solution reproducing\nmany solar cycle characteristics, including good hemispheric coupling, phase\nrelationship between the surface dipole and the BMR-generating internal field,\nand correlation between dipole strength at cycle maximum and peak amplitude of\nthe next cycle. The saturation of the cycle amplitude takes place through the\nquenching of the BMR tilt as a function of the internal field.

For the majority of stars with an observed period spacing pattern we\nsuccessfully determined the rotation rates and the asymptotic period spacing\nvalues, though the uncertainty margins on the latter were typically large.

Metallicity Gradients\n  from Red Clump Stars Abstract: We investigate the Milky Way Galaxy's radial and vertical metallicity\ngradients using a sample of 47,406 red clump stars from the RAVE DR4. This\nsample is more than twice the size of the largest sample in the literature\ninvestigating radial and vertical metallicity gradients. The absolute magnitude\nof Groenewegen (2008) is used to determine distances to our sample stars. The\nresulting distances agree with the RAVE DR4 distances Binney et al. (2014) of\nthe same stars. Our photometric method also provides distances to 6185 stars\nthat are not assigned a distance in RAVE DR4. The metallicity gradients are\ncalculated with their current orbital positions ($R_{gc}$ and $Z$) and with\ntheir orbital properties (mean Galactocentric distance, $R_{m}$ and $z_{max}$),\nas a function of the distance to the Galactic plane:\nd[Fe/H]/d$R_{gc}=$-$0.047\\pm0.003$ dex/kpc for $0\\leq |Z|\\leq0.5$ kpc and\nd[Fe/H]/d$R_m=$-$0.025\\pm0.002$ dex/kpc for $0\\leq z_{max}\\leq0.5$ kpc. This\nreaffirms the radial metallicity gradient in the thin disc but highlights that\ngradients are sensitive to the selection effects caused by the difference\nbetween $R_{gc}$ and $R_{m}$. The radial gradient is flat in the distance\ninterval 0.5-1 kpc from the plane and then becomes positive greater than 1 kpc\nfrom the plane. The radial metallicity gradients are also eccentricity\ndependent. We showed that d[Fe/H]/d$R_m=$-$0.089\\pm0.010$, -$0.073\\pm0.007$,\n-$0.053\\pm0.004$ and -$0.044\\pm0.002$ dex/kpc for $e_p\\leq0.05$, $e_p\\leq0.07$,\n$e_p\\leq0.10$ and $e_p\\leq0.20$ sub-samples, respectively, in the distance\ninterval $0\\leq z_{max}\\leq0.5$ kpc.

Leading candidates for their origin are\nblue supergiant collapsars, magnetars, and white dwarf tidal disruption events\n(WD-TDEs) caused by massive black holes (BHs). Recent observations of\nsupernova-like (SN-like) bumps associated with ulGRBs challenged both the\nWD-TDE and the blue supergiant models because of the detection of SNe and the\nabsence of hydrogen lines, respectively. We propose that WD-TDEs can\naccommodate the observed SN-like bumps if the fallback WD matter releases\nenergy into the unbound WD ejecta. The observed ejecta energy, luminosity, and\nvelocity are explained by the gravitational energy, Eddington luminosity, and\nescape velocity of the formed accretion disk, respectively. We also show that\nthe observed X-rays can ionize the ejecta, eliminating lines. The SN-like light\ncurves (SN 2011kl) for the ulGRB 111209A are consistent with all three models,\nalthough a magnetar model is unnatural because the spin-down time required to\npower the SN-like bump is a hundred times longer than the GRB.

We performed\nsimultaneous Hinode and IRIS observations of a sunspot umbra to derive the\nupward energy fluxes at two different atmospheric layers (photosphere and lower\ntransition region) and estimate the energy dissipation. The observations\nrevealed some properties of the observed periodic oscillations in physical\nquantities, such as their phase relations, temporal behaviors, and power\nspectra, making a conclusion that standing slow-mode waves are dominant at the\nphotosphere with their high-frequency leakage, which is observed as upward\nwaves at the chromosphere and the lower transition region. Our estimates of\nupward energy fluxes are $2.0\\times10^7$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at the\nphotospheric level and $8.3\\times10^4$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at the lower\ntransition region level.

The fundamental quantity\nto be computed is the cross-covariance of the seismic wavefield. We choose\nsources of wave excitation that enable us to relate the cross-covariance of the\noscillations to the Green's function in a straightforward manner. We illustrate\nthe method by considering the 3D acoustic wave equation in an axisymmetric\nreference solar model, ignoring the effects of gravity on the waves. The\nsymmetry of the background model around the rotation axis implies that the\nGreen's function can be written as a sum of longitudinal Fourier modes, leading\nto a set of independent 2D problems. We use a high-order finite-element method\nto solve the 2D wave equation in frequency space.

We aim to increase the number\nof YHGs in M33 and thus to contribute to a better understanding of the\npre-supernova evolution of massive stars.

We also analyzed BVI photometry\nfor 21 of the most luminous YSGs in M33 to identify changes in the spectral\ntype. To explore the properties of circumstellar dust, we performed SED-fitting\nof multi-band photometry of the 21 YSGs. We find three luminous YSGs in our\nsample to be YHG candidates, as they are surrounded by hot dust and are\nenshrouded within extended, cold dusty envelopes. Our spectroscopy of star 2\nshows emission of more than one H$\\alpha$ component, as well as emission of\nCaII, implying an extended atmospheric structure. In addition, the long-term\nmonitoring of the star reveals a dimming in the visual light curve of amplitude\nlarger than 0.5 mag that caused an apparent drop in the temperature that\nexceeded 500 K.

Detection of such substructures in combination with detailed modeling can\nhint at the presence of perturbing planetary bodies, or reveal other mechanisms\nacting to replenish gas and dust reservoirs and forming structures such as\nspirals or rings.

The first one is that\nSPH requires that the density is continuous and differentiable. The second one\nis that SPH does not have the consistency, and thus the accuracy is zeroth\norder in space. In addition, we cannot express accurate boundary conditions\nwith SPH. In this paper, we propose a novel, high-order scheme for\nparticle-based hydrodynamics of compress- ible fluid.

In contrast, the `solar wind laboratory' is directly measured in situ by\na fleet of spacecraft measuring the properties of the plasma and magnetic\nfields at specific points in space.

The discovered compact systems sometimes\ncontain multiple transiting planets, so that their orbital angular momentum\nvectors are tightly aligned. Since planetary orbits are susceptible to forced\noscillations of their inclination angles, the highly aligned nature of these\nsystems places constraints on possible additional (non-transiting) planets. If\nplanets in the outer regions of these solar systems have sufficiently large\nmass or sufficiently small semi-major axis, they will induce the compact inner\norbits to oscillate in and out of a transiting configuration. This paper\nconsiders the dynamics of the compact systems discovered to host five or more\nplanets. In order to not perturb these systems out of a continually, mutually\ntransiting state, additional planetary companions must generally have\nperiastron $p>10$ AU. Specific constraints are found for each of the 18\nplanetary systems considered, which are obtained by marginalising over other\norbital parameters using three different choices of priors for the companion\nproperties (a uniform prior, a transit-inspired prior, and an non-transiting\ndisk prior).

This is especially true for massive stars, which\nare important for the chemical enrichment of the universe. It is therefore\nimportant to constrain their physical parameters and internal angular momentum\ndistribution to calibrate stellar structure and evolution models. Stellar\ninternal rotation can be probed through asteroseismic studies of rotationally\nsplit oscillations but such results are still quite rare, especially for stars\nmore massive than the Sun. The SPB star HD201433 is known to be part of a\nsingle-lined spectroscopic triple system, with two low-mass companions orbiting\nwith periods of about 3.3 and 154 d. Our results are based on photometric\nobservations made by BRITE - Constellation and the SMEI on board the Coriolis\nsatellite, high-resolution spectroscopy, and more than 96 years of radial\nvelocity measurements. We identify a sequence of 9 rotationally split dipole\nmodes in the photometric time series and establish that HD201433 is in\nprinciple a solid-body rotator with a very slow rotation period of 297+/-76 d.\nTidal interaction with the inner companion has, however, significantly\naccelerated the spin of the surface layers by a factor of approximately one\nhundred. The angular momentum transfer onto the surface of HD201433 is also\nreflected by the statistically significant decrease of the orbital period of\nabout 0.9 s during the last 96 years. Combining the asteroseismic inferences\nwith the spectroscopic measurements and the orbital analysis of the inner\nbinary system, we conclude that tidal interactions between the central SPB star\nand its inner companion have almost circularised the orbit but not yet aligned\nall spins of the system and have just begun to synchronise rotation. \n\n"}

We show that scattering rates involving\ngauge fields can become larger than the expansion rate $H$, due to the very\nlarge occupation numbers, and create a thermal bath of particles of temperature\n$T$ during inflation. In the thermal regime, energy is transferred to smaller\nscales, radically modifying the predictions of this scenario. We thus argue\nthat previous constraints on $\\xi$ are alleviated.

We determined that the wind extended to at\nleast 2.57e14 cm and lasted for at least 30 days prior to the observations,\nreleasing 5e-5 Msun into the circumstellar medium. In analogy to 2009ip, we\npropose that this is the material that the explosive ejecta could interact at\nlate epochs, perhaps producing observable signatures that can be probed with\nfuture observations. We conclude that the progenitor of SN 2015bh was most\nlikely a warm luminous blue variable of at least 35 Msun before the explosion.\nConsidering the high wind velocity, we cannot exclude the possibility that the\nprogenitor was a Wolf-Rayet star that inflated just before the 2013 eruption,\nsimilar to HD5980 during its 1994 episode. If the star survived, late-time\nspectroscopy may reveal either a similar LBV or a Wolf-Rayet star, depending on\nthe mass of the H envelope before the explosion. If the star exploded as a\ngenuine SN, 2015bh would be a remarkable case of a successful explosion after\nblack-hole formation in a star with a possible minimum mass 35 Msun at the\npre-SN stage. \n\n"}

The K2\nMission is providing a unique opportunity to obtain high-precision photometric\ntime series for bright stars along the ecliptic. However, bright targets\nrequire a large number of pixels to capture the entirety of the stellar flux,\nand bandwidth restrictions limit the number and brightness of stars that can be\nobserved. To overcome this, we have developed a new photometric technique, that\nwe call halo photometry, to observe very bright stars using a limited number of\npixels. Halo photometry is simple, fast and does not require extensive pixel\nallocation, and will allow us to use K2 and other photometric missions, such as\nTESS, to observe very bright stars for asteroseismology and to search for\ntransiting exoplanets. We apply this method to the seven brightest stars in the\nPleiades open cluster.

The algorithm considers a class of parameterized\nMRDs and finds the set of parameters that best fits the observed sample. The\nalgorithm consists of four parts. First, we define a new observable, the\n`modified mass function', that can be calculated for each binary in the sample.\nWe show that the distribution of the modified mass function follows the shape\nof the underlying MRD, turning it more advantageous than the previously used\nmass function, reduced mass function or reduced mass function logarithm.\nSecond, we derive the likelihood of the sample of modified mass functions to be\nobserved given an assumed MRD.

The subsequent initial burst quickly\nsubsided with an exponential decay constant of 40-60 ms, followed by a\nprolonged line emission at about 0.511 megaelectronvolt (MeV), lasting for a\nminute. The observed decay timescale and spectral cutoff at about 10 MeV of the\ninitial emission are well explained with de-excitation gamma rays from the\nnuclei excited by neutron capture.

The observed variability of asymmetric,\ndouble-peaked emission line profiles in about half of such systems could be\ninterpreted as the signature of precession of an eccentric gaseous debris disk.\nThe variability timescales --- from decades down to $1.4$ yr (recently inferred\nfor the debris disk around HE 1349--2305) --- are in rough agreement with the\nrate of general relativistic (GR) precession in the test particle limit.\nHowever, it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can drive such a\nfast, coherent precession of a radially extended (out to $1 R_\\odot$) gaseous\ndisk mediated by internal stresses (pressure). Here we use the linear theory of\neccentricity evolution in hydrodynamic disks to determine several key\nproperties of eccentric modes in gaseous debris disks around WDs.

In both cases there is\nan optimal interval for the input signal level for which this input-error\ncorrelation is very weak and the model of additive uncorrelated quantization\nnoise provides a very accurate approximation. We determine the conditions under\nwhich the magnitude and phase of the measured correlation have negligible bias\nwith respect to the unquantized values: we demonstrate that the magnitude bias\nis negligible only if both unquantized inputs are optimally quantized (i.e.,\nwhen the uncorrelated quantization error model is valid), while the phase bias\nis negligible when 1) at least one of the inputs is optimally quantized, or\nwhen 2) the correlation coefficient between the unquantized inputs is small.\nFinally, we determine the implications of these results for radio\ninterferometry. \n\n"}

For each system in this sample, we measure dM/dt using archival\nChandra X-ray data and acquire the SFR and systematic uncertainty in the SFR by\ncombining over 330 estimates from dozens of literature sources.

For these systems, we measure a slope in the SFR-dM/dt relation\ngreater than unity, suggesting that the systems with the strongest cool cores\nare also cooling more efficiently. We propose that this may be related to, on\naverage, higher black hole accretion rates in the strongest cool cores, which\ncould influence the total amount (saturating near the Eddington rate) and\ndominant mode (mechanical vs radiative) of feedback. For systems with dM/dt <\n30 Msun/yr, we find that the SFR and dM/dt are uncorrelated, and show that this\nis consistent with star formation being fueled at a low (but dominant) level by\nrecycled ISM gas in these systems. We find an intrinsic log-normal scatter in\nSFR at fixed dM/dt of 0.52 +/- 0.06 dex, suggesting that cooling is tightly\nself-regulated over very long timescales, but can vary dramatically on short\ntimescales. There is weak evidence that this scatter may be related to the\nfeedback mechanism, with the scatter being minimized (~0.4 dex) in systems for\nwhich the mechanical feedback power is within a factor of two of the cooling\nluminosity. \n\n"}

However, the expected properties and distribution of such events is\nnot well understood. Here we characterize the rates of such events, their delay\ntime distribution, their progenitors and the distribution of their properties.\nWe use binary populations synthesis models and consider a wide range of initial\nconditions and physical processes.

We\nfind that the majority of NS-WD mergers are born in systems in which\nmass-transfer played an important role, and the WD formed before the NS. For\nthe majority of the mergers the WDs have a carbon-oxygen composition (60-80%)\nand most of the rest are with oxygen-neon WDs. The rates of NS-WD mergers are\nin the range of 3-15% of the type Ia supernovae (SNe) rate. Their delay time\ndistribution is very similar to that of type Ia SNe, but slightly biased\ntowards earlier times.

The\nnon-detection provides the lower limit of the 14N/15N ratio for N2D+ of\n~700-800, which is much higher than the elemental abundance ratio in the local\nISM of ~200-300. The result indicates that N2 is depleted in 15N in the central\npart of L1544, because N2D+ preferentially traces the cold dense gas, and\nbecause it is a daughter molecule of N2. In-situ chemistry is unlikely\nresponsible for the 15N depletion in N2; neither low-temperature gas phase\nchemistry nor isotope selective photodissociation of N2 explains the 15N\ndepletion; the former prefers transferring 15N to N2, while the latter requires\nthe penetration of interstellar FUV photons into the core center.

We re-analyzed the\nself-consistent, homogeneous astrometric dataset in Konopacky (2016). The\nbest-fitting configuration agrees with our earlier findings. The planets are\nlikely involved in dynamically robust Laplace resonance chain. Hypothetical\nplanets with masses below the current detection limit of 0.1-3 Jupiter masses,\nwithin the observed inner, or beyond the outer orbit, respectively, do not\ninfluence the long term stability of the system. We predict positions of such\nnon-detected objects. The long-term stable orbital model of the observed\nplanets helps to simulate the dynamical structure of debris disks in the\nsystem. A CPU-efficient fast indicator technique makes it possible to reveal\ntheir complex, resonant shape in 10^6 particles scale. We examine the inner\nedge of the outer disk detected between 90-145 au. We also reconstruct the\nouter disk assuming that it has been influenced by convergent migration of the\nplanets. A complex shape of the disk strongly depends on various dynamical\nfactors, like orbits and masses of non-detected planets. It may be highly\nnon-circular and its models are yet non-unique, regarding both observational\nconstraints, as well as its origin. \n\n"}

To follow-up on this\nvery interesting result, here we make use of accurate HST photometry and\nFLAMES@VLT high-resolution spectroscopy to investigate in more detail the\nstellar population properties of this system. We find that the red giant branch\nof the cluster is clearly bimodal in near-UV -- optical colour-magnitude\ndiagrams, thus suggesting that IC4499 is actually composed by two\nsub-populations of stars with different nitrogen abundances. This represents\nthe first detection of multiple populations in IC4499. Consistently, we also\nfind that one star out of six is Na-rich to some extent, while we do not detect\nany evidence of intrinsic spread in both Mg and O. The number ratio between\nstars with normal and enriched nitrogen is in good agreement with the number\nratio - mass trend observed in Galactic globular clusters. Also, as typically\nfound in other systems, nitrogen rich stars are more centrally concentrated\nthan normal stars, although this result cannot be considered conclusive because\nof the limited field of view covered by our observations (~$1r_h$). On the\ncontrary, we observe that both the RGB UV color spread, which is a proxy of N\nvariations, and Na abundance variations, are significantly smaller than those\nobserved in Milky Way globular clusters with mass and metallicity comparable to\nIC4499. The modest N and Na spreads observed in this system can be tentatively\nconnected to the fact that IC4499 likely formed in a disrupted dwarf galaxy\norbiting the Milky Way, as previously proposed based on its orbit. \n\n"}

Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the kinematic properties of the multiple\npopulations (MPs) in the low-mass Galactic globular cluster NGC6362 based on a\nsample of about 500 member stars for which radial velocities (RVs), Fe and Na\nabundances have been homogeneously derived. At distances from the cluster\ncenter larger than about 0.5 $r_h$, we find that first (FG - Na-poor) and\nsecond generation (SG - Na-rich) stars show hints of different line-of-sight\nvelocity dispersion profiles, with FG stars being dynamically hotter. This is\nthe first time that differences in the velocity dispersion of MPs are detected\nby using only RVs. While kinematic differences between MPs in globular clusters\nare usually described in terms of anisotropy differences driven by the\ndifferent radial distributions, this explanation seems hardly viable for\nNGC6362, where SG and FG stars are spatially mixed. We demonstrate that the\nobserved difference in the velocity dispersion profiles can be accounted for by\nthe effect of binary stars. In fact, thanks to our multi-epoch RV measurements\nwe find that the binary fraction is significantly larger in the FG sample\n(f~14%) than in SG population (f<1%), and we show that such a difference can\ninflate the velocity dispersion of FG with respect to SG by the observed amount\nin the relevant radial range. Our results nicely match the predictions of\nstate-of-the art $N$-body simulations of the co-evolution of MPs in globular\nclusters that include the effect of binaries. \n\n"}

Our hypothesis is that\nthese deceptive observed light curves are interference of two real constant\nperiod light curves of long-lived starspots. The slow motion of these\nlong-lived starspots with respect to each other causes the observed light curve\nchanges. This hypothesis contradicts the current views of starspots. Therefore,\nwe subject it to eight reproducible tests. Our new period finding method\ndetects the two real light curves of FK Com. Our hypothesis is a total success:\nall real light curve parameters are directly connected to the long-lived\nstarspots which are also seen in the Doppler images of FK Com.These parameters\nare spatially and temporally correlated just like in the Sun, including weak\nsolar-like surface differential rotation. As for other chromospherically active\nstars, all eight reproducible tests also support our hypothesis.

Abstract: The metallicity and its relationship with other galactic properties is a\nfundamental probe of the evolution of galaxies. In this work, we select about\n750,000 star-forming spatial pixels from 1122 blue galaxies in the MaNGA survey\nto investigate the global stellar mass - local stellar mass surface density -\ngas-phase metallicity ($M_*$ - $\\Sigma_*$ - $Z$ ) relation. At a fixed $M_*$,\nthe metallicity increases steeply with increasing $\\Sigma_*$. Similarly, at a\nfixed $\\Sigma_*$, the metallicity increases strongly with increasing $M_*$ at\nlow mass end, while this trend becomes less obvious at high mass end. We find\nthe metallicity to be more strongly correlated to $\\Sigma_*$ than to $M_*$.\nFurthermore, we construct a tight (0.07 dex scatter) $M_*$ - $\\Sigma_*$ - $Z$\nrelation, which reduces the scatter in the $\\Sigma_*$ - $Z$ relation by about\n30$\\%$ for galaxies with $7.8 < {\\rm log}(M_*/M_\\odot) < 11.0$, while the\nreduction of scatter is much weaker for high-mass galaxies. This result\nsuggests that, especially for low-mass galaxies, the $M_*$ - $\\Sigma_*$ - $Z$\nrelation is largely more fundamental than the $M_*$ - $Z$ and $\\Sigma_*$ - $Z$\nrelations, meaning that both $M_*$ and $\\Sigma_*$ play important roles in\nshaping the local metallicity. We also find that the local metallicity is\nprobably independent on the local star formation rate surface density at a\nfixed $M_*$ and $\\Sigma_*$. Our results are consistent with the scenario that\nthe local metallicities in galaxies are shaped by the combination of the local\nstars formed in the history and the metal loss caused by galactic winds. \n\n"}

Abstract: Recent observations of lensed sources have shown that the faintest\n($M_{\\mathrm{UV}} \\approx -15\\,\\mathrm{mag}$) galaxies observed at z=6-8 appear\nto be extremely compact.

As supernova explosions impact the galaxy with a minimum\ndelay time that exceeds the time required to form a massive star cluster, other\nprocesses are required to explain the absence of additional massive star\nforming regions. In this work we investigate whether the radiation of a young\nmassive star cluster can suppress the formation of other detectable clusters\nwithin the same galaxy already before supernova feedback can affect the galaxy.\nWe find that in low-mass ($M_{200} \\lesssim 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$)\nhaloes, the radiation from a compact star forming region with an initial mass\nof $10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ can keep gas clumps with Jeans masses larger\nthan $\\approx 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ warm and ionized throughout the\ngalaxy. In this picture, the small intrinsic sizes measured in the faintest\n$z=6-8$ galaxies are a natural consequence of the strong radiation field that\nstabilises massive gas clumps. A prediction of this mechanism is that the\nescape fraction for ionizing radiation is high for the extremely compact,\nhigh-z sources. \n\n"}

The amplitudes of the mass functions decrease with z, but,\ncontrary to naive expectation, the comoving density of halos of a fixed\nvelocity ~200 km/s actually increases out to z=5. This is because high-z halos\nare denser, so a fixed velocity corresponds to a smaller mass.

Due to light travel time\neffects these clouds probe the activity of Sgr A* at different times in the\npast depending on their position relative to the GC and the observer. In this\npaper we combine results of recent ASCA observations along the Galactic plane,\nproviding upper limits for the scattered flux in the 4-10 keV range produced in\na given direction, with data from CO surveys of the same regions. These CO\nsurveys map the position and mass of the molecular gas which the GMCs are made\nup of. Demanding the scattered flux to be not larger than the observed one,\nthis data enables us to derive upper limits for the 4-10 keV luminosity of Sgr\nA* at certain times during the last 40.000 years down to about 8*10^40 erg/s.\nAt other times the limits are less tight, of the order of 10^41-10^42 erg/s.\nThe more extended and continuous HI distribution in the Galactic disk, which\nalso scatters the radiation emitted by Sgr A*, allows us to extend the time\ncoverage further into the past, back to about 110.000 years, albeit the limits\nare becoming less tight. We thereby can rule out a long term X-ray activity\nphase of Sgr A* at one per cent of its Eddington level ending less than about\n80.000 years ago.

The global east/west asymmetry of the gas temperature and\nsurface brightness distributions, approximately aligned with the chain of\nbright galaxies, suggests an ongoing merger, although the modest degree of the\nobserved asymmetry certainly excludes a major merger interpretation. The chain\nof galaxies probably traces the filament along which accretion has started some\ntime ago and is continuing at the present time. A cold and dense (low entropy)\ncluster core like Perseus is probably well \"protected\" against the penetration\nof the gas of infalling groups and poor clusters whereas in non-cooling core\nclusters like Coma and A1367, infalling subclusters can penetrate deeply into\nthe core region. In Perseus, gas associated with infalling groups may be\nstripped completely at the outskirts of the main cluster and only compression\nwaves (shocks) may reach the central regions. We argue that the passage of such\na wave(s) can qualitatively explain the overall horseshoe shaped appearance of\nthe gas temperature map (the hot horseshoe surrounds the colder, low entropy\ncore) as well as other features of the Perseus cluster core. As compression\nwaves traverse the cluster core, they can induce oscillatory motion of the\ncluster gas which can generate multiple sharp \"edges\", on opposite sides or the\ncentral galaxy. Gas motions induced by mergers may be a natural way to explain\nthe high frequency of \"edges\" seen in clusters with cooling cores. \n\n"}

Magnetic\nfields are natural for transmitting the energy from the central compact object\nto the small amount of baryons required for a GRB. When dissipation of the flux\nof magnetic energy by reconnection inside the flow is taken into account, the\nmagnetic model assumes several more convincing properties. For baryon loading\ntypical of observed GRB, most of the dissipation takes place just outside\nphotosphere, so that prompt emission is produced efficiently, and the magnetic\nfield strength in this region is high, resulting in efficient synchrotron\nemission. Remarkably, the dissipation also causes very efficient acceleration\nof the bulk flow. This effect is illustrated with a classical hydrodynamic\nequivalent.

Second, they are\nrelatively rare (and so tend to be more distant), and for fixed orbital\nseparation the astrometric signal falls inversely as the distance.\nNevertheless, because early-type stars are relatively more luminous, their\nhabitable zones are at larger semi-major axis.

Using the Hipparcos catalog,\nwe show that early-type stars constitute the majority of viable targets for\nastrometric searches for planets in the habitable zone.

Their distances are now\nroutinely estimated through two techniques: the expanding photosphere method\n(EPM), a primary distance-determining method, and the recently developed\nstandard-candle method (SCM), a promising secondary technique. Using Cycle 10\nHST observations, we identify 41 Cepheid variable stars in NGC 1637, the host\ngalaxy of the most thoroughly studied SN II-P to date, SN 1999em. Remarkably,\nthe Cepheid distance that we derive to NGC 1637, D = 11.7 +/- 1.0 Mpc, is\nnearly 50% larger than earlier EPM distance estimates to SN 1999em. This is the\nfirst direct comparison between these two primary distance determining methods\nfor a galaxy hosting a well-observed, spectroscopically and photometrically\nnormal, SN II-P. Extensive consistency checks show strong evidence to support\nthe Cepheid distance scale, so we are led to believe that either SN 1999em is\nin some heretofore unsuspected way an unusual SN II-P, or that the SN II-P\ndistance scale must be revised. Assuming the latter, this one calibration\nyields H_0(EPM) = 57 +/- 15 km/s/Mpc and H_0(SCM) = 59 +/- 11 km/s/Mpc;\nadditional calibrating galaxies are clearly desirable in order to test the\nrobustness of both determinations of H_0.

These observations sample luminous RLQs\nwith moderate-to-high radio-loudness (R=200-9600) and aim to connect the X-ray\nproperties of radio-quiet quasars (R<10) and highly radio-loud blazars (R>1000)\nat high redshift. This work extends a study by Bassett et al. (2004) which used\nsimilar methods to examine z > 4 RLQs with moderate radio-loudness (R=40-400).\nAll of our targets are clearly detected. A search for extended X-ray emission\nassociated with kpc-scale radio jets revealed only limited evidence for X-ray\nextension in our sample: three sources showed no evidence of X-ray extension,\nand the other three had 3-30% of their total X-ray fluxes extended >1 arcsec\naway from their X-ray cores. Additionally, we do not observe any systematic\nflattening of the optical-to-X-ray spectral index (alpha_{ox}) compared to\nlow-redshift quasars. These results suggest that kpc-scale X-ray jet emission\nis not dominated by inverse-Compton scattering of CMB-seed photons off jet\nelectrons. We measured X-ray continuum shapes and performed individual and\njoint spectral fits of our data combined with eight archival RLQs. A single\npower-law model acceptably fit the data. We added an intrinsic absorption\ncomponent to our model, and neither the moderate-R nor the high-R fits set a\nlower bound on N_H. Our spectral results suggest that intrinsic absorption does\nnot strongly depend on radio-loudness, and high-R sources have flatter power\nlaws than moderate-R sources. Overall, our high-redshift RLQs have basic X-ray\nproperties consistent with similar RLQs in the local universe. \n\n"}

We show that concerns recently raised on the efficiency of\ncompetitive accretion are incorrect as they use globally averaged properties\nwhich are inappropriate for the detailed physics of a forming stellar cluster.\nA full treatment requires a realistic treatment of the cluster potential, the\ndistribution of turbulent velocities and gas densities. Accreting gas does not\ntravel at the global virial velocity of the system due to the\nvelocity-sizescale relation inherent in turbulent gas and due to the lower\nvelocity dispersion of small-N clusters in which much of the accretion occurs.\nStars located in the gas-rich centres of such systems initially accrete from\nlow relative velocity gas attaining larger masses before needing to accrete the\nhigher velocity gas. Stars not in the centres of such potentials, or that enter\nthe cluster later when the velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete\nsignificantly and thus retain their low-masses. In competitive accretion, most\nstars do not continue to accrete significantly such that their masses are set\nfrom the fragmentation process. It is the few stars which continue to accrete\nthat become higher-mass stars. Competitive accretion is therefore likely to be\nresponsible for the formation of higher-mass stars and can explain the mass\ndistribution, mass segregation and binary frequency of these stars. Global\nkinematics of competitive accretion models include large-scale mass infall,\nwith mean inflow velocities of order 0.5 km/s at scales of 0.5 pc, but infall\nsignatures are likely to be confused by the large tangential velocities and the\nvelocity dispersion present. \n\n"}

This predicted kSZ signal at\narcminute scales is sufficiently strong to be detectable by upcoming\nexperiments, like the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and South Pole Telescope\nwhich are expected to have ~1' resolution and ~muK sensitivity. The extended\nand patchy nature of the reionization process results in a boost of the peak\nsignal in power by approximately one order of magnitude compared to a uniform\nreionization scenario, while roughly tripling the signal compared with that\nbased upon the assumption of gradual but spatially uniform reionization.

Effects of\n  X-ray Irradiation and Dust Evolution Abstract: Detailed models for the density and temperature profiles of gas and dust in\nprotoplanetary disks are constructed by taking into account X-ray and\nultraviolet (UV) irradiation from a central T Tauri star, as well as dust size\ngrowth and settling toward the disk midplane. The spatial and size\ndistributions of dust grains in the disks are numerically computed by solving\nthe coagulation equation for settling dust particles. The level populations and\nline emission of molecular hydrogen are calculated using the derived physical\nstructure of the disks. X-ray irradiation is the dominant heating source of the\ngas in the inner disk region and in the surface layer, while the far UV heating\ndominates otherwise. If the central star has strong X-ray and weak UV\nradiation, the H2 level populations are controlled by X-ray pumping, and the\nX-ray induced transition lines could be observable. If the UV irradiation is\nstrong, the level populations are controlled by thermal collisions or UV\npumping, depending on the properties of the dust grains in the disks. As the\ndust particles evolve in the disks, the gas temperature at the disk surface\ndrops because the grain photoelectric heating becomes less efficient, while the\nUV radiation fields become stronger due to the decrease of grain opacity. This\nmakes the H2 level populations change from local thermodynamic equilibrium\n(LTE) to non-LTE distributions, which results in changes to the line ratios of\nH2 emission. Our results suggest that dust evolution in protoplanetary disks\ncould be observable through the H2 line ratios. The emission lines are strong\nfrom disks irradiated by strong UV and X-rays and possessing small dust grains;\nsuch disks will be good targets in which to observe H2 emission. \n\n"}

In most cases, the resolution in current ML surveys is not accurate\nenough to observe this effect, but parallax could conceivably be detected with\nfrequent followup observations of ML events in progress. We calculate the\nexpected fraction of events where parallax distortions will be detected by such\nobservations, adopting Galactic models consistent with the observed ML\ntimescale ($t_0$) distributions. We study the dependence of the rates for\nparallax-shifted events on the sampling frequency and on the photometric\nprecision. For example, we find that for hourly observations with typical\nphotometric errors of 0.01 mag, 6\\% of events where the lens is in the bulge,\nand 31\\% of events where the lens is in the disk, (or $\\approx 10$\\% of events\noverall) will give rise to a measurable parallax shift at the 95\\% confidence\nlevel.

Abstract: Detections of deuterium in high redshift Lyman limit absorption systems along\nthe line of sight to QSOs promise to reveal the primordial deuterium abundance.\nAt present, the deuterium abundances (D/H) derived from the very few systems\nobserved are significantly discordant. Assuming the validity of all the data,\nif this discordance does not reflect intrinsic primordial inhomogeneity, then\nit must arise from processes operating after the primordial nucleosynthesis\nepoch.

In near extreme limit, under the scalar perturbation we find that the\nimaginary part of the frequency tends to zero, which is consistent with the\nprevious conjecture based on electromagnetic and axial gravitational\nperturbations. For the extreme value of the charge, the asymptotic field decay\nis dominated by a power-law tail, which shows that the extreme black hole can\nstill be stable to scalar perturbations. We also study the higher overtones for\nthe RNAdS black hole and find large variations of QNM frequencies with the\novertone number and black hole charge. The nontrivial dependence of frequencies\non the angular index is also discussed. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0604086", "contents": "Title: DGP Specteroscopy Abstract: We systematically explore the spectrum of gravitational perturbations in\ncodimension-1 DGP braneworlds, and find a 4D ghost on the self-accelerating\nbranch of solutions. The ghost appears for any value of the brane tension,\nalthough depending on the sign of the tension it is either the helicity-0\ncomponent of the lightest localized massive tensor of mass $0<m^2 < 2H^2$ for\npositive tension, the scalar `radion' for negative tension, or their admixture\nfor vanishing tension. Because the ghost is gravitationally coupled to the\nbrane-localized matter, the self-accelerating solutions are not a reliable\nbenchmark for cosmic acceleration driven by gravity modified in the IR. In\ncontrast, the normal branch of solutions is ghost-free, and so these solutions\nare perturbatively safe at large distance scales. We further find that when the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold symmetry is broken, new tachyonic instabilities, which\nare much milder than the ghosts, appear on the self-accelerating branch.\nFinally, using exact gravitational shock waves we analyze what happens if we\nrelax boundary conditions at infinity. We find that non-normalizable bulk\nmodes, if interpreted as 4D phenomena, may open the door to new ghost-like\nexcitations. \n\n"}

A new fundamental principle, the {\\em\nProcrustean Principle}, that catches the essence of our approach is postulated:\nthe low-energy world is {\\em unavoidably} an ``open\" system due to the\nspontaneous truncation of the {\\em delocalized, topological} string modes in\ncontinuous interaction with the low-lying-{\\em localized} string modes. The\norigin of space-time, the expansion of the Universe, the entropy increase and\naccompanied irreversibility of time, as well as the collapse of the\nwavefunction are all very neatly tied together. Possible observable\nconsequences include: quantum relaxation with time of the Universal,\nfundamental constants, like the velocity of light $c$ and the Planck constant\n$\\hbar$ decreasing towards their asymptotic values, and the cosmological\nconstant $\\Lambda_C$ diminishing towards zero; possible violation of {\\em CPT}\ninvariance in the $K^0-\\bar K^0$ system, possible apparent non-conservation of\nangular momentum, and possible loss of quantum coherence in SQUID-type\nexperiments. \n\n"}
