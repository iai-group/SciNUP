The testimator method is\nextended to multiple stages for the first time, shown to be unbiased and the\nvariance of the estimated slope can be proved to be smaller than the standard\nslope estimated from linear regression theory. The Schwarz Information\nCriterion (also known as the Bayesian Information Criterion) is more\nconservative than the Akaike Information Criterion and tends to choose lower\norder models. By using simulated data sets, we verify that these statistical\ntechniques can be used to detect intrinsically linear and/or non-linear P-L\nrelations.

These results are consistent with the absence of the\noxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova\nejecta into the protoplanetary disk. Instead, the presence of Al-26 in the\noldest Solar System solids (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions or CAIs) and its\napparent uniform distribution with the inferred canonical Al-26/Al-27 ratio of\n(4.5-5)E-5 support the inheritance of Al-26 from the parent giant molecular\ncloud.

Quantum fluctuations on\nthis slightly inhomogeneous background are generally statistical anisotropic.\nWe find a quadrupole modification to the ordinary isotropic spectrum.

Two versions of the\nmodel are studied, one with non-thermal DM as the origin of the boost factor\nand one with Sommerfeld enhancement. In the case of non-thermal DM, four hidden\nsector scalars which transform under a U(1)_{X} symmetry are added.

Spectrally dispersed interferograms have been obtained in the 2nd, 3rd,\nand 5th lobes, which represents the highest spatial resolution (9 mas) achieved\nfor Betelgeuse, corresponding to 5 resolution elements over its stellar disk.\nThe AMBER data in the continuum can be reasonably fitted by a uniform disk with\na diameter of 43.19+/-0.03 mas or a limb-darkening disk with 43.56+/-0.06 mas.\nThe K-band interferometric data taken at various epochs suggest that Betelgeuse\nseen in the continuum shows much smaller deviations from the above\nuniform/limb-darkened disk than predicted by 3-D convection simulations. On the\nother hand, our AMBER data in the CO lines reveal that the blue and red wings\nof the CO lines originate in spatially distinct regions over the stellar disk,\nindicating an inhomogeneous velocity field. Our AMBER data in the CO lines can\nbe roughly explained by a simple model, in which a patch of CO gas is moving\noutward or inward at velocities of 10--15 km s^-1, while the CO gas in the\nremaining region in the atmosphere is moving in the opposite direction at the\nsame velocities. The AMBER data are also consistent with the presence of warm\nmolecular layers at ~1.4--1.5 Rstar with a CO column density of ~1 x 10^20\ncm^-2. Our AMBER observations of Betelgeuse are the first spatially resolved\nstudy of the so-called macroturbulence in a stellar atmosphere other than the\nSun. The spatially resolved CO gas motion is likely to be related to convective\nmotion or intermittent mass ejections in clumps or arcs. \n\n"}

In this brief review, I survey the literature\nrelated to ground-based and Spitzer-based infrared (IR) studies of young\nstellar clusters, with particular emphasis on tracing the evolution of\nprimordial (``protoplanetary'') disks through spectroscopic and photometric\ndiagnostics. The available data demonstrate that the fraction of young stars\nwith optically thick primordial disks and/or those which show spectroscopic\nevidence for accretion appears to approximately follow an exponential decay\nwith characteristic time ~2.5 Myr (half-life = 1.7 Myr). Large IR surveys of\n~2-5 Myr-old stellar samples show that there is real cluster-by-cluster scatter\nin the observed disk fractions as a function of age. Recent Spitzer surveys\nhave found convincing evidence that disk evolution varies by stellar mass and\nenvironment (binarity, proximity to massive stars, and cluster density).\nPerhaps most significantly for understanding the planeticity of stars, the disk\nfraction decay timescale appears to vary by stellar mass, ranging from ~1 Myr\nfor >1.3 Msun stars to ~3 Myr for <0.08 Msun brown dwarfs. The exponential\ndecay function may provide a useful empirical formalism for estimating very\nrough ages for YSO populations and for modeling the effects of disk-locking on\nthe angular momentum of young stars. \n\n"}

For 45\ntransiting systems, we compute a large grid of cooling/contraction paths\nforward in time, starting from a large phase space of initial semi-major axes\nand eccentricities. Given observational constraints at the current time for a\ngiven planet (semi-major axis, eccentricity, and system age) we find possible\nevolutionary paths that match these constraints, and compare the calculated\nradii to observations. We find that tidal evolution has two effects. First,\nplanets start their evolution at larger semi-major axis, allowing them to\ncontract more efficiently at earlier times. Second, tidal heating can\nsignificantly inflate the radius when the orbit is being circularized, but this\neffect on the radius is short-lived thereafter. Often circularization of the\norbit is proceeded by a long period while the semi-major axis slowly decreases.\nSome systems with previously unexplained large radii that we can reproduce with\nour coupled model are HAT-P-7, HAT-P-9, WASP-10, and XO-4. This increases the\nnumber of planets for which we can match the radius from 24 (of 45) to as many\nas 35 for our standard case, but for some of these systems we are required to\nbe viewing them at a special time around the era of current radius inflation.\nThis is a concern for the viability of tidal inflation as a general mechanism\nto explain most inflated radii. Also, large initial eccentricities would have\nto be common. We also investigate the evolution of models that have a floor on\nthe eccentricity, as may be due to a perturber. In this scenario we match the\nextremely large radius of WASP-12b. (Abridged) \n\n"}

Structures on the stellar photosphere have been detected in the\nvisible and near-infrared as well as a compact molecular environment called the\nMOLsphere. Mid-infrared observations have revealed the nature of some of the\nmolecules in the MOLsphere, some being the precursor of dust.

Using diffraction-limited adaptive optics (AO) in the\nnear-infrared, we probe the photosphere and close environment of Betelgeuse to\nstudy the wavelength dependence of its extension, and to search for\nasymmetries. Methods: We obtained AO images with the VLT/NACO instrument,\ntaking advantage of the \"cube\" mode of the CONICA camera to record separately a\nlarge number of short-exposure frames. This allowed us to adopt a \"lucky\nimaging\" approach for the data reduction, and obtain diffraction-limited images\nover the spectral range 1.04-2.17 $\\mu$m in 10 narrow-band filters. Results: In\nall filters, the photosphere of Betelgeuse appears partly resolved. We identify\nan asymmetric envelope around the star, with in particular a relatively bright\n\"plume\" extending in the southwestern quadrant up to a radius of approximately\nsix times the photosphere. The CN molecule provides an excellent match to the\n1.09 mic bandhead in absorption in front of the stellar photosphere, but the\nemission spectrum of the plume is more difficult to interpret. Conclusions: Our\nAO images show that the envelope surrounding Betelgeuse has a complex and\nirregular structure.

The first part may be nonzero only in the presence of mhd\nturbulence, maintained, e.g., by small-scale dynamo action. It corresponds to a\nbattery, which lets a mean magnetic field grow from zero to a finite value. The\nsecond part, which covers, e.g., the alpha effect, is important for large-scale\ndynamos. Only a few examples of the aforementioned first part of mean\nelectromotive force have been discussed so far. It is shown that a mean\nelectromotive force proportional to the mean fluid velocity, but independent of\nthe mean magnetic field, may occur in an originally homogeneous isotropic mhd\nturbulence if there are nonzero correlations of velocity and electric current\nfluctuations or, what is equivalent, of vorticity and magnetic field\nfluctuations.

We investigate the effects of temperature-dependent cooling\nfunctions on the disc's gravitational stability through controlled numerical\nexperiments using an SPH code. We find that such cooling functions raise the\nsusceptibility of discs to fragmentation through the influence of temperature\nperturbations - the average value of Omega*tcool has to increase to prevent\nlocal variability leading to collapse. We find the effects of temperature\ndependence to be most significant in the \"opacity gap\" associated with dust\nsublimation, where the average value of Omega*tcool at fragmentation is\nincreased by over an order of magnitude. We then use this result to predict\nwhere protoplanetary discs will fragment into bound objects, in terms of radius\nand accretion rate. We find that without temperature dependence, for radii <\n~10AU a very large accretion rate ~10^-3 Msun/yr is required for fragmentation,\nbut that this is reduced to 10^-4 Msun/yr with temperature-dependent cooling.\nWe also find that the stability of discs with accretion rates < ~10^-7 Msun/yr\nat radii > ~50AU is enhanced by a lower background temperature if the disc\nbecomes optically thin. \n\n"}

We show that, as tidal interaction with the central\nstar leads to small eccentricities, the planets in this system could be\nundergoing resonant coupling even though the period ratios depart significantly\nfrom very precise commensurability. In a three planet system, this is indicated\nby the fact that resonant angles librate or are associated with long term\nchanges to the orbital elements. We propose that the planets in HD 40307 were\nin a strict Laplace resonance while they migrated through the disc. After\nentering the disc inner cavity, tidal interaction would cause the period ratios\nto increase from two but with the inner pair deviating less than the outer\npair, counter to what occurs in HD 40307. However, the relationship between\nthese pairs that occurs in HD 40307 might be produced if the resonance is\nimpulsively modified by an event like a close encounter shortly after the\nplanetary system decouples from the disc. We find this to be in principle\npossible for a small relative perturbation on the order of a few 1.d-3 but then\nwe find that evolution to the present system in a reasonable time is possible\nonly if the masses are significantly larger than the minimum masses and tidal\ndissipation is very effective.

Viewpoints is an interactive tool for\nexploratory visual analysis of large, high-dimensional (multivariate) data. It\nleverages the capabilities of modern graphics boards (GPUs) to run on a single\nworkstation or laptop. Viewpoints is minimalist: it attempts to do a small set\nof useful things very well (or at least very quickly) in comparison with\nsimilar packages today. Its basic feature set includes linked scatter plots\nwith brushing, dynamic histograms, normalization and outlier detection/removal.\nViewpoints was originally designed for astrophysicists, but it has since been\nused in a variety of fields that range from astronomy, quantum chemistry, fluid\ndynamics, machine learning, bioinformatics, and finance to information\ntechnology server log mining. In this article, we describe the Viewpoints\npackage and show examples of its usage. \n\n"}

However, this interpretation is based on the assumption that the spins\nof young stars are parallel to the rotation axes of protostellar discs around\nthem. We show that the interaction between a magnetic star and its\ncircumstellar disc can (but not always) have the effect of pushing the stellar\nspin axis away from the disc angular momentum axis toward the perpendicular\nstate and even the retrograde state. Planets formed in the disc may therefore\nhave their orbital axes misaligned with the stellar spin axis, even before any\nadditional planet-planet scatterings or Kozai interactions take place. In\ngeneral, magnetosphere--disc interactions lead to a broad distribution of the\nspin--orbit angles, with some systems aligned and other systems misaligned. \n\n"}

The most popular interpretation of the MSP is that\nthe smallest dark matter halos in the universe are extremely inefficient at\nforming stars. The question from that standpoint is to identify the feedback\nsource that makes small halos dark and to identify any obvious mass scale where\nthe truncation in the efficiency of galaxy formation occurs. Among the most\nexciting developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery\nof a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide\nfield, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite count\nin less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint galaxies that are\nless luminous that some star clusters.

We present the first spectroscopic study at high resolution,\nR~50,000, of the potentially best solar twin, M67-1194, identified among\nsolar-like stars in M67. Based on a pre-selection of solar-twin candidates\nperformed at medium resolution by Pasquini et al.

Working with a solar twin in the framework of a\ndifferential analysis, we minimize systematic model errors in the abundance\nanalysis compared to previous studies which utilized more evolved stars to\ndetermine the metallicity of M67. We find M67-1194 to have stellar parameters\nindistinguishable from the solar values, with the exception of the overall\nmetallicity which is slightly super-solar ([Fe/H]=0.023 +/- 0.015). An age\ndetermination based on evolutionary tracks yields 4.2 +/- 1.6Gyr.

Given that the planet orbits a\nsolar-like star at a distance of on ly 4.5 R*, it is expected that material\nreleased from its surface may then form an exosphere.

We consider two scenarios: (1) the stellar magnetic field\nis strong enough to confine the hot coronal plasma out to the planetary orbit\nand (2) the stellar magnetic field is unable to confine the plasma, which\nescapes in a wind. In both cases, a shock capable of compressing plasma to the\nobserved densities will form around the planet for plasma temperatures T < (4 -\n5) x 10^6 K.

A\nsimple, time-dependent model of H_2 formation can reproduce the gross behavior,\nalthough turbulent density perturbations increase molecular fractions by a\nfactor of few above it. In contradiction to equilibrium models, radiative\ndissociation of molecules plays little role in our model for diffuse radiation\nfields with strengths less than ten times that of the solar neighborhood,\nbecause of the effective self-shielding of H_2. The observed correlation of\nR_mol with pressure corresponds to a correlation with local gas density if the\neffective temperature in the cold neutral medium of galactic disks is roughly\nconstant. We indeed find such a correlation of R_mol with density. If we\nexamine the value of R_mol in our local models after a free-fall time at their\naverage density, as expected for models of molecular cloud formation by\nlarge-scale gravitational instability, our models reproduce the observed\ncorrelation over more than an order of magnitude range in density. \n\n"}

In this work, we create detailed models for a range of old simple\nstellar populations (SSPs), to create a variety of realistic HB morphologies,\nfrom extended red clumps, to extreme blue HBs. We achieve this by utilising\nstellar tracks from the BaSTI database and implementing a different mass loss\nprescription for each SSP created, resulting in different HB morphologies. We\nfind that, for each metallicity, there is some HB morphology which maximises\nHbeta, making an underlying 14Gyr population look ~5-6Gyr old for the low and\nintermediate metallicity cases, and as young as 2Gyr for a solar metallicity\nSSP. We explore whether there are any spectral indices capable of breaking the\ndegeneracy between an old SSP with extended blue HB and a truly young or\nintermediate age SSP, and find that the CaII index of Rose(1984) and the\nstrength of the MgII doublet at 2800A are promising candidates, in combination\nwith Hbeta and other metallicity indicators such as Mgb and Fe5406.

As a result, heavy elements will be\nunder-ionized after they have passed through the accretion shock. We have\nstudied systematically the effects of non-equilibrium ionization for relaxed\nclusters in the LambdaCDM cosmology using one-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations. We found that non-equilibrium ionization effects do not depend on\ncluster mass but depend strongly on redshift which can be understood by\nself-similar scaling arguments. The effects are stronger for clusters at lower\nredshifts. We present X-ray signatures such as surface brightness profiles and\nemission lines in detail for a massive cluster at low redshift. In general,\nsoft emission (0.3-1.0 keV) is enhanced significantly by under-ionization, and\nthe enhancement can be nearly an order of magnitude near the shock radius. The\nmost prominent non-equilibrium ionization signature we found is the O VII and O\nVIII line ratio. The ratios for non-equilibrium ionization and collisional\nionization equilibrium models are different by more than an order of magnitude\nat radii beyond half of the shock radius. These non-equilibrium ionization\nsignatures are equally strong for models with different non-adiabatic shock\nelectron heating efficiencies.

Instead, dynamical fits with dark matter halos\nare in good agreement with lensing results. We derive mass-to-light ratios of\nthe stellar populations from Lick absorption line indices, reproducing well the\nobserved galaxy colours. Even in dynamical models with dark matter halos the\namount of mass that follows the light increases more rapidly with galaxy\nvelocity dispersion than expected for a constant stellar initial mass function\n(IMF). While galaxies around sigma ~ 200 km/s are consistent with a Kroupa IMF,\nthe same IMF underpredicts luminous dynamical masses of galaxies with sigma ~\n300 km/s by a factor of two and more. A systematic variation of the stellar IMF\nwith galaxy velocity dispersion could explain this trend with a Salpeter IMF\nfor the most massive galaxies. If the IMF is instead constant, then some of the\ndark matter in high velocity dispersion galaxies must follow a spatial\ndistribution very similar to that of the light. A combination of both, a\nvarying IMF and a component of dark matter that follows the light is possible\nas well.

Multiplanet systems provide two key ingredients for explaining the\norigins of transitional disks. First, multiple planets can clear wide inner\nholes where single planets open only narrow gaps. Second, the confined,\nnon-axisymmetric accretion flows produced by multiple planets provide a way for\nan arbitrary amount of mass transfer to occur through an apparently optically\nthin hole without over-producing infrared excess flux.

Additionally, by\ndeblending the Lyman-alpha forest into a sum of thermally broadened individual\nlines, we find superb agreement with the observed lower cutoff of the\nline-width distribution and abundances of neutral hydrogen column densities.\nUsing the most recent constraints on the cosmic ultraviolet (UV) background,\nthis excellent agreement with observations does not require rescaling the\namplitude of the UV background; a procedure that was routinely used in the past\nto match the observed level of transmitted flux. We also show that our\nblazar-heated model matches the data better than standard simulations even when\nsuch a rescaling is allowed. This concordance between Lyman-alpha data and\nsimulations, which are based on the most recent cosmological parameters,\nsuggests that the inclusion of blazar heating alleviates previous tensions on\nconstraints for sigma_8 derived from Lyman-alpha measurements and other\ncosmological data.

Being highly non-linear and stochastic, the outcome\nof collapse can only be explored theoretically by performing large ensembles of\nnumerical simulations. Standard practice is to quantify the initial turbulent\nvelocity field in a core in terms of the amount of turbulent energy (or some\nequivalent) and the exponent in the power spectrum (n \\equiv -d log Pk /d log\nk). In this paper, we present a numerical study of the influence of the details\nof the turbulent velocity field on the collapse of an isolated, weakly\nturbulent, low-mass prestellar core. We show that, as long as n > 3 (as is\nusually assumed), a more critical parameter than n is the maximum wavelength in\nthe turbulent velocity field, {\\lambda}_MAX. This is because {\\lambda}_MAX\ncarries most of the turbulent energy, and thereby influences both the amount\nand the spatial coherence of the angular momentum in the core. We show that the\nformation of dense filaments during collapse depends critically on\n{\\lambda}_MAX, and we explain this finding using a force balance analysis.

These disks have been\nconfirmed to have giant central cavities by imaging of the submillimeter\n(sub-mm) continuum emission using the Submillimeter Array (SMA). However, the\npolarized near-infrared scattered light images for most objects in a systematic\nIRS/SMA cross sample, obtained by HiCIAO on the Subaru telescope, show no\nevidence for the cavity, in clear contrast with SMA and Spitzer observations.\nRadiative transfer modeling indicates that many of these scattered light images\nare consistent with a smooth spatial distribution for micron-sized grains, with\nlittle discontinuity in the surface density of the micron-sized grains at the\ncavity edge.

Due to the changing luminosity of\nthe central source, light echoes propagate into the nebula. This remarkable\nphenomenon was the subject of Paper I.The origin and physical properties of the\nnebula are however uncertain: it may have been created through mass loss from\nthe star itself, or it could be the remnant of a pre-existing interstellar\ncloud. Our goal is to determine the 3D structure of the nebula, and estimate\nits mass. Knowing the geometrical shape of the nebula will also allow us to\nretrieve the distance of RS Pup in an unambiguous manner using a model of its\nlight echoes (in a forthcoming work). The scattering angle of the Cepheid light\nin the circumstellar nebula can be recovered from its degree of linear\npolarization. We thus observed the nebula surrounding RS Pup using the\npolarimetric imaging mode of the VLT/FORS instrument, and obtained a map of the\ndegree and position angle of linear polarization. From our FORS observations,\nwe derive a 3D map of the distribution of the dust, whose overall geometry is\nan irregular and thin layer. The nebula does not present a well-defined\nsymmetry. Using a simple model, we derive a total dust mass of M(dust) = 2.9\n+/- 0.9 Msun for the dust within 1.8 arcmin of the Cepheid. This translates\ninto a total mass of M(gas+dust) = 290 +/- 120 Msun, assuming a dust-to-gas\nratio of 1.0 +/- 0.3 %. The high mass of the dusty nebula excludes that it was\ncreated by mass-loss from the star. However, the thinness nebula is an\nindication that the Cepheid participated to its shaping, e.g. through its\nradiation pressure or stellar wind. RS Pup therefore appears as a regular\nlong-period Cepheid located in an exceptionally dense interstellar environment. \n\n"}

In particular, we examine the resonance\nrelations that occur, by varying the physical and initial orbital parameters of\nthe planets (mass, initial semi-major axis and eccentricity) as well as the\nparameters of the migration forces (migration rate and eccentricity damping\nrate), which are modeled here through a simplified analytic prescription. We\nfind that, in general, for planetary masses below 1.5 M_J, multiple-planet\nresonances of the form n3:n2:n1=1:2:4 and 1:3:6 are established, as the inner\nplanets, m1 and m2, get trapped in a 1:2 resonance and the outer planet m3\nsubsequently is captured in a 1:2 or 1:3 resonance with m2. For mild\neccentricity damping, the resonance pumps the eccentricities of all planets on\na relatively short time-scale, to the point where they enter an\ninclination-type resonance (as in Libert & Tsiganis 2011); then mutual\ninclinations can grow to ~35{\\deg}, thus forming a \"3-D system\".

We create an artificial sky of sources and\nsynthetically observe it under four basic survey strategies, creating an\nend-to-end simulation of an imaging survey for each. These catalog-level\nsimulations include realistic measurement uncertainties and a complex\nfocal-plane dependence of the instrument response.

We reexamine\nthis problem by considering porosity evolution of dust aggregates. We apply a\nporosity model based on recent N-body simulations of aggregate collisions,\nwhich allows us to study the porosity change upon collision for a wide range of\nimpact energies. As a first step, we neglect collisional fragmentation and\ninstead focus on dust evolution outside the snow line, where the fragmentation\nhas been suggested to be less significant than inside the snow line because of\na high sticking efficiency of icy particles. We show that dust particles can\nevolve into highly porous aggregates (with internal densities of much less than\n0.1 g/cm^3) even if collisional compression is taken into account. We also show\nthat the high porosity triggers significant acceleration in collisional growth.\nThis acceleration is a natural consequence of particles' aerodynamical property\nat low Knudsen numbers, i.e., at particle radii larger than the mean free path\nof the gas molecules. Thanks to this rapid growth, the highly porous aggregates\nare found to overcome the radial drift barrier at orbital radii less than 10 AU\n(assuming the minimum-mass solar nebula model).

Here we focus on a subclass of these events, where the light\ncurve is also tens of days wide, so the total radiated energy is order 10^{51}\nerg. If the origin of these SLSNe is a core-collapse-driven explosion of a\nmassive star, then the mechanism which converts the explosion energy into\nradiation must be very efficient (much more than in typical core collapse SNe,\nwhere this efficiency is of order one percent). We examine the scenario where\nthe radiated luminosity is due to efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the\nejected stellar envelope into radiation by interaction with an optically thick,\npre-existing circumstellar material (CSM), presumably the product of a steady\nwind from the progenitor. We base the analysis on a simple, numerically solved,\nhydrodynamic diffusion model, which allows us to identify the qualitative\nbehavior of the observable light curves, and to relate them to the parameters\nof the wind.

Using galaxy group/cluster catalogs from SDSS DR7, together with a\ncosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the star\nformation histories and quenching timescales of satellites of M_star > 5 x 10^9\nM_sun at z=0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing\nand ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly\naccounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z~0.5, or ~5 Gyr\nago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the SFRs of satellites at their\ntime of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the\nevolution of central galaxy SFRs and quiescent fractions. With this, we\nconstrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of\nsatellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant\nprocess for building up all quiescent galaxies at M_star < 10^10 M_sun. We then\nconstrain satellite star formation histories, finding a 'delayed-then-rapid'\nquenching scenario: satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall,\nafter which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of < 0.8\nGyr.

We prove that the peculiar light-curve of this objects is in\nagreement with the idea of a planet with a comet like tail. There is an\nevidence of a quasi periodic long term evolution of the tail. Light-curve has a\nprominent pre-transit brightening and a less prominent post-transit\nbrightening. Both are caused by the forward scattering and are a strong\nfunction of the particle size. This feature enabled us to estimate a typical\nparticle size (radius) in the dust tail of about 0.1-1 micron. However, there\nis an indication that the particle size changes along the tail.

A conducting fluid of magnetic Prandtl number Pm=0.01 is driven into\nmotion by the counter-rotation of the two hemispheric walls. The resulting flow\nis of von K\\'arm\\'an type, consisting of a layer of zonal velocity close to the\nouter wall and a secondary meridional circulation. Above a certain forcing\nthreshold, the mean flow is unstable to non-axisymmetric motions within an\nequatorial belt. For fixed forcing above this threshold, we have studied the\ndynamo properties of this flow. The presence of a conducting outer wall is\nessential to the existence of a dynamo at these parameters. We have therefore\nstudied the effect of changing the material parameters of the wall (magnetic\npermeability, electrical conductivity, and thickness) on the dynamo. In common\nwith previous studies, we find that dynamos are obtained only when either the\nconductivity or the permeability is sufficiently large.

Metal-poor dSph stars also help to reveal the\nformation mechanism of the Milky Way halo.

The most striking discovery\nin these data is that unlike previous reports, the spectrum exhibited Balmer\nlines with very broad P-Cygni profiles characteristic of normal Type II\nsupernovae (SNe II), in addition to narrow emission lines seen in SNe IIn and\nLBVs. Emission components have FWHM 8000 km/s, while the P-Cygni absorption\ncomponent has blue wings extending to -13,000 km/s. These velocities are\ntypical of SNe II, but have never been associated with emission lines from a\nnonterminal LBV-like eruption. Initially, the peak absolute magnitude seemed\nfainter than that of normal SNe. However, after a brief period of fading, the\nsource quickly brightened again to M_R=-17.5 mag over a couple days.

It is highly probable that this cluster environment influenced\nvarious properties of the solar system like its chemical composition, size and\nthe orbital parameters of some of its constituting bodies. In the Milky Way,\nclusters with more than 2000 stars only form in two types - starburst clusters\nand leaky clusters - each following a unique temporal development in the\nmass-radius plane. The aim is here to determine the encounter probability in\nthe range relevant to solar system formation for starburst or leaky cluster\nenvironments as a function of cluster age. N-body methods are used to\ninvestigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions\nbetween cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs. Using\nthe now available knowledge of the cluster density at a given cluster age it is\ndemonstrated that in starburst clusters the central densities over the first\n5Myr are so high (initially > 10^5 Msun pc^{-3}) that hardly any discs with\nsolar system building potential would survive this phase. This makes a\nstarburst clusters an unlikely environment for the formation of our solar\nsystem. Instead it is highly probable that the solar system formed in a leaky\ncluster (often classified as OB association). It is demonstrated that an\nencounter determining the characteristic properties existing in our solar\nsystems most likely happened very early on (< 2Myr) in its formation history\nand that after 5Myr the likelihood of a solar-type star experiencing such an\nencounter in a leaky cluster is negligible even if it was still part of the\nbound remnant.

Morphologies for the AGN host galaxies were derived from the\nGalaxy Zoo project.\n  Our results suggest that broad-line AGN and narrow-line AGN reside in widely\ndifferent environments where the neighbours to Type-2 AGN are more star-forming\nand bluer than those of Type-1 AGN. There is a colour-dependency only\ndetectable in the neighbours with photometric redshifts for the Type-2 AGN. We\nsee that the ratio between Type-1/Type-2 neighbours to Type-2 AGN decreases\nsteadily at short separations with a statistical significance of 4.5 sigma. The\nlack of change in the morphology of the Type-2 AGN hosts having a close\ncompanion (contrary to the case of Type-1 AGN hosts) suggests that the innate\nstate of Type-2 AGN is extremely short-lived and is not preserved in subsequent\nmergers. Finally, we perform a hypothetical luminosity test to investigate\nwhether a mass bias in our selection could explain the observed differences in\nour samples. Our conclusion is that AGN unification is consistently not\nsupported by the environment of the two types of AGN, but that an evolutionary\nconnection between them might exist. \n\n"}

HAT-P-42b and HAT-P-43b are typical hot Jupiters on\ncircular orbits around early-G/late-F main sequence host stars, with periods of\n4.641876\\pm0.000032 and 3.332688\\pm0.000016 days, masses of 0.975\\pm0.126 and\n0.660\\pm0.083 Mjup, and radii of 1.277\\pm0.149 and 1.283+0.057-0.034 Rjup,\nrespectively. These discoveries increase the sample of planets with measured\nmean densities, which is needed to constrain theories of planetary interiors\nand atmospheres. Moreover, their hosts are relatively bright (V < 13.5)\nfacilitating further follow-up studies. \n\n"}

Multi-planet\nevolved systems are particularly complex because of the mutual interactions\nbetween the planets. Here, we study the underlying dynamical mechanisms which\ncan incite planetary escape in two-planet post-main sequence systems. Stellar\nmass loss alone is unlikely to be rapid and high enough to eject planets at\ntypically-observed separations. However, the combination of mass loss and\nplanet-planet interactions can prompt a shift from stable to chaotic regions of\nphase space. Consequently, when mass loss ceases, the unstable configuration\nmay cause escape. By assuming a constant stellar mass loss rate, we utilize\nmaps of dynamical stability to illustrate the distribution of regular and\nchaotic trajectories in phase space. We show that chaos can drive the planets\nto undergo close encounters, leading to the ejection of one planet. Stellar\nmass loss can trigger the transition of a planetary system from a stable to\nchaotic configuration, subsequently causing escape. We find that mass loss\nnon-adiabatically affects planet-planet interaction for the most massive\nprogenitor stars which avoid the supernova stage.

The stronger photometric period around 0.12245 d, which had been\ndetected from the ground-based observation, was found to be variable, and we\nidentified this period as being the positive superhump period.

The fractional\nsuperhump excess varied as large as ~30%. The variation of the period very well\ntraced the variation of the brightness of the system. The time-scales of this\nvariation of the superhump period was too slow to be interpreted as the\nvariation caused by the change in the disk radius due to the thermal disk\ninstability.

The\nsSFRmax can exceed the time-averaged sSFR by about an order of magnitude for\nmassive galaxies. The metallicity - redshift relations for subsamples of\ngalaxies with sSFR = sSFRmax and with sSFR = 0.1sSFRmax coincide for massive\n(log(Ms/Mo) > 10.5, with stellar mass Ms in solar units) galaxies and differ\nfor low-mass galaxies. This suggests that there is no correlation between\noxygen abundance and sSFR in massive galaxies and that the oxygen abundance\ncorrelates with the sSFR in low-mass galaxies. We find evidence in favour of\nthat the irregular galaxies show, on average, higher sSFR and lower oxygen\nabundances than the spiral galaxies of similar masses and that the mass -\nmetallicity relation for spiral galaxies differs slightly from that for\nirregular galaxies. The fact that our sample of low-mass galaxies is the\nmixture of spiral and irregular galaxies can be responsible for the dependence\nof the metallicity - redshift relation on the sSFR observed for the low-mass\nSDSS galaxies.

This monitoring was performed in\norder to investigate variabilities of the Be disk due to the interaction with\nthe neutron star in recent X-ray active phase from 2008 to 2011.

In this paper, a full\nanalysis of the Halpha line profiles as well as other line profiles is carried\nout.

The evolution of the\ndark matter fluctuations can be described as a global coordinate transformation\ncaused by the long-wavelength displacement vector acting on short-wavelength\nmatter perturbation undergoing non-linear growth. Using this feature, we\ninvestigate the well known cancellation of the high-$k$ solutions in the\nstandard perturbation theory. While the standard perturbation theory naturally\nsatisfies the cancellation of the high-$k$ solutions, some of the recently\nproposed improved perturbation theories do not guarantee the cancellation. We\nshow that this cancellation clarifies the success of the standard perturbation\ntheory at the 2-loop order in describing the amplitude of the non-linear power\nspectrum even at high-$k$ regions.We propose an extension of the standard\n2-loop level perturbation theory model of the non-linear power spectrum that\nmore accurately models the non-linear evolution of the baryon acoustic\noscillation than the standard perturbation theory.

The explanation in vogue borrows from the\nvortex literature by suggesting that these asymmetries are the result of dust\ntrapping in giant vortices, excited via Rossby wave instability (RWI) at\nplanetary gap edges. Due to the drag force, dust trapped in vortices will\naccumulate in the center, and diffusion is needed to maintain a steady state\nover the lifetime of the disk. While previous work derived semi-analytical\nmodels of the process, in this paper we provide analytical steady-state\nsolutions. Exact solutions exist for certain vortex models. The solution is\ndetermined by the vortex rotation profile, the gas scale height, the vortex\naspect ratio, and the ratio of dust diffusion to gas-dust friction. In\nprinciple, all these quantities can be derived from observations, which would\ngive validation of the model, also giving constrains on the strength of the\nturbulence inside the vortex core. Based on our solution, we derive quantities\nsuch as the gas-dust contrast, the trapped dust mass, and the dust contrast at\nthe same orbital location.

Different methods can provide different results, which leads to\ndifferent planet characteristics.}%Spectroscopic surface gravities have shown\nto be poorly constrained, but the photometry of the transiting planet can\nprovide an independent measurement of the surface gravity.\n  Aims. In this paper, we use a uniform method to spectroscopically derive\nstellar atmospheric parameters, chemical abundances, stellar masses, and\nstellar radii for a sample of 90 transit hosts. Surface gravities are also\nderived photometrically using the stellar density as derived from the light\ncurve.

Often they show\ncoordinated variability at different frequencies, suggesting that in these\ncases the same population of electrons is at work, in a single zone of the jet.\nThe location of this region along the jet is a matter of debate. The jet power\ncorrelates with the mass accretion rate, with jets existing at all values of\ndisk luminosities, measured in Eddington units, sampled so far. The most\npowerful blazars show clear evidence of the emission from their disks, and this\nhas revived methods of finding the black hole mass and accretion rate by\nmodelling a disk spectrum to the data.

Motivated by ongoing direct imaging searches\nfor giant planets, this study investigates core mass requirements in the outer\ndisk. To determine the fastest allowed rates of gas accretion, we consider\nsolid cores that no longer accrete planetesimals, as this would heat the\ngaseous envelope. Our spherical, two-layer atmospheric cooling model includes\nan inner convective region and an outer radiative zone that matches onto the\ndisk. We determine the minimum core mass for a giant planet to form within a\ntypical disk lifetime of 3 Myr. The minimum core mass declines with disk\nradius, from ~8.5 Earth masses at 5 AU to ~3.5 Earth masses at 100 AU, with\nstandard interstellar grain opacities. Lower temperatures in the outer disk\nexplain this trend, while variations in disk density are less influential. At\nall distances, a lower dust opacity or higher mean molecular weight reduces the\ncritical core mass. Our non-self-gravitating, analytic cooling model reveals\nthat self-gravity significantly affects early atmospheric evolution, starting\nwhen the atmosphere is only ~10% as massive as the core. \n\n"}

Studies of\nstripped-envelope supernovae, in particular, require binary mass transfer.\nDramatic examples of eruptive mass loss are seen in Type IIn supernovae, which\nhave massive shells ejected just a few years before core collapse.

Using an N-body code we explore how the\nnumber and sequence of transits vary as functions of observing time and orbital\nparameters. The concept is then generalised thanks to a suite of simulated\ncircumbinary systems. Binaries are constructed from RV surveys of the solar\nneighbourhood. They are then populated with orbiting gas giants, drawn from a\nrange of distributions. The binary population is shown to be compatible with\nthe Kepler eclipsing binary catalogue, indicating that the properties of\nbinaries may be as universal as the initial mass function. These synthetic\nsystems produce transiting circumbinary planets occurring on both eclipsing and\nnon-eclipsing binaries. Simulated planets transiting eclipsing binaries are\ncompared with published Kepler detections.

The dynamical evolution of near-parabolic comets strongly depends on\nthe starting values of the orbital elements derived from the positional\nobservations.

I apply a completely homogeneous approach to determine the cometary\norbits and their uncertainties. The resulting catalogue is suitable for the\ninvestigation of the origin and future of near-parabolic comets.\n  Methods. First, osculating orbits were determined on the basis of positional\ndata. Second, the dynamical calculations were performed backwards and forwards\nup to 250 au from the Sun to derive original and future barycentric orbits for\neach comet. In the present investigation of dynamical evolution, the numerical\ncalculations for a given object start from the swarm of virtual comets\nconstructed using the previously determined osculating (nominal) orbit.

Super-AGB stars are expected to\nhave slow winds with high mass-loss rates, so their wind density is high. The\nexplosions of super-AGB stars are therefore presumed to occur in this dense\nwind. We provide the first synthetic light curves (LCs) for such events by\nexploding realistic electron-capture supernova (ecSN) progenitors within their\nsuper-AGB winds. We find that the early LC, i.e. before the recombination wave\nreaches the bottom of the H-rich envelope of SN ejecta (the plateau phase), is\nnot affected by the dense wind. However, after the plateau phase, the\nluminosity remains higher when the super-AGB wind is taken into account. We\ncompare our results to the historical LC of SN 1054, the progenitor of the Crab\nNebula, and show that the explosion of an ecSN within an ordinary super-AGB\nwind can explain the LC features. We conclude that SN 1054 could have been a\nType IIn SN without any extra extreme mass loss which was previously suggested\nto be necessary to account for its early high luminosity. We also show that our\nLCs match Type IIn SNe with an early plateau phase (`Type IIn-P') and suggest\nthat they are ecSNe within super-AGB winds. Although some ecSNe can be bright\nin the optical spectral range due to the large progenitor radius, their X-ray\nluminosity from the interaction does not necessarily get as bright as other\nType IIn SNe whose optical luminosities are also powered by the interaction.\nThus, we suggest that optically-bright X-ray-faint Type IIn SNe can emerge from\necSNe. Optically-faint Type IIn SNe, such as SN 2008S, can also originate from\necSNe if their H-rich envelope masses are small.

We focus on regions toward outer disk radii, from 5-60AU, where\nOhmic resistivity tends to become negligible, ambipolar diffusion dominates\nover an extended region across disk height, and the Hall effect largely\ncontrols the dynamics near the disk midplane. We find that around R=5AU, the\nsystem launches a laminar/weakly turbulent magnetocentrifugal wind when the net\nvertical field Bz is not too weak, as expected. Moreover, the wind is able to\nachieve and maintain a configuration with reflection symmetry at disk midplane.\nThe case with anti-aligned field polarity (Omega. Bz<0) is more susceptible to\nthe MRI when Bz drops, leading to an outflow oscillating in radial directions\nand very inefficient angular momentum transport. At the outer disk around and\nbeyond R=30AU, the system shows vigorous MRI turbulence in the surface layer\ndue to far-UV ionization, which efficiently drives disk accretion. The Hall\neffect affects the stability of the midplane region to the MRI, leading to\nstrong/weak Maxwell stress for aligned/anti-aligned field polarities.\nNevertheless, the midplane region is only very weakly turbulent.

These clusters contain some of the most massive stars in the\nGalaxy and strongly interact with nearby giant molecular clouds (GMC). We study\nthe young stellar populations of the region and of the OC Pismis24, focusing on\ntheir relationship with the nearby GMCs. We seek evidence of triggered star\nformation propagating from the clusters. We used new deep JHKs photometry,\nalong with unpublished deep IRAC/Spitzer MIR photometry, complemented with\noptical HST/WFPC2 high spatial resolution photometry and X-ray Chandra\nobservations, to constrain age, initial mass function, and star formation modes\nin progress. We carefully examine and discuss all sources of bias (saturation,\nconfusion, different sensitivities, extinction). NGC6357 hosts three large\nyoung stellar clusters, of which Pismis24 is the most prominent. We found that\nPismis24 is a very young (~1-3 Myr) OC with a Salpeter-like IMF and a few\nthousand members. A comparison between optical and IR photometry indicates that\nthe fraction of members with a NIR excess (i. e., with a circumstellar disk) is\nin the range 0.3-0.6, consistent with its photometrically derived age. We also\nfind that Pismis24 is likely subdivided into a few different sub-clusters, one\nof which contains almost all the massive members. There are indications of\ncurrent star formation triggered by these massive stars, but clear age trends\ncould not be derived (although the fraction of stars with a NIR excess does\nincrease towards the HII region associated with the cluster).

This system has been shown\ntransiting between a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) state and a rotation-powered\nMSP state. The NuSTAR observations were taken in both LMXB state and\nrotation-powered state. The source is clearly seen in both states up to ~79\nkeV. During the LMXB state, the 3-79 keV flux is about a factor of 10 higher\nthat in the rotation-powered state.

We propose that\nthis correlation is due to the absorption by circumstellar matter that comes\nfrom the evaporation of the planets.

Furthermore, this probability rapidly approaches zero at increasing\norbital period. Therefore transit surveys have been predominantly limited to\nthe inner parts of exoplanetary systems. Here we demonstrate how circumbinary\nplanets allow us to beat these unfavourable odds. By incorporating the geometry\nand the three-body dynamics of circumbinary systems, we analytically derive the\nprobability of transitability, a configuration where the binary and planet\norbits overlap on the sky. We later show that this is equivalent to the transit\nprobability, but at an unspecified point in time. This probability, at its\nminimum, is always higher than for single star cases. In addition, it is an\nincreasing function with mutual inclination. By applying our analytical\ndevelopment to eclipsing binaries, we deduce that transits are highly probable,\nand in some case guaranteed. For example, a circumbinary planet revolving at 1\nAU around a 0.3 AU eclipsing binary is certain to eventually transit - a 100%\nprobability - if its mutual inclination is greater than 0.6 deg. We show that\nthe transit probability is generally only a weak function of the planet's\norbital period; circumbinary planets may be used as practical tools for probing\nthe outer regions of exoplanetary systems to search for and detect warm to cold\ntransiting planets. \n\n"}

Both analytical work and simulations have shown that typical\nencounters generate streams that are extremely thin. In this paper we show that\nthis implies that even small relativistic precessions attributed to black hole\nspin can induce deflections that prevent the stream from self-intersecting even\nafter many windings. Additionally, hydrodynamical simulations have demonstrated\nthat energy is deposited very slowly via hydrodynamic processes alone,\nresulting in the liberation of very little gravitational binding energy in the\nabsence of stream-stream collisions. This naturally leads to a \"dark period\" in\nwhich the flare is not observable for some time, persisting for up to a dozen\norbital periods of the most bound material, which translates to years for\ndisruptions around black holes with mass $\\sim 10^{7} M_{\\odot}$. We find that\nmore-massive black holes tend to have more violent stream self-intersections,\nresulting in short viscous times that lead to prompt accretion onto the black\nhole. For these tidal disruption events (TDEs), the accretion rate onto the\nblack hole should still closely follow the original fallback rate after a fixed\ndelay time $t_{\\rm delay}$. For lower black hole masses ($M_{\\rm h} \\lesssim\n10^{6}$), we find that flares are typically slowed down by about an order of\nmagnitude, and because the accretion rates for TDEs about higher-mass black\nhole are already sub-Eddington, this results in the majority of TDEs being\nsub-Eddington at peak. This also implies that current searches for TDEs are\nbiased towards prompt flares, with slowed flares likely having been\nunidentified. [abridged] \n\n"}

We applied our formalism to low- and\nhigh-mass star formation models obtained by numerical simulations of\ngravitational collapse that include rotation and turbulence. In general, we\nfound that the decoupling between gas and magnetic fields, condition allowing\nthe collapse to go ahead, occurs only when the cosmic-ray attenuation is taken\ninto account with respect to a calculation in which the cosmic-ray ionisation\nrate is kept constant.

Abstract: We assess a model of late cosmic reionization in which the ionizing\nbackground radiation arises entirely from high redshift quasars and other\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs). The low optical depth to Thomson scattering\nreported by the Planck Collaboration pushes the redshift of instantaneous\nreionization down to z=8.8^{+1.7}_{-1.4} and greatly reduces the need for\nsignificant Lyman-continuum emission at very early times. We show that, if\nrecent claims of a numerous population of faint AGNs at z=4-6 are upheld, and\nthe high inferred AGN comoving emissivity at these epochs persists to higher,\nz~10, redshifts, then active galaxies may drive the reionization of hydrogen\nand helium with little contribution from normal star-forming galaxies. We\ndiscuss an AGN-dominated scenario that satisfies a number of observational\nconstraints: the HI photoionization rate is relatively flat over the range\n2<z<5, hydrogen gets fully reionized by z=5.7, and the integrated Thomson\nscattering optical depth is tau=0.056, in agreement with measurements based on\nthe Lya opacity of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) polarization. It is a prediction of the model that helium gets\ndoubly reionized before redshift 4, the heat input from helium reionization\ndominates the thermal balance of the IGM after hydrogen reionization, and z>5\nAGNs provide a significant fraction of the unresolved X-ray background at 2\nkeV. Singly- and doubly-ionized helium contribute about 13% to tau, and the\nHeIII volume fraction is already 50% when hydrogen becomes fully reionized. \n\n"}

Robust detections of Zeeman\nsignatures at all observed epochs indicate a surface magnetic field, with\nlongitudinal magnetic field strengths varying between 1.0-3.2 G. Radial\nvelocity variations from night to night modulate on a similar timescale to the\nlongitudinal magnetic field measurements.

We therefore directly simulate, for the first\ntime, the behavior of aerodynamic grains in highly supersonic,\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence typical of MCs. We show that, under these\nconditions, grains with sizes a >0.01 micron exhibit dramatic (exceeding factor\n~1000) fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratio (implying large small-scale\nvariations in abundances, dust cooling rates, and dynamics). The dust can form\nhighly filamentary structures (which would be observed in both dust emission\nand extinction), which can be much thinner than the characteristic width of gas\nfilaments. Sometimes, the dust and gas filaments are not even in the same\nlocation. The 'clumping factor' of the dust (critical for dust\ngrowth/coagulation/shattering) can reach ~100, for grains in the ideal size\nrange.

We impose either a vertical or a\nhorizontal uniform magnetic field in a convection-driven turbulent flow.\nResults: We find that super-equipartition magnetic flux concentrations are\nformed near the surface with domain depths of $12.5$ and $24$ Mm. The size of\nthe concentrations increases as the box size increases and the largest\nstructures ($20$ Mm horizontally) are obtained in the 24 Mm deep models. The\nfield strength in the concentrations is in the range of $3$-$5$ kG. The\nconcentrations grow approximately linearly in time. The effective magnetic\npressure measured in the simulations is positive near the surface and negative\nin the bulk of the convection zone.

For fiducial stellar wind rates\nwe find that a planetary magnetic field of a few G produces a large\nmagnetospheric cavity, which is typically 6-9 planetary radii in size. A bow\nshock invariably forms ahead of the magnetosphere, but the pre-shock gas is\nonly mildly supersonic (with typical Mach numbers of $\\simeq$1.6-1.8) so the\nshock is weak. This results in a characteristic signature in the ultraviolet\nlight curve: a broad absorption feature that leads the optical transit by\n10-20% in orbital phase. The shapes of our synthetic light-curves are\nconsistent with existing observations of WASP-12b, but the required near-UV\noptical depth ($\\tau \\sim 0.1$) can only be achieved if the shocked gas cools\nrapidly. We further show that radiative cooling is inefficient, so we deem it\nunlikely that a magnetospheric bow shock is responsible for the observed\nnear-UV absorption. Finally, we apply our model to two other well-studied hot\nJupiters (WASP-18b and HD209458b), and suggest that UV observations of more\nmassive short-period planets (such as WASP-18b) will provide a straightforward\ntest to distinguish between different models of circumplanetary absorption. \n\n"}

This class is typically subdivided into three distinct\ntypes of secular resonances: those occurring at the critical inclination, those\ncorresponding to polar orbits, and a third type resulting from a linear\ncombination of the rates of variation of the argument of perigee and the\nlongitude of the ascending node.\n  The model describing the dynamics of space debris includes the effects of the\ngeopotential, as well as the Sun's and Moon's attractions, and it is defined in\nterms of suitable action-angle variables. We consider the system averaged over\nboth the mean anomaly of the debris and those of the Sun and Moon.

Messier 99 Abstract: Mass models of galactic disks traditionally rely on axisymmetric density and\nrotation curves, paradoxically acting as if their most remarkable asymmetric\nfeatures, such as lopsidedness or spiral arms, were not important. In this\narticle, we relax the axisymmetry approximation and introduce a methodology\nthat derives 3D gravitational potentials of disk-like objects and robustly\nestimates the impacts of asymmetries on circular velocities in the disk\nmidplane. Mass distribution models can then be directly fitted to asymmetric\nline-of-sight velocity fields. Applied to the grand-design spiral M99, the new\nstrategy shows that circular velocities are highly nonuniform, particularly in\nthe inner disk of the galaxy, as a natural response to the perturbed\ngravitational potential of luminous matter. A cuspy inner density profile of\ndark matter is found in M99, in the usual case where luminous and dark matter\nshare the same center. The impact of the velocity nonuniformity is to make the\ninner profile less steep, although the density remains cuspy. On another hand,\na model where the halo is core dominated and shifted by 2.2-2.5 kpc from the\nluminous mass center is more appropriate to explain most of the kinematical\nlopsidedness evidenced in the velocity field of M99. However, the gravitational\npotential of luminous baryons is not asymmetric enough to explain the\nkinematical lopsidedness of the innermost regions, irrespective of the density\nshape of dark matter. This discrepancy points out the necessity of an\nadditional dynamical process in these regions: possibly a lopsided distribution\nof dark matter. \n\n"}

Ablation may be performed from afar by illuminating an\nEarth-targeting asteroid or comet with a stand-off \"DE- STAR\" system consisting\nof a large phased-array laser in Earth orbit. Alternatively, a much smaller\nstand-on \"DE-STARLITE\" system may travel alongside the target, slowly\ndeflecting it from nearby over a long period.

Simulated parameters include magnitude, duration and, for\nthe stand-on system, direction of the thrust, as well as the type, size and\norbital characteristics of the target NEO. These simulations indicate that\ndeflection distance is approximately proportional to the magnitude of thrust\nand to the square of the duration of ablation, and is inversely proportional to\nthe mass. Furthermore, deflection distance shows strong dependence on thrust\ndirection with the optimal direction of thrust varying with the duration of\nlaser activity.

It is widely believed that these planets formed near the\nwater-ice line of the protoplanetary disk, and subsequently migrated into much\nsmaller orbits. Most of the proposed migration mechanisms can be classified\neither as disk-driven migration, or as excitation of a very high eccentricity\nfollowed by tidal circularization. In the latter scenario, the giant planet\nthat is destined to become a hot Jupiter spends billions of years on a\nhighly-eccentric orbit, with apastron near the water-ice line. Eventually,\ntidal dissipation at periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbit. If this is\ncorrect, then it should be especially rare for hot Jupiters to be accompanied\nby another giant planet interior to the water-ice line. Using the current\nsample of giant planets discovered with the Doppler technique, we find that hot\nJupiters with P_orb < 10 days are no more or less likely to have exterior\nJupiter-mass companions than longer-period giant planets with P_orb >= 10 days.\nThis result holds for exterior companions both inside and outside of the\napproximate location of the water-ice line.

In this work, we\ndetermine how planet-planet scattering shapes planetary systems around binaries\nas compared to single stars. In particular, we look for signatures that arise\ndue to differences in dynamical evolution in binary systems. We carry out a\nparameter study of N-body scattering simulations for four distinct planet\npopulations around both binary and single stars. While binarity has little\ninfluence on the final system multiplicity or orbital distribution, the\npresence of a binary dramatically effects the means by which planets are lost\nfrom the system.

The planet's\nradius is large (1.4 Rjup), but uncertain owing to the grazing transit (b =\n0.93).

The presence, composition, and geometry of\ncircumstellar matter may hint at the elusive progenitor system of SNe Ia and\ncould also affect the observed reddening law.

Finally, HATS-21 is a V = 12.2 G4V star with [Fe/H] =\n0.300, a mass of 1.080 Msun, and a radius of 1.021 Rsun. Its accompanying\nplanet HATS-21b has a 3.5544-day orbital period, a mass of 0.332 Mjup, and a\nmoderately inflated radius of 1.123 Rjup. With the addition of these three very\ndifferent planets to the growing sample of hot-Saturns, we re-examine the\nrelations between the observed giant planet radii, stellar irradiation, and\nhost metallicity. We find a significant positive correlation between planet\nequilibrium temperature and radius, and a weak negative correlation between\nhost metallicity and radius. To assess the relative influence of various\nphysical parameters on observed planet radii, we train and fit models using\nRandom Forest regression. We find that for hot-Saturns (0.1 < Mp < 0.5 Mjup),\nthe planetary mass and equilibrium temperature play dominant roles in\ndetermining radii. For hot-Jupiters (0.5 < Mp < 2.0 Mjup), the most important\nparameter is equilibrium temperature alone. Finally, for irradiated higher-mass\nplanets (Mp > 2.0 Mjup), we find that equilibrium temperature dominates in\ninfluence, with smaller contributions from planet mass and host metallicity. \n\n"}

High-eccentricity\nmigration involving Lidov-Kozai oscillations of the planet's orbit induced by a\ndistant perturber is a possible channel for producing such misaligned HJ\nsystems. Previous works have shown that the dynamical evolution of the stellar\nspin axis during the high-$e$ migration plays a dominant role in generating the\nobserved spin-orbit misalignment. Numerical studies have also revealed various\npatterns of the evolution of the stellar spin axis leading to the final\nmisalignment. Here we develop an analytic theory to elucidate the evolution of\nspin-orbit misalignment during the Lidov-Kozai migration of planets in stellar\nbinaries. Secular spin-orbit resonances play a key role in the misalignment\nevolution. We include the effects of short-range forces and tidal dissipation,\nand categorize the different possible paths to spin-orbit misalignment as a\nfunction of various physical parameters (e.g. planet mass and stellar rotation\nperiod). We identify five distinct spin-orbit evolution paths and outcomes,\nonly two of which are capable of producing retrograde orbits. We show that\nthese paths to misalignment and the outcomes depend only on two dimensionless\nparameters, which compare the stellar spin precession frequency with the rate\nof change of the planet's orbital axis, and the Lidov-Kozai oscillation\nfrequency. Our analysis reveals a number of novel phenomena for the stellar\nspin evolution, ranging from bifurcation, adiabatic advection, to fully chaotic\nevolution of spin-orbit angles. \n\n"}

We find modest polarization\nlevels ($<$ 1 per cent) for both explosion models. Polarization in the\ncontinuum peaks at $\\sim$ 0.1$-$0.3 per cent and decreases after maximum light,\nin excellent agreement with spectropolarimetric data of normal Type Ia\nsupernovae.

In a\ncompanion paper, we found steady-state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations\nthat are coupled to the CR energy equation for a large cluster sample.

Here we demonstrate that the\npredicted non-thermal emission resulting from hadronic CR interactions in the\nintra-cluster medium exceeds observational radio (and gamma-ray) data in a\nsubsample of clusters that host radio mini halos (RMHs). In contrast, the\npredicted non-thermal emission is well below observational data in cooling\ngalaxy clusters without RMHs.

We aim to construct a method which takes into\naccount how the flaring shape of the scattering surface of an (optically thick)\nprotoplanetary disk projects onto the image plane of the observer. This allows\nus to map physical quantities (scattering radius and scattering angle) onto\nscattered light images and retrieve stellar irradiation corrected (r^2-scaled)\nimages and dust phase functions. We apply the method on archival polarized\nintensity images of the protoplanetary disk around HD 100546 that were obtained\nwith VLT/SPHERE in R'-band and VLT/NACO in H- and Ks-band. The brightest side\nof the r^2-scaled R'-band polarized intensity image of HD 100546 changes from\nthe far to the near side of the disk when a flaring instead of a geometrically\nflat disk surface is used for the r^2-scaling. The decrease in polarized\nsurface brightness in the scattering angle range of ~40-70 deg is likely a\nresult of the dust phase function and degree of polarization which peak in\ndifferent scattering angle regimes. The derived phase functions show part of a\nforward scattering peak which indicates that large, aggregate dust grains\ndominate the scattering opacity in the disk surface. Projection effects of a\nprotoplanetary disk surface need to be taken into account to correctly\ninterpret scattered light images.

The shapes of\nthe arcs suggest that they probably are segments of full rings. Ellipse fitting\nfor the two rings and inner disk yield a disk inclination i = 47 \\pm 2 degrees\nand find semi-major axes of 1.50 \\pm 0.01\" (278 au), 1.06 \\pm 0.01\" (196 au)\nand 0.30 \\pm 0.01\" (56 au), respectively.

We present velocity-resolved aperture-synthesis images reconstructed\nin more than 100 different spectral channels distributed across the Br Gamma\n2.166 micrometer emission line. The intensity distribution of the images\nstrongly depends on wavelength. At wavelengths corresponding to radial\nvelocities of approximately -140 to -376 km/s measured relative to line center,\nthe intensity distribution has a fan-shaped structure.

Abstract: Supermassive stars (SMS; ~ 10^5 M_sun) formed from metal-free gas in the\nearly Universe attract attention as progenitors of supermassive black holes\nobserved at high redshifts. To form SMSs by accretion, central protostars must\naccrete at as high rates as ~ 0.1-1 M_sun/yr. Such protostars have very\nextended structures with bloated envelopes, like super-giant stars, and are\ncalled super-giant protostars (SGPSs). Under the assumption of hydrostatic\nequilibrium, SGPSs have density inverted layers, where the luminosity becomes\nlocally super-Eddington, near the surface. If the envelope matter is allowed to\nflow out, however, a stellar wind could be launched and hinder the accretion\ngrowth of SGPSs before reaching the supermassive regime. We examine whether\nradiation-driven winds are launched from SGPSs by constructing steady and\nspherically symmetric wind solutions. We find that the wind velocity does not\nreach the escape velocity in any case considered. This is because once the\ntemperature falls below ~ 10^4 K, the opacity plummet drastically owing to the\nrecombination of hydrogen and the acceleration ceases suddenly. This indicates\nthat, in realistic non-steady cases, even if outflows are launched from the\nsurface of SGPSs, they would fall back again. Such a \"wind\" does not result in\nnet mass loss and does not prevent the growth of SGPSs. In conclusion, SGPSs\nwill grow to SMSs and eventually collapse to massive BHs of ~ 10^5 M_sun, as\nlong as the rapid accretion is maintained. \n\n"}

This is among the densest spectroscopic coverage, and\nbest-constrained rising lightcurve, for a fast-declining hydrogen-poor SLSN.\nThe bolometric lightcurve can be reproduced with a millisecond magnetar model\nwith ~ 4 M_sol ejecta mass, and the temperature and velocity evolution is also\nsuggestive of a magnetar as the power source. Spectral modelling indicates that\nthe SN ejected ~ 6 M_sol of CO-rich material with a kinetic energy of ~ 7 x\n10^51 erg, and suggests a partially thermalised additional source of luminosity\nbetween -2 d and +22 d. This may be due to interaction with a shell of material\noriginating from pre-explosion mass loss. We further present a detailed\nanalysis of the host galaxy system of LSQ14mo. PESSTO and GROND imaging show\nthree spatially resolved bright regions, and we used the VLT and FORS2 to\nobtain a deep (five-hour exposure) spectra of the SN position and the three\nstar-forming regions, which are at a similar redshift. The FORS spectrum at\n+300 days shows no trace of SN emission lines and we place limits on the\nstrength of [O I] from comparisons with other Ic SNe. The deep spectra provides\na unique chance to investigate spatial variations in the host star-formation\nactivity and metallicity.

For WASP-13, observations have shown that\nthe apparent lack of activity is possibly caused by absorption from the\nintervening ISM. Inspired by this result, we study the effect of ISM absorption\non activity measurements (S and logR'$_{\\rm HK}$ indices) for main-sequence\nlate-type stars. To this end, we employ synthetic stellar photospheric spectra\ncombined with varying amounts of chromospheric emission and ISM absorption. We\npresent the effect of ISM absorption on activity measurements by varying\nseveral instrumental, stellar, and ISM parameters. We find that for relative\nvelocities between the stellar and ISM lines smaller than 30-40 km/s and for\nISM CaII column densities logN$_{\\rm CaII}$>12, the ISM absorption has a\nsignificant influence on activity measurements. Direct measurements and three\ndimensional maps of the Galactic ISM absorption indicate that an ISM CaII\ncolumn density of logN$_{\\rm CaII}$=12 is typically reached by a distance of\nabout 100 pc along most sight lines. In particular, for a Sun-like star lying\nat a distance greater than 100 pc, we expect a depression (bias) in the\nlogR'$_{\\rm HK}$ value larger than 0.05-0.1 dex, about the same size as the\ntypical measurement and calibration uncertainties on this parameter. This work\nshows that the bias introduced by ISM absorption must always be considered when\nmeasuring activity for stars lying beyond 100 pc. We also consider the effect\nof multiple ISM absorption components. We discuss the relevance of this result\nfor exoplanet studies. \n\n"}

Tidal interactions may have played an important role in\nthe evolution of the spin-orbit angle. In this study, we investigate the tidal\ninteractions in spin-orbit misaligned systems. In particular, we focus on the\ntidal response of a rotating fluid body to the obliquity tide, which may be\nimportant for the evolution of the spin-orbit angle but hardly affects the\norbital evolution. The obliquity tide also provides a torque for the mutual\nprecession of the spin and orbital axes around the total angular momentum\nvector, which has not yet been considered in previous studies on the tidal\ninteractions. In this paper, we first formulate a set of linearized equations\ndescribing the tidal response in spin-orbit misaligned systems, taking into\naccount the precessional motion. Numerical solutions in a homogeneous fluid and\nin a polytrope of index 1 show that dissipative inertial waves can be excited\non top of precession by the obliquity tide in the presence of a rigid core. The\ntidal quality factor associated with the obliquity tide $Q'_{210}$ can be\nseveral orders of magnitude smaller than those associated with other tidal\ncomponents if their frequencies fall outside the frequency range of inertial\nwaves. Therefore, it is possible that the spin-orbit misalignment undergoes\nmuch more rapid decay than the orbital decay in hot Jupiter systems owing to\nthe enhanced dissipation of the obliquity tide. \n\n"}

X-ray transits may be the only\nway to detect planets around some systems, while providing a complementary\napproach to optical and/or radio observations in others. Any planets associated\nwith X-ray binaries must be in stable orbits. We consider the range of\nallowable separations and find that orbital periods can be hours or longer,\nwhile transit durations extend upward from about a minute for Earth-radius\nplanets in very close orbits, to hours for Jupiter-radius planets in wider\norbits.

We\nfind three different outcomes for the mass transferred through the Lagrangian\npoint $L_{1}$: (i) self-accretion by the planet, (ii) direct impact on the\nstellar surface, (iii) disk formation around the star. We explore the parameter\nspace of the three different regimes and find that at low eccentricities,\n$e\\lesssim 0.2$, mass overflow leads to disk formation for most systems, while\nfor higher eccentricities or retrograde orbits self-accretion is the only\npossible outcome. We conclude that the assumption often made in previous work\nthat when a planet overflows its Roche lobe it is quickly disrupted and\naccreted by the star is not always valid. \n\n"}

We find that there is a lack of correlation between\n$\\mathcal{M}_X$ and $\\mathcal{M}_R$; this result is an indication that the\nspectral index of the relic is likely not due to the acceleration of particles\noperated by the shock but it is related to the properties of a fossil electrons\npopulation.

The surface abundances of CEMP-s stars are\nthus commonly assumed to reflect the nucleosynthesis output of the first AGB\nstars. We have previously shown that, for this to be the case, some physical\nmechanism must counter atomic diffusion in these nearly fully radiative stars,\nwhich otherwise leads to surface abundance anomalies clearly inconsistent with\nobservations. Here we take into account angular momentum accretion by these\nstars. We compute in detail the evolution of typical CEMP-s stars from the\nZAMS, through the mass accretion, and up the RGB for a wide range of specific\nangular momentum of the accreted material, corresponding to rotation velocities\nbetween about 0.3 and 300 km/s. We find that only for specific angular momentum\nabove 1e+17 cm2/s (rotation velocities above 20 km/s) angular momentum\naccretion directly causes chemical dilution of the accreted material. This\ncould nevertheless be relevant to CEMP-s stars, which are observed to rotate\nmore slowly, if they undergo continuous angular momentum loss akin to\nsolar-like stars. In models with rotation velocities characteristic of CEMP-s\nstars, rotational mixing primarily serves to inhibit atomic diffusion, such\nthat the maximal surface abundance variations (with respect to the composition\nof the accreted material) prior to first dredge-up remain within about 0.4 dex\nwithout thermohaline mixing or about 0.5-1.5 dex with thermohaline mixing. Even\nin models with the lowest rotation velocities (under a km/s), rotational mixing\nis able to severely inhibit atomic diffusion, compared to non-rotating models.\nWe thus conclude that it offers a natural solution to the problem posed by\natomic diffusion and cannot be neglected in models of CEMP-s stars. \n\n"}

They seem to belong to a class of events for\nwhich the fate as a genuine core-collapse supernova or a non-terminal explosion\nis still under debate. Our CMFGEN models suggest that the progenitor of\nSN2015bh had an effective temperature between 8700 and 10000 K, luminosity in\nthe range ~ 1.8-4.74e6 Lsun, contained at least 25% H in mass at the surface,\nand half-solar Fe abundances. The results also show that the progenitor of SN\n2015bh generated an extended wind with a mass-loss rate of ~ 6e-4 to 1.5e-3\nMsun/yr and a velocity of 1000 km/s. We determined that the wind extended to at\nleast 2.57e14 cm and lasted for at least 30 days prior to the observations,\nreleasing 5e-5 Msun into the circumstellar medium. In analogy to 2009ip, we\npropose that this is the material that the explosive ejecta could interact at\nlate epochs, perhaps producing observable signatures that can be probed with\nfuture observations. We conclude that the progenitor of SN 2015bh was most\nlikely a warm luminous blue variable of at least 35 Msun before the explosion.\nConsidering the high wind velocity, we cannot exclude the possibility that the\nprogenitor was a Wolf-Rayet star that inflated just before the 2013 eruption,\nsimilar to HD5980 during its 1994 episode. If the star survived, late-time\nspectroscopy may reveal either a similar LBV or a Wolf-Rayet star, depending on\nthe mass of the H envelope before the explosion.

We take into account the effects of viscosity, which is likely to arise\nin the merger remnant due to magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. As the initial\ncondition, we employ the azimuthally averaged data of the MNS-torus system\nderived in a three-dimensional, numerical-relativity simulation for the binary\nneutron star merger. The viscous effect plays key roles for the remnant\nevolution and mass ejection from it in two phases of the evolution. In the\nfirst $t\\lesssim10$ ms, a differential rotation state of the MNS is changed to\na rigidly rotating state, and as a result, a sound wave, which subsequently\nbecomes a shock wave, is formed in the vicinity of the MNS due to the variation\nof the quasi-equilibrium state of the MNS.

Abstract: Recent sub-millimeter observations show non-axisymmetric brightness\ndistributions with a horseshoe-like morphology for more than a dozen transition\ndisks. The most accepted explanation for the observed asymmetries is the\naccumulation of dust in large-scale vortices. Protoplanetary disks vortices can\nform by the excitation of Rossby-wave instability in the vicinity of a steep\npressure gradient, which can develop at the edges of a giant planet carved gap\nor at the edges of an accretionally inactive zone. We studied the formation and\nevolution of vortices formed in these two distinct scenarios by means of\ntwo-dimensional locally isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We found that the\nvortex formed at the edge of a planetary gap is short-lived, unless the disk is\nnearly inviscid. In contrast, the vortex formed at the outer edge of a dead\nzone is long-lived. The vortex morphology can be significantly different in the\ntwo scenarios: the vortex radial and azimuthal extensions are ~1.5 and ~3.5\ntimes larger for the dead zone edge compared to gap models. In some particular\ncases, the vortex aspect ratios can be similar in the two scenarios, however,\nthe vortex azimuthal extensions can be used to distinguish the vortex formation\nmechanisms. We calculate predictions for vortex observability in the\nsub-millimeter continuum with ALMA. We found that the azimuthal and radial\nextent of brightness asymmetry correlates with vortex formation process, within\nthe limitations of alpha-viscosity prescription. \n\n"}

The cloud scheme with simple microphysics appears as the best\nparametrisation by successfully reproducing the observed photometry and spectra\nof brown dwarfs and young giant exoplanets. In particular, it reproduces the\nL-T transition, due to the condensation of silicate and iron clouds below the\nvisible/near-IR photosphere. It also reproduces the reddening observed for\nlow-gravity objects, due to an increase of cloud optical depth for low gravity.\nIn addition, we found that the cloud greenhouse effect shifts chemical\nequilibriums, increasing the abundances of species stable at high temperature.\nThis effect should significantly contribute to the strong variation of methane\nabundance at the L-T transition and to the methane depletion observed on young\nexoplanets. Finally, we predict the existence of a continuum of brown dwarfs\nand exoplanets for absolute J magnitude=15-18 and J-K color=0-3, due to the\nevolution of the L-T transition with gravity. This self-consistent model\ntherefore provides a general framework to understand the effects of clouds and\nappears well-suited for atmospheric retrievals. \n\n"}

We recover the well-known result that a more\nmassive disc promotes a faster initial growth of the planet eccentricity.\nHowever, at late times the planet eccentricity decreases in the massive disc\ncase, but increases in the light disc case. Both simulations show periodic\neccentricity oscillations superimposed on a growing/decreasing trend and a\nrapid transition between fast and slow pericentre precession. The peculiar and\ncontrasting evolution of the eccentricity of both planet and disc in the two\nsimulations can be understood by invoking a simple toy model where the disc is\ntreated as a second point-like gravitating body, subject to secular\nplanet-planet interaction and eccentricity pumping/damping provided by the\ndisc. We show how the counterintuitive result that the more massive simulation\nproduces a lower planet eccentricity at late times can be understood in terms\nof the different ratios of the disc-to-planet angular momentum in the two\nsimulations.

The effects of convectively driven mixing across convective boundaries\nduring the post He core burning evolution of $25\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$,\nsolar-metallicity, non-rotating stellar models is studied using the MESA\nstellar evolution code.

We use a combination of Eulerian grey\nradiation-hydrodynamics and non-LTE steady-state radiative transfer to study\ntheir dynamical, photometric, and spectroscopic properties.

The spectra at maximum light are\nanalogous to those of standard SNe II-P but bluer. Although the magnetar energy\nis channelled roughly in equal proportion between SN kinetic energy and SN\nluminosity, the latter may be boosted by a factor 10-100 compared to a standard\nSN II. This influence breaks the observed relation between brightness and\nexpansion rate of standard Type II SNe. Magnetar energy injection also delays\nrecombination and may even cause re-ionization, with a reversal in photospheric\ntemperature and velocity. Depositing the magnetar energy in a narrow mass shell\nat the ejecta base leads to the formation of a dense shell at a few 1000km/s,\nwhich causes a light-curve bump at the end of the photospheric phase.\nDepositing this energy over a broad range of mass in the inner ejecta, to mimic\nthe effect of multi-dimensional fluid instabilities, prevents the formation of\na dense shell and produces an earlier-rising and smoother light curve.

The case\n  of electron scattering Abstract: Bow shocks and related density enhancements produced by the winds of massive\nstars moving through the interstellar medium provide important information\nregarding the motions of the stars, the properties of their stellar winds, and\nthe characteristics of the local medium. Since bow shocks are aspherical\nstructures, light scattering within them produces a net polarization signal\neven if the region is spatially unresolved. Scattering opacity arising from\nfree electrons and dust leads to a distribution of polarized intensity across\nthe bow shock structure. That polarization encodes information about the shape,\ncomposition, opacity, density, and ionisation state of the material within the\nstructure. In this paper we use the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SLIP to\ninvestigate the polarization created when photons scatter in a bow shock-shaped\nregion of enhanced density surrounding a stellar source.

The disk in such systems is twisted/warped due to the gravitational\ntorques from the oblate central star and the external companion.

We argue that mass loss by radiation-driven winds mediated by\nline opacity is one of the prime candidates setting the upper-mass limit. We\npresent mass-loss predictions (dM/dt_wind) from Monte Carlo radiative transfer\nmodels for relatively cool (Teff = 15kK) inflated very massive stars (VMS) with\nlarge Eddington Gamma factors in the mass range 100-1000 Msun as a function of\nmetallicity down to 1/100 Z/Zsun. We employ a hydrodynamic version of our Monte\nCarlo method, allowing us to predict the rate of mass loss (dM/dt_wind) and the\nterminal wind velocity (vinf) simultaneously. Interestingly, we find wind\nterminal velocities (vinf) that are low (100-500 km/s) over a wide Z-range, and\nwe propose that the slow winds from VMS are an important source of\nself-enrichment in globular clusters. We also find mass-loss rates\n(dM/dt_wind), exceeding the typical mass-accretion rate (dM/dt_accr) of 0.001\nMsun/yr during massive-star formation. We express our mass-loss predictions as\na function of mass and Z, finding log dM/dt = -9.13 + 2.1 log(M/Msun) + 0.74\nlog(Z/Zsun) (Msun/yr). Even if stellar winds would not directly halt & reverse\nmass accretion during star formation, if the most massive stars form by stellar\nmergers stellar wind mass loss may dominate over the rate at which stellar\ngrowth takes place. We therefore argue that the upper-mass limit is effectively\nZ-dependent due to the nature of radiation-driven winds. This has dramatic\nconsequences for the most luminous supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and other\nblack hole formation scenarios at different Cosmic epochs. \n\n"}

One of the observable\ntests for migration theories is the current value of the angle between the\nstellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane, called the obliquity. After the\nmain migration mechanism has ended, the obliquity and the semi-major axis keep\non evolving due to the combined effects of tides and magnetic braking. The\nobserved correlation between effective temperature and measured projected\nobliquity in known short-period systems has been taken as evidence of such\nmechanisms being at play. Our aim is to produce an improved model for the tidal\nevolution of the obliquity, including all the components of the dynamical tide\nfor circular misaligned systems. This model takes into account the strong\nvariations in structure and rotation of stars during their evolution, and their\nconsequences for the efficiency of tidal dissipation. We use an analytical\nformulation for the frequency-averaged dissipation in convective layers for\neach mode, depending only on global stellar parameters and rotation. For\ntypical hot-Jupiters orbital configurations, the obliquity is generally damped\non a much shorter timescale than the semi-major axis. The final outcome of\ntidal evolution is also very sensitive to the initial conditions, with\nJupiter-mass planets being either quickly destroyed or brought on more distant\norbit, depending on the initial ratio of planetary orbital momentum to stellar\nspin momentum. However we find that everything else being the same, the\nevolution of the obliquity around low-mass stars with a thin convective zone is\nnot slower than around those with a thicker convective zone. On the contrary,\nwe find that more massive stars, remaining faster rotator throughout their\nmain-sequence, produce more efficient dissipation. \n\n"}

While current simulations of terrestrial\naccretion can reproduce many observed qualities of the solar system,\nreplicating the small mass of Mars requires modification to standard planet\nformation models. Here we use 800 dynamical simulations to show that an early\ninstability in the outer solar system strongly influences terrestrial planet\nformation and regularly yields properly sized Mars analogs. Our most successful\noutcomes occur when the terrestrial planets evolve an additional 1-10 million\nyears (Myr) following the dispersal of the gas disk, before the onset of the\ngiant planet instability. In these simulations, accretion has begun in the Mars\nregion before the instability, but the dynamical perturbation induced by the\ngiant planets' scattering removes large embryos from Mars' vicinity. Large\nembryos are either ejected or scattered inward toward Earth and Venus (in some\ncases to deliver water), and Mars is left behind as a stranded embryo.

Some common key elements are identified, indicating potential for\nfruitful exchange across communities. Operational model development is\ncompelling, driven by factors that broadly fall into four categories: model\nskill, basic physics, advances in computer architecture, and new aspects to be\ncovered, from costumer needs over physics to observational data. Evaluation of\nmodel skill as part of the operational chain goes beyond an automated skill\nscore. Permanent interaction between 'pure research' and 'operational forecast'\npeople is beneficial to both sides.

Here, we introduce EPOS, the Exoplanet Population Observation\nSimulator, to estimate the prevalence and orbital architectures of multi-planet\nsystems based on the latest Kepler data release, DR25. We estimate that at\nleast 42% of sun-like stars have nearly coplanar planetary systems with 7 or\nmore exoplanets. The fraction of stars with at least one planet within 1 au\ncould be as high as 100% depending on assumptions about the distribution of\nsingle transiting planets. We estimate an occurrence rate of planets in the\nhabitable zone around sun-like stars of eta_earth=36+-14%.

We use\nprincipal component analysis to construct orthogonal \"eigencurves,\" which we\nthen use to fit published 8 micron observations of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b.\nThis approach has a few advantages over previously used techniques: 1) the\nlightcurves can be pre-computed, accelerating the fitting process, 2) the\neigencurves are orthogonal to each other, reducing parameter correlations, and\n3) the eigencurves are model-independent and are ranked in order of\nsensitivity. One notable result of our analysis is that eclipse-only mapping of\nHD 189733b is far more sensitive to the central concentration of dayside flux\nthan to the eastward offset of that hotspot. Mapping can, in principle, suffer\nfrom degeneracies between spatial patterns and orbital parameters. Previous\nmapping efforts using these data have either assumed a circular orbit and\nprecise inclination, or have been pessimistic about the prospects of eclipse\nmapping in the face of uncertain orbital parameters. We show that for HD\n189733b the combined photometry and radial velocity are sufficiently precise to\nretire this concern. Lastly, we present the first map of brightness\ntemperature, and we quantify the amplitude and longitude offset of the dayside\nhotspot. \n\n"}

We combine observations and\nchemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to\nphysical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived.

The upper limits range between $\\sim 10^{11}$\nand $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical\nmodel matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at $r \\sim\n50-100$ au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets.

The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to\nCS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau\nand points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas. \n\n"}

Assuming that the disc's accretion onto\nthe star is the main process that clears the disc, the atmosphere of the star\nwill show abundance reductions caused by the material accreted by the forming\nplanet(s).

For\nthe formation process of glycine on the grain surface, we obtained consistent\nresults with previous studies that glycine would be formed via the reactions of\nCOOH with CH$_2$NH$_2$. However, we will report three important findings\nregarding the chemical evolution and the detectability of interstellar glycine.\nFirst, with the experimentally obtained binding energy from the temperature\nprogrammed thermal desorption (TPD) experiment, a large proportion of glycine\nwas destroyed through the grain surface reactions with NH or CH$_3$O radicals\nbefore it fully evaporates. As a result, the formation process in the gas phase\nis more important than thermal evaporation from grains. If this is the case,\nNH$_2$OH and CH$_3$COOH rather than CH$_3$NH$_2$ and CH$_2$NH would be the\nessential precursors to the gas phase glycine. Secondly, since the gas phase\nglycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, early\nevolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the\nfuture glycine surveys.

First, the observed drop\nin terminal wind velocity around spectral type B1 is confirmed by the Monte\nCarlo method -- at the correct effective temperature of about 21 000 K. This\ndrop in wind velocity is much steeper than would be expected from the drop in\nescape speed for cooler stars. The results may be particularly relevant for\nslow winds inferred for some High-Mass X-ray binaries. Second, the strength of\nthe mass-loss bi-stability jump is found to be significantly larger than\npreviously assumed. Not only could this make bi-stability braking more\nefficient in massive star evolution, but a rotationally-induced version of the\nbi-stability mechanism may now be capable of producing the correct density of\noutflowing disks around B[e] supergiants, although multi-dimensional modelling\nincluding the disk velocity structure is still needed.

The origin of such\nstructures is in debate. Recently, we documented how one super-Earth planet can\nopen multiple (up to five) dust gaps in a disk with low viscosity\n($\\alpha\\lesssim10^{-4}$). In this paper, we examine how the positions, depths,\nand total number of gaps opened by one planet depend on input parameters, and\napply our results to real systems. Gap locations (equivalently, spacings) are\nthe easiest metric to use when making comparisons between theory and\nobservations, as positions can be robustly measured. We fit the locations of\ngaps empirically as functions of planet mass and disk aspect ratio.

The remaining question is whether\nthese nanoparticles can survive in the dense and hot shocked regions, and how\nto constrain their size and abundance with observations. In this paper, we\npresent a new mechanism to destroy nanoparticles in C-shocks based on\ncentrifugal stress within rapidly spinning nanoparticles spun-up by stochastic\natomic bombardment, which is termed rotational disruption. We find that, due to\nsupersonic neutral gas-charged grain drift in C-shocks, nanoparticles can be\nspun-up to suprathermal rotation by stochastic torques exerted by supersonic\nneutral flow. The resulting centrifugal stress within suprathermally rotating\nnanoparticles can exceed the maximum tensile strength of grain material\n($S_{\\max}$), resulting in rapid disruption of nanoparticles smaller than\n$a\\sim 1$ nm for $S_{\\max}\\sim 10^{9}\\erg\\cm^{-3}$. The proposed disruption\nmechanism is shown to be more efficient than thermal sputtering in controlling\nthe lower cutoff of grain size distribution in C-shocks. We model microwave\nemission from spinning nanoparticles in C-shocks subject to supersonic neutral\ndrift and rotational disruption. We find that suprathermally rotating\nnanoparticles can emit strong microwave radiation, and both peak flux and peak\nfrequency increase with increasing the shock velocity. We suggest spinning dust\nas a new method to constrain nanoparticles and trace shock velocities in dense,\nshocked regions. \n\n"}

Amongst a number of\nmechanisms that can amplify the local density of solids, aerodynamic streaming\ninstability (SI) is one of the most promising.

To develop the method, we focus on a specific\nstatistical property of the intrinsic Gaussian CMB field; a field point in the\nmap that has a larger absolute value of the temperature threshold tends to have\na larger absolute value of the curvature parameter defined by a trace of second\nderivative matrix of the temperature field, while the ellipticity parameter\nsimilarly defined is uniformly distributed independently of the threshold\nbecause of the isotropic nature of the Gaussian field. The weak lensing then\ncauses a stronger distortion effect on the isotemperature contours with higher\nthreshold and especially induces a coherent distribution of the ellipticity\nparameter correlated with the threshold as a result of the coupling between the\nCMB curvature parameter and the gravitational tidal shear in the observed map.\nThese characteristic patterns can be statistically picked up by considering\nthree independent characteristic functions, which are obtained from the\naverages of quadratic combinations of the second derivative fields of CMB over\nisotemperature contours with each threshold.

The information produced by these two types of fits can be used to\nexplore different science goals. Systematic and random fitting errors in all\nstructural parameters as well as bulge and disk colors are carefully\ncharacterized through extensive sets of simulations. The results of these\nsimulations are given in catalogs similar to the real science catalogs so that\nboth real and simulated measurements can be sampled according to the same\nselection criteria to show biases and errors in the science data subset of\ninterest. The effects of asymmetric structures on the recovered bulge+disk\nfitting parameters are also explored through simulations. The full\nmultidimensional photometric survey selection function of the Groth Strip is\nalso computed. This selection function, coupled to bias maps from simulations,\nprovides a complete and objective reproduction of the observational limits, and\nthese limits can be applied to theoretical predictions from galaxy evolution\nmodels for direct comparisons with the data. \n\n"}

Both Bildsten\nand Andersson et al. argued that the r-modes of the neutron star for\nsufficiently quickly rotating and hot neutron stars will grow due to the\nemission of gravitational radiation, thereby accounting for a time varying\nquadrupole component to the neutron star's mass distribution. However, Levin\nlater argued that the equilibrium between spin-up due to accretion and\nspin-down due to gravitational radiation is unstable, because the growth rate\nof the r-modes and consequently the rate of gravitational wave emission is an\nincreasing function of the core temperature of the star. The system executes a\nlimit cycle, spinning up for several million years and spinning down in less\nthan a year. However, the duration of the spin-down portion of the limit cycle\ndepends sensitively on the amplitude at which the nonlinear coupling between\ndifferent r-modes becomes important. As the duration of the spin-down portion\nincreases the fraction of accreting neutron stars which may be emitting\ngravitational radiation increases while the peak flux in gravitational\nradiation decreases. Depending on the distribution of quickly rotating neutron\nstars in the Galaxy and beyond, the number of gravitational emitters detectable\nwith LIGO may be large. \n\n"}

Low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies have exponential surface\nbrightness profiles, yet have slowly rising, nearly solid-body, rotation\ncurves. Because of this, viscous evolution may be inefficient in LSB galaxies:\nthe exponential profiles, instead would give important insight into initial\nconditions for galaxy disk formation.\n  Using star formation laws from the literature, and tuning the efficiency of\nviscous processes to reproduce an exponential stellar profile in Milky Way-type\ngalaxies, I test the role of viscous evolution in LSB galaxies. Under the\nconservative and not unreasonable condition that LSB galaxies are\ngravitationally unstable for at least a part of their lives, I find that it is\nimpossible to rule out a significant role for viscous evolution.

The general structure of the\ncluster follows a NW/SE direction, crossed by a perpendicular high density\n``ridge'' of galaxies in the core region. The northern region of the cluster is\ncharacterized by a lower velocity dispersion as compared to the whole cluster\nvalue; it hosts the BCG and a dynamically bound complex of galaxies, and it is\nassociated to a group detected in X-ray (Arnaud et al 2000). This region could\nbe in pre-merger stage onto the main cluster nearly in the plane of the sky.\nThese results, taken together with the fact that most of the clumps detected on\nthe isodensity maps, as well as the early type galaxies and the brightest ones\nare aligned, suggest that this NW/SE direction is the preferred one for the\nformation of this cluster. The central high dense region shows a lower velocity\nlocation ($73625 ^{+344}_{-350}$ km/s) and significantly higher scale ($1780\n^{+234}_{-142}$ km/s) as compared to the whole cluster values.

We do not find significant\ndifferences in the X-ray spectral shape, in particular no higher X-ray\nabsorption in GRBs without optical transient (dark GRBs) compared to GRBs with\noptical transient (OTGRBs). Rather, we find that the 1.6-10 keV flux of OTGRBs\nis on average about 5 times larger than that of the dark GRBs. A K-S test shows\nthat this difference is significant at 99.8% probability. Under the assumption\nthat dark and OTGRB have similar spectra, this could suggest that the first are\nuncaught in the optical band because they are just faint sources. In order to\ntest this hypothesis, we have determined the optical-to-X ray flux ratios of\nthe sample. OTGRBs show a remarkably narrow distribution of flux ratios, which\ncorresponds to an average optical-to-x spectral index 0.794\\pm 0.054.

The significance of this result is equal to or higher than 2.6 sigma.\nIf this sub-population of dark GRBs were constituted by objects assimilable to\nOTGRBs, they should have shown optical fluxes higher than upper limits actually\nfound.

Dust may introduce a selection bias in surveys which\nare based on magnitude limited QSO samples, leading to an underestimate of\nabsorber number density, n(z). Here we present the results of the second phase\nof the CORALS survey which extends our previous work on z > 1.8 damped Lyman\nalpha systems (DLAs) to search for strong metal line systems (candidate DLAs)\nin the range 0.6 < z < 1.7. We have identified 47 MgII systems with rest frame\nequivalent widths EW(MgII lambda 2796) > 0.3 A in our sample of 75\nradio-selected quasars. Our principal and most robust result is that the n(z)\nof low redshift MgII systems determined for the CORALS survey is in excellent\nagreement with that of optically-selected, magnitude limited QSO samples. The\nstatistically inferred number density of DLAs, n(z)=0.16^+0.08_-0.06, is\nconsistent with other low redshift samples, although the large 1 sigma error\nbars permit up to a factor of 2.5 more DLAs in CORALS. However, confirmation of\nthe DLA candidates, precise evaluation of their n(z) and measurement of their\nHI column densities awaits UV observations with the Hubble Space Telescope.\nFinally, we report an excess of intermediate redshift MgII systems observed\ntowards bright QSOs which could be due to a lensing amplification bias.\nHowever, there is also evidence that this excess could simply be due to more\nsensitive EW detection limits towards brighter QSOs. We also emphasize that\nabsorber statistics determined from magnitude limited surveys reach a steady\nvalue if the completeness limit is significantly fainter than the fiducial\nvalue of the quasar luminosity function.

Our bubbles\nare inflated near the base of the ICM over a finite time interval from a region\nwhose magnetic field is isolated from the ICM. We confirm both the early\nconjecture from linear analysis and the later results based on preformed MHD\nbubbles; namely, that very modest ICM magnetic fields can stabilize the rising\nbubbles against disruption by Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities. We find in addition that amplification of the ambient fields as\nthey stretch around the bubbles can be sufficient to protect the bubbles or\ntheir initial fragments even if the fields are initially much too weak to play\na significant role early in the evolution of the bubbles. Indeed, even with\ninitial fields less than a micro-Gauss and values of $\\beta = P_g/P_b$\napproaching $10^5$, magnetic stresses in our simulations eventually became\nlarge enough to influence the bubble evolution. Magnetic field influence also\ndepends significantly on the geometry of the ICM field and on the topology of\nthe field at the bubble/ICM interface.

We also highligh the almost forgotten fact that Eddington was the first\nphysicist to introduce Special Relativity into the problem and correctly insist\nthat, actually, total energy stored in a star is not the mere Newtonian energy\nbut the total mass energy (E = M c^2). Accordingly, Eddington defined an\n``Einstein Time Scale'' of Evolution where the maximum age of the Sun turned\nout to be t_E = 1.4. 10^{13} yr.

The positions of the multiple images is explained by modelling the\nlight deflection caused by the cluster and the cD-galaxy with elliptical\nisothermal potentials. Since the multiple images are within 8 arcsec around the\ncD galaxy, a cluster core radius - cluster velocity dispersion degeneracy\narises. The cluster velocity dispersion and the core radius are limited to\n540-670 km/s and 5 arcsec - 11\\arcsec, respectively, and the brightness of the\nunlensed counterimage of cB58 is about 23.9 +- 0.3 (R-band), corresponding to a\nmagnification and extinction corrected restframe-B band absolute magnitude of\n-24.75 +- 0.7 mag.

We\nassume that haloes respond adiabatically to disk formation, and that only\nstable disks can correspond to real systems. With these assumptions the\npredicted population can match both present-day disks and the damped Lyman\nalpha absorbers in QSO spectra. Good agreement is found provided: (i) the\nmasses of disks are a few percent of those of their haloes; (ii) the specific\nangular momenta of disks are similar to those of their haloes; (iii)\npresent-day disks were assembled recently (at z<1).

In the\nexpanding phase, spiral bow shocks occur. As in head-on mergers, the electron\ntemperature is significantly lower than the plasma mean one especially in the\npost-shock regions in the expanding phase.

The physical meaning, the properties and the\nconsequences of a discrete scalar field are discussed; limits for the validity\nof a mathematical description of fundamental physics in terms of continuum\nfields are a natural outcome of discrete fields with discrete interactions. Two\ndemarcating points (a near and a far) define a domain where no difference\nbetween the discrete and the standard continuum field formalisms can be\nexperimentally detected. Discrepancies, however, can be observed as a\ncontinuous-interaction is always stronger below the near point and weaker above\nthe far point than a discrete one. The connections between the discrete scalar\nfield and gravity from general relativity are discussed.

This overwhelms any stabilizing effects of tidal\ncoupling [which are proportional to 1/(orbital radius)^6] and causes the stars\nto collapse before they merge. Since the claimed increase of density scales\nwith the stars' mass, it should also show up in a perturbation limit where a\npoint particle of mass $\\mu$ orbits a neutron star. We prove analytically that\nthis does not happen; the neutron star's central density is unaffected by the\ncompanion's presence to linear order in $\\mu/R$.

{"id": "hep-ph/0312267", "contents": "Title: CMB Signals of Neutrino Mass Generation Abstract: We propose signals in the cosmic microwave background to probe the type and\nspectrum of neutrino masses. In theories that have spontaneous breaking of\napproximate lepton flavor symmetries at or below the weak scale, light\npseudo-Goldstone bosons recouple to the cosmic neutrinos after nucleosynthesis\nand affect the acoustic oscillations of the electron-photon fluid during the eV\nera. Deviations from the Standard Model are predicted for both the total energy\ndensity in radiation during this epoch, \\Delta N_nu, and for the multipole of\nthe n'th CMB peak at large n, \\Delta l_n. The latter signal is difficult to\nreproduce other than by scattering of the known neutrinos, and is therefore an\nideal test of our class of theories. In many models, the large shift, \\Delta\nl_n \\approx 8 n_S, depends on the number of neutrino species that scatter via\nthe pseudo-Goldstone boson interaction. This interaction is proportional to the\nneutrino masses, so that the signal reflects the neutrino spectrum. The\nprediction for \\Delta N_nu is highly model dependent, but can be accurately\ncomputed within any given model. It is very sensitive to the number of\npseudo-Goldstone bosons, and therefore to the underlying symmetries of the\nleptons, and is typically in the region of 0.03 < \\Delta N_nu < 1. This signal\nis significantly larger for Majorana neutrinos than for Dirac neutrinos, and,\nlike the scattering signal, varies as the spectrum of neutrinos is changed from\nhierarchical to inverse hierarchical to degenerate. \n\n"}

In particular, we include the constraints coming from the first Main\nInjector Neutrino Oscillation Search (MINOS) data and from the Wilkinson\nMicrowave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) three-year (3y) data, as well as other\nrelevant cosmological data and priors. We find that the largest neutrino\nsquared mass difference is determined with a 15% accuracy (at 2-sigma) after\nadding MINOS to world data.
