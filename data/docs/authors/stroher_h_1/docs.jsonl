We derive approximate formulas for the relevant\noscillation probabilities including NSI, and show how the leading effects can\nbe understood intuitively even without any calculations. We will present a\nclassification of all possible NSI according to their impact on reactor and\nsuperbeam experiments, and it will turn out that these experiments are highly\ncomplementary in terms of their sensitivity to the non-standard parameters.

The\nconstituent degrees of freedom in this dense matter are currently unknown.\nLong-range, forward-backward multiplicity correlations (LRC) are expected to\narise due to multiple partonic interactions. Model independent and dependent\narguments suggest that such correlations are due to multiple partonic\ninteractions. These correlations are predicted in the context of the Dual\nParton Model (DPM). The DPM describes soft partonic processes and\nhadronization. This model indicates that the underlying mechanism creating\nthese long-range multiplicity correlations in the bulk matter is due to\nmultiple partonic interactions.\n  In this thesis, long-range multiplicity correlations have been studied in\nheavy ion (Au+Au and Cu+Cu) and hadron-hadron ({\\it pp}) collisions. The\nbehavior has been studied as a function of pseudorapidity gap ($\\Delta\\eta$)\nabout $\\eta$ = 0, the centrality, atomic number, and incident energy dependence\nof the colliding particles.

Abstract: Motivated by the disagreement between experimental and lattice QCD results on\nthe D_s decay constant we systematically reinvestigate role of leptoquarks in\ncharm meson decays.

While any\ncontributions of the triplet leptoquarks are already excluded, the singlets\ncould only contribute significantly to the D_s --> tau nu width.

According to the AMD, the Be-9 nucleus consists of\ntwo alpha-like clusters with a surrounding neutron. The clustering produces\nhigh-momentum components in nuclear wave functions, which affects nuclear\nmodifications of the structure functions. We investigated whether clustering\nfeatures could appear in the structure function F_2 of Be-9 along with studies\nfor other light nuclei. We found that nuclear modifications of F_2 are similar\nin both AMD and shell models within our simple convolution description although\nthere are slight differences in Be-9.

If nuclear-modification slopes d(F_2^A/F_2^D)/dx are shown by\nthe maximum local densities, the Be-9 anomaly can be explained by the AMD\npicture, namely by the clustering structure, whereas it certainly cannot be\ndescribed in the simple shell model.

A significantly large\n(antiLambda+antiSigma0+1.1*antiSigma-)/antiproton ratio of 3.5 has been\nobserved in the mid-rapidity and low transverse momentum region in central\nAu+Au collisions at the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 4.9 GeV at the\nAlternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS). This is an order of magnitude larger\nthan the values in peripheral Au+Au collisions and p+p collisions at the\ncorresponding energy. By using the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular\nDynamics (UrQMD) transport model, we demonstrate that the observed large ratio\ncan be explained by strong absorption of antiprotons (~99.9%) and antiLambdas\n(~99%) in dense nuclear matter created in central collisions. We find within\nthe model that the initial antiLambda/antiproton ratio, mainly from string\nfragmentation, does not depend on the collision centrality, and is consistent\nwith that observed in p+p collisions. This suggests that the observed large\n(antiLambda+antiSigma0+1.1*antiSigma-)/antiproton ratio at the AGS does not\nnecessarily imply the formation of the QGP.

In the present calculation, we consider\nnot only the tensor coupling of vector mesons to octet baryons and the form\nfactors at interaction vertexes but also the internal (quark) structure change\nof baryons in dense matter. The relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations are\nperformed in two ways: one is the calculation with the coupling constants\ndetermined by SU(6) (quark model) symmetry, the other is with the coupling\nconstants based on SU(3) (flavor) symmetry. For the latter case, we use the\nlatest Nijmegen (ESC08) model. Then, it is very remarkable that the particle\ncomposition of the core matter in SU(3) symmetry is completely different from\nthat in SU(6) symmetry. In SU(6) symmetry, all octet baryons appear in the\ndensity region below $\\sim 1.2$ fm$^{-3}$, while, in the ESC08 model, only the\n\\Xi^- hyperon is produced. Furthermore, the medium modification of the internal\nbaryon structure hardens the equation of state for the core matter.

This centrality\ndependence is not reproduced by HIJING, while AMPT, a model which incorporates\nstrings and parton rescattering, exhibits qualitative agreement with the\nmeasured correlations in $\\Delta\\varphi$ but fails to describe the correlations\nin $\\Delta\\eta$. A thermal blast-wave model incorporating local charge\nconservation and tuned to describe the $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra and v$_2$\nmeasurements reported by ALICE, is used to fit the centrality dependence of the\nwidth of the balance function and to extract the average separation of\nbalancing charges at freeze-out. The comparison of our results with\nmeasurements at lower energies reveals an ordering with $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$:\nthe balance functions become narrower with increasing energy for all\ncentralities. This is consistent with the effect of larger radial flow at the\nLHC energies but also with the late stage creation scenario of balancing\ncharges. However, the relative decrease of the balance function widths in\n$\\Delta\\eta$ and $\\Delta\\varphi$ with centrality from the highest SPS to the\nLHC energy exhibits only small differences. This observation cannot be\ninterpreted solely within the framework where the majority of the charge is\nproduced at a later stage in the evolution of the heavy--ion collision. \n\n"}

In addition, these modes of excitation appear to be\nsensitive to the uncertain density dependence of the symmetry energy. We study\nthe emergence, evolution, and nature of both the soft and giant isoscalar\nmonopole modes as a function of neutron excess in three unstable Nickel\nisotopes: 56Ni, 68Ni, and 78Ni. The distribution of isoscalar monopole strength\nis computed in a relativistic random-phase approximation using several\naccurately calibrated effective interactions. In particular, a non-spectral\nGreen's function approach is adopted that allows for an exact treatment of the\ncontinuum without any reliance on discretization. The discretization of the\ncontinuum is neither required nor admitted. In the case of 56Ni, the lack of\nlow-energy strength results in a direct correlation between the centroid energy\nof the giant monopole resonance and the incompressibility coefficient of\nsymmetric nuclear matter. In contrast, the large neutron excess in both 68Ni\nand 78Ni generates a significant, yet relatively featureless, amount of\nlow-energy strength that is driven by transitions into the continuum. Moreover,\nthe evolution of monopole strength with neutron excess displays sensitivity to\nthe density dependence of the symmetry energy.

The longitudinal correlation of the elliptic\nflow shows a strong centrality dependence while the correlation of the\ntriangular flow is independent of the centrality.

To this end, we introduce a stochastic model of the residual magnetic\nfield within the propagation region which draws on features of magnetic\nprofiles measured during the last free neutron oscillation experiment\n[conducted at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in the 1990's]. We average over\nboth fluctuations in the magnetic field sampled by neutrons, and representative\nspectra of neutron speeds. We find that deviations from the quasi-free result\nfor the antineutron probability do not depend quadratically on $l$ (as a naive\nperturbative estimate would suggest) but increase only linearly with $l$. As\nregards the large spikes in the magnetic field which can be expected at, for\nexample, joints in the magnetic shielding of the propagation region (despite\ncompensating currents and magnetic idealization of the shield), we demonstrate\nthat their effect scales as $l/D^{3/2}$, where $D$ is the diameter of the\ncylindrical magnetic shielding. Our arguments suggest that, provided the\ndimensions of the propagation region are such that the ratio $l/D^{3/2}$ does\nnot exceed the value pertinent to the ILL experiment, and these spikes occur\nclose to either end of the propagation region, they can be neglected. We also\nestablish that any large magnetic field encountered after the propagation\nregion is exited will not diminish the probability for antineutron detection.\nFor the range of values of $l$ of most interest to the ESS experiment, it\nshould suffice to improve on the level of magnetic suppression achieved at the\nILL by a factor of two. \n\n"}

We came to\nthis picture after analyzing the behaviour of the nuclear modification factor\nas a function of $p_T$ for the charged particles produced in the most central\nPb-Pb collisions at 2.76 A TeV. In the interval, $7-50 GeV/c$ the values of the\nfactor as a function of $p_T$ increases almost linearly with a slope is very\nclose to expected one for the inverse Compton effect. Around $p_T\\simeq 60$\nGeV/c, a regime change occurs, which is characteristic for the phenomenon.

While\nTPE is difficult to calculate in a model-independent way, it can be determined\nexperimentally from asymmetries between electron-proton and positron-proton\nscattering.

The CF\nis constrained by centrality selection based on particle multiplicity in a\nreference subevent, and contributes to observables measured in another\nsubevent. Using a Glauber-based independent source model, we study the\ninfluence of CF on several distributions of multiplicity $N$ and eccentricities\n$\\epsilon_n$: $p(N)$, $p(\\epsilon_n)$, $p(\\epsilon_n,\\epsilon_m)$ and\n$p(N,\\epsilon_n)$, where the effects of CF is quantified using multi-particle\ncumulants of these distributions. In mid-central collisions, a general relation\nis established between the multiplicity fluctuation and resulting CF in the\nreference subevent. In ultra-central collisions, where distribution of particle\nproduction sources is strongly distorted, we find these cumulants exhibit rich\nsign-change patterns, due to observable-dependent non-Gaussianity in the\nunderlying distributions. The details of sign-change pattern change with the\nsize of the collision systems. Simultaneous comparison of these different types\ncumulants between model prediction and experimental data can be used to\nconstrain the CF and particle production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions.\nSince the concept of centrality and CF are expected to fluctuate in the\nlongitudinal direction within a single event, we propose to use\npseudorapidity-separated subevent cumulant method to explore the nature of\nintra-event fluctuations of centrality and collective dynamics. The subevent\nmethod can be applied for any bulk observable that is sensitive to centrality,\nand has the potential to separate different mechanisms for multiplicity and\nflow fluctuations happening at different time scales. The forward detector\nupgrades at RHIC and LHC will greatly enhance such studies in the future. \n\n"}

A systematic study of the beam energy dependence is performed for Au+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =2.3 - 62.4$ GeV. The transition of the dynamical\norigin of the directed flow is observed. We find that the initial Glauber type\nnucleon-nucleon collisions generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons at midrapidity\ndue to the presence of spectator matter, and this negative nucleon $v_1$ is\nturned to be positive by the meson-baryon interactions at the beam energy\nregion of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} < 30$ GeV. In contrast, above 30 GeV there is no\nspectator shadowing at midrapidity, and initial nucleon-nucleon collisions do\nnot generate directed flow, but subsequent rescatterings among produced\nparticles generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons.

The not yet measured flux of\n13N, 15O, and 17F neutrinos from the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle is affected\nin rate by the 14N(p,{\\gamma})15O reaction and in emission profile by the\n12C(p,{\\gamma})13N reaction. The nucleosynthetic output of the subsequent phase\nin stellar evolution, helium burning, is controlled by the\n12C({\\alpha},{\\gamma})16O reaction.\n  In order to properly interpret the existing and upcoming solar neutrino data,\nprecise nuclear physics information is needed. For nuclear reactions between\nlight, stable nuclei, the best available technique are experiments with small\nion accelerators in underground, low-background settings. The pioneering work\nin this regard has been done by the LUNA collaboration at Gran Sasso/Italy,\nusing a 0.4 MV accelerator.\n  The present contribution reports on a higher-energy, 5.0 MV, underground\naccelerator in the Felsenkeller underground site in Dresden/Germany.

In turn,\nthe tidal polarizability has been used to impose limits on stellar radii and\nultimately on the equation of state (EOS). The tidal polarizability is also\nsensitive to the second tidal Love number k2. It is the main purpose of this\nwork to perform a detailed study of k2 which, for a given compactness\nparameter, encodes the entire sensitivity of the tidal polarizability to the\nEOS. In particular, we examine the role that the crustal component of the EOS\nplays in the determination of k2. A set of realistic models of the equation of\nstate that yield an accurate description of the properties of finite nuclei and\nsupport neutron stars of two solar masses is used. Given that the tidal\npolarizability scales as the fifth power of the compactness parameter, a\nuniversal relation exists among the tidal polarizability and the compactness\nparameter that is highly insensitive to the underlying EOS. Thus, besides an\nextraction of the tidal polarizabilities, a measurement of the individual\nstellar masses is also required to impact the mass-radius relation. However, we\nobserve a strong sensitivity of k2 to the EOS, particularly to the contribution\nfrom the inner crust. Although by itself the tidal polarizability can not\ncontribute to the determination of the mass-radius relation, future detections\nof binary neutron star mergers are poised to provide significant constraints on\nboth the tidal polarizabilities and masses of the individual stars, and thus\nultimately on the mass-radius relation.

In this approach, the linear Schrodinger equation for\nthe exact many-body wave function is mapped onto a non-linear density-dependent\none-body potential problem. This approximation, not only provides\ncomputationally very simple solutions even for systems with many particles, but\ndue to the non-linearity, it also allows for obtaining solutions that break\nessential symmetries of the system, often connected with phase transitions. In\nthis way, additional correlations are subsumed in the system.

We find that the type of element synthesis varies\ndramatically with the degree of neutrino trapping in the disk and therefore the\naccretion rate of the disk. Disks with relatively high accretion rates such as\n10 M_solar/s can produce very neutron rich nuclei that are found in the r\nprocess. Disks with more moderate accretion rates can produce copious amounts\nof Nickel as well as the light elements such as Lithium and Boron. Disks with\nlower accretion rates such as 0.1 M_solar/s produce large amounts of Nickel as\nwell as some unusual nuclei such as Ti-49, Sc-45, Zn-64, and Mo-92. This wide\narray of potential nucleosynthesis products is due to the varying influence of\nelectron neutrinos and antineutrinos emitted from the disk on the\nneutron-to-proton ratio in the outflow. We use a parameterization for the\noutflow and discuss our results in terms of entropy and outflow acceleration. \n\n"}

Abstract: A future core-collapse supernova in our Galaxy will be detected by several\nneutrino detectors around the world. The neutrinos escape from the supernova\ncore over several seconds from the time of collapse, unlike the electromagnetic\nradiation, emitted from the envelope, which is delayed by a time of order\nhours. In addition, the electromagnetic radiation can be obscured by dust in\nthe intervening interstellar space. The question therefore arises whether a\nsupernova can be located by its neutrinos alone. The early warning of a\nsupernova and its location might allow greatly improved astronomical\nobservations. The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic\nassessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance\nof the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward\nscattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in\nthe presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.\nEven with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to\nbe within circles of radius $5^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ$, respectively. Other\nreactions with more events but weaker angular dependence are much less useful\nfor locating the supernova. Finally, there is the oft-discussed possibility of\ntriangulation, i.e., determination of the supernova direction based on an\narrival time delay between different detectors. Given the expected statistics\nwe show that, contrary to previous estimates, this technique does not allow a\ngood determination of the supernova direction. \n\n"}

We show that such\nLXD-BH formation will be experimentally observable at the LHC by the complete\ndisappearance of all very high $p_t$ ($> 500$ GeV) back-to-back correlated\nDi-Jets of total mass $M > M_f = 1$ TeV. We suggest to complement this clear\ncut-off signal at $M > 2*500$ GeV in the di-jet-correlation function by\ndetecting the subsequent, Hawking-decay products of the LXD-BHs, namely either\nmultiple high energy ($> 100$ GeV) SM Mono-Jets (i.e. away-side jet missing),\nsprayed off the evaporating BHs isentropically into all directions or the\nthermalization of the multiple overlapping Hawking-radiation in a\nHeckler-Kapusta-Plasma.

It is shown that for low\ncollision energies possible nuclear reactions (including deuterium fusion) are\nstrongly boosted by the environment.

Our\nexemplars highlight that much of hadronic physics can be understood as simply a\nmanifestation of the nonperturbative, momentum-dependent dressing of the\nelementary Schwinger functions in QCD. \n\n"}

This is done in two steps. In the first step, I introduce\nthe notion of the Cheshire Cat Principle which describes how a\nstrong-interaction phenomenon can be described in various different languages.\nIn the second step, I treat two cases of widely different density regimes. The\nfirst case deals with formulating nuclear physics of {\\it dilute} nuclear\nsystems with a focus on both bound and scattering processes in two-nucleon\nsystems in terms of effective field theories (EFT), e.g., in the framework of\nchiral perturbation theory. The second case requires formulating effective\nfield theories for {\\it dense} hadronic matter such as heavy nuclei and nuclear\nmatter under normal as well as extreme conditions expected to be encountered in\ncompact stars and in heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energy. The first\ncase is rigorously formulated but the second relies on several assumptions that\nappear to be reasonable but need ultimately to be justified. The Cheshire Cat\nPrinciple is proposed to play an essential role in lending support to the\nlatter development. \n\n"}

The hot\nand dense zone assumes the shape of an ellipsoid which is tilted by an angle\nTheta with respect to the beam axis. If matter is close to the softest point of\nthe equation of state, this ellipsoid expands predominantly orthogonal to the\ndirection given by Theta. This antiflow component is responsible for the\npreviously predicted reduction of the directed transverse momentum around the\nsoftest point of the equation of state. \n\n"}

Both processes alter\nthe ions charged to mass ratio by well defined amounts, creating beams of\nparticles with altered magnetic rigidity. These beams will deposit their energy\nin a localized region of the accelerator, causing localized heating, The size\nof the target region depends on the collider optics. For medium and heavy ions,\nat design luminosity at the Large Hadron Collider, local heating may be more\nthan an order of magnitude higher than expected. This could cause magnet\nquenches if the local cooling is inadequate. The altered-rigidity beams will\nalso produce localized radiation damage.
