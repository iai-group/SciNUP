A significant proportion of the article\nis devoted to the quantitative connection between the entanglement content of\nstates and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation. We discuss\nmatrix-product states, higher-dimensional analogues, and states from\nentanglement renormalization and conclude by highlighting the implications of\narea laws on quantifying the effective degrees of freedom that need to be\nconsidered in simulations. \n\n"}

The\nexperiment is exemplified here by an application of this concept to gravity\nwaves at the surface of an incompressible liquid in a basin of finite height,\nwith particular emphasis on the quantized vortex. We construct a complex wave\nfunction with the height of the fluid in the basin as its square modulus and\nthe velocity potential as its phase.

Using the random phase approximation,\nwe then check this phase diagram by evaluating the static spin susceptibility\nin the paramagnetic state close to the mean-field phase boundaries. The momenta\nfor which the susceptibility is peaked indicate in an unbiased way the actual\nordering vector of the nearby mean-field state. The dominant orbitally resolved\ncontributions to the spin susceptibility are also examined to determine the\norigin of the magnetic instability. We find that the observed stripe magnetic\norder is possible in four of the models, but it is extremely sensitive to the\ndegree of the nesting between the electron and hole Fermi pockets. In the more\nrealistic five-orbital models, this order competes with a strong-coupling\nincommensurate state which appears to be controlled by details of the\nelectronic structure below the Fermi energy.

To understand the effect of\nchirp on the temporal coherence property, two series of experiments are\ninvestigated by introducing different amount of chirp into either the pulsed\npump or individual signal (idler) beam. In the first one, based on spontaneous\nfour wave mixing in a piece of optical fiber, the intensity correlation\nfunction of the filtered individual signal beam, which characterizes the degree\nof temporal coherence, is measured as a function of the chirp of pump. The\nresults demonstrate that the chirp of pump pulses decreases the degree of\ntemporal coherence.

Initially prepared in a metastable paramagnetic state, it may\ntransit to its up or down ferromagnetic state, triggered by its coupling with\nthe tested spin, so that its magnetization acts as a pointer.\n  A detailed solution of the dynamical equations is worked out. Conditions are\nfound, which ensure that the process satisfies the features of ideal\nmeasurements. Various imperfections are discussed, as well as attempts of\nincompatible measurements. The first steps consist in the solution of the\nHamiltonian dynamics for the spin-apparatus density matrix $D(t)$. On a longer\ntime scale, the trend towards equilibrium of the magnet produces a final state\n$D(t_{\\rm f})$ that involves correlations between the system and the\nindications of the pointer, thus ensuring registration. A difficulty lies in a\nquantum ambiguity: There exist many incompatible decompositions of the density\nmatrix $\\scriptD(t_{\\rm f})$.

Two different measures of\nthe impurity contribution to the entanglement have been proposed: the\nimpurity-entanglement-entropy S_{imp} and the negativity N. The first, S_{imp},\nis based on a subtractive procedure where the entanglement-entropy in the\nabsence of the impurity is subtracted from results with the impurity present.\nThe other, N, is the negativity of a part of the system separated from the\nimpurity and the impurity itself. In this paper we compare the two measures and\ndiscuss similarities and differences between them.

Weakly coupling to a quantum probe, however, produces minimal\nback-action, and so enables a weak measurement of the projector of one\nobservable, followed by a projective measurement of a non-commuting observable.\nBy this technique it is possible to empirically measure weak-valued\nprobabilities for all of the values of the observables relevant to a Bell test.\nThe marginals of this joint distribution, which we experimentally determine,\nreproduces all of the observable quantum statistics including a violation of\nthe Bell inequality, which we independently measure. This is possible because\nour distribution, like the weak values for projectors on which it is built, is\nnot constrained to the interval [0, 1]. It was first pointed out by Feynman\nthat, for explaining singlet-state correlations within \"a [local] hidden\nvariable view of nature ... everything works fine if we permit negative\nprobabilities\". However, there are infinitely many such theories. Our method,\ninvolving \"weak-valued probabilities\", singles out a unique set of\nprobabilities, and moreover does so empirically. \n\n"}

Signal fronts can be\nstudied unperturbed and with high precision for much longer times than on\nfinite systems. Entanglement inside the window is naturally small, greatly\nlowering computational effort.

A fundamental\nbound on the ability of a noisy quantum channel to transmit quantum (classical)\ninformation is given by its quantum (classical) capacity.

While all the nucleated phases are\nstable with respect to weak perturbations of each kind, strong perturbations\nare found to result in very different behavior. Anisotropy of the vortices\nstabilizes the strong-pairing like phases, while dimerization can recover the\nunderlying non-Abelian phase.

We reveal submanifolds in parameter space of a basic\nlight-matter interacting system where this duality is promoted to a\nsupersymmetry (SUSY) which remains unbroken.

We first discuss the hydrodynamical properties of\nthe Madelung description in general, and extract a pressure like term from the\nBohm potential. We show that the existence of a pressure gradient force in the\nfluid description does not violate Ehrenfest's theorem since its expectation\nvalue is zero. We also point out that incompressibility of the fluid implies\nconservation of density along a fluid parcel trajectory and in 1D this\nimmediately results in the non-spreading property of wave packets, as the sum\nof Bohm potential and an exterior potential must be either constant or linear\nin space.

The $H_{\\rm\nem}$-term commutes with all matter fields because it does not have any explicit\ndependence on matter fields. As a consequence, $H_{\\rm em}$ cannot generate any\nforces on matter. Since it is precisely this term that generates the vacuum\nenergy of EM field, it follows that the vacuum energy does not generate the\nforces.

In\nthe first half of the thesis, we investigated the quantum pump using the full\ncounting statistics with quantum master equation (FCS-QME) approach. In the\nlatter part of the thesis, we investigated the excess entropy production. The\naverage entropy production is composed of the time integral of the\ninstantaneous steady entropy production rate and the excess entropy production.\nWe define average entropy production rate using the average energy and particle\ncurrents, which are calculated by using the full counting statistics with QME.\nThe excess entropy production is given by a line integral in the control\nparameter space and its integrand is called the Berry-Sinitsyn-Nemenman (BSN)\nvector. In the weakly nonequilibrium regime, we show that BSN vector is\ndescribed by $\\ln \\rho_0^{(-1)}$ and $\\rho_0$ where $\\rho_0$ is the\ninstantaneous steady state of the QME and $\\rho_0^{(-1)}$ is that of the QME\nwhich is given by reversing the sign of the Lamb shift term.

The non-existence of the potential means that the excess entropy\nessentially depends on the path of the modulation. If the system Hamiltonian is\nnon-degenerate or the Lamb shift term is negligible, the excess entropy\nproduction approximately reduces to the difference between the von Neumann\nentropies of the system. We pointed out that the expression of the entropy\nproduction obtained in the classical Markov jump process is different from our\nresult and showed that these are approximately equivalent only in the weakly\nnonequilibrium regime. \n\n"}

It is based on the Gutzwiller\napproximation which gives the renormalization of parameters, t and J, due to\nthe Gutzwiller's projection operator excluding the double occupancies. The\nfinite-range correlations are taken into account compared with the conventional\nGutzwiller approximation where only the on-site expectation values are\nconsidered. It is shown that the essential point of the renormalization is its\nnonlinear dependence on the expectation values of Cooper pairs and\nantiferromagnetic moment. In particular the renormalization factor of J becomes\nanisotropic in the presence of antiferromagnetic moment, i.e., that for the\nz-component is enhanced compared with that for the xy-component. The physical\norigin of this enhancement is identified as the surrounding antiferromagnetic\ncorrelations of a bond.

II: A Concrete\n  Implementation Abstract: The present paper is the companion of [1] in which we proposed a scheme that\ntries to derive the Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on Curved Spacetimes (CST) limit\nfrom background independent Quantum General Relativity (QGR). The constructions\nof [1] make heavy use of the notion of semiclassical states for QGR. In the\npresent paper, we employ the complexifier coherent states for QGR recently\nproposed by Thiemann and Winkler as semiclassical states, and thus fill the\ngeneral formulas obtained in [1] with life. We demonstrate how one can, under\nsome simplifying assumptions, explicitely compute expectation values of the\noperators relevant for the gravity-matter Hamiltonians of [1] in the\ncomplexifier coherent states. These expectation values give rise to effective\nmatter Hamiltonians on the background on which the gravitational coherent state\nis peaked and thus induce approximate notions of n-particle states and matter\npropagation on fluctuating spacetimes. We display the details for the scalar\nand the electromagnetic field. The effective theories exhibit two types of\ncorrections as compared to the the ordinary QFT on CST. The first is due to the\nquantum fluctuations of the gravitational field, the second arises from the\nfact that background independence forces both geometry and matter to propagate\non a spacetime that is the product of the real line and a (random) graph.\nFinally we obtain explicit numerical predictions for non-standard dispersion\nrelations for the scalar and the electromagnetic field. They should, however,\nnot be taken too seriously, due to the many ambiguities in our scheme, the\nanalysis of the physical significance of which has only begun. We show however,\nthat one can classify these ambiguities at least in broad terms. \n\n"}

Although the PDC model is proposed to study the entanglement-based QKD, we\nemphasize that our generic model may also be useful for other non-QKD\nexperiments involving a PDC source. Since an entangled PDC source is a basis\nindependent source, we apply Koashi-Preskill's security analysis to the\nentanglement PDC QKD.
