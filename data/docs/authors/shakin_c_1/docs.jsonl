We\nestablish that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking leads to the self-consistent\ngeneration of components of the quark-gluon vertex forbidden when chiral\nsymmetry is forced to stay in the Wigner-Weyl mode. In the latter case the\nrunning strong coupling assumes an infrared fixed point. If chiral symmetry is\nbroken, either dynamically or explicitely, the running coupling is infrared\ndivergent. Based on a truncation for the quark-gluon vertex Dyson-Schwinger\nequation which respects the analytically determined infrared behavior numerical\nresults for the coupled system of the quark propagator and vertex\nDyson-Schwinger equation are presented. The resulting quark mass function as\nwell as the vertex function show only a very weak dependence on the current\nquark mass in the deep infrared.

While the two-flavor effective models may be sufficient\nto describe the phenomenon of pion condensation, it is interesting to study the\nroles of the strangeness degree of freedom and the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly. In\nthis paper, we present a systematic study of the three-flavor\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model with a Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT) term that\nmimics the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly at finite isospin chemical potential. In the\nmean-field approximation, the model predicts a phase transition from the vacuum\nto the pion superfluid phase, which takes place at $\\mu_{\\rm I}$ equal to the\npion mass $m_\\pi$. Due to the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly, the strangeness degree of\nfreedom couples to the light quark degrees of freedom and the strange quark\neffective mass depends on the pion condensate. However, the strange quark\ncondensate and the strange quark effective mass change slightly in the pion\nsuperfluid phase, which verifies the validity of the two-flavor models. The\neffective four-fermion interaction of the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft term in\nthe presence of the pion condensation is constructed. Due to the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$\nanomaly, the pion condensation generally induces scalar-pseudoscalar\ninteraction. The Bethe-Salpeter equation for the mesonic excitations is\nestablished and the meson mass spectra are obtained at finite isospin chemical\npotential and temperature.

In contrast to the finite temperature effect which suppresses $\\chi$,\nthe isospin density effect leads to an enhancement of $\\chi$. \n\n"}

We employ an approximation scheme where \"one-loop\" diagrams are\ncomputed using fully dressed gluon and ghost propagators, and tree-level\nvertices. When a suitable kinematical configuration depending on a single\nmomentum scale $p$ is chosen, only two structures emerge: the tree-level\nfour-gluon vertex, and a tensor orthogonal to it. A detailed numerical analysis\nreveals that the form factor associated with this latter tensor displays a\nchange of sign (zero-crossing) in the deep infrared, and finally diverges\nlogarithmically. The origin of this characteristic behavior is proven to be\nentirely due to the masslessness of the ghost propagators forming the\ncorresponding ghost-loop diagram, in close analogy to a similar effect\nestablished for the three-gluon vertex. However, in the case at hand, and under\nthe approximations employed, this particular divergence does not affect the\nform factor proportional to the tree-level tensor, which remains finite in the\nentire range of momenta, and deviates moderately from its naive tree-level\nvalue.

We identify two\ncompeting effects: (i) each individual jet widens as it propagates; (ii) the\nopening angle distribution for jets emerging from the plasma within any\nspecified range of energies has been pushed toward smaller angles, comparing to\npp jets with the same energies. The second effect arises because small-angle\njets suffer less energy loss and because jets with a higher initial energy are\nless probable in the ensemble. We illustrate both effects in a simple\ntwo-parameter model, and find that their consequence in sum is that the opening\nangle distribution for jets in any range of energies contains fewer narrow and\nwide jets. Either effect can dominate in the mean opening angle, for not\nunreasonable values of the parameters.

String theory gives rise to\nplausible dark matter candidates due to the breaking of the non--Abelian Grand\nUnified Theory (GUT) symmetries by Wilson lines. The physical spectrum then\ncontains states that do not satisfy the quantisation conditions of the unbroken\nGUT symmetry. Given that the Standard Model states are identified with broken\nGUT representations, and provided that any ensuing symmetry breaking is induced\nby components of GUT states, leaves a remnant discrete symmetry that forbid the\ndecay of the Wilsonian states. A class of such states are obtained in a\nheterotic-string derived $Z^\\prime$ model. The model exploits the spinor-vector\nduality symmetry, observed in the fermionic $Z_2\\times Z_2$ heterotic-string\norbifolds, to generate a $Z^\\prime\\in E_6$ symmetry that may remain unbroken\ndown to low energies.

Using the neutrino\nBoltzmann equation, modified by the Berry curvature term in the momentum space,\nwe establish the violation of the macroscopic neutrino current in plasma after\nEWPT and exactly reproduce the nonconservation of the lepton current in the\nsymmetric phase before EWPT arising in quantum field theory due to the nonzero\nlepton hypercharge and corresponding triangle anomaly in an external\nhypercharge field.

However, uncertainties in transport models (or model\ndependence) partly affect the reliability of the extracted result. In the\npresent work, by using the recently measured data of rapidity-dependent flows,\nwe constrain the incompressibility of nuclear matter and analyse the impact of\nmodel uncertainties on the obtained value. The method is based on the newly\nupdated version of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD)\nmodel in which the Skyrme potential energy-density functional is introduced.\nThree different Skyrme interactions which give different incompressibilities\nvarying from $K_0$=201 to 271 MeV are adopted. The incompressibility is deduced\nfrom the comparison of the UrQMD model simulations and the FOPI data for\nrapidity-dependent elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at beam energies\n0.4\\emph{A} - 1.0\\emph{A} GeV. The elliptic flow $v_2$ as a function of\nrapidity $y_0$ can be well described by a quadratic fit $v_2=v_{20} +\nv_{22}\\cdot y_0^2 $. It is found that the quantity $v_{2n}$ defined by\n$v_{2n}=|v_{20}|+|v_{22}|$ is quite sensitive to the incompressibility $K_0$\nand the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section, but not sensitive to the slope\nparameter $L$ of the nuclear symmetry energy. With the FU3FP4 parametrization\nof the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section, an averaged $K_0 = 220 \\pm\n40$~MeV is extracted from the $v_{2n}$ of free protons and deuterons. However,\nremaining systematic uncertainties, partly related to the choice of in-medium\nnucleon-nucleon cross sections, are of the same magnitude ($\\pm 40$~MeV).\nOverall, the rapidity dependent elliptic flow supports a soft symmetric-matter\nequation-of-state. \n\n"}

We review the recent developments in this field.\nWe demonstrate with a simple quantum-mechanical example that it is a very\nnatural property of quantum systems that a symmetry breaking effect which is\nimportant for the low-lying spectrum of the system, can become unimportant for\nthe highly-lying states; the highly lying states reveal a multiplet structure\nof nearly degenerate states. Using the well established concepts of\nquark-hadron duality, asymptotic freedom in QCD and validity of the operator\nproduct expansion in QCD we show that the spectral densities obtained with the\nlocal currents that are connected to each other via chiral transformations,\nvery high in the spectrum must coincide. Hence effects of spontaneous breaking\nof chiral symmetry in QCD vacuum that are crucially important for the low-lying\nspectra, become irrelevant for the highly-lying states. Then to the extent that\nidentifiable hadronic resonances still exist in the continuum spectrum at high\nexcitations this implies that the highly excited hadrons must fall into\nmultiplets associated with the representations of the chiral group. We\ndemonstrate that this is indeed the case for meson spectra in the large $N_c$\nlimit. All possible parity-chiral multiplets are classified for baryons and it\nis demonstrated that the existing data on highly excited $N$ and $\\Delta$\nstates at masses of 2 GeV and higher is consistent with approximate chiral\nsymmetry restoration.

The main reason\nfor this discrepancy is found to be the large approximations made in converting\nthe dipole cross-sections into structure functions using formulae which are\ndesigned only for asymptotically small x. The shortcomings in this step affect\nthe accuracy of the extracted dipole cross-sections in terms of size and shape,\nand hence also in terms of interpretation, at all scales. \n\n"}

This is achieved with a new\n``valence QCD'' lagrangian where the action in the time direction is modified\nso that the particle and antiparticle decouple. The theory has the vector and\naxial $U(2N_F)$ symmetry in the particle-antiparticle space. Through lattice\nsimulation, it appears that this is dynamically broken down to $U_q(N_F) \\times\nU_{\\bar{q}}(N_F)$. Furthermore, the lattice simulation reveals spin degeneracy\nin the hadron masses and SU(6) relations in the ratios of $F_A/D_A, F_S/D_S$,\nand $\\mu^n/\\mu^p$.

This is a major contribution to the\ndensity-dependence of the effective in-medium force and to saturation.\nLow-momentum effective interactions have been derived by renormalisation\nmethods whereby correlations may be reduced by effectively cutting off high\nmomentum components of the interaction.

The\nrole of the tensor-force, its strength and its effect on correlations is of\nparticular interest.

An infinite number of graphs\nmust be summed, which leads to a cutoff dependence that does not appear in any\norder in perturbation theory.

The reduction of\nthe coupling constant then leads to a smaller contribution from relativistic\nRPA than in the Walecka model.
