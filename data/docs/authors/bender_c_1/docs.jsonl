Because of this cancellation, regulation of the matter field\nzero-point energy density is not needed, and thus does not cause any trace\nanomaly to arise. We exhibit our results in two theories of gravity that are\nwell-defined quantum-mechanically. Both of these theories are locally conformal\ninvariant, quantum Einstein gravity in two dimensions and Weyl-tensor-based\nquantum conformal gravity in four dimensions (a fourth-order derivative quantum\ntheory of the type that Bender and Mannheim have recently shown to be\nghost-free and unitary). Central to our approach is the requirement that any\nand all departures of the geometry from Minkowski are to be brought about by\nquantum mechanics alone.

In this paper we provide conditions that are both\nnecessary and sufficient. We show that $PT$ symmetry of a time-independent\nHamiltonian, or equivalently, reality of the secular equation that determines\nits eigenvalues, is both necessary and sufficient for unitary time evolution.\nFor any $PT$-symmetric Hamiltonian $H$ there always exists an operator $V$ that\nrelates $H$ to its Hermitian adjoint according to $VHV^{-1}=H^{\\dagger}$. When\nthe energy spectrum of $H$ is complete, Hilbert space norms $<\\psi_1|V|\\psi_2>$\nconstructed with this $V$ are always preserved in time. With the energy\neigenvalues of a real secular equation being either real or appearing in\ncomplex conjugate pairs, we thus establish the unitarity of time evolution in\nboth cases. We also establish the unitarity of time evolution for Hamiltonians\nwhose energy spectra are not complete.

Unit invariance is achieved by introducing a gauge\nfield called the scale, designed to measure how unit systems vary from point to\npoint. In fact, by a uniform and simple Weyl invariant coupling of scale and\nmatter fields, we unify massless, massive, and partially massless excitations.\nAs a consequence, masses now dictate the response of physical quantities to\nchanges of scale.

Due to the drag force, dust trapped in vortices will\naccumulate in the center, and diffusion is needed to maintain a steady state\nover the lifetime of the disk.

A brief derivation of the path integral formulation of\nquantum mechanics in its original form using the orthonormal position and\nmomentum basis is reviewed. For spin systems such as single molecule magnets,\nthe formulation of path integral requires the use of non-orthonormal spin\ncoherent state in $(2s+1)$ dimensional Hilbert space, the coordinate\nindependent and the coordinate dependent form of the spin coherent state path\nintegral is derived. These two forms of spin coherent state path integral are\napplied to the tunneling of single molecule magnets through its magnetic\nanisotropy barrier. Most experimental and numerical results are presented. The\nsuppression of tunneling for half-odd integer spin (spin-parity effect) at zero\nmagnetic field is derived from both forms, which shows that this result\n(spin-parity effect) is independent of the coordinate.

This question is important because our universe seems to have\ndone just that! We construct an explicit, simple, example of such a system with\njust two degrees of freedom, of which one achieves `spontaneous\nclassicalization'. It starts from a quantum state and under the usual\nHamiltonian evolution, becomes more and more classical (in a well-defined\nmanner in terms of the Wigner function) as time progresses. This is achieved\nwithout the usual procedures of integrating out a large number of environmental\ndegrees of freedom or conventional decoherence. We consider different ranges of\nparameter space and identify the conditions under which spontaneous\nclassicalization occurs in our model. The mutual interaction between the\nsub-systems of a larger system can indeed drive some of the subsystems to a\nclassical configuration, with a phase space trajectory of evolution.

In the absence of\nstar-disk angular momentum coupling, such disk-tilting would provide a natural\nmechanism for production of primordial spin-orbit misalignments in the\nresulting planetary systems. However, owing to high accretion rates in the\nembedded phase of star formation, the inner edge of the circumstellar disk\nextends down to the stellar surface, resulting in efficient gravitational and\naccretional angular momentum transfer between the star and the disk.

The joint tilting of the star-disk system leads to a stochastic wandering\nof star-aligned bipolar outflows. Such wandering widens the effective opening\nangle of stellar outflows, allowing for more efficient clearing of the\nremainder of the protostar's gaseous envelope.

This is an extension of previous studies of the interaction\nbetween a polarizable atom and a wedge, in which repulsion occurs if the atom\nis sufficiently anisotropic and close enough to the symmetry plane of the\nwedge. A similar repulsion occurs if such an atom passes a thin cylinder or a\nwire. An obvious extension is to compute the interaction between such an atom\nand two facing wedges, which includes as a special case the interaction of an\natom with a conducting screen possessing a slit, or between two parallel wires.\nTo this end we further extend the electromagnetic multiple-scattering formalism\nfor three-body interactions. To test this machinery we reinvestigate the\ninteraction of a polarizable atom between two parallel conducting plates. In\nthat case, three-body effects are shown to be small, and are dominated by\nthree- and four-scattering terms. The atom-wedge calculation is illustrated by\nan analogous scalar situation, described in the Appendix. The wedge-wedge-atom\ngeometry is difficult to analyze because this is a scale-free problem.

I find that all\neight hot Jupiters consistently require carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) below\n0.9. The finding of C/O<0.9 is highly robust for HD209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b,\nHAT-P-1b, and XO-1b. For HD189733b, WASP-17b, and WASP-43b, I find that the\npublished WFC3 transmission spectra favor C/O<0.9 at greater than 95%\nconfidence. I further show that the water abundances on all eight hot Jupiters\nare consistent with solar composition.

These systems are generally known as minisuperspace models. One of\ntheir important key features is the invariance of the corresponding reduced\nactions under reparametrizations of the independent variable, a fact that can\nbe seen as the remnant of the general covariance of the full theory. In the\ncase of a system of $n$ degrees of freedom, described by a Lagrangian quadratic\nin velocities, one can use the lapse by either gauge fixing it or letting it be\ndefined by the constraint and subsequently substitute into the rest of the\nequations. In the first case, the system is solvable for $n$ accelerations and\nthe constraint becomes a restriction among constants. In the second case, the\nsystem can only be solved for $n-1$ accelerations and the \"gauge\" freedom is\ntransferred to the choice of one of the scalar degrees of freedom. In this\npaper, we take the second path and express all $n-1$ scalar degrees of freedom\nin terms of the remaining one, say $q$. By considering these $n-1$ degrees of\nfreedom as arbitrary but given functions of $q$, we manage to extract a two\ndimensional pure gauge system consisting of the lapse $N$ and the arbitrary\n$q$: in a way, we decouple the reparametrization invariance from the rest of\nthe equations of motion. The solution of the corresponding quantum two\ndimensional system is used for the definition of a generalized probability for\nevery configuration $f^i (q)$, be it classical or not. The main result is that,\ninterestingly enough, this probability attains its extrema on the classical\nsolution of the initial $n$-dimensional system. \n\n"}

The reduction ansatz for the eleven-dimensional metric,\nand for some of the components of the 4-form field strength, were found at that\ntime, and recently the complete expression for the 4-form reduction has been\nobtained.

As well-known, the standard GKPW\nprescription, applied to a finite radial cut-off, leads to contact terms in\ncorrelators. de Haro et al (arXiv:hep-th/0002230) introduced bulk counterterms\nto remove these.

The bound is given by the second order shape deformation, in the null\ndirection, of the geometric entanglement entropy of an entangling cut passing\nthrough $x$. Our proof involves a combination of the two independent methods\nthat were used recently to prove the weaker Averaged Null Energy Condition\n(ANEC).

An ideal QPG must \"separate\" the\nselected TM component with unit efficiency, whilst avoiding crosstalk from\northogonal TMs. All attempts at implementing QPGs in pulsed-pump traveling-wave\nsystems have been unable to satisfy both conditions simultaneously. This is due\nto a known selectivity limit in processes that rely on spatio-temporally local,\nnonlinear interactions between pulsed modes traveling at independent group\nvelocities.

Recently, a hydrodynamical description of\nOTOCs has emerged from considering random local circuits, aspects of which are\nconjectured to be universal to ergodic many-body systems, even without\nrandomness. Here we extend this approach to systems with locally conserved\nquantities (e.g., energy).

Here we focus on the case of stress tensor\noperators averaged with a sampling function in time. The Minkowski vacuum state\nis not an eigenstate of the time-averaged operator, but can be expanded in\nterms of its eigenstates. We calculate the probability distribution and the\ncumulative probability distribution for obtaining a given value in a\nmeasurement of the time-averaged operator taken in the vacuum state. In these\ncalculations, we use the normal ordered square of the time derivative of a\nmassless scalar field in Minkowski spacetime as an example of a stress tensor\noperator. We analyze the rate of decrease of the tail of the probability\ndistribution for different temporal sampling functions, such as compactly\nsupported functions and the Lorentzian function. We find that the tails\ndecrease relatively slowly, as exponentials of fractional powers, in agreement\nwith previous work using the moments of the distribution. Our results lead\nadditional support to the conclusion that large vacuum stress tensor\nfluctuations are more probable than large thermal fluctuations, and may have\nobservable effects. \n\n"}

The scattering of\nelectrically neutral particles on such space-times is described by amplitudes\nthat exhibit resonant behaviour when the scattering and deficit angles\ncoincide. This, in turn, leads to ring-like structures where the cross sections\nare formally divergent (\"singular lensing\"). In this work, we revisit this\nparticular phenomenon, with the twofold purpose of placing it in a contemporary\nand more general context, in view of renewed interest in the theory and general\nphenomenology of such defects, and, more importantly, of addressing certain\nsubtleties that appear in the particular computation that leads to the\naforementioned effect.

We find extremely low strengths of around one Pa or less (one\nto five Pa, when scaled to a metre length).

For example, the global phase rotation of a\nsystem of conserved charges can be promoted to a local phase rotation by\ncoupling to an ordinary U(1) vector gauge field. More recently, a class of\nparticles has been studied featuring not only charge conservation, but also\nconservation of higher moments, such as dipole moment, which leads to severe\nrestrictions on the mobility of charges. These particles, called fractons, are\nknown to be intimately connected to symmetric tensor gauge fields. In this\nwork, we show how to derive such tensor gauge theories by applying the gauge\nprinciple to a theory of ungauged fractons. We begin by formulating a field\ntheory for ungauged fractons exhibiting global conservation of charge and\ndipole moment. We show that such fracton field theories have a characteristic\nnon-Gaussian form, reflecting the fact that fractons intrinsically interact\nwith each other even in the absence of a mediating gauge field. We then promote\nthe global higher moment conservation laws to local ones, which requires the\nintroduction of a symmetric tensor gauge field. Finally, we extend these\narguments to other types of subdimensional particles besides fractons. This\nwork offers a possible route to the formulation of non-abelian fracton\ntheories. \n\n"}

If the dyonic black hole is\nperturbed by a light shock wave, a similar feature appears for the switchback\neffect, e.g., it is absent for purely magnetic black holes.

The constructions\nof [1] make heavy use of the notion of semiclassical states for QGR. In the\npresent paper, we employ the complexifier coherent states for QGR recently\nproposed by Thiemann and Winkler as semiclassical states, and thus fill the\ngeneral formulas obtained in [1] with life. We demonstrate how one can, under\nsome simplifying assumptions, explicitely compute expectation values of the\noperators relevant for the gravity-matter Hamiltonians of [1] in the\ncomplexifier coherent states. These expectation values give rise to effective\nmatter Hamiltonians on the background on which the gravitational coherent state\nis peaked and thus induce approximate notions of n-particle states and matter\npropagation on fluctuating spacetimes. We display the details for the scalar\nand the electromagnetic field. The effective theories exhibit two types of\ncorrections as compared to the the ordinary QFT on CST. The first is due to the\nquantum fluctuations of the gravitational field, the second arises from the\nfact that background independence forces both geometry and matter to propagate\non a spacetime that is the product of the real line and a (random) graph.\nFinally we obtain explicit numerical predictions for non-standard dispersion\nrelations for the scalar and the electromagnetic field.

The\nfield-theoretical formulation of general relativity helped us to identify the\nphenomenological seeds of such modifications. They take place in the form of\nvery specific mass-terms, which appear in addition to the field-theoretical\nanalog of the usual Hilbert-Einstein Lagrangian.

The key idea in the construction is physical compression. A physical\ntheory relates quantities. Thus, if we specify a sufficiently large set of\nquantities (this is the compressed set), we can calculate all the others. We\napply three levels of physical compression. First, we apply it locally to\nquantities (actually probabilities) that might be measured in a particular\nregion of spacetime. Then we consider composite regions. We find that there is\na second level of physical compression for the composite region over and above\nthe first level physical compression for the component regions.

Lett. 78 (1997) 2874] that\nthe consistent histories approach allows contrary inferences to be made from\nthe same data. These inferences correspond to projections $P$ and $Q$,\nbelonging to different consistent sets, with the properties that $PQ = QP = 0$\nand $P \\neq 1 -Q$. To many, this seems undesirable in a theory of physical\ninferences. It also raises a specific problem for the consistent histories\nformalism, since that formalism is set up so as to eliminate contradictory\ninferences, i.e. inferences $P$ and $Q$ where $P = 1 - Q$. Yet there seems to\nbe no sensible physical distinction between contradictory and contrary\ninferences.\n  It seems particularly hard to defend the asymmetry, since (i) there is a\nwell-defined quantum histories formalisms which admits both contradictory and\ncontrary inferences, and (ii) there is also a well-defined formalism, based on\nordered consistent sets of histories, which excludes both.\n  In a recent comment, Griffiths and Hartle, while accepting the validity of\nthe examples given in the above paper, restate their own preference for the\nconsistent histories formalism. As this brief reply explains, in so doing, they\nfail to address the arguments made against their approach to quantum theory. \n\n"}

It is\nnatural to identify the size of space S^1 with the scale factor of the\nRobertson-Walker-type metric. This replacement simplifies the construction of a\nclass of effective models to study the Casimir effects. To check the validity\nof this replacement we construct a model for a scalar field coupling to the\ntwo-dimensional gravity and calculate the Casimir effects by the effective\naction for the variable scale factor. Our effective action consists of the\nclassical kinetic term of the mirror separation and the quantum correction\nderived by the path-integral method.

Assuming a frequency cutoff, our results are in agreement\nwith those recently obtained by Barton [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 32(1999)525]. \n\n"}

II: Finite Volume Effects Abstract: In a companion paper [quant-ph/9904013] we have investigated several\nvariations of Schwinger's proposed mechanism for sonoluminescence. We\ndemonstrated that any realistic version of Schwinger's mechanism must depend on\nextremely rapid (femtosecond) changes in refractive index, and discussed ways\nin which this might be physically plausible. To keep that discussion tractable,\nthe technical computations in that paper were limited to the case of a\nhomogeneous dielectric medium. In this paper we investigate the additional\ncomplications introduced by finite-volume effects. The basic physical scenario\nremains the same, but we now deal with finite spherical bubbles, and so must\ndecompose the electromagnetic field into Spherical Harmonics and Bessel\nfunctions. We demonstrate how to set up the formalism for calculating Bogolubov\ncoefficients in the sudden approximation, and show that we qualitatively retain\nthe results previously obtained using the homogeneous-dielectric (infinite\nvolume) approximation. \n\n"}

Compatibility of these reductions with the MR\nfermionic isospectral flows is achieved via appropriate modification of the\nlatter preserving their (anti-)commutation algebra.
