On this view, Bell's theorem supports the\northodox Copenhagen interpretation. Bell's own view of his theorem, however,\nwas quite different.

High obliquity planets have severe climates, with large amplitude\nseasonal variations, but they are not necessarily more prone to global snowball\ntransitions than low obliquity planets.

For example\nboth $L_1=\\dot{q}^2$ and $L_2=e^\\dot{q}$ are suitable Lagrangians on a\nclassical level ($\\delta L_1=0=\\delta L_2$), but quantum mechanically they are\ndiverse. This paper presents a simple rearrangement of the path integral to a\nsurface functional integral. It is shown that the surface functional integral\nformulation gives transition probability amplitude which is free of any\nLagrangian/Hamiltonian and requires just the underlying classical equations of\nmotion. A simple example examining the functionality of the proposed method is\nconsidered. \n\n"}

We have found an exact expression for the spectrum of these\nfluctuations in a statistically homogeneous dielectric.

This requires equilibrium between the\ntemperature-dependent rate of greenhouse-gas consumption by weathering,and\ngreenhouse-gas resupply by other processes. Detected small-radius exoplanets,\nand anticipated M-dwarf HZ rocky planets, are expected to be tidally locked. We\ninvestigate two feedbacks that can destabilize climate on tidally-locked\nplanets. (1) If small changes in pressure alter the temperature distribution\nacross a planet's surface such that the weathering rate increases when the\npressure decreases, a positive feedback occurs involving increasing weathering\nrate near the substellar point, decreasing pressure, and increasing substellar\nsurface temperature. (2) When decreases in pressure increase the surface area\nabove the melting point (through reduced advective cooling of the substellar\npoint), and the corresponding increase in volume of liquid causes net\ndissolution of the atmosphere, a further decrease in pressure occurs. We use an\nidealized energy balance model to map out the conditions under which these\ninstabilities may occur. The weathering runaway can shrink the habitable zone,\nand cause geologically rapid 10^3-fold pressure shifts within the HZ. Mars may\nhave undergone a weathering runaway in the past.

RHESSI has detected a high coronal hard X-ray source that is filled\nwith accelerated electrons whose energy density is comparable to the\nmagnetic-field energy density. This suggests an efficient conversion of energy,\npreviously stored in the magnetic field, into the bulk acceleration of\nelectrons.

A Review Abstract: Schr\\\"{o}dinger (Nature, v.169, 538 (1952)) noted that the complex matter\nfield in the Klein-Gordon equation can be made real by a gauge transform,\nalthough charged fields are believed to require complex functions.\nSurprisingly, the result can be extended to the Dirac equation: three complex\ncomponents of the Dirac spinor function can be algebraically eliminated, and\nthe remaining component can be made real by a gauge transform. Therefore, the\nDirac equation is generally equivalent to one fourth-order partial differential\nequation for one real function (A. Akhmeteli, J. Math. Phys. v.52, 082303\n(2011)). These results both belong in textbooks and can be used for development\nof new efficient methods of quantum chemistry. The matter field can be\nalgebraically eliminated both in scalar electrodynamics and in spinor\nelectrodynamics in a certain gauge. The resulting equations describe\nindependent dynamics of the electromagnetic field, which permits mathematical\nsimplification and can be useful for interpretation of quantum theory. For\nexample, in the Bohm interpretation, the electromagnetic field can replace the\nwave function as the guiding field. It is also shown that for these equations,\ngeneralized Carleman embedding generates systems of linear equations in the\nHilbert space, which look like second-quantized theories and are equivalent to\nthe original nonlinear systems on the set of solutions of the latter. Thus, the\nrelevant local realistic models can be embedded into quantum field theories.\nThese models are equivalent to scalar electrodynamics and spinor\nelectrodynamics, so they correctly describe a large body of experimental data.\nAlthough they may need some modifications for better agreement with\nexperiments, they may be of great interest as \"no drama quantum theories\", as\nsimple (in principle) as classical electrodynamics.

With the assumption of Saha equilibrium, the variation in\ntemperature is the main driver of the variations in the electrical\nconductivity, induced current and Ohmic power dissipated. Atmospheres\npossessing temperature inversions tend to dissipate most of the Ohmic power\nsuperficially, at high altitudes, whereas those without temperature inversions\nare capable of greater dissipation deeper down. Scattering in the optical range\nof wavelengths tends to cool the lower atmosphere, thus reducing the degree of\ndissipation at depth.

To achieve $|<B>|\\leq 2$ uniquely,\none needs to impose a linearity requirement on the hidden variables model,\nwhich in turn adds a von Neumann-type stricture. It is then shown that the\nlocal model is converted to a factored product of two non-contextual $d=2$\nhidden variables models. This factored product implies pure separable quantum\nstates and satisfies $|<B>|\\leq 2$, but no more a proper hidden variables model\nin $d=4$. The conventional CHSH inequality $|<B>|\\leq 2$ thus characterizes the\npure separable quantum mechanical states but does not test the model of local\nhidden variables in $d=4$, to be consistent with Gleason's theorem which\nexcludes non-contextual models in $d=4$.

The observable values can be expressed in terms of\npermutation invariants. We also show that for the description of quantum\nphenomena, instead of a nonconstructive number system --- the field of complex\nnumbers, it is enough to use cyclotomic fields --- the minimal extentions of\nnatural numbers suitable for quantum mechanics. Finite groups of symmetries\nplay a central role in this article. The interest in such groups has an\nadditional motivation in physics.

The criterion of vanishing quantum\ndiscord is related to the notion of reduction and, surprisingly, the\nhidden-variable model in $d=2$, which has been believed to be consistent so\nfar, is in fact inconsistent and excluded by the analysis of conditional\nmeasurement and reduction. The description of the full contents of quantum\ndiscord by the deterministic hidden-variables models is not possible. We also\nre-examine CHSH inequality. It is shown that the well-known prediction of CHSH\ninequality $|B|\\leq 2$ for the CHSH operator $B$ introduced by Cirel'son is not\nunique. This non-uniqueness arises from the failure of linearity condition in\nthe non-contextual hidden-variables model in $d=4$ used by Bell and CHSH, in\nagreement with Gleason's theorem which excludes $d=4$ non-contextual\nhidden-variables models.

At high level density where the resonance states overlap, the\ndynamics of the system is determined by exceptional points.

The general framework for the\nthermodynamical and mechanical processes is based on conservation laws while\nthe vorticity self-organization needs a variational approach. It is difficult\nto estimate to what extent the vorticity self-organization (a purely kinematic\nprocess) have influenced the characteristics of the tropical cyclone at\nstationarity. If this influence is substantial it is expected that the\nstationary state of the tropical cyclone has the same nature as the vortices of\nmany other systems in nature: ideal (Euler) fluids, superconductors, Bose -\nEinstein condensate, cosmic strings, etc.\n  In previous works we have formulated a description of the $2D$ vorticity\nself-organization in terms of a classical field theory.

The\nprediction skill is measured by a summary index of the ROC curve that relates\nthe hit- and false alarm rates. Our results for the examined systems suggest\nthat exceedances of higher thresholds are more predictable; or in other words:\nrare large magnitude, i.e., extreme, events are more predictable than frequent\ntypical events. We find this to hold provided that the bin size for binning\ntime series data is optimized, but not necessarily otherwise. This can be\nviewed as a confirmation of a counterintuitive (and seemingly contrafactual)\nstatement that was previously formulated for more simple autoregressive\nstochastic processes.

It is well-known that dynamics of\natmospheric CO2 is governed by multiple time-constants, and here we approximate\nthe solutions to a linear model of atmospheric CO2 dynamics with four\ntime-constants to identify factors governing the time-delay between peaks in\nCO2 emissions and concentrations, and therefore the timing of the concentration\npeak. The main factor affecting this time-delay is the ratio of the rate of\nchange of emissions during its increasing and decreasing phases. If this ratio\nis large in magnitude then the time-delay between peak emissions and\nconcentrations is large. Therefore it is important to limit the magnitude of\nthis ratio through mitigation, in order to achieve an early peak in CO2\nconcentrations. This can be achieved with an early global emissions peak,\ncombined with rapid decarbonization of economic activity, because the delay\nbetween peak emissions and concentrations is affected by the time-scale with\nwhich decarbonization occurs. Of course, for limiting the magnitude of peak\nconcentrations it is also important to limit the magnitude of emissions\nthroughout its trajectory, but that aspect has been studied elsewhere and is\nnot examined here.

We developed a score function that can be calculated from a\nnumber of readouts much smaller than the number of readouts required to find\nthe desired solution. We show how this performance estimator can be used to\nguide, for example, the selection of the optimal gauges out of a pool of random\ngauge candidates and how to select the values of parameters for which we have\nno a priori knowledge of the optimal value. For the latter, we illustrate the\nconcept by applying the score function to set the strength of the parameter\nintended to enforce the embedding of the logical graph into the hardware\narchitecture, a challenge frequently encountered in the implementation of\nreal-world problem instances. Since the harder the problem instances, the more\nuseful the strategies proposed in this work are, we expect the programming\nstrategies proposed to significantly reduce the time of future benchmark\nstudies and in help finding the solution of hard-to-solve real-world\napplications implemented in the next generation of quantum annealing devices. \n\n"}

Elements of base sets of number structures, considered by\nthemselves, have no meaning. They acquire meaning or value as elements of a\nnumber structure. Fiber bundles over a space or space time manifold, M, are\ndescribed. The fiber consists of a collection of many real or complex number\nstructures and vector space structures.

Indeed,\neven defining appropriate notions of multipartite entanglement is a significant\nchallenge for general quantum systems. In this work, we initiate the study of\nmultipartite entanglement in a rich, yet tractable class of quantum states\ncalled stabilizer tensor networks. We demonstrate that, for generic stabilizer\ntensor networks, the geometry of the tensor network informs the multipartite\nentanglement structure of the state. In particular, we show that the average\nnumber of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) triples that can be extracted from\na stabilizer tensor network is small, implying that tripartite entanglement is\nscarce. This, in turn, restricts the higher-partite entanglement structure of\nthe states.

When the CMI is zero, we find that the\nchannel has a special normal form consisting of local channels between\nindividual inputs and outputs.

Explaining the formation of jets in stratified turbulence is a\nfundamental problem in geophysical fluid dynamics. Statistical state dynamics\n(SSD) provides powerful methods for analyzing turbulent systems exhibiting\nemergent organization, such as banded jets. In SSD, dynamical equations are\nwritten directly for the evolution of the turbulence statistics, enabling\ndirect analysis of the statistical interactions between the incoherent\ncomponent of the turbulence and the coherent large-scale structure component\nthat underlie jet formation. A second-order closure of SSD, known as S3T, has\npreviously been applied to show that meridionally banded jets emerge in\nbarotropic beta-plane turbulence via a statistical instability referred to as\nthe zonostrophic instability. Two-dimensional Boussinesq turbulence provides a\nsimple model of non-rotating stratified turbulence analogous to the beta-plane\nmodel of planetary turbulence.

[Nature 551, 579 (2017)] resulted in the observation of unusual\nrevivals in the many-body quantum dynamics. In our previous work\n[arXiv:1711.03528] such dynamics was attributed to the existence of \"quantum\nscarred\" eigenstates in the many-body spectrum of the experimentally realized\nmodel. Here we present a detailed study of the eigenstate properties of the\nsame model. We find that the majority of the eigenstates exhibit anomalous\nthermalization: the observable expectation values converge to their Gibbs\nensemble values, but parametrically slower compared to the predictions of the\neigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Amidst the thermalizing spectrum,\nwe identify non-ergodic eigenstates that strongly violate the ETH, whose number\ngrows polynomially with system size. Previously, the same eigenstates were\nidentified via large overlaps with certain product states, and were used to\nexplain the revivals observed in experiment. Here we find that these\neigenstates, in addition to highly atypical expectation values of local\nobservables, also exhibit sub-thermal entanglement entropy that scales\nlogarithmically with the system size. Moreover, we identify an additional class\nof quantum scarred eigenstates, and discuss their manifestations in the\ndynamics starting from initial product states. We use forward scattering\napproximation to describe the structure and physical properties of\nquantum-scarred eigenstates. Finally, we discuss the stability of quantum scars\nto various perturbations. We observe that quantum scars remain robust when the\nintroduced perturbation is compatible with the forward scattering\napproximation. In contrast, the perturbations which most efficiently destroy\nquantum scars also lead to the restoration of \"canonical\" thermalization. \n\n"}

There are therefore two frequencies characterizing the system:\nthe usual cyclotron frequency $\\omega_c$ corresponding to motion along the x-y\nplane and associated with Landau levels and a second frequency $\\omega_z$ for\nmotion along the z-direction. Most importantly, when the ratio\n$W=\\omega_c/\\omega_z$ is a rational number, the degeneracy of the energy levels\ndoes not remain always constant as the energy increases.
