Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach.

TFA has been applied successfully in planetary\ntransit searches, where weak, short-lasting periodic dimmings are sought in the\npresence of noise and various systematics (due to, e.g., imperfect flat\nfielding, crowding, etc). These latter effects introduce colored noise in the\nphotometric time series that can lead to a complete miss of the signal. By\nusing a large number of available photometric time series of a given field, TFA\nutilizes the fact that the same types of systematics appear in several/many\ntime series of the same field. As a result, we fit each target time series by a\n(least-square-sense) optimum linear combination of templates and\nfrequency-analyze the residuals.

Gaussian\n  fluctuations with non-markovian dependence on the smoothing scale Abstract: A classic method for computing the mass function of dark matter halos is\nprovided by excursion set theory, where density perturbations evolve\nstochastically with the smoothing scale, and the problem of computing the\nprobability of halo formation is mapped into the so-called first-passage time\nproblem in the presence of a barrier. While the full dynamical complexity of\nhalo formation can only be revealed through N-body simulations, excursion set\ntheory provides a simple analytic framework for understanding various aspects\nof this complex process. In this series of paper we propose improvements of\nboth technical and conceptual aspects of excursion set theory, and we explore\nup to which point the method can reproduce quantitatively the data from N-body\nsimulations. In paper I of the series we show how to derive excursion set\ntheory from a path integral formulation. This allows us both to derive\nrigorously the absorbing barrier boundary condition, that in the usual\nformulation is just postulated, and to deal analytically with the non-markovian\nnature of the random walk.

We develop a general formalism for\nevaluating perturbatively these non-markovian corrections, and in this paper we\nperform explicitly the computation of the halo mass function for gaussian\nfluctuations, to first order in the non-markovian corrections due to the use of\na tophat filter in coordinate space. \n\n"}

We argue that in principle it would\nbe better to fit the foregrounds non-parametrically - allowing the data to\ndetermine their shape - rather than selecting some functional form in advance\nand then fitting its parameters.

We use the insights gained in this model to draw\nreliable conclusions regarding more realistic models.

This is the first spatially-extended Lya+HeII emitter observed and\nthe lowest redshift Lya blob yet found. Strong Lya and HeII-1640 emission in\nthe absence of metal lines has been proposed as a unique observational\nsignature of primordial galaxy formation (e.g., from gravitational cooling\nradiation or Population III star formation), but no convincing examples of\nspatially-extended Lya+HeII emitters have surfaced either in Lya-emitting\ngalaxy surveys at high redshifts (z > 4) or in studies of Lya nebulae at lower\nredshifts. From comparisons with photoionization models, we find that the\nobserved line ratios in this nebula are consistent with low metallicity gas (Z\n< 10^-2 - 10^-3 Z_sun), but that this conclusion depends on the unknown\nionization parameter of the system. The large HeII equivalent width (~37+/-10A)\nand the large HeII/Lya ratio (0.12+/-0.04) suggest that the cloud is being\nilluminated by a hard ionizing continuum, either an AGN or very low metallicity\nstars, or perhaps powered by gravitational cooling radiation. Thus far there is\nno obvious sign of a powerful AGN in or near the system, so in order to power\nthe nebula while remaining hidden from view even in the mid-infrared, the AGN\nwould need to be heavily obscured. Despite the strong Lya+HeII emission, it is\nnot yet clear what is the dominant power source for this nebula. The system\ntherefore serves as an instructive example of how the complexities of true\nastrophysical sources will complicate matters when attempting to use a strong\nLya+HeII signature as a unique tracer of primordial galaxy formation. \n\n"}

MOND, indeed, predicts a quasi-universal value of this quantity\nfor objects of all masses and of any internal structure, provided they are\nmostly in the Newtonian regime; i.e., that their mean acceleration is at or\nabove a0. The predicted value is qSm, with Sm= a0/2 pi G= 138 solar masses per\nsquare parsec for the nominal value of a0, and q a constant of order 1 that\ndepends only on the form of the MOND interpolating function. This gives in the\nabove units log(Sm)=2.14, which is consistent with that found by Doanato et al.\nof 2.15+-0.2. MOND predicts, on the other hand, that this quasi-universal value\nis not shared by objects with much lower mean accelerations. It permits halo\ncentral surface densities that are arbitrarily small, if the mean acceleration\ninside the object is small enough. However, for such low-surface-density\nobjects, MOND predicts a halo surface density that scales as the square root of\nthe baryonic one, and so the range of the former is much compressed relative to\nthe latter. This explains, in part, the finding of Donato et al. that the\nuniversal value applies to low acceleration systems as well. Looking at\nliterature results for a number of the lowest surface-density disk galaxies\nwith rotation-curve analysis, I find that, indeed, their halo surface densities\nare systematically lower then the above \"universal\" value. The prediction of Sm\nas an upper limit, and accumulation value, of halo central surface densities,\npertains, unlike most other MOND predictions, to a pure \"halo\" property, not to\na relation between baryonic and \"dark matter\" properties. \n\n"}

The\nvelocity scale of thermal broadening and the Hubble flow across the gas Jeans\nscale are of similar magnitude (Hlambda_J ~ sigma_th). To separate the effects\nof gas pressure support and thermal broadening on the Lya forest, we compare\nspectra extracted from two smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations\nevolved with different photoionization heating rates (and thus different Jeans\nscales), imposing different temperature-density relations on the evolved\nparticle distributions. The turnover scales in the flux power spectrum and flux\nautocorrelation function are determined mainly by thermal broadening rather\nthan pressure. However, the insensitivity to pressure arises partly from a\ncancellation effect with a sloped temperature-density relation (T ~ rho^{0.6}\nin our simulations): the high density peaks in the colder, lower pressure\nsimulation are less smoothed by pressure support than in the hotter simulation,\nand it is this higher density gas that experiences the strongest thermal\nbroadening. Changes in thermal broadening and pressure support have comparably\nimportant effects on the flux probability distribution (PDF), which responds\ndirectly to the gas overdensity distribution rather than the scale on which it\nis smooth. Tests on a lower resolution simulation show that our statistical\nresults are converged even at this lower resolution.

Such a large instantaneous inflow\ncannot have persisted over a Hubble time. The central constant-entropy\ntemperature peak recently observed in the innermost 150 parsecs is explained by\ncompressive heating as gas flows toward the central massive black hole. Since\nthe cooling time of this gas is only a few million years, NGC 4649 provides the\nmost acutely concentrated known example of the cooling flow problem in which\nthe time-integrated apparent mass that has flowed into the galactic core\nexceeds the total mass observed there. This paradox can be resolved by\nintermittent outflows of energy or mass driven by accretion energy released\nnear the black hole.

Most attempts to compile isolated galaxy lists were\nmarginally successful--too small number and not very isolated galaxies. If\nreally isolated galaxies do exist then their value becomes obvious in a\nUniverse where effects of interactions and environment (i.e. nurture) are\nimportant. They provide a means for better quantifying effects of nurture. The\nCatalog of Isolated Galaxies (CIG) compiled by Valentina Karachentseva appeared\nnear the beginning of the review period.

To achieve this, they will analyse huge\ndatasets, involving years worth of time-ordered data (TOD) from massively\nmulti-detector focal planes. This creates the need for fast and precise methods\nto complement the M-L approach in analysis pipelines. In this paper, we\ninvestigate fast map-making methods as applied to long duration, massively\nmulti-detector, ground-based experiments, in the context of the search for\nB-modes. We focus on two alternative map-making approaches: destriping and TOD\nfiltering, comparing their performance on simulated multi-detector polarisation\ndata. We have written an optimised, parallel destriping code, the DEStriping\nCARTographer DESCART, that is generalised for massive focal planes, including\nthe potential effect of cross-correlated TOD 1/f noise. We also determine the\nscaling of computing time for destriping as applied to a simulated full-season\ndata-set for a realistic experiment. We find that destriping can out-perform\nfiltering in estimating both the large-scale E and B-mode angular power\nspectra. In particular, filtering can produce significant spurious B-mode power\nvia EB mixing. Whilst this can be removed, it contributes to the variance of\nB-mode bandpower estimates at scales near the primordial B-mode peak. For the\nexperimental configuration we simulate, this has an effect on the possible\ndetection significance for primordial B-modes.

The results obtained should be of interest\nfor a correct interpretation of many phase-referenced observations with VLBI.\n  Methods: We observed a set of 13 strong sources (the S5 polar cap sample) at\n8.4 and 15 GHz in phase-reference mode, with 32 different calibrator/target\ncombinations spanning angular separations between 1.5 and 20.5 degrees.

The\nsame analysis also shows that the stellar content of clusters and groups\ndisplays an intrinsic spread at a given cluster mass, i.e. clusters are not\nsimilar each other in the amount of stars they contain, not even at a fixed\ncluster mass.

The intrinsic scatter at a fixed cluster mass we determine for\ngas mass fractions is smaller, 0.06+/-0.01 dex. The intrinsic scatter in both\nthe stellar and gas mass fractions is a distinctive signature that the regions\nfrom which clusters and groups collected matter, a few tens of Mpc, are yet not\nrepresentative, in terms of gas and baryon content, of the mean matter content\nof the Universe.

The mass range of WR\nstars that shed their H envelopes via their own mass loss accounts for less\nthan half the observed fraction of SNeIbc. Progenitors of SNeIbc must extend to\na much lower range of initial masses than classical WR stars, and we argue that\nmost SNIbc and SNIIb progenitors must arise from binary Roche-lobe overflow.\nSNeIc still trace higher mass and metallicity, because line-driven winds in the\nWR stage remove the He layer and propel the transition from SNIb to Ic.

We find that globally, these tracers of\nstar formation give a range of results of ~6-11\\msun/yr, with the\ndust-corrected FUV giving the highest value of SFR. We can reconcile the UV and\nIR-based estimates by adopting a steeper UV extinction curve that lies in\nbetween the starburst (Calzetti) and SMC extinction curves. However, the\nregions of highest SFR intensity along the spiral arms are consistent with a\nstarburst-like extinction. Overall, the level of star-formation we find is\nhigher than previously published for this galaxy, by about a factor of two,\nwhich, contrary to previous conclusions, implies that the interaction that\ncaused the distorted morphology of NGC2442 likely also triggered increased\nlevels of star-formation activity. Outside of the spiral arms, we discover what\nappears to be a superbubble, ~1.7kpc across in the IRAC images. Significant\nH{\\alpha}, UV and IR emission in the area also suggest vigorous ongoing\nstar-formation. A known, recent supernova (SN1999ga) is located at the edge of\nthis superbubble.

Previous attempts which assumed\nnon-minimal coupling to gravity failed due to a tachyonic instability of the\nsinglet field during inflation. A canonical K\\\"{a}hler potential with\n\\textit{minimal coupling} to gravity can resolve the tachyonic instability but\nruns into the $\\eta$-problem. We suggest a model which is free of the\n$\\eta$-problem due to an additional coupling in the K\\\"{a}hler potential which\nis allowed by the Standard Model gauge group. This induces directions in the\npotential which we call K-flat. For a certain value of the new coupling in the\n(N)MSSM, the K\\\"{a}hler potential is special, because it can be associated with\na certain shift symmetry for the Higgs doublets, a generalization of the shift\nsymmetry for singlets in earlier models. We find that K-flat direction has\n$H_u^0=-H_d^{0*}.$ This shift symmetry is broken by interactions coming from\nthe superpotential and gauge fields. This direction fails to produce successful\ninflation in the MSSM but produces a viable model in the NMSSM. The model is\nspecifically interesting in the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) limit of the NMSSM.

With the first\napproach, we show that the large majority of galaxies within group- and\ncluster-mass halos have acquired the bulk of their stellar mass through gas\naccretion and not via galaxy mergers. We deduce that most dwarf ellipticals are\nnot built up by galaxy mergers. With the second approach, we constrain the star\nformation histories of dwarfs by requiring that star formation must occur\nwithin halos of a minimum circular velocity set by the evolution of the\ntemperature of the IGM, starting before the epoch of reionization. We\nqualitatively reproduce the downsizing trend of greater ages at greater masses\nand predict an upsizing trend of greater ages as one proceeds to masses lower\nthan m_crit.

It has been proposed that MHD\nturbulence, generated during cluster-cluster mergers, may be a source of\nparticle reacceleration in the IGM. Calculations of turbulent acceleration must\naccount self-consistently for the complex non--linear coupling between\nturbulent waves and particles.

Each scaler measures how many GRB photons produce at least\none energy deposition above 50 keV in the corresponding MAPM.

In the\nstandard approach to cosmology it is assumed that this relation is the same as\nin the homogeneous universe. As the real universe is not homogeneous there are\nseveral methods to calculate the correction. The weak lensing approximation and\nthe Dyer-Roeder relation are one of them. This paper establishes a link between\nthese two approximations. It is shown that if the universe is homogeneous with\nonly small, vanishing after averaging, density fluctuations along the line of\nsight, then the distance correction is negligible. It is also shown that a\nvanishing 3D average of density fluctuations does not imply that the mean of\ndensity fluctuations along the line of sight is zero. In this case, even within\nthe linear approximation, the distance correction is not negligible.

Applying our\nmethod to the sample of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7), we measure H(z=0.35)=82.1_{-4.9}^{+4.8} km\ns^{-1}Mpc^{-1}, D_A(z=0.35)=1048_{-58}^{+60} Mpc without assuming a dark energy\nmodel or a flat Universe.

We present new models for the\nchemical evolution of these galaxies by assuming different regimes of star\nformation (bursting and continuous) and different kinds of galactic winds\n(normal and metal-enhanced). Our results show that in order to reproduce all\nthe properties of these galaxies, including the spread in the chemical\nabundances, the star formation should have proceeded in bursts and the number\nof bursts should be not larger than 10 in each galaxy, and that metal-enhanced\ngalactic winds are required. A metal-enhanced wind efficiency increasing with\ngalactic mass can by itself reproduce the observed mass-metallicity relation\nalthough also an increasing efficiency of star formation and/or number and/or\nduration of bursts can equally well reproduce such a relation. Metal enhanced\nwinds together with an increasing amount of star formation with galactic mass\nare required to explain most of the properties of these galaxies. Normal\ngalactic winds, where all the gas is lost at the same rate, do not reproduce\nthe features of these galaxies. We suggest that these galaxies should have\nsuffered a different number of bursts varying from 2 to 10 and that the\nefficiency of metal-enhanced winds should have been not too high\n($\\lambda_{mw}\\sim1$). We predict for these galaxies present time Type Ia SN\nrates from 0.00084 and 0.0023 per century.

The puzzling darkness of massive Milky Way subhaloes Abstract: We show that dissipationless LCDM simulations predict that the majority of\nthe most massive subhaloes of the Milky Way are too dense to host any of its\nbright satellites (L_V > 10^5 L_sun). These dark subhaloes have circular\nvelocities at infall of 30-70 km/s and infall masses of [0.2-4] x 10^10 M_sun.\nUnless the Milky Way is a statistical anomaly, this implies that galaxy\nformation becomes effectively stochastic at these masses. This is in marked\ncontrast to the well-established monotonic relation between galaxy luminosity\nand halo circular velocity (or halo mass) for more massive haloes. We show that\nat least two (and typically four) of these massive dark subhaloes are expected\nto produce a larger dark matter annihilation flux than Draco.

For the same value of the energy density parameter\nof matter $\\Omega_{m,0}$, the growth rate $f$ in Galileon models is enhanced,\nrelative to the $\\Lambda$CDM case, because of an increase in Newton's constant.\nThe smaller $\\Omega_{m,0}$ is, the more growth rate is suppressed. Therefore,\nthe best fit value of $\\Omega_{m,0}$ in the Galileon model, based only the\ngrowth rate data, is quite small. This is incompatible with the value of\n$\\Omega_{m,0}$ obtained from the combination of SN Ia, CMB, and BAO data.

We numerically calculate the local-type\nfNL signal in the CMB that would be measured for such models (including the\nfull transfer function and 2D projection). The nature of the result depends on\nseveral parameters, including the occupation number N_k, the phase angle\n\\theta_k between the Bogoliubov parameters, and the slow-roll parameter\n\\epsilon. In the most conservative case, where one takes \\theta_k \\approx\n\\eta_0 k (justified by physical reasons discussed within) and \\epsilon\\lesssim\n0.01, we find that 0 < fNL < 1.52 (\\epsilon/0.01), which is likely too small to\nbe detected in the CMB.

In the absence of a compelling theory\nto explain the observations, a first task is to develop a robust phenomenology.\nIf the acceleration is driven by some form of dark energy, then, the\nphenomenology is determined by the dark energy equation of state w. A major aim\nof ongoing and upcoming cosmological surveys is to measure w and its time\ndependence at high accuracy. Since w(z) is not directly accessible to\nmeasurement, powerful reconstruction methods are needed to extract it reliably\nfrom observations. We have recently introduced a new reconstruction method for\nw(z) based on Gaussian process modeling. This method can capture nontrivial\ntime-dependences in w(z) and, most importantly, it yields controlled and\nunbaised error estimates. In this paper we extend the method to include a\ndiverse set of measurements: baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic microwave\nbackground measurements, and supernova data. We analyze currently available\ndata sets and present the resulting constraints on w(z), finding that current\nobservations are in very good agreement with a cosmological constant. In\naddition we explore how well our method captures nontrivial behavior of w(z) by\nanalyzing simulated data assuming high-quality observations from future\nsurveys. We find that the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements by\nthemselves already lead to remarkably good reconstruction results and that the\ncombination of different high-quality probes allows us to reconstruct w(z) very\nreliably with small error bounds. \n\n"}

A new look at the morphology of nearby\n  galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation Abstract: We look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies.\nEdge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. They appear like spiral galaxies\nwith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals with\ndisky isophotes. Fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range of\nbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. The slow rotators are rounder and are\ngenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, elliptical\ngalaxies. We propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by Hubble as it\ngives a misleading description of ETGs. We study for the first time the\nkinematic morphology-density T-Sigma relation using fast and slow rotators to\nreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. We find that our relation is cleaner than\nusing classic morphology. Slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest density\nenvironments [f(SR)<2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(SR)~4%] of\nthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, with\nthe exception of the densest core of the Virgo cluster [f(SR)~20%]. We find a\nclean log-linear relation between the fraction f(Sp) of spiral galaxies and the\nlocal galaxy surface density. The existence of a smooth kinematic T-Sigma\nrelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment as\nmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators in\nlow-density environments. It shows that the segregation is driven by local\neffects at the small-group scale. Only at the largest densities in the Virgo\ncore does the f(Sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while the\nfraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. This suggests that\na different mechanism is at work there. (Abridged) \n\n"}

Angle-averaged\nmeasurements of clustering yield constraints on the quantity D_A^2/H. However,\nto break the degeneracy between these two parameters one must measure the\nanisotropic correlation function as a function of both line-of-sight (radial)\nand transverse separations. Here we investigate how to most effectively do so,\nusing analytic techniques and mock catalogues. In particular, we examine\nmultipole expansions of the correlation function as well as \"clustering wedges\"\nxi(Delta mu, s), where mu = s_||/s and s_|| is the radial component of\nseparation s. Both techniques allow strong constraints on H and D_A, as\nexpected. The radial wedges strongly depend on H and the transverse wedges are\nsensitive to D_A.

Our deep data confirm from individual\nfar-infrared detections that z~2 star formation rates are overestimated if\nbased on 24 um fluxes and SED templates that are calibrated via local trends\nwith luminosity. Galaxies with similar ratios of rest-frame nuLnu(8) to 8-1000\num infrared luminosity (LIR) tend to lie along lines of constant offset from\nthe main sequence. We explore the relation between SED shape and offset in\nspecific star formation rate (SSFR) from the redshift-dependent main sequence.\nMain sequence galaxies tend to have a similar nuLnu(8)/LIR regardless of LIR\nand redshift, up to z~2.5, and nuLnu(8)/LIR decreases with increasing offset\nabove the main sequence in a consistent way at the studied redshifts. We\nprovide a redshift-independent calibration of SED templates in the range of\n8--60 um as a function of log(SSFR) offset from the main sequence. Redshift\ndependency enters only through the evolution of the main sequence with time.\nUltra deep IRS spectra match these SED trends well and verify that they are\nmostly due to a change in ratio of PAH to LIR rather than continua of hidden\nAGN. Alternatively, we discuss the dependence of nuLnu(8)/LIR on LIR. Same\nnuLnu(8)/LIR is reached at increasingly higher LIR at higher redshift, with\nshifts relative to local by 0.5 and 0.8 dex in log(LIR) at redshifts z~1 and\nz~2.

Comparison with similar spectral and timing\nproperties observed in the black hole X-ray binary (BHB) GRS 1915+105 suggests\nthat RE J1034+396 is a super-Eddington accretor. A more complete understanding\nof the behaviour of RE J1034+396 can therefore lead to a unification of the\naccretion physics between such extreme AGN and super-Eddington BHBs. Here we\nreport on our latest XMM-Newton observations of RE J1034+396, which no longer\nshow the QPO, indicating that this source shows a non-stationary\npower-spectrum. We use spectral and temporal analysis across all five\nXMM-Newton observations of the source to probe the evolution of the object. The\ncombination of the shape of the fractional variability with energy and the\ninferred velocity of absorbing material in the line-of-sight rules out an\nabsorption-only method of creating the QPO. Instead the periodically changing\nabsorption may be produced by the QPO causing a change in ionization state. We\nextend our analysis by including the covariance spectra which give much better\nsignal to noise than an rms spectrum. These reveal a new aspect of the QPO,\nwhich is that there is also a small contribution from a soft component which is\nhotter than the soft excess seen in the mean spectrum. Folding the lightcurve\non the QPO period shows that this component lags behind the hard X-rays. If\nthis is due to re-processing then the lag corresponding to a light travel time\nacross 30 R_g. Some of the remaining observations have similar energy spectra\nand covariance spectra, but none of them show a significant QPO, so we conclude\nthat none of these features are the trigger for the appearance of the QPO in\nthis object. \n\n"}

Limiting the confusion from Galactic and Extragalactic foregrounds is\ncritical to the success of these telescopes. Instrumental response or the Point\nSpread Function (PSF) of such telescopes is inherently 3 dimensional with\nfrequency mapping to the Line of Sight (LOS) distance. EoR signals will\nnecessarily have to be detected in data where continuum confusion persists;\ntherefore, it is important that the PSF has acceptable frequency structure so\nthat the residual foreground does not confuse the EoR signature. This paper\naims to understand the 3 dimensional PSF and foreground contamination in the\nsame framework. We develop a formalism to estimate the foreground contamination\nalong frequency, or equivalently LOS dimension, and establish a relationship\nbetween foreground contamination in the image plane and visibility weights on\nthe Fourier plane. We identify two dominant sources of LOS foreground\ncontamination-'PSF contamination' and 'gridding contamination'.

Taking into account the\nabsorption of TeV photons by the interaction with the extragalactic background\nlight (EBL), we applied the method we developed in a previous work to derive\nthe redshift of PKS 0447-439. Moreover, we compiled the overall spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) using optical-UV, soft X-ray, and -ray data, nearly\nsimultaneous to the H.E.S.S. observations at TeV energies.

This class of theories includes\nEinstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons modified gravity as special\ncases. We analytically derive and solve the coupled field equations in the\npost-Newtonian approximation, assuming a comparable-mass, spinning black hole\nbinary source in a quasi-circular, weak-field/slow-motion orbit. We find that a\nnaive subtraction of divergent piece associated with the point-particle\napproximation is ill-suited to represent compact objects in these theories.\nInstead, we model them by appropriate effective sources built so that known\nstrong-field solutions are reproduced in the far-field limit. In doing so, we\nprove that black holes in Einstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons theory\ncan have hair, while neutron stars have no scalar monopole charge, in\ndiametrical opposition to results in scalar-tensor theories. We then employ\ntechniques similar to the direct integration of the relaxed Einstein equations\nto obtain analytic expressions for the scalar field, metric perturbation, and\nthe associated gravitational wave luminosity measured at infinity. We find that\nscalar field emission mainly dominates the energy flux budget, sourcing\nelectric-type (even-parity) dipole scalar radiation and magnetic-type\n(odd-parity) quadrupole scalar radiation, correcting the General Relativistic\nprediction at relative -1PN and 2PN orders.

This geometric test has been demonstrated several\ntimes using massive clusters which produce a large lensing signal. In this\ncase, matter at a single redshift dominates the lensing signal, so the analysis\nis straightforward.

Several reasons have been proposed to explain such peculiar emission.\nWe studied the validity of such hypotheses, including the possibility for it to\nbe True-Seyfert~2. We found little obscuration towards the nucleus A_V = 2.5\nmag, and a nuclear star-formation rate Sigma_SFR < 11.6 Msun yr^{-1} kpc^{-2},\nwhich is below the average in Seyferts. Unresolved hot-dust emission with T ~\n1150 K seems to indicate the presence of a torus with its axis close to the\nline of sight.

The model is embedded in an anisotropic type\nIIB compactification with two exponentially large extra dimensions and\nTeV-scale gravity. The bulk turns out to be nearly supersymmetric since the\nscale of the gravitino mass is of the order of the observed value of the\ncosmological constant. The quintessence field is a modulus parameterising the\nsize of an internal four-cycle which naturally develops a potential of the\norder (gravitino mass)^4, leading to a small dark energy scale without tunings.\nThe mass of the quintessence field is also radiatively stable since it is\nprotected by supersymmetry in the bulk. Moreover, this light scalar couples to\nordinary matter via its mixing with the volume mode. Due to the fact that the\nquintessence field is a flat direction at leading order, this mixing is very\nsmall, resulting in a suppressed coupling to Standard Model particles which\navoids stringent fifth-force constraints. On the other hand, if dark matter is\nrealised in terms of Kaluza-Klein states, unsuppressed couplings between dark\nenergy and dark matter can emerge, leading to a scenario of coupled\nquintessence within string theory. We study the dynamics of quintessence in our\nset-up, showing that its main features make it compatible with observations. \n\n"}

This data set has been\nreleased in the ninth SDSS data release, the first public data release of BOSS\nspectra. We show that the typical signal-to-noise ratio of BOSS spectra is\nsufficient to measure stellar velocity dispersion and emission line fluxes for\nindividual objects. The typical velocity dispersion of a BOSS galaxy is 240\nkm/s, with an accuracy of better than 30 per cent for 93 per cent of BOSS\ngalaxies. The distribution in velocity dispersion is redshift independent\nbetween redshifts 0.15 and 0.7, which reflects the survey design targeting\nmassive galaxies with an approximately uniform mass distribution in this\nredshift interval. The majority of BOSS galaxies lack detectable emission\nlines. We analyse the emission line properties and present diagnostic diagrams\nusing the emission lines [OII], Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha, and [NII] (detected in\nabout 4 per cent of the galaxies). We show that the emission line properties\nare strongly redshift dependent and that there is a clear correlation between\nobserved frame colours and emission line properties.

Our analysis confirms that the average number of\nsatellites around bright primaries, when expressed in terms of\nsatellite-to-primary stellar mass ratio (m_*^sat/M_*^pri), is a strong function\nof M_*^pri.

These results are\nconsistent with galaxy formation models in the LCDM scenario. We find excellent\nagreement between SDSS data and semi-analytic mock galaxy catalogues\nconstructed from the Millennium-II Simulation. Satellite galaxies trace dark\nmatter substructure in LCDM, so satellite abundance reflects the dependence on\nhalo mass, M_200, of both substructure and galaxy stellar mass (M_*). Since\ndark matter substructure is almost scale-free, the dependence of satellite\nabundance on primary mass results solely from the well-defined characteristic\nmass in the galaxy mass-halo mass relation. On dwarf galaxy scales, where\nmodels predict a power-law scaling, M_* \\propto M_200^2.5, similarity is\npreserved and satellite abundance is independent of primary mass.

We study both the gas\nfraction, defined as Mgas/(Mgas+Mstar), and the star formation efficiency (SFE)\ndefined by the ratio between far-infrared luminosity and molecular gas mass\n(LFIR/M(H2), i.e. a measure for the inverse of the gas depletion time. The\nsources are selected to be ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), with LFIR\ngreater than 10^12 Lo and experiencing starbursts. When we adopt a standard\nULIRG CO-to-H2 conversion factor, their molecular gas depletion time is less\nthan 100 Myr. Our full survey has now filled the gap of CO observations in the\n0.2<z<1 range covering almost half of cosmic history. The detection rate in the\n0.6 < z < 1 interval is 38% (15 galaxies out of 39), compared to 60% for the\n0.2<z<0.6 interval. The average CO luminosity is L'CO = 1.8 10^10 K km/s pc^2,\ncorresponding to an average H2 mass of 1.45 10^10 Mo. From observation of 7\ngalaxies in both CO(2-1) and CO(4-3), a high gas excitation has been derived;\ntogether with the dust mass estimation, this supports the choice of our low\nULIRG conversion factor between CO luminosity and H2, for our sample sources.\nWe find that both the gas fraction and the SFE significantly increase with\nredshift, by factors of 3 +-1 from z=0 to 1, and therefore both quantities play\nan important role and complement each other in cosmic star formation evolution. \n\n"}

Only two\ncurrent observational methods of determining the mass profile, gravitational\nlensing and the caustic technique, are independent of the assumption of\ndynamical equilibrium. Both techniques enable determination of the extended\nmass profile at radii beyond the virial radius. For 19 clusters, we compare the\nmass profile based on the caustic technique with weak lensing measurements\ntaken from the literature. This comparison offers a test of systematic issues\nin both techniques. Around the virial radius, the two methods of mass\nestimation agree to within about 30%, consistent with the expected errors in\nthe individual techniques. At small radii, the caustic technique overestimates\nthe mass as expected from numerical simulations. The ratio between the lensing\nprofile and the caustic mass profile at these radii suggests that the weak\nlensing profiles are a good representation of the true mass profile. At radii\nlarger than the virial radius, the lensing mass profile exceeds the caustic\nmass profile possibly as a result of contamination of the lensing profile by\nlarge-scale structures within the lensing kernel.

The nature\nof the escaping process of photons from these early galaxies is crucial to\nunderstanding galaxy evolution and the cosmic reionization. Here, we\ninvestigate the escape of Lya, non-ionizing UV-continuum (l = 1300 - 1600\nangstrom in rest frame), and ionizing photons (l < 912 angstrom) from galaxies\nby combining a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation with three-dimensional\nmulti-wavelength radiative transfer calculations. The galaxies are simulated in\na box of 5^3 h^-3 Mpc^3 with high resolutions using the Aquila initial\ncondition which reproduces a Milky Way-like galaxy at redshift z=0. We find\nthat the escape fraction (fesc) of these different photons shows a complex\ndependence on redshift and galaxy properties: fesc(Lya) and fesc(UV) appear to\nevolve with redshift, and they show similar, weak correlations with galaxy\nproperties such as mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust content, while\nfesc(Ion) remains roughly constant at ~ 0.2 from z ~ 0 - 10, and it does not\nshow clear dependence on galaxy properties. fesc(Lya) correlates more strongly\nwith fesc(UV) than with fesc(Ion). In addition, we find a relation between the\nemergent Lya luminosity and the ionizing photon emissivity of Lyman Alpha\nEmitters (LAEs). By combining this relation with the observed luminosity\nfunctions of LAEs at different redshift, we estimate the contribution from LAEs\nto the reionization of intergalactic medium (IGM). Our result suggests that\nionizing photons from LAEs alone are not sufficient to ionize IGM at z > 6, but\nthey can maintain the ionization of IGM at z ~ 0 - 5. \n\n"}

This can be understood if the\nstar formation is self-regulating, i.e. if the star formation rate (and thus\nthe gas fraction) increase until the outflow rate balances the inflow rate.\nFeedback from AGN is efficient at high masses, while increasing the initial\nwind velocity with gas pressure or halo mass allows one to generate galaxy-wide\noutflows at all masses. Matching the observed galaxy mass function requires\nefficient feedback. In particular, the predicted faint-end slope is too steep\nunless we resort to highly mass loaded winds for low-mass objects. Such\nefficient feedback from low-mass galaxies (M_* << 10^10 Msun) also reduces the\ndiscrepancy with the observed specific star formation rates, which are higher\nthan predicted unless the feedback transitions from highly efficient to\ninefficient just below the observed stellar mass range. \n\n"}

These\noverdense gas substructures are generally a source of unresolved bias of X-ray\nobservations towards high density gas, but their bright luminosity peaks may be\nresolved sources within the ICM, that deep X-ray exposures may be (already)\ncapable to detect. In this paper we aim at investigating both features, using a\nset of high-resolution cosmological simulations with ENZO. First, we monitor\nhow the bias by unresolved gas clumping may yield incorrect estimates of global\ncluster parameters and affects the measurements of baryon fractions by X-ray\nobservations. We find that based on X-ray observations of narrow radial strips,\nit is difficult to recover the real baryon fraction to better than 10 - 20\npercent uncertainty. Second, we investigated the possibility of observing\nbright X-ray clumps in the nearby Universe (z<=0.3).

Handling this connection between calculational and observer frames is\nphysically essential and ensures a momentum conserving description.

In addition, surveys\nhave non-trivial geometries, which make the interpretation of the observations\neven trickier, but the uncertainty can nevertheless be worked out within the\nGaussian approximation. With the recent realization that Gaussian treatments of\nthe power spectrum lead to biased error bars about the dilation of the baryonic\nacoustic oscillation scale, efforts are being directed towards developing\nnon-Gaussian analyses, mainly from N-body simulations so far. Unfortunately,\nthere is currently no way to tell how the non-Gaussian features observed in the\nsimulations compare to those of the real Universe, and it is generally hard to\ntell at what level of accuracy the N-body simulations can model complicated\nnon-linear effects such as mode coupling and galaxy bias.

Therefore, the X-ray emission from lensed quasars is\nfirst strongly lensed by the black hole before it is lensed by the foreground\ngalaxy and star fields. We present a scheme that combines the initial strong\nlensing of a Kerr black hole with standard linearized microlensing by\nintervening stars. We find that X-ray microlensed light curves incorporating\nKerr strong gravity can differ significantly from standard curves. The\namplitude of the fluctuations in the light curves can increase or decrease by\n~0.65-0.75 mag by including Kerr strong gravity. Larger inclination angles give\nlarger amplitude fluctuations in the microlensing light curves. Consequently,\ncurrent X-ray microlensing observations might have under or overestimated the\nsizes of the X-ray emission regions. We estimate this bias using a simple\nmetric based on the amplitude of magnitude fluctuations. The half light radius\nof the X-ray emission region can be underestimated up to ~50% or overestimated\nup to ~20%. Underestimates are found in most situations we have investigated.\nThe only exception is for a disk with large spin, radially flat emission\nprofile, and observed nearly face on, where an overestimate is found. Thus,\nmore accurate microlensing size constraints should be obtainable by including\nKerr lensing. The caustic crossing time can differ by months after including\nKerr strong gravity. A simultaneous monitoring of gravitational lensed quasars\nin both X-ray and optical bands with densely sampled X-ray light curves might\nreveal this feature.

In this vein, a new interpretation of the\nconventional Dyer-Roeder (DR) approach by allowing light received from distant\nsources to travel in regions denser than average is proposed.

Phenomenologically, this means that the DR\nsmoothness parameter (denoted here by $\\alpha_E$) can be greater than unity,\nand, therefore, all previous analyses constraining it should be rediscussed\nwith a free upper limit.

Instead, this torque-limited accretion model yields black\nholes and galaxies evolving on average along the observed scaling relations by\nrelying only on a fixed, 5% mass retention rate onto the black hole from the\nradius at which the accretion flow is fed. Feedback from the black hole may\n(and likely does) occur, but does not need to couple to galaxy-scale gas in\norder to regulate black hole growth.

The central structural feature\nof such effective actions is the coupling between degrees of freedom on the two\ntime axes. This reflects the fact that from an effective field theory point of\nview, dissipation is the loss of energy of the low-energy hydrodynamical\ndegrees of freedom to the integrated-out, UV degrees of freedom of the\nenvironment. The dynamics of only the hydrodynamical modes may therefore not\nposses a conserved stress-energy tensor. After a general discussion of the CTP\neffective actions, we use the variational principle to derive the\nenergy-momentum balance equation for a dissipative fluid from an effective\nGoldstone action of the long-range hydrodynamical modes.

Application in the\n  redshift range 0-1.1 Abstract: Long Gamma Ray Bursts (LGRBs) are related to the final stages of evolution of\nmassive stars. As such, they should follow the star formation rate (SFR) of\ngalaxies. We can use them to probe for star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the\ndistant universe following this assumption. The relation between the rate of\nLGRBs in a given galaxy and its SFR (that we call the LGRB \"bias\") may be\ncomplex, as we have indications that the LGRB hosts are not perfect analogues\nto the general population of SFGs. In this work, we try to quantify the\ndependence of the LGRB bias on physical parameters of their host galaxy such as\nthe SFR or the stellar mass. We propose an empirical method based on the\ncomparison of stellar mass functions (and SFR distributions) of LGRB hosts and\nof SFGs in order to find how the bias depends on the stellar mass or the SFR.\nBy applying this method to a sample of LGRB hosts at redshifts lower than 1.1,\nwhere the properties of SFGs are well established, and where the properties of\nLGRB host galaxies can be deduced from observations (for stellar masses larger\nthan 10**9.25 Msun and SFR larger than 1.8 Msun / yr), we find that the LGRB\nbias depends on both the stellar mass and SFR. We find that the bias decreases\nwith the SFR, i.e. we see no preference for highly SFGs, once taken into\naccount the larger number of massive stars in galaxies with larger SFR. We do\nnot find any trend with the specific star formation rate (SSFR) but the\ndynamical range in SSFR in our study is narrow. Although through an indirect\nmethod, we relate these trends to a possible decrease of the LGRBs rate / SFR\nratio with the metallicity. The method we propose suggests trends that may be\nuseful to constrain models of LGRB progenitors, showing a clear decrease of the\nLGRB bias with the metallicity. This is promising for the future as the number\nof LGRB hosts studied will increase. \n\n"}

Among physically plausible models,\nf(NHI) varies by less than 0.2 dex and D varies by less than 0.18 for LLSs.\nThis is primarily due to the fact that these uncertain physical processes\nmostly affect star-forming gas which contributes less than 10% to f(NHI) in the\nthe LLS column density range. At higher column densities, variations in f(NHI)\nbecome larger (approximately 0.5 dex at NHI = 10^22 cm^-2 and 1.0 dex at NHI =\n10^23 cm^-2) and molecular hydrogen formation also becomes important. Many of\nthese changes can be explained in the context of self-regulated star formation\nin which the amount of star forming gas in a galaxy will adjust such that\noutflows driven by feedback balance inflows due to accretion.

At z=6 (z=4) the remaining metals are distributed in\nCGM/IGM/voids with the following mass fractions: 0.06/0.04/0.01\n(0.03/0.02/0.01). Analogously to galaxies, at z=4 a density-metallicity\n($\\Delta$-Z) relation is in place for the diffuse phases: the IGM/voids have a\nspatially uniform metallicity, Z~$10^{-3.5}$Zsun; in the CGM Z steeply rises\nwith density up to ~$10^{-2}$Zsun.

Large deviations between the abundances of\nthe host star and its gas giants seem likely to occur if the planet formation\nfollows the core-accretion scenario.

ProDiMo\nprotoplanetary disk models are used to predict the chemical evolution of gas\nand ice in the midplane. We find that cosmic rays play a crucial role in slowly\nun-blocking the CO, where the liberated oxygen forms water, which then freezes\nout quickly.

The additional rarest $9-2=7$ muon tracks, while being sharp in\narrival directions, did not offer any correlated clustering nor any overlapping\nwithin known sources. We recently suggested that the highest energy (tens-TeV)\ncrossing muon along the ICECUBE, mostly at horizons or upcoming, are the ideal\ntool able to reveal soon such clustering or even any narrow angle pointing to\nknown (IR, X, Radio or $\\gamma$) sources or self-correlation in rare doublet or\ntriplet: a last hope for a meaningful and short-time $\\nu$ Astronomy.

Within three years of\nICECUBE data all the non-contained crossing highest energy muons above few tens\nTeV may be several dozens, possibly around $54$ (27 for upward ones), mostly\nenhanced along horizontal edges, painting known sources and/or self-correlating\nin doublets or rarest triplet (if steady or transient nearby source are at\nsight).

Both current and future photometric surveys are expected to obtain\nimages of billions of distinct galaxies. As a result, storing and analyzing all\nof these PDFs will be non-trivial and even more severe if a survey plans to\ncompute and store multiple different PDFs. In this paper we propose the use of\na sparse basis representation to fully represent individual photo-$z$ PDFs. By\nusing an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm and a combination of Gaussian\nand Voigt basis functions, we demonstrate how our approach is superior to a\nmulti-Gaussian fitting, as we require approximately half of the parameters for\nthe same fitting accuracy with the additional advantage that an entire PDF can\nbe stored by using a 4-byte integer per basis function, and we can achieve\nbetter accuracy by increasing the number of bases. By using data from the\nCFHTLenS, we demonstrate that only ten to twenty points per galaxy are\nsufficient to reconstruct both the individual PDFs and the ensemble redshift\ndistribution, $N(z)$, to an accuracy of 99.9% when compared to the one built\nusing the original PDFs computed with a resolution of $\\delta z = 0.01$,\nreducing the required storage of two hundred original values by a factor of ten\nto twenty.

We carry out a detailed X-ray spectral analysis with the\ntwofold aim of measuring redshifts and characterizing the properties of the\nIntra-Cluster Medium (ICM). Optical counterparts and spectroscopic or\nphotometric redshifts are obtained with a cross-correlation with NED.\nAdditional photometric redshifts are computed with a dedicated follow-up\nprogram with the TNG and a cross-correlation with the SDSS.

Finally, for all the sources with measured redshift,\nbackground-subtracted spectra are fitted with a mekal model. We perform\nextensive spectral simulations to derive an empirical formula to account for\nfitting bias. The bias-corrected values are then used to investigate the\nscaling properties of the X-ray observables. Overall, we are able to\ncharacterize the ICM of 46 sources.

These galaxies have both more gas and more\nstars in their disks than the typical disk galaxy of similar rotational\nvelocity. The \"condensed\" baryon fraction, $f_C$, the fraction of the baryons\nin a dark matter halo that settle either as cold gas or stars into the disk, is\ntwice as high in the HI-massive sample than typical, and almost reaches the\nuniversal baryon fraction in some cases, suggesting that the most extreme of\nthese galaxies have little in the way of a hot baryonic component or cold\nbaryons distributed well outside the disk.

The observatories belonging to this\ngeneration are composed of arrays of surface detectors and fluorescence\ntelescopes. The duty cycle of the fluorescence telescopes is ~10 % in contrast\nwith the ~100 % of the surface detectors. Therefore, the energy calibration of\nthe events observed by the surface detectors is performed by using a\ncalibration curve obtained from a set of high quality events observed in\ncoincidence by both types of detectors. The advantage of this method is that\nthe reconstructed energy of the events observed by the surface detectors\nbecomes almost independent of simulations of the showers because just a small\npart of the reconstructed energy, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes,\ncomes from simulations.

In the\nmodel of our interest, the electromagnetic (EM) field is coupled to a\npseudo-scalar inflaton $\\phi$ through the characteristic term $\\phi F\\tilde F$,\nbreaking the conformal invariance. This interaction dynamically breaks the\nparity and enables a continuous production of only one of the polarization\nstates of the EM field through tachyonic instability.

The EM field is subsequently amplified by parametric\nresonance during the period of inflaton oscillation.

We use a million spectra targeting\nLuminous Red Galaxies at z<0.8, after subtracting a best fit model galaxy\nspectrum from each one, as an estimate of the high-redshift Lya surface\nbrightness. The quasar-Lya emission cross-correlation we detect has a shape\nconsistent with a LambdaCDM model with Omega_M =0.30^+0.10-0.07.

The latter is expected to be four orders\nof magnitude brighter than the HI emission we wish to detect. We present a\nsimulation of single-dish observations including an instrumental noise model\nwith 1/f and white noise, and sky emission with a diffuse Galactic foreground\nand HI emission. We consider two foreground cleaning methods: spectral\nparametric fitting and principal component analysis. For a smooth frequency\nspectrum of the foreground and instrumental effects, we find that the\nparametric fitting method provides residuals that are still contaminated by\nforeground and 1/f noise, but the principal component analysis can remove this\ncontamination down to the thermal noise level. This method is robust for a\nrange of different models of foreground and noise, and so constitutes a\npromising way to recover the HI signal from the data. However, it induces a\nleakage of the cosmological signal into the subtracted foreground of around 5%.\nThe efficiency of the component separation methods depends heavily on the\nsmoothness of the frequency spectrum of the foreground and the 1/f noise. We\nfind that as, long as the spectral variations over the band are slow compared\nto the channel width, the foreground cleaning method still works. \n\n"}

Our simulations include the effects of stellar and AGN feedback\nand are based on an improved version of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics\ncode GADGET-3, which ameliorates gas mixing and better captures gas-dynamical\ninstabilities by including a suitable artificial thermal diffusion. In this\nLetter, we focus our analysis on the entropy profiles, the primary diagnostic\nwe used to classify the degree of cool-coreness of clusters, and on the iron\nprofiles. In keeping with observations, our simulated clusters display a\nvariety of behaviors in entropy profiles: they range from steadily decreasing\nprofiles at small radii, characteristic of cool-core systems, to nearly flat\ncore isentropic profiles, characteristic of non-cool-core systems. Using\nobservational criteria to distinguish between the two classes of objects, we\nfind that they occur in similar proportions in both simulations and in\nobservations.

In practice, to infer the reduced shear, weak\nlensing measures galaxy shapes, which are the consequence of both the intrinsic\nellipticity of the sources and of the integrated gravitational lensing effect\nalong the line of sight. Hence, a very large number of galaxies is required in\norder to average over their individual properties and to isolate the weak\nlensing cosmic shear signal. If this `shape noise' can be reduced, significant\nadvances in the power of a weak lensing surveys can be expected.

The relation of ionizing flux to observables such as 1500A continuum\nand ultraviolet spectral slope is sensitive to attributes of the stellar\npopulation including age, star formation history and initial mass function.

Instead, when dark matter is fed by\ndark energy, the reconstructed values of $H_0$ and $\\sigma_8$ nicely agree with\ntheir local determinations, with a full reconciliation between high- and\nlow-redshift observations. A non-zero coupling between dark energy and dark\nmatter, with an energy flow from the former to the latter, appears therefore to\nbe in better agreement with cosmological data. \n\n"}

As a first result, we found\nthat, apart from the static Einstein solution, the only Friedmann spacetimes\nwith constant (zero) internal energy are the ones with zero spatial curvature.\nThis happens because, in the computation of the internal energy $U$, the\ncontribution due to the non-vanishing Hubble flow must been added to the usual\nMisner-Sharp energy giving, for zero curvature spacetimes, a zero value for\n$U$.

The central idea of these tests is to determine the\naverage ellipticity of all galaxies with shape measurements in a grid in the\npixel plane. The distribution of the absolute values of these averaged\nellipticities can be compared to randomized catalogues; a difference points to\nsystematics in the data. In addition, we introduce a method to quantify the\nspatial correlation of the additive bias, which suppresses the contribution\nfrom cosmic shear and therefore eases the identification of a\nposition-dependent additive shear bias in the data.

The problem\naddressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants\nbetween solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused\na proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar\nluminosity, solar effective temperature and solar mass parameter) in the\nliterature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the\ntime of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of\nconsistent values becomes increasingly important. To address this, an IAU\nWorking Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy formed in\n2011, uniting experts from the solar, stellar, planetary, exoplanetary and\nfundamental astronomy, as well as from general standards fields to converge on\noptimal values for nominal conversion constants. The effort resulted in the IAU\n2015 Resolution B3, passed at the IAU General Assembly by a large majority. The\nresolution recommends the use of nominal solar and planetary values, which are\nby definition exact and are expressed in SI units. These nominal values should\nbe understood as conversion factors only, not as the true solar/planetary\nproperties or current best estimates.

We find 188 Lya emitters over\n7.3x10$^5$ Mpc$^{3}$, but also find significant numbers of other line emitting\nsources corresponding to HeII, CIII] and CIV emission lines. These sources are\nimportant contaminants, and we carefully remove them, unlike most previous\nstudies. We find that the Lya luminosity function at z=2.23 is very well\ndescribed by a Schechter function up to L~10$^{43}$ erg/s with\nL$^*=10^{42.59+-0.05}$ erg/s, $\\phi^*=10^{-3.09+-0.08}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ and\n$\\alpha$=-1.75+-0.15. Above L~10$^{43}$ erg/s the Lya luminosity function\nbecomes power-law like, driven by X-ray AGN. We find that Lya-selected emitters\nhave a high escape fraction of 37+-7%, anti-correlated with Lya luminosity and\ncorrelated with Lya equivalent width. Lya emitters have ubiquitous large (~40\nkpc) Lya haloes, 2x larger than their Ha extents. By directly comparing our Lya\nand Ha luminosity functions we find that the global/overall escape fraction of\nLya photons (within a 13 kpc radius) from the full population of star-forming\ngalaxies is 5.1+-0.2% at the peak of the star formation history. An extra\n3.3+-0.3% of Lya photons likely still escape, but at larger radii. \n\n"}

By analyzing a time series of stellar spectra from a host\nstar, modern astronomical instruments can in theory detect such planets.\nHowever, in practice, intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., star spots,\nconvective motion, pulsations) affects the spectra and often mimics a radial\nvelocity signal. This signal contamination makes it difficult to reliably\ndetect low-mass planets. A principled approach to recovering planet radial\nvelocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed by Rajpaul et\nal. (2015). It uses a multivariate Gaussian process model to jointly capture\ntime series of the apparent radial velocity and multiple indicators of stellar\nactivity.

The joint detection of gravitational waves (GW) and\nelectromagnetic (EM) signals from the merging of a binary system of compact\nobjects like neutron stars (NS), can help constrain the geometry of extra\ndimensions beyond our 3+1 spacetime ones. A theoretically well-motivated\npossibility is that our observable Universe is a 3+1-dimensional hypersurface,\nor brane, embedded in a higher 4+1-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS$_5$)\nspacetime, in which gravity is the only force which propagates through the\ninfinite bulk space, while other forces are confined to the brane. In these\ntypes of brane-world models, GW and EM signals between two points on the brane\nwould, in general, travel different paths. This would result in a time-lag\nbetween the detection of GW and EM signals emitted simultaneously from the same\nsource. We consider the recent near-simultaneous detection of the GW event\nGW170817 from the LIGO/Virgo collaboration, and its EM counterpart, the short\ngamma-ray burst GRB170817A detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and\nthe INTEGRAL Anti-Coincidence Shield spectrometer.

Low-mass\nx-ray binaries (LMXBs) such as Scorpius X-1 (Sco X-1) may emit accretion-driven\nCWs at strains reachable by current ground-based observatories. Binary orbital\nparameters induce phase modulation. This paper describes how resampling\ncorrects binary and detector motion, yielding source-frame time series used for\ncross-correlation. Compared to the previous, detector-frame, templated\ncross-correlation method, used for Sco X-1 on data from the first Advanced LIGO\nobserving run (O1), resampling is about 20x faster in the costliest,\nmost-sensitive frequency bands.

Indeed, it\nassumes a particular cosmological model (namely the flat $\\Lambda$CDM) to\ncalibrate the standardisation corrections parameters, i.e. the dependency of\nthe supernova peak absolute magnitude on its colour, post-maximum decline rate\nand host galaxy mass. As a result, this assumption could make the data\ncompliant to the assumed cosmology and thus nullify all works previously\nconducted on model comparison. In this work, we verify the viability of these\nhypotheses by developing a cosmology-independent approach to standardise SNe Ia\ndata from the recent JLA compilation. Our resulting corrections turn out to be\nvery close to the $\\Lambda$CDM-based corrections. Therefore, even if a\n$\\Lambda$CDM-based calibration is questionable from a theoretical point of\nview, the potential compliance of SNe Ia data does not happen in practice for\nthe JLA compilation. Previous works of model comparison based on these data do\nnot have to be called into question. However, as this cosmology-independent\nstandardisation method has the same degree of complexity than the\nmodel-dependent one, it is worth using it in future works, especially if\nsmaller samples are considered, such as the superluminous type Ic supernovae. \n\n"}

SNe that are randomly\ndistributed throughout a galactic disc drive inefficient galactic winds because\nmost supernova remnants lose their energy radiatively before breaking out of\nthe disc. Accounting for the fact that most star formation is clustered\nalleviates this problem. Super-bubbles driven by the combined effects of\nclustered SNe propagate rapidly enough to break out of galactic discs well\nbefore the clusters' SNe stop going off. The radiative losses post-breakout are\nreduced dramatically and a large fraction ($\\gtrsim 0.2$) of the energy\nreleased by SNe vents into the halo powering a strong galactic wind. These\nenergetic winds are capable of providing strong preventative feedback and eject\nsubstantial mass from the galaxy with outflow rates on the order of the star\nformation rate.

We generate realizations of\nprimordial and present-day matter fluctuations given a set of observations.\nThis hierarchical approach encodes a novel AP test, extracting several orders\nof magnitude more information from the cosmological expansion compared to\nclassical approaches, to infer cosmological parameters and jointly reconstruct\nthe underlying 3D dark matter density field. The novelty of this AP test lies\nin constraining the comoving-redshift transformation to infer the appropriate\ncosmology which yields isotropic correlations of the galaxy density field, with\nthe underlying assumption relying purely on the cosmological principle.

The current tritium beta decay experiments at Mainz and Troitsk\nare reaching their sensitivity limit. The different options for a next\ngeneration direct neutrino mass experiment with sub-eV sensitivity are\ndiscussed. The KATRIN experiment, which will investigate the tritium beta\nspectrum with an unprecedented precision, is being prepared to reach a\nsensitivity of 0.2 eV. \n\n"}
