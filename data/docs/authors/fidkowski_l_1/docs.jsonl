Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L. We explicitly establish the validity of this statement\nfor the case of N=4. The details of the relevant calculations being distinctly\ntransparent, one can readily convince oneself that our observation is valid for\narbitrary N. It follows that the issues raised by DPK, such as non-existence of\nthe Luttinger-Ward functional and \"breakdown of the elemental particle picture\nin strongly correlated electron matter\", are all inessential to the observed\nfailure of the LT. As regards the singularity of the self-energy \\Sigma(\\omega)\non the real \\omega-axis, observed by DPK, we demonstrate that this also is a\ndirect consequence of the non-uniqueness of the GS of the SU(N) model for 0 < n\n< N.

This was of\nimmense help and prepared me for a wonderful collaboration with the gardener\nhimself, on the resonating valence bond (RVB) theory of High Tc cuprates and\nquantum spin liquids, at Princeton. The result was bountiful - the first (RVB\nmean field) theory for i) quantum spin liquids, ii) emergent fermi surfaces in\nMott insulators and iii) superconductivity in doped Mott insulators. Beyond\nmean field theory - i) emergent gauge fields, ii) Ginzbuerg Landau theory with\nRVB gauge fields, iii) prediction of superconducting dome, iv) an early\nidentification and study of a non-fermi liquid normal state of cuprates and so\non. Here I narrate this story, years of my gardening attempts and end with a\nbrief summary of my theoretical efforts to extend RVB theory of\nsuperconductivity to encompass the recently observed very high Tc ~ 203 K\nsuperconductivity in molecular solid H2S at high pressures ~ 200 GPa. \n\n"}

In this paper we demonstrate that this\nbehaviour is robust even in the presence of thermal effects. The system is\ninitially prepared in a thermal state, then at a given time the bath is\ndisconnected and the interaction strength is suddenly quenched. The\ncorresponding effects on the long times dynamics of the non-equilibrium\nfermionic spectral function are considered.

We show how\nthis can be done for both Bosons and Fermions, and for both closed and open\nquantum systems, using additional sources coupled to bilinears of the fields at\nthe initial time, calculating Green's functions in a theory with these sources,\nand then taking appropriate set of derivatives of these Green's functions\nw.r.t. initial sources to obtain physical observables. The set of derivatives\ndepend on the initial density matrix. The physical correlators in a dynamics\nwith arbitrary initial conditions do not satisfy Wick's theorem, even for\nnon-interacting systems.

The interplay between disorder and\nordinary tilt generates an effective tilt along the $x$-direction, which is the\nphysically observable one. There exist two types of disorder which increase the\neffective tilt and drive a phase transition from the DSM phase to the diffusive\nmetal phase.

Surprisingly, the Dirac point is replaced by a bulk nodal\narc in the diffusive metal phase. The Coulomb interaction suppresses the\ndiffusive phase transition and therefore is harmful to the formation of bulk\nnodal arc.

The resulting models have nearly-flat lowest bands. We prove\nthat the ferromagnetic state is stable against a single-spin flip provided that\nCoulomb interaction U is sufficiently large. (It is easily found that the same\nstate is unstable against a single-spin flip if U is small enough.)

Numerically exact\ndiagonalization method is employed for a 20-site square lattice. We impose\ntwisted boundary conditions (BC) instead of standard periodic BC. For static\nand dynamical correlation functions, averaging procedure over the twisted BC is\nused to reduce the finite-size effect.

For an equal mixture of two states of fermions (\"spin up\"\nand \"spin down\"), pairing can be complete and the entire system will become\nsuperfluid. When the two populations of fermions are unequal, not every\nparticle can find a partner. Will the system nevertheless stay superfluid?

The superfluid region vs population imbalance is\nmapped out by employing two complementary indicators: The presence or absence\nof vortices in a rotating mixture, as well as the fraction of condensed fermion\npairs in the gas.

They turned out to be a foundation for subsequent developments\ndealing with more aspects that were unconventional - d-wave order parameter\nwith nodal Bogoliubov quasi particles, Affleck-Marston's $\\pi$-flux condensed\nspin liquid phase, unconventional spin-1 collective mode at $(\\pi,\\pi)$, and\nother fascinating developments. Kivelson, Rokhsar and Sethna's idea of holons\nand their bose condensation found expression in the slave boson formalism and\nlead to results similar to BZA program. Further, t-J model is a good minimal\nmodel around optimal doping, where RVB superconductivity is also at its best. \n\n"}

We introduce the concept of\nlow-dimensional Gauge-Like Symmetries (GLSs), and the physical conservation\nlaws (including topological terms and fractionalization) which emerge from\nthem. We prove then sufficient conditions for TQO at both zero and finite\ntemperatures. The topological defects which are associated with the restoration\nof GLSs lead to TQO. Selection rules associated with the GLSs enable us to\nsystematically construct states with TQO; these selection rules do not rely on\nthe existence of a finite gap between the ground states to all other excited\nstates. All currently known examples of TQO display GLSs.

Accordingly, for odd D>3 we find that the\nfield behaves as t^[-(2l+D-2)] at late times, where l is the angular index\ndetermining the angular dependence of the field.
