Of particular\nsignificance is the orbit content of the Fourier modes of these series when\nexpanded in three different parabolic subgroups, corresponding to certain\nlimits of string theory. This is of interest in the classification of a variety\nof instantons that correspond to minimal or next-to-minimal BPS orbits. In the\nlimit of decompactification from D to D+1 dimensions many such instantons are\nrelated to charged 1/2-BPS or 1/4-BPS black holes with euclidean world-lines\nwrapped around the large dimension. In a different limit the instantons give\nnonperturbative corrections to string perturbation theory, while in a third\nlimit they describe nonperturbative contributions in eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity. A proof is given that these three distinct Fourier expansions\nhave certain vanishing coefficients that are expected from string theory. In\nparticular, the Eisenstein series for these special values of s have markedly\nfewer Fourier coefficients than typical ones. The corresponding mathematics\ninvolves showing that the wavefront sets of the Eisenstein series are supported\non only certain coadjoint nilpotent orbits - just the minimal and trivial\norbits in the 1/2-BPS case, and just the next-to-minimal, minimal and trivial\norbits in the 1/4-BPS case. Thus as a byproduct we demonstrate that the\nnext-to-minimal representations occur automorphically for E6, E7, and E8, and\nhence the first two nontrivial low energy coefficients are exotic\ntheta-functions. \n\n"}

In this survey paper, we present the rigorous functional\nanalytic framework given by the authors in [HerLa1] and within which to study\nthe spectral operator. Furthermore, we also give a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the invertibility of the spectral operator (in the critical\nstrip) and therefore obtain a new spectral and operator-theoretic reformulation\nof the Riemann hypothesis.

In\nparticular, the cohomology and integration theories for generalized higher\norder forms are developed, including the Cartan calculus, a generalization of\nde Rham cohomology and a version of Thom's isomorphism theorem.

Using this theory the\nKorteweg-de Vries (KdV), the family of evolutionary Non Linear Schrodinger\n(NLS) equations, Kadomtzev-Petviashvili and many more completely integrable\nPDEs of mathematical physics are solved, using Zacharv-Shabath scheme. This\nlast approach includes the use of a Lax pair, and has an advantage to be\napplied to wider class of equations, like difference equations, but has a\ndisadvantage to be used only for \"rapidly decreasing solutions\". This technique\nis also intimately related to completely integrable systems. The identifying\nprocess of a Lax pair, a system and finally the \"scattering data\" is usually a\ndifficult process, simplified in many cases by physicals models providing clues\nof how the scattering data should be chosen. In this work we show that the\nscattering data can be encoded into singularities of a very special\nmathematical object: J-unitary, identity at infinity matrix-valued function,\nwhich, if evolved once, solves the inverse scattering theory, if evolved twice\nsolves evolutionary PDEs. The provided scheme seems to be universal in the\nsense that many (if not all) completely integrable PDEs arise (or should arise)\nin this manner by changing the so called \"vessel parameters\" (for examples,\nsolutions of KdV and evolutionary NLS equations are presented). The results\npresented here allow to study different flows (commuting and non-commuting) in\na unified approach and provide a rich mathematical arsenal to study these\nequations.

Under antisymmetry this property, also\nknown as quasi-uniformizability, allows one to compactify the topological space\nand to extend its order dynamics. In this work we study locally compact\n$\\sigma$-compact spaces endowed with a closed preorder. They are known to be\nnormally preordered, and it is proved here that if they are locally convex,\nthen they are convex, in the sense that the upper and lower topologies generate\nthe topology. As a consequence, under local convexity they are\nquasi-uniformizable. The problem of establishing local convexity under\nantisymmetry is studied. It is proved that local convexity holds provided the\nconvex hull of any compact set is compact.

More precisely, we use the so-called Jordanian r-matrix to\ndeform the Hamiltonian of the Richardson-Gaudin model. In order to preserve its\nintegrability, we need to insert a special nilpotent term into the auxiliary\nL-operator which generates integrals of motion of the system. Moreover, the\nquantum inverse scattering method enables us to construct the exact eigenstates\nof the deformed Hamiltonian. These states have a highly complex entanglement\nstructure which requires further investigation. \n\n"}

Appropriately scaled families of DiPerna-Lions-(Mischler) renormalized\nsolutions with Maxwell reflection boundary conditions are shown to have\nfluctuations that converge as the Knudsen number goes to zero. Every limit\npoint is a weak solution to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with different\ntypes of boundary conditions depending on the ratio between the accommodation\ncoefficient and the Knudsen number. The main new result of the paper is that\nthis convergence is strong in the case of Dirichlet boundary condition. Indeed,\nwe prove that the acoustic waves are damped immediately, namely they are damped\nin a boundary layer in time. This damping is due to the presence of viscous and\nkinetic boundary layers in space. As a consequence, we also justify the first\ncorrection to the infinitesimal Maxwellian that one obtains from the\nChapman-Enskog expansion with Navier-Stokes scaling.\n  This extends the work of Golse and Saint-Raymond \\cite{Go-Sai04, Go-Sai05}\nand Levermore and Masmoudi \\cite{LM} to the case of a bounded domain.

The relevant figure of merit is the maximal ratio\n(called data hiding ratio) between the distinguishability norms associated with\nthe two sets of measurements we are comparing, typically all measurements vs\nLOCC protocols. For a bipartite $n\\times n$ quantum system, it is known that\nthe data hiding ratio scales as $n$, i.e. the square root of the real dimension\nof the local state space of density matrices. We show that for bipartite\n$n_A\\times n_B$ systems the maximum data hiding ratio against LOCC protocols is\n$\\Theta\\left(\\min\\{n_A,n_B\\}\\right)$. This scaling is better than the\npreviously obtained upper bounds $O\\left(\\sqrt{n_A n_B}\\right)$ and\n$\\min\\{n_A^2, n_B^2\\}$, and moreover our intuitive argument yields constants\nclose to optimal. In this paper, we investigate data hiding in the more general\ncontext of general probabilistic theories (GPTs), an axiomatic framework for\nphysical theories encompassing only the most basic requirements about the\npredictive power of the theory. The main result of the paper is the\ndetermination of the maximal data hiding ratio obtainable in an arbitrary GPT,\nwhich is shown to scale linearly in the minimum of the local dimensions. We\nexhibit an explicit model achieving this bound up to additive constants,\nfinding that the quantum mechanical data hiding ratio is only of the order of\nthe square root of the maximal one. Our proof rests crucially on an unexpected\nlink between data hiding and the theory of projective and injective tensor\nproducts of Banach spaces. Finally, we develop a body of techniques to compute\ndata hiding ratios for a variety of restricted classes of GPTs that support\nfurther symmetries. \n\n"}

And if this is the case, how strong is quantum\nmechanical entanglement as compared to that exhibited by other theories? The\nfirst part of this thesis deals with these questions by considering quantum\ntheory as part of a wider landscape of physical theories, collectively called\ngeneral probabilistic theories (GPTs). Among the other things, this manuscript\ncontains a detailed introduction to the abstract state space formalism for\nGPTs. We start with a comprehensive review of the proof of a famous theorem by\nLudwig that constitutes one of its cornerstones (Ch. 1). After explaining the\nbasic rules of the game, we translate our questions into precise conjectures\nand present our progress toward a full solution (Ch. 2). In Ch. 3 we consider\nentanglement at the level of measurements instead of states, focusing on one of\nits main implications, i.e. data hiding. We determine the maximal data hiding\nstrength that a quantum mechanical system can exhibit, and also the maximum\nvalue among all GPTs, finding that the former scales as the square root of the\nlatter. In the second part of this manuscript we look into quantum\nentanglement. In Ch. 4 we discuss the entanglement transformation properties of\na class of maps that model white noise acting either locally or globally on a\nbipartite system.

The originality of this work resides in that this new notion\nof hypercontractivity is given in terms of the so-called amalgamated\n$\\mathbb{L}_p$ norms introduced recently by Junge and Parcet in the context of\noperator spaces theory. We make three main contributions. The first one is a\nversion of Gross' integration lemma: we prove that (weak) HC implies (weak)\nLSI. Surprisingly, the converse implication differs from the primitive case as\nwe show that LSI implies HC but with a weak constant equal to the cardinal of\nthe center of the decoherence-free algebra. Building on the first implication,\nour second contribution is the fact that strong LSI and therefore strong HC do\nnot hold for non-trivially primitive QMS. This implies that the amalgamated\n$\\mathbb{L}_p$ norms are not uniformly convex for $1\\leq p \\leq 2$. As a third\ncontribution, we derive universal bounds on the (weak) logarithmic Sobolev\nconstants for a QMS on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, using a similar\nmethod as Diaconis and Saloff-Coste in the case of classical primitive Markov\nchains, and Temme, Pastawski and Kastoryano in the case of primitive QMS.

Abstract: For many completely positive maps repeated compositions will eventually\nbecome entanglement breaking. To quantify this behaviour we develop a technique\nbased on the Schmidt number: If a completely positive map breaks the\nentanglement with respect to any qubit ancilla, then applying it to part of a\nbipartite quantum state will result in a Schmidt number bounded away from the\nmaximum possible value. Iterating this result puts a successively decreasing\nupper bound on the Schmidt number arising in this way from compositions of such\na map. By applying this technique to completely positive maps in dimension\nthree that are also completely copositive we prove the so called PPT squared\nconjecture in this dimension. We then give more examples of completely positive\nmaps where our technique can be applied, e.g.~maps close to the completely\ndepolarizing map, and maps of low rank. Finally, we study the PPT squared\nconjecture in more detail, establishing equivalent conjectures related to other\nparts of quantum information theory, and we prove the conjecture for Gaussian\nquantum channels. \n\n"}

The bias of an XOR game under local or global strategies\nis shown to be given by a certain injective or projective tensor norm,\nrespectively. The intrinsic (i.e.\\ model-independent) advantage of global over\nlocal strategies is thus connected to a universal function $r(n,m)$ called\n'projective-injective ratio'. This is defined as the minimal constant $\\rho$\nsuch that $\\|\\cdot\\|_{X\\otimes_\\pi Y}\\leq\\rho\\,\\|\\cdot\\|_{X\\otimes_\\varepsilon\nY}$ holds for all Banach spaces of dimensions $\\dim X=n$ and $\\dim Y=m$, where\n$X\\otimes_\\pi Y$ and $X \\otimes_\\varepsilon Y$ are the projective and injective\ntensor products.

It is now becoming an increasingly\nsignificant issue to develop the correlation functional theory that encompasses\nthe liquid state theory, especially for glassy systems where out of equilibrium\ncorrelation fields are to be investigated. Here we have formulated a field\ntheoretic perturbation theory that incorporates two-body fields (both of\ndensity-density correlation field and its dual field playing the role of\ntwo-body interaction potential) into a density functional integral\nrepresentation of the Helmholtz free energy. Quadratic density fluctuations are\nonly considered in the saddle-point approximation of two-body fields as well as\ndensity field. We have obtained a set of self-consistent field equations with\nrespect to these fields, which simply reads a modified mean-field equation of\ndensity field where the bare interaction potential in the thermal energy unit\nis replaced by minus the direct correlation function given in the mean\nspherical approximation. Such replacement of the interaction potential in the\nmean-field equation belongs to the same category as the local molecular field\ntheory proposed by Weeks and co-workers. Notably, it has been shown that even\nthe mean-field part of the free energy functional given by the self-consistent\nfield theory includes information on short-range correlations between fluid\nparticles, similarly to the formulation of the local molecular field theory.\nThe advantage of our field theoretic approach is not only that the modified\nmean-field equation can be improved systematically, but also that fluctuations\nof two-body fields in nonuniform fluids may be considered, which would be\nrelevant especially for glass-forming liquids. \n\n"}

Moreover, if the bits of the initial\nstring are flipped randomly, the average number of flips required to change the\nclassification grows linearly with n.

The Virasoro algebra of operators gets a manifest\ngeometrical meaning if referring to the holographically associated QFT on the\nhorizon: It is nothing but a representation of the algebra of vector fields\ndefined on the horizon equipped with a point at infinity. All that happens\nprovided the Virasoro ground energy h vanishes and, in that case, the Rindler\nHamiltonian is associated with a certain Virasoro generator.

This\nfact implies that N.C.CohFT possess a less sensitive topological property than\nK-theory, but the classification of manifolds by N.C.CohFT has a possibility to\ngive a new view point of global characterization of noncommutative manifolds.\nTo investigate properties of N.C.CohFT, we construct some models whose fixed\npoint loci are given by sets of projection operators. Particularly, the\npartition function on the Moyal plane is calculated by using a matrix model.\nThe moduli space of the matrix model is a union of Grassman manifolds. The\npartition function of the matrix model is calculated using the Euler number of\nthe Grassman manifold.

{"id": "quant-ph/0703062", "contents": "Title: A Topos Foundation for Theories of Physics: II. Daseinisation and the\n  Liberation of Quantum Theory Abstract: This paper is the second in a series whose goal is to develop a fundamentally\nnew way of constructing theories of physics. The motivation comes from a desire\nto address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating quantum theories\nof space and time. Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of\nphysics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain\nformal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics arises when\nthe topos is the category of sets. Other types of theory employ a different\ntopos. In this paper, we study in depth the topos representation of the\npropositional language, PL(S), for the case of quantum theory. In doing so, we\nmake a direct link with, and clarify, the earlier work on applying topos theory\nto quantum physics. The key step is a process we term `daseinisation' by which\na projection operator is mapped to a sub-object of the spectral presheaf--the\ntopos quantum analogue of a classical state space. In the second part of the\npaper we change gear with the introduction of the more sophisticated local\nlanguage L(S). From this point forward, throughout the rest of the series of\npapers, our attention will be devoted almost entirely to this language. In the\npresent paper, we use L(S) to study `truth objects' in the topos. These are\nobjects in the topos that play the role of states: a necessary development as\nthe spectral presheaf has no global elements, and hence there are no\nmicrostates in the sense of classical physics. Truth objects therefore play a\ncrucial role in our formalism. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/9905077", "contents": "Title: Extension of Quantum Mechanics to Individual Systems Abstract: The Copenhagen Interpretation describes individual systems, using the same\nHilbert space formalism as does the statistical ensemble interpretation (SQM).\nThis leads to the well-known paradoxes surrounding the Measurement Problem. We\nextend this common mathematical structure to encompass certain natural bundles\nwith connections over the Hilbert sphere S. This permits a consistent extension\nof the statistical interpretation to interacting individual systems, thereby\nresolving these paradoxes.\n  Suppose V is a physical system in interaction with another system W. The\nstate vector of V+W has a set of polar decompositions with a vector q of\ncomplex coefficients. These are parameterized by the right toroid T of\namplitudes q, and comprise a singular toroidal bundle over S, which comprises\nthe enlarged state space of V+W. We prove that each T has a unique natural\nconvex partition yielding the correct SQM probabilities. In the extended theory\nV and W synchronously assume pure spectral states according to which member of\nthe partition contains q. The apparent indeterminism of SQM is thus\nattributable to the effectively random distribution of initial phases. \n\n"}
