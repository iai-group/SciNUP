Much of this work has been indirect, determining the\ntwistor space support of scattering amplitudes by examining the amplitudes in\nmomentum space. In this paper, we construct the actual twistor scattering\namplitudes themselves. We show that the recursion relations of Britto, Cachazo,\nFeng and Witten have a natural twistor formulation that, together with the\nthree-point seed amplitudes, allows us to recursively construct general tree\namplitudes in twistor space. We obtain explicit formulae for $n$-particle MHV\nand NMHV super-amplitudes, their CPT conjugates (whose representations are\ndistinct in our chiral framework), and the eight particle N^2MHV\nsuper-amplitude. We also give simple closed form formulae for the N=8\nsupergravity recursion and the MHV and conjugate MHV amplitudes.

For N^kMHV, the\namplitudes are given by 2n-4 integrals in the form of Hilbert transforms of a\nproduct of $n-k-2$ purely geometric, superconformally invariant twistor delta\nfunctions, dressed by certain sign operators.

We suggest that this dual description lives in (2,2) signature and is\nnaturally formulated in twistor space. We recast the BCFW recursion relations\nin an on-shell form that begs to be transformed into twistor space. Our twistor\ntransformation is inspired by Witten's, but differs in treating twistor and\ndual twistor variables more equally. In these variables the three and\nfour-point amplitudes are amazingly simple; the BCFW relations are represented\nby diagrammatic rules that precisely define the \"twistor diagrams\" of Andrew\nHodges. The \"Hodges diagrams\" for Yang-Mills theory are disks and not trees;\nthey reveal striking connections between amplitudes and suggest a new form for\nthem in momentum space.

We address the question of how powerful these\nsymmetries are to completely determine the scattering amplitudes.

The term is generated when the theory contains a\nscale explicitly, when it is asymptotically free and in particular also when\nthe scale invariance is spontaneously broken. The terms are not generated when\nthe scale invariance is maintained. Examples studied include the large $N$\nlimit of the $CP^{N-1}$ model in $(2+\\epsilon)$ dimensions, a 3D gauged\n$\\phi^6$ vector model and its supersymmetric extension. In the latter case the\ngeneration of the Maxwell term at a fixed point is explored. The phase\nstructure of the $d=3$ case is investigated in the presence of a Chern-Simons\nterm as well.

We argue that this is not a real property of the\nradiation at strong coupling, but an artifact of the backreaction calculation,\nwhich is unable to faithfully capture the space-time distribution of the\nradiation. This becomes obvious in the case of a decaying system ('virtual\nphoton'), for which the backreaction is tantamount to computing a three-point\nfunction in the conformal gauge theory, which is independent of the coupling\nsince protected by symmetries.

Moreover, these backgrounds were shown to be sub-luminal\neverywhere in the space; in contrast to the common believe that these theories\nare necessarily superluminal in the vicinity of a static source. In this work\nwe complete that analysis by extending it to cover the whole parameter space of\nthese scalar-tensor theories. We find that the stability argument renders the\nasymptotically flat backgrounds unrealizable, forcing once again for\ncosmological asymptotics. In the case of pressureless sources these backgrounds\nare stable. However, they get destabilized in the presence of positive\npressure, larger than a critical density.

These phenomena\nare a direct consequence of the zero rest mass of gravitons, conformal\nnon-invariance of the graviton field, and one-loop finiteness of quantum\ngravity. The effects are due to graviton-ghost condensates arising from the\ninterference of quantum coherent states. Each of coherent states is a state of\ngravitons and ghosts of a wavelength of the order of the horizon scale and of\ndifferent occupation numbers. The state vector of the Universe is a coherent\nsuperposition of vectors of different occupation numbers. To substantiate the\nreliability of macroscopic quantum effects, the formalism of one-loop quantum\ngravity is discussed in detail. The theory is constructed as follows:\nFaddeev-Popov path integral in Hamilton gauge -> factorization of classical and\nquantum variables, allowing the existence of a self-consistent system of\nequations for gravitons, ghosts and macroscopic geometry -> transition to the\none-loop approximation. The ghost sector corresponding to the Hamilton gauge\nensures of one-loop finiteness of the theory off the mass shell.

For N<8 supergravity theories, complication arises due\nto the presence of a U(1) in the U(N) isotropy group, which introduces a\nsoft-graviton singularity that obscures the action of the duality symmetry. In\nthis paper, we introduce an anti-symmetrised extraction procedure that exposes\nthe full duality group.

These models are numerically coarse grained via tensor network\nrenormalization, allowing us to trace the flow of simplicity constraints to\nlarger scales. In order to perform these simulations we have substantially\nadapted tensor network algorithms, which we discuss in detail.\n  The BC and the EPRL/FK model behave very differently under coarse graining:\nWhile the unique BC intertwiner model is a fixed point and therefore\nconstitutes a 2D topological phase, BC spin net models flow away from the\ninitial simplicity constraints and converge to several different topological\nphases. Most of these phases correspond to decoupling spin foam vertices,\nhowever we find also a new phase in which this is not the case, and in which a\nnon-trivial version of the simplicity constraints holds. The coarse graining\nflow of the BC spin net models indicates furthermore that the phase transitions\nare not of second order. The EPRL/FK model by contrast reveals a far more\nintricate and complex dynamics. We observe an immediate flow away from the\noriginal simplicity constraints, however, with the truncation employed here,\nthe models generically do not converge to a fixed point.\n  The results show that the imposition of simplicity constraints can indeed\nlead to interesting and complex dynamics.

Then, these axions\nremain in the expanding Universe contributing to the dark radiation component,\nwhich is severely bounded from present cosmological data. We place a general\nconstraint on the axion production rate and apply it to several variants of\nreasonable inflaton-to-axion couplings. The limit merely constrains the number\nof ultralight axions and the relative strength of inflaton-to-axion coupling.\nIt is valid in both large and small field inflationary models irrespectively of\nthe axion energy scales and masses. Thus, the limit is complementary to those\nassociated with the Universe overclosure and axion isocurvature fluctuations.\nIn particular, a hundred of axions is forbidden if inflaton universally couples\nto all the fields at reheating. In the case of gravitational sector being\nresponsible for the reheating of the Universe (which is a natural option in all\ninflationary models with modified gravity), the axion production can be\nefficient.

Moreover, negative conductivity has been\nclaimed to occur for light bosons in moderate electric fields, and for fermions\nof any mass in electric fields below a certain threshold. Furthemore, in the\nlimit of large mass and weak electric field, the current contains terms which\nare not exponentially suppressed, contrary to the semiclassical intuition. Here\nwe explain these behaviors, showing that most of the reported negative\nconductivity is spurious. First, we show that the terms which are not\nexponentially suppressed follow precisely from the local Euler-Heisenberg\nLagrangian (suitably generalized to curved space). Thus, such terms are\nunrelated to pair creation or to the transport of electric charge. Rather, they\ncorrespond to non-linearities of the electric field (responsible in particular\nfor vacuum birefringence). The remaining contributions are exponentially\nsuppressed and correspond to the creation of Schwinger pairs. Second, we argue\nthat for light carriers the negative term in the regularized current does not\ncorrespond to a negative conductivity, but to the logarithmic running of the\nelectric coupling constant, up to the high energy Hubble scale.

We show that kink\nconfigurations employing Higgs fields in the 45 (the adjoint representation) of\nO(10) break up into three classes: those that at finite distances from the wall\nrespect a U(5) subgroup of SO(10), and two others that respect the smaller\nsubgroups U(3) x U(2) and U(4) x U(1). These smaller subgroups arise from the\nclash of symmetries mechanism: they are the intersections of two differently\nembedded U(5) subgroups of SO(10), the latter being the symmetries respected in\nasymptotia on opposite sides of the domain wall. The existence of the SO(10) ->\nU(3) x U(2) = SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) x U(1)' = G_{SM} x U(1)' class advances the\nsearch for a realistic brane world model wherein some of the required symmetry\nbreaking is achieved via the clash of symmetries rather than the conventional\nmechanism. At the centres of the walls, the unbroken symmetries are enhanced.\nIn the U(3) x U(2) case, the symmetry is O(6) x U(2), which is closely related\nto the Pati-Salam-like SU(4) x SU(2) x U(1) group. If our universe is a brane\nlocated at the centre of such a wall, then we see the O(10) symmetry as being\nstrongly broken to SU(4) x SU(2) x U(1). Interestingly, if the brane-world\ndegrees of freedom enjoy a slight leakage off the wall, then an additional\nsymmetry breakdown to U(3) x U(2) = G_{SM} x U(1)' is effectively induced on\nthe brane. This provides a possible framework within which to address at least\npart of a gauge hierarchy problem: O(10) is strongly broken to SU(4) x SU(2) x\nU(1), then more weakly to G_{SM} x U(1)' depending on the amount of leakage off\nthe brane.

We construct an explicit brane-world model in which\nthe brane-localized Standard Model is coupled to strong 5D gravity of\ninfinite-volume flat extra space. Due to the high ultraviolet scale, the\nStandard Model fields generate a large graviton kinetic term on the brane. This\nkinetic term ``shields'' the Standard Model from the strong bulk gravity. As a\nresult, an observer on the brane sees weak 4D gravity up to astronomically\nlarge distances beyond which gravity becomes five-dimensional.

The Gauss law is written in terms of the canonical\nvariables. The system is qualified as a generalized dynamical system with first\nclass constraints. Abeliazation is a specific feature of the formulation (most\nof the canonical variables transform nontrivially only under the action of an\nAbelian subgroup of the gauge transformations). At finite volume, a discrete\nspectrum of the light-front Hamiltonian $P_+$ is obtained in the sector of\nvanishing $P_-$. We obtain, therefore, a quantized form of the classical\nsolutions previously known as non-Abelian plane waves. Then, considering the\ninfinite volume limit, we find that the presence of the mass gap depends on the\nway the infinite volume limit is taken, which may suggest the presence of\ndifferent ``phases'' of the infinite volume theory.
