{"id": "0704.1447", "contents": "Title: Can Gravity Probe B usefully constrain torsion gravity theories? Abstract: In most theories of gravity involving torsion, the source for torsion is the\nintrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly\noriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.\nHowever, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of\ntheories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates\na significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action\nequals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple\nto a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB\ngyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the\nEarth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not\napply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the\nHayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called\nEinstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of\nthis theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for\nthe torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with\nthe spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either\nghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems\ncan be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition\nchoosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This\nyields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction\nprinciple is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does\nnot couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji\ntheory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There\nmay be other torsion theories which do. \n\n"}

This method can be applied to a four\ndimensional manifold of orbits in spacetime associated with a relativistic\nsystem. We show that a relativistic Hamiltonian which generates Einstein\ngeodesics, with the addition of a world scalar field, can be put into\ncorrespondence with another Hamiltonian with conformally modified metric. Such\na construction could account for part of the requirements of Bekenstein for\nachieving the MOND theory of Milgrom in the post-Newtonian limit. The\nconstraints on the MOND theory imposed by the galactic rotation curves, through\nthis correspondence, would then imply constraints on the structure of the world\nscalar field. We then use the fact that a Hamiltonian with vector gauge fields\nresults, through such a conformal map, in a Kaluza-Klein type theory, and\nindicate how the TeVeS structure of Bekenstein and Sanders can be put into this\nframework.

The\npotential for the heaviest fundamental quark anti-quark pairs, which are like\nthe heavy quarkonium states in realistic QCD, can be computed and their linear\nbehavior at large separations and zero temperature could be demonstrated. At\nsmall separations the expected Coulombic behavior appears to dominate. On the\nother hand, at non-zero temperatures interesting properties like heavy\nquarkonium type suppressions and melting are shown to emerge from our gravity\ndual. We provide some discussions of the melting temperature and compare our\nresults with the Charmonium spectrum and lattice simulations. We argue that, in\nspite of the large N nature of our construction, certain model-independent\npredictions can be made. \n\n"}

Abstract: The decay of non-topological electroweak strings formed during the\nelectroweak phase transition in the early universe may leave an observable\nimprint in the universe today. Such strings can naturally seed primordial\nmagnetic fields. Protogalaxies then tend to form with their axis of rotation\nparallel to the external magnetic field, and moreover, the external magnetic\nfield produces torque which forces the galaxy axis to align with the magnetic\nfield, even if the two axis were not aligned initially. This can explain an\n(observed, but as of yet unexplained) alignment of the quasars' polarization\nvectors.

Using the fluid/gravity correspondence, we argue that one\ncan determine non-linear solutions to this problem in the long wavelength\nregime. On the boundary we find a conformal fluid with Dirichlet constitutive\nrelations, viz., the fluid propagates on a `dynamical' background metric which\ndepends on the local fluid velocities and temperature.

Resummation follows after one factorizes the cross\nsection into the rele- vant modes. The class of observables which are sensitive\nto soft recoil effects are particularly challenging to factorize and resum\nsince they involve rapidity logarithms. In this paper we will present a\nformalism which allows one to factorize and resum the perturbative series for\nsuch observables in a systematic fashion through the notion of a \"rapidity\nrenormalization group\". That is, a Collin-Soper like equation is realized as a\nrenormalization group equation, but has a more universal applicability to\nobservables beyond the traditional transverse momentum dependent parton\ndistribution functions (TMDPDFs) and the Sudakov form factor. This formalism\nhas the feature that it allows one to track the (non-standard) scheme\ndependence which is inherent in any scenario where one performs a resummation\nof rapidity divergences.

The ideas\nfrom mathematics are resurgence theory, the trans-series framework, and\nBorel-Ecalle resummation. The ideas from QFT use continuity on R^1 x S^1_L,\ni.e, the absence of any phase transition as N \\to infinity, or rapid-crossovers\nfor finite-N, and the small-L weak coupling limit to render the semi-classical\nsector well-defined and calculable. We classify semi-classical configurations\nwith actions 1/N (kink-instantons), 2/N (bions and bi-kinks), in units where\nthe 2d instanton action is normalized to one. Perturbation theory possesses the\nIR-renormalon ambiguity that arises due to non-Borel summability of the\nlarge-orders perturbation series (of Gevrey-1 type), for which a microscopic\ncancellation mechanism was unknown.

Under degeneracy of the electron gas (high concentration, low\ntemperature), a dip at the center of the polarization profile appears with a\npolarization maximum at a distance of about $2 \\; \\mu m$ from the center. This\ncounterintuitive result reveals that photoelectron diffusion depends on spin,\nas a direct consequence of the Pauli principle.

If such\nsupercurvature modes exist for a vector field with a sufficiently light mass,\nthen they would decay slower and easily survive the inflationary era. However,\nthe existence of supercurvature mode strongly depends on details of the system.\nTo clarify whether a massive vector field has supercurvature modes, we consider\na U(1) gauge field with gauge and conformal invariances spontaneously broken\nthrough the Higgs mechanism, and present explicit expressions for the Euclidean\nvacuum mode functions.

We demonstrate how the pattern of deviations\ncan be different among various Higgs sectors which predict the electroweak rho\nparameter to be unity; such as models with additional an isospin singlet, a\ndoublet, triplets or a septet. We conclude that as long as the gauge coupling\nconstant of the Higgs boson slightly differs from the standard model prediction\nbut is enough to be detected at the LHC and its high-luminosity run or at the\nInternational Linear Collider, we can identify the non-minimal Higgs sector\neven without direct discovery of additional Higgs bosons at the LHC. \n\n"}

The related studies also suggested an\ninteresting form of decoupling of the heavy Kaluza-Klein (KK) fermion states in\nthe warped 5D SM in the limit where the profile of the SM Higgs approaches the\nIR brane. We demonstrate that a similar phenomenon occurs when we include the\nmandatory KK excitations of the SM Higgs in loop diagrams giving dipole\noperators for SM fermions, where the earlier work only considered the SM Higgs\n(zero mode). In particular, in the limit of a quasi IR-localized SM Higgs, the\neffect from summing over KK Higgs modes is unsuppressed (yet finite), in\ncontrast to the naive expectation that KK Higgs modes decouple as their masses\nbecome large. In this case, a wide range of KK Higgs modes have\nquasi-degenerate masses and enhanced couplings to fermions relative to those of\nthe SM Higgs, which contribute to the above remarkable result. In addition, we\nfind that the total contribution from KK Higgs modes in general can be\ncomparable to that from the SM Higgs alone. It is also interesting that KK\nHiggs couplings to KK fermions of the same chirality as the corresponding SM\nmodes have an unsuppressed overall contribution, in contrast to the result from\nthe earlier studies involving the SM Higgs. Our studies suggest that KK Higgs\nbosons are generally an indispensable part of the warped 5D SM, and their\nphenomenology such as signals at the LHC are worth further investigation. \n\n"}

Since the quadratic term is symmetric, tensors with two\nsymmetric indices have to be taken into account. These are the Ricci and the\nEinstein tensors. For the Ricci tensor it is shown that a localized zero mode\nexists while that is not possible for the Einstein tensor. It is already known\nthat the Ricci scalar generates a localized solution but the metrics do not.\nTherefore, it can be conclude that divergenceless tensors do not localize the\nzero mode of gauge fields. The result is valid for any warp factor recovering\nthe RS metrics at the boundaries, and therefore is valid for RS I and II\nmodels. We also compute resonances for all couplings.

In this formulation the\nwarping of the extra dimension emerges from a partial breaking of the conformal\nsymmetry in five dimensions. The solution of the system can be described in two\nalternative gauges: by the metric or by the conformon. By considering this as a\nfundamental symmetry we construct a conformally invariant action for a vector\nfield which provides a massless photon localized over a Minkowski brane.

Extrapolation of this behaviour\nyields $<\\omega_a> \\sim 60 m_a$ in axion models of interest. We find that the\ncontribution to the cosmological energy density of axions from wall decay is of\nthe same order of magnitude as that from vacuum realignment, with however large\nuncertainties. The velocity dispersion of axions from wall decay is found to be\nlarger, by a factor $10^3$ or so, than that of axions from vacuum realignment\nand string decay. We discuss the implications of this for the formation and\nevolution of axion miniclusters and for the direct detection of axion dark\nmatter on Earth. Finally we discuss the cosmology of axion models with $N>1$ in\nwhich the domain wall problem is solved by introducing a small U$_{PQ}$(1)\nbreaking interaction.

A general\nmethod of causal interpretation of quantum systems is developed and applied to\na causal interpretation of fermionic quantum field theory represented by\nc-number valued wave functionals. \n\n"}

We analyse the\nreduction of coupling to noise due to nearby charge traps and present single\nqubit gates. The relative advantage of the encoding increases with lower charge\ntrap density. \n\n"}

The Dirac bispinor is\nrepresented by four ionic internal states, and position and momentum of the\nDirac particle are associated with the respective ionic variables. We show also\nhow to simulate the simplified 1+1 case, requiring the manipulation of only two\ninternal levels and one motional degree of freedom. Moreover, we study relevant\nquantum-relativistic effects, like the Zitterbewegung and Klein's paradox, the\ntransition from massless to massive fermions, with the relativistic and\nnonrelativistic limits, via the tuning of controllable experimental parameters. \n\n"}
