Furthermore, couplings of these KK states to light\nquarks and leptons are suppressed, whereas those to top and bottom quarks are\nenhanced compared to the SM gauge couplings. Therefore, the production of light\nquark and lepton states is suppressed relative to other beyond the SM\nconstructions, and the fermionic decays of these states are dominated by the\ntop and bottom quarks, which are, though, overwhelmed by KK gluons dominantly\ndecaying into them.

On the other hand, experimental evidences show\nthat there exists a non-zero cosmological constant, which implies in a deSitter\nspace-time, not compatible with the assumed Minkowski structure. Such\ninconsistency is shown to be a consequence of the lack of a application\nindependent curvature standard in Riemann's geometry, leading eventually to the\ncosmological constant problem in general relativity.\n  We show how the curvature standard in Riemann's geometry can be fixed by\nNash's theorem on locally embedded Riemannian geometries, which imply in the\nexistence of extra dimensions. The resulting gravitational theory is more\ngeneral than general relativity, similar to brane-world gravity, but where the\npropagation of the gravitational field along the extra dimensions is a\nmathematical necessity, rather than being a a postulate. After a brief\nintroduction to Nash's theorem, we show that the vacuum energy density must\nremain confined to four-dimensional space-times, but the cosmological constant\nresulting from the contracted Bianchi identity is a gravitational contribution\nwhich propagates in the extra dimensions. Therefore, the comparison between the\nvacuum energy and the cosmological constant in general relativity ceases to be.\nInstead, the geometrical fix provided by Nash's theorem suggests that the\nvacuum energy density contributes to the perturbations of the gravitational\nfield. \n\n"}

Whereas, at higher invariant mass the\nproduction is dominated by the fusion of unlike-helicity gluons, producing top\nquark pairs in the up-down or down-up off-diagonal configurations, identical to\ntop quark pair production via quark-antiquark annihilation. We study in detail\nthe low invariant mass region, and show that the spin correlations can be\neasily observed in this region by looking at the distribution of the difference\nin the azimuthal angles, Delta-phi, of the dileptons decay products of the top\nquarks in the laboratory frame. Due to the large cross section for top pair\nproduction at the LHC, even with a cut requiring that the invariant mass of the\ntop quark pair be less than 400 GeV, the approximate yield would be 10^4\ndi-lepton (e, mu) events per fb^{-1} before detector efficiencies are applied.\nTherefore, there is ample statistics to form the Delta-phi distribution of the\ndilepton events, even with the invariant mass restriction.

Methods: We calculate the neutrino flux from $\\beta$\nprocesses using nuclear statistical equilibrium abundances convoluted with\napproximate neutrino spectra of the individual nuclei and the thermal neutrino\nspectrum (pair+plasma). Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation.

The S-waves could well be the result of a final\nstate formed from an s-quark anti-s-quark pair in a 0+ spin-parity state, such\nas the f0(980) meson. Data driven and theoretical estimates of the Bs decay\nrate into the CP+ final state J/psi f0(980) are given, when f0 -> pi+pi-. The\nS-wave contribution in J\\psi\\phi should be taken into account when determining\nbeta_s by including a K+K- S-wave amplitude in the fit.

To\nmore directly match the models and the CDF results, we proceed to decay and\nreconstruct the tops, comparing our results against the \"raw\" CDF asymmetry and\ninvariant mass distributions. We find that the models that successfully\ngenerate the corrected CDF asymmetry at the parton level reproduce very well\nthe more finely binned uncorrected asymmetry.

As proven by their early results,\nthese strategies are promising, but raise the question of how well they will\ngeneralize for the future. We address this question by studying two thousand\nphenomenological minimal supersymmetric standard model parameter space points\nthat come from a fit to indirect and cosmological data. We examine the 5 sigma\ndiscoverability of the points employing a typical ATLAS-type search based on\nmissing transverse momentum (MET), a search based on an optimised MT2 cut and a\ncombination of the two, taking into account standard model backgrounds. The\ndiscovery reach of the strategies can depend strongly on the systematic\nuncertainty in the background, subject to the stringency of the cuts and the\ndetails of the background simulation. By combining the MET and MT2 based\nstrategies, with an integrated luminosity of 1 fb^-1 (10 fb^-1) at 7 TeV, 4-8%\n(42%) of the points are discoverable, depending on the systematic uncertainty\non the background.

The crucial cut, which is applied to\nmaximize signal significance, is on (pseudo)rapidity difference between the two\njets. This is due to the exponential growing of the QCD background contribution\nwith this variable. Usually it is assumed that signal from almost all exotic\nmodels populates the central dijet rapidity region y_{1,2} ~ 0 and |y_1-y_2| ~\n0. By contrast, the excited bosons do not contribute into this region, but\nproduce an excess of dijet events over the almost flat QCD background in chi =\nexp|y_1-y_2| away from this region. Therefore, different sets of cuts should be\napplied for new physics search depending on the searched resonance properties.\nIn order to confirm the bump and reveal the resonance nature various angular\ndistributions should be used in addition. In particular, for the excited bosons\nthe special choice of parameters could lead to a dip in the centrality ratio\ndistribution over the dijet invariant mass instead of a bump, expected in the\nmost exotic models. \n\n"}

This adds to the tension between experiment and supersymmetric\nsolutions of the naturalness problem, since the gluino is required to be light\nif the electroweak scale is to be natural. Here, we examine natural scenarios\nwhere supersymmetry is present, but was hidden from 2011 searches due to\nviolation of R-parity and the absence of a large missing transverse momentum\nsignature. Naturalness suggests that third generation states should dominate\ngluino decays and we argue that this leads to a generic signature in the form\nof same-sign, flavour-ambivalent leptons, without large missing transverse\nmomentum. As a result, searches in this channel are able to cover a broad range\nof scenarios with some generality and one should seek gluinos that decay in\nthis way with masses below a TeV. We encourage the LHC experiments to tailor a\nsearch for supersymmetry in this form.

Large part of interesting electroweak processes include production of\nneutrinos, while many new physics scenarios predict the existence of similarly\nweakly-interacting particles. In events with associated production of invisible\nparticles and hadronic jets, the measurement of the imbalance in transverse\nmomentum of the final state particles is the major leverage to reject the\notherwise dominant source of backgrounds in hadron colliders, i.e. the generic\nproduction of many jets by QCD interactions. Here we discuss a novel technique\nwhich utilizes the information derived from the spectrometer, eventually\ncoupled with the more straightforward calorimeter information, to infer the\npassage of invisible particles. We check the validity of this technique in data\nand Monte Carlo simulations in a broad range of topologies, starting from the\nsimplest, with two jets in the final state, to the ones with very large jet\nmultiplicities. We also suggest a new way, based on the same approach, to\nmeasure the yields and model the kinematics of the QCD multijet background in\ninvisible particles plus jets signatures.

Rather than designing individual searches tailored to specific\n2HDM signals, we employ the combination of many exclusive multi-lepton search\nchannels to probe the collective signal from the totality of production and\ndecay processes. Multi-lepton signals of 2HDMs can arise from a variety of\nsources, including Standard Model-like production of the CP-even scalars, $h$\nand $H$, through gluon-fusion with $h,H \\to ZZ^{(*)}$, or associated production\nwith vector bosons or top quarks, with $h,H \\to WW^{(*)}, ZZ^{(*)},\\tau\\tau$.\nAdditional sources include gluon-fusion production of the heavy CP-even scalar\nwith decays through the light CP-even scalar, the CP-odd scalar, $A$, or the\ncharged scalar, $H^\\pm$, such as $H \\to hh$, $H \\to AA$, $H \\to H^+ H^-$, $H\n\\to ZA$, with $A \\to Zh, \\tau\\tau$, $H^\\pm \\to Wh$, and $h \\to WW^*,\nZZ^*,\\tau\\tau$. Altogether, the combined multi-lepton signal may greatly exceed\nthat of the Standard Model Higgs boson and provides a sensitive probe of\nextended Higgs sectors. As a proof of principle, we use a factorized mapping\nprocedure between model parameters and signatures to determine multi-lepton\nsensitivities in four different flavor conserving 2HDM parameter spaces by\nsimulating the acceptance times efficiency in 20 exclusive multi-lepton\nchannels for 222 independent production and decay topologies that arise for\nfour benchmark 2HDM spectra within each parameter space. A comparison of these\nsensitivities with the results of a multi-lepton search conducted by the CMS\ncollaboration using 5 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected from 7 TeV $pp$ collisions\nyields new limits in regions of 2HDM parameter space that have not previously\nbeen covered by other types of direct experimental searches. \n\n"}

Cosmological parameters Abstract: We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB\ntemperature and lensing-potential power spectra.

In this model Planck data determine the\ncosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble\nconstant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density\nparameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement\nwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including\ncurvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to\npercent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an\nanalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets\nin addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are\nfavoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral\nindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes\nin the matter content of the Universe.

Abstract: Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), if exist in nature, are expected to mix with\nphotons in the presence of an external magnetic field. The energy range of\nphotons which undergo strong mixing with ALPs depends on the ALP mass, on its\ncoupling with photons as well as on the external magnetic field and particle\ndensity configurations. Recent observations of blazars by the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope in the 0.1-300 GeV energy range show a break in their spectra\nin the 1-10 GeV range. We have modeled this spectral feature for the\nflat-spectrum radio quasar 3C454.3 during its November 2010 outburst, assuming\nthat a significant fraction of the gamma rays convert to ALPs in the large\nscale jet of this blazar. Using theoretically motivated models for the magnetic\nfield and particle density configurations in the kiloparsec scale jet, outside\nthe broad-line region, we find an ALP mass $m_a\\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-7}$ eV and\ncoupling $g_{a\\gamma} \\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ after performing an\nillustrative statistical analysis of spectral data in four different epochs of\nemission. The precise values of $m_a$ and $g_{a\\gamma}$ depend weakly on the\nassumed particle density configuration and are consistent with the current\nexperimental bounds on these quantities. We apply this method and ALP\nparameters found from fitting 3C454.3 data to another flat-spectrum radio\nquasar PKS1222+216 (4C+21.35) data up to 400 GeV, as a consistency check, and\nfound good fit. We find that the ALP-photon mixing effect on the GeV spectra\nmay not be washed out for any reasonable estimate of the magnetic field in the\nintergalactic media. \n\n"}

We discuss the idea of using the\nMAC-E-Filter in a time-of-flight mode (MAC-E-TOF) in which the neutrino mass is\ndetermined by a measurement of the electron time-of-flight (TOF) spectrum that\ndepends on the neutrino mass. MAC-E-TOF spectroscopy here is a very sensitive\nmethod since the $\\beta$-electrons are slowed down to distinguishable\nvelocities by the MAC-E-Filter. Their velocity depends strongly on their\nsurplus energy above the electric retarding potential. Using MAC-E-TOF, a\nstatistical sensitivity gain is expected. Because a small number of\nretarding-potential settings is sufficient for a complete measurement, in\ncontrast to about 40 different retarding potentials used in the standard\nMAC-E-Filter mode, there is a gain in measurement time and hence statistical\npower. The improvement of the statistical uncertainty of the squared neutrino\nmass has been determined by Monte Carlo simulation to be a factor 5 for an\nideal case neglecting background and timing uncertainty. Additionally, two\nscenarios to determine the time-of-flight of the $\\beta$-electrons are\ndiscussed, which use the KATRIN detector for creating the stop signal and\ndifferent methods for obtaining a start signal. These comprise the hypothetical\ncase of an `electron tagger' which detects passing electrons with minimal\ninterference and the more realistic case of `gated filtering', where the\nelectron flux is periodically cut off by pulsing the pre-spectrometer\npotential. \n\n"}

To gain an\nanalytic understanding of soft drop and highlight the $\\beta$ dependence, we\nperform resummed calculations for three observables on soft-dropped jets: the\nenergy correlation functions, the groomed jet radius, and the energy loss due\nto soft drop. The $\\beta = 0$ limit of the energy loss is particularly\ninteresting, since it is not only \"Sudakov safe\" but also largely insensitive\nto the value of the strong coupling constant.

We\nuse this difficulty to motivate the construction of \"deconstructed\" transverse\nmass variables which are designed preserve information on both the norm and\ndirection of the missing momentum. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these\nvariables in searches for the pair production of supersymmetric top-quark\npartners which subsequently decay into a final state with an isolated lepton,\njets and missing energy. We show that the use of deconstructed transverse mass\nvariables extends the accessible compressed spectra parameter space beyond the\nregion probed by traditional methods.

Null results from LHC searches already\nseem to disfavor such partners if they are colored.

To address this limitation, we introduce \"deep compression\", a three\nstage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work\ntogether to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x\nwithout affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by\nlearning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to\nenforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two\nsteps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the\nquantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9x to 13x;\nQuantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection\nfrom 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required\nby AlexNet by 35x, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method\nreduced the size of VGG-16 by 49x from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of\naccuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than\noff-chip DRAM memory.

When an incident wave scatters off of an obstacle, it is partially\nreflected and partially transmitted. Since the scatterer absorbs part of the\nincident energy, the reflected wave carries less energy than the incident one.\nHowever, if the obstacle is rotating, this process can be reversed and waves\ncan be amplified, extracting energy from the scatterer. Even though this\nphenomenon, known as superradiance, has been thoroughly analysed in several\ntheoretical scenarios (from eletromagnetic radiation scattering on a rotating\ncylinder to gravitational waves incident upon a rotating black hole), it has\nnever been observed. Here we describe in detail the first laboratory detection\nof superradiance. We observed that plane waves propagating on the surface of\nwater are amplified after being scattered by a draining vortex. The maximum\namplification measured in the experiment was 20%, obtained for 3.70 Hz waves,\nin a 6.25 cm deep fluid. Our results are consistent with superradiant\nscattering caused by rapid rotation. In particular, a draining fluid can\ntransfer part of its rotational energy to incident low-frequency waves. Our\nexperimental findings will shed new light on Black Hole Physics, since shallow\nwater waves scattering on a draining fluid constitute an analogue of a black\nhole. We believe, especially in view of the recent observations of\ngravitational waves, that our results will motivate further research (both\ntheoretical and experimental) on the observation of superradiance of\ngravitational waves. \n\n"}

In the last decade, however, in an explosion of data\nfrom both $e^+e^-$ and hadron colliders, there are many recently observed\nstates that do not fit into this picture. These new particles are called\ngenerically \"exotics\". They can be either mesons or baryons. Remarkably, they\nall decay into at least one meson formed of either a $c\\overline{c}$ or\n$b\\overline{b}$ pair. In this review, after the introduction, we explore each\nof these new discoveries in detail first from an experimental point of view,\nthen subsequently give a theoretical discussion. These exotics can be explained\nif the new mesons contain two-quarks and two-antiquarks (tetraquarks), while\nthe baryons contain four-quarks plus an antiquark (pentquarks). The theoretical\nexplanations for these states take three divergent tracks: tightly bound\nobjects, just as in the case of normal hadrons, but with more constituents, or\nloosely bound \"molecules\" similar to the deuteron, but formed from two mesons,\nor a meson or baryon, or more wistfully, they are not multiquark states but\nappear due to kinematic effects caused by different rescatterings of virtual\nparticles; most of these models have all been post-dictions. Both the tightly\nand loosely bound models predict the masses and related quantum numbers of new,\nas yet undiscovered states.

The reason is\nthat silicon-based tracking detectors offer excellent granularity and precise\nvertexing, which can improve the angular resolution on highly-collimated jets\nand mitigate the impact of pileup. In this paper, we assess how much jet\nsubstructure performance degrades by using track-only information, and we\ndemonstrate physics contexts in which calorimetry is most beneficial.\nSpecifically, we consider five different hadronic final states - W bosons, Z\nbosons, top quarks, light quarks, gluons - and test the pairwise discrimination\npower with a multi-variate combination of substructure observables.

For this it is sufficient to take advantage of the freedom in\nchoosing the position of the HFMP.

AIC and BIC,\nwell-known model selection criteria, are special cases of $L_0$ regularization.\nHowever, since the $L_0$ norm of weights is non-differentiable, we cannot\nincorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We\npropose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative\nstochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero.

While the HBT radii oscillations relative\nto the second harmonic event plane measured recently reflect mostly the spatial\ngeometry of the source, model studies have shown that the HBT radii\noscillations relative to the third harmonic event plane are predominantly\ndefined by the velocity fields.

As a consequence, the theoretical error is now starting to\nlag behind the experimental one, and a ceaseless effort is required to reduce\nthe theory uncertainty to match the precision of the data. At hadron colliders,\nQCD predictions are obtained by convoluting perturbative parton-level results\nwith non-perturbative PDFs, whose precise determination is crucial to reach\npercent-accurate theoretical predictions. At the parton level, cross sections\nare obtained through a perturbative expansion in the strong coupling. In some\ncases, large terms appear at all orders and spoil the convergence of the\nseries. The perturbative description is rescued by resumming the series to all\norders, thereby making theory calculations accurate in regions where a\nfixed-order treatment is not sufficient. In this thesis I first present two\nglobal PDF sets where fixed-order calculations are supplemented by threshold\nand high-energy resummation, respectively.

In many HEP\nresearches, great efforts are made to increase the signal significance with the\npresence of huge background and various systematical uncertainties. Why not\ndevelop a BDT method targeting the significance directly? Indeed, the\nsignificance plays a central role in this new method. It is used to split a\nnode in building a tree and to be also the weight contributing to the BDT\nscore. As the systematical uncertainties can be easily included in the\nsignificance calculation, this method is able to learn about reducing the\neffect of the systematical uncertainties via training. Taking the search of the\nrare radiative Higgs decay in proton-proton collisions $pp \\to h + X \\to\n\\gamma\\tau^+\\tau^-+X$ as example, QBDT and the popular Gradient BDT (GradBDT)\nmethod are compared. QBDT is found to reduce the correlation between the signal\nstrength and systematical uncertainty sources and thus to give a better\nsignificance. The contribution to the signal strength uncertainty from the\nsystematical uncertainty sources using the new method is 50-85~\\% of that using\nthe GradBDT method. \n\n"}
