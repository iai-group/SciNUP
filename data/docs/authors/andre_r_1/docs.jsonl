Coulomb interactions couple the interfering edge mode to localized\nquasiparticle states in the bulk, whose occupation is quantized in integer\nvalues. For the integer quantum Hall effect, if the bulk-edge coupling is\nabsent, the resistance exhibits an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) periodicity, where the\nphase is equal to the number of quanta of magnetic flux enclosed by a specified\ninterferometer area. When bulk-edge coupling is present, the actual area of the\ninterferometer oscillates as function of B and V_G, with a combination of a\nsmooth variation and abrupt jumps due to changes in the number of\nquasi-particles in the bulk of the interferometer.

For type A potentials: (i) The average frequency has a\npower law dependence on the pressure;(ii) The normalized vibrational density of\nstates (NVDOS), with the average frequency as the unit of frequency, will\nsaturate as the pressure keeps increasing. This asymptotic NVDOS is independent\nof the attractive component of the potential and hence define a universality\nclass; and (iii) At higher pressures the Debye frequency and the average\nfrequency have the same pressure dependence and this dependence is identical\nfor the amorphous form and the two crystalline forms studied (FCC and HCP).

Our proposed glass model for solid He-4 has\nseveral implications: (1) The anomalous properties of He-4 can be accounted for\nby allowing defects to freeze out at lowest temperatures. The dynamics of solid\nHe-4 is governed by glasslike (glassy) relaxation processes and the\ndistribution of relaxation times varies significantly between different\ntorsional oscillator, shear modulus, and dielectric function experiments.

While numerical calculations may reflect\nsuch features, a complete theory of band warping has not been developed. We\ndevelop a generally applicable theory, based on radial expansions, and a\ncorresponding definition of angular effective mass. Our theory also accounts\nfor effects of band non-parabolicity and anisotropy, which hitherto have not\nbeen precisely distinguished from, if not utterly confused with, band warping.\nBased on our theory, we develop precise procedures to evaluate band warping\nquantitatively.

Angle- and\ntemperature-dependent quantum oscillations, supported by density function\ntheory calculations, reveal that NbP has the coexistence of p- and n-type WSM\npockets in the $k_{z}$=1.16$\\pi$/c plane (W1-WSM) and in the $k_{z}$=0 plane\nnear the high symmetry points $\\Sigma$ (W2-WSM), respectively. Uniquely, each\nW2-WSM pocket forms a large dumbbell-shaped Fermi surface (FS) enclosing two\nneighboring Weyl nodes with the opposite chirality. The magneto-transport in\nNbP is dominated by these highly anisotropic W2-WSM pockets, in which Weyl\nfermions are well protected from defect backscattering by real spin\nconservation associated to the chiral nodes.

As an example, we focus on the induced topological time-periodic\n(Floquet) phase in a 2D $p+ip$ superfluid, following an instantaneous quench of\nthe coupling strength. The post-quench Cooper pairs occupy a linear combination\nof \"ground\" and \"excited\" Floquet states, with coefficients determined by the\ndistribution function. While the Floquet bandstructure exhibits a single\navoided crossing relative to the equilibrium case, the distribution function\nshows a population inversion of the Floquet bands at low energies. For a\nrealization in ultracold atoms, these two features compensate, producing a bulk\naverage rf signal that is well-captured by a quasi-equilibrium approximation.\nIn particular, the rf spectrum shows a robust gap. The single crossing occurs\nbecause the quench-induced Floquet phase belongs to a particular class of\nsoliton dynamics for the BCS equation. The population inversion is a\nconsequence of this, and ensures the conservation of the pseudospin winding\nnumber. As a comparison, we compute the rf signal when only the lower Floquet\nband is occupied; in this case, the gap disappears for strong quenches.

In this work, based on the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function method, we explain such transport phenomena in\nthe H-shaped graphene with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. When the Fermi energy is\nnear the Dirac point, the nonlocal resistance is considerably large and is much\nsharper than the local one.

A\nvariant with only discrete translational symmetry breaking on a preimposed\nlattice structure, the `lattice supersolid', has been realized based on\nself-organization of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). However, lattice\nsupersolids do not feature the continuous ground state degeneracy that\ncharacterizes the supersolid state as originally proposed.

Analysis shows that for positive\nalpha's the scalar curvature does not drop to zero at the star surface (as in\nGeneral Relativity) but exponentially decreases with distance. Also the stellar\nmass bounded by star surface decreases when the value alpha increases.\nNonetheless distant observers would observe a gravitational mass due to\nappearance of a so-called gravitational sphere around the star. The non-zero\ncurvature contribution to the gravitational mass eventually is shown to\ncompensate the stellar mass decrease for growing alpha's. We perform our\nanalysis for several equations of state including purely hadronic\nconfigurations as well as hyperons and quark stars. In all cases, we assess\nthat the relation between the parameter $\\alpha$ and the gravitational mass\nweakly depend upon the chosen equation of state. Another interesting feature is\nthe increase of the star radius in comparison to General Relativity for stars\nwith masses close to maximal, whereas for intermediate masses around 1.4-1.6\nsolar masses, the radius of star depends upon alpha very weakly. Also the\ndecrease in the mass bounded by star surface may cause the surface redshift to\ndecrease in R^2-gravity when compared to Einsteinian predictions.

This approach provides a\nGeneralized-Langevin-Equation (GLE) as the average equation of motion for an\natom or ion in the material, from which non-Markovian nonaffine viscoelastic\nmoduli are extracted.

When the NV$^-$ - N$^+$ pair separation is large the properties\nof the pair will be as for single sites and a high degree of spin polarization\nattainable. When the separation decreases the emission is reduced, the lifetime\nshortened and the spin polarization downgraded. The deterioration occurs as a\nconsequence of electron tunneling in the excited state from NV$^-$ to N$^+$ and\nresults in an optical cycle that includes NV$^0$.

We\nstudied submicron lateral spin valve junctions, based on high mobility\nInAs/AlSb two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), with Ni, Co and Permalloy as\nferromagnetic electrodes. In the standard geometry it is very difficult to\nseparate true spin injection from other effects, including local Hall effect,\nanomalous magnetoresistance (AMR) contribution from the ferromagnetic\nelectrodes and weak localization/anti-localization corrections, which can\nclosely mimic the signal expected from spin valve effect. The reduction in\nsize, and the use of a multiterminal non-local geometry allowed us to reduce\nthe unwanted effects to a minimum. Despite all our efforts, we have not been\nable to observe spin injection. However, we find that this 'negative' result in\nthese systems is actually consistent with theoretical predictions for spin\ntransport in diffusive systems. \n\n"}

We allow general asymmetry\nin the \\textit{e-ph} coupling constants (matrix elements), i.e., we allow that\nthe coupling depends on the electron sub-system index. We derive a\nmulti-component \\textit{e-ph}power loss formula, which takes into account the\nasymmetric coupling and links the total \\textit{e-ph} energy loss rate to the\ndensity response matrix of the total electron system. We write the density\nresponse matrix within mean field approximation, which leads to coexistence of\\\nsymmetric energy loss rate $F_{S}(T)$ and asymmetric energy loss rate\n$F_{A}(T)$ with total energy loss rate $ F(T)=F_{S}(T)+F_{A}(T)$ at temperature\n$T$. The symmetric component F_{S}(T) $ is equivalent to the conventional\nsingle-sub-system energy loss rate in the literature, and in the\nBloch-Gr\\\"{u}neisen limit we reproduce a set of well-known power laws\n$F_{S}(T)\\propto T^{n_{S}}$, where the prefactor and power $n_{S}$ depend on\nelectron system dimensionality and electron mean free path. For $F_{A}(T)$ we\nproduce a new set of power laws F_{A}(T)\\propto T^{n_{A}}$. Screening strongly\nreduces the symmetric coupling, but the asymmetric coupling is unscreened,\nprovided that the inter-sub-system Coulomb interactions are strong. The lack of\nscreening enhances $F_{A}(T)$ and the total energy loss rate $F(T)$.\nEspecially, in the strong screening limit we find $F_{A}(T)\\gg F_{S}(T)$.

In the Newton method, the parameter variations are\ncalculated from the energy gradient and Hessian, using a reduced variance\nstatistical estimator for the latter. In the linear method, the parameter\nvariations are found by diagonalizing a non-symmetric estimator of the\nHamiltonian matrix in the space spanned by the wave function and its\nderivatives with respect to the parameters, making use of a strong\nzero-variance principle. In the less computationally expensive perturbative\nmethod, the parameter variations are calculated by approximately solving the\ngeneralized eigenvalue equation of the linear method by a nonorthogonal\nperturbation theory. These general methods are illustrated here by the\noptimization of wave functions consisting of a Jastrow factor multiplied by an\nexpansion in configuration state functions (CSFs) for the C$_2$ molecule,\nincluding both valence and core electrons in the calculation. The Newton and\nlinear methods are very efficient for the optimization of the Jastrow, CSF and\norbital parameters. The perturbative method is a good alternative for the\noptimization of just the CSF and orbital parameters. Although the optimization\nis performed at the variational Monte Carlo level, we observe for the C$_2$\nmolecule studied here, and for other systems we have studied, that as more\nparameters in the trial wave functions are optimized, the diffusion Monte Carlo\ntotal energy improves monotonically, implying that the nodal hypersurface also\nimproves monotonically. \n\n"}

In the 1->2 cloning we find that\nthe value for the fidelity of the optimal cloner is achieved, and values\ncomparable to the optimal ones in the general N->M case can be attained. If a\nsuitable set of network symmetries are satisfied, the output fidelity of the\nclones does not depend on the specific choice of the graph.
