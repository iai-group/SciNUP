A regularization method that\nremoves the problematic terms from the multi-reference energy density\nfunctional and which applies (i) to any symmetry restoration- and/or\ngenerator-coordinate-method-based configuration mixing calculation and (ii) to\nenergy density functionals depending only on integer powers of the density\nmatrices, was proposed in [D.

Thus, the 3NF at N3LO is needed for\nessentially two reasons: For consistency with the 2NF, and to (hopefully)\nimprove some critical predictions of nuclear structure and reactions. However,\nthere are indications that the 3NF at N3LO (in the so-called Delta-less version\nof the theory) is rather weak and may not solve any of the outstanding\nproblems. If this suspicion is confirmed, we have to go beyond, which may be\nsimilar to opening Pandora's Box. In this talk, I will discuss the various\npossible scenarios and how to deal with them. \n\n"}

New experimental data on nucleon spin\nstructure at low to intermediate momentum transfers combined with existing high\nmomentum transfer data offer a comprehensive picture in the strong region of\nthe interaction and of the transition region from the strong to the\nasymptotic-free region. Insight for some aspects of the theory for the strong\ninteraction, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), is gained by exploring lower moments\nof spin structure functions and their corresponding sum rules. These moments\nare expressed in terms of an operator-product expansion using quark and gluon\ndegrees of freedom at moderately large momentum transfers. The higher-twist\ncontributions have been examined through the evolution of these moments as the\nmomentum transfer varies from higher to lower values. Furthermore, QCD-inspired\nlow-energy effective theories, which explicitly include chiral symmetry\nbreaking, are tested at low momentum transfers. The validity of these theories\nis further examined as the momentum transfer increases to moderate values.

Recent measurements of both of these effects on light\nnuclei have shown a clear deviation from simple density-dependent models.\nPurpose: A better understanding of the nuclear quark distributions and\nshort-range correlations requires a careful examination of the experimental\ndata on these effects to constrain models that attempt to describe these\nphenomena.\n  Methods: We present a detailed analysis of the nuclear dependence of the EMC\neffect and the contribution of SRCs in nuclei, comparing to predictions and\nsimple scaling models based on different pictures of the underlying physics. We\nalso make a direct, quantitative comparison of the two effects to further\nexamine the connection between these two observables related to nuclear\nstructure.\n  Results: We find that, with the inclusion of the new data on light nuclei,\nneither of these observables can be well explained by common assumptions for\nthe nuclear dependence.

We study the prospects of this resolution by the current T2K and\nupcoming NOvA experiments. Because of the hierarchy-deltacp degeneracy and the\noctant-deltacp degeneracy, the impact of hierarchy on octant resolution has to\nbe taken into account. As in the case of hierarchy determination, there exist\nfavorable (unfavorable) values of deltacp for which octant resolution is easy\n(challenging). However, for octant resolution the unfavorable deltacp values of\nthe neutrino data are favorable for the anti-neutrino data and vice-verse.

General forms of TMD-factorization fail\nfor such processes because of a previously noted incompatibility between the\nrequirements for TMD-factorization and the Ward identities of non-Abelian gauge\ntheories. We first review the basic steps for factorizing the gluon\ndistribution and then show that a conflict between TMD-factorization and the\nnon-Abelian Ward identity arises already at the level of a single extra soft or\ncollinear gluon when the partonic subprocess involves a TMD gluon distribution.\nNext we show that the resulting TMD-factorization violating effects produce\nleading-power final state spin asymmetries that would be classified as\nsubleading in a generalized TMD-factorization framework.

While the scattering process is governed by the S-matrix the\ninteraction evolves the produced state rho_f(S) to observed state rho_f(O). To\nbe consistent with the Standard Model this new interaction must be a pure\ndephasing interaction governed by a non-unitary evolution law modifying the\nphases of the amplitudes. We present the first test of the unitary evolution\nlaw in particle scattering. The unitary evolution law evolves pure initial\nstates into pure final states in exclusive processes. This fact leads to 9\nindependent constraints on 16 components of angular intensities in piN->pipiN\nprocesses. When expressed in terms of P-parity conserving transversity\namplitudes all 9 constraints are identities provided a single constrain on the\ntransversity amplitudes holds true.

We perform a comprehensive study of the\nimplications of such neutrino mass sum rules, which provide a link between\nmodel building, phenomenology, and experiments. After a careful explanation of\nhow to derive predictions from sum rules, we discuss a large number of examples\nboth numerically, using all three global fits available for the neutrino\noscillation data, and analytically wherever possible.

This review is a combination of lectures which discussed the latest\nresults each year at a three year celebration of the 50th anniversary of the\nInternational School of Subnuclear Physics in Erice, Sicily, Italy. Since the\nfirst collisions in the year 2000, RHIC has provided nucleus-nucleus and\npolarized proton-proton collisions over a range of nucleon-nucleon c.m.\nenergies from 7.7 to 510 GeV with nuclei from deuterium to uranium, most often\ngold. The objective was the discovery of the Quark Gluon Plasma, which was\nachieved, and the measurement of its properties, which were much different than\nexpected, namely a `perfect fluid' of quarks and gluons with their color\ncharges exposed rather than a gas. Topics including quenching of light and\nheavy quarks at large transverse momentum, thermal photons, search for a QCD\ncritical point as well as measurements of collective flow, two-particle\ncorrelations and $J/\\Psi$ suppression are presented. During this period,\nresults from the first and subsequent heavy ion measurements at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC) at CERN became available. These confirmed and extended\nthe RHIC discoveries and have led to ideas for new and improved measurements. \n\n"}

We find that for the\ndetermination of CP violation, 540 km baseline with 7 years of neutrino and 3\nyears of anti-neutrino (7nu+3nubar) run-plan performs the best and one expects\na 5sigma sensitivity to CP violation for 48% of true values of deltaCP.

However off-shell Z' exchange may leave an imprint on other kinematic\ndistributions, leading thus to non-resonant searches. The aim of this paper is\nto assess, in the context of the LHC, the interplay between resonant\n(s-channel) and non-resonant (t-channel) searches for a generic leptophobic Z'\nmodel. We show in particular that while non-resonant searches are less\nsensitive to small couplings, they tend to be more adapted at high masses and\nlarge couplings.

{"id": "1409.2496", "contents": "Title: Deconfinement as an entropic self-destruction: a solution for the\n  quarkonium suppression puzzle? Abstract: The entropic approach to dissociation of bound states immersed in strongly\ncoupled systems is developed. In such systems, the excitations of the bound\nstate are often delocalized and characterized by a large entropy, so that the\nbound state is strongly entangled with the rest of the statistical system. If\nthis entropy $S$ increases with the separation $r$ between the constituents of\nthe bound state, $S = S(r)$, then the resulting entropic force $F = T\\\n{\\partial S}/{\\partial r}$ ($T$ is temperature) can drive the dissociation\nprocess. As a specific example, we consider the case of heavy quarkonium in\nstrongly coupled quark-gluon plasma, where lattice QCD indicates a large amount\nof entropy associated with the heavy quark pair at temperatures $0.9\\ T_c \\leq\nT \\leq 1.5\\ T_c$ ($T_c$ is the deconfinement temperature); this entropy $S(r)$\ngrows with the inter-quark distance $r$. We argue that the entropic mechanism\nresults in an anomalously strong quarkonium suppression in the temperature\nrange near $T_c$. This \"entropic self-destruction\" may thus explain why the\nexperimentally measured quarkonium nuclear modification factor at RHIC (lower\nenergy density) is smaller than at LHC (higher energy density), possibly\nresolving the \"quarkonium suppression puzzle\" - all of the previously known\nmechanisms of quarkonium dissociation operate more effectively at higher energy\ndensities, and this contradicts the data. Moreover, we find that near $T_c$ the\nentropic force leads to delocalization of the bound hadron states; we argue\nthat this delocalization may be the mechanism underlying deconfinement. \n\n"}

In general,\nthese models assume that hard process rates and the magnitude of the soft event\nactivity in the underlying $NN$ collisions is uncorrelated. When included,\nthese correlations influence the measured yield in a nominal centrality\ninterval, an effect typically referred to as a \"centrality bias\". In this work,\nthe impact of a positive correlation between the hard scattering yield and the\nunderlying event activity in individual $NN$ collisions is investigated. This\ncorrelation is incorporated into the centrality calculations used by ATLAS and\nPHENIX, both based on a similar Monte Carlo Glauber approach but with different\nmodels of the per-collision or per-participant event activity.

Centrality classes are defined\nusing different event activity estimators, i.e. charged particle multiplicities\nmeasured in three disjunct pseudorapidity regions as well as the energy\nmeasured at beam rapidity (zero-degree). The procedures to determine the\ncentrality, quantified by the number of participants ($N_{\\rm part}$), or the\nnumber of nucleon-nucleon binary collisions ($N_{\\rm coll}$), are described. We\nshow that, in contrast to Pb-Pb collisions, in p-Pb collisions large\nmultiplicity fluctuations together with the small range of participants\navailable, generate a dynamical bias in centrality classes based on particle\nmultiplicity.

The existing background subtraction methods for these studies depend on\nseveral assumptions and independent measurements of the Fourier coefficients of\nthe combinatorial background. In this paper, we present two background\nsubtraction methods which use the observation that the near-side correlation\nsignal is negligible for large separations between the associated particle and\nthe trigger. The combinatorial background is fit in this background-dominated\nregion. Including the reaction plane dependence of the raw correlation improves\nthese results. To test the accuracy of these methods, a simple model is used to\nsimulate di-hadron and jet-hadron correlations with a combinatorial background\nsimilar to that observed in the data. The true signal is compared to the\nextracted signal. The results are compared to results from two variants of the\nZero-Yield-At-Minimum (ZYAM) method.

There is evidence that a Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) was\ncreated at experiments at RHIC and LHC. The transition from the QGP back to the\nhadron gas is found to be a smooth cross over. For larger net-baryon densities\nand lower temperatures, it is expected that the QCD phase diagram exhibits a\nrich structure, such as a first-order phase transition between hadronic and\npartonic matter which terminates in a critical point, or exotic phases like\nquarkyonic matter. The discovery of these landmarks would be a breakthrough in\nour understanding of the strong interaction and is therefore in the focus of\nvarious high-energy heavy-ion research programs. The Compressed Baryonic Matter\n(CBM) experiment at FAIR will play a unique role in the exploration of the QCD\nphase diagram in the region of high net-baryon densities, because it is\ndesigned to run at unprecedented interaction rates.

The spontaneous symmetry breaking is implemented with\ndoublets, triplets and bidoublet scalars.

The presence of extra particles in the model exactly cancels type-I\nseesaw and allows large value for Dirac neutrino mass matrix $M_D$.

The quantities of\nthese elements gauge global radiogenic power, offering insights into the origin\nand thermal history of the Earth. The distributions reveal the initial\npartitioning and subsequent transport of these trace elements between metallic\ncore, silicate mantle, and crust types. Ongoing observations at underground\nsites in Japan and Italy record the energies but not the directions of\ngeo-neutrinos from uranium and thorium.

Current neutrino detectors have so far failed to detect\nsuch a signal, however, and bounds from direct and indirect dark matter\nsearches may significantly restrict the possibility of observing it in future\nexperiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande or IceCube-Gen2. In this work, we assess\nin the light of current data and of expected experimental sensitivities, the\nprospects for the detection of a neutrino signal from dark matter annihilations\nin the Sun. To be as general as possible, equilibrium between the capture and\nthe annihilation rates in the Sun is not assumed in our analysis; instead, the\ndark matter scattering and annihilation cross sections are taken as free and\nindependent parameters. We consider capture via both spin-dependent and\nspin-independent interactions, and annihilations into three representative\nfinal states: $b\\bar b$, $W^+W^-$, and $\\tau^+\\tau^-$. We find that when the\ncapture in the Sun is dominated by spin-independent interactions, current\ndirect detection bounds already preclude the observation of a neutrino signal\nin future experiments.

We propose a parametrization of this functional\ncarefully calibrated and validated on selected ground-state properties that is\nsuitable for large-scale calculations of nuclear properties. The first\ncomponent of this functional is a non-local functional of the density and\ncorresponds to the direct part (Hartree term) of the expectation value of local\nchiral potentials on a Slater determinant.

Unexpected discoveries, such as the\ndiphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the\nconstruction of a photon collider. In order to enable the gamma-gamma collision\noption, the ILC design should be compatible with it from the very beginning. In\nthis paper, we discuss the problem of the beam crossing angle. In the ILC\ntechnical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough\nspace for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions,\nthe crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result\nfrom multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with\nthe opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector\nfield. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.\nIn this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as\nwell as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable\nreduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity. It is shown that the best solution is\nto increase the laser wavelength from the current 1 \\mum (which is optimal for\n2E=500 GeV) to 2 \\mum as this makes possible achieving high gamma-gamma\nluminosities at a crossing angle of 20 mrad, which is also quite comfortable\nfor e+e- collisions, does not cause any degradation of the e+e- luminosity and\nopens the possibility for a more energetic future collider in the same tunnel\n(e.g., CLIC).

The concepts of symmetry breaking and\nrestoration are briefly discussed. We also include an introduction to the\ntime-dependent extension of DFT that, so far, has been implemented essentially\nonly in the adiabatic approximation and has been applied mainly to the study of\nnuclear vibrations. With this material, we hope that any reader is able to deal\nwith the texts that go deeper into each of the topics, having understood that\nDFT is probably the best compromise in nuclear structure theory between\nsimplicity, accuracy, and broad range of applicability. \n\n"}

Using this pipeline, we first characterize the channels of\nnon-hermeticity of DUNE, including subthreshold particles, charge\nrecombination, and nuclear breakup.

It is well known, however, that\nthe quenching of jets from their interaction with the medium leads to a\nmigration of jets from higher to lower $p_T$, making it challenging to directly\ninfer the degree and mechanism of jet energy loss. Our proposed quantile\nmatching procedure is inspired by (but not reliant on) the approximate\nmonotonicity of energy loss in the jet $p_T$. In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$).

In\nthis analysis we express the MNS matrix to leading order in the small angle\n$\\theta_{13}$ including the neutrino {\\em and} charged lepton mixing angles and\nphases, the latter playing a crucial r\\^{o}le for allowing the inverted\nhierarchy case to be consistent with the LMA MSW solution. We then consider the\nsee-saw mechanism with right-handed neutrino dominance and show how the\nsuccessful neutrino mass matrix structures may be constructed with no tuning\nand with small radiative corrections, leading to a full, partial or inverted\nneutrino mass hierarchy. In each case we derive approximate analytic relations\nbetween the input see-saw parameters and the resulting neutrino masses, mixing\nangles and phases, which will provide a useful guide for unified model\nbuilding. For the hierarchical cases the LMA MSW solution gives a soft lower\nbound $|U_{e3}|\\simgt 0.1$, just below the current CHOOZ limit. Both\nhierarchical and inverted hierarchical cases predict small $\\beta \\beta_{0\\nu}$\nwith $|m_{ee}|\\sim 0.01$ eV within the sensitivity of future proposals such as\nGENIUS. Successful leptogenesis is possible if the dominant right-handed\nneutrino is the heaviest one, but the leptogenesis phase is unrelated to the\nMNS phases. \n\n"}

Charm quarks are believed to be mostly created\nfrom initial gluon fusion in heavy ion collisions. Since they are massive,\ncharm hadrons are proposed to be ideal probes to study the early stage dynamics\nin heavy ion collisions.\n  We provide here an indirect measurement of charm semi-leptonic decay. Single\nelectron transverse momentum ($p_T$) distributions from 200 GeV \\dAu, \\pp\ncollisions and 62.4 GeV \\AuAu collisions, and single electron azimuthal\nanisotropy ($v_2$) from 62.4 GeV \\AuAu collisions are presented.

It is found that\nthe in-medium NN cross sections are not only reduced but also have a different\nisospin dependence compared with the free-space ones. Because of the\nneutron-proton effective mass splitting the difference between nn and pp\nscattering cross sections increases with the increasing isospin asymmetry of\nthe medium. Within the transport model IBUU04, the in-medium NN cross sections\nare found to influence significantly the isospin transport in heavy-ion\nreactions. With the in-medium NN cross sections, a symmetry energy of\n$E_{sym}(\\rho)\\approx 31.6(\\rho /\\rho_{0})^{0.69}$ was found most acceptable\ncompared with both the MSU isospin diffusion data and the presently acceptable\nneutron-skin thickness in $^{208}$Pb.
