The effects of the change in the\nunderlying dynamics - ideal fluid dynamics vs. non-equilibrium transport theory\n- will be explored. The freeze-out and initial state parameter dependences are\ninvestigated for different observables. Furthermore, the time evolution of the\nbaryon density and particle yields are discussed. We find that the final pion\nand proton multiplicities are lower in the hybrid model calculation due to the\nisentropic hydrodynamic expansion while the yields for strange particles are\nenhanced due to the local equilibrium in the hydrodynamic evolution. The\nresults of the different calculations for the mean transverse mass excitation\nfunction, rapidity and transverse mass spectra for different particle species\nat three different beam energies are discussed in the context of the available\ndata. \n\n"}

The bulk contribution to NST arises\nfrom an extended sharp radius of neutrons, whereas the surface contribution\narises from different widths of the neutron and proton surfaces. Nuclear models\nwhere the symmetry energy is stiff, as typical relativistic models, predict a\nbulk contribution in NST of 208Pb about twice as large as the surface\ncontribution. In contrast, models with a soft symmetry energy like common\nnonrelativistic models predict that NST of 208Pb is divided similarly into bulk\nand surface parts. Indeed, if the symmetry energy is supersoft, the surface\ncontribution becomes dominant. We note that the linear correlation of NST of\n208Pb with the density derivative of the nuclear symmetry energy arises from\nthe bulk part of NST.

A key enabling element has been the low-energy\ndetection threshold for recoiling nuclei produced by the interaction of WIMPs\nin LXe targets. In these detectors, the nuclear recoil energy scale is based on\nthe LXe scintillation signal and thus requires knowledge of the relative\nscintillation efficiency of nuclear recoils, Leff. The uncertainty in Leff at\nlow energies is the largest systematic uncertainty in the reported results from\nLXe WIMP searches at low masses.

Abstract: Since the 1930s, and with very few exceptions, it has been assumed that the\nprocess of radioactive decay is a random process, unaffected by the environment\nin which the decaying nucleus resides. There have been instances within the\npast few decades, however, where changes in the chemical environment or\nphysical environment brought about small changes in the decay rates. But even\nin light of these instances, decaying nuclei that were undisturbed or\nun-\"pressured\" were thought to behave in the expected random way, subject to\nthe normal decay probabilities which are specific to each nuclide. Moreover,\nany \"non-random\" behavior was assumed automatically to be the fault of the\ndetection systems, the environment surrounding the detectors, or changes in the\nbackground radiation to which the detector was exposed. Recently, however,\nevidence has emerged from a variety of sources, including measurements taken by\nindependent groups at Brookhaven National Laboratory, Physikalisch-Technische\nBundesanstalt, and Purdue University, that indicate there may in fact be an\ninfluence that is altering nuclear decay rates, albeit at levels on the order\nof $10^{-3}$.

In\ncontrasting this behaviour with that produced by a momentum-dependent\ninteraction, one achieves comparisons which highlight that elastic scattering\nand resonance electroproduction experiments probe the infrared evolution of\nQCD's running masses; e.g., the existence, and location if so, of a zero in the\nratio of nucleon Sachs form factors are strongly influenced by the running of\nthe dressed-quark mass.

This is not trivial, since current particle models predict the\npresence of many mechanisms other than the neutrino mass, which may contribute\nor even dominate this process.

(iv)Supersymmetric (SUSY)\ncontributions.

Two problems are considered and are\nrelated to each other: how to report the findings for observed experimental\ndata, and how to evaluate the ability of a future experiment to determine the\nneutrino mass hierarchy, namely, sensitivity of the experiment. For the first\nproblem where experimental data have already been observed, the classical\nstatistical analysis involves constructing confidence intervals for the\nparameter {\\Delta}m^2_{32}. These intervals are deduced from the parent\ndistribution of the estimation of {\\Delta}m^2_{32} based on experimental data.\nDue to existing experimental constraints on |{\\Delta}m^2_{32}|, the estimation\nof {\\Delta}m^2_{32} is better approximated by a Bernoulli distribution (a\nBinomial distribution with 1 trial) rather than a Gaussian distribution.\nTherefore, the Feldman-Cousins approach needs to be used instead of the\nGaussian approximation in constructing confidence intervals. Furthermore, as a\nresult of the definition of confidence intervals, even if it is correctly\nconstructed, its confidence level does not directly reflect how much one\nhypothesis of the MH is supported by the data rather than the other hypothesis.\nWe thus describe a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence provided by\nthe observed experimental data through the (posterior) probability that either\none hypothesis of MH is true. This Bayesian presentation of observed\nexperimental results is then used to develop several metrics to assess the\nsensitivity of future experiments. Illustrations are made using a simple\nexample with a confined parameter space, which approximates the MH\ndetermination problem with experimental constraints on the |{\\Delta}m^2_{32}|. \n\n"}

We calculate the two-gluon production cross section while\nincluding all-order saturation effects in the heavy nucleus with the\nlowest-order rescattering in the lighter nucleus.

The geometric correlations (i) are due to the fact\nthat nucleons are correlated by simply being confined within the same nucleus\nand may lead to long-range rapidity correlations for the produced particles\nwithout strong azimuthal angle dependence.

Thus, dileptons provide ideal penetrating probes that allow\nthe study of such a system throughout its space-time evolution. In the low mass\nrange ($M_{ll}<1.1$ GeV/$c^2$), the dominant source of dileptons originates\nfrom the decay of vector mesons which may see effects from chiral symmetry\nrestoration. In the intermediate mass range ($1.1<M_{ll}<3.0 $ GeV/$c^2$), the\nmain contributions to the mass spectrum are expected to originate from the\nthermal radiation of a quark-gluon plasma as well as the decays of charm\nmesons. In the high mass range ($M_{ll}>3.0$ GeV/$c^2$), dilepton measurements\nare expected to see contributions from primordial processes involving heavy\nquarks, and Drell-Yan production.\n  With the introduction of the Time-of-Flight detector, the STAR detector has\nbeen able to perform large acceptance, high purity electron identification.

In particular, the\nsecond harmonic two-particle cumulants are found to decrease with multiplicity,\ncharacteristic of a dominance of few-particle correlations in p-Pb collisions.\nHowever, when a $|\\Delta \\eta|$ gap is placed to suppress such correlations,\nthe two-particle cumulants begin to rise at high-multiplicity, indicating the\npresence of global azimuthal correlations. The Pb-Pb values are higher than the\np-Pb values at similar multiplicities.

The non-local problem has to do with quark-hadron phase\ntransition where collective behavior through near-neighbor interaction can\ngenerate patterns of varying sizes in the $(\\eta,\\phi)$ space. The two types of\nproblems are put together in this paper both as brief reviews separately and to\ndiscuss how they are related to each other. In particular, we ask how minijets\nproduced at LHC can affect the investigation of multiplicity fluctuations as\nsignals of critical behavior. It is suggested that the existing data from LHC\nhave sufficient multiplicities in small $p_T$ intervals to make feasible the\nobservation of distinctive features of clustering of soft particles, as well as\nvoids, that characterize the critical behavior at phase transition from quarks\nto hadrons, without any ambiguity posed by the clustering of jet particles. \n\n"}

HPXe chambers are capable\nof imaging electron tracks, a feature that enhances the separation between\nsignal events (the two electrons emitted in the 0nbb decay of 136Xe) and\nbackground events, arising chiefly from single electrons of kinetic energy\ncompatible with the end-point of the 0nbb decay (Qbb ). Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction. Due to electron multiple scattering, this\nstrategy is not perfectly efficient on an event-by-event basis, but a\nstatistical estimator can be constructed which can be used to reject background\nevents by one order of magnitude at a moderate cost (approx. 30%) in signal\nefficiency. Combining this estimator with the excellent energy resolution and\ntopological signature identification characteristic of the HPXe TPC, it is\npossible to reach a background rate of less than one count per ton-year of\nexposure. Such a low background rate is an essential feature of the next\ngeneration of 0nbb experiments, aiming to fully explore the inverse hierarchy\nof neutrino masses. \n\n"}

The existing background subtraction methods for these studies depend on\nseveral assumptions and independent measurements of the Fourier coefficients of\nthe combinatorial background.

To test the accuracy of these methods, a simple model is used to\nsimulate di-hadron and jet-hadron correlations with a combinatorial background\nsimilar to that observed in the data.

For a proper interpretation of\nthe data, final-state interactions (FSI) need to be theoretically controlled.\n  Purpose: Our goal is to quantify the role of FSI effects in exclusive\n$A(e,e'pN)$ reactions for four target nuclei representative for the whole mass\nregion. Our focus is on processes that are SRC driven. We investigate the role\nof FSI for two characteristic detector setups corresponding with a \"small\" and\n\"large\" coverage of the available phase space.\n  Results: The transparency $T^{pN}_{A}$, defined as the ratio of exclusive\n$(e,e'pN)$ cross sections on nuclei to those on \"free\" nucleon pairs, drops\nfrom $ 0.2-0.3 $ for $^{12}$C to $0.04-0.07$ for $^{208}$Pb. For all considered\nkinematics, the mass dependence of the $T^{pN}_{A}$ can be captured by the\npower law $T^{pN}_{A} \\propto A^{- \\lambda}$ with $ 0.4 \\lesssim \\lambda\n\\lesssim 0.5 $.

We\nfound that a process of frustrated fragmentation and re-aggregation is a\nprominent mechanism of production of IMFs which can not be assimilated to the\nstatistical decay of a compound nucleus. Very interestingly, this process may\nyield a small number of IMF in the exit channel, which may even reduce to two,\nand be wrongly confused with ordinary asymmetric fission. This interpretation,\ninspired by nuclear-spallation experiments, can be generalised to heavy-ion\ncollisions approaching the fragmentation threshold. \n\n"}

They consist of a core and one or a few nucleons which spend most of\ntheir time in the classically-forbidden region outside the range of the\ninteraction. Individual nucleons inside the core are thus unresolved in the\nhalo configuration, and the low-energy effective interactions are short-range\nforces between the core and the valence nucleons. Similar phenomena occur in\nclusters of $^4$He atoms, cold atomic gases near a Feshbach resonance, and some\nexotic hadrons. In these weakly-bound quantum systems universal scaling laws\nfor s-wave binding emerge that are independent of the details of the\ninteraction. Effective field theory (EFT) exposes these correlations and\npermits the calculation of non-universal corrections to them due to\nshort-distance effects, as well as the extension of these ideas to systems\ninvolving the Coulomb interaction and/or binding in higher angular-momentum\nchannels. Halo nuclei exhibit all these features. Halo EFT, the EFT for halo\nnuclei, has been used to compute the properties of single-neutron, two-neutron,\nand single-proton halos of s-wave and p-wave type. This review summarizes these\nresults for halo binding energies, radii, Coulomb dissociation, and radiative\ncapture, as well as the connection of these properties to scattering\nparameters, thereby elucidating the universal correlations between all these\nobservables. We also discuss how Halo EFT's encoding of the long-distance\nphysics of halo nuclei can be used to check and extend ab initio calculations\nthat include detailed modeling of their short-distance dynamics. \n\n"}

As this QCD\ninterference does not depend on the strong coupling constant, it is part of the\nno-interaction baseline that needs to be controlled prior to searching for\nother manifestations of collective dynamics. Here, we introduce a model that is\nbased on the QCD theory of multi-parton interactions and that allows one to\nstudy interference effects in the production of $m$ particles in hadronic\ncollisions with $N$ parton-parton interactions (\"sources\"). In an expansion in\npowers of $1/(N_c^2-1)$ and to leading order in the number of sources $N$, we\ncalculate interference effects in the $m$-particle spectra and we determine\nfrom them the second and fourth order cumulant momentum anisotropies $v_n$.\nWithout invoking any azimuthal asymmetry and any density dependent non-linear\ndynamics in the incoming state, and without invoking any interaction in the\nfinal state, we find that QCD interference alone can give rise to values for\n$v_n\\lbrace 2\\rbrace$ and $v_n\\lbrace 4\\rbrace$, $n$ even, that persist\nunattenuated for increasing number of sources, that may increase with\nincreasing multiplicity and that agree with measurements in proton-proton (pp)\ncollisions in terms of the order of magnitude of the signal and the approximate\nshape of the transverse momentum dependence.

A non-zero asymmetry is\nevidence of hard two-photon exchange, which has been hypothesized to cause the\ndiscrepancy in measurements of the proton's electromagnetic form factors.\nAlternating electron and positron beams, accelerated to 2 GeV, were directed\nthrough a windowless, gaseous, hydrogen target, and the scattered lepton and\nrecoiling proton were detected in coincidence using a large acceptance magnetic\nspectrometer. Determining the relative integrated luminosity between the\nelectron and positron data sets was critical, and a new technique, involving\nmulti-interaction events, was developed to achieve the desired sub-percent\naccuracy. A detailed Monte Carlo simulation was built in order to reproduce the\nconvolution of systematic effects at every stage of the experiment. The first\nstage in the simulation was new radiative event generator, which permitted the\nfull simulation of the non-trivial, radiative corrections to the measurement.\nThe analysis of the data and simulation showed that the lepton sign asymmetry\nrises by several percent between a momentum transfer of 0.5 GeV$^2/c^2$ and\n2.25 GeV$^2/c^2$. This rise as a function of increasing momentum transfer\nconfirms that two photon exchange at least partially contributes to the proton\nform factor discrepancy. \n\n"}

We focus on the fragments'\nproperties at the breakup stage, before they have time to deexcite by particle\nemission. Since the adopted model provides the excitation energy distribution\nof these primordial fragments, it allows one to calculate the temperatures of\ndifferent isotope families and infer on the sensitivity to their isospin\ncomposition. It is found that, due to the functional form of the nuclear\ndensity of states and the excitation energy distribution of the fragments,\nproton rich isotopes are hotter than neutron rich ones. This property has been\ntaken to be an indication of earlier emission of the former from a source that\ncools down as it expands and emits fragments. Although this scenario is\nincompatible with the prompt breakup of a thermally equilibrated source, our\nresults reveal that the latter framework also provides the same qualitative\nfeatures just mentioned.

However, contrary to the naive expectation, the hydrodynamics-type\nflow is found to contribute more to the final state charm $v_{2}$ than light\nquark $v_{2}$. This could be explained by the smaller average deflection angle\nthe heavier charm quark undergoes in each collision, so that heavy quarks need\nmore scatterings to accumulate a significant $v_{2}$, while lighter quarks can\nmore easily change directions with scatterings with their $v_{2}$ coming more\nfrom the escape mechanism. Our finding thus suggests that the charm $v_{2}$ is\na better probe for studying the hydrodynamic properties of the quark-gluon\nplasma. \n\n"}

We consider\nthe possibility that black hole formation happens when the flux of neutrinos is\nstill measurably high. If this occurs, then the neutrino signal from the\nsupernova will be terminated abruptly (the transition takes $\\lesssim 0.5$ ms).\nThe properties and duration of the signal before the cutoff are important\nmeasures of both the physics and astrophysics of the cooling proto-neutron\nstar. For the event rates expected in present and proposed detectors, the\ncutoff will generally appear sharp, thus allowing model-independent\ntime-of-flight mass tests for the neutrinos after the cutoff. If black hole\nformation occurs relatively early, within a few ($\\sim 1$) seconds after core\ncollapse, then the expected luminosities are of order $L_{BH} = 10^{52}$ erg/s\nper flavor. In this case, the neutrino mass sensitivity can be extraordinary.\nFor a supernova at a distance $D = 10$ kpc, SuperKamiokande can detect a\n$\\bar{\\nu}_e$ mass down to 1.8 eV by comparing the arrival times of the\nhigh-energy and low-energy neutrinos in $\\bar{\\nu}_e + p \\to e^+ + n$.

Assuming that $\\nu_\\mu$ and\n$\\nu_\\tau$ are nearly degenerate, as suggested by the atmospheric neutrino\nresults, masses down to about 6 eV can be probed with a proposed lead detector\nof mass $M_D = 4$ kton (OMNIS).

Indeed the solar energetic (E_p > 100 MeVs)\nflare particles (protons, alpha) while scattering among themselves or hitting\nthe solar atmosphere must produce on sun prompt charged pions, whose decay (as\nwell as their sequent muon decays) into secondaries is source of a copious\nsolar neutrino \"flare\" (at tens or hundreds MeV energy). These brief (minutes)\nneutrino \"burst\" at largest flare peak may overcome by three to five order of\nmagnitude the steady atmospheric neutrino noise on the Earth, possibly leading\nto their emergence and detection above the thresholds. The largest prompt\n\"burst\" solar neutrino flare may be detected in future FLARE neutrino detectors\nboth in electron and positron and possibly in its muon pair neutrino component.\nOur estimate for the recent and exceptional October - November 2003 solar\nflares and last January 20th 2005 exceptional flare might lead to a few events\nfor future FLARE or near unity for present Super-KamiokandeII.

Abstract: The onset of thermalization in heavy ion collisions in the weak coupling\nframework can be viewed as a transition from the initial state Color Glass\nCondensate dynamics, characterized by the energy density scaling like $\\epsilon\n\\sim 1/\\tau$ with $\\tau$ the proper time, to the hydrodynamics-driven expansion\nof the quark-gluon plasma with $\\epsilon \\sim 1/\\tau^{4/3}$ (or higher power of\n$1/\\tau$ for the boost non-invariant case). We argue that, at any order of the\nperturbative expansion in the QCD coupling constant, the gluon field generated\nin an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision leads to energy density scaling as\n$\\epsilon \\sim 1/\\tau$ for late times $\\tau \\gg 1/Q_s$. Therefore it is likely\nthat thermalization and hydrodynamic description of the gluon system produced\nin heavy ion collisions can not result from perturbative QCD diagrams at these\nlate times. At earlier times with $\\tau \\sim 1/Q_s$ the subleading corrections\nto $\\epsilon$ in $1/\\tau$ expansion (terms scaling like $\\sim\n1/\\tau^{1+\\Delta}$ with $\\Delta >0$) may become important possibly leading to\nhydrodynamic-like behavior of the gluon system. Still, we show that such\ncorrections do not contribute to the particle production cross section, and are\nlikely to be irrelevant for physical observables. We generalize our results by\nincluding massless quarks into the system. Thus, it appears that the apparent\nthermalization of quarks and gluons, leading to success of Bjorken\nhydrodynamics in describing heavy ion collisions at RHIC, can only be\nattributed to the non-perturbative QCD effects. \n\n"}

We find that the longitudinal\nresponse function for these nuclei is \"quenched\" and that the Coulomb sum is\nnot saturated, at odds with claims in the literature. \n\n"}

The identification of particles relies on three different methods:\nlow momentum particles stopping in the first detector layers; the specific\nenergy loss (dE/dx) in the silicon Spectrometer, and Time-of-Flight\nmeasurement. These methods cover the transverse momentum ranges 0.03-0.2,\n0.2-1.0 and 0.5-3.0 GeV/c, respectively. Baryons are found to have\nsubstantially harder transverse momentum spectra than mesons.

Many different phenomena can lead both to\nthe creation and to the suppression of a fluctuation peak. In particular, the\nrole of constraints due to conservation laws and to data sorting is shown to be\nessential. From the experimental point of view, a comparison of the available\nfragmentation data reveals that there is a good agreement between different\ndata sets of basic fluctuation observables, if the fragmenting source is of\ncomparable size. This compatibility suggests that the fragmentation process is\nlargely independent of the reaction mechanism (central versus peripheral\ncollisions, symmetric versus asymmetric systems, light ions versus heavy ion\ninduced reactions).

Collective degrees of freedom\ngovern essential aspects of nuclear structure, and for several decades the\nstudy of collective modes such as rotations and vibrations has played a vital\nrole in our understanding of complex properties of nuclei. The multipole\nresponse of unstable nuclei and the possible occurrence of new exotic modes of\nexcitation in weakly-bound nuclear systems, present a rapidly growing field of\nresearch, but only few experimental studies of these phenomena have been\nreported so far. Valuable data on the evolution of the low-energy dipole\nresponse in unstable neutron-rich nuclei have been gathered in recent\nexperiments, but the available information is not sufficient to determine the\nnature of observed excitations. Even in stable nuclei various modes of giant\ncollective oscillations had been predicted by theory years before they were\nobserved, and for that reason it is very important to perform detailed\ntheoretical studies of the evolution of collective modes of excitation in\nnuclei far from stability.

At high temperatures\n(above the critical temperature T_c) we use the sound velocity function\nobtained from the recent lattice simulations of QCD, whereas at low\ntemperatures we use the ideal hadron gas model.

The signal\nshould be observable even if multiple domains of D$\\chi$C form provided the\naverage number of pions per domain is significantly larger than unity. The\nvariance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used\neven if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On\nthe other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral\npions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic\nregions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.\nHere we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts\nin the data. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$\npions with lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R>$\ncan be substantially different from 1/3. For example, for a single D$\\chi$C\ndomain without contamination due to incoherently emitted pions, $<R>$ is 3/5\ngiven the pion with lowest $p_T$ is neutral, and 5/7 given the two pions with\nlowest $p_T$ are both neutral, {\\it etc.}.
