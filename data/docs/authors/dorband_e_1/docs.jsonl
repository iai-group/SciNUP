For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\nchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are\nnot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\nexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA. \n\n"}

This letter proposes a new\nmethod for measuring the EoS of dark energy by using the gravitational waves\n(GW) of black hole binaries. The method described here offers an alternative to\nthe standard way of large scale surveys.\n  It is well known that the mass of a black hole changes due to the accretion\nof dark energy but at an extremely slow rate. However, a binary of supermassive\nblack holes (SBH) radiates gravitational waves with a power proportional to the\nmasses of these accreting stars and thereby carries information on dark energy.\nThese waves can propagate through the vastness of structure in the universe\nunimpeded. The orbital changes of the binary, induced by the energy loss from\ngravitational radiation, receive a large contribution from dark energy\naccretion.

We are able to quantitatively define and describe the fully three\ndimensional motion of comparable mass binaries with one black hole spinning and\nexpose an underlying simplicity. To do so, we untangle the dynamics by\ncapturing the motion in the orbital plane. Our results are twofold: (1) We\nderive highly simplified equations of motion in a non-orthogonal orbital basis,\nand (2) we define a complete taxonomy for fully three-dimensional orbits. More\nthan just a naming system, the taxonomy provides unambiguous and quantitative\ndescriptions of the orbits, including a determination of the zoom-whirliness of\nany given orbit. Through a correspondence with the rationals, we are able to\nshow that zoom-whirl behavior is prevalent in comparable mass binaries in the\nstrong-field regime.

Under the assumption of\nself-similar evolution and constant scatter in the scaling relations, and for a\nflat LCDM model, we measure gamma(sigma_8/0.8)^6.8=0.55+0.13-0.10, with\n0.79<sigma_8<0.89. Relaxing the assumptions on the scaling relations by\nintroducing two additional parameters to model possible evolution in the\nnormalization and scatter of the luminosity-mass relation, we obtain consistent\nconstraints on gamma that are only ~20% weaker than those above. Allowing the\ndark energy equation of state, w, to take any constant value, we simultaneously\nconstrain the growth and expansion histories, and find no evidence for\ndepartures from either GR or LCDM.

The investigation is carried out by\nmeans of comparative analysis of mathematical properties of time evolution of\nvariables in classical model and wave function of universe in quantum level.

Here we\nfurther develop a practical `$m$-mode regularization' scheme for SF\ncalculations, and give details of a first implementation. The key steps in the\nmethod are (i) removal of a singular part of the perturbation field with a\nsuitable `puncture' to leave a sufficiently regular residual within a finite\nworldtube surrounding the particle's worldline, (ii) decomposition in azimuthal\n($m$-)modes, (iii) numerical evolution of the $m$-modes in 2+1D with a finite\ndifference scheme, and (iv) reconstruction of the SF from the mode sum. The\nmethod relies on a judicious choice of puncture, based on the\nDetweiler--Whiting decomposition.

The dissipative piece of the SF displays an exponentially\nconvergent mode sum, while the $m$-mode sum for the conservative piece\nconverges with a power law.

Abstract: In this paper we study gravitational lensing in the strong field limit from\nthe perspective of cosmic censorship, to investigate whether or not naked\nsingularities, if at all they exist in nature, can be distinguished from black\nholes. We study the gravitational lensing in the strong field regime in the JMN\nspacetime, a spherically symmetric geometry that contains a naked singularity\nand which matches smoothly with Schwarzschild metric beyond a finite radius.\nThis metric is a toy model which was shown recently to be the end state of\ngravitational collapse. In the presence of the photon sphere gravitational\nlensing signature of this spacetime is identical to that of Schwarzschild black\nhole with infinitely many relativistic images and Einstein rings, all of them\nlocated beyond a certain critical angle from optic axis and the inner\nrelativistic images all clumped together.

Abstract: Over the past couple of years, a number of observational studies have\nconfirmed the flattening of the radial velocity dispersion profiles for stars\nin various nearby globular clusters. As the projected radial coordinate is\nincreased, a radius appears beyond which, the measured velocity dispersion\nceases to drop and settles at a fixed value, $\\sigma_{\\infty}$. Under Newtonian\ngravity, this is explained by invoking tidal heating from the overall Milky Way\npotential on the outer, more loosely bound stars, of the globular clusters in\nquestion. From the point of view of modified gravity theories, such an outer\nflattening is expected on crossing the critical acceleration threshold $a_{0}$,\nbeyond which, a transition to MONDian dynamics is expected, were equilibrium\nvelocities cease to be a function of distance. In this paper we attempt to sort\nout between the above competing explanations, by looking at their plausibility\nin terms of an strictly empirical approach.

In particular, it enables us to compute the\ncurvature perturbation, {\\zeta}, on large scales without actually solving\nperturbed field equations. However, people often wonder why this is the case.\nIn order for this approach to be valid, the perturbed Hamiltonian constraint\nand matter-field equations on large scales must, with a suitable choice of\ncoordinates, take on the same forms as the corresponding unperturbed equations.\nWe find that this is possible when (1) the unperturbed metric is given by a\nhomogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric; and (2)\non large scales and with a suitable choice of coordinates, one can ignore the\nshift vector (g0i) as well as time-dependence of tensor perturbations to\ngij/a2(t) of the perturbed metric.

By analyzing strictly classically (and in two different gauges to\nensure consistency) the density evolution of the smoothest possible\npre-inflationary component -- thermal radiation -- it is found that the O(1)\nstatistical fluctuations on the thermal wavelength scale present formidable\nobstacles to the linear theory of amplitude growth by the end of inflation.\nSince this wavelength scale exited the horizon at an early stage of inflation,\nit severely limits the number of e-folds of perturbative inflation.

With six spacecraft the constellation is able\nto remove laser frequency noise and acceleration disturbances from the\ngravitational wave signal without needing LISA-like drag-free control, thereby\nsimplifying the payloads and placing less stringent demands on the thrusters.\nWe generalize LISA's time-delay interferometry to displacement-noise free\ninterferometry (DFI) by deriving a set of generators for those combinations of\nthe data streams that cancel laser and acceleration noise. However, the\nthree-dimensional configuration makes orbit selection complicated. So far, only\na halo orbit near the Lagrangian point L1 has been found to be stable enough,\nand this allows only short arms up to 1400 km.

Rather the emission domain lies just outside a\ntimelike Marginal Outer Trapped Surface that is locally defined. The emission\ndomain is mainly located inside the event horizon. A spacelike singularity\nforms behind the event horizon, and most of the Hawking radiation ends up at\nthis singularity rather than at infinity. Whether any Hawking radiation reaches\ninfinity depends on the relation between the emission domain and the event\nhorizon.

In this article we consider the case of arbitrary\nfields or matter described by an unspecified, general energy-momentum tensor\n$T_{\\mu \\nu}$ and show that the necessary and sufficient condition for\nextraction of a black hole's rotational energy is analogous to that in the\nmechanical Penrose process: absorption of negative energy and negative angular\nmomentum.

The electric charge $Q$ of rotating regular black hole decreases the\npotential of the gravitational field and the particle needs less bound energy\nat the circular geodesics. This causes the increase of efficiency of the energy\nextraction through BSW process in the presence of the electric charge $Q$ from\nrotating regular black hole. It has been shown that the efficiency of the\nenergy extraction from the rotating regular black hole via the Penrose process\ndecreases with the increase of the electric charge $Q$ and is smaller with\ncompare to 20.7% which is the value for the extreme Kerr black hole with the\nspecific angular momentum $a=1$. \n\n"}

The number of observable\ngravitational wave sources scales as the product of the volume of space to\nwhich the detector is sensitive and the observation time, so the goal of\ncommissioning is to improve the detector sensitivity with the least possible\ndetector down time. We demonstrate a method for increasing the number of\nsources observable by such a detector, by assessing the severity of\nnon-astrophysical noise contaminations to efficiently guide commissioning. This\nmethod will be particularly useful in the early stages and during the initial\nscience runs of the aLIGO and adVirgo detectors, as they are brought up to\ndesign performance. \n\n"}

We resolve this conflict by invoking that\nthe Kruskcal coordinates could be no longer proper coordinates at the horizon.\nIn the Hartle-Hawking-Israel state, despite the negative finite proper energy\ndensity at the horizon, the Tolman temperature is divergent there due to the\ninfinite blueshift of the Hawking temperature. However, a consistent\nStefan-Boltzmann law with the Hawking radiation shows that the effective Tolman\ntemperature is eventually finite everywhere and the equivalence principle is\nsurprisingly restored at the horizon. Then, we also show that the firewall\nnecessarily emerges out of the Unruh vacuum, so that the Tolman temperature in\nthe evaporating black hole is naturally divergent due to the infinitely\nblueshifted negative ingoing flux crossing the horizon, whereas the outgoing\nHawking radiation characterized by the effective Tolman temperature indeed\noriginates from the quantum atmosphere, not just at the horizon.

Merger\nsimulations are carried out using N-body algorithms that can follow the\nformation and decay of a black-hole binary and its effect on the surrounding\nstars down to sub-parsec scales. Our initial stellar systems have steep central\ndensity cusps similar to those in low-luminosity elliptical galaxies. Formation\nof a black-hole binary transfers energy to the stars and lowers the central\ndensity; continued decay of the binary creates a ~1/r density cusp similar to\nthose observed in bright elliptical galaxies, with a break radius that extends\nwell beyond the sphere of gravitational influence of the black holes. The decay\nof the black hole binary is followed over a factor of ~20 in separation after\nformation of a hard binary, considerably farther than in previous simulations.\nWe see almost no dependence of the binary's decay rate on number of particles\nin the simulation, contrary to earlier studies in which a lower initial density\nof stars led to a more rapid depletion of the binary's loss cone. We\nnevertheless argue that the decay of a black hole binary in a real galaxy would\nbe expected to stall at separations of 0.01-1 pc unless some additional\nmechanism is able to extract energy from the binary.

This problem is particularly challenging because\nof the vast dynamical range in space which must be covered in the course of\ncol- lapse. We evolve a uniformly rotating SMS from the onset of radial\ninstability at R_{p}/M=411, where R_{p} is the proper polar radius of the star\nand M is the total mass-energy, to the point at which the PN approximation\nbreaks down. We introduce a scale factor and a \"comoving\" coordinate to handle\nthe large varia- tion in radius during the collapse and focus on the central\ncore. Since T/W, the ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the\ngravitational binding energy, is nearly proportional to 1/R_{p} throughout the\ncollapse, the imploding star may ultimately exceed the critical value of T/W\nfor dynamical instability to bar-mode formation. However, for stars rotating\nuniformly at the onset of col- lapse, we do not find any unstable growth of\nbars prior to the termination of our simulation. We do find that the collapse\nis likely to form a supermassive black hole (BH) coherently, with almost all of\nthe matter falling into the hole, leaving very little ejected matter to form a\ndisk. In the absence of nonaxi- symmetric bar formation, the collapse of a\nuniformly rotating SMS does not lead to appreciable quasi-periodic\ngravitational wave (GW) emission by the time our integrations terminate.\nHowever, the coherent nature of the implosion suggests that rotating SMS\ncollapse will be a promising source of GW bursts.

In this paper, I show that this behavior is\ncharacteristic of a larger family of orbits, the ``nearly horizon skimming''\n(NHS) orbits. NHS orbits exist in the very strong field of any black hole with\nspin $a\\agt 0.952412M$. Their unusual behavior is due to the locking of\nparticle motion near the event horizon to the hole's spin, and is therefore a\nsignature of the Kerr metric's extreme strong field. An observational hallmark\nof NHS orbits is that a small body spiraling into a Kerr black hole due to\ngravitational-wave emission will be driven into orbits of progressively smaller\ninclination angle, toward the equator. This is in contrast to the ``normal''\nbehavior. For circular orbits, the change in inclination is very small, and\nunlikely to be of observational importance. I argue that the change in\ninclination may be considerably larger when one considers the evolution of\ninclined eccentric orbits.

In this paper, I investigate the properties of a restricted\nfamily of such inspirals (the inspiral of circular, inclined orbits) with an\neye toward understanding observable properties of the gravitational waves that\nthey generate. Using results previously presented to calculate the effects of\nradiation reaction, I assemble the inspiral trajectories (assuming that\nradiation reacts adiabatically, so that over short timescales the trajectory is\napproximately geodesic) and calculate the wave generated as the compact body\nspirals in. I do this analysis for several black hole spins, sampling a range\nthat should be indicative of what spins we will encounter in nature. The spin\nhas a very strong impact on the waveform. In particular, when the hole rotates\nvery rapidly, tidal coupling between the inspiraling body and the event horizon\nhas a very strong influence on the inspiral time scale, which in turn has a big\nimpact on the gravitational wave phasing.

Contrary to previous numerical approaches to this problem, we do\nnot solve only the constraint equations but rather a set of five equations for\nthe lapse function, the conformal factor and the shift vector.

Unfortunately, the type\nof the ADM equations is not well understood and therefore we shall discuss, in\nthe next section, the concept of wellposedness. We have to distinguish between\nweakly and strongly hyperbolic systems. Strongly hyperbolic systems are well\nbehaved even if we add lower order terms.

The\nfield-theoretical formulation of general relativity helped us to identify the\nphenomenological seeds of such modifications.

There exists an analogy between the motion of\nfree masses in the field of a gravitational wave and the motion of free charges\nin the field of an electromagnetic wave. In particular, a gravitational wave\ndrives the masses in the plane of the wave-front and also, to a smaller extent,\nback and forth in the direction of the wave's propagation. To describe this\nmotion, we introduce the notion of `electric' and `magnetic' components of the\ngravitational force.

The orbits of the\ninspiraling COs are highly complicated; they can remain rather eccentric up\nuntil the final plunge, and display extreme versions of relativistic perihelion\nprecession and Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital plane.

The associated template waveforms are not yet in\nhand, but theorists will very likely be able to provide them before LISA\nlaunches.

We study then the linearisation of generic actions of\nthe form L=F[R,P,Q] where P=R_{ab}R^{ab} and Q=R_{abcd}R^{abcd}. We show that\nfor the case in which F[R,P,Q]=F[R,Q-4P], the theory is ghost free.

It is shown how the decoherence functional of\na closed quantum system may be regarded as an Hermitian form on the space of\nlinear operators on the Hilbert space of the system. This identification makes\nmanifest a number of structural properties of decoherence functionals. For\nexample, a bound on the maximum number of histories in a consistent set is\ndetermined. When the decoherence functional is positive -- as in conventional\nquantum mechanics -- it defines a semi-inner product on the space of history\noperators. This shows that consistent sets of histories are just orthogonal\nsets in this inner product. It further implies the existence in general of\nCauchy-Schwarz and triangle inequalities for positive decoherence functionals.\nThe geometrical significance of the ILS theorem classifying all possible\ndecoherence functionals is illuminated, and a version of the ILS theorem for\ndecoherence functionals on class operators is given. The class of history\noperators consistent according to a given decoherence functional is found, and,\nconversely, it is shown how to construct the decoherence functionals according\nto which a given set of histories is consistent. More generally, the\n\"geometric\" point of view here developed supplies a powerful unified language\nwith which to solve problems in generalized quantum theory. \n\n"}
