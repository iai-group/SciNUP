Typically a wall will prefer\none of the phases, and hence the composition of the system in the direction\nperpendicular to the walls will not be homogeneous. If both walls are of the\nsame kind, this effect leads to a distortion of the phase diagram of the system\nin thin film geometry, in comparison with the bulk, analogous to the phenomenon\nof \"capillary condensation\" of simple fluids in thin capillaries. In the case\nof \"competing walls\", where both walls prefer different phases of the two\nphases coexisting in the bulk, a state with an interface parallel to the walls\ngets stabilized.

The emphasis is on strongly\nnonlinear materials containing pores or rigid inclusions. Full-field numerical\nsimulations are carried out using a Fast-Fourier Transform algorithm [H.\nMoulinec, P. Suquet, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris II 318, 1417 (1994)], while the\ntheoretical results are obtained by means of the `second-order' nonlinear\nhomogenization method [P. Ponte Castaneda, J. Mech. Phys. Solids 50, 737\n(2002)]. The effect of nonlinearity and inclusion concentration is investigated\nin the context of power-law (with strain-rate sensitivity m) behavior for the\nmatrix phase under in-plane shear loadings. Overall, the `second-order'\nestimates are found to be in good agreement with the numerical simulations,\nwith the best agreement for the rigidly reinforced materials. For the porous\nsystems, as the nonlinearity increases (m decreases), the strain field is found\nto localize along shear bands passing through the voids (the strain\nfluctuations becoming unbounded) and the effective stress exhibits a singular\nbehavior in the dilute limit. More specifically, for small porosities and fixed\nnonlinearity m>0, the effective stress decreases linearly with increasing\nporosity. However, for ideally plastic behavior (m = 0), the dependence on\nporosity becomes non-analytic. On the other hand, for rigidly-reinforced\ncomposites, the strain field adopts a tile pattern with bounded strain\nfluctuations, and no singular behavior is observed (to leading order) in the\ndilute limit. \n\n"}

The effective Hamitonian is the analogue to the first graphene\nquantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) Hamiltonian. Similar to graphene model, the\neffective SOC in low-buckled geometry opens a gap at Dirac points and\nestablishes QSHE. The effective SOC actually contains first order in the atomic\nintrinsic SOC strength $\\xi_{0}$, while such leading order contribution of SOC\nvanishes in planar structure. Therefore, silicene as well as low-buckled\ncounterparts of graphene for other group IVA elements Ge and Sn has much larger\ngap opened by effective SOC at Dirac points than graphene due to low-buckled\ngeometry and larger atomic intrinsic SOC strength. Further, the more buckled is\nthe structure, the greater is the gap. Therefore, QSHE can be observed in\nlow-buckled Si, Ge, and Sn systems in an experimentally accessible temperature\nregime.

In particular, samarium hexaboride (SmB$_6$) has drawn much\nattention as it might represent a new class of condensed matter called\ntopological Kondo insulator. Kondo insulators (KI) can have non-trivial Z$_2$\ntopology because the energy gap opens at the Fermi energy ($E_F$) by\nhybridization between an odd- parity renormalized $f$ band and an even- parity\nconduction $d$ band. However, the characteristics of SmB$_6$ deviate from the\nconventional KI because its gap is insensitive to doping and pressure. Thus, it\nis unclear what makes the gap of SmB$_6$ different from that of KI, and how the\nband inversion features occur. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the\nimportance of charge fluctuations in SmB$_6$. Our angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) results reveal that with decreasing temperature the bottom\nof the $d$-$f$ hybridized band at the $\\bar{\\text{X}}$ point gradually shifts\nfrom below to above $E_F$. This shift accompanies a redistribution of spectral\nweight from the upper to the lower quasiparticle band, and reflects the change\nin both carrier density and the number of localized $f$ electron. Moreover,\nbecause this hybridized band is predicted to have odd parity and to induce a\nnon-trivial $Z_{2}$ topology, we compare our ARPES spectra with theoretical\nsurface band structures and find signatures of topological surface states.\nTherefore, our results indicate that SmB$_6$ is a charge fluctuating\ntopological insulator having the odd-parity hybridized band above $E_F$ at the\n$X$ point. This demonstrates that the charge fluctuations do not only drive the\ninsulating bulk phase but also the non-trivial topological phase. \n\n"}

The optical behaviour is\nqualitatively obtained through transmission and reflection coefficients which\nare a function of the third order non-linear susceptibility of the Kerr-type\ndielectric and the inter-band optical conductivity of the TMDC mono-layer. The\ninter-band optical conductivity of the TMCD mono-layer is calculated using the\nKubo formalism from linear response theory. In particular, we theoretically\ndemonstrate that the optical response of this arrangement can be switched\nbetween total internal reflection and a normal transmission regime by\ncontrolling the intensity of the incident radiation. The reflection and\ntransmission functions, additionally, are shown to be amenable to further\ncontrol by altering the inter-band optical conductivity of the embedded TMDC\nmono-layer. The optical conductivity is an outcome of its energy dispersion; we\nspecifically choose two TMDC mono-layers, MoS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$, which have\nnearly identical dispersion parameters apart from a much stronger spin-orbit\ncoupling in the latter.

An external field removes the spin wave degeneracy and both\nspin wave bands couple to the photons, resulting in two anticrossings between\nthe magnons and photons.

The accuracy of the electronic degrees\nof freedom in extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, with\nrespect to the exact Born-Oppenheimer solution, is of second order in the size\nof the integration time step and of fourth order in the potential energy\nsurface. Improved stability over recent formulations of extended Lagrangian\nBorn-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics is achieved by generalizing the theory to\nfinite temperature ensembles, using fractional occupation numbers in the\ncalculation of the inner-product kernel of the extended harmonic oscillator\nthat appears as a preconditioner in the electronic equations of motion.\nMaterials systems that normally exhibit slow self-consistent field convergence\ncan be simulated using integration time steps of the same order as in direct\nBorn-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, but without the requirement of an\niterative, non-linear electronic ground state optimization prior to the force\nevaluations and without a systematic drift in the total energy.

The first part formally\nscales as the fifth power of the system size while the second has a much\ngentler cubic scaling.

This maps the\ncalculated activity into a probability distribution, and can be used to\ncalculate the expectation value of the distribution, termed as the expected\nactivity. We prove that the ability to distinguish materials increases with\nreducing uncertainty. We define a quantity, prediction efficiency, which\nprovides a precise measure of the ability to distinguish the activity of\nmaterials for a reaction scheme over an activity range. We demonstrate the\nframework for 4 important electrochemical reactions, hydrogen evolution,\nchlorine evolution, oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution.

Despite the vanishing net magnetic moment, we\ncalculate a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of about 300 S/cm. It\nderives from the Berry curvature distribution of the Weyl points, which are\nonly 14 meV away from the Fermi level and isolated from trivial bands.\nDifferent from antiferromagnets Mn3X (X= Ge, Sn, Ga, Ir, Rh, and Pt), where the\nAHE originates from the non-collinear magnetic structure, the AHE in Ti2MnAl\nstems directly from the Weyl points and is topologically protected. The large\nanomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) together with a low charge carrier\nconcentration should give rise to a large anomalous Hall angle. In contrast to\nthe Co-based ferromagnetic Heusler compounds, the Weyl nodes in Ti2MnAl do not\nderive from nodal lines due to the lack of mirror symmetries in the inverse\nHeusler structure.

Scanning a clean anatase (101)\nsurface at a sample bias greater than +4.3 V results in surface VOs in the\nscanned area, suggesting that subsurface VOs migrate back to the surface. To\ntest this hypothesis, surface VOs were first created through bombardment with\nenergetic electrons. The sample was then mildly annealed, which caused the VOs\nto move to the subsurface region, where they formed vacancy clusters. These VO\nclusters have various, distinct shapes. Scanning VO clusters with a high STM\nbias reproducibly converts them back into groupings of surface VO, with a\nconfiguration that is characteristic for each type of cluster. The dependence\nof the subsurface-to-surface VO migration on the applied STM bias voltage,\ntunneling current, and sample temperature was investigated systematically. The\nresults point towards a key role of energetic, 'hot' electrons in this process.\nThe findings are closely related to the memristive behavior of oxides and\noxygen diffusion in solid-oxide membranes. \n\n"}

This atypical\nconverging electron flow emerges by applying uniaxial tension out of the\ndevice's symmetry axes. A part of electron flow needs to be positively\nrefracted for focusing in an asymmetric spot, whose location is tunable with\nthe strain. In AVLs, Klein tunneling is angularly shifted regards to the normal\nincidence. This perfect transmission occurs at the straight line that connects\nthe point source and focus, which is unaffected by variation of the Fermi level\nand barrier's width. Moreover, the mirror symmetry breaking by the strain also\ncauses the asymmetry in Fabry-P\\'erot interference.

We study from first principles the\nfermiology and phonon dispersion of three representative single-layer\ntransition metal disulfides with different occupation of the $t_{2g}$ subshell:\nTaS$_2$ ($t_{2g}^1$), WS$_2$ ($t_{2g}^2$), and ReS$_2$ ($t_{2g}^3$) across a\nbroad range of doping levels. While strong electron-phonon interactions are at\nthe heart of these instabilities, we argue that away from half-filling of the\n$t_{2g}$ subshell, the doping dependence of the calculated CDW wave vector can\nbe explained from simple fermiology arguments, so that a weak-coupling nesting\npicture is a useful starting point for understanding.
