I explore the mathematical support for this idea on\nan abstract vector space model, covering several forms of data analysis\n(information retrieval, data mining, collaborative filtering, formal concept\nanalysis...), and roughly based on an idea from categorical quantum mechanics.\nIt turns out that quantum (i.e., noncommutative) probability distributions\narise already in this rudimentary mathematical framework. We show that a\nBell-type inequality must be satisfied by the standard similarity measures, if\nthey are used for preference predictions. The fact that already a very general,\nabstract version of the vector space model yields simple counterexamples for\nsuch inequalities seems to be an indicator of a genuine need for quantum\nstatistics in data analysis. \n\n"}

The definitions of\n$\\epsilon$-interleavings and $d_I$ generalize readily to multidimensional\npersistence modules. In this paper, we develop the theory of multidimensional\ninterleavings, with a view towards applications to topological data analysis.\nWe present four main results. First, we show that on 1-D persistence modules,\n$d_I$ is equal to the bottleneck distance $d_B$. This result, which first\nappeared in an earlier preprint of this paper, has since appeared in several\nother places, and is now known as the isometry theorem. Second, we present a\ncharacterization of the $\\epsilon$-interleaving relation on multidimensional\npersistence modules. This expresses transparently the sense in which two\n$\\epsilon$-interleaved modules are algebraically similar. Third, using this\ncharacterization, we show that when we define our persistence modules over a\nprime field, $d_I$ satisfies a universality property. This universality result\nis the central result of the paper. It says that $d_I$ satisfies a stability\nproperty generalizing one which $d_B$ is known to satisfy, and that in\naddition, if $d$ is any other pseudometric on multidimensional persistence\nmodules satisfying the same stability property, then $d\\leq d_I$. We also show\nthat a variant of this universality result holds for $d_B$, over arbitrary\nfields. Finally, we show that $d_I$ restricts to a metric on isomorphism\nclasses of finitely presented multidimensional persistence modules. \n\n"}

The ternary\nterms are redundant if the category has the Smith is Huq property, which means\nthat two equivalence relations on a given object commute precisely when their\nnormalisations do. In fact, we show that the difference between the Smith\ncommutator of such relations and the Huq commutator of their normalisations is\nmeasured by a ternary commutator, so that the Smith is Huq property itself can\nbe characterised by the relation between the latter two commutators. This\nallows to show that the category of loops does not have the Smith is Huq\nproperty, which also implies that ternary commutators are generally not\ndecomposable into nested binary ones.\n  Thus, in contexts where Smith is Huq need not hold, we obtain a new\ndescription of internal categories, Beck modules and double central extensions,\nas well as a decomposition formula for the Smith commutator.

Other results presented in the thesis are: a new proof to\nthe existence of symplectic realizations (Theorem 0), a normal form theorem for\nsymplectic foliations (Theorem 1), a formal normal form/rigidity result around\nPoisson submanifolds (Theorem 3), and a general construction of tame homotopy\noperators for Lie algebroid cohomology (the Tame Vanishing Lemma). We also\nrevisit Conn's theorem and a theorem of Hamilton on rigidity of foliations. \n\n"}

From a\ncomputational viewpoint, the most favored complexes for this purpose have so\nfar been Vietoris-Rips and witness complexes. While the Vietoris-Rips complex\nis simple to compute and is a good vehicle for extracting topology of sampled\nspaces, its size is huge--particularly in high dimensions. The witness complex\non the other hand enjoys a smaller size because of a subsampling, but fails to\ncapture the topology in high dimensions unless imposed with extra structures.\nWe investigate a complex called the {\\em graph induced complex} that, to some\nextent, enjoys the advantages of both. It works on a subsample but still\nretains the power of capturing the topology as the Vietoris-Rips complex.

{"id": "1304.0664", "contents": "Title: Edge Contractions and Simplicial Homology Abstract: We study the effect of edge contractions on simplicial homology because these\ncontractions have turned to be useful in various applications involving\ntopology. It was observed previously that contracting edges that satisfy the so\ncalled link condition preserves homeomorphism in low dimensional complexes, and\nhomotopy in general. But, checking the link condition involves computation in\nall dimensions, and hence can be costly, especially in high dimensional\ncomplexes. We define a weaker and more local condition called the p-link\ncondition for each dimension p, and study its effect on edge contractions. We\nprove the following: (i) For homology groups, edges satisfying the p- and\n(p-1)-link conditions can be contracted without disturbing the p-dimensional\nhomology group. (ii) For relative homology groups, the (p-1)-, and the\n(p-2)-link conditions suffice to guarantee that the contraction does not\nintroduce any new class in any of the resulting relative homology groups,\nthough some of the existing classes can be destroyed. Unfortunately, the\nsurjection in relative homolgy groups does not guarantee that no new relative\ntorsion is created. (iii) For torsions, edges satisfying the p-link condition\nalone can be contracted without creating any new relative torsion and the\np-link condition cannot be avoided. The results on relative homology and\nrelative torsion are motivated by recent results on computing optimal\nhomologous chains, which state that such problems can be solved by linear\nprogramming if the complex has no relative torsion. Edge contractions that do\nnot introduce new relative torsions, can safely be availed in these contexts. \n\n"}

The OHCP is\nNP-complete, but if the boundary matrix of K is totally unimodular (TU), it\nbecomes solvable in polynomial time when modeled as a linear program (LP).

Representations of $A$ are used in order to give the decomposition\nof ${\\mathcal J}{\\mathcal H}^{2} \\, (V, \\, A)$ as a coproduct over all Jacobi\n$A$-module structures on $V$. The bicrossed product $P \\bowtie Q$ of two\nPoisson algebras recently introduced by Ni and Bai appears as a special case of\nour construction. A new type of deformations of a given Poisson algebra $Q$ is\nintroduced and a cohomological type object $\\mathcal{H}\\mathcal{A}^{2}\n\\bigl(P,\\, Q ~|~ (\\triangleleft, \\, \\triangleright, \\, \\leftharpoonup, \\,\n\\rightharpoonup)\\bigl)$ is explicitly constructed as a classifying set for the\nbicrossed descent problem for extensions of Poisson algebras.

Next, we compute\nthe homology of each subspace in the blowup complex in parallel and then glue\nthese results together in serial.

The\ngeneralized Cartan-Hartogs domain\n$\\big(\\prod_{j=1}^k\\Omega_j\\big)^{{\\mathbb{B}}^{d_0}}(\\mu)$ is defined as the\nHartogs type domain constructed over the product $\\prod_{j=1}^k\\Omega_j$ of\nirreducible bounded symmetric domains $\\Omega_j$ $(1\\leq j \\leq k)$, with the\nfiber over each point $(z_1,...,z_k)\\in \\prod_{j=1}^k\\Omega_j$ being a ball in\n$\\mathbb{C}^{d_0}$ of the radius\n$\\prod_{j=1}^kN_{\\Omega_j}(z_j,\\bar{z_j})^{\\frac{\\mu_j}{2}}$ of the product of\npositive powers of their generic norms.

A decomposition\nspace is a simplicial $\\infty$-groupoid satisfying an exactness condition\nweaker than the Segal condition. Just as the Segal condition expresses\ncomposition, the new condition expresses decomposition. In this paper, we\nintroduce various technical conditions on decomposition spaces. The first is a\ncompleteness condition (weaker than Rezk completeness), needed to control\nsimplicial nondegeneracy. For complete decomposition spaces we establish a\ngeneral M\\\"obius inversion principle, expressed as an explicit equivalence of\n$\\infty$-groupoids. Next we analyse two finiteness conditions on decomposition\nspaces. The first, that of locally finite length, guarantees the existence of\nthe important length filtration on the associated incidence coalgebra. We show\nthat a decomposition space of locally finite length is actually the left Kan\nextension of a semi-simplicial space.

One of its essential parts\nis relativistic description of moving multi-dimensional objects called\nmembranes (or p-branes) in a curved spacetime.

One limitation of the current framework\nis the reliance on metric distances, whereas in many practical applications\nobjects are compared by non-metric dissimilarity measures. Examples are the\nKullback-Leibler divergence, which is commonly used for comparing text and\nimages, and the Itakura-Saito divergence, popular for speech and sound.

An explicit construction of Henriques\nproduces certain Lie $\\infty$-groupoids called `Lie $\\infty$-groups' by\nintegrating finite type Lie $n$-algebras. In order to study the compatibility\nbetween this integration procedure and the homotopy theory of Lie $n$-algebras\nintroduced in the companion paper arXiv:1809.05999, we present a homotopy\ntheory for Lie $\\infty$-groupoids. Unlike Kan simplicial sets and the higher\ngeometric groupoids of Behrend and Getzler, Lie $\\infty$-groupoids do not form\na category of fibrant objects (CFO), since the category of manifolds lacks\npullbacks. Instead, we show that Lie $\\infty$-groupoids form an `incomplete\ncategory of fibrant objects' in which the weak equivalences correspond to\n`stalkwise' weak equivalences of simplicial sheaves. This homotopical structure\nenjoys many of the same properties as a CFO, such as having, in the presence of\nfunctorial path objects, a convenient realization of its simplicial\nlocalization.

The key\nfeature is that the language is comprised of a number of components with\nmultiple (input/output) terminals, each possibly labelled with some type, that\nmay then be connected together along these terminals to form a larger network.\nThe components form hyperedges between labelled vertices, and so a diagram in\nthis language forms a hypergraph. We formalise the compositional structure by\nintroducing the notion of a hypergraph category. Network-style diagrammatic\nlanguages and their semantics thus form hypergraph categories, and semantic\ninterpretation gives a hypergraph functor.\n  The first part of this thesis develops the theory of hypergraph categories.\nIn particular, we introduce the tools of decorated cospans and corelations.\nDecorated cospans allow straightforward construction of hypergraph categories\nfrom diagrammatic languages: the inputs, outputs, and their composition are\nmodelled by the cospans, while the 'decorations' specify the components\nthemselves.

Our slightly enlarged class\nof initial data is still sufficiently regular to ensure both stability and\ndecay properties in the region between the event and cosmological horizons as\nwell as the boundedness and continuous extendibility beyond the Cauchy horizon.\nThis suggests thus that it is finally this class which may provide the correct\nsetting to formulate the genericity condition in strong cosmic censorship. \n\n"}

These tensors, up to sign, are called causal tensors, and we\ndetermine their general properties in dimension N. We prove that rank-2 tensors\nwhich map the null cone on itself are causal. It is known that, to any tensor A\non V there is a corresponding ``superenergy'' (s-e) tensor T{A} which always\nhas the dominant property. We prove that, conversely, any symmetric rank-2\ntensor with the dominant property can be written in a canonical way as a sum of\nN s-e tensors of simple forms. We show that the square of any rank-2 s-e tensor\nis proportional to the metric if N<5, and that this holds for the s-e tensor of\nany simple form for arbitrary N. Conversely, we prove that any symmetric rank-2\ntensor T whose square is proportional to the metric must be, up to sign, the\ns-e of a simple p-form, and that the trace of T determines the rank p of the\nform. This generalises, both with respect to N and the rank p, the classical\nalgebraic Rainich conditions, which are necessary and sufficient conditions for\na metric to originate in some physical field, and has a geometric\ninterpretation: the set of s-e tensors of simple forms is precisely the set of\ntensors which preserve the null cone and its time orientation. It also means\nthat all involutory Lorentz transformations (LT) can be represented as s-e\ntensors of simple forms, and that any rank-2 s-e tensor is the sum of at most N\nconformally involutory LT. Non-symmetric null cone preserving maps are shown to\nhave a causal symmetric part and are classified according to the null\neigenvectors of the skew-symmetric part.

The dissertation gives a description of the topology and\nsymplectic and algebraic geometry of Hitchin's hyperkaehler moduli space M of\nrank 2 Higgs bundles with fixed determinant of odd degree over a fixed Riemann\nsurface. After the long introduction it describes a compactification of M in\ngreat detail, using symplectic cutting (math.AG/9804083). Examining the\ndownward Morse flow of a natural circle action on M it shows the vanishing of\nintersection numbers (math.AG/9805071). Examining the upward Morse flow it\nexplains a set of generators of the cohomology ring and a conjectured explicit\ndescription of the cohomology ring (which was proven in math.AG/0003094). Then\nfinally it introduces the resolution tower for M, and shows that its direct\nlimit is homotopically equivalent with the classifying space of the gauge\ngroup. In turn it yields another proof of the generation theorem (as in\nmath.AG/0003093) and also yields a purely algebraic geometric proof of the\nMumford conjecture about the cohomology ring of the moduli space of rank 2\nstable bundles on curves.
