A key issue in that theory is to extract the gauge\ninvariant degrees of freedom which allow unambiguous comparison between theory\nand experiment. When one goes beyond first (linear) order, the task of writing\nthe Einstein equations expanded to n'th order in terms of quantities that are\ngauge invariant up to terms of higher orders becomes highly non-trivial and\ncumbersome. This fact has prevented progress for instance on the issue of the\nstability of linear perturbation theory and is a subject of current debate in\nthe literature. In this series of papers we circumvent these difficulties by\npassing to a manifestly gauge invariant framework. In other words, we only\nperturb gauge invariant, i.e. measurable quantities, rather than gauge variant\nones. Thus, gauge invariance is preserved non perturbatively while we construct\nthe perturbation theory for the equations of motion for the gauge invariant\nobservables to all orders.

It is common practice to link the concept of cosmic time with a\nspace-time metric set up to describe the universe at large scales, and then\ndefine a cosmic time $t$ as what is measured by a comoving standard clock. We\nwant to examine, however, the physical basis for setting up a comoving\nreference frame and, in particular, what could be meant by a standard clock.\nFor this purpose we introduce the concept of a `core' of a clock (which, for a\nstandard clock in cosmology, is a scale-setting physical process) and we ask if\nsuch a core can--in principle--be found in the available physics contemplated\nin the various `stages' of the early universe.

However,\nthis seems to suggest a rethink of our standard notions of cosmological\nevolution after the end of inflation and before the beginning of BBN. We argue\nthat within classes of realistic string compactifications, there generically\nexists a light modulus with a mass comparable to that of the gravitino which\ngenerates a large late-time entropy when it decays. Therefore, all known\nmechanisms of generating the baryon asymmetry of the Universe in the literature\nhave to take this fact into account. In this work, we find that it is still\npossible to naturally generate the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe as\nwell as light left-handed neutrino masses from a period of Affleck-Dine(AD)\nleptogenesis shortly after the end of inflation, in classes of realistic string\nconstructions with a minimal extension of the MSSM below the unification scale\n(consisting only of right-handed neutrinos) and satisfying certain microscopic\ncriteria described in the text.

The bispectrum of peaks is not only sensitive to that of the underlying\nmatter density fluctuations, but also to the four-point function.

The spectra of several of\nthese gravitational wave backgrounds on subhorizon scales have been extensively\nstudied in the literature. In this paper we analyze the shape and amplitude of\nthe gravitational wave spectrum on scales which are superhorizon at the time of\nproduction. Such gravitational waves are expected from the self ordering of\nrandomly oriented scalar fields which can be present during a thermal phase\ntransition or during preheating after hybrid inflation. We find that, if the\ngravitational wave source acts only during a small fraction of the Hubble time,\nthe gravitational wave spectrum at frequencies lower than the expansion rate at\nthe time of production behaves as $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(f) \\propto f^3$ with an\namplitude much too small to be observable by gravitational wave observatories\nlike LIGO, LISA or BBO.

In particular, the tight infrared color-color\ncorrelation for S0 galaxies alone follows that of the entire Hubble sequence of\nnormal galaxies, roughly in order of galaxy type from ellipticals to spirals to\nirregulars. The specific star formation rate of S0 galaxies estimated from the\n24um luminosity increases with decreasing Ks-band luminosity (or stellar mass)\nfrom essentially zero, as with most massive ellipticals, to rates typical of\nirregular galaxies. Moreover, the luminosities of the many infrared-luminous S0\ngalaxies can significantly exceed those of the most luminous (presumably\npost-merger) E galaxies. Star formation rates in the most infrared-luminous S0\ngalaxies approach 1-10 solar masses per year.

By\nstudying general ultraviolet perturbations in supergravity, we systematically\nincorporate `compactification effects' sourced by supersymmetry breaking in the\ncompact space. Significant contributions to the D3-brane potential, including\nthe leading term in the infrared, arise from imaginary anti-self-dual (IASD)\nfluxes. For an arbitrary Calabi-Yau cone, we determine the most general IASD\nfluxes in terms of scalar harmonics, then compute the resulting D3-brane\npotential. Specializing to the conifold, we identify the operator dual to each\nmode of flux, and for chiral operators we confirm that the potential computed\nin the gauge theory matches the gravity result. The effects of four-dimensional\ncurvature, including the leading D3-brane mass term, arise directly from the\nten-dimensional equations of motion. Furthermore, we show that gaugino\ncondensation on D7-branes provides a local source for IASD flux. This flux\nprecisely encodes the nonperturbative contributions to the D3-brane potential,\nyielding a promising ten-dimensional representation of four-dimensional\nnonperturbative effects.

ETGs with 2.5 x 10^10 M_odot =< M_dyn =< 8.5 x 10^10\nM_odot, show no correlation of age, metallicity, and color gradients wrt mass,\nalthough color gradients still correlate with stellar population parameters,\nand these correlations are independent of each other.

The\nkey ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on\nrelatively short timescales, to a point where the radius is comparable to or\nlarger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a\nconfiguration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to\nsubstantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral\ngrazings in an eccentric system could quickly escalate to a catastrophic\nencounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the\nphotosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, as a result of the primary\nstar increasing its own radius. This is motivated by the case of $\\eta$\nCarinae, where such a collision must have occured if conventional estimates of\nthe present-day orbit are correct, and where brief peaks in the light curve\ncoincide with periastron. Stellar collisions may explain brief recurring LBV\noutbursts like SN 2000ch and SN 2009ip, and perhaps outbursts from relatively\nlow-mass progenitor stars (collisons are not necessarily the exclusive domain\nof very luminous stars).

Motivated by this fact, we\nexplore the possibility of extending the electromagnetic theory by allowing the\nscalar state which is usually eliminated by means of the Lorenz condition to\npropagate, preserving at the same time the dynamics of ordinary transverse\nphotons. We show that the new state cannot be generated by charged currents,\nbut it breaks conformal invariance and can be excited gravitationally. In fact,\nprimordial quantum fluctuations produced during inflation can give rise to\nsuper-Hubble temporal electromagnetic modes whose energy density behaves as a\ncosmological constant. The value of the effective cosmological constant is\nshown to agree with observations provided inflation took place at the\nelectroweak scale. The theory is compatible with all the local gravity tests\nand is free from classical or quantum instabilities. Thus we see that, not only\nthe true nature of dark energy can be established without resorting to new\nphysics, but also the value of the cosmological constant finds a natural\nexplanation in the context of standard inflationary cosmology. On sub-Hubble\nscales, the new state generates an effective charge density which, due to the\nhigh electric conductivity of the cosmic plasma after inflation, gives rise to\nboth vorticity and magnetic fields. Present upper limits on vorticity coming\nfrom CMB anisotropies are translated into lower limits on the present value of\ncosmic magnetic fields.

The\nexcursion set theory is also a powerful formalism to study other properties of\ndark matter halos such as halo bias, accretion rate, formation time, merging\nrate and the formation history of halos.

The dominant source of noise in the power spectrum of the tracers is\ncaused by sampling variance on large scales (where the non-Gaussian signal is\nstrongest) and shot noise arising from their discrete nature.

We obtain\noptical and NIR spectra of the two brightest LyA blobs from Yang et al. sample\nusing the Magellan/MagE and VLT/SINFONI. Both the LyA and Halpha lines confirm\nthat these blobs lie at the survey redshift, z~2.3. Within each blob, we detect\nseveral Halpha sources, which roughly correspond to galaxies seen in HST\nimages. The Halpha detections show that these galaxies have large internal\nvelocity dispersions (130 - 190km/s) and that, in the one system (LAB01), their\nvelocity difference is ~440 km/s. The presence of multiple galaxies within the\nblobs, and those galaxies' large velocity dispersions and large relative\nmotion, is consistent with our previous finding that LyA blobs inhabit massive\ndark matter halos that will evolve into those typical of rich clusters today.\nTo determine whether the gas near the embedded galaxies is predominantly\ninfalling or outflowing, we compare the LyA and Halpha line centers, finding\nthat LyA is not offset (Delta LyA = +0km/s) in LAB01 and redshifted by only\n+230 km/s in LAB02.

One of\nthe key goals of BOSS is to measure the signature of baryon acoustic\noscillations in the distribution of Ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of a\nsample of ~150,000 z>2.2 quasars. Along with measuring the angular diameter\ndistance at z\\approx2.5, BOSS will provide the first direct measurement of the\nexpansion rate of the Universe at z > 2. One of the biggest challenges in\nachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over\n2.2 < z < 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. During the first year\nof the BOSS survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and tested\nto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in this\nredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. To achieve these surface densities,\nthe magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g <= 22.0 or r<=21.85.\nWhile detection of the BAO signature in the Ly-alpha absorption in quasar\nspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysical\nstudies do. We therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targets\ndeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%. This \"CORE\"\nsubsample will be fixed for Years Two through Five of the survey. In this paper\nwe describe the evolution and implementation of the BOSS quasar target\nselection algorithms during the first two years of BOSS operations. We analyze\nthe spectra obtained during the first year. 11,263 new z>2.2 quasars were\nspectroscopically confirmed by BOSS.

The key feature of a curvaton potential which deviates from a\nquadratic is that the curvaton experiences a non-uniform onset of its\noscillation. This sources additional contributions to the resulting density\nperturbations, and we especially find that the non-Gaussianity parameter f_NL\ncan become large with either sign no matter whether the curvaton dominates or\nsubdominates the universe when it decays. Such non-quadratic curvaton\npotentials are required in order to produce a red-tilted density perturbation\nspectrum (without invoking large-field inflation), and are also motivated by\nexplicit curvaton models based on microscopic physics.

Blazars are radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) with a jet\npointing at small angles towards the observer. The overall emitted spectrum is\ntypically non-thermal, and in some cases the emission and/or absorption lines\nare so faint as to prevent the determination of the redshift based on optical\nspectroscopy methods. PKS 0447-439 is a bright blazar recently detected at very\nhigh energy. The redshift of the source is still disputed: a recent spectral\nanalysis reports only a lower limit of z > 1.246, which contradicts the\nprevious measure of z = 0.205 reported in the literature. Aims. We aim to give\na redshift estimate of the blazar PKS 0447-439 based on combined GeV\n(Fermi/LAT) and TeV (H.E.S.S.) observations. Methods. Taking into account the\nabsorption of TeV photons by the interaction with the extragalactic background\nlight (EBL), we applied the method we developed in a previous work to derive\nthe redshift of PKS 0447-439. Moreover, we compiled the overall spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) using optical-UV, soft X-ray, and -ray data, nearly\nsimultaneous to the H.E.S.S. observations at TeV energies. Finally we modelled\nthe spectral energy distribution (SED) within the framework of a homogeneous,\nleptonic synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. Results. Using the recent TeV\nspectrum measured by H.E.S.S. we obtain for PKS 0447-439 a redshift of zrec =\n0.20 \\pm 0.05, which is our estimate on the source distance. This value agrees\nvery well with the value reported in the literature and confirms that our\nmethod can be successfully used to constrain blazars distances.

In doing so, we\nprove that black holes in Einstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons theory\ncan have hair, while neutron stars have no scalar monopole charge, in\ndiametrical opposition to results in scalar-tensor theories.

One such example is the signature of cosmic bubble\ncollisions which arise in models of eternal inflation. The most unambiguous way\nto test these scenarios is to evaluate the full posterior probability\ndistribution of the global parameters defining the theory; however, a direct\nevaluation is computationally impractical on large datasets, such as those\nobtained by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and Planck. A\nmethod to approximate the full posterior has been developed recently, which\nrequires as an input a set of candidate sources which are most likely to give\nthe largest contribution to the likelihood.

Within\nthis volume, very few SNe Ia have been calibrated through classical Cepheids,\nwith uncertainty related to the non-linearity and the metallicity dependence of\ntheir period-luminosity (PL) relation. Although a general consensus on these\neffects is still not achieved, classical Cepheids remain the most used primary\ndistance indicators. A possible extension of these standard candles to further\ndistances would be important. In this context, a very promising new tool is\nrepresented by the ultra-long period (ULP) Cepheids (P \\geq 80 days), recently\nidentified in star-forming galaxies. Only a small number of ULP Cepheids have\nbeen discovered so far.

It is given by the contraction of the Ricci tensor with a tensor\nwhich is inverse to the symmetric, contracted square of the torsion tensor,\n$k_{\\mu\\nu}=S^\\rho_{\\lambda\\mu}S^\\lambda_{\\rho\\nu}$. We vary the total action\nfor the gravitational field and matter with respect to the affine connection,\nassuming that the matter fields couple to the connection only through\n$k_{\\mu\\nu}$. We derive the resulting field equations and show that they are\nidentical with the Einstein equations of general relativity with a nonzero\ncosmological constant, if the tensor $k_{\\mu\\nu}$ is regarded as the metric\ntensor. The cosmological constant is simply a constant of proportionality\nbetween the two tensors, which together with $c$ and $G$ provides a natural\nsystem of units in gravitational physics.

We\nquantify the importance of these effects by randomizing the angular positions\nof satellite galaxies within haloes, either coherently or individually, while\nkeeping the distance to their respective central galaxies fixed.

In\norder to evaluate the detectability, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio for only a\nsingle redshift slice is also calculated for current and future observations,\nsuch as CMB observations by Planck satellite and 21 cm observations by\nOmniscope. The existence of the $f_{\\rm NL}$ increases the signal of the\ncross-correlation at large scales and the amplification does not depend on the\nreionization parameters in our reionization model. However the cosmic variance\nis significant on such scales and the S/N ratio is suppressed. The obtained S/N\nratio is 2.8 (2.4) for $f_{\\rm NL}=10$ (100) in our fiducial reionization\nmodel.

The integrated perturbation theory is a general framework of\nnonlinear perturbation theory, in which a broad class of bias models can be\nincorporated into perturbative evaluations of biased power spectrum and\nhigher-order polyspectra.

In this paper, we investigate variations of\nthe IMF within individual galaxies. For this purpose, we use strong lensing and\ngas kinematics to measure independently the normalisation of the IMF of the\nbulge and disk components of a sample of 5 massive spiral galaxies with\nsubstantial bulge components taken from the SWELLS survey. We find that the\nstellar mass of the bulges are tightly constrained by the lensing and kinematic\ndata. A comparison with masses based on stellar population synthesis models\nfitted to optical and near infrared photometry favors a Salpeter-like\nnormalisation of the IMF. Conversely, the disk masses are less well constrained\ndue to degeneracies with the dark matter halo, but are consistent with Milky\nWay type IMFs in agreement with previous studies.

One minimal theory that realizes such a scenario is the\nAtomic Dark Matter model, in which two fermions oppositely charged under a new\nU(1) dark force are initially coupled to a thermal bath of \"dark photons\" but\neventually recombine into neutral atom-like bound states and begin forming\ngravitationally-bound structures. As dark atoms have (dark) atom-sized\ngeometric cross sections, this model also provides an example of\nself-interacting DM with a velocity-dependent cross section. Delayed kinetic\ndecoupling in this scenario predicts novel DM properties on small scales but\nretains the success of cold DM on larger scales.

The evolution of voids is governed by the\nNewtonian gravity, the effective dark energy force and the fifth force. While\nthe first two forces are common in both LCDM and chameleon universes, the fifth\nforce is unique to the latter. Driven by the outward-pointing fifth force,\nindividual voids in chameleon models expand faster and grow larger than in a\nLCDM universe. The expansion velocity of the void shell can be 20% to 30%\nlarger for voids of a few Mpc/h in radius, while their sizes can be larger by\n~10%. These differences are smaller for larger voids of the same density.

It is pointed\nout that a background inflaton field \\phi_0 falling down a potential density\nV(\\phi) can and frequently should undergo a quantum tunneling effect involving\nan energy \\DeltaV<<V, so that it becomes possible to create perturbative\ninflatons \\phi's, which, in turn, can disintegrate into other particles. We\nargue for this scenario using large field inflation assumed during a typical\nslow-roll regime, and typical values for the physical quantities associated\nwith the tunneling effect are worked out. It is shown how, as a result of these\nhighly energetic and localized processes, the components of the metric receive\nstrong gradients within a small volume. These pockets of gravity can gravitate\nboth attractively or repulsively, since the Ricci tensor contains squared\npartial derivative terms with either positive or negative sign, so they can be\na component of either dark matter or dark energy. As the Universe expands the\ncurvature of the pockets weakens as 1/a^2, where a(t) is the scale factor of\nthe expansion, but it is shown that, as long as the integral over the\ngravitating gravitational fields of the pocket is done over all of the\nexpanding volume of the pocket, the value of the integral is not affected by\nthe expansion. Geometrically speaking, the gravitation of a pocket is produced\nby the convolutions of the metric inside it; as the Universe expands the\nconvolutions are over a much large volume so they are flatter, but an\nintegration over the larger volume gives the same result as before the\nexpansion. It is just a change of scale of the same geometry.

Point (i) is manifestly irrelevant (the 3-4\nkeV background model was not meant to extend outside that range), while closer\ninspection of point (ii) shows that the detected features are inconsistent and\nlikely unphysical. We demonstrate that the existence of an excess near 3.5 keV\nin the M31 data requires fitting a broad enough energy range such that the\nbackground modeling near 3.5 keV is poor to a level that multiple spurious\nresidual features become significant.

Leading models relate SGRBs to a relativistic jet\nlaunched by the BH-torus system resulting from the merger. However, recent\nobservations have revealed a large fraction of SGRB events accompanied by X-ray\nafterglows with durations $\\sim10^2\\!-\\!10^5~\\mathrm{s}$, suggesting continuous\nenergy injection from a long-lived central engine, which is incompatible with\nthe short ($\\lesssim1~\\mathrm{s}$) accretion timescale of a BH-torus system.\nThe formation of a supramassive NS, resisting the collapse on much longer\nspin-down timescales, can explain these afterglow durations, but leaves serious\ndoubts on whether a relativistic jet can be launched at merger. Here we present\na novel scenario accommodating both aspects, where the SGRB is produced after\nthe collapse of a supramassive NS.

Here we discuss the\nrelevant results of S-inflation in the context of the 750 GeV resonance. In\nparticular, we show that a singlet scalar, if it is real, has a major advantage\nover the Higgs boson with regard to unitarity violation during inflation. This\nis because it is possible to restrict the large non-minimal coupling required\nfor inflation, $\\xi \\sim 10^5$, to the real singlet scalar, with all other\nscalars having $\\xi \\sim 1$.

This approach allows us to identify the\nregime where the inflationary field range is uniquely determined by both the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio and the spectral index. Then, we derive a novel\nfield-range bound, which is two orders of magnitude stronger than the original\none derived by Lyth. On the other hand, we discuss the embedding of inflation\nin supergravity and prove that non-trivial hyperbolic K\\\"ahler geometries\ninduce an attractor for the inflationary observables: the spectral tilt tends\nautomatically to the center of the Planck dome whereas the amount of primordial\ngravitational waves is directly controlled by curvature of the internal\nmanifold. We identify the origin of this attractor mechanism in the so-called\n$\\alpha$-scale supergravity model. Finally, we show how the inclusion of a\nnilpotent sector, allowing for a unified description of inflation and dark\nenergy, implies an enhancement of the attractor nature of the theory. The main\nresults of this thesis have been already published elsewhere. However, here we\npay special attention to present them in a comprehensive way and provide the\nreader with the necessary background. \n\n"}

We also present a method to derive\ncosmologically relevant initial variables for this setup. Estimates of angular\npower spectra for each metric variable are computed and evaluated on the\ncentral observer's past null cone. By comparing the full evolution to the\nfreely evolved initial profiles, the coupling strength will be determined for a\nbest fit radially inhomogeneous patch obtained in previous works (see Redlich\net. al. (2014)). We find that coupling effects are not noticeable within the\ncosmic variance limit and can therefore safely be neglected for a relevant\ncosmological scenario. On the contrary, we find very strong coupling effects in\na best fit spherical void model matching the distance redshift relation of SNe\nwhich is in accordance with previous findings using parametric void models. \n\n"}

Abstract: The Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature (EDGES)\ncollaboration has reported the detection of an absorption feature in the\nsky-averaged spectrum at $\\approx 78$ MHz. This signal has been interpreted as\nthe absorption of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons at redshifts $15\n\\lesssim z \\lesssim 20$ by the 21cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen,\nwhose temperature is expected to be coupled to the gas temperature by the\nWouthuysen-Field effect during this epoch. Because the gas is colder than the\nCMB, the 21cm signal is seen in absorption. However, the absorption depth\nreported by EDGES is more than twice the maximal value expected in the standard\ncosmological model, at $\\approx 3.8\\sigma$ significance. Here, we propose an\nexplanation for this depth based on \"early dark energy\" (EDE), a scenario in\nwhich an additional component with equation of state $w=-1$ contributes to the\ncosmological energy density at early times, before decaying rapidly at a\ncritical redshift, $z_c$. For $20 \\lesssim z_c \\lesssim 1000$, the accelerated\nexpansion due to the EDE can produce an earlier decoupling of the gas\ntemperature from the radiation temperature than that in the standard model,\ngiving the gas additional time to cool adiabatically before the first luminous\nsources form. We show that the EDE scenario can successfully explain the large\namplitude of the EDGES signal. However, such models are strongly ruled out by\nobservations of the CMB temperature power spectrum. Moreover, the EDE models\nneeded to explain the EDGES signal exacerbate the current tension in low- and\nhigh-redshift measurements of the Hubble constant. We conclude that\nnon-finely-tuned modifications of the background cosmology are unlikely to\nexplain the EDGES signal while remaining consistent with other cosmological\nobservations. \n\n"}

We quantify the level of fine-tuning\ndue to this sensitivity. For example, if the main source of dark matter is PBHs\nwith mass $10^{-12}M_\\odot$, then anthropic reasoning suggests that the dark\nmatter to baryon ratio should range between 1 and 300.

These clusters were X-ray selected using the\nROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS), cross-matched to associated systems in the\nredMaPPer catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The spectroscopic sample\nwe analyze was obtained in the SPIDERS program and contains ~7800 red member\ngalaxies. Adopting NFW mass and galaxy density profiles and a broad range of\norbital anisotropy profiles, we use the Jeans equation to calculate halo\nmasses. Modeling the scaling relation as $\\lambda \\propto \\text{A}_{\\lambda}\n{M_{\\text{200c}}}^{\\text{B}_{\\lambda}} ({1+z})^{\\gamma_{\\lambda}}$, we find the\nparameter constraints $\\text{A}_{\\lambda}=38.6^{+3.1}_{-4.1}\\pm3.9$,\n$\\text{B}_{\\lambda}=0.99^{+0.06}_{-0.07}\\pm0.04$, and\n$\\gamma_{\\lambda}=-1.13^{+0.32}_{-0.34}\\pm0.49$.

However, there is no\nstrong Bayesian evidence for a steeper profile than the NFW model. The mass\nconcentration matches the predictions from cosmological simulations.\nEllipticals usually trace best the mass distribution, while S0s are close.\nSpiral galaxies show increasingly radial orbits at increasing radius, as do S0s\non two stacks, and ellipticals on one stack. The inner orbits of all three\ntypes in the 3 stacks are consistent with isotropy.

The less radial orbits we find for early-types\ncould be related to the longer time spent by these galaxies in the cluster. We\ndemonstrate that two-body relaxation is too slow to explain the inner isotropy\nof the early types, which suggests that inner isotropy is the consequence of\nviolent relaxation during major cluster mergers or dynamical friction and tidal\nbraking acting on subclusters. We propose that the inner isotropy of the\nshort-lived spirals is a selection effect of spirals passing only once through\npericenter before being transformed into early-type morphologies. \n\n"}

The second one is based on the merging-halo\nformalism of Lacey & Cole (1993), accounting for the fact that massive clusters\naccrete matter quasi-continuously, and is an improvement of a model proposed by\nVoit (2000). The final result is that, in both models, the M-T relation shows a\nbreak at T \\sim 3-4 keV. The behavior of the M-T relation is as usual, M\n\\propto T^{3/2}, at the high mass end, and M \\propto T^{\\gamma}, with a value\nof \\gamma>3/2 depending on the chosen cosmology. The evolution of the M-T\nrelation, for a given M_{\\rm vir}, is more modest both in flat and open\nuniverses in comparison to previous estimate found in literature, even more\nmodest than what found by V2000. Moreover the time evolution is more rapid in\nmodels with L=0 than in models in which the angular momentum acquisition by\nprotostructures is taken into account (L \\neq 0).

The energy flux of the waves declines more steeply with radius\nthan the inverse-square law predicted by energy conservation, implying that\ndissipation plays an important role in tapping the wave energy. We show that\nsuch dispersing sound waves/weak shocks are detectable as ripples on\nunsharp-masked X-ray cluster maps, and point out that the interfaces between\nthe intracluster medium and old bubbles are also clearly detectable in\nunsharp-masked X-ray maps.

During reionization peculiar motion of free electrons induces the\nDoppler anisotropy of the CMB, while density fluctuations of neutral hydrogen\ninduce the 21-cm line anisotropy. In our simplified model of inhomogeneous\nreionization, a positive correlation arises as the universe reionizes whereas a\nnegative correlation arises as it recombines; thus, the sign of the correlation\nprovides information on the reionization history which cannot be obtained by\npresently. The signal comes mainly from large scales (k~0.01 Mpc^-1) where\nlinear perturbation theory is valid and complexity due to patchy reionization\nis averaged out. Since the Doppler signal comes from ionized regions and the\n21-cm comes from neutral ones, the correlation has a well-defined peak(s) in\nredshift when the ionization fraction of the universe is about half.\nFurthermore, the cross-correlation is much less sensitive to systematic errors,\nespecially foreground emission, than the auto-correlation of 21-cm lines: this\nis analogous to the temperature-polarization correlation of the CMB being more\nimmune to systematic errors than the polarization-polarization.

In the present formalism, the kinematic\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich effect for the cluster of galaxies with a peculiar velocity\nis derived in a straightforward manner by the Lorentz boost of the generalized\nKompaneets equation. We give an analytic expression for the kinematic\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich effect which is valid up to O(beta^{2}) with the power\nseries expansion approximation in terms of theta_{e} = k_{B} T_{e}/ mc^{2},\nwhere T_{e} and m are the electron temperature and the electron mass,\nrespectively. It is found that the relativistic corrections to the kinematic\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich effect are significant. For a typical electron temperature\n10keV, one obtains -8.2% and +1.3% corrections from the O(beta theta_{e}) and\nO(beta theta_{e}^{2}) contributions, respectively. The O(beta^{2}) correction\nis extremely small, +0.2% for beta=1/300 at 10keV. Therefore it can be safely\nneglected. These relativistic corrections are directly reflected on the\ndetermination of the peculiar velocity of the cluster of galaxies with the\nobservation of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. \n\n"}

The gravitational field couples to the electromagnetic field via the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations which in the simplest model causes the electrostatic\nfield of charged spinning particles to acquire an oblate structure relative to\nthe spin direction. For electrons and protons, a pure Coulomb field is\ntherefore likely to be incompatible with general relativity at the Compton\nscale.

The\nquestion of whether or not the resulting corrections to the Einstein equations\nare significant, is still a subject of debate, partly due to possible\nambiguities in the averaging schemes available.

The collapse can end in a black-hole\nor a naked singularity, depending on the initial parameters characterizing\nthese profiles. In the marginally bound case, we find that the collapse ends in\na naked singularity if the leading non-vanishing derivative of the density at\nthe center is either the first one or the second one. If the first two\nderivatives are zero, and the third derivative non-zero, the singularity could\neither be naked or covered, depending on a quantity determined by the third\nderivative and the central density. If the first three derivatives are zero,\nthe collapse ends in a black hole. In particular, the classic result of\nOppenheimer and Snyder, that homogeneous dust collapse leads to a black hole,\nis recovered as a special case. Analogous results are found when the cloud is\nnot marginally bound, and also for the case of a cloud starting from rest.

In particular, we focus on the case\nwhere our 3-brane is located at the $Z_2$ symmetry fixed plane of a $Z_2$\nsymmetric five-dimensional spacetime, as in the Ho\\v{r}ava-Witten model\ncompactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold. As our first result, we find that there\ncan be substantial modifications to the standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\n(FRW) cosmology; as a consequence, a large class of such models is\nobservationally inconsistent. In particular, any relationship between the\nHubble constant and the energy density on our brane is possible, including (but\nnot only) FRW. Generically, due to the existence of the bulk and the boundary\nconditions on the orbifold fixed plane, the relationship is not FRW, and hence\ncosmological constraints coming from big bang nucleosynthesis, structure\nformation, and the age of the universe difficult to satisfy. We do wish to\npoint out, however, that some specific choices for the bulk stress-energy\ntensor components do reproduce normal FRW cosmology on our brane, and we have\nconstructed an explicit example. As our second result, for a broad class of\nmodels, we find a somewhat surprising fact: the stabilization of the radius of\nthe extra dimension and hence the four dimensional Planck mass requires\nunrealistic fine-tuning of the equation of state on our 3-brane. In the last\nthird of the paper, we make remarks about causality and the horizon problem\nthat apply to {\\it any} theory in which the volume of the extra dimension\ndetermines the four-dimensional gravitational coupling. We point out that some\nof the assumptions that lead to the usual inflationary requirements are\nmodified. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-ph/9912455", "contents": "Title: Invisible Axions and Large-Radius Compactifications Abstract: We study some of the novel effects that arise when the QCD axion is placed in\nthe ``bulk'' of large extra spacetime dimensions. First, we find that the mass\nof the axion can become independent of the energy scale associated with the\nbreaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry. This implies that the mass of the axion\ncan be adjusted independently of its couplings to ordinary matter, thereby\nproviding a new method of rendering the axion invisible. Second, we discuss the\nnew phenomenon of laboratory axion oscillations (analogous to neutrino\noscillations), and show that these oscillations cause laboratory axions to\n``decohere'' extremely rapidly as a result of Kaluza-Klein mixing. This\ndecoherence may also be a contributing factor to axion invisibility. Third, we\ndiscuss the role of Kaluza-Klein axions in axion-mediated processes and decays,\nand propose several experimental tests of the higher-dimensional nature of the\naxion. Finally, we show that under certain circumstances, the presence of an\ninfinite tower of Kaluza-Klein axion modes can significantly accelerate the\ndissipation of the energy associated with cosmological relic axion\noscillations, thereby enabling the Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking scale to\nexceed the usual four-dimensional relic oscillation bounds. Together, these\nideas therefore provide new ways of obtaining an ``invisible'' axion within the\ncontext of higher-dimensional theories with large-radius compactifications. \n\n"}

As D-branes in extra dimensions, some type of cosmic\nstrings will dissolve rapidly in spacetime, while the stable ones appear with a\nspectrum of cosmic string tensions.

{"id": "hep-th/0402047", "contents": "Title: Volume Stabilization and the Origin of the Inflaton Shift Symmetry in\n  String Theory Abstract: The main problem of inflation in string theory is finding the models with a\nflat potential, consistent with stabilization of the volume of the compactified\nspace. This can be achieved in the theories where the potential has (an\napproximate) shift symmetry in the inflaton direction. We will identify a class\nof models where the shift symmetry uniquely follows from the underlying\nmathematical structure of the theory. It is related to the symmetry properties\nof the corresponding coset space and the period matrix of special geometry,\nwhich shows how the gauge coupling depends on the volume and the position of\nthe branes. In particular, for type IIB string theory on K3xT^2/Z with D3 or D7\nmoduli belonging to vector multiplets, the shift symmetry is a part of\nSO(2,2+n) symmetry of the coset space [SU(1,1)/ U(1)]x[SO(2,2+n)/(SO(2)x\nSO(2+n)]. The absence of a prepotential, specific for the stringy version of\nsupergravity, plays a prominent role in this construction, which may provide a\nviable mechanism for the accelerated expansion and inflation in the early\nuniverse. \n\n"}

We\nassume that the initial and final stages of the background cosmological model\nare given by de Sitter and Minkowski phases, respectively, and they are\nconnected smoothly by a radiation-dominated phase. This setup allows us to\ndiscuss the quantum-mechanical generation of the perturbations and to see the\nfinal amplitude of the well-defined zero mode. Using the Wronskian formulation,\nwe numerically compute the power spectrum of gravitational waves, and find that\nthe effect of initial vacuum fluctuations in the Kaluza-Klein modes is\nsubdominant, contributing not more than 10% of the total power spectrum. Thus\nit is confirmed that the damping due to the Kaluza-Klein mode generation and\nthe enhancement due to the modification of the background Friedmann equation\nare the two dominant effects, but they cancel each other, leading to the same\nspectral tilt as the standard four-dimensional result. Kaluza-Klein gravitons\nthat escape from the brane contribute to the energy density of the dark\nradiation at late times. We show that a tiny amount of the dark radiation is\ngenerated due to this process. \n\n"}
