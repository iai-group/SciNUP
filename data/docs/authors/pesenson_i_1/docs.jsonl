We then introduce two general methods --\nthe spatial complement and the Naimark complement -- for constructing a new\nfusion frame from a given fusion frame. We then establish existence conditions\nfor fusion frames with desired properties. In particular, we address the\nfollowing question: Given $M, N, m \\in \\NN$ and $\\{\\lambda_j\\}_{j=1}^M$, does\nthere exist a fusion frame in $\\RR^M$ with $N$ subspaces of dimension $m$ for\nwhich $\\{\\lambda_j\\}_{j=1}^M$ are the eigenvalues of the associated fusion\nframe operator? We address this problem by providing an algorithm which\ncomputes such a fusion frame for almost any collection of parameters $M, N, m\n\\in \\NN$ and $\\{\\lambda_j\\}_{j=1}^M$. Moreover, we show how this procedure can\nbe applied, if subspaces are to be added to a given fusion frame to force it to\nbecome Parseval. \n\n"}

This entails, as a preliminary step, ascertaining sets of test\nfunctions that determine the operator, as well as the derivation of a\ncorresponding reconstruction scheme. In the present paper we exploit a recent\nbreakthrough in the theory of stable polynomials to solve the stated inverse\nproblem completely. We prove that a minimum phase preserving operator on the\nhalf line can be reconstructed from data consisting of its value on precisely\ntwo test functions. And we derive an explicit integral representation of the\nunknown operator in terms of this data. A remarkable corollary of the solution\nis that if a linear minimum phase preserving operator has rank at least two,\nthen it is necessarily injective. \n\n"}

Furthermore, which measurement ensembles lend stability? This paper\npresents several results that address each of these questions. We begin by\ncharacterizing injectivity, and we identify that the complement property is\nindeed a necessary condition in the complex case.

This\ncombinatorial problem can be relaxed and then solved using classical descent\nmethods. The main component of this relaxation is forming certain compactly\nsupported functions which we call \"knolls\", and reformulating the shape\nrepresentation as a basis expansion in terms of such functions. To select\nsuitable elements of the dictionary, our problem ultimately reduces to solving\na nonlinear program with sparsity constraints. We provide a new sparse\nnonlinear reconstruction technique to approach this problem.

Given an abstract functional calculus (E, F, Phi)\non a Banach space X, where F (O) is an algebra of scalar-valued functions on a\nset O, we define a square function Phi_gamma(f) for certain H-valued functions\nf on O. The assignment f to Phi_gamma(f) then becomes a vectorial functional\ncalculus, and a \"square function estimate\" for f simply means the boundedness\nof Phi_gamma(f). In this view, all results linking square function estimates\nwith the boundedness of a certain (usually the H-infinity) functional calculus\nsimply assert that certain square function estimates imply other square\nfunction estimates. In the present paper several results of this type are\nproved in an abstract setting, based on the principles of subordination,\nintegral representation, and a new boundedness concept for subsets of Hilbert\nspaces, the so-called ell-1 -frame-boundedness.

{"id": "1411.2066", "contents": "Title: Learning Theory for Distribution Regression Abstract: We focus on the distribution regression problem: regressing to vector-valued\noutputs from probability measures. Many important machine learning and\nstatistical tasks fit into this framework, including multi-instance learning\nand point estimation problems without analytical solution (such as\nhyperparameter or entropy estimation). Despite the large number of available\nheuristics in the literature, the inherent two-stage sampled nature of the\nproblem makes the theoretical analysis quite challenging, since in practice\nonly samples from sampled distributions are observable, and the estimates have\nto rely on similarities computed between sets of points. To the best of our\nknowledge, the only existing technique with consistency guarantees for\ndistribution regression requires kernel density estimation as an intermediate\nstep (which often performs poorly in practice), and the domain of the\ndistributions to be compact Euclidean. In this paper, we study a simple,\nanalytically computable, ridge regression-based alternative to distribution\nregression, where we embed the distributions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspace, and learn the regressor from the embeddings to the outputs. Our main\ncontribution is to prove that this scheme is consistent in the two-stage\nsampled setup under mild conditions (on separable topological domains enriched\nwith kernels): we present an exact computational-statistical efficiency\ntrade-off analysis showing that our estimator is able to match the one-stage\nsampled minimax optimal rate [Caponnetto and De Vito, 2007; Steinwart et al.,\n2009].

Similar to classical\ntime-frequency or time-scale representations, the representation coefficients\nare obtained as inner products with the elements of a continuously indexed\nfamily of time-frequency atoms. These atoms are obtained from a single\nprototype function, by means of modulation, translation and warping. By warping\nwe refer to the process of nonlinear evaluation according to a bijective,\nincreasing function, the warping function. Besides showing that the resulting\nintegral transforms fulfill certain basic, but essential properties, such as\ncontinuity and invertibility, we will show that a large subclass of warping\nfunctions gives rise to families of generalized coorbit spaces, i.e. Banach\nspaces of functions whose representations possess a certain localization.\nFurthermore, we obtain sufficient conditions for subsampled warped\ntime-frequency systems to form atomic decompositions and Banach frames.

Random\nconvex analysis is convex analysis over random locally convex modules. Since\nrandom locally convex modules have the more complicated topological and\nalgebraic structures than ordinary locally convex spaces, establishing random\nconvex analysis will encounter harder mathematical challenges than classical\nconvex analysis so that there are still a lot of fundamentally important\nunsolved problems in random convex analysis. This paper is devoted to solving\nsome important theoretic problems. First, we establish the inferior limit\nbehavior of a proper lower semicontinuous $L^0$--convex function on a random\nlocally convex module endowed with the locally $L^0$--convex topology, which\nmakes perfect the Fenchel--Moreau duality theorem for such functions. Then, we\ninvestigate the relations among continuity, locally $L^0$--Lipschitzian\ncontinuity and almost surely sequent continuity of a proper $L^0$--convex\nfunction.

We introduce the notion of Ramsey partitions of a finite metric\nspace, and show that the existence of good Ramsey partitions implies a solution\nto the metric Ramsey problem for large distortion (a.k.a. the non-linear\nversion of the isomorphic Dvoretzky theorem, as introduced by Bourgain, Figiel,\nand Milman).

This\nresult is best possible and improves part of the metric Ramsey theorem of\nBartal, Linial, Mendel and Naor, in addition to considerably simplifying its\nproof.

In this note, we show that Xu's ideas can be adapted to\ngive an intrinsic characterisation of when a completely contractive Banach\nalgebra arises as a closed subalgebra of the algebra of completely bounded\noperators on a reflexive operator space. This result was shown by Young for\nBanach algebras, and our characterisation is a direct analogue of Young's,\ninvolving weakly almost periodic functionals. \n\n"}

Our work shows that the spaces $L^p_E(T)$, $p$\nan even integer, have a singular behaviour from the almost isometric point of\nview: property UMAP does not interpolate between spaces $L^p_E(T)$ and\n$L^{p+2}_E(T)$.
