Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance.

{"id": "0909.3328", "contents": "Title: Fundamental Theoretical Bias in Gravitational Wave Astrophysics and the\n  Parameterized Post-Einsteinian Framework Abstract: We consider the concept of fundamental bias in gravitational wave\nastrophysics as the assumption that general relativity is the correct theory of\ngravity during the entire wave-generation and propagation regime. Such an\nassumption is valid in the weak field, as verified by precision experiments and\nobservations, but it need not hold in the dynamical strong-field regime where\ntests are lacking. Fundamental bias can cause systematic errors in the\ndetection and parameter estimation of signals, which can lead to a\nmischaracterization of the universe through incorrect inferences about source\nevent rates and populations. We propose a remedy through the introduction of\nthe parameterized post-Einsteinian framework, which consists of the enhancement\nof waveform templates via the inclusion of post-Einsteinian parameters. These\nparameters would ostensibly be designed to interpolate between templates\nconstructed in general relativity and well-motivated alternative theories of\ngravity, and also include extrapolations that follow sound theoretical\nprinciples, such as consistency with conservation laws and symmetries.

We consider binaries with spins aligned or anti-aligned with the\norbital angular momentum and study the dependence of gravitational and EM\nsignals with these spin configurations. Overall we find that the EM radiation\nin the lowest l=2, m=2 multipole accurately reflects the gravitational one,\nwith identical phase evolutions and amplitudes that differ only by a scaling\nfactor. We also compute the efficiency of the energy emission in EM waves and\nfind that it is given by E^rad_EM/M ~ 10^-15 (M/10^8 M_Sun)^2 (B/10^4 G)^2,\nhence 13 orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitational energy for\nrealistic magnetic fields.

One of the most likely sources of\nisotropic EM emission from compact object mergers is a supernova-like transient\npowered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized in ejecta from\nthe merger. We present the first calculations of the optical transients from\ncompact object mergers that self-consistently determine the radioactive heating\nby means of a nuclear reaction network; using this heating rate, we model the\nlight curve with a one dimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer calculation.\nFor an ejecta mass ~1e-2 M_sun[1e-3 M_sun] the resulting light curve peaks on a\ntimescale ~ 1 day at a V-band luminosity nu L_nu ~ 3e41[1e41] ergs/s (M_V =\n-15[-14]); this corresponds to an effective \"f\" parameter ~3e-6 in the\nLi-Paczynski toy model.

Previous\nwork has shown that rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized proto-neutron stars\n(`millisecond proto-magnetars') produce outflows with energies, timescales, and\nmagnetizations sigma_0 (maximum Lorentz factor) that are consistent with those\nrequired to produce long GRBs. Here we extend this work in order to construct a\nself-consistent model that directly connects the properties of the central\nengine to the observed prompt emission. Just after the launch of the supernova\nshock, a wind heated by neutrinos is driven from the proto-magnetar. The\noutflow is collimated into a bipolar jet by its interaction with the star. As\nthe magnetar cools, the wind becomes ultra-relativistic and Poynting-flux\ndominated (sigma_0 >> 1) on a timescale comparable to that required for the jet\nto clear a cavity through the star. Although the site and mechanism of the\nprompt emission are debated, we calculate the emission predicted by two models:\nmagnetic dissipation and internal shocks. Our results favor the magnetic\ndissipation model in part because it predicts a relatively constant `Band'\nspectral peak energy E_peak with time during the GRB. The jet baryon loading\ndecreases abruptly when the neutron star becomes transparent to neutrinos at t\n~ 10-100 seconds. Jets with ultra-high magnetization cannot effectively\naccelerate and dissipate their energy, suggesting this transition ends the\nprompt emission and may explain the steep decay phase that follows.

{"id": "1104.4802", "contents": "Title: Acceleration of particles by black holes: kinematic explanation Abstract: A new simple and general explanation of the effect of acceleration of\nparticles by black holes to infinite energies in the centre of mass frame is\nsuggested. It is based on kinematics of particles moving near the horizon. This\neffect arises when particles of two kinds collide near the horizon. For massive\nparticles, the first kind represents a particle with the generic energy and\nangular momentum (I call them \"usual\"). Near the horizon, such a particle has a\nvelocity almost equal to that of light in the frame that corotates with a black\nhole (the frame is static if a black hole is static). The second kind (called\n\"critical\") consists of particles with the velocity v<c near the horizon due to\nspecial relationship between the energy and angular momentum (or charge). As a\nresult, the relative velocity approaches the speed of light c, the Lorentz\nfactor grows unbound. This explanation applies both to generic rotating black\nholes and charged ones (even for radial motion of particles). If one of\ncolliding particles is massless (photon), the critical particle is\ndistinguished by the fact that its frequency is finite near the horizon. The\nexistence (or absence) of the effect is determined depending on competition of\ntwo factors - gravitational blue shift for a photon propagating towards a black\nhole and the Doppler effect due to transformation from the locally nonrotating\nframe to a comoving one. Classification of all possible types of collisions is\nsuggested depending on whether massive or massless particle is critical or\nusual. \n\n"}

This unique\nconfiguration allows measurements of spin orientation for both pulsars: pulsar\nA's spin is tilted from the orbital angular momentum by no more than 14 degrees\nat 95% confidence; pulsar B's by 130 +/- 1 degrees at 99.7% confidence. This\nspin-spin misalignment requires that the origin of most of B's present-day spin\nis connected to the supernova that formed pulsar B. Under the simplified\nassumption of a single, instantaneous kick during the supernova, the spin could\nbe thought of as originating from the off-center nature of the kick, causing\npulsar B to tumble to its misaligned state. With this assumption, and using\ncurrent constraints on the kick magnitude, we find that pulsar B's\ninstantaneous kick must have been displaced from the center of mass of the\nexploding star by at least 1 km and probably 5--10 km.

Abstract: Low luminosity gamma-ray bursts (ll-GRBs) constitute a sub-class of gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) that plays a central role in the GRB-supernova connection. While\nll-GRBs differ from typical long GRBs (LGRBs) in many aspects, they also share\nsome common features. Therefore, the question whether the gamma-ray emission of\nll-GRBs and LGRBs has a common origin is of great interest. Here we address\nthis question by testing whether ll-GRBs, like LGRBs according to the Collapsar\nmodel, can be generated by relativistic jets that punch holes in the envelopes\nof their progenitor stars. The collapsar model predicts that the durations of\nmost observed bursts will be comparable to, or longer than, the time it takes\nthe jets to breakout of the star. We calculate the jet breakout times of\nll-GRBs and compare them to the observed durations. We find that there is a\nsignificant access of ll-GRBs with durations that are much shorter than the jet\nbreakout time and that these are inconsistent with the Collapsar model.

We examine geodesics representative of the paths of null and\nmassive particles with a range of initial velocities from -c to c interacting\nwith an Alcubierre warp bubble travelling at a range of globally subluminal and\nsuperluminal velocities on both constant and variable velocity paths. The key\nresults for null particles match what would be expected of massive test\nparticles as they approach +/- c. The increase in energy for massive and null\nparticles is calculated in terms of v_s, the global ship velocity, and v_p, the\ninitial velocity of the particle with respect to the rest frame of the\norigin/destination of the ship. Particles with positive v_p obtain extremely\nhigh energy and velocity and become \"time locked\" for the duration of their\ntime in the bubble, experiencing very little proper time between entering and\neventually leaving the bubble.

The long-duration gravitational-waveforms emitted\nby such systems encode the structure of the strong field region of the massive\nblack hole, in which the inspiral occurs.

To achieve this, EMRI modeling in alternative\ntheories of gravity is required to describe the generation of gravitational\nwaves. In this paper, we explore to what extent EMRI observations with LISA or\neLISA/NGO might be able to distinguish between General Relativity and a\nparticular modification of it, known as Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified\nGravity. Our analysis is based on a parameter estimation study that uses\napproximate gravitational waveforms obtained via a radiative-adiabatic method\nand is restricted to a five-dimensional subspace of the EMRI configuration\nspace.

These new equations of state are implemented into\nour spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model, which is based on\ngeneral relativistic radiation hydrodynamics with three-flavor Boltzmann\nneutrino transport. The results are compared with commonly used equations of\nstate in supernova simulations of 15 and 40 solar mass progenitors. We do not\nfind any simple correlations between individual nuclear matter properties at\nsaturation and the outcome of these simulations. However, the new equations of\nstate lead to the most compact neutron stars among the relativistic mean-field\nmodels which we considered. The new models also obey the previously observed\ncorrelation between the time to black hole formation and the maximum mass of an\ns=4 neutron star. \n\n"}

This method determines a spectral representation of the unknown\nhigh density portion of the stellar equation of state from a knowledge of the\ntotal masses M and radii R of the stars. Spectral representations of the\nequation of state are very efficient, generally requiring only a few spectral\nparameters to achieve good accuracy. This new method is able, therefore, to\ndetermine the high density equation of state quite accurately from only a few\naccurately measured [M,R] data points.

Here we study this process for the first time, in\nthree-dimensions, and in full general relativity. By considering three initial\nNS configurations, each with and without a surrounding disk (of mass ~7%\nM_{NS}), we investigate the effect of the accretion disk on the dynamics of the\ncollapse and its imprint on both the gravitational wave (GW) and\nelectromagnetic (EM) signals that can be emitted by these sources.

Several mysteries cloud the interpretation\nof this event: (1) extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray\nlight curve during the first 10 days after the gamma-ray trigger; (2)\nunexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission months after\ntrigger; (3) no obvious evidence for jet precession, despite misalignment\ntypically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disk and BH;\n(4) recent abrupt shut-off in jet X-ray emission after 1.5 years. Here we show\nthat all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one\nassumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Phi threading the BH.\nInitially, Phi is weak relative to high fall-back mass accretion rate, Mdot,\nand the disk and jets precess about the BH axis = our line of sight. As Mdot\ndrops, Phi becomes dynamically important and leads to a magnetically-arrested\ndisk (MAD). MAD naturally aligns disk and jet axis along the BH spin axis, but\nonly after a violent rearrangement phase (jet wobbling). This explains the\nerratic light curve at early times and the lack of precession at later times.\nWe use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain BH and disrupted star\nproperties, finding that a solar-mass main sequence star disrupted by a\nrelatively low mass, M~10^5-10^6 Msun, BH is consistent with the data, while a\nWD disruption (though still possible) is disfavored. The magnetic flux required\nto power Swift J1644+57 is too large to be supplied by the star itself, but it\ncould be collected from a quiescent `fossil' accretion disk present in the\ngalactic nucleus prior to the TD.

Building on previous work, which showed\nsurprising uniformity in the behaviour of the moment of inertia for\nneutron-star models constructed with widely-different equations of state, we\nfind similar uniformity for the quadrupole moment.

In this paper, we study these universal relations in the\nEddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity. This theory differs from general\nrelativity (GR) significantly only at high densities due to the nonlinear\ncoupling between matter and gravity.

This theorem asserts that the set of states\nconstructed by acting on a suitable vacuum state with boundary observables\ncontained within any subset of the boundary is dense in the Hilbert space of\nthe bulk theory. To prove this theorem we need two ingredients which are\nthemselves of interest. First, we prove a purely bulk version of Reeh-Schlieder\ntheorem for an AdS Klein-Gordon field. This theorem relies on the analyticity\nproperties of certain vacuum states. Our second ingredient is a\nboundary-to-bulk map for local observables on an AdS causal wedge. This mapping\nis achieved by simple integral kernels which construct bulk observables from\nconvolutions with boundary operators. Our analysis improves on previous\nconstructions of AdS boundary-to-bulk maps in that it is formulated entirely in\nLorentz signature without the need for large analytic continuation of spatial\ncoordinates. Both our Reeh-Schlieder theorem and boundary-to-bulk maps may be\napplied to globally well-defined states constructed from the usual AdS vacuum\nas well more singular states such as the local vacuum of an AdS causal wedge\nwhich is singular on the horizon. \n\n"}

Abstract: Starting from the Oppenheimer-Snyder model, we know how in classical general\nrelativity the gravitational collapse of matter form a black hole with a\ncentral spacetime singularity. It is widely believed that the singularity must\nbe removed by quantum gravity effects. Some static quantum-inspired\nsingularity-free black hole solutions have been proposed in the literature, but\nwhen one considers simple examples of gravitational collapse the classical\nsingularity is replaced by a bounce, after which the collapsing matter expands\nfor ever. We may expect 3 possible explanations: $i)$ the static regular black\nhole solutions are not physical, in the sense that they cannot be realized in\nNature, $ii)$ the final product of the collapse is not unique, but it depends\non the initial conditions, or $iii)$ boundary effects play an important role\nand our simple models miss important physics. In the latter case, after proper\nadjustment, the bouncing solution would approach the static one. We argue that\nthe \"correct answer\" may be related to the appearance of a ghost state in de\nSitter spacetimes with super Planckian mass. Our black holes have indeed a de\nSitter core and the ghost would make these configurations unstable. Therefore\nwe believe that these black hole static solutions represent the transient phase\nof a gravitational collapse, but never survive as asymptotic states. \n\n"}

With the advent of\ngravitational-wave (GW) astronomy, environmental effects on the GW signal will\neventually have to be quantified. Here we present a wide survey of the\ncorrections due to these effects in two situations of great interest for GW\nastronomy: the black hole (BH) ringdown emission and the inspiral of two\ncompact objects. We take into account various effects such as: electric\ncharges, magnetic fields, cosmological evolution, possible deviations from\nGeneral Relativity, firewalls, and various forms of matter such as accretion\ndisks and dark matter halos. Our analysis predicts the existence of resonances\ndictated by the external mass distribution, which dominate the very late-time\nbehavior of merger/ringdown waveforms. The mode structure can drastically\ndiffer from the vacuum case, yet the BH response to external perturbations is\nunchanged at the time scales relevant for detectors.

Abstract: We investigate effect of a test magnetic field on the process of destroying\nnear-extremal Kerr black hole with a charged test particle. It has been shown\nthat it would be possible to throw a charged test particle into the near\nextremal rotating black hole and make it go past the extremality i.e. turn Kerr\nblack hole into the Kerr-Newmann naked singularity. Typically in an\nastrophysical scenario black holes are believed to be surrounded by a magnetic\nfield. Magnetic field although small, affects motion of charged particles\ndrastically due to the large Lorentz force, as the electromagnetic force is\nmuch stronger that the gravity. Thus a test magnetic field can affect the\nprocess of destroying black holes and restore the cosmic censorship in the\nastrophysical context. We show that a test magnetic field would act as a cosmic\ncensor beyond a certain threshold value. We try to gauge the magnitude of the\nmagnetic field by comparing its energy density with that of the change in the\ncurvature induced by the test particle. We find that the magnetic field\nrequired in only as strong as or slightly stronger as compared to the value for\nwhich its effect of the background geometry is comparable to the tiny\nbackreaction as that of the test particle. In such a case however one has to\ntake take into account effect of the magnetic field on the background geometry,\nwhich is difficult to implement in the absence of any exact near-extremal\nrotating magnetized black hole solutions.

Studies of\npulsars demonstrate that their electromagnetic (EM) emissions suffer from\n\\emph{timing noise}, small deviations in the phase from Taylor expansion\nmodels. How the mechanism producing EM emission is related to any continuous\ngravitational-wave (CW) emission is unknown; if they either interact or are\nlocked in phase then the CW will also experience timing noise. Any disparity\nbetween the signal and the search template used in matched filtering methods\nwill result in a loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), referred to as\n`mismatch'. In this work we assume the CW suffers a similar level of timing\nnoise to its EM counterpart. We inject and recover fake CW signals, which\ninclude timing noise generated from observational data on the Crab pulsar.\nMeasuring the mismatch over durations of order $\\sim 10$ months, the effect is\nfor the most part found to be small. This suggests recent so-called\n`narrow-band' searches which placed upper limits on the signals from the Crab\nand Vela pulsars will not be significantly affected.

By adjusting the maximum time offset between a pair of\ndata segments to be coherently combined, one can tune the method to trade off\nsensitivity and computing costs.

The improvement in\namplitude sensitivity for a search with a coherence time of 1hr, compared with\na directed stochastic background search with 0.25Hz wide bins is about a factor\nof 5.4.

A signal can\nfurther be classified as Gaussian-stochastic if a Gaussian signal model is\nfavored. In our analysis we use Bayesian model selection to choose between\nseveral signal and noise models for simulated data consisting of uncorrelated\nGaussian detector noise plus a superposition of sinusoidal signals from an\nastrophysical population of gravitational-wave sources.

In this article, we construct quasi-equilibrium\nconfigurations for different spins, eccentricities, mass ratios, compactnesses,\nand equations of state. For this purpose we employ the SGRID code, which allows\nus to construct such data in previously inaccessible regions of the parameter\nspace.

As a proof of principle, we explore the\ndynamical evolution of three new configurations. First, we simulate a $q=2.06$\nmass ratio which is the highest mass ratio for a binary neutron star evolved in\nnumerical relativity to date.

Originally the luminosity was expected in high-energy X-rays\nor gamma-rays, however we conjecture that some of the battery power is emitted\nin the radio bandwidth. While the luminosity and timescale are suggestive of\nfast radio bursts (FRBs; millisecond-scale radio transients) NS--BH coalescence\nrates are too low to make these a primary FRB source. Instead, we propose the\ntransients form a FRB sub-population, distinguishable by a double peak with a\nprecursor.

In\nthe limit where there are many gravitational wave sources in the sky, or many\npulsars in the array, the signals produce a unique tensor correlation pattern\nthat depends only on the angular separation between each pulsar pair. It is\nthis distinct fingerprint that is used to search for gravitational waves using\npulsar timing arrays.

In this article, we review how one can\nprobe general relativity and various alternative theories of gravity by using\nelectromagnetic waves from a black hole with an accretion disk, and\ngravitational waves from black hole binaries. We first review model-independent\nways of testing gravity with electromagnetic/gravitational waves from a black\nhole system.

Here it is shown that no single star of any mass\nand credible metallicity is likely to produce the observed GW signal.

If not accounted for, even a small orbital eccentricity can cause a\npotentially significant systematic error in the mass parameters of an\ninspiralling binary. Gravitational-wave search templates typically rely on the\nquasi-circular approximation, which provides relatively simple expressions for\nthe gravitational-wave phase to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. The\nquasi-Keplerian formalism provides an elegant but complex description of the\npost-Newtonian corrections to the orbits and waveforms of inspiralling binaries\nwith any eccentricity. Here we specialize the quasi-Keplerian formalism to\nbinaries with low eccentricity. In this limit the non-periodic contribution to\nthe gravitational-wave phasing can be expressed explicitly as simple functions\nof frequency or time, with little additional complexity beyond the well-known\nformulas for circular binaries. These eccentric phase corrections are computed\nto 3PN order and to leading order in the eccentricity for the standard PN\napproximants. For a variety of systems these eccentricity corrections cause\nsignificant corrections to the number of gravitational wave cycles that sweep\nthrough a detector's frequency band. This is evaluated using several measures,\nincluding a modification of the useful cycles. We also evaluate the role of\nperiodic terms that enter the phasing and discuss how they can be incorporated\ninto some of the PN approximants. While the eccentric extension of the PN\napproximants is our main objective, this work collects a variety of results\nthat may be of interest to others modeling eccentric relativistic binaries. \n\n"}

With masses of ~10^7M_Sun\nand sizes of only a few parsecs, nuclear star clusters are the densest stellar\nsystems observed in the local universe and represent a robust environment where\n(stellar mass) black hole binaries can dynamically form, harden and merge. We\nshow that due to their large escape speeds, nuclear star clusters can keep a\nlarge fraction of their merger remnants while also evolving rapidly enough that\nthe holes can sink back to the central regions where they can swap in new\nbinaries that can subsequently harden and merge.

The\noptical to near-IR linear polarization spectrum can be described by\ninterstellar dust and an intrinsic variable component. The intrinsic optical\npolarization, detected during the rise of one of the brightest flares of the\noutburst, is variable, peaking at 4.5 per cent and decaying to 3.5 per cent. We\npresent several arguments that favour a synchrotron jet origin to this variable\npolarization, with the optical emission originating close to the jet base. The\npolarization flare occurs during the initial rise of a major radio flare event\nthat peaks later, and is consistent with a classically evolving synchrotron\nflare from an ejection event.

For this event\nwe measure a rather stable polarization position angle of -9 degrees E of N,\nimplying that the magnetic field near the base of the jet is approximately\nperpendicular to the jet axis.

If the\nenergy is drawn from the magnetic energy of a compact object such as a\nmagnetized neutron star, the sources should be nearby and be very rare.

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve.

Like the upper mass limit, the limit on deformabity is\nobtained by using an EOS with $v_{sound} = c$ for high densities and matching\nto a low density (candidate) EOS at a matching density of order nuclear\nsaturation density. We use these results and those of [B.D. Lackey et al.,\nPhys. Rev.

Recently, however, the hypothesis that the BH\ninterior does not exist has been gaining traction, as it provides a means for\nresolving the BH information-loss problem. Here, we propose a simple method for\nanswering the following question: Does the BH interior exist and, if so, does\nit contain some distribution of matter or is it mostly empty? Our proposal is\npremised on the idea that, similar to the case of relativistic, ultra-compact\nstars, any BH-like object whose interior has some matter distribution should\nsupport fluid modes in addition to the conventional spacetime modes. In\nparticular, the Coriolis-induced Rossby (r-) modes, whose spectrum is mostly\ninsensitive to the composition of the interior matter, should be a universal\nfeature of such BH-like objects. In fact, the frequency and damping time of\nthese modes are determined by only the object's mass and speed of rotation. The\nr-modes oscillate at a lower frequency, decay at a slower rate and produce\nweaker GWs than do modes of the spacetime class.

As detector sensitivity improves, this type of source\nis expected to make a large contribution to the overall number of detections,\nbut has received little attention compared to binary neutron star systems in\nstudies of projected network performance. We simulate the observation of a\nsystem like GW150914 with different proposed network configurations, and study\nthe precision of parameter estimates, particularly source location, orientation\nand masses. We find that the improvements to low frequency sensitivity that are\nexpected with continued commissioning will improve the precision of chirp mass\nestimates by an order of magnitude, whereas the improvements in sky location\nand orientation are driven by the expanded network configuration. This\ndemonstrates that both sensitivity and number of detectors will be important\nfactors in the scientific potential of second generation detector networks. \n\n"}

The generalization to rapid\nrotation is important because on one hand the rapid rotation can magnify the\ndeviations from general relativity compared to the static case and on the other\nhand some of the most efficient emitters of gravitational radiation, such as\nthe binary neutron star merger remnants, are supposed to be rotating close to\ntheir Kepler (mass-shedding) limits shortly after their formation.

As in the case of binary black holes, GWs generated\nby BNS consist of inspiral, merger, and post-merger components. Detecting the\nlatter is important because it encodes information about the nuclear equation\nof state (EOS) in a regime that cannot be probed prior to merger. The\npost-merger signal, however, can be observed by current detectors only out to~\n10 Mpc. We carry out Monte-Carlo simulations showing that the dominant\npost-merger signal (the 22 mode) from individual events will likely not be\nobservable even with the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer (CE), assuming\na full year of operation, the latest merger rates, and a detection threshold\nwith signal-to-noise ratio of 5. For this reason, we propose two methods that\nstack the post-merger signal from multiple events to boost the detection\nprobability. The first method follows a commonly-used practice of multiplying\nthe Bayes factors of individual events. The second method relies on an\nassumption that the mode phase can be determined from the inspiral waveform, so\nthat coherent mode stacking of the data from different events becomes possible.\nBoth methods significantly improve the chances of detecting the dominant\npost-merger signal, making a detection very likely after a year of observation\nwith CE for certain EOS. We also show that in terms of detection, coherent\nstacking is more efficient in accumulating confidence. Moreover, assuming a 22\nmode is detected with CE via stacking, we estimate through a Fisher analysis\nthat the peak frequency can be measured to a statistical error of ~ 4-20 Hz for\ncertain equations of state. Such an error corresponds to a NS radius\nmeasurement of ~ 15-56 m, a fractional relative error ~ 4 %, suggesting that\nsystematic errors from theoretical modeling (~ 100 m) may dominate the error\nbudget. \n\n"}

This resonant tide can induce phase shift in the\ngravitational waveforms, and potentially provide a new window of studying NS\ninterior using gravitational waves. Previous works have considered tidal\nexcitations of pure g-modes (due to stable stratification of the star) and pure\ninertial modes (due to Coriolis force), with the rotational effect treated in\nan approximate manner. However, for realistic NSs, the buoyancy and rotational\neffects can be comparable, giving rise to mixed inertial-gravity modes.

Using measurements\nof the effective spin of the binaries, which is LIGO's best constrained spin\nparameter, we introduce a simple parameter to quantify the fraction of the\npopulation that is isotropically distributed, regardless of the spin magnitude\ndistribution of the population.

One such set of universal relations between the moment of inertia $(I)$,\nthe tidal Love number and the quadrupole moment $(Q)$ has been studied both in\nGeneral Relativity and in modified theories. In this paper, we study the\nrelations in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a well-motivated, parity-violating\neffective field theory, extending previous work in various ways. First, we\nstudy how projected constraints on the theory using the I-Love relation depend\non the measurement accuracy of $I$ with radio observations and that of the Love\nnumber with gravitational-wave observations. Provided these quantities can be\nmeasured with future observations, we find that the latter could place bounds\non dynamical Chern-Simons gravity that are six orders of magnitude stronger\nthan current bounds. Second, we study the I-Q and Q-Love relations in this\ntheory by constructing slowly-rotating neutron star solutions to quadratic\norder in spin. We find that the approximate universality continues to hold in\ndynamical Chern-Simons gravity, and in fact, it becomes stronger than in\nGeneral Relativity, although its existence depends on the normalization of the\ndimensional coupling constant of the theory. Finally, we study the variation of\nthe eccentricity of isodensity contours inside a star and its relation to the\ndegree of universality. We find that, in most cases, the eccentricity variation\nis smaller in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity than in General Relativity,\nproviding further support to the idea that the approximate self-similarity of\nisodensity contours is responsible for universality. \n\n"}

In general, the empirical relationship\nof SNIa on the absolute peak magnitude $M_{\\rm B}$ is calibrated by Cepheid\nvariables in the near distance scale and directly extrapolated to much farther\ndistances. Two main problems arise.

Abstract: The prevalent opinion that infalling objects can freely cross a black hole\nhorizon is based on the assumptions that the horizon region is governed by\nclassical General Relativity and by specific singular coordinate\ntransformations it is possible to remove divergences in the geodesic equations.\nHowever, the coordinate transformations usually used to demonstrate the\ngeodesic completeness are of class $C^0$, while the standard causality theory\nrequires that the metric tensor to be at least $C^1$. Introduction of\n$C^0$-class functions leads to the appearance of the additional delta-like\nsources in the Einstein equations and in the equations for quantum particles.\nTherefore, to explore the horizon region, in addition to the classical geodesic\nequations, one needs to use equation of quantum particles. Applying physical\nboundary conditions at the Schwarzschild and Kerr event horizons, we show\nexistence of the exponentially decay/enhanced solutions (with the complex\nphases) to the Klein-Gordon equation. This means that in semi-classical\napproximation particles probably do not enter the black hole horizon, but are\nabsorbed/reflected by it.

The minimum set of postulates to be introduced is that\n(i) the action principle should apply and that(ii) the total action should by\nform-invariant under the (local) diffeomorphism group. The second postulate\nthus implements the Principle of General Relativity. According to Noether's\ntheorem, this physical symmetry gives rise to a conserved Noether current, from\nwhich the complete set of theories compatible with both postulates can be\ndeduced. This finally results in a new generic Einstein-type equation, which\ncan be interpreted as an energy-momentum balance equation emerging from the\nLagrangian $L_{R}$ for the source-free dynamics of gravitation and the\nenergy-momentum tensor of the source system $L_{0}$.

This\npost-Newtonian gravitomagnetic driving of these modes dominates over the\nNewtonian tidal driving previously computed by Ho and Lai. To leading order in\nthe tidal expansion parameter R/r (where R is the radius of the neutron star\nand r is the orbital separation), only the l=2, |m|= 1 and |m| = 2 r-modes are\nexcited. The tidal work done on the star through this driving has an effect on\nthe evolution of the inspiral and on the phasing of the emitted gravitational\nwave signal. For a neutron star of mass M, radius R, spin frequency f_spin,\nmodeled as a Gamma =2 polytrope, with a companion also of mass M, the\ngravitational wave phase shift for the m=2 mode is\n(0.1radians)(R/10km)^4(M/1.4M_sun)^{-10/3}(f_spin/100Hz)^{2/3} for optimal spin\norientation.

They are `topological\ndefects' that may have been formed at phase transitions in the very early\nhistory of the Universe, analogous to those found in some condensed-matter\nsystems --- vortex lines in liquid helium, flux tubes in type-II\nsuperconductors, or disclination lines in liquid crystals.

The EFT allows for a\nclean separation of the three relevant scales: r_s, the size of the compact\nobjects, r the orbital radius and r/v, the wavelength of the physical radiation\n(where the velocity v is the expansion parameter). In the EFT radiation is\nsystematically included in the v expansion without need to separate integrals\ninto near zones and radiation zones.
