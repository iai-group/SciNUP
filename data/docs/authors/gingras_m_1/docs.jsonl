The width of the segments depends on both alpha and\nthe ratio J/g. Our Monte Carlo study shows that the on-site magnetization\nvanishes at finite temperatures and finds no indication of any phase\ntransition.

At the\ncritical point and in the continuum limit, the density (i.e., frequency of\noccurrence) of pinch-point events between s distinct boundary clusters at a\nbulk point w in P is proportional to\n<psi_1^c(w_1)psi_1^c(w_2)...psi_1^c(w_{2N-1})psi_1^c(w_{2N})Psi_s(w)>_P. The\nw_i are the vertices of P, psi_1^c is a conformal field theory (CFT) corner\none-leg operator, and Psi_s is a CFT bulk 2s-leg operator.

Most complex\nsystems have an inherently hierarchical organization and, correspondingly, the\nnetworks behind them also exhibit hierarchical features. Indeed, several papers\nhave been devoted to describing this essential aspect of networks, however,\nwithout resulting in a widely accepted, converging concept concerning the\nquantitative characterization of the level of their hierarchy. Here we develop\nan approach and propose a quantity (measure) which is simple enough to be\nwidely applicable, reveals a number of universal features of the organization\nof real-world networks and, as we demonstrate, is capable of capturing the\nessential features of the structure and the degree of hierarchy in a complex\nnetwork.

While the TTLS model can be modified,\nparticularly by including long range phonon induced interactions to explain the\nuniversal value of Q, (a) it is not clear that the essential features of the\noriginal model that has been successful in explaining the experimental data is\npreserved, and (b) even if it is, it is not clear that the postulates of the\noriginal model remain necessary.

On the other hand, quantum time evolution of the same systems\ninvolves all energies and it is therefore thought to be much harder, if at all\npossible, to have sharp transitions in the dynamics. In this paper we show that\nphase transitions characterized by universal singularities do occur in the time\nevolution of random spin chains. The sharpness of the transitions and integrity\nof the phases owes to many-body localization, which prevents thermalization in\nthese systems. Using a renormalization group approach, we solve the time\nevolution of random Ising spin chains with generic interactions starting from\ninitial states of arbitrary energy. As a function of the Hamiltonian\nparameters, the system is tuned through a dynamical transition, similar to the\nground state critical point, at which the local spin correlations establish\ntrue long range temporal order. In the state with dominant transverse field, a\nspin that starts in an up state loses its orientation with time, while in the\n\"ordered\" state it never does.

In\nparticular, the lowest energy density at which the eigenstates of such a clean\nmany body atomic system undergo a non-analytic change is that of the melting\n(or freezing) transition. We invoke this observation to analyze the evolution\nof a liquid upon supercooling (i.e., cooling rapidly enough to avoid\nsolidification below the freezing temperature). Expanding the wavefunction of a\nsupercooled liquid in the complete eigenbasis of the many-body Hamiltonian,\nonly the higher energy liquid-type eigenstates contribute significantly to\nmeasurable hydrodynamic relaxations (e.g., those probed by viscosity) while\nstatic thermodynamic observables become weighted averages over both solid- and\nliquid-type eigenstates.

We find that, while strong correlations make\nsuperconductivity in this system immune to weak disorder, superconductivity is\ndestroyed efficiently when disorder strength is comparable to the effective\nbandwidth. The suppression of charge motion in regions of strong potential\nfluctuation leads to formation of Mott insulating patches, which anchor a\nlarger non-superconducting region around them.

It is\nwell known that dimensional reduction is not true in three dimensions, thus\ninvalidating the perturbative renormalization group prediction. Here, we report\nhigh-precision numerical simulations of the 5D random-field Ising model at zero\ntemperature. We illustrate universality by comparing different probability\ndistributions for the random fields.

It is found that an\narbitrarily weak disorder drives the double-Weyl semimetal to undergo a quantum\nphase transition into a compressible diffusive metal, independent of the\ndisorder type and the Coulomb interaction strength. In contrast, the nature of\nthe ground state of triple-Weyl fermion system relies sensitively on the\nspecific disorder type in the noninteracting limit: The system is turned into a\ncompressible diffusive metal state by an arbitrarily weak random scalar\npotential or $z$ component of random vector potential but exhibits stable\ncritical behavior when there is only $x$ or $y$ component of random vector\npotential. In case the triple-Weyl fermions couple to random scalar potential,\nthe system becomes a diffusive metal in the weak interaction regime but remains\na semimetal if Coulomb interaction is sufficiently strong. Interplay of Coulomb\ninteraction and $x$, or $y$, component of random vector potential leads to a\nstable infrared fixed point that is likely to be characterized by critical\nbehavior. When Coulomb interaction coexists with the $z$ component of random\nvector potential, the system flows to the interaction-dominated strong coupling\nregime, which might drive a Mott insulating transition. It is thus clear that\ndouble- and triple-Weyl fermions exhibit distinct low-energy behavior in\nresponse to interaction and disorder. The physical explanation of such\ndistinction is discussed in detail. The role played by long-range Coulomb\nimpurity in triple-Weyl semimetal is also considered. \n\n"}

Employing effective boson\ntheories for the electron models and renormalization group (RG) analyses for\nthe boson theories, we show that there exist critical interaction strengths\nabove which the umklapp processes become relevant and the system enter\nexcitonic insulator phases with long-range order of spin superconducting phase\nfields (\"spin nematic excitonic insulator\"). We argue that, when a pair of\nelectron and hole pockets get smaller in size, a quantum fluctuation of the\nspin superconducting phase becomes larger and destabilizes the excitonic\ninsulator phases, resulting in the re-entrant IM transitions. We also show that\nan odd-parity excitonic pairing between the electron and hole pockets\nreconstruct surface chiral Fermi arc states of electron and hole into a\n2-dimensional helical surface state with a gapless Dirac cone. We discuss\nfield- and temperature-dependences of in-plane resistance by surface transports\nvia these surface states. \n\n"}

The orientation (which is formally\nlike a spin degree of freedom) determines the self-propulsion direction. The\nbonds represent the possibility to make transitions: to hop between locations;\nor to switch the orientation. In systems of experimental interest (Janus\nparticles), the self-propulsion is induced by illumination. An emergent aspect\nis the topological stochastic disorder (TSD).

Despite the broad relevance of such a scenario to\nmetallic systems, there have been limited investigations of the entanglement\nstructure of the resulting long-time states, in part, due to the fundamental\ndifficulty in solving realistic models for disordered, interacting electrons.\nWe investigate this problem by carefully analyzing two \"toy\" models for\ncoherent quantum transport of diffusive fermions: the celebrated\nthree-dimensional, noninteracting Anderson model and a class of random quantum\ncircuits acting on a chain of qubits, which exactly maps to a diffusive,\ninteracting fermion problem.

Here, we propose a network filtering methodology based on a family\nof null hypotheses that can be calibrated to assess which links are\nstatistically significant with respect to a given network's own heterogeneity.\nWe design such family of null hypotheses by adapting the P\\'olya urn, a simple\none-parameter combinatorial model driven by a self-reinforcement mechanism, to\na network setting. We provide a full analytical description of our filter, and\nshow that it retains or discards links based on a non-trivial interplay between\ntheir own local importance and the importance of the nodes they belong to. We\nprove that the widely used disparity filter can be recovered as a\nlarge-strength approximation for a specific value of the P\\'olya filter's\nparameter, and illustrate our findings by applying the filter to two large\nnetwork datasets. \n\n"}

Such models are useful in the study\nof the structure and growth dynamics of gene regulatory networks and scientific\ncitation networks. Starting from an initial seed network, at each time step a\nrandom node, a mother node, is selected for duplication. Its daughter node is\nadded to the network and duplicates each outgoing link of the mother node with\nprobability p. In addition, the daughter node forms a directed link to the\nmother node itself. We obtain analytical results for the in-degree distribution\n$P_t(K_{in}=k)$, and for the out-degree distribution $P_t(K_{out}=k)$ at time\nt. The in-degrees follow a shifted power-law, so the network is asymptotically\nscale free. In contrast, the out-degree distribution is narrow, and converges\nto a Poisson distribution in the sparse network limit and to a Gaussian\ndistribution in the dense network limit. Such distinction between a broad\nin-degree distribution and a narrow out-degree distribution is common in\nempirical networks such as scientific citation networks.

This localization can be understood as a consequence of the\nreturn properties of low dimensional random walks, through a mechanism\nreminiscent of weak localization, but insensitive to dephasing. The charge\ndynamics is well-described by a system of coupled hydrodynamic equations, which\nmakes several nontrivial predictions in good agreement with numerics.\nImportantly, these equations also predict localization in 2d fractonic\ncircuits.

While the simplest Bell pair model has area law entanglement\nfor any measurement rate, as seen in certain non-interacting systems, we show\nthat more generic models of entanglement can feature an area-to-volume law\ntransition at a critical value of the measurement rate, in agreement with\nrecent numerical investigations.

Memory connotes the ability to encode, access, and erase\nsignatures of past history in the state of a system. Once the system has\ncompletely relaxed to thermal equilibrium, it is no longer able to recall\naspects of its evolution. Memory of initial conditions or previous training\nprotocols will be lost. Thus many forms of memory are intrinsically tied to\nfar-from-equilibrium behavior and to transient response to a perturbation. This\ngeneral behavior arises in diverse contexts in condensed matter physics and\nmaterials: phase change memory, shape memory, echoes, memory effects in\nglasses, return-point memory in disordered magnets, as well as related contexts\nin computer science. Yet, as opposed to the situation in biology, there is\ncurrently no common categorization and description of the memory behavior that\nappears to be prevalent throughout condensed-matter systems. Here we focus on\nmaterial memories. We will describe the basic phenomenology of a few of the\nknown behaviors that can be understood as constituting a memory. We hope that\nthis will be a guide towards developing the unifying conceptual underpinnings\nfor a broad understanding of memory effects that appear in materials. \n\n"}

By multiplying all the bond tensions in this state of\nself stress by the same number---which with the appropriate normalization\ncorresponds to the physical pre-stress inside the frame---we systematically\nevaluate the linear mechanical response of the frame as a function of\npre-stress.

The Feshbach resonance\ndescribes a composite quasi-Boson, which can give rise to an additional pairing\ninteraction between the Fermi atoms. This attractive interaction becomes\nstronger as the threshold energy of the Feshbach resonance two-particle bound\nstate is lowered. In a recent paper, we showed that in the uniform Fermi gas,\nthis tunable pairing interaction naturally leads to a BCS-BEC crossover of the\nNozi`eres and Schmitt-Rink kind, in which the BCS-type superfluid phase\ntransition continuously changes into the BEC-type as the threshold energy is\ndecreased. In this paper, we extend our previous work by including the effect\nof a harmonic trap potential, treated within the local density approximation\n(LDA). We also give results for both weak and strong coupling to the Feshbach\nresonance. We show that the BCS-BEC crossover phenomenon strongly modifies the\nshape of the atomic density profile at the superfluid phase transition\ntemperature Tc, reflecting the change of the dominant particles going from\nFermi atoms to composite Bosons.

First, we note that the symmetry breaking transition of the\nferromagetic Ising model maps onto a non-symmetry breaking transition in dimer\nlanguage -- instead it becomes a deconfinement transition for test monomers.\nNext, we introduce a modification of Fisher's mapping in which a second dimer\nmodel, also equivalent to the Ising model, is defined on a generically\ndifferent lattice derived from the dual. In contrast to Fisher's original\nmapping, this enables us to reformulate frustrated Ising models as dimer models\nwith positive weights and we illustrate this by providing a new solution of the\nfully frustrated Ising model on the square lattice. Finally, by means of the\nmodified mapping we show that a large class of three-dimensional Ising models\nare precisely equivalent, in the time continuum limit, to particular quantum\ndimer models. As Ising models in three dimensions are dual to Ising gauge\ntheories, this further yields an exact map between the latter and the quantum\ndimer models.

In the case of silo drainage, many continuum\nmodels have been developed for the mean flow, but no realistic statistical\ntheory is available. Here, we propose that particles undergo cooperative\ndisplacements in response to diffusing ``spots'' of free volume. The typical\nspot size is several particle diameters, so cages of nearest neighbors tend to\nremain intact over large distances. The spot hypothesis relates diffusion and\ncage-breaking to volume fluctuations and spatial velocity correlations, in\nagreement with new experimental data. It also predicts density waves caused by\nweak spot interactions. Spots enable fast, multiscale simulations of dense\nflows, in which a small, internal relaxation enforces packing constraints\nduring spot-induced motion. In the continuum limit of the model, tracer\ndiffusion is described by a new stochastic differential equation, where the\ndrift velocity and diffusion tensor are coupled non-locally to the spot\ndensity.

The\nexperimentally determined energy level structure suggests a local <111> Ising\nantiferromagnet at low temperatures, T < 10 K.

Nevertheless, the results of those\nauthors suggests that there is a critical field near B=0.4 at zero temperature.\nIn view of this quite small value (compared to the mean field value), we have\nreanalyzed our data. We find that if finite size scaling is to distinguish\nbetween that small field and a zero field, we would need to go to lattice sizes\nof about 20x20x20. \n\n"}

Unfortunately, the classical definitions of\nthermodynamic quantities such as entropy and specific heat are not invariant\nunder the thermal duality symmetry. In this paper, we investigate whether there\nmight nevertheless exist special solutions for the string effective potential\nsuch that the duality symmetry will be preserved for all thermodynamic\nquantities. Imposing this as a constraint, we derive a series of unique\nfunctional forms for the complete temperature-dependence of the required string\neffective potentials. Moreover, we demonstrate that these solutions\nsuccessfully capture the leading behavior of a variety of actual one-loop\neffective potentials for duality-covariant finite-temperature string ground\nstates. This leads us to conjecture that our solutions might actually represent\nthe exact effective potentials when contributions from all orders of\nperturbation theory are included. \n\n"}

Here we investigate the\ndynamics of visitation of a major news portal, representing the prototype for\nsuch a rapidly evolving network. The nodes of the network can be classified\ninto stable nodes, that form the time independent skeleton of the portal, and\nnews documents. The visitation of the two node classes are markedly different,\nthe skeleton acquiring visits at a constant rate, while a news document's\nvisitation peaking after a few hours. We find that the visitation pattern of a\nnews document decays as a power law, in contrast with the exponential\nprediction provided by simple models of site visitation. This is rooted in the\ninhomogeneous nature of the browsing pattern characterizing individual users:\nthe time interval between consecutive visits by the same user to the site\nfollows a power law distribution, in contrast with the exponential expected for\nPoisson processes. We show that the exponent characterizing the individual\nuser's browsing patterns determines the power-law decay in a document's\nvisitation.

The present work addresses a particularly\nimportant related aspect, namely the quantification of how well separated can\nthe attractors be in dynamic systems underlined by four types of complex\nnetworks (Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi, Barab\\'asi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz and as well as a\ngeographic model). Attention is focused on grandmother dynamic systems, where\neach state variable (associated to each node) is used to represent a specific\nprototype pattern (attractor). By assuming that the attractors spread their\ninfluence among its neighboring nodes through a diffusive process, it is\npossible to overlook the specific details of specific dynamics and focus\nattention on the separability among such attractors. This property is defined\nin terms of two separation indices (one individual to each prototype and the\nother considering also the immediate neighborhood) reflecting the balance and\nproximity to attractors revealed by the activation of the network after a\ndiffusive process. The separation index considering also the neighborhood was\nfound to be much more informative, while the best separability was observed for\nthe Watts-Strogatz and the geographic models. The effects of the involved\nparameters on the separability were investigated by correlation and path\nanalyses. The obtained results suggest the special importance of some\nmeasurements in underlying the relationship between topology and dynamics. \n\n"}
