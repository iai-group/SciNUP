Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

This means that some of the essential steps\n(such as the development of eukaryotes) in the evolution process leading to the\nultimate emergence of intelligent life would have been hard, in the sense of\nbeing against the odds in the available time, so that they are unlikely to have\nbeen achieved in most of the earth-like planets that may one day be discovered\nin nearby extra-solar systems. It was originally estimated that only one or two\nof the essential evolutionary steps had to have been hard in this sense, but it\nhas become apparent that this figure may need upward revision, because recent\nstudies of climatic instability suggest that the possible future duration of\nour biologically favourable environment may be shorter than had been supposed,\nonly about one Giga year rather than five. On the basis of the statistical\nrequirement of roughly equal spacing between hard steps, it is argued that the\nbest fit with the fossil record is now obtainable by postulating the number of\nhard steps to be five, if our evolution was exclusively terrestrial, or six if,\nas now seems very plausible, the first step occurred on Mars. \n\n"}

We investigate two\nsimple scenarios for explaining the observed Ly-a and rest-frame UV luminosity\nfunctions (LFs) of LAEs: (i) the \"escape fraction\" scenario, in which the\n\"effective\" escape fraction (including the IGM attenuation) of Ly-a photons is\nf_Lya ~0.1 (0.15) at z=3 (6), and (ii) the \"stochastic\" scenario, in which the\nfraction of LAEs that are turned on at z=3 (6) is \\Cstoc ~0.07 (0.2) after\ncorrecting for the IGM attenuation. Our comparisons with a number of different\nobservations suggest that the stochastic scenario is preferred over the escape\nfraction scenario. We find that the mean values of stellar mass, metallicity\nand black hole mass hosted by LAEs are all smaller in the stochastic scenario\nthan in the escape fraction scenario. In our simulations, the galaxy stellar\nmass function evolves rapidly, as expected in hierarchical structure formation.\nHowever, its evolution is largely compensated by a beginning decline in the\nspecific star formation rate, resulting in little evolution of the rest-frame\nUV LF from z=6 to 3.

By comparing the iron abundances [Fe/H]\nwith calcium triplet (CaT) metallicities we show that the empirical CaT\ntechnique yields good agreement with the high-resolution data for [Fe/H]>-2\ndex, but tends to deviate at lower metallicities. We identify two metal poor\nstars with iron abundances of -2.72 and -2.50 dex. These stars are found to\nhave enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios similar to those of stars in the Milky Way\nhalo. However, the bulk of the Carina red giants are depleted in the [alpha/Fe]\nabundance ratios with respect to the Galactic halo at a given metallicity. One\nof our targets, with a [Fe/H] of -1.5 dex, is considerably depleted in almost\nall of the alpha-elements by ~0.5 dex compared to the solar values. Such a low\n[alpha/Fe] can be produced by stochastical fluctuations in terms of an\nincomplete mixing of single Type Ia and II SNe events into the ISM.

The main aim of this work is to establish the\nobservational foundation for the XMM-Newton Distant Cluster Project (XDCP).\nThis new serendipitous survey is focused on the most distant systems at z>1,\nbased on the selection of extended X-ray sources, their identification as\nclusters via two-band imaging, and their final spectroscopic confirmation.\nAlmost 1000 extended sources were selected as cluster candidates from the\nanalysis of 80 deg^2 of deep XMM-Newton archival data, of which 75% could be\nreadily identified as systems at z<~0.6. For the remaining 250 distant cluster\ncandidates a new strategy for their confirmation and redshift estimates was\nadopted, based on Z- and H-band photometry and the observed Z-H red-sequence\ncolor of early-type cluster galaxies. From observations of 25% of the sample,\nmore than 20 X-ray clusters were discovered at a photometric redshift of\nz>~0.9.

From a comparison of the\nobserved color evolution of the red-sequence with model predictions, the\nformation epoch of early-type galaxies could be constrained as z_f=4.2+-1.1,\nconfirming their well-established old age.

We demonstrate that rapid (\\Delta\nz< 0.1-0.2), strong (\\Delta T > 10^4 K) photo-heating is difficult to achieve\nacross the entire IGM unless quasar spectra are significantly harder than\nimplied by current observational constraints. Although filtering of intrinsic\nquasar radiation through dense regions in the IGM does increase the mean excess\nenergy per HeII photo-ionisation, it also weakens the radiation intensity and\nlowers the photo-ionisation rate, preventing rapid heating over time intervals\nshorter than the local photo-ionisation timescale. Moreover, the hard photons\nresponsible for the strongest heating are more likely to deposit their energy\ninside dense clumps. The abundance of such clumps is, however, uncertain and\nmodel-dependent, leading to a fairly large uncertainty in the photo-heating\nrates. Nevertheless, although some of the IGM may be exposed to a hardened and\nweakened ionising background for long periods, most of the IGM must instead be\nreionised by the more abundant, softer photons and with accordingly modest\nheating rates (\\Delta T < 10^4 K). The repeated ionisation of fossil quasar\nHeIII regions does not increase the net heating because the recombination times\nin these regions typically exceed the IGM cooling times and the average time\nlag between successive rounds of quasar activity.

This is\nparticularly motivated by recent indications from HYMORS. Exploiting high\nresolution, numerical simulations, we demonstrate that for both high and low\nenergy jets, always at high Lorentz factor, a transition to a higher density\nenvironment can cause a significant fraction of the directed jet energy to be\nlost on reflection. This can explain how one-sided jet deceleration and a\ntransition to FR I type can occur in HYMORS, which start as FR II (and remain\nso on the other side). For that purpose, we implemented in the relativistic\nhydrodynamic grid-adaptive AMRVAC code, the Synge-type equation of state\nintroduced in the general polytropic case by Meliani et al. (2004). We present\nresults for 10 model computations, varying the inlet Lorentz factor from 10 to\n20, including uniform or decreasing density profiles, and allowing for\ncylindrical versus conical jet models.

We focus on\nwinds from OB-stars, with some excursions to the Luminous Blue Variables, Wolf-\nRayet stars, A-supergiants and Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae. After reca-\npitulating the 1-D, stationary standard model of line-driven wind, extensions\naccounting for rotation and magnetic fields are discussed.

We summarize diagnostical methods to\ninfer wind properties from observations, and compare the results with theore-\ntical predictions, featuring the massloss-metallicity dependence. Subsequently,\nwe concentrate on two urgent problems which challenge our present understanding\nof radiation driven winds: weak winds and wind- clumping.

We investigate the total MF and the\ncontribution of ETGs and LTGs, defined by different criteria (SED, morphology\nor star formation). We unveil a galaxy bimodality in the global MF, better\nrepresented by 2 Schechter functions dominated by ETGs and LTGs, respectively.\nFor the global population we confirm that low-mass galaxies number density\nincreases later and faster than for massive galaxies. We find that the MF\nevolution at intermediate-low values of Mstar (logM<10.6) is mostly explained\nby the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formation\nactivities. The low residual evolution is consistent with ~0.16 merger per\ngalaxy per Gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major). We find that ETGs increase\nin number density with cosmic time faster for decreasing Mstar, with a median\n\"building redshift\" increasing with mass, in contrast with hierarchical models.\nFor LTGs we find that the number density of blue or spiral galaxies remains\nalmost constant from z~1. Instead, the most extreme population of active star\nforming galaxies is rapidly decreasing in number density. We suggest a\ntransformation from blue active spirals of intermediate mass into blue\nquiescent and successively (1-2 Gyr after) into red passive types. The complete\nmorphological transformation into red spheroidals, required longer time-scales\nor follows after 1-2 Gyr.

Using rest-frame B-band selected samples, the\ngroups galaxy population exhibits significant blueing as redshift increases,\nbut maintains a lower F_blue with respect both to the global and the isolated\ngalaxy population. However moving to mass selected samples it becomes apparent\nthat such differences are largely due to the biased view imposed by the B-band\nluminosity selection, being driven by the population of lower mass, bright blue\ngalaxies for which we miss the redder, equally low mass, counterparts.

Here, a review is given of the\nevidence that supports the existence of jets from accreting stellar-mass black\nholes, from observations made at optical and infrared wavelengths.

We sample the\nentire range in galaxy luminosity (Mv = -11 to -23 mag = 10^6 - 10^11 L_sol),\nenvironment, and morphology. Irrespective of galaxy type, we confirm the\nincrease of the S_N-value above and below a galaxy magnitude of Mv = -20 mag.\nOver the full mass range, the S_L-value of early-type galaxies is, on average,\ntwice that of late-types. To investigate the observed trends we derive\ntheoretical predictions of GC system scaling parameters as a function of host\ngalaxy mass based on the models of Dekel & Birnboim (2006) in which\nstar-formation processes are regulated by stellar and supernova feedback below\na stellar mass of 3x10^10 M_sol, and by virial shocks above it. We find that\nthe analytical model describes remarkably well the shape of the GC system\nscaling parameter distributions with a universal specific GC formation\nefficiency, eta, which relates the total mass in GCs to the total galaxy halo\nmass. Early-type and late-type galaxies show a similar mean value of eta =\n5.5e-5, with an increasing scatter towards lower galaxy masses. This can be due\nto the enhanced stochastic nature of the star and star-cluster formation\nprocesses for such systems. Some massive galaxies have excess eta values\ncompared to what is expected from the mean model prediction for galaxies more\nluminous than Mv = -20 mag (Lv=10^10L_sol). This may be attributed to a very\nefficient early GC formation, less efficient production of field stars or\naccretion of predominantly low-mass/luminosity high-eta galaxies, or a mixture\nof all these effects.

The method developed here can be used to\nstudy other physically-based choices for the halo distribution function and the\ncase of a disk accompanied by a bulge. In a preliminary investigation we note\nthe existence of a fine tuning between the scalelengths R_{\\Omega} and h,\nrespectively characterizing the rise of the rotation curve and the luminosity\nprofile of the disk, which surprisingly applies to both high surface brightness\nand low surface brightness galaxies. This empirical correlation identifies a\nmuch stronger conspiracy than the one required by the smoothness and flatness\nof the rotation curve (disk-halo conspiracy). The self-consistent models are\ncharacterized by smooth and flat rotation curves for very different\ndisk-to-halo mass ratios, hence suggesting that conspiracy is not as dramatic\nas often imagined. For a typical rotation curve, with asymptotically flat\nrotation curve at V_{\\infty} (the precise value of which can also be treated as\na free parameter), and a typical density profile of the disk, self-consistent\nmodels are characterized by two dimensionless parameters, which correspond to\nthe dimensional scales (the disk mass-to-light ratio M/L and the halo central\ndensity) of standard disk-halo decompositions.

This gives a consistent description of the quenching\nmechanism in mean-field dynamo models. The main goal of this work is to explore\nthe effects of this quenching mechanism in solar-like geometry, and in\nparticular to investigate the role of magnetic helicity fluxes, specifically\ndiffusive and Vishniac-Cho (VC) fluxes, at large magnetic Reynolds numbers\n(Rm). For models with negative radial shear or positive latitudinal shear, the\nmagnetic alpha effect has predominantly negative (positive) sign in the\nnorthern (southern) hemisphere. In the absence of fluxes, we find that the\nmagnetic energy follows an Rm^-1 dependence, as found in previous works. This\ncatastrophic quenching is alleviated in models with diffusive magnetic helicity\nfluxes resulting in magnetic fields comparable to the equipartition value even\nfor Rm=10^7. On the other hand, models with a shear-driven Vishniac-Cho flux\nshow an increase of the amplitude of the magnetic field with respect to models\nwithout fluxes, but only for Rm<10^4. This is mainly a consequence of assuming\na vacuum outside the Sun which cannot support a significant VC flux across the\nboundary. However, in contrast with the diffusive flux, the VC flux modifies\nthe distribution of the magnetic field.

Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation.

The goal of this study is to examine the imprint of the de Vaucouleurs\nclassification volume in the 3.6 micron band, which is the best Spitzer\nwaveband for galactic stellar mass morphology owing to its depth and its\nreddening-free sensitivity mainly to older stars. For this purpose, we have\nprepared classification images for 207 galaxies from the Spitzer archive, most\nof which are formally part of the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in\nGalaxies (S^4G), a Spitzer post-cryogenic (\"warm\") mission Exploration Science\nLegacy Program survey of 2,331 galaxies closer than 40 Mpc. For the purposes of\nmorphology, the galaxies are interpreted as if the images are {\\it blue light},\nthe historical waveband for classical galaxy classification studies. We find\nthat 3.6 micron classifications are well-correlated with blue-light\nclassifications, to the point where the essential features of many galaxies\nlook very similar in the two very different wavelength regimes. Drastic\ndifferences are found only for the most dusty galaxies. Consistent with a\nprevious study by Eskridge et al.

We supplement these with archival data\nin the B, J, H, and K bands. We use the 8um, 24um and FUV (1500\\AA) emission to\nstudy the star formation rate (SFR). We find that globally, these tracers of\nstar formation give a range of results of ~6-11\\msun/yr, with the\ndust-corrected FUV giving the highest value of SFR. We can reconcile the UV and\nIR-based estimates by adopting a steeper UV extinction curve that lies in\nbetween the starburst (Calzetti) and SMC extinction curves. However, the\nregions of highest SFR intensity along the spiral arms are consistent with a\nstarburst-like extinction. Overall, the level of star-formation we find is\nhigher than previously published for this galaxy, by about a factor of two,\nwhich, contrary to previous conclusions, implies that the interaction that\ncaused the distorted morphology of NGC2442 likely also triggered increased\nlevels of star-formation activity.

We measure the\nduration of starbursts in twenty nearby, ongoing, and \"fossil\" starbursts in\ndwarf galaxies based on the recent star formation histories derived from\nresolved stellar population data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope.\nContrary to the shorter times of 3-10 Myr often cited, the starburst durations\nwe measure range from 450 - 650 Myr in fifteen of the dwarf galaxies and up to\n1.3 Gyr in four galaxies; these longer durations are comparable to or longer\nthan the dynamical timescales for each system.

We construct a quark equation of state, based on the\nbag model for strange quark matter. The transition between the hadronic and the\nquark phases is constructed applying Gibbs conditions. The resulting\nquark-hadron hybrid equations of state are used in core-collapse supernova\nsimulations, based on general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics and three\nflavor Boltzmann neutrino transport in spherical symmetry. The formation of a\nmixed phase reduces the adiabatic index, which induces the gravitational\ncollapse of the central protoneutron star. The collapse halts in the pure quark\nphase, where the adiabatic index increases. A strong accretion shock forms,\nwhich propagates towards the protoneutron star surface. Due to the density\ndecrease of several orders of magnitude, the accretion shock turns into a\ndynamic shock with matter outflow. This moment defines the onset of the\nexplosion in supernova models that allow for a quark-hadron phase transition,\nwhere otherwise no explosions could be obtained.

In order to understand the origin of S0s\nin groups, we investigate numerically the morphological transformation of\nspirals into S0s through group-related physical processes. Our chemodynamical\nsimulations show that spirals in group environments can be strongly influenced\nby repetitive slow encounters with group member galaxies so that those with\nthin disks and prominent spiral arm structures can be transformed into S0s with\nthick disks and without prominent spiral arm structure. Such tidal interactions\ncan also trigger repetitive starbursts within the bulges of spirals and\nconsequently increase significantly the masses of their bulges. Owing to rapid\nconsumption of gas initially in spirals during the bulge growth, the S0s can\nbecome gas-poor. The S0s transformed from spirals in this way have young and\nmetal-rich stellar populations in the inner regions of their bulges. The\nsimulated S0s have lower maximum rotational velocities and flatter radial\nline-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles in comparison to their progenitor\nspirals.

Two kinds of broad emission line region (BELR) models\nhave been proposed, outflow and gravitationally bound BELR, which are supported\nrespectively by blueshift of the CIV line and reverberation mapping\nobservations. To reconcile these two apparently different models, we present a\ndetailed comparison study between the CIV and MgII lines using a sample of AGNs\nselected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the kinematics of the\nCIV region is different from that of MgII, which is thought to be controlled by\ngravity. A strong correlation is found between the blueshift and asymmetry of\nthe CIV profile and the Eddington ratio. This provides strong observational\nsupport for the postulation that the outflow is driven by radiation pressure.\nIn particular, we find robust evidence that the CIV line region is largely\ndominated by outflow at high Eddington ratios, while it is primarily\ngravitationally bounded at low Eddington ratios. Our results indicate that\nthese two emitting regions coexist in most of AGNs. The emission strength from\nthese two gases varies smoothly with Eddington ratio in opposite ways. This\nexplanation naturally reconciles the apparently contradictory views proposed in\nprevious studies. Finally, candidate models are discussed which can account for\nboth, the enhancement of outflow emission and suppression of normal BEL, in AGN\nwith high Eddington ratios. \n\n"}

The beaming effect is due\nto the increase (decrease) of the brightness of any light source approaching\n(receding from) the observer. To first order, the beaming and the\nreflection/heating effects modulate the stellar brightness at the orbital\nperiod, with phases separated by a quarter of a period, whereas the ellipsoidal\neffect is modulated with the orbital first harmonic.

In general the\nassumptions of the chi^2 method are not verified, and it only gives a rough\nestimate of the significance.

The\nso called local bias model, where galaxy density is a function of local matter\ndensity, is frequently discussed as a means to infer the matter power spectrum\nor correlation function from the measured galaxy correlation. However,\ngravitational evolution generates a term quadratic in the tidal tensor and thus\nnon-local in the density field, even if this term is absent in the initial\nconditions (Lagrangian space). Because the term is quadratic, it contributes as\na loop correction to the power spectrum, so the standard linear bias picture\nstill applies on large scales, however, it contributes at leading order to the\nbispectrum for which it is significant on all scales. Such a term could also be\npresent in Lagrangian space if halo formation were influenced by the tidal\nfield. We measure the corresponding coupling strengths from the\nmatter-matter-halo bispectrum in numerical simulations and find a non-vanishing\ncoefficient for the tidal tensor term. We find no scale dependence of the bias\nparameters up to k=0.1 h/Mpc and that the tidal effect is increasing with halo\nmass. While the Lagrangian bias picture is a better description of our results\nthan the Eulerian bias picture, our results suggest that there might be a tidal\ntensor bias already in the initial conditions. We also find that the\ncoefficients of the quadratic density term deviate quite strongly from the\ntheoretical predictions based on the spherical collapse model and a universal\nmass function.

Detection is now within reach of current observatories (Fermi-LAT or\nCerenkov telescopes); however, assessing the origin of this signal might be\ndifficult. We investigate whether the behaviour of the number of objects per\n`flux' bin (logN-logF) and that of the stacked signal could be used as a\nsignature of the dominant process at stake.We use the CLUMPY code to integrate\nthe signal from decaying or annihilating dark matter and cosmic rays along the\nline of sight. We assume the standard NFW profile for the dark matter density\nand rely on a parametrised emissivity for the cosmic-ray component. In this\ncontext, the consequences of stacking are explored using the MCXC\nmeta-catalogue of galaxy clusters. We find the value of the slope of the\nlogN-logF power law (or the increase of the signal with the number of stacked\nobjects) to be a clear diagnosis to disentangle decaying dark matter from\ncosmic-ray induced gamma-rays. For dark matter annihilation, depending on the\nsignal boost from the substructures, it is either similar to the cosmic-ray\nsignal (no boost) or similar to the decay case (large boosts).

One proposed signature of oceans is\nspecular reflection (\"glint\"), which increases the apparent albedo of a planet\nat crescent phases. We post-process a global climate model of an Earth-like\nplanet to simulate reflected lightcurves. Significantly, we obtain glint-like\nphase variations even though we do not include specular reflection in our\nmodel. This false positive is the product of two generic properties: 1) for\nmodest obliquities, a planet's poles receive less orbit-averaged stellar flux\nthan its equator, so the poles are more likely to be covered in highly\nreflective snow and ice, and 2) we show that reflected light from a\nmodest-obliquity planet at crescent phases probes higher latitudes than at\ngibbous phases, therefore a planet's apparent albedo will naturally increase at\ncrescent phase. We suggest that this \"latitude-albedo effect\" will operate even\nfor large obliquities: in that case the equator receives less orbit-averaged\nflux than the poles, and the equator is preferentially sampled at crescent\nphase. Using rotational and orbital color variations to map the surfaces of\ndirectly imaged planets and estimate their obliquity will therefore be a\nnecessary pre-condition for properly interpreting their reflected phase\nvariations. The latitude-albedo effect is a particularly convincing glint false\npositive for zero-obliquity planets, and such worlds are not amenable to\nlatitudinal mapping. This effect severely limits the utility of specular\nreflection for detecting oceans on exoplanets. \n\n"}

Momentum\ntransfer is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation with a ray\ntracing algorithm that is adaptive in spatial and angular coordinates. We find\nthat momentum input partially affects star formation by increasing the\nturbulent support to a three-dimensional rms velocity equal to the circular\nvelocity of early haloes. Compared to a calculation that neglects radiation\npressure, the star formation rate is decreased by a factor of five to 1.8 x\n10^{-2} Msun/yr in a dwarf galaxy with a dark matter and stellar mass of 2.0 x\n10^8 and 4.5 x 10^5 solar masses, respectively, when radiation pressure is\nincluded. Its mean metallicity of 10^{-2.1} Z_sun is consistent with the\nobserved dwarf galaxy luminosity-metallicity relation. However, what one may\nnaively expect from the calculation without radiation pressure, the central\nregion of the galaxy overcools and produces a compact, metal-rich stellar\npopulation with an average metallicity of 0.3 Z_sun, indicative of an incorrect\nphysical recipe. In addition to photo-heating in HII regions, radiation\npressure further drives dense gas from star forming regions, so supernovae\nfeedback occurs in a warmer and more diffuse medium, launching metal-rich\noutflows. Capturing this aspect and a temporal separation between the start of\nradiative and supernova feedback are numerically important in the modeling of\ngalaxies to avoid the \"overcooling problem\".

In the present paper we study the\nX-ray gas content of four low-mass elliptical galaxies using archival Chandra\nX-ray observations.

N-body methods are used to\ninvestigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions\nbetween cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs. Using\nthe now available knowledge of the cluster density at a given cluster age it is\ndemonstrated that in starburst clusters the central densities over the first\n5Myr are so high (initially > 10^5 Msun pc^{-3}) that hardly any discs with\nsolar system building potential would survive this phase. This makes a\nstarburst clusters an unlikely environment for the formation of our solar\nsystem. Instead it is highly probable that the solar system formed in a leaky\ncluster (often classified as OB association). It is demonstrated that an\nencounter determining the characteristic properties existing in our solar\nsystems most likely happened very early on (< 2Myr) in its formation history\nand that after 5Myr the likelihood of a solar-type star experiencing such an\nencounter in a leaky cluster is negligible even if it was still part of the\nbound remnant. This explains why the solar system could develop and maintain\nits high circularity later in its development. \n\n"}

Due to\ngeometrical projection, the observed sizes of quasars should therefore appear\nsmaller than those of radio galaxies.

This suggests that some traditional dense gas tracers\nof molecular clouds do not sample a homogeneous population of clumps, i.e.,\nthat the HCO+ brightness in particular is directly related to the heating and\ndisruption of cold gas by massive young stars, whereas the N2H+ better samples\ngas not yet affected by this process.

Thermonuclear\nSNe get progressively classified as Ia-CSM, IInS and IIn as fv decreases. The\ntransition between Ia-CSM and IInS occurs at fv~0.2-0.3. It shown that SNe\nIa-CSM are found at the magnitude range -19.5> M >-21.6, in good agreement with\nobservations, and that the faintest SN IIn that can hide a SN Ia has M = -20.1.\nThe sample of SNe Ia-CSM shows an association with 91T-like SNe Ia.

This result is achieved through a new method for\nmeasuring the product of the jet Lorentz factor and the intrinsic opening angle\nGamma*theta_j from measured apparent opening angles in flux density limited\nsamples of AGN jets. The Gamma*theta_j parameter is important for jet physics\nbecause it is related to the jet-frame sidewise expansion speed and causal\nconnection between the jet edges and its symmetry axis. Most importantly, the\nstandard model of jet production requires that the jet be causally connected\nwith its symmetry axis, implying that Gamma*theta_j < 1. When we apply our\nmethod to the MOJAVE flux density limited sample of radio loud objects, we find\nGamma*theta_j = 0.2, implying that AGN jets are causally connected. We also\nfind evidence that AGN jets viewed very close to the line of sight effectively\nhave smaller intrinsic opening angles compared with jets viewed more off-axis,\nwhich is consistent with Doppler beaming and a fast inner spine/slow outer\nsheath velocity field. Notably, gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets have a typical\nGamma*theta_j that is two orders of magnitude higher, suggesting that different\nphysical mechanisms are at work in GRB jets compared to AGN jets.

Large deviations between the abundances of\nthe host star and its gas giants seem likely to occur if the planet formation\nfollows the core-accretion scenario. These deviations stem from the separate\nevolution of gas and dust in the disk, where the dust forms the planet cores,\nfollowed by the final run-away accretion of the left-over gas. ProDiMo\nprotoplanetary disk models are used to predict the chemical evolution of gas\nand ice in the midplane. We find that cosmic rays play a crucial role in slowly\nun-blocking the CO, where the liberated oxygen forms water, which then freezes\nout quickly. Therefore, the C/O ratio in the gas phase is found to gradually\nincrease with time, in a region bracketed by the water and CO ice-lines.

Furthermore, collisions of cosmic rays with the focal plane\nproduced transient signals in the data (glitches) with a wide range of\ncharacteristics.

In order to better understand the glitches\nobserved by HFI in flight, several ground-based experiments were conducted with\nflight-spare HFI bolometer modules. The experiments were conducted between 2010\nand 2013 with HFI test bolometers in different configurations using varying\nparticles and impact energies. The bolometer modules were exposed to 23 MeV\nprotons from the Orsay IPN TANDEM accelerator, and to $^{241}$Am and $^{244}$Cm\n$\\alpha$-particle and $^{55}$Fe radioactive X-ray sources. The calibration data\nfrom the HFI ground-based preflight tests were used to further characterize the\nglitches and compare glitch rates with statistical expectations under\nlaboratory conditions.

The tension between\nthe value of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, determined by Planck data plus WMAP\npolarisation (Planck+WP) and that determined by the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) can be alleviated by energy transfer from dark matter to vacuum\n($\\alpha>0$). A positive $\\alpha$ increases the allowed values of $H_0$ due to\nparameter degeneracy within the model using only CMB data. Combining with\nadditional datasets of including supernova type Ia (SN Ia) and baryon acoustic\noscillation (BAO), we can significantly tighten the bounds on $\\alpha$.\nRedshift-space distortions (RSD), which constrain the linear growth of\nstructure, provide the tightest constraints on vacuum interaction when combined\nwith Planck+WP, and prefer energy transfer from vacuum to dark matter\n($\\alpha<0$) which suppresses the growth of structure. Using the combined\ndatasets of Planck+WP+Union2.1+BAO+RSD, we obtain the constraint on $\\alpha$ to\nbe $-0.083<\\alpha<-0.006$ (95% C.L.), allowing low $H_0$ consistent with the\nmeasurement from 6dF Galaxy survey.

The study is\nbased on the analysis of hydrodynamically simulated galaxies from dwarf to\nMilky Way mass, drawn from the MaGICC project, which have been shown to match a\nwide range of disk scaling relationships. We find that the best fit parameters\nof a generic double power-law density profile vary in a systematic manner that\ndepends on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio of each galaxy. Thus, the quantity\nMstar/Mhalo constrains the inner ($\\gamma$) and outer ($\\beta$) slopes of dark\nmatter density, and the sharpness of transition between the slopes($\\alpha$),\nreducing the number of free parameters of the model to two.

Previously it has been shown\nthat conversion of this primordially-generated background of relativistic\nALPs---a cosmic ALP background (CAB)---can explain the observed soft X-ray\nexcess in both the centre and the outskirts of the Coma cluster. Here we extend\nthis work to the three clusters A665, A2199 and A2255. We use a stochastic\nmodel of the cluster magnetic field to numerically calculate ALP-photon\nconversion probabilities to predict the CAB-generated soft X-ray flux in these\nclusters. We compare this flux to ROSAT PSPC observations of the three\nclusters, and use these observations to constrain the CAB parameter space.

This assumption has been used extensively in the literature to\nassess the strength of the likely gravitational wave signal. There is now,\nhowever, a significant amount of theoretical and observation work that suggests\nthat this may not be the case, and that GW emission is unlikely to be setting\nthe spin equilibrium period in many systems. In this paper we take a different\nstarting point and predict the GW signal strength for two physical mechanisms\nthat are likely to be at work in LMXBs: crustal mountains due to thermal\nasymmetries and magnetically confined mountains. We find that thermal crustal\nmountains in transient LMXBs are unlikely to lead to detectable GW emission,\nwhile persistent systems are good candidates for detection by Advanced LIGO and\nby the Einstein Telescope. Detection prospects are pessimistic for the magnetic\nmountain case, unless the NS has a buried magnetic field of $B\\approx 10^{12}$\nG, well above the typically inferred exterior dipole fields of these objects.\nNevertheless, if a system were to be detected by a GW observatory, cyclotron\nresonant scattering features in the X-ray emission could be used to distinguish\nbetween the two different scenarios. \n\n"}

In this paper we discuss how a classification based on\ncanonical, non-parametric structural indices measured on resolved stellar mass\nmaps, rather than on single-band images, reduces the misclassification of\nclumpy but not merging galaxies. We calibrate the mass-based selection of\nmergers using the MIRAGE hydrodynamical numerical simulations of isolated and\nmerging galaxies which span a stellar mass range of\n$10^{9.8}$-$10^{10.6}M_{sun}$ and merger ratios between 1:1-1:6.3.

While the X-ray emission of ultra-long\nGRBs have been studied extensively in the past, no comprehensive radio dataset\nhas been obtained so far. We report here the early discovery of an unusual\nradio afterglow associated with the ultra-long GRB 130925A. The radio emission\npeaks at low-frequencies ($\\sim 7$ GHz) at early times, only $2.2$ days after\nthe burst occurred. More notably, the radio spectrum at frequencies above $10$\nGHz exhibits a rather steep cut-off, compared to other long GRB radio\nafterglows. This cut-off can be explained if the emitting electrons are either\nmono-energetic or originate from a rather steep, $dN/dE \\propto E^{-4}$,\npower-law energy distribution. An alternative electron acceleration mechanism\nmay be required to produce such an electron energy distribution. Furthermore,\nthe radio spectrum exhibits a secondary underlying and slowly varying\ncomponent. This may hint that the radio emission we observed is comprised of\nemission from both a reverse and a forward shock.

This\npaper presents a method for testing whether inferred structure in an image with\nPoisson noise represents a significant departure from a baseline (null) model\nof the image. To infer image structure, we conduct a Bayesian analysis of a\nfull model that uses a multiscale component to allow flexible departures from\nthe posited null model.

This choice of test statistic\nallows us to estimate a computationally efficient upper bound on a p-value that\nenables us to draw strong conclusions even when there are limited computational\nresources that can be devoted to simulations under the null model.

In the present paper we extend the investigation of the properties\nof the BEC dark matter to the galactic cluster scale, involving dark matter\ndominated astrophysical systems formed of thousands of galaxies each. By\nconsidering that one of the major components of a galactic cluster, the\nintra-cluster hot gas, is described by King's $\\beta$-model, and that both\nintra-cluster gas and dark matter are in hydrostatic equilibrium, bound by the\nsame total mass profile, we derive the mass and density profiles of the BEC\ndark matter.

It has been suggested that the origin of\nthis relation is related to the chemical evolution of the Galactic disk, but\nother processes, associated with the presence of planets around stars, might\nalso be involved.\n  Aims: We analyse HIRES spectra of 14 solar twins and the Sun to provide new\ninsights on the mechanisms that can determine the relation between [X/H] and\nTc.\n  Methods: Our spectroscopic analysis produced stellar parameters (Teff, log g,\n[Fe/H], and $\\xi$), ages, masses, and abundances of 22 elements (C, O, Na, Mg,\nAl, Si, S, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, and Ba).

The transition from a thin disk to an ADAF occurs when\nthe mass accretion rate is below a critical value. The critical mass accretion\nrate for the ADAF can be estimated by equating the equilibration timescale to\naccretion timescale of the ADAF, which is sensitive to its radial velocity. The\nradial velocity of thin disks is very small, which leads to the advection of\nthe external field in thin disks very inefficient. ADAFs are present in the\nlow/hard states of XRBs, and their radial velocity is large compared with the\nthin disk. The external field can be dragged inward efficiently by the ADAF, so\na strong large-scale magnetic field threading the ADAF can be formed, which may\naccelerate a fraction of gas in the ADAF into the outflows. Such outflows may\ncarry away a large amount of angular momentum from the ADAF, which increases\nthe radial velocity of the ADAF significantly. This leads to a high critical\nmass accretion rate, below which an ADAF with magnetic outflows can survive.\nOur calculations show that the critical luminosity of the ADAF with magnetic\noutflows can be one order of magnitude higher than that for a conventional\nADAF, if the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure $\\beta\\sim 4$ in the disk.

The inclusion of the cross-helicity effect makes\nthe present model different from the current $\\alpha$--$\\Omega$-type models\nmainly in two points. First, in addition to the usual $\\alpha$ (helicity\neffect) and $\\beta$ (turbulent magnetic diffusivity), we consider the $\\gamma$\ncoefficient (cross-helicity effect) as a key ingredient of the dynamo process.\nSecond, unlike the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ coefficients, which are often treated\nas an adjustable parameter in the current studies, the spatiotemporal evolution\nof $\\gamma$ coefficient is solved simultaneously with the mean magnetic-field\nequations. The basic scenario is as follows: In the presence of turbulent cross\nhelicity, the toroidal field is induced by the toroidal rotation in mediation\nby the turbulent cross helicity. The $\\alpha$ effect generates the poloidal\nfield from the toroidal one. This poloidal field produces a turbulent cross\nhelicity whose sign is opposite to the original one. Then a cycle of reversal\ncompletes. Eigenvalue analyses of the simplest possible present model give a\nbutterfly diagram, which confirms the above scenario as well as the\nequator-ward migrations, the phase relationship between the cross helicity and\nmagnetic fields, etc. These results suggest that the oscillation of the\nturbulent cross helicity is a key for the activity cycle. The reversal of the\nturbulent cross helicity is not the result of the magnetic-field reversal, but\nthe cause of the latter.

Polarimetric observations of Bok globules frequently show a decrease\nin the degree of polarization towards their central dense regions (polarization\nholes). This behaviour is usually explained with increased disalignment owing\nto high density and temperature, or insufficient angular resolution of a\npossibly complex magnetic field structure.\n  Aims. We investigate whether a significant decrease in polarized emission of\ndense regions in Bok globules is possible under certain physical conditions.\nFor instance, we evaluate the impact of optical depth effects and various\nproperties of the dust phase.\n  Methods. We use radiative transfer modelling to calculate the temperature\nstructure of an analytical Bok globule model and simulate the polarized thermal\nemission of elongated dust grains. For the alignment of the dust grains, we\nconsider a magnetic field and include radiative torque and internal alignment.\n  Results. Besides the usual explanations, selected conditions of the\ntemperature and density distribution, the dust phase and the magnetic field are\nalso able to significantly decrease the polarized emission of dense regions in\nBok globules.

Long-period stars with dominant radial fundamental mode Abstract: We present the discovery of a new, peculiar form of double-periodic pulsation\nin RR Lyrae stars. In four, long-period ($P>0.6$ d) stars observed by the\nOptical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, and classified as fundamental mode\npulsators (RRab), we detect additional, low-amplitude variability, with period\nshorter than fundamental mode period. The period ratios fall in a range similar\nto double-mode fundamental and first overtone RR Lyrae stars (RRd), with the\nexception of one star, in which the period ratio is significantly lower and\nnearly exactly equals 0.7. Although period ratios are fairly different for the\nfour stars, the light curve shapes corresponding to the dominant, fundamental\nmode are very similar. The peak-to-peak amplitudes and amplitude ratios\n(Fourier parameters $R_{21}$ and $R_{31}$) are among the highest observed in\nRRab stars of similar period, while Fourier phases ($\\varphi_{21}$ and\n$\\varphi_{31}$) are among the lowest observed in RRab stars.\n  If the additional variability is interpreted as due to radial first overtone,\nthen, the four stars are the most extreme RRd variables of the longest\npulsation periods known. Indeed, the observed period ratios can be well\nmodelled with high metallicity pulsation models. However, at such long\npulsation periods, first overtone is typically damped.\n  Five other candidates, with weak signature of additional variability, sharing\nthe same characteristics, were also detected and are briefly discussed. \n\n"}

Here we present observations\nof a luminous blue variable (LBV) in NGC 2770 in outburst over more than 20\nyears that experienced a possible terminal explosion as type IIn SN in 2015,\nnamed SN 2015bh.

All emission lines show a single\nnarrow P-Cygni profile during the LBV phase and a double P-Cygni profile post\nmaximum suggesting an association of this second component with the possible\nSN. Since 1994 the star has been redder than during a typical S-Dor like\noutburst.

Motivated\nby the recent release of unprecedentedly deep and wide imaging data around the\nPal~5 stellar stream, we develop a new probabilistic, adaptive and\nnon-parametric technique which allows us to bring the cluster's tidal tails\ninto clear focus. Strikingly, we uncover a stream whose density exhibits\nvisible changes on a variety of angular scales. We detect significant bumps and\ndips, both narrow and broad: two peaks on either side of the progenitor, each\nonly a fraction of a degree across, and two gaps, $\\sim2^{\\circ}$ and\n$\\sim9^{\\circ}$ wide, the latter accompanied by a gargantuan lump of debris.\nThis largest density feature results in a pronounced inter-tail asymmetry which\ncannot be made consistent with an unperturbed stream according to a suite of\nsimulations we have produced.

We first show, by\nmeans of pure N-body simulations, that initially co-spatial stellar populations\nwith different in-plane random motions separate when a bar forms. The radially\ncooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and\npeanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a\nvertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,\nvelocity dispersion that dominates this evolution. Assuming that early stellar\ndiscs heat rapidly as they form, then both the in-plane and vertical random\nmotions correlate with stellar age and chemistry, leading to different density\ndistributions for metal-rich and metal-poor stars. We then use a\nhigh-resolution simulation, in which all stars form out of gas, to demonstrate\nthat this is what happens. When we apply these results to the Milky Way we show\nthat a very broad range of observed trends for ages, densities, kinematics and\nchemistries, that have been presented as evidence for contradictory paths to\nthe formation of the bulge, are in fact consistent with a bulge which formed\nfrom a continuum of disc stellar populations which were kinematically separated\nby the bar.

Polarization Abstract: Polarimetric observations of T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars are a powerful\nway to image protoplanetary disks. However, interpretation of these images is\ndifficult because the degree of polarization is highly sensitive to the angle\nof scattering of stellar light off the disk surface. We examine how disks with\nand without gaps created by planets appear in scattered polarized light as a\nfunction of inclination angle. Isophotes of inclined disks without gaps are\ndistorted in polarized light, giving the appearance that the disks are more\neccentric or more highly inclined than they truly are. Apparent gap locations\nare unaffected by polarization, but the gap contrast changes. In face-on disks\nwith gaps, we find that the brightened far edge of the gap scatters less\npolarized light than the rest of the disk, resulting in slightly decreased\ncontrast between the gap trough and the brightened far edge. In inclined disks,\ngaps can take on the appearance of being localized \"holes\" in brightness rather\nthan full axisymmetric structures.

We calculate the\nrate and analyze the consequences of three classes of collisions, those\noccurring between a dilute axion star and: another dilute axion star, an\nordinary star, or a neutron star. In all cases we attempt to quantify the most\nimportant astrophysical uncertainties; we also pay particular attention to\nscenarios in which collisions lead to collapse of otherwise stable axion stars,\nand possible subsequent decay through number changing interactions. Collisions\nbetween two axion stars can occur with a high total rate, but the low relative\nvelocity required for collapse to occur leads to a very low total rate of\ncollapses. On the other hand, collisions between an axion star and an ordinary\nstar have a large rate, $\\Gamma_\\odot \\sim 3000$ collisions/year/galaxy, and\nfor sufficiently heavy axion stars, it is plausible that most or all such\ncollisions lead to collapse.

We\nperform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core\ncluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via\ncollimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via\nstreaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming\ninstability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient\nneeded for AGN feedback to self-regulate, at least within the context of the\nphysical model considered here. When CR streaming is neglected, the suppression\nof CR mixing with the ICM by magnetic fields significantly reduces ICM heating,\nwhich leads to cooling catastrophes. In the opposite case, CRs come into\ncontact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, which results in globally\nstable atmospheres. Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the\ncentral AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present. We find that\nCR streaming heating dominates over the heating due to Coulomb and hadronic\nprocesses. Importantly, in simulations that include CR streaming, CR pressure\nsupport in the central 100 kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate\nobservational constraints.

While PE heating alone can suppress star formation slightly\nmore (a factor of a few) than SNe alone can do, it is unable to drive outflows\nand reproduce the multi-phase ISM that emerges naturally when SNe are included.\nThese results are in conflict with recent results of Forbes et al. who\nconcluded that PE heating is the dominant process suppressing star formation in\ndwarfs, about an order of magnitude more efficient than SNe.

However, several secondary effects\nin the low redshift universe will produce \\textit{non-primordial} B-modes.

At scales above the ion Larmor radius,\nthe theory reduces to the pressure-anisotropic generalization of kinetic\nreduced magnetohydrodynamics (KRMHD) formulated by Kunz et al. (2015). At\nscales at and below the ion Larmor radius, three main objectives are achieved.\nFirst, we analyse the linear response of the pressure-anisotropic gyrokinetic\nsystem, and show it to be a generalisation of previously explored limits. The\neffects of pressure anisotropy on the stability and collisionless damping of\nAlfvenic and compressive fluctuations are highlighted, with attention paid to\nthe spectral location and width of the frequency jump that occurs as Alfven\nwaves transition into kinetic Alfven waves. Secondly, we derive and discuss a\ngeneral free-energy conservation law, which captures both the KRMHD free-energy\nconservation at long wavelengths and dual cascades of kinetic Alfven waves and\nion entropy at sub-ion-Larmor scales. We show that non-Maxwellian features in\nthe distribution function change the amount of phase mixing and the efficiency\nof magnetic stresses, and thus influence the partitioning of free energy\namongst the cascade channels.

In the early Universe, the first stellar clusters were\nparticularly dense, as fragmentation typically only occurred at densities above\n$10^9$cm$^{-3}$, and the radii of the protostars were enhanced due to the\nlarger accretion rates, suggesting a potentially more relevant role of stellar\ncollisions.

The\nself-similarity of the temperature profiles and tight mass--temperature\nrelation of relaxed cool-core clusters suggest that the maximum effect of\nsedimentation take place in the most massive virialized objects in the\nUniverse. However, Chandra and XMM-Newton observations demonstrate more complex\nscaling relations between the masses of early-type galaxies and other\nparameters, such as the ISM temperature and gas mass fraction. An important\nfact is that early-type galaxies can show both decreasing and increasing radial\ntemperature profiles. We have calculated the diffusion based on the observed\ngas density and temperature distributions for 13 early-type galaxies that\nbelonging to the different environments and cover a wide range of X-ray\nluminosities.

Here we analytically\nand numerically investigate vertical tracer transport in a 3D stratified\natmosphere and predict $K_{zz}$ as a function of the large-scale circulation\nstrength, horizontal mixing due to eddies and waves and local tracer sources\nand sinks. We find that $K_{zz}$ increases with tracer chemical lifetime and\ncirculation strength but decreases with horizontal eddy mixing efficiency. We\ndemarcated three $K_{zz}$ regimes in planetary atmospheres. In the first regime\nwhere the tracer lifetime is short compared with the transport timescale and\nhorizontal tracer distribution under chemical equilibrium ($\\chi_0$) is\nuniformly distributed across the globe, global-mean vertical tracer mixing\nbehaves diffusively.

In this work, we highlight a more severe, previously\nunrecognized shortcoming of ES models: the large-scale 21 cm power spectrum\n(equivalently, HI bias b_HI) is a relatively strong function of the spatial\nresolution used to generate ES ionization maps. We trace this problem to the\nfact that photon non-conservation in these models arises from a\nresolution-dependent mixture of spatially resolved, photon non-conserving\nbubbles, and partially ionized grid cells which are perfectly photon-conserving\nby construction. We argue that this inevitably leads to a resolution-dependence\nof b_HI, with the correct, converged value only emerging at very coarse\nresolution. Quantitatively, we find that b_HI can be non-converged by as much\nas ~20-25% in conservative ES implementations with grid sizes Delta x=5-10\ncMpc/h, even when photon non-conservation is as small as ~3-4%.

Fossil clues Abstract: Early-type retired galaxies (RGs, i.e. galaxies which no longer form stars)\ncan be divided into two classes: those with no emission lines, here dubbed\nlineless RGs, and those with emission lines, dubbed liny RGs. Both types of\ngalaxies contain hot low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES) which emit ionizing\nphotons. The difference must thus lie in the presence or absence of a reservoir\nof ionizable gas. From a volume-limited sample of 38\\,038 elliptical galaxies,\nwe explore differences in physical properties between liny and lineless using\ndata from the SDSS, WISE and GALEX catalogues. To avoid biases in the\ncomparison, we pair-match liny and lineless in stellar-mass, redshift and\nhalf-light Petrosian radius. We detect marginal differences in their optical\nstellar ages and NUV luminosities, indicating that liny RGs have an excess of\nintermediate-age (0.1--5 Gyr) stellar populations. Liny RGs show higher dust\nattenuation and $W3$ luminosities than their lineless counterparts. We also\nfind that the amount of warm gas needed to explain the observed \\Ha luminosity\nin liny RGs is $10^5$--$10^8$\\msun, and that their \\nii/\\oii emission-line\nratios are typical of those of the most massive star-forming galaxies. Taken\ntogether, these results rules out the following sources for the warm gas in\nliny RGs: mass-loss from intermediate-mass stars, mergers with metal-poor\ngalaxies and intergalactic streams. They imply instead an inflow of enriched\ngas previously expelled from the galaxy or a merger with a metal-rich galaxy.\nThe ionization source and the origin of the gas producing the emission lines\nare thus disconnected. \n\n"}

Although there is no\nuniversal threshold for primordial black hole formation, the averaged mass\nexcess of the perturbation depends on the amplitude of the energy density peak,\nand it is possible to formulate a well-defined criterion to establish when a\ncosmological perturbation is able to form a black hole in terms of one of these\ntwo key quantities.

Relative\nmagnetic helicity can be decomposed uniquely into two gauge invariant\nquantities, the magnetic helicity of the non-potential component of the field,\nand a complementary volume-threading helicity. Recent analysis of numerical\nexperiments simulating the generation of solar eruptions have shown that the\nratio of the non-potential helicity to the total relative helicity is a clear\nmarker of the eruptivity of the magnetic system, and that the high value of\nthat quantity could be a sufficient condition for the onset of the instability\ngenerating the eruptions. The present study introduces the first analytical\nexamination of the time variations of these non-potential and volume-threading\nhelicities. The validity of the analytical formulas derived are confirmed with\nanalysis of three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of\nsolar coronal dynamics.

We identify, on the basis of the spectral analysis of\nc-C3H2 across the field of view, 15 main velocity components along the line of\nsight to SgrB2(N) and several components in the envelope of SgrB2. The c-C3H2\ncolumn densities reveal two categories of clouds. Clouds in Category I (3 kpc\narm, 4 kpc arm, and some GC clouds) have smaller c-C3H2 column densities,\nsmaller linewidths, and smaller widths of their column density PDFs than clouds\nin Category II (Scutum arm, Sgr arm, and other GC clouds). To investigate the\nspatial structure we derive opacity maps for the following molecules: c-C3H2,\nH13CO+, 13CO, HNC, HN13C, HC15N, CS, C34S, 13CS, SiO, SO, and CH3OH. These maps\nreveal that most molecules trace relatively homogeneous structures that are\nmore extended than the field of view defined by the background continuum\nemission (about 15\", that is 0.08-0.6pc depending on the distance). SO and SiO\nshow more complex structures with smaller clumps of size ~5-8\". Our analysis\nsuggests that the driving of the turbulence is mainly solenoidal in the\ninvestigated clouds. On the basis of HCO+, we conclude that most line-of-sight\nclouds towards SgrB2 are translucent, including all clouds where complex\norganic molecules were recently detected.

Even low-level\ncorrelations in the intrinsic shapes of galaxies could however produce a\nsignificant spurious lensing signal. These correlations are also interesting in\ntheir own right, since their detection would constrain models of galaxy\nformation. Using $3\\times 10^{4} - 10^5$ halos found in N-body simulations, we\ncompute the correlation functions of the intrinsic ellipticity of spiral\ngalaxies assuming that the disk is perpendicular to the angular momentum of the\ndark matter halo. We also consider a simple model for elliptical galaxies, in\nwhich the shape of the dark matter halo is assumed to be the same as that of\nthe light. For deep lensing surveys with median redshifts $\\sim 1$, we find\nthat intrinsic correlations of $\\sim 10^{-4}$ on angular scales $\\theta \\sim\n0.1-10'$ are generally below the expected lensing signal, and contribute only a\nsmall fraction of the excess signals reported on these scales.

Our evolutionary scheme considers a bimodal star formation (SF),\nincluding long-lived quiescent SF, and enhanced SF taking place during\ntransient events recurrently triggered by interactions and merging. We\ninterpret the strong observed evolution as an increase with z of the rate of\ninteractions between galaxies (density evolution) and an increase of their IR\nluminosity due to the more abundant fuel available in the past (luminosity\nevolution).

The conversion efficiency of\nAGN mechanical power into gas heating is uncertain, but we argue that it can be\nhigh even in the absence of strong shocks.

We consider a toy model in which the accretion rate\nonto a black hole is set by the classic Bondi formula.

Our study is based on near-IR\n(H-band: lambda = 1.65 micron) observations, for the first time comprising\nearly- and late-type systems. Our data confirm that the mean effective\ndynamical mass-to-light ratio M/L of the E+S0+S0a galaxies increases with\nincreasing effective dynamical mass M, as expected from the existence of the\nFundamental Plane relation. Conversely, spiral and Im/BCD galaxies show a broad\ndistribution in M/L with no detected trend of M/L with M, the former galaxies\nhaving M/L values about twice larger than the latter, on average. For all the\nlate-type galaxies, the M/L increases with decreasing effective surface\nintensity Ie, consistent with the existence of the Tully--Fisher relation.\nThese results are discussed on the basis of the assumptions behind the\nconstruction of the k-space and their limitations.

We perform axisymmetric hydrodynamical calculations of light,\nsupersonic, back-to-back jets propagating in a beta-model galaxy/cluster\natmosphere. We then shut down the jet activity and let the resulting structure\nevolve passively. The dead source undergoes an initial phase of pressure driven\nexpansion until it achieves pressure equilibrium with its surroundings.\nThereafter, buoyancy forces drive the evolution and lead to the formation of\ntwo oppositely directed plumes that float high into the galaxy/cluster\natmosphere. These plumes entrain a significant amount of low entropy material\nfrom the galaxy/cluster core and lift it high into the atmosphere.

The lack of detectable J and K emission from the blobs, along with strong\nH-alpha emission, indicates that an evolved stellar population is not likely to\nbe present. The brightest knot (closest to A194S) shows a star formation rate\nof ~1.2 solar masses per year which, if sustained over a time ~ 7 10^7 yr,\ncould explain the spectral energy distribution. This suggests that the stripped\nmatter was originally predominantly gaseous. The brightest knot is detected as\na FIRST radio source and this is likely the signature of supernova remnants\nrelated to enhanced star formation.

Such shocks conserve flow temperature by the\ndissipation of energy at the shock location.Unlike previous works in this\nfield, our calculation is {\\it not} restricted to any particular kind of\npost-Newtonian gravitational potentials, rather we use {\\it all} available\npseudo-Schwarzschild potentials to formulate and solve the equations governing\nthe accretion and wind only in terms of flow temperature $T$ and specific\nangular momentum $\\lambda$ of the flow.

We thus arrive at the\nconclusion that the standing shocks are essential ingredients in rotating,\nadvective accretion flows of isothermal fluid around a non-spinning\nastrophysical black hole.

The low\nobserved rate of cluster SNe Ia at z ~ 0 - 1 means that, if SNe Ia produced the\nobserved amount of iron, they must have exploded at even higher z.

This\npersistent transverse deceleration breaks the time-reversal symmetry in the\ntransit lightcurve of a spherical planet in a circular orbit around a perfectly\nsymmetric star. For `hot Jupiter' systems, ingress advances at a higher rate\nthan egress by a fraction of 10^{-4}-10^{-3}. Forthcoming space telescopes such\nas Kepler or COROT will reach the sensitivity required to detect this\nasymmetry. The scaling of the fractional asymmetry with stellar mass M and\nplanetary orbital radius R as M/R^2 is different from the scaling of the\norbital period as (M/R^3)^{-1/2}.

If the albedos are as low as\nthat of comets, the large inferred masses induce significant variations in the\nepicyclic eccentricities and/or periapse longitudes on the 400-500-day\ntimescales, due to the proximity of P2 and P1 to the 3:2 mean-motion\ncommensurability. In fact, for the maximum inferred masses, P2 and P1 may be in\nthe 3:2 mean-motion resonance, with the resonance variable involving the\nperiapse longitude of P1 librating. Observations that sample the orbits of P2\nand P1 well on the 400-500-day timescales should provide strong constraints on\nthe masses of P2 and P1 in the near future. \n\n"}

The variability is\ndominated by short timescales, ~10s, although a weak superhump also appears to\nbe present in the optical. The optical rapid variations, at least, are well\ncorrelated with those in X-rays. Infrared JHKs photometry, as in the previous\noutburst, exhibits especially large amplitude variability.

There is\nno compelling evidence for evolution in the slope over five nights, during\nwhich time the source brightness decayed along almost the same track as seen in\nvariations within the nights.

The gaseous CO2 emission covers a region about 35'' x\n25'' in extent, and results from radiative pumping by 15 micron continuum\nphotons emanating predominantly from the HW2 protostellar region. The gaseous\nCO2 exhibits a temperature distribution ranging from 50 K to 200 K. A\ncorrelation between the gas-phase CO2 distribution and that of H2 S(2), a\ntracer of shock activity, indicates that the CO2 molecules originate in a cool\npost-shock gas component associated with the outflow powered by HW2. The\npresence of CO2 ice absorption features at 15.20 micron toward this region and\nthe lack of correlation between the IR continuum emission and the CO2 gas\nemission distribution further suggest that the gaseous CO2 molecules are mainly\nsputtered off grain mantles -- by the passage of slow non-dissociative shocks\nwith velocities of 15-30 km/s -- rather than sublimated through grain heating. \n\n"}

Outside this core, nickel-56 dominates the supernova\nejecta. The outer extent of the iron-group material depends on the amount of\nnickel-56 and coincides with the inner extent of silicon, the principal product\nof incomplete burning. The outer extent of the bulk of silicon is similar in\nall SNe, having an expansion velocity of ~11000 km/s and corresponding to a\nmass of slightly over one solar mass. This indicates that all the supernovae\nconsidered here burned similar masses, and suggests that their progenitors had\nthe same mass. Synthetic light curve parameters and three-dimensional explosion\nsimulations support this interpretation. A single explosion scenario, possibly\na delayed detonation, may thus explain most type Ia supernovae. \n\n"}

These observations are consistent\nwith NFW halo profiles, with the possible exception of a few LSBs where the\nrotation curves are better described by shallower central density profiles.\nConsistency with observational trends requires that halos have lower\ncharacteristic densities than expected in the standard biased cold dark matter\n(CDM) scenario, but roughly compatible with COBE-normalized, low-density, flat\nCDM universes. The data also imply that disk mass-to-light ratios increase\ngently with luminosity, and that the halo circular velocity, V_200, is not\ndirectly proportional to the disk rotation speed, V_rot. Slowly rotating disks\nare surrounded by halos of higher circular velocities, whereas faster rotators\n(V_rot > 150 km/s) are all surrounded by halos of similar mass, corresponding\nto V_200 ~ 200 km/s. We speculate that this is because the efficiency of\nassembly of baryons into galaxies is high in massive halos, leading to disks\ntoo massive to be stable in systems that exceed the ``critical'' V_200 ~ 200\nkm/s. This modeling also provides a natural explanation for the distribution of\nsizes and rotation speeds of disk galaxies. (Abridged.) \n\n"}

In our previous studies we discovered that, to the\nsecond-order perturbation, except for the gravitational wave contributions, the\nrelativistic equations coincide exactly with the previously known Newtonian\nones. Since the Newtonian second-order equations are fully nonlinear, any\nnonvanishing third and higher order terms in the relativistic analyses are\nsupposed to be pure relativistic corrections. In this work we derive such\ncorrection terms appearing in the third order. Continuing our success in the\nsecond-order perturbations we take the comoving gauge. We discover that the\nthird-order correction terms are of $\\phi_v$-order higher than the second-order\nterms where $\\phi_v$ is a gauge-invariant combination related to the\nthree-space curvature perturbation in the comoving gauge; compared with the\nNewtonian potential we have $\\delta \\Phi \\sim {3 \\over 5} \\phi_v$ to the linear\norder.

However, this conclusion becomes less obvious when\nconsidering models that either imply modifications to gravity at long range or\ngravitational sources localized to the outer Solar System, given the\nuncertainty in the orbital parameters of the outer planets. Following the\ngeneral assumption that the Pioneer spacecraft move geodesically in a\nspherically symmetric spacetime metric, we derive the metric disturbance that\nis needed in order to account for the Pioneer anomaly. We then analyze the\nresidual effects on the astronomical observables of the three outer planets\nthat would arise from this metric disturbance, given an arbitrary metric theory\nof gravity.

Our\nderivation yields the metrics for both the normal branch and the self-inflating\nbranch DGP braneworlds. They generalize the 4D gravitational shock waves in de\nSitter space, and so we compare them to the corresponding 4D General Relativity\nsolution and to the case when gravity resides only in the 5D bulk, and there\nare no brane-localized graviton kinetic terms. We write down the solutions in\nterms of two-variable hypergeometric functions and find that at short distances\nthe shock wave profiles look exactly the same as in 4D Minkowski space, thus\nrecovering the limit one expects if gravity is to be mediated by a metastable,\nbut long-lived, bulk resonance. The corrections far from the source differ from\nthe long distance corrections in 4D de Sitter space, coming in with odd powers\nof the distance. We discuss in detail the limiting case on the self-inflating\nbranch when gravity is modified exactly at de Sitter radius, and energy can be\nlost into the bulk by resonance-like processes. Finally, we consider Planckian\nscattering on the brane, and find that for a sufficiently small impact\nparameter it is approximated very closely by the usual 4D description. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0506039", "contents": "Title: On the stability of field-theoretical regularizations of negative\n  tension branes Abstract: Any attempt to regularize a negative tension brane through a bulk scalar\nrequires that this field is a ghost. One can try to improve in this aspect in a\nnumber of ways. For instance, it has been suggested to employ a field whose\nkinetic term is not sign definite, in the hope that the background may be\noverall stable. We show that this is not the case; the physical perturbations\n(gravity included) of the system do not extend across the zeros of the kinetic\nterm; hence, all the modes are entirely localized either where the kinetic term\nis positive, or where it is negative; this second type of modes are ghosts. We\nshow that this conclusion does not depend on the specific choice for the\nkinetic and potential functions for the bulk scalar. \n\n"}

Our key results are: (1) galaxies and large scale structure present in\none cycle are generated by the quantum fluctuations in the preceding cycle\nwithout interference from perturbations or structure generated in earlier\ncycles and without interfering with structure generated in later cycles; (2)\nthe ekpyrotic phase, an epoch of gentle contraction with equation of state\n$w\\gg 1$ preceding the hot big bang, makes the universe homogeneous, isotropic\nand flat within any given observer's horizon; and, (3) although the universe is\nuniform within each observer's horizon, the global structure of the cyclic\nuniverse is more complex, owing to the effects of superhorizon length\nperturbations, and cannot be described in a uniform Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\npicture. In particular, we show that the ekpyrotic phase is so effective in\nsmoothing, flattening and isotropizing the universe within the horizon that\nthis phase alone suffices to solve the horizon and flatness problems even\nwithout an extended period of dark energy domination (a kind of low energy\ninflation). Instead, the cyclic model rests on a genuinely novel,\nnon-inflationary mechanism (ekpyrotic contraction) for resolving the classic\ncosmological conundrums. \n\n"}

In order to get insight on conformal properties of\ngravitino we reformulate phenomenological supergravity in SU(2,2|1)-symmetric\nway. The Planck mass and F- and D-terms appear via the gauge-fixed value of a\nsuperfield that we call conformon. We find that in general the probability of\ngravitino production is not suppressed by the small gravitational coupling.\nThis may lead to a copious production of gravitinos after inflation. Efficiency\nof the new non-thermal mechanism of gravitino production is very sensitive to\nthe choice of the underlying theory.
