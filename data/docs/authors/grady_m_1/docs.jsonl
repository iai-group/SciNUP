The ideas\nfrom mathematics are resurgence theory, the trans-series framework, and\nBorel-Ecalle resummation. The ideas from QFT use continuity on R^1 x S^1_L,\ni.e, the absence of any phase transition as N \\to infinity, or rapid-crossovers\nfor finite-N, and the small-L weak coupling limit to render the semi-classical\nsector well-defined and calculable. We classify semi-classical configurations\nwith actions 1/N (kink-instantons), 2/N (bions and bi-kinks), in units where\nthe 2d instanton action is normalized to one. Perturbation theory possesses the\nIR-renormalon ambiguity that arises due to non-Borel summability of the\nlarge-orders perturbation series (of Gevrey-1 type), for which a microscopic\ncancellation mechanism was unknown. This divergence must be present because the\ncorresponding expansion is on a singular Stokes ray in the complexified\ncoupling constant plane, and the sum exhibits the Stokes phenomenon crossing\nthe ray. We show that there is also a non-perturbative ambiguity inherent to\ncertain neutral topological molecules (neutral bions and bion-anti-bions) in\nthe semiclassical expansion. We find a set of \"confluence equations\" that\nencode the exact cancellation of the two different type of ambiguities. We show\nthat a new notion of \"graded resurgence triangle\" is necessary to capture the\npath integral approach to resurgence, and that graded resurgence underlies a\npotentially rigorous definition of general QFTs. The mass gap and the Theta\nangle dependence of vacuum energy are calculated from first principles, and are\nin accord with large-N and lattice results. \n\n"}

We consider a very transparent example of an\nideal pion gas with quantum statistics, which can be viewed as a\nmulti-component gas of Boltzmann particles with different charges and masses.\nCumulants of net-electric charge fluctuations $\\chi_n^Q$ are calculated in a\nstatic and expanding medium with flow parameters adjusted to the experimental\ndata. We show that the transverse momentum cut, $p_{t_\\text{min}}\\leq p_t\\leq\np_{t_\\text{max}}$, weakens the effects of Bose statistics, i.e. contributions\nof effectively multi-charged states to higher order moments. Consequently, cuts\nin $p_t$ modify the experimentally measured cumulants and their ratios. We\ndiscuss the influence of kinematic cuts on the ratio of mean and variance of\nelectric charge fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas, in the light of recent\ndata of the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations.

One simply takes a Chiral SUSY Action,\ncoupled to Gauge and other Chiral Multiplets, and even SuperGravity, if\ndesired.

Since the original\nAction satisfies a Master Equation, this exchange guarantees that the new\nAction will satisfy the new Master Equation.

In the limit of $\\lambda\n\\rightarrow \\infty$, a strong constraint $\\tilde U_\\nu(x)=U_\\nu(x)$ is\nrealized, and the total fermionic determinant is real and non-negative. In the\nlimit of $\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$, this system goes to two separated ordinary\nQCD systems with the chemical potential of $\\mu$ and $-\\mu^*$. On a\nfinite-volume lattice, if one takes an enough large value of $\\lambda$, $\\tilde\nU_\\nu(x) \\simeq U_\\nu(x)$ is realized and there occurs a phase cancellation\napproximately between two fermionic determinants in $M$ and $\\bar M$, which is\nexpected to suppress the sign problem and to make the lattice calculation\npossible.

The linear algebra analysis is closely related to\namplitude relations, especially the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations for gluon\namplitudes and the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations between gluons and graviton\namplitudes. Projection techniques are known to reduce the computation of loop\namplitudes with spinning particles to scalar integrals.

In this\nwork, we estimate finite-volume effects for matrix elements of non-local\noperators, composed of two currents displaced in a spatial direction by a\ndistance $\\xi$. We find that the finite-volume corrections depend on the\ndetails of the matrix element. If the external state is the lightest degree of\nfreedom in the theory, e.g.~the pion in QCD, then the volume corrections scale\nas $ e^{-m_\\pi (L- \\xi)} $, where $m_\\pi$ is the mass of the light state. For\nheavier external states the usual $e^{- m_\\pi L}$ form is recovered, but with a\npolynomial prefactor of the form $L^m/|L - \\xi|^n$ that can lead to enhanced\nvolume effects. These observations are potentially relevant to a wide variety\nof observables being studied using lattice QCD, including parton distribution\nfunctions, double-beta-decay and Compton-scattering matrix elements, and\nlong-range weak matrix elements. \n\n"}

In the special case of four staggered fields (four flavors,\nnF=4), I show here that certain assumptions about analyticity and phase\nstructure imply the validity of this procedure for representing the rooting\ntrick in the chiral sector. I start from the observation that, when the four\nflavors are degenerate, the fourth root simply reduces nF=4 to nF=1. One can\nthen treat nondegenerate quark masses by expanding around the degenerate limit.\nWith additional assumptions on decoupling, the result can be extended to the\nmore interesting cases of nF=3, 2, or 1. A apparent paradox associated with the\none-flavor case is resolved. Coupled with some expected features of unrooted\nstaggered quarks in the continuum limit, in particular the restoration of taste\nsymmetry, schpt then implies that the fourth-root trick induces no problems\n(for example, a violation of unitarity that persists in the continuum limit) in\nthe lowest energy sector of staggered lattice QCD.
