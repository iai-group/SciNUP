Validation is crucial as industries and governments depend\nincreasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions. In\nthis article, we survey the model validation literature and propose to\nformulate validation as an iterative construction process that mimics the\nprocess occurring implicitly in the minds of scientists. We thus offer a formal\nrepresentation of the progressive build-up of trust in the model, and thereby\nreplace incapacitating claims on the impossibility of validating a given model\nby an adaptive process of constructive approximation. This approach is better\nadapted to the fuzzy, coarse-grained nature of validation. Our procedure\nfactors in the degree of redundancy versus novelty of the experiments used for\nvalidation as well as the degree to which the model predicts the observations.\nWe illustrate the new methodology first with the maturation of Quantum\nMechanics as the arguably best established physics theory and then with several\nconcrete examples drawn from some of our primary scientific interests: a\ncellular automaton model for earthquakes, an anomalous diffusion model for\nsolar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere, and a computational fluid\ndynamics code for the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability.

A vast array of\nscience will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST will\nhave unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is\ndriven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking\nan inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and\nmapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system sited at\nCerro Pach\\'{o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m\neffective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel\ncamera. The standard observing sequence will consist of pairs of 15-second\nexposures in a given field, with two such visits in each pointing in a given\nnight. With these repeats, the LSST system is capable of imaging about 10,000\nsquare degrees of sky in a single filter in three nights. The typical 5$\\sigma$\npoint-source depth in a single visit in $r$ will be $\\sim 24.5$ (AB). The\nproject is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations\nby 2022.

Systematics and uncertainties of the\n  mid-infrared spectral analysis methods Abstract: The spectral region around 10 micrometer, showing prominent dust emission\nbands, is commonly used to derive the chemical composition of protoplanetary\ndust. Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, but so\nfar, no comparative test has been performed to test their validity. We\ncalculated model spectra of disk models with different geometries and central\nsources, using a 2D radiative transfer code. These spectra were then fitted in\na blind test using four different spectral decomposition methods. We studied\nthe effect of disk structure (flared vs. flat), inclination angle, size of the\ninner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition. Our\nresults show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate\nsystematically from the real chemical composition. Out of the four tested\nspectral decomposition methods, our new two-layer temperature distribution\nmethod, differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show\nthe weakest systematic effects. The reason for the deviations of the results\ngiven by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e.g. single\naverage grain temperature or one component continuum). We also tested the\ninfluence of different noise levels on the results of the spectral\ndecomposition methods.

Our searches reveal only small regions of stable\nmotions in the phase space of three-planet, coplanar configurations. Most\nlikely, if the planetary masses are in 10-Jupiter-mass range, they may be\nstable only if the planets are involved in two- or three-body mean motion\nresonances (MMRs).

For 45\ntransiting systems, we compute a large grid of cooling/contraction paths\nforward in time, starting from a large phase space of initial semi-major axes\nand eccentricities. Given observational constraints at the current time for a\ngiven planet (semi-major axis, eccentricity, and system age) we find possible\nevolutionary paths that match these constraints, and compare the calculated\nradii to observations. We find that tidal evolution has two effects. First,\nplanets start their evolution at larger semi-major axis, allowing them to\ncontract more efficiently at earlier times. Second, tidal heating can\nsignificantly inflate the radius when the orbit is being circularized, but this\neffect on the radius is short-lived thereafter. Often circularization of the\norbit is proceeded by a long period while the semi-major axis slowly decreases.\nSome systems with previously unexplained large radii that we can reproduce with\nour coupled model are HAT-P-7, HAT-P-9, WASP-10, and XO-4. This increases the\nnumber of planets for which we can match the radius from 24 (of 45) to as many\nas 35 for our standard case, but for some of these systems we are required to\nbe viewing them at a special time around the era of current radius inflation.\nThis is a concern for the viability of tidal inflation as a general mechanism\nto explain most inflated radii. Also, large initial eccentricities would have\nto be common. We also investigate the evolution of models that have a floor on\nthe eccentricity, as may be due to a perturber.

In particular, the power of\nthe quadrupole moment of the CMB fluctuations is remarkably low, and the\nquadrupole and octopole moments are aligned mutually and with the geometry of\nthe Solar system. It has been suggested in the literature that microwave sky\npollution by an unidentified dust cloud in the vicinity of the Solar system may\nbe the cause for these anomalies. In this paper, we simulate the thermal\nemission by clouds of spherical homogeneous particles of several materials.\nSpectral constraints from the WMAP multi-wavelength data and earlier infrared\nobservations on the hypothetical dust cloud are used to determine the dust\ncloud's physical characteristics. In order for its emissivity to demonstrate a\nflat, CMB-like wavelength dependence over the WMAP wavelengths (3 through 14\nmm), and to be invisible in the infrared light, its particles must be\nmacroscopic.

To do so, we assume that they\nretain a nonzero eccentricity, possibly by dint of continuing interaction with\na third body. We calculate the amount of extra heating in the envelope that is\nthen required to fit the radius of each planet, and we explore how this\nadditional power depends on the planetary atmospheric opacity and on the mass\nof a heavy-element central core. There is a degeneracy between the core mass\n$M_{\\rm core}$ and the heating $\\dot{E}_{\\rm heating}$.

The combination of our new data with the\npublished 1.1 micron discovery image shows that the grains are blue scattering\nwith no strong color gradient as a function of radius, implying predominantly\nsub-micron sized grains. We investigate possible explanations that could\naccount for the observed swept back, asymmetric morphology. Previous work has\nsuggested that HD 61005 may be interacting with a cold, unusually dense\ninterstellar cloud. However, limits on the intervening interstellar gas column\ndensity from an optical spectrum of HD 61005 in the Na I D lines render this\npossibility unlikely. Instead, HD 61005 may be embedded in a more typical warm,\nlow-density cloud that introduces secular perturbations to dust grain orbits.\nThis mechanism can significantly distort the ensemble disk structure within a\ntypical cloud crossing time. For a counterintuitive relative flow\ndirection--parallel to the disk midplane--we find that the structures generated\nby these distortions can very roughly approximate the HD 61005 morphology.\nFuture observational studies constraining the direction of the relative\ninterstellar medium flow will thus provide an important constraint for future\nmodeling.

Several formation scenarios have\nbeen proposed, where most combine the canonical oligarchic picture of core\naccretion with type I migration (e.g. Terquem & Papaloizou 2007) and planetary\natmosphere physics (e.g. Alibert et al. 2006).

The planetary radius is evolved\nself-consistently with orbital parameters, under the influence of tidal torques\nand tidal dissipation in the interior of the planet. A general feature of this\nmodel, which we have previously demonstrated in the generic case, is that a\npossible transient inflation of the planetary radius can temporarily interrupt\nits standard monotonic shrinking and can lead to the inflated radii that we\nobserve. In particular, a bloated planet with even a circular orbit may still\nbe inflated due to an earlier episode of tidal heating.

Twin matter is\nhypothetical matter that might couple directly only to the second metric of the\ntheory. Considerations of cosmology in the BIMOND framework suggest that such\nTM might exist and copy matter in its attributes. Here I investigate the\nindirect interactions that BIMOND theories predict between nonrelativistic\nmasses of matter and TM. The most salient result is that in the deep-MOND\nregime of the matter-TM-symmetric theories, TM behaves as if it has a negative\ngravitational mass. To wit, interaction within each sector is attractive MOND\ngravity, but between matter and TM it is repulsive MOND gravity. In the\nhigh-acceleration regime, the interaction depends on a parameter, beta. For the\nfavored value beta=1, matter and TM do not interact in this regime; for beta<1\nthey attract; and for beta>1 they repel each other. Such interactions may have\nsubstantial ramifications for all aspects of structure formation, such as\nmatter distribution, peculiar velocities, and effects on the CMB. The repulsive\ninteractions probably lead to segregation of matter and TM structures, leading,\nin turn, to intermeshing of the respective cosmic webs, with high-density nodes\nof one sector residing in the voids of the other (possibly conducing to\nefficient evacuation of the voids). Weak lensing by TM seems the best way to\nconstrain its attributes. In the MOND regime a TM body acts on matter photons\nas a diverging lens. Strong lensing occurs in the high acceleration regime, and\nthus depends on the value of beta. For beta=1 no strong lensing effects of TM\nare expected.

We show that, as tidal interaction with the central\nstar leads to small eccentricities, the planets in this system could be\nundergoing resonant coupling even though the period ratios depart significantly\nfrom very precise commensurability. In a three planet system, this is indicated\nby the fact that resonant angles librate or are associated with long term\nchanges to the orbital elements. We propose that the planets in HD 40307 were\nin a strict Laplace resonance while they migrated through the disc. After\nentering the disc inner cavity, tidal interaction would cause the period ratios\nto increase from two but with the inner pair deviating less than the outer\npair, counter to what occurs in HD 40307. However, the relationship between\nthese pairs that occurs in HD 40307 might be produced if the resonance is\nimpulsively modified by an event like a close encounter shortly after the\nplanetary system decouples from the disc. We find this to be in principle\npossible for a small relative perturbation on the order of a few 1.d-3 but then\nwe find that evolution to the present system in a reasonable time is possible\nonly if the masses are significantly larger than the minimum masses and tidal\ndissipation is very effective.

It predicts that rocky planets larger\nthan 2.5 Earth masses will not develop inner cores because the\ntemperature-pressure slope of the iron solidus becomes flatter than that of the\ncore adiabat. Instead, iron \"snow\" will condense near or at the top of these\ncores, and the net transfer of latent heat upwards will suppress convection and\na dynamo. More massive planets can have anemic dynamos due to core cooling, but\nonly if they have mobile lids (plate tectonics). The lifetime of these dynamos\nis shorter with increasing planet mass but longer with higher surface\ntemperature. Massive Venus-like planets with stagnant lids and more viscous\nmantles will lack dynamos altogether. We identify two alternative sources of\nmagnetic fields on rocky planets: eddy currents induced in the hot or molten\nupper layers of planets on very short period orbits, and dynamos in the ionic\nconducting layers of \"ocean\" planets with ~10% mass in an upper mantle of water\n(ice). \n\n"}

In such configuration, the system loses the axisymmetry\npresented in the aligned case, requiring a fully 3D approach. We perform 3D\nnumerical MHD simulations of stellar winds and study the effects caused by\ndifferent model parameters.

We show that the magnetic field lines\npresent an oscillatory pattern and that by increasing the misalignment angle,\nthe wind velocity increases. Our wind models allow us to study the interaction\nof a magnetized wind with a magnetized extra-solar planet. Such interaction\ngives rise to reconnection, generating electrons that propagate along the\nplanet's magnetic field lines and produce electron cyclotron radiation at radio\nwavelengths.

Recently, it has been noticed that the thermodynamical\nstate of the disc can significantly influence the migration properties of\ngrowing protoplanets. However, the evolution of planetary eccentricity in\nradiative discs has not been considered yet. In this paper we study the\nevolution of planets on eccentric orbits that are embedded in a\nthree-dimensional viscous disc and analyse the disc's effect on the orbital\nevolution of the planet. We use the three-dimensional hydrodynamical code\nNIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity and implicit radiation transport in\nthe flux-limited diffusion approximation. The code uses the FARGO-algorithm to\nspeed up the simulations. First we measure the torque and power exerted on the\nplanet by the disc for fixed orbits, and then we let the planet start with\ninitial eccentricity and evolve it in the disc. For locally isothermal we\nconfirm previous results and find eccentricity damping and inward migration for\nplanetary cores. In the case of radiative discs, the planets experience an\ninward migration as long as its eccentricity lies above a certain threshold.\nAfter the damping of eccentricity cores with masses below 33 Earthmasses begin\nto migrate outward in radiative discs, while higher mass cores always migrate\ninward. For all planetary masses studied (up to 200 Earthmasses) we find\neccentricity damping.

Abstract: The standard model of planet formation considers an initial phase in which\nplanetesimals form from a dust disk, followed by a phase of mutual\nplanetesimal-planetesimal collisions, leading eventually to the formation of\nplanetary embryos. However, there is a potential transition phase (which we\ncall the \"snowball phase\"), between the formation of the first planetesimals\nand the onset of mutual collisions amongst them, which has often been either\nignored or underestimated in previous studies. In this snowball phase, isolated\nplanetesimals move on Keplerian orbits and grow solely via the direct accretion\nof sub-cm sized dust entrained with the gas in the protoplanetary disk. Using a\nsimplified model in which planetesimals are progressively produced from the\ndust, we consider the expected sizes to which the planetesimals can grow before\nmutual collisions commence and derive the dependence of this size on a number\nof critical parameters, including the degree of disk turbulence, the\nplanetesimal size at birth and the rate of planetesimal creation. For systems\nin which turbulence is weak and the planetesimals are created at a low rate and\nwith relatively small birth size, we show that the snowball growth phase can be\nvery important, allowing planetesimals to grow by a factor of 10^6 in mass\nbefore mutual collisions take over. In such cases, the snowball growth phase\ncan be the dominant mode to transfer mass from the dust to planetesimals.\nMoreover, such growth can take place within the typical lifetime of a\nprotoplanetary gas disk.

We model the interior of GJ 1214b assuming a two-layer (envelope+rock\ncore) structure where the envelope material is either H/He, pure water, or a\nmixture of H/He and H2O.

We discuss possible compositions that\nare consistent with Mp=6.55 ME, Rp=2.678 RE, an age tau=3-10 Gyr, and the\nirradiation level of the atmosphere.

Since a racemic mixture of chiral\nnucleotides frustrates the extension and replication of RNA and DNA,\nunderstanding the origin of homochirality has important implications to the\ninvestigation of the origin of life. Here we suggest a novel solution to the\nhomochirality problem based on a recently proposed thermodynamic dissipation\ntheory for the origin of life. Homochirality is suggested to have been\nincorporated gradually into the emerging life as a result of asymmetric right-\nover left-handed photon-induced denaturation of RNA/DNA occurring when Archean\nsea surface temperatures became close to the denaturing temperatures of\nRNA/DNA. This differential denaturing success would have been promoted by the\nsomewhat right-handed circularly polarized submarine light of the late\nafternoon when surface water temperatures are highest, and a negative circular\ndichroism band extending from 220 nm up to 260 nm for small segments of\nRNA/DNA.

Our preliminary modeling suggests that HR 8799b\nhas log(g) = 4--4.5, Teff = 900K, while HR 8799c, d, and (by inference) e have\nlog(g) = 4--4.5, Teff = 1000--1200K.

We have performed 2D numerical simulations using a\ngrid-based hydrodynamical code in which turbulence is modelled as stochastic\nforcing. We assume that the outermost planet is initially located just outside\nthe position of the 3:2 mean motion resonance (MMR) with the inner one and we\nstudy the dependance of the resonance stability with the amplitude of the\nstochastic forcing. For systems of two equal-mass planets we find that in disk\nmodels with an effective viscous stress parameter {\\alpha} 10^{-3}, damping\neffects due to type I migration can counteract the effects of diffusion of the\nresonant angles, in such a way that the 3:2 MMR can possibly remain stable over\nthe disk lifetime. For systems of super-Earths with mass ratio q=m_i/m_o < 1/2,\nwhere m_i (m_o) is the mass of the innermost (outermost) planet, the 3:2 MMR is\nbroken in turbulent disks with effective viscous stresses 2x10^{-4}< {\\alpha}<\n10^{-3} but the planets become locked in stronger p+1:p resonances, with p\nincreasing as the value for {\\alpha} increases.

Large values of eccentricity and inclination can be excited and\nstrong correlations settle in among the orbital angles. This dynamical\nbehaviour, in particular for bound dust grains, can potentially cause\nsignificant asymmetries in dusty disks around solar type stars which might be\ndetected by observations. However, the amount of orbital changes due to this\nnon--gravitational perturbation is strongly limited by the collisional lifetime\nof dust particles. We show that for large values of the disk's optical depth\nthe influence of ISM flow on the disk shape is almost negligible because the\ngrains are collisionally destroyed before they can accumulate enough orbital\nchanges due to the ISM perturbations. On the other hand, for values smaller\nthan $10^{-3}$, peculiar asymmetric patterns appear in the density profile of\nthe disk when we consider 1-10 mum grains, just above the blow-out threshold.\nThe extent and relevance of these asymmetries grow for lower values of the\noptical depth. An additional sink mechanism, which may prevent the formation of\nlarge clumps and warping in the disks is related to the fast inward migration\ndue to the drag component of the forces. When a significant eccentricity is\npumped up by the ISM perturbations, the drag forces (Poynting-Robertson and in\nparticular ISM drag) drive the disk particles on fast migrating tracks leading\nthem into the star on a short timescale.

It is thus\ninteresting to have an alternative method to constrain the value of the\nobliquity and to detect companions that might have disturbed the orbit of the\nplanet. We show how the long-term variations in the transit duration (TDV) can\nbe used to constrain the obliquity of the stellar rotation axis. We introduce a\nsimple theory to express the secular variations in the orbital elements and\ntheir effects on the TDVs with a general formulation valid for both oblique and\neccentric systems. Parameters or orbital elements that cannot be directly\nmeasured, such as the longitude of the ascending node of the orbit, are avoided\nthus allowing us a straightforward application. We compute the expected TDVs\nfor the presently known transiting systems, adopting their parameters found in\nthe literature. Considering the capabilities of the present or next generation\nspace-borne telescopes, we point out the systems that could be readily observed\nand discuss the constraints derivable on their fundamental parameters. TDVs can\nbe used to constrain the obliquity of the stars (and possibly of the planets in\nsystems younger than 10 -- 100 Myr), giving information about the formation\nscenarios, the strength of the tidal coupling, and the internal structure of\nboth the stars and the planets. Moreover, they can provide an indirect\nindication of the presence of other bodies, even with a mass comparable with\nthat of the Earth, because they give rise to additional contributions to the\nnodal precession. \n\n"}

Our technique exploits the fact the light curve derived stellar density\nmust be the same for all planets transiting a common star. Assuming a circular\norbit, the derived stellar density departs from the true value by a predictable\nfactor, Psi, which contains information on the eccentricity of the system. By\ncomparing multiple stellar densities, any differences must be due to\neccentricity and thus meaningful constraints can be placed in the absence of\nany other information.

Selected targets are fitted using a multimodal nested sampling\nalgorithm coupled with a planet-with-moon light curve modelling routine. By\ncomparing the Bayesian evidence of a planet-only model to that of a\nplanet-with-moon, the detection process is handled in a Bayesian framework. In\nthe case of null detections, upper limits derived from posteriors marginalised\nover the entire prior volume will be provided to inform the frequency of large\nmoons around viable planetary hosts, eta-moon. After discussing our\nmethodologies for target selection, modelling, fitting and vetting, we provide\ntwo example analyses. \n\n"}

These new discoveries will span the full range of significance\nlevels including planetary signals too small to be distinguished from the\nnoise.

The best fit projected separation is\ns=0.548+/- 0.005 Einstein radii. However, due to the s-->s^{-1} degeneracy,\nprojected separations of s^{-1} are only marginally disfavored at Delta\nchi^2=3. A Bayesian estimate of the host mass gives M_L = 0.43^{+0.27}_{-0.17}\nM_Sun, with a sharp upper limit of M_L < 1.2 M_Sun from upper limits on the\nlens flux. Hence, the planet mass is m_p=2.4^{+1.5}_{-0.9} M_Jup, and the\nphysical projected separation is either r_perp = ~1.0 AU or r_perp = ~3.4 AU.\nWe show that survey data alone predict this solution and are able to\ncharacterize the planet, but the Delta chi^2 is much smaller (Delta chi^2~500)\nthan with the followup data.

This is the fourth paper in a series showing the results of planet\npopulation synthesis calculations.\n  Aims. Our goal in this paper is to systematically study the effects of\nimportant disk properties, namely disk metallicity, mass and lifetime on\nfundamental planetary properties.\n  Methods. For a large number of protoplanetary disks we calculate a population\nof planets with our core accretion formation model including planet migration\nand disk evolution.\n  Results. We find a large number of correlations: Regarding the planetary\ninitial mass function, metallicity, disk mass and disk lifetime have different\nroles: For high [Fe/H], giant planets are more frequent. For high disk masses,\ngiant planets are more massive. For long disk lifetimes, giant planets are both\nmore frequent and massive. At low metallicities, very massive giant planets\ncannot form, but otherwise giant planet mass and metallicity are uncorrelated.\nIn contrast, planet masses and disk gas masses are correlated. The sweet spot\nfor giant planet formation is at 5 AU. In- and outside this distance, higher\nplanetesimals surface densities are necessary. Low metallicities can be\ncompensated by high disk masses, and vice versa, but not ad infinitum. At low\nmetallicities, giant planets only form outside the ice line, while at high\nmetallicities, giant planet formation occurs throughout the disk. The extent of\nmigration increases with disk mass and lifetime and usually decreases with\nmetallicity. No clear correlation of metallicity and the semimajor axis of\ngiant planets exists because in low [Fe/H] disks, planets start further out,\nbut migrate more, whereas for high [Fe/H] they start further in, but migrate\nless. Close-in low mass planets have a lower mean metallicity than Hot\nJupiters.\n  Conclusions. The properties of protoplanetary disks are decisive for the\nproperties of planets, and leave many imprints. \n\n"}

In particular, we examine the resonance\nrelations that occur, by varying the physical and initial orbital parameters of\nthe planets (mass, initial semi-major axis and eccentricity) as well as the\nparameters of the migration forces (migration rate and eccentricity damping\nrate), which are modeled here through a simplified analytic prescription. We\nfind that, in general, for planetary masses below 1.5 M_J, multiple-planet\nresonances of the form n3:n2:n1=1:2:4 and 1:3:6 are established, as the inner\nplanets, m1 and m2, get trapped in a 1:2 resonance and the outer planet m3\nsubsequently is captured in a 1:2 or 1:3 resonance with m2. For mild\neccentricity damping, the resonance pumps the eccentricities of all planets on\na relatively short time-scale, to the point where they enter an\ninclination-type resonance (as in Libert & Tsiganis 2011); then mutual\ninclinations can grow to ~35{\\deg}, thus forming a \"3-D system\". On the other\nhand, we find that trapping of m2 in a 2:3 resonance with m1 occurs very\nrarely, for the range of masses used here, so only two cases of capture in a\nrespective three-planet resonance were found. Our results suggest that trapping\nin a three-planet resonance can be common in exoplanetary systems, provided\nthat the planets are not very massive.

The\ngrand-averaged transit light curve shows that there is a ~1.5 mmag brightening\nshortly after the planet passes the mid-transit phase. Although the duration\nand amplitude of this brightening varies, it is visible even through the direct\ninspections of the individual transit events (some 40-60% of the followup light\ncurves show this phenomenon). We suggest that the most likely explanation of\nthis feature is the presence of a well-populated spot belt which is highly\ninclined to the orbital plane. This geometry is consistent with the inference\nfrom the spectroscopic anomalies.

Uniting all this observational data into one coherent picture to\nbetter understand planet formation is an important, but difficult undertaking.\nOur approach is to develop a model which can make testable predictions for all\nthese observational methods.

Socrates et al.

We observed a total of\n88 main-sequence stars, subgiants, and giants all highly probable members of\nM67, using four telescopes and instrument combinations.

Though secular\nperturbations from the binary can align the disk, in both cases the alignment\ntime at the distances at which the disk is resolved is greater than the stellar\nage, so we conclude that the coplanarity was primordial. Neither disk can be\nmodelled as a narrow ring, requiring extended radial distributions. To satisfy\nboth the Herschel and mid-IR images of the alpha CrB disk, we construct a model\nthat extends from 1-300AU, whose radial profile is broadly consistent with a\npicture where planetesimal collisions are excited by secular perturbations from\nthe binary.

In order to\ntrigger the accretion of gas, the core has to grow up to several Earth masses\nbefore the gas component of the protoplanetary disc dissipates. We compute the\nformation of planets, considering the oligarchic regime for the growth of the\nsolid core. Embryos growing in the disc stir their neighbour planetesimals,\nexciting their relative velocities, which makes accretion more difficult. We\ncompute the excitation state of planetesimals, as a result of stirring by\nforming planets, and gas-solid interactions. We find that the formation of\ngiant planets is favoured by the accretion of small planetesimals, as their\nrandom velocities are more easily damped by the gas drag of the nebula.\nMoreover, the capture radius of a protoplanet with a (tiny) envelope is also\nlarger for small planetesimals. However, planets migrate as a result of\ndisc-planet angular momentum exchange, with important consequences for their\nsurvival: due to the slow growth of a protoplanet in the oligarchic regime,\nrapid inward type I migration has important implications on intermediate mass\nplanets that have not started yet their runaway accretion phase of gas. Most of\nthese planets are lost in the central star. Surviving planets have either\nmasses below 10 ME or above several Jupiter masses.

Transit detection\ndepends not only on the planet's radius and orbital period, but also on host\nstar properties. Thus, a sample of stars with transiting planets may not\naccurately represent the target population. Moreover, targets are selected\nusing criteria such as a limiting apparent magnitude. These selection effects,\ncombined with uncertainties in stellar radius, lead to biases in the properties\nof transiting planets and their host stars. We quantify possible biases in the\nKepler survey. First, Eddington bias produced by a steep planet radius\ndistribution and uncertainties in stellar radius results in a 15-20%\noverestimate of planet occurrence. Second, the magnitude limit of the Kepler\ntarget catalog induces Malmquist bias towards large, more luminous stars and\nunderestimation of the radii of about one third of candidate planets,\nespecially those larger than Neptune. Third, because metal-poor stars are\nsmaller, stars with detected planets will be very slightly (<0.02 dex) more\nmetal-poor than the target average.

Terrestrial microlens parallax can\nbe measured whenever a microlensing event differs substantially as observed\nfrom two or more well-separated sites. If the lens also transits the source\nduring the event, then its mass can be measured. We derive an analytic\nexpression for the expected rate of such events and then use this to derive two\nimportant conclusions. First the rate is directly proportional to the number\ndensity of a given population, greatly favoring low-mass populations relative\nto their contribution to the general microlensing rate, which further scales as\nsqrt{M} where M is the lens mass. Second, the rate rises sharply as one probes\nsmaller source stars, despite the fact that the probability of transit falls\ndirectly with source size. We propose modifications to current observing\nstrategies that could yield a factor 100 increase in sensitivity to these rare\nevents. \n\n"}

The theory predicts the existence of a\nlong-range scalar field, which passes the Solar System observational\nconstraints, even if the scalar field is very light, and modifies the\ncosmological and galactic dynamics. Thus, the theory opens new possibilities to\napproach, in the same theoretical framework, the problems of both dark energy\nand dark matter. In this work, we consider the generalized virial theorem in\nthe scalar-tensor representation of the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity. More\nspecifically, taking into account the relativistic collisionless Boltzmann\nequation, we show that the supplementary geometric terms in the gravitational\nfield equations provide an effective contribution to the gravitational\npotential energy. We show that the total virial mass is proportional to the\neffective mass associated with the new terms generated by the effective scalar\nfield, and the baryonic mass. This shows that the geometric origin in the\ngeneralized virial theorem may account for the well-known virial theorem mass\ndiscrepancy in clusters of galaxies. In addition to this, we also consider\nastrophysical applications of the model and show that the model predicts that\nthe mass associated to the scalar field and its effects extend beyond the\nvirial radius of the clusters of galaxies. In the context of the galaxy cluster\nvelocity dispersion profiles predicted by the hybrid metric-Palatini model, the\ngeneralized virial theorem can be an efficient tool in observationally testing\nthe viability of this class of generalized gravity models. \n\n"}

But if disks are\nturbulent, this neglects a spectrum of stochastic density fluctuations that can\nproduce rare, high-density mass concentrations. Here, we use a\nrecently-developed analytic framework to predict the statistics of these\nfluctuations, i.e. the rate of fragmentation and mass spectrum of fragments\nformed in a turbulent Keplerian disk. Turbulent disks are never completely\nstable: we calculate the (always finite) probability of forming\nself-gravitating structures via stochastic turbulent density fluctuations in\nsuch disks. Modest sub-sonic turbulence above Mach number ~0.1 can produce a\nfew stochastic fragmentation or 'direct collapse' events over ~Myr timescales,\neven if Q>>1 and cooling is slow (t_cool>>t_orbit). In trans-sonic turbulence\nthis extends to Q~100. We derive the true Q-criterion needed to suppress such\nevents, which scales exponentially with Mach number. We specify to turbulence\ndriven by MRI, convection, or spiral waves, and derive equivalent criteria in\nterms of Q and the cooling time. Cooling times >~50*t_dyn may be required to\ncompletely suppress fragmentation. These gravoturbulent events produce mass\nspectra peaked near ~M_disk*(Q*M_disk/M_star)^2 (rocky-to-giant planet masses,\nincreasing with distance from the star).

Assuming\nan atmospheric helium mass abundance of 18%, we find maximum atmospheric\nmetallicities, Zatm of 7x solar for SCvH-i and Sesame-based models and a total\nmass of heavy elements, MZ of 25-30 ME. Some models are Jupiter-like. With\nLM-REOS, we find MZ=16-20 ME, less than for Jupiter, and Zatm less than 3x\nsolar. For Saturn, we compute moment of inertia values lambda=0.2355(5).\nFurthermore, we confirm that homogeneous evolution leads to cooling times of\nonly about 2.5 Gyr, independent on the applied EOS. Our results demonstrate the\nneed for accurately measured atmospheric helium and oxygen abundances, and of\nthe moment of inertia for a better understanding of Saturn's structure and\nevolution. \n\n"}

The challenge is to\nquantitatively determine the range of temperatures and species abundances\nallowed by the data. This challenge is often difficult given the low\ninformation content of most exoplanet spectra which commonly leads to\ndegeneracies in the interpretation. A variety of temperature and abundance\nretrieval approaches have been applied to exoplanet spectra, but no previous\ninvestigations have sought to compare these approaches. In this investigation\nwe compare three different retrieval methods: Optimal Estimation, Differential\nEvolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Bootstrap Monte Carlo.

{"id": "1306.5746", "contents": "Title: Luminosity of young Jupiters revisited. Massive cores make hot planets Abstract: The intrinsic luminosity of young Jupiters is of high interest for planet\nformation theory. It is an observable quantity that is determined by important\nphysical mechanisms during formation, namely the accretion shock structure, and\neven more fundamentally, the basic formation mechanism (core accretion or\ngravitational instability). We study the impact of the core mass on the\npost-formation entropy and luminosity of young giant planets forming via core\naccretion with a supercritical shock (cold accretion). For this, we conduct\nself-consistently coupled formation and evolution calculations of giant planets\nwith masses between 1 and 12 Jovian masses and core masses between 20 and 120\nEarth masses. We find that the post-formation luminosity of massive giant\nplanets is very sensitive to the core mass. An increase of the core mass by a\nfactor 6 results in an increase of the post-formation luminosity of a 10 Jovian\nmass planet by a factor 120. Due to this dependency, there is no single well\ndefined post-formation luminosity for core accretion, but a wide range. For\nmassive cores (~100 Earth masses), the post-formation luminosities of core\naccretion planets become so high that they approach those in the hot start\nscenario that is often associated with gravitational instability. For the\nmechanism to work, it is necessary that the solids are accreted before or\nduring gas runaway accretion, and that they sink deep into the planet. We make\nno claims whether or not such massive cores can actually form in giant planets.\nBut if yes, it becomes difficult to rule out core accretion as formation\nmechanism based solely on luminosity for directly imaged planets that are more\nluminous than predicted for low core masses. Instead of invoking gravitational\ninstability as the consequently necessary formation mode, the high luminosity\ncould also be caused simply by a more massive core. \n\n"}

For hot Jupiters the bow shock will not form\ndirectly between the planet and the star, causing an asymmetric distribution of\nmass around the exoplanet and hence an asymmetric transit. As the planet orbits\nthorough varying wind conditions, the strength and geometry of its bow shock\nwill change, thus producing transits of varying shape. We model this process\nusing magnetic maps of HD 189733 taken one year apart, coupled with a 3D\nstellar wind model, to determine the local stellar wind conditions throughout\nthe orbital path of the planet. We predict the time-varying geometry and\ndensity of the bow shock that forms around the magnetosphere of the planet and\nsimulate transit light curves. Depending on the nature of the stellar magnetic\nfield, and hence its wind, we find that both the transit duration and ingress\ntime can vary when compared to optical light curves. We conclude that\nconsecutive near-UV transit light curves may vary significantly and can\ntherefore provide an insight into the structure and evolution of the stellar\nwind. \n\n"}

The GJ 581 radiation environment\nwas studied with simultaneous X-ray and UV observations, performed with the XRT\nand UVOT instruments, respectively, on board of the SWIFT satellite. Methods.\nX-ray and UV data were analysed with the distributed standard tools. Results.\nGJ 581 was detected for the first time in the 0.2-10 keV range, with an\nintensity of (8+-2)x10^{-4} cts/s and a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.6.

Abstract: We report Gemini-North GMOS observations of the inflated hot Jupiter\nHAT-P-32b during two primary transits.

'White' light curves and 29 'spectral' light\ncurves were extracted for each transit and analysed to refine the system\nparameters and produce transmission spectra from 520-930nm in ~14nm bins. The\nlight curves contain time-varying white noise as well as time-correlated noise,\nand we used a Gaussian process model to fit this complex noise model. Common\nmode corrections derived from the white light curve fits were applied to the\nspectral light curves which significantly improved our precision, reaching\ntypical uncertainties in the transit depth of ~2x10^-4, corresponding to about\nhalf a pressure scale height. The low resolution transmission spectra are\nconsistent with a featureless model, and we can confidently rule out broad\nfeatures larger than about one scale height.

We have developed a photochemistry-thermochemistry\nkinetic-transport model for exploring the compositions of thick atmospheres on\nsuper Earths and mini Neptunes, applicable for both H2-dominated atmospheres\nand non-H2-dominated atmospheres. Using this model to study thick atmospheres\nfor wide ranges of temperatures and elemental abundances, we classify them into\nhydrogen-rich atmospheres, water-rich atmospheres, oxygen-rich atmospheres, and\nhydrocarbon-rich atmospheres. We find that carbon has to be in the form of CO2\nrather than CH4 or CO in a H2-depleted water-dominated thick atmosphere, and\nthat the preferred loss of light elements from an oxygen-poor carbon-rich\natmosphere leads to formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons (C2H2 and C2H4). We\napply our self-consistent atmosphere models to compute spectra and diagnostic\nfeatures for known transiting low-mass exoplanets GJ 1214 b, HD 97658 b, and 55\nCnc e. For GJ 1214 b like planets we find that (1) C2H2 features at 1.0 and 1.5\nmicron in transmission and C2H2 and C2H4 features at 9-14 micron in thermal\nemission are diagnostic for hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres; (2) a detection of\nwater-vapor features and a confirmation of nonexistence of methane features\nwould provide sufficient evidence for a water-dominated atmosphere.

{"id": "1401.1006", "contents": "Title: Habitable Zones with Stable Orbits for Planets around Binary Systems Abstract: A general formulation to compute habitable zones (HZ) around binary stars is\npresented. A HZ in this context must satisfy two separate conditions: a\nradiative one and one of dynamical stability. For the case of single stars, the\nusual concept of circumstellar habitable zone is based on the radiative\ncondition only, as the dynamical stability condition is taken for granted. For\nthe radiative condition, we extend the simple formulation of the circumstellar\nhabitable zone for single stars, to the case of eccentric stellar binary\nsystems, where two sources of luminosity at different orbital phases contribute\nto the irradiance of their planetary circumstellar and circumbinary regions.\nOur approach considers binaries with eccentric orbits and guarantees that\norbits in the computed habitable zone remain within it at all orbital phases.\nFor the dynamical stability condition, we use the approach of invariant loops\ndeveloped by Pichardo et al. 2005 to find regions of stable, non-intersecting\norbits, which is a robust method to find stable regions in binary stars, as it\nis based in the existence of integrals of motion. We apply the combined\ncriteria to calculate HZ for 64 binary stars in the solar neighborhood with\nknown orbital parameters, including some with discovered planets. Formulae and\ninterpolating tables are provided, so the reader can compute the boundaries of\nthe HZ for an arbitrary binary system, using the stellar flux limits they\nprefer. Together with the formulae provided for stable zones, these allow the\ncomputation of both regions of stability and habitability around any binary\nstellar system. We found 56% of the cases we consider can satisfy both\nrestrictions, this is a very important constriction to binary systems.\nNevertheless, we conclude that these systems where a dynamical and radiative\nsafe zone exists, must be considered strong candidates in the search for\nhabitable planets \n\n"}

Identification of 685 KOIs as False\n  Positives Via Ephemeris Matching Based On Q1-Q12 Data Abstract: The Kepler mission has to date found almost 6,000 planetary transit-like\nsignals, utilizing three years of data for over 170,000 stars at extremely high\nphotometric precision. Due to its design, contamination from eclipsing\nbinaries, variable stars, and other transiting planets results in a significant\nnumber of these signals being false positives. This directly affects the\ndetermination of the occurrence rate of Earth-like planets in our Galaxy, as\nwell as other planet population statistics. In order to detect as many of these\nfalse positives as possible, we perform ephemeris matching among all transiting\nplanet, eclipsing binary, and variable star sources. We find that 685 Kepler\nObjects of Interest - 12% of all those analyzed - are false positives as a\nresult of contamination, due to 409 unique parent sources. Of these, 118 have\nnot previously been identified by other methods. We estimate that ~35% of KOIs\nare false positives due to contamination, when performing a first-order\ncorrection for observational bias. Comparing single-planet candidate KOIs to\nmulti-planet candidate KOIs, we find an observed false positive fraction due to\ncontamination of 16% and 2.4% respectively, bolstering the existing evidence\nthat multi-planet KOIs are significantly less likely to be false positives. We\nalso analyze the parameter distributions of the ephemeris matches and derive a\nsimple model for the most common type of contamination in the Kepler field. We\nfind that the ephemeris matching technique is able to identify low\nsignal-to-noise false positives that are difficult to identify with other\nvetting techniques. We expect false positive KOIs to become more frequent when\nanalyzing more quarters of Kepler data, and note that many of them will not be\nable to be identified based on Kepler data alone. \n\n"}

Systems with 3-6 low-mass planets (or planet\ncandidates) produce a diversity of minimum-mass disks with surface density\nprofiles ranging from Sigma r^-3.2 to Sigma r^0.5 (5th-95th percentile). By\nsimulating the transit detection of populations of synthetic planetary systems\ndesigned to match the properties of observed super-Earth systems, we show that\na universal disk profile is statistically excluded at high confidence.

The accretion rates expected from\nplanetesimals that are all the same mass (ie, a mono-mass distribution) are\nexplored both analytically and using a Monte Carlo model, quantifying how\nmeasured accretion rates inevitably depend on sinking time, since different\nsinking times probe different times since the last accretion event. However,\nthat dependence is so dramatic that a mono-mass distribution can be excluded.\nConsideration of accretion from a broad distribution of planetesimal masses\nuncovers an important conceptual difference: accretion is continuous (rather\nthan stochastic) for planetesimals below a certain mass, and the accretion of\nsuch planetesimals determines the rate typically inferred from observations;\nsmaller planetesimals dominate the rates for shorter sinking times. A\nreasonable fit to the observationally inferred accretion rate distributions is\nfound with model parameters consistent with a collisionally evolved mass\ndistribution up to Pluto-mass, and an underlying accretion rate distribution\nconsistent with that expected from descendants of debris discs of main sequence\nA stars. With these parameters, while both DA and non-DA white dwarfs accrete\nfrom the same broad planetesimal distribution, this model predicts that the\npollution seen in DAs is dominated by the continuous accretion of <35km\nobjects, and that in non-DAs by >35km objects (though the dominant size varies\nbetween stars by around an order of magnitude from this value)... \n\n"}

These systems represent yet another new and unexpected class of\nplanetary systems and provide an opportunity to test the theories developed to\nexplain the properties of giant exoplanets. Presently, we have limited\nknowledge about such planetary systems, mostly about their sizes and orbital\nperiods. With the advent of long-term, nearly continuous monitoring by Kepler,\nthe method of transit timing variations (TTVs) has blossomed as a new technique\nfor characterizing the gravitational effects of mutual planetary perturbations\nfor hundreds of planets. TTVs can provide precise (but complex) constraints on\nplanetary masses, densities and orbits, even for planetary systems with faint\nhost stars. In the coming years, astronomers will translate TTV observations\ninto increasingly powerful constraints on the formation and orbital evolution\nof planetary systems with low-mass planets. Between TTVs, improved Doppler\nsurveys, high-contrast imaging campaigns and microlensing surveys, astronomers\ncan look forward to a much better understanding of planet formation in the\ncoming decade. \n\n"}

This paper describes the main scientific goals to be addressed by the\nfuture in situ exploration of Saturn placing the Galileo probe exploration of\nJupiter in a broader context and before the future probe exploration of the\nmore remote ice giants. In situ exploration of Saturn's atmosphere addresses\ntwo broad themes that are discussed throughout this paper: first, the formation\nhistory of our solar system and second, the processes at play in planetary\natmospheres. In this context, we detail the reasons why measurements of\nSaturn's bulk elemental and isotopic composition would place important\nconstraints on the volatile reservoirs in the protosolar nebula.

If the source of the viscosity is powered by\naccretion, such as in the case of the magneto-rotational instability, such\ndistant energy sources must lie in the innermost regions of the disk, where\naccretion occurs even at the midplane. We argue here that modulations in this\nenergy supply can alter the accretion rate on dynamical, rather than far longer\nviscous, time scales. This means that both the steady state value of and\nfluctuations in the inner disk's accretion rate, depending on the details of\nthe inner boundary condition and occurring on the inner disk's rapid evolution\ntime, can affect the outer disk. This is particularly interesting because\nobservations have shown that disk accretion is not steady (e.g.~EX Lupi type\nobjects).

We\ncompared it with the formulae used in the literature, and pointed out the\ndifferences. Using this result, we now present three case studies - Mercury,\nKepler-10b, and a triaxial Io. A very sharp frequency-dependence of k2/Q near\nspin-orbit resonances yields a similarly sharp dependence of k2/Q on the spin\nrate. This indicates that physical libration may play a major role in tidal\nheating of synchronously rotating bodies. The magnitude of libration in the\nspin rate being defined by the planet's triaxiality, the latter should be a\nfactor determining the dissipation rate. Other parameters equal, a\nsynchronously rotating body with a stronger triaxiality should generate more\nheat than a similar body of a more symmetrical shape. Further in the paper, we\ndiscuss scenarios where initially triaxial objects melt and lose their\ntriaxiality. Thereafter, dissipation in them becomes less intensive; so the\nbodies freeze. The tidal bulge becomes a new permanent figure, with a new\ntriaxiality lower than the original.

However, transit times in circumbinary systems are influenced both\nby the gravitational perturbations and the orbital phase variations of the\ncentral binary star. Adopting a coplanar analog of Kepler-16 as an example, we\nfind that circumbinary planets can transit the same star more than once during\na single planetary orbit, a phenomenon we call \"tight transits\". In certain\ngeometric, the projected orbital velocity of the planet and the secondary star\ncan approach zero and change sign, resulting in very long transits and/or 2-3\ntransits during a single binary orbit. Whether tight transits are possible for\na particular system depends primarily on the binary mass ratio and the orbital\narchitecture of both the binary and the planet. We derive a time-dependent\ncriterion to judge when tight transits are possible for any circumbinary\nsystem. These results are verified with full dynamical integrations that also\nreveal other tight transit characteristics, i.e., the transit durations and the\nintervals between tight transits. For the seven currently known circumbinary\nsystems, we estimate these critical parameters both analytically and\nnumerically. Due to the mutual inclination between the planet and the binary,\ntight transits can only occur across the less massive star B in Kepler-16, -34,\n-35, and -47 (for both planets). The long-term average frequency of tight\ntransits (compared to typical transits) for Kepler-16, -34, and -35 are\nestimated to be several percent. Using full numerical integrations, the next\ntight transit for each system is predicted and the soonest example appears to\nbe Kepler-47b and -47c, which are likely to have tight transits before 2025.\nThese unique and valuable events often deserve special observational scrutiny. \n\n"}

We re-observed CoRoT-7 in January 2012 with both HARPS and CoRoT, so\nthat we now have the benefit of simultaneous radial-velocity and photometric\ndata.

To account for\nactivity-related effects in the radial-velocities which do not have a\nphotometric signature, we also include an additional activity term in the\nradial-velocity model, which we treat as a Gaussian process with the same\ncovariance properties (and hence the same frequency structure) as the light\ncurve.

We present simulations of this process using a modified\nN-body code, starting from a swarm of planetary embryos. Systems of hot\nsuper-Earths form in resonant chains with the innermost planet at or interior\nto the disk inner edge. Resonant chains are disrupted by late dynamical\ninstabilities triggered by the dispersal of the gaseous disk.

Our\napproach is to use the full kinetics model to survey the parameter space with\neffective temperatures between 500 K and 1100 K. In all of these worlds\nequilibrium chemistry favors CH4 over CO in the parts of the atmosphere that\ncan be seen from Earth, but in most disequilibrium favors CO. The small surface\ngravity of a planet strongly discriminates against CH4 when compared to an\notherwise comparable brown dwarf. If vertical mixing is like Jupiter's, the\ntransition from methane to CO occurs at 500 K in a planet. Sluggish vertical\nmixing can raise this to 600 K; but clouds or more vigorous vertical mixing\ncould lower this to 400 K. The comparable thresholds in brown dwarfs are\n$1100\\pm100$ K.

We find that\nthis trend can be explained by a strong erosion-driven nongravitational\nacceleration normal to the orbit plane, confirmed for several test dwarf Kreutz\nsungrazers by orbital solutions with nongravitational terms incorporated\ndirectly in the equations of motion on a condition of fixed apsidal\norientation.

In previous work using the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope, we found evidence to support at least one sub-Earth-sized\nexoplanet orbiting the nearby mid-M dwarf star GJ 436. As a follow up, here we\nused the Hubble Space Telescope to investigate the existence of one of these\ncandidate planets, UCF-1.01, by searching for two transit signals as it passed\nin front of its host star. Interpretation of the data hinges critically on\ncorrectly modeling and removing the WFC3 instrument systematics from the light\ncurves. Building on previous HST work, we demonstrate that WFC3 analyses need\nto explore the use of a quadratic function to fit a visit-long time-dependent\nsystematic. This is important for establishing absolute transit and eclipse\ndepths in the white light curves of all transiting systems. The work presented\nhere exemplifies this point by putatively detecting the primary transit of\nUCF-1.01 with the use of a linear trend. However, using a quadratic trend, we\nachieve a better fit to the white light curves and a reduced transit depth that\nis inconsistent with previous Spitzer measurements. Furthermore, quadratic\ntrends with or without a transit model component produce comparable fits to the\navailable data. Using extant WFC3 transit light curves for GJ436b, we further\nvalidate the quadratic model component by achieving photon-limited model fit\nresiduals and consistent transit depths over multiple epochs.

We show that ExELS can also detect large numbers of hot, transiting\nexoplanets in the same population.

The age of the Bulge and its spread in metallicity further allows\nExELS to better constrain both the variation of companion frequency with\nmetallicity and statistically explore the strength of star-planet tides.\n  We conservatively estimate that ExELS will detect ~4100 sub-stellar objects,\nwith sensitivity typically reaching down to Neptune-mass planets.

Together with the flattening of the dust radial profile over time, this\nis consistent with ejection of a large quantity of slow moving dust and icy\ngrains in the coma at large heliocentric distance. The dust morphology was\ndominated by the tail, but a faint sunward dust fan was detected in March,\nApril, May, and September. We imaged multiple gas species in September,\nOctober, and November.

Multiple planets are\nnecessary to produce a wide cavity in the gas. However, multiple planets may\nalso be a burden to the carving out of very deep gaps. When additional planets\nare added to the system, the time-dependent perturbations from these additional\nsatellites can stir up gas in the gap, suppressing cavity opening. In this\nstudy, we perform two-dimensional numerical hydro calculations of gap opening\nfor single and multiple planets, showing the effect that additional planets\nhave on the gap depths. We show that multiple planets produce much shallower\ncavities than single planets, so that more massive planets are needed in the\nmultiple-planet case to produce an equivalent gap depth as in the single-planet\ncase. To deplete a gap by a factor of 100 for the parameters chosen in this\nstudy, one only requires $M_p \\approx 3.5M_J$ in the single-planet case, but\nmuch more massive planets, $M_p \\approx 7M_J$ are required in the\nmultiple-planet case.

Occurrence Rate of Giant\n  Extrasolar Planets as a Function of Mass and Metallicity Abstract: (abridged) We have obtained precise radial velocities for a sample of 373 G\nand K type giants at Lick Observatory regularly over more than 12 years.\nPlanets have been identified around 15 giant stars; an additional 20 giant\nstars host planet candidates. We investigate the occurrence rate of substellar\ncompanions around giant stars as a function of stellar mass and metallicity. We\nprobe the stellar mass range from about 1 to beyond 3 M_Sun, which is not being\nexplored by main-sequence samples. We fit the giant planet occurrence rate as a\nfunction of stellar mass and metallicity with a Gaussian and an exponential\ndistribution, respectively. We find strong evidence for a planet-metallicity\ncorrelation among the secure planet hosts of our giant star sample, in\nagreement with the one for main-sequence stars. However, the planet-metallicity\ncorrelation is absent for our sample of planet candidates, raising the\nsuspicion that a good fraction of them might indeed not be planets. Consistent\nwith the results obtained by Johnson for subgiants, the giant planet occurrence\nrate increases in the stellar mass interval from 1 to 1.9 M_Sun. However, there\nis a maximum at a stellar mass of 1.9 +0.1/-0.5 M_Sun, and the occurrence rate\ndrops rapidly for masses larger than 2.5-3.0 M_Sun.

The system has\na K-dwarf binary companion, WASP-85 B, at a separation of ~1.5\". The close\nproximity of this companion leads to contamination of our photometry,\ndecreasing the apparent transit depth that we account for during our analysis.\nAnalysis of the Ca II H+K lines shows strong emission that implies that both\nbinary components are strongly active. WASP-116 b is a warm, mildly inflated\nsuper-Saturn, with a mass of 0.59 M_Jup and a radius of 1.43 R_Jup. It was\ndiscovered orbiting a metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -0.28 dex), cool (T_eff = 5950 K) G0\ndwarf every 6.61 days. WASP-149 b is a typical hot Jupiter, orbiting a G6 dwarf\nwith a period of 1.33 days.

WASP photometry of\nthe system is contaminated by a nearby star; we therefore corrected the depth\nof the WASP transits using the measured dilution. WASP-149 lies inside the\n'Neptune desert' identified in the planetary mass-period plane by Mazeh,\nHolczer & Faigler (2016).\n  We model the modulation visible in the K2 lightcurve of WASP-85 using a\nsimple three-spot model consisting of two large spots on WASP-85 A, and one\nlarge spot on WASP-85 B, finding rotation periods of 13.1+/-0.1 days for\nWASP-85 A and 7.5+/-0.03 days for WASP-85 B.

Therefore, the distribution of observed rotational\namplitudes of a large sample of stars depends on the distribution of their\nprojected axes of rotation. Thus, comparison of the stellar rotational\namplitudes of the Kepler KOIs with those of Kepler single stars can provide a\nmeasure to indirectly infer the properties of the spin-orbit obliquity of\nKepler planets. We apply this technique to the large samples of 993 KOIs and\n33,614 single Kepler stars in temperature range of 3500-6500 K. We find with\nhigh significance that the amplitudes of cool KOIs are larger, on the order of\n10%, than those of the single stars. In contrast, the amplitudes of hot KOIs\nare systematically lower. After correcting for an observational bias, we\nestimate that the amplitudes of the hot KOIs are smaller than the single stars\nby about the same factor of 10%. The border line between the relatively larger\nand smaller amplitudes, relative to the amplitudes of the single stars, occurs\nat about 6000K. Our results suggest that the cool stars have their planets\naligned with their stellar rotation, while the planets around hot stars have\nlarge obliquities, consistent with the findings of Winn et al.

Exoplanet searches have unveiled a large\npopulation of short-period objects with hot atmospheres, very different from\nwhat we find in our solar system. Transiting exoplanets whose atmospheres can\nnow be studied by transit spectroscopy receive extremely strong UV fluxes and\nhave typical temperatures ranging from 400 to 2500 K. At these temperatures, UV\nphotolysis cross section data are severely lacking. Our goal is to provide\nhigh-temperature absorption cross sections and their temperature dependency for\nimportant atmospheric compounds. This study is dedicated to CO2, which is\nobserved and photodissociated in exoplanet atmospheres. We performed these\nmeasurements for the 115 - 200 nm range at 300, 410, 480, and 550 K. In the 195\n- 230 nm range, we worked at seven temperatures between 465 and 800 K. We found\nthat the absorption cross section of CO2 is very sensitive to temperature,\nespecially above 160 nm. Within the studied range of temperature, the CO2 cross\nsection can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. This, in particular,\nmakes the absorption of CO2 significant up to wavelengths as high as 230 nm,\nwhile it is negligible above 200 nm at 300 K. To investigate the influence of\nthese new data on the photochemistry of exoplanets, we implemented the measured\ncross section into a 1D photochemical model. The model predicts that accounting\nfor this temperature dependency of CO2 cross section can affect the computed\nabundances of NH3, CO2, and CO by one order of magnitude in the atmospheres of\nhot Jupiter and hot Neptune. \n\n"}

The fraction of\nFFPs that experiences a close encounter depends on both the stellar density and\nthe initial velocity distribution of the FFPs. Approximately half of the close\nencounters occur within the first 30 Myr, and only 10% occur after 100 Myr.

Estimating the rate of false positives of the overall\nKepler sample is necessary to derive the planet occurrence rate.

We use these observations to measures the\ncandidate's transit depths and infrared magnitudes. A bandpass-dependent depth\nalerts us to the potential presence of a blending star that could be the source\nof the observed eclipse: a false-positive scenario. For most of the candidates\n(85%), the transit depths measured with Kepler are consistent with the depths\nmeasured with Spitzer as expected for planetary objects, while we find that the\nmost discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars that\ndilute the photometry.

In this\npaper we present the predictions of the disc fragmentation model regarding the\nproperties of the discs around such low-mass objects. We find that the discs\naround objects that have formed by fragmentation in discs hosted by Sun-like\nstars (referred to as 'parent' discs and 'parent' stars) are more massive than\nexpected from the ${M}_{\\rm disc}-M_*$ relation (which is derived for stars\nwith masses $M_*>0.2 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$). Accordingly, the accretion rates onto\nthese objects are also higher than expected from the $\\dot{M}_*-M_*$ relation.\nMoreover there is no significant correlation between the mass of the brown\ndwarf or planet with the mass of its disc nor with the accretion rate from the\ndisc onto it. The discs around objects that form by disc fragmentation have\nlarger than expected masses as they accrete gas from the disc of their parent\nstar during the first few kyr after they form. The amount of gas that they\naccrete and therefore their mass depend on how they move in their parent disc\nand how they interact with it.

Here\nwe propose that a potential outcome of this atmospheric evolution is the\nformation of helium-dominated atmospheres. The hydrodynamic escape rates of\nNeptune- and sub-Neptune-sized exoplanets are comparable to the\ndiffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen, and therefore the escape is heavily\naffected by diffusive separation between hydrogen and helium. A helium\natmosphere can thus be formed -- from a primordial hydrogen-helium atmosphere\n-- via atmospheric hydrodynamic escape from the planet. The helium atmosphere\nhas very different abundances of major carbon and oxygen species from those of\na hydrogen atmosphere, leading to distinctive transmission and thermal emission\nspectral features. In particular, the hypothesis of a helium-dominated\natmosphere can explain the thermal emission spectrum of GJ 436 b, a warm\nNeptune-sized exoplanet, while also consistent with the transmission spectrum.\nThis model atmosphere contains trace amounts of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen,\nwith the predominance of CO over CH4 as the main form of carbon. With our\natmospheric evolution model, we find that if the mass of the initial atmosphere\nenvelope is 1E-3 planetary mass, hydrodynamic escape can reduce the hydrogen\nabundance in the atmosphere by several orders of magnitude in ~10 billion\nyears. Observations of exoplanet transits may thus detect signatures of helium\natmospheres and probe the evolutionary history of small exoplanets. \n\n"}

The TTVs of the two planets are approximated anti-correlated, with\nphases of $\\phi$ and $\\approx \\phi+\\pi$, where the phase $\\phi$ also depends on\nthe eccentricities and longitudes of pericenter.

We re-examine the data and find a statistically significant\ncorrelation between photometric variability and planetary orbital period that\nis qualitatively consistent with tidal interactions. However it is still\ndifficult to explain quantitatively, as it would require tides to be effective\nfor periods as long as tens of days. Second, Rogers and Lin argued against a\nparticular theory for tidal re-alignment by showing that initially retrograde\nsystems would fail to be re-aligned, in contradiction with the observed\nprevalence of prograde systems. We investigate a simple model that overcomes\nthis problem by taking into account the dissipation of inertial waves and the\nequilibrium tide, as well as magnetic braking. We identify a region of\nparameter space where re-alignment can be achieved, but it only works for\nclose-in giant planets, and requires some fine tuning. Thus, while we find both\nproblems to be more nuanced than they first appeared, the tidal model still has\nserious shortcomings. \n\n"}

In\nthis late stage, a significant amount of ice could have been delivered to 1 AU\nfrom outer regions in the form of mm to dm-sized pebbles. This raises the\nquestion why the present Earth is so depleted of water (with the ocean mass\nbeing as small as 0.023% of the Earth mass). Here we quantify the amount of icy\npebbles accreted by terrestrial embryos after the migration of the snow line\nassuming that no mechanism halts the pebble flow in outer disk regions. We use\na simplified version of the coagulation equation to calculate the formation and\nradial inward drift of icy pebbles in a protoplanetary disk. The pebble\naccretion cross section of an embryo is calculated using analytic expressions\npresented by recent studies. We find that the final mass and water content of\nterrestrial embryos strongly depends on the radial extent of the gas disk, the\nstrength of disk turbulence, and the time at which the snow lines arrives at 1\nAU. The disk's radial extent sets the lifetime of the pebble flow, while\nturbulence determines the density of pebbles at the midplane where the embryos\nreside. We find that the final water content of the embryos falls below 0.023\nwt% only if the disk is compact (< 100 AU), turbulence is strong at 1 AU, and\nthe snow line arrives at 1 AU later than 2-4 Myr after disk formation.

Recent population synthesis studies have found that the\nfraction of systems resulting in HJs (F_HJ) depends strongly on the planet\nmass, host stellar type and tidal dissipation strength, while the total\nmigration fraction F_mig = F_ HJ + F_dis (including both HJ formation and tidal\ndisruption) exhibits much weaker dependence. We present an analytical method\nfor calculating F_HJ and F_mig in the Lidov-Kozai migration scenario. The key\ningredient of our method is to determine the critical initial planet-binary\ninclination angle that drives the planet to reach sufficiently large\neccentricity for efficient tidal dissipation or disruption. This calculation\nincludes the effects of the octupole potential and short-range forces on the\nplanet.

The classical \"planetesimal\" accretion scenario for the formation of\nplanets has recently evolved with the idea that \"pebbles\", centimeter- to\nmeter-sized icy grains migrating in protoplanetary disks, can control\nplanetesimal and/or planetary growth.\n  Aims. We investigate how pebble accretion depends on disk properties and\naffects the formation of planetary systems\n  Methods. We construct analytical models of pebble accretion onto planetary\nembryos that consistently account for the mass and orbital evolution of the\npebble flow and reflect disk structure.\n  Results. We derive simple formulas for pebble accretion rates in the\nso-called \"settling\" regime for planetary embryos with more than 100 km in\nsize. For relatively smaller embryos or in outer disk regions, the accretion\nmode is 3D, meaning that the thickness of the pebble flow must be taken into\naccount, and resulting in an accretion rate that is independent of the embryo\nmass. For larger embryos or in inner regions, the accretion is in a 2D mode,\ni.e., the pebble disk may be considered to be infinitely thin. We show that the\nradial dependence of the pebble accretion rata is different (even the sign of\nthe power-law exponent changes) for different disk conditions such as the disk\nheating source (viscous heating or stellar irradiation), the drag law (Stokes\nor Epstein, and weak or strong coupling), and in the 2D or 3D accretion modes.\nWe also discuss the effect of the sublimation/destruction of icy pebbles inside\nthe snow line.\n  Conclusions. Pebble accretion easily produces a large diversity of planetary\nsystems. In other words, to correctly infer the results of planet formation\nthrough pebble accretion, detailed prescriptions of disk evolution and pebble\ngrowth, sublimation/destruction and migration are required. \n\n"}

This\nfriction acts both on the equilibrium/non-wave like tide and on tidal inertial\nwaves in these layers. It is thus necessary to obtain a robust prescription for\nthis friction. In the current state-of-the-art, it is modeled by a turbulent\neddy-viscosity coefficient, based on mixing-length theory, applied on\nvelocities of tides. However, none of the current prescriptions take into\naccount the action of rotation that can strongly affects turbulent convection.\nTherefore, we use theoretical scaling laws for convective velocities and\ncharacteristic lengthscales in rotating stars and planets that have been\nrecently confirmed by 3-D high-resolution nonlinear Cartesian numerical\nsimulations to derive a new prescription. A corresponding local model of tidal\nwaves is used to understand the consequences for the linear tidal dissipation.\nFinally, new grids of rotating stellar models and published values of planetary\nconvective Rossby numbers are used to discuss astrophysical consequences. The\naction of rotation on convection deeply modifies the turbulent friction applied\non tides. In the regime of rapid rotation (with a convective Rossby number\nbelow 0.25), the eddy-viscosity may be decreased by several ordres of\nmagnitude. It may lead to a loss of efficiency of the viscous dissipation of\nthe equilibrium tide and to a more efficient complex and resonant dissipation\nof tidal inertial waves in the bulk of convective regions. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to have a completely coupled treatment of the tidal/rotational\nevolution of star-planet systems and multiple stars with a coherent treatment\nof the variations of tidal flows and of their dissipation as a function of\nrotation. \n\n"}

This spiral wave instability (SWI)\narises from a resonant interaction between pairs of inertial waves, or\ninertial-gravity waves, and the background spiral wave. The development of the\ninstability in the linear regime involves the growth of a broad spectrum of\ninertial modes, with growth rates on the order of the orbital time, and results\nin a nonlinear saturated state in which turbulent velocity perturbations are of\na similar magnitude to those induced by the spiral wave. The turbulence induces\nangular momentum transport, and vertical mixing, at a rate that depends locally\non the amplitude of the spiral wave (we obtain a stress parameter $\\alpha \\sim\n5 \\times 10^{-4}$ in our reference model). The instability is found to operate\nin a wide-range of disk models, including those with isothermal or adiabatic\nequations of state, and in viscous disks where the dimensionless kinematic\nviscosity $\\nu\\le 10^{-5}$. This robustness suggests that the instability will\nhave applications to a broad range of astrophysical disk-related phenomena,\nincluding those in close binary systems, planets embedded in protoplanetary\ndisks (including Jupiter in our own Solar System) and FU Orionis outburst\nmodels.

To do\nthis we introduce an operational space (or op-space) built out of scalar\nfields. A point in op-space corresponds to some nominated set of scalar fields\ntaking some given values in coincidence. We assert that op-space is the space\nin which we observe the world. We introduce also a notion of agency (this\ncorresponds to the ability to set knob settings just like in Operational\nQuantum Theory). The effects of agents' actions should only be felt to the\nfuture so we introduce also a time direction field. Agency and time direction\ncan be understood as effective notions. We show how to formulate General\nRelativity as a possibilistic theory and as a probabilistic theory. In the\npossibilistic case we provide a compositional framework for calculating whether\nsome operationally described situation is possible or not. In the probabilistic\nversion we introduce probabilities and provide a compositional framework for\ncalculating the probability of some operationally described situation. Finally\nwe look at the quantum case. We review the operator tensor formulation of\nQuantum Theory and use it to set up an approach to Quantum Field Theory that is\nboth operational and compositional. Then we consider strategies for solving the\nproblem of Quantum Gravity. By referring only to operational quantities we are\nable to provide formulations for the possibilistic, probabilistic, and (the\nnascent) quantum cases that are manifestly invariant under diffeomorphisms. \n\n"}

We use these outcomes to consider which planetary\nsystem architectures maximise the observability of specific signatures, given\nthat signatures should be detected first around systems with optimal\narchitectures (if such systems exist in nature). Giant impact debris is most\nreadily detectable for 0.1-10Mearth planets at 1-5au, depending on detection\nmethod and spectral type. While A stars have putative giant impact debris at\n4-6au consistent with this sweet spot, that of FGK stars is typically <<1au\ncontrary to expectations; an absence of 1-3au giant impact debris could\nindicate a low frequency of terrestrial planets there. Three principles\nmaximise cometary influx from exo-Kuiper belts: a chain of closely separated\nplanets interior to the belt, none of which is a Jupiter-like ejector; planet\nmasses not increasing strongly with distance (for a net inward torque on\ncomets); ongoing replenishment of comets, possibly by embedded low-mass\nplanets.

Outward of angular moment and\nmovement of gas particles in the opposite direction (to the central body)\nhappens due to of viscose friction.

The occurrence of intense dissipation in\naccretion flows is among the long-standing unsolved problems in astrophysics.\nRevealing how the magnetized turbulence creates shear stress tensor is of\nprimary importance to understand the heating mechanism and the transport of\nangular momentum in accretion disks. The transport of angular momentum at\ngreatly enhanced rates is important for the main problem of cosmogony, that is\nunderstanding the dynamics of creation of compact astrophysical objects.\nWithout a theory explaining the enhanced energy dissipation in accretion flows\nof turbulent magnetized plasma we would have no clear picture of how our solar\nsystem has been created, why the angular momentum of the Sun is only 2% of the\nangular momentum of solar system, while carrying 99% of the solar system's\nmass. \n\n"}

Abstract: Photometry of short-period planetary systems allows astronomers to monitor\nexoplanets, their host stars, and their mutual interactions. In addition to the\ntransits of a planet in front of its star and the eclipses of the planet by its\nstar, researchers have reported flux variations at the orbital frequency and\nits harmonics: planetary reflection and/or emission and Doppler beaming of\nstarlight produce one peak per orbit, while ellipsoidal variations of a tidally\ndistorted star and/or planet produce two maxima per orbit. Researchers have\nalso reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital\nfrequency, sometimes much greater than the predictions of tidal theory. The\nreflected phase variations of a homogeneous planet contains power at even\norbital harmonics-important for studies of ellipsoidal variations-but cannot\ncontain odd orbital harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be\nproduced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet\nwith a North-South (N-S) asymmetric map. Either of these scenarios entail\nweather: short-period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and hence N-S\nsymmetric stellar forcing. North-South asymmetry in a giant planet would\ntherefore suggest stochastic localized features, such as weather. However, we\nfind that previous claims of large-amplitude odd modes in Kepler photometry are\nartifacts of removing planetary transits rather than modeling them. The only\nreliable claims of odd harmonics remain HAT-P-7b and Kepler-13Ab, for which the\nthird mode amplitude is 6-8% of the planetary flux. Although time-variable\nalbedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the\ninfrared variability of hot Jupiters make this hypothesis unlikely. We urge\ntheorists to study the effects of close-in planets on stellar atmospheres, as\nthis remains the only plausible hypothesis. \n\n"}

Observable atmospheric compositions of hot\nJupiters when compared against their host stars could potentially constrain\ntheir formation and migration processes. We compared the measured planetary and\nstellar abundances of carbon and oxygen for ten systems with hot Jupiters. If\nthe planets formed by core accretion with significant planetesimal accretion\nand migrated through the disk, the hot Jupiter atmospheres should be\nsubstantially super-stellar in O/H and sub-stellar in C/O.

Null\n  results for 19 planets Abstract: Short-period super-Earths and Neptunes are now known to be very frequent\naround solar-type stars. Improving our understanding of these mysterious\nplanets requires the detection of a significant sample of objects suitable for\ndetailed characterization. Searching for the transits of the low-mass planets\ndetected by Doppler surveys is a straightforward way to achieve this goal.\nIndeed, Doppler surveys target the most nearby main-sequence stars, they\nregularly detect close-in low-mass planets with significant transit\nprobability, and their radial velocity data constrain strongly the ephemeris of\npossible transits. In this context, we initiated in 2010 an ambitious Spitzer\nmulti-Cycle transit search project that targeted 25 low-mass planets detected\nby radial velocity, focusing mainly on the shortest-period planets detected by\nthe HARPS spectrograph. We report here null results for 19 targets of the\nproject. For 16 planets out of 19, a transiting configuration is strongly\ndisfavored or firmly rejected by our data for most planetary compositions. We\nderive a posterior probability of 83% that none of the probed 19 planets\ntransits (for a prior probability of 22%), which still leaves a significant\nprobability of 17% that at least one of them does transit. Globally, our\nSpitzer project revealed or confirmed transits for three of its 25 targeted\nplanets, and discarded or disfavored the transiting nature of 20 of them. Our\nlight curves demonstrate for Warm Spitzer excellent photometric precisions: for\n14 targets out of 19, we were able to reach standard deviations that were\nbetter than 50ppm per 30 min intervals. Combined with its Earth-trailing orbit,\nwhich makes it capable of pointing any star in the sky and to monitor it\ncontinuously for days, this work confirms Spitzer as an optimal instrument to\ndetect sub-mmag-deep transits on the bright nearby stars targeted by Doppler\nsurveys. \n\n"}

Circumstellar planets around one\nstar in a binary have been found, but not for tight binaries (< 5 AU).\nAdditionally, extra-solar moons are yet to be found. This paper motivates\nfinding both types of three-body system by calculating analytic and numerical\nprobabilities for all transit configurations, accounting for any mutual\ninclination and orbital precession. The precession and relative three-body\nmotion can increase the transit probability to as high as tens of per cent, and\nmake it inherently time-dependent over a precession period as short as 5-10 yr.\nCircumstellar planets in such tight binaries present a tempting observational\nchallenge: enhanced transit probabilities but with a quasi-periodic signature\nthat may be difficult to identify. This may help explain their present\nnon-detection, or maybe they simply do not exist. Whilst this paper considers\nbinaries of all orientations, it is demonstrated how eclipsing binaries\nfavourably bias the transit probabilities, sometimes to the point of being\nguaranteed.

We therefore address the general behavior of\nhydrodynamic thermal escape models ranging from Pluto to highly-irradiated\nExtrasolar Giant Planets (EGPs). Energy-limited escape is harder to test\nbecause copious XUV radiation is mostly a feature of young stars, and hence\nrequires extrapolating to historic XUV fluences ($I_{\\mathrm{xuv}}$) using\nproxies and power laws.

The discovered compact systems sometimes\ncontain multiple transiting planets, so that their orbital angular momentum\nvectors are tightly aligned. Since planetary orbits are susceptible to forced\noscillations of their inclination angles, the highly aligned nature of these\nsystems places constraints on possible additional (non-transiting) planets. If\nplanets in the outer regions of these solar systems have sufficiently large\nmass or sufficiently small semi-major axis, they will induce the compact inner\norbits to oscillate in and out of a transiting configuration. This paper\nconsiders the dynamics of the compact systems discovered to host five or more\nplanets. In order to not perturb these systems out of a continually, mutually\ntransiting state, additional planetary companions must generally have\nperiastron $p>10$ AU. Specific constraints are found for each of the 18\nplanetary systems considered, which are obtained by marginalising over other\norbital parameters using three different choices of priors for the companion\nproperties (a uniform prior, a transit-inspired prior, and an non-transiting\ndisk prior).

Gravitational instability rarely forms wide,\n  giant planets Abstract: Understanding the formation and evolution of giant planets ($\\ge$1 $M_{Jup}$)\nat wide orbital separation ($\\ge$5 AU) is one of the goals of direct imaging.\nOver the past 15 years, many surveys have placed strong constraints on the\noccurrence rate of wide-orbit giants, mostly based on non-detections, but very\nfew have tried to make a direct link with planet formation theories. In the\npresent work, we combine the results of our previously published VLT/NaCo large\nprogram with the results of 12 past imaging surveys to constitute a statistical\nsample of 199 FGK stars within 100 pc, including 3 stars with sub-stellar\ncompanions. Using Monte Carlo simulations and assuming linear flat\ndistributions for the mass and semi-major axis of planets, we estimate the\nsub-stellar companion frequency to be within 0.75-5.7% at the 68% confidence\nlevel (CL) within 20-300 AU and 0.5-75 $M_{Jup}$, which is compatible with\npreviously published results. We also compare our results with the predictions\nof state-of-the-art population synthesis models based on the gravitational\ninstability (GI) formation scenario by Forgan & Rice (2013), with and without\nscattering. We estimate that in both the scattered and non-scattered\npopulations, we would be able to detect more than 30% of companions in the 1-75\n$M_{Jup}$ range (95% CL). With the 3 sub-stellar detections in our sample, we\nestimate the fraction of stars that host a planetary system formed by GI to be\nwithin 1.0-8.6% (95% CL).

The\n\\textit{Spitzer} data exhibit finite-source effects due to the passage of the\nlens close to or directly over the surface of the source star as seen from\n\\textit{Spitzer}. Such finite-source effects generally yield measurements of\nthe angular Einstein radius, which when combined with the microlens parallax\nderived from a comparison between the ground-based and the \\textit{Spitzer}\nlight curves, yields the lens mass and lens-source relative parallax. From this\nanalysis, we find that the lens of OGLE-2015-BLG-1482 is a very low-mass star\nwith the mass $0.10 \\pm 0.02 \\ M_\\odot$ or a brown dwarf with the mass $55\\pm 9\n\\ M_{J}$, which are respectively located at $D_{\\rm LS} = 0.80 \\pm 0.19\\\n\\textrm{kpc}$ and $ D_{\\rm LS} = 0.54 \\pm 0.08\\ \\textrm{kpc}$, and thus it is\nthe first isolated low-mass microlens that has been decisively located in the\nGalactic bulge. The fundamental reason for the degeneracy is that the\nfinite-source effect is seen only in a single data point from \\textit{Spitzer}\nand this single data point gives rise to two solutions for $\\rho$. Because the\n$\\rho$ degeneracy can be resolved only by relatively high cadence observations\naround the peak, while the \\textit{Spitzer} cadence is typically $\\sim 1\\,{\\rm\nday}^{-1}$, we expect that events for which the finite-source effect is seen\nonly in the \\textit{Spitzer} data may frequently exhibit this $\\rho$\ndegeneracy.

We investigate the linear stability of KL modes for tilted\ninviscid discs under the approximations that the disc eccentricity is small and\nthe disc remains flat. By using 1D equations, we are able to probe regimes of\nlarge ratios of outer to inner disc edge radii that are realistic for binary\nsystems of hundreds of AU separations and are not easily probed by\nmulti-dimensional simulations. For order unity binary mass ratios, KL\ninstability is possible for a window of disc aspect ratios H/r in the outer\nparts of a disc that roughly scale as (n_b/n)^2 < H/r < n_b/n, for binary\norbital frequency n_b and orbital frequency n at the disc outer edge.

Traditionally, super-stellar elemental abundances in giant\nplanets were thought to be possible due to accretion of metal-rich solids. Such\nenrichments are accompanied by oxygen-rich compositions (i.e. C/O below the\ndisc's value, assumed to be solar, C/O=0.54). Without solid accretion the\nplanets are expected to have sub-solar metallicity, but high C/O ratios. This\narises because the solids are dominated by oxygen-rich species, e.g. H$_2$O and\nCO$_2$, which freeze out in the disk earlier than CO, leaving the gas metal\npoor but carbon-rich. Here we demonstrate that super-solar metallicities can be\nachieved by gas accretion alone when growth and radial drift of pebbles are\nconsidered in protoplanetary discs. Through this mechanism planets may\nsimultaneously acquire super-solar metallicities and super-solar C/O ratios.\nThis happens because the pebbles transport volatile species inward as they\nmigrate through the disc, enriching the gas at snow lines where the volatiles\nsublimate. Furthermore, the planet's composition can be used to constrain where\nit formed. Since high C/H and C/O ratios cannot be created by accreting solids,\nit may be possible to distinguish between formation via pebble accretion and\nplanetesimal accretion by the level of solid enrichment. Finally, we expect\nthat Jupiter's C/O ratio should be near or above solar if its enhanced carbon\nabundance came through accreting metal rich gas. Thus Juno's measurement of\nJupiter's C/O ratio should determine whether Jupiter accreted its metals from\ncarbon rich gas or oxygen rich solids. \n\n"}

In low\nviscosity gas ($\\alpha\\lesssim10^{-4}$), a super-Earth opens two annular gaps\nto either side of its orbit by the action of Lindblad torques. This double gap\nand its associated gas pressure gradients cause dust particles to be dragged by\ngas into three rings: one ring sandwiched between the two gaps, and two rings\nlocated at the gap edges farthest from the planet. Depending on system\nparameters, additional rings may manifest for a single planet.

Hydrogen deuteride (HD) is a promising\nalternative to the commonly-used gas mass tracer, CO. We aim to examine the\nrobustness of HD as tracer of the disk gas mass, specifically the effect of gas\nmass on the HD FIR emission and its sensitivity to the vertical structure.\nDeuterium chemistry reactions relevant for HD were implemented in the\nthermochemical code DALI and models were run for a range of disk masses and\nvertical structures. The HD J=1-0 line intensity depends directly on the gas\nmass through a sublinear power law relation with a slope of ~0.8. Assuming no\nprior knowledge about the vertical structure of a disk and using only the HD\n1-0 flux, gas masses can be estimated to within a factor of 2 for low mass\ndisks (M$_{\\rm disk} < 10^{-3}$ M$_\\odot$). For more massive disks, this\nuncertainty increases to more than an order of magnitude. Adding the HD 2-1\nline or independent information about the vertical structure can reduce this\nuncertainty to a factor of ~3 for all disk masses. For TW Hya, using the radial\nand vertical structure from Kama et al. 2016b the observations constrain the\ngas mass to $6\\cdot10^{-3}$ M$_\\odot$ < M$_{\\rm disk} < 9\\cdot10^{-3}$\nM$_\\odot$.

The dependence of the\ntidal interactions on the structural and rotational evolution of the star is of\npeculiar importance and should be correctly treated. We quantify how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of rotating low-mass stars evolves from\nthe pre-main sequence up to the red-giant branch depending on the initial\nstellar mass. We investigate the consequences of this evolution on planetary\norbital evolution. We couple the tidal dissipation formalism described in\nMathis (2015) to the stellar evolution code STAREVOL and apply it to rotating\nstars with masses between 0.3 and 1.4 M$_\\odot$. In addition, we generalize the\nwork of Bolmont & Mathis (2016) by following the orbital evolution of close-in\nplanets using the new tidal dissipation predictions for advanced phases of\nstellar evolution. On the PMS the evolution of tidal dissipation is controlled\nby the evolution of the internal structure of the contracting star. On the MS\nit is strongly driven by the variation of surface rotation that is impacted by\nmagnetized stellar winds braking. The main effect of taking into account the\nrotational evolution of the stars is to lower the tidal dissipation strength by\nabout four orders of magnitude on the main-sequence, compared to a normalized\ndissipation rate that only takes into account structural changes. The evolution\nof the dissipation strongly depends on the evolution of the internal structure\nand rotation of the star. From the pre-main sequence up to the tip of the\nred-giant branch, it varies by several orders of magnitude, with strong\nconsequences for the orbital evolution of close-in massive planets. These\neffects are the strongest during the pre-main sequence, implying that the\nplanets are mainly sensitive to the star's early history. \n\n"}

In fact, most collapsing\nmasses are bounced back due to centrifugal force, since angular momentum\nsignificantly grows before collapse. As a consequence, most of the formed PBHs\nare rapidly rotating near the extreme value $a_{*}=1$, where $a_{*}$ is the\nnondimensional Kerr parameter at their formation. The smaller the density\nfluctuation $\\sigma_{H}$ at horizon entry is, the stronger the tendency towards\nthe extreme rotation.

In a highly eccentric binary, the tidal potential of one body can\nexcite oscillatory modes in the other during a pericenter passage, resulting in\nenergy exchange between the modes and the binary orbit. These modes exhibit one\nof three behaviors over multiple passages: low-amplitude oscillations, large\namplitude oscillations corresponding to a resonance between the orbital\nfrequency and the mode frequency, and chaotic growth.

The lobes\nexert torques of opposite sign on the planet, each comparable in magnitude to\nthe one-sided Lindblad torque.

Next, we show with strong significance that $\\epsilon(F)$\nincreases with $T_{\\rm{eq}}$ towards a maximum of $\\sim 2.5\\%$ at $T_{\\rm{eq}}\n\\approx 1500$ K, and then decreases as temperatures increase further, falling\nto $\\sim0.2\\%$ at $T_\\rm{eff}= 2500$ K. This high-flux decrease in inflation\nefficiency was predicted by the Ohmic dissipation model of giant planet\ninflation but not other models. We also explicitly check the thermal tides\nmodel and find that it predicts far more variance in radii than is observed.\nThus, our results provide evidence for the Ohmic dissipation model and a\nfunctional form for $\\epsilon(F)$ that any future theories of hot Jupiter radii\ncan be tested against. \n\n"}

We perform a 3D SPH simulation of a circumbinary disc\nmisaligned by $60^\\circ$ with respect to the binary orbital plane. The inner\ndisc breaks from the outer regions, precessing as a rigid body, and leading to\na complex evolution.

IOPF involves sequential planet formation from\npebble-rich rings that are fed from the outer disk and trapped at the pressure\nmaximum associated with the dead zone inner boundary (DZIB). Planet masses are\nset by their ability to open a gap and cause the DZIB to retreat outwards.

We build a comprehensive numerical model for the evolution of\nnucleobases in warm little ponds leading to the emergence of the first\nnucleotides and RNA. We couple Earth's early evolution with complex prebiotic\nchemistry in these environments. We find that RNA polymers must have emerged\nvery quickly after the deposition of meteorites (< a few years). Their\nconstituent nucleobases were primarily meteoritic in origin and not from\ninterplanetary dust particles. Ponds appeared as continents rose out of the\nearly global ocean but this increasing availability of \"targets\" for meteorites\nwas offset by declining meteorite bombardment rates. Moreover, the rapid losses\nof nucleobases to pond seepage during wet periods, and to UV photodissociation\nduring dry periods means that the synthesis of nucleotides and their\npolymerization into RNA occurred in just one to a few wet-dry cycles. Under\nthese conditions, RNA polymers likely appeared prior to 4.17 billion years ago.\n  Significance: There are two competing hypotheses for the site at which an RNA\nworld emerged: hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean and warm little ponds.\nBecause the former lacks wet and dry cycles, which are well known to promote\npolymerization (in this case, of nucleotides into RNA), we construct a\ncomprehensive model for the origin of RNA in the latter sites.

Besides the transition from accretion to erosion with\nincreasing impact velocity, similar-sized collisions can also result in\nhit-and-run outcomes for sufficiently oblique impact angles and large enough\nprojectile-to-target mass ratios. We study volatile transfer and loss focusing\non hit-and-run encounters by means of Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics\nsimulations, including all main parameters: impact velocity, impact angle, mass\nratio, and also the total colliding mass. We find a broad range of overall\nwater losses, up to 75% in the most energetic hit-and-run events, and confirm\nthe much more severe consequences for the smaller body also for stripping of\nvolatile layers. Transfer of water between projectile and target inventories is\nfound to be mostly rather inefficient, and final water contents are dominated\nby pre-collision inventories reduced by impact losses, for similar\npre-collision water mass fractions. Comparison with our numerical results shows\nthat current collision outcome models are not accurate enough to reliably\npredict these composition changes in hit-and-run events. To also account for\nnon-mechanical losses we estimate the amount of collisionally vaporized water\nover a broad range of masses, and find that these contributions are\nparticularly important in collisions of ~Mars-sized bodies, with sufficiently\nhigh impact energies, but still relatively low gravity.

Then, we made use of the same semi-analytical model to describe the\nevolution of embryos and planetesimals during the gaseous phase. Finally, we\ncarried out N-body simulations of planetary accretion in order to analyze the\nformation and water delivery of planets in the HZ in the different dynamical\nenvironments. Results. Water worlds are efficiently formed in the HZ in\ndifferent dynamical scenarios. In systems with a giant planet analog to Jupiter\nor Saturn around the snow line, super-Earths tend to migrate into the HZ from\noutside the snow line as a result of interactions with other embryos and\naccrete water only during the gaseous phase.

Abstract: HD 100546 is one of the few known pre-main-sequence stars that may host a\nplanetary system in its disk. We analyze new VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL polarimetric\nimages of HD 100546 with filters in H$\\alpha$ and the adjacent continuum. We\nhave probed the disk gap and the surface layers of the outer disk, covering a\nregion < 500 mas (< 55 au at 109 pc) from the star, at an angular resolution of\n~ 20 mas. Our data show an asymmetry: the SE and NW regions of the outer disk\nare more polarized than the SW and NE. This can be explained from a\npreferential scattering angle close to 90$^o$, consistent with previous\npolarization images. The outer disk extends from 13 $\\pm$ 2 to 45 $\\pm$ 9 au,\nwith a position angle and inclination of 137 $\\pm$ 5$^o$ and 44 $\\pm$ 8$^o$.\nThe comparison with previous estimates suggests that the disk inclination could\nincrease with the stellocentric distance, although the different measurements\nare still consistent within the error bars. In addition, no direct signature of\nthe innermost candidate companion is detected from polarimetry, confirming\nrecent results based on intensity imagery.

In addition, an effective surface can be imposed by refraction, thereby\nlimiting the pressure levels probed by transmission spectroscopy. The main\nobjective of the paper is to model the effects of refraction on photometric\nlight curves for realistic planets and to explore the dependencies on\natmospheric physical parameters.

Conceptual aspects and cosmological predictions Abstract: Even if the fundamental action of gravity is local, the corresponding quantum\neffective action, that includes the effect of quantum fluctuations, is a\nnonlocal object. These nonlocalities are well understood in the ultraviolet\nregime but much less in the infrared, where they could in principle give rise\nto important cosmological effects. Here we systematize and extend previous work\nof our group, in which it is assumed that a mass scale $\\Lambda$ is dynamically\ngenerated in the infrared, giving rise to nonlocal terms in the quantum\neffective action of gravity. We give a detailed discussion of conceptual\naspects related to nonlocal gravity and of the cosmological consequences of\nthese models. The requirement of providing a viable cosmological evolution\nseverely restricts the form of the nonlocal terms, and selects a model (the\nso-called RR model) that corresponds to a dynamical mass generation for the\nconformal mode. For such a model: (1) there is a FRW background evolution,\nwhere the nonlocal term acts as an effective dark energy with a phantom\nequation of state, providing accelerated expansion without a cosmological\nconstant. (2) Cosmological perturbations are well behaved. (3) Implementing the\nmodel in a Boltzmann code and comparing with observations we find that the RR\nmodel fits the CMB, BAO, SNe, structure formation data and local $H_0$\nmeasurements at a level statistically equivalent to $\\Lambda$CDM. (4) Bayesian\nparameter estimation shows that the value of $H_0$ obtained in the RR model is\nhigher than in $\\Lambda$CDM, reducing to $2.0\\sigma$ the tension with the value\nfrom local measurements.

The disk in such systems is twisted/warped due to the gravitational\ntorques from the oblate central star and the external companion. We calculate\nthe disk warp profile, taking into account of bending wave propagation and\nviscosity in the disk. We show that for typical protostellar disk parameters,\nthe disk warp is small, thereby justifying the \"flat-disk\" approximation\nadopted in previous theoretical studies. However, the viscous dissipation\nassociated with the small disk warp/twist tends to drive the disk toward\nalignment with the binary or the central star. We calculate the relevant\ntimescales for the alignment. We find the alignment is effective for\nsufficiently cold disks with strong external torques, especially for systems\nwith rapidly rotating stars, but is ineffective for the majority of\nstar-disk-binary systems.

This transition is coincident with a minimum in the\noccurrence rate of such objects, suggesting that the maximum mass of a\ncelestial body formed through core accretion like a planet is less than 10\nM_Jup.

An analytic noise model, which is informed by the ongoing\nengineering developments, is used to compute maximum achievable signal-to-noise\nratios and scientifically viable integration times for hypothetical star planet\nsystems, as well as to investigate the constraining power of various\ncombinations of WFIRST-CGI photometric and spectral observations. This work\nintroduces two simple models for planetary geometric albedos, which are\ninspired largely by the solar system's gas giants. The first planet model is a\nhybrid Jupiter-Neptune model, which separately treats the short and long\nwavelengths where chromophores and methane dominate absorption, respectively.\nThe second planet model fixes cloud and haze properties in CoolTLusty to match\nJupiter's albedo spectrum, it then perturbs only the metallicity. MCMC\nretrievals performed on simulated observations are used to assess the precision\nwith which planet model parameters can be measured subject to different\nexposure times and observing cases. Fit results for both models'\nparameterizations of geometric albedo spectra demonstrate that a rough\nindication of the metallicity or methane content should be possible for some\nWFIRST-CGI targets. We conclude that real observations will likely be able to\ndifferentiate between extreme cases using these models, but will lack the\nprecision necessary to uncover subtle trends. \n\n"}

Currently, there exist several models describing such variations and\ntheir effect on the photometric flux. By using Bayesian model testing in\nconjunction with the Bayesian-based exoplanet characterization software package\nEXONEST, the most probable representation for ellipsoidal variations was\ndetermined for synthetic data and the confirmed hot Jupiter exoplanet\nKepler-13Ab.The most preferred model for ellipsoidal variations observed in the\nKepler-13 light curve was determined to be EVIL-MC.

The observed variability of asymmetric,\ndouble-peaked emission line profiles in about half of such systems could be\ninterpreted as the signature of precession of an eccentric gaseous debris disk.\nThe variability timescales --- from decades down to $1.4$ yr (recently inferred\nfor the debris disk around HE 1349--2305) --- are in rough agreement with the\nrate of general relativistic (GR) precession in the test particle limit.\nHowever, it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can drive such a\nfast, coherent precession of a radially extended (out to $1 R_\\odot$) gaseous\ndisk mediated by internal stresses (pressure). Here we use the linear theory of\neccentricity evolution in hydrodynamic disks to determine several key\nproperties of eccentric modes in gaseous debris disks around WDs. We find a\ncritical dependence of both the precession period and radial eccentricity\ndistribution of the modes on the inner disk radius, $r_\\mathrm{in}$. For small\ninner radii, $r_\\mathrm{in} \\lesssim (0.2 - 0.4) R_\\odot$, the modes are\nGR-driven, with periods of $\\approx 1 - 10$ yr.

Multi-wavelength observations are indispensable in studying disk\ngeometry and dust evolution processes in protoplanetary disks. Aims. We aimed\nto construct a 3-dimensional model of HD 163296 capable of reproducing\nsimultaneously new observations of the disk surface in scattered light with the\nSPHERE instrument and thermal emission continuum observations of the disk\nmidplane with ALMA. We want to determine why the SED of HD 163296 is\nintermediary between the otherwise well-separated group I and group II Herbig\nstars. Methods. The disk was modelled using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer\ncode MCMax3D. The radial dust surface density profile was modelled after the\nALMA observations, while the polarized scattered light observations were used\nto constrain the inclination of the inner disk component and turbulence and\ngrain growth in the outer disk. Results. While three rings are observed in the\ndisk midplane in millimeter thermal emission at $\\sim$80, 124 and 200 AU, only\nthe innermost of these is observed in polarized scattered light, indicating a\nlack of small dust grains on the surface of the outer disk. We provide two\nmodels capable of explaining this difference. The first model uses increased\nsettling in the outer disk as a mechanism to bring the small dust grains on the\nsurface of the disk closer to the midplane, and into the shadow cast by the\nfirst ring. The second model uses depletion of the smallest dust grains in the\nouter disk as a mechanism for decreasing the optical depth at optical and NIR\nwavelengths.

Simultaneously, we perform a set of\ncomparison simulations for laminar viscous discs where the particles experience\nstochastic kicks. For both cases, we measure the accretion rate onto the cores\nas a function of core mass and Stokes number ($\\tau_s$) of the particles and\ncompare it to recent MRI turbulence simulations. Overall the dynamic is very\nsimilar for the particles in the VSI turbulent disc and the laminar case with\nstochastic kicks. For the small mass planets (i.e. 5 and 10 $M_\\oplus$),\nwell-coupled particles with $\\tau_s = 1$, which have a size of about one meter\nat this location, we find an accretion efficiency (rate of particles accreted\nover drifting inward) of about 1.6-3%. For smaller and larger particles this\nefficiency is higher. However, the fast inward drift for $\\tau_s = 1$ particles\nmakes them the most effective for rapid growth, leading to mass doubling times\nof about 20,000 yr. For masses between 10 and 30 $M_\\oplus$ the core reaches\nthe pebble isolation mass and the particles are trapped at the pressure maximum\njust outside of the planet, shutting off further particle accretion. \n\n"}

Our sample spans masses from 0.02 to 0.08\nMsol and has been characterised extensively in the past. To search for periods,\nwe utilize three different methods (autocorrelation, periodogram, Gaussian\nProcesses).

With an overall median period of 1.9 d, brown\ndwarfs in Taurus rotate slower than their counterparts in somewhat older (3-10\nMyr) star-forming regions, consistent with spin-up of the latter due to\ncontraction and angular momentum conservation, a clear sign that disk braking\noverall is inefficient and/or temporary in this mass domain.

We present theoretical and numerical studies on the outcome of\ncapture into first-order mean motion resonances (MMRs) using a parametrized\nplanet migration model that takes into account nonlinear eccentricity damping\ndue to planet-disk interaction. This parametrization is based on numerical\nhydrodynamical simulations and is more realistic than the simple linear\nparametrization widely used in previous analytic studies. We find that\nnonlinear eccentricity damping can significantly influence the stability and\noutcome of resonance capture. In particular, the equilibrium eccentricity of\nthe planet captured into MMRs become larger, and the captured MMR state tends\nto be more stable compared to the prediction based on the simple migration\nmodel. In addition, when the migration is sufficiently fast or/and the planet\nmass ratio is sufficiently small, we observe a novel phenomenon of eccentricity\novershoot, where the planet's eccentricity becomes very large before settling\ndown to the lower equilibrium value. This can lead to the ejection of the\nsmaller planet if its eccentricity approaches unity during the overshoot.

A necessary\ncondition for the existence of such exomoons is their long-term dynamical\nstability.

We determine regions of stability\nand obtain stability maps in the (a_m,i_pm) plane, where a_m is the initial\nexolunar semimajor axis with respect to the CBP, and i_pm is the initial\ninclination of the orbit of the exomoon around the planet with respect to the\norbit of the planet around the stellar binary. Ignoring any dependence on i_pm,\nfor most Kepler CBPs the stability regions are well described by the location\nof the 1:1 mean motion commensurability of the binary orbit with the orbit of\nthe moon around the CBP. This is related to a destabilizing effect of the\nbinary compared to the case if the binary were replaced by a single body, and\nwhich is borne out by corresponding 3-body integrations.

With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets. The inferred high CS/SO and CS/SO$_2$ ratios require a non-solar C/O\ngas-phase ratio of > 1, consistent with the recent observations of hydrocarbon\nrings in DM Tau. The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to\nCS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau\nand points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas. \n\n"}

As a result, both Jovian and Neptunian Trojans share a common\norigin with the primordial disk population, whose other surviving members\nconstitute today's trans-Neptunian object (TNO) populations. The cold classical\nTNOs are ultra-red, while the dynamically excited \"hot\" population of TNOs\ncontains a mixture of ultra-red and blue objects. In contrast, Jovian and\nNeptunian Trojans are observed to be blue. While the absence of ultra-red\nJovian Trojans can be readily explained by the sublimation of volatile material\nfrom their surfaces due to the high flux of solar radiation at 5AU, the lack of\nultra-red Neptunian Trojans presents both a puzzle and a challenge to formation\nmodels. In this work we report the discovery by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) of\ntwo new dynamically stable L4 Neptunian Trojans,2013 VX30 and 2014 UU240, both\nwith inclinations i >30 degrees, making them the highest-inclination known\nstable Neptunian Trojans.

Fossilized Resonant Dropouts Tentatively Confirm Neptune's\n  Migration was Grainy and Slow Abstract: The migration of Neptune's resonances through the proto-Kuiper belt has been\nimprinted in the distribution of small bodies in the outer Solar System. Here\nwe analyze five published Neptune migration models in detail, focusing on the\nhigh pericenter distance (high-q) trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) near Neptune's\n5:2 and 3:1 mean-motion resonances, because they have large resonant\npopulations, are outside the main classical belt, and are relatively isolated\nfrom other strong resonances. We compare the observationally biased output from\nthese dynamical models with the detected TNOs from the Outer Solar System\nOrigins Survey, via its Survey Simulator. All of the four new OSSOS detections\nof high-q non-resonant TNOs are on the Sunward side of the 5:2 and 3:1\nresonances. We show that even after accounting for observation biases, this\nasymmetric distribution cannot be drawn from a uniform distribution of TNOs at\n2sigma confidence. As shown by previous work, our analysis here tentatively\nconfirms that the dynamical model that uses grainy slow Neptune migration\nprovides the best match to the real high-q TNO orbital data. However, due to\nextreme observational biases, we have very few high-q TNO discoveries with\nwhich to statistically constrain the models.

We develop a simple model for planetary growth including pebble and\ngas accretion, and orbital migration in an evolving protoplanetary disk. The\nmodel is run for a population of 2000 stars with a range of disk masses and\nradii, and initial protoplanet orbits. The resulting planetary distribution is\ncompared with the observed population of extrasolar planets, and the model\nparameters are improved iteratively using a particle swarm optimization scheme.\nThe characteristics of the final planetary systems are mainly controlled by the\npebble isolation mass, which is the mass of a planet that perturbs nearby gas\nenough to halt the inward flux of drifting pebbles and stop growth. The pebble\nisolation mass increases with orbital distance so that giant planet cores can\nonly form in the outer disk. Giants migrate inwards, populating a wide range of\nfinal orbital distances. The best model fits have large initial protoplanet\nmasses, short pebble drift timescales, low disk viscosities, and short\natmospheric cooling times, all of which promote rapid growth. The model\nsuccessfully reproduces the observed frequency and distribution of giant\nplanets and brown dwarfs. The fit for super Earths is poorer for single-planet\nsystems, but improves steadily when more protoplanets are included. Although\nthe study was designed to match the extrasolar planet distribution, analogs of\nthe Solar System form in 1-2% of systems that contain at least 4 protoplanets. \n\n"}

One\npossible explanation for these observations is a disc warp, which could be\ninduced by a planet on a misaligned orbit. We present three-dimensional\nnumerical simulations of the tidal interaction between a protoplanetary disc\nand a misaligned planet. For low planet masses we show that our simulations\naccurately model the evolution of inclined planet orbit (up to moderate\ninclinations). For a planet massive enough to carve a gap, the disc is\nseparated into two components and the gas interior and exterior to the planet\norbit evolve separately, forming an inner and outer disc. Due to the\ninclination of the planet, a warp develops across the planet orbit such that\nthere is a relative tilt and twist between these discs.

The obliquity variations of Ceres over $[-20:0]\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$ are\nbetween $2$ and $20{\\deg}$ and the obliquity variations of Vesta are between\n$21$ and $45{\\deg}$.

They are nearly coplanar to each other; the\ninner one has a large eccentricity (~0.82); and the apses of the two orbits\nlibrate around anti-alignment. Such a state defies available proposals for\nlarge eccentricities. We argue that it is instead uniquely produced by a\ndecaying protoplanetary disk. When the disk was massive, its precessional\neffect on the planets forced the two apses to center around an anti-aligned\nstate. And as the disk is gradually eroded, the pair of planets are\nadiabatically transported to a new state where most of the eccentricity (or\nrather, the angular momentum deficit) is transferred to the inner planet, and\nthe two apses are largely anti-aligned. During this transport, any initial\nmutual inclination may be reduced or enhanced; either may be compatible with\nthe current constraints. So a primordial disk can drive up planet\neccentricities both in resonant planet pairs (as has been shown for GJ 876) and\nin secularly interacting, non-resonant pairs.

Previous works, focused on the mechanical\nshock caused by a giant impact, have shown that these impacts can eject large\nfractions of the planetary envelope, offering a partial explanation for the\nobserved spread in exoplanet compositions. Here, we examine the thermal\nconsequences of giant impacts, and show that the atmospheric loss caused by\nthese effects can significantly exceed that caused by mechanical shocks for\nhydrogen-helium (H/He) envelopes. When a giant impact occurs, part of the\nimpact energy is converted into thermal energy, heating the rocky core and the\nenvelope. We find that the ensuing thermal expansion of the envelope can lead\nto a period of sustained, rapid mass loss through a Parker wind, resulting in\nthe partial or complete erosion of the H/He envelope. The fraction of the\nenvelope lost depends on the planet's orbital distance from its host star and\nits initial thermal state, and hence age. Planets closer to their host stars\nare more susceptible to thermal atmospheric loss triggered by impacts than ones\non wider orbits. Similarly, younger planets, with rocky cores which are still\nhot and molten from formation, suffer greater atmospheric loss.

While some are clearly the result of known processes,\nothers still have largely unexplained eccentricity and inclination values.\nIapetus has a still unexplained 3% orbital eccentricity and its orbital plane\nis tilted with respect to its local Laplace plane. On the other hand,\nastrometric measurements of saturnian moons have revealed high tidal migration\nrates, corresponding to a quality factor Q of Saturn of around 1600 for the\nmid-sized icy moons. We show how a past crossing of the 5:1 mean motion\nresonance between Titan and Iapetus may be a plausible scenario to explain\nIapetus' orbit. We have carried out numerical simulations of the resonance\ncrossing using an N-Body code as well as using averaged equations of motion. A\nlarge span of migration rates were explored for Titan and Iapetus was started\non its local Laplace plane with a circular orbit. The resonance crossing can\ntrigger a chaotic evolution of the eccentricity and the inclination of Iapetus.\nThe outcome of the resonance is highly dependent on the migration rate. For a\nquality factor Q of over around 2000, the chaotic evolution of Iapetus in the\nresonance leads in most cases to its ejection, while simulations with a quality\nfactor between 100 and 2000 show a departure from the resonance with\npost-resonant eccentricities spanning from 0 up to 15%, and free inclinations\ncapable of reaching 11 degrees. Usually high inclinations come with high\neccentricities but some simulations show elements compatible with Iapetus'\ncurrent orbit. A quality factor between 100 and 2000 at the frequency of Titan\nwould bring Titan and Iapetus into a 5:1 resonance, which would perturb\nIapetus' eccentricity and inclination to values observed today. Such rapid\ntidal migration would have avoided Iapetus' ejection around 40 to 800 million\nyears ago. \n\n"}

Thus,\nthey can record low-temperature alteration events throughout asteroid\nevolution. However, the precise nature of labile-element mobilization in\nplanetary materials is unknown. Here we characterize the thermally induced\nmovements of the labile elements S, As, Se, Te, Cd, Sb, and Hg in carbonaceous\nchondrites by conducting experimental simulations of volatile-element\nmobilization during thermal metamorphism. This process results in appreciable\nloss of some elements at temperatures as low as 500 K. This work builds on\nprevious laboratory heating experiments on primitive meteorites and shows the\nsensitivity of chondrite compositions to excursions in temperature.

Across the 0.47-1 micron wavelength\nrange, the data imply an atmospheric opacity comparable to - and in some\nspectroscopic channels exceeding - that previously measured at near-infrared\nwavelengths (1.15-1.65 micron).

The planetary\nphotometric emissions are due to the thermal emissions of the exoplanet, and\nreflected stellar light. In many cases it is assumed that the incident stellar\nlight may be modeled as plane parallel rays. For extremely close-in exoplanets\nthe finite angular size of the host star must be taken into account and the\nplane parallel ray model breaks down. One consequence of modeling the incident\nstellar radiation in this manner is the creation of three distinct zones as\nopposed to the two zones present in the plane parallel ray model. The three\nzones are the fully illuminated, penumbral, and un-illuminated zones. The\nexistence of the penumbral zone means that more than half of the exoplanet will\nbe at least partially illuminated by the host star. In this work we will\npresent a complete derivation of the reflective luminosity of the fully\nilluminated zone. In addition, we will present an outline for the derivation of\nthe reflected intensity distribution of the penumbral zone. Within this work we\nwill also derive a new expression for the thermal luminosity of an exoplanet by\ntreating each of the three zones as a blackbody emitting at a constant\ntemperature. Finally, it will be shown that an estimation of the radius of the\nexoplanet requires proper accounting of light from the penumbral zone during\nthe primary transit. Not doing so risks underestimating the radius of the\nexoplanet and an overestimation of its geometric albedo and nightside\ntemperature. \n\n"}

CM-like asteroids (Ch and Cgh classes) are a major population within\nthe broader C-complex, encompassing about 10% of the mass of the main asteroid\nbelt. Their internal structure has been predicted to be homogeneous, based on\ntheir compositional similarity as inferred from spectroscopy (Vernazza et al.,\n2016, AJ 152, 154) and numerical modeling of their early thermal evolution\n(Bland & Travis, 2017, Sci. Adv. 3, e1602514). Aims. Here we aim to test this\nhypothesis by deriving the density of the CM-like asteroid (41) Daphne from\ndetailed modeling of its shape and the orbit of its small satellite. Methods.\nWe observed Daphne and its satellite within our imaging survey with the Very\nLarge Telescope extreme adaptive-optics SPHERE/ZIMPOL camera (ID 199.C-0074, PI\nP. Vernazza) and complemented this data set with earlier Keck/NIRC2 and\nVLT/NACO observations. We analyzed the dynamics of the satellite with our\nGenoid meta-heuristic algorithm. Combining our high-angular resolution images\nwith optical lightcurves and stellar occultations, we determine the spin\nperiod, orientation, and 3-D shape, using our ADAM shape modeling algorithm.\nResults. The satellite orbits Daphne on an equatorial, quasi-circular, prograde\norbit, like the satellites of many other large main-belt asteroids. The shape\nmodel of Daphne reveals several large flat areas that could be large impact\ncraters. The mass determined from this orbit combined with the volume computed\nfrom the shape model implies a density for Daphne of 1.77+/-0.26 g/cm3 (3\n{\\sigma}). This density is consistent with a primordial CM-like homogeneous\ninternal structure with some level of macroporosity (~17%). Conclusions. Based\non our analysis of the density of Daphne and 75 other Ch/Cgh-type asteroids\ngathered from the literature, we conclude that the primordial internal\nstructure of the CM parent bodies was homogeneous. \n\n"}

We have optimized TLS for both signal\ndetection efficiency (SDE) of small planets and computational speed. TLS\nanalyses the entire, unbinned phase-folded light curve.

We present the\nfirst CO detection in a planetesimal belt around an M star, TWA 7. The\noptically thin CO (J=3-2) emission is co-located with previously identified\ndust emission from the belt, and the emission velocity structure is consistent\nwith Keplerian rotation around the central star. The detected CO is not well\nshielded against photodissociation, and must thus be continuously replenished\nby gas release from exocomets within the belt. We analyze in detail the process\nof exocometary gas release and destruction around young M dwarfs and how this\nprocess compares to earlier type stars. Taking these differences into account,\nwe find that CO generation through exocometary gas release naturally explains\nthe increasing CO detection rates with stellar luminosity, mostly because the\nCO production rate from the collisional cascade is directly proportional to\nstellar luminosity. More luminous stars will therefore on average host more\nmassive (and hence more easily detectable) exocometary CO disks, leading to the\nhigher detection rates observed.

Here we study the signature of co-orbital exoplanets in transit surveys\nwhen two planet candidates in the system orbit the star with similar periods.\nSuch pair of candidates could be discarded as false positives because they are\nnot Hill-stable. However, horseshoe or long libration period tadpole co-orbital\nconfigurations can explain such period similarity. This degeneracy can be\nsolved by considering the Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) of each planet. We\nthen focus on the three planet candidates system TOI-178: the two outer\ncandidates of that system have similar orbital period and had an angular\nseparation near $\\pi/3$ during the TESS observation of sector 2. Based on the\nannounced orbits, the long-term stability of the system requires the two\nclose-period planets to be co-orbitals. Our independent detrending and transit\nsearch recover and slightly favour the three orbits close to a 3:2:2 resonant\nchain found by the TESS pipeline, although we cannot exclude an alias that\nwould put the system close to a 4:3:2 configuration.

For such a braneworld cosmology, the difficulty of\njustifying some preferred initial conditions inevitably arises. The various\nproposals for inflation restricted to the brane only partially explain the\nhomogeneity and isotropy of the resulting braneworld universe because the\nhomogeneity and isotropy of the bulk must be assumed.

{"id": "hep-th/9912166", "contents": "Title: Puncture of gravitating domain walls Abstract: We investigate the semi-classical instability of vacuum domain walls to\nprocesses where the domain walls decay by the formation of closed string loop\nboundaries on their worldvolumes. Intuitively, a wall which is initially\nspherical may `pop', so that a hole corresponding to a string boundary\ncomponent on the wall, may form. We find instantons, and calculate the rates,\nfor such processes. We show that after puncture, the hole grows exponentially\nat the same rate that the wall expands. It follows that the wall is never\ncompletely thermalized by a single expanding hole; at arbitrarily late times\nthere is still a large, thin shell of matter which may drive an exponential\nexpansion of the universe. We also study the situation where the wall is\nsubjected to multiple punctures. We find that in order to completely annihilate\nthe wall by this process, at least four string loops must be nucleated. We\nargue that this process may be relevant in certain brane-world scenarios, where\nthe universe itself is a domain wall. \n\n"}

In particular, we\nrecover for $l=3$ the non-rotating massive BTZ black hole. The method presented\nhere is very simple and in principle generalizable to any semi-simple symmetric\nspace. \n\n"}
