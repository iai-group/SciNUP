Of the many possibilities, three experiments are\ndescribed here that are clearly feasible and of high scientific importance.\nFirst, a direct measurement of the saturation scale is possible using the\nbroadening of the transverse momentum distribution of hadrons produced in\nsemi-inclusive DIS. This connection to saturation physics will provide a\nquantitative measure of the degree to which this fundamental QCD phenomenon is\noccurring, and has important consequences in other high-energy scattering\nstudies. Second, the measurement of quark energy loss is feasible, either as a\ndirect measurement at a lower-energy EIC, or as an indirect measurement using\nhadron attenuation at higher energies. Such a measurement will offer the first\nexperimental validation of the energy independence of this process, which is a\nconsequence of the QCD analog of the LPM effect in QED. The third experiment is\nto determine the mechanisms of hadronization using the nucleus as a spatial\nanalyzer, intercomparing hadron attenuation for nuclei of a range of sizes. The\nextended reach of the EIC in energy will allow probes of these mechanisms in\nthe crucial high-z region for the heaviest nuclei, and will permit study of\nhadronization in heavy quark meson and baryon systems. \n\n"}

It has been considered that the\nLambda(1405) resonance is generated by the attractive interaction of the\nantikaon and the nucleon, as a quasi-bound state below the threshold decaying\ninto the pi Sigma channel. Thus, the structure of Lambda(1405) is closely\nrelated to the Kbar N interaction which is the fundamental ingredient to study\nfew-body systems with antikaon. In this paper, after reviewing the basic\nproperties of the Lambda(1405) resonance, we introduce the dynamical\ncoupled-channel model which respects chiral symmetry of QCD and the unitarity\nof the scattering amplitude. We show that the structure of the Lambda(1405)\nresonance is dominated by the meson-baryon molecule component and is described\nas a superposition of two independent states. The meson-baryon nature of\nLambda(1405) leads to various hadronic molecule states in few-body systems with\nstrangeness which are hadron composite systems driven by the hadronic\ninteractions.

We argue that the low energy relations representing the\nquantum anomalies of QCD are saturated by coherent low dimensional vacuum\nconfigurations as observed in Monte Carlo lattice studies. The thermal spectrum\nand approximate universality of the temperature with no dependence on energy of\ncolliding particles in this framework is due to the fact that the emission\nresults from the distortion of these low dimensional vacuum sheets rather than\nfrom the colliding particles themselves. The emergence of the long- range\ncorrelations of P odd domains (a feature which is apparently required for\nexplanation of the asymmetry observed at RHIC and LHC) is also a result of the\nsame distortion of the QCD vacuum configurations.

However, the SM fails to explain the non-visible but\ngravitationally active part of the universe.

Therefore dark energy must possess a\nscreening mechanism which suppresses the scalar-mediated fifth force. Our line\nof attack is a novel gravity experiment with neutrons based on a quantum\ninterference technique. The spectroscopic measurement of quantum states on\nresonances with an external coupling makes this a powerful search for dark\nmatter and dark energy contributions in the universe. Quantum states in the\ngravity potential are intimately related to other scalar field or spin-0-bosons\nif they exist.

For the analysis we employ three different transport models - the\nmicroscopic off-shell Hadron-String-Dynamics (HSD) transport approach, the\nIsospin Quantum Molecular Dynamics (IQMD) approach as well as the\nUltra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) approach. We confirm the\nexperimentally observed enhancement of the dilepton yield (normalized to the\nmultiplicity of neutral pions $N_{\\pi^0}$) in heavy-ion collisions with respect\nto that measured in $NN = (pp+pn)/2$ collisions. We identify two contributions\nto this enhancement: a) the $pN$ bremsstrahlung which scales with the number of\ncollisions and not with the number of participants, i.e. pions; b) the dilepton\nemission from intermediate $\\Delta$'s which are part of the reaction cycles\n$\\Delta \\to \\pi N ; \\pi N \\to \\Delta$ and $NN\\to N\\Delta; N\\Delta \\to NN$. With\nincreasing system size more generations of intermediate $\\Delta$'s are created.\nIf such $\\Delta$ decays into a pion, the pion can be reabsorbed, however, if it\ndecays into a dilepton, the dilepton escapes from the system. Thus,\nexperimentally one observes only one pion (from the last produced $\\Delta$)\nwhereas the dilepton yield accumulates the contributions from all $\\Delta$'s of\nthe cycle. We show as well that the Fermi motion enhances the production of\npions and dileptons in the same way.

For this purpose a large data set of hydrogen cluster\nvelocity distributions and mean velocities was measured at a high density\nhydrogen cluster jet target using a trumpet shaped nozzle.

Momentum degradation of the hard and semihard partons as they traverse\nthe inhomogeneous medium at various azimuthal angles results in a complicated\nconvolution of geometrical, nuclear and dynamical factors that cannot usually\nbe described in a transparent way. In this work a compact formula is found that\nrepresents the inclusive distributions of minijets of any parton type at the\nsurface of the medium for any collision centrality. They take into account the\ncontributions from all initiating partons created at any point in the medium.\nBy comparing with the case of no energy loss, a ratio has been determined that\nis analogous to the nuclear modification factor for minijets. Phenomenological\nreality of such distributions is examined by calculating the hadronization of\nthe minijets in the recombination model. Good fits of the data on pion, kaon\nand proton production throughout the intermediate \\ppt\\ region have been\nobtained by adjusting the parameters controlling the magnitude of the thermal\npartons and the degradation rates of the semihard partons.

An important property made manifest\nin this study is that quarks and gluons must not lose energy in the same way\nbecause the partons form mesons and baryons differently by recombination and\nthe momenta of quarks and gluons must be degraded at different rates in order\nto reproduce the experimental pion and proton spectra.

This paper explores the correlations among harmonic flow\ncoefficients $v_n$ and their phases $\\Phi_n$, and the rapidity fluctuation of\n$v_n$. The study is carried out usin Pb+Pb events generated by the AMPT model\nwith fixed impact parameter. The overall ellipticity/triangularity of events is\nvaried by selecting on the eccentricities $\\epsilon_n$ or the magnitudes of the\nflow vector $q_n$ for n=2 and 3, respectively. The responses of the $v_n$, the\nevent-plane correlations, and the rapidity fluctuations, to the change in\n$\\epsilon_n$ and $q_n$ are then systematized. Strong positive correlations are\nobserved among all even harmonics $v_2, v_4$, and $v_6$ (all increase with\n$q_2$), between $v_2$ and $v_5$ (both increase with $q_2$) and between $v_3$\nand $v_5$ (both increase with $q_3$), consistent with the effects of nonlinear\ncollective response. In contrast, an anti-correlation is observed between $v_2$\nand $v_3$ similar to that seen between $\\epsilon_2$ and $\\epsilon_3$. These\ncorrelation patterns are found to be independent of whether selecting on $q_n$\nor $\\epsilon_n$, validating the ability of $q_n$ in selecting the initial\ngeometry. A forward/backward asymmetry of $v_n(\\eta)$ is observed for events\nselected on $q_n$ but not on $\\epsilon_n$, reflecting dynamical fluctuations\nexposed by the $q_n$ selection. Many event-plane correlators show good\nagreement between $q_n$ and $\\epsilon_n$ selections, suggesting that their\nvariations with $q_n$ are controlled by the change of $\\epsilon_n$ in the\ninitial geometry. Hence these correlators may serve as promising observables\nfor disentangling the fluctuations generated in various stages of the evolution\nof the matter created in heavy ion collisions. \n\n"}

We propose a\ncontrol set of experiments to directly compare particle emission patterns from\np+Au, d+Au, and He3+Au or t+Au collisions at the same sqrt(sNN). Using Monte\nCarlo Glauber we find that a He3 or triton projectile, with a realistic\nwavefunction description, induces a significant intrinsic triangular shape to\nthe initial medium and that, even with viscous damping, this survives into a\nsignificant third order flow moment v3. By comparing systems with one, two, and\nthree initial hot spots, one can disentangle the effects from the initial\nspatial distribution of the deposited energy and viscous damping. These are key\ntools to answering the question of how small a droplet of matter is necessary\nto form a quark-gluon plasma described by nearly inviscid hydrodynamics. \n\n"}

The evolution of bulk medium used in the study for parton\npropagation was given by 2+1D or 3+1D hydrodynamic models which are also\nconstrained by experimental data on bulk hadron spectra.

We propose a simple parametrization for the probability\ndistribution of the Fourier coefficient $\\varepsilon_n$ in harmonic $n$, which\nis in good agreement with Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results provide a simple\nexplanation for the 4-particle cumulant of triangular flow measured in Pb-Pb\ncollisions, and for the 4-particle cumulant of elliptic flow recently measured\nin p-Pb collisions.

The simulations are performed within a three-fluid\nmodel employing three different equations of state (EoS's): a purely hadronic\nEoS and two versions of the EoS involving the deconfinement transition---a\nfirst-order phase transition and a smooth crossover one. The present\nsimulations demonstrate low sensitivity of $v_2$(charged) to the EoS. All\nconsidered scenarios equally well reproduce recent STAR data on $v_2$(charged)\nfor mid-central Au+Au collisions and properly describe its change of sign at\nthe incident energy decrease below $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\approx$ 3.5 GeV. The\npredicted integrated elliptic flow of various species exhibits a stronger\ndependence on the EoS.

Our best estimate for the chiral transition temperature is\nT_c=(147 +/- 8)MeV; and the deconfinement transition is coincident. For\ntemperatures markedly above T_c, we find a spectral density that is consistent\nwith those produced using a hard thermal loop expansion, exhibiting both a\nnormal and plasmino mode. On a domain T\\in[T_c,T_s], with T_s approximately\n1.5T_c, however, with each of the six kernels we considered, the spectral\nfunction contains a significant additional feature. Namely, it displays a third\npeak, associated with a zero mode, which is essentially nonperturbative in\norigin and dominates the spectral function at T=T_c. We suggest that the\nexistence of this mode is a signal for the formation of a strongly-coupled\nquark-gluon plasma and that this strongly-interacting state of matter is likely\na distinctive feature of the QCD phase transition. \n\n"}

At intermediate impact parameters the slope\nparameter of the directed flow versus rapidity (dv1/dy) for the net-protons\nshows a non-monotonic variation as a function of the beam energy. This\nnon-monotonic variation is characterized by the presence of a minimum in dv1/dy\nbetween 11.5 and 19.6 GeV and a change in the sign of dv1/dy twice between 7.7\nand 39 GeV.

There is little systematic knowledge of the contribution\nof collective excitations to the interaction between nuclei, particularly in\nthe overlap region of heavy nuclei.\n  Purpose: To study the dynamic polarization potential (DPP) generated by\nchannel coupling that had been validated for a case where scattering is\nsensitive to the nuclear potential over a wide radial range; to exhibit\nevidence of the non-locality due to collective coupling; to validate, or\notherwise, the representation of DPPs by uniform renormalization of potentials.\n  Methods: S-matrix to potential inversion yields local potentials reproducing\nthe elastic channel S-matrix of coupled channel calculations. Subtracting the\nelastic channel uncoupled potential yields a local L-independent representation\nof the DPP. The dependence of the DPP on the nature of the coupled states and\nother parameters can be studied.\n  Results: Local DPPs were found due to the excitation of C-12 and the combined\nexcitation of O-16 and C-12. The radial forms found were very different from\nuniform renormalization of the potential. Full coupling led to a 10 percent\nincrease in the volume integral of the real potential. Evidence for the\nnon-locality of the underlying formal DPP and the effect of direct coupling\nbetween the collective states is found.\n  Conclusions: The local DPP generating the secondary rainbow is found. DPPs\nhave forms depending on the specific excitations and cannot be represented by a\nuniform renormalization of the potential. The method is useful for study of the\ncontribution of collective excitations to internuclear potentials, concerning\nwhich remarkably little is known in general. \n\n"}

They also appear in\nobservables describing the semi-inclusive production of two hadrons in\ndeep-inelastic scattering of leptons off nucleons or in hadron-hadron\ncollisions. When a target nucleon is transversely polarized, a specific\nchiral-odd di-hadron fragmentation function can be used as the analyzer of the\nnet density of transversely polarized quarks in a transversely polarized\nnucleon, the so-called transversity distribution. The latter can be extracted\nthrough suitable single-spin asymmetries in the framework of collinear\nfactorization, thus in a much simpler framework with respect to the traditional\none in single-hadron fragmentation.

Recent\nterrestrial experiments constrain both its value and slope at nuclear\nsaturation density, however, its value at higher densities is unknown. Assuming\na Free Fermi-gas (FFG) model for the kinetic symmetry energy, the high-density\nextrapolation depends on a single parameter, the density dependence of the\npotential symmetry energy. The Correlated Fermi-gas (CFG) model improves on the\nFFG model by including the effects of short-range, correlated, high-momentum,\nnucleons in nuclear matter. Using the CFG model for the kinetic symmetry energy\nalong with constraints from terrestrial measurements leads to a much softer\ndensity dependence for the potential symmetry energy. Purpose: Examine the\nability of the FFG and CFG models to describe NS observables that are directly\nsensitive to the symmetry energy at high-density. Specifically, examine the\nability of the CFG model, with its softer density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy, to describe a two solar-mass NS. Methods: Using a Bayesian\nanalysis of NS observables we compare the CFG and FFG models and examine the\nresulting parameters in the NS EOS and the density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy. Results: Despite the large difference in the density\ndependence of the potential part of the symmetry energy, both models can\ndescribe the NS data and support a two solar-mass NS. The different density\ndependences has only a small effect on the NS EOS. Conclusions: While sensitive\nto the high-density values of the symmetry energy, NS observables alone are not\nenough to distinguish between the CFG and FFG models. This indicates that the\nNS EOS, obtain from Bayesian analysis of NS observables, is robust and is not\nsensitive to the exact nuclear model used for the kinetic symmetry energy. \n\n"}

As\nregards the large spikes in the magnetic field which can be expected at, for\nexample, joints in the magnetic shielding of the propagation region (despite\ncompensating currents and magnetic idealization of the shield), we demonstrate\nthat their effect scales as $l/D^{3/2}$, where $D$ is the diameter of the\ncylindrical magnetic shielding.

Here, we introduce a model that is\nbased on the QCD theory of multi-parton interactions and that allows one to\nstudy interference effects in the production of $m$ particles in hadronic\ncollisions with $N$ parton-parton interactions (\"sources\"). In an expansion in\npowers of $1/(N_c^2-1)$ and to leading order in the number of sources $N$, we\ncalculate interference effects in the $m$-particle spectra and we determine\nfrom them the second and fourth order cumulant momentum anisotropies $v_n$.\nWithout invoking any azimuthal asymmetry and any density dependent non-linear\ndynamics in the incoming state, and without invoking any interaction in the\nfinal state, we find that QCD interference alone can give rise to values for\n$v_n\\lbrace 2\\rbrace$ and $v_n\\lbrace 4\\rbrace$, $n$ even, that persist\nunattenuated for increasing number of sources, that may increase with\nincreasing multiplicity and that agree with measurements in proton-proton (pp)\ncollisions in terms of the order of magnitude of the signal and the approximate\nshape of the transverse momentum dependence.

Such analyses predict the\npresence of nonpointlike, electromagnetically-active quark-quark (diquark)\ncorrelations within all baryons; and in these doublets, isoscalar-scalar,\nisovector-pseudovector, isoscalar-pseudoscalar, and vector diquarks can all\nplay a role. In the two lightest $(1/2,1/2^+)$ doublets, however, scalar and\npseudovector diquarks are overwhelmingly dominant. The associated rest-frame\nwave functions are largely $S$-wave in nature; and the first excited state in\nthis $1/2^+$ channel has the appearance of a radial excitation of the ground\nstate. The two lightest $(1/2,1/2^-)$ doublets fit a different picture:\naccurate estimates of their masses are obtained by retaining only pseudovector\ndiquarks; in their rest frames, the amplitudes describing their dressed-quark\ncores contain roughly equal fractions of even- and odd-parity diquarks; and the\nassociated wave functions are predominantly $P$-wave in nature, but possess\nmeasurable $S$-wave components. Moreover, the first excited state in each\nnegative-parity channel has little of the appearance of a radial excitation. In\nquantum field theory, all differences between positive- and negative-parity\nchannels must owe to chiral symmetry breaking, which is overwhelmingly\ndynamical in the light-quark sector. Consequently, experiments that can\nvalidate the contrasts drawn herein between the structure of the four lightest\n$(1/2,1/2^\\pm)$ doublets will prove valuable in testing links between emergent\nmass generation and observable phenomena and, plausibly, thereby revealing\ndynamical features of confinement. \n\n"}

Also the UCN\ntransparency of the bulk sD_2 material must be high because crystal\ninhomogeneities limit the mean free path for elastic scattering and reduce the\nextraction efficiency. Observations at the UCN sources at Paul Scherrer\nInstitute and at Los Alamos National Laboratory consistently show a decrease of\nthe UCN yield with time of operation after initial preparation or later\ntreatment (`conditioning') of the sD_2. We show that, in addition to the\nquality of the bulk sD_2, the quality of its surface is essential.

For the latter, the determination of the\ncharge radius involves an extrapolation of the experimental form factor to zero\nmomentum transfer.\n  Purpose: To estimate the proton radius by introducing a novel non-parametric\napproach to model the electric form factor of the proton.\n  Methods: Within a Bayesian paradigm, we develop a model flexible enough to\nfit the data without any parametric assumptions on the form factor. The\nBayesian estimation is guided by imposing only two physical constraints on the\nform factor: (a) its value at zero momentum transfer (normalization) and (b)\nits overall shape, assumed to be a monotonically decreasing function of the\nmomentum transfer. Variants of these assumptions are explored to assess the\nimpact of these constraints.\n  Results: So far our results are inconclusive in regard to the proton puzzle,\nas they depend on both, the assumed constrains and the range of experimental\ndata used. For example, if only low momentum-transfer data is used, adopting\nonly the normalization constraint provides a value compatible with the smaller\nmuonic result, while imposing only the shape constraint favors the larger\nelectronic value.\n  Conclusions: We have presented a novel technique to estimate the proton\nradius from electron scattering data based on a non-parametric Gaussian\nprocess.

Some examples\nare strongly interacting medium and heavy mass atomic nuclei and mesoscopic\ncondensed matter systems. In this approach, the linear Schrodinger equation for\nthe exact many-body wave function is mapped onto a non-linear density-dependent\none-body potential problem. This approximation, not only provides\ncomputationally very simple solutions even for systems with many particles, but\ndue to the non-linearity, it also allows for obtaining solutions that break\nessential symmetries of the system, often connected with phase transitions. In\nthis way, additional correlations are subsumed in the system. However, the\nmean-field approach suffers from the drawback that the corresponding wave\nfunctions do not have sharp quantum numbers and, therefore, many results cannot\nbe compared directly with experimental data.

We find that the property with the biggest effect on the required\nexposure is the measurement of the momentum vector sense. If the detector\ncannot determine the recoil sense, the exposure required is increased by an\norder of magnitude for 3-d read-out and two orders of magnitude for 2-d\nread-out. For 2-d read-out the required exposure, in particular if the senses\ncan not be measured, can be significantly reduced by analyzing the reduced\nangles with the, time dependent, projected direction of solar motion\nsubtracted. The background rate effectively places a lower limit on the WIMP\ncross-section to which the detector is sensitive; it will be very difficult to\ndetect WIMPs with a signal rate more than an order of magnitude below the\nbackground rate. Lowering the energy threshold also reduces the required\nexposure, but only for thresholds above 20 keV. \n\n"}

We propose that the ratio of multiplicities of such\nexcited states to the respective $L = 0$ states can serve as an almost model\nindependent signal for the quark-gluon plasma formation in relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions. For example, the ratio $R^*$ of multiplicities of\n$D_{SJ}^{*\\pm}(2317)(J^P = 0^+)$ and $D_S^{*\\pm}(2112)(J^P = 1^-)$ when plotted\nwith respect to the center of mass energy of the collision $\\sqrt{s}$ (or vs.\ncentrality/number of participants), should show a jump at the value of\n$\\sqrt{s}$ beyond which the QGP formation occurs.

The reaction is characterized by a high\ndegree of transparency of the collisions partners leading to the formation of a\nbaryon-poor central region.
