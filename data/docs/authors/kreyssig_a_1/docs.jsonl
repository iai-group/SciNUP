The main result of this part of the work is a model\nof the Green's function that is later used for calculating the two-particle\nexcitation spectrum. Then, the matrix element effects in the photoemission\nspectra of cuprates are discussed with a focus on the recently discovered\nanomalous behavior of the ARPES spectra that partially originates from the\nmomentum-dependent photoemission matrix element. The momentum- and excitation\nenergy dependence of the anomalous high-energy dispersion, termed \"waterfalls\",\nis covered in full detail. Finally, the work describes the relation of ARPES\nwith other experimental methods, such as INS spectroscopy. For the optimally\ndoped bilayer Bi-based cuprate, the renormalized two-particle correlation\nfunction in the superconducting state is calculated from ARPES data within an\nitinerant model based on the random phase approximation (RPA).

While the shape of the Fermi surface (FS) obtained with the\nlocal density approximation (LDA) can be reproduced by a two-orbital model, it\nhas been argued that the bands that cross the chemical potential result from\nthe strong hybridization of three of the Fe 3d orbitals. For this reason, a\nthree-orbital Hamiltonian obtained with the Slater-Koster formalism by\nconsidering the hybridization of the As p orbitals with the Fe d_xz,d_yz, and\nd_xy orbitals is discussed here. This model reproduces qualitatively the FS\nshape and orbital composition obtained by LDA calculations for undoped\npnictides when four electrons per Fe are considered.

To present a unified\nexplanation for them, we analyze the multiorbital Hubbard-Holstein model with\nFe-ion optical phonons based on the orbital fluctuation theory. In the\nrandom-phase-approximation (RPA), a small electron-phonon coupling constant\n($\\lambda ~ 0.2$) is enough to produce large orbital (=charge quadrupole)\nfluctuations. The most divergent susceptibility is the\n$O_{xz}$-antiferro-quadrupole (AFQ) susceptibility, which causes the s-wave\nsuperconductivity without sign reversal (s_{++}-wave state). At the same time,\ndivergent development of $O_{x2-y2}$-ferro-quadrupole (FQ) susceptibility is\nbrought by the \"two-orbiton process\" with respect to the AFQ fluctuations,\nwhich is absent in the RPA. The derived FQ fluctuations cause the softening of\n$C_{66}$ shear modulus, and its long-range-order not only triggers the\northorhombic structure transition, but also induces the instability of\nstripe-type antiferro-magnetic state.

To this purpose, we implement the\nconstrained random phase approximation (cRPA) into a density functional code\nwithin the linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW) framework.\n  We apply our approach to the 3d and 4d early transition metal oxides SrMO3\n(M=V, Cr, Mn) and (M=Nb, Mo, Tc) in their paramagnetic phases. For these\nsystems, we explicitly assess the differences between two physically motivated\nlow-energy Hamiltonians: The first is the three-orbital model comprising the\nt2g states only, that is often used for early transition metal oxides. The\nsecond choice is a model where both, metal d- and oxygen p-states are retained\nin the construction of Wannier functions, but the Hubbard interactions are\napplied to the d-states only (\"d-dp Hamiltonian\").

It is noted that\nphysical systems being appropriately described by the TB model can exhibit the\nmain strongly correlated electron system (SCES) properties, when they are\nsolved in the HF approximation, by also allowing crystal symmetry breaking\neffects and non-collinear spin orientations of the HF orbitals.

The local moments carried by Mn impurities doped into\nBa(Fe1-xCox)2As2(Co-122) and BaFe(As1-xPx)2(P-122) at optimal doping induce a\nspin polarization in the vicinity of the impurity.

While all the nucleated phases are\nstable with respect to weak perturbations of each kind, strong perturbations\nare found to result in very different behavior. Anisotropy of the vortices\nstabilizes the strong-pairing like phases, while dimerization can recover the\nunderlying non-Abelian phase. Local random disorder, on the other hand, can\ndrive all the nucleated phases into a gapless thermal metal state.

We argue\nthat for a generic doping in this range, superconductivity at weak coupling is\nof Kohn-Luttinger type, and, due to the presence of electronic interactions\nbeyond on-site repulsion, is a threshold phenomenon, with superconductivity\nemerging only if the attraction generated by the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism\nexceeds the bare repulsion in some channel. For disconnected Fermi pockets, we\npredict that Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity, if it occurs, is likely to be\n$f$-wave. While the Kohn-Luttinger analysis is adequate over most of the doping\nrange, a more sophisticated analysis is needed near Van Hove doping. We treat\nVan Hove doping using a parquet renormalization group, the equations for which\nwe derive and analyze. Near this doping level, superconductivity is a universal\nphenomenon, arising from any choice of bare repulsive interactions. The\nstrongest pairing instability is into a chiral $d-$wave state ($d+id$). At a\ntruly weak coupling, the strongest competitor is a spin-density-wave\ninstability, however, $d-$wave superconductivity still wins. Moreover, the\nfeedback of the spin density fluctuations into the Cooper channel significantly\nenhances the critical temperature over the estimates of the Kohn Luttinger\ntheory. We analyze renormalization group equations at stronger couplings and\nfind that the main competitor to $d-$wave supoerconductivity away from weak\ncoupling is actually ferromagnetism.

In this context, we address the underdoped cuprates.\nOur premise is that just as Fermi liquid theory is failing above Tc, BCS theory\nis failing below.

We solve the linearized Eliashberg\nequation by taking into account the full momentum-frequency dependence of the\norder parameter for the spin-triplet and the spin-singlet states, and estimate\nthe transition temperature as a function of the Coulomb integrals. The\neffective pairing interaction is expanded perturbatively with respect to the\nCoulomb interaction at the Ru sites up to the third order. As a result, we show\nthat the spin-triplet p-wave state is more stable than the spin-singlet d-wave\nstate for moderately strong Coulomb interaction. Our results suggest that one\nof the three bands, $\\gamma$, plays a dominant role in the superconducting\ntransition, and the pairing on the other two bands($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$) is\ninduced passively through the inter-orbit couplings.

It is argued that strong electronic correlations in conjunction with\nthe pronounced (in relatively weakly screened materials) EPI are unavoidable\ningredients for the microscopic theory of pairing in HTSC oxides. I present the\nwell defined and controllable theory of strong correlations and the EPI. It is\nshown that strong correlations give rise to the pronounced \\textit{forward\nscattering peak} in the EPI - the FSP theory. The FSP theory explains in a\nconsistent way several (crucial) puzzles such as much smaller transport\ncoupling constant than the pairing one ($\\lambda_{tr}\\ll \\lambda$), which are\npresent if one interprets the results in HTSC oxides by the old\nMigdal-Eliashberg theory for the EPI. The ARPES shift puzzle where the nodal\nkink at 70 meV is unshifted in the superconducting state, while the anti-nodal\none at 40 meV is shifted can be explained at present only by the FSP theory. A\nnumber of other interesting predictions of the FSP theory are also discussed. \n\n"}

In addition, its gap function possesses deep\npoint minima, whose ratio of the gap anisotropy is more than 10. On the\ntheoretical side, however, it is nontrivial to understand the origin of such a\npeculiar superconductivity. In the present paper, we propose a mechanism of the\ns-wave superconductivity with deep gap minima, based on the theoretical model\nwhere strong electron-phonon coupling as well as the moderate magnetic\nfluctuations coexist. By analyzing the strong coupling Eliashberg equation, we\nfind that s-wave superconducting gap function owing to the electron-phonon\ncoupling becomes highly anisotropic as the magnetic fluctuations increases. The\nset of model parameters for realizing the strong gap anisotropy in the present\nmodel will be appropriate for (Y,Lu)Ni$_2$B$_2$C.
