In\nparticular, it was shown that the classifying space (order complex) of the face\nposet of a totally normal regular cellular stratified space $X$ can be embedded\nin $X$ as a strong deformation retract.\n  Here we elaborate on this idea and develop the theory of cellular stratified\nspaces.

The definitions of\n$\\epsilon$-interleavings and $d_I$ generalize readily to multidimensional\npersistence modules. In this paper, we develop the theory of multidimensional\ninterleavings, with a view towards applications to topological data analysis.\nWe present four main results. First, we show that on 1-D persistence modules,\n$d_I$ is equal to the bottleneck distance $d_B$. This result, which first\nappeared in an earlier preprint of this paper, has since appeared in several\nother places, and is now known as the isometry theorem. Second, we present a\ncharacterization of the $\\epsilon$-interleaving relation on multidimensional\npersistence modules. This expresses transparently the sense in which two\n$\\epsilon$-interleaved modules are algebraically similar. Third, using this\ncharacterization, we show that when we define our persistence modules over a\nprime field, $d_I$ satisfies a universality property. This universality result\nis the central result of the paper. It says that $d_I$ satisfies a stability\nproperty generalizing one which $d_B$ is known to satisfy, and that in\naddition, if $d$ is any other pseudometric on multidimensional persistence\nmodules satisfying the same stability property, then $d\\leq d_I$.

To each three-component\nlink in Euclidean 3-space, we associate a geometrically natural generalized\nGauss map from the 3-torus to the 2-sphere, and show that the pairwise linking\nnumbers and Milnor triple linking number that classify the link up to link\nhomotopy correspond to the Pontryagin invariants that classify its generalized\nGauss map up to homotopy. This can be viewed as a natural extension of the\nfamiliar fact that the linking number of a two-component link in 3-space is the\ndegree of its associated Gauss map from the 2-torus to the 2-sphere. When the\npairwise linking numbers are all zero, we give an integral formula for the\ntriple linking number analogous to the Gauss integral for the pairwise linking\nnumbers, but patterned after J.H.C.

An explicit construction of Henriques\nproduces certain Lie $\\infty$-groupoids called `Lie $\\infty$-groups' by\nintegrating finite type Lie $n$-algebras. In order to study the compatibility\nbetween this integration procedure and the homotopy theory of Lie $n$-algebras\nintroduced in the companion paper arXiv:1809.05999, we present a homotopy\ntheory for Lie $\\infty$-groupoids. Unlike Kan simplicial sets and the higher\ngeometric groupoids of Behrend and Getzler, Lie $\\infty$-groupoids do not form\na category of fibrant objects (CFO), since the category of manifolds lacks\npullbacks. Instead, we show that Lie $\\infty$-groupoids form an `incomplete\ncategory of fibrant objects' in which the weak equivalences correspond to\n`stalkwise' weak equivalences of simplicial sheaves. This homotopical structure\nenjoys many of the same properties as a CFO, such as having, in the presence of\nfunctorial path objects, a convenient realization of its simplicial\nlocalization.

As the base case, we take RP(-1) to be the empty\ntype. In the inductive step, we take RP(n+1) to be the mapping cone of the\nprojection map of the tautological bundle of RP(n), and we use its universal\nproperty and the univalence axiom to define the tautological bundle on RP(n+1).\n  By showing that the total space of the tautological bundle of RP(n) is the\nn-sphere, we retrieve the classical description of RP(n+1) as RP(n) with an\n(n+1)-cell attached to it.

A central notion of\nnoncommutative ring theory related to Morita equivalence is that of central\nseparable or Azumaya algebras.

Using the model of Gromov-Witten theory, with this moduli\nspace replacing the space of stable holomorphic curves in a symplectic\nmanifold, we obtain invariants, which are (co)homology operations in M.
