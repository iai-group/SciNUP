The second paradox is a clear\nsignature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments, but no\nevidence as yet of the corresponding hole pockets of approximately double the\nfrequency of the electron pocket. This hole pockets should be present if the\nFermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave, assuming\nthat Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number\nof charge carriers holds. Here we provide possible resolutions of these\napparent paradoxes from the commensurate $d$-density wave theory. To address\nthe first paradox we have computed the ARPES spectral function subject to\ncorrelated disorder, natural to a class of experiments relevant to the\nmaterials studied in quantum oscillations. The intensity of the spectral\nfunction is significantly reduced for the electron pockets for an intermediate\nrange of disorder correlation length, and typically less than half the hole\npocket is visible, mimicking Fermi arcs. Next we show from an exact transfer\nmatrix calculation of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation that the usual disorder\naffects the electron pocket more significantly than the hole pocket. However,\nwhen, in addition, the scattering from vortices in the mixed state is included,\nit wipes out the frequency corresponding to the hole pocket.

In fact\nPt-substitution is detrimental to higher Tc, which increases up to 38 K only by\ncharge doping of pure FeAs layers. We point out, that two different negatively\ncharged layers [(FeAs)10]n- and (Pt3+yAs8)m- compete for the electrons provided\nby the Ca2+ ions, which is unique in the field of iron-based superconductors.\nIn the parent compound Ca10(FeAs)10(Pt3As8), no excess charge dopes the\nFeAs-layer, and superconductivity has to be induced by Pt-substitution, albeit\nbelow 15 K. In contrast, the additional Pt-atom in the Pt4As8layer shifts the\ncharge balance between the layers equivalent to charge doping by 0.2 electrons\nper FeAs. Only in this case Tc raises to 38 K, but decreases again if\nadditionally platinum is substituted for iron. This charge doping scenario is\nsupported by our discovery of superconductivity at 30 K in the electron-doped\nLa-1038 compound (Ca0.8La0.2)10(FeAs)10(Pt3As8) without significant\nPt-substitution. \n\n"}

Neutron scattering and\ncomplementary techniques have determined the extent to which antiferromagnetic\nspin correlations survive in the cuprate superconductors.

The mechanism behind that resides in the\nstructural incompatibility of two stereo-chemical configurations Cu$^{\\rm\nII}$O$_4$ and Cu$^{\\rm III}$O$_4$ which compose the CuO$_2$ planes. It leads to\nspontaneously fluctuating Cu - O - Cu valence bonds which establish a local\nFeshbach resonance exchange coupling between bound and unbound electron pairs.\nThe coupling, being the only free parameter in this scenario, the hole doping\nof the parent state is monitored by varying the total number of unpaired and\npaired electrons, in chemical equilibrium with each other.

Compared to the iron pnictides,\nthese systems have only electron Fermi pockets (i.e. no hole Fermi pockets) but\ncomparable superconducting transition temperatures. The challenge lies in\nreconciling the two basic experimental features of their superconducting state:\na node-less gap and the existence of a resonance in the spin excitation\nspectrum. We propose a mechanism based on reconstructing two quasi-degenerate\npairing states, one in an $s$-wave $A_{1g}$ channel that is fully gapped, and\nthe other in a $d$-wave $B_{1g}$ channel whose pairing function changes sign\nacross the electron Fermi pockets at the Brillouin-zone boundary. The resulting\nintermediate pairing state, which we call an orbital-selective $s \\times\n\\tau_3$ state, incorporates both of the above two properties. When the leading\nspin-singlet pairing is in the $d_{xz}, d_{yz}$ orbital subspace, this state\nretains the $s$-wave form factor but has a $B_{1g}$ symmetry due to an internal\n$\\tau_3$ structure in the orbital space.

The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings. These\nprinciples explain why the unconventional high T_c superconductivity appears to\nbe such a rare but robust phenomena with its strict requirement on electronic\nenvironment.

The Z2\ndegeneracy they entail renders the existence of two decoupled Majorana modes at\nzero energy an exact property of a finite system at arbitrary values of its\nbulk parameters. We trace the evolution of these modes across the transition\nfrom the disordered phase to the ordered one and analyze the concomitant\nqualitative changes of local magnetic properties of an isolated impurity. In\nthe disordered phase, the two ground states differ only close to the impurity,\nand they are related by the action of an explicitly constructed quasi-local\noperator. In this phase the local transverse spin susceptibility follows a\nCurie law. The critical response of a boundary impurity is logarithmically\ndivergent and maps to the two-channel Kondo problem, while it saturates for\ncritical bulk impurities, as well as in the ordered phase. The results for the\nIsing chain translate to the related problem of a resonant level coupled to a\n1d p-wave superconductor or a Peierls chain, whereby the magnetic order is\nmapped to topological order.

When the scattering rate is\nof the same order of magnitude as the superconducting gap, the spectral\nfunction shows Fermi-arc-like patterns, while the power spectrum of the local\ndensity of states shows the destruction of the octet-model peaks.

The simulation shows that a more efficient and stable\ncoherent random lasing can be achieved with monodisperse scatterers having\namplification in the intra-scatterer region. To realize that experimentally,\nthe array of amplifying microdroplets is created using a vibrating orifice\ndroplet generator.

Our study revealed the following features of the\nsinglet-quintet mixing. (1) The zero-temperature spin susceptibility remains\nzero for the singlet-quintet mixed state if only the centrosymmetric spin-orbit\ncoupling is taken into account, and will deviate from zero when the\nnon-centrosymmetric spin-orbit coupling is introduced. (2) The singlet-quintet\nmixing can help enhance the upper critical field roughly because it can\nincrease $T_c$.

The dark-field image is\nrelated to small angle scattering and has an interesting property when canning\noriented structures: the recorded signal depends on the relative orientation of\nthe structure in the imaging system. Exactly this property allows to draw\nconclusions about the orientation and to reconstruct the structure. However,\nthe reconstruction is a complex, non-trivial challenge. A lot of research was\nconducted towards this goal in the last years and several reconstruction\nalgorithms were proposed. A key step of the reconstruction algorithm is the\ninversion of a forward projection model. Up until now, only 2-D projection\nmodels are available, with effectively limit the scanning trajectory to a 2-D\nplane. To obtain true 3-D information, this limitation requires to combine\nseveral 2-D scans, which leads to quite complex, impractical acquisitions\nschemes. Furthermore, it is not possible with these models to use 3-D\ntrajectories that might allow simpler protocols, like for example a helical\ntrajectory. To address these limitations, we propose in this work a very\ngeneral 3-D projection model. Our projection model defines the dark-field\nsignal dependent on an arbitrarily chosen ray and sensitivity direction. We\nderive the projection model under the assumption that the observed scatter\ndistribution has a Gaussian shape. We theoretically show the consistency of our\nmodel with more constrained existing 2-D models. Furthermore, we experimentally\nshow the compatibility of our model with dark-field measurements of two\nmatchsticks.

In the simplest\ncase of only one molecular state, corresponding to either a Feshbach resonance\nor one-color photoassociation, the system displays Rabi oscillations and rapid\nadiabatic passage between a Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms and fermionic\nmolecules. For two-color photoassociation, the system admits stimulated Raman\nadiabatic passage (STIRAP) from a Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms to stable Fermi\nmolecules, even in the presence of particle-particle interactions. By tailoring\nthe STIRAP sequence it is possible to deliberately convert only a fraction of\nthe initial atoms, leaving a finite fraction of bosons behind to induce\natom-molecule Cooper pairing via density fluctuations; unfortunately, this\nenhancement is insufficient to achieve a superfluid transition with present\nultracold technology. We therefore propose the use of an association resonance\nthat converts atoms and diatomic molecules (dimers) into triatomic molecules\n(trimers), which leads to a crossover from a Bose-Einstein condensate of\ntrimers to atom-dimer Cooper pairs. Because heteronuclear dimers may possess a\npermanent electric dipole moment, this overall system presents an opportunity\nto investigate novel microscopic physics. \n\n"}

Such systems support spiral\nresonances with finite momentum along the cylinder axis. For such modes the\nboundary conditions do not separate and simple TM and TE polarization states do\nnot exist. We formulate a theory for the dispersion relations and polarization\nproperties of such resonances for an infinite dielectric rod of arbitrary\ncross-section and then solve for these quantities for the case of a circular\ncross-section (cylinder). Useful analytic formulas are obtained using the\neikonal (Einstein-Brillouin-Keller) method which are shown to be excellent\napproximations to the exact results from the wave equation. The major finding\nis that the polarization of the radiation emitted into the far-field is linear\nup to a polarization critical angle (PCA) at which it changes to elliptical.\nThe PCA always lies between the Brewster and total-internal-reflection angles\nfor the dielectric, as is shown by an analysis based on the Jones matrices of\nthe spiraling rays. \n\n"}

Significant probe beam amplification\nand conical emission were observed. Under relatively weak pumping and high\nmedium density, when the condition of strong coupling between field and\nresonant matter is fulfilled, the probe amplification spectrum has a form of\nspectral doublet. Stronger pumping leads to the appearance of a single peak of\nthe probe beam amplification at the transition frequency. The greater probe\nintensity results in an asymmetrical transmission spectrum with amplification\nat the blue wing of the absorption line and attenuation at the red one. Under\nhigh medium density, a broad band of amplification appears.
