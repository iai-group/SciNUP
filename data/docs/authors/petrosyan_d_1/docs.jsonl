The B-DMFT is applicable for\narbitrary values of the coupling parameters and temperature and becomes exact\nin the limit of high spatial dimensions d or coordination number Z of the\nlattice. In contrast to its fermionic counterpart the construction of the\nB-DMFT requires different scalings of the hopping amplitudes with Z depending\non whether the bosons are in their normal state or in the Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. A detailed discussion of how this conceptual problem can be\novercome by performing the scaling in the action rather than in the Hamiltonian\nitself is presented. The B-DMFT treats normal and condensed bosons on equal\nfooting and thus includes the effects caused by their dynamic coupling. It\nreproduces all previously investigated limits in parameter space such as the\nBeliaev-Popov and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximations and generalizes the\nexisting mean-field theories of interacting bosons.

For weak disorder,\nthe suppression of the expansion signals the onset of Anderson localization,\nwhich is due to multiple scattering from the modulations of the disordered\npotential.

While the attractive Hubbard\nmodel can be regarded as the generalization of BCS to Bose Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) crossover to a lattice, we find that the BEC limit of this\nHubbard model is very different from that of jellium, owing to the strong\ninter-site repulsion between pairs, which becomes important near half filling\nwhen the on-site attraction is strong. A central conclusion of our work is that\nin a lattice, around half filling, the smooth evolution from the BCS to the BEC\nlimits is interrupted. For the attractive Hubbard model, $T_c$ vanishes when\nthe system approaches the bosonic regime with increasing interaction strength.\nWe suggest that the vanishing of $T_c$ at strong coupling strength may signal a\nquantum critical transition to another form of superfluid not continuously\nconnected to a BCS-like phase.

Although the environment is not\nactually observed, we can use these results to describe the change of the\nquantum system due to its interaction with the environment. We apply this\ntechnique to two different problems.\n  In the first part, we study the coherently driven dynamics of a particle on a\nrail of quantum dots. This tunnelling between adjacent quantum dots can be\ncontrolled externally. We employ an adiabatic scheme similar to stimulated\nRaman adiabatic passage, to transfer the particle between different quantum\ndots.

The results obtained show (1) the presence of a topologically complex\nasymmetrically fragmented magnetic network in the quiet photosphere driven by\nmeso- and supergranulation, (2) the formation of non-potential magnetic\nstructures with complex polarity separation lines inside the active region, and\n(3) statistical signatures of canceling bipolar magnetic structures coinciding\nwith flaring activity in the active region.

In these systems, a macroscopic wave function appears\nbecause of Bose-Einstein condensation, which creates quantized vortices.\nTurbulence consisting of quantized vortices is called quantum turbulence (QT).\nThe study of quantized vortices and QT has increased in intensity for two\nreasons. The first is that recent studies of QT are considerably advanced over\nolder studies, which were chiefly limited to thermal counterflow in 4He, which\nhas no analogue with classical traditional turbulence, whereas new studies on\nQT are focused on a comparison between QT and classical turbulence. The second\nreason is the realization of atomic BECs in 1995, for which modern optical\ntechniques enable the direct control and visualization of the condensate and\ncan even change the interaction; such direct control is impossible in other\nquantum condensates like superfluid helium and superconductors. Our group has\nmade many important theoretical and numerical contributions to the field of\nquantum hydrodynamics of both superfluid helium and atomic BECs.

However, recent developments\nshow that some local operations could be more expensive than others: it is\nreasonable to distinguish between local incoherent operations and local\noperations which can create coherence. This idea leads us to the task of\nincoherent quantum state merging, where one of the parties has free access to\nlocal incoherent operations only. In this case the resources of the process are\nquantified by pairs of entanglement and coherence. Here, we develop tools for\nstudying this process, and apply them to several relevant scenarios. While\nquantum state merging can lead to a gain of entanglement, our results imply\nthat no merging procedure can gain entanglement and coherence at the same time.\nWe also provide a general lower bound on the entanglement-coherence sum, and\nshow that the bound is tight for all pure states. Our results also lead to an\nincoherent version of Schumacher compression: in this case the compression rate\nis equal to the von Neumann entropy of the diagonal elements of the\ncorresponding quantum state. \n\n"}

In classical\nmagnets it is well known that long-range correlations induced by the magnons\nlead to a singular wave-number dependence of the form $1/k^{4-d}$ in all\ndimensions 2<d<4, for both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. At zero\ntemperature we find a profound difference between the two cases. Consistent\nwith naive power counting, the longitudinal susceptibility in a quantum\nantiferromagnet scales as $k^{d-3}$ for 1<d<3, whereas in a quantum ferromagnet\nthe analogous result, $k^{d-2}$, is absent due to a zero scaling function. This\nabsence of a nonanalyticity in the longitudinal susceptibility is due to the\nlack of magnon number fluctuations in the ground state of a quantum\nferromagnet; correlation functions that are sensitive to other fluctuations do\nexhibit the behavior predicted by simple power counting. Also of interest is\nthe dynamical behavior as expressed in the longitudinal part of the dynamical\nstructure factor, which is directly measurable via neutron scattering.

When an ac bias is applied to the\nwire by means of the reservoirs, the statistics of the charge carriers is\ninfluence by the formed non-equilibrium. The proposed model is derived from\nGreen function formalism. The quasi-particle energy distribution is calculated\nwith a quantum diffusion equation including a collision term accounting for\ninelastic scattering. The ac bias, due to high frequency irradiation, drives\nthe wire out of equilibrium. For coherent transport the photon absorption\nprocesses create multiple photon steps in the energy distribution, where the\nnumber of steps is dependent on the relation between the amplitude of the field\neV and the photon energy \\omega. Furthermore we observe that for the slow field\nregime, \\omega \\tau_D < 1, the photon absorption is highly time-dependent. In\nthe fast field regime \\omega \\tau_D > 1 this time-dependency disappears and the\nphoton steps in the distribution have a fixed value.

The VEVs of the squared electric\nand magnetic fields, and of the vacuum energy density are investigated. Near\nthe string they are dominated by the topological contributions and the effects\ninduced by the background gravitational field are small. In this region, the\nleading terms in the topological contributions are obtained from the\ncorresponding VEVs for a string on the Minkowski bulk multiplying by the\nconformal factor. At distances from the string larger than the curvature radius\nof the background geometry, the pure dS parts in the VEVs dominate.

Here, we show that quantum localization-by constraining\nthe time evolution through quantum interference-strongly bounds these errors\nfor local observables. Consequently, for generic quantum many-body\nHamiltonians, Trotter errors can become independent of system size and total\nsimulation time.

It has been recently demonstrated\nthat a tunable bilinear interaction between two cavities can be realized by\ncoupling them to a bichromatically-driven transmon ancilla, which allows\nswapping and interfering the multi-photon states of the cavities [Gao et al.,\nPhys.

First, we demonstrate analytically that a broad\n(loosely bound, LB) soliton state, based on a 2D Bloch function near the edge\nof the Brillouin zone (BZ), has a negative effective mass (while the mass of a\nlocalized state is positive near the BZ center). The negative-mass soliton\ncannot be held by the usual trap, but it is safely confined by an inverted\nparabolic potential (anti-trap). Direct simulations demonstrate that the LB\nsolitons (including the ones with intrinsic vorticity) are stable and can\nfreely move on top of the OL. The frequency of elliptic motion of the\nLB-soliton's center in the anti-trapping potential is very close to the\nanalytical prediction which treats the solition as a quasi-particle.

Then, each of the single-mode Hamiltonians $\\hat{H}_{k}$ is\ndiagonalized separately, and the resulting ground state wavefunction of the\ntotal Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ is written as a simple product of the ground state\nwavefunctions of each of the single-mode Hamiltonians $\\hat{H}_{k}$. We argue\nthat, from a number-conserving perspective, this diagonalization method may not\nbe adequate since the true Hilbert spaces where the Hamiltonians\n${\\hat{H}_{k}}$ should be diagonalized all have the ${k}=0$ state in common,\nand hence the ground state wavefunction of the total Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ may\n{not} be written as a simple product of the ground state wavefunctions of the\n$\\hat{H}_{k}$'s.

Many physicist have regarded this\nrenunciation of our effort to describe nature herself as premature, and John\nvon Neumann reformulated quantum theory as a theory of an evolving objective\nuniverse interacting with human consciousness. This interaction is associated\nboth in Copenhagen quantum theory and in von Neumann quantum theory with a\nsudden change that brings the objective physical state of a system in line with\na subjectively felt psychical reality. The objective physical state is thereby\nconverted from a material substrate to an informational and dispositional\nsubstrate that carries both the information incorporated into it by the\npsychical realities, and certain dispositions for the occurrence of future\npsychical realities. The present work examines and proposes solutions to two\nproblems that have appeared to block the development of this conception of\nnature.

A 53, 1245 (1996)] with titles similar to\nthe one given above, the authors assert that in some cases it is possible to\ncompensate a quantum efficiency $\\eta\\leq 1/2$ in quantum-state measurements,\nviolating the lower bound 1/2 proved in a preceding paper [G. M. D'Ariano, U.\nLeonhardt and H. Paul, Phys. Rev. A 52, R1801 (1995)]. Here we re-establish the\nbound as unsurpassable for homodyning any quantum state, and show how the\nproposed loss-compensation method would always fail in a real measurement\noutside the allowed $\\eta >1/2$ region. \n\n"}

It is found that the qubits\nundergo the dissipation coherently in this case. In particular, for a special\nkind of input states (called the coherence-preserving states), whose form\ndepends on the type of the coupling, loss and decoherence in quantum memory are\nmuch reduced. Based on this phenomenon, a scheme by encoding the general input\nstates of the qubits into the corresponding coherence-preserving states is\nproposed for reducing the cooperative loss and decoherence in quantum\ncomputation or communication. \n\n"}

For this scheme,\ncollective decoding is performed two transmissions at a time. This improves\nupon the previous schemes of Sasaki et al. [Phys. Rev. A 58, 146 (1998)] where\nsuperadditivity was not achieved until a decoding of three or more\ntransmissions at a time. This places superadditivity within the regime of a\nnear-term laboratory demonstration. We propose an experimental test based upon\nan alphabet of low photon-number coherent states where the signal decoding is\ndone with atomic state measurements on a single atom in a high-finesse optical\ncavity. \n\n"}

The resultant action in the path integral\nexpression extensively depends on the vector; It differs from the conventional\none in that it has a generalized form having some additional terms. We also\nstudy, as physical applications, the geometric phases associated with the\ncoherent state path integrals to find that new effects of the terms may appear\nin experiments. We see that the formalism gives a clear insight into geometric\nphases. \n\n"}

For the case of an infinite square well potential, these patterns are\nshown to have a detailed quantitative explanation in terms of a travelling-wave\ndecomposition of P(x,t). Each wave directly yields the time-averaged structure\nof P(x,t) along the (quantised)spacetime direction in which the wave\npropagates. The decomposition leads to new predictions of locations, widths\ndepths and shapes of carpet structures, and results are also applicable to\nlight diffracted by a periodic grating and to the quantum rotator. A simple\nconnection between the waves and the Wigner function of the initial state of\nthe particle is demonstrated, and some results for more general potentials are\ngiven. \n\n"}
