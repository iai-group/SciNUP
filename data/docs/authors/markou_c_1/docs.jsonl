This terminal velocity is set by the characteristic ESL-separation\nand the coupling of the extra degrees of freedom to the moduli, but it is\nindependent of the moduli's potential if the dimensionality of the field space\nis considerably larger than the dimensionality of the loci, D >> d. Once the\nterminal velocity is approached, particles are produced at a plethora of nearby\nESLs, preventing a further increase in speed via their backreaction. It is\npossible to drive inflation at the terminal velocity, providing a\ngeneralization of trapped inflation with attractive features: we find that more\nthan sixty e-folds of inflation for sub-Planckian excursions in field space are\npossible if ESLs are ubiquitous, without fine tuning of initial conditions and\nless tuned potentials.

I consider here the implications of the\nheavier composition on the sources of UHECRs. The smaller magnetic rigidity\nimplies that nuclei UHECRs are: (i) More easily accelerated (ii) Local, as they\ncan diffuse only a few Mpc from their sources before disintegrating (iii)\nIsotropic, because large deflections in the extra galactic and the galactic\nmagnetic fields erase the directional information. Uncertainties in the\nstrength and structure of the the extra galactic magnetic field (EGMF) makes it\ndifficult to estimate the overall effects. However, with typical reasonable\nparameters of a few nG and a coherence distance of a Mpc the distance a nuclei\nUHECR above the GZK energy traverses before photodisintegrating is only a few\nMpc. In spite of the significantly weaker limits on the luminosity, Cen A is\nthe only currently active potential source of nuclei UHECRs within this\ndistance.

After chemical decoupling, or freeze-out, dark matter no\nlonger annihilates but is still kept in local thermal equilibrium due to\nscattering events with the much more abundant standard model particles. During\nkinetic decoupling, even these processes stop to be effective, which eventually\nsets the scale for a small-scale cutoff in the matter density fluctuations.\nAfterwards, the WIMP temperature decreases more quickly than the heat bath\ntemperature, which causes dark matter to reenter an era of annihilation if the\ncross-section is enhanced by the Sommerfeld effect.

This discrepancy has led to various, quite different\nexplanations in terms of increased axial masses, changes in the functional form\nof the axial form factor, increased vector strength in nuclei, and initial\ntwo-particle interactions. This is disconcerting since the neutrino energy\nreconstruction depends on the reaction mechanism. Purpose: We investigate\nwhether exclusive observables, such as nucleon knock-out, can be used to\ndistinguish between the various proposed reaction mechanisms. We determine the\ninfluence of 2p-2h excitations on the energy reconstruction. Method: We use the\nGiessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model to predict numbers and\nspectra of knock-out nucleons. The model is extended by incorporating a simple,\nbut realistic treatment of initial 2p-2h excitations. Results: We show numbers\nand spectra of knock-out nucleons and show their sensitivity to the presence of\n2p-2h initial excitations. We also discuss the influence of 2p-2h excitations\non the neutrino energy reconstruction. Conclusions: 2p-2h excitations do lead\nto an increase in the number $n$ of knock-out nucleons for $n \\ge 2$ while only\nthe $n=1$ knock-out remains a clean signal of true QE scattering. The spectra\nof knock-out nucleons do also change, but their qualitative shape remains as\nbefore. In the energy reconstruction 2p-2h interactions lead to a downward\nshift of the reconstructed energy; this effect of 2p-2h excitations disappears\nat higher energies because the 2p-2h influence is spread out over a wider\nenergy range. \n\n"}

We show that, allowing only new fermions with marginal interactions\nat the weak scale, the required Yukawa couplings for a factor of 2 enhancement\nare so large that the Higgs quartic coupling is pushed to large negative values\nin the UV, triggering an unacceptable vacuum instability far beneath the 10 TeV\nscale. An enhancement by a factor of 1.5 can be accommodated if the charged\nfermions are lighter than 150 GeV, within reach of discovery in almost all\ncases in the 8 TeV run at the LHC, and in even the most difficult cases at 14\nTeV.

We study here the perturbative 1PI effective action\nin the anti-selfdual variables of any gauge theory, in particular pure YM, QCD\nand N=1 SUSY YM. We prove that the one-loop 1PI effective action of a gauge\ntheory mapped to the anti-selfdual variables in any gauge is identical to the\none of the original theory. This is due to the conspiracy between the Jacobian\nof the change to the anti-selfdual variables and an extra functional\ndeterminant that arises from the non-linearity of the coupling of the\nanti-selfdual curvature to an external source in the Legendre transform that\ndefines the 1PI effective action. Hence we establish the one-loop perturbative\nequivalence of the mapped and original theories on the basis of the identity of\nthe one-loop 1PI effective actions.

In\nparticular, a putative neutrino magnetic dipole moment mu_nu enhances the\nplasmon decay process, postpones helium ignition in low-mass stars, and\ntherefore extends the red-giant branch (RGB) in globular clusters (GCs).

We\npropose to use the proton linac of the European Spallation Source currently\nunder construction in Lund, Sweden to deliver, in parallel with the spallation\nneutron production, a very intense, cost effective and high performance\nneutrino beam. The baseline program for the European Spallation Source linac is\nthat it will be fully operational at 5 MW average power by 2022, producing 2\nGeV 2.86 ms long proton pulses at a rate of 14 Hz. Our proposal is to upgrade\nthe linac to 10 MW average power and 28 Hz, producing 14 pulses/s for neutron\nproduction and 14 pulses/s for neutrino production. Furthermore, because of the\nhigh current required in the pulsed neutrino horn, the length of the pulses\nused for neutrino production needs to be compressed to a few $\\mu$s with the\naid of an accumulator ring. A long baseline experiment using this Super Beam\nand a megaton underground Water Cherenkov detector located in existing mines\n300-600 km from Lund will make it possible to discover leptonic CP violation at\n5 $\\sigma$ significance level in up to 50% of the leptonic Dirac CP-violating\nphase range.

The evolution of the\nphysics of the atomic nucleus went through many stages as more data become\navailable. We briefly discuss models introduced to discern the physics behind\nthe experimental discoveries, such as the shell model, the collective model,\nthe statistical model, the interacting boson model, etc., some of these models\nmay be seemingly in conflict with each other, but this was shown to be only\napparent.\n  The richness of the ideas and abundance of theoretical models attests to the\nimportant fact that the nucleus is a really singular system in the sense that\nit evolves from two-body bound states such as the deuteron, to few-body bound\nstates, such as $^4$He, $^7$Li, $^9$Be etc. and up the ladder to heavier bound\nnuclei containing up to more than 200 nucleons.

This is due to the\neffect of color mismatch for certain effective operators, which leads to mixing\nbetween different operators with vastly different nuclear matrix elements\n(NMEs). In this note we analyze the QCD corrections for long-range mechanisms\n(LRM), due to diagrams with light-neutrino exchange between a Standard Model\n(V-A)$\\times$(V-A) and a beyond the SM lepton number violating vertex. We argue\nthat in contrast to the SRM in the LRM case, there is no operator mixing from\ncolor-mismatched operators. This is due to a combined effect of the nuclear\nshort-range correlations and color invariance. As a result, the QCD corrections\nto the LRM amount to an effect no more than 60%, depending on the operator in\nquestion.

The review begins with a\ndetailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the\nrigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions\nof General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key\ncomponents of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational\nobservables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their\ntime derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all\nthese contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the\npeak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical\nmeaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection\nbetween bias parameters and galaxy statistics. We then review the excursion-set\nformalism and peak theory which provide predictions for the values of the bias\nparameters. In the remainder of the review, we consider the generalizations of\ngalaxy bias required in the presence of various types of cosmological physics\nthat go beyond pressureless matter with adiabatic, Gaussian initial conditions:\nprimordial non-Gaussianity, massive neutrinos, baryon-CDM isocurvature\nperturbations, dark energy, and modified gravity. Finally, we discuss how the\ndescription of galaxy bias in the galaxies' rest frame is related to clustering\nstatistics measured from the observed angular positions and redshifts in actual\ngalaxy catalogs. \n\n"}

This requires to give a precise and gauge-invariant meaning to\nthe underlying physics. This is complicated by the fact that concepts like the\nHiggs vacuum expectation value or the separation between confinement and the\nBEH effect loose their meaning beyond perturbation theory. This is addressed by\ncarefully constructing the corresponding theory space and the quantum phase\ndiagram. The physical spectrum needs then to be also given in terms of\ngauge-invariant, i. e. composite, states. Using gauge-invariant perturbation\ntheory, as developed by Froehlich, Morchio, and Strocchi, it is possible to\nrederive conventional perturbation theory. This derivation explicitly shows why\nthe description of the standard model in terms of the unphysical,\ngauge-dependent, elementary states of the Higgs and W-bosons and Z-boson, but\nalso of the elementary fermions, is adequate and successful. These are\nunavoidable consequences of the field theory underlying the standard model,\nfrom which the usual picture emerges. The validity of this emergence can only\nbe tested non-perturbatively. Such tests, in particular using lattice gauge\ntheory, will be reviewed as well.

Past studies have shown that cosmic microwave\nbackground and large-scale structure constraints rule out $\\gtrsim 5\\%$ of the\ndark matter to behave in this manner. However, we show that, even with percent\nlevel mass fractions, a dark atomic sector could affect some extragalactic and\ngalactic observables.

Rather than disks\nin Milky Way sized halos, we find the end product is typically spheroidal\nstructures on galactic scales or dark atom fragments distributed on halo\nscales. This result contrasts with previous studies, which had assumed that the\ndark atoms would result in dark disks. Furthermore the dark atoms condense into\ndense clumps, analogous to how the baryons fragment on solar-mass scales. We\nestimate the size of these dark clumps, and use these estimates to show that\nviable atomic dark matter parameter space is ruled out by stellar microlensing,\nby the half-light radii of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, and by Milky Way\nmass-to-light inferences. \n\n"}

On the one hand, an explicitly quantum scale\ninvariant theory can emerge from the scale invariant renormalisation of a scale\ninvariant Lagrangian. On the other hand, we show how a quantum scale invariant\ntheory can equally emerge from a Lagrangian visibly breaking scale invariance\nrenormalised with scale dependent renormalisation (such as the traditional\nMS-bar scheme). In this last case, scale invariance is hidden in the theory, in\nthe sense that it only appears explicitly after renormalisation. \n\n"}

The basic equations\nare derived from the coherent state approximation to the functional\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for the field. These equations are solved asymptotically\nand numerically for three physical situations. The first is the study of the\nnonlinear mechanism responsible for the quantum stability of the soliton in the\npresence of low momentum fluctuations. The second considers the scattering of a\nwave by the Soliton. Finally the third problem considered is the collision of\nSolitons and the stability of a breather.\n  It is shown that the complete integrability of the Sine-Gordon equation\nprecludes fusion and splitting processes in this simplified model.\n  The approximate results obtained are non-perturbative in nature, and are\nvalid for the full nonlinear interaction in the limit of low momentum\nfluctuations. It is also found that these approximate results are in good\nagreement with full numerical solutions of the governing equations.

Abstract: Knowing whether a hadron is formed inside or outside the nuclear medium is\nvery important for correctly interpreting jet quenching in heavy-ion\ncollisions.

Two\nframeworks are presently competing to explain the observed attenuation of\nhadron production: quark energy loss, with hadron formation outside the\nnucleus, and nuclear absorption with hadronization starting inside the nucleus.\nI demonstrate that the observed approximate A^(2/3) scaling of experimental\ndata cannot conclusively establish the correctness of either energy loss or\nabsorption. \n\n"}

The model has then\nbeen extended to finite nuclei, taking into account nuclear effects such as\nFermi motion, Pauli blocking (both within the local density approximation),\nnuclear binding and final state interactions. The in-medium modification of the\nDelta resonance due to Pauli blocking and collisional broadening have also been\nincluded.

We argue that flow observables within systems with a non-negligible\nmean free path should acquire a \"dynamical\" fluctuation, due to the random\nnature of each collision between the system's degrees of freedom. Because of\nthis, $v_2$ fluctuations can be used to estimate the Knudsen number of the\nsystem produced at RHIC. To illustrate this quantitatively, we apply the UrQMD\nmodel, with scaled cross sections, to show that collisions at RHIC have a\nKnudsen number at least one order of magnitude above the expected value for an\ninteracting hadron gas. Furthermore, we argue that the Knudsen number is also\nbound from above by the $v_2$ fluctuation data, because too large a Knudsen\nnumber would break the observed scaling of $v_2$ fluctuations due to the onset\nof turbulent flow. We propose, therefore that $v_2$ fluctuation measurements,\ntogether with an understanding of the turbulent regime for relativistic\nhydrodynamics, will provide an upper as well as a lower limit for the Knudsen\nnumber. \n\n"}
