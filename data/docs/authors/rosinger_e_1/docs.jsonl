Various other experimental\nresults seem to point in the same direction: For instance, localized wavelet-\ntype solutions to Maxwell equations have been found, both theoretically and\nexperimentally, that travel with superluminal speed. [Even muonic and\nelectronic neutrinos [it has been proposed] might be \"tachyons\", since their\nsquare mass appears to be negative]. With regard to the first-mentioned\nexperiments, it was recently claimed by Guenter Nimtz that those results with\nevanescent waves (or tunneling photons) imply superluminal signal and impulse\ntransmission, and therefore violate Einstein causality. In this note we want to\nstress that, on the contrary, all such results do not place relativistic\ncausality in jeopardy, even if they referred to actual tachyonic motions: In\nfact, Special Relativity can cope even with superluminal objects and waves. For\ninstance, it is possible (at least in microphysics) to solve also the known\ncausal paradoxes, devised for faster than light motion, although this is not\nwidely recognized yet. Here we show, in detail and rigorously, how to solve the\noldest causal paradox, originally proposed by Tolman, which is the kernel of\nmany further tachyon paradoxes (like J.Bell's, F.A.E.Pirani's, J.D.Edmonds' and\nothers').

Within this framework, we demonstrate that the qubit can function as a\nquantum switch between the two resonators, which are assumed to be originally\nindependent. In this three-circuit network, the qubit mediates a geometric\nsecond-order circuit interaction between the otherwise decoupled resonators. In\nthe dispersive regime, it also gives rise to a dynamic second-order\nperturbative interaction. The geometric and dynamic coupling strengths can be\ntuned to be equal, thus permitting to switch on and off the interaction between\nthe two resonators via a qubit population inversion or a shifting of the qubit\noperation point. We also show that our quantum switch represents a flexible\narchitecture for the manipulation and generation of nonclassical microwave\nfield states as well as the creation of controlled multipartite entanglement in\ncircuit QED.

However, there are indications that the SM is only a good\napproximation to an underlying non-local reality involving fundamental entities\n(preons) that are not point particles. Furthermore, our universe seems to be\ndominated by a vacuum energy/cosmological constant. The holographic principle\nthen indicates only a finite number of bits of information will ever be\navailable to describe the observable universe, and that requires a holographic\npreon model linking the (0,1) holographic bits to SM particles. All SM\nparticles have charges 0, 1/3, 2/3 or 1 in units of the electron charge, so the\nbits in a holographic preon model must be identified with fractional electric\ncharge. Such holographic charged preon models require baryon asymmetry and also\nsuggest a mechanism for stationary action. This paper outlines a holographic\ncharged preon model where preons are strands with finite energy density\nspecified by bits of information identifying the charge on each end. In the\nmodel, SM particles consist of three strands with spin states corresponding to\nwrapped states of the strands. SM particles in this wrapped preon model can be\napproximated by preon bound states in non-local dynamics based on three-preon\nBethe-Salpeter equations with instantaneous three-preon interactions.

In his theory Lorenz sets the vacuum light speed\nequal to \\sqrt{2}/2 times Weber's measured superluminal value for magnetic\ninduction speed. Using the wave equation Green's function paradigm Lorenz\nreduces his integral, retarded Ohm's law formulation to a differential\nformulation for current density. This represents his solution to the\nelectromagnetic action at a distance problem. During the reduction he presents\na light like, plane wave solution for current density that can not satisfy\ninitial conditions on the expanding wave front and, using a faulty by parts\nintegration that neglects retardation, he develops the eponymic Lorenz\ncondition. Although generally accepted, this condition relates vector and\nscalar potentials erroneously. A proper relation is given and major\nconsequences are developed in appendices.

In particular, the usual quantum\nmechanical wave function (a function on a high-dimensional configuration space)\nis not among the beables posited by the new theory. Instead, each particle has\nan associated ``pilot-wave'' field (living in physical space). A number of\nadditional fields (also fields on physical space) maintain what is described,\nin ordinary quantum theory, as ``entanglement.'' The theory allows some\ninteresting new perspective on the kind of causation involved in pilot-wave\ntheories in general. And it provides also a concrete example of an empirically\nviable quantum theory in whose formulation the wave function (on configuration\nspace) does not appear -- i.e., it is a theory according to which nothing\ncorresponding to the configuration space wave function need actually exist.\nThat is the theory's \\emph{raison d'etre} and perhaps its only virtue.

We recast this as an ordinary\nfunctional integral by changing direct integration over subpaths constrained to\nall have the same two endpoints into an equivalent integration over those\nsubpaths' unconstrained second derivatives. Function expansion with generalized\nLegendre polynomials of time then enables the functional integral to be\nunambiguously evaluated through first order in the elapsed time, yielding the\nSchroedinger equation with a unique quantization of the classical Hamiltonian.\nWidespread disbelief in that uniqueness stemmed from the mistaken notion that\nno subpath can have its two endpoints arbitrarily far separated when its\nnonzero elapsed time is made arbitrarily short. We also obtain the quantum\namplitude for any specified configuration or momentum path, which turns out to\nbe an ordinary functional integral over, respectively, all momentum or all\nconfiguration paths.

As the\ntransfer is perfect when the selected pathway is mediated by 2 or 3 spins,\ndistant state transfers over complex networks can be achieved by successive\nrecouplings among specific pairs/triads of spins. These effects are illustrated\nwith a quantum simulator involving 13C NMR on Leucine's backbone; a six-spin\nnetwork. \n\n"}

Taking into account that the mass of the\nvisible universe is M=2x10^{53} kg, it appears that the entire visible universe\nis inside a {\\it photon sphere} of radius R_{ps} = 14.3 Gpc.

Dynamical decoupling (DD) is\none of the most effective experimental methods for maintaining coherence,\nespecially when one can access only the qubit-system and not its environment\n(bath). It involves the application of pulses to the system whose net effect is\na reversal of the system-environment interaction. In any real system, however,\nthe environment is not static, and therefore the reversal of the\nsystem-environment interaction becomes imperfect if the spacing between\nrefocusing pulses becomes comparable to or longer than the correlation time of\nthe environment. The efficiency of the refocusing improves therefore if the\nspacing between the pulses is reduced. Here, we quantify the efficiency of\ndifferent DD sequences in preserving different quantum states. We use 13C\nnuclear spins as qubits and an environment of 1H nuclear spins as the\nenvironment, which couples to the qubit via magnetic dipole-dipole couplings.\nStrong dipole-dipole couplings between the proton spins result in a rapidly\nfluctuating environment with a correlation time of the order of 100 us. Our\nexperimental results show that short delays between the pulses yield better\nperformance if they are compared with the bath correlation time.

Dynamical\ndecoupling (DD) is an effective method for reducing decoherence with a low\ncontrol overhead. It also plays an important role in quantum metrology, where\nfor instance it is employed in multiparameter estimation. While a sequence of\nequidistant control pulses (CPMG) has been ubiquitously used for decoupling,\nUhrig recently proposed that a non-equidistant pulse sequence (UDD) may enhance\nDD performance, especially for systems where the spectral density of the\nenvironment has a sharp frequency cutoff. On the other hand, equidistant\nsequences outperform UDD for soft cutoffs. The relative advantage provided by\nUDD for intermediate regimes is not clear. In this paper, we analyze the\nrelative DD performance in this regime experimentally, using solid-state\nnuclear magnetic resonance. Our system-qubits are 13C nuclear spins and the\nenvironment consists of a 1H nuclear spin-bath whose spectral density is close\nto a normal (Gaussian) distribution. We find that in the presence of such a\nbath, the CPMG sequence outperforms the UDD sequence. An analogy between\ndynamical decoupling and interference effects in optics provides an intuitive\nexplanation as to why the CPMG sequence performs superior to any\nnon-equidistant DD sequence in the presence of this kind of environmental\nnoise. \n\n"}

More precisely, it is impossible to\nreproduce the quantum-mechanical predictions using a non-contextual realist\nmodel, i.e., a model where the outcome of one measurement is independent of the\nchoice of compatible measurements performed in the measurement context. There\nhas been several attempts to quantify the amount of contextuality for specific\nquantum systems, for example, in the number of rays needed in a KS proof, or\nthe number of terms in certain inequalities, or in the violation, noise\nsensitivity, and other measures. This paper is about another approach: to use a\nsimple contextual model that reproduces the quantum-mechanical contextual\nbehaviour, but not necessarily all quantum predictions. The amount of\ncontextuality can then be quantified in terms of additional resources needed as\ncompared with a similar model without contextuality.

We call this task \\textit{property testing} of quantum measurement.\nWe first introduce a metric for quantum measurements, and show that it\npossesses many nice features. Then we show that, with respect to this metric,\nthe following classes of measurements can be efficiently tested: 1. the\nstabilizer measurements, which play a crucial role for quantum error\ncorrection; 2. the $k$-local measurements, i.e. measurements whose outcomes\ndepend on a subsystem of at most $k$ qudits; 3. the permutation-invariant\nmeasurements, which include those measurements used in quantum data\ncompression, state estimation and entanglement concentration.

Indeed, in order to prove Four-Color Conjecture, it clearly\nsuffices to show that all maximal planar graphs are 4-colorable. Since this\nconjecture was proposed in 1852, no mathematical proofs have been invented up\nuntil now. Maybe the main reasons lie in the following three aspects in terms\nof maximal planar graphs: not clearing up the structures, not figuring out the\ncoloring types, and not straightening out the relation between structure and\ncoloring. For this, we will write a series of articles to study the structure\nand coloring theory of maximal planar graphs systematically. This is our first\narticle, which focuses mainly on the structure and coloring relations. First,\nwe introduce a new way to construct maximal planar graphs. The advantage of\nthis method is that it establishes an immediate relation with 4-colorings, and\nreveals how a given maximal planar graph is generated.

Separately, recent experiments in fluid mechanics have demonstrated\nthe emergence of a full range of quantum phenomena from completely classical\nmotion. We present two specific hypotheses. First, Kuramoto theory may give a\nbasis for geometrical thinking about entanglement. Second, we consider a recent\nsoliton model of the electron, in which the quantum-mechanical wave function is\na phase modulation of a carrier wave. Both models are consistent with one\nanother and with observation. Both models suggest how entanglement and\ndecoherence may be related to device geometry. Both models predict that it will\nbe difficult to maintain phase coherence of more than three qubits in the\nplane, or four qubits in a three-dimensional structure. The soliton model also\nshows that the experimental work which appeared to demonstrate a violation of\nBell's inequalities might not actually do so; regardless of whether it is a\ncorrect description of the world, it exposes a flaw in the logic of the Bell\ntests. Thus the case for the security of EPR-based quantum cryptography has\njust not been made. We propose experiments in quantum computation to test this.\nFinally, we examine two possible interpretations of such soliton models: one is\nconsistent with the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics, while\nthe other is an entirely classical model in which we do not have to abandon the\nidea of a single world where action is local and causal. \n\n"}

A special\nemphasis is put on the differences between conservative and non-conservative\ntransformations. In particular, we show that for the zero initial potential, a\nnon-conservative transformation is always equivalent to a pair of conservative\ntransformations. These single-channel results are illustrated on the inversion\nof the neutron-proton triplet eigenphase shifts for the S and D waves. We then\nsummarize and extend our previous works on the coupled-channel case and stress\nremaining difficulties and open questions. We mostly concentrate on two-channel\nexamples to illustrate general principles while keeping mathematics as simple\nas possible. In particular, we discuss the difference between the\nequal-threshold and different-threshold problems.

This number is further limited by\nnon-commutativity of idempotents.\n  We consider the tensor product of Kaehler algebra with tangent Clifford\nalgebra, i.e. of valuedness. It has a commutative subalgebra of \"mirror\nelements\", i.e. where the valuedness is dual to the differential form (like in\n$dx\\mathbf{i}$, but not in $dx\\mathbf{j}$).

{"id": "1512.03093", "contents": "Title: Scan Quantum Mechanics: Quantum Inertia Stops Superposition Abstract: A novel interpretation of the quantum mechanical superposition is put\nforward. Quantum systems scan all possible available states and switch randomly\nand very rapidly among them. The longer they remain in a given state, the\nlarger the probability of the system to be found in that state during a\nmeasurement. A crucial property that we postulate is quantum inertia, that\nincreases whenever a constituent is added, or the system is perturbed with all\nkinds of interactions. Once the quantum inertia $I_q$ reaches a critical value\n$I_{cr}$ for an observable, the switching among the different eigenvalues of\nthat observable stops and the corresponding superposition comes to an end.\nConsequently, increasing the mass, temperature, gravitational force, etc. of a\nquantum system increases its quantum inertia until the superposition of states\ndisappears for all the observables and the system transmutes into a classical\none. The process could be reversible: decreasing the size, temperature,\ngravitational force, etc. of a classical system one could revert the situation.\nEntanglement can only occur between quantum systems, not between a quantum\nsystem and a classical one, because an exact synchronization between the\nswitchings of the systems involved must be established in the first place and\nclassical systems do not have any switchings to start with. Future experiments\nmight determine the critical inertia $I_{cr}$ corresponding to different\nobservables. In addition, our proposal implies a new radiation mechanism in\nstrong gravitational fields, giving rise to non-thermal synchrotron emission,\nthat could contribute to neutron star formation. Superconductivity,\nsuperfluidity, Bose-Einstein condensates, and any other physical phenomena at\nvery low temperatures must be reanalyzed in the light of this interpretation,\nas well as mesoscopic systems in general. \n\n"}

Recent theoretical advances beyond the Bethe\nansatz and bosonisation allow us to predict the behaviour of one-dimensional\nconfined systems with strong short-range interactions, and new experiments with\ncold atomic Fermi gases have already confirmed these theories.

It is also notoriously difficult to solve in large-scale since\nstandard techniques require expensive matrix decompositions. An alternative, is\nthe conditional gradient method (aka Frank-Wolfe algorithm) that regained much\ninterest in recent years, mostly due to its application to this specific\nsetting. The key benefit of the CG method is that it avoids expensive matrix\ndecompositions all together, and simply requires a single eigenvector\ncomputation per iteration, which is much more efficient. On the downside, the\nCG method, in general, converges with an inferior rate. The error for\nminimizing a $\\beta$-smooth function after $t$ iterations scales like\n$\\beta/t$. This convergence rate does not improve even if the function is also\nstrongly convex.\n  In this work we present a modification of the CG method tailored for convex\noptimization over the spectrahedron. The per-iteration complexity of the method\nis essentially identical to that of the standard CG method: only a single\neigenvecor computation is required. For minimizing an $\\alpha$-strongly convex\nand $\\beta$-smooth function, the expected approximation error of the method\nafter $t$ iterations is: $$O\\left({\\min\\{\\frac{\\beta{}}{t}\n,\\left({\\frac{\\beta\\sqrt{\\textrm{rank}(\\textbf{X}^*)}}{\\alpha^{1/4}t}}\\right)^{4/3},\n\\left({\\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}\\lambda_{\\min}(\\textbf{X}^*)t}}\\right)^{2}\\}}\\right)\n,$$ where $\\textbf{X}^*$ is the optimal solution.

Free-field QFT meets\nthe axioms of axiomatic QFT, showing they are consistent. Nevertheless, even\nafter more than 50 years, there is still no known non-trivial theory of quantum\nfields with interactions in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime that meets the\nsame axioms.\n  This paper provides a similar axiomatic basis for parameterized QFT, in which\nan invariant, fifth path parameter is added to the usual four spacetime\nposition arguments of quantum fields. Dynamic evolution is in terms of the path\nparameter rather than the frame-dependent time coordinate. Further, the states\nof the theory are allowed to be off shell.

On\none hand, the timing of event triggering carries implicit information about the\nstate of the plant. On the other hand, the delay in the communication channel\ncauses information loss, as it makes the state information available at the\ncontroller out of date. Combining these two effects, we show a phase transition\nbehavior in the transmission rate required for stabilization using a given\nevent-triggering strategy. For small values of the delay, the timing\ninformation carried by the triggering events is substantial, and the system can\nbe stabilized with any positive rate. When the delay exceeds a critical\nthreshold, the timing information alone is not enough to achieve stabilization\nand the required rate grows. When the loss of information due to the\ncommunication delay perfectly compensates the implicit information carried by\nthe triggering events, the delay equals the inverse of the entropy rate of the\nplant, and we obtain the same rate requirement prescribed by the data-rate\ntheorem.

Now, a natural\nquestion arises that how these degrees of freedom are emerged from nothing? We\ntry to address this issue in a new theory which is more complete than M-theory\nand reduces to it with some limitations. In M-theory, there isn't any stable\nobject like stable M3-branes that our universe is formed on it and for this\nreason can't help us to explain cosmological events. In this research, we\npropose a new theory, named G -theory which could be the mother of M-theory and\nsuperstring theory. In G-theory, at the beginning, two types of G0-branes, one\nwith positive energy and one with negative energy are produced from nothing in\nfourteen dimensions. Then, these branes are compactified on three circles via\ntwo different ways (symmetrically and anti-symmetrically), and two bosonic and\nfermionic parts of action for M0-branes are produced.

When relating\nthe black-hole electric charges to the baryon-chemical potentials it was found\nthat the phenomenologically-deduced parameters from various particle ratios in\nthe statistical thermal models agree well with the ones determined from the\nthermal radiation from charged black-hole. Accordingly, the resulting freezeout\nconditions, such as $s/T^3=7$ and $<E>/<N>=1~$GeV, are confirmed at finite\nchemical potentials, as well. Furthermore, the problematic of strangeness\nproduction in elementary collisions can be interpreted by thermal particle\nproduction from the Hawking-Unruh radiation. Consequently, the freezeout\ntemperature depends on the quark masses. This leads to a deviation from full\nequilibrium and thus a suppression of the strangeness production in the\nelementary collisions.

Actuation\nhas the form of blowing and suction localized on the main plate and is\nrepresented in terms of a sink-source singularity, whereas measurement of\npressure across the plate serves as system output. We focus on point-vortex\nequilibria forming a one-parameter family with locus approaching the trailing\nedge of the main plate and show that these equilibria are either unstable or\nneutrally stable. Using methods of linear control theory we find that the\nsystem dynamics linearised around these equilibria are both controllable and\nobservable for almost all actuator and sensor locations. The design of the\nfeedback control is based on the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) compensator.\nComputational results demonstrate the effectiveness of this control and the key\nfinding is that Kasper Wing configurations are in general more controllable\nthan their single plate counterparts and also exhibit larger basins of\nattraction under LQG feedback control. The feedback control is then applied to\nsystems with additional perturbations added to the flow in the form of random\nfluctuations of the angle of attack and a vorticity shedding mechanism. Another\nimportant observation is that, in the presence of these additional\nperturbations, the control remains robust, provided the system does not deviate\ntoo far from its original state. Furthermore, introducing a vorticity shedding\nmechanism tends to enhance the effectiveness of the control.

We compare the solutions and the energy spectra obtained with the\ncorresponding ones from the Dirac equation for a spin one-half relativistic\nparticle. We note the similarities and differences, in particular the spin\neffects in the relativistic energy spectrum. As expected, the non-relativistic\nlimit is the same for both kinds of particles, since, for a particle in a box,\nthe spin contribution to the energy is a relativistic effect. \n\n"}

The central bank can purchase\nand sell the foreign currency, and each intervention on the exchange market\nleads to a proportional cost whose instantaneous marginal value depends on the\ncurrent level of the exchange rate. The central bank aims at minimizing the\ntotal expected costs of interventions on the exchange market, plus a total\nexpected holding cost. We formulate this problem as an infinite time-horizon\nstochastic control problem with controls that have paths which are locally of\nbounded variation. The exchange rate evolves as a general linearly controlled\none-dimensional diffusion, and the two nondecreasing processes giving the\nminimal decomposition of a bounded-variation control model the cumulative\namount of foreign currency that has been purchased and sold by the central\nbank. We provide a complete solution to this problem by finding the explicit\nexpression of the value function and a complete characterization of the optimal\ncontrol. At each instant of time, the optimally controlled exchange rate is\nkept within a band whose size is endogenously determined as part of the\nsolution to the problem. We also study the expected exit time from the band,\nand the sensitivity of the width of the band with respect to the model's\nparameters in the case when the exchange rate evolves (in absence of any\nintervention) as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and the marginal costs of\ncontrols are constant.

In contrast to the indefinite metric and\nghosts of gauge theory, SLFT uses only positivity-respecting physical degrees\nof freedom. The result is a fully Lorentz-covariant and causal string field\ntheory in which light- or space-like linear strings transform covariant under\nLorentz transformation. The cooperation of causality and quantum positivity in\nthe presence of interacting s particles leads to remarkable conceptual changes.\nIt turns out that the presence of H-selfinteractions in the Higgs model is not\nthe result of SSB on a postulated Mexican hat potential, but solely the\nconsequence of the implementation of positivity and causality.

Information reconciliation is a part of CPP in\nwhich parties are given correlated variables and attempt to eliminate the\ndiscrepancies between them while disclosing a minimum amount of information.\nThe elegant reconciliation protocol known as \\emph{Cascade} was developed\nspecifically for QKD in 1992 and has become the de-facto standard for all QKD\nimplementations. However, the protocol is highly interactive. Thus, other\nprotocols based on linear block codes such as Hamming codes, low-density\nparity-check (LDPC) codes, and polar codes have been researched. In particular,\nreconciliation using LDPC codes has been mainly studied because of its\noutstanding performance. Nevertheless, with small block size, the bit error\nrate performance of polar codes under successive-cancellation list (SCL)\ndecoding with a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is comparable to state-of-the-art\nturbo and LDPC codes. In this study, we demonstrate the use of polar codes to\nimprove the performance of information reconciliation in a QKD system with\nsmall block size. The best decoder for polar codes, a CRC-aided SCL decoder,\nrequires CRC-precoded messages. However, messages that are sifted keys in QKD\nare obtained arbitrarily as a result of a characteristic of the QKD protocol\nand cannot be CRC-precoded. We propose a method that allows arbitrarily\nobtained sifted keys to be CRC precoded by introducing a virtual string.

The difficulty here lies in the fact that the state-space of\na delayed reaction network is infinite-dimensional, which makes their analysis\nmore involved. We demonstrate here that a particular class of stochastic\ntime-varying delays, namely those that follow a phase-type distribution, can be\nexactly implemented in terms of a chemical reaction network. Hence, any\ndelay-free network can be augmented to incorporate those delays through the\naddition of delay-species and delay-reactions. Hence, for this class of\nstochastic delays, which can be used to approximate any delay distribution\narbitrarily accurately, the state-space remains finite-dimensional and,\ntherefore, standard tools developed for standard reaction network still apply.\nIn particular, we demonstrate that for unimolecular mass-action reaction\nnetworks that the delayed stochastic reaction network is ergodic if and only if\nthe non-delayed network is ergodic as well. Bimolecular reactions are more\ndifficult to consider but an analogous result is also obtained. These results\ntell us that delays that are phase-type distributed, regardless of their\ndistribution, are not harmful to the ergodicity property of reaction networks.\nWe also prove that the presence of those delays adds convolution terms in the\nmoment equation but does not change the value of the stationary means compared\nto the delay-free case. Finally, the control of a certain class of delayed\nstochastic reaction network using a delayed antithetic integral controller is\nconsidered.

Following the pioneering work of Bizon-Rostworowski,\nresearch efforts have been mainly focused on the study of the spherically\nsymmetric Einstein-scalar field system. The first rigorous proof of the\ninstability of AdS in the simplest spherically symmetric setting, namely for\nthe Einstein-null dust system, was obtained in [G. Moschidis, A proof of the\ninstability of AdS for the Einstein-null dust system with an inner mirror,\n2017, arXiv:1704.08681]. In that work, the evolution was restricted to the\nexterior of an inner mirror placed at $r=r_{0}>0$, in order to circumvent the\ntrivial break down of the Einstein-null dust system occurring at $r=0$; in that\nsetting, additional considerations necessitated $r_{0}$ to shrink to $0$ with\nthe size of the initial perturbation.\n  In this paper, we establish the instability of AdS for the Einstein-massless\nVlasov system in spherical symmetry. This will be the first proof of the AdS\ninstability conjecture for an Einstein--matter system which is well-posed for\nregular initial data in the standard sense, without the addition of an inner\nmirror.

Some toy models in terms of tensor and scalar--tensor theories will be\npresented. Then a few essential physical aspects of the idea including the\neffect on the black holes, the initial Big--Bang singularity and non locality\nare investigated. We shall formulate a quantum equivalence principle according\nto which gravitational effects can be removed by going to a freely falling\nframe while quantum effects can be eliminated by choosing an appropriate scale.\nAnd we shall see that the best framework for both quantum and gravity is Weyl\ngeometry. Then we shall show how one can get the de-Broglie--Bohm quantum\ntheory out of a Weyl covariant theory.

In the\nframework of the non-Riemannian geometry one can construct the space-time\ngeometry, where the motion of free particles is primordially stochastic, and\nthis stochasticity depends on the particle mass. At the same time the geometry\nin itself is not stochastic in the sense that the space-time intervals are\ndeterministic. Principles of quantum mechanics can be deduced from such a\nspace-time geometry. The crisis situation in geometry appears to be connected\nwith some preconceptions concerning the foundation of the geometry. The\npreconceptions as well as the crisis generated by them are not purely\nscientific phenomena. The human factor (social aspect) is rather strong in the\ncrisis phenomena. The preconceptions and the human factor appear to be so\nstrong, that usual logical arguments are not perceived, and the usual formal\nmathematical language appears to be inappropriate for perception of an analysis\nof the crisis origin and of a possibility of its overcoming. In the paper the\nhistory and motives of the non-Riemannian geometry construction are presented.\nThere is a hope that such a less formal way of presentation helps to understand\nand to overcome the existing preconceptions. \n\n"}

In an enumerative chess problem, the set of moves in the\nsolution is (usually) unique but the order is not, and the task is to count the\nfeasible permutations via an isomorphic problem in enumerative combinatorics.\nAlmost all enumerative chess problems have been ``series-movers'', in which one\nside plays an uninterrupted series of moves, unanswered except possibly for one\nmove by the opponent at the end.

We explore the properties of conjugate channels and\ndescribe several different methods of construction. In general, conjugate\nchannels map M_d to M_d' with d < d', and different constructions may differ by\nconjugation with a partial isometry.\n  We show that a channel and its conjugate have the same minimal output entropy\nand maximal output p-norm. It then follows that the additivity and\nmultiplicativity conjectures for these measures of optimal output purity hold\nfor a product of channels if and only if they also hold for the product of\ntheir conjugates.

Abstract: In loving memory of Asher Peres, we discuss a most important and influential\npaper written in 1935 by his thesis supervisor and mentor Nathan Rosen,\ntogether with Albert Einstein and Boris Podolsky. In that paper, the trio known\nas EPR questioned the completeness of quantum mechanics. The authors argued\nthat the then-new theory should not be considered final because they believed\nit incapable of describing physical reality. The epic battle between Einstein\nand Bohr intensified following the latter's response later the same year. Three\ndecades elapsed before John S. Bell gave a devastating proof that the EPR\nargument was fatally flawed. The modest purpose of our paper is to give a\ncritical analysis of the original EPR paper and point out its logical\nshortcomings in a way that could have been done 70 years ago, with no need to\nwait for Bell's theorem. We also present an overview of Bohr's response in the\ninterest of showing how it failed to address the gist of the EPR argument. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0701124", "contents": "Title: Entanglement and Subsystems, Entanglement beyond Subsystems, and All\n  That Abstract: Entanglement plays a pervasive role nowadays throughout quantum information\nscience, and at the same time provides a bridging notion between quantum\ninformation science and fields as diverse as condensed-matter theory, quantum\ngravity, and quantum foundations. In recent years, a notion of ''Generalized\nEntanglement'' (GE) has emerged, based on the idea that entanglement may be\ndirectly defined through expectation values of preferred observables -- without\nreference to a preferred subsystem decomposition. Preferred observables capture\nthe physically relevant point of view, as defined by dynamical, operational, or\nfundamental constraints. While reducing to the standard entanglement notion\nwhen preferred observables are restricted to arbitrary local observables acting\non individual subsystems, GE substantially expands subsystem-based entanglement\ntheories, in terms of both conceptual foundations and range of applicability.\nRemarkably, the GE framework allows for non-trivial entanglement to exist\nwithin a single, indecomposable quantum system, demands in general a\ndistinction between quantum separability and absence of entanglement, and\nnaturally extends to situations where existing approaches may not be directly\nuseful -- such as entanglement in arbitrary convex-cones settings and\nentanglement for indistinguishable quantum particles. In this paper, we revisit\nthe main motivations leading to GE, and summarize the accomplishments and\nprospects of the GE program to date, with an eye toward conceptual developments\nand implications. In particular, we explain how the GE approach both shares\nstrong points of contact with abstract operational quantum theories and,\nultimately, calls for an observer-dependent redefinition of concepts like\nlocality, completeness, and reality in quantum theory. \n\n"}
