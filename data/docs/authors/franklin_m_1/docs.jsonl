{"id": "0704.1049", "contents": "Title: Charmless Three-body Decays of B Mesons Abstract: Charmless 3-body decays of B mesons are studied in the framework of the\nfactorization approach. The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S}$\ndecay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective\n$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct\nCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the\nlatter. (iii) For $B\\to K\\pi\\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonant\ncontributions in $K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\bar K^0\\pi^+\\pi^-$ modes, in agreement\nwith the Belle measurements but larger than the BaBar result. \n\n"}

Unlike the often studied Z' cases, in this framework, there are\nthree neutral gauge bosons due to the underlying SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_X\ngauge group in the bulk. Furthermore, couplings of these KK states to light\nquarks and leptons are suppressed, whereas those to top and bottom quarks are\nenhanced compared to the SM gauge couplings. Therefore, the production of light\nquark and lepton states is suppressed relative to other beyond the SM\nconstructions, and the fermionic decays of these states are dominated by the\ntop and bottom quarks, which are, though, overwhelmed by KK gluons dominantly\ndecaying into them.

It is completely determined by the mixing parameter (which\nis actually determined in the minimal theory) -- and it is otherwise\nmodel-(compactification-) independent. We discuss the string signal cross\nsections as well as the QCD background. The present analysis takes into account\nthe recently obtained decay widths of first Regge recurrences, which are\nnecessary for more precise determination of these cross sections in the\nresonant region. A vital part of the background discussion concerns the\nminimization of misidentified \\pi^0's emerging from high-p_\\perp jets. We show\nthat even for relatively small mixing, 100 fb^-1 of LHC data could probe\ndeviations from standard model physics associated with TeV-scale strings at a\n5\\sigma significance, for M_{\\rm string} as large as 2.3 TeV. It is also likely\nthat resonant bumps could be observed with approximately the same\nsignal-to-noise ratio. \n\n"}

The LSST design is\ndriven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking\nan inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and\nmapping the Milky Way.

The most basic \"top-tag\" method based on jet mass\nmeasurement is considered in detail. To analyze the top-tagging method,\ntheoretical and experimental aspects of the QCD jet background are examined.\nBased on QCD factorization, we derive a simple analytic approximation for the\nshape of the QCD jet mass spectrum. We observe a good agreement with the Monte\nCarlo simulation.

We consider the detailed predictions of these\nmodels for the invariant mass and rapidity distributions of the asymmetry at\nthe parton level, comparing against the unfolded parton-level CDF results.\nWhile all models can reproduce the asymmetry with the appropriate choice of\nmass and couplings, it appears at first examination that the extracted\nparton-level invariant mass distribution for all models are in conflict with\nTevatron observations. We show on closer examination, however, that t tbar\nevents in Z'_H and W' models have considerably lower selection efficiencies in\nhigh invariant mass bins as compared to the Standard Model, so that W', Z'_H,\nand axigluon models can generate the observed asymmetry while being consistent\nwith the total cross-section and invariant mass spectrum.

The energy in a neutrino beam, however,\nis broadly smeared so that the neutrino energy in a particular event is not\ndirectly known, but must be reconstructed from final state properties. In this\npaper we investigate the contributions from different reaction mechanisms on\nthe energy-reconstruction method widely used in long-baseline neutrino\nexperiments. Difference between the true-QE and QE-like cross sections in\nMiniBooNE experiment is investigated in details. It is shown, that fake QE-like\nevents lead to significant distortions in neutrino energy reconstruction.\nFlux-folded and unfolded cross sections for QE-like scattering are calculated\nas functions of both true and reconstructed energies. Flux-folded momentum\ntransfer distributions are calculated as functions of both true and\nreconstructed momentum transfer. Distributions versus reconstructed values are\ncompared with the experimental data. Also presented are the conditional\nprobability densities of finding a true energy for a given reconstructed\nenergy. It is shown, how the energy reconstruction procedure influences the\nmeasurement of oscillation parameters in T2K experiment. For the reconstruction\nprocedure based on quasielastic (QE) kinematics, all other reaction channels\nbeside true-QE scattering show a shift of the reconstructed energy towards\nlower values as compared to the true energy. On average in the MiniBooNE and\nT2K experiments the shift is 100 - 200 MeV and depends on energy. The\noscillation signals are similarly affected. These uncertainties may limit the\nextraction of a CP violating phase from an oscillation result. \n\n"}

Abstract: The dominant decay mode of standard model Higgs at 126 GeV $b\\bar{b}$ suffers\nfrom severe SM background at the LHC even in associated productions $Wh_{\\rm\nSM}$ or $Z h_{\\rm SM}$. The precision measurement of BR($\\phi\\to b\\bar{b})$\nrequires more data to reduce its large error bar. We investigate the\npossibility of this channel with largest uncertainty not dominating the decay\nof Higgs-like boson discovered at the LHC. In such scenarios, the Higgs signal\nshows highly suppressed $b\\bar{b}$, slightly reduced $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ and\nmoderately enhanced gauge bosons comparing with the SM predictions. The model\nrequires two different sources of electroweak symmetry breaking and radiative\ncorrection to $m_{b}$ strongly enhanced. However, large reduction in $b\\bar{b}$\nusually results large enhancement in $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ mode in particular. The\nreduction of $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ therefore implies that a new decay mode is\ninevitable. We find that a non-decoupling MSSM Higgs decay into lighter Higgs\n$H\\to hh$ may fit the signature.

Abstract: Since its first observation in 2005, the vector charmonium $Y(4260)$ has\nturned out to be one of the prime candidates for an exotic state in the\ncharmonium spectrum. It was recently proposed that the $Y(4260)$ should have a\nprominent $D_1\\bar{D}+c.c.$ molecular component that is strongly correlated\nwith the production of the charged $Z_c(3900)$. In this paper we demonstrate\nthat the nontrivial cross section line shapes of $e^+e^-\\to J/\\psi\\pi\\pi$ and\n$h_c\\pi\\pi$ can be naturally explained by the molecular scenario. As a\nconsequence we find a significantly smaller mass for the $Y(4260)$ than\nprevious studied. In the $e^+e^-\\to \\bar D D^*\\pi+c.c.$ process, with the\ninclusion of an additional $S$-wave $\\bar D^*\\pi$ contribution constrained\n  from data on the $D\\bar D^*$ invariant mass distribution, we obtain a good\nagreement with the data of the angular distributions. We also predict an\nunusual line shape of $Y(4260)$ in this channel that may serve as a smoking gun\nfor a predominantly molecular nature of $Y(4260)$. Improved measurements of\nthese observables are therefore crucial for a better understanding of the\nstructure of this famous resonance. \n\n"}

Precise experimental measurements of the Higgs couplings at the LHC\nand at the proposed next-generation facilities will allow for a robust test of\nthe phase transition dynamics. To illustrate this point, in this paper we focus\non the scenario in which loops of a new scalar field are responsible for the\nfirst-order phase transition, and study a selection of benchmark models with\nvarious SM gauge quantum numbers of the new scalar. We find that the current\nLHC measurement of the Higgs coupling to gluons already excludes the\npossibility of a first-order phase transition induced by a scalar in a sextet,\nor larger, representation of the SU(3)_c. Future LHC experiments (including\nHL-LHC) will be able to definitively probe the case when the new scalar is a\ncolor triplet.

If such a prediction is possible, we\ncorrespondingly propose a prediction in this study that the thermal radiation\nappears in the inertial frame from an electron heated by the Unruh effect in\nthe accelerating frame. The point in our prediction is, although the Unruh\neffect is only in the accelerating frame, if the appearance of the Brownian\nmotion rooted in the Unruh effect in the inertial frame can be predicted, the\nheat that the particle gets in its body by the Unruh effect in the accelerating\nframe could survive in the inertial frame.

Using these\nsymmetry properties and the chiral structure of weak interactions, we find that\nhalf of the Feynman diagrams responsible for internal $W$-emission cancel.\nSince this feature holds in the charmless modes but not in the charmful ones,\nwe advocate that the partial cancellation accounts for the smallness of the\ntree-dominated charmless two-body baryonic $B$ decays. This also explains why\nmost previous model calculations predicted too large rates as the above\nconsideration was not taken into account. Finally, we emphasize that, contrary\nto the claim in the literature, the internal $W$-emission tree amplitude should\nbe proportional to the Wilson coefficient $c_1+c_2$ rather than $c_1-c_2$. \n\n"}

It is the last but very important\nmissing ingredient of the standard model. Therefore, searching for the Higgs\nboson is a crucial task and an important mission of particle physics. For this\npurpose, many theoretical works have been done and different experiments have\nbeen organized. It may be said in particular that to search for the Higgs boson\nhas been one of the ultimate goals of building and running the LHC, the world's\nlargest and most powerful particle accelerator, at CERN, which is a great\ncombination of science and technology.

The main\nfeature of these processes is that the scattered lepton is not observed, so\nthat the hard scale that makes them perturbative is set by the transverse\nmomentum of the hadron or jet.

From this state of\naffairs arises the need for a consistent theoretical framework in which\ndeviations from the SM predictions can be calculated and compared to precision\nmeasurements. Such a framework should be able to comprehensively make use of\nall measurements in all sectors of particle physics, including LHC Higgs\nmeasurements, past electroweak precision data, electric dipole moment, $g-2$,\npenguins and flavor physics, neutrino scattering, deep inelastic scattering,\nlow-energy $e^{+}e^{-}$ scattering, mass measurements, and any search for\nphysics beyond the SM.

First, for\nprobabilistic query evaluation, we show that MSO tractability cannot extend\nbeyond bounded treewidth: there are even FO queries that are hard on any\nefficiently constructible unbounded-treewidth class of graphs. This dichotomy\nrelies on recent polynomial bounds on the extraction of planar graphs as\nminors, and implies lower bounds in non-probabilistic settings, for query\nevaluation and match counting in subinstance-closed families.

The bino\npartner pseudoscalar is identified as the 750 GeV resonance, while\nsuperpotential interactions between it and the gluino (wino) partners yield\nproduction via gluon fusion (decay to photon pairs) at one-loop. The gauginos\nand these additional adjoint superpartners are married by a Dirac mass and must\nalso have Majorana masses. While a large wino partner Majorana mass is\nnecessary to explain the excess, the gluino can be approximately Dirac-like,\nproviding benefits consistent with being both \"supersoft\" (loop corrections to\nthe scalar masses from Dirac gauginos are free of logarithmic enhancements) and\n\"supersafe\" (the experimental limits on the squark/gluino masses can be relaxed\ndue to the reduced production rate). Consistency with the measured Standard\nModel-like Higgs boson mass is imposed, and a numerical exploration of the\nparameter space is provided.

To date, the Herschel Science Archive does not contain the exact sky\ncoverage (footprint) of individual observations and supports search for\nmeasurements based on bounding circles only. Drawing on previous experience in\nimplementing footprint databases, we built the Herschel Footprint Database and\nWeb Services for the Herschel Space Observatory to provide efficient search\ncapabilities for typical astronomical queries. The database was designed with\nthe following main goals in mind: (a) provide a unified data model for\nmeta-data of all instruments and observational modes, (b) quickly find\nobservations covering a selected object and its neighbourhood, (c) quickly find\nevery observation in a larger area of the sky, (d) allow for finding solar\nsystem objects crossing observation fields.

Models, languages, and tools, that allow to obtain\nvaluable information efficiently, are thus required. Multidimensional data are\ntypically represented as data cubes, and exploited using Online Analytical\nProcessing (OLAP) techniques. The RDF Data Cube Vocabulary, also denoted QB, is\nthe current W3C standard to represent statistical data on the SW.Since QB does\nnot include key features needed for OLAP analysis, in previous work we have\nproposed an extension, denoted QB4OLAP, to overcome this problem without the\nneed of modifying already published data. Once data cubes are represented on\nthe SW, we need tools to analyze them. However, writing efficient analytical\nqueries over SW cubes demands a deep knowledge of RDF and SPARQL. These skills\nare not common in typical analytical users. Also, OLAP languages like MDX are\nfar from being easily understood by the final user. The lack of friendly tools\nto exploit multidimensional data on the SW is a barrier that needs to be broken\nto promote the publication of such data. We address this problem in this paper.\nOur approach is based on allowing analytical users to write queries using OLAP\noperations over cubes, without dealing with SW standards. For this, we devised\nCQL (standing for Cube Query Language), a simple, high-level query language\nthat operates over cubes.

Then, we propose query improvement strategies to\nproduce efficient SPARQL queries, adapting SPARQL query optimization\ntechniques. We evaluate our approach using the Star-Schema benchmark, showing\nthat our proposal outperforms others.

However, these techniques\nare time consuming and their convergence to the posterior could be difficult to\ndetermine. In this work, we advocate Variational inference as an alternative to\nsolve the above problems, and demonstrate its usefulness for parameter\nestimation and model selection in Astrophysics. Variational inference converts\nthe inference problem into an optimization problem by approximating the\nposterior from a known family of distributions and using Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence to characterize the difference. It takes advantage of fast\noptimization techniques, which make it ideal to deal with large datasets and\nmakes it trivial to parallelize on a multicore platform. We also derive a new\napproximate evidence estimation based on variational posterior, and importance\nsampling technique called posterior weighted importance sampling for the\ncalculation of evidence (PWISE), which is useful to perform Bayesian model\nselection. As a proof of principle, we apply variational inference to five\ndifferent problems in astrophysics, where Monte Carlo techniques were\npreviously used. These include assessment of significance of annual modulation\nin the COSINE-100 dark matter experiment, measuring exoplanet orbital\nparameters from radial velocity data, tests of periodicities in measurements of\nNewton's constant $G$, assessing the significance of a turnover in the spectral\nlag data of GRB 160625B and estimating the mass of a galaxy cluster using weak\ngravitational lensing. We find that variational inference is much faster than\nMCMC and nested sampling techniques for most of these problems while providing\ncompetitive results.

It supports several\ndifferent ways of integrating $k$-NN algorithms, and its configuration system\nautomatically tests a range of parameter settings for each algorithm.\nAlgorithms are compared with respect to many different (approximate) quality\nmeasures, and adding more is easy and fast; the included plotting front-ends\ncan visualise these as images, $\\LaTeX$ plots, and websites with interactive\nplots. ANN-Benchmarks aims to provide a constantly updated overview of the\ncurrent state of the art of $k$-NN algorithms.

The commoditization of high-performance networking makes\ndata shipping possible, where the coordinator directly reads data in the\nworkers' memory using RDMA while workers process other queries.

In order to increase the energy or reduce the size of the\naccelerator, new acceleration schemes need to be developed. Plasma wakefield\nacceleration, in which the electrons in a plasma are excited, leading to strong\nelectric fields, is one such promising novel acceleration technique. Pioneering\nexperiments have shown that an intense laser pulse or electron bunch traversing\na plasma, drives electric fields of 10s GV/m and above. These values are well\nbeyond those achieved in conventional RF accelerators which are limited to ~0.1\nGV/m. A limitation of laser pulses and electron bunches is their low stored\nenergy, which motivates the use of multiple stages to reach very high energies.\nThe use of proton bunches is compelling, as they have the potential to drive\nwakefields and accelerate electrons to high energy in a single accelerating\nstage. The long proton bunches currently available can be used, as they undergo\nself-modulation, a particle-plasma interaction which longitudinally splits the\nbunch into a series of high density microbunches, which then act resonantly to\ncreate large wakefields. The AWAKE experiment at CERN uses intense bunches of\nprotons, each of energy 400 GeV, with a total bunch energy of 19 kJ, to drive a\nwakefield in a 10 m long plasma. Bunches of electrons are injected into the\nwakefield formed by the proton microbunches. This paper presents measurements\nof electrons accelerated up to 2 GeV at AWAKE. This constitutes the first\ndemonstration of proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. The potential for\nthis scheme to produce very high energy electron bunches in a single\naccelerating stage means that the results shown here are a significant step\ntowards the development of future high energy particle accelerators. \n\n"}

The second scenario is that of multi-agent games, in\nwhich the state is global and rewards are local. In this scenario, agents\ncollaborate to estimate the value function of a target team policy. The\nproposed algorithm combines off-policy learning, eligibility traces and linear\nfunction approximation. The proposed algorithm is of the variance-reduced kind\nand achieves linear convergence with $O(1)$ memory requirements. The linear\nconvergence of the algorithm is established analytically, and simulations are\nused to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. \n\n"}

The assumption made at the Tevatron is that the spectator parton\ninteraction energy is similar to the ambient level measured in minimum bias\nevents. In this paper, we test this assumption by measuring the ambient charged\ntrack momentum in events containing large transverse energy jets at\n$\\sqrt{s}=1800$ GeV and $\\sqrt{s}=630$ GeV and comparing this ambient momentum\nwith that observed both in minimum bias events and with that predicted by two\nMonte Carlo models.

In\nthis scenario, the production via $q \\bar{q}$ annihilation and decays to the\nconventional photon and lepton channels are highly suppressed. However, we show\nthat graviton production via gluon fusion followed by decay to longitudinal\n$Z/W$ can be significant; vector boson fusion is found to be a sub-dominant\nproduction mode. In particular, the ``golden'' $ZZ$ decay mode offers a\ndistinctive 4-lepton signal that could lead to the observation at the LHC with\n300 fb$^{-1}$ (SLHC with 3 ab$^{-1}$) of a KK graviton with a mass up to $\\sim\n2$ ($\\sim 3$) TeV for the ratio of the AdS$_5$ curvature to the Planck scale\nmodestly above unity.

A model of irradiated silicon based upon two defect levels with\nopposite charge states and the trapping of charge carriers can be tuned to\nproduce a good description of the measured charge collection profiles in the\nfluence range from 0.5x10^{14} Neq/cm^2 to 5.9x10^{14} Neq/cm^2. The model\ncorrectly predicts the variation in the profiles as the temperature is changed\nfrom -10C to -25C. The measured charge collection profiles are inconsistent\nwith the linearly-varying electric fields predicted by the usual description\nbased upon a uniform effective doping density. This observation calls into\nquestion the practice of using effective doping densities to characterize\nirradiated silicon. \n\n"}
