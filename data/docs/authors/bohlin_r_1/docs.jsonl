Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

It was originally estimated that only one or two\nof the essential evolutionary steps had to have been hard in this sense, but it\nhas become apparent that this figure may need upward revision, because recent\nstudies of climatic instability suggest that the possible future duration of\nour biologically favourable environment may be shorter than had been supposed,\nonly about one Giga year rather than five. On the basis of the statistical\nrequirement of roughly equal spacing between hard steps, it is argued that the\nbest fit with the fossil record is now obtainable by postulating the number of\nhard steps to be five, if our evolution was exclusively terrestrial, or six if,\nas now seems very plausible, the first step occurred on Mars. \n\n"}

No absorption features at\nnegative velocities strongly argue against the widely-used large distance of 19\nto 21 kpc for Kes 75, and show that Kes 75 is within the Solar circle, i.e. a\ndistance $d<$13.2 kpc.

Indeed, merely a single case of a star-planet-disk\nsystem has previously been detected at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths.\nConsequently, one of our aims is to understand the reasons for these poor\nstatistics, i.e., whether these results reflected the composition and/or the\nphysics of the planetary disks or were simply due to observational bias and\nselection effects. Finding more examples would be very significant. The\nselected target, q1 Eri, is a solar-type star, which was known to possess a\nplanet, q1 Eri b, and to exhibit excess emission at IRAS wavelengths, but had\nremained undetected in the millimeter regime. Therefore, submm flux densities\nwould be needed to better constrain the physical characteristics of the\nplanetary disk. Consequently, we performed submm imaging observations of q1\nEri. The detected dust toward q1 Eri at 870 micron exhibits the remarkable fact\nthat the entire SED, from the IR to mm-wavelengths, is fit by a single\ntemperature blackbody function (60 K). This would imply that the emitting\nregions are confined to a narrow region (ring) at radial distances much larger\nthan the orbital distance of q1 Eri b, and that the emitting particles are\nconsiderably larger than some hundred micron. However, the 870 micron source is\nextended, with a full-width-half-maximum of roughly 600 AU. Therefore, a\nphysically more compelling model also invokes a belt of cold dust (17 K),\nlocated at 300 AU from the star and about 60 AU wide.

Although the IMOs reveal\nslightly higher virial-to-stellar mass ratios than lower mass GCs, this may\nsimply reflect our limited understanding of their IMF (and hence their stellar\nmass-to-light ratios) or structural properties. We argue that most of these\nintermediate mass objects are a natural extension of the GC sequence to higher\nmasses, i.e. IMOs are essentially massive star clusters. [Abridged]. \n\n"}

Such binaries form after major galaxy\nmergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering\nbecomes very inefficient at sub-parsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary\ndynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the orbits of binaries embedded within\ngeometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly resolve angular momentum\ntransport within the disc, which at the radii of interest is likely dominated\nby disc self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good\nagreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation\nof eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e > 0.35. Accretion onto\nthe black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital\nfrequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of\nbinary decay that is possible without fragmentation occuring within the\nsurrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar\ndynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 10^5 < M/Msun < 10^8\nwe find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a ~\n0.01--0.1 pc, where the disc is optically thick.

Dark matter particles that end up within two virial\nradii of a Milky-Way-sized DM halo at $z=0$ have an approximately Gaussian\ndistribution in log(f) at early redshifts, but the distribution becomes\nincreasingly skewed at lower redshifts. The value corresponding to the peak of\nthe Gaussian decreases as the evolution progresses and is well described by a\npower-law in (1+z). The highest values of f are found at the centers of dark\nmatter halos and subhalos, where f can be an order of magnitude higher than in\nthe center of the main halo.

Most of the the PM stars and BDs are\nejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these\nstars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years\nthe Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and\ntwo much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.\nThere is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs\ntend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be\nscattered even further out, or even into the field. BDs form with discs of a\nfew Mj and radii of a few tens of AU, and they are more likely to retain these\ndiscs if they remain bound to the primary star.

Astrophysical constraints are not\nconsidered in the present paper. The bounds on the lifetime of decaying dark\nmatter are dominated by either the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect for\nthe scenario with weak reionization, or CMB polarization observations when\nthere is significant reionization. For the respective scenarios, the lifetimes\nfor decaying dark matter are $\\Gamma^{-1} \\gtrsim 100$ Gyr and $ (f \\Gamma)\n^{-1} \\gtrsim 5.3 \\times 10^8$ Gyr (at 95.4% confidence level), where the\nphenomenological parameter $f$ is the fraction of the decay energy deposited in\nbaryonic gas.

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers\nafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably\ndissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be\napproximately proportional to the increase in mass.

First, giant stars\nwith planets do not show a metallicity distribution skewed towards metal-rich\nobjects, as found for dwarfs. Second, the correlation with metallicity is not\nvalid at intermediate metallicities, for which it can be shown that giant\nplanets are preferentially found orbiting thick disk stars.\n  None of these two peculiarities is explained by the proposed scenarios of\ngiant planet formation. We contend that they are galactic in nature, and\nprobably not linked to the formation process of giant planets.

This implies that, at z ~ 0, or at low luminosity AGN levels,\nthere is an anti-correlation between Gamma and L/Ledd, opposite to the trend\nexhibited by high z AGN (quasars). The turning point in the Gamma -L/Ledd LLAGN\n+ quasars relation occurs near Gamma ~ 1.5 and L/Ledd ~ 0.01.

First, a\nkinematical model is constructed for SN Ia 2003hv, which can account for the\nmain features in its optical, Near-Infrared (NIR), and Mid-Infrared (Mid-IR)\nlate-time spectra. It is found that an asymmetric off-center model can explain\nthe observed characteristics of SN 2003hv. This model includes a relatively\nhigh density, Fe-rich region which displays a large velocity off-set, and a\nrelatively low density, extended 56Ni-rich region which is more spherically\ndistributed. The high density region consists of the inner stable Fe-Ni region\nand outer 56Ni-rich region. Such a distribution may be the result of a\ndelayed-detonation explosion, in which the first deflagration produces the\nglobal asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, while the subsequent detonation can\nlead to the bulk spherical symmetry. This configuration, if viewed from the\ndirection of the off-set, can consistently explain the blueshift in some of the\nemission lines and virtually no observed shift in other lines in SN 2003hv. For\nthis model, we then explore the effects of different viewing angles and the\nimplications for SNe Ia in general. The model predicts that a variation of the\ncentral wavelength, depending on the viewing angle, should be seen in some\nlines (e.g., [Ni II]7378), while the strongest lines (e.g., [Fe III] blend at\n4700A) will not show this effect.

The X-ray spectrum of 1ES 1210-646 is described using a simple powerlaw\nshape or, in the case of INTEGRAL data, with a blackbody plus powerlaw model.\nSpectral variability is found in connection with different flux levels of the\nsource. A strong and transient iron emission line with an energy of about 6.7\nkeV and an equivalent width of about 1.6 keV is detected when the source is\nfound at an intermediate flux level. The line strength seems to be tied to the\norbital motion of the accreting object, as this feature is only apparent at the\nperiastron. Although the X-ray spectral description we find for the 1ES\n1210-646 emission is quite atypical for a high-mass X-ray binary, the\nmultiwavelegth information available for this object leads us to confirm this\nclassification. The results presented here allow us instead to definitely rule\nout the possibility that 1ES 1210-646 is a (magnetic) cataclysmic variable as\nproposed previously and, in a broader sense, a white dwarf nature for the\naccretor is disfavoured. X-ray spectroscopic data actually suggest a neutron\nstar with a low magnetic field as the accreting object in this system. \n\n"}

Observations of copper abundances rely on a very limited\nnumber of lines, the strongest are the Cu I lines of Mult. 1 at 324.7 nm and\n327.3 nm which can be measured even at extremely low metallicities. Aims. We\ninvestigate the quality of these lines as abundance indicators. Method. We\nmeasure these lines in two turn-off (TO) stars in the Globular Cluster NGC 6752\nand two TO stars in the Globular Cluster NGC 6397 and derive abundances with 3D\nhydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the CO5BOLD code. These\nabundances are compared to the Cu abundances measured in giant stars of the\nsame clusters, using the lines of Mult. 2 at 510.5 nm and 578.2 nm. Results.\nThe abundances derived from the lines of Mult. 1 in TO stars differ from the\nabundances of giants of the same clusters. This is true both using CO5BOLD\nmodels and using traditional 1D model atmospheres. The LTE 3D corrections for\nTO stars are large, while they are small for giant stars. Conclusions. The Cu I\nresonance lines of Mult. 1 are not reliable abundance indicators. It is likely\nthat departures from LTE should be taken into account to properly describe\nthese lines, although it is not clear if these alone can account for the\nobservations.

The\ncommon for both of these models is the same equations of state in our three\ndimensions and in the extra dimensions. All dimensions are treated at equal\nfooting.

We combine cosmological\nsimulations of large scale structure formation with a detailed model of metal\nenrichment, in which outflows expand anisotropically along the direction of\nleast resistance, distributing metals into the IGM. The metals carried by the\noutflows are generated by two separate stellar populations: stars located near\nthe central AGN, and stars located in the greater galaxy. Using this algorithm,\nwe performed a series of 5 simulations of the propagation of AGN-driven\noutflows in a cosmological volume of size (128/h Mpc)^3 in a Lambda-CDM\nuniverse, and analyze the resulting metal enrichment of the IGM. We found that\nthe metallicity induced in the IGM is greatly dominated by AGNs having\nbolometric luminosity L > 10^9 L_sun, sources with 10^8 < L / L_sun < 10^9\nhaving a negligible contribution. Our simulations produced an average IGM\nmetallicity of [O/H] = -5 at z = 5.5, which then rises gradually, and remains\nrelatively flat at a value [O/H] = -2.8 between z = 2 and z = 0.

We find that the average LAT gamma-ray spectrum of\nMrk 501 can be well described by a single power-law function with a photon\nindex of 1.78 +/- 0.03. While we observe relatively mild flux variations with\nthe Fermi-LAT (within less than a factor of 2), we detect remarkable spectral\nvariability where the hardest observed spectral index within the LAT energy\nrange is 1.52 +/- 0.14, and the softest one is 2.51 +/- 0.20.

Importantly,\nthese environments consist just of electrons and ions and the dissipated energy\nalways stays with the plasma. In contrast, in this paper I introduce a new\ndirection of research, motivated by several important problems in high-energy\nastrophysics --- reconnection in high energy density (HED) radiative plasmas,\nwhere radiation pressure and radiative cooling become dominant factors in the\npressure and energy balance. I identify the key processes distinguishing HED\nreconnection: special-relativistic effects; radiative effects (radiative\ncooling, radiation pressure, and Compton resistivity); and, at the most extreme\nend, QED effects, including pair creation. I then discuss the main\nastrophysical applications --- situations with magnetar-strength fields\n(exceeding the quantum critical field of about 4 x 10^13 G): giant SGR flares\nand magnetically-powered central engines and jets of GRBs.

We deduce new\nmodels of the present Sun, their associated neutrino fluxes, and their internal\nsound-speed profile. This approach sheds quantitative lights on the\ndisagreement between the sound speed obtained by helioseismology and the sound\nspeed derived from the SSM including the updated photospheric CNO abundances,\nbased on recent observations. We conclude that about 20% of the present\ndiscrepancy could come from the incorrect description of the early phases of\nthe Sun, its activity, its initial mass and mass-loss history.

Apparent\n  Radii Abstract: The masses and radii of low-magnetic field neutron stars can be measured by\ncombining different observable quantities obtained from their X-ray spectra\nduring thermonuclear X-ray bursts. One of these quantities is the apparent\nradius of each neutron star as inferred from the X-ray flux and spectral\ntemperature measured during the cooling tails of bursts, when the thermonuclear\nflash is believed to have engulfed the entire star. In this paper, we analyze\n13,095 X-ray spectra of 446 X-ray bursts observed from 12 sources in order to\nassess possible systematic effects in the measurements of the apparent radii of\nneutron stars. We first show that the vast majority of the observed X-ray\nspectra are consistent with blackbody functions to within a few percent. We\nfind that most X-ray bursts follow a very well determined correlation between\nX-ray flux and temperature, which is consistent with the whole neutron-star\nsurface emitting uniformly during the cooling tails. We develop a Bayesian\nGaussian mixture algorithm to measure the apparent radii of the neutron stars\nin these sources, while detecting and excluding a small number of X-ray bursts\nthat show irregular cooling behavior. This algorithm also provides us with a\nquantitative measure of the systematic uncertainties in the measurements. We\nfind that those errors in the spectroscopic determination of neutron-star radii\nthat are introduced by systematic effects in the cooling tails of X-ray bursts\nare in the range $\\simeq 3-8$%. Such small errors are adequate to distinguish\nbetween different equations of state provided that uncertainties in the\ndistance to each source and the absolute calibration of X-ray detectors do not\ndominate the error budget. \n\n"}

The data are from our proper-motion (PM) survey of Kapteyn's\nSelected Areas, in which we have measured accurate PMs to faint magnitudes in\n40x40 arcmin fields evenly spaced across the sky. The radial velocity (RV)\nsignature of Sgr has been identified among our follow-up spectroscopic data in\nfour of the six fields and combined with mean PMs of\nspectroscopically-confirmed members to derive space motions of Sgr debris based\non 15-64 confirmed stream members per field. These kinematics are compared to\npredictions of the Law & Majewski (2010) model of Sgr disruption; we find\nreasonable agreement with model predictions in RVs and PMs along Galactic\nlatitude. However, an upward adjustment of the Local Standard of Rest velocity\nTheta_LSR from its standard 220 km/s to at least $232\\pm14$ km/s (and possibly\nas high as $264\\pm23$ km/s) is necessary to bring 3-D model debris kinematics\nand our measurements into agreement.

The optimization is performed by\nminimizing several volume integrals which would vanish for an exact\nRobertson-Walker metric. Covariance is automatic. Foliation of space-time is\npart of the optimization procedure. Only the metric is involved in the\nprocedure, no assumptions about the origin of the energy-momentum tensor are\nneeded. A scale factor does not show up during the optimization process, the\noptimal scale factor is determined at the end. The general formulation is non\nperturbative. An explicit perturbative treatment is possible. The shifts which\nlead to the optimal coordinates obey Euler-Lagrange equations which are\nformulated and solved in first order of the perturbation. The extension to\nsecond order is sketched, but turns out to be unnecessary. The only freedom in\nthe choice of coordinates which finally remains are the rigid transformations\nwhich keep the form of the Robertson-Walker metric intact, i.e. translations in\nspace and time, spatial rotations, and spatial scaling.

Physical and kinematical\ndifferences can be seen at the two shocked positions. At the R4 position, two\nvelocity components with different excitation can be distinguished, with the\ncomponent at higher velocity (R4-HV) being less extended and less dense than\nthe low velocity component (R4-LV).

The\nhydrodynamics of the interaction between a jet and a clumpy wind is studied,\nfocusing on the global wind and single clump-jet interplay. We have performed,\nusing the code \\textit{Ratpenat}, three-dimensional numerical simulations of a\nclumpy wind interacting with a mildly relativistic jet, and of individual\nclumps penetrating into a jet. For typical wind and jet velocities, filling\nfactors of about > 0.1 are already enough for the wind to be considered as\nclumpy. An inhomogeneous wind makes the jet more unstable when crossing the\nsystem. Kinetic luminosities of the order 1.e37 erg/s allow the jet to reach\nthe borders of a compact binary with an O star, as in the smooth wind case,\nalthough with a substantially higher degree of disruption. When able to enter\ninto the jet, clumps are compressed and heated during a time of about their\nsize divided by the sound speed in the shocked clump.

One of the key questions is how\nthese disks form so close to their host black holes and under what condition\nthey form stars in a tidally stressed environment.

This suggests that the majority of them either are not blazars\nor have spectral energy distributions contaminated by their host galaxies. A\nsignificant fraction of true blazars are found to be hosted by star-forming\ngalaxies.

For the stellar core collapse simulation, we present the\nlatest numerical results. We employed a purely nucleonic EOS (Shen-EOS). As an\ninitial condition, we adopted a 100 $M_{\\odot}$ presupernova model calculated\nby Umeda and Nomoto. Changing the degree of rotation for the initial condition,\nwe clarify the strong dependence of the outcome of the collapse on this. When\nthe rotation is rapid enough, the shock wave formed at the core bounce is\ndeformed to be a torus-like shape. Then, the infalling matter is accumulated in\nthe central region due to the oblique shock at the torus surface, hitting the\nPNS and dissipating the kinetic energy there. As a result, outflows can be\nlaunched. The PNS eventually collapses to a BH and an accretion torus is formed\naround it. We also found that the evolution of the BH and torus depends\nstrongly on the rotation initially given. In the BNS merger simulations, we in\naddition employ an EOS incorporating a degree of freedom for hyperons. The\nnumerical simulations show that for the purely nucleonic EOS, a HMNS with a\nlong lifetime ($\\gg 10$ ms) is the outcome for the total mass $M \\lesssim\n3.0M_{\\odot}$.

Assuming that the observed MIR\nemission is radiation from an accretion disk reprocessed in a surrounding dusty\ntorus that subtends a solid angle decreasing with increasing luminosity (as\ninferred from the declining fraction of obscured AGNs), the intrinsic disk\nluminosity, L_D, is approximately proportional to the luminosity of the corona\nin the 2-300 keV energy band, L_C, with the L_D/L_C ratio varying by a factor\nof 2.1 around a mean value of 1.6.

Four models are\nproposed, all based on the standard assumption that cores are randomly\norientated ellipsoids, and on the further assumption that a core's shape is not\ncorrelated with its absolute size. The first and simplest model, M1, has a\nsingle free parameter, and assumes that the relative axes of a core are drawn\nrandomly from a log-normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation\n\\sigma o. The second model, M2a, has two free parameters, and assumes that the\nlog-normal distribution (with standard deviation \\sigma o) has a finite mean,\n\\mu o, defined so that \\mu o<0 means elongated (prolate) cores are favoured,\nwhereas \\mu o>0 means flattened (oblate) cores are favoured.

Only\nthree confirmed novae and three SSSs have been discovered in globular clusters\n(GCs) of any galaxy so far, of which one nova and two SSSs (including the nova)\nwere found in M 31 GCs. To study the SSS state of CNe we carried out a\nhigh-cadence X-ray monitoring of the M 31 central area with XMM-Newton and\nChandra. We analysed X-ray and optical data of a new transient X-ray source in\nthe M 31 GC Bol 126, discovered serendipitously in Swift observations. Our\noptical data set was based on regular M 31 monitoring programmes from five\ndifferent small telescopes. Additionally, we made use of Pan-STARRS 1 data\nobtained during the PAndromeda survey. Our observations reveal that the X-ray\nsource in Bol 126 is the third SSS in an M 31 GC and can be confirmed as the\nsecond CN in the M 31 GC system. This nova is named M31N 2010-10f. Its\nproperties in the X-ray and optical regimes agree with a massive white dwarf\n(M_WD >~ 1.3 M_sun) in the binary system. Incorporating the data on previously\nfound (suspected) novae in M 31 GCs we used our high-cadence X-ray monitoring\nobservations to estimate a tentative nova rate in the M 31 GC system of 0.05\n/yr/GC. An optical estimate, based on the recent 10.5-year WeCAPP survey, gives\na lower nova rate, which is compatible with the X-ray rate on the 95%\nconfidence level. There is growing evidence that the nova rate in GCs is higher\nthan expected from primordial binary formation and under conditions as in the\nfield. Dynamical binary formation and/or additional accretion from the\nintracluster medium are possible scenarios for an increased nova rate, but\nobservational confirmation for this enhancement has been absent, so far.\nRegular X-ray monitoring observations of M 31 provide a promising strategy to\nfind these novae. \n\n"}

This scenario is\nattractive for the progenitor systems of present-day massive globular clusters\n(GCs) which likely had masses M \\gtrsim 10^7\\msun. In such clusters, supernovae\nand stellar winds cannot provide a plausible explanation for the sudden removal\nof the primordial gas reservoir that is required to explain their complex\nchemical enrichment history.\n  In order to consider different regimes in the gas accretion rate onto\nstellar-mass BHs, we consider both the Bondi-Hoyle and Eddington\napproximations. For either model, our results show that the gas can be\nsignificantly depleted within only a few tens of Myrs. This process will affect\nthe distribution of BH masses, and may accelerate the dynamical decoupling of\nthe BH population and, ultimately, their dynamical ejection. Moreover, the\ntimescales for gas depletion are sufficiently short that the accreting BHs\ncould significantly affect the chemistry of subsequent star formation episodes.\n  The gas depletion times and final mass in BHs are sensitive to the assumed\nmodel for the accretion rate, and to the initial mass of the most massive BH\nwhich, in turn, is determined by the upper mass cut-off of the stellar IMF. Our\nresults imply that the remnant accretion history can have an important bearing\non the observed present-day cluster mass-to-light ratio.

The challenge is to\nquantitatively determine the range of temperatures and species abundances\nallowed by the data.

A variety of temperature and abundance\nretrieval approaches have been applied to exoplanet spectra, but no previous\ninvestigations have sought to compare these approaches. In this investigation\nwe compare three different retrieval methods: Optimal Estimation, Differential\nEvolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Bootstrap Monte Carlo.

It has\nbeen found that most O-stars are multiples. HD 150 136 is the nearest system to\nEarth with >100 M_sol, and provides a unique opportunity to study an extremely\nmassive system. Recently, evidence for the existence of a third component in HD\n150 136, in addition to the tight spectroscopic binary that forms the main\ncomponent, was found in spectroscopic observations. Our aim was to image and\nobtain astrometric and photometric measurements of this component using long\nbaseline optical interferometry to further constrain the nature of this\ncomponent. We observed HD150136 with the near-infrared instrument AMBER\nattached to the ESO VLT Interferometer. The recovered closure phases are robust\nto systematic errors and provide unique information on the source asymmetry.\nTherefore, they are of crucial relevance for both image reconstruction and\nmodel fitting of the source structure. The third component in HD 150 136 is\nclearly detected in the high-quality data from AMBER. It is located at a\nprojected angular distance of 7.3 mas, or about 13 AU at the line-of-sight\ndistance of HD 150 136, at a position angle of 209 degrees East of North, and\nhas a flux ratio of 0.25 with respect to the inner binary. We resolved the\nthird component of HD 150 136 in J, H and K filters. The luminosity and color\nof the tertiary agrees with the predictions and shows that it is also an O\nmain-sequence star.

Recent studies have reported relatively weak\ncorrelations between observed AGN luminosities and the properties of AGN hosts,\nwhich has been interpreted to imply that there is no direct connection between\nAGN activity and star formation. However, AGNs may be expected to vary\nsignificantly on a wide range of timescales (from hours to Myr) that are far\nshorter than the typical timescale for star formation (>~100 Myr). This\nvariability can have important consequences for observed correlations. We\npresent a simple model in which all star-forming galaxies host an AGN when\naveraged over ~100 Myr timescales, with long-term average AGN accretion rates\nthat are perfectly correlated with the star formation rate (SFR). We show that\nreasonable prescriptions for AGN variability reproduce the observed weak\ncorrelations between SFR and L_AGN in typical AGN host galaxies, as well as the\ngeneral trends in the observed AGN luminosity functions, merger fractions, and\nmeasurements of the average AGN luminosity as a function of SFR.

Our statistical sample of 100\nFirst Stars show that the first generation of stars have a wide mass\ndistribution M_popIII = 10 ~ 1000 M_sun. We first run cosmological simulations\nto generate a set of primordial star-forming gas clouds. We then follow\nprotostar formation in each gas cloud and the subsequent protostellar evolution\nuntil the gas mass accretion onto the protostar is halted by stellar radiative\nfeedback. The accretion rates differ significantly among the primordial gas\nclouds which largely determine the final stellar masses. For low accretion\nrates the growth of a protostar is self-regulated by radiative feedback effects\nand the final mass is limited to several tens of solar masses. At high\naccretion rates the protostar's outer envelope continues to expand and the\neffective surface temperature remains low; such protostars do not exert strong\nradiative feedback and can grow in excess to one hundred solar masses. The\nobtained wide mass range suggests that the first stars play a variety of roles\nin the early universe, by triggering both core-collapse supernovae and\npair-instability supernovae as well as by leaving stellar mass black holes. We\nfind certain correlations between the final stellar mass and the physical\nproperties of the star-forming cloud.

This uncertainty stems from a dearth of observational\nconstraints as well as the great dynamic range between the small scales (<1 pc)\nwhere the feedback occurs and the large scales of galaxies (>1 kpc) that are\nshaped by this feedback. To bridge this divide, in this paper we aim to assess\nobservationally the role of stellar feedback at the intermediate scales of HII\nregions. In particular, we employ multiwavelength data to examine several\nstellar feedback mechanisms in a sample of 32 HII regions in the Large and\nSmall Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively). Using optical, infrared,\nradio, and X-ray images, we measure the pressures exerted on the shells from\nthe direct stellar radiation, the dust-processed radiation, the warm ionized\ngas, and the hot X-ray emitting gas. We find that the warm ionized gas\ndominates over the other terms in all of the sources, although two have\ncomparable dust-processed radiation pressures to their warm gas pressures. The\nhot gas pressures are comparatively weak, while the direct radiation pressures\nare 1-2 orders of magnitude below the other terms.

The predicted SFR\ndensity and how much of this is contributed by galaxies with different stellar\nmasses and infrared luminosities are in agreement with observations. The model\npredicts a modest evolution of the HI density at z<3, which is also in\nagreement with the observations. The HI density is predicted to be always\ndominated by galaxies with SFR<1Msun/yr. This contrasts with the H2 density,\nwhich is predicted to be dominated by galaxies with SFR>10Msun/yr.

One component exhibits a sawtooth-like\nvelocity waveform while the other is nearly sinusoidal. One method of\ngenerating such a hybrid is presented: a nonlinear model is developed for the\nfirst overtone mode, which, if excited to large amplitude, is found to drop\nstrongly in frequency and become highly non-sinusoidal. If the frequency drops\nsufficiently to become equal to the fundamental frequency, the two can become\nphase locked and form the desired hybrid. A relationship is assumed between the\nhybrid mode velocity and the observed light curve, which is approximated as a\npower series. An accurate fit of the hybrid model is made to actual Kepler data\nfor RR Lyr. The sinusoidal component may tend to stabilize the period of the\nhybrid which is found in real Blazhko data to be extremely stable.

Abstract: Using idealized 1-D Eulerian hydrodynamic simulations, we contrast the\nbehavior of isolated supernovae with the superbubbles driven by multiple,\ncollocated supernovae. Continuous energy injection via successive supernovae\ngoing off within the hot/dilute bubble maintains a strong termination shock.\nThis strong shock keeps the superbubble over-pressured and drives the outer\nshock well after it becomes radiative. Isolated supernovae, in contrast, with\nno further energy injection, become radiative quite early ($\\lesssim 0.1$ Myr,\n10s of pc), and stall at scales $\\lesssim 100$ pc. We show that isolated\nsupernovae lose almost all of their mechanical energy by a Myr, but\nsuperbubbles can retain up to $\\sim 40\\%$ of the input energy in form of\nmechanical energy over the lifetime of the star cluster (few 10s of Myr).

Results\n  from scaling the ISM opacity Abstract: The opacity due to grains in the envelope of a protoplanet regulates the\naccretion rate of gas during formation, thus the final bulk composition of\nplanets with primordial H/He is a function of it. Observationally, for\nexoplanets with known mass and radius it is possible to estimate the bulk\ncomposition via internal structure models. We first determine the reduction\nfactor of the ISM grain opacity f_opa that leads to gas accretion rates\nconsistent with grain evolution models. We then compare the bulk composition of\nsynthetic low-mass and giant planets at different f_opa with observations. For\nf_opa=1 (full ISM opacity) the synthetic low-mass planets have too small radii,\ni.e., too low envelope masses compared to observations. At f_opa=0.003, the\nvalue calibrated with the grain evolution models, synthetic and actual planets\noccupy similar mass-radius loci. The mean enrichment of giant planets relative\nto the host star as a function of planet mass M can be approximated as\nZ_p/Z_star = beta*(M/M_Jup)^alpha. We find alpha=-0.7 independent of f_opa in\nsynthetic populations in agreement with the observational result (-0.71+-0.10).\nThe absolute enrichment level decreases from beta=8.5 at f_opa=1 to 3.5 at\nf_opa=0. At f_opa=0.003 one finds beta=7.2 which is similar to the\nobservational result (6.3+-1.0). We thus find observational hints that the\nopacity in protoplanetary atmospheres is much smaller than in the ISM even if\nthe specific value of the grain opacity cannot be constrained here. The result\nfor the enrichment of giant planets helps to distinguish core accretion and\ngravitational instability. In the simplest picture of core accretion where\nfirst a critical core forms and afterwards only gas is added, alpha=-1. If a\ncore accretes all planetesimals inside the feeding zone, alpha=-2/3. The\nobservational result lies between these values, pointing to core accretion as\nthe formation mechanism. \n\n"}

Using an up-to-date semi-analytic model of\ngalaxy formation, we measure the local density of galaxies in fixed apertures\non different scales. There is a clear correlation of density with halo mass for\nsatellite galaxies, while a significant population of low mass centrals is\nfound at high densities in the neighbourhood of massive haloes. In this case\nthe density simply traces the mass of the most massive halo within the\naperture. To identify central and satellite galaxies, we apply an\nobservationally motivated stellar mass rank method which is both highly pure\nand complete, especially in the more massive haloes where such a division is\nmost meaningful. Finally we examine a test case for the recovery of\nenvironmental trends: the passive fraction of galaxies and its dependence on\nstellar and halo mass for centrals and satellites. With careful calibration,\nobservationally defined quantities do a good job of recovering known trends in\nthe model.

We combine polarization data from Planck with\nrotation measure (RM) observations towards a massive star-forming region, the\nRosette Nebula in the Monoceros molecular cloud, to study its magnetic field\nstructure and the impact of an expanding HII region on the morphology of the\nfield. We derive an analytical solution for the magnetic field, assumed to\nevolve from an initially uniform configuration following the expansion of\nionized gas and the formation of a shell of swept-up ISM. From the RM data we\nestimate a mean value of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field of\nabout 3microG (towards the observer) in the Rosette Nebula, for a uniform\nelectron density of about 12cm-3. The dust shell that surrounds the Rosette HII\nregion is clearly observed in the Planck intensity map at 353 GHz, with a\npolarization signal significantly different from that of the local background\nwhen considered as a whole. The Planck observations constrain the\nplane-of-the-sky orientation of the magnetic field in the Rosette's parent\nmolecular cloud to be mostly aligned with the large-scale field along the\nGalactic plane. The Planck data are compared with the analytical model, which\npredicts the mean polarization properties of a spherical and uniform dust shell\nfor a given orientation of the field. This comparison leads to an upper limit\nof about 45degr on the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic field\nin the Rosette complex, for an assumed intrinsic dust polarization fraction of\n4%. This field direction can reproduce the RM values detected in the ionized\nregion if the magnetic field strength in the Monoceros molecular cloud is in\nthe range 6.5--9microG. \n\n"}

This effect is\nsuggested to be a possible explanation of the origin of the strongest magnetic\nfields observed in magnetars. The growth of a seed magnetic field energy\ndensity is stipulated by the corresponding growth of the magnetic helicity\ndensity due to the presence of the anomalous electric current in the Maxwell\nequation. Such an anomaly is the sum of the two competitive effects: (i) the\nchiral magnetic effect driven by the difference of chemical potentials for the\nright and left handed massless electrons and (ii) constant chiral electroweak\nelectron-nucleon interaction term, which has the polarization origin and\ndepends on the constant neutron density in a neutron star core.

We are able to fit all feedback models investigated at the\n5 per cent level using only two free parameters, and we place limits on the\nrange of these halo parameters for feedback models investigated by the OWLS\nsimulations. Accurate predictions to high-$k$ are vital for weak lensing\nsurveys, and these halo parameters could be considered nuisance parameters to\nmarginalize over in future analyses to mitigate uncertainty regarding the\ndetails of feedback. Finally, we investigate how lensing observables predicted\nby our model compare to those from simulations and from HALOFIT for a range of\n$k$-cuts and feedback models and quantify the angular scales at which these\neffects become important.

CP stars exhibiting this phenomenon are normally\nclassified as alpha2 Canum Venaticorum (ACV) variables. It is important to\nincrease the sample of known rotational periods among CP stars by discovering\nnew ACV variables. The ASAS-3 data were cross-correlated with the Catalogue of\nAp, HgMn, and Am stars in order to analyse the light curves of bona fide CP and\nrelated stars. The light curves were downloaded and cleaned of outliers and\ndata points with a flag indicating bad quality. Promising candidates showing a\nlarger scatter than observed for constant stars in the corresponding magnitude\nrange were searched for periodic signals using a standard Fourier technique. In\ntotal, we found 323 variables, from which 246 are reported here for the first\ntime, and 77 were probably wrongly classified before. The observed variability\npattern of most stars is in accordance with an ACV classification.

Within this\nscheme, the angular parameter which defines quasi-elliptical isophotes is\ntransformed from the commonly used, but inappropriate, polar co-ordinate to the\n`eccentric anomaly'. This provides a superior description of deviations from\nellipticity, better capturing the true isophotal shape. Furthermore, this makes\nit possible to accurately recover both the surface brightness profile, using\nthe correct azimuthally-averaged isophote, and the two-dimensional model of any\ngalaxy: the hitherto ubiquitous, but artificial, cross-like features in\nresidual images are completely removed. The formalism has been implemented into\nthe IRAF tasks $Ellipse$ and $Bmodel$ to create the new tasks `$Isofit$', and\n`$Cmodel$'. The new tools are demonstrated here with application to five\ngalaxies, chosen to be representative case-studies for several areas where this\ntechnique makes it possible to gain new scientific insight.

A\nwell-characterized stellar sample suggests at least two different relationships\nbetween rotation period and cycle period, with some stars exhibiting long and\nshort cycles simultaneously.

In Paper~I, we presented the optimal ways to coadd images in order to\ndetect faint sources and to perfrom flux measurements under the assumption that\nthe noise is approximately Gaussian. Here, we build on these results and derive\nfrom first principles a coaddition technique which is optimal for any\nhypothesis testing and measurement (e.g., source detection, flux or shape\nmeasurements and star/galaxy separation), in the background-noise-dominated\ncase. This method has several important properties. The pixels of the resulting\ncoadd image are uncorrelated. This image preserves all the information (from\nthe original individual images) on all spatial frequencies. Any hypothesis\ntesting or measurement that can be done on all the individual images\nsimultaneously, can be done on the coadded image without any loss of\ninformation. The PSF of this image is typically as narrow, or narrower than the\nPSF of the best image in the ensemble. Moreover, this image is practically\nindistinguishable from a regular single image, meaning that any code that\nmeasures any property on a regular astronomical image can be applied to it\nunchanged. In particular, the optimal source detection statistic derived in\npaper~I is reproduced by matched filtering this image with its own PSF. This\ncoaddition process, which we call proper coaddition, can be understood as a the\nmaximum signal-to-noise ratio measurement of the Fourier transform of the\nimage, weighted in such a way that the noise in the entire Fourier domain is of\nequal variance. This method has important implications for multi-epoch\nseeing-limited deep surveys, weak lensing galaxy shape measurements, and\ndiffraction-limited imaging via speckle observations.

We suggest that advanced civilizations could cloak their\npresence, or deliberately broadcast it, through controlled laser emission. Such\nemission could distort the apparent shape of their transit light curves with\nrelatively little energy, due to the collimated beam and relatively infrequent\nnature of transits. We estimate that humanity could cloak the Earth from\nKepler-like broadband surveys using an optical monochromatic laser array\nemitting a peak power of about 30 MW for roughly 10 hours per year. A chromatic\ncloak, effective at all wavelengths, is more challenging requiring a large\narray of tunable lasers with a total power of approximately 250 MW.\nAlternatively, a civilization could cloak only the atmospheric signatures\nassociated with biological activity on their world, such as oxygen, which is\nachievable with a peak laser power of just around 160 kW per transit. Finally,\nwe suggest that the time of transit for optical SETI is analogous to the\nwater-hole in radio SETI, providing a clear window in which observers may\nexpect to communicate.

We used the MAGPHYS\ncode to fit the multiwavelength (UV-radio) SEDs of 16 of the target SMGs. We\nalso constructed the pure radio SEDs of our SMGs using three different radio\nbands (325 MHz, 1.4 GHz, and 3 GHz). Moreover, since two SMGs in our sample,\nAzTEC1 and AzTEC3, benefit from previous CO line observations, we studied their\nproperties in more detail. We found that 63% of our target SMGs lie above the\ngalaxy main-sequence by more than a factor of 3, and hence are starbursts. The\n3 GHz radio sizes we have previously measured for the target SMGs were compared\nwith the present stellar mass estimates, and we found that the z>3 SMGs are\nfairly consistent with the mass-size relationship of z~2 compact, quiescent\ngalaxies (cQGs). The median IR-radio correlation parameter is found to be\nq=2.27, which is lower than measured locally (median q=2.64). AzTEC1 is found\nto have a sub-Eddington SFR surface density (by a factor of 2.6), while AzTEC3\nappears to be an Eddington-limited starburster. The gas reservoir in these two\nhigh-z SMGs would be exhausted in only ~86 and 19 Myr at the current SFR,\nrespectively. A comparison of the MAGPHYS-based properties of our SMGs with\nthose of equally bright ALESS SMGs suggests that the two populations share\nfairly similar physical characteristics, including the q parameter. A hint of\nnegative correlation is found between the 3 GHz size and the level of\nstarburstiness, and hence cosmic-ray electrons in more compact starbursts might\nbe more susceptible to free-free absorption. Some of the derived low and high q\nvalues (compared to the local median) could be the result of a specific\nmerger/post-starburst phase of galaxy evolution.

Gaia DR1\nconsists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,\nparallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars\nin common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric\ndata set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources.

The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the\ntypical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas.

This scenario typically requires a large \"boost factor\" to be\nconsistent with a thermal relic dark matter candidate produced via freeze-out.\nHowever, such an explanation is disfavored by constraints from CMB observations\non energy deposition during the epoch of recombination. We discuss a scenario\ncalled late-decaying two-component dark matter (LD2DM), where the entire DM\nconsists of two semi-degenerate species. Within this framework, the heavier\nspecies is produced as a thermal relic in the early universe and decays to the\nlighter species over cosmological timescales.

Aims: Attempt to,\nfor the first time, spectrally resolve CO thermal line emission in a small\nsample of AGB stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Our modelling jointly accounts for\nantenna-dependent gains and system equivalent flux densities. We obtain\nposterior distributions for the various source and instrumental parameters\nalong with the corresponding uncertainties and correlations between them. We\nfind that there is very strong evidence (>1e9 :1) in favour of elliptical\nGaussian structure and using this model derive the apparent brightness\ntemperature distribution of the blazar, accounting for uncertainties in the\nshape estimates. To test the integrity of our method, we also perform model\nselection on synthetic observations and use this to develop a Bayesian\ncriterion for the minimum resolvable source size and consequently the maximum\nmeasurable brightness temperature for a given interferometer, dependent on the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data incorporating the aforementioned\nsystematics. We find that calibration errors play an increasingly important\nrole in determining the over-resolution limit for SNR>>100.

The first BBC fitting stage uses a\nposterior distribution that includes multiple SN likelihoods, a Monte Carlo\nsimulation to bias-correct the fitted SALT-II parameters, and CC probabilities\ndetermined from a machine learning technique. The BBC fit determines 1) a\nbin-averaged HD (average distance vs. redshift), and 2) the nuisance parameters\nalpha and beta, which multiply the stretch and color (respectively) to\nstandardize the SN brightness.

The review begins with a\ndetailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the\nrigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions\nof General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key\ncomponents of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational\nobservables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their\ntime derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all\nthese contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the\npeak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical\nmeaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection\nbetween bias parameters and galaxy statistics.

We include consistent numerical treatment of magnetic field amplification\n(MFA) due to resonant streaming instability. Under the assumption that SNR\nG1.9+0.3 is the result of a Type Ia supernova explosion located near the\nGalactic Centre, using widely accepted values for explosion energy 10$^{51}$\nerg and ejecta mass 1.4 $M_{\\odot}$, the non-thermal continuum radio emission\nis calculated. The main purpose of this paper is to explain radio flux\nbrightening measured over recent decades and also predict its future temporal\nevolution. We estimate that the SNR is now $\\sim$ 120 yr old, expanding in an\nambient density of 0.02 cm$^{-3}$, and explain its steep radio spectral index\nonly by means of efficient non-linear diffusive shock acceleration (NLDSA). We\nalso make comparison between simulations and observations of this young SNR, in\norder to test the models and assumptions suggested. Our model prediction of a\nradio flux density increase of $\\sim$ 1.8 per cent yr$^{-1}$ during the past\ntwo decades agrees well with the measured values. We synthesize the synchrotron\nspectrum from radio to X-ray and it fits well the VLA, MOST, Effelsberg,\nChandra and NuSTAR measurements.

To explain this variation of the meridional circulation with the\nsolar cycle, we construct a theoretical model by coupling the equation of the\nmeridional circulation (the $\\phi$ component of the vorticity equation within\nthe solar convection zone) with the equations of the flux transport dynamo\nmodel. We consider the back reaction due to the Lorentz force of the\ndynamo-generated magnetic fields and study the perturbations produced in the\nmeridional circulation due to it. This enables us to model the variations of\nthe meridional circulation without developing a full theory of the meridional\ncirculation itself. We obtain results which reproduce the observational data of\nsolar cycle variations of the meridional circulation reasonably well. We get\nthe best results on assuming the turbulent viscosity acting on the velocity\nfield to be comparable to the magnetic diffusivity (i.e. on assuming the\nmagnetic Prandtl number to be close to unity). We have to assume an appropriate\nbottom boundary condition to ensure that the Lorentz force cannot drive a flow\nin the subadiabatic layers below the bottom of the tachocline.

In fact, the detection of such a\nrelic would bring us information from the pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)\nperiod, an epoch from which we have no data, and could even hint at\ninflationary physics. In this work, we assume that the expansion rate of the\nUniverse after inflationary is governed by the kinetic energy of a scalar field\n$\\phi$, in the so-called \"kination\" model. We assume that the $\\phi$ field\ndecays into both radiation and DM particles, which we take to be Weakly\nInteracting Massive Particles (WIMPs). The present abundance of WIMPs is then\nfixed during the kination period through either a thermal \"freeze-out\" or\n\"freeze-in\" mechanism, or through a non-thermal process governed by the decay\nof $\\phi$. We explore the parameter space of this theory with the requirement\nthat the present WIMP abundance provides the correct DM relic budget.

As such, Lya luminosity should be an excellent\ninstantaneous star formation rate (SFR) indicator.

Within the supermassive black hole's\ngravitational sphere of influence, the hot gas is multiphase and spans\ntemperatures from 0.2 to 1 keV. The radiative cooling time of the lowest\ntemperature gas drops to only 0.1-0.5 Myr, which is comparable to its free fall\ntime. Whilst the temperature structure is remarkably symmetric about the\nnucleus, the density gradient is steep in sectors to the N and S, with\n$\\rho{\\propto}r^{-1.5\\pm0.1}$, and significantly shallower along the jet axis\nto the E, where $\\rho{\\propto}r^{-0.93\\pm0.07}$. The density structure within\nthe Bondi radius is therefore consistent with steady inflows perpendicular to\nthe jet axis and an outflow directed E along the jet axis. By putting limits on\nthe radial flow speed, we rule out Bondi accretion on the scale resolved at the\nBondi radius.

The\npredicted size distributions are frequently bimodal and irregular in shape.\nThere is a negative correlation between total cloud mass and equilibrium\ntemperature as well as a positive correlation between total cloud mass and\natmospheric mixing.

Without shock\ncompression, there would be only a moderate geomagnetic storm with a peak Dst\nvalue of -79 nT.

For\nthe formation process of glycine on the grain surface, we obtained consistent\nresults with previous studies that glycine would be formed via the reactions of\nCOOH with CH$_2$NH$_2$. However, we will report three important findings\nregarding the chemical evolution and the detectability of interstellar glycine.\nFirst, with the experimentally obtained binding energy from the temperature\nprogrammed thermal desorption (TPD) experiment, a large proportion of glycine\nwas destroyed through the grain surface reactions with NH or CH$_3$O radicals\nbefore it fully evaporates. As a result, the formation process in the gas phase\nis more important than thermal evaporation from grains. If this is the case,\nNH$_2$OH and CH$_3$COOH rather than CH$_3$NH$_2$ and CH$_2$NH would be the\nessential precursors to the gas phase glycine. Secondly, since the gas phase\nglycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, early\nevolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the\nfuture glycine surveys. Thirdly, we suggest the possibility that the\nsuprathermal hydrogen atoms can strongly accelerate the formation of COOH\nradicals from CO$_2$, resulting in the dramatic increase of formation rate of\nglycine on grains. The efficiency of this process should be investigated in\ndetail by theoretical and experimental studies in the future. \n\n"}

For a reasonable choice of parameters, thermal inflation\nmodels naturally predict a suppression of the matter power spectrum on galactic\nand sub-galactic scales, mimicking the effect of warm or interacting dark\nmatter. Matter power spectra in these models are also characterised by an\nexcess of power (w.r.t. the standard $\\Lambda$CDM power spectrum) just below\nthe suppression scale.

We measure\nthe non-linear matter power spectrum and extract halo statistics, such as the\nhalo mass function, and compare these quantities with those predicted in the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM model and in other models with damped matter\nfluctuations. We find that the thermal inflation models considered here produce\nmeasurable differences in the matter power spectrum from $\\Lambda$CDM at\nredshifts $z>5$, while the halo mass functions are appreciably different at all\nredshifts. The halo mass function at $z=0$ for thermal inflation displays an\nenhancement of around $\\sim 20\\%$ w.r.t. $\\Lambda$CDM and a damping at lower\nhalo masses, with the position of the enhancement depending on the value of the\nfree parameter in the model.

This also places the\npulsar beyond the conventional pulsar death line, where radio emission is\nexpected to cease. The spin period of PSR J0250+5854 is similar to those of the\nhigh-energy-emitting magnetars and X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs).\nHowever, the pulsar was not detected by the Swift/XRT in the energy band of\n0.3-10 keV, placing a bolometric luminosity limit of $1.5 \\times 10^{32}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ for an assumed $N_{\\rm H}=1.35\\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a\ntemperature of 85 eV (typical of XDINSs).

However, there are many more planetary normal\nmodes that should have resonances in the rings, implying that many normal modes\ndo not have sufficiently large amplitudes to generate obvious ring waves.\nFortunately, recent advances in wavelet analysis allow weaker wave signals to\nbe uncovered by combining data from multiple occultations. These new analytical\ntools reveal that a pattern previously identified as a single spiral wave\nactually consists of two superimposed waves, one with 5 spiral arms rotating at\n1593.6 degrees/day and one with 11 spiral arms rotating at 1450.5 degrees/day.\nFurthermore, a broad search for new waves revealed four previously unknown wave\npatterns with 6, 7, 8 and 9 spiral arms rotating around the planet at 1538.2\ndegrees/day, 1492.5 degrees/day, 1454.2 degrees/day and 1421.8 degrees/day,\nrespectively.

While only those with small separations may exchange\ngas with one another, even the widest binaries interact with their gaseous\nsurroundings. Drag forces and accretion rates dictate how these systems are\ntransformed by these interactions. We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flows, in which a binary moves\nsupersonically relative to a homogeneous medium, using the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code FLASH. We simulate a range of values of the initial semi-major\naxis of the orbit relative to the gravitational focusing impact parameter of\nthe pair. When the binary separation is less than the gravitational focusing\nimpact parameter, the pair orbits within a shared bow shock. When the pair is\nwider, each object has an individual bow-shock structure. The long-term\nevolution of the binary is determined by the timescales for accretion, slowing\nof the center of mass, and orbital inspiral. We find a clear hierarchy of these\ntimescales; a binary's center-of-mass motion is slowed over a shorter timescale\nthan the pair inspirals or accretes. In contrast to previous analytic\npredictions, which assume an unperturbed background medium, we find that the\ntimescale for orbital inspiral is proportional to the semi-major axis to the\n$0.19 \\pm 0.01$ power. This positive scaling indicates that gaseous drag forces\ncan drive binaries either to coalescence or to the critical separation at which\ngravitational radiation dominates their further evolution.

We explore a variety of approaches for modelling the\nradial distribution of the cold neutral gas associated with the galaxies in our\nmodels, and find that our results are very sensitive to this ingredient. If we\nuse an approach based on Fall & Efstathiou (1980), in which the sizes of the\ndiscs are determined by conservation of angular momentum, we find that the\nmajority of the DLAS correspond to a single galactic disc. These models\ngenerically fail to reproduce the observed distribution of velocity widths. In\nalternative models in which the gas discs are considerably more extended, a\nsignificant fraction of DLAS arise from lines of sight intersecting multiple\ngas discs in a common halo.

Thus we conclude that Cold Dark Matter based models\nof galaxy formation can be reconciled with the kinematic data, but only at the\nexpense of the standard assumption that DLAS are produced by rotationally\nsupported gas discs whose sizes are determined by conservation of angular\nmomentum.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to extract maximum\ninformation from the Stromgren data. By calibrating the Principal Components\nusing well-studied galaxies (and stellar population models), we develop a\npurely empirical method to detect, and subsequently classify, cluster galaxies\nat all redshifts smaller than 0.8. Interlopers are discarded with unprecedented\nefficiency (up to 100%).

While supernovae are the most obvious candidate heating sources, a\nnumber of recent studies have suggested that they may be energetically\ninsufficient. Here we consider high-power, FRII radio galaxies and shock\nheating of the intracluster medium (ICM, including the case of the\nintergalactic medium prior to cluster formation) by their large-scale jets.\nBased on the observed statistics of radio galaxies in clusters and their\nevolution, along with the most reasonable assumptions, it is shown that they\ncan provide the ICM with excess specific energies of 1--2 keV per particle,\nmainly during the redshift interval $z \\sim 1-3$. This naturally meets the\nrequirements of cluster evolution models with non-gravitational feedback in\naccounting for the observed deviations in the X-ray luminosity-temperature\nrelation.

Our N-body/SPH\nsimulations suggest a new scenario in which the strong tidal field of M31 can\ntransform a spiral galaxy into a compact elliptical. As a low luminosity spiral\ngalaxy plunges into the central region of M31, most of the outer stellar and\ngaseous components of its disk are dramatically stripped due to M31's tidal\nfield The central bulge component, on the other hand, is just weakly influenced\nby the tidal field owing to its compact configuration, and retains its\nmorphology. M31's strong tidal field also induces rapid gas transfer to the\ncentral region, triggers a nuclear starburst, and consequently forms the\ncentral high density and more metal-rich stellar populations with relatively\nyoung ages. Thus, in this scenario, M32 was previously the bulge of a spiral\ntidally interacting with M31 several Gyr ago. Furthermore, we suggest cEs like\nM32 are rare, the result of both the rather narrow parameter space for tidal\ninteractions which morphologically transform spirals into cEs and the very\nshort time scale ($<$ a few $10^9$ yr) for cEs to be swallowed. \n\n"}

Among the most natural cosmological solutions to these\nproblems is to replace cold dark matter with a warm species (LWDM).

Our\nsample contains 68 pulse trains detected in a search of 159 bursts from 8\naccreting neutron stars. As a first step, we confirm that the oscillations\nusually drift upward in frequency by about 1% toward an apparent saturation\nfrequency. Previously noted anomalies, such as drifts toward lower frequencies\nas the oscillations disappear (``spin-down'' episodes) and instances of two\nsignals present simultaneously at frequencies separated by a few Hz, occur in\n5% of oscillations. Having verified the generally accepted description of burst\noscillations, we proceed to study the coherence of the oscillations during\nindividual bursts, and the dispersion in the asymptotic frequencies in bursts\nobserved over five years. On short time scales, we find that 30% of the\noscillation trains do not appear to evolve smoothly in phase. This suggests\neither that two signals are present simultaneously with a frequency difference\ntoo small to resolve (< 1 Hz), that the frequency evolution is discontinuous,\nor that discrete phase jumps occur.

A comparison with recent observational data by Adelberger et. al\non the Ly-alpha forest around galaxies reveals that actual galaxies may have\nsystematically less Ly-alpha absorption within 1 Mpc of them than our simulated\ngalaxies. In order to investigate this possibility, we add several simple\nprescriptions for galaxy feedback on the IGM to the evolved simulation.

We identify 12 cosmological systems, and 6 systems\nthat are either ejected from the background QSO or affected by its local\nradiation field. Almost all of the intergalactic OVI is associated with strong\nLy-a absorption (N_HI > 10^15.2 cm^-2), as well as absorption from CIV and\noften lower ionization species. The absorbing regions are conservatively\nconstrained to have L<=200 kpc and rho/rho_bar >= 2.5, with actual values\nprobably closer to L ~ 60 kpc and rho/rho_bar ~ 10-30. They also have two\ndistinct gas phases: one which produces photoionized CIV and SiIV at T ~ 30,000\nK, and a second which is seen only in OVI. The OVI temperature is difficult to\nconstrain due to uncertainty in the amount of nonthermal line broadening, but\nit does appear that this gas is hotter than the CIV/SiIV phase and could\nsupport collisional OVI production. The OVI is strongly clustered on velocity\nscales of dv=100-300 km/s, with weaker signal extending to dv = 750 km/s.

The resulting eight possible 3PCFs were\nrecently investigated by Schneider & Lombardi (2002) and Zaldarriaga &\nScoccimarro (2002).

The presence of substructure exterior to the lens has\nbeen invoked by several authors in the context of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models\nin order to explain the anamolous magnification ratios. We emphasize that the\nanomalous magnification ratios may be an artifact of the simple one-component\nmass models currently in use; the inclusion of a misaligned disk may be able to\nmimic the effect of substructure. These slight spatial offsets between the dark\nmatter halo and the disk, which are likely to occur during or as a consequence\nof interactions or mergers, lead to complex image configurations and\nnon-standard magnification ratios. We investigate two illustrative lens models:\na spiral disk embedded within a dark matter halo, and a compact disk-like\ncomponent within an elliptical galaxy.

Approximately 90\nof these stars have been found to host exoplanets massive enough to be\ndetectable. Thus at least ~5% of target stars possess planets. If we limit our\nanalysis to target stars that have been monitored the longest (~15 years), ~11%\npossess planets. If we limit our analysis to stars monitored the longest and\nwhose low surface activity allow the most precise velocity measurements, ~25%\npossess planets. By identifying trends of the exoplanet mass and period\ndistributions in a sub-sample of exoplanets less-biased by selection effects,\nand linearly extrapolating these trends into regions of parameter space that\nhave not yet been completely sampled, we find at least ~9% of Sun-like stars\nhave planets in the mass and orbital period ranges Msin(i) > 0.3 M_Jupiter and\nP < 13 years, and at least ~22% have planets in the larger range Msin(i) > 0.1\nM_Jupiter and P < 60 years. Even this larger area of the mass-period plane is\nless than 20% of the area occupied by our planetary system, suggesting that\nthis estimate is still a lower limit to the true fraction of Sun-like stars\nwith planets, which may be as large as ~100%. \n\n"}

In this paper, we apply a power\nequalization (PE) filter to the high-latitude WMAP data in order to reconstruct\nthese low-l multipoles free from the largest Galactic foreground modelling\nuncertainties in the Galactic plane. The characteristic spatial distributions\nof the modes of order l=2,3,4,5 have been determined as a function of\nfrequency, sky coverage and two methods for foreground correction: using the\ntemplate fitting results of Bennett et al.

Our analyses suggest that the K and Ka frequency bands remain\nsignificantly contaminated by residual foreground emission for the WMAP Kp2\nmask. However, the l=3,4,5 multipole maps for the Q, V and W channels indicate\nthat, after foreground cleaning, these multipoles are dominated by the CMB\nanisotropy component. We confirm the Tegmark et al.

The intrinsic alignments are believed to\nbe small for deep surveys, but this is based on intrinsic and lensing\ndistortions being uncorrelated. Here we show that the gravitational lensing\nshear and intrinsic shear need not be independent: correlations between the\ntidal field and the intrinsic shear cause the intrinsic shear of nearby\ngalaxies to be correlated with the gravitational shear acting on more distant\ngalaxies. We estimate the magnitude of this effect for two simple intrinsic\nalignment models: one in which the galaxy ellipticity is linearly related to\nthe tidal field, and one in which it is quadratic in the tidal field as\nsuggested by tidal torque theory. The first model predicts a\ngravitational-intrinsic (GI) correlation that can be much greater than the\nintrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation for broad redshift distributions, and that\nremains when galaxies pairs at similar redshifts are rejected.

However, whenever powerful jets are\ntriggered, there is a dramatic (factor >100) step-function increase in the\nefficiency of feedback. We use a feedback model, together with the measured\nspace density of flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars, to show that a powerful-jet\nepisode probably occurred in every protocluster in the Universe. Before jet\ntriggering, there was time for gravitational collapse to create many (~10-100)\nsurrounding protogalaxies massive enough to host radio-quiet quasars.

A number of\n\"intermediate duration\" bursts have also been observed, probably associated\nwith ignition of a thick helium layer. We investigate the sensitivity of these\nlong X-ray bursts to the thermal profile of the neutron star crust and core. We\nfirst compare cooling models of superburst lightcurves with observations, and\nderive constraints on the ignition mass and energy release, and then calculate\nignition models for superbursts and pure helium bursts, and compare to\nobservations.

These PDMF features can be misinterpreted as the form of the\nintrinsic stellar initial mass function (IMF) if the star formation rate is\nassumed to be constant or slowly varying with time. This effect applies to all\nregions that have formed stars for longer than the age of the most massive\nstars, including OB associations, star complexes, and especially galactic field\nstars. Related problems may apply to embedded clusters. Evidence is summarized\nfor temporal SFR variations from parsec scales to entire galaxies, all of which\nshould contribute to inferred IMF distortions. We give examples of various star\nformation histories to demonstrate the types of false IMF structures that might\nbe seen. These include short-duration bursts, stochastic histories with\nlog-normal amplitude distributions, and oscillating histories with various\nperiods and phases.

The\nmorphology (obtained from GOODS data) of 75 % of our LBGs is consistent with a\ndisk. The vast majority of LBGs with an IR detection are also Luminous Infrared\nGalaxies (LIRGs). As a class, the galaxies not detected at 24 microns are an\norder of magnitude fainter relative to the UV compared with those detected\nindividually, suggesting that there may be two types of behavior within the\nsample. For the IR-bright galaxies, there is an apparent upper limit for the UV\ndust attenuation and this upper limit is anti-correlated with the observed UV\nluminosity. Previous estimates of dust attenuations based on the ultraviolet\nslope are compared to new ones based on the FIR/UV ratio (for LBGs detected at\n24 microns), which is usually a more reliable estimator. Depending on the\ncalibration we use to estimate the total IR luminosity, beta-based attenuations\nA_{FUV} are larger by 0.2 to 0.6 mag. than the ones estimated from FIR/UV\nratio. Finally, for IR-bright LBGs, median estimated beta-based SFRs are 2-3\ntimes larger than the total SFRs estimated as SFR_{TOT} = SFR_{UV} + SFR_{IR}\nwhile IR-based SFRs provide values below SFR_{TOT} by 15 - 20 %.

The ability to reliably constrain the contribution of faint\ngalaxies is critical and our data do so as they reach to M*+2 even at z~4 and\ndeeper still at lower redshifts. We find that the luminosity density at high\nredshift is dominated by the hitherto poorly studied galaxies fainter than L*,\nand, indeed, the the bulk of the UV light in the high-z Universe comes from\ngalaxies in the luminosity range L=0.1-1L*. It is these faint galaxies that\ngovern the behavior of the total UV luminosity density. Overall, there is a\ngradual rise in luminosity density starting at z~4 or earlier, followed by a\nshallow peak or a plateau within z~3--1, and then followed by the well-know\nplunge at lower redshifts. Within this total picture, luminosity density in\nsub-L* galaxies evolves more rapidly at high redshift, z>~2, than that in more\nluminous objects. However, this is reversed at lower redshifts, z<~1, a\nreversal that is reminiscent of galaxy downsizing. Within the context of the\nmodels commonly used in the observational literature, there seemingly aren't\nenough faint or bright LBGs to maintain ionization of intergalactic gas even as\nlate as z~4. This is particularly true at earlier epochs and even more so if\nthe faint-end evolutionary trends we observe at z~3 and 4 continue to higher\nredshifts. Apparently the Universe must be easier to reionize than some recent\nstudies have assumed. Nevertheless, sub-L* galaxies do dominate the total UV\nluminosity density at z>~2 and this dominance further highlights the need for\nfollow-up studies that will teach us more about these very numerous but thus\nfar largely unexplored systems. \n\n"}

Abstract: The Very Large Array was used to observe the ultracool, rapidly rotating M9\ndwarf TVLM 513-46546 simultaneously at 4.88 GHz and 8.44 GHz. The radio\nemission was determined to be persistent, variable and periodic at both\nfrequencies with a period of ~2 hours. This periodicity is in excellent\nagreement with the estimated period of rotation of the dwarf based on its v sin\ni of ~60 km/s. This rotational modulation places strong constraints on the\nsource size of the radio emitting region and hence the brightness temperature\nof the associated emission. We find the resulting high brightness temperature,\ntogether with the inherent directivity of the rotationally modulated component\nof the emission, difficult to reconcile with incoherent gyrosynchrotron\nradiation. We conclude that a more likely source is coherent, electron\ncyclotron maser emission from the low density regions above the magnetic poles.\nThis model requires the magnetic field of TVLM 513-46546 to take the form of a\nlarge-scale, stable, dipole or multipole with surface field strengths up to at\nleast 3kG. We discuss a mechanism by which broadband, persistent electron\ncyclotron maser emission can be sustained in the low density regions of the\nmagnetospheres of ultracool dwarfs. A second nonvarying, unpolarized component\nof the emission may be due to depolarization of the coherent electron cyclotron\nmaser emission or alternatively, incoherent gyrosynchrotron or synchrotron\nradiation from a population of electrons trapped in the large-scale magnetic\nfield. \n\n"}

We remind that\neven the losses attributed to the magneto-dipole radiation of a pulsar in\nvacuum can be written as a result of an Ampere force action of the electric\ncurrens flowing over the neutron star surface (Michel, 1991, Beskin et al.,\n1993). It is this force that is responsible for the transfer of angular\nmomentum of a neutron star to an outgoing magneto-dipole wave. If a pulsar is\nsurrounded by plasma, and there is no longitudinal current in its\nmagnetosphere, there is no energy loss (Beskin et al., 1993, Mestel et al.,\n1999). It is the longitudinal current closing within the pulsar polar cap that\nexerts the retardation torque acting on the neutron star. This torque can be\ndetermined if the structure of longitudinal current is known. Here we remind of\nthe solution by Beskin, Gurevitch & Istomin (1993) and discuss the validity of\nsuch an assumption.

{"id": "astro-ph/0609413", "contents": "Title: Clustering of dark matter tracers: renormalizing the bias parameters Abstract: A commonly used perturbative method for computing large-scale clustering of\ntracers of mass density, like galaxies, is to model the tracer density field as\na Taylor series in the local smoothed mass density fluctuations, possibly\nadding a stochastic component. I suggest a set of parameter redefinitions,\neliminating problematic perturbative correction terms, that should represent a\nmodest improvement, at least, to this method. As presented here, my method can\nbe used to compute the power spectrum and bispectrum to 4th order in initial\ndensity perturbations, and higher order extensions should be straightforward.\nWhile the model is technically unchanged at this order, just reparameterized,\nthe renormalized model is more elegant, and should have better convergence\nbehavior, for three reasons: First, in the usual approach the effects of\nbeyond-linear-order bias parameters can be seen at asymptotically large scales,\nwhile after renormalization the linear model is preserved in the large-scale\nlimit, i.e., the effects of higher order bias parameters are restricted to\nrelatively high k. Second, while the standard approach includes smoothing to\nsuppress large perturbative correction terms, resulting in dependence on the\narbitrary cutoff scale, no cutoff-sensitive terms appear explicitly after my\nredefinitions (and, relatedly, my correction terms are less sensitive to\nhigh-k, non-linear, power). Third, the 3rd order bias parameter disappears\nentirely, so my model has one fewer free parameter than usual (this parameter\nwas redundant at the order considered). This model predicts a small\nmodification of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal, in real space,\nsupporting the robustness of BAO as a probe of dark energy, and providing a\ncomplete perturbative description over the relevant range of scales. \n\n"}

Abstract: In spite of their overall success, semi-analytic models of galaxy formation\nand evolution predict slopes of luminosity functions which are steeper than the\nobserved ones. This discrepancy has generally been explained by subtle surface\nbrightness effects acting on the observational samples. In this paper, we\nexplicitly implement the computation of surface brightness in a simple\nsemi-analytic model (with standard CDM), and we estimate the effect of\nobservational surface brightness thresholds on the predicted luminosity\nfunctions. The crucial free parameter in this computation is the efficiency\nepsilon of supernova feedback which is responsible for the triggering of\ngalactic winds. With the classical formalism for this process, it is difficult\nto reproduce simultaneously the Tully-Fisher relation and the flat slope of the\nobservational luminosity function with the same value of epsilon. This suggests\nthat the triggering of galactic winds is a complex phenomenon.

Naively one would expect that supersymmetry enhances bosonic preheating\nas it introduces new scalars such as squarks and sleptons. On the contrary, we\npoint out that preheating is unlikely within supersymmetry. The reason is that\nflat directions in the scalar potential, classified by gauge invariant\ncombinations of slepton and squark fields, are generically displaced towards a\nlarge vacuum expectation value (VEV) in the early Universe. They induce\nsupersymmetry preserving masses to the inflaton decay products through the\nStandard Model Yukawa couplings, which kinematically blocks preheating for VEVs\n$> 10^{13}$ GeV.

Such\nfrequencies are rather difficult to compute, even for Schwarzschild black\nholes. However, it is now quite likely that they may provide a fundamental link\nbetween classical general relativity and quantum theories of gravity. Here we\ncarry out the first numerical computation of very highly damped quasinormal\nmodes (QNM's) for charged and rotating black holes. In the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\ncase QNM frequencies and damping times show an oscillatory behaviour as a\nfunction of charge. The oscillations become faster as the mode order increases.\nAt fixed mode order, QNM's describe spirals in the complex plane as the charge\nis increased, tending towards a well defined limit as the hole becomes\nextremal. Kerr QNM's have a similar oscillatory behaviour when the angular\nindex $m=0$. For $l=m=2$ the real part of Kerr QNM frequencies tends to\n$2\\Omega$, $\\Omega$ being the angular velocity of the black hole horizon, while\nthe asymptotic spacing of the imaginary parts is given by $2\\pi T_H$. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0311111", "contents": "Title: Tachyons, Scalar Fields and Cosmology Abstract: We study the role that tachyon fields may play in cosmology as compared to\nthe well-established use of minimally coupled scalar fields. We first elaborate\non a kind of correspondence existing between tachyons and minimally coupled\nscalar fields; corresponding theories give rise to the same cosmological\nevolution for a particular choice of the initial conditions but not for any\nother. This leads us to study a specific one-parameter family of tachyonic\nmodels based on a perfect fluid mixed with a positive cosmological constant.\nFor positive values of the parameter one needs to modify Sen's action and use\nthe sigma process of resolution of singularities. The physics described by this\nmodel is dramatically different and much richer than that of the corresponding\nscalar field. For particular choices of the initial conditions the universe,\nthat does mimick for a long time a de Sitter-like expansion, ends up in a\nfinite time in a special type of singularity that we call a \"big brake\". This\nsingularity is characterized by an infinite deceleration. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0403223", "contents": "Title: Creating the Universe from Brane-Antibrane Annihilation Abstract: When p-dimensional branes annihilate with antibranes in the early universe,\nas in brane-antibrane inflation, stable (p-2)-dimensional branes can appear in\nthe final state. We reexamine the possibility that one of these (p-2)-branes\ncould be our universe. In the low energy effective theory, the final state\nbranes are cosmic string defects of the complex tachyon field which describes\nthe instability of the initial state. We quantify the dynamics of formation of\nthese vortices. This information is then used to estimate the production of\nmassless gauge bosons on the final branes, due to their coupling to the\ntime-dependent tachyon background, which would provide a mechanism for\nreheating after inflation. We improve upon previous estimates indicating that\nthis can be an efficient reheating mechanism for observers on the brane. \n\n"}
