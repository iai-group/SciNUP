Assuming that\neach edge has an independent exponentially distributed edge weight, we derive\nexplicit distributional asymptotics for the minimum weight between two randomly\nchosen connected vertices in the network, as well as for the number of edges on\nthe least weight path, the so-called hopcount. We analyze the configuration\nmodel with degree power-law exponent $\\tau>2$, in which the degrees are assumed\nto be i.i.d. with a tail distribution which is either of power-law form with\nexponent $\\tau-1>1$, or has even thinner tails ($\\tau=\\infty$). In this model,\nthe degrees have a finite first moment, while the variance is finite for\n$\\tau>3$, but infinite for $\\tau\\in(2,3)$. We prove a central limit theorem for\nthe hopcount, with asymptotically equal means and variances equal to\n$\\alpha\\log{n}$, where $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$ for $\\tau\\in(2,3)$, while $\\alpha>1$\nfor $\\tau>3$. Here $n$ denotes the size of the graph. For $\\tau\\in (2,3)$, it\nis known that the graph distance between two randomly chosen connected vertices\nis proportional to $\\log \\log{n}$ [Electron. J.

The case of infinite mean\ndegrees ($\\tau\\in[1,2)$) is studied in [Extreme value theory,\nPoisson--Dirichlet distributions and first passage percolation on random\nnetworks (2009) Preprint] where it is proved that the hopcount remains\nuniformly bounded and converges in distribution. \n\n"}

We derive the distributional limit of the minimal\nweight of a path between typical vertices in the network and the number of\nedges on the minimal weight path, which can be computed in terms of the\nPoisson-Dirichlet distribution. We explicitly describe these limits via the\nconstruction of an infinite limiting object describing the FPP problem in the\ndensely connected core of the network. We consider two separate cases, namely,\nthe {\\it original CM}, in which each edge, regardless of its multiplicity,\nreceives an independent exponential weight, as well as the {\\it erased CM}, for\nwhich there is an independent exponential weight between any pair of direct\nneighbors.

In the\nlimit of decompactification from D to D+1 dimensions many such instantons are\nrelated to charged 1/2-BPS or 1/4-BPS black holes with euclidean world-lines\nwrapped around the large dimension. In a different limit the instantons give\nnonperturbative corrections to string perturbation theory, while in a third\nlimit they describe nonperturbative contributions in eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity. A proof is given that these three distinct Fourier expansions\nhave certain vanishing coefficients that are expected from string theory. In\nparticular, the Eisenstein series for these special values of s have markedly\nfewer Fourier coefficients than typical ones. The corresponding mathematics\ninvolves showing that the wavefront sets of the Eisenstein series are supported\non only certain coadjoint nilpotent orbits - just the minimal and trivial\norbits in the 1/2-BPS case, and just the next-to-minimal, minimal and trivial\norbits in the 1/4-BPS case. Thus as a byproduct we demonstrate that the\nnext-to-minimal representations occur automorphically for E6, E7, and E8, and\nhence the first two nontrivial low energy coefficients are exotic\ntheta-functions. \n\n"}

In the Hamiltonian formalism,\ntopological invariants restrict the orbits to submanifolds of the phase space.\nWhile the coadjoint orbits have a natural symplectic structure, the global\ngeometry of the degenerate (constrained) Poisson manifold can be very complex.\nSome invariants are represented by the center of the Poisson algebra (i.e., the\nCasimir elements such as the helicities), and then, the global structure of\nphase space is delineated by Casimir leaves. However, a general constraint is\nnot necessarily integrable, which precludes the existence of an appropriate\nCasimir element; the circulation is an example of such an invariant. In this\nwork, we formulate a systematic method to embed a Hamiltonian system in an\nextended phase space; we introduce mock fields and extend the Poisson algebra\nso that the mock fields are Lie-dragged by the flow vector. A mock field\ndefines a new Casimir element, a cross helicity, which represents topological\nconstraints including the circulation. Unearthing a Casimir element brings\nabout immense advantage in the study of dynamics and equilibria -- the\nso-called energy-Casimir method becomes ready available. Yet, a mock field does\nnot a priori have a physical meaning.

The monograph provides a number of examples of\ngroups acting on $\\mathbb H^\\infty$ which exhibit a wide range of phenomena not\nto be found in the finite-dimensional theory. Such examples often demonstrate\nthe optimality of our theorems. We introduce a modification of the Poincar\\'e\nexponent, an invariant of a group which gives more information than the usual\nPoincar\\'e exponent, which we then use to vastly generalize the Bishop--Jones\ntheorem relating the Hausdorff dimension of the radial limit set to the\nPoincar\\'e exponent of the underlying semigroup.

Explicitly, modelling the underlying space of features\nby a $\\sigma$-finite measure space $(S,\\mathcal{S},\\mu)$ and the connection\nprobabilities by an integrable function $W\\colon S\\times S\\to [0,1]$, we\nconstruct a random family $(G_t)_{t\\geq 0}$ of growing graphs such that the\nvertices of $G_t$ are given by a Poisson point process on $S$ with intensity\n$t\\mu$, with two points $x,y$ of the point process connected with probability\n$W(x,y)$. We call such a random family a graphon process. We prove that a\ngraphon process has convergent subgraph frequencies (with possibly infinite\nlimits) and that, in the natural extension of the cut metric to our setting,\nthe sequence converges to the generating graphon. We also show that the\nunderlying graphon is identifiable only as an equivalence class over graphons\nwith cut distance zero. More generally, we study metric convergence for\narbitrary (not necessarily random) sequences of graphs, and show that a\nsequence of graphs has a convergent subsequence if and only if it has a\nsubsequence satisfying a property we call uniform regularity of tails.

In contrast, the goal here is to develop\na strong statistical model to accurately predict both bug locations and exact\nfixes without access to information about the intended correct behavior of the\nprogram. Achieving such a goal requires a robust contextual repair model, which\nwe train on a large corpus of real-world source code that has been augmented\nwith synthetically injected bugs. Our framework adopts a two-stage approach\nwhere first a large set of repair candidates are generated by rule-based\nprocessors, and then these candidates are scored by a statistical model using a\nnovel neural network architecture which we refer to as Share, Specialize, and\nCompete. Specifically, the architecture (1) generates a shared encoding of the\nsource code using an RNN over the abstract syntax tree, (2) scores each\ncandidate repair using specialized network modules, and (3) then normalizes\nthese scores together so they can compete against one another in comparable\nprobability space.

As the costs of\nrunning faulty algorithms at scale can be severe, it is highly desirable to\nverify the correctness of the translation, i.e., to prove that the MapReduce\nversion is equivalent to the imperative original. We present a novel approach\nfor proving equivalence between imperative and MapReduce algorithms based on\npartitioning the equivalence proof into a sequence of equivalence proofs\nbetween intermediate programs with smaller differences. Our approach is based\non the insight that two kinds of sub-proofs are required: (1) uniform\ntransformations changing the controlflow structure that are mostly independent\nof the particular context in which they are applied; and (2) context-dependent\ntransformations that are not uniform but that preserve the overall structure\nand can be proved correct using coupling invariants. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of our approach by evaluating it on two prototypical algorithms\ncommonly used as examples in MapReduce frameworks: k-means and PageRank. To\ncarry out the proofs, we use the interactive theorem prover Coq with partial\nproof automation.

Enhancing the Predictive Power of\n  Happens - Before Based Dynamic Race Detection Abstract: Dynamic race detection is the problem of determining if an observed program\nexecution reveals the presence of a data race in a program. The classical\napproach to solving this problem is to detect if there is a pair of conflicting\nmemory accesses that are unordered by Lamport's happens-before (HB) relation.\nHB based race detection is known to not report false positives, i.e., it is\nsound. However, the soundness guarantee of HB only promises that the first pair\nof unordered, conflicting events is a schedulable data race. That is, there can\nbe pairs of HB-unordered conflicting data accesses that are not schedulable\nraces because there is no reordering of the events of the execution, where the\nevents in race can be executed immediately after each other. We introduce a new\npartial order, called schedulable happens-before (SHB) that exactly\ncharacterizes the pairs of schedulable data races --- every pair of conflicting\ndata accesses that are identified by SHB can be scheduled, and every HB-race\nthat can be scheduled is identified by SHB. Thus, the SHB partial order is\ntruly sound. We present a linear time, vector clock algorithm to detect\nschedulable races using SHB.

This trend makes it challenging to provide strong design-time\ncertification of correct operation.\n  To address these challenges, we present SOTER, a robotics programming\nframework with two key components: (1) a programming language for implementing\nand testing high-level reactive robotics software and (2) an integrated runtime\nassurance (RTA) system that helps enable the use of uncertified components,\nwhile still providing safety guarantees. SOTER provides language primitives to\ndeclaratively construct a RTA module consisting of an advanced,\nhigh-performance controller (uncertified), a safe, lower-performance controller\n(certified), and the desired safety specification. The framework provides a\nformal guarantee that a well-formed RTA module always satisfies the safety\nspecification, without completely sacrificing performance by using higher\nperformance uncertified components whenever safe.

This ``retry'' capability is very useful, allowing programmers to\nexamine in detail a part of the computation that they previously stepped over.\nUnfortunately, it also creates a problem: while the debugger may be able to\nrestore the previous values of variables, it cannot restore the part of the\nprogram's state that is affected by I/O operations. If the part of the\ncomputation being jumped back over performs I/O, then the program will perform\nthese I/O operations twice, which will result in unwanted effects ranging from\nthe benign (e.g. output appearing twice) to the fatal (e.g. trying to close an\nalready closed file). We present a simple mechanism for ensuring that every I/O\naction called for by the program is executed at most once, even if the\nprogrammer asks the debugger to travel back in time from after the action to\nbefore the action.

These values are not yet known, except in special cases.

However, we will carry this study out with an eye to the more general\ncase of braids on $n$ strands. We expect that solving the inverse problem even\nfor $n=3$ will present real difficulties.
