The novelty of quantum\ncryptography is that whenever a spy tries to eavesdrop the communication he\ncauses disturbances in the transmission of the message. Ultimately this\nunavoidable disturbance is a consequence of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle\nthat limits the joint knowledge of complementary observables. Now, a problem\nremains: in order to initialize quantum key distribution, Alice and Bob need to\nshare a short shared key in order to be able to identify each other\nunambiguously. Therefore a trusted courier is needed. We propose in this paper\na solution to the trusted courrier problem that was inspired by quantum\ncryptography. The idea is to encode the key that Alice sends to Bob into\nunstable nuclei in such a way that the message gets revealed only after the\ncourrier has delivered it to Bob. In this approach, we replace Heisenberg\nuncertainties by another type of uncertainty, that characterizes the knowledge\nof the time at which an unstable nucleus decays.

In this paper, we show this to be\ntrue for Dirac equations in a background of gravitational and electromagnetic\nfields. We first transform any Dirac equation into an equivalent canonical\nform, sometimes used in particular cases to solve Dirac equations in a curved\nspacetime. This canonical form is needed to apply the Whitham Lagrangian\nmethod. The latter method, unlike the WKB method, places no restriction on the\nmagnitude of Planck's constant to obtain wave packets, and furthermore\npreserves the symmetries of the Dirac Lagrangian. We show using canonical Dirac\nfields in a curved spacetime, that the probability current has a Gordon\ndecomposition into a convection current and a spin current, and that the spin\ncurrent vanishes in the Whitham approximation, which explains the negligible\neffect of spin on wave packet solutions, independent of the size of Planck's\nconstant.

Such task is\naccomplished by quantum authentication protocols which are distributed\nalgorithms based on the intrinsic properties of Quantum Mechanics. The choice\nof an authentication protocol must consider that quantum states are very\ndelicate and that the channel is subject to eavesdropping. However, even in\nface of the various existing definitions of quantum authentication protocols in\nthe literature, little is known about them in this perspective, and this lack\nof knowledge may unfavor comparisons and wise choices. In the attempt to\novercome this limitation, in the present work we aim at showing an approach to\nevaluate quantum authentication protocols based on the determination of their\nquantum communication complexity. Based on our investigation, no similar\nmethods to analyze quantum authentication protocols were found in the\nliterature.

The representation is\nobtained introducing generalized coherent states for the environment, and is\nsuch that the evolution from a fully quantum environment to a classical one can\nbe inherently followed. The method is applied to the specific case where the\nprincipal system is a central qubit and the environment is a surrounding ring\nof interacting spins, with the overall Hamiltonian being that of the $s=1/2$\nHeisenberg star with frustration. In this case the quantum character of the\nenvironment, embodied by the total spin $S$ of the ring, can be physically\nvaried by acting on the ratio between the couplings entering the Hamiltonian,\nand formally followed by increasing $S$. We find that when the star is in any\nof its eigenstates, the qubit behaves as if it were under the effect of an\nexternal magnetic field, whose direction in real space is set by the variables\ndefining the environmental coherent states, and is hence broadened according to\ntheir quantum probability distribution. When the quantum character of the\nenvironment is reduced, such distribution becomes narrower, finally collapsing\ninto a Dirac-$\\delta$ as $S\\to\\infty$. The entanglement between the central\nqubit and its environment remains well defined even in this limit, where it\ncomes across as the binary entropy of the $2\\pi$-normalized Berry phase\ncharacterizing the dynamics of a qubit in an adiabatically precessing magnetic\nfield. \n\n"}

More\nspecifically, we address systems where the Gaussian approximation fails, i.e.\nthe sole knowledge of the spectrum is not enough to determine the dynamics of\nquantum correlations. We thus investigate the dynamics for two different\nconfigurations of the environment: in the first case the noise spectrum is due\nto the interaction of each qubit with a single bistable fluctuator with an\nundetermined switching rate, whereas in the second case we consider a\ncollection of classical fluctuators with fixed switching rates. In both cases\nwe found analytical expressions for the time dependence of entanglement and\nquantum discord, which may be also extended to a collection of flcutuators with\nrandom switching rates. The environmental noise is introduced by means of\nstochastic time-dependent terms in the Hamiltonian and this allows us to\ndescribe the effects of both separate and common environments. We show that the\nnon-Gaussian character of the noise may lead to significant effects, e.g.\nenvironments with the same power spectrum, but different configurations, give\nraise to opposite behavior for the quantum correlations. In particular,\ndepending on the characteristics of the environmental noise considered, both\nentanglement and discord display either a monotonic decay or the phenomena of\nsudden death and revivals.

We implement a specific \"bouncer-walker\"\nmodel in the context of an assumed sub-quantum statistical physics, in analogy\nto the results of experiments by Couder's group on a classical wave-particle\nduality. We can thus give an explanation of various quantum mechanical features\nand results on the basis of a \"21st century classical physics\", such as the\nappearance of Planck's constant, the Schr\\\"odinger equation, etc. An essential\nresult is given by the proof that averaged particle trajectories' behaviors\ncorrespond to a specific type of anomalous diffusion termed \"ballistic\"\ndiffusion on a sub-quantum level.

A new quantum\nprogramming language QGCL is then proposed to support the paradigm of\nsuperposition of programs. This language can be seen as a quantum extension of\nDijkstra's GCL (Guarded Command Language). Surprisingly, alternation in GCL\nsplits into two different notions in the quantum setting: classical alternation\n(of quantum programs) and quantum alternation, with the latter being introduced\nin QGCL for the first time. Quantum alternation is the key program construct\nfor realizing the paradigm of superposition of programs.\n  The denotational semantics of QGCL are defined by introducing a new\nmathematical tool called the guarded composition of operator-valued functions.\nThen the weakest precondition semantics of QGCL can straightforwardly derived.\nAnother very useful program construct in realizing the quantum programming\nparadigm of superposition of programs, called quantum choice, can be easily\ndefined in terms of quantum alternation.

Under such conditions, explicit expressions of the bipartite and\ntripartite steering parameters are obtained, and the concept of collective\ntripartite quantum steering, recently introduced by He and Reid [Phys.

It is found that both bipartite\nand tripartite steering parameters are sensitive functions of the initial state\nof the modes and distinctly different steering behaviour could be observed\ndepending on whether the modes were initially in a thermal state or not. We\nfind that the initial thermal noise is more effective in destroying the\nbipartite rather than the tripartite steering which, on the other hand, can\npersist even for a large thermal noise.

Within this, the\ntheory of device-independent robust self-testing via Bell tests has reached a\nlevel of maturity now that many quantum states and measurements can be verified\nwithout direct access to the quantum systems: interaction with the devices is\nsolely classical. However, the requirements for this robust level of\nverification are daunting and require high levels of experimental accuracy. In\nthis paper we discuss the possibility of self-testing where we have direct\naccess to part of the quantum device. This motivates the study of self-testing\nvia EPR-steering, an intermediate form of entanglement verification between\nfull state tomography and a Bell test. Quantum non-locality implies\nEPR-steering so results in the former can apply in the latter, but we ask what\nadvantages may be gleaned from the latter over the former given that one can do\npartial state tomography. We show in the case of self-testing a maximally\nentangled two-qubit state, or ebit, EPR-steering allows for simpler analysis\nand better error tolerance than in the case of full device-independence.

For an odd occupancy of the dot and\nintermediate coupling to the reservoir, the Kondo effect can develop in the\nnormal state and screen the local magnetic moment of the dot. This leads to\nsinglet-doublet transitions that strongly affect the Josephson effect in a\nsingle-level quantum dot: the sign of the supercurrent changes from positive to\nnegative (0 to $\\pi$-junction). In the regime of strongest competition between\nthe Kondo effect and proximity effect, meaning that the Kondo temperature\nequals the superconducting gap, the magnetic state of the dot undergoes a first\norder quantum transition induced by the superconducting phase difference across\nthe junction. This is revealed experimentally by anharmonic current-phase\nrelations.

In\nthe resource theory of coherence free states are diagonal in some fixed basis,\nand free operations are those which cannot create coherence for some particular\nexperimental realization. Recently, some problems of this approach have been\ndiscussed, and new sets of operations have been proposed to resolve these\nproblems. As an example for such a problem, a quantum operation can be\nincoherent in one particular experimental realization, but it still can create\nlarge amount of coherence in another. This problem is resolved by the framework\nof genuine quantum coherence. Here, we investigate this concept further and\nstudy other more general sets of operations which cannot create coherence in\nany experimental realization. We analyze in detail the mathematical structure\nof this class of maps and use this to study possible state transformations\nunder these operations. We show that deterministic manipulation is severely\nlimited, even in the asymptotic settings. In particular, this framework does\nnot have a unique golden unit, i.e., there is no single state from which all\nother states can be created deterministically with the free operations. On the\nother hand, we show that these theories allow for a richer structure in what\ncomes to stochastic manipulation of states. In particular, we determine the\noptimal probability of conversion among pure states with genuinely incoherent\noperations. Still, the aforementioned limitations suggest that any reasonably\npowerful resource theory of coherence must contain free operations which can\npotentially create coherence in some experimental realization. \n\n"}

We propose a new resolution\nto the paradox: this violation cannot be explicitly checked by an infalling\nobserver in the finite proper time they have to live after crossing the\nhorizon. Our resolution depends on a weak relaxation of the no-drama condition\n(we call it \"little drama\") which is the \"complementarity dual\" of scrambling\nof information on the stretched horizon.

We provide a detailed\ntreatment of spin within this linear response approach, demonstrating that the\nconventional Hubbard $U$ formula, unlike the conventional DFT+$U$ corrective\nfunctional, incorporates interactions that are off-diagonal in the spin indices\nand places greater weight on one spin channel over the other. We construct\nalternative definitions for Hubbard and Hund's parameters that are consistent\nwith the contemporary DFT+$U$ functional, expanding upon the minimum-tracking\nlinear response method. This approach allows Hund's $J$ and spin-dependent $U$\nparameters to be calculated with the same ease as for the standard Hubbard $U$.\nOur methods accurately reproduce the experimental band gap, local magnetic\nmoments, and the valence band edge character of manganese oxide, a canonical\nstrongly-correlated system.

In this framework, we establish a lower bound on the one-shot EA\nprivate capacity. When there exists a quantum channel mapping the state of the\ndecoding set to the state of the malicious set, such a broadcast channel is\nsaid to be degraded.

Several proposals for entangling gates in\nsuperconducting qubits tune the flux bias away from these spots, thus\nreintroducing the dephasing problem to varying degrees. Here we revisit one\nsuch proposal, where interactions are parametrically activated by rapidly\nmodulating the flux bias of the qubits around these sweet-spots, and study the\neffect of modulation on the sensitivity to flux noise. We explicitly calculate\nhow dephasing rates depend on different components of the flux-noise spectrum,\nand show that, while these parametric gates are insensitive to $1/f$ flux\nnoise, dephasing rates are increased under modulation, and dominated by white\nnoise. Remarkably, we find that simple filtering of the flux control signal\nallows for entangling gates to operate in a novel sweet-spot for dephasing\nunder flux modulation. This sweet spot, which we dub the AC sweet spot, is\ninsensitive to $1/f$ flux noise, and much less sensitive to white noise in the\ncontrol electronics, allowing for interactions of quality that is limited only\nby higher order effects and other sources of noise. \n\n"}

The evolution paths are produced, using the generic control Hamiltonians\nH(\\tau) that preserve the bit symmetry of the underlying optimization problem.\nIn the case where the ground state of H(0) coincides with the totally-symmetric\nstate of an n-qubit system the algorithm dynamics is completely described in\nterms of the motion of a spin-n/2.\n  We show that different control Hamiltonians can be parameterized by a set of\nindependent parameters that are expansion coefficients of H(\\tau) in a certain\nuniversal set of operators. Only one of these operators can be responsible for\navoiding the tunnelling in the spin-n/2 system during the quantum adiabatic\nalgorithm.

First, we compare them with\ntheir classical counterparts. We show that, if an automaton is required to give\nthe correct answer with a large probability (over 0.98), then the power of\n1-way QFAs is equal to the power of 1-way reversible automata. However, quantum\nautomata giving the correct answer with smaller probabilities are more powerful\nthan reversible automata.\n  Second, we show that 1-way QFAs can be very space-efficient. Namely, we\nconstruct a 1-way QFA which is exponentially smaller than any equivalent\nclassical (even randomized) finite automaton. This construction may be useful\nfor design of other space-efficient quantum algorithms.\n  Third, we consider several generalizations of 1-way QFAs. Here, our goal is\nto find a model which is more powerful than 1-way QFAs keeping the quantum part\nas simple as possible. \n\n"}

A generic condition is presented for\nerror-less quantum computation: decoherence-free subspaces are spanned by those\nstates which are annihilated by all the generators. It is shown that these\nsubspaces are stable to perturbations and moreover, that universal quantum\ncomputation is possible within them. \n\n"}
