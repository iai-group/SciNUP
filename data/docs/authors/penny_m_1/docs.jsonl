A vast array of\nscience will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST will\nhave unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is\ndriven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking\nan inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and\nmapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system sited at\nCerro Pach\\'{o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m\neffective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel\ncamera. The standard observing sequence will consist of pairs of 15-second\nexposures in a given field, with two such visits in each pointing in a given\nnight. With these repeats, the LSST system is capable of imaging about 10,000\nsquare degrees of sky in a single filter in three nights. The typical 5$\\sigma$\npoint-source depth in a single visit in $r$ will be $\\sim 24.5$ (AB). The\nproject is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations\nby 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg$^2$ with\n$\\delta<+34.5^\\circ$, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, $ugrizy$,\ncovering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. About 90\\% of the observing time\nwill be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will uniformly observe a\n18,000 deg$^2$ region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the\nanticipated 10 years of operations, and yield a coadded map to $r\\sim27.5$. The\nremaining 10\\% of the observing time will be allocated to projects such as a\nVery Deep and Fast time domain survey. The goal is to make LSST data products,\nincluding a relational database of about 32 trillion observations of 40 billion\nobjects, available to the public and scientists around the world. \n\n"}

Systematics and uncertainties of the\n  mid-infrared spectral analysis methods Abstract: The spectral region around 10 micrometer, showing prominent dust emission\nbands, is commonly used to derive the chemical composition of protoplanetary\ndust. Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, but so\nfar, no comparative test has been performed to test their validity. We\ncalculated model spectra of disk models with different geometries and central\nsources, using a 2D radiative transfer code. These spectra were then fitted in\na blind test using four different spectral decomposition methods. We studied\nthe effect of disk structure (flared vs. flat), inclination angle, size of the\ninner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition. Our\nresults show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate\nsystematically from the real chemical composition. Out of the four tested\nspectral decomposition methods, our new two-layer temperature distribution\nmethod, differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show\nthe weakest systematic effects. The reason for the deviations of the results\ngiven by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e.g. single\naverage grain temperature or one component continuum). We also tested the\ninfluence of different noise levels on the results of the spectral\ndecomposition methods.

In general, psi cannot be measured, but for transiting planets\none can measure the angle lambda between the sky projections of the two axes\nvia the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems. We find that the semi-major\naxis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the eccentricity\ndistribution is determined after the disk dissipation. We also find that there\nmay be an optimum disk mass which leads to the observed a-e distribution. Our\nsimulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in\nmean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's\nperturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed\nrate of MMRs.

As\nplanets are thought to form in circumstellar disks, one important question in\nplanet formation is determining whether, and to what degree, a gaseous disk\naffects an eccentric planet's orbit. Recent studies have probed the interaction\nbetween a disk and a terrestrial planet on an eccentric orbit, and the\ninteraction between a disk and a gas giant on a nearly circular orbit, but\nlittle is known about the interaction between a disk and an eccentric gas\ngiant.

Using a Monte Carlo approach, we select the\nphysical parameters of the binary lens system, a star hosting a planet, and we\ncalculate the pixel-lensing light curve taking into account the finite source\neffects. Indeed, their inclusion is crucial since the sources in M31\nmicrolensing events are mainly giant stars. Light curves with detectable\nplanetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from the\ncorresponding Paczy\\'{n}ski shapes. We find that the time scale of planetary\ndeviations in light curves increase (up to 3-4 days) as the source size\nincreases. This means that only few exposures per day, depending also on the\nrequired accuracy, may be sufficient to reveal in the light curve a planetary\ncompanion. Although the mean planet mass for the selected events is about $2\nM_{\\rm {Jupiter}}$, even small mass planets ($M_{\\rm P} < 20 M_{\\oplus}$) can\ncause significant deviations, at least in the observations with large\ntelescopes. However, even in the former case, the probability to find\ndetectable planetary features in pixel-lensing light curves is at most a few\npercent of the detectable events, and therefore many events have to be\ncollected in order to detect an extrasolar planet in M31.

Planet\nformation itself as well as photoevaporation by energetic radiation from the\ncentral young stellar object have been proposed as plausible dispersal\nmechanisms. [abridged]. In this paper we use the different metallicity\ndependance of X-ray photoevaporation and planet formation to discriminate\nbetween these two processes. We study the effects of metallicity, Z, on the\ndispersal timescale, t_phot, in the context of a photoevaporation model, by\nmeans of detailed thermal calculations of a disc in hydrostatic equilibrium\nirradiated by EUV and X-ray radiation from the central source. Our models show\nt_phot \\propto Z^0.52 for a pure photoevaporation model. By means of analytical\nestimates we derive instead a much stronger negative power dependance on\nmetallicity of the disc lifetime for a dispersal model based on planet\nformation. A census of disc fractions in lower metallicity regions should\ntherefore be able to distinguish between the two models. A recent study by\nYasui et al. in low metallicity clusters of the extreme outer Galaxy ([O/H] ~-\n0.7dex and dust to gas ratio of ~0.001) provides preliminary observational\nevidence for shorter disc lifetimes at lower metallicities, in agreement with\nthe predictions of a pure photoevaporation model.

However, limits on the intervening interstellar gas column\ndensity from an optical spectrum of HD 61005 in the Na I D lines render this\npossibility unlikely. Instead, HD 61005 may be embedded in a more typical warm,\nlow-density cloud that introduces secular perturbations to dust grain orbits.\nThis mechanism can significantly distort the ensemble disk structure within a\ntypical cloud crossing time. For a counterintuitive relative flow\ndirection--parallel to the disk midplane--we find that the structures generated\nby these distortions can very roughly approximate the HD 61005 morphology.\nFuture observational studies constraining the direction of the relative\ninterstellar medium flow will thus provide an important constraint for future\nmodeling.

The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri\nstars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar\nX-ray luminosity, but can be produced by varying these together with the disk\nmagnetic flux. The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling\nof grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence,\nthrough three effects: (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically\ninactive dead zone extending above two scale heights, while turbulence in the\nmagnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only\nabout one scale height. (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically\nin waves driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the\nlaminar rates, so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk\natmosphere becomes dust-depleted. (3) With sufficient depletion, the dead zone\nis thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The MHD results also\nshow that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of dust into the\natmosphere.

In particular, they\ndetected an offset in the expected equilibrium position of Janus, and a large\nlibration of Epimetheus. We here propose to give a 3-dimensional theory of the\nrotation of these satellites in using these observed data, and to compare it to\nthe observed rotations.

We investigate the hypothesis that the\ndestruction of solid bodies may produce pockets of cool, high-metallicity gas\nthat could explain these abundance discrepancies. Under the assumption of\nmaximally efficient radiative ablation, we derive two fundamental constraints\nthat the solid bodies must satisfy in order that their evaporation during the\nplanetary nebula phase should generate a high enough gas phase metallicity. A\nlocal constraint implies that the bodies must be larger than tens of meters,\nwhile a global constraint implies that the total mass of the solid body\nreservoir must exceed a few hundredths of a solar mass. This mass greatly\nexceeds the mass of any population of comets or large debris particles expected\nto be found orbiting evolved low- to intermediate-mass stars.

We show that, as tidal interaction with the central\nstar leads to small eccentricities, the planets in this system could be\nundergoing resonant coupling even though the period ratios depart significantly\nfrom very precise commensurability. In a three planet system, this is indicated\nby the fact that resonant angles librate or are associated with long term\nchanges to the orbital elements. We propose that the planets in HD 40307 were\nin a strict Laplace resonance while they migrated through the disc. After\nentering the disc inner cavity, tidal interaction would cause the period ratios\nto increase from two but with the inner pair deviating less than the outer\npair, counter to what occurs in HD 40307. However, the relationship between\nthese pairs that occurs in HD 40307 might be produced if the resonance is\nimpulsively modified by an event like a close encounter shortly after the\nplanetary system decouples from the disc.

Previous numerical investigations of this problem\n(Lodato & Pringle 2007) did not find a good agreement between the numerical\nresults and the predictions of the analytic theories of warp propagation, both\nin the linear and in the non-linear case. Here, we take advantage of a new,\nlow-memory and highly efficient SPH code to run a large set of very high\nresolution simulations (up to 20 million SPH particles) of warp propagation,\nimplementing an isotropic disc viscosity in different ways, to investigate the\norigin of the discrepancy between the theory and the numerical results. Our new\nand improved analysis now shows a remarkable agreement with the analytic theory\nboth in the linear and in the non-linear regime, in terms of warp diffusion\ncoefficient and precession rate.

Using a\npopulation model, we find that the statistics and trends can be reproduced with\na self-stirring model of planetesimal belts with radii distributed between\n15-120AU. Disks must have this 15AU minimum radius to show a peak in disk\nfraction, rather than a monotonic decline. Populations of extended disks with\nfixed inner and/or outer radii fail to fit the statistics, due mainly to the\nslow 70um evolution as stirring moves further out in the disk. This conclusion,\nthat debris disks are narrow belts, is independent of the significance of 24um\ntrends for young A-stars. We show that the statistics can also be reproduced\nwith a model in which disks are stirred by secular perturbations from a nearby\neccentric planet. Detailed imaging is therefore the best way to characterise\nthe stirring mechanism.

Our sample is the largest\nsingle-survey, untargeted, spectroscopically classified, homogeneous collection\nof core-collapse events ever assembled, spanning a wide host-galaxy luminosity\nrange (down to M_r ~ -14 mag) and including a substantial fraction (>20%) of\ndwarf (M_r >= -18 mag) hosts.

We use detailed\nsubclassifications of stripped-envelope core-collapse SNe and find that all\nType I core-collapse events occurring in dwarf galaxies are either SNe Ib or\nbroad-lined SNe Ic (SNe Ic-BL), while \"normal\" SNe Ic dominate in giant\ngalaxies.

To improve\nthe characterization of planetary systems, we describe how aliases originate\nand present a new approach for distinguishing between orbital frequencies and\ntheir aliases.

In such configuration, the system loses the axisymmetry\npresented in the aligned case, requiring a fully 3D approach.

We show that the magnetic field lines\npresent an oscillatory pattern and that by increasing the misalignment angle,\nthe wind velocity increases. Our wind models allow us to study the interaction\nof a magnetized wind with a magnetized extra-solar planet. Such interaction\ngives rise to reconnection, generating electrons that propagate along the\nplanet's magnetic field lines and produce electron cyclotron radiation at radio\nwavelengths.

Low\nHI columns (<2 M_solar/pc^2) contribute most of the mass in the outer disk,\nwhich is not the case within r25. The time for star formation to consume the\navailable HI, inferred from the ratio of HI to FUV intensity, rises with\nincreasing radius before leveling off at ~100 Gyr, i.e., many Hubble times,\nnear ~1.7 r25. Assuming the relatively short H2 depletion times observed in the\ninner parts of galaxies hold in outer disks, the conversion of HI into bound,\nmolecular clouds seems to limit star formation in outer galaxy disks. The long\nconsumption times suggest that most of the extended HI observed in M83 will not\nbe consumed by in situ star formation. However, even these low star formation\nrates are enough to expect moderate chemical enrichment in a closed outer disk. \n\n"}

There are modest differences\nbetween the methods which can be recognised as arising from particular criteria\nthat they adopt. What both processes deliver is a quantitative selection\nprocess such that one can use them to draw quantitative conclusions about\nplanetary frequency and orbital parameter distribution from a given data set.\nAveraging over all 24 stars, in the period range P<300 days and the\neccentricity range 0.0<e<0.6, we could have detected 99% of planets with\nvelocity amplitudes K>7.1 m/s.

Only cloud cores with high enough M_cl or \\beta may eventually form\nwide-separation binary/multiple systems with low mass ratios and brown dwarf or\nsub-solar mass companions. It is feasible that such systems may eventually\nbreak up, giving birth to rogue brown dwarfs. Protostellar disks of {\\it equal}\nage formed from cloud cores of greater mass (but equal \\beta) are generally\ndenser, hotter, larger, and more massive.

II.\n  Measuring the Size of the \"Frozen\" Zone Abstract: Coagulation of submicron-sized dust grains into porous aggregates is the\ninitial step of dust evolution in protoplanetary disks. Recently, it has been\npointed out that negative charging of dust in the weakly ionized disks could\nsignificantly slow down the coagulation process. In this paper, we apply the\ngrowth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (\"frozen\" zone)\nwhere the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage. For\nlow-turbulence disks, we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of\nthe disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star. The maximum mass of the\naggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer\nmasses at 100 AU. Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the\nfrozen zone, but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic\naggregates at later stages. We examine a possibility that complete freezeout of\ndust evolution in low-turbulence disks could be prevented by global transport\nof dust in the disks. Our simple estimation shows that global dust transport\ncan lead to the supply of macroscopic aggregates and the removal of frozen\naggregates on a timescale of 10^6 yr. This overturns the usual understanding\nthat tiny dust particles get depleted on much shorter timescales unless\ncollisional fragmentation is effective.

Abstract: The standard model of planet formation considers an initial phase in which\nplanetesimals form from a dust disk, followed by a phase of mutual\nplanetesimal-planetesimal collisions, leading eventually to the formation of\nplanetary embryos. However, there is a potential transition phase (which we\ncall the \"snowball phase\"), between the formation of the first planetesimals\nand the onset of mutual collisions amongst them, which has often been either\nignored or underestimated in previous studies. In this snowball phase, isolated\nplanetesimals move on Keplerian orbits and grow solely via the direct accretion\nof sub-cm sized dust entrained with the gas in the protoplanetary disk. Using a\nsimplified model in which planetesimals are progressively produced from the\ndust, we consider the expected sizes to which the planetesimals can grow before\nmutual collisions commence and derive the dependence of this size on a number\nof critical parameters, including the degree of disk turbulence, the\nplanetesimal size at birth and the rate of planetesimal creation. For systems\nin which turbulence is weak and the planetesimals are created at a low rate and\nwith relatively small birth size, we show that the snowball growth phase can be\nvery important, allowing planetesimals to grow by a factor of 10^6 in mass\nbefore mutual collisions take over.

We consider two scenarios: (1) the stellar magnetic field\nis strong enough to confine the hot coronal plasma out to the planetary orbit\nand (2) the stellar magnetic field is unable to confine the plasma, which\nescapes in a wind. In both cases, a shock capable of compressing plasma to the\nobserved densities will form around the planet for plasma temperatures T < (4 -\n5) x 10^6 K. In the confined case, the shock always forms directly ahead of the\nplanet, but in the wind case the shock orientation depends on the wind speed\nand hence on the plasma temperature.

Strong C II lines are present until\n~2 weeks past maximum, which is unprecedented in thermonuclear SNe. The ejecta\nvelocities are significantly lower than in normal and even subluminous SNe Ia.\nNo signatures of CSM interaction are found in the spectra. Assuming that the\nlight curves are powered by radioactive decay, analytic modelling suggests that\nSN 2009dc produced ~1.8 solar masses of 56Ni assuming the smallest possible\nrise time of 22 d. Together with a derived total ejecta mass of ~2.8 solar\nmasses, this confirms that SN 2009dc is a member of the class of possible\nsuper-Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia similar to SNe 2003fg, 2006gz and 2007if. A\nstudy of the hosts of SN 2009dc and other superluminous SNe Ia reveals a\ntendency of these SNe to explode in low-mass galaxies. A low metallicity of the\nprogenitor may therefore be an important pre-requisite for producing\nsuperluminous SNe Ia. We discuss a number of explosion scenarios, ranging from\nsuper-Chandrasekhar-mass white-dwarf progenitors over dynamical white-dwarf\nmergers and Type I 1/2 SNe to a core-collapse origin of the explosion. None of\nthe models seem capable of explaining all properties of SN 2009dc, so that the\ntrue nature of this SN and its peers remains nebulous. \n\n"}

Without some stopping mechanism, the tidal, resonant\ninteraction between planets and their gaseous disc generally causes the planets\nto migrate inward so efficiently that they plunge into the host star within the\ngaseous disc lifetime ($\\sim $ 1-3 Myrs). We investigate planetary migration by\nanalytically calculating the migration rate and time within self-consistently\ncomputed, radiatively heated discs around M stars in which the effects of dust\nsettling are included. We show that dust settling lowers the disc temperature\nand raises the gas density in the mid-plane. This inescapable evolution of disc\nstructure speeds up type I planetary migration for lower mass bodies by up to a\nfactor of about 2. We also examine the effects of dust settling on the\ngap-opening mass and type II migration, and find that the gap-opening mass is\nreduced by a factor of 2 and type II migration becomes slower by a factor of 2.\nWhile dust settling can somewhat alleviate the problem of planetary migration\nfor more massive planets, the more rapid migration of low mass planets and\nplanetary cores requires a robust slowing mechanism. \n\n"}

A small neighborhood of the solar nebula is represented by an\norbiting patch of gas at a radius of 3 AU, and includes vertical stratification\nof the gas density. The differential rotation of the nebular gas is replaced by\na shear flow. Turbulence is driven by destabilization of the flow as a result\nof the magnetorotational instability (MRI), whereby magnetic field lines\nanchored to the gas are continuously stretched by the shearing motion. A\npassive contaminant mimics small dust grains that are aerodynamically well\ncoupled to the gas, and chondrules are modeled by Lagrangian particles that\ninteract with the gas through drag. Whenever a chondrule enters a region\npermeated by dust, its radius grows at a rate that depends on the local dust\ndensity and the relative velocity between itself and the dust. The local dust\nabundance decreases accordingly. Different chondrule volume densities lead to\nvarying depletion and rimmed-chondrule size growth times. Most of the dust\nsweep-up occurs within 1 gas scale height of the nebula midplane. Chondrules\ncan reach their asymptotic radius in 10 to 800 years. The vertical variation of\nnebula turbulent intensity results in a moderate dependence of mean\nrimmed-chondrule size with nebula height. The technique used here could be\ncombined with Monte Carlo (MC) methods that include the physics of dust\ncompaction, in a self-consistent MHD-MC model of dust rim growth around\nchondrules in the solar nebula. \n\n"}

For slightly increased\nlevels of jitter ($\\sim 4.5\\,m\\,s^{-1}$) the eccentricity of the inner planet\ncan be in the range $0<e_{inner}<0.07$, the period and eccentricity of the\nouter planet can be $440<P_{outer}<470$ days and $0.55<e_{outer}<0.85$\nrespectively, while the relative pericenter alignment, $\\eta$, of the planets\ncan take essentially any value $-180^{\\circ}<\\eta<+180^{\\circ}$.

The\nscheme treats the steady state portion of the cascade by equating mass loss and\ngain in each size bin; the smallest particles are expected to reach steady\nstate on their collision timescale, while larger particles retain their\nprimordial distribution. For collision-dominated disks, steady state means that\nmass loss rates in logarithmic size bins are independent of size. This\nprescription reproduces the expected two phase size distribution, with ripples\nabove the blow-out size, and above the transition to gravity-dominated\nplanetesimal strength. The scheme also reproduces the expected evolution of\ndisk mass, and of dust mass, but is computationally much faster than evolving\ndistributions forward in time. For low-mass disks, P-R drag causes a turnover\nat small sizes to a size distribution that is set by the redistribution\nfunction (the mass distribution of fragments produced in collisions).

All the previous studies on the core-accretion\nmodel assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly. In fact,\nthe envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals\nbecause icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via\nstrong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope.

Irradiation is\nknown to weaken the strength of disc self-gravity, and can suppress it entirely\nif the disc is maintained above the threshold for linear instability. However,\nits impact on the susceptibility of the disc to fragmentation is less clear. We\nuse two-dimensional numerical simulations to investigate the evolution of\nself-gravitating discs as a function of the local cooling time and strength of\nirradiation. In the regime where the disc does not fragment, we show that local\nthermal equilibrium continues to determine the stress - which can be\nrepresented as an effective viscous alpha - out to very long cooling times (at\nleast 240 dynamical times). In this regime, the power spectrum of the\nperturbations is uniquely set by the effective viscous alpha and not by the\ncooling rate. Fragmentation occurs for cooling times tau < beta_crit / Omega,\nwhere beta_crit is a weak function of the level of irradiation. We find that\nbeta_crit declines by approximately a factor of two, as irradiation is\nincreased from zero up to the level where instability is almost quenched. The\nnumerical results imply that irradiation cannot generally avert fragmentation\nof self-gravitating discs at large radii; if other angular momentum transport\nsources are weak mass will build up until self-gravity sets in, and\nfragmentation will ensue. \n\n"}

Highly excited H2O emission in spatially unresolved\nSpitzer/IRS spectra of a low-mass Class 0 object, NGC 1333 IRAS 4B, has\npreviously been attributed to the envelope-disk accretion shock but could\ninstead be produced in an outflow.

The highly excited component of H2O emission is characterized by\nsubthermal excitation of 1500 K gas with a density of 10^5 - 10^7 cm-3,\nconditions that also reproduce the mid-IR H2O emission detected by Spitzer. On\nthe other hand, a high density, low temperature gas can reproduce the H2O\nspectrum observed by Spitzer but underpredicts the H2O lines seen by Herschel.\nNyquist-sampled spectral maps of several lines show two spatial components of\nH2O emission, one centered at 1200 AU south of the central source at the\nposition of the blueshifted outflow lobe and a second centered on-source. Both\nspatial components of the far-IR H2O emission are consistent with emission from\nthe outflow.

These events were\ndiscovered as a byproduct of an analysis designed to find short timescale\nsingle lens events that may be due to free-floating planets. Three of these\nevents are determined to be microlensing events, while the fourth is most\nlikely caused by stellar variability. For each of the three microlensing\nevents, the signal is almost entirely due to a brief caustic feature with\nlittle or no lensing attributable mainly to the lens primary. One of these\nevents, MOA-bin-1, is due to a planet, and it is the first example of a\nplanetary event in which stellar host is only detected through binary\nmicrolensing effects. The mass ratio and separation are q = 4.9 +- 1.4 x\n10^{-3} and s = 2.10 +- 0.05, respectively. A Bayesian analysis based on a\nstandard Galactic model indicates that the planet, MOA-bin-1Lb, has a mass of\nm_p = 3.7 +- 2.1 M_{Jup}, and orbits a star of M_* = 0.75{+0.33 -0.41} M_solar\nat a semi-major axis of a = 8.3 {+4.5 -2.7} AU.

However, the only numerical\nevidence for this has come from alpha disk models, where the magnetic field\nevolution is not followed, and the effect of turbulence is parametrized by\nLaplacian viscosity. We aim to establish the phenomenology of the flow in the\ntransition in 3D resistive-magnetohydrodynamical models. We model the\ntransition by a sharp jump in resistivity, as expected in the inner dead zone\nboundary, using the Pencil Code to simulate the flow. We find that vortices are\nreadily excited in the dead side of the transition. We measure the mass\naccretion rate finding similar levels of Reynolds stress at the dead and active\nzones, at the $\\alpha\\approx 10^{-2}$ level. The vortex sits in a pressure\nmaximum and does not migrate, surviving until the end of the simulation. A\npressure maximum in the active zone also triggers the RWI. The magnetized\nvortex that results should be disrupted by parasitical magneto-elliptic\ninstabilities, yet it subsists in high resolution. This suggests that either\nthe parasitic modes are still numerically damped, or that the RWI supplies\nvorticity faster than they can destroy it. We conclude that the resistive\ntransition between the active and dead zones in the inner regions of\nprotoplanetary disks, if sharp enough, can indeed excite vortices via RWI. Our\nresults lend credence to previous works that relied on the alpha-disk\napproximation, and caution against the use of overly reduced azimuthal coverage\non modeling this transition. \n\n"}

The difference between\nthe ongoing, instantaneous accretion rates witnessed at DAZ white dwarfs, which\noften exceed 1e8 g/s, and those inferred over the past 1e5-1e6 yr for the DBZ\nstars can be a few orders of magnitude, and therefore must result from\nhigh-rate episodes of tens to hundreds of years so they remain undetected to\ndate. This paper explores the likelihood that such brief, intense accretion\nepisodes of gas-phase material can account for existing data. For reasonable\nassumptions about the circumstellar gas, accretion rates approaching or\nexceeding 1e15 g/s are possible, similar to rates observed in quiescent\ncataclysmic variables, and potentially detectable with future x-ray missions or\nwide-field monitoring facilities. Gaseous debris that is prone to such rapid\naccretion may be abundant immediately following a tidal disruption event via\ncollisions and sublimation, or if additional bodies impinge upon an extant\ndisk. Particulate disk matter accretes at or near the Poynting-Robertson drag\nrate for long periods between gas-producing events, consistent with rates\ninferred for dusty DAZ white dwarfs. In this picture, warm DAZ stars without\ninfrared excesses have rates consistent with accretion from particulate disks\nthat remain undetected.

The small semimajor axes\nof the three planets suggest that migration stopped at the inner edge of the\nprimordial gas disk. In this paper we focus on the influence of migration\nhalting mechanisms, including migration \"dead zones\", and inner truncation by\nthe stellar magnetic field. We show that the stellar accretion rate, stellar\nmagnetic field and the speed of migration in the proto-planetary disk are the\nmain factors affecting the final configuration of KOI-152.

Under such formation scenario, the planets in the\nsystem are not massive enough to open gaps in the gas disk.

This field exceeds the dipolar field $B_d$,\nresponsible for the braking of the pulsar rotation, by at least one order of\nmagnitude. Neither magnetospheric currents nor small scale field components\ngenerated during neutron star's birth can provide such field structures in old\npulsars.

These magnetic spots can be\nlong-lived, thereby fulfilling the pre-conditions for the appearance of the\nradio pulsar activity.

Planet ejection can be avoided if the mass of the transplanetary disk\nof planetesimals was large (M_disk>50 M_Earth), but we found that a massive\ndisk would lead to excessive dynamical damping (e.g., final e_55 < 0.01\ncompared to present e_55=0.044, where e_55 is the amplitude of the fifth\neccentric mode in the Jupiter's orbit), and to smooth migration that violates\nconstraints from the survival of the terrestrial planets. Better results were\nobtained when the Solar System was assumed to have five giant planets initially\nand one ice giant, with the mass comparable to that of Uranus and Neptune, was\nejected into interstellar space by Jupiter. The best results were obtained when\nthe ejected planet was placed into the external 3:2 or 4:3 resonance with\nSaturn and M_disk ~ 20 M_Earth. The range of possible outcomes is rather broad\nin this case, indicating that the present Solar System is neither a typical nor\nexpected result for a given initial state, and occurs, in best cases, with only\na ~5% probability (as defined by the success criteria described in the main\ntext). The case with six giant planets shows interesting dynamics but does\noffer significant advantages relative to the five planet case. \n\n"}

The\nplanet light-curve is reanalysed using long and short cadence Kepler\nobservations from the first 14 quarters. Orbital period of the planet was\nimproved. We prove that the peculiar light-curve of this objects is in\nagreement with the idea of a planet with a comet like tail. There is an\nevidence of a quasi periodic long term evolution of the tail. Light-curve has a\nprominent pre-transit brightening and a less prominent post-transit\nbrightening. Both are caused by the forward scattering and are a strong\nfunction of the particle size. This feature enabled us to estimate a typical\nparticle size (radius) in the dust tail of about 0.1-1 micron. However, there\nis an indication that the particle size changes along the tail. Larger\nparticles better reproduce the pre-transit brightening and transit core while\nsmaller particles are more compatible with the egress and post-transit\nbrightening. Dust density in the tail is a steep decreasing function of the\ndistance from the planet which indicates a significant tail destruction caused\nby the star.

This light-curve with pre-transit\nbrightening is analogous to the light-curve of $\\epsilon$ Aur with mid-eclipse\nbrightening and forward scattering plays a significant role in such eclipsing\nsystems. \n\n"}

In the\nsingle-degenerate (SD) scenario, the interaction between the SN blast wave and\nthe outer layers of a main sequence (MS) companion star strips off H-rich\nmaterial which is then mixed into the ejecta. Strong contamination of the SN\nejecta with stripped material could lead to a conflict with observations of SNe\nIa. This constrains the SD progenitor model. In this work, our previous\nsimulations based on simplified progenitor donor stars have been updated by\nadopting more realistic progenitor-system models that result from fully\ndetailed, state-of-the-art binary evolution calculations. We use Eggleton's\nstellar evolution code including the optically thick accretion wind model and\nthe possibility of the effects of accretion disk instabilities to obtain\nrealistic models of companions for different progenitor systems. The impact of\nthe SN blast wave on these companion stars is followed in three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations employing the SPH code GADGET3. We find that the\nstripped masses range from 0.11 to 0.18 M_sun. The kick velocity is between 51\nand 105 km/s. We find that the stripped mass and kick velocity depend on the\nratio of the orbital separation to the radius of a companion. They can be\nfitted by a power law for a given companion model. However, the structure of\nthe companion star is also important for the amount of stripped material. With\nmore realistic companion star models than in previous studies, our simulations\nshow that the H masses stripped from companions are inconsistent with the best\nobservational limits (< 0.01 M_sun) derived from nebular spectra. However, a\nrigorous forward modeling based on impact simulations with radiation transfer\nis required to reliably predict observable signatures of the stripped H and to\nconclusively assess the viability of the considered SN Ia progenitor scenario. \n\n"}

Within this method, a concise\nexpression for the additional tidal potential, derived by MacDonald (1964; Rev.\nGeophys. 2, 467), is combined with an assumption that the Q factor is\nfrequency-independent (i.e., that the geometric lag angle is constant in time).\nThis makes the approach unphysical because MacDonald's derivation of the said\nformula was implicitly based on keeping the time lag frequency-independent,\nwhich is equivalent to setting Q to scale as the inverse tidal frequency. The\ncontradiction requires the MacDonald treatment of both non-resonant and\nresonant rotation to be rewritten.\n  The non-resonant case was reconsidered by Efroimsky & Williams (2009; CMDA\n104, 257), in application to spin modes distant from the major\ncommensurabilities. We continue this work by introducing the necessary\nalterations into the MacDonald-torque-based model of falling into a 1:1\nresonance. (For the original version of the model, see Goldreich 1966; AJ 71,\n1.)\n  We also study the effect of the triaxiality on both circulating and librating\nrotation near the synchronous state. Circulating rotation may evolve toward the\nlibration region or toward a spin rate larger than synchronous\n(pseudosynchronous spin). Which behaviour depends on the eccentricity, the\ntriaxiality of the primary, and the mass ratio of the secondary and primary\nbodies. The spin evolution will always stall for the oblate case. For\nsmall-amplitude librations, expressions are derived for the libration\nfrequency, damping rate, and average orientation.\n  However, the stability of pseudosynchronous spin hinges upon the dissipation\nmodel.

N-body methods are used to\ninvestigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions\nbetween cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs.

Transit detection\ndepends not only on the planet's radius and orbital period, but also on host\nstar properties. Thus, a sample of stars with transiting planets may not\naccurately represent the target population. Moreover, targets are selected\nusing criteria such as a limiting apparent magnitude. These selection effects,\ncombined with uncertainties in stellar radius, lead to biases in the properties\nof transiting planets and their host stars. We quantify possible biases in the\nKepler survey. First, Eddington bias produced by a steep planet radius\ndistribution and uncertainties in stellar radius results in a 15-20%\noverestimate of planet occurrence. Second, the magnitude limit of the Kepler\ntarget catalog induces Malmquist bias towards large, more luminous stars and\nunderestimation of the radii of about one third of candidate planets,\nespecially those larger than Neptune. Third, because metal-poor stars are\nsmaller, stars with detected planets will be very slightly (<0.02 dex) more\nmetal-poor than the target average.

We confirmed\nthat the spiral arms are formed due to a swing amplification mechanism that\nreinforces density enhancement as a seeded wake. In the damping phase, the\nCoriolis force exerted on a portion of the arm surpasses the gravitational\nforce that acts to shrink the portion. Consequently, the stars in the portion\nescape from the arm, and subsequently they form a new arm at a different\nlocation. The time-dependent nature of the spiral arms are originated in the\ncontinual repetition of this non-linear phenomenon. Since a spiral arm does not\nrigidly rotate, but follows the galactic differential rotation, the stars in\nthe arm rotate at almost the same rate as the arm. In other words, every single\nposition in the arm can be regarded as the co-rotation point. Due to\ninteraction with their host arms, the energy and angular momentum of the stars\nchange, thereby causing the radial migration of the stars. During this process,\nthe kinetic energy of random motion (random energy) of the stars does not\nsignificantly increase, and the disk remains dynamically cold. Owing to this\nlow degree of disk heating, the short-lived spiral arms can recurrently develop\nover many rotational periods. The resultant structure of the spiral arms in the\n$N$-body simulations is consistent with some observational nature of spiral\ngalaxies. We conclude that the formation and structure of spiral arms in\nisolated disk galaxies can be reasonably understood by non-linear interactions\nbetween a spiral arm and its constituent stars. \n\n"}

But if disks are\nturbulent, this neglects a spectrum of stochastic density fluctuations that can\nproduce rare, high-density mass concentrations. Here, we use a\nrecently-developed analytic framework to predict the statistics of these\nfluctuations, i.e. the rate of fragmentation and mass spectrum of fragments\nformed in a turbulent Keplerian disk. Turbulent disks are never completely\nstable: we calculate the (always finite) probability of forming\nself-gravitating structures via stochastic turbulent density fluctuations in\nsuch disks. Modest sub-sonic turbulence above Mach number ~0.1 can produce a\nfew stochastic fragmentation or 'direct collapse' events over ~Myr timescales,\neven if Q>>1 and cooling is slow (t_cool>>t_orbit). In trans-sonic turbulence\nthis extends to Q~100. We derive the true Q-criterion needed to suppress such\nevents, which scales exponentially with Mach number.

Here, we study the underlying dynamical mechanisms which\ncan incite planetary escape in two-planet post-main sequence systems. Stellar\nmass loss alone is unlikely to be rapid and high enough to eject planets at\ntypically-observed separations.

To test the \"viscous criterion\", we compared gap\nproperties in MRI-turbulent disks to those in viscous HD disks having the same\nstress, and found that the same mass planet opens a significantly deeper and\nwider gap in net vertical flux MHD disks than in viscous HD disks. This\ndifference arises due to the efficient magnetic field transport into the gap\nregion in MRI disks, leading to a larger effective \\alpha within the gap. Thus,\nacross the gap, the Maxwell stress profile is smoother than the gap density\nprofile, and a deeper gap is needed for the Maxwell stress gradient to balance\nthe planetary torque density. We also confirmed the large excess torque close\nto the planet in MHD disks, and found that long-lived density features (termed\nzonal flows) produced by the MRI can affect planet migration. The comparison\nwith previous results from net toroidal flux/zero flux MHD simulations\nindicates that the magnetic field geometry plays an important role in the gap\nopening process. Overall, our results suggest that gaps can be commonly\nproduced by low mass planets in realistic protoplanetary disks, and caution the\nuse of a constant \\alpha-viscosity to model gaps in protoplanetary disks. \n\n"}

Using up-to-date\ndynamo scaling laws we predict the properties of core dynamo magnetic fields\nand study the influence of thermal evolution on their properties. The level of\nmagnetic protection of tidally locked and unlocked planets is estimated by\ncombining simplified models of the planetary magnetosphere and a\nphenomenological description of the stellar wind. Thermal evolution introduces\na strong dependence of magnetic protection on planetary mass and rotation rate.\nTidally locked terrestrial planets with an Earth-like composition would have\nearly dayside magnetospause distances between 1.5 and 4.0 Rp, larger than\npreviously estimated.

To reach a high photometric and spectroscopic\nprecision, it is therefore essential to correct for these effects.

We applied our method to data recorded with Kepler, focussing on a\nsample of lightcurves with different effective temperatures and flux\nmodulations.

However, during\ntheir early evolution in these substructured environments, stars can undergo\nclose encounters with one another that might have significant impacts on their\nprotoplanetary disks or young planetary systems. We perform N-body simulations\nof the early evolution of dissolving, substructured clusters with a wide range\nof properties, with the aim of quantifying the expected number and orbital\nelement distributions of encounters as a function of cluster properties.

The observations include the discoveries of\ntenuous nebulosity beyond the main dust belt detected to at least 209 AU\nprojected radius and a ~50 AU wide azimuthal gap in the belt northward of Fom\nb. The morphology of Fomalhaut b appears elliptical in the STIS detections. We\nshow that residual noise in the processed data can plausibly result in point\nsources appearing extended. A MCMC analysis demonstrates that the orbit of Fom\nb is highly eccentric, with e=0.8+/-0.1, a=177+/-68 AU, and q = 32+/-24 AU. Fom\nb is apsidally aligned with the belt and 90% of allowed orbits have mutual\ninclination 36 deg or less. Fomalhaut b's orbit is belt-crossing in projection,\nbut only 12% of possible orbits have nodes within a 25 AU wide belt annulus\n(133-158 AU). The high e invokes a dynamical history where Fom b may have\nexperienced a significant dynamical interaction with a hypothetical planet\nFomalhaut c, and the current orbital configuration may be relatively\nshort-lived. The new value for the periastron distance diminishes the Hill\nradius of Fom b and any weakly bound satellite system surrounding a planet\nwould be sheared and dynamically heated at periapse. We argue that Fom b's\nminimum mass is that of a dwarf planet in order for a circumplanetary satellite\nsystem to remain bound to a sufficient radius from the planet to be consistent\nwith the dust scattered light hypothesis. Fom b may be optically bright because\nthe recent passage through periapse and/or the ascending node has increased the\nerosion rates of planetary satellites.

The explanation in vogue borrows from the\nvortex literature by suggesting that these asymmetries are the result of dust\ntrapping in giant vortices, excited via Rossby wave instability (RWI) at\nplanetary gap edges. Due to the drag force, dust trapped in vortices will\naccumulate in the center, and diffusion is needed to maintain a steady state\nover the lifetime of the disk. While previous work derived semi-analytical\nmodels of the process, in this paper we provide analytical steady-state\nsolutions. Exact solutions exist for certain vortex models.

Observations of these\nsystems are becoming increasingly more precise and numerous, thus allowing for\ndetailed studies of their masses, radii, densities, temperatures, and\natmospheric compositions. However, one cannot accurately study exoplanets\nwithout examining their host stars in equal detail, and understanding what\nassumptions must be made to calculate planetary parameters from the directly\nderived observational parameters.\n  In this thesis, I present observations and models of the primary transits and\nsecondary eclipses of transiting exoplanets from both the ground and Kepler in\norder to better study their physical characteristics and search for additional\nexoplanets.

The JWST is capable of obtaining\nthe first spectroscopic measurements of such planets, yet there are no known\nplanets around WDs. Here we propose to take advantage of the unique capability\nof the Kepler spacecraft in the 2-Wheels mode to perform a transit survey that\nis capable of identifying the first planets in the habitable zone of a WD. We\npropose to obtain Kepler time-series photometry of 10,000 WDs in the SDSS\nimaging area to search for planets in the habitable zone. Thanks to the large\nfield of view of Kepler, for the first time in history, a large number of WDs\ncan be observed at the same time, which is essential for discovering transits.\nOur proposed survey requires a total of 200 days of observing time, and will\nfind up to 100 planets in the WD habitable zone. This survey will maintain\nKepler's spirit of searching for habitable Earths, but near new hosts. With\nfew-day observations and minute-cadences per field, it will also open up a\ncompletely unexplored discovery space. In addition to planets, this survey is\nsensitive to pulsating WDs, as well as eclipsing short period stellar and\nsubstellar companions. These have important implications for constraining the\ndouble WD merger rate and their contribution to Type Ia supernovae and the\ngravitational wave foreground.

These\nmodels allow us to determine the surface density at which thermal sweeping will\ntake over the disc's evolution and to evaluate this critical surface density as\na function of X-ray luminosity, stellar mass and inner hole radius. We find\nthat this critical surface density scales linearly with X-ray luminosity,\nincreases with inner hole radius and decreases with stellar mass and we develop\nan analytic model that reproduces these results.\n  This surface density criterion is then used to determine the evolutionary\nstate of protoplanetary discs at the point that they become unstable to\ndestruction by thermal sweeping. We find that transition discs created by\nphotoevaporation will undergo thermal sweeping when their inner holes reach\n20-40 AU, implying that transition discs with large holes and no accretion\n(which were previously a predicted outcome of the later stages of all flavours\nof photoevaporation model) will not form.\n  We emphasise that the surface density criteria that we have developed apply\nto all situations where the disc develops an inner hole that is optically thin\nto X-rays.

We employ a kinematic mean-field model for\npoloidal field transport and focus on steady states where inward advection of a\nfield balances with outward diffusion due to effective resistivities. We\nanalytically derive the steady-state radial distribution of poloidal fields in\nhighly conducting accretion disks. The analytic solution reveals an upper limit\non the strength of large-scale vertical fields attainable in steady states. Any\nexcess poloidal field will be diffused away within a finite time, and we\ndemonstrate this with time-dependent numerical calculations of the mean-field\nequations. We apply this upper limit to large-scale vertical fields threading\nprotoplanetary disks.

Systems with 3-6 low-mass planets (or planet\ncandidates) produce a diversity of minimum-mass disks with surface density\nprofiles ranging from Sigma r^-3.2 to Sigma r^0.5 (5th-95th percentile). By\nsimulating the transit detection of populations of synthetic planetary systems\ndesigned to match the properties of observed super-Earth systems, we show that\na universal disk profile is statistically excluded at high confidence. Rather,\nthe underlying distribution of minimum-mass disks is characterized by a broad\nrange of surface density slopes. Models of gaseous disks can only explain a\nnarrow range of slopes (roughly between r^0 and r^-1.5). Yet accretion of\nterrestrial planets in a gas-free environment preserves the initial radial\ndistribution of building blocks. The known systems of hot super-Earths must\ntherefore not represent the structure of their parent gas disks and can not\nhave predominantly formed in situ. We instead interpret the diversity of disk\nslopes as the imprint of a process that re-arranged the solids relative to the\ngas in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks.

Because these systems may be difficult to\nexplain in the paradigm of core accretion and disk migration, it has been\nsuggested that they formed in situ within protoplanetary disks with high solid\nsurface densities. The strong connection between giant planet occurrence and\nstellar metallicity is thought to be linked to enhanced solid surface densities\nin disks around metal-rich stars, so the presence of a giant planet can be a\ndetectable sign of planet formation in a high solid surface density disk. I\nformulate quantitative predictions for the frequency of long-period giant\nplanets in these in situ models of planet formation by translating the proposed\nincrease in disk mass into an equivalent metallicity enhancement. I rederive\nthe scaling of giant planet occurrence with metallicity as P_gp =\n0.05_{-0.02}^{+0.02} x 10^{(2.1 +/- 0.4) [M/H]} = 0.08_{-0.03}^{+0.02} x\n10^{(2.3 +/- 0.4) [Fe/H]} and show that there is significant tension between\nthe frequency of giant planets suggested by the minimum mass extrasolar nebula\nscenario and the observational upper limits.

A proposed explanation in terms of tidal effects on Oort cloud comet\nperturbations as the Solar System passes through the galactic midplane is\nhampered by lack of an underlying cause for sufficiently enhanced gravitational\neffects over a sufficiently short time interval and by the time frame between\nsuch possible enhancements. We show that a smooth dark disk in the galactic\nmidplane would address both these issues and create a periodic enhancement of\nthe sort that has potentially been observed. Such a disk is motivated by a\nnovel dark matter component with dissipative cooling that we considered in\nearlier work. We show how to evaluate the statistical evidence for periodicity\nby input of appropriate measured priors from the galactic model, justifying or\nruling out periodic cratering with more confidence than by evaluating the data\nwithout an underlying model. We find that, marginalizing over astrophysical\nuncertainties, the likelihood ratio for such a model relative to one with a\nconstant cratering rate is 3.0, which moderately favors the dark disk model.\nOur analysis furthermore yields a posterior distribution that, based on current\ncrater data, singles out a dark matter disk surface density of approximately 10\nsolar masses per square parsec.

While spatial\ninhomogeneities in cloud coverage and thickness are likely responsible for much\nof the observed variability, it is possible that some of the variations arise\nfrom atmospheric temperature fluctuations instead of, or in addition to,\nclouds. To better understand the role that thermal variability might play we\npresent a case study of brown dwarf variability using a newly-developed\none-dimensional, time-stepping model of atmospheric thermal structure. We focus\non the effects of thermal perturbations, intentionally simplifying the problem\nthrough omission of clouds and atmospheric circulation. Model results\ndemonstrate that thermal perturbations occurring deep in the atmosphere (at\npressures greater than 10 bar) of a model T-dwarf can be communicated to the\nupper atmosphere through radiative heating via the windows in near-infrared\nwater opacity. The response time depends on where in the atmosphere a thermal\nperturbation is introduced. We show that, for certain periodic perturbations,\nthe emission spectrum can have complex, time- and wavelength-dependent\nbehaviors, including phase shifts in times of maximum flux observed at\ndifferent wavelengths. Since different wavelengths probe different levels in\nthe atmosphere, these variations track a wavelength-dependent set of radiative\nexchanges happening between different atmospheric levels as a perturbation\nevolves in time.

Here I\ndemonstrate that equilibrium tides raised by a planet on its star can account\nfor three observed spin-orbit alignment trends: the aligned orbits of hot\nJupiters orbiting cool stars, the planetary mass cut-off for retrograde\nplanets, and the stratification by planet mass of cool host stars' rotation\nfrequencies. The first trend can be caused by strong versus weak magnetic\nbraking (the Kraft break), rather than realignment of the star's convective\nenvelope versus the entire star. The second trend can result from a small\neffective stellar moment of inertia participating in the tidal realignment in\nhot stars, enabling massive retrograde planets to partially realign to become\nprograde. The third trend is attributable to higher mass planets more\neffectively counteracting braking to spin up their stars. Both hot and cool\nstar require a small effective stellar moment of inertia participating in the\ntidal realignment, e.g., an outer layer weakly coupled to the interior. I\ndemonstrate via Monte Carlo that this model can match the observed trends and\ndistributions of sky-projected misalignments and stellar rotation frequencies.\nI discuss implications for inferring hot Jupiter migration mechanisms from\nobliquities, emphasizing that even hot stars do not constitute a pristine\nsample. \n\n"}

Particularly, those discs\nwhich photoevaporative models struggle to explain. Assuming the standard\npicture for how massive planets sculpt their parent discs, along with the\nobserved accretion rates in `transition' discs, we find that the accretion\nluminosity from the forming planet is significant, and can dominate over the\nstellar luminosity at the gap edge. This planetary accretion luminosity can\napply a significant radiation pressure to small ($s\\lesssim 1\\mu$m) dust\nparticles provided they are suitably decoupled from the gas. Secular evolution\ncalculations that account for the evolution of the gas and dust components in a\ndisc with an embedded, accreting planet, show that only with the addition of\nthe radiation pressure can we explain the full observed characteristics of a\n`transition' disc (NIR dip in the SED, mm cavity and high accretion rate). At\nsuitably high planet masses ($\\gtrsim 3-4$ M$_J$), radiation pressure from the\naccreting planet is able to hold back the small dust particles, producing a\nheavily dust-depleted inner disc that is optically thin (vertically and\nradially) to Infra-Red radiation. We use our models to calculate synthetic\nobservations and present a observational evolutionary scenario for a forming\nplanet, sculpting its parent disc. The planet-disc system will present as a\n`transition' disc with a dip in the SED, only when the planet mass and\nplanetary accretion rate is high enough.

Traditional planet formation\nmodels are at odds with these observations. They are also in contrast with the\nperiod ratios of radial-velocity-discovered multi-planet systems which tend to\npile up at 2:1 MMR.

We study the effects of\nplanetesimal disk interactions on planet pairs trapped in 2:1 MMR using planets\nof mass typical of the Kepler planet candidates (KPC) and explore large ranges\nfor the mass, and density profile of the planetesimal disk.

Turbulence can bring ice-coated\ndust grains from the midplane to the warm irradiated disk surface, and the ice\nmantles are reprocessed by photoreactions, thermal desorption, and surface\nreactions. The upward transport decreases the abundance of methanol and ammonia\nices at r < 30 AU, because warm dust temperature prohibits their reformation on\ngrain surfaces. This reprocessing could explain the smaller abundances of\ncarbon and nitrogen bearing molecules in cometary coma than those in low-mass\nprotostellar envelopes. We also show the effect of mixing on the synthesis of\ncomplex organic molecules (COMs) are two ways: (1) transport of ices from the\nmidplane to the disk surface and (2) transport of atomic hydrogen from the\nsurface to the midplane. The former enhances the COMs formation in the disk\nsurface, while the latter suppresses it in the midplane.

A method\nthat uses these constraints is planetary population synthesis. Its key element\nis a global model of planet formation and evolution that directly predicts\nobservable planetary properties based on properties of the natal protoplanetary\ndisk. To do so, global models build on many specialized models that address one\nspecific physical process. We thoroughly review the physics of the sub-models\nincluded in global formation models. The sub-models can be classified as models\ndescribing the protoplanetary disk (gas and solids), the (proto)planet (solid\ncore, gaseous envelope, and atmosphere), and finally the interactions\n(migration and N-body interaction). We compare the approaches in different\nglobal models and identify physical processes that require improved\ndescriptions in future. We then address important results of population\nsynthesis like the planetary mass function or the mass-radius relation. In\nthese results, the global effects of physical mechanisms occurring during\nplanet formation and evolution become apparent, and specialized models\ndescribing them can be put to the observational test. Due to their nature as\nmeta models, global models depend on the development of the field of planet\nformation theory as a whole.

Though\ncounterintuitive, this assertion follows directly from stellar tidal\ninteraction theory and the evolution of lower mass stars. There is strong\nevidence that chromospheric activity of rapidly rotating young stars may be\nhigh enough to cause mass loss from atmospheres of potentially habitable\nplanets. The removal of atmospheric water is most critical. Tidal breaking in\nbinaries could help reduce magnetic dynamo action and thereby chromospheric\nactivity in favor of life. We call this the Binary Habitability Mechanism\n(BHM), that we suggest allows for water retention at levels comparable to or\nbetter than Earth. We discuss novel advantages that life may exploit, in these\ncases, and suggest that life may even thrive on some circumbinary planets. We\nfind that while many binaries do not benefit from BHM, high quality niches do\nexist for various combinations of stars between 0.55 and 1.0 solar masses. For\na given pair of stellar masses, BHM operates only for certain combinations of\nperiod and eccentricity.

We study the impact of the presence of planets on the lithium abundance\nof host stars and evaluate the previous claim that planet hosts exhibit lithium\ndepletion when compared to their non-host counterparts.\n  Methods. Using previously published lithium abundances, we remove the\nconfounding effect of the different fundamental stellar parameters by applying\na multivariable regression on our dataset. In doing so, we explicitly make an\nassumption made implicitly by different authors: that lithium abundance depends\nlinearly on fundamental stellar parameters. Using a moderator variable to\ndistinguish stars with planets from those without, we evaluate the existence of\nan offset in lithium abundances between the two groups. We perform this\nanalysis first for stars that present a clear lithium detection exclusively and\ninclude in a second analysis upper lithium measurements.\n  Results. Our analysis shows that under the above-mentioned assumption of\nlinearity, a statistically significant negative offset in lithium abundance\nbetween planet hosts and non-hosts is recovered. We concluded that an inflation\non the lithium uncertainty estimations by a factor of larger than 5 is required\nto render the measured offset compatible with zero at less than 3-4 {\\sigma}\nand make it non-significant.

The inhibition of the convective blueshift inside active\nregions is considered, as well as the limb brightening effect of plages, a\nquadratic limb darkening law, and a realistic spot and plage contrast ratio.\nSOAP 2.0 shows that the activity-induced variation of plages is dominated by\nthe inhibition of the convective blueshift effect. For spots, this effect\nbecomes significant only for slow rotators. In addition, in the case of a major\nactive region dominating the activity-induced signal, the ratio between the\nfull width at half maximum (FWHM) and the RV peak-to-peak amplitudes of the\ncross correlation function can be used to infer the type of active region\nresponsible for the signal for stars with \\vsini$\\le8$\\kms.

Our goal is to characterise the\nhydrodynamical properties of the atmospheres of such embedded planets and their\nimplication for their (long-term) evolution. In this paper -- the first in\nseries -- we start to investigate the properties of an isothermal and inviscid\nflow past a small, embedded planet by conducting local, 2D hydrodynamical\nsimulations. Using the PLUTO code we confirm that the flow is steady and bound.\nThis steady outcome is most apparent for the log-polar grid (with the grid\nspacing proportional to the distance from the planet). For low-mass planets,\nCartesian grids are somewhat less efficient as they have difficulty to follow\nthe circular, large speeds in the deep atmosphere. Relating the amount of\nrotation to the gas fraction of the atmosphere, we find that more massive\natmospheres rotate faster -- a finding consistent with Kelvin's circulation\ntheorem. Rotation therefore limits the amount of gas that planets can acquire\nfrom the nebula. Dependent on the Toomre-Q parameter of the circumstellar disc,\nthe planet's atmosphere will reach Keplerian rotation before self-gravity\nstarts to become important. \n\n"}

There is an extra increase in\nradius of planets if $l_-$ is higher than 1100 times energy received by the\nEarth ($l_\\oplus$). This is likely due to dissociation of molecules. The tidal\ninteraction as a heating mechanism is also considered and found that its\nmaximum effect on the inflation of planets is about 15 per cent.

In the former, an abundance of resonant chains is\nexpected, which the Kepler data do not support. In the latter, required disk\nmass surface densities may be too high.

However, there\nis a maximum at a stellar mass of 1.9 +0.1/-0.5 M_Sun, and the occurrence rate\ndrops rapidly for masses larger than 2.5-3.0 M_Sun. We do not find any planets\naround stars more massive than 2.7 M_Sun, although there are 113 stars with\nmasses between 2.7 and 5 M_Sun in our sample (corresponding to a giant planet\noccurrence rate < 1.6% at 68.3% confidence in that stellar mass bin).

We confirmed that the\nestimated $T_{\\rm{eff}}$ and $\\log g$ values of the 34 superflare stars are\nroughly in the range of solar-type stars.

For\ninstance, stellar companions may have facilitated the inward migration of hot\nJupiters towards to their present day positions. Many observed short period gas\ngiant planets also have orbits that are misaligned with respect to their star's\nspin axis, which has also been attributed to the presence of a massive outer\ncompanion on a non-coplanar orbit.

Our\nsimulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the\nefficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization\nif radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams\nself-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the\nintersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a\ngeometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring\nrapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a\ngeometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is\nefficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and\nforms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated\nenergy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the\nsubsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to\n~2*10^{52} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10^6 Msun black hole. We also find\nthat a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced\ncircularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning\nblack hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably\nlong in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black\nhole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important\nnodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the\nother hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in\nthe radiatively inefficient case. We also discuss the relationship between our\nsimulations and the parabolic TDEs that are characteristic of most stellar\ntidal disruptions. \n\n"}

These orbits have forced eccentric motion aligned\nwith the binary as well as higher frequency oscillations, yet they do not\ncross, even in the presence of massive disks and perturbations from large\nplanets. For this reason, dissipative gas and planetesimals can settle onto\nthese \"most circular\" orbits, facilitating the growth of protoplanets. Outside\na region close to the binary where orbits are generally unstable, circumbinary\nplanets form in much the same way as their cousins around a single star.

This is beyond the\noriginal calibration plans of current observatories, hence the necessity to\ndisentangle the instrumental systematics from the astrophysical signals in raw\ndatasets. Most methods used in the literature are based on an approximate\ninstrument model. The choice of parameters of the model and their functional\nforms can sometimes be subjective, causing controversies in the literature.\nRecently, Morello et al.

Said method is based\non Independent Component Analysis (ICA) of individual pixel time-series,\nhereafter \"pixel-ICA\". The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the\nlimits and advantages of pixel-ICA on a series of simulated datasets with\ndifferent instrument properties, and a range of jitter timescales and shapes,\nnon-stationarity, sudden change points, etc. The performances of pixel-ICA are\ncompared against the ones of other methods, in particular polynomial centroid\ndivision (PCD), and pixel-level decorrelation (PLD) method (Deming et al.\n2014). We find that in simulated cases pixel-ICA performs as well or better\nthan other methods, and it also guarantees a higher degree of objectivity,\nbecause of its purely statistical foundation with no prior information on the\ninstrument systematics.

These effects relate to\nthe enhancement or depletion, respectively, in coronal abundance with respect\nto photospheric values of elements with FIP below about 10~eV.

It is shown that such a model\ncan also account for the observed depletion of helium in the solar wind.

For a type-I planet, which\nis formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, the thermal\nemission declines on a timescale shorter than approximately $10^6$ years.\nTherefore, young stars should be targets when searching for molten planets in\nthis orbital region. In contrast, a type-II planet, which is formed inside the\ncritical distance, will emit significant thermal radiation from near-infrared\natmospheric windows during the entire lifetime of the magma ocean. The Ks and L\nbands will be favorable for future direct imaging because the planet-to-star\ncontrasts of these bands are higher than approximately 10$^{-7}$-10$^{-8}$.

We propose\nthat the mass-flow of pebbles is two-times lower and the characteristic size of\nthe pebbles is approximately ten times smaller within the snowline than beyond\nthe snowline (respectively at heliocentric distance $r<r_{ice}$ and\n$r>r_{ice}$, where $r_{ice}$ is the snowline heliocentric distance), due to ice\nsublimation and the splitting of icy pebbles into a collection of\nchondrule-size silicate grains. In this case, objects of original sub-lunar\nmass would grow at drastically different rates in the two regions of the disk.\nWithin the snowline these bodies would reach approximately the mass of Mars\nwhile beyond the snowline they would grow to $\\sim 20$ Earth masses. The\nresults may change quantitatively with changes to the assumed parameters, but\nthe establishment of a clear dichotomy in the mass distribution of protoplanets\nappears robust, provided that there is enough turbulence in the disk to prevent\nthe sedimentation of the silicate grains into a very thin layer. \n\n"}

(1998) proposed Deuterium (DD) fusion at the core-mantle\ninterface of giant planets as a mechanism to explain their observed heat\nexcess. But rather high interior temperatures (~10^5 K) and a stratified D\nlayer are needed, making such a scenario unlikely. In this paper, we re-examine\nDD fusion, with the addition of screening effects pertinent to a deuterated\ncore containing ice and some heavy elements. This alleviates the extreme\ntemperature constraint and removes the requirement of a stratified D layer. As\nan application, we propose that, if their core temperatures are a few times\n10^4 K and core composition is chemically inhomogeneous, the observed inflated\nsize of some giant exoplanets (\"hot Jupiters\") may be linked to screened DD\nfusion occurring deep in the interior. Application of an analytic evolution\nmodel suggests that the amount of inflation from this effect can be important\nif there is sufficient rock-ice in the core, making DD fusion an effective\nextra internal energy source for radius inflation. The mechanism of screened DD\nfusion, operating in the above temperature range, is generally consistent with\nthe trend in radius anomaly with planetary equilibrium temperature $T_{\\rm\neq}$, and also depends on planetary mass. Although we do not consider the\neffect of incident stellar flux, we expect that a minimum level of irradiation\nis necessary to trigger core erosion and subsequent DD fusion inside the\nplanet. Since DD fusion is quite sensitive to the screening potential inferred\nfrom laboratory experiments, observations of inflated hot Jupiters may help\nconstrain screening effects in the cores of giant planets. \n\n"}

Of the countless number of chemical species\nterrestrial life produces, only a few have the distinct spectral features and\nthe necessary atmospheric abundance to be detectable. The easiest of these\nspecies to observe in Earth's atmosphere is O$_{2}$ (and its photochemical\nbyproduct, O$_{3}$). But O$_{2}$ can also be produced abiotically by photolysis\nof CO$_{2}$, followed by recombination of O atoms with each other. CO is\nproduced in stoichiometric proportions. Whether O$_{2}$ and CO can accumulate\nto appreciable concentrations depends on the ratio of far-UV to near-UV\nradiation coming from the planet's parent star and on what happens to these\ngases when they dissolve in a planet's oceans.

These planets frequently show evidence for large Hydrogen and Helium\nenvelopes containing several percent of the planet's mass and display a large\ndiversity in mean densities. Here we show that this wide range can be achieved\nby one or two late giant impacts, which are frequently needed to achieve\nlong-term orbital stability in multiple planet systems once the gas disk has\ndisappeared. We demonstrate using hydrodynamical simulations that a single\ncollision between similarly sized exoplanets can easily reduce the\nenvelope-to-core-mass ratio by a factor of two and show that this leads to a\ncorresponding increase in the observed mean density by factors of 2-3. In\naddition we investigate how envelope-mass-loss depends on envelope mass, planet\nradius, semi-major axis, and the mass distribution inside the envelope. We\npropose that a small number of giant impacts may be responsible for the large\nobserved spread in mean densities, especially for multiple-planet systems\ncontaining planets with very different densities and which have not been\nsignificantly sculpted by photo evaporation. \n\n"}

We show that, under these\nconditions, grains with sizes a >0.01 micron exhibit dramatic (exceeding factor\n~1000) fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratio (implying large small-scale\nvariations in abundances, dust cooling rates, and dynamics). The dust can form\nhighly filamentary structures (which would be observed in both dust emission\nand extinction), which can be much thinner than the characteristic width of gas\nfilaments. Sometimes, the dust and gas filaments are not even in the same\nlocation. The 'clumping factor' of the dust (critical for dust\ngrowth/coagulation/shattering) can reach ~100, for grains in the ideal size\nrange. The dust clustering is maximized around scales ~0.2pc*(a/micron)*(100\ncm^-3/n_gas), and is 'averaged out' on larger scales. However, because the\ndensity varies widely in supersonic turbulence, the dynamic range of scales\n(and interesting grain sizes) for these fluctuations is much broader than in\nthe subsonic case. Our results are applicable to MCs of essentially all sizes\nand densities, but we note how Lorentz forces and other physics (neglected\nhere) may change them in some regimes.

They pose a great challenge for planet formation\ntheories, which fall into two broad classes: (1) formation further out followed\nby inward migration; (2) formation in situ, in the very inner regions of the\nprotoplanetary disk. We review the pros and cons of these classes, before\nfocusing on a new theory of sequential in situ formation from the inside-out\nvia creation of successive gravitationally unstable rings fed from a continuous\nstream of small (~cm-m size) \"pebbles,\" drifting inward via gas drag. Pebbles\nfirst collect at the pressure trap associated with the transition from a\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI)-inactive (\"dead zone\") region to an inner,\nMRI-active zone.

The shallow disk gaps cannot terminate growth of\ngiant planets. For planets less massive than 10 Jupiter masses, their growth\nrates are mainly controlled by the gas supply through the global disk\naccretion, rather than their gaps. The insufficient gas supply compared with\nthe rapid gas capture causes a depletion of the gas surface density even at the\noutside of the gap, which can create an inner hole in the protoplanetary disk.\nOur model can also predict the depleted gas surface density in the inner hole\nfor a given planet mass. Secondly, our findings are applied to the formation of\nour solar system. For the formation of Jupiter, a very low-mass gas disk with a\nfew or several Jupiter masses is required at the beginning of its gas capture\nbecause of the non-stopping capture. Such a low-mass gas disk with sufficient\nsolid material can be formed through viscous evolution from an initially\n$\\sim$10AU-sized compact disk with the solar composition. By the viscous\nevolution with a moderate viscosity of $\\alpha \\sim 10^{-3}$, most of disk gas\naccretes onto the sun and a widely spread low-mass gas disk remains when the\nsolid core of Jupiter starts gas capture at $t \\sim 10^7$ yrs. The depletion of\nthe disk gas is suitable for explaining the high metallicity in giant planets\nof our solar system. A very low-mass gas disk also provides a plausible path\nwhere type I and II planetary migrations are both suppressed significantly.

Time to detection of nanohertz gravitational waves\n  based on pulsar-timing array limits Abstract: Decade-long timing observations of arrays of millisecond pulsars have placed\nhighly constraining upper limits on the amplitude of the nanohertz\ngravitational-wave stochastic signal from the mergers of supermassive\nblack-hole binaries ($\\sim 10^{-15}$ strain at $f = 1/\\mathrm{yr}$). These\nlimits suggest that binary merger rates have been overestimated, or that\nenvironmental influences from nuclear gas or stars accelerate orbital decay,\nreducing the gravitational-wave signal at the lowest, most sensitive\nfrequencies. This prompts the question whether nanohertz gravitational waves\nare likely to be detected in the near future. In this letter, we answer this\nquestion quantitatively using simple statistical estimates, deriving the range\nof true signal amplitudes that are compatible with current upper limits, and\ncomputing expected detection probabilities as a function of observation time.\nWe conclude that small arrays consisting of the pulsars with the least timing\nnoise, which yield the tightest upper limits, have discouraging prospects of\nmaking a detection in the next two decades. By contrast, we find large arrays\nare crucial to detection because the quadrupolar spatial correlations induced\nby gravitational waves can be well sampled by many pulsar pairs. Indeed, timing\nprograms which monitor a large and expanding set of pulsars have an $\\sim 80\\%$\nprobability of detecting gravitational waves within the next ten years, under\nassumptions on merger rates and environmental influences ranging from\noptimistic to conservative. Even in the extreme case where $90\\%$ of binaries\nstall before merger and environmental coupling effects diminish low-frequency\ngravitational-wave power, detection is delayed by at most a few years. \n\n"}

This raises the\nquestion why the present Earth is so depleted of water (with the ocean mass\nbeing as small as 0.023% of the Earth mass). Here we quantify the amount of icy\npebbles accreted by terrestrial embryos after the migration of the snow line\nassuming that no mechanism halts the pebble flow in outer disk regions. We use\na simplified version of the coagulation equation to calculate the formation and\nradial inward drift of icy pebbles in a protoplanetary disk. The pebble\naccretion cross section of an embryo is calculated using analytic expressions\npresented by recent studies. We find that the final mass and water content of\nterrestrial embryos strongly depends on the radial extent of the gas disk, the\nstrength of disk turbulence, and the time at which the snow lines arrives at 1\nAU. The disk's radial extent sets the lifetime of the pebble flow, while\nturbulence determines the density of pebbles at the midplane where the embryos\nreside.

K2-26b exhibits a\ntransit duration that is too long to be consistent with a circular orbit given\nthe measured stellar radius.

The main aim of\nthis study is to determine which set of model parameters leads to the formation\nof planetary systems that are similar to the compact low mass multi-planet\nsystems that have been discovered by radial velocity surveys and the Kepler\nmission.

This strategy has been shown to give better results, as\nfixing the coefficients to theoretical values can give rise to important\nsystematic errors which directly impact the physical properties of the system\nderived from such lightcurves such as the planetary radius. However, studies of\nthe effect of limb darkening assumptions on the retrieved parameters have\nmostly focused on the widely used quadratic limb-darkening law, leaving out\nother proposed laws that are either simpler or better descriptions of model\nintensity profiles.

The event, initially designated G184098 and later given\nthe name GW150914, is described in detail elsewhere. By prior arrangement,\npreliminary estimates of the time, significance, and sky location of the event\nwere shared with 63 teams of observers covering radio, optical, near-infrared,\nX-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths with ground- and space-based facilities. In\nthis Letter we describe the low-latency analysis of the GW data and present the\nsky localization of the first observed compact binary merger. We summarize the\nfollow-up observations reported by 25 teams via private Gamma-ray Coordinates\nNetwork circulars, giving an overview of the participating facilities, the GW\nsky localization coverage, the timeline and depth of the observations. As this\nevent turned out to be a binary black hole merger, there is little expectation\nof a detectable electromagnetic (EM) signature. Nevertheless, this first\nbroadband campaign to search for a counterpart of an Advanced LIGO source\nrepresents a milestone and highlights the broad capabilities of the transient\nastronomy community and the observing strategies that have been developed to\npursue neutron star binary merger events. Detailed investigations of the EM\ndata and results of the EM follow-up campaign are being disseminated in papers\nby the individual teams. \n\n"}

However, self-consistently linking a planetary\nsystem across these two phases of stellar evolution through the violent giant\nbranch poses computational challenges, and previous studies restricted\narchitectures to equal-mass planets. Here, we remove this constraint and\nperform over 450 numerical integrations over a Hubble time (14 Gyr) of packed\nplanetary systems with unequal-mass planets. We characterize the resulting\ntrends as a function of planet order and mass. We find that intrusive radial\nincursions in the vicinity of the white dwarf become less likely as the\ndispersion amongst planet masses increases. The orbital meandering which may\nsustain a sufficiently dynamic environment around a white dwarf to explain\nobservations is more dependent on the presence of terrestrial-mass planets than\nany variation in planetary mass. Triggering unpacking or instability during the\nwhite dwarf phase is comparably easy for systems of unequal-mass planets and\nsystems of equal-mass planets; instabilities during the giant branch phase\nremain rare and require fine-tuning of initial conditions.

FFPs are identified as single-lens\nevents with a short timescale, of-order 1 day. Measuring the mass of the\nlensing object requires determining the finite size of the source star $\\rho$,\nas well as the microlens parallax $\\pi_{\\rm E}$. A planet that is bound to but\nwidely separated from a host star can produce a light curve similar to that of\nan FFP. This tension can be resolved with high-resolution imaging of the\nmicrolensing target to search for the lens flux $F_l$ from a possible host\nstar. Here we investigate the accessible parameter space for each of these\ncomponents --- $\\pi_{\\rm E}$, $\\rho$, and $F_l$ --- considering different\nsatellites for a range of FFP masses, Galactic distances, and source star\nproperties. We find that at the beginning of K2C9, when its projected\nseparation from the Earth (as viewed from the center of its survey field) is\n$\\lesssim$0.2 AU, it will be able to measure $\\pi_{\\rm E}$ for Jupiter-mass FFP\ncandidates at distances larger than $\\sim$2 kpc and to Earth-mass lenses at\n$\\sim$8 kpc.

Abstract: Context: Surveys in the visible and near-infrared spectral range have\nrevealed the presence of low-albedo asteroids in cometary like orbits (ACOs).\nIn contrast to Jupiter family comets (JFCs), ACOs are inactive, but possess\nsimilar orbital parameters. Aims: In this work, we discuss why ACOs are\ninactive, whereas JFCs show gas-driven dust activity, although both belong to\nthe same class of primitive solar system bodies. Methods: We hypothesize that\nACOs and JFCs have formed under the same physical conditions, namely by the\ngravitational collapse of ensembles of ice and dust aggregates. We use the\nmemory effect of dust-aggregate layers under gravitational compression to\ndiscuss under which conditions the gas-driven dust activity of these bodies is\npossible. Results: Owing to their smaller sizes, JFCs can sustain gas-driven\ndust activity much longer than the bigger ACOs, whose sub-surface regions\npossess an increased tensile strength, due to gravitational compression of the\nmaterial. The increased tensile strength leads to the passivation against dust\nactivity after a relatively short time of activity. Conclusions: The\ngravitational-collapse model of the formation of planetesimals, together with\nthe gravitational compression of the sub-surface material simultaneously,\nexplains the inactivity of ACOs and the gas-driven dust activity of JFCs.

The\noccurrence rate and distributions of masses and orbits vary greatly with the\nhost stars mass. These close planets origins are a mystery that motivates\ninvestigating protoplanetary disks central regions. A key factor governing the\nconditions near the star is the silicate sublimation front, which largely\ndetermines where the starlight is absorbed, and which is often called the inner\nrim. We present the first radiation hydrodynamical modeling of the sublimation\nfront in the disks around the young intermediate-mass stars called Herbig Ae\nstars. The models are axisymmetric, and include starlight heating, silicate\ngrains sublimating and condensing to equilibrium at the local, time-dependent\ntemperature and density, and accretion stresses parametrizing the results of\nMHD magneto-rotational turbulence models. The results compare well with\nradiation hydrostatic solutions, and prove to be dynamically stable. Passing\nthe model disks into Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we show that\nthe models satisfy observational constraints on the inner rims location. A\nsmall optically-thin halo of hot dust naturally arises between the inner rim\nand the star. The inner rim has a substantial radial extent, corresponding to\nseveral disk scale heights. While the fronts overall position varies with the\nstellar luminosity, its radial extent depends on the mass accretion rate. A\npressure maximum develops near the location of thermal ionization at\ntemperatures about 1000 K. The pressure maximum is capable of halting solid\npebbles radial drift and concentrating them in a zone where temperatures are\nsufficiently high for annealing to form crystalline silicates. \n\n"}

We examine several\nmechanisms which could drive the dust through gas and show that to do so\nlocally would have required long (sub-orbital to many orbits) time scales; with\nshortest potassium depletion time scales occurring in a scenario where\nchondrules formed high above the midplane and settled out of the evaporated\npotassium. While orbital time scales are at odds with laboratory chondrule\ncooling rate estimates, any other model for the origin for the potassium\nabundance variation has to wrestle with the severe logistical difficulty of\ngenerating a plethora of correlated reservoirs which varied strongly in their\npotassium abundances, but not in their potassium isotope ratios. \n\n"}

Abstract: Astrometry covers a parameter space that cannot be reached by RV or transit\nmethods to detect terrestrial planets on wide orbits. In addition, high\naccuracy astrometric measurements are necessary to measure the inclination of\nthe planet's orbits. Here we investigate the principles of an artefact of the\nastrometric approach. Namely, the displacement of the photo-centre due to\ninhomogeneities in a dust disc around the parent star. Indeed, theory and\nobservations show that circumstellar discs can present strong asymmetries. We\nmodel the pseudo-astrometric signal caused by these inhomogeneities, asking\nwhether a dust clump in a disc can mimic the astrometric signal of an\nEarth-like planet. We show that these inhomogeneities cannot be neglected when\nusing astrometry to find terrestrial planets. We provide the parameter space\nfor which these inhomogeneities can affect the astrometric signals but still\nnot be detected by mid-IR observations. We find that a small cross section of\ndust corresponding to a cometary mass object is enough to mimic the astrometric\nsignal of an Earth-like planet. Astrometric observations of protoplanetary\ndiscs to search for planets can also be affected by the presence of\ninhomogeneities. Some further tests are given to confirm whether an observation\nis a real planet astrometric signal or an impostor. Eventually, we also study\nthe case where the cross section of dust is high enough to provide a detectable\nIR-excess and to have a measurable photometric displacement by actual\ninstruments such as Gaia, IRAC or GRAVITY. We suggest a new method, which\nconsists in using astrometry to quantify asymmetries (clumpiness) in inner\ndebris discs that cannot be otherwise resolved. \n\n"}

We find that in disks with sufficiently long lifetimes ($\\gtrsim$ 4\nMyr), all traps produce Jovian planets.

HD 59686 Ab: a massive\n  circumstellar planet orbiting a giant star in a ~13.6 au eccentric binary\n  system Abstract: Context: For over 12 yr, we have carried out a precise radial velocity survey\nof a sample of 373 G and K giant stars using the Hamilton \\'Echelle\nSpectrograph at Lick Observatory. There are, among others, a number of multiple\nplanetary systems in our sample as well as several planetary candidates in\nstellar binaries. Aims: We aim at detecting and characterizing\nsubstellar+stellar companions to the giant star HD 59686 A (HR 2877, HIP\n36616). Methods: We obtained high precision radial velocity (RV) measurements\nof the star HD 59686 A. By fitting a Keplerian model to the periodic changes in\nthe RVs, we can assess the nature of companions in the system. In order to\ndiscriminate between RV variations due to non-radial pulsation or stellar spots\nwe used infrared RVs taken with the CRIRES spectrograph at the Very Large\nTelescope. Additionally, to further characterize the system, we obtain\nhigh-resolution images with LMIRCam at the Large Binocular Telescope. Results:\nWe report the likely discovery of a giant planet with a mass of $m_{p}~\\sin\ni=6.92_{-0.24}^{+0.18}~M_{Jup}$ orbiting at $a_{p}=1.0860_{-0.0007}^{+0.0006}$\nau from the giant star HD 59686 A. Besides the planetary signal, we discover an\neccentric ($e_{B}=0.729_{-0.003}^{+0.004}$) binary companion with a mass of\n$m_{B}~\\sin i=0.5296_{-0.0008}^{+0.0011}~M_{Sun}$ orbiting at a semi-major axis\nof just $a_{B}=13.56_{-0.14}^{+0.18}$ au. Conclusions: The existence of the\nplanet HD 59686 Ab in a tight eccentric binary system severely challenges\nstandard giant planet formation theories and requires substantial improvements\nto such theories in tight binaries. Otherwise, alternative planet formation\nscenarios such as second generation planets or dynamical interactions in an\nearly phase of the system's lifetime should be seriously considered in order to\nbetter understand the origin of this enigmatic planet. \n\n"}

We note that even small\nfeatures on the disk's surface cast shadows, because the starlight grazes the\nsurface. We therefore focus on accurately computing the disk's thickness, which\ndepends on its temperature. We present models with temperatures set by the\nbalance between starlight heating and radiative cooling, that are also in\nvertical hydrostatic equilibrium. The planet has 20, 100, or 1000~M$_\\oplus$,\nranging from barely enough to perturb the disk significantly, to clearing a\ndeep tidal gap. The hydrostatic balance strikingly alters the model disk's\nappearance. The planet-carved gap's outer wall puffs up under starlight\nheating, throwing a shadow across the disk beyond. The shadow appears in\nscattered light as a dark ring that could be mistaken for a gap opened by\nanother more distant planet. The surface brightness contrast between outer wall\nand shadow for the 1000-M$_\\oplus$ planet is an order of magnitude greater than\na model neglecting the temperature disturbances.

To this end, we compute\nself-consistent, semi-analytic models of putative self-gravitating discs for\nfive candidate disc systems. Our aim is not to fit exactly the observations,\nbut to demonstrate that the expected dust continuum emission from marginally\nunstable self-gravitating discs can be quite weak, due to high optical depth at\nthe midplane even at millimetre wavelengths. In the best cases, the models\nproduce \"observable\" disc masses within a factor of <1.5 of those observed,\nwith midplane dust temperatures comparable to measured temperatures from\nmolecular line emission.

This excess has been interpreted as a population of\n~Jupiter-mass objects that outnumber main-sequence stars by nearly twofold;\nhowever the microlensing data alone cannot distinguish between events due to\nwide-separation (a>~10 AU) and free-floating planets.

We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide\nillustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion\nof the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1\nconsists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,\nparallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars\nin common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric\ndata set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The\nsecond component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band\nmagnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the\ntypical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas. The median uncertainties on\nthe mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to ~0.03 mag over the\nmagnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping\nof the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin\nobservational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this\nfirst Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the\ndata quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions\nfrom the data. \n\n"}

The six standard orbital\nparameters for a binary system can be split into four non-linear parameters\n(period, eccentricity, argument of pericenter, phase) and two linear parameters\n(velocity amplitude, barycenter velocity). We capitalize on this by building a\nsampling method in which we densely sample the prior pdf in the non-linear\nparameters and perform rejection sampling using a likelihood function\nmarginalized over the linear parameters.

In particular, the elemental compositions of Gas Giant gaseous envelopes\ndepend on the elemental composition of the disk gas from which the envelope is\naccreted. Previous models demonstrated that sequential freeze-out of O and\nC-bearing volatiles in disks will result in an supersolar C/O ratios and\nsubsolar C/H ratios in the gas between water and CO snowlines. This result does\nnot take into account, however, the expected grain growth and radial drift of\npebbles in disks, and the accompanying re-distribution of volatiles from the\nouter to the inner disk. Using a toy model we demonstrate that when drift is\nconsidered, CO is enhanced between the water and CO snowline, resulting in both\nsupersolar C/O and C/H ratios in the disk gas in the Gas Giant formation zone.\nThis result appears robust to the details of the disk model as long as there is\nsubstantial pebble drift across the CO snowline, and the efficiency of CO vapor\ndiffusion is limited. Gas Giants that accrete their gaseous envelopes exterior\nto the water snowline and do not experience substantial core-envelope mixing,\nmay thus present both superstellar C/O and C/H ratios in their atmospheres.\nPebble drift will also affect the nitrogen and noble gas abundances in the\nplanet forming zones, which may explain some of Jupiter's peculiar abundance\npatterns. \n\n"}

In the first, where the\ncooling time is greater than five times the dynamical time, magnetic fields\nreduce spiral density wave amplitudes, which in turn suppresses fragmentation.\nThis is the case even if the magnetic pressure is only a tenth of the thermal\npressure.

The fragments are confined to a\nnarrower range of initial semimajor axes than those in unmagnetised discs. The\norbital eccentricity and inclination distributions of unmagnetised and\nmagnetised disc fragments are similar.

MASCARA\nconsists of one northern station on La Palma, Canary Islands (fully operational\nsince February 2015), one southern station at La Silla Observatory, Chile\n(operational from early 2017), and a data centre at Leiden Observatory in the\nNetherlands. Both MASCARA stations are equipped with five interline CCD cameras\nusing wide field lenses (24 mm focal length) with fixed pointings, which\ntogether provide coverage down to airmass 3 of the local sky. The interline CCD\ncameras allow for back-to-back exposures, taken at fixed sidereal times with\nexposure times of 6.4 sidereal seconds. The exposures are short enough that the\nmotion of stars across the CCD does not exceed one pixel during an integration.\nAstrometry and photometry are performed on-site, after which the resulting\nlight curves are transferred to Leiden for further analysis.

However, they rarely have detectable debris\naccretion discs, possibly because much of the influx is fast steeply-infalling\ndebris in star-grazing orbits, producing a more tenuous signature than a slowly\naccreting disk. Processes governing such deposition between the Roche radius\nand photosphere have so far received little attention and we model them here\nanalytically by extending recent work on sun-grazing comets to WD systems. We\nfind that the evolution of cm-to-km size (a_0) infallers most strongly depends\non two combinations of parameters, which effectively measure sublimation rate\nand binding strength. We then provide an algorithm to determine the fate of\ninfallers for any WD, and apply the algorithm to four limiting combinations of\nhot versus cool (young/old) WDs with snowy (weak, volatile) versus rocky\n(strong, refractory) infallers. We find: (i) Total sublimation above the\nphotosphere befalls all small infallers across the entire WD temperature (T_WD)\nrange, the threshold size rising with T_WD and 100X larger for rock than snow.\n(ii) All very large objects fragment tidally regardless of T_WD: for rock, a_0\n>= 10^5 cm; for snow, a_0 >= 10^3 -- 3x10^4 cm across all WD cooling ages.\n(iii) A considerable range of a_0 avoids fragmentation and total sublimation,\nyielding impacts or grazes with cold WDs. This range narrows rapidly with\nincreasing T_WD, especially for snowy bodies.

The stars are surrounded by a\ndebris disk which displays a ring-like morphology and strong asymmetries at\nmultiple scales.

We performed semi-analytical calculations and\nnumerical simulations (Swift_HJS package) to model the interactions between the\nplanet and the two stars. We accounted for the migration as a simple force. We\nstudied the LCC kinematics to set constraints on the local density of stars,\nand therefore on the fly-by likelihood. We performed N-body simulations to\ndetermine the effects of the planet trajectories (ejection and secular effects)\nonto the disk morphology. The combination of the migration and mean-motion\nresonances with the binary star (often 1:6) can eject the planet.

Here we use a 3D Global Climate Model to\nsimulate the ability of frozen planets to escape from glaciation by\naccumulating enough gaseous CO$_2$. We find that Earth-like planets orbiting a\nSun-like star may never be able to escape from glaciation if their orbital\ndistance is greater than $\\sim$ 1.27 AU (Flux $<$ 847 W m$^{-2}$ or 62$\\%$ of\nthe Solar constant), because CO$_2$ would condense at the poles forming\npermanent CO$_2$ ice caps. This limits the amount of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere\nand thus its greenhouse effect. The amount of CO$_2$ that can be trapped in the\npolar caps depends on the efficiency of CO$_2$ ice to flow laterally as well as\nits graviational stability relative to subsurface water ice. The flow of CO$_2$\nice from poles to equator is mostly controlled by the bottom temperature, and\nhence by the internal heat flux. We find that a frozen Earth-like planet\nlocated at 1.30 AU of a Sun-like star could store as much as 1.5/4.5/15 bars of\ndry ice at the poles, for internal heat fluxes of 100/30/10 mW m$^{-2}$.

The\nproximity of a companion moving on an eccentric orbit increases the flux of\nasteroids to the HZ, which could result in a more efficient water transport on\na short timescale, causing a heavy bombardment.

The correlation between\nthe accretion luminosity to the stellar luminosity, and of the mass accretion\nrate to the stellar mass in the logarithmic plane yields slopes of 1.9 and 2.3,\nrespectively. These slopes and the accretion rates are consistent with previous\nresults in various star forming regions and with different theoretical\nframeworks. However, we find that a broken power-law fit, with a steeper slope\nfor stellar luminosity smaller than ~0.45 Lsun and for stellar masses smaller\nthan ~ 0.3 Msun, is slightly preferred according to different statistical\ntests, but the single power-law model is not excluded.

The stellar component does not have significant rotation, while the\nionized gas defines a clear star-forming gas disk. We argue, based on deep\noptical images of the galaxy, that the gas was most likely acquired during a\npast wet merger. It is possible that the star-forming blobs are also remnants\nof the merger. In addition, the direction and kinematics of the one-sided\nionized tails, combined with the tadpole morphology of the star-forming blobs,\nstrongly suggests that the system is undergoing ram pressure from the\nintracluster medium. In summary, this paper presents the discovery of a\npost-merger elliptical galaxy undergoing ram pressure stripping. \n\n"}

In this paper, we\ndescribe and compare the codes used to compute photometric redshifts for\nHSC-SSP, how we calibrate them, and the typical accuracy we achieve with the\nHSC five-band photometry (grizy). We introduce a new point estimator based on\nan improved loss function and demonstrate that it works better than other\ncommonly used estimators. We find that our photo-z's are most accurate at\n0.2<~zphot<~1.5, where we can straddle the 4000A break. We achieve\nsigma(d_zphot/(1+zphot))~0.05 and an outlier rate of about 15% for galaxies\ndown to i=25 within this redshift range. If we limit to a brighter sample of\ni<24, we achieve sigma~0.04 and ~8% outliers. Our photo-z's should thus enable\nmany science cases for HSC-SSP.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that this\nemission appears stationary on a timescale of 4.6 yrs, inconsistent at the\n2sigma level with a Keplerian clockwise orbit at 59 au in the disk plane. The H\nband spectrum of the emission is inconsistent with any type of low effective\ntemperature object or accreting protoplanetary disk. It strongly suggests a\nscattered light origin, as it is consistent with the spectrum of the star and\nthe spectra extracted at other locations in the disk. A non detection at the\n5sigma level of HD 100546b in differential Halpha imaging places an upper\nlimit, assuming the protoplanet lies in a gap free of extinction, on the\naccretion luminosity and accretion rate of 1.7E-4 Lsun and\nMMdot<6.4E-7Mjup^2/yr for 1Rjup.

We present 300 N-body simulations of terrestrial planet formation\naround a solar-type star, with and without giant planets present, using a model\nthat accounts for collisional fragmentation. In simulations with Jupiter and\nSaturn analogs, about one-third of the initial (~5 Mearth) disk mass is\nejected, about half in planets more massive than Mercury but less than 0.3\nMearth, and the remainder in smaller bodies. Most ejections occur within 25\nMyr, which is shorter than the timescale typically required for Earth-mass\nplanets to grow (30-100 Myr). When giant planets are omitted from our\nsimulations, almost no material is ejected within 200 Myr and only about 1% of\nthe initial disk is ejected by 2 Gyr.

We find that\nthe percentage of \"Halpha excess\" sources reaches 37-40% for galaxies with\nstellar masses log10(M*/Msun) ~ 9-10, and decreases to <20% at log10(M*/Msun) ~\n10.7.

We show, for the first time, that the \"Halpha excess\"\ngalaxies clearly have a bimodal distribution on the SFR-M* plane: they lie on\nthe main sequence of star formation (with log10(sSFR/yr^{-1})<-8.05) or in a\nstarburst cloud (with log10(sSFR/yr^{-1}) >-7.60).

The dependence of the\ntidal interactions on the structural and rotational evolution of the star is of\npeculiar importance and should be correctly treated. We quantify how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of rotating low-mass stars evolves from\nthe pre-main sequence up to the red-giant branch depending on the initial\nstellar mass. We investigate the consequences of this evolution on planetary\norbital evolution. We couple the tidal dissipation formalism described in\nMathis (2015) to the stellar evolution code STAREVOL and apply it to rotating\nstars with masses between 0.3 and 1.4 M$_\\odot$. In addition, we generalize the\nwork of Bolmont & Mathis (2016) by following the orbital evolution of close-in\nplanets using the new tidal dissipation predictions for advanced phases of\nstellar evolution. On the PMS the evolution of tidal dissipation is controlled\nby the evolution of the internal structure of the contracting star. On the MS\nit is strongly driven by the variation of surface rotation that is impacted by\nmagnetized stellar winds braking. The main effect of taking into account the\nrotational evolution of the stars is to lower the tidal dissipation strength by\nabout four orders of magnitude on the main-sequence, compared to a normalized\ndissipation rate that only takes into account structural changes. The evolution\nof the dissipation strongly depends on the evolution of the internal structure\nand rotation of the star. From the pre-main sequence up to the tip of the\nred-giant branch, it varies by several orders of magnitude, with strong\nconsequences for the orbital evolution of close-in massive planets. These\neffects are the strongest during the pre-main sequence, implying that the\nplanets are mainly sensitive to the star's early history. \n\n"}

The radius distribution of the Kepler planets is\nshown to be bimodal, with a ``valley' separating two peaks at 1.3 and 2.6\nRearth. Such an ``evaporation-valley' had been predicted by numerical models\npreviously. Here, we develop a minimal model to demonstrate that this valley\nresults from the following fact: the timescale for envelope erosion is the\nlongest for those planets with hydrogen/helium-rich envelopes that, while only\na few percent in weight, double its radius. The timescale falls for envelopes\nlighter than this because the planet's radius remains largely constant for\ntenuous envelopes. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the\nplanet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation,\ntherefore, herds planets into either bare cores ~1.3 Rearth, or those with\ndouble the core's radius (~2.6 Rearth). This process mostly occurs during the\nfirst 100 Myrs when the stars' high energy flux are high and nearly constant.\nThe observed radius distribution further requires that the Kepler planets are\nclustered around 3 Mearth in mass, are born with H/He envelopes more than a few\npercent in mass, and that their cores are similar to the Earth in composition.\nSuch envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks,\nwhile the core composition indicates formation inside the ice-line. Lastly, the\nphotoevaporation model fails to account for bare planets beyond ~30-60 days, if\nthese planets are abundant, they may point to a significant second channel for\nplanet formation, resembling the Solar-System terrestrial planets. \n\n"}

Applying\nour results to the HL Tau disk, we show that a single 30 Earth-mass planet\nembedded in the ring at 68.8~au (B5) can reasonably well reproduce the\npositions of the two major gaps at 13.2 and 32.3 au (D1 and D2), and roughly\nreproduce two other major gaps at 64.2 and 74.7 au (D5 and D6) seen in the mm\ncontinuum. The positions of secondary/tertiary gaps are found to be sensitive\nto the planetary mass and the disk temperature profile, so with accurate\nobservational measurements of the temperature structure the positions of\nmultiple gaps can be used to constrain the mass of the planet. We also comment\non the gaps seen in the TW Hya and HD~163296 disk. \n\n"}

Simultaneously, these embryos mutually interact\nand also migrate due to torques arising from the protoplanetary disk.\n  Aims: Our aim is to investigate how pebble accretion alters the orbital\nevolution of embryos undergoing the Type-I migration. In particular, we study\nwhether they establish resonant chains, whether these chains are prone to\ninstabilities and if giant planet cores form through embryo merging, thus\noccurring more rapidly than by pebble accretion alone.\n  Methods: For the first time, we perform self-consistent global-scale\nradiative hydrodynamic simulations of a two-fluid protoplanetary disk\nconsisting of gas and pebbles, the latter being accreted by embedded embryos.\nAccretion heating, along with other radiative processes, is accounted for to\ncorrectly model the Type-I migration.\n  Results: We track the evolution of four super-Earth-like embryos, initially\nlocated in a region where the disk structure allows for a convergent migration.\nGenerally, embryo merging is facilitated by rapidly increasing embryo masses\nand breaks the otherwise oligarchic growth. Moreover, we find that the orbital\neccentricity of each embryo is considerably excited ($\\simeq0.03$) due to the\npresence of an asymmetric underdense lobe of gas, a so-called `hot trail',\nproduced by accretion heating of the embryo's vicinity. Eccentric orbits lead\nthe embryos to frequent close encounters and make resonant locking more\ndifficult.\n  Conclusions: Embryo merging typically produces one massive core ($\\gtrsim\n10\\,\\mathrm{M_{E}}$) in our simulations, orbiting near $10\\,\\mathrm{AU}$.\nPebble accretion is naturally accompanied by occurrence of eccentric orbits\nwhich should be considered in future efforts to explain the structure of\nexoplanetary systems. \n\n"}

In this study, we explore how\ndisc structure relates to the properties of the wind-launching region, mapping\nout the regions of protostellar discs where wind launching could be viable. We\ncombine a series of 1.5D semi-analytic, steady-state, vertical disc-wind\nsolutions into a radially extended 1+1.5D model, incorporating all three\ndiffusion mechanisms (Ohm, Hall and ambipolar). We observe that the majority of\nmass outflow via disc winds occurs over a radial width of a fraction of an\nastronomical unit, with outflow rates attenuating rapidly on either side.

Such measurements provide statistical constraints that can be used to\ninform our understanding of the initial conditions of planet formation.

We fit the observations\ndirectly in the uv-plane using a two-layer disk model that computes the 890\nmicron emission by solving the energy balance at each disk radius. For 22 out\nof 36 protoplanetary disks we derive robust estimates of their physical\nproperties. The sample covers stellar masses between ~0.1 and ~2 Solar masses,\nand we find no trend between the average disk temperatures and the stellar\nparameters.

Under such a circumstance, it may\nbe invaluable to attempt to specify when and how planet formation begins in\nstar-forming regions and to identify what physical processes/quantities are the\nmost significant to make a link between star and planet formation. To this end,\nwe have recently developed a couple of projects. These include an observational\nproject about dust growth in Class 0 YSOs and a theoretical modeling project of\nthe HL Tauri disk. For the first project, we utilize the archive data of radio\ninterferometric observations, and examine whether dust growth, a first step of\nplanet formation, occurs in Class 0 YSOs. We find that while our observational\nresults can be reproduced by the presence of large ($\\sim$ mm) dust grains for\nsome of YSOs under the single-component modified blackbody formalism, an\ninterpretation of no dust growth would be possible when a more detailed model\nis used. For the second project, we consider an origin of the disk\nconfiguration around HL Tauri, focusing on magnetic fields. We find that\nmagnetically induced disk winds may play an important role in the HL Tauri\ndisk.

Many empirical studies of hot Jupiters have\nimplicitly assumed that the dayside is the hottest hemisphere and the nightside\nis the coldest hemisphere. For a given eclipse depth and phase amplitude, an\norbital lag between a planet's peak brightness and its eclipse---a phase\noffset---implies that planet's nightside emits greater flux. To quantify how\nphase offsets impact the energy budgets of short-period planets, we compile all\ninfrared observations of the nine planets with multi-band eclipse depths and\nphase curves. Accounting for phase offsets shifts planets to lower Bond albedo\nand greater day--night heat transport, usually by $\\lesssim 1\\sigma$.

We then use a 3-D\nGlobal Climate Model to explore the possible climates of cool planets of the\nTRAPPIST-1 system. In particular, we look at the conditions required for cool\nplanets to prevent possible volatile species to be lost by permanent\ncondensation, irreversible burying or photochemical destruction. We also\nexplore the resilience of the same volatiles (when in condensed phase) to a\nrunaway greenhouse process. We find that background atmospheres made of N2, CO\nor O2 are resistant to atmospheric collapse. However, it should be difficult\nfor TRAPPIST-1 planets to accumulate significant greenhouse gases like CO2,\nCH4, or NH3. CO2 can easily condense on the nightside, forming glaciers that\nwould flow toward the substellar region. A complete CO2 ice cover is possible\non TRAPPIST-1g and h only, although CO2 ice deposits could be gravitationally\nunstable and get buried beneath the water ice shell in geologically short\ntimescales.

The pebble accretion theory is built upon the orbit\ntheory of dust particles in a laminar protoplanetary disk (PPD). For\nsufficiently large core mass (in the \"Hill regime\"), essentially all particles\nof appropriate sizes entering the Hill sphere can be captured. However, the\nouter regions of PPDs are expected to be weakly turbulent due to the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI), where turbulent stirring of particle\norbits may affect the efficiency of pebble accretion. We conduct shearing-box\nsimulations of pebble accretion with different levels of MRI turbulence\n(strongly turbulent assuming ideal magnetohydrodynamics, weakly turbulent in\nthe presence of ambipolar diffusion, and laminar) and different core masses to\ntest the efficiency of pebble accretion at a microphysical level. We find that\naccretion remains efficient for marginally coupled particles (dimensionless\nstopping time tau_s ~ 0.1 - 1) even in the presence of strong MRI turbulence.\nThough more dust particles are brought toward the core by the turbulence, this\neffect is largely canceled by a reduction in accretion probability. As a\nresult, the overall effect of turbulence on the accretion rate is mainly\nreflected in the changes in the thickness of the dust layer. On the other hand,\nwe find that the efficiency of pebble accretion for strongly coupled particles\n(down to tau_s ~ 0.01) can be modestly reduced by strong turbulence for\nlow-mass cores. \n\n"}

Abstract: The nearest stellar system consists of the stars Proxima, alpha Centauri A\nand B and at least one planet Proxima b. The habitability of Proxima b and any\nother planets are likely to be significantly influenced by the orbital\nevolution of the system. To study the dynamical evolution of the system, we\nsimulate the motions of Proxima and alpha Centauri A and B due to the\nperturbations from the Galactic tide and stellar encounters in a Monte Carlo\nfashion. From 100 clones, we find that 74% orbits of Proxima Centauri are bound\nto alpha Centauri A and B while 17% and 9% orbits become unbound in the\nsimulations over the past and future 5 Gyr. If the system migrated outward in\nthe Milky Way to its current location, more than 50% of clones could become\nunstable in backward simulations. The ratio of unstable clones increases with\nthe simulation time scale and encounter rate. This provides some evidence for a\ncapture scenario for the formation of the current triple system. Despite large\nuncertainties, the metallicity difference between Proxima and alpha Centauri A\nand B is also suggestive of their different origin.

We show that the\nfraction of systems reaching high eccentricities is enhanced relative to triple\nsystems, over a broader range of parameter space.

We connect\nprescriptions for gas disk evolution, dust growth and fragmentation, water ice\nevaporation and recondensation, as well as transport of both solids and water\nvapor, and planetesimal formation via streaming instability into a single,\none-dimensional model for protoplanetary disk evolution. We find that processes\ntaking place around the snow line facilitate planetesimal formation in two\nways.

{"id": "1711.03490", "contents": "Title: Debris Disc Constraints on Planetesimal Formation Abstract: Two basic routes for planetesimal formation have been proposed over the last\nfew decades. One is a classical \"slow-growth\" scenario. Another one is particle\nconcentration models, in which small pebbles are concentrated locally and then\ncollapse gravitationally to form planetesimals. Both types of models make\ncertain predictions for the size spectrum and internal structure of newly-born\nplanetesimals. We use these predictions as input to simulate collisional\nevolution of debris discs left after the gas dispersal. The debris disc\nemission as a function of a system's age computed in these simulations is\ncompared with several Spitzer and Herschel debris disc surveys around A-type\nstars. We confirm that the observed brightness evolution for the majority of\ndiscs can be reproduced by classical models. Further, we find that it is\nequally consistent with the size distribution of planetesimals predicted by\nparticle concentration models - provided the objects are loosely bound \"pebble\npiles\" as these models also predict. Regardless of the assumed planetesimal\nformation mechanism, explaining the brightest debris discs in the samples\nuncovers a \"disc mass problem.\" To reproduce such discs by collisional\nsimulations, a total mass of planetesimals of up to ~1000 Earth masses is\nrequired, which exceeds the total mass of solids available in the\nprotoplanetary progenitors of debris discs. This may indicate that stirring was\ndelayed in some of the bright discs, that giant impacts occurred recently in\nsome of them, that some systems may be younger than previously thought, or that\nnon-collisional processes contribute significantly to the dust production. \n\n"}

In this paper, we show that VSI modes (a) exhibit\narbitrary spatial profiles and (b) remain nonlinear solutions to the\nincompressible local equations, no matter their amplitude. The modes are\nthemselves subject to parasitic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, though the disk\nrotation significantly impedes the parasites and permits the VSI to attain\nlarge amplitudes (fluid velocities < 10% the sound speed).

We proceed to evaluate the performance of the\nLSST baseline survey strategy for PHAs and NEOs using a high-fidelity simulated\nsurvey pointing history.

Despite this common\nsource, the latitudinal distribution of the two species is radically different,\nwith acetylene decreasing in abundance towards the pole, and ethane increasing\ntowards the pole. We present six years of NASA IRTF TEXES mid-infrared\nobservations of the zonally-averaged emission of methane, acetylene and ethane.\nWe confirm that the latitudinal distributions of ethane and acetylene are\ndecoupled, and that this is a persistent feature over multiple years. The\nacetylene distribution falls off towards the pole, peaking at\n$\\sim$30$^{\\circ}$N with a volume mixing ratio (VMR) of $\\sim$0.8 parts per\nmillion (ppm) at 1 mbar and still falling off at $\\pm70^\\circ$ with a VMR of\n$\\sim$0.3 ppm. The acetylene distributions are asymmetric on average, but as we\nmove from 2013 to 2017, the zonally-averaged abundance becomes more symmetric\nabout the equator. We suggest that both the short term changes in acetylene and\nits latitudinal asymmetry is driven by changes to the vertical stratospheric\nmixing, potentially related to propagating wave phenomena.

The disk is threaded by a weak, large-scale poloidal magnetic field, and\nthe central star has no strong stellar magnetosphere initially. Our simulation\ninvestigates the structure of the accretion flows from a turbulent accretion\ndisk onto the star. The simulation reveals that fast accretion onto the star at\nhigh latitudes occurs even without a stellar magnetosphere. We find that the\nfailed disk wind becomes the fast, high-latitude accretion as a result of\nangular momentum exchange mediated by magnetic fields well above the disk,\nwhere the Lorentz force that decelerates the rotational motion of gas can be\ncomparable to the centrifugal force. Unlike the classical magnetospheric\naccretion scenario, fast accretion streams are not guided by magnetic fields of\nthe stellar magnetosphere. Nevertheless, the accretion velocity reaches the\nfree-fall velocity at the stellar surface due to the efficient angular momentum\nloss at a distant place from the star. This study provides a possible\nexplanation why Herbig Ae/Be stars whose magnetic fields are generally not\nstrong enough to form magnetospheres also show indications of fast accretion. A\nmagnetically driven jet is not formed from the disk in our model. The\ndifferential rotation cannot generate sufficiently strong magnetic fields for\nthe jet acceleration because the Parker instability interrupts the field\namplification. \n\n"}

Submillimeter\n  $\\mathrm{H_2}$$^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{H_2}$$^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ Lines Abstract: In this paper, we extend the results presented in our former papers (Notsu et\nal. 2016, 2017) on using ortho-$\\mathrm{H_2}$$^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ line profiles to\nconstrain the location of the $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ snowline in T Tauri and Herbig Ae\ndisks, to include sub-millimeter para-$\\mathrm{H_2}$$^{16}\\mathrm{O}$ and\northo- and para-$\\mathrm{H_2}$$^{18}\\mathrm{O}$ lines. Since the number\ndensities of the ortho- and para-H$_{2}$$^{18}$O molecules are about 560 times\nsmaller than their $^{16}$O analogues, they trace deeper into the disk than the\northo-H$_{2}$$^{16}$O lines (down to $z=0$, i.e., the midplane). Thus these\nH$_{2}$$^{18}$O lines are potentially better probes of the position of the\nH$_{2}$O snowline at the disk midplane, depending on the dust optical depth.\nThe values of the Einstein $A$ coefficients of sub-millimeter candidate water\nlines tend to be lower (typically $<$$10^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$) than infrared\ncandidate water lines (Notsu et al. 2017). Thus in the sub-millimeter candidate\nwater line cases, the local intensity from the outer optically thin region in\nthe disk is around $10^{4}$ times smaller than that in the infrared candidate\nwater line cases. Therefore, in the sub-millimeter lines, especially\nH$_{2}$$^{18}$O and para-H$_{2}$$^{16}$O lines with relatively lower upper\nstate energies ($\\sim$ a few 100K) can also locate the position of the\n$\\mathrm{H_2O}$ snowline.

This is important for planetary habitability\nbecause snowball events may trigger rises in the complexity of life, but could\nalso endanger complex life that already exists. Recent work has shown that\nplanets tidally locked in synchronous rotation states will transition smoothly\ninto the snowball state rather than experiencing bifurcations. Here we\ninvestigate the structure of snowball bifurcations on planets that are tidally\ninfluenced, but not synchronously rotating, so that they experience long solar\ndays. We use PlaSIM, an intermediate-complexity global climate model, with a\nthermodynamic mixed layer ocean and the Sun's spectrum.

The observed variability of asymmetric,\ndouble-peaked emission line profiles in about half of such systems could be\ninterpreted as the signature of precession of an eccentric gaseous debris disk.\nThe variability timescales --- from decades down to $1.4$ yr (recently inferred\nfor the debris disk around HE 1349--2305) --- are in rough agreement with the\nrate of general relativistic (GR) precession in the test particle limit.\nHowever, it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can drive such a\nfast, coherent precession of a radially extended (out to $1 R_\\odot$) gaseous\ndisk mediated by internal stresses (pressure). Here we use the linear theory of\neccentricity evolution in hydrodynamic disks to determine several key\nproperties of eccentric modes in gaseous debris disks around WDs. We find a\ncritical dependence of both the precession period and radial eccentricity\ndistribution of the modes on the inner disk radius, $r_\\mathrm{in}$. For small\ninner radii, $r_\\mathrm{in} \\lesssim (0.2 - 0.4) R_\\odot$, the modes are\nGR-driven, with periods of $\\approx 1 - 10$ yr.

High-energy,\nhigh-angular momentum giant impacts can create a post-impact structure that\nexceeds the corotation limit (CoRoL), which defines the hottest thermal state\nand angular momentum possible for a corotating body. In a typical super-CoRoL\nbody, traditional definitions of mantle, atmosphere and disk are not\nappropriate, and the body forms a new type of planetary structure, named a\nsynestia. Using simulations of cooling synestias combined with dynamic,\nthermodynamic and geochemical calculations, we show that satellite formation\nfrom a synestia can produce the main features of our Moon. We find that cooling\ndrives mixing of the structure, and condensation generates moonlets that orbit\nwithin the synestia, surrounded by tens of bars of bulk silicate Earth (BSE)\nvapor. The moonlets and growing moon are heated by the vapor until the first\nmajor element (Si) begins to vaporize and buffer the temperature. Moonlets\nequilibrate with BSE vapor at the temperature of silicate vaporization and the\npressure of the structure, establishing the lunar isotopic composition and\npattern of moderately volatile elements. Eventually, the cooling synestia\nrecedes within the lunar orbit, terminating the main stage of lunar accretion.\nOur model shifts the paradigm for lunar origin from specifying a certain impact\nscenario to achieving a Moon-forming synestia. Giant impacts that produce\npotential Moon-forming synestias were common at the end of terrestrial planet\nformation. \n\n"}

The corresponding region in the mass-period distribution was\nassigned as the \"short-period Neptunian desert\". The common explanation of this\nfact is that the gaseous planet with few Neptune masses would not survive in\nthe vicinity of host star due to intensive atmosphere outflow induced by\nheating from stellar radiation.

Abstract: When a planet becomes massive enough, it gradually carves a partial gap\naround its orbit in the protoplanetary disk. A pressure maximum can be formed\noutside the gap where solids that are loosely coupled to the gas, typically in\nthe pebble size range, can be trapped. The minimum planet mass for building\nsuch a trap, which is called the pebble isolation mass (PIM), is important for\ntwo reasons: it marks the end of planetary growth by pebble accretion, and the\ntrapped dust forms a ring that may be observed with millimetre observations. We\nstudy the effect of disk turbulence on the pebble isolation mass and find its\ndependence on the gas turbulent viscosity, aspect ratio, and particles Stokes\nnumber. By means of 2D gas hydrodynamical simulations, we found the minimum\nplanet mass to form a radial pressure maximum beyond the orbit of the planet,\nwhich is the necessary condition to trap pebbles. We then carried out 2D gas\nplus dust hydrodynamical simulations to examine how dust turbulent diffusion\nimpacts particles trapping at the pressure maximum. We finally provide a\nsemi-analytical calculation of the PIM based on comparing the radial drift\nvelocity of solids and the root mean square turbulent velocity fluctuations\naround the pressure maximum. From our results of gas simulations, we provide an\nexpression for the PIM versus disk aspect ratio and turbulent viscosity.

The RV data is modelled\ntogether with the Kepler photometry using a photodynamical model. The inclusion\nof velocity information breaks the $MR^{-3}$ degeneracy inherent in timing data\nalone, allowing us to measure the absolute stellar and planetary radii and\nmasses. With uncertainties of 12% and 13% for the stellar and inner planet\nradii, and 35%, 24%, and 35% for the masses of the star, planet b, and planet c\nrespectively, these measurements are the most precise to date for a single host\nstar system using this technique. The transiting planet mass is determined at\nbetter precision than the star mass. This shows that modelling the radial\nvelocities and the light curve together in systems of dynamically interacting\nplanets provides a way of characterising both the star and the planets without\nbeing limited by knowledge of the star. On the other hand, the period ratio and\neccentricities place the Kepler-419 system in a sweet spot; had around twice as\nmany transits been observed, the mass of the transiting planet could have been\nmeasured using its own TTVs. Finally, the origin of the Kepler-419 system is\ndiscussed. We show that the system is near a coplanar high-eccentricity secular\nfixed point, related to the alignment of the orbits, which has prevented the\ninner orbit from circularising. For most other relative apsidal orientations,\nplanet b's orbit would be circular with a semi-major axis of 0.03 au. This\nsuggests a mechanism for forming hot Jupiters in multiplanetary systems without\nthe need of high mutual inclinations. \n\n"}

If merging is a non-negligible factor in the\ngrowth of our Galaxy, evidence of such events should be encoded in its stellar\nhalo. Reliable identification of genuine halo stars is a challenging task\nhowever. The 1st Gaia data release contains the positions, parallaxes and\nproper motions for over 2 million stars, mostly in the Solar neighbourhood.\nGaia DR2 will enlarge this sample to over 1.5 billion stars, the brightest ~5\nmillion of which will have a full phase-space information. Our aim is to\ndevelop a machine learning model to reliably identify halo stars, even when\ntheir full phase-space information is not available. We use the Gradient\nBoosted Trees algorithm to build a supervised halo star classifier. The\nclassifier is trained on a sample extracted from the Gaia Universe Model\nSnapshot, convolved with the errors of TGAS, as well as with the expected\nuncertainties of the upcoming Gaia DR2. We also trained our classifier on the\ncross-match between the TGAS and RAVE catalogues, where the halo stars are\nlabelled in an entirely model independent way. We then use this model to\nidentify halo stars in TGAS. When full phase- space information is available\nand for Gaia DR2-like uncertainties, our classifier is able to recover 90% of\nthe halo stars with at most 30% distance errors, in a completely unseen test\nset, and with negligible levels of contamination. When line-of-sight velocity\nis not available, we recover ~60% of such halo stars, with less than 10%\ncontamination. When applied to the TGAS data, our classifier detects 337 high\nconfidence RGB halo stars. Although small, this number is consistent with the\nexpectation from models given the data uncertainties. The large parallax errors\nare the biggest limitation to identify a larger number of halo stars in all the\ncases studied. \n\n"}

The companion disc's arms are asymmetric, with pitch angles that\nincrease with radius. However, these arms are not well-fitted by standard\nanalytic expressions, due to the high disc mass and relatively low companion\nmass.

I - The Inner Edges of\n  Planetary Systems Abstract: The Kepler survey provides a statistical census of planetary systems out to\nthe habitable zone.

Here, we introduce EPOS, the Exoplanet Population Observation\nSimulator, to estimate the prevalence and orbital architectures of multi-planet\nsystems based on the latest Kepler data release, DR25. We estimate that at\nleast 42% of sun-like stars have nearly coplanar planetary systems with 7 or\nmore exoplanets. The fraction of stars with at least one planet within 1 au\ncould be as high as 100% depending on assumptions about the distribution of\nsingle transiting planets. We estimate an occurrence rate of planets in the\nhabitable zone around sun-like stars of eta_earth=36+-14%. The innermost\nplanets in multi-planet systems are clustered around an orbital period of 10\ndays (0.1 au), reminiscent of the protoplanetary disk inner edge or could be\nexplained by a planet trap at that location. Only a small fraction of planetary\nsystems have the innermost planet at long orbital periods, with fewer than ~8%\nand ~3% having no planet interior to the orbit of Mercury and Venus,\nrespectively. These results reinforce the view that the solar system is not a\ntypical planetary system, but an outlier among the distribution of known\nexoplanetary systems. We predict that at least half of the habitable zone\nexoplanets are accompanied by (non-transiting) planets at shorter orbital\nperiods, hence knowledge of a close-in exoplanet could be used as a way to\noptimize the search for Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone with future\ndirect imaging missions. \n\n"}

Abstract: The NASA Kepler and K2 Missions have recently revealed a population of\ntransiting giant planets orbiting moderately evolved, low-luminosity red giant\nbranch stars.

A possible explanation is\nthe so-called Applegate mechanism, where a strong, variable magnetic field can\nperiodically change the gravitational quadrupole moment of a stellar component,\nthus causing observable period changes. One of the systems exhibiting such\nstrong orbital variations is the RS CVn binary HR 1099, whose activity cycle\nhas been studied by various authors via photospheric and chromospheric activity\nindicators, resulting in contradicting periods. We aim at independently\ndetermining the magnetic activity cycle of HR 1099 using archival X-ray data to\nallow for a comparison to orbital period variations. Archival X-ray data from\n80 different observations of HR 1099 acquired with 12 different X-ray\nfacilities and covering almost four decades were used to determine X-ray fluxes\nin the energy range of 2-10 keV via spectral fitting and flux conversion. Via\nthe Lomb-Scargle periodogram we analyze the resulting long-term X-ray light\ncurve to search for periodicities. We do not detect any statistically\nsignificant periodicities within the X-ray data. An analysis of optical data of\nHR 1099 shows that the derivation of such periods is strongly dependent on the\ntime coverage of available data, since the observed optical variations strongly\ndeviate from a pure sine wave. We argue that this offers an explanation as to\nwhy other authors derive such a wide range of activity cycle periods based on\noptical data. We conclude that our analysis constitutes the longest stellar\nX-ray activity light curve acquired to date, yet the still rather sparse\nsampling of the X-ray data, along with stochastic flaring activity, does not\nallow for the independent determination of an X-ray activity cycle. \n\n"}

A\nsurprisingly high fraction of disks that have been well-studied in scattered\nlight have spiral arms of some kind (8/29), as do a high fraction (6/11) of\nwell-studied Herbig intermediate mass stars (i.e., Herbig stars $>\n1.5M_\\odot$).

If two-arm spirals are produced by such giant planets,\nthis discrepancy suggests that giant planets are much fainter than predicted by\nhot start models.

The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets.

In this\npaper, we present new ground-based observations searching for these bodies\nco-orbiting with nine close-in (P<5 days) planets, using different observing\ntechniques. The combination of all of them allows us to restrict the parameter\nspace of any possible trojan in the system. We use multi-technique observations\n(radial velocity, precision photometry and transit timing variations), both\nnewly acquired in the context of the TROY project and publicly available, to\nconstrain the presence of planet-size trojans in the Lagrangian points of nine\nknown exoplanets. We find no clear evidence of trojans in these nine systems\nthrough any of the techniques used down to the precision of the observations.\nHowever, this allows us to constrain the presence of any potential trojan in\nthe system, specially in the trojan mass/radius versus libration amplitude\nplane. In particular, we can set upper mass limits in the super-Earth mass\nregime for six of the studied systems. \n\n"}

In the case that a debris disk,\ninferred from an infrared excess in the SED, is best modelled as two distinct\ntemperatures, we infer the presence of two spatially separated rings of debris.\nGiant planets may well exist between these two belts of debris, and indeed\ncould be responsible for the formation of the gap between these belts. We\nobserve 24 such two-belt systems using the VLT/SPHERE high contrast imager, and\ninterpret our results under the assumption that the gap is indeed formed by one\nor more giant planets.

However, there\nare some properties of the solar system that are peculiar in this context.\nFirst, the cumulative mass of all objects beyond Neptune (TNOs) is only a\nfraction of what one would expect. Second, unlike the planets themselves, the\nTNOs do not orbit on coplanar, circular orbits around the Sun, but move mostly\non inclined, eccentric orbits and are distributed in a complex way. This\nimplies that some process restructured the outer solar system after its\nformation. However, some of TNOs, referred to as Sednoids, move outside the\nzone of influence of the planets. Thus external forces must have played an\nimportant part in the restructuring of the outer solar system. The study\npresented here shows that a close fly-by of a neighbouring star can\nsimultaneously lead to the observed lower mass density outside 30 AU and excite\nthe TNOs onto eccentric, inclined orbits, including the family of Sednoids. In\nthe past it was estimated that such close fly-bys are rare during the relevant\ndevelopment stage. However, our numerical simulations show that such a scenario\nis much more likely than previously anticipated. A fly-by also naturally\nexplains the puzzling fact that Neptune has a higher mass than Uranus.

One\npossible explanation for these observations is a disc warp, which could be\ninduced by a planet on a misaligned orbit. We present three-dimensional\nnumerical simulations of the tidal interaction between a protoplanetary disc\nand a misaligned planet. For low planet masses we show that our simulations\naccurately model the evolution of inclined planet orbit (up to moderate\ninclinations). For a planet massive enough to carve a gap, the disc is\nseparated into two components and the gas interior and exterior to the planet\norbit evolve separately, forming an inner and outer disc. Due to the\ninclination of the planet, a warp develops across the planet orbit such that\nthere is a relative tilt and twist between these discs. We show that when other\nparameters are held constant, the relative inclination that develops between\nthe inner and outer disc depends on the outer radius of the total disc\nmodelled. For a given disc mass, our results suggest that the observational\nrelevance of the warp depends more strongly on the mass of the planet rather\nthan the inclination of the orbit. \n\n"}

To trigger this process, it has been\nargued that sedimentation of solids onto the mid-plane needs to be efficient\nand therefore that a quiescent gaseous environment is required. It is often\nsuggested that dead-zone or disk-wind structure created by non-ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) effects meets this requirement. However,\nsimulations have shown that the midplane of a dead zone is not completely\nquiescent. In order to examine the concentration of solids in such an\nenvironment, we use the local-shearing-box approximation to simulate a\nparticle-gas system with an Ohmic dead zone including mutual drag force between\nthe gas and the solids. We systematically compare the evolution of the system\nwith ideal or non-ideal MHD, with or without back-reaction drag force from\nparticles on gas, and with varying solid abundances. Similar to previous\ninvestigations of dead zone dynamics, we find that particles of dimensionless\nstopping time $\\tau_s=0.1$ do not sediment appreciably more than those in ideal\nmagneto-rotational turbulence, resulting in a vertical scale height an order of\nmagnitude larger than in a laminar disk. Contrary to the expectation that this\nshould curb the formation of planetesimals, we nevertheless find that strong\nclumping of solids still occurs in the dead zone when solid abundances are\nsimilar to the critical value for a laminar environment. This can be explained\nby the weak radial diffusion of particles near the mid-plane. The results imply\nthat the sedimentation of particles to the mid-plane is not a necessary\ncriterion for the formation of planetesimals by the streaming instability. \n\n"}

Using these\nmodels, we fit the observed morphology, line-of-sight velocity, proper motion\nand intensity for the extended, gaseous bullet as a function of time over a\nperiod of 2 years, in order to constrain its 3D movement and the evolution of\nits physical properties over this period. Our results suggest that although\nbullet #1's motion is predominantly ballistic, there are small but significant\nchanges in the position angle and inclination angle of the long (symmetry) axis\nof the bullet that tilt it progressively towards the symmetry axis of the\nbipolar molecular nebula around V Hya. In contrast, bullet #3 shows strong\nacceleration soon after ejection. We discuss the possibilities that bullet\nacceleration is caused by either a non-radial magnetic field and/or by\nhydrodynamic interaction with the ambient gas through which the bullet is\ntraveling. \n\n"}

The refined\n  orbital decay rate for WASP-12 b and initial constraints for HAT-P-23 b,\n  KELT-1 b, KELT-16 b, WASP-33 b, and WASP-103 b Abstract: Theoretical calculations and some indirect observations show that massive\nexoplanets on tight orbits must decay due to tidal dissipation within their\nhost stars. This orbital evolution could be observationally accessible through\nprecise transit timing over a course of decades. The rate of planetary\nin-spiralling may not only help us to understand some aspects of evolution of\nplanetary systems, but also can be used as a probe of the stellar internal\nstructure. In this paper we present results of transit timing campaigns\norganised for a carefully selected sample of hot Jupiter-like planets which\nwere found to be the best candidates for detecting planet-star tidal\ninteractions on the Northern hemisphere. Among them, there is the WASP-12\nsystem which is the best candidate for possessing an in-falling giant\nexoplanet. Our new observations support the scenario of orbital decay of\nWASP-12 b and allow us to refine its rate. The derived tidal quality parameter\nof the host star Q'_{*} = (1.82 +/- 0.32) x 10^5 is in agreement with\ntheoretical predictions for subgiant stars. For the remaining systems -\nHAT-P-23, KELT-1, KELT-16, WASP-33, and WASP-103 - our transit timing data\nreveal no deviations from the constant-period models, hence constraints on the\nindividual rates of orbital decay were placed. The tidal quality parameters of\nhost stars in at least 4 systems - HAT-P-23, KELT-1, WASP-33, and WASP-103 -\nwere found to be greater than the value reported for WASP-12. This is in line\nwith the finding that those hosts are main sequence stars, for which efficiency\nof tidal dissipation is predicted to be relatively weak. \n\n"}

The force arising from\nthe release of energy into the ambient medium by the perturber, or heating\nforce, is directed along the direction of motion and induces an acceleration of\nthe perturber. Its value is compared to analytic estimates in the low and high\nMach number limits, and found to match those accurately.

Achieving an accurate model of\ninterstellar dust is therefore of great importance. Interstellar dust models\nare usually built based on observational constraints such as starlight\nextinction and polarization, but dynamical constraints such as grain rotation\nare not considered. In this paper, we show that a newly discovered effect by\nHoang et al., so-called RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD), can act as an\nimportant dynamical constraint for dust models. Using this dynamical\nconstraint, we derive the maximum size of grains that survive in the ISM for\ndifferent dust models, including contact binary, composite, silicate-core, and\namorphous carbon mantle, and compact grain model for the different radiation\nfields. We find that the different dust models have different maximum size due\nto their different tensile strengths, and the largest maximum size corresponds\nto compact grains with the highest tensile strength. We show that the composite\ngrain model cannot be ruled out if constituent particles are very small with\nradius $a_{p}\\le$ 25 nm, but large composite grains would be destroyed if the\nparticles are large with $a_{p}\\ge 50$ nm. We suggest that grain internal\nstructures can be constrained with observations using the dynamical RATD\nconstraint for strong radiation fields such as supernova, nova, or star-forming\nregions. Finally, our obtained results suggest that micron-sized grains perhaps\nhave compact/core-mantle structures or have composite structures but located in\nregions with slightly higher gas density and weaker radiation intensity than\nthe average ISM. \n\n"}

We consider the evolution of dust in the\ninner disc, including growth, radial drift and fragmentation, and find that\ndust particles that radially drift into the inner disc fragment severely due to\nthe MRI-induced turbulence. This result has two consequences: (1) radial drift\nof grains within the inner disc is quenched, leading to an enhancement of dust\nin the inner regions which scales as dust-to-gas-mass-flux-ratio at ~1 AU; (2)\nhowever, despite this enhancement, planetesimal formation is impeded by the\nsmall grain size. Nevertheless, assuming that planetary cores are present in\nthe inner disc, we then investigate the accretion of atmospheres onto cores and\ntheir subsequent photoevaporation.

The satellite orbits Daphne on an equatorial, quasi-circular, prograde\norbit, like the satellites of many other large main-belt asteroids. The shape\nmodel of Daphne reveals several large flat areas that could be large impact\ncraters.

Concerning variants of the\nSPH hydro force formulation we consider both the \"vanilla\" SPH and the PSPH\nvariant included in GIZMO. We find, as expected, that the numerical noise\ninherent in these schemes affects turbulence significantly. A high order\nkernel, free of the pairing instability, is necessary. Both schemes can\nadequately simulate MRI turbulence in unstratified shearing boxes with net\nvertical flux. The turbulence, however, dies out in zero-net-flux unstratified\nboxes, probably due to excessive and numerical dissipation. In zero-net-flux\nvertically stratified simulations, MFM can reproduce the MRI dynamo and its\ncharacteristic butterfly diagram for several tens of orbits before ultimately\ndecaying. In contrast, extremely strong toroidal fields, as opposed to\nsustained turbulence, develop in equivalent simulations using SPH MHD. This\nunphysical state in SPH MHD is likely caused by a combination of excessive\nartificial viscosity, numerical resistivity, and the relatively large residual\nerrors in the divergence of the magnetic field remaining even after cleaning\nprocedures are applied. \n\n"}

Two\ndimming events of similar depth and duration were seen in 2008 (WASP) and 2011\n(KELT), consistent with an object in a closed periodic orbit. In this paper we\npresent data from a ground-based observing campaign designed to measure the\nstar both photometrically and spectroscopically during the time of predicted\neclipse in September 2017. Despite high-quality photometry, the predicted\neclipse did not occur, although coherent structure is present suggesting\nvariable amounts of stellar flux or dust obscuration. We also searched for RV\noscillations caused by any hypothetical companion and can rule out close\nbinaries to 0.1 $M_\\odot$. A search of Sonneberg plate archive data also\nenabled us to extend the photometric baseline of this star back more than 50\nyears, and similarly does not re-detect any deep eclipses. Taken together, they\nsuggest that the eclipses seen in WASP and KELT photometry were due to\naperiodic events. It would seem that PDS 110 undergoes stochastic dimmings that\nare shallower and shorter-duration than those of UX Ori variables, but may have\na similar mechanism. \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.08542", "contents": "Title: Origin of life's building blocks in Carbon and Nitrogen rich surface\n  hydrothermal vents Abstract: There are two dominant and contrasting classes of origin of life scenarios:\nthose predicting that life emerged in submarine hydrothermal systems, where\nchemical disequilibrium can provide an energy source for nascent life; and\nthose predicting that life emerged within subaerial environments, where UV\ncatalysis of reactions may occur to form the building blocks of life. Here, we\ndescribe a prebiotically plausible environment that draws on the strengths of\nboth scenarios: surface hydrothermal vents. We show how key feedstock molecules\nfor prebiotic chemistry can be produced in abundance in shallow and surficial\nhydrothermal systems. We calculate the chemistry of volcanic gases feeding\nthese vents over a range of pressures and basalt C/N/O contents. If\nultra-reducing carbon-rich nitrogen-rich gases interact with subsurface water\nat a volcanic vent they result in 1 mM to 1 M concentrations of diacetylene,\nacetylene, cyanoacetylene, hydrogen cyanide, bisulfite, hydrogen sulfide and\nsoluble iron in vent water. One key feedstock molecule, cyanamide, is not\nformed in significant quantities within this scenario, suggesting that it may\nneed to be delivered exogenously, or formed from hydrogen cyanide either via\norganometallic compounds, or by some as yet-unknown chemical synthesis. Given\nthe likely ubiquity of surface hydrothermal vents on young, hot, terrestrial\nplanets, these results identify a prebiotically plausible local geochemical\nenvironment, which is also amenable to future lab-based simulation. \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.08719", "contents": "Title: Searching for Super-Fast Rotators Using the Pan-STARRS 1 Abstract: A class of asteroids, called large super-fast rotators (large SFRs), have\nrotation periods shorter than 2 hours and diameters larger than ~ 0.3 km. They\npose challenges to the usual interior rubble-pile structure unless a relatively\nhigh bulk density is assumed. So far, only six large SFRs have been found.\nTherefore, we present a survey of asteroid rotation period using Pan-STARRS 1\ntelescopes during 2016 October 26 to 31 to search more large SFRs and study\ntheir properties. A total of 876 reliable rotation periods are measured, among\nwhich seven are large SFRs, thereby increasing the inventory of known large\nSFRs. These seven newly discovered large SFRs have diverse colors and locations\nin the main asteroid belt, suggesting that the taxonomic tendency and the\nlocation preference in the inner main belt of the six perviously known large\nSFRs could be a bias due to various observational limits. Interestingly, five\nout of the seven newly discovered large SFRs are mid main-belt asteroids.\nConsidering the rare discovery rates of large SFR in the previously similar\nsurveys (Chang et al., 2015, 2016) and the survey condition in this work, the\nchance of detecting a large SFR in the inner main belt seems to be relatively\nlow. This probably suggests that the inner main belt harbors less large SFRs\nthan the mid main belt. From our survey, we also found the drop in number\nappearing at f > 5 rev/day on the spin-rate distribution for the outer\nmain-belt asteroids of D < 3 km, which was reported for the inner and mid main\nbelt by (Chang et al., 2015, 2016). \n\n"}
