Numerical simulations of such systems require\nsuitable initial data. In this paper, we examine three methods of constructing\nbinary-black-hole initial data, focusing on their ability to generate black\nholes with nearly-extremal spins: (i) Bowen-York initial data, including\nstandard puncture data (based on conformal flatness and Bowen-York extrinsic\ncurvature), (ii) standard quasi-equilibrium initial data (based on the\nextended-conformal-thin-sandwich equations, conformal flatness, and maximal\nslicing), and (iii) quasi-equilibrium data based on the superposition of\nKerr-Schild metrics. We find that the two conformally-flat methods (i) and (ii)\nperform similarly, with spins up to about 0.99 obtainable at the initial time.\nHowever, in an evolution, we expect the spin to quickly relax to a\nsignificantly smaller value around 0.93 as the initial geometry relaxes. For\nquasi-equilibrium superposed Kerr-Schild (SKS) data [method (iii)], we\nconstruct initial data with \\emph{initial} spins as large as 0.9997. We evolve\nSKS data sets with spins of 0.93 and 0.97 and find that the spin drops by only\na few parts in 10^4 during the initial relaxation; therefore, we expect that\nSKS initial data will allow evolutions of binary black holes with relaxed spins\nabove 0.99.

In\nthe presence of precession, the gravitational-wave modes (l,m) contain\nharmonics originating from combinations of the orbital frequency and precession\nfrequencies. We find that the gravitational radiation from binary systems with\nlarge mass asymmetry and large inclination angle can be distributed among\nseveral modes. For example, during the last stages of inspiral, for some\nmaximally spinning configurations, the amplitude of the (2,0) and (2,1) modes\ncan be comparable to the amplitude of the (2,2) mode. If the mass ratio is not\ntoo extreme, the l=3 and l=4 modes are generally one or two orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the l = 2 modes.

Each halo is resolved with ~ 10^8 particles (at a mass\nresolution ~ 10^3-4 M_sun/h) within its virial radius. Subhaloes with masses\nlarger than 10^5 M_sun/h are well resolved, an improvement of at least two\norders of magnitude over previous lensing studies. We incorporate a baryonic\ncomponent modelled as a Hernquist profile and account for the response of the\ndark matter via adiabatic contraction. We focus on the \"anomalous\" flux ratio\nproblem, in particular on the violation of the cusp-caustic relation due to\nsubstructures. We find that subhaloes with masses less than ~ 10^8 M_sun/h play\nan important role in causing flux anomalies; such low mass subhaloes have been\nunresolved in previous studies. There is large scatter in the predicted flux\nratios between different haloes and between different projections of the same\nhalo. In some cases, the frequency of predicted anomalous flux ratios is\ncomparable to that observed for the radio lenses, although in most cases it is\nnot. The probability for the simulations to reproduce the observed violations\nof the cusp lenses is about 0.001. We therefore conclude that the amount of\nsubstructure in the central regions of the Aquarius haloes is insufficient to\nexplain the observed frequency of violations of the cusp-caustic relation.\nThese conclusions are based purely on our dark matter simulations which ignore\nthe effect of baryons on subhalo survivability. \n\n"}

We consider primordial binaries, dynamically formed\nbinaries (through tidal two-body and three-body exchange interactions) and\ndirect impacts of compact objects (WD/NS/BH). We show that if the primordial\nbinary fraction is small, close encounters dominate the production rate of\ncoalescing compact systems. We find that the two dominant channels are the\ninteraction of field NSs with dynamically formed binaries, and two-body\nencounters. We then estimate the redshift distribution and host galaxy\ndemographics of SGRB progenitors, and find that GCs can provide a significant\ncontribution to the overall observed rate.\n  We have carried out hydrodynamical modeling of evolution of close stellar\nencounters with WD/NS/BH, and show that there is no problem in accounting for\nthe energy budget of a typical SGRB.

It is argued\nthat the boundary layer between the Keplerian accretion disk and the event\nhorizon is best suited for the formation and acceleration of the\naccretion-powered jets in active galactic nuclei and micro-quasars.\n  The model is based on matching the solutions of three different regions: i- a\nweakly magnetized Keplerian accretion disk in the outer part, where the\ntransport of angular momentum is mediated through the magentorotational\ninstability, ii- a strongly magnetized, advection-dominated and turbulent-free\nboundary layer (BL) between the outer cold accretion disk and the event\nhorizon, where the plasma rotates sub-Keplerian and iii- a transition zone (TZ)\nbetween the BL and the overlying corona, where the electrons and protons are\nthermally uncoupled, highly dissipative and rotate super-Keplerian.\n  Our model predicts the known correlation between the Lorentz-factor and the\nspin parameter of the BH.

This problem can be overcome by applying an eccentricity-removal\nprocedure which consists in evolving the binary for a couple of orbits,\nestimating the eccentricity, and then correcting the initial conditions. The\npresence of spins can complicate this procedure. As predicted by post-Newtonian\ntheory, spin-spin interactions and precession prevent the binary from moving\nalong an adiabatic sequence of spherical orbits, inducing oscillations in the\nradial separation and in the orbital frequency. However, spin-induced\noscillations occur at approximately twice the orbital frequency, therefore they\ncan be distinguished from the initial spurious eccentricity, which occurs at\napproximately the orbital frequency. We develop a new removal procedure based\non the derivative of the orbital frequency and find that it is successful in\nreducing the eccentricity measured in the orbital frequency to less than 0.0001\nwhen moderate spins are present. We test this new procedure using\nnumerical-relativity simulations of binary black holes with mass ratios 1.5 and\n3, spin magnitude 0.5 and various spin orientations.

At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high\naccretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is\ncommonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion\ncauses the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and\nproduce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a\nblack hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low\naccretion rates, the magnetar is in the \"propeller regime\" and avoids becoming\na black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the\nmagnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial\nprotoneutron star is spinning rapidly.

We focus on the effect of an expanding\nuniverse on massive objects on the scale of galaxies and clusters. Using\nNewtonian and general-relativistic approaches, we identify two important\ntime-dependent physical radii for such objects when the cosmological expansion\nis accelerating. The first radius, $r_F$, is that at which the total radial\nforce on a test particle is zero, which is also the radius of the largest\npossible circular orbit about the central mass $m$ and where the gas pressure\nand its gradient vanish. The second radius, $r_S$, which is \\approx r_F/1.6$,\nis that of the largest possible stable circular orbit, which we interpret as\nthe theoretical maximum size for an object of mass $m$. In contrast, for a\ndecelerating cosmological expansion, no such finite radii exist. Assuming a\ncosmological expansion consistent with a $\\Lambda$CDM concordance model, at the\npresent epoch we find that these radii put a sensible constraint on the typical\nsizes of both galaxies and clusters at low redshift.

Using\nour new dynamical approach, we find an upturn in the mass-loss vs. Gamma\ndependence, at the point where the winds become optically thick. This coincides\nwith the location where wind efficiency numbers surpass the single-scattering\nlimit of Eta = 1, reaching values up to Eta = 2.5. Our modelling suggests a\ntransition from common O-type winds to Wolf-Rayet characteristics at the point\nwhere the winds become optically thick. This transitional behaviour is also\nrevealed with respect to the wind acceleration parameter beta, which starts at\nvalues below 1 for the optically thin O-stars, and naturally reaches values as\nhigh as 1.5-2 for the optically thick Wolf-Rayet models. An additional finding\nconcerns the transition in spectral morphology of the Of and WN characteristic\nHe II line at 4686 Angstrom.

Short bursts (with durations of less than ~2 s)\nare less frequently observed, technically more difficult to localize, and\nexhibit significantly fainter afterglows. Aims: It is of critical importance to\nestablish whether the burst duration can reliably distinguish the different GRB\npopulation models of collapsars and compact stellar mergers. The Swift GRB\n090426 provides an unique opportunity to address this question. Its duration\n(T_90=1.28 s) places GRB 090426 firmly in the short burst population, while the\nhigh redshift (z=2.609), host galaxy properties, and prompt emission spectral\ncharacteristics are more similar to those of long-duration GRBs. Methods: On\nthe basis of data obtained with the Tautenburg 2m telescope (Germany) and the\n7-channel imager GROND (La Silla, Chile), we compiled the most finely sampled\nlight curve available for a short burst optical/NIR afterglow. The light curve\nwas then analysed in a standard fashion.

This light curve\ndecay is achromatic in the optical/NIR bands, and interpreted as a post-jet\nbreak phase. The X-ray data do not disagree with this interpretation.\nConclusions: The half-opening angle of the suspected jet as well as the\nluminosity of the optical afterglow provide additional evidence that GRB 090426\nis probably linked to the death of a massive star rather than to the merger of\ntwo compact objects. \n\n"}

Our\nanalysis is concentrated on a detailed numerical investigation of hot\ntwo-dimensional, Bondi-Hoyle accretion flows with various Mach numbers. We find\nsignificant differences with respect to purely hydrodynamical evolutions. In\nparticular, once the system relaxes to a radiation-pressure dominated regime,\nthe accretion rates become about two orders of magnitude smaller than in the\npurely hydrodynamical case, remaining however super-Eddington as are the\nluminosities. Furthermore, when increasing the Mach number of the inflowing\ngas, the accretion rates become smaller because of the smaller cross section of\nthe black hole, but the luminosities increase as a result a stronger emission\nin the shocked regions. Overall, our approach provides the first\nself-consistent calculation of the Bondi-Hoyle luminosity, most of which is\nemitted within r~100 M from the black hole, with typical values L/L_Edd ~ 1-7,\nand corresponding energy efficiencies eta_BH ~ 0.09-0.5.

We study the impact of this effect on\nthe star formation history of galaxies. We incorporate metallicity-dependent\nstar formation and metal enrichment in a simple model that follows the\nevolution of a halo main progenitor. Our model shows that including the effect\nof metallicity leads to suppression of star formation at redshift z>2 in dark\nhalos with masses <~ 10^11 Msun, with the suppression becoming near total for\nhalos below ~10^9.5-10 Msun. We find that at high redshift the SFR cannot catch\nup with the gas inflow rate (IR), because the SFR is limited by the free-fall\ntime, and because it is suppressed further by a lack of metals. As a result, in\neach galaxy the SFR is growing in time faster than the IR, and the integrated\ncosmic SFR density is rising with time. The suppressed in situ SFR at high z\nmakes the growth of stellar mass dominated by ex situ SFR which implies that\nthe specific SFR (sSFR) remains constant with time. The intensely accreted gas\nat high z is accumulating as an atomic gas reservoir. This provides additional\nfuel for star formation in 10^10 - 10^12 Msun halos at z ~ 1-3, which allows\nthe SFR to exceed the instantaneous IR, and may enable an even higher outflow\nrate. At z<1, following the natural decline in IR with time due to the\nuniversal expansion, the SFR and sSFR are expected to drop. We specify the\nexpected dependence of sSFR and metallicity on stellar mass and redshift. At a\ngiven z, and below a critical mass, these relations are predicted to be flat\nand rising respectively.

This scheme combines\ntools from different techniques in General Relativity: It uses a multipolar,\npost-Minkowskian (MPM) expansion for the far-zone metric perturbation (which\nprovides the gravitational waveforms, here taken up to mass hexadecapole and\ncurrent octopole order) and for the local prescription of the self-force (since\nwe are lacking a general prescription for it); a post-Newtonian expansion for\nthe computation of the multipole moments in terms of the trajectories; and a BH\nperturbation theory expansion when treating the trajectories as a sequence of\nself-adjusting Kerr geodesics. The orbital evolution is thus equivalent to\nsolving the geodesic equations with time-dependent orbital elements, as\ndictated by the MPM radiation-reaction prescription.

In the\nrapidly growing population of remnants with observationally determined masses,\na striking mass gap has emerged at the boundary between neutron stars and black\nholes. The heaviest neutron stars reach a maximum of two solar masses, while\nthe lightest black holes are at least five solar masses.

Such variations are correlated with the\nposition of the source on the detector and can be ascribed to an instrumental\neffect, most likely a spatial dependence of the channel to energy relation. For\nthe sampled instrumental coordinates, we quantify this effect as variations of\n\\sim 4% and \\sim 15 eV in the gain slope and offset, respectively.

In an intermediate regime, with a\nmass range that depends on the uncertain details of rotation and mass loss\nduring the star's life, a NS is initially formed which then experiences\nfallback accretion and collapse to a BH. The electromagnetic consequence of\nsuch an event is not clear. Depending on the progenitor's structure,\npossibilities range from a long gamma-ray burst to a Type II supernova (that\nmay or may not be jet-powered) to a collapse with a weak electromagnetic\nsignature. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide the exciting opportunity to peer\nthrough the envelope of a dying massive star and directly probe what is\noccurring inside. We explore whether fallback onto young NSs can be detected by\nground-based interferometers. When the incoming material has sufficient angular\nmomentum to form a disk, the accretion spins up the NS sufficiently to produce\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities and gravitational radiation at frequencies of\n~700-2400 Hz for ~30-3000 s until collapse to a BH occurs.

From the rate of nearby core-collapse supernovae,\nwe estimate that there will be ~1-2 events each year that are worth checking\nfor fallback GWs. The observation of these unique GW signatures coincident with\nelectromagnetic detections would identify the transient events that are\nassociated with this channel of BH formation, while providing information about\nthe protoneutron star progenitor. \n\n"}

If this\nscenario is correct, then short GRBs will be accompanied by the emission of\nstrong gravitational waves (GWs), detectable by GW observatories such as LIGO,\nVirgo, KAGRA, and LIGO-India. As compared with blind, all-sky, all-time GW\nsearches, externally triggered searches for GW counterparts to short GRBs have\nthe advantages of both significantly reduced detection threshold due to known\ntime and sky location and enhanced GW amplitude because of face-on orientation.\nBased on the distribution of signal-to-noise ratios in candidate compact binary\ncoalescence events in the most recent joint LIGO-Virgo data, our analytic\nestimates, and our Monte Carlo simulations, we find an effective sensitive\nvolume for GRB-triggered searches that is about 2 times greater than for an\nall-sky, all-time search.

Both the persistent and transient black holes remain for long\nperiods in a state where their spectra are dominated by a thermal accretion\ndisk component. The spin of a black hole of known mass and distance can be\nmeasured by fitting this thermal continuum spectrum to the thin-disk model of\nNovikov and Thorne; the key fit parameter is the radius of the inner edge of\nthe black hole's accretion disk. Strong observational and theoretical evidence\nlinks the inner-disk radius to the radius of the innermost stable circular\norbit, which is trivially related to the dimensionless spin parameter a_* of\nthe black hole (|a_*| < 1).

For the first time, we are able to analyze a sizable population\nof NSs with a flexible modeling approach that can effectively accommodate a\nskewed underlying distribution and asymmetric measurement errors. We find that\nNSs that have evolved through different evolutionary paths reflect distinctive\nsignatures through dissimilar distribution peak and mass cutoff values. NSs in\ndouble neutron star and neutron star-white dwarf systems show consistent\nrespective peaks at 1.33 Msun and 1.55 Msun suggesting significant mass\naccretion (delta m~0.22 Msun) has occurred during the spin-up phase. The width\nof the mass distribution implied by double NS systems is indicative of a tight\ninitial mass function while the inferred mass range is significantly wider for\nNSs that have gone through recycling. We find a mass cutoff at ~2.1 Msun for\nNSs with white dwarf companions which establishes a firm lower bound for the\nmaximum NS mass. This rules out the majority of strange quark and soft equation\nof state models as viable configurations for NS matter. The lack of truncation\nclose to the maximum mass cutoff along with the skewed nature of the inferred\nmass distribution both enforce the suggestion that the 2.1 Msun limit is set by\nevolutionary constraints rather than nuclear physics or general relativity, and\nthe existence of rare super-massive NSs is possible. \n\n"}

Large uncertainties\nabout the evolution of massive stars preclude definitive rate predictions for\nmergers of these massive black holes. We show that rates as high as hundreds of\ndetections per year, or as low as no detections whatsoever, are both possible.\nIt was thought that the only way to produce these massive binaries was via\ndynamical interactions in dense stellar systems. This view has been challenged\nby the recent discovery of several stars with mass above 150 Msun in the R136\nregion of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Current models predict that when stars of\nthis mass leave the main sequence, their expansion is insufficient to allow\ncommon envelope evolution to efficiently reduce the orbital separation.

We consider a single\npower-law model for the DM mini-spike which is assumed to consist of\nnon-annihilating DM particles and demonstrate that an eLISA/NGO detection of GW\nfrom such a binary enables us to measure the DM mini-spike parameters very\naccurately. For instance, in our reference case originally advocated by Zhao\nand Silk (2005) and Bertone et al. (2005), we could determine the power-law\nindex $\\alpha$ of the DM mini-spike radial profile with a 1 $\\sigma$ relative\nerror of $\\pm 5\\times 10^{-6}$ for a GW signal with signal-to-noise-ratio 10\nand assuming a 5 year observation with eLISA.

This symmetry gives rise to a\nfirst integral of the Euler equation, often employed for constructing\nequilibrium solutions via iteration. For eccentric orbits, however, the lack of\nhelical symmetry has prevented the use of this method, and the numerical\nrelativity community has often resorted to constructing initial data by\nsuperimposing boosted spherical stars without solving the Euler equation. The\nspuriously excited neutron star oscillations seen in evolutions of such data\narise because such configurations lack the appropriate tidal deformations and\nare stationary in a linearly comoving---rather than rotating---frame. We\nconsider eccentric configurations at apoapsis that are instantaneously\nstationary in a rotating frame. We extend the notion of helical symmetry to\neccentric orbits, by approximating the elliptical orbit of each companion as\ninstantaneously circular, using the ellipse's inscribed circle. The two\ninscribed helical symmetry vectors give rise to approximate instantaneous first\nintegrals of the Euler equation throughout each companion. We use these\nintegrals as the basis of a self-consistent iteration of the Einstein\nconstraints to construct conformal thin-sandwich initial data for eccentric\nbinaries. We find that the spurious stellar oscillations are reduced by at\nleast an order of magnitude, compared with those found in evolutions of\nsuperposed initial data. The tidally induced oscillations, however, are\nphysical and qualitatively similar to earlier evolutions. Finally, we show how\nto incorporate radial velocity due to radiation reaction in our inscribed\nhelical symmetry vectors, which would allow one to obtain truly non-eccentric\ninitial data when our eccentricity parameter $e$ is set to zero. \n\n"}

Gravitational perturbations from\nthe BH companion, on a much wider orbit, can cause the dark matter particle to\nreach extremely high eccentricities and even get accreted onto the BH, by what\nis known as the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. We show that this may\nproduce a torus-like configuration for the dark matter distribution around the\nless massive member of the BH binary. We first consider an Intermediate BH\n(IMBH) in the vicinity of our Galactic Center, which may be a relic of a past\nminor merger. We show that if the IMBH is close enough (i.e., near the stellar\ndisk) the EKL mechanism is very efficient in exciting the eccentricity of dark\nmatter particles in near-polar configurations to extremely high values where\nthey are accreted by the IMBH. We show that this mechanism is even more\neffective if the central BH grows in mass, where we have assumed adiabatic\ngrowth.

Leading models relate SGRBs to a relativistic jet\nlaunched by the BH-torus system resulting from the merger.

Here we present\na novel scenario accommodating both aspects, where the SGRB is produced after\nthe collapse of a supramassive NS.

We use the {\\tt RIDGE} pipeline for the\nanalysis, in which the network of LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, VIRGO, and\nKAGRA is considered. By combining with a GW spectrogram analysis, we show that\nseveral important hydrodynamics features in the original waveforms persist in\nthe waveforms of the reconstructed signals. The characteristic excess in the\nspectrograms originates not only from rotating core-collapse, bounce and the\nsubsequent ring down of the proto-neutron star (PNS) as previously identified,\nbut also from the formation of magnetohydrodynamics jets and non-axisymmetric\ninstabilities in the vicinity of the PNS. Regarding the GW signals emitted near\nat the rotating core bounce, the horizon distance extends up to $\\sim$ 18 kpc\nfor the most rapidly rotating 3D model in this work. Following the rotating\ncore bounce, the dominant source of the GW emission shifts to the\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities.

In this\ncontext, the rapid neutron capture process, or r process, can be used as a\nconstraint assuming NSM is the main astrophysical site for this nucleosynthetic\nprocess. We compute the early cosmic evolution of a typical r process element,\nEuropium. Eu yields from NSM are taken from recent nucleosynthesis\ncalculations. The same approach allows to compute the cosmic rate of Core\nCollapse SuperNovae (CCSN) and the associated evolution of Eu. We find that the\nbulk of Eu observations at high iron abundance can be rather well fitted by\neither CCSN or NSM scenarios.

The main reason is that many of the NS in these systems appear to be\nspinning well below their Keplerian breakup frequency, and it has been\nsuggested that torques associated with GW emission may be setting the observed\nspin period. This assumption has been used extensively in the literature to\nassess the strength of the likely gravitational wave signal.

Abstract: Measurements of black-hole spins from gravitational-wave observations of\nblack-hole binaries with ground-based detectors are expected to be hampered by\npartial degeneracies in the gravitational-wave phasing: between the two\ncomponent spins, and between the spins and the binary's mass ratio, at least\nfor signals that are dominated by the binary's inspiral. Through the merger and\nringdown, however, a different set of degeneracies apply. This suggests the\npossibility that, if the inspiral, merger and ringdown are all within the\nsensitive frequency band of a detector, we may be able to break these\ndegeneracies and more accurately measure both spins. In this work we\ninvestigate our ability to measure individual spins for non-precessing\nbinaries, for a range of configurations and signal strengths, and conclude that\nin general the spin of the larger black hole will be measurable (at best) with\nobservations from Advanced LIGO and Virgo.

In any single pulsar, a stochastic gravitational wave signal appears as\nan additional source of timing noise that can be absorbed by the noise model,\nand so it is only by considering the coherent response across a network of\npulsars that the signal can be distinguished from other sources of noise. In\nthe limit where there are many gravitational wave sources in the sky, or many\npulsars in the array, the signals produce a unique tensor correlation pattern\nthat depends only on the angular separation between each pulsar pair. It is\nthis distinct fingerprint that is used to search for gravitational waves using\npulsar timing arrays. Here we consider how the prospects for detection are\ndiminished when the statistical isotropy of the timing array or the\ngravitational wave signal is broken by having a finite number of pulsars and a\nfinite number of sources. We find the standard tensor-correlation analysis to\nbe remarkably robust, with a mild impact on detectability compared to the\nisotropic limit. Only when there are very few sources and very few pulsars does\nthe standard analysis begin to fail. Having established that the tensor\ncorrelations are a robust signature for detection, we study the use of\n\"sky-scrambles\" to break the correlations as a way to increase confidence in a\ndetection.

We consider a disc that is misaligned at large\nradii and torqued by Lense-Thirring (LT) precession and a Blandford-Znajek (BZ)\njet torque.

Tidal captures may turn off as a\ngrowth channel once the black hole reaches a mass ~100-1000 solar masses, but\ntidal disruption events will continue and appear capable of growing the seed\nSMBH to larger sizes. The runaway slows (becomes sub-exponential) once the seed\nSMBH consumes the core of its host NSC.

We provide a self-consistent, unified treatment of TDEs by non-spinning\n(Schwarzschild) black holes, investigating several effects of general\nrelativity including changes to the boundary in phase space that defines the\nloss-cone orbits on which stars are tidally disrupted or captured. TDE rates\ndecrease rapidly at large black-hole masses due to direct stellar capture, but\nthis effect is slightly countered by the widening of the loss cone due to the\nstronger tidal fields in general relativity. We provide a new mapping procedure\nthat translates between Newtonian gravity and general relativity, allowing us\nto better compare predictions in both gravitational theories. Partial tidal\ndisruptions in relativity will strip more material from the star and produce\nmore tightly bound debris than in Newtonian gravity for a stellar orbit with\nthe same angular momentum. However, for deep encounters leading to full\ndisruption in both theories, the stronger tidal forces in relativity imply that\nthe star is disrupted further from the black hole and that the debris is\ntherefore less tightly bound, leading to a smaller peak fallback accretion\nrate.

Here the\nquantum nuclear shell model is adopted to describe the permitted energy levels\nof the SB, which are assumed to be identical to the discrete spinning rates\n$\\Omega_{SB},$ that SBs are allowed to rotate with. Accordingly, a glitch-event\ncorresponds to a prompt spin-down of the superconducting SB from one energy\nlevel to the next, thereby expelling a certain number of vortices, which in\nturn spins-up the ambient medium. The process is provoked mainly by the\nnegative torque of the ambient dissipative nuclear fluid and by a universal\nscalar field $\\phi$ at the background of a supranuclear dense matter. As\ndictated by the Onsager-Feynman equation, the prompt spin-down must be\nassociated with increase of the dimensions of the embryonic SB to finally\nconvert the entire pulsar into SB-Objects on the scale of Gyrs.

Photon transport plays a crucial role in radiatively dominated\naccretion disks, while neutrino transport is critical to core-collapse\nsupernovae and to the modeling of electromagnetic transients and\nnucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers. However, evolving the full Boltzmann\nequations of radiative transport is extremely expensive. Here, we describe the\nimplementation in the general relativistic SpEC code of a cheaper radiation\nhydrodynamics method which theoretically converges to a solution of Boltzmann's\nequation in the limit of infinite numerical resources. The algorithm is based\non a gray two-moment scheme, in which we evolve the energy density and momentum\ndensity of the radiation. Two-moment schemes require a closure which fills in\nmissing information about the energy spectrum and higher-order moments of the\nradiation.

In general, the empirical relationship\nof SNIa on the absolute peak magnitude $M_{\\rm B}$ is calibrated by Cepheid\nvariables in the near distance scale and directly extrapolated to much farther\ndistances. Two main problems arise. First, their calibration, in particular the\ndetermination of $M_{\\rm B}$, depends on the empirical relationship of Cepheid\nvariables, which suffers from various uncertainties. The second is related to\nthe homogeneity of SNIa in their true $M_{\\rm B}$, which is known to be poor in\ndifferent environments.

Solving relativistic hydrodynamic equations for a spherically\nsymmetric star we have studied the phase transition assuming a considerable\ndensity discontinuity near the center. We find that as the shock wave\npropagates outwards, its intensity decreases with time, however the shock\nvelocity peaks up and reaches a value close to that of light.

A\nSedov-Taylor explosion in a homogeneous magnetic field generates an oblate\nellipsoidal shock surface due to the slower propagating blast wave in the\ndirection of the magnetic field. This is because of the efficient cosmic ray\n(CR) production in the quasi-parallel polar cap regions, which softens the\nequation of state and increases the compressibility of the post-shock gas. We\nfind that the solution remains self-similar because the ellipticity of the\npropagating blast wave stays constant in time. This enables us to derive an\neffective ratio of specific heats for a composite of thermal gas and CRs as a\nfunction of the maximum acceleration efficiency. We finally discuss the\nbehavior of supernova remnants expanding into a turbulent magnetic field with\nvarying coherence lengths. For a maximum CR acceleration efficiency of about 15\nper cent at quasi-parallel shocks (as suggested by kinetic plasma simulations),\nwe find an average efficiency of about 5 per cent, independent of the assumed\nmagnetic coherence length. \n\n"}

This quantity, the effective spin\n$\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is conserved up to at least the second post-Newtonian\norder. The measured distribution of $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ values from a\npopulation of detected binaries, and in particular whether this distribution is\nsymmetric about zero, encodes valuable information about the underlying\ncompact-binary formation channels. In this paper we focus on two important\ncomplications of using the effective spin to study astrophysical population\nproperties: (i) an astrophysical distribution for $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ values\nwhich is symmetric does not necessarily lead to a symmetric distribution for\nthe detected effective spin values, leading to a \\emph{selection bias}; and\n(ii) the posterior distribution of $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for individual events\nis \\emph{asymmetric} and it cannot usually be treated as a Gaussian.

Firstly, we study the reconstruction problem and present two\nways in which to solve it within the context of scalar field theory, by\nutilising a duality relation between an effective average action and a\nWilsonian effective action. Along the way we also prove a duality relation\nbetween two effective average actions computed with different UV cutoff\nprofiles. Next we investigate the requirement of background independence within\nthe derivative expansion of conformally reduced gravity. We show that modified\nWard identities are compatible with the flow equations if and only if either\nthe anomalous dimension vanishes or the cutoff profile is chosen to be power\nlaw, and furthermore show that no solutions exist if the Ward identities are\nincompatible. In the compatible case, a clear reason is found why Ward\nidentities can still forbid the existence of fixed points. By expanding in\nvertices, we also demonstrate that the combined equations generically become\neither over-constrained or highly redundant at the six-point level. Finally, we\nconsider the asymptotic behaviour of fixed point solutions in the $f(R)$\napproximation and explain in detail how to construct them. We find that quantum\nfluctuations do not decouple at large $R$, typically leading to elaborate\nasymptotic solutions containing several free parameters.

The most popular progenitor model invokes the merger of either double\nneutron star (DNS) binaries or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) systems. Such\nevents are strong sources of gravitational-waves (GWs) and might be detected by\nground-based GW observatories. In this work we combine the census of SHB\nobservations with refined theoretical analysis to perform a critical evaluation\nof the compact binary model. We then explore the implications for GW detection\nof these events. Beginning from the measured star-formation rate through cosmic\ntime, we consider what intrinsic luminosity and lifetime distributions can\nreproduce the known SHB redshifts and luminosities as well as the peak flux\ndistribution of the large BATSE SHB sample. We find that: (1) The typical\nprogenitor lifetime is long. Assuming lognormal lifetime distribution the\ntypical lifetime is >4[1] Gyr (2[3]\\sigma c.l.). If the lifetime distribution\nis a power-law with index \\eta then \\eta>-0.5 [-1] (2[3] \\sigma c.l.). This\nresult is difficult to reconcile with the properties of the observed galactic\nDNS population, suggesting that if SHBs do result from DNS mergers then the\nobserved galactic binaries do not represent the cosmic one. (2) We find that\nthe local rate of SHBs is larger than 10Gpc^-3/yr and may be higher by several\norders of magnitude, significantly above previous estimates. (3) Assuming that\nSHBs do result from compact binaries, our predictions for the LIGO and VIRGO\nevent rates are encouraging: The chance for detection by current facilities is\nnot negligible, while a coincident detection of GW and electromagnetic\nradiation from an SHB is guaranteed for next-generation observatories. \n\n"}

At this redshift the isotropic-equivalent\nprompt energy release was about 1.5 x 10^51 erg, and using the standard\nafterglow synchrotron model we find that the blastwave kinetic energy is\nsimilar, E_K,iso ~ 8.4 x 10^51 erg. An observed jet break at t ~ 5 days\nindicates that the opening angle is ~ 7 degrees and the total beaming-corrected\nenergy is therefore ~ 2.5 x 10^49 erg, comparable to the values inferred for\nprevious short GRBs. We further show that the burst experienced an episode of\nenergy injection by a factor of 3.4 between t=1.4 and 3.4 hours, which was\naccompanied by reverse shock emission in the radio band.

The toroidal field B_t tends to\ndistort the NS into a prolate shape, and this magnetic distortion can easily\ndominate over the oblateness ``frozen into'' the NS crust. An elastic NS with\nfrozen-in B-field of this magnitude is clearly secularly unstable: the wobble\nangle between the NS's angular momentum J^i and the star's magnetic axis n_B^i\ngrow on a dissipation timescale until J^i and n_B^i are orthogonal. This final\norientation is clearly the optimal one for gravitational-wave (gw) emission.\nThe basic cause of the instability is quite general, so we conjecture that the\nsame final state is reached for a realistic NS. Assuming this, we show that for\nLMXB's with B_t of order 10^{13}G, the spindown from gw's is sufficient to\nbalance the accretion torque--supporting a suggestion by Bildsten. The spindown\nrates of most millisecond pulsars can also be attributed to gw emission sourced\nby toroidal B-fields, and both these sources could be observed by LIGO II.\nWhile the first-year spindown of a newborn NS is most likely dominated by em\nprocesses, reasonable values of B_t and the (external) dipolar field B_d can\nlead to detectable levels of gw emission, for a newborn NS in our own galaxy. \n\n"}

This means that the output of an interferometer must be\ncross- correlated with many waveform templates to dig out faint signals buried\nin the noise. The templates are characterized by several parameters which vary\ncontinuously over some finite range; but because the amount of computing power\navailable to perform the cross-correlations of the search templates with the\noutput is finite, the actual templates used must be picked with certain\ndiscrete values of these parameters, which will have some finite spacing. If\nthe spacing is too small, the number of templates (and therefore the computing\npower) needed to perform an on-line search becomes prohibitive; if the spacing\nis too large, many chirps will not be detected because the values of their\nparameters lie too far from those of the nearest template.

However, the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen BPS cosmic\nstrings produced at the end of original D3/D7 inflation lead to an additional\ncontribution to the CMB anisotropy. To make this contribution consistent with\nthe WMAP results one needs an extremely small gauge coupling in the effective\nD-term inflation model. Such couplings may be difficult to justify in string\ntheory. Here we develop a generalized version of the D3/D7 brane model, which\nleads to semilocal strings, instead of the topologically stable ANO cosmic\nstrings. We show that the semilocal strings have unbroken supersymmetry when\nembedded into supergravity with FI terms. The energy of these strings is\nindependent of their thickness. We confirm the existing arguments that strings\nof such type disappear soon after their formation and do not pose any\ncosmological problems, for any value of the gauge coupling.
