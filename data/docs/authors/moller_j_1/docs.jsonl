Its forces may be suppressed\njust below the current bounds by the chameleon-like mimicry, whereby only outer\nlayers of mass distributions, of thickness $1/m_\\phi$, give off appreciable\nlong range forces.

We find an extra contribution to the vacuum energy in comparison\nwith Minkowski space time with metric ds^2= dt^2-dx^2. This extra contribution\ncan be traced to the unphysical degrees of freedom (in Minkowski space). The\ntechnical reason for this effect to occur is the property of Bogolubov's\ncoefficients which mix the positive and negative frequencies modes. The\ncorresponding mixture can not be avoided because the projections to positive\n-frequency modes with respect to Minkowski time t and positive -frequency modes\nwith respect to the Rindler observer's proper time \\eta are not equivalent. The\nexact cancellation of unphysical degrees of freedom which is maintained in\nMinkowski space can not hold in the Rindler space. In BRST approach this effect\nmanifests itself as the presence of BRST charge density in L and R parts.

These\nspectral distortions depend on the shape and amplitude of the primordial power\nspectrum at wavenumbers k < 10^4 Mpc^{-1}.

We combine Fast\nFourier Transform algorithms and accelerated Matsubara sums in order to achieve\na high accuracy. Our results confirm and complete earlier ones obtained in the\nreal time formalism [1] but which were less accurate due to the integration in\nMinkowski space and the discretization of the spectral density function. We\nalso provide a complete and explicit discussion of the renormalization of the\ntwo-loop Phi-derivable approximation at finite temperature, both in the\nsymmetric and in the broken phase, which was already used in the real-time\napproach, but never published. Our main result is that the two-loop\nPhi-derivable approximation suffices to cure the problem of the Hartree\napproximation regarding the order of the transition: the transition is of the\nsecond order type, as expected on general grounds.

Such an emergent nature is most apparent in the structure of\ngravitational dynamics. It is, however, possible to go beyond the field\nequations and study the space itself as emergent in a well-defined manner in\n(and possibly only in) the context of cosmology. In the first part of this\nreview, I describe various pieces of evidence which show that gravitational\nfield equations are emergent.

A characteristic\nfeature of vacuum energy is that it has a pressure with the same amplitude, but\nopposite sign to its energy density, while all the precision tests of General\nRelativity are either in vacuum, or for media with negligible pressure.\nTherefore, one may wonder whether an anomalous coupling to pressure might be\nresponsible for decoupling vacuum from gravity. We test this possibility in the\ncontext of the \\textit{Gravitational Aether} proposal, using current\ncosmological observations, which probe the gravity of relativistic pressure in\nthe radiation era.

The elimination of the uncertainty in setting the renormalization\nscale in pQCD will greatly increase the precision of collider tests of the\nStandard Model and the sensitivity to new phenomena.

The well-known\nBrodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie (BLM) approach cannot be easily extended beyond\nnext-to-next-to-leading order of pQCD.

Quasi-single-field (QsF) inflation is a relatively simple family of\nphenomenological models that serve as a proxy for theories with additional\nfields with masses $m\\sim H$. Since QsF inflation involves fields in addition\nto the inflaton, the consistency conditions (ccs) between correlations that\narise in single-clock inflation are not necessarily satisfied. As a result,\ncorrelation functions in the squeezed limit may be larger than in single-field\ninflation. Scalar non-Gaussianities mediated by the massive isocurvature field\nin QsF have been shown to be potentially observable. These are especially\ninteresting since they would convey information about the mass of the\nisocurvature field. Here we consider non-Gaussian correlators involving tensor\nmodes and their observational signatures. A physical correlation between a\n(long-wavelength) tensor mode and two scalar modes (tss), for instance, may\ngive rise to local departures from statistical isotropy or, in other words, a\nnon-trivial four-point function.

In this article, we review how one can\nprobe general relativity and various alternative theories of gravity by using\nelectromagnetic waves from a black hole with an accretion disk, and\ngravitational waves from black hole binaries. We first review model-independent\nways of testing gravity with electromagnetic/gravitational waves from a black\nhole system.

In the inflationary Universe, i.e., de Sitter space, the\nvacuum field fluctuations $\\left< {\\delta \\phi }^{ 2 } \\right>$ enlarge in\nproportion to the Hubble scale $H^{2}$. Therefore, the large inflationary\nvacuum fluctuations of the Higgs field $\\left< {\\delta \\phi }^{ 2 } \\right>$\nare potentially catastrophic to trigger the vacuum transition to the\nnegative-energy Planck-scale vacuum state and cause an immediate collapse of\nthe Universe. However, the vacuum field fluctuations $\\left< {\\delta \\phi }^{ 2\n} \\right>$, i.e., the vacuum expectation values have an ultraviolet divergence,\nand therefore a renormalization is necessary to estimate the physical effects\nof the vacuum transition. Thus, in this paper, we revisit the electroweak\nvacuum instability from the perspective of quantum field theory (QFT) in curved\nspace-time, and discuss the dynamical behavior of the homogeneous Higgs field\n$\\phi$ determined by the effective potential ${ V }_{\\rm eff}\\left( \\phi\n\\right)$ in curved space-time and the renormalized vacuum fluctuations $\\left<\n{\\delta \\phi }^{ 2 } \\right>_{\\rm ren}$ via adiabatic regularization and\npoint-splitting regularization.

In the frame\nwhere matter is minimally coupled, it originates from the so-called beyond\nHorndeski quadratic Lagrangian. We extend the Effective Theory of Interacting\nDark Energy by allowing disformal coupling coefficients to depend on the\ngradient of the scalar field as well.

Contrary to the\ncase of Q-balls, there is no evident conserved charge that stabilizes the\nlocalized configuration. Nevertheless, in many classical numerical simulations,\nit has been shown that they are extremely long-lived. In this paper, we clarify\nthe reason for the longevity, and show how the exponential separation of time\nscales emerges dynamically. Those solutions are time-periodic with a typical\nfrequency of a mass scale of a scalar field. This observation implies that they\ncan be understood by the effective theory after integrating out relativistic\nmodes. We find that the resulting effective theory has an approximate global\nU(1) symmetry reflecting an approximate number conservation in the\nnon-relativistic regime. As a result, the profile of those solutions is\nobtained via the bounce method, just like Q-balls, as long as the breaking of\nthe U(1) symmetry is small enough. We then discuss the decay processes of the\nI-ball/oscillon by the breaking of the U(1) symmetry, namely the production of\nrelativistic modes via number violating processes. We show that the imaginary\npart is exponentially suppressed, which explains the extraordinary longevity of\nI-ball/oscillon. In addition, we find that there are some attractor behaviors\nduring the evolution of I-ball/oscillon that further enhance the lifetime. The\nvalidity of our effective theory is confirmed by classical numerical\nsimulations.

In our studies,\nLorentz symmetric models are extended by the inclusion of higher-order LIV\noperators, which improve the convergence of loop integrals and introduce a\nnatural mass scale to the theories. We then present how Lorentz invariance can\nbe recovered, for both models, after quantisation, in such a way that the\ndynamical masses and mixing are the only quantum effects that remain finite.\n  Additionally, we study how matter fields, especially fermions, behave when\ncoupled to two modified gravity models.

In particular, we consider Horava-Lifshitz gravity, which presents\nan improved ultraviolet behaviour when compared to General Relativity (GR), and\nthus addresses a fundamental problem in physics: the\nnon-(perturbative-)renormalisability of the theory of GR.

On one hand, current cosmological observations\nconstrain the properties of possible environments and place upper bounds on the\ninteraction strengths.

A threshold $\\zeta_{\\rm th}$ for the\ncurvature perturbation is somewhat inappropriate for this purpose, because it\ndepends significantly on environmental effects, not essential to the local\ndynamics. By contrast, a threshold $\\delta_{\\rm th}$ for the density\nperturbation at horizon crossing seems to provide a more robust criterion.

In case of two flavours direct pictorial\nevidence is given that the theory undergoes a phase-transition at $T_c=0$. The\nlatter is confirmed - as predicted by Smilga and Verbaarschot - to be of second\norder but for the critical exponent $\\delta$ the numerical value is found to be\n2 which is at variance with their bosonization-rule based prediction\n$\\delta=3$. \n\n"}

In renormalizable global supersymmetry, flat directions are\nubiquitous, but they are not preserved in a generic supergravity theory. It is\nknown that at least some of them are preserved in no-scale supergravity, and\nsimple generalizations of it. We here study a more realistic generalization,\nbased on string-derived supergravity, using the linear supermultiplet formalism\nfor the dilaton. We consider a general class of hybrid inflation models, where\na Fayet-Illiopoulos $D$ term drives some fields to large values. The potential\nis dominated by the $F$ term, but flatness is preserved in some directions.\nThis allows inflation, with the dilaton stabilized in its domain of attraction,\nand some moduli stabilized at their vacuum values. Another modulus may be the\ninflaton. \n\n"}

We take a continuum limit of the lattice Jacobian factor without\nreferring to perturbative expansion and recover the result of continuum theory\nby using only the general properties of the lattice Dirac operator. This\nprocedure is based on a set of well-defined rules and thus provides an\nalternative approach to the conventional analysis of the chiral Jacobian and\nrelated anomaly in continuum theory. By using an explicit form of the lattice\nDirac operator introduced by Neuberger, which satisfies the Ginsparg-Wilson\nrelation, we illustrate our calculation in some detail. We also briefly comment\non the index theorem with a finite cut-off from the present viewpoint. \n\n"}

The sensitivity of the\nhadronic spectra on the equation of state vis- a -vis the velocity of sound has\nbeen discussed.

The resulting reaction dynamics\nindicates a strong influence of hadronic rescattering on the space-time pattern\nof hadronic freeze-out and on the shape of transverse mass spectra.
