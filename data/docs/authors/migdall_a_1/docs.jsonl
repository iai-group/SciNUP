A matrix product state (MPS)\nalgorithm for a typical instance of the DQC1 system requires exponential\nclassical resources. This exposes a gap between the amount of entanglement and\nthe amount of purely nonclassical correlations in a quantum system. This gap, I\nsuggest, can be filled by quantum discord.

At the fundamental physical\nlevel, it is a network of two body interactions, each the input-output\ntransformation of a universal Boolean gate. Thus, it cannot process together at\nthe same time more than the three bit input of this gate - many such gates in\nparallel do not count since the information is not processed together. Quantum\ncomputation satisfies the requirement. At the light of our recent explanation\nof the speed up, quantum measurement of the solution of the problem is\nanalogous to a many body interaction between the parts of a perfect classical\nmachine, whose mechanical constraints represent the problem to be solved.

For channels of\nnonzero capacity, this simulation is always possible, but for it to be\nefficient, auxiliary resources of the proper kind and amount are generally\nrequired. In the classical case, shared randomness between sender and receiver\nis a sufficient auxiliary resource, regardless of the nature of the source, but\nin the quantum case the requisite auxiliary resources for efficient simulation\ndepend on both the channel being simulated, and the source from which the\nchannel inputs are coming.

A 83, 052114 (2011)], where we used a gauge-invariant\nform of the multicomponent WKB wave-functions to derive asymptotic formulas for\nthe $9j$ symbol with small and large angular momenta. When applying the same\ntechnique to the $12j$ symbol in this paper, we find that the spinor is\ndiagonalized in the direction of an intermediate angular momentum. In addition,\nwe find that the geometry of the derived asymptotic formula for the $12j$\nsymbol is expressed in terms of the vector diagram for a $9j$ symbol. This\nillustrates a general geometric connection between asymptotic limits of the\nvarious $3nj$ symbols. This work contributes the first known asymptotic formula\nfor the $12j$ symbol to the quantum theory of angular momentum, and serves as a\nbasis for finding asymptotic formulas for the Wigner $15j$ symbol with two\nsmall angular momenta. \n\n"}

For\nthis reason, the quantum simulation of spin Hamiltonians using the tools of\natomic and molecular physics has become very active over the last years, using\nultracold atoms or molecules in optical lattices, or trapped ions.

The probabilistic Born\nrule gives it an ensemble interpretation, predicting proportions of various\noutcomes over many experimental runs. Understanding gradual weak measurements\nrequires replacing this scenario with a dynamical evolution equation for the\ncollapse of the quantum state in individual experimental runs. We revisit the\nquantum trajectory framework that models quantum measurement as a continuous\nnonlinear stochastic process. We describe the ensemble of quantum trajectories\nas noise fluctuations on top of geodesics that attract the quantum state\ntowards the measured operator eigenstates. Investigation of the restrictions\nneeded on the ensemble of quantum trajectories, so as to reproduce projective\nmeasurement in the appropriate limit, shows that the Born rule follows when the\nmagnitudes of the noise and the attraction are precisely related, in a manner\nreminiscent of the fluctuation-dissipation relation.

Although simple, the resulting local master equation (LME) is known to\nbe thermodynamically inconsistent. Otherwise, one may always obtain a\nconsistent \\textit{global} master equation (GME) by working on the energy basis\nof the full interacting Hamiltonian. Here, we consider a two-node `quantum\nwire' connected to two heat baths. The stationary solution of the LME and GME\nare obtained and benchmarked against the exact result.

However, quantum mechanically there are at least two notions\nof information gathering which can be considered, one characterizing the\ninformation provided about the initial preparation, useful in communication,\nand the other characterizing the information about the final state, useful in\nstate-preparation and control. Here we are interested in understanding the\nproperties of these measures, and the information gathering capacities of\nquantum and classical measurements. We provide a partial answer to the question\n`in what sense does information gain increase with initial uncertainty?' by\nshowing that, for classical and quantum measurements which are symmetric with\nrespect to reversible transformations of the state space, the information gain\nregarding the initial state always increases with the observer's initial\nuncertainty. In addition, we calculate the capacity of all unitarily covariant\nand commutative permutation-symmetric measurements for obtaining classical\ninformation.

This arises\nnaturally in the context of ensemble quantum information processing such as in\nliquid NMR. We discuss how a SSR for the symmetric group can be applied, and\nshow how the extractable entanglement can be calculated analytically in certain\ncases, with a maximum bipartite entanglement in an ensemble of N Bell-state\npairs scaling as log(N) as N goes to infinity . We discuss the apparent\ndisparity with the asymptotic (N >> 1) recovery of unconstrained entanglement\nfor other sorts of superselection rules, and show that the disparity disappears\nwhen the correct notion of applying the symmetric group SSR to multiple copies\nis used. Next we discuss reference frames in the context of this SSR, showing\nthe relation to the work of von Korff and Kempe [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 260502\n(2004)]. The action of a reference frame can be regarded as the analog of\nactivation in mixed-state entanglement.

We find that there is initially a phase of very fast generation and\nspread of entanglement. At the end of this phase the entanglement is typically\nmaximal. In previous work we proved that the maximal entanglement is reached to\na fixed arbitrary accuracy within $O(N^3)$ steps, where $N$ is the total number\nof qubits. Here we provide a detailed and more pedagogical proof. We\ndemonstrate that one can use the so-called stabilizer gates to simulate this\nprocess efficiently on a classical computer. Furthermore, we discuss three ways\nof identifying the transition from the phase of rapid spread of entanglement to\nthe stationary phase: (i) the time when saturation of the maximal entanglement\nis achieved, (ii) the cut-off moment, when the entanglement probability\ndistribution is practically stationary, and (iii) the moment block entanglement\nscales exhibits volume scaling.

The Representation of\n  Physical Quantities With Arrows Abstract: This paper is the third in a series whose goal is to develop a fundamentally\nnew way of viewing theories of physics. Our basic contention is that\nconstructing a theory of physics is equivalent to finding a representation in a\ntopos of a certain formal language that is attached to the system. In paper II,\nwe studied the topos representations of the propositional language PL(S) for\nthe case of quantum theory, and in the present paper we do the same thing for\nthe, more extensive, local language L(S). One of the main achievements is to\nfind a topos representation for self-adjoint operators. This involves showing\nthat, for any physical quantity A, there is an arrow\n$\\breve{\\delta}^o(A):\\Sig\\map\\SR$, where $\\SR$ is the quantity-value object for\nthis theory. The construction of $\\breve{\\delta}^o(A)$ is an extension of the\ndaseinisation of projection operators that was discussed in paper II. The\nobject $\\SR$ is a monoid-object only in the topos, $\\tau_\\phi$, of the theory,\nand to enhance the applicability of the formalism, we apply to $\\SR$ a topos\nanalogue of the Grothendieck extension of a monoid to a group.

It is shown how the decoherence functional of\na closed quantum system may be regarded as an Hermitian form on the space of\nlinear operators on the Hilbert space of the system. This identification makes\nmanifest a number of structural properties of decoherence functionals. For\nexample, a bound on the maximum number of histories in a consistent set is\ndetermined. When the decoherence functional is positive -- as in conventional\nquantum mechanics -- it defines a semi-inner product on the space of history\noperators. This shows that consistent sets of histories are just orthogonal\nsets in this inner product.

Our exact\nresults also demonstrate in an unambiguous way that the pointer states in this\nmeasurement model emerge independent of the initial state of the apparatus. \n\n"}

However a prior knowledge of the\nSchmidt coefficients is required. The first method is optimally efficient only\nwhen a finite ensemble of pure entangled states are available whereas the\nsecond method realizes the single pair optimal concentration probability. We\nalso propose an entanglement assisted method which is again optimally efficient\neven for a single pair. We also discuss concentrating entanglement from\nN-partite cat like states. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/9911054", "contents": "Title: Security Aspects of Practical Quantum Cryptography Abstract: The use of quantum bits (qubits) in cryptography holds the promise of secure\ncryptographic quantum key distribution schemes. Unfortunately, the implemented\nschemes can be totally insecure. We provide a thorough investigation of\nsecurity issues for practical quantum key distribution, taking into account\nchannel losses, a realistic detection process, and modifications of the\n``qubits'' sent from the sender to the receiver. We first show that even\nquantum key distribution with perfect qubits cannot be achieved over long\ndistances when fixed channel losses and fixed dark count errors are taken into\naccount. Then we show that existing experimental schemes (based on\n``weak-pulse'') are usually totally insecure. Finally we show that parametric\ndownconversion offers enhanced performance compared to its weak coherent pulse\ncounterpart. \n\n"}
