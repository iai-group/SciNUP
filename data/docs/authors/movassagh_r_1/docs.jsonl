We generate 84 statistically independent maps on a 7.2\ndegree field of view, which we use to derive basic statistical estimators such\nas the one-point distribution and two-point correlation functions.

There is room\nfor other types of searches based on different models. Our objective is to fill\nthis gap. More specifically, we are interested in GW chirps with an arbitrary\nphase/frequency vs. time evolution. These unmodeled GW chirps may be considered\nas the generic signature of orbiting/spinning sources. We expect quasi-periodic\nnature of the waveform to be preserved independent of the physics which governs\nthe source motion. Several methods have been introduced to address the\ndetection of unmodeled chirps using the data of a single detector.

Specifically, we assume that the stabilizer\ngroup of a code (the gauge group for subsystem codes) can be generated by local\nPauli operators such that the support of any generator is bounded by a\nhypercube of constant size. Our first result concerns the optimal scaling of\nthe distance $d$ with the linear size of the lattice $L$. We prove an upper\nbound $d=O(L^{D-1})$ which is tight for D=1,2. This bound applies to both\nsubspace and subsystem stabilizer codes. Secondly, we analyze the suitability\nof stabilizer codes for building a self-correcting quantum memory. Any\nstabilizer code with geometrically local generators can be naturally\ntransformed to a local Hamiltonian penalizing states that violate the\nstabilizer condition. A degenerate ground-state of this Hamiltonian corresponds\nto the logical subspace of the code. We prove that for D=1,2 the height of the\nenergy barrier separating different logical states is upper bounded by a\nconstant independent of the lattice size L. The same result holds if there are\nunused logical qubits that are treated as \"gauge qubits\". It demonstrates that\na self-correcting quantum memory cannot be built using stabilizer codes in\ndimensions D=1,2. This result is in sharp contrast with the existence of a\nclassical self-correcting memory in the form of a two-dimensional ferromagnet.\nOur results leave open the possibility for a self-correcting quantum memory\nbased on 2D subsystem codes or on 3D subspace or subsystem codes. \n\n"}

In 14 outbursts from 11 different sources we find\nthat in every case the peak radio flux, on occasion directly resolved into\ndiscrete relativistic ejections, is associated with the bright hard to soft\nstate transition near the peak of the outburst. We also note the association of\nthe radio flaring with periods of X-ray flaring during this transition in most,\nbut not all, of the systems.

It is only when coin flipping is supplemented with quantum\ncommunication that this problem can be alleviated, although partial bias\nremains. Unfortunately, practical systems are subject to loss of quantum data,\nwhich restores complete or nearly complete bias in previous protocols.

In our main result, we prove the existence and\nuniqueness of a log-concave density that minimises the Kullback--Leibler\ndivergence from the true density over the class all log-concave densities, and\nalso show that the log-concave maximum likelihood estimator converges almost\nsurely in these exponentially weighted total variation norms to this minimiser.\nIn the case of a correctly specified model, this demonstrates a strong type of\nconsistency for the estimator; in a misspecified model, it shows that the\nestimator converges to the log-concave density that is closest in the\nKullback--Leibler sense to the true density. \n\n"}

The observations in the UV are one of the\nearliest of a Type IIb supernova (SN). On approximately day four after the\nexplosion, a dramatic upturn in the u and uvw1 (lambda_c = 2600 Angstroms)\nlight curves occurred after an initial rapid decline which is attributed to\nadiabatic cooling after the initial shock breakout. This rapid decline and\nupturn is reminiscent of the Type IIb SN 1993J on day six after the explosion.\nOptical/near-IR spectra taken around the peak reveal prominent H-alpha, HeI,\nand CaII absorption lines. A fading X-ray source is also located at the\nposition of SN 2008ax, implying an interaction of the SN shock with the\nsurrounding circumstellar material and a mass-loss rate of the progenitor of\nM_dot = (9+/-3)x10^-6 solar masses per year.

We extend the formalism derived for obtaining stellar $p$-\nand $g$-mode amplitudes (Samadi & Goupil 2001, Belkacem et al. 2008) to include\nthe effect of the Coriolis acceleration. We then study the special case of\nuniform rotation for slowly rotating stars by performing a perturbative\nanalysis. This allows us to consider the cases of the Sun and the CoRoT target\nHD 49933. We find that, in the subsonic regime, the influence of rotation as a\ndirect contribution to mode driving is negligible in front of the Reynolds\nstress contribution. In slow rotators, the indirect effect of the modification\nof the eigenfunctions on mode excitation is investigated by performing a\nperturbative analysis of the excitation rates. It turns out that the excitation\nof solar $p$ modes is affected by rotation with excitation rates asymmetries\nbetween prograde and retrograde modes of the order of several percents. Solar\nlow-order $g$ modes are also affected by uniform rotation and their excitation\nrates asymmetries are found to reach up to 10 %. The CoRoT target HD 49933 is\nrotating faster than the Sun ($\\Omega / \\Omega_\\odot \\approx 8$) and we show\nthat the resulting excitation rates asymmetry is about 10 % for the excitation\nrates of $p$ modes.

The limit distributions\nhave novel structures such that they are inverted-bell shaped and the supports\nof them are bounded.

Inspired by the two\nimportant works in 2009 and in 1929, we have noted that a condition we call\n\"thermodynamic normality\" for a macroscopic observable guarantees the approach\nto equilibrium (in the sense that a measurement of the observable at time $t$\nalmost certainly yields a result close to the corresponding microcanonical\naverage for a sufficiently long and typical $t$). A crucial point is that we\nmake no assumptions on the initial state of the system, except that its energy\nis distributed close to a certain macroscopic value. We also present three\n(rather artificial) models in which the thermodynamic normality can be\nestablished, thus providing concrete examples in which the approach to\nequilibrium is rigorously justified.

We test whether BCGs\nfollow claimed relations between cluster populations and their hosts, such as\nthe the fraction of the total luminosity contributed by the clusters as\nfunction of the mean star formation rate density; the $V$ band luminosity of\nthe brightest youngest cluster as related to the mean host star formation rate;\nand the cluster formation efficiency (i.e., the fraction of star formation\nhappening in star clusters) versus the density of the SFR. We find that BCGs\nfollow the trends, supporting a scenario where cluster formation and\nenvironmental properties of the host are correlated. They occupy, in all the\ndiagrams, the regions of higher SFRs, as expected by the extreme nature of the\nstarbursts operating in these systems. We find that the star clusters\ncontribute almost to the 20 % of the UV luminosity of the hosts. We suggest\nthat the BCG starburst environment has most likely favoured the compression and\ncollapse of the giant molecular clouds, enhancing the local star formation\nefficiency, so that massive clusters have been formed.

While one of them was clearly caused by stellar activity from the\nsecondary late-type main-sequence star, our analysis indicated that the white\ndwarf primary star is potentially the origin of the second component. However,\nthe low resolution of the data means that our interpretation remains ambiguous.\nWe here use time-series UVES data to compare the radial velocities of the\nHalpha emission components to those of metal absorption lines from the primary\nand secondary stars. We find that the weaker component most certainly\noriginates in the white dwarf and is probably caused by accretion. An abundance\nanalysis of the white dwarf spectrum yields accretion rates that are consistent\nwith mass loss from the secondary due to a stellar wind. The second and\nstronger Halpha component is attributed to stellar activity on the secondary\nstar. An active secondary is likely to be present because of the occurrence of\na flare in our time-resolved spectroscopy. Furthermore, Roche tomography\nindicates that a significant area of the secondary star on its leading side and\nclose to the first Lagrange point is covered by star spots. Finally, we derive\nthe parameters for the system and place it in an evolutionary context. We find\nthat the white dwarf is a very slow rotator, suggesting that it has had an\nangular-momentum evolution similar to that of field white dwarfs. We predict\nthat LTT 560 will begin mass transfer via Roche-lobe overflow in about 3.5\nGyrs, and conclude that the system is representative of the progenitors of the\ncurrent population of cataclysmic variables.

For photonuclear reactions with a narrow gamma beam, the\nenergy deposition in the target can be reduced by using a stack of thin target\nwires, hence avoiding direct stopping of the Compton electrons and e^+e^-\npairs. The well-defined initial excitation energy of the compound nucleus leads\nto a small number of reaction channels and enables new combinations of target\nisotope and final radioisotope. The narrow-bandwidth gamma excitation may make\nuse of collective resonances in gamma-width, leading to increased cross\nsections. (gamma,gamma') isomer production via specially selected gamma\ncascades allows to produce high specific activity in multiple excitations,\nwhere no back-pumping of the isomer to the ground state occurs. The produced\nisotopes will open the way for completely new clinical applications of\nradioisotopes. For example ^195mPt could be used to verify the patient's\nresponse to chemotherapy with platinum compounds before a complete treatment is\nperformed. In targeted radionuclide therapy the short-range Auger and\nconversion electrons of ^195mPt and ^117mSn enable a very local treatment. The\ngenerator ^44Ti allows for a PET with an additional gamma-quantum (gamma-PET),\nresulting in a reduced dose or better spatial resolution. \n\n"}

The combination of topology\nand superconducting order inverts the action of time-reversal symmetry, so that\nextrinsic time-reversal invariant surface perturbations appear only as\n\"pseudomagnetic\" fields (abelian and non-abelian vector potentials, which\ncouple to spin and valley currents). The main effect of disorder is to induce\nmultifractal scaling in surface state wavefunctions. These critically\ndelocalized, yet strongly inhomogeneous states renormalize interaction matrix\nelements relative to the clean system. We compute the enhancement or\nsuppression of interaction scaling dimensions due to the disorder exactly,\nusing conformal field theory.

An\ninterpretation of such a function as the energy of a classical system allows us\nto reduce the optimization problem into the preparation of a low-temperature\nthermal state of the system. Motivated by the quantum annealing method, we\npresent three strategies to prepare the low-temperature state that exploit\nquantum mechanics in remarkable ways. We focus on implementations without\nuncontrolled errors induced by the environment. This allows us to rigorously\nprove a quantum advantage. The first strategy uses a classical-to-quantum\nmapping, where the equilibrium properties of a classical system in $d$ spatial\ndimensions can be determined from the ground state properties of a quantum\nsystem also in $d$ spatial dimensions. We show how such a ground state can be\nprepared by means of quantum annealing, including quantum adiabatic evolutions.\nThis mapping also allows us to unveil some fundamental relations between\nsimulated and quantum annealing. The second strategy builds upon the first one\nand introduces a technique called spectral gap amplification to reduce the time\nrequired to prepare the same quantum state adiabatically. If implemented on a\nquantum device that exploits quantum coherence, this strategy leads to a\nquadratic improvement in complexity over the well-known bound of the classical\nsimulated annealing method. The third strategy is not purely adiabatic;\ninstead, it exploits diabatic processes between the low-energy states of the\ncorresponding quantum system. For some problems it results in an exponential\nspeedup (in the oracle model) over the best classical algorithms. \n\n"}

This\nquestion is at the heart of solid state NMR. There, an initially local\npolarization spreads all over due to spin-spin interactions that conserve the\ntotal spin projection, leading to an equilibration of the polarization. In\nprinciple, this quantum dynamics can be reversed by changing the sign of the\nHamiltonian.

The energy release and particle acceleration during\nreconnection have been proposed as a mechanism for producing high-energy\nemissions and cosmic rays. We carry out two- and three-dimensional kinetic\nsimulations to investigate relativistic magnetic reconnection and the\nassociated particle acceleration. The simulations focus on electron-positron\nplasmas starting with a magnetically dominated, force-free current sheet\n($\\sigma \\equiv B^2/(4\\pi n_e m_e c^2) \\gg 1$). For this limit, we demonstrate\nthat relativistic reconnection is highly efficient at accelerating particles\nthrough a first-order Fermi process accomplished by the curvature drift of\nparticles along the electric field induced by the relativistic flows. This\nmechanism gives rise to the formation of hard power-law spectra $f \\propto\n(\\gamma-1)^{-p}$ and approaches $p = 1$ for sufficiently large $\\sigma$ and\nsystem size. Eventually most of the available magnetic free energy is converted\ninto nonthermal particle kinetic energy.

One of the main difficulties is to\ncapture a suitable notion of work that models realistically the purpose of\nquantum machines, in an analogous way to the role played, for macroscopic\nmachines, by the energy stored in the idealisation of a lifted weight. Despite\nof several attempts to resolve this issue by putting forward specific models,\nthese are far from capturing realistically the transitions that a quantum\nmachine is expected to perform. In this work, we adopt a novel strategy by\nconsidering arbitrary kinds of systems that one can attach to a quantum thermal\nmachine and seeking for work quantifiers. These are functions that measure the\nvalue of a transition and generalise the concept of work beyond the model of a\nlifted weight.

In particular, recent\nadvances in adversary technology pose Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) which\nmay stealthily and completely compromise a cyber system. In this paper, we\ndesign a framework for the security of cloud-based systems that specifies when\na device should trust commands from the cloud which may be compromised. This\ninteraction can be considered as a game between three players: a cloud\ndefender/administrator, an attacker, and a device. We use traditional signaling\ngames to model the interaction between the cloud and the device, and we use the\nrecently proposed FlipIt game to model the struggle between the defender and\nattacker for control of the cloud. Because attacks upon the cloud can occur\nwithout knowledge of the defender, we assume that strategies in both games are\npicked according to prior commitment. This framework requires a new equilibrium\nconcept, which we call Gestalt Equilibrium, a fixed-point that expresses the\ninterdependence of the signaling and FlipIt games.

This class of operations is widely known\nas local operations and classical communication (LOCC).

Knabe proved\nthat if the local gap is larger than the threshold value $1/(n-1)$ for some\n$n>2$, then the global gap is lower bounded by a positive constant in the\nthermodynamic limit $m\\rightarrow \\infty$.

Accretion of matter onto\nremnants of Population III stars leading to SMBHs is a very slow process, and\ntherefore, such models encounter difficulties in explaining quasars detected at\n$ z \\gtrsim 6$. In this paper, we invoke collapse of dark bosonic halo matter,\nexisting initially in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) phase, to\nlead to formation of SMBH.

If\nthe condensate, made up of identical dark bosons of mass $m$, collapses to form\na black hole of mass $M_{eff}$ as soon as the former's effective size shrinks\nbelow the corresponding Schwarzschild radius, a simple inequality $ m \\ M_{eff}\n\\gtrsim 0.64 \\ m^2_{Pl} $ can be derived, that ensues from a competition\nbetween attractive self-gravity and quantum repulsion arising due to\nuncertainty principle.

The protecting Hamiltonian is chosen such that its degenerate\nground subspace is an error detecting code for the errors caused by the\ninteraction with the environment. We consider environments with arbitrary\nnumber of local sites, e.g. spins, whose interactions among themselves are\nlocal and bounded. Then, assuming the system is interacting with a finite\nnumber of sites in the environment, we prove that, up to second order with\nrespect to the coupling constant, decoherence and relaxation are suppressed by\na factor which grows exponentially fast with the ratio of energy penalty to the\nnorm of local interactions in the environment. The state may, however, still\nevolve unitarily inside the code subspace due to the Lamb shift effect. In the\ncontext of adiabatic quantum computation, this means that the evolution inside\nthe code subspace is effectively governed by a renormalized Hamiltonian. The\nresult is derived from first principles, without use of master equations or\ntheir assumptions, and holds even in the infinite temperature limit. We also\nprove that unbounded or non-local interactions in the environment at sites far\nfrom the system do not considerably modify the exponential suppression.

In this\npaper, we consider a more realistic one-clean qubit model, where the clean\nqubit is not clean, but depolarized. We first show that, for any polarization,\na multiplicative-error calculation of the output probability distribution of\nthe model is possible in a classical polynomial time if we take an\nappropriately large multiplicative error. The result is in a strong contrast to\nthat of the ideal one-clean qubit model where the classical efficient\nmultiplicative-error calculation (or even the sampling) with the same amount of\nerror causes the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. We next show that, for\nany polarization lower-bounded by an inverse polynomial, a classical efficient\nsampling (in terms of a sufficiently small multiplicative error or an\nexponentially-small additive error) of the output probability distribution of\nthe model is impossible unless BQP is contained in the second level of the\npolynomial hierarchy, which suggests the hardness of the classical efficient\nsimulation of the one non-clean qubit model. \n\n"}

First, we study the\nhardness of sampling the output distribution of a random quantum circuit, along\nthe lines of a recent proposal by the the Quantum AI group at Google. We show\nthat there's a natural hardness assumption, which has nothing to do with\nsampling, yet implies that no efficient classical algorithm can pass a\nstatistical test that the quantum sampling procedure's outputs do pass.\nCompared to previous work, the central advantage is that we can now talk\ndirectly about the observed outputs, rather than about the distribution being\nsampled. Second, in an attempt to refute our hardness assumption, we give a new\nalgorithm, for simulating a general quantum circuit with n qubits and m gates\nin polynomial space and m^O(n) time. We then discuss why this and other known\nalgorithms fail to refute our assumption.

Abstract: Randomness is an essential tool in many disciplines of modern sciences, such\nas cryptography, black hole physics, random matrix theory and Monte Carlo\nsampling. In quantum systems, random operations can be obtained via random\ncircuits thanks to so-called q-designs, and play a central role in the fast\nscrambling conjecture for black holes. Here we consider a more physically\nmotivated way of generating random evolutions by exploiting the many-body\ndynamics of a quantum system driven with stochastic external pulses. We combine\ntechniques from quantum control, open quantum systems and exactly solvable\nmodels (via the Bethe-Ansatz) to generate Haar-uniform random operations in\ndriven many-body systems. We show that any fully controllable system converges\nto a unitary q-design in the long-time limit. Moreover, we study the\nconvergence time of a driven spin chain by mapping its random evolution into a\nsemigroup with an integrable Liouvillean and finding its gap. Remarkably, we\nfind via Bethe-Ansatz techniques that the gap is independent of q.

Here, we consider a two-node `quantum\nwire' connected to two heat baths. The stationary solution of the LME and GME\nare obtained and benchmarked against the exact result. Importantly, in our\nmodel, the validity of the GME is constrained by the underlying secular\napproximation. Whenever this breaks down (for resonant weakly-coupled nodes),\nwe observe that the LME, in spite of being thermodynamically flawed: (a)\npredicts the correct steady state, (b) yields the exact asymptotic heat\ncurrents, and (c) reliably reflects the correlations between the nodes. In\ncontrast, the GME fails at all three tasks. Nonetheless, as the inter-node\ncoupling grows, the LME breaks down whilst the GME becomes correct. Hence, the\nglobal and local approach may be viewed as \\textit{complementary} tools, best\nsuited to different parameter regimes. \n\n"}

However,\nthis task is very challenging due to ambiguous cardiac borders and large\nanatomical variations among different subjects. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel densely-connected volumetric convolutional neural network, referred as\nDenseVoxNet, to automatically segment the cardiac and vascular structures from\n3D cardiac MR images. The DenseVoxNet adopts the 3D fully convolutional\narchitecture for effective volume-to-volume prediction. From the learning\nperspective, our DenseVoxNet has three compelling advantages. First, it\npreserves the maximum information flow between layers by a densely-connected\nmechanism and hence eases the network training. Second, it avoids learning\nredundant feature maps by encouraging feature reuse and hence requires fewer\nparameters to achieve high performance, which is essential for medical\napplications with limited training data.

We\nresolve this conundrum by showing that all the bulk actions that produce\nanomalous dimensions for the conserved current generate non-local actions at\nthe boundary. In particular, the Maxwell equations are fractional.

The radiative, three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations were then\npost-processed with RADMC3D and the ALMA Observation Simulator. We found that\neven though the CPDs are too small to be resolved, they are hot due to the\naccreting planet in the optically thick limit, therefore the best chance to\ndetect them with continuum observations in this case is at the shortest ALMA\nwavelengths, such as Band 9 (440 microns). Similar fluxes were found in the\ncase of Saturn and Jupiter-mass planets, as for the 10 $\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$\ngas-giant, due to temperature weighted optical depth effects: when no deep gap\nis carved, the planet region is blanketed by the optically thick circumstellar\ndisk leading to a less efficient cooling there.

Abstract: Quantum computational supremacy arguments, which describe a way for a quantum\ncomputer to perform a task that cannot also be done by a classical computer,\ntypically require some sort of computational assumption related to the\nlimitations of classical computation. One common assumption is that the\npolynomial hierarchy (PH) does not collapse, a stronger version of the\nstatement that P $\\neq$ NP, which leads to the conclusion that any classical\nsimulation of certain families of quantum circuits requires time scaling worse\nthan any polynomial in the size of the circuits. However, the asymptotic nature\nof this conclusion prevents us from calculating exactly how many qubits these\nquantum circuits must have for their classical simulation to be intractable on\nmodern classical supercomputers. We refine these quantum computational\nsupremacy arguments and perform such a calculation by imposing fine-grained\nversions of the non-collapse assumption. Each version is parameterized by a\nconstant $a$ and asserts that certain specific computational problems with\ninput size $n$ require $2^{an}$ time steps to be solved by a non-deterministic\nalgorithm.

LSTM transforms the input and the previous\nhidden states to the next states with the affine transformation, multiplication\noperations and a nonlinear activation function, which makes a good data\nrepresentation for a given task. The affine transformation includes rotation\nand reflection, which change the semantic or syntactic information of\ndimensions in the hidden states. However, considering that a model interprets\nthe output sequence of LSTM over the whole input sequence, the dimensions of\nthe states need to keep the same type of semantic or syntactic information\nregardless of the location in the sequence.

For numerical implementation the pricing of\nderivatives with Libor market models is mainly carried out with Monte Carlo\nsimulation.

The standard Monte Carlo method for American/Bermudan swaption\npricing more or less uses regression to estimate expected value as a linear\ncombination of basis functions (Longstaff and Schwartz). However, Monte Carlo\nmethod only provides the lower bound for American option price. Another\ncomplexity is the computation of the sensitivities of the option, the so-called\nGreeks, which are fundamental for a trader's hedging activity. Recently, an\nalternative numerical method based on deep learning and backward stochastic\ndifferential equations appeared in quite a few researches.

Previously, exact sampling from the outputs of even\nconstant-depth quantum circuits was known to be hard for classical computers\nunder the assumption that PH is infinite.

However, by\nemploying a Monte Carlo sampling of the measurement outcomes of the bath, we\ncan simulate the dynamics of the observable quantum field. In this work we\nconsider the measurement with respect to the coherent states, which yields the\nHusimi function as the positive (quasi)probability distribution of the\noutcomes. The evolution of dressed state which corresponds to a particular\nfixed outcome is called the dressed qauntum trajectory. Therefore, the Monte\nCarlo sampling of these trajectories yields a stochastic simulation method with\npromising convergence properties on wide time scales. \n\n"}

In particular, we study models harboring fracton order, both type-I\nand type-II, and compare the resulting ES with that of both conventional\ntopological order and of (strong) subsystem symmetry protected topological\n(SSPT) states. We find that non-local surface stabilizers (NLSS), a set of\nsymmetries of the Hamiltonian which form on the boundary of the entanglement\ncut, act as purveyors of universal non-local features appearing in the\nentanglement spectrum. While in conventional topological orders and fracton\norders, the NLSS retain a form of topological invariance with respect to the\nentanglement cut, subsystem symmetric systems---fracton and SSPT\nphases---additionally show a non-trivial geometric dependence on the\nentanglement cut, corresponding to the subsystem symmetry.

However, superimposed\non this \"standard model\" behavior we find significant chromatic variations\nwithin the first few hours after the burst. We consider possible reasons for\nthese variations, including the possibility that they are due to a dust echo.\nFinally, we constrain physical parameters that describe the afterglow and\nsurrounding medium for a variety of scenarios and find that GRB 021211's\nafterglow is faint for a combination of 3-4 reasons: (1) a low fraction of\nenergy in relativistic electrons, (2) a low density for the wind-swept medium,\nimplying either a low mass-loss rate and/or a high wind velocity for the\nprogenitor, (3) a wide opening/viewing angle for the jet, and possibly (4)\nmoderate source frame extinction. The jet appears to be significantly far from\nequipartition and magnetically dominated. More extreme versions of this might\nexplain the darkness of many afterglows in the Swift era. \n\n"}

A multiwavelength monitoring campaign was\nperformed in order to study its afterglow behavior. Aims. We present the\nanalysis of the early and late afterglow emission in both the X-ray and optical\nbands, as observed by Swift, a robotic telescope, and the VLT. We compare early\nobservations with late afterglow observations obtained with Swift and the VLT\nin different bands in order to constrain the density of the medium in which the\nfireball is expanding. Methods. We have analyzed both the X-ray and the optical\nlight curves and compared the spectral energy distribution of the afterglow at\ntwo different epochs. Results. We observed an intense rebrightening in the\noptical band at about one day after the burst which was not seen in the X-ray\nband. This is the first observation of a GRB afterglow in which a rebrightening\nis observed in the optical but not in the X-ray band. The lack of detection in\nX-ray of such a strong rebrightening at lower energies can be described with a\nvariable external density profile.

This is one\npossible signature of the approach to the general relativistic innermost stable\ncircular orbit (ISCO), but the implications of such an interpretation for\nstrong gravity and dense matter are important enough that it is essential to\nexplore alternate explanations. In this spirit, Mendez has recently proposed\nthat Q depends fundamentally on mass accretion rate (as measured by spectral\nhardness) rather than the frequency of the QPO. We test this hypothesis for\n4U1636-536 by measuring precisely spectral colors simultaneously with the lower\nQPO frequency and Q after correction for the frequency drift, over a data set\nspanning eight years of RXTE observations. We find that in this source there is\nno correlation between Q and spectral hardness. In particular, no apparent\nchanges in hardness are observed when Q reaches its maximum before dropping\noff. We perform a similar analysis on 4U1608-522; another source showing a\nsharp drop in the quality factor of its lower kHz QPO. We find that for this\nsource, positive and negative correlations are observed between spectral\nhardness, frequency and Q. Consequently, if we are to search for a common\nexplanation for the sharp drop in the quality factor seen in both sources, the\nspectral hardness is not a good candidate for the independent variable whereas\nthe frequency remains. Therefore, we conclude that the ISCO explanation is\nviable for 4U1636-536, and thus possibly for others. \n\n"}

In contrast, by incorporating into the ring geometry\na tunnel barrier that pins the Wigner crystal, the current is suppressed and\nits temperature dependence is drastically changed. The competition between two\ntemperature effects --- the reduced barrier height for macroscopic tunneling\nand loss of quantum coherence --- may result in a sharp peak in the temperature\ndependence. The character of the macroscopic quantum tunneling of a Wigner\ncrystal ring is dictated by the strength of pinning. At strong pinning the\ntunneling of a rigid Wigner crystal chain is highly inhomogeneous, and the\npersistent current has a well-defined peak at $T\\sim 0.5\\ \\hbar s/L$\nindependent of the barrier height ($s$ is the sound velocity of the Wigner\ncrystal, $L$ is the length of the ring).

These sectors, that must be discarded in the usual\nquantization due to divergences occurring when two eigenvalues coincide, can be\nconsistently kept if one modifies the action by introducing a coupling of the\nfield strength to the space-time curvature.

Rev. A \\textbf{73}, 012320 (2006)]. The\nconjecture states that a multipartite quantum state is separable if and only if\nthe degree matrix of the graph associated with the state is equal to the degree\nmatrix of the partial transpose of this graph. We call this statement to be the\nstrong form of the conjecture. In its weak version, the conjecture requires\nonly the necessity, that is, if the state is separable, the corresponding\ndegree matrices match. We prove the strong form of the conjecture for {\\it\npure} multipartite quantum states, using the modified tensor product of graphs\ndefined in [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. \\textbf{40}, 10251 (2007)], as both\nnecessary and sufficient condition for separability. Based on this proof, we\ngive a polynomial-time algorithm for completely factorizing any pure\nmultipartite quantum state. By polynomial-time algorithm we mean that the\nexecution time of this algorithm increases as a polynomial in $m,$ where $m$ is\nthe number of parts of the quantum system. We give a counter-example to show\nthat the conjecture fails, in general, even in its weak form, for multipartite\nmixed states. Finally, we prove this conjecture, in its weak form, for a class\nof multipartite mixed states, giving only a necessary condition for\nseparability. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0703145", "contents": "Title: Efficient atomic quantum memory for photonic qubits in cavity QED Abstract: We investigate a scheme of atomic quantum memory to store photonic qubits of\npolarization in cavity QED. It is observed that the quantum-state swapping\nbetween a single-photon pulse and a $ \\Lambda $-type atom can be made via\nscattering in an optical cavity [T. W. Chen, C. K. Law, P. T. Leung, Phys. Rev.\nA {\\bf 69} (2004) 063810]. This swapping operates limitedly in the strong\ncoupling regime for $ \\Lambda $-type atoms with equal dipole couplings. We\nextend this scheme in cavity QED to present a more feasible and efficient\nmethod for quantum memory combined with projective measurement. This method\nworks without requiring such a condition on the dipole couplings. The fidelity\nis significantly higher than that of the swapping, and even in the moderate\ncoupling regime it reaches almost unity by narrowing sufficiently the\nphoton-pulse spectrum. This high performance is rather unaffected by the atomic\nloss, cavity leakage or detunings, while a trade-off is paid in the success\nprobability for projective measurement. \n\n"}
