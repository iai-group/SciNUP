Quasiparticles at $\\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic\nvertex operators, $P_{\\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron\noperators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical\nto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function\nhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost\nidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\rm\nth}$ CF Landau level.

This progress is based mostly on a\nsuccessful isolation of the qubits from external decoherence sources. Under\nthese conditions the material-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial\nrole.

There is a shift in the chemical potential and\nin the position in energy of the Dirac point. Also, the DOS can be changed from\na linear dependence out of value zero at the Dirac point to quadratic out of a\nfinite value.

I propose that both effects take place in all\nsuperconductors, the first one in the presence of an applied magnetostatic\nfield, the second one even in the absence of applied external fields. Both\neffects can be understood under the assumption that electrons expand their\norbits and thereby lower their quantum kinetic energy in the transition to\nsuperconductivity. Associated with this process, the metal expels negative\ncharge from the interior to the surface and an electric field is generated in\nthe interior.

Initially prepared in a metastable paramagnetic state, it may\ntransit to its up or down ferromagnetic state, triggered by its coupling with\nthe tested spin, so that its magnetization acts as a pointer.\n  A detailed solution of the dynamical equations is worked out. Conditions are\nfound, which ensure that the process satisfies the features of ideal\nmeasurements. Various imperfections are discussed, as well as attempts of\nincompatible measurements. The first steps consist in the solution of the\nHamiltonian dynamics for the spin-apparatus density matrix $D(t)$. On a longer\ntime scale, the trend towards equilibrium of the magnet produces a final state\n$D(t_{\\rm f})$ that involves correlations between the system and the\nindications of the pointer, thus ensuring registration.

For\nsufficiently long SCs, there are zero energy Majorana modes at the junctions\nbetween the SCs and the leads,and, depending on the signs of the p-wave\npairings in the three SCs, there can also be one or three Majorana modes at the\njunction of the three SCs.

In this work we study how to induce\nlong-range transfer between the two ends of a dimer chain, by coupling states\nthat are localized just on the chain's end-points.

In\ncontrast, the model of[5] (BHZ2) with mixed boundary conditions for BHZ\nHamiltonian and the 2D tight-binding (TB) model from [4] yield weak\nnon-linearity. \n\n"}

On\nthe other hand, a disorder at the edge or magnetic adatoms may produce a dense\narray of localized spins interacting with the helical electrons. The spin\nsubsystem is magnetically frustrated since the indirect exchange favors\nformation of helical spin order and the direct one favors (anti)ferromagnetic\nordering of the spins.

It is proposed that a critical test of which theory is\ncorrect is the dependence of $T_c$ on hole doping: the hole mechanism predicts\nthat $T_c$ will drop rapidly to zero as holes are added, while the\nelectron-phonon mechanism appears to predict increasing $T_c$ for a substantial\nrange of hole doping. Furthermore, the hole mechanism and electron-phonon\nmechanism differ qualitatively in their predictions of the effect on $T_c$ of\nchange in the $B-B$ distances. We discuss predictions of the hole mechanism for\na variety of observables as a function of doping, emphasizing the expected\ndifferences and similarities with the electron-phonon explanation. The hole\nmechanism predicts coherence length and penetration depth to increase and\ndecrease monotonically with hole doping respectively. \n\n"}

Our\nmethod combines the properties of integrable scattering together with a\nLandauer-Buttiker formalism. Although we use integrability, the nature of the\nproblem is such that our results are not generically exact, but must only be\nconsidered as excellent approximations which nonetheless are valid all the way\nthrough crossover regimes.\n  The key to our approach is to identify the excitations that correspond to\nscattering states and then to compute their associated scattering amplitudes.\nWe are able to do so both in and out of equilibrium. In equilibrium and at zero\ntemperature, we reproduce the Friedel sum rule for an arbitrary magnetic field.\nAt finite temperature, we study the linear response conductance at the\nsymmetric point of the Anderson model, and reproduce Costi et al.'s numerical\nrenormalization group computation of this quantity. We then explore the\nout-of-equilibrium conductance for a near-symmetric Anderson model, and arrive\nat quantitative expressions for the differential conductance, both in and out\nof a magnetic field. We find the expected splitting of the differential\nconductance peak into two in a finite magnetic field, $H$. We determine the\nwidth, height, and position of these peaks.

{"id": "cond-mat/0604029", "contents": "Title: Inelastic tunneling effects on noise properties of molecular junctions Abstract: The effect of electron-phonon coupling on the current noise in a molecular\njunction is investigated within a simple model. The model comprises a 1-level\nbridge representing a molecular level that connects between two free electron\nreservoirs and is coupled to a vibrational degree of freedom representing a\nmolecular vibrational mode. The latter in turn is coupled to a phonon bath that\nrepresents the thermal environment. We focus on the zero frequency noise\nspectrum and study the changes in its behavior under weak and strong\nelectron-phonon interactions. In the weak coupling regime we find that the\nnoise amplitude can increase or decrease as a result of opening of an inelastic\nchannel, depending on distance from resonance and on junction asymmetry. In\nparticular the relative Fano factor decreases with increasing off resonance\ndistance and junction asymmetry. For resonant inelastic tunneling with strong\nelectron-phonon coupling the differential noise spectrum can show phonon\nsidebands in addition to a central feature. Such sidebands can be observed when\ndisplaying the noise against the source-drain voltage, but not in noise vs.\ngate voltage plots obtained at low source-drain bias. A striking crossover of\nthe central feature from double to single peak is found for increasing\nasymmetry in the molecule-leads coupling or increasing electron-phonon\ninteraction. These variations provide a potential diagnostic tool. A possible\nuse of noise data from scanning tunneling microscopy experiments for estimating\nthe magnitude of the electron-phonon interaction on the bridge is proposed. \n\n"}

We consider a wide range of both\nelectron number, N<=20, and electron gas parameter, r_s<18, using the diffusion\nquantum Monte Carlo technique. Features associated with correlation appear to\ndevelop very differently in quantum dots than in bulk. The main reason is that\ntranslational symmetry is necessarily broken in a dot, leading to density\nmodulation and inhomogeneity. Electron-electron interactions act to enhance\nthis modulation ultimately leading to localization. This process appears to be\ncompletely smooth and occurs over a wide range of density. Thus there is a\nbroad regime of ``incipient'' Wigner crystallization in these quantum dots.
