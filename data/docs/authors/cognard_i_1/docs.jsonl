Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance.

For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors).

Current models for the\nreionization of intergalactic hydrogen predict that overdense regions will be\nreionized early, thus delaying the build up of stellar mass in the progenitors\nof massive lower-redshift galaxies. As a result, the stellar populations\nobserved in intermediate redshift galaxies are somewhat younger and hence\nbrighter in overdense regions of the Universe. Galaxy surveys would therefore\nbe sensitive to galaxies with a somewhat lower dark matter mass in overdense\nregions. The corresponding increase in the observed number density of galaxies\ncan be parameterized as a galaxy bias due to reionization. We model this\nprocess using merger trees combined with a stellar synthesis code. Our model\ndemonstrates that reionization has a significant effect on the clustering\nproperties of galaxy samples that are selected based on their star-formation\nproperties. The bias correction in Lyman-break galaxies (including those in\nproposed baryonic oscillation surveys at z<1) is at the level of 10-20% for a\nhalo mass of 10^12 solar masses, leading to corrections factors of 1.5-2 in the\nhalo mass inferred from measurements of clustering length. The reionization of\nhelium could also lead to a sharp increase in the amplitude of the galaxy\ncorrelation function at z~3. We find that the reionization bias is\napproximately independent of scale and halo mass. However since the traditional\ngalaxy bias is mass dependent, the reionization bias becomes relatively more\nimportant for lower mass systems. The correction to the bias due to\nreionization is very small in surveys of luminous red galaxies at z<1. \n\n"}

The evolution of the star\nis dynamic and initially dominated by fast neutrino cooling. Nonlinear effects\nbecome important when the r-mode amplitude grows above its first parametric\ninstability threshold. The balance between neutrino cooling and viscous heating\nplays an important role in the evolution. Depending on the initial r-mode\namplitude, and on the strength of the viscosity and of the cooling this balance\ncan occur at different temperatures. If thermal equilibrium occurs on the\nr-mode stability curve, where gravitational driving equals viscous damping, the\nevolution may be adequately described by a one-mode model. Otherwise, nonlinear\neffects are important and lead to various more complicated scenarios.

The observed L/LEdd distribution based on virial BH masses is in\ngood agreement with that based on MBH-sigma only if radiation pressure effects\nare negligible, otherwise significant discrepancies are observed.

The origin of the radio emission is\nunclear,it could be due either to a jet, as in microquasars, or to the shock\nboundary between the Be star and a possible pulsar wind. We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before). We show that this result qualitatively\nand quantitatively agrees with the two-peak accretion/ejection model proposed\nin the past for LS I +61303. We conclude that the radio emission in LS I +61303\noriginates from a jet and suggest that the variable TeV emission comes from the\nusual Compton losses expected as an important by-product in the shock-in-jet\ntheory. \n\n"}

We\nderive an overall mass-to-light ratio of M_433/L=103^{+83}_{-48} M_sun/L_sun.\nOur mass estimate calls into question recent claims of a common mass scale for\ndSph galaxies.\n  Additionally, we find tentative evidence for a velocity gradient in our\nkinematic data of 16 +/- 3 km/s/kpc, and evidence of an asymmetric extension in\nthe light distribution at about 0.5 kpc.

At z=0, about 40% of\nthe baryons are in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), but most metals\n(80%-90%) are locked in stars. At higher z the proportion of metals in the IGM\nis higher due to more efficient loss from galaxies. The IGM metals primarily\nreside in the WHIM throughout cosmic history. The metallicity evolution of the\ngas inside galaxies is broadly consistent with observations, but the diffuse\nIGM is under enriched at z $\\sim$ 2.5. Galactic winds most efficiently enrich\nthe IGM for halos in the intermediate mass range $10^{10}$M$_{\\sun}$ -\n$10^{11}$ M$_{\\sun}$.

At the high mass end, the fraction of\nhalo baryons escaped as winds declines along with the decline of stellar mass\nfraction of the galaxies. This is likely because of the decrease in star\nformation activity and in wind escape efficiency. Metals enhance cooling which\nallows WHIM gas to cool onto galaxies and increases star formation. Metal\ndiffusion allows winds to mix prior to escape, decreasing the IGM metal content\nin favour of gas within galactic halos and star forming gas.

This amplification may be due to\nplasma instabilities driven by shock-accelerated cosmic rays (CRs). One\ncandidate is the cosmic ray current-driven (CRCD) instability (Bell 2004),\ncaused by the electric current of large Larmor radii CRs propagating parallel\nto the upstream magnetic field. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown\nthat the back-reaction of the amplified field on CRs would limit the\namplification factor of this instability to less than ~10 in galactic SNRs. In\nthis paper, we study the possibility of further amplification driven near\nshocks by \"magnetized\" CRs, whose Larmor radii are smaller than the length\nscale of the field that was previously amplified by the CRCD instability. We\nfind that additional amplification can occur due to a new instability, driven\nby the CR current perpendicular to the field, which we term the \"perpendicular\ncurrent-driven instability\" (PCDI).

Previous studies on the nHz GW background assumed that the inspiral\nis purely driven by GWs.

In terms of\nstellar structure, SN Ib/c progenitors in binary systems are predicted to have\na wide range of final masses even up to 7 Msun, with helium envelopes of 0.16 -\n1.5 Msun. Our results indicate that, if the lack of helium lines in the spectra\nof SNe Ic were due to small amounts of helium, the distribution of both initial\nand final masses of SN Ic progenitors should be bimodal. Furthermore, we find\nthat a thin hydrogen layer (0.001 - 0.01 Msun) is expected to be present in\nmany SN Ib progenitors at the presupernova stage. We show that the presence of\nhydrogen, together with a rather thick helium envelope, can lead to a\nsignificant expansion of some SN Ib/c progenitors by the time of supernova\nexplosion. This may have important consequences for the shock break-out and\nsupernova light curve. We also argue that some SN progenitors with thin\nhydrogen layers produced via Case AB/B transfer might be related to Type IIb\nsupernova progenitors with relatively small radii of about 10 Rsun. \n\n"}

Nuclear reactions in cosmic sites re-arrange\nthe basic constituents of atomic nuclei (neutrons and protons) among the\ndifferent configurations which are allowed by Nature, thus producing\nradioactive isotopes as a by-product. Throughout cosmic history, such reactions\noccur in different sites, and lead to rearrangements of the relative abundances\nof cosmic nuclei, a process called cosmic chemical evolution, which can be\nstudied through the observations of radioactivity. The special role of\nradioactivity in such studies is contributed by the intrinsic decay of such\nmaterial after it has been produced in cosmic sites.

This mapping prompted a number of\nnovel explanations, including rather \"exotic ones (e.g. dark matter\nannihilation). However, conventional astrophysical sources, like type Ia\nsupernovae, microquasars or X-ray binaries, are still plausible candidates for\na large fraction of the observed total 511 keV emission of the bulge. A closer\nstudy of the subject reveals new layers of complexity, since positrons may\npropagate far away from their production sites, making it difficult to infer\nthe underlying source distribution from the observed map of 511 keV emission.\nHowever, contrary to the rather well understood propagation of high energy\n(>GeV) particles of Galactic cosmic rays, understanding the propagation of low\nenergy (~MeV) positrons in the turbulent, magnetized interstellar medium, still\nremains a formidable challenge.

Assuming that the clusters have secure redshift estimates, we\nshow that the joint experiment enables a self-calibration of important\nsystematic errors including the source redshift uncertainty and the cluster\nmass-observable relation, by adopting a single population of background source\ngalaxies for the lensing analysis. It allows us to use the relative strengths\nof stacked lensing signals at different cluster redshifts for calibrating the\nsource redshift uncertainty, which in turn leads to accurate measurements of\nthe mean cluster mass in each bin. In addition, our formulation of stacked\nlensing signals in Fourier space simplifies the Fisher matrix calculations, as\nwell as the marginalization over the cluster off-centering effect, the most\nsignificant uncertainty in stacked lensing. We show that upcoming wide-field\nsurveys yield stringent constraints on cosmological parameters including dark\nenergy parameters, without any priors on nuisance parameters that model\nsystematic uncertainties. Specifically, the stacked lensing information\nimproves the dark energy FoM by a factor of 4, compared to that from the\ncluster observables alone. The primordial non-Gaussianity parameter can also be\nconstrained with a level of f_NL~10. In this method, the mean source redshift\nis well calibrated to an accuracy of 0.1 in redshift, and the mean cluster mass\nin each bin to 5-10% accuracies, which demonstrates the success of the\nself-calibration of systematic uncertainties from the joint experiment.\n(Abridged) \n\n"}

We develop the computational method based on that of\nBombelli et al to obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$ of scalar fields whose\nLagrangian is quadratic with respect to the scalar fields. First we study $S_C$\nin $d+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime.

Results: The\ntimescale for PAH destruction by cosmic ray ions depends on the electronic\nexcitation energy Eo and on the amount of energy available for dissociation.\nSmall PAHs are destroyed faster, with He and the CNO group being the more\neffective projectiles. For electron collisions, the lifetime is independent of\nthe PAH size and varies with the threshold energy To.

Using\naxisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations with a self-consistent treatment of the\ndynamical cosmic ray (CR) - gas interaction, we show that the bubbles can be\ncreated with a recent active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet activity about 1 - 3\nMyr ago, which was active for a duration of ~ 0.1 - 0.5 Myr. The bipolar jets\nwere ejected into the Galactic halo along the rotation axis of the Galaxy. Near\nthe GC, the jets must be moderately light with a typical density contrast 0.001\n<~ \\eta <~ 0.1 relative to the ambient hot gas. The jets are energetically\ndominated by kinetic energy, and over-pressured with either CR or thermal\npressure which induces lateral jet expansion, creating fat CR bubbles as\nobserved.

We have built a mixed\ndwarfs+clusters sample containing some of the most promising nearby dwarf\ngalaxies (Draco, Ursa Minor, Wilman 1 and Segue 1) and local galaxy clusters\n(Perseus, Coma, Ophiuchus, Virgo, Fornax, NGC5813 and NGC5846), and then\ncompute their DM annihilation flux profiles by making use of the latest\nmodeling of their DM density profiles. We also include in our calculations the\neffect of DM substructure. Willman 1 appears as the best candidate in the\nsample. However, its mass modeling is still rather uncertain, so probably other\ncandidates with less uncertainties and quite similar fluxes, namely Ursa Minor\nand Segue 1, might be better options. As for galaxy clusters, Virgo represents\nthe one with the highest flux. However, its large spatial extension can be a\nserious handicap for IACT observations and posterior data analysis.

We show that this delay is a natural consequence of a\nmagnetic dominated relativistic jet. The much slower acceleration of a magnetic\njet with radius (compared with a hot baryonic outflow) results in high energy\ngamma-ray photons to be converted to electron-positron pairs out to a larger\nradius whereas lower energy gamma-rays of energy less than ~10 MeV can escape\nwhen the jet crosses the Thomson-photosphere.

Here we further explore this\nscenario to study the potential roles of shear viscosity and cosmic ray (CR)\ndiffusion on the morphology and CR distribution of the bubbles. We show that\neven a relatively low level of viscosity (\\mu_{visc} >~ 3 g cm^{-1} s^{-1}, or\n~0.1% - 1% of Braginskii viscosity in this context) could effectively suppress\nthe development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at the bubble surface,\nresulting in smooth bubble edges as observed. Furthermore, viscosity reduces\ncirculating motions within the bubbles, which would otherwise mix the\nCR-carrying jet backflow near bubble edges with the bubble interior. Thus\nviscosity naturally produces an edge-favored CR distribution, an important\ningredient to produce the observed flat gamma-ray surface brightness\ndistribution.

The integrated pulse profiles of MSPs appear to be stable, which\nenables precision monitoring of the pulse times of arrival (TOAs). However, for\nindividual pulses the shape and arrival phase can vary dramatically, which is\nknown as pulse jitter. In this paper, we investigate the stability of\nintegrated pulse profiles for 5 MSPs, and estimate the amount of jitter for PSR\nJ0437-4715. We do not detect intrinsic profile shape variation based on\nintegration times from ~10 to ~100 s with the provided instrumental\nsensitivity.

We concentrate\non the production of cosmogenic UHE neutrinos in supernova explosions that\naccompany the death of Pop III stars. Accelerated protons produce neutrinos in\ncollisions with CMB photons. We deliberately use simplified assumptions which\nmake our results transparent. Pop III stars are assumed to be responsible for\nthe reionization of the universe as observed by WMAP. Since the evolution of\nPop III stars is much faster than the Hubble rate, we consider the burst of UHE\nproton production to occur at fixed redshift (z_b=10-20). We discuss the\nformation of collisionless shocks and particle acceleration in the early\nuniverse. The composition of accelerated particles is expected to be proton\ndominated. A simple calculation is presented to illustrate the fact that the\ndiffuse neutrinos flux from the bright phase burst is concentrated in a\nrelatively narrow range around $7.5 \\times 10^{15}(20/z_b)^2$ eV. The $\\nu_\\mu$\nflux may be detectable by IceCube without violating the cascade upper limit and\nthe expected energetics of SNe associated with Pop III stars. A possible\nsignature of the neutrino production from Pop III stars may be the detection of\nresonant neutrino events.

Two\nmechanisms are thought to contribute to the ejection of runaway stars, both\ninvolve binarity (or higher multiplicity). In the binary supernova scenario a\nrunaway star receives its velocity when its binary massive companion explodes\nas a supernova (SN). In the alternative dynamical ejection scenario, runaway\nstars are formed through gravitational interactions between stars and binaries\nin dense, compact clusters or cluster cores.

We make use of extensive N-body simulations of massive clusters, as\nwell as analytic arguments, in order to to characterize the expected ejection\nvelocity distribution of runaways stars. We find the ejection velocity\ndistribution of the fastest runaways (>~80 km s^-1) depends on the binary\ndistribution in the cluster, consistent with our analytic toy model, whereas\nthe distribution of lower velocity runaways appears independent of the binaries\nproperties. For a realistic log constant distribution of binary separations, we\nfind the velocity distribution to follow a simple power law; Gamma(v) goes like\nv^(-8/3) for the high velocity runaways and v^(-3/2) for the low velocity ones.\nWe calculate the total expected ejection rates of runaway stars from our\nsimulated massive clusters and explore their mass function and their binarity.\nThe mass function of runaway stars is biased towards high masses, and depends\nstrongly on their velocity. The binarity of runaways is a decreasing function\nof their ejection velocity, with no binaries expected to be ejected with v>150\nkm s^-1. We also find that hyper-runaways with velocities of hundreds of km\ns^-1 can be dynamically ejected from stellar clusters, but only at very low\nrates, which cannot account for a significant fraction of the observed\npopulation of hyper-velocity stars in the Galactic halo. \n\n"}

Abstract: Galaxy clusters are among the best targets for indirect dark matter detection\nin gamma-rays, despite the large astrophysical background expected from these\nobjects. Detection is now within reach of current observatories (Fermi-LAT or\nCerenkov telescopes); however, assessing the origin of this signal might be\ndifficult. We investigate whether the behaviour of the number of objects per\n`flux' bin (logN-logF) and that of the stacked signal could be used as a\nsignature of the dominant process at stake.We use the CLUMPY code to integrate\nthe signal from decaying or annihilating dark matter and cosmic rays along the\nline of sight. We assume the standard NFW profile for the dark matter density\nand rely on a parametrised emissivity for the cosmic-ray component. In this\ncontext, the consequences of stacking are explored using the MCXC\nmeta-catalogue of galaxy clusters. We find the value of the slope of the\nlogN-logF power law (or the increase of the signal with the number of stacked\nobjects) to be a clear diagnosis to disentangle decaying dark matter from\ncosmic-ray induced gamma-rays. For dark matter annihilation, depending on the\nsignal boost from the substructures, it is either similar to the cosmic-ray\nsignal (no boost) or similar to the decay case (large boosts). The shift\nbetween the brightest object and its followers also depends on the signal\norigin. For annihilation, this shift and the stacked signal are poorly\nconstrained because of the large uncertainty affecting the boost. We also\nunderline that the angular dependence of the annihilation signal is not\nuniversal because of the substructure contribution. \n\n"}

However, there is great uncertainty in how efficiently\nradiation couples to matter in these high optical depth environments. In\nparticular, it is unclear what levels of turbulence the radiation can produce,\nand whether the infrared radiation trapped by the dust opacity can give rise to\nheavily mass-loaded winds. In this paper we report a series of two-dimensional\nflux-limited diffusion radiation-hydrodynamics calculations performed with the\ncode ORION in which we drive strong radiation fluxes through columns of dusty\nmatter confined by gravity. We consider both systems where the radiation flux\nis sub-Eddington throughout the gas column, and where it is super-Eddington at\nthe midplane but sub-Eddington in the atmosphere. In the latter, we find that\nthe radiation-matter interaction gives rise to radiation-driven Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability, which drives supersonic turbulence at a level sufficient to fully\nexplain the turbulence seen in Galactic protocluster gas clouds, and to make a\nnon-trivial contribution to the turbulence observed in starburst galaxy disks.\nHowever, the instability also produces a channel structure in which the\nradiation-matter interaction is reduced because the radiation field is not\nfully trapped. For astrophysical parameters relevant to forming star clusters\nand starburst galaxies, we find that this effect reduces the net momentum\ndeposition rate in the dusty gas by a factor of ~2-6 compared to simple\nanalytic estimates, and that in steady state the Eddington ratio reaches unity\nand there are no strong winds.

In order to investigate\nthe effect of very strong magnetic field, we focus only on systems in which a\nmaximum of either one, two or three Landau level(s) is/are occupied. This is\nimportant since, if a very large number of Landau levels are filled, it implies\na very low magnetic field strength which yields back Chandrasekhar's celebrated\nnon-magnetic results. The maximum number of occupied Landau levels is fixed by\nthe correct choice of two parameters, namely the magnetic field strength and\nthe maximum Fermi energy of the system.

It is commonly assumed that the high ambient densities and\nintense radiation fields in galactic nuclei imply short cooling times, thus\nmaking the outflows momentum-conserving. We show that cooling of high-velocity,\nshocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances,\nincluding conditions relevant to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs),\nresulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast\nenergy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler\ngas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity\nv_in>~10,000 km s^-1, as observed in ultra-violet and X-ray absorption, the\nshocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal\npressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate\ndirectly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton\ncooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with v_in~1,000 km\ns^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience\nenergy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions.

For 14 UCXBs\nincluding two candidates, we investigate the long-term variability and average\nluminosity with the purpose of learning how often a source can be expected to\nbe visible above a given luminosity, and we compare the derived luminosities\nwith the theoretical predictions. Methods. We use data from the RXTE All-Sky\nMonitor because of its long-term, unbiased observations. Many UCXBs are faint,\ni.e., they have a count rate at the noise level for most of the time. Still,\ninformation can be extracted from the data, either by using only reliable data\npoints or by combining the bright-end variability behavior with the\ntime-averaged luminosity. Results. Luminosity probability distributions show\nthe fraction of time that a source emits above a given luminosity. All UCXBs\nshow significant variability and relatively similar behavior, though the\ntime-averaged luminosity implies higher variability in systems with a period\nlonger than 40 min. Conclusions. There is no large difference in the\nstatistical luminosity behavior of what we usually call persistent and\ntransient sources. UCXBs with a period below ~30 min have a time-averaged\nbolometric luminosity that is in reasonable agreement with estimates based on\nthe theoretical mass transfer rate. Around 40 min the lower bound on the\ntime-averaged luminosity is similar to the luminosity based on the theoretical\nmass transfer rate, suggesting these sources are indeed faint when not\ndetected. Above 50 min some systems are much brighter than the theoretical mass\ntransfer rate predicts, unless these systems have helium burning donors or lose\nadditional angular momentum. \n\n"}

This result has important theoretical and observational\nimplications. However, because of technical difficulties, the radial dynamic\nrange in almost all previous simulations usually spans at most two orders of\nmagnitude. This small dynamical range, combined with the effects of boundary\nconditions, makes the simulation results suspectable.

Given recent evidence of similar gamma-ray lines from the Inner\nGalaxy, it is tempting to interpret these unassociated sources as nearby dark\nmatter subhalos, powered by ongoing annihilations.

Although a few black holes have been\nseen in globular clusters around other galaxies, the masses of these cannot be\ndetermined, and some may be intermediate-mass black holes that form through\nexotic mechanisms. Here we report the presence of two flat-spectrum radio\nsources in the Milky Way globular cluster M22, and we argue that these objects\nare black holes of stellar mass (each ~ 10-20 times more massive than the Sun)\nthat are accreting matter.

For high but\nsub-critical eccentricities, all the stellar mass is accreted onto the black\nhole in a finite time, causing a significant deviation from the canonical\n$t^{-5/3}$ mass fallback rate. When a star is on a moderately eccentric orbit\nand its pericenter distance is deeply inside the tidal disruption radius, there\ncan be several orbit crossings of the debris streams due to relativistic\nprecession. This dissipates orbital energy in shocks, allowing for rapid\ncircularization of the debris streams and formation of an accretion disk. The\nresultant accretion rate greatly exceeds the Eddington rate and differs\nstrongly from the canonical rate of $t^{-5/3}$. By contrast, there is little\ndissipation due to orbital crossings for the equivalent simulation with a\npurely Newtonian potential. This shows that general relativistic precession is\ncrucial for accretion disk formation via circularization of stellar debris from\nstars on moderately eccentric orbits. \n\n"}

We find a strong temporal evolution of the\nmorphology in the HST images, from a roughly elliptical shape before ~5,000\ndays, to a more irregular, edge-brightened morphology thereafter. This\ntransition is a natural consequence of the change in the dominant energy source\npowering the ejecta, from radioactive decay before ~5,000 days to X-ray input\nfrom the circumstellar interaction thereafter. The [Si I]/[Fe II] images\ndisplay a more uniform morphology, which may be due to a remaining significant\ncontribution from radioactivity in the inner ejecta and the higher abundance of\nthese elements in the core.

The X-ray emission from the pulsar is consistent with a\nmagnetospheric non-thermal origin plus a thermal emission from a hot spot (or\nhot spots). The lack of a thermal component from the whole surface makes Morla\nthe coldest neutron star in its age range. We found marginal evidence for a\ndouble-peaked modulation of the X-ray emission. The study of the 9'-long tail\nconfirmed the lack of extended emission near the pulsar itself. The tail shows\na very asymmetric brightness profile and its spectrum lacks any spatial\nvariation. We found the nebular emission to be inconsistent with a classical\nbow-shock, ram-pressure dominated pulsar wind nebula. We propose thermal\nbremsstrahlung as an alternative mechanism for Morla's tail emission. In this\nscenario, the tail emission comes from the shocked interstellar medium (ISM)\nmaterial heated up to X-ray temperatures. This can fully explain the peculiar\nfeatures of the tail, assuming a hot, moderately dense interstellar medium\naround the pulsar.

Even though one\nmight expect a background composed of a high-redshift cosmological population\nof sources to be fairly isotropic, deviations from isotropy may be indicative\nof local GW hotspots or some form of continuous anisotropy in the\nangular-distribution of GW-power. A GWB induces time-of-arrival deviations in\npulsar signals which are correlated between separated pulsars. In an isotropic\nbackground this cross-correlation follows a distinctive relationship, known as\nthe Hellings and Downs curve, that depends only on the angular separation of\nthe pulsars.

Here we demonstrate that the scattering effects at lower\nradio frequencies are less than previously thought, and that the bursts could\nbe detectable at redshifts out to about $z=0.5$ in surveys below 1 GHz. Using a\nsource model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometric\nluminosities $\\sim 8 \\times 10^{44}$ ergs/s uniformly distributed per unit\ncomoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density as\na function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found by\nThornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate and\nredshift probed by a given survey. The non-detection of any such events in\nArecibo 1.4 GHz survey data by Deneva et al., and the Allen Telescope Array\nsurvey by Simeon et al. is consistent with our model.

One case of apparent vortical motions in prominence\nspines and barbs arises from the (mostly) 2D counterstreaming plasma motion\nalong the prominence spine and barbs together with oscillations along\nindividual threads. The other case of apparent rotational motion is observed in\nprominence cavities and results from the 3D plasma motion along the writhed\nmagnetic fields inside and along the prominence cavity as seen projected on the\nlimb. Thus, the \"tornado\" impression results either from counterstreaming and\noscillations or from the projection on the plane of the sky of plasma motion\nalong magnetic field lines, rather than from a true vortical motion around an\n(apparent) vertical or horizontal axis.

Using this model, the\nphase-averaged gamma-ray spectra are calculated and compared with the observed\nspectra of 37 MSPs given by the second {\\it Fermi}-LAT catalog of gamma-ray\npulsars, our results show that the {\\it Fermi}-LAT results can be well\nexplained by this model.

The search is based on\nthe peculiar properties of merging galaxies that are found in a mock galaxy\ncatalog from the Millennium Simulation. MBHBs are expected to be the main\ngravitational wave (GW) sources for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs); however, it is\nstill unclear if the observed GW signal will be produced by a few single MBHBs,\nor if it will have the properties of a stochastic background. The goal of this\nwork is to produce a map of the sky in which each galaxy is assigned a\nprobability of having suffered a recent merger, and of hosting a MBHB that\ncould be detected by PTAs. This constitutes a step forward in the understanding\nof the expected PTA signal: the skymap can be used to investigate the\nclustering properties of PTA sources and the spatial distribution of the\nobservable GW signal power; moreover, galaxies with the highest probabilities\ncould be used as inputs in targeted searches for individual GW sources. We also\ninvestigate the distribution of neighboring galaxies around galaxies hosting\nMBHBs, finding that the most likely detectable PTA sources are located in dense\ngalaxy environments. Different techniques are used in the search, including\nBayesian and Machine Learning algorithms, with consistent outputs. Our method\ngenerates a list of galaxies classified as MBHB hosts, that can be combined\nwith other searches to effectively reduce the number of misclassifications.

This vulnerability to line\nartifacts arises because the F-statistic compares the signal hypothesis to a\nGaussian-noise hypothesis, and hence is triggered by anything that resembles\nthe signal hypothesis more than Gaussian noise. Various ad-hoc veto methods to\ndeal with such line artifacts have been proposed and used in the past.

We here break this symmetry in the\ngravitational sector by specifying a preferred time direction, and thus a\npreferred frame, at each spacetime point. We then examine the consequences of\nthis gravitational Lorentz symmetry breaking in the orbital evolution of binary\npulsars, focusing on the dissipative effects.

First, it generically causes the emission of dipolar radiation,\nwhich makes the orbital separation decrease faster than in General Relativity.\nSecond, the quadrupole component of the emission is also modified. The orbital\nevolution depends critically on the sensitivities of the stars, which measure\nhow their binding energies depend on the motion relative to the preferred\nframe. We calculate the sensitivities numerically and compute the predicted\norbital decay rate of binary pulsars in Lorentz-violating gravity.

Abstract: The detectors of the UltraViolet Spectrographs (UVS) on Voyager 1/2 are\nrecording a background that was earlier assigned to disintegrations in the RTG.\nWe show that it arises instead from Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs). We show the\n1992-2013 GCR flux measured by UVS on V1 and, by comparing with data from the\nGCR dedicated detectors, we estimate the energy range responsible for this UVS\nsignal, around 300 MeV, and the response of UVS to the GCR anisotropy. After\nthe abrupt jumps of May and August 2012 the count rate has been fluctuating\nonly slightly around a constant value, but comparing with data from the LECP\nand the CRS instruments shows that those small variations are only responses to\na varying anisotropy and not to a flux change. Taking advantage of the\nsimilarity in energy range to one of the products of the CRS instrument suite,\nwe use the ratio between the two independent signals as a proxy for the\ntemporal evolution of the GCR spectral slope around the 300 MeV range. We show\nthat this slope has remained unchanged since Aug 2012 and find strong evidence\nthat it will no longer vary, implying the end of the modulation at those\nenergies and that V1 at this date is near or past the heliopause. The origin of\nthis narrow and stagnating inner heliosheath is still unclear, and we discuss\nthe potential effects of low solar wind speed episodes and subsequent\nself-amplified charge-exchange with interstellar neutrals, as a source of\ndeceleration and collapse. We suggest that the quasi-static region encountered\nby V1 may be related to such effects, triggered by the strong post\nsolar-maximum variability. This did not happen for V2 due to its trajectory at\nan angle further from the heliosphere axis and a later termination shock\ncrossing.

Hence, only the weak-field\nslow-motion aspects of relativistic celestial mechanics could be investigated.\nTesting gravity beyond the first post-Newtonian contributions was for a long\ntime out of reach.\n  The discovery of the first binary pulsar by Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor\nin the summer of 1974 initiated a completely new field for testing the\nrelativistic dynamics of gravitationally interacting bodies. For the first time\nthe back reaction of gravitational wave emission on the binary motion could be\nstudied. Furthermore, the Hulse-Taylor pulsar provided the first test bed for\nthe orbital dynamics of strongly self-gravitating bodies.\n  To date there are a number of pulsars known, which can be utilized for\nprecision test of gravity. Depending on their orbital properties and their\ncompanion, these pulsars provide tests for various different aspects of\nrelativistic dynamics. Besides tests of specific gravity theories, like general\nrelativity or scalar-tensor gravity, there are pulsars that allow for generic\nconstraints on potential deviations of gravity from general relativity in the\nquasi-stationary strong-field and the radiative regime.\n  This article presents a brief overview of this modern field of relativistic\ncelestial mechanics, reviews some of the highlights of gravity tests with radio\npulsars, and discusses their implications for gravitational physics and\nastronomy, including the upcoming gravitational wave astronomy. \n\n"}

We find\nthat the rotation can help onset of neutrino-driven explosions for the models\nin which the initial angular momentum is matched to that obtained in recent\nstellar evolutionary calculations (0.3-3 rad/s at the center). For the models\nwith larger initial angular momentum, the shock surface deforms to be more\noblate due to larger centrifugal force.

We establish a set of four observationally\nmeasurable parameters which can be used in combination, to identify a subset of\ngalaxy groups which are old, with a very high probability. We thus argue that a\nsample of fossil groups selected based on luminosity gap will result in a\ncontaminated sample of old galaxy groups.

Typically in an\nastrophysical scenario black holes are believed to be surrounded by a magnetic\nfield.

We\nconsider a model where the nuclear stellar population acquires an oblate shape\n(i.e., a flattened distribution) in the inner region near a supermassive black\nhole, and also the primary irradiation flare is expected to occur more likely\nnear the equatorial plane, co-planar with the infalling material. This suggests\nthat the reprocessing of primary X-rays results in a transient profile that\nshould be relevant for tidal-disruption events (TDE) in otherwise\nunder-luminous (inactive) galactic nuclei, i.e. with no prior accretion disc.\nResonance mechanisms of the stellar motion can increase the orbital\neccentricity for some stars in the nuclear cluster and help to bring them close\nto the tidal radius, where they can give rise to TDEs.

One possibility is the so-called\n\"chameleon\" mechanism, which renders an effective mass depending on the local\nmatter density.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation\nmapping and could also be extended to multi-band data.

In particular, after\nperforming a large number of numerical-relativity simulations of binaries with\nnuclear equations of state, we have found that the post-merger emission is\ncharacterized by two distinct and robust spectral features.

Radio observatories worldwide\nare currently carrying out observing programmes to detect GWs, with data sets\nbeing shared through the International Pulsar Timing Array project. One of the\nmost likely sources of low frequency GWs are supermassive black hole binaries\n(SMBHBs), detectable as a background due to a large number of binaries, or as\ncontinuous or burst emission from individual sources. No GW signal has yet been\ndetected, but stringent constraints are already being placed on galaxy\nevolution models. The SKA will bring this research to fruition.\n  In this chapter, we describe how timing observations using SKA1 will\ncontribute to detecting GWs, or can confirm a detection if a first signal\nalready has been identified when SKA1 commences observations. We describe how\nSKA observations will identify the source(s) of a GW signal, search for\nanisotropies in the background, improve models of galaxy evolution, test\ntheories of gravity, and characterise the early inspiral phase of a SMBHB\nsystem.\n  We describe the impact of the large number of millisecond pulsars to be\ndiscovered by the SKA; and the observing cadence, observation durations, and\ninstrumentation required to reach the necessary sensitivity.

At late times, Halpha emission exhibited a complex,\nmultipeaked profile reminiscent of SN1998S. In terms of spectroscopic\nevolution, we find that PTF11iqb was a near twin of SN~1998S, although with\nweaker interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) at early times, and\nstronger CSM interaction at late times. We interpret the spectral changes as\ncaused by early interaction with asymmetric CSM that is quickly (by day 20)\nenveloped by the expanding SN ejecta photosphere, but then revealed again after\nthe end of the plateau when the photosphere recedes. The light curve can be\nmatched with a simple model for weak CSM interaction added to the light curve\nof a normal SN~II-P.

Our\nsimulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the\nefficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization\nif radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams\nself-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the\nintersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a\ngeometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring\nrapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a\ngeometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is\nefficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and\nforms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated\nenergy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the\nsubsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to\n~2*10^{52} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10^6 Msun black hole. We also find\nthat a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced\ncircularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning\nblack hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably\nlong in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black\nhole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important\nnodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the\nother hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in\nthe radiatively inefficient case. We also discuss the relationship between our\nsimulations and the parabolic TDEs that are characteristic of most stellar\ntidal disruptions. \n\n"}

Absorption from the excited fine-structure levels of OI, CI\nand SiII are detected in the system towards J2140-0321, that has the largest HI\ncolumn density detected so far in an intervening DLA. This is the first\ndetection of OI fine-structure lines in a QSO-DLA, that also provides us a rare\npossibility to study the chemical abundances of less abundant atoms like Co and\nGe. Simple single phase photo-ionisation models fail to reproduce all the\nobserved quantities. Instead, we suggest that the cloud has a stratified\nstructure: H2 and CI likely originate from both a dense (log nH~2.5-3) cold\n(80K) and warm (250K) phase containing a fraction of the total HI while a\nwarmer (T>1000 K) phase probably contributes significantly to the high\nexcitation of OI fine-structure levels. The observed CI/H2 column density ratio\nis surprisingly low compared to model predictions and we do not detect CO\nmolecules: this suggests a possible underabundance of C by 0.7 dex compared to\nother alpha elements. The absorber could be a photo-dissociation region close\nto a bright star (or a star cluster) where higher temperature occurs in the\nilluminated region.

However, great progress in this area has been\nmade in recent years due to the data collected by the present generation of\nground based detectors like the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array.\nIn particular, it is believed that the study of the composition of the cosmic\nrays as a function of energy can play a fundamental role for the understanding\nof the origin of the cosmic rays. The observatories belonging to this\ngeneration are composed of arrays of surface detectors and fluorescence\ntelescopes. The duty cycle of the fluorescence telescopes is ~10 % in contrast\nwith the ~100 % of the surface detectors. Therefore, the energy calibration of\nthe events observed by the surface detectors is performed by using a\ncalibration curve obtained from a set of high quality events observed in\ncoincidence by both types of detectors. The advantage of this method is that\nthe reconstructed energy of the events observed by the surface detectors\nbecomes almost independent of simulations of the showers because just a small\npart of the reconstructed energy, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes,\ncomes from simulations. However, the calibration curve obtained in this way\ndepends on the composition of the cosmic rays, which can introduce biases in\ncomposition analyses when parameters with a strong dependence on primary energy\nare considered. In this work we develop an analytical method to study these\neffects.

Our new spectroscopy reveals a range of complex source\nbehavior. The variable He I companion wind emission lines can dominate\nbroad-band photometry, especially in red filters or near minimum brightness,\nand the wind flux should complete companion evaporation in a spin-down time.\nThe heated companion face also undergoes dramatic flares, reaching 40,000K over\n20% of the star; this is likely powered by a magnetic field generated in the\ncompanion. The companion center-of-light radial velocity is now well measured\nwith K_CoL = 615.4+/-5.km/s. We detect non-sinusoidal velocity components due\nto the heated face flux distribution.

We couple a continuum source to\nfragmented equatorial scattering regions, polar outflows, and toroidal,\nobscuring dust regions and investigate a wide range of geometries. We also\nconsider different levels of fragmentation in each scattering region to\nevaluate importance of fragmentation for the net polarization of the AGN.

We find a clear connection between the\ngamma-ray and radio emission, such that every period of gamma-ray activity is\naccompanied by the flaring of the mm-VLBI core and subsequent ejection of a new\nsuperluminal component. However, not all ejections of components are associated\nwith gamma-ray events detectable by Fermi.

One such set of relations determines all of the multipole moments of a\nneutron star just from the first three (the mass monopole, the current dipole\nand the mass quadrupole moment) approximately independently of the equation of\nstate. These three-hair relations were found to hold in neutron stars that\nrotate rigidly, as is the case in old pulsars, but neutron stars can also\nrotate differentially, as is the case for proto-neutron stars and hypermassive\ntransient remnants of binary mergers. We here extend the three-hair relations\nto differentially rotating stars for the first time with a generic rotation law\nusing two approximations: a weak-field scheme (an expansion in powers of the\nneutron star compactness) and a perturbative differential rotation scheme (an\nexpansion about rigid rotation). These approximations allow us to analytically\nderive approximately universal relations that allow us to determine all of the\nmultipole moments of a (perturbative) differentially rotating star in terms of\nonly the first four moments.

To do this, we propose two\nwell-defined tests which are tackled by 1D and 3D grid- and SPH- based codes.\nThe first test examines the `early phase' D-type scenario during which the\nmechanical pressure driving the expansion is significantly larger than the\nthermal pressure of the neutral medium. The second test examines the `late\nphase' D-type scenario during which the system relaxes to pressure equilibrium\nwith the external medium. Although they are mutually in excellent agreement,\nall twelve participating codes follow a modified expansion law that deviates\nsignificantly from the classical Spitzer solution in both scenarios. We present\na semi-empirical formula combining the two different solutions appropriate to\nboth early and late phases that agrees with high-resolution simulations to\n$\\lesssim2\\%$. This formula provides a much better benchmark solution for code\nvalidation than the Spitzer solution. The present comparison has validated the\nparticipating codes and through this project we provide a dataset for\ncalibrating the treatment of ionizing radiation hydrodynamics codes. \n\n"}

These particles, with energies above\n$10^{16}\\mathrm{eV}$, interact very rarely. Therefore, detectors that\ninstrument several gigatons of matter are needed to discover them. The ARA\ndetector is currently being constructed at South Pole. It is designed to use\nthe Askaryan effect, the emission of radio waves from neutrino-induced cascades\nin the South Pole ice, to detect neutrino interactions at very high energies.\nWith antennas distributed among 37 widely-separated stations in the ice, such\ninteractions can be observed in a volume of several hundred cubic kilometers.\nCurrently 3 deep ARA stations are deployed in the ice of which two have been\ntaking data since the beginning of the year 2013.

Due to their role neutrinos carry information from the heart of\nthe explosion and, due to their weakly interacting nature, offer the only\ndirect probe of the dynamics and thermodynamics at the center of a supernova.\nIn this paper, we review the present status of modelling the neutrino physics\nand signal formation in collapsing and exploding stars. We assess the\ncapability of current and planned large underground neutrino detectors to yield\nfaithful information of the time and flavor dependent neutrino signal from a\nfuture Galactic supernova. We show how the observable neutrino burst would\nprovide a benchmark for fundamental supernova physics with unprecedented\nrichness of detail.

These are of particular\ninterest as the neutralino annihilation models which fit these observations\nmight have observable consequences from radio to gamma-ray emission. Since dark\nmatter is expected to be a major matter constituent of cosmic structure, these\nmulti-frequency consequences should also be common to structures across the\nmass spectrum. Thus, in this work we make predictions for the multi-frequency\nspectra of three well-known sources dominated by dark matter, e.g. the Coma\ncluster, the galaxy M81, and the Draco dwarf galaxy using models favoured by\ndark matter interpretations of the aforementioned observations. We pay special\nattention to the consequences for these models when their cross-sections are\nrenormalised to reproduce the recent gamma-ray excess observed in the\nReticulum-2 dwarf galaxy, which throw a dark matter interpretation of this\nexcess into doubt.

When the WD passes deep enough within the MBH's tidal\nfield, these signatures include thermonuclear transients from burning during\nmaximum compression. We combine a hydrodynamic simulation that includes nuclear\nburning of the disruption of a $0.6 M_\\odot$ C/O WD with a Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer calculation to synthesize the properties of a representative\ntransient. The transient's emission emerges in the optical, with lightcurves\nand spectra reminiscent of type I SNe. The properties are strongly\nviewing-angle dependent, and key spectral signatures are $\\approx 10,000$ km\ns$^{-1}$ Doppler shifts due to the orbital motion of the unbound ejecta.\nDisruptions of He WDs likely produce large quantities of intermediate-mass\nelements, offering a possible production mechanism for Ca-rich transients.\nAccompanying multiwavelength transients are fueled by accretion and arise from\nthe nascent accretion disk and relativistic jet. If MBHs of moderate mass exist\nwith number densities similar to those of supermassive MBHs, both high energy\nwide-field monitors and upcoming optical surveys should detect tens to hundreds\nof WD tidal disruptions per year. The current best strategy for their detection\nmay therefore be deep optical follow up of high-energy transients of\nunusually-long duration. The detection rate or the non-detection of these\ntransients by current and upcoming surveys can thus be used to place meaningful\nconstraints on the extrapolation of the MBH mass function to moderate masses. \n\n"}

This can be described as diffusion in momentum space. Diffusive\nreacceleration has often been invoked to explain the peak observed in\nsecondary-to-primary ratios at a few GeV, in particular Boron-to-Carbon. This\navoids the necessity to postulate an ad-hoc break in the spatial diffusive\ncoefficient, and has become almost a standard in modelling cosmic-ray spectra.\nHowever, at the levels invoked, the process implies a significant input of\nenergy from the interstellar medium into cosmic rays, so that in such models\ninterstellar space competes with the usual accelerators like supernova\nremnants. The questions arise: is reacceleration really occurring at the high\nlevel required to explain secondary-to-primary ratios? and are the energy\nrequirements physically plausible?

The flux-calibrated, multifrequency LOFAR pulse profiles\nare publicly available via the EPN Database of Pulsar Profiles. We also present\naverage values of dispersion measures (DM) and discuss DM and profile\nvariations. About 35% of the MSPs show strong narrow profiles, another 25%\nexhibit scattered profiles, and the rest are only weakly detected. A\nqualitative comparison of LOFAR profiles with those at higher radio frequencies\nshows constant separation between profile components. Similarly, the profile\nwidths are consistent with those observed at higher frequencies, unless\nscattering dominates at the lowest frequencies. This is very different from\nwhat is observed for normal pulsars and suggests a compact emission region in\nthe MSP magnetosphere.

Our aim is to assess the robustness of this\nprocess. We perform 2D numerical simulations of a simplified setup in\ncylindrical geometry to investigate the timescale over which the dynamics is\ndominated by a spiral or a sloshing mode. We observe that the spiral mode\nprevails only if the ratio of the initial shock radius to the neutron star\nradius exceeds a critical value. In that regime, both the degree of asymmetry\nand the average expansion of the shock induced by the spiral mode increase\nmonotonously with this ratio, exceeding the values obtained when a sloshing\nmode is artificially imposed. With a timescale of 2-3 SASI oscillations, the\ndynamics of SASI takes place fast enough to affect the spin of the neutron star\nbefore the explosion. The spin periods deduced from the simulations are\ncompared favorably to analytical estimates evaluated from the measured\nsaturation amplitude of the SASI wave.

Our\nsimulations, in contrast, exhibit a stronger relationship, and show that\nprevious work was box-size limited: turbulent `eddies' were artificially\nrestricted by the numerical domain rather than by the scale height.\nZero-net-flux runs without physical diffusion coefficients yield a stress\nproportional to $P^{0.5}$, where P is pressure. The stresses are also\nproportional to the grid length and hence remain numerically unconverged. The\nsame runs with physical diffusivities, however, give a result closer to an\nalpha-disk: the stress is proportional to $P^{0.9}$. Net-flux simulations\nwithout explicit diffusion exhibit stresses proportional to $P^{0.5}$, but\nstronger imposed fields weaken this correlation. In summary, compressibility is\nimportant for the saturation of the MRI, but the exact stress-pressure\nrelationship is difficult to ascertain in local simulations because of\nnumerical convergence issues and the influence of any imposed flux.

Their bright phases typically last\nfor 100~d or less, rather than persisting for several years.

The spectra show\ninteresting changes in velocity and line shape that we discuss in detail,\nincluding an asymmetric Halpha emission line that we show is consistent with\nthe ejection of a bipolar nebula that could be very much like the Homunculus of\neta Car. Moreover, changes in the line width, line profile, blue excess\nemission resembling that of Type IIn supernovae, and the intensity of Halpha\nsuggest the presence of strong circumstellar interaction in the eruption at\nlate times.

Turbulence is known to change the nature\nof many physical processes dramatically and in this review we claim that\nmagnetic reconnection is not an exception. We stress that not only\nastrophysical turbulence is ubiquitous, but also magnetic reconnection itself\ninduces turbulence. Thus turbulence must be accounted for in any realistic\nastrophysical reconnection setup. We argue that due to the similarities of MHD\nturbulence in relativistic and non-relativistic cases the theory of magnetic\nreconnection developed for the non-relativistic case can be extended to the\nrelativistic case and we provide numerical simulations that support this\nconjecture. We also provide quantitative comparisons of the theoretical\npredictions and results of numerical experiments, including the situations when\nturbulent reconnection is self-driven, i.e. the turbulence in the system is\ngenerated by the reconnection process itself. We show how turbulent\nreconnection entails the violation of magnetic flux freezing, the conclusion\nthat has really far reaching consequences for many realistically turbulent\nastrophysical environments. In addition, we consider observational testing of\nturbulent reconnection as well as numerous implications of the theory. The\nformer includes the Sun and solar wind reconnection, while the latter include\nthe process of reconnection diffusion induced by turbulent reconnection, the\nacceleration of energetic particles, bursts of turbulent reconnection related\nto black hole sources as well as gamma ray bursts.

We make use of the\nsample of the 100 brightest galaxy clusters discovered in the XXL Survey to\ninvestigate the fraction of baryons in the form of hot gas and stars in the\ncluster population. We measure the gas masses of the detected halos and use a\nmass--temperature relation directly calibrated using weak-lensing measurements\nfor a subset of XXL clusters to estimate the halo mass. We find that the\nweak-lensing calibrated gas fraction of XXL-100-GC clusters is substantially\nlower than was found in previous studies using hydrostatic masses.

In this paper we study an optical/IR transient\ndiscovered in the nearby galaxy NGC4490, which appeared similar to these merger\nevents (unobscured progenitor, irregular multi-peaked light curve, increasingly\nred color, similar optical spectrum, IR excess at late times), but which had a\nhigher peak luminosity and longer duration in outburst.

Despite being observed for decades, the macroscopic\ntransport properties of the ICM are still not well-constrained. A path to\ndetermine macroscopic ICM properties opened up with the discovery of \"cold\nfronts\". These were observed as sharp discontinuities in surface brightness and\ntemperature in the ICM, with the property that the brighter (and denser) side\nof the discontinuity is the colder one. The high spatial resolution of the\nChandra X-ray Observatory revealed two puzzles about the cold fronts. First,\nthey should be subject to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilites, yet in many cases they\nappear relatively smooth and undisturbed. Second, the width of the interface\nbetween the two gas phases is typically narrower than the mean free path of the\nparticles in the plasma, indicating negligible thermal conduction. From the\ntime of their discovery, it was realized that these special characteristics of\ncold fronts may be used to probe the physical properties of the cluster plasma.\nIn this review, we will discuss the recent simulations of cold front formation\nand evolution in galaxy clusters, with a focus on those which have attempted to\nuse these features to constrain the physics of the ICM. In particular, we will\nfocus on the effects of magnetic fields, viscosity, and thermal conductivity on\nthe stability properties and long-term evolution of cold fronts.

The Predicted Radio Emission Abstract: Accretion discs in AGN may be associated with coronal gas, as suggested by\ntheir X-ray emission. Stellar coronal emission includes radio emission, and AGN\ncorona may also be a significant source for radio emission in radio quiet (RQ)\nAGN. We calculate the coronal properties required to produce the observed radio\nemission in RQ AGN, either from synchrotron emission of power-law (PL)\nelectrons, or from cyclo-synchrotron emission of hot mildly-relativistic\nthermal electrons. We find that a flat spectrum, as observed in about half of\nRQ AGN, can be produced by corona with a disc or a spherical configuration,\nwhich extends from the innermost regions out to a pc scale. A spectral break to\nan optically thin power-law emission is expected around 300-1000 GHz, as the\ninnermost corona becomes optically thin. In case of thermal electrons, a sharp\nspectral cutoff is expected above the break. The position of the break can be\nmeasured with VLBI observations, which exclude the cold dust emission, and it\ncan be used to probe the properties of the innermost corona. Assuming\nequipartition of the coronal thermal energy density, the PL electrons energy\ndensity, and the magnetic field, we find that the energy density in a disc\ncorona should scale as $\\sim R^{-1.3}$, to get a flat spectrum. In the\nspherical case the energy density scales as $\\sim R^{-2}$, and is $\\sim 4\\times\n10^{-4}$ of the AGN radiation energy density.

With the success of aLIGO and the\nadvent of instruments like the SKA and eLISA, the prospects for the discovery\nof such PSR-BH binaries are very promising.

This suggests a higher effective yield\nin the bulge, perhaps due to more efficient retention of supernova ejecta. The\nbulge vertical [Fe/H] gradient, at ~0.5 dex/kpc, appears to be due to a\nchanging mixture of sub-populations (near +0.3 dex and -0.3 dex and one\npossibly near -0.7 dex) with latitude. The bulge is enhanced in O, Mg, Si, Ca,\nTi, and Al relative to the sun, with [alpha/Fe]=+0.15 dex at [Fe/H]=0.0 dex.\nBelow [Fe/H]~-0.5 dex, the bulge and local thick disk compositions are very\nsimilar, but small [Mg/Fe] and possibly [<SiCaTi>/Fe] enhancements, low [La/Eu]\nratios and large [Cu/Fe], relative to the thick disk suggest slightly higher\nSFR in the bulge. However, these composition differences could simply be due to\nmeasurement errors and non-LTE effects. Unfortunately, comparison with the\nthick disk near solar [Fe/H] suffers considerable confusion, due to poor\nidentification of the local thick disk.

Two galaxies in our sample have\nkinematically distinct cores in their stellar component, likely the result of\naccretion.

In this method, we use dispersion\nmeasures (DMs) of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) that appear behind the cluster and\nthe Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect towards the cluster.

Within this framework, the probability of absorption by an\nobject at rest completely determines the superradiant amplification rate when\nthat same object is spinning. We first discuss in detail superradiant\nscattering of spin 0 particles with orbital angular momentum $\\ell=1$, and then\nextend our analysis to higher values of orbital angular momentum and spin.\nAlong the way, we provide a simple derivation of vacuum friction---a \"quantum\ntorque\" acting on spinning objects in empty space.

Aims: Attempt to,\nfor the first time, spectrally resolve CO thermal line emission in a small\nsample of AGB stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Methods: ALMA was used to\nobserve 2 OH/IR stars and 4 carbon stars in the LMC in the CO J= 2-1 line.\nResults: We present the first measurement of expansion velocities in\nextragalactic carbon stars. All four C-stars are detected and wind expansion\nvelocities and stellar velocities are directly measured. Mass-loss rates are\nderived from modelling the spectral energy distribution and Spitzer/IRS\nspectrum with the DUSTY code. Gas-to-dust ratios are derived that make the\npredicted velocities agree with the observed ones. The expansion velocities and\nMLRs are compared to a Galactic sample of well-studied relatively low MLRs\nstars supplemented with \"extreme\" C-stars that have properties more similar to\nthe LMC targets. Gas MLRs derived from a simple formula are significantly\nsmaller than derived from the dust modelling, indicating an order of magnitude\nunderestimate of the estimated CO abundance, time-variable mass loss, or that\nthe CO intensities in LMC stars are lower than predicted by the formula derived\nfor Galactic objects. This could be related to a stronger interstellar\nradiation field in the LMC. Conclusions: Although the LMC sample is small and\nthe comparison to Galactic stars is non-trivial because of uncertainties in\ntheir distances it appears that for C stars the wind expansion velocities in\nthe LMC are lower than in the solar neighbourhood, while the MLRs appear\nsimilar.

However, it is unclear how molecules and grains are able to\ncondense within the ejecta, given the potentially harsh environment created by\nionizing radiation from the white dwarf. Motivated by the evidence for powerful\nradiative shocks within nova outflows, we propose that dust formation occurs\nwithin the cool, dense shell behind these shocks. We incorporate a simple\nmolecular chemistry network and classical nucleation theory with a model for\nthe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas, in order to demonstrate the\nformation of both carbon and forsterite ($\\rm Mg_2SiO_4$) grains. The high\ndensities due to radiative shock compression ($n \\sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$)\nresult in CO saturation and rapid dust nucleation. Grains grow efficiently to\nlarge sizes $\\gtrsim 0.1\\mu$m, in agreement with IR observations of\ndust-producing novae, and with total dust masses sufficient to explain massive\nextinction events such as V705 Cas. As in dense stellar winds, dust formation\nis CO-regulated, with carbon-rich flows producing carbon-rich grains and\noxygen-rich flows primarily forming silicates. CO is destroyed by non-thermal\nparticles accelerated at the shock, allowing additional grain formation at late\ntimes, but the efficiency of this process appears to be low. Given observations\nshowing that individual novae produce both carbonaceous and silicate grains, we\nconcur with previous works attributing this bimodality to chemical\nheterogeneity of the ejecta. Nova outflows are diverse and inhomogeneous, and\nthe observed variety of dust formation events can be reconciled by different\nabundances, the range of shock properties, and the observer viewing angle. The\nlatter may govern the magnitude of extinction, with the deepest extinction\nevents occurring for observers within the binary equatorial plane. \n\n"}

No quantitative limits have previously been set for CasA and the\nCrab, while for SN1987A we merely updated existing limits in view of new\nestimates of the dust content. The lack of stellar companions to these three\nccSNe implies a 90% confidence upper limit on the q>0.1 binary fraction at\ndeath of fb<44%. In a passively evolving binary model (meaning no binary\ninteractions), with a flat mass ratio distribution and a Salpeter IMF, the\nresulting 90% confidence upper limit on the initial binary fraction of F<63% is\nin considerable tension with observed massive binary statistics. Allowing a\nsignificant fraction fM~25% of stellar binaries to merge reduces the tension,\nwith F<63/(1-fM)~81%, but allowing for the significant fraction in higher order\nsystems (triples, etc.) reintroduces the tension.

In particular, the hardness of the X-ray continuum is found\nto depend on luminosity. In a few sources, the correlation between the energy\nof the cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) and the luminosity is\nclear. Different types (signs) of the correlation are believed to reflect\ndifferent accretion modes. We analyse two NuSTAR observations of the transient\naccreting pulsar Cep X-4 during its 2014 outburst. Our analysis is focused on a\ndetailed investigation of the dependence of the CRSF energy and of the spectral\nhardness on X-ray luminosity, especially on short timescales. To investigate\nthe spectral changes as a function of luminosity within each of the two\nobservations, we used the intrinsic variability of the source on the timescale\nof individual pulse cycles (tens of seconds), the so-called pulse-to-pulse\nvariability. We find that the NuSTAR spectrum of Cep X-4 contains two CRSFs:\nthe fundamental line at ~30 keV and its harmonic at ~55 keV. We find for the\nfirst time that the energy of the fundamental CRSF increases and the continuum\nbecomes harder with increasing X-ray luminosity not only between the two\nobservations, that is, on the long timescale, but also within an individual\nobservation, on the timescale of a few tens of seconds.

The pericenters of the orbits\nperform a random walk, and we consider cases where this random walk slowly\nbrings the binary to the Hills tidal separation radius (the so-called empty\nloss-cone regime). However, we find that in a majority of cases the expected\nseparation does not occur and instead the members of the binary merge together.\nThis happens because the binary's eccentricity is excited by tidal interactions\nwith the MBH, and the relative excursions of the internal eccentricity of the\nbinary far exceed those in its internal semimajor axis.

This implies that violent mass loss must\nhave occurred several decades before the supernova explosion. Such a short time\ninterval suggests that eruptive mass loss could be common shortly prior to the\ndeath of a massive star as a SLSN.

The average BHAR is\ncorrelated positively with both SFR and $M_*$, and the BHAR-SFR and BHAR-$M_*$\nrelations can both be described acceptably by linear models with a slope of\nunity. However, BHAR appears to be correlated more strongly with $M_*$ than\nSFR. This result indicates that $M_*$ is the primary host-galaxy property\nrelated to black-hole growth, and the apparent BHAR-SFR relation is largely a\nsecondary effect due to the star-forming main sequence.

Dust scattering was\nrecently recognized as a potential contributor to polarization, although its\nbasic properties have yet to be thoroughly explored. Here, we quantify the\neffects of optical depth on the scattering-induced polarization in inclined\ndisks through a combination of analytical illustration, approximate\nsemi-analytical modeling using formal solution to the radiative transfer\nequation, and Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the near-side of the disk\nis significantly brighter in polarized intensity than the far-side, provided\nthat the disk is optically thick and that the scattering grains have yet to\nsettle to the midplane. This asymmetry is the consequence of a simple geometric\neffect: the near-side of the disk surface is viewed more edge-on than the\nfar-side. It is a robust signature that may be used to distinguish the\nscattering-induced polarization from that by other mechanisms, such as aligned\ngrains. The asymmetry is weaker for a geometrically thinner dust disk. As such,\nit opens an exciting new window on dust settling. We find anecdotal evidence\nfrom dust continuum imaging of edge-on disks that large grains are not yet\nsettled in the youngest (Class 0) disks, but become more so in older disks.\nThis trend is corroborated by the polarization data in inclined disks showing\nthat younger disks have more pronounced near-far side asymmetry and thus less\ngrain settling.

It is known that this leads to an instability, with exponential\namplification of gauge fields, controlled by the parameter $\\xi=\n\\dot{\\phi}/(2fH)$, which can strongly affect the generation of cosmological\nperturbations and even the background. We show that scattering rates involving\ngauge fields can become larger than the expansion rate $H$, due to the very\nlarge occupation numbers, and create a thermal bath of particles of temperature\n$T$ during inflation. In the thermal regime, energy is transferred to smaller\nscales, radically modifying the predictions of this scenario. We thus argue\nthat previous constraints on $\\xi$ are alleviated. If the gauge fields have\nStandard Model interactions, which naturally provides reheating, they\nthermalize already at $\\xi\\gtrsim2.9$, before perturbativity constraints and\nalso before backreaction takes place. In absence of SM interactions (i.e. for a\ndark photon), we find that gauge fields and inflaton perturbations thermalize\nif $\\xi\\gtrsim3.4$; however, observations require $\\xi\\gtrsim6$, which is above\nthe perturbativity and backreaction bounds and so a dedicated study is\nrequired.

The Early Break-Out Phase Abstract: In this series of papers, we model the formation and evolution of the\nphotoionized region and its observational signatures during massive star\nformation. Here we focus on the early break out of the photoionized region into\nthe outflow cavity. Using results of 3-D magnetohydrodynamic-outflow\nsimulations and protostellar evolution calculations, we perform post-processing\nradiative-transfer. The photoionized region first appears at a protostellar\nmass of 10Msun in our fiducial model, and is confined to within 10-100AU by the\ndense inner outflow, similar to some observed very small hypercompact HII\nregions. Since the ionizing luminosity of the massive protostar increases\ndramatically as Kelvin-Helmholz (KH) contraction proceeds, the photoionized\nregion breaks out to the entire outflow region in <10,000yr. Accordingly, the\nradio free-free emission brightens significantly in this stage. In our fiducial\nmodel, the radio luminosity at 10 GHz changes from 0.1 mJy kpc2 at m=11Msun to\n100 mJy kpc2 at 16Msun, while the infrared luminosity increases by less than a\nfactor of two. The radio spectral index also changes in the break-out phase\nfrom the optically thick value of 2 to the partially optically thin value of\n0.6. Additionally, we demonstrate that short-timescale variation in free-free\nflux would be induced by an accretion burst. The outflow density is enhanced in\nthe accretion burst phase, which leads to a smaller ionized region and weaker\nfree-free emission. The radio luminosity may decrease by one order of magnitude\nduring such bursts, while the infrared luminosity is much less affected, since\ninternal protostellar luminosity dominates over accretion luminosity after KH\ncontraction starts. Such variability may be observable on timescales as short\n10-100 yr, if accretion bursts are driven by disk instabilities. \n\n"}

With the smallest\ndistance and highest apparent brightness for an SLSN-I, we are able to study\nGaia17biu in unprecedented detail. Its pre-peak near-ultraviolet to optical\ncolor is similar to that of Gaia16apd and among the bluest observed for an\nSLSN-I while its peak luminosity (M_g = -21 mag) is substantially lower than\nGaia16apd.

This resonant tide can induce phase shift in the\ngravitational waveforms, and potentially provide a new window of studying NS\ninterior using gravitational waves. Previous works have considered tidal\nexcitations of pure g-modes (due to stable stratification of the star) and pure\ninertial modes (due to Coriolis force), with the rotational effect treated in\nan approximate manner. However, for realistic NSs, the buoyancy and rotational\neffects can be comparable, giving rise to mixed inertial-gravity modes. We\ndevelop a non-perturbative numerical spectral code to compute the frequencies\nand tidal coupling coefficients of these modes. We then calculate the phase\nshift in the gravitational waveform due to each resonance during binary\ninspiral. We adopt polytropic NS models with a parameterized stratification. We\nderive relevant scaling relations and survey how the phase shift depends on\nvarious properties of the NS. We find that for canonical NSs (with mass M =\n1.4M_sun and radius R = 10 km) and modest rotation rates (< 300 Hz), the\ngravitational wave phase shift due to a resonance is generally less than 0.01\nradian. But the phase shift is a strong function of R and M, and can reach a\nradian or more for low-mass NSs with larger radii (R > 15 km). Significant\nphase shift can also be produced when the combination of stratification and\nrotation gives rise to a very low frequency (< 20 Hz in the inertial frame)\nmodified g-mode.

A white noise power spectral density (PSD) is expected at low\nfrequency in this model, however, direct observational constraint to the low\nfrequency PSD slope is hard due to limited lengths of the light curves\navailable.

To\ncomplicate the picture the precision of recent data have started challenging\nexisting models.\n  To tackle these issues we use available multifrequency observations of the\ninterstellar emission from radio to gamma rays, together with direct CR\nmeasurements, to study local interstellar spectra (LIS) and propagation models.\n  As a result, the electron LIS is characterized without any assumption on\nsolar modulation, and favorite propagation models are put forward. More\nprecisely, our analysis leads to the following main conclusions: (1) the\nelectron injection spectrum needs at least a break below a few GeV; (2) even\nthough consistent with direct CR measurements, propagation models producing a\nLIS with large all-electron density from a few hundreds of MeV to a few GeV are\ndisfavored by both radio and gamma-ray observations; (3) the usual assumption\nthat direct CR measurements, after accounting for solar modulation, are\nrepresentative of the proton LIS in our ~1 kpc region is challenged by the\nobserved local gamma-ray HI emissivity.\n  We provide the resulting proton LIS, all-electron LIS, and propagation\nparameters, based on synchrotron, gamma-ray, and direct CR data.

With a\nrest-frame rise time of only 4 days, iPTF16asu challenges the existing popular\nmodels, for example, the radioactive heating (56Ni-only) and the magnetar+56Ni\nmodels. Here we show that this rapid rise could be attributed to interaction\nbetween the SN ejecta and a pre-existing circumstellar medium ejected by the\nprogenitor during its final stages of evolution, while the late-time light\ncurve can be better explained by energy input from a rapidly spinning magnetar.\nThis model is a natural extension to the previous magnetar model.

The LC of iPTF15esb exhibits two peaks\nand a post-peak plateau, and furthermore the late-time spectrum of iPTF15esb\nshows a strong, broad H$\\alpha$ emission line. The early-time LC of iPTF13dcc\nshows a long duration bump followed by the second peak. Here we propose an\nejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction model involving multiple\nshells/winds and use it to explain the LCs of iPTF15esb and iPTF13dcc.

However, the origin of this hot\ngas is still unclear: it can arise in the hot interstellar medium (ISM), or is\nintrinsic to the XRBs. In this paper, we present an XMM-Newton survey of the\nOVII absorption lines in the spectra of Galactic XRBs. A total of 33 XRBs were\nselected, with 29 low mass XRBs and 4 high mass XRBs. At more than 3$\\sigma$\nthreshold, OVII absorption line was detected in 16 targets, among which 4 were\nnewly discovered in this work. The average line equivalent width (EW) is\ncentered around $\\sim$ 20 m\\AA. Additionally we do not find strong correlations\nbetween the OVII EWs and the Galactic neutral absorption N$_{\\rm H}$, the\nGalactic coordinates or the distance of background targets.

If an\ninner Lindblad resonance (ILR) lies within the disk, ingoing waves are robustly\nexcited, and the angular-momentum flux they carry is independent of Mach\nnumber.

If light bosons exist in nature, they will\nspontaneously form \"clouds\" by extracting rotational energy from rotating\nmassive black holes through superradiance, a classical wave amplification\nprocess that has been studied for decades.

Hence, both the black hole geometry and the\ncloud encode information about the light boson. For this reason, measurements\nof the gravitational field of the black hole/cloud system (as encoded in\ngravitational waves) are over-determined.

SNe that are randomly\ndistributed throughout a galactic disc drive inefficient galactic winds because\nmost supernova remnants lose their energy radiatively before breaking out of\nthe disc. Accounting for the fact that most star formation is clustered\nalleviates this problem. Super-bubbles driven by the combined effects of\nclustered SNe propagate rapidly enough to break out of galactic discs well\nbefore the clusters' SNe stop going off. The radiative losses post-breakout are\nreduced dramatically and a large fraction ($\\gtrsim 0.2$) of the energy\nreleased by SNe vents into the halo powering a strong galactic wind.

At the time of their formation, the PBHs get attached\nto the strings and influence their evolution, leading to the formation of\nblack-hole-string networks and commonly to the suppression of loop production\nin a range of redshifts. Subsequently, reconnections within the network give\nrise to small nets made of several black holes and connecting strings. The\nnumber of black holes in the network as well as the stability of the nets\ndepend on the topological properties of the strings. The nets oscillate and\nshrink exponentially due to the emission of gravitational waves. This leads to\npotentially observable string-driven mergers of PBHs. The strings can keep PBHs\nfrom galactic halos, making the current bounds on PBHs not generally\napplicable. Alternatively, heavy PBHs can drag low-tension strings into the\ncenters of galaxies.

Abstract: Wide-field optical surveys have begun to uncover large samples of fast\n(t_rise < 5d), luminous (M_peak < -18), blue transients. While commonly\nattributed to the breakout of a supernova shock into a dense wind, the great\ndistances to the transients of this class found so far have hampered detailed\ninvestigation of their properties. We present photometry and spectroscopy from\na comprehensive worldwide campaign to observe AT2018cow (ATLAS18qqn), the first\nfast-luminous optical transient to be found in real time at low redshift. Our\nfirst spectra (<2 days after discovery) are entirely featureless. A very broad\nabsorption feature suggestive of near-relativistic velocities develops between\n3-8 days, then disappears. Broad emission features of H and He develop after\n>10 days. The spectrum remains extremely hot throughout its evolution, and the\nphotospheric radius contracts with time (receding below R<10^14 cm after 1\nmonth). This behaviour does not match that of any known supernova, although a\nrelativistic jet within a fallback supernova could explain some of the observed\nfeatures. Alternatively, the transient could originate from the disruption of a\nstar by an intermediate-mass black hole, although this would require\nlong-lasting emission of highly super-Eddington thermal radiation. In either\ncase, AT2018cow suggests that the population of fast luminous transients\nrepresents a new class of astrophysical event. Intensive follow-up of this\nevent in its late phases, and of any future events found at comparable\ndistance, will be essential to better constrain their origins. \n\n"}

We also\nexplore the formation and dynamical impact of density cusps that arise in both\nsystems due to the presence of a massive, central black hole.

Morphologically, the SiO appears to represent a disc-like structure.\nUsing parametric models we show that the position-velocity profile of the SiO\nis consistent with the Keplerian rotation of a disc around an object between\n10-30Mo in mass, only if there is also radial expansion from a separate\nstructure. The radial motion component can be interpreted as a disc wind from\nthe disc surface. Models with a central stellar object mass between 20 and 30Mo\nare the most consistent with the stellar luminosity (100000 Lo) and indicative\nof an O-type star.

Proxies exist to evaluate the\nefficiency of mass and angular momentum accretion but they depend so\ndramatically on the wind speed that given the current uncertainties, they only\nset loose constrains. Furthermore, they often bypass the impact of orbital and\nshock effects on the flow structure. We study the wind dynamics and the angular\nmomentum gained as the flow is accreted. We identify the conditions for the\nformation of a disc-like structure around the accretor and the observational\nconsequences for SgXB. We use recent results on the wind launching mechanism to\ncompute 3D streamlines, accounting for the gravitational and X-ray ionizing\ninfluence of the compact companion on the wind. Once the flow enters the Roche\nlobe of the accretor, we solve the hydrodynamics equations with cooling. A\nshocked region forms around the accretor as the flow is beamed. For wind speeds\nof the order of the orbital speed, the shock is highly asymmetric compared to\nthe axisymmetric bow shock obtained for a purely planar homogeneous flow. With\nnet radiative cooling, the flow always circularizes for wind speeds low enough.\nAlthough the donor star does not fill its Roche lobe, the wind can be\nsignificantly beamed and bent by the orbital effects. The net angular momentum\nof the accreted flow is then sufficient to form a persistent disc-like\nstructure. This mechanism could explain the proposed limited outer extension of\nthe accretion disc in Cygnus X-1 and suggests the presence of a disc at the\nouter rim of the neutron star magnetosphere in Vela X-1, with dramatic\nconsequences on the spinning up of the accretor. \n\n"}

Inspiral,\n  transition, and plunge trajectories using a generalized Ori-Thorne procedure Abstract: The last gravitational waves emitted in the coalescence of two black holes\nare quasi-normal ringing modes of the merged remnant. In general relativity,\nthe mass and the spin of the remnant black hole uniquely determine the\nfrequency and damping time of each radiated mode. The amplitudes of these modes\nare determined by the mass ratio of the system and the geometry of the\ncoalescence. This paper is part I of an analysis that aims to compute the\n\"excitation factors\" associated with misaligned binary black hole coalescence.\nTo simplify the analysis, we consider a large mass ratio system consisting of a\nnon-spinning body of mass $\\mu$ that inspirals on a quasi-circular trajectory\ninto a Kerr black hole of mass $M$ and spin parameter $a$, with $\\mu/M \\ll 1$.\nOur goal is to understand how different modes are excited as a function of the\nblack hole spin $a$ and an angle $I$ which characterizes the misalignment of\nthe orbit with the black hole's spin axis. Though the large mass ratio limit\ndoes not describe the binaries that are being observed by gravitational-wave\ndetectors today, this limit makes it possible to quickly and easily explore the\nbinary parameter space, and to develop insight into how the system's late\nringing waves depend on the binary's geometry. In this first analysis, we\ndevelop the worldline which the small body follows as it inspirals and then\nplunges into the large black hole. Our analysis generalizes earlier work by Ori\nand Thorne to describe how a non-equatorial circular inspiral transitions into\na plunging trajectory that falls into the black hole. The worldlines which we\ndevelop here are used in part II as input to a time-domain black hole\nperturbation solver. This solver computes the gravitational waves generated by\nsuch inspirals and plunges, making it possible to characterize the modes which\nthe coalescence excites. \n\n"}

The rapid\ncontinuum variations observed in the X-ray spectra are not detected in the\noptical, although the time-averaged X-ray and optical continuum fluxes are\nwell-correlated. Variations in the flux of the broad Hbeta line are found to\nlag behind the optical continuum variations by 6 days (with an uncertainty of\n2-3 days), and combining this with the line width yields a virial mass estimate\nof about 1.1 million solar masses, at the very low end of the distribution of\nAGN masses measured by line reverberation. Strong variability of He II 4686 is\nalso detected, and the response time measured is similar to that of Hbeta, but\nwith a much larger uncertainty. The He II 4686 line is almost five times\nbroader than Hbeta, and it is strongly blueward asymmetric, as are the\nhigh-ionization UV lines recorded in archival spectra of NGC 4051.

At the light of this last paper, the result may be also read\nas a strong dependence of the CVT prediction on the model chosen to describe\nthe mass distribution around galaxies, suggesting that the CVT cannot be taken\nas a direct evidence of a low density universe. Similarly to what shown in Del\nPopolo & Gambera (1999, 2000) (hereafter DG99, DG00), Del Popolo et al.

Without the fifth image, the arc properties\ntogether with the shear map profile are equally well fit by the and by an IS\nand a sub-class of generalized-NFW mass profiles having inner slope power index\nin the range 0.7<alpha<1.2. Adding new constrains provided by the fifth image\nfavors IS profiles that better predict the fifth image properties. A model\nincluding cluster galaxy perturbations or the the stellar mass distribution\ndoes not change our conclusions but imposes the M/L_I of the cD stellar\ncomponent is below 10 at a 99% confidence level.\n  Using our new detailed lensing model together with Chandra X-ray data and the\ncD stellar component we finally discuss intrinsic properties of the\ngravitational potential. Whereas X-ray and dark matter have a similar shape at\nvarious radius, the cD stellar isophotes are twisted by 13 deg. The sub-\narc-second azimuthal shift we observe between the radial arc position and the\npredictions of elliptical models correspond to what is expected from a mass\ndistribution twist. This shift may result from a projection effect of the cD\nand the cluster halos, thus revealing the triaxiality of the system. \n\n"}

These core-collapse explosions\nare conjectured to radiate an anisotropic, beamed component associated with a\ndecelerating, relativistic outflow and an unbeamed, isotropic component\nassociated with the slowly expanding stellar debris. The anisotropic emission\nremains at a very low level until the Doppler cone of the beam intersects the\nobserver's line of sight, making off-axis GRB jets directly detectable only at\nlong wavelengths and late times.

During the luminous phase (first 100\nd) the line profiles are composed of three major components: (i) narrow P-Cygni\nlines with the absorption minima at -700 km/s; (ii) broad emission lines with\nBVZI ~4000 km/s; and (iii) broad, smooth wings, most apparent in H-alpha. These\ncomponents are identified with an expanding circumstellar (CS) envelope,\nshocked cool gas in the forward post-shock region, and multiple Thomson\nscattering in the CS envelope, respectively. The absence of broad P-Cygni lines\nfrom the supernova is the result of the formation of an optically thick, cool,\ndense shell at the interface of the ejecta and the CS envelope. We model the\nsupernova deceleration and Thomson scattering wings to recover the density,\nradial extent and Thomson optical depth of the CS envelope during the first\nmonth.

In agreement with previous studies, we find that\nthe radial distribution of subhalos is significantly less concentrated than\nthat of the dark matter, when subhalos are selected using their present-day\ngravitationally bound mass. We show that the difference in the radial\ndistribution is not a numerical artifact and is due to tidal stripping. The\nsubhalos in the cluster core lose more than 70% of their initial mass since\naccretion, while the average tidal mass loss for halos near the virial radius\nis ~30%. This introduces a radial bias in the spatial distribution of subhalos\nwhen they are selected using their tidally truncated mass. We demonstrate that\nthe radial bias disappears almost entirely if subhalos are selected using their\nmass or circular velocity at the accretion epoch. The comparisons of the\nresults of dissipationless simulations to the observed distribution of galaxies\nin clusters are therefore sensitive to the selection criteria used to select\nsubhalo samples. Using the simulations that include cooling and starformation,\nwe show that the radial distribution of subhalos is in reasonable agreement\nwith the observed radial distribution of galaxies in clusters for\n0.1<R/R200<2.0, if subhalos are selected using the stellar mass of galaxies.\nThe radial bias is minimized in this case because the stars are located in the\ncenters of dark matter subhalos and are tightly bound. The stellar mass of an\nobject is therefore approximately conserved as the dark matter is stripped from\nthe outer regions. Nevertheless, the concentration of the radial distribution\nof galaxies is systematically lower than that of the dark matter. \n\n"}

The overall SNR\nspectrum can be described by two spectral components. The soft component is in\nionization equilibrium and has a temperature of ~0.8 keV; the hard spectral\ncomponent has a temperature of ~1.4 keV, an ionization timescale of ~5x10^{11}\ncm{-3}s and enhanced abundances of Si. The spatially resolved spectral modeling\nshows that S may also be enhanced, at least in some regions. The enhanced\nabundances clearly point to the presence of an ejecta component in this\nremnant. The X-ray morphology of G349.7+0.2 is strikingly similar to that at\nradio wavelengths - an irregular shell with a brighter eastern side - which is\nconsistent with expansion in a medium with a large scale density gradient. The\nremnant is known to be interacting with a molecular cloud (from the presence of\nOH(1720 MHz) masers), but this interaction is probably limited to the central\nportion of the SNR, as seen in SNR IC 443.

Comparison of the\nX-ray image with that of the previously known radio halo reveals a coincidence\nof the leading edge of the halo with the bow shock, offering an interesting\nexperimental setup for determining the role of shocks in the radio halo\ngeneration. The halo in A520 apparently consists of two spatially distinct\nparts, the main turbulence-driven component and a cap-like forward structure\nrelated to the shock, where the latter may provide pre-energized electrons for\nsubsequent turbulent re-acceleration. The radio edge may be caused by electron\nacceleration by the shock. If so, the synchrotron spectrum should have a slope\nof 1.2 right behind the edge with quick steepening further away from the edge.\nAlternatively, if shocks are inefficient accelerators, the radio edge may be\nexplained by an increase in the magnetic field and density of pre-existing\nrelativistic electrons due to gas compression. In the latter model, there\nshould be radio emission in front of the shock with the same spectrum as that\nbehind it, but 10-20 times fainter. If future sensitive radio measurements do\nnot find such pre-shock emission, then the electrons are indeed accelerated (or\nre-accelerated) by the shock, and one will be able to determine its\nacceleration efficiency.

The survey data are being\nuniformly processed, and released in stages through the WFCAM Science Archive\n(WSA : http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and\nthe UKIDSS consortium collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small\nscience verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera.\nWe show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely\npower of the eventual complete survey.

The early afterglow shows\nvariability at early times and shows a steepening at ~0.1 days (8.6 ks) in the\nB, V, r', R, i', I, J and K passbands. The early afterglow light curve decayed\nwith alpha_1 = -0.60+/-0.07 and alpha_2 = -1.71+/-0.06 based on R and I band\ndata.

The presence of the magnetic field leads to\ndifferent dispersion relations for different polarizations, which in turn imply\nFaraday rotation of gravitational waves. \n\n"}

The kinetic regime precedes the radiation dominated epoch and\nintroduces an important new feature into the spectrum of relic gravity waves\ncreated quantum mechanically during inflation. The gravity wave spectrum\nincreases with wavenumber for wavelengths shorter than the comoving horizon\nscale at the commencement of the radiative regime. This `blue tilt' is a\ngeneric feature of models with steep potentials and imposes strong constraints\non a class of inflationary braneworld models.

Previous investigations have been mostly\ncarried out in the Regge-Wheeler gauge. However, in this gauge the process of\nlinearizing the Einstein field equations leads to perturbation equations which\nas such cannot be used to perform numerical time evolutions. It is only through\nthe tedious process of combining and rearranging the perturbation variables in\na clever way that the system can be cast into a set of hyperbolic first order\nequations, which is then well suited for the numerical integration. The\nequations remain quite lengthy, and we therefore rederive the perturbation\nequations in a different gauge, which has been first proposed by Battiston et\nal. (1970). Using the ADM formalism, one is immediately lead to a first order\nhyperbolic evolution system, which is remarkably simple and can be numerically\nintegrated without many further manipulations. Moreover, the symmetry between\nthe polar and the axial equations becomes directly apparent. \n\n"}

A dynamical bar-mode (m=2) instability is observed when the ratio\nof rotational kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy $\\beta$ of the\nneutron star is greater than the critical value $\\beta_d \\approx 0.25$. This\nbar-mode instability leads to the emission of gravitational radiation that\ncould be detected by gravitational wave detectors. However, these sources are\nunlikely to be detected by LIGO II interferometers if the event rate is less\nthan $10^{-6}$ per year per galaxy. Nevertheless, if a significant fraction of\nthe pre-supernova cores are rapidly rotating, there would be a substantial\nnumber of neutron stars produced by the core collapse undergoing bar-mode\ninstability.

The expected amplitudes of relic gravitational\nwaves are different in different frequency windows, and therefore the\ntechniques and prospects of their detection are different.

Abstract: Prompted by recent solar and atmospheric data, we re-analyze the\nfour-neutrino description of current global neutrino oscillation data,\nincluding the LSND evidence for oscillations. The higher degree of rejection\nfor non-active solar and atmospheric oscillation solutions implied by the SNO\nneutral current result as well as by the latest 1489-day Super-K atmospheric\nneutrino data allows us to rule out (2+2) oscillation schemes proposed to\nreconcile LSND with the rest of current neutrino oscillation data. Using an\nimproved goodness of fit (gof) method especially sensitive to the combination\nof data sets we obtain a gof of only 1.6 times 10^{-6} for (2+2) schemes.\nFurther, we re-evaluate the status of (3+1) oscillations using two different\nanalyses of the LSND data sample. We find that also (3+1) schemes are strongly\ndisfavoured by the data. Depending on the LSND analysis we obtain a gof of 5.6\ntimes 10^{-3} or 7.6 times 10^{-5}. This leads to the conclusion that all\nfour-neutrino descriptions of the LSND anomaly, both in (2+2) as well as (3+1)\nrealizations, are highly disfavoured.
