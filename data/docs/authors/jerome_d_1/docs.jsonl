Nevertheless, the efficiency most of them is still based on the\nfundamental physical phenomena, such as resonances. Thus, the understanding of\nthe resonance phenomena will be beneficial. One of the well-known examples is\nthe resonant enhancement of the transmission known as Breit-Wigner resonances,\nwhich can be described by a Lorentzian function. But, in many physical systems\nthe scattering of waves involves propagation along different paths, and, as a\nconsequence, results in interference phenomena, where constructive interference\ncorresponds to resonant enhancement and destructive interference to resonant\nsuppression of the transmission. Recently, a variety of experimental and\ntheoretical work has revealed such patterns in different branches of physics.\nThe purpose of this Review is to demonstrate that this kind of resonant\nscattering is related to the Fano resonances, known from atomic physics. One of\nthe main features of the Fano resonances is the asymmetric profile. The\nasymmetry comes from the close coexistence of resonant transmission and\nresonant reflection. Fano successfully explained such a phenomenon in his\nseminal paper in 1961 in terms of interaction of a discrete (localized) state\nwith a continuum of propagation modes. It allows to describe both resonant\nenhancement and resonant suppression in a unified manner. All of these\nproperties can be demonstrated in the frame of a very simple model, which will\nbe used throughout the Review to show that resonant reflections observed in\ndifferent complex systems are indeed closely related to the Fano resonances. \n\n"}

In order to further\ntest this chiral stacking hypothesis it is necessary to develop an\nunderstanding of the physical mechanism by which chirality generates gyrotropy.\nIn this paper we show that optical gyrotropy is a consequence of Berry\ncurvature in the momentum space of chiral metals.

Compared to the iron pnictides,\nthese systems have only electron Fermi pockets (i.e. no hole Fermi pockets) but\ncomparable superconducting transition temperatures. The challenge lies in\nreconciling the two basic experimental features of their superconducting state:\na node-less gap and the existence of a resonance in the spin excitation\nspectrum. We propose a mechanism based on reconstructing two quasi-degenerate\npairing states, one in an $s$-wave $A_{1g}$ channel that is fully gapped, and\nthe other in a $d$-wave $B_{1g}$ channel whose pairing function changes sign\nacross the electron Fermi pockets at the Brillouin-zone boundary. The resulting\nintermediate pairing state, which we call an orbital-selective $s \\times\n\\tau_3$ state, incorporates both of the above two properties.

The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings. These\nprinciples explain why the unconventional high T_c superconductivity appears to\nbe such a rare but robust phenomena with its strict requirement on electronic\nenvironment.

Generically, these systems can be viewed as HF systems\nor HF compounds, in that they exhibit typical behavior of HF metals.

We report high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and\nab-initio phonon calculations of {\\ceaual}, an archetypal fluctuating valence\ncompound. The high resolution of our data allows us to quantify the energy\nscales of three coupling mechanisms between phonons, CEF-split localized 4f\nelectron states, and conduction electrons. Although these interactions do not\nappear to be atypically strong for this class of materials, we resolve, for the\nfirst time, a profound renormalization of low-energy quasiparticle excitations\non all levels. The key anomalies of the spectrum we observe comprise (1) the\nformation of a CEF-phonon bound state with a comparatively low density of\nacoustic phonons reminiscent of vibronic modes observed in other materials,\nwhere they require a pronounced abundance of optical phonons, (2) an\nanti-crossing of CEF states and acoustic phonons, and (3) a strong broadening\nof CEF states due to the hybridization with more itinerant excitations. The\nfact that all of these features are well resolved in CeAuAl$_3$ suggests that\nsimilar hybrid excitations should also be dominant in a large family of related\nmaterials. This promises a predictive understanding towards the discovery of\nnew magneto-elastic functionalities and instabilities. \n\n"}

Their kinematics is determined by constraints of topological\norigin. An example is the glide motion of dislocations which has been\nextensively studied by metallurgists. In a recent theoretical study dealing\nwith quantum dualities associated with the quantum melting of solids it was\nargued that these kinematic constraints play a central role in defining the\nquantum field theories of relevance to the description of quantum liquid\ncrystalline states of the nematic type. This forms the motivation to analyze\nmore thoroughly the climb constraints underlying the glide motions. In the\nsetting of continuum field theory the climb constraint is equivalent to the\ncondition that the density of constituent particles is vanishing and we derive\na mathematical definition of this constraint which has a universal status. This\nmakes possible to study the kinematics of dislocations in arbitrary space-time\ndimensions and as an example we analyze the restricted climb associated with\nedge dislocations in 3+1D. Very generally, it can be shown that the climb\nconstraint is equivalent to the condition that dislocations do not communicate\nwith compressional stresses at long distances.

To elucidate this long-standing issue, we\nstudy a Hubbard model with a strong onsite impurity potential based on an\nimproved fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation, which we call the GV^I-FLEX\nmethod. This model corresponds to the HTSC with dilute nonmagnetic impurity\nconcentration. We find that (i) both local and staggered susceptibilities are\nstrongly enhanced around the impurity. By this reason, (ii) the quasiparticle\nlifetime as well as the local density of states (DOS) are strongly suppressed\nin a wide area around the impurity (like a Swiss cheese hole), which causes the\n``huge residual resistivity'' beyond the s-wave unitary scattering limit. We\nstress that the excess quasiparticle damping rate caused by impurities has\nstrong momentum-dependence due to non-s-wave scatterings induced by many-body\neffects, so the structure of the ``hot spot/cold spot'' in the host system\npersists against impurity doping.

Based on the scalar\nproducts, the determinant representations of the correlation functions may be\nobtained. As an example, in this review, we give the determinant\nrepresentations of the two-point correlation function for the $\\gl$ (i.e.\nq-deformed) supersymmetric t-J model. The determinant representations are\nuseful for analysing physical properties of the integrable models in the\nthermodynamical limit. \n\n"}

I shall take a practical\napproach, concentrating more on explicit examples rather than formal\ndevelopments. Topics covered are divided in three sections: (I) Algebraic\ngeometry on two-dimensional exactly solvable statistical lattice models and its\nrelated Hamiltonians: I will report results on the algebraic geometry of\nrapidity curves appeared in the chiral Potts model, and the algebraic Bethe\nAnsatz equation in connection with quantum inverse scattering method for the\nrelated one-dimensional Hamiltonion chain, e.g., XXZ, Hofstadter type\nHamiltonian. (II) Infinite symmetry algebras arising from quantum spin chain\nand conformal field theory: I will explain certain progress made on Onsager\nalgebra, the relation with the superintegrable chiral Potts quantum chain and\nproblems on its spectrum. In conformal field theory, mathematical aspects of\ncharacters of N=2 superconformal algebra are discussed, especially on the\nmodular invariant property connected to the theory. (III). Algebraic geometry\nproblems on orbifolds stemming from string theory: I will report recent\nprogress on crepant resolutions of quotient singularity of dimension greater\nthan or equal to three. The direction of present-day research of engaging\nfinite group representations in the geometry of orbifolds is briefly reviewed,\nand the mathematical aspect of various formulas on the topology of string\nvacuum will be discussed. \n\n"}

C. Zhang's SO(5) theory of high temperature superconductivity and\nantiferromagnetism. We consider both a full Ginzburg-Landau theory (with\nGinzburg-Landau scaling parameter kappa) and a high-kappa limiting model. In\nall cases we find that the usual superconducting vortices (with normal phase in\nthe central core region) become unstable (not energy minimizing) when the\nchemical potential crosses a threshold level, giving rise to a new vortex\nprofile with antiferromagnetic ordering in the core region. We show that this\nphase transition in the cores is due to a bifurcation from a simple eigenvalue\nof the linearized equations. In the limiting large kappa model we prove that\nthe antiferromagnetic core solutions are always nondegenerate local energy\nminimizers and prove an exact multiplicity result for physically relevent\nsolutions. \n\n"}

The self-consistent mean field of the\nvalence electrons is modeled by an axially deformed cavity and the oscillating\npart of the total energy is calculated semiclassically using the shortest\nperiodic orbits. The average energy is obtained from a liquid-drop model\nadjusted to the empirical bulk and surface properties of the sodium metal. We\nobtain good qualitative agreement with the results of quantum-mechanical\ncalculations using Strutinsky's shell-correction method. \n\n"}

The\nrelevant dynamical variables are expressed in the form of a quantum state\nvector which includes the action of the classical subsystem in its phase\nfactor. It is shown that the statistical ensemble of Brownian state vectors for\na quantum particle in a classical thermal environment can be described by a\ndensity matrix evolving according to a nonlinear quantum Fokker-Planck\nequation. Exact solutions of this equation are obtained for a two-level system\nin the limit of high temperatures, considering both stationary and\nnonstationary initial states. A treatment of the common time shared by the\nquantum system and its classical environment, as a collective variable rather\nthan as a parameter, is presented in the Appendix. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0702032", "contents": "Title: Two-level systems driven by large-amplitude fields Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of a two-level system subject to driving by\nlarge-amplitude external fields, focusing on the resonance properties in the\ncase of driving around the region of avoided level crossing. In particular, we\nconsider three main questions that characterize resonance dynamics: (1) the\nresonance condition, (2) the frequency of the resulting oscillations on\nresonance and (3) the width of the resonance. We identify the regions of\nvalidity of different approximations. In a large region of the parameter space,\nwe use a geometric picture in order to obtain both a simple understanding of\nthe dynamics and quantitative results. The geometric approach is obtained by\ndividing the evolution into discrete time steps, with each time step described\nby either a phase shift on the basis states or a coherent mixing process\ncorresponding to a Landau-Zener crossing. We compare the results of the\ngeometric picture with those of a rotating-wave approximation. We also comment\nbriefly on the prospects of employing strong driving as a useful tool to\nmanipulate two-level systems. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0702109", "contents": "Title: Vector Cooper Pairs and Coherent-Population-Trapping-like States in\n  Ensemble of Interacting Fermions Abstract: Using the standard Hamiltonian of the BCS theory, we show that in an ensemble\nof interacting fermions with the spin 1/2 there exist coherent states $|NC>$,\nwhich nullify the Hamiltonian of the interparticle interaction (scattering).\nThese states have an analogy with the well-known in quantum optics the coherent\npopulation trapping (CPT) effect. The structure of these CPT-like states\ncorresponds to Cooper pairs with the total spin $S$=1. The found states have a\nhuge degree of degeneracy and carry a macroscopic magnetic moment, that allows\nus to construct a new model of the magnetism connected with the delocalized\nelectrons in metals (conductors). A principal possibility to apply the obtained\nresults to the superfluid $^3$He is also demonstrated. \n\n"}

The expulsive force observed at the border of the shielded zone is due\nto energy conservation. \n\n"}
