Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

Because tidally locked hot Jupiters would\nhave enormous day-night temperature differences in the absence of winds, the\nsmall amplitude of the observed phase variation indicates that the planet's\natmosphere efficiently transports thermal energy from the day side to the night\nside at the 24 micron photosphere, leading to modest day-night temperature\ndifferences. The similarities between the 8 and 24 micron phase curves for HD\n189733b lead us to conclude that the circulation on this planet behaves in a\nfundamentally similar fashion across the range of pressures sensed by these two\nwavelengths. One-dimensional radiative transfer models indicate that the 8\nmicron band should probe pressures 2-3 times greater than at 24 micron,\nalthough the uncertain methane abundance complicates the interpretation. If\nthese two bandpasses do probe different pressures, it would indicate that the\ntemperature varies only weakly between the two sensed depths, and hence that\nthe atmosphere is not convective at these altitudes.

The main new element of this study is that we used\nfully three dimensional (3-D) numerical simulations. We consider hydrodynamics\nof inviscid accretion flows. We assume a spherically symmetric density\ndistribution at the outer boundary, but brake the flow symmetry by introducing\na small, latitude-dependent angular momentum. We also consider cases where\nangular momentum at large radii is latitude- and azimuth-dependent. For the\nlatitude-dependent angular momentum, 3-D simulations confirm axisymmetric\nresults: the material that has too much angular momentum to be accreted forms a\nthick torus near the equator. Consequently, accretion proceeds only through the\npolar funnel, and the mass accretion rate through the funnel is constrained by\nthe size and shape of the torus, not by the outer conditions. In 3-D\nsimulations, we found that the torus precesses, even for axisymmetric\nconditions at large radii. For the latitude and azimuth-dependent angular\nmomentum, the non-rotating gas near the equator can also significantly affect\nthe evolution of the rotating gas. In particular, it may prevent the formation\nof a proper torus (i.e. its closing, in the azimuthal direction). In such\nmodels, the mass accretion rate is only slightly less than the corresponding\nBondi rate. \n\n"}

It was proposed that the (asymmetric) supernova\nexplosion unbind the system and that the secondary star (HD271791) was released\nat its orbital velocity in the direction of Galactic rotation. In this Letter\nwe show that to explain the Galactic rest-frame velocity of HD271791 within the\nframework of the binary-supernova scenario, the stellar remnant of the\nsupernova explosion (a $\\la$ 10 Msun black hole) should receive an\nunrealistically large kick velocity of $\\geq$ 750-1200 km/s$.

Model results point to ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs)\nfrom supermassive black holes at about the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) energy\nthreshold from low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), and to high-energy\nphoton emissions from stellar mass black holes in ultra-relativistic capillary\njets.

We investigate how upcoming astrophysical experiments will\nexplore the existence of such axions over a vast mass range from 10^-33eV to\n10^-10eV. Axions with masses between 10^-33eV to 10^-28eV cause a rotation of\nthe CMB polarization that is constant throughout the sky. The predicted\nrotation angle is of order \\alpha~1/137. Axions in the mass range 10^-28eV to\n10^-18eV give rise to multiple steps in the matter power spectrum, that will be\nprobed by upcoming galaxy surveys. Axions in the mass range 10^-22eV to\n10^-10eV affect the dynamics and gravitational wave emission of rapidly\nrotating astrophysical black holes through the Penrose superradiance process.\nWhen the axion Compton wavelength is of order of the black hole size, the\naxions develop \"superradiant\" atomic bound states around the black hole\n\"nucleus\".

Abstract: Many young extra-galactic clusters have a measured velocity dispersion that\nis too high for the mass derived from their age and total luminosity, which has\nled to the suggestion that they are not in virial equilibrium. Most of these\nclusters are confined to a narrow age range centred around 10 Myr because of\nobservational constraints. At this age the cluster light is dominated by\nluminous evolved stars, such as red supergiants, with initial masses of ~13-22\nMsun for which (primordial) binarity is high. In this study we investigate to\nwhat extent the observed excess velocity dispersion is the result of the\norbital motions of binaries. We demonstrate that estimates for the dynamical\nmass of young star clusters, derived from the observed velocity dispersion,\nexceed the photometric mass by up-to a factor of 10 and are consistent with a\nconstant offset in the square of the velocity dispersion. This can be\nreproduced by models of virialised star clusters hosting a massive star\npopulation of which ~25 is in binaries, with typical mass ratios of ~0.6 and\nperiods of ~1000 days.

Our hypothesis is\nthat dynamical evolution in outer planetary systems is controlled by a\ncombination of planet-planet scattering and planetary interactions with an\nexterior disk of small bodies (\"planetesimals\"). Using 5,000 long duration\nN-body simulations, we follow the evolution of three planets surrounded by a 50\nEarth mass primordial planetesimal disk. For large planet masses (above that of\nSaturn) the influence of the disk is modest, and we recover the observed\neccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets (observed primarily at smaller\nradii). We explain the observed mass dependence of the eccentricity by invoking\nstrong correlations between planet masses in the same system. For lower mass\nplanets we observe diverse dynamical behavior: strong scattering events, sudden\njumps in eccentricity due to resonance crossings, and re-circularization of\nscattered low-mass planets in the disk. We present distributions of the final\neccentricity and inclination, and discuss how they vary with planet mass and\ninitial system architecture.

Abstract: In planetary nebulae, abundances of oxygen and other heavy elements derived\nfrom optical recombination lines are systematically higher than those derived\nfrom collisionally excited lines. We investigate the hypothesis that the\ndestruction of solid bodies may produce pockets of cool, high-metallicity gas\nthat could explain these abundance discrepancies. Under the assumption of\nmaximally efficient radiative ablation, we derive two fundamental constraints\nthat the solid bodies must satisfy in order that their evaporation during the\nplanetary nebula phase should generate a high enough gas phase metallicity. A\nlocal constraint implies that the bodies must be larger than tens of meters,\nwhile a global constraint implies that the total mass of the solid body\nreservoir must exceed a few hundredths of a solar mass. This mass greatly\nexceeds the mass of any population of comets or large debris particles expected\nto be found orbiting evolved low- to intermediate-mass stars. We therefore\nconclude that contemporaneous solid body destruction cannot explain the\nobserved abundance discrepancies in planetary nebulae. However, similar\narguments applied to the sublimation of solid bodies during the preceding\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase do not lead to such a clear-cut conclusion.\nIn this case, the required reservoir of volatile solids is only one\nten-thousandth of a solar mass, which is comparable to the most massive debris\ndisks observed around solar-type stars, implying that this mechanism may\ncontribute to abundance discrepancies in at least some planetary nebulae, so\nlong as mixing of the high metallicity gas is inefficient. \n\n"}

First, we model\nthe observations with a dusty wind-blown bubble, and then ask whether dust\ncould survive within N49 to its present age (estimated to be 5x10^5 to 10^6\nyears). We find that dust sputtering and especially dust-gas friction would\nimply relatively short timescales (t ~ 10^4 years) for dust survival in the\nwind-shocked region of the bubble. To explain the 24 micron emission, we\npostulate that the grains are replenished within the wind-blown bubble by\ndestruction of embedded, dense cloudlets of ISM gas that have been over-run by\nthe expanding wind-blown bubble. We calculate the ablation timescales for\ncloudlets within N49 and find approximate parameters for the embedded cloudlets\nthat can replenish the dust; the parameters for the cloudlets are roughly\nsimilar to those observed in other nebula. Such dust will have an important\neffect on the bubble: including simple dust cooling in a wind-blown bubble\nmodel for N49, we find that the luminosity is higher by approximately a factor\nof six at a bubble age of about 10^4 years. At ages of 10^7 years, the energy\ncontained in the bubble is lower by about a factor of eight if dust is\nincluded; if dust must be replenished within the bubble, the associated\naccompanying gas mass will also be very important to wind-blown bubble cooling\nand evolution.

By Binary model we refer both to\nstellar and substellar companions that enhance the mass loss rate, where\nsubstellar companions stand for both massive planets and brown dwarfs.

We reach\nthis conclusion by noticing that the bimodal distribution of planets around\nstars with respect to the parameter M_p*a^2, is most prominent for stars in the\nmass range 1Mo < M < 1.5Mo; 'a' is the orbital separation, 'M' is the stellar\nmass and 'M_p' the planet mass. This is also the mass range of the progenitors\nof EHB stars that are formed through the interaction of their progenitors with\nplanets (assuming the EHB formation mechanism is the binary model).

Although this model (the DLH model) contains scalar field\nmatter, it is reminiscent of the Taub-NUT vacuum solution in that it has\nbiaxial Bianchi IX geometry and its evolution exhibits a dimensionality\nreduction at a quasi-regular singularity that one can identify with the\nbig-bang. We show that the DLH and Taub-NUT metrics are related by a coordinate\ntransformation, in which the DLH time coordinate plays the role of conformal\ntime for Taub-NUT. Since both models continue through the big-bang, the\ncoordinate transformation can become multivalued. In particular, in mapping\nfrom DLH to Taub-NUT, the Taub-NUT time can take only positive values. We\npresent explicit maps between the DLH and Taub-NUT models, with and without a\nscalar field. In the vacuum DLH model, we find a periodic solution expressible\nin terms of elliptic integrals. Mapping the vacuum solution over to Taub-NUT\ncoordinates, recovers the standard (non-periodic) Taub-NUT solution in the Taub\nregion, where Taub-NUT time takes positive values, but does not exhibit the two\nNUT regions known in the standard Taub-NUT solution. Conversely, mapping the\ncomplete Taub-NUT solution to the DLH case reveals that the NUT regions\ncorrespond to imaginary time and space in DLH coordinates. We show that many of\nthe well-known `pathologies' of the Taub-NUT solution arise because the\ntraditional coordinates are connected by a multivalued transformation to the\nphysically more meaningful DLH coordinates.

If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime,\nthen we find that most of the cycle amplitudes also get modeled up to some\nextent when we model the periods. Next, we propose that at the beginning of the\nMaunder minimum the amplitude of meridional circulation dropped to a low value\nand then after a few years it increased again. Several independent studies also\nfavor this assumption. With this assumption, a diffusion-dominated dynamo is\nable to reproduce many important features of the Maunder minimum remarkably\nwell. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime, then a slower\nmeridional circulation means that the poloidal field gets more time to diffuse\nduring its transport through the convection zone, making the dynamo weaker.\nThis consequence helps to model both the cycle amplitudes and the Maunder-like\nminima.

We present evidence\nindicating that both the yield and rate of star formation can vary considerably\nin local clouds, independent of their mass and size. We find that the surface\ndensity structure of such clouds appears to be important in controlling both\nthese factors. In particular, we find that the star formation rate (SFR) in\nmolecular clouds is linearly proportional to the cloud mass (M_{0.8}) above an\nextinction threshold of A_K approximately equal to 0.8 magnitudes,\ncorresponding to a gas surface density threshold of approximaely 116 solar\nmasses per square pc. We argue that this surface density threshold corresponds\nto a gas volume density threshold which we estimate to be n(H_2) approximately\nequal to 10^4\\cc.

We show\nthat the radiation fields vary much less with angle than the matter quantities\nin the region of net neutrino heating. This obtains because most neutrinos are\nemitted from inner radiative regions and because the specific intensity is an\nintegral over sources from many angles at depth. The latter effect can only be\ncaptured by multi-angle transport. We then compute the phase relationship\nbetween dipolar oscillations in the shock radius and in matter and radiation\nquantities throughout the postshock region.

These RAVE iron abundances are accurate enough to obviate\nthe need for confirmatory higher-resolution spectroscopy. Our initial study has\nidentified 631 stars with [Fe/H] <= -2, from a RAVE database containing\napproximately 200,000 stars. This RAVE-based sample is complete for stars with\n[Fe/H] < -2.5, allowing statistical sample analysis. We identify three stars\nwith [Fe/H] <= -4. Of these, one was already known to be `ultra metal-poor',\none is a known carbon-enhanced metal-poor star, but we obtain [Fe/H]= -4.0,\nrather than the published [Fe/H]=-3.3, and derive [C/Fe] = +0.9, and [N/Fe] =\n+3.2, and the third is at the limit of our S/N.

The\nsystem revolves in an eccentric orbit with a periodicity of 140.7 days. The\nsecondary has a similar temperature but is less evolved and fainter than the\nprimary.

Using high-resolution spectroscopic data\nrecently obtained with the Elodie (OHP, France) and Hermes (ORM, La Palma,\nSpain) spectrographs, and applying a spectra disentangling algorithm to three\nindependent data sets including spectra from the Oak Ridge Observatory (USA),\nwe derived an improved spectroscopic orbit and refined the solution by\nperforming a combined astrometric-spectroscopic analysis based on the new\nspectroscopy and the long-baseline data from the Mark III optical\ninterferometer. As a result, the velocity amplitude of the fainter component is\nobtained in a direct and objective way. Major progress based on this new\ndetermination includes an improved computation of the orbital parallax.

Recent studies\nhave shown that magnetic braking is strong enough to suppress the formation of\nrotationally supported disks in the ideal MHD limit. Whether non-ideal MHD\neffects can enable disk formation remains unsettled. We carry out a first study\non how disk formation in magnetic clouds is modified by the Hall effect, the\nleast explored of the three non-ideal MHD effects in star formation (the other\ntwo being ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation). For illustrative\npurposes, we consider a simplified problem of a non-self-gravitating,\nmagnetized envelope collapsing onto a central protostar of fixed mass. We find\nthat the Hall effect can spin up the inner part of the collapsing flow to\nKeplerian speed, producing a rotationally supported disk. The disk is generated\nthrough a Hall-induced magnetic torque. Disk formation occurs even when the\nenvelope is initially non-rotating, provided that the Hall coefficient is large\nenough. When the magnetic field orientation is flipped, the direction of disk\nrotation is reversed as well. The implication is that the Hall effect can in\nprinciple produce both regularly rotating and counter-rotating disks around\nprotostars.

In the hard state, the dominant spectral\nvariability is a changing of normalisation with fixed spectral shape, while in\nthe intermediate state the slope changes, with a pivot point around 10 keV. In\nthe soft state, the low energy X-ray emission dominates the bolometric flux\nwhich is only loosely correlated with the high energy emission. In black hole\nbinaries in the hard state, the radio flux is generally found to depend on a\npower of the X-ray flux, F_R ~ F_X^p. We confirm this for Cyg X-1. Our new\nfinding is that this correlation extends to the intermediate and soft states\nprovided the broad-band X-ray flux in the Comptonization part of the spectrum\n(excluding the blackbody component) is considered instead of a narrow-band\nmedium-energy X-ray flux. We find an index p=1.7+-0.1 for 15 GHz radio\nemission, decreasing to p=1.5+-0. at 2.25 GHz. We conclude that the higher\nvalue at 15 GHz is due to the effect of free-free absorption in the wind from\nthe companion. The intrinsic correlation index remains uncertain. However,\nbased on a theoretical model of the wind in Cyg X-1, it appears to be close to\n1.3, which, in the framework of accretion/jet models, implies that the\naccretion flow in Cyg X-1 is radiatively efficient. The correlation with the\nflux due to Comptonization emission indicates that the radio jet is launched by\nthe hot electrons in the accretion flow in all spectral states of Cyg X-1. On\nthe other hand, we rule out the X-ray jet model. Finally, we find that the\nindex of the correlation, when measured using the X-ray flux in a narrow energy\nband, strongly depends on the band chosen and is, in general, different from\nthat for either the bolometric flux or the flux in the hot-electron emission. \n\n"}

During the rapid inspiral phase, the interaction of the companion\nwith the red giant's extended atmosphere causes about 25% of the common\nenvelope to be ejected from the system, with mass continuing to be lost at the\nend of the simulation at a rate ~ 2 Msun/yr.

Our analysis of all\nfourteen Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of V1647 Ori demonstrate that\nvariations in the X-ray luminosity of V1647 Ori are correlated with similar\nchanges in the OIR brightness of this source during both (2003-2005 and 2008)\neruptions, strongly supporting the hypothesis that accretion is the primary\ngeneration mechanism for the X-ray outbursts. Furthermore, the Chandra\nmonitoring demonstrates that the X-ray spectral properties of the second\neruption were strikingly similar to those of the 2003 eruption. We find that\nX-ray spectra obtained immediately following the second outburst - during which\nV1647 Ori exhibited high X-ray luminosities, high hardness ratios, and strong\nX-ray variability - are well modeled as a heavily absorbed (N_H ~ 4x10^22\ncm^-2), single-component plasma with characteristic temperatures (kT_X ~ 2-6\nkeV) that are consistently too high to be generated via accretion shocks but\nare in the range expected for plasma heated by magnetic reconnection events.

Most\nplausible explanation of this phenomena is an assumption that the magnetic\nfield at the stellar surface differs essentially from the purely dipolar field.\nWe can determine magnetic field at the surface by the conservation of the\nmagnetic flux through the area bounded by open magnetic field lines.

We start from a review\nof time-evolutionary equations of the four components, and then, we present\nsimple recipes for the stellar remnant mass and yields of metal and dust based\non models of stellar nucleosynthesis and dust formation. After calibrating some\nmodel parameters with the data from the solar neighborhood, we have confirmed a\nshortage of the stellar dust production rate relative to the dust destruction\nrate by supernovae if the destruction efficiency suggested by theoretical works\nis correct. If the dust mass growth by material accretion in molecular clouds\nis active, the observed dust amount in the solar neighborhood is reproduced.

Thus, the dust content is\nindependent of the uncertainty of the stellar dust yield after the growth\nactivation. The timing of the activation is determined by a critical metal mass\nfraction which depends on the growth and destruction efficiencies.

Abstract: Direct collapse of supermassive stars (SMSs) is a possible pathway for\ngenerating supermassive black holes in the early universe. It is expected that\nan SMS could form via very rapid mass accretion with Mdot ~ 0.1 - 1 Msun/yr\nduring the gravitational collapse of an atomic-cooling primordial gas cloud. In\nthis paper we study how stars would evolve under such extreme rapid mass\naccretion, focusing on the early evolution until the stellar mass reaches 1000\nMsun. To this end we numerically calculate the detailed interior structure of\naccreting stars with primordial element abundances. Our results show that for\naccretion rates higher than 0.01 Msun/yr, stellar evolution is qualitatively\ndifferent from that expected at lower rates. While accreting at these high\nrates the star always has a radius exceeding 100 Rsun, which increases\nmonotonically with the stellar mass. The mass-radius relation for stellar\nmasses exceeding ~ 100 Msun follows the same track with R_* \\propto M_*^0.5 in\nall cases with accretion rates > 0.01 Msun/yr; at a stellar mass of 1000 Msun\nthe radius is about 7000 Rsun (~= 30 AU). With higher accretion rates the onset\nof hydrogen burning is shifted towards higher stellar masses. In particular,\nfor accretion rates exceeding Mdot > 0.1 Msun/yr, there is no significant\nhydrogen burning even after 1000 Msun have accreted onto the protostar. Such\n\"supergiant\" protostars have effective temperatures as low as Teff ~= 5000 K\nthroughout their evolution and because they hardly emit ionizing photons, they\ndo not create an HII region or significantly heat their immediate surroundings.\nThus, radiative feedback is unable to hinder the growth of rapidly accreting\nstars to masses in excess of 1000 Msun, as long as material is accreted at\nrates Mdot > 0.01 Msun/yr. \n\n"}

Based on dynamical considerations alone, we find that the\nsubenergetic models favor a distance to the SNR of < 6.4 kpc, while the model\nthat produces 1 M_sun of 56Ni requires a distance to the SNR of > 7 kpc. The\nX-ray spectrum is consistent with an explosion that produced ~ 1 M_sun of 56Ni,\nruling out the subenergetic models, and suggesting that Kepler's SNR was a SN\n1991T-like event. Additionally, the X-ray spectrum rules out a pure 1/r^2 wind\nprofile expected from isotropic mass loss up to the time of the supernova.\nIntroducing a small cavity around the progenitor system results in modeled\nX-ray spectra that are consistent with the observed spectrum. If a wind shaped\ncircumstellar environment is necessary to explain the dynamics and X-ray\nemission from the shocked ejecta in Kepler's SNR, then we require that the\ndistance to the remnant be greater than 7 kpc. \n\n"}

We\ncompare three WDM models with a dark matter mass of 0.5, 0.75 and 2.0 keV, with\nthe standard Cold Dark Matter case. For a fixed set of parameters describing\nthe baryonic physics the WDM models predict less galaxies at low (stellar)\nmasses, as expected due to the suppression of power on small scales, while no\nsubstantial difference is found at the high mass end. However these differences\nin the stellar mass function, vanish when different set of parameters are used\nto describe the (largely unknown) galaxy formation processes.

The\nmagnitudes of the flares associated with the eruptions range from the\nGOES-class B to X. Owing to the high-sensitivity and broad temperature coverage\nof the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard SDO, we are able to identify\nboth the contracting and erupting components of the eruptions: the former is\nobserved in cold AIA channels as the contracting coronal loops overlying the\nelbows of the sigmoid, and the latter is preferentially observed in warm/hot\nAIA channels as an expanding bubble originating from the center of the sigmoid.\nThe initiation of eruption always precedes the contraction, and in the\nenergetically mild events (B and C flares), it also precedes the increase in\nGOES soft X-ray fluxes.

In this\nregime the accreting matter settles down subsonically onto the rotating\nmagnetosphere, forming an extended quasi-static shell. The shell mediates the\nangular momentum removal from the rotating NS magnetosphere by shear turbulent\nviscosity in the boundary layer or via large-scale convective motions. In the\nlast case the differential rotation law in the shell is close to\niso-angular-momentum rotation. The accretion rate through the shell is\ndetermined by the ability of the plasma to enter the magnetosphere due to\nRayleigh-Taylor instabilities while taking cooling into account. Measurements\nof spin-up/spin-down rates of quasi-spherically wind accreting XPSRs in\nequilibrium with known orbital periods (like e.g. GX 301-2 and Vela X-1) enable\ndetermination of the main dimensionless parameters of the model and the NS\nmagnetic field. For equilibrium pulsars with independent measurements of the\nmagnetic field, the stellar wind velocity from the companion can be estimated\nwithout the use of complicated spectroscopic measurements. For non-equilibrium\npulsars, a maximum possible spin-down torque exerted on the accreting NS\nexists. From observations of the spin-down rate and X-ray luminosity in such\npulsars (GX 1+4, SXP 1062, 4U 2206+54, etc.) a lower limit on the NS magnetic\nfield is derived, which in all cases turns out to be close to the standard one\nand in agreement with cyclotron line measurements.

However, the\ntypical L* satellite galaxy resides in much lower mass galaxy groups, where the\nprocesses capable of altering their evolution are generally weaker and have had\nless time to operate. To investigate the extent to which satellite and central\ngalaxy evolution differs, we separately model the stellar mass - halo mass (M*\n-Mh) relation for these two populations over the redshift interval 0 < z < 1.\nThis relation for central galaxies is constrained by the galaxy stellar mass\nfunction while the relation for satellite galaxies is constrained against\nrecent measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function (2PCF). At z ~\n0 the satellites, on average, have ~10% larger stellar masses at fixed peak\nsubhalo mass compared to central galaxies of the same halo mass. This is\nrequired in order to reproduce the observed stellar mass-dependent 2PCF and\nsatellite fractions. At low masses our model slightly under-predicts the\ncorrelation function at ~1 Mpc scales. At z ~ 1 the satellite and central\ngalaxy M*-Mh relations are consistent within the errors, and the model provides\nan excellent fit to the clustering data. At present, the errors on the\nclustering data at z ~ 2 are too large to constrain the satellite model. A\nsimple model in which satellite and central galaxies share the same M*-Mh\nrelation is able to reproduce the extant z ~ 2 clustering data. We speculate\nthat the striking similarity between the satellite and central galaxy M*-Mh\nrelations since z ~ 2 arises because the central galaxy relation evolves very\nweakly with time and because the stellar mass of the typical satellite galaxy\nhas not changed significantly since it was accreted.

In such cases, we show that the two limb\ndarkening coefficients are constrained by three physical boundary conditions,\ndescribing a triangular region in the two-dimensional parameter space. We show\nthat uniformly distributed samples may be drawn from this region with optimal\nefficiency by a technique developed by computer graphical programming:\ntriangular sampling. Alternatively, one can make draws using a uniform,\nbivariate Dirichlet distribution. We provide simple expressions for these\nparametrizations for both techniques applied to the case of quadratic,\nsquare-root and logarithmic limb darkening laws. For example, in the case of\nthe popular quadratic law, we advocate fitting for q_1 = (u_1+u_2)^2 and q_2 =\n0.5u_1(u_1+u_2)^{-1} with uniform priors in the interval [0,1] to implement\ntriangular sampling easily. Employing these parametrizations allows one to\nderive model parameters which fully account for our ignorance about the\nintensity profile, yet never explore unphysical solutions, yielding robust and\nrealistic uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, in the case of triangular\nsampling with the quadratic law, our parametrization leads to significantly\nreduced mutual correlations and provides an alternative geometric explanation\nas to why naively fitting the quadratic limb darkening coefficients\nprecipitates strong correlations in the first place. \n\n"}

Theory and applications to the\n  abundance analysis for 24 chemical elements Abstract: The interpretation of observed spectra of stars in terms of fundamental\nstellar properties is a key problem in astrophysics. For FGK-type stars, the\nradiative transfer models are often computed using the assumption of local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). Its validity is often questionable and needs\nto be supported by detailed studies, which build upon the consistent framework\nof non-LTE. In this review, we outline the theory of non-LTE.

Our\napproach exploits symmetry between occultations and transits, producing transit\nradius spectra that inherently include the effects of haze multiple scattering,\nrefraction, and gas absorption. We use a simple model of haze extinction to\nexplore how Titan's haze affects its transit spectrum. Our spectra show strong\nmethane absorption features, and weaker features due to other gases. Most\nimportantly, the data demonstrate that high altitude hazes can severely limit\nthe atmospheric depths probed by transit spectra, bounding observations to\npressures smaller than 0.1-10 mbar, depending on wavelength.

We\ninvestigate the origin of this phenomenon using a semi-analystical model,\nwherein the standard core accretion takes place at planet traps in protostellar\ndisks where rapid type I migrators are halted. We focus on the three major\nexoplanetary populations - hot-Jupiters, exo-Jupiters located at $r \\simeq 1$\nAU, and the low-mass planets. We show using a statistical approach that the\nplanet-metallicity correlations are well reproduced in these models. We find\nthat there are specific transition metallicities with values [Fe/H]$=-0.2$ to\n$-0.4$, below which the low-mass population dominates, and above which the\nJovian populations take over. The exo-Jupiters significantly exceed the\nhot-Jupiter population at all observed metallicities. The low-mass planets\nformed via the core accretion are insensitive to metallicity, which may account\nfor a large fraction of the observed super-Earths and hot-Neptunes. Finally, a\ncontrolling factor in building massive planets is the critical mass of\nplanetary cores ($M_{c,crit}$) that regulates the onset of runaway gas\naccretion.

Our\napproach is to use the full kinetics model to survey the parameter space with\neffective temperatures between 500 K and 1100 K. In all of these worlds\nequilibrium chemistry favors CH4 over CO in the parts of the atmosphere that\ncan be seen from Earth, but in most disequilibrium favors CO. The small surface\ngravity of a planet strongly discriminates against CH4 when compared to an\notherwise comparable brown dwarf. If vertical mixing is like Jupiter's, the\ntransition from methane to CO occurs at 500 K in a planet. Sluggish vertical\nmixing can raise this to 600 K; but clouds or more vigorous vertical mixing\ncould lower this to 400 K. The comparable thresholds in brown dwarfs are\n$1100\\pm100$ K.

We\npresent a NIR imaging (H2 and Ks) and low-resolution spectroscopic (0.95-2.50\num) survey of 18 massive jets towards GLIMPSE extended green objects, driven by\nintermediate- and high-mass YSOs, which have Lbol between 4x10^2 and 10^5 Lsun.\nAs in low-mass jets, H2 is the primary NIR coolant, detected in all the\nanalysed flows, whereas the most important ionic tracer is [FeII], detected in\nhalf of the sampled jets. Our analysis indicates that the emission lines\noriginate from shocks at high temperatures and densities. No fluorescent\nemission is detected along the flows, regardless of the source Lbol. On\naverage, the physical parameters of these massive jets (i.e. Av, temperature,\ncolumn density, mass, and luminosity) have higher values than those measured in\ntheir low-mass counterparts. The morphology of the H2 flows is varied, mostly\ndepending on the complex, dynamic, and inhomogeneous environment in which these\nmassive jets form and propagate. All flows and jets in our sample are\ncollimated, showing large precession angles. Additionally, the presence of both\nknots and jets suggests that the ejection process is continuous with burst\nepisodes, as in low-mass YSOs. We compare the flow H2 luminosity with the\nsource Lbol confirming the tight correlation between these two quantities. Five\nsources, however, display a lower L(H2)/Lbol efficiency, which might be related\nto YSO evolution. Most important, the inferred L(H2) vs Lbol relationship\nagrees well with the correlation between the momentum flux of the CO outflows\nand the bolometric luminosities of high-mass YSOs indicating that outflows from\nhigh-mass YSOs are momentum driven, as are their low-mass counterparts. \n\n"}

The\neffective temperatures are 5890 +/- 100 K (G1V) and 3880 +/- 120 K (M1V),\nrespectively. A detailed chemical analysis probing more than 20 elements in the\nprimary spectrum shows the system to have a slightly subsolar abundance, with\n[Fe/H] = -0.12 +/- 0.08. A comparison with theory reveals that standard models\nunderpredict the radius and overpredict the temperature of the secondary, as\nhas been found previously for other M dwarfs. On the other hand, models from\nthe Dartmouth series incorporating magnetic fields are able to match the\nobservations of the secondary star at the same age as the primary (3 Gyr) with\na surface field strength of 2.1 +/- 0.4 kG when using a rotational dynamo\nprescription, or 1.3 +/- 0.4 kG with a turbulent dynamo approach, not far from\nour empirical estimate for this star of 0.83 +/- 0.65 kG. The observations are\nmost consistent with magnetic fields playing only a small role in changing the\nglobal properties of the primary. The V530 Ori system thus provides an\nimportant demonstration that recent advances in modeling appear to be on the\nright track to explain the long-standing problem of radius inflation and\ntemperature suppression in low-mass stars. \n\n"}

How the mechanism producing EM emission is related to any continuous\ngravitational-wave (CW) emission is unknown; if they either interact or are\nlocked in phase then the CW will also experience timing noise. Any disparity\nbetween the signal and the search template used in matched filtering methods\nwill result in a loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), referred to as\n`mismatch'. In this work we assume the CW suffers a similar level of timing\nnoise to its EM counterpart.

The internal motions in\nthese chains are mostly subsonic and the velocity is continuous, indicating\nthat turbulence dissipation in the cloud has occurred at the scale of the\nchains and not at the smaller scale of the individual cores. The chains also\npresent an approximately constant abundance of N2H+ and radial intensity\nprofiles that can be modeled with a density law that follows a softened power\nlaw.

Continuum and C18O (2-1) emission are detected toward all\nthe sample sources and show central primary components with sizes of ~600-1,500\nAU associated with protostars. The velocity gradients in C18O (2-1) have wide\nranges of orientations from parallel to perpendicular to the outflows, with\nmagnitudes from ~1 to ~530 km/s/pc. We construct a simple kinematic model to\nreproduce the observed velocity gradients, estimate the infalling and\nrotational velocities, and infer the disk radii and the protostellar masses.\nThe inferred disk radii range from <5 AU to >500 AU with estimated protostellar\nmasses from <0.1 Msun to >1 Msun. Our results hint that both large and small\ndisks are possibly present around Class 0 protostars, which could be a sign of\ndisk growth at the Class 0 stage. In addition, the directions of the overall\nvelocity gradients in 7 out of the 17 sources are close to perpendicular to\ntheir outflow axes, which is a signature of significant rotational motions.\nFrom our model fitting, the specific angular momenta in these sources are\nestimated to be >2E-4 km/s*pc, suggesting that magnetic braking is unlikely\nefficient on a 1,000-AU scale in these Class 0 and 0/I sources. In a sub-sample\nwith observed magnetic field orientations, we find no source with large\nspecific angular momenta together with closely aligned magnetic field and\noutflow axes. This possibly hints that the magnetic field, if originally\naligned with the rotational axis, can play a role in removing angular momentum\nfrom infalling material at the Class 0 stage.

Many important\ndiscoveries have been obtained thanks to observations performed with the FORS\nlow-resolution spectropolarimeters of the ESO Very Large Telescope. We first\nreview and summarise the major results of a homogeneous re-reduction and\nanalysis of all single-slit FORS1 spectropolarimetric observations. This work\nrevealed a non-negligible dependence of the results upon the adopted reduction\nand analysis procedure, as well as the presence of instabilities, revealing\nthat photon noise is not the only source of uncertainty. As a consequence of\nour new analysis and assessment of the uncertainties, we are not able to\nconfirm a large number of magnetic field detections presented in the past for a\nvariety of stars. We further summarise the results of FORS2 spectropolarimetric\nobservations of the A0 supergiant HD92207 which allowed us to explore further\nthe nature of the instabilities, roughly constraining their maximum impact on\nthe derived Stokes profiles and magnetic field values.

The super-Eddington wind can naturally\nprevent the carbon--oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) with high mass-accretion rates\nfrom becoming red-giant-like stars. Furthermore, it works in low-metallicity\nenvironments, which may explain SNe Ia observed at high redshifts. In this\narticle, we systematically investigated the most prominent single-degenerate\nWD+MS channel based on the super-Eddington wind scenario. We combined the\nEggleton stellar evolution code with a rapid binary population synthesis (BPS)\napproach to predict SN Ia birthrates for the WD+MS channel by adopting the\nsuper-Eddington wind scenario and detailed mass-accumulation efficiencies of\nH-shell flashes on the WDs. Our BPS calculations found that the estimated SN Ia\nbirthrates for the WD+MS channel are ~0.009-0.315*10^{-3}{yr}^{-1} if we adopt\nthe Eddington accretion rate as the critical accretion rate, which are much\nlower than that of the observations (<10% of the observed SN Ia birthrates).\nThis indicates that the WD+MS channel only contributes a small proportion of\nall SNe Ia. The birthrates in this simulation are lower than previous studies,\nthe main reason of which is that new mass-accumulation efficiencies of H-shell\nflashes are adopted. We also found that the critical mass-accretion rate has a\nsignificant influence on the birthrates of SNe Ia.

Similar to the original\ntemporal-domain COLA, sCOLA is an N-body method for solving for large-scale\nstructure in a frame that is comoving with observers following trajectories\ncalculated in Lagrangian Perturbation Theory. Incorporating the sCOLA method in\nan N-body code allows one to gain computational speed by capturing the\ngravitational potential from the far field using perturbative techniques, while\nletting the N-body code solve only for the near field. The far and near fields\nare completely decoupled, effectively localizing gravity for the N-body side of\nthe code. Thus, running an N-body code for a small simulation volume using\nsCOLA can reproduce the results of a standard N-body run for the same small\nvolume embedded inside a much larger simulation. We demonstrate that sCOLA can\nbe safely combined with the original temporal-domain COLA. sCOLA can be used as\na method for performing zoom-in simulations. It also allows N-body codes to be\nmade embarrassingly parallel, thus allowing for efficiently tiling a volume of\ninterest using grid computing. Moreover, sCOLA can be useful for cheaply\ngenerating large ensembles of accurate mock halo catalogs required to study\ngalaxy clustering.

Grid-cell measurements of low SFRs using\nH-alpha emission can be biased and scatter may be introduced because of\nnon-uniform sampling of the IMF or because of stochastically varying star\nformation.

In this\npaper we present the predictions of the disc fragmentation model regarding the\nproperties of the discs around such low-mass objects. We find that the discs\naround objects that have formed by fragmentation in discs hosted by Sun-like\nstars (referred to as 'parent' discs and 'parent' stars) are more massive than\nexpected from the ${M}_{\\rm disc}-M_*$ relation (which is derived for stars\nwith masses $M_*>0.2 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$). Accordingly, the accretion rates onto\nthese objects are also higher than expected from the $\\dot{M}_*-M_*$ relation.\nMoreover there is no significant correlation between the mass of the brown\ndwarf or planet with the mass of its disc nor with the accretion rate from the\ndisc onto it. The discs around objects that form by disc fragmentation have\nlarger than expected masses as they accrete gas from the disc of their parent\nstar during the first few kyr after they form. The amount of gas that they\naccrete and therefore their mass depend on how they move in their parent disc\nand how they interact with it. Observations of disc masses and accretion rates\nonto very low-mass objects are consistent with the predictions of the disc\nfragmentation model. Future observations (e.g. by ALMA) of disc masses and\naccretion rates onto substellar objects that have even lower masses (young\nplanets and young, low-mass brown dwarfs), where the scaling relations\npredicted by the disc fragmentation model diverge significantly from the\ncorresponding relations established for higher-mass stars, will test the\npredictions of this model. \n\n"}

In this\nchapter we review recent work in this area of research.

We first explore the\ncharacteristics of perturbations in polarimetric microlensing during\ncaustic-crossing of a binary lensing as follows: (a) The cooler spots over the\nGalactic bulge sources have the smaller contributions in the total flux,\nalthough they have stronger magnetic fields. (b) The maximum deviation in the\npolarimetry curve due to the spot happens when the spot is located near the\nsource edge and the source spot is first entering the caustic whereas the\nmaximum photometric deviation occurs for the spots located at the source\ncenter.

Multiple\nrotation periods are interpreted as surface differential rotation (DR). We\nre-analyze the sample of 24,124 Kepler stars from Reinhold et al.

Additionally,\nthe full time series, and different segments thereof are analyzed. For more\nthan 18,500 stars our results are consistent with the rotation periods from\nMcQuillan et al. (2014). Thereof, more than 12,300 stars show multiple\nsignificant peaks, which we interpret as DR. Gyrochronology ages between 100\nMyr and 10 Gyr were derived for more than 17,000 stars using different\ngyrochronology relations. We find a bimodal age distribution for Teff between\n3200-4700 K.

Half of these periods may\nbe associated with rotation stabilized by non-eclipsing companions, the other\nhalf might be due to pulsations. The derived gyrochronology ages are well\nconstrained since more than 93.0 % of the stars seem to be younger than the Sun\nwhere calibration is most reliable. Explaining the bimodality in the age\ndistribution is challenging, and limits accurate stellar age predictions.

First, we selected\ncandidates with a mid-IR excess and then obtained their optical spectra. We\ndisentangled contaminants with unique spectra such as M-stars, C-stars,\nplanetary nebulae, quasi-stellar objects and background galaxies. Subsequently,\nwe performed a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the remaining candidates to\nestimate their stellar parameters such as effective temperature, surface\ngravity (log g), metallicity ([Fe/H]), reddening and their luminosities. This\nresulted in a sample of 35 likely post-AGB candidates with late-G to late-A\nspectral types, low log g, and [Fe/H] < -0.5. Furthermore, our study confirmed\nthe existence of the dusty post-Red Giant Branch (post-RGB) stars, discovered\npreviously in our SMC survey, by revealing 119 such objects in the LMC. These\nobjects have mid-IR excesses and stellar parameters (Teff, log g, [Fe/H])\nsimilar to those of post-AGB stars except that their luminosities (< 2500\nLsun), and hence masses and radii, are lower.

This\nscenario is also motivated by the hypothesis that Galactic magnetars largely\noriginate from fast-spinning neutron stars as remnants of stripped-envelope\nsupernovae.

We\nreport here on a well-sampled light curve from 1889 to 2015, with unique\ncoverage of the prior century plus the entire duration of the PN formation plus\nthree decades of its aftermath. Surprisingly, the star anticipated the 1980's\nionization event by declining from B=10.30 in 1889 to B=10.76 in 1980. Starting\nin 1980, the central star faded fast, at a rate of 0.20 mag/year, reaching\nB=14.64 in 1996. This fast fading is apparently caused by the central star\nshrinking in size.

Sub-filaments and\n  velocities Abstract: We show that hydrodynamic turbulent cloud simulations naturally produce large\nfilaments made up of a network of smaller and coherent sub-filaments. Such\nsimulations resemble observations of filaments and fibres in nearby molecular\nclouds. The sub-filaments are dynamical features formed at the stagnation\npoints of the turbulent velocity field where shocks dissipate the turbulent\nenergy. They are a ubiquitous feature of the simulated clouds, which appear\nfrom the beginning of the simulation and are not formed by gradual\nfragmentation of larger filaments. Most of the sub-filaments are\ngravitationally sub-critical and do not fragment into cores, however, there is\nalso a significant fraction of supercritical sub-filaments which break up into\nstar-forming cores. The sub-filaments are coherent along their length, and the\nresidual velocities along their spine show that they are subsonically\ncontracting without any ordered rotation on scales of ~0.1 pc. Accretion flows\nalong the sub-filaments can feed material into star forming cores embedded\nwithin the network. The overall mass in sub-filaments and the number of\nsub-filaments increases as the cloud evolves. We propose that the formation of\nfilaments and sub-filaments is a natural consequence of the turbulent cascade\nin the complex multi-phase interstellar medium. Sub-filaments are formed by the\nhigh wavenumber, small scale modes in the turbulent velocity field. These are\nthen stretched by local shear motions and gathered together by a combination of\nlow wavenumber modes and gravitational contraction on larger scales, and by\ndoing so build up the extended filaments observed in column density maps. \n\n"}

We assess the reliability of the solar-cycle trends seen in the data\nby applying the same analysis to artificially generated spectra. We find that\nthe two methods are in good agreement. Both methods accurately reproduce the\ninput frequency shifts in the artificial data and underestimate the amplitude\nand width changes by a small amount, around 10 per cent.

In\nthese systems, some of the open field lines do not allow the flow to pass\nsmoothly through the sonic point, so that steady-state solutions do not exist\nin general. This paper focuses on this type of magnetic field configuration,\nwhere the resulting flow becomes manifestly time-dependent. We consider the\ncase of both steady heating and time-variable heating, and find the time scales\nfor the corresponding time variations of the outflow. Because the flow cannot\npass through the sonic transition, it remains subsonic and leads to so-called\nbreeze solutions. One manifestation of the time variability is that the flow\nsamples a collection of different breeze solutions over time, and the mass\noutflow rate varies in quasi-periodic fashion. Because the flow is subsonic,\ninformation can propagate inward from the outer boundary, which determines, in\npart, the time scale of the flow variability. This work finds the relationship\nbetween the outer boundary scale and the time scale of flow variations. In\npractice, the location of the outer boundary is set by the extent of the sphere\nof influence of the planet.

Some\nof these companions appear to move on very eccentric, possibly unbound orbits.\nThis is the case for the exoplanet Fomalhaut b and the brown dwarf companion PZ\nTel B. For such orbits, standard MCMC codes assuming only bound orbits may be\ninappropriate.

To clarify the situation, we address\nthe optimum ranges of applicability (in terms of the $T_{eff}$ range covered by\nthe HB stars) for visual and near-UV CMDs, as far as application of this HB $Y$\ntest goes.

Gamma rays\ntrace nuclear processes most directly, as they originate from nuclear\ntransitions following radioactive decays or high-energy collisions with\nexcitation of nuclei. Additionally, the unique gamma-ray signature from the\nannihilation of positrons falls into this astronomical window and is discussed\nhere: Cosmic positrons are often produced from beta-decays, thus also of\nnuclear physics origins. The nuclear reactions leading to radioactive isotopes\noccur inside stars and stellar explosions, which therefore constitute the main\nobjects of such studies. In recent years, both thermonuclear and core-collapse\nsupernova radioactivities have been measured, and complement conventional\nsupernova observations with measurements of their prime energy sources. The\ndiffuse radioactive afterglow of massive-star nucleosynthesis in gamma rays is\nnow being analysed towards how massive stars feed back their energy and ejecta\ninto interstellar gas.

A total of 122 of these jets have not been\npreviously analyzed by the MOJAVE program. In the case of 451 jet features that\nhad at least 10 epochs, we also examined their kinematics for possible\naccelerations. At least half of the well-sampled features have non-radial\nand/or accelerating trajectories, indicating that non-ballistic motion is\ncommon in AGN jets. Since it is impossible to extrapolate any accelerations\nthat occurred before our monitoring period, we could only determine reliable\nejection dates for about 24% of those features that had significant proper\nmotions. The distribution of maximum apparent jet speeds in all 295 AGNs\nmeasured by our program to date is peaked below 5c, with very few jets with\napparent speeds above 30c. The fastest speed in our survey is about 50c,\nmeasured in the jet of the quasar PKS 0805-07, and is indicative of a maximum\njet Lorentz factor of about 50 in the parent population. The Fermi LAT-detected\ngamma-ray AGNs in our sample have, on average, higher jet speeds than non\nLAT-detected AGNs, indicating a strong correlation between pc-scale jet speed\nand gamma-ray Doppler boosting factor.

Transiting planets currently represent the most informative data\nset on the ensemble properties of exoplanets within 1 AU of their star.\nHowever, the transit method is inherently biased due to both geometric and\ndetection-driven effects. In this work, we derive the overall observational\nbiases affecting the most basic transit parameters from first principles. By\nassuming a trapezoidal transit and using conditional probability, we infer the\nexpected distribution of these terms both as a joint distribution and in a\nmarginalized form. These general analytic results provide a baseline against\nwhich to compare trends predicted by mission-tailored injection/recovery\nsimulations and offer a simple way to correct for observational bias.

Because of the limited duration and of the\nstatistical properties, modelling the PDS of individual GRBs is challenging,\nand only average PDS of large samples have been discussed in the literature. We\ncharacterise the individual PDS of GRBs in terms of a stochastic process, and\ncarry out for the first time a systematic search for periodic signals and for a\nlink between the PDS and other observables. We present a Bayesian procedure\nthat uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique and apply it to study 215 bright\nlong GRBs detected with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope from January 2005 to\nMay 2015. The PDS are modelled with a power-law either with or without a break.\nTwo classes of GRBs emerge: with or without a unique dominant timescale.

In this paper, we present a\npossible framework to address this question, by studying the distributions of\ndisruption times for chaotic gravitational encounters as a function of the\nnumber of interacting particles. To this end, we perform a series of numerical\nscattering experiments with the \\texttt{FEWBODY} code, to calculate the\ndistributions of disruption times as a function of both the particle number N\nand the virial coefficient k. The subsequent distributions are fit with a\nphysically-motivated function, consisting of an initial exponential decay\nfollowed by a very slowly decreasing tail at long encounter times due to\nlong-lived quasi-stable encounters. We find three primary features\ncharacteristic of the calculated distributions of disruption times.

We detected a\nyoung cluster in the center of the HII region with a limiting magnitude of K =\n18.0 mag (10sigma), which corresponds to a mass detection limit of ~0.2 M_sun.\nThis enables the comparison of star-forming properties under low metallicity\nwith those of the solar neighborhood.

The\nestimated young age is consistent with the detection of strong CO emission in\nthe cluster region and the estimated large extinction of cluster members (Av ~\n4--25 mag). The observed KLF suggests that the underlying initial mass function\n(IMF) of the low-metallicity cluster is not significantly different from\ncanonical IMFs in the solar neighborhood in terms of both high-mass slope and\nIMF peak (characteristic mass).

Motivated in part by the difficulty of\naccommodating large amounts of entropy carried in dark radiation with cosmic\nmicrowave background measurements of the effective number of relativistic\nspecies at recombination, $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, we aim to establish which\nadmissible cosmological histories can populate a thermal dark sector that never\nreaches thermal equilibrium with the SM. The minimal cosmological origin for\nsuch a dark sector is asymmetric reheating, when the same mechanism that\npopulates the SM in the early universe also populates the dark sector at a\nlower temperature. Here we demonstrate that the resulting inevitable\ninflaton-mediated scattering between the dark sector and the SM can wash out a\nwould-be temperature asymmetry, and establish the regions of parameter space\nwhere temperature asymmetries can be generated in minimal reheating scenarios.\nThus obtaining a temperature asymmetry of a given size either restricts\npossible inflaton masses and couplings or necessitates a non-minimal cosmology\nfor one or both sectors.

Extinction\nproperties for MW, LMC, and SMC dust types are considered. It is illustrated\nthat the attenuation curves are primarily determined by the wavelength\ndependence of absorption rather than by the underlying extinction\n(absorption+scattering) curve. Attenuation curves consistent with the \"Calzetti\nattenuation curve\" are found by assuming the silicate-carbonaceous dust model\nfor the MW, but with the 2175A absorption bump suppressed or absent. The\ndiscrepancy between our results and previous work that claimed the SMC-type\ndust to be the most likely origin of the Calzetti curve is ascribed to the\ndifference in adopted albedos; this study uses the theoretically calculated\nalbedos whereas the previous ones adopted empirically derived albedos from\nobservations of reflection nebulae. It is also found that the model attenuation\ncurves calculated with the MW dust are well represented by a modified Calzetti\ncurve with a varying slope and UV bump strength. The strong correlation between\nthe slope and UV bump strength, with steeper curves having stronger bumps, as\nfound in star-forming galaxies at 0.5<z<2.0, is well reproduced by our models\nif the abundance of the UV bump carriers or PAHs is assumed to be 30% or 40% of\nthat of the MW-dust. The trend is explained by radiative transfer effects which\nlead to shallower attenuation curves with weaker UV bumps as the ISM is more\nclumpy and dustier. We also argue that at least some of the IUE local starburst\ngalaxies may have a UV bump feature in their attenuation curves, albeit much\nweaker than that of the MW extinction curve. \n\n"}

This strongly conflicts with the traditional view of\nthe dominant star-formation mode in stellar clusters, which are thought of as\nsingle-aged stellar populations. Here we present a test of this interpretation\nby exploring the morphology of the subgiant branch (SGB) of NGC 411, which\nhosts possibly the most extended eMSTO among all known intermediate-age star\nclusters. We show that the width of the NGC 411 SGB favours the single-aged\nstellar population interpretation and rules out an extended SFH. In addition,\nwhen considering the red clump (RC) morphology and adopting the unproven\npremise that the widths of all features in the colour--magnitude diagram are\ndetermined by an underlying range in ages, we find that the SFH implied is\nstill very close to that resulting from a single-aged stellar population, with\na minor fraction of stars scattering to younger ages compared with the bulk of\nthe population. The SFHs derived from the SGB and RC are both inconsistent with\nthe SFH derived from the eMSTO region.

The former issue can be resolved\nby future observations. But the latter issue can be resolved now, if we pay\nattention to what is expected from theoretical considerations. The question of\nwhether a correlation has been found between the power outputs of few objects\nand the spins of their BHs is moot because BH beam power does not scale with\nthe square of the spin of the BH.

In four, long-period ($P>0.6$ d) stars observed by the\nOptical Gravitational Lensing Experiment, and classified as fundamental mode\npulsators (RRab), we detect additional, low-amplitude variability, with period\nshorter than fundamental mode period. The period ratios fall in a range similar\nto double-mode fundamental and first overtone RR Lyrae stars (RRd), with the\nexception of one star, in which the period ratio is significantly lower and\nnearly exactly equals 0.7. Although period ratios are fairly different for the\nfour stars, the light curve shapes corresponding to the dominant, fundamental\nmode are very similar. The peak-to-peak amplitudes and amplitude ratios\n(Fourier parameters $R_{21}$ and $R_{31}$) are among the highest observed in\nRRab stars of similar period, while Fourier phases ($\\varphi_{21}$ and\n$\\varphi_{31}$) are among the lowest observed in RRab stars.\n  If the additional variability is interpreted as due to radial first overtone,\nthen, the four stars are the most extreme RRd variables of the longest\npulsation periods known. Indeed, the observed period ratios can be well\nmodelled with high metallicity pulsation models. However, at such long\npulsation periods, first overtone is typically damped.\n  Five other candidates, with weak signature of additional variability, sharing\nthe same characteristics, were also detected and are briefly discussed. \n\n"}

The escape velocities from UFDs are so\nsmall that the natal kicks, taking place at neutron stars birth, might eject\nsuch binaries from UFDs.

However, magnetic morphology is still\nneglected in most rotation evolution models due to the difficulty of properly\naccounting for its effects on wind driving and angular momentum loss. Using\nstate-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamical magnetized wind simulations we study the\neffect that different distributions of the magnetic flux at different levels of\ngeometrical complexity have on mass and angular momentum loss rates.

We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide\nillustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion\nof the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1\nconsists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,\nparallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars\nin common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric\ndata set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The\nsecond component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band\nmagnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the\ntypical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas.

Even though the slope of the\nlate-time light-curve decline in both SLSNe is suggestively close to that\nexpected from the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni and $^{56}$Co, the amount of\nnickel required to power the full light curves is too large considering the\nestimated ejecta mass.

By using\nthe disc stability condition as a function of perturbation wavelength and\ndistance from the galaxy centre we calculate the effective disc stability\nparameters and the least stable wavelengths at different distances.

Although the number\nof GRBs identified at z>6 remains small, they provide a unique window on\ntypical star-forming galaxies at that time, and thus are complementary to deep\nfield observations. We report the identification of the optical drop-out\nafterglow of Swift GRB 120923A in near-infrared Gemini-North imaging, and\nderive a redshift of z=7.84_{-0.12}^{+0.06} from VLT/X-shooter spectroscopy. At\nthis redshift the peak 15-150 keV luminosity of the burst was 3.2x10^52 erg/s,\nand in fact the burst was close to the Swift/BAT detection threshold. The X-ray\nand near-infrared afterglow were also faint, and in this sense it was a rather\ntypical long-duration GRB in terms of rest-frame luminosity. We present ground-\nand space-based follow-up observations spanning from X-ray to radio, and find\nthat a standard external shock model with a constant-density circumburst\nenvironment with density, n~4x10^-2 cm^-3 gives a good fit to the data. The\nnear-infrared light curve exhibits a sharp break at t~3.4 days in the observer\nframe, which if interpreted as being due to a jet corresponds to an opening\nangle of ~5 degrees. The beaming corrected gamma-ray energy is then\nE_gamma~2x10^50 erg, while the beaming-corrected kinetic energy is lower,\nE_K~10^49 erg, suggesting that GRB 120923A was a comparatively low kinetic\nenergy event.

Most embedded binary systems are\nfound toward the centres of their parent cores, although several systems have\ncomponents closer to the core edge. Wide binaries, defined as those systems\nwith physical separations greater than 500 au, show a tendency to be aligned\nwith the long axes of their parent cores, whereas tight binaries show no\npreferred orientation. We test a number of simple, evolutionary models to\naccount for the observed populations of Class 0 and I sources, both single and\nbinary.

Dust scattering was\nrecently recognized as a potential contributor to polarization, although its\nbasic properties have yet to be thoroughly explored. Here, we quantify the\neffects of optical depth on the scattering-induced polarization in inclined\ndisks through a combination of analytical illustration, approximate\nsemi-analytical modeling using formal solution to the radiative transfer\nequation, and Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the near-side of the disk\nis significantly brighter in polarized intensity than the far-side, provided\nthat the disk is optically thick and that the scattering grains have yet to\nsettle to the midplane. This asymmetry is the consequence of a simple geometric\neffect: the near-side of the disk surface is viewed more edge-on than the\nfar-side. It is a robust signature that may be used to distinguish the\nscattering-induced polarization from that by other mechanisms, such as aligned\ngrains. The asymmetry is weaker for a geometrically thinner dust disk. As such,\nit opens an exciting new window on dust settling. We find anecdotal evidence\nfrom dust continuum imaging of edge-on disks that large grains are not yet\nsettled in the youngest (Class 0) disks, but become more so in older disks.\nThis trend is corroborated by the polarization data in inclined disks showing\nthat younger disks have more pronounced near-far side asymmetry and thus less\ngrain settling.

Here we investigate for the first time a\ncomprehensive number of 16 self-organization processes that operate in\nplanetary physics, solar physics, stellar physics, galactic physics, and\ncosmology.

Giant planets that arrive with periastron\ndistances that are smaller than the Roche limit $a_\\mathrm{R}$ lose their\ngaseous envelopes, resulting in an inner edge to the surviving planets'\ndistribution. The observational evidence for this effect, while extensive, is\nnonetheless somewhat ambiguous because of the effect of tidal orbital decay.\nHere we consider another key prediction of the HEM scenario---the existence of\na spatial eccentricity gradient near the location where the circularization\ntime becomes comparable to the planet's age for typical parameters. Previous\nstudies already found evidence for this gradient and demonstrated that its\nproperties are consistent with the circularization process being dominated by\ntidal dissipation in the planet (encapsulated by the tidal quality factor\n$Q^\\prime_\\mathrm{p}$). Our work extends these treatments by constructing\nexplicit model distributions for comparison with the data and by carrying out\nbackward-in-time integrations using observed system parameters.

In addition, the fitted relations between\nfractions of AGB second population and GC global parameters show that AGB\nsecond-population fraction slightly anticorrelates with GC central\nconcentration, while no robust dependency can be confirmed with other GC\nparameters.

We investigate whether such structures are due to the\nmorphology of the disk itself or if they are instead an intrinsic feature of CN\nemission. With the intention of using CN as a diagnostic, we also address to\nwhich physical and chemical parameters CN is most sensitive. A set of disk\nmodels were run for different stellar spectra, masses, and physical structures\nvia the 2D thermochemical code DALI. An updated chemical network that accounts\nfor the most relevant CN reactions was adopted. Ring-shaped emission is found\nto be a common feature of all adopted models; the highest abundance is found in\nthe upper outer regions of the disk, and the column density peaks at 30-100 AU\nfor T Tauri stars with standard accretion rates. Higher mass disks generally\nshow brighter CN. Higher UV fields, such as those appropriate for T Tauri stars\nwith high accretion rates or for Herbig Ae stars or for higher disk flaring,\ngenerally result in brighter and larger rings. These trends are due to the main\nformation paths of CN, which all start with vibrationally excited H2*\nmolecules, that are produced through far ultraviolet (FUV) pumping of H2. The\nmodel results compare well with observed disk-integrated CN fluxes and the\nobserved location of the CN ring for the TW Hya disk. CN rings are produced\nnaturally in protoplanetary disks and do not require a specific underlying disk\nstructure such as a dust cavity or gap.

Protostars do not evolve in\nisolation of their environment, but grow through accretion of gas.

If the isolation mass is very small, then\ngas accretion is protracted and the planet remains at a few Earth masses with a\nmainly solid composition. For larger values of the pebble isolation mass, the\nplanet might be able to accrete gas from the protoplanetary disc and grow into\na gas giant. Previous works have determined a scaling of the pebble isolation\nmass with cube of the disc aspect ratio. Here we expand on previous\nmeasurements and explore the dependency of the pebble isolation mass on all\nrelevant parameters of the protoplanetary disc. We use 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulations to measure the pebble isolation mass and derive a simple scaling\nlaw that captures the dependence on the local disc structure and the turbulent\nviscosity parameter $\\alpha$. We find that small pebbles, coupled to the gas,\nwith Stokes number $\\tau_{\\rm f}<0.005$ can drift through the partial gap at\npebble isolation mass. However, as the planetary mass increases, particles must\nbe decreasingly smaller to penetrate through the pressure bump.

A proper treatment of interstellar extinction is, for example,\ncrucial for estimating distances to stars in the disk outside the small range\nof the solar neighborhood.

The VLA 1623 data resolve compact ~ 40 au inner disks\naround the two protobinary sources, VLA 1623-A and VLA 1623-B, and also an\nextended ~ 180 au ring of dust around VLA 1623-A. This dust ring was previously\nidentified as a large disk in lower-resolution observations. We detect highly\nstructured dust polarization toward the inner disks and the extended ring with\ntypical polarization fractions ~ 1.7% and ~ 2.4%, respectively. The two\ncomponents also show distinct polarization morphologies. The inner disks have\nuniform polarization angles aligned with their minor axes. This morphology is\nconsistent with expectations from dust scattering. By contrast, the extended\ndust ring has an azimuthal polarization morphology not previously seen in\nlower-resolution observations. We find that our observations are well fit by a\nstatic, oblate spheroid model with a flux-frozen, poloidal magnetic field. We\npropose that the polarization traces magnetic grain alignment likely from flux\nfreezing on large scales and magnetic diffusion on small scales. Alternatively,\nthe azimuthal polarization may be attributed to grain alignment by the\nanisotropic radiation field. If the grains are radiatively aligned, then our\nobservations indicate that large (~ 100 um) dust grains grow quickly at large\nangular extents. Finally, we identify significant proper motion of VLA 1623\nusing our observations and those in the literature. This result indicates that\nthe proper motion of nearby systems must be corrected for when combining ALMA\ndata from different epochs. \n\n"}

Abstract: Investigating the chemical homogeneity of stars born from the same molecular\ncloud at virtually the same time is very important for our understanding of the\nchemical enrichment of the interstellar medium and with it the chemical\nevolution of the Galaxy. One major cause of inhomogeneities in the abundances\nof open clusters is stellar evolution of the cluster members. In this work, we\ninvestigate variations in the surface chemical composition of member stars of\nthe old open cluster M67 as a possible consequence of atomic diffusion effects\ntaking place during the main-sequence phase. The abundances used are obtained\nfrom high-resolution UVES/FLAMES spectra within the framework of the Gaia-ESO\nSurvey. We find that the surface abundances of stars on the main sequence\ndecrease with increasing mass reaching a minimum at the turn-off. After\ndeepening of the convective envelope in sub-giant branch stars, the initial\nsurface abundances are restored. We found the measured abundances to be\nconsistent with the predictions of stellar evolutionary models for a cluster\nwith the age and metallicity of M67.

We find that $22_{-8}^{+26}$% of all massive binary systems merge\nprior to the first core collapse in the system. Of the remainder,\n$86_{-9}^{+11}$% become unbound because of the core-collapse. Remarkably, this\nrarely produce runaway stars (i.e., stars with velocities above 30 km/s). These\nare outnumbered by more than an order of magnitude by slower unbound\ncompanions, or \"walkaway stars\". This is a robust outcome of our simulations\nand is due to the reversal of the mass ratio prior to the explosion and\nwidening of the orbit, as we show analytically and numerically. We estimate a\n$10^{+5}_{-8}$% of massive stars to be walkaways and only $0.5^{+1.0}_{-0.4}$%\nto be runaways, nearly all of which have accreted mass from their companion.\nOur findings are consistent with earlier studies, however the low runaway\nfraction we find is in tension with observed fractions 10%. If Gaia confirms\nthese high fractions of massive runaway stars resulting from binaries, it would\nimply that we are currently missing physics in the binary models. Finally, we\nshow that high end of the mass distributions of runaway stars is very sensitive\nto the assumed black hole natal kicks and propose this as a potentially\nstringent test for the explosion mechanism.

Kicks can\ndisrupt the hierarchical configuration, although it is harder to escape the\npotential well of an SMBH. Some binary systems do escape the SMBH system\nresulting in hyper-velocity binary system. Furthermore, kicks can result in\nincreasing or decreasing the orbital separations.

Previous studies of photospheric\nspectral lines across stellar disks exist for the Sun and HD209458 (G0 V) and\nare now extended to the planet-hosting HD189733A to sample a cooler K-type star\nand explore the future potential of the method. During exoplanet transit,\nstellar surface portions successively become hidden and differential\nspectroscopy between various transit phases uncovers spectra of small surface\nsegments temporarily hidden behind the planet. In Paper I, observable\nsignatures were predicted quantitatively from hydrodynamic simulations. From\nobservations of HD189733A with the ESO HARPS spectrometer at R=115,000,\nprofiles for stronger and weaker Fe I lines are retrieved at several\ncenter-to-limb positions, reaching adequate S/N after averaging over numerous\nsimilar lines.

Center-to-limb changes\nstrongly depend on the surface granulation structure and much greater\nline-width variation is predicted in hotter F-type stars with vigorous\ngranulation than in cooler K-types. Such parameters, obtained from fits to full\nline profiles, are realistic to retrieve for brighter planet-hosting stars,\nwhile their hydrodynamic modeling offers previously unexplored diagnostics for\nstellar atmospheric fine structure and 3-D line formation. Precise modeling may\nbe required in searches for Earth-analog exoplanets around K-type stars, whose\nmore tranquil surface granulation and lower ensuing microvariability may enable\nsuch detections. \n\n"}

We\nselected a sample of 30 GRBs for which the extinction curve along the GRB\nafterglow line-of-sight (l.o.s) is measured in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)\nup to optical and we analysed the properties of the extinction curve as a\nfunction of the host galaxy properties. From these 30 GRBs, we selected seven\nGRBHs with a good rest-frame UV to near infra-red spectral coverage for the\nhost. The attenuation curve was derived by fitting the SEDs of the GRBH sample\nwith the CIGALE SED fitting code. Different star formation histories were\nstudied to recover the star formation rates (SFR) derived using H$_{\\alpha}$\nluminosities. The most extinguished GRBs are preferentially found in the more\nmassive hosts and the UV bump is preferentially found in the most extinguished\nGRB l.o.s.

Here we investigate SU Lyncis, a recently\ndiscovered example of a purely accretion-powered symbiotic star, using the\nfirst reliable X-ray spectroscopy, obtained with NuSTAR, and UV photometry\nobtained with Swift. SU Lyn has hard, thermal, X-ray emission that is strongly\naffected by a variable local absorber - that has little impact on the UV\nemission. Its X-ray spectrum is described well using a plasma cooling from $k$T\n$\\approx$ 21 keV, with a 3 to 30 keV luminosity of approximately\n4.9$\\times$10$^{32}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. The spectrum is also consistent with the\npresence of reflection with an amplitude of 1.0, although in that case, the\nbest-fit plasma temperature is 20-25% lower. The UV to X-ray luminosity ratio\nof SU Lyn changed significantly between 2015 and 2016. We interpret this as a\nconsequence of a drop by almost 90% in the accretion rate.

If the environment,\nin which such emission is produced, is relativistically magnetized (i.e., that\nmagnetic energy density dominates even the rest-mass energy density of matter),\nthen the most natural mechanism of energy dissipation and particle acceleration\nis relativistic magnetic reconnection.

More than five hundred minimum times equivalent to around\nnine decades are employed to identify the orbital behavior of the binary\nsystem. The best fit to the timings shows that the orbital period of DI Peg has\nvariation due to an integration of two sinusoids with the periods of $P_3 =\n49.50\\pm0.36$ yr and $P_4 = 27.40\\pm0.24$ yr.

We formulate the hydrodynamic\ntheories with an unbroken or a spontaneously broken U(1) one-form symmetry. The\nlatter of these describes a one-form superfluid, which is characterised by a\nvector Goldstone mode and a two-form superfluid velocity. Two special limits of\nthis theory have been studied in detail: the string fluid limit where the U(1)\none-form symmetry is partly restored, and the electric limit in which the\nsymmetry is completely broken. The transport properties of these theories are\ninvestigated in depth by studying the constraints arising from the second law\nof thermodynamics and Onsager's relations at first order in derivatives. We\nalso construct a hydrostatic effective action for the Goldstone modes in these\ntheories and use it to characterise the space of all equilibrium\nconfigurations. To make explicit contact with hot electromagnetism, the\ntraditional treatment of magnetohydrodynamics, where the electromagnetic photon\nis incorporated as dynamical degrees of freedom, is extended to include\nparity-violating contributions. We argue that the chemical potential and\nelectric fields are not independently dynamical in magnetohydrodynamics, and\nillustrate how to eliminate these within the hydrodynamic derivative expansion\nusing Maxwell's equations. Additionally, a new hydrodynamic theory of\nnon-conducting, but polarised, plasmas is formulated, focusing primarily on the\nmagnetically dominated sector.

These speckles are caused by\naberrations, called non-common path aberrations (NCPA), that are not corrected\nin the adaptive optics loop, and all attempts to subtract them in\npost-processing have been problematic. The method of Frazin (2013) (F13) uses\nsimultaneous millisecond telemetry from wavefront sensor (WFS) and the SC to\nestimate the both the NCPA and the exoplanet image in a self-consistent manner.\nRodack et al. (2018) proposed correcting for the NCPA in real-time while on-sky\nusing the F13 estimation method, and called this procedure the \"Real-Time\nFrazin Algorithm.\" The original regression model underlying the F13 method did\nnot account for uncertainty in the WFS measurements, and this cannot be done\nwith standard statistical methodology since these uncertainties manifest\nthemselves in the independent variables (i.e., they cannot be treated as\nanother source of noise in the SC data). Further, simulations show that simply\nusing the noisy wavefront measurements without accounting for their\nuncertainties leads to estimates of the NCPA with unacceptably large bias.\nHere, the source of this bias is explained in terms of an \"errors in variables\"\nstatistical model. Then, the method of F13 is generalized to account for WFS\nmeasurement error using a new sequential estimation technique that treats the\nnonlinear coupling between NCPA, WFS measurements and the error covariance of\nthe WFS measurements. This new technique keeps a running estimate of the NCPA,\nthe exoplanet image and their joint covariance matrix. The sequential\nimplementation of the method should make it computationally efficient enough to\nbe suitable for on-sky correction of the NCPA as well as off-line analysis. \n\n"}

Rotation is suspected to be the cause of\nthis feature, by accumulating fast rotating stars, strongly affected by gravity\ndarkening and rotation-induced mixing, near the MS turn-off. This scenario\nsuccessfully reproduces the tight relation between the age and the actual\nextent in luminosity of the extended MS turn-off of observed clusters. Below a\ngiven mass (dependent on the metallicity), stars are efficiently braked early\non the MS due to the interaction of stellar winds and the surface magnetic\nfield, making their tracks converge towards those of non-rotating tracks in the\nHRD. When these stars are located at the turn-off of a cluster, their slow\nrotation causes the extended MS turn-off feature to disappear. We investigate\nthe maximal mass for which this braking occurs at different metallicities, and\ndetermine the age above which no extended MS turn-off is expected in clusters.\nOur models predict that the extended MS turn-off phenomenon disappears at ages\nolder than about 2 Gyr. There is a trend with the metallicity, the age at which\nthe disappearance occurs becoming older at higher metallicity. These results\nare robust between the two codes used in this work, despite some differences in\nthe input physics and in particular in the detailed description of\nrotation-induced internal processes and of angular momentum extraction by\nstellar winds. Comparing our results with clusters in the LMC and Galaxy shows\na very good fit to the observations.

The\noptically thin CO (J=3-2) emission is co-located with previously identified\ndust emission from the belt, and the emission velocity structure is consistent\nwith Keplerian rotation around the central star.

The adopted model supposes that the gas distribution\ncharacterized by the slope parameter is related to the preheated temperature.\nComparison with observations of relatively hot (~> 3 keV) and low redshift\nclusters suggests that the preheated temperature is about 0.5-2 keV, which is\nhigher than expected from the conventional galactic wind model and possibly\nsuggests the need for additional heating such as quasars or gravitational\nheating on the largest scales at high redshift. The dispersion of the preheated\ntemperature may be attributed to the gravitational heating in subclusters. We\ncalculate the central gas fraction of a cluster from the gas distribution,\nassuming that the global gas mass fraction is constant within a virial radius\nat the time of the cluster collapse. We find that the central gas density thus\ncalculated is in good agreement with the observed one, which suggests that the\nvariation of gas mass fraction in cluster cores appears to be explained by\nbreaking the self-similarity in clusters due to preheated gas.

Furthermore, the dispersion in the merger-remnant\nangular momentum distribution is smaller than the dispersion of the non-merger\ndistribution.

As a\nresult, higher energy explosions tend to produce larger [(Zn, Co)/Fe], smaller\n[(Mn, Cr)/Fe], and larger [Fe/O], which could explain the trend observed in\nvery metal-poor stars. 2) Si-burning takes place in lower density regions, so\nthat the effects of $\\alpha$-rich freezeout is enhanced. Thus $^{44}$Ca,\n$^{48}$Ti, and $^{64}$Zn are produced more abundantly than in normal\nsupernovae.

The N-band images were obtained with the Gemini North\ntelescope and reveal four of the five enshrouded clusters, or \"ultradense HII\nregions\" (UDHIIs), recently discovered in radio maps. None of these sources\nappears in either the optical HST images or the near-infrared images. They\ncomprise about 60% of the total N-band flux from He 2-10 and, we suspect, a\nsimilar fraction of the total far infrared flux measured by IRAS. The inferred\nspectra of the UDHIIs are very similar to those of Galactic ultracompact HII\nregions and we have modeled the UDHIIs under the assumption that they are\n\"scaled-up\" versions of these objects. The bolometric luminosity of the\nbrightest UDHII is estimated to be ~2x10^9 L_sun, and the total mass of the\ndust and gas is ~10^7 M_sun. The mass of the enshrouded stellar cluster must be\n> 2.5x10^6 M_sun and the age must be < 4.8x10^6 yr. All of the stellar clusters\nwithin the UDHIIs must have ages less than about 5x10^6 yr and masses greater\nthan about 5x10^5 M_sun.

Large ratios for some starburst\ngalaxies may indicate that a significant fraction of the far infrared flux\narises from UDHIIs. If all of the far infrared flux from He 2-10 and other\nstarbursts is produced by heavily obscured regions, the observed correlation\nbetween UV continuum slope and infrared-to-ultraviolet flux ratio in starbursts\ncannot be due primarily to UV reprocessing by dust in a foreground screen. \n\n"}

It was shown that the reacceleration\nmodels designed to match secondary to primary nuclei ratios (e.g.,\nboron/carbon) produce too few antiprotons. Matching both the secondary to\nprimary nuclei ratio and the antiproton flux requires artificial breaks in the\ndiffusion coefficient and the primary injection spectrum suggesting the need\nfor other approaches.\n  In the present paper we discuss one possibility to overcome these\ndifficulties.

Motivated by inner halo satellite remnants like the Sgr and Omega Cen,\nwe develop fully analytical models to study the orbital decay and tidal\nmassloss of satellites. The orbital decay rate is often severely overestimated\nif applying the ChandraSekhar's formula without correcting for (a) the\nevaporation and tidal loss of the satellite and (b) the contraction of\nsatellite orbits due to adiabatic growth of the host galaxy potential over the\nHubble time. As a satellite migrates inwards, the increasing halo density\naffects the dynamical friction in two opposite ways:(1) it boosts the number of\nhalo particles swept in the satellite's gravitational \"wake\", hence increasing\nthe drag on the satellite, and (2) it boosts the tide which \"peels off\" the\nsatellite, and reduces the amplitude of the wake. These competing processes can\nbe modeled analytically for a satellite with the help of an empirical formula\nfor the massloss history. The analytical model agrees with more numerical\nsimulations of tidal massloss and dynamical friction.

We performed two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations for flat\nmulti-component disks embedded in a combined static stellar and dark matter\npotential. The pressure-free dust component is coupled to the gas by a drag\nforce depending on their velocity difference.\n  It turned out that the most unstable regions are those with either a low or\nnear to minimum Toomre parameter or with rigid rotation, i.e. the central area.\nIn that regions the dust-free disks become most unstable for high azimuthal\nmodes (m~8), whereas in dusty disks all modes have a similar amplitude\nresulting in a patchy appearance. The structures in the dust have a larger\ncontrast between arm and inter-arm regions than those of the gas.

Analytic prescriptions are used to incorporate small-scale\nstructures that affect reionization, yet remain unresolved in the N-body\nsimulation. We show that the morphology of the HII regions is most dependent on\nthe global ionization fraction x_i. This is not to say that the bubble\nmorphology is completely independent of all parameters besides x_i. The next\nmost important dependence is that of the nature of the ionizing sources. The\nrarer the sources, the larger and more spherical the HII regions become. The\ntypical bubble size can vary by as much as a factor of 4 at fixed x_i between\ndifferent possible source prescriptions.

The ignition conditions are characterized by a\nsensitive interplay between the accretion rate of the fuel supply and its\ndepletion rate by nuclear burning in the hot CNO cycle and the rp-process. For\naccretion rates close to stable burning the burst ignition therefore depends\ncritically on the hot CNO breakout reaction, O15(alpha,gamma)Ne19, that\nregulates the flow between the hot CNO cycle and the rapid proton capture\nprocess.

Although GRB\nafterglows are rarer than supernovae, they are detectable at greater distances\nbecause of their higher intrinsic luminosity. Assuming that GRBs trace the\ncosmic star formation history and that every GRB gives rise to a bright\nafterglow, we find that the average detection rate of supernovae and afterglows\nshould be comparable at limiting magnitudes brighter than K=18. The actual rate\nof afterglows is expected to be somewhat lower since only a fraction of all\ngamma-ray selected GRBs were observed to have associated afterglows. However,\nthe rate could also be higher if the initial gamma-ray emission from GRB\nsources is more beamed than their late afterglow emission.

We show that the scatter of the CMR places a strong constraint on the\nspread in age of the bulk of the stellar population. However, although the bulk\nof stars must be formed in a short period, continuing formation of stars in a\nfraction of the galaxies is not so strongly constrained.\n  We examine a model in which star formation occurs over an extended period of\ntime in most galaxies. An extension of this type of star formation history\nallows us to reconcile the small present-day scatter of the CMR with the\nobserved blue galaxy fractions of intermediate redshift galaxy clusters.\n  Secondly, the CMR can also be used to constrain the degree of merging between\npre-existing stellar systems. This test relies on the slope of the CMR. We show\nthat random mergers between galaxies very rapidly remove any well-defined CMR.\nHowever, we prefer to examine the merger process using a self-consistent merger\ntree. In such a model there are two effects: massive galaxies preferentially\nmerge with systems of similar mass; and the rate of mass growth is considerably\nsmaller than for the random merger case. As a result of both of these effects,\nthe CMR persists through a larger number of merger steps. The passive evolution\nof galaxy colours and their averaging in dissipationless mergers provide\nopposing constraints on the formation of cluster galaxies in a hierarchical\nmodel; but at the level of current constraints, a compromise solution appears\npossible. \n\n"}

It is able to cover a relatively wide\nenergy interval, ranging from zeroth gamma-ray energy to values above GDR peak\nenergy, as compared with the others closed-form models for calculation of the\nE1 strength. \n\n"}

Abstract: In his monumental discoveries, the driving force for Einstein was, I believe,\nconsistency of concept and principle rather than conflict with experiment. In\nthis spirit, I would like to look at the journey from the classical to the\nrelativistic world as a simple and direct exercise first in recognition of\nuniversal character of universal entities and then carrying out the\nuniversalization. By this process not only the relativistic world follows most\nnaturally but I would like to conjecture that if Einstein were born in 1844 (or\nhad I been born in 1844 and had followed this line of thought as I do now!) it\nwould have in fact been predicted including existence of a wave with universal\nconstant velocity. That would have indeed been not only the greatest but most\namazing and remarkable feat of human thought.\n  Beating further on the same track of principle and concept driven ideas, we\nponder over to see beyond Einstein, and ask the questions: in how many\ndimensions does gravity live, how many basic forces are there in nature and\nwhat are the basic building blocks of space-time? \n\n"}

The technique is based on deconvolution of recorded pulse with a\nresponse function of the counter. It allows one to restore a projection of the\ntrack of initial ionization to the radius of the counter, or a charge\ncollection function. \n\n"}
