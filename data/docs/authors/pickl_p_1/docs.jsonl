The latters have marginal probability density function governed by\ntime-fractional diffusion equations of order beta. The ggBm is defined through\nthe explicit construction of the underline probability space. However, in this\npaper we show that it is possible to define it in an unspecified probability\nspace. For this purpose, we write down explicitly all the finite dimensional\nprobability density functions. Moreover, we provide different ggBm\ncharacterizations. The role of the M-Wright function, which is related to the\nfundamental solution of the time-fractional diffusion equation, emerges as a\nnatural generalization of the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we show that\nggBm can be represented in terms of the product of a random variable, which is\nrelated to the M-Wright function, and an independent fractional Brownian\nmotion. This representation highlights the $H$-{\\bf sssi} nature of the ggBm\nand provides a way to study and simulate the trajectories. For this purpose, we\ndeveloped a random walk model based on a finite difference approximation of a\npartial integro-differenital equation of fractional type. \n\n"}

In this work, we show by simple\nexamples that anomalous symmetries can often be implemented at the expense of\nworking with mixed states having non-zero entropies. In particular there is the\nresult on color breaking by non-abelian magnetic monopoles. This anomaly can be\nrectified by using impure states.

In the linear limiting case, an\nanalytical expression for the pseudolocalized solution is found and the method\nof variational approximation is applied to find the dynamics of the centers of\nthe quasi-particles (QPs) corresponding to these solutions. A discrete\nLagrangian can be derived due to the localization of the gradient and the\nLaplacian of the profile. The equations of motion of the QPs are derived from\nthe discrete Lagrangian. The pseudomass (\"wave mass\") of a QP is defined as\nwell as the potential of interaction. The most important trait of the new QPs\nis that at large distances, the force of attraction is proportional to the\ninverse square of the distance between the QPs. This can be considered\nanalogous to the gravitational force in classical mechanics. \n\n"}

The bottom line is that upon expanding in powers of 1/L the energy\nlevels of long (closed) strings (where L is the length of the string), all the\nterms up to (and including) order 1/L^5 are universal. We argue that for\nexcited strings in D>3 space-time dimensions there is a universal deviation at\norder 1/L^5 from the naive formula that is usually used to fit lattice results.\nFor D=3 this naive formula is valid even at order 1/L^5.

More generally, an infinite family of lattice loop\nmodels is studied on the torus and related to the corresponding\nFortuin-Kasteleyn random cluster models. Starting with a cylinder, the\ncommuting periodic single-row transfer matrices are built from the periodic\nTemperley-Lieb algebra extended by the shift operators Omega and Omega^{-1}. In\nthis enlarged algebra, the non-contractible loop fugacity is alpha and the\ncontractible loop fugacity is beta. The torus is formed by gluing the top and\nbottom of the cylinder. This gives rise to a variety of non-contractible loops\nwinding around the torus. Because of their nonlocal nature, the standard matrix\ntrace does not produce the proper geometric torus. Instead, we introduce a\nmodified matrix trace for this purpose. This is achieved by using a\nrepresentation of the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra with a parameter\nv that keeps track of the winding of defects on the cylinder. The transfer\nmatrix representatives and their eigenvalues thus depend on v. The modified\ntrace is constructed as a linear functional on planar connectivity diagrams in\nterms of matrix traces Tr_d (with a fixed number of defects d) and Chebyshev\npolynomials of the first kind. For critical dense polymers, where beta=0, the\ntransfer matrix eigenvalues are obtained by solving a functional equation in\nthe form of an inversion identity.

This correspondence is usually expressed via\nan all-orders Bohr-Sommerfeld relation, but this neglects non-perturbative\neffects, the nature of which is very different in the electric, magnetic and\ndyonic regions. In the gauge theory dyonic region the spectral expansions are\ndivergent, and indeed are not Borel-summable, so they are more properly\ndescribed by resurgent trans-series in which perturbative and non-perturbative\neffects are deeply entwined. In the gauge theory electric region the spectral\nexpansions are convergent, but nevertheless there are non-perturbative effects\ndue to poles in the expansion coefficients, and which we associate with\nworldline instantons.

Abstract: On the surface of 2D Topological insulators occur 1D quantum spin Hall(QSH)\nedge modes with Dirac like dispersion. Unlike quantum Hall(QH) edge modes which\noccur at high magnetic fields in 2DEGs, the occurrence of QSH edge modes is\nbecause of spin-orbit scattering in the bulk of the material. These QSH edge\nmodes are spin dependent and chiral- opposite spins move in opposing\ndirections. Electronic spin has larger decoherence and relaxation time than\ncharge- in view of this its expected that QSH edge modes will be more robust to\ndisorder and inelastic scattering than QH edge modes which are charge dependent\nand spin unpolarized. However, we notice no such advantage accrues to QSH edge\nmodes when subjected to same degree of contact disorder and/or inelastic\nscattering in similar setups as QH edge modes. In fact we observe that QSH edge\nmodes are more susceptible to inelastic scattering and contact disorder than QH\nedge modes. Further, while a single disordered contact has no effect on QH edge\nmodes it leads to a finite charge Hall current in case of quantum spin Hall\nedge modes and thus vanishing of pure quantum spin Hall effect. For more than a\nsingle disordered contact while quantum Hall states continue to remain immune\nto disorder, quantum spin Hall edge modes become more susceptible- the Hall\nresistance for quantum spin Hall effect changes sign with increasing disorder.\nIn case of many disordered contacts with inelastic scattering included while\nquantization of Hall edge modes holds, for quantum spin Hall edge modes- a\nfinite charge Hall current still flows. For quantum spin Hall edge modes in the\ninelastic scattering regime we distinguish between two cases: with spin-flip\nand without spin-flip scattering. Finally, while asymmetry in sample geometry\ncan have a deleterious effect on quantum spin Hall case it has no impact in\nquantum Hall case. \n\n"}

This result applies also to the\nIDS in any finite volume subject to the random potential induced by an ambient,\ninfinitely extended disordered media. Dimension one is critical: in the\nBernoulli case, within the class of exponential interactions, the IDS measure\nundergoes continuity phase transitions, from absolutely continuous to singular\ncontinuous behaviour (the singularity in the latter case was known before). The\ncontinuity transitions do not occur for sub-exponential or slower decaying\ninteractions, nor for $d\\ge 2$. Technically, the case of polynomial decay is\nthe simplest one.\n  The proposed approach provides a complement to the classical Wegner estimate\nwhich says, essentially, that the IDS in the short-range models is at least as\nregular as the marginal distribution of the disorder. In the models with\nnon-local interaction the IDS is actually much more regular than the underlying\ndisorder, which can even be discrete, due to the smoothing effect of multiple\nconvolutions. In turn, smoothness of the IDS is responsable for a mechanism\ncomplementing the usual Lifshitz tails phenomenon.\n  It is also shown that the disorder can take various forms (e.g., substitution\nor random displacements) and need not be stochastically stationary (as in\nDelone--Anderson or trim\\-med/crooked Hamiltonians, for example); this does not\naffect the main phenomena observed already in the simplest setting.\n  Long-range models have an amazingly large number of connections to several\nclassical problems of harmonic analysis, probability theory, dynamical systems\nand number theory. \n\n"}

Both functional equations are equivalent to\ninfinite hierarchies of integro-differential equations (coupled in the FRG\ncase) for the corresponding families of Green's functions (GF).

Using this philosophy, we build an effective theory of a\n$2+1$-dimensional fluid state with two perpendicular sets of immersed elastic\nline defects. When the number of defects is independently conserved in each\nset, then the state possesses two one-form symmetries. Normally, such\nviscoelastic states are described as fluids coupled to Goldstone bosons\nassociated with spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry caused by the\nunderlying microscopic structure---the principle feature of which is a\ntransverse sound mode. At the linear, non-dissipative level, we verify that our\ntheory, based entirely on symmetry principles, is equivalent to a viscoelastic\ntheory.

II: A Concrete\n  Implementation Abstract: The present paper is the companion of [1] in which we proposed a scheme that\ntries to derive the Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on Curved Spacetimes (CST) limit\nfrom background independent Quantum General Relativity (QGR). The constructions\nof [1] make heavy use of the notion of semiclassical states for QGR. In the\npresent paper, we employ the complexifier coherent states for QGR recently\nproposed by Thiemann and Winkler as semiclassical states, and thus fill the\ngeneral formulas obtained in [1] with life. We demonstrate how one can, under\nsome simplifying assumptions, explicitely compute expectation values of the\noperators relevant for the gravity-matter Hamiltonians of [1] in the\ncomplexifier coherent states. These expectation values give rise to effective\nmatter Hamiltonians on the background on which the gravitational coherent state\nis peaked and thus induce approximate notions of n-particle states and matter\npropagation on fluctuating spacetimes. We display the details for the scalar\nand the electromagnetic field. The effective theories exhibit two types of\ncorrections as compared to the the ordinary QFT on CST. The first is due to the\nquantum fluctuations of the gravitational field, the second arises from the\nfact that background independence forces both geometry and matter to propagate\non a spacetime that is the product of the real line and a (random) graph.\nFinally we obtain explicit numerical predictions for non-standard dispersion\nrelations for the scalar and the electromagnetic field.

We give a\nnumerical example involving scattering by a short-range potential in a Coulomb\nfield for which it is seen that even for a small but non-negligible\nnon-Hermiticity index the non-Hermitian character of the problem must be taken\ninto account. The computation of physical quantities in the relevant Hilbert\nspaces is also discussed. \n\n"}

We study in some detail the various properties of\nthese polynomials and the corresponding quotient polynomials. In particular, we\nshow that the weight functions for these polynomials are not always positive.\nWe also study the orthogonal polynomials of the double sine-Gordon potential\nwhich is related to the double sinh-Gordon case by an anti-isospectral\ntransformation. Finally we discover a new quasi-exactly solvable problem by\nmaking use of the anti-isospectral transformation. \n\n"}
