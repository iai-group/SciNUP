Based on the\nlatest hydrodynamical simulations, heavy r-process elements cannot be\nsynthesized in the neutrino-driven winds that follow the supernova explosion.\nHowever, by artificially increasing the wind entropy, elements up to A=195 can\nbe made. In this way one can reproduce the typical behavior of high-entropy\nejecta where the r-process is expected to occur. We identify which nuclear\nphysics input is more important depending on the dynamical evolution of the\nejecta. When the evolution proceeds at high temperatures (hot r-process), an\n(n,g)-(g,n) equilibrium is reached. While at low temperature (cold r-process)\nthere is a competition between neutron captures and beta decays. In the first\nphase of the r-process, while enough neutrons are available, the most relevant\nnuclear physics input are the nuclear masses for the hot r-process and the\nneutron capture and beta-decay rates for the cold r-process. At the end of this\nphase, the abundances follow a steady beta flow for the hot r-process and a\nsteady flow of neutron captures and beta decays for the cold r-process. After\nneutrons are almost exhausted, matter decays to stability and our results show\nthat in both cases neutron captures are key for determining the final\nabundances, the position of the r-process peaks, and the formation of the\nrare-earth peak.

Surrounded by a decay electron detector, the lifetime\nof muons in hydrogen can be measured to determine the singlet capture rate\nLambda_s to a final precision of 1%. The capture rate determines the nucleon's\npseudoscalar form factor g_p. A first result, g_p = 7.3 +- 1.1, has been\npublished and the final analysis of the full statistics will reduce the error\nby a factor of up to 3. Muon capture on the deuteron probes the weak axial\ncurrent in the two-nucleon system.

The measured astrophysical factor\nfor this reaction is dominated by resonant capture through two strong\n$J^{\\pi}=1^{-}$ resonances at $E_{R}= 312$ and 962 keV and direct capture to\nthe ground state. Recently, a new measurement of the astrophysical factor for\nthe $^{15}{\\rm N}(p,\\gamma)^{16}{\\rm O}$ reaction has been published [P. J.\nLeBlanc {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. {\\bf C 82}, 055804 (2010)]. The analysis has\nbeen done using the $R$-matrix approach with unconstrained variation of all\nparameters including the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC). The best\nfit has been obtained for the square of the ANC $C^{2}= 539.2$ fm${}^{-1}$,\nwhich exceeds the previously measured value by a factor of $\\approx 3$. Here we\npresent a new $R$-matrix analysis of the Notre Dame-LUNA data with the fixed\nwithin the experimental uncertainties square of the ANC $C^{2}=200.34$\nfm${}^{-1}$. Rather than varying the ANC we add the contribution from a\nbackground resonance that effectively takes into account contributions from\nhigher levels. Altogether we present 8 fits, five unconstrained and three\nconstrained. In all the fits the ANC is fixed at the previously determined\nexperimental value $C^{2}=200.34$ fm${}^{-1}$. For the unconstrained fit with\nthe boundary condition $B_{c}=S_{c}(E_{2})$, where $E_{2}$ is the energy of the\nsecond level, we get $S(0)=39.0 \\pm 1.1 $ keVb and normalized ${\\tilde\n\\chi}^{2}=1.84$, i.e. the result which is similar to [P.

Interaction with nuclei\nplays crucial role in the cosmological evolution of OHe and in the effects of\nthese dark atoms as nuclear interacting dark matter. Slowed down in terrestrial\nmatter OHe atoms cause negligible effects of nuclear recoil in underground\ndetectors, but can experience radiative capture by nuclei. Local concentration\nof OHe in the matter of detectors is rapidly adjusted to the incoming flux of\ncosmic OHe and possess annual modulation due to Earth's orbital motion around\nthe Sun. The potential of OHe-nucleus interaction is determined by polarization\nof OHe by the Coulomb and nuclear force of the approaching nucleus. Stark-like\neffect by the Coulomb force of nucleus makes this potential attractive at\nlarger distances, while change of polarization by the effect of nuclear force\ngives rise to a potential barrier, preventing merging of nucleus with helium\nshell of OHe atom. The existence of the corresponding shallow well beyond the\nnucleus can provide the conditions, at which nuclei in the matter of DAMA/NaI\nand DAMA/LIBRA detectors have a few keV binding energy with OHe, corresponding\nto a level in this well.

However, the SM fails to explain the non-visible but\ngravitationally active part of the universe. Its nature is unknown but the\nconfirmation of a scalar Higgs is giving a boost to scalar-field-theories. So\nfar gravity experiments and observations performed at different distances find\nno deviation from Newton's gravity law. Therefore dark energy must possess a\nscreening mechanism which suppresses the scalar-mediated fifth force. Our line\nof attack is a novel gravity experiment with neutrons based on a quantum\ninterference technique. The spectroscopic measurement of quantum states on\nresonances with an external coupling makes this a powerful search for dark\nmatter and dark energy contributions in the universe. Quantum states in the\ngravity potential are intimately related to other scalar field or spin-0-bosons\nif they exist.

{"id": "1208.4951", "contents": "Title: Quenching of high-pT hadrons: Energy Loss vs Color Transparency Abstract: High-pT hadrons produced in hard collisions and detected inclusively bear\npeculiar features: (i) they originate from jets whose initial virtuality and\nenergy are of the same order; (ii) such jets are rare and have a very biased\nenergy sharing among the particles, namely, the detected hadron carries the\nmain fraction of the jet energy. The former feature leads to an extremely\nintensive gluon radiation and energy dissipation at the early stage of\nhadronization, either in vacuum or in a medium. As a result, a leading hadron\nmust be produced on a short length scale. Evaluation within a model of\nperturbative fragmentation confirms the shortness of the production length.\nThis result is at variance with the unjustified assumption of long production\nlength, made within the popular energy loss scenario. Thus we conclude that the\nmain reason of suppression of high-pT hadrons in heavy ion collisions is the\ncontrolled by color transparency attenuation of a high-pT dipole propagating\nthrough the hot medium. Adjusting a single parameter, the transport\ncoefficient, we describe quite well the data from LHC and RHIC for the\nsuppression factor R_{AA} as function of pT, collision energy and centrality.\nWe observe that the complementary effect of initial state interaction causes a\nflattening and even fall of R_{AA} at large pT. The azimuthal anisotropy of\nhadron production, calculated with no further adjustment, also agrees well with\ndata at different energies and centralities. \n\n"}

The cross-sections for electron bremsstrahlung and photon pair\nconversion are suppressed at high energies, by the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal\n(LPM) effect, lengthening electromagnetic showers. At still higher energies\n(above $10^{20}$ eV), photonuclear and electronuclear interactions dominate,\nand showers become predominantly hadronic. Muons interact much less strongly,\nso can travel long distances through solids before losing energy. Tau leptons\nbehave similarly, although their short livetime limits how far they can travel.\nThe hadronic interaction cross-section is believed to continue to increase\nslowly with rising energy; measurements of cosmic-ray air showers support this\nprediction. \n\n"}

Generally higher\ntemperatures and nuclear level densities lead to stronger contributions of\ntransitions on excited target states. This may prevent cross section\nmeasurements to determine stellar reaction rates and theory contributions\nremain important. Furthermore, measurements often are not feasible in the\nastrophysically relevant energy range. Sensitivity analysis allows not only to\ndetermine the contributing nuclear properties but also is a handy tool for\nexperimentalists to interpret the impact of their data on predicted cross\nsections and rates. It can also speed up future input variation studies of\nnucleosynthesis by simplifying an intermediate step in the full calculation\nsequence. Large-scale predictions of sensitivities and ground-state\ncontributions to the stellar rates are presented, allowing an estimate of how\nwell rates can be directly constrained by experiment. The reactions\n185W(n,gamma) and 186W(gamma,n) are discussed as application examples.

Heavy quark\nproduction has been studied by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC via measurements\nof single leptons from semi-leptonic decays in both the electron channel at\nmid-rapidity and in the muon channel at forward rapidity. A large suppression\nand azimuthal anisotropy of single electrons have been observed in Au+Au\ncollisions at 200 GeV.

They consist of a core and one or a few nucleons which spend most of\ntheir time in the classically-forbidden region outside the range of the\ninteraction. Individual nucleons inside the core are thus unresolved in the\nhalo configuration, and the low-energy effective interactions are short-range\nforces between the core and the valence nucleons. Similar phenomena occur in\nclusters of $^4$He atoms, cold atomic gases near a Feshbach resonance, and some\nexotic hadrons. In these weakly-bound quantum systems universal scaling laws\nfor s-wave binding emerge that are independent of the details of the\ninteraction. Effective field theory (EFT) exposes these correlations and\npermits the calculation of non-universal corrections to them due to\nshort-distance effects, as well as the extension of these ideas to systems\ninvolving the Coulomb interaction and/or binding in higher angular-momentum\nchannels.

The\ncorrections that lead to deviations from free streaming (and that dominate at\nlate proper time) would provide evidence for the onset of isotropization (and,\npossibly, thermalization) of the produced medium. To find such corrections we\ncalculate the late-time two-point Green function and the energy-momentum tensor\ndue to a single $2 \\to 2$ scattering process involving two classical fields. To\nmake the calculation tractable we employ the scalar $\\varphi^4$ theory instead\nof QCD.

However BDMPSZ also\npredicts an azimuthal broadening of di-jets also proportional to $\\hat{q}L$\nwhich has so far not been observed.

However, uncertainties in transport models (or model\ndependence) partly affect the reliability of the extracted result. In the\npresent work, by using the recently measured data of rapidity-dependent flows,\nwe constrain the incompressibility of nuclear matter and analyse the impact of\nmodel uncertainties on the obtained value. The method is based on the newly\nupdated version of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD)\nmodel in which the Skyrme potential energy-density functional is introduced.\nThree different Skyrme interactions which give different incompressibilities\nvarying from $K_0$=201 to 271 MeV are adopted. The incompressibility is deduced\nfrom the comparison of the UrQMD model simulations and the FOPI data for\nrapidity-dependent elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at beam energies\n0.4\\emph{A} - 1.0\\emph{A} GeV. The elliptic flow $v_2$ as a function of\nrapidity $y_0$ can be well described by a quadratic fit $v_2=v_{20} +\nv_{22}\\cdot y_0^2 $. It is found that the quantity $v_{2n}$ defined by\n$v_{2n}=|v_{20}|+|v_{22}|$ is quite sensitive to the incompressibility $K_0$\nand the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section, but not sensitive to the slope\nparameter $L$ of the nuclear symmetry energy.

For the latter, the determination of the\ncharge radius involves an extrapolation of the experimental form factor to zero\nmomentum transfer.\n  Purpose: To estimate the proton radius by introducing a novel non-parametric\napproach to model the electric form factor of the proton.\n  Methods: Within a Bayesian paradigm, we develop a model flexible enough to\nfit the data without any parametric assumptions on the form factor. The\nBayesian estimation is guided by imposing only two physical constraints on the\nform factor: (a) its value at zero momentum transfer (normalization) and (b)\nits overall shape, assumed to be a monotonically decreasing function of the\nmomentum transfer. Variants of these assumptions are explored to assess the\nimpact of these constraints.\n  Results: So far our results are inconclusive in regard to the proton puzzle,\nas they depend on both, the assumed constrains and the range of experimental\ndata used. For example, if only low momentum-transfer data is used, adopting\nonly the normalization constraint provides a value compatible with the smaller\nmuonic result, while imposing only the shape constraint favors the larger\nelectronic value.\n  Conclusions: We have presented a novel technique to estimate the proton\nradius from electron scattering data based on a non-parametric Gaussian\nprocess.

To date, most\njet modification studies have been based on comparing the jet properties\nmeasured in heavy-ion collisions to a proton-proton baseline at the same\nreconstructed jet transverse momentum ($p_T$). It is well known, however, that\nthe quenching of jets from their interaction with the medium leads to a\nmigration of jets from higher to lower $p_T$, making it challenging to directly\ninfer the degree and mechanism of jet energy loss. Our proposed quantile\nmatching procedure is inspired by (but not reliant on) the approximate\nmonotonicity of energy loss in the jet $p_T$. In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$). Furthermore, despite non-monotonic fluctuations in the energy\nloss, we use an event generator to validate the strong correlation between the\n$p_T$ of the parton that initiates a heavy-ion jet and the $p_T$ of the vacuum\njet which corresponds to it via the quantile procedure ($p_T^{\\rm quant}$). We\ndemonstrate that this strategy both provides a complementary way to study jet\nmodification and mitigates the effect of $p_T$ migration in heavy-ion\ncollisions. \n\n"}

Abstract: Direct photon production from a quark gluon plasma (QGP) in thermal\nequilibrium is studied directly in real time.

We point out that during such\nfinite QGP lifetime the spectrum of emitted photons carries information on the\ninitial state. There is an inherent ambiguity in separating the virtual from\nthe observable photons during the transient evolution of the QGP. We propose a\nreal time formulation to extract the photon yield which includes the initial\nstage of formation of the QGP parametrized by an effective time scale of\nformation $\\Gamma^{-1}$. This formulation coincides with the S-matrix approach\nin the infinite lifetime limit. It allows to separate the virtual cloud as well\nas the observable photons emitted during the pre- equilibrium stage from the\nyield during the QGP lifetime.

The reaction is characterized by a high\ndegree of transparency of the collisions partners leading to the formation of a\nbaryon-poor central region.

In E850 the angular dependence of the\nnuclear transparency near 90 Deg. c.m., and the nuclear transparency for\ndeuterons was studied. Second, we review the techniques used in an earlier\nexperiment, E834, and show that the two experiments are consistent for the\nCarbon data. E834 also determines the nuclear transparencies for Li, Al, Cu,\nand Pb nuclei as well as for C. We find for both E850 and E834 that the A(p,2p)\nnuclear transparency, unlike that for A(e,e'p) nuclear transparency, is\nincompatible with a constant value versus energy as predicted by Glauber\ncalculations. The A(p,2p) nuclear transparency for C and Al increases by a\nfactor of two between 5.9 and 9.5 GeV/c incident proton momentum. At its peak\nthe A(p,2p) nuclear transparency is about 80% of the constant A(e,e'p) nuclear\ntransparency. Then the nuclear transparency falls back to the Glauber level\nagain. This oscillating behavior is generally interpreted as an interplay\nbetween two components of the pN scattering amplitude; one short ranged and\nperturbative, and the other long ranged and strongly absorbed in the nuclear\nmedium. We suggest a number of experiments for further studies of nuclear\ntransparency effects. \n\n"}

The present study\nfocuses on heavy projectile fragments produced in peripheral and semiperipheral\ncollisions near the onset of multifragment emission E*/A = 2-3 MeV).

The excitation energies, in turn, are used to estimate the\ntemperatures of the fragmenting quasiprojectiles in the framework the Fermi gas\nmodel. The isoscaling analysis of the fragment yields provided the isoscaling\nparameters \"alpha\" which, in combination with temperatures and isospin\nasymmetries provided the symmetry energy coefficient of the nuclear binding\nenergy of the hot fragmenting quasiprojectiles. The extracted values of the\nsymmetry energy coefficient at this excitation energy range (2-3 MeV/nucleon)\nare lower than the typical liquid-drop model value ~25 MeV corresponding to\nground-state nuclei and show a monotonic decrease with increasing excitation\nenergy.

Abstract: The centrality dependence of (multi-)strange hadron abundances is studied for\nPb(158 AGeV)Pb reactions and compared to p(158 GeV)Pb collisions. The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity. For Omega's, the predicted enhancement can be as\nlarge as one order of magnitude. Comparisons of Pb-Pb data to proton induced\nasymmetric (p-A) collisions are hampered due to the predicted strong asymmetry\nin the various rapidity distributions of the different (strange) particle\nspecies. In p-Pb collisions, strangeness is locally (in rapidity) not\nconserved. The present comparison to the data of the WA97 and NA49\ncollaborations clearly supports the suggestion that conventional (free)\nhadronic scenarios are unable to describe the observed high (anti-)hyperon\nyields in central collisions. The doubling of the strangeness to nonstrange\nsuppression factor, gamma_s \\approx 0.65, might be interpreted as a signal of a\nphase of nearly massless particles. \n\n"}
{"id": "nucl-th/9908013", "contents": "Title: Looking For Disoriented Chiral Condensates From Pion Distributions Abstract: We suggest two methods for the detection of the formation of disoriented\nchiral condensates in heavy ion collisions. We show that the variance in the\nnumber of charged pions (in a suitable range of momentum space) provides a\nsignature for the observation of a disoriented chiral condensate. The signal\nshould be observable even if multiple domains of D$\\chi$C form provided the\naverage number of pions per domain is significantly larger than unity. The\nvariance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used\neven if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On\nthe other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral\npions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic\nregions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.\nHere we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts\nin the data. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$\npions with lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R>$\ncan be substantially different from 1/3. For example, for a single D$\\chi$C\ndomain without contamination due to incoherently emitted pions, $<R>$ is 3/5\ngiven the pion with lowest $p_T$ is neutral, and 5/7 given the two pions with\nlowest $p_T$ are both neutral, {\\it etc.}. The effects of multi-domain D$\\chi$C\nformation and noise due to incoherent pion emission can be systematically\nincorporated. Potential applications to experiments and their limitations are\nbriefly discussed. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/0106015", "contents": "Title: Staggering effects in nuclear and molecular spectra Abstract: It is shown that the recently observed Delta J = 2 staggering effect (i.e.\nthe relative displacement of the levels with angular momenta J, J+4, J+8, ...,\nrelatively to the levels with angular momenta J+2, J+6, J+10, ...) seen in\nsuperdeformed nuclear bands is also occurring in certain electronically excited\nrotational bands of diatomic molecules (YD, CrD, CrH, CoH), in which it is\nattributed to interband interactions (bandcrossings). In addition, the Delta J\n= 1 staggering effect (i.e. the relative displacement of the levels with even\nangular momentum J with respect to the levels of the same band with odd J) is\nstudied in molecular bands free from Delta J = 2 staggering (i.e. free from\ninterband interactions/bandcrossings). Bands of YD offer evidence for the\nabsence of any Delta J = 1 staggering effect due to the disparity of nuclear\nmasses, while bands of sextet electronic states of CrD demonstrate that Delta J\n= 1 staggering is a sensitive probe of deviations from rotational behaviour,\ndue in this particular case to the spin-rotation and spin-spin interactions. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/9706003", "contents": "Title: Ultimate luminosities and energies of photon colliders Abstract: A photon collider luminosity and its energy are determined by the parameters\nof an electron-electron linear collider (energy, power, beam emittances) and\ncollision effects. The main collision effect is the coherent e+e- pair\ncreation. At low energies (2E < 0.5 - 1 TeV) this process is suppressed due to\nrepulsion of electron beams. In this region gamma-gamma luminosity above\n10^{35} cm-2 s-1 is possible (10^{33} is sufficient). At higher energies the\nlimited average beam power and coherent pair creation restrict the maximum\nenergy of photon colliders (with sufficient luminosity) at 2E ~ 5 TeV.\nObtaining high luminosities requires the development of new methods of\nproduction beams with low emittances such as a laser cooling. \n\n"}
