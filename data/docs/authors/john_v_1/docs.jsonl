It is also possible\nthat the steps are too close to be resolved in the power spectrum, in which\ncase they may show up only in the non-Gaussianity of the CMB temperature\nfluctuations and/or EE polarization. We study two cases. In the slow-roll\nscenario where steps appear in the inflaton potential, the sensitivity of brane\ninflation to the height and width of the steps is increased by several orders\nof magnitude comparing to that in previously studied large field models. In the\nIR DBI scenario where steps appear in the warp factor, we find that the\nglitches in the power spectrum caused by these sharp features are generally\nsmall or even unobservable, but associated distinctive non-Gaussianity can be\nlarge. Together with its large negative running of the power spectrum index,\nthis scenario clearly illustrates how rich and different a brane inflationary\nscenario can be when compared to generic slow-roll inflation. Such distinctive\nstringy features may provide a powerful probe of superstring theory. \n\n"}

The\neffective tachyon potential consists on a negative constant related to the\ninternal curvature space and a polynomial with only quadratic and quartic terms\nof the tachyon field. Based on it, we present a solution for the tachyon field\nand the scale factor, which describes an accelerated universe which expands to\na maximum value before collapsing.

The value of the cosmological constant is determined by the\ncurvature of the internal space which also fixes the value of the vacuum\nenergy. As time evolves, inflation is present in our models, and it finishes\nlong before the collapsing.

To better understand such\nbehavior in quantum systems, we extend a known mapping (earlier studied in\nstochastic, or supersymmetric, quantum mechanics) between finite temperature\nclassical Fokker-Planck systems and related quantum systems at zero temperature\nto include general non-equilibrium dynamics. Unlike Feynman mappings or\nstochastic quantization methods (or holographic type dualities), the classical\nsystems that we consider and their quantum duals reside in the same number of\nspace-time dimensions. The upshot of our exact result is that a Wick rotation\nrelates (i) dynamics in general finite temperature classical dissipative\nsystems to (ii) zero temperature dynamics in the corresponding dual many-body\nquantum systems. Using this correspondence, we illustrate that, even in the\nabsence of imposed disorder, many continuum quantum fluid systems (and possible\nlattice counterparts) may exhibit a zero-point \"quantum dynamical\nheterogeneity\" wherein the dynamics, at a given instant, is spatially\nnon-uniform.

Applying an effective action approach, the most\ngeneral form of the free energy quadratic in the extrinsic curvature and\nextrinsic twist potential of stationary fluid brane configurations is\nconstructed to second order in a derivative expansion. This construction\ngeneralizes the Helfrich-Canham bending energy for fluid membranes studied in\ntheoretical biology to the case in which the fluid is rotating. It is found\nthat stationary fluid brane configurations are characterized by a set of 3\nelastic response coefficients, 3 hydrodynamic response coefficients and 1 spin\nresponse coefficient for co-dimension greater than one. Moreover, the elastic\ndegrees of freedom present in the system are coupled to the hydrodynamic\ndegrees of freedom.

Treating\nthe Universe as a dynamical system it is natural to assume that it is\nnon-linear: indeed, linearity is nothing more than approximation, while\nnon-linearity represents the generic case. It is evident that future models of\nthe Universe must take into account different aspects of its evolution. As soon\nas the scale factor is the only dynamical variable, the quantities which\ndetermine its time dependence must be essentially present in all aspects of the\nUniverse' evolution. Basic characteristics of the cosmological evolution, both\nstatic and dynamical, can be expressed in terms of the parameters ${{H}_{0}}$\nand ${{q}_{0}}$. The very parameters (and higher time derivatives of the scale\nfactor) enable us to construct model-independent kinematics of the cosmological\nexpansion.\n  Time dependence of the scale factor reflects main events in history of the\nUniverse.

On the ring edges the\nbag (infinite mass) boundary conditions are imposed for the field operator.\nThis leads to the Casimir type effect on the vacuum characteristics. The radial\ncurrent vanishes. The charge and the azimuthal current are decomposed into the\nboundary-free and boundary-induced contributions. Both these contributions are\nodd periodic functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux\nquantum. An important feature that distinguishes the VEVs of the charge and\ncurrent densities from the VEV of the energy density, is their finiteness on\nthe ring edges. The current density is equal to the charge density for the\nouter edge and has the opposite sign on the inner edge. The VEVs are peaked\nnear the inner edge and, as functions of the field mass, exhibit quite\ndifferent features for two inequivalent representations of the Clifford\nalgebra.

In this\npaper, we generalize the concept of butterfly velocity beyond the thermal case\nto a large class of other subspaces. Based on holographic duality, we consider\nthe code subspace of low energy excitations on a classical background geometry.\nUsing local reconstruction of bulk operators, we prove a general relation\nbetween the boundary butterfly velocities (of different operators) and the bulk\ncausal structure.

In particular, the enhancement of correlation length\nfor periodic boundary conditions becomes more pronounced at large N, and\npractically does not depend on N for twisted boundary conditions. Using\nGradient Flow we study non-perturbative content of the theory and find that the\npeaks in the correlation length appear when the length L0 becomes comparable\nwith the typical size of unitons, unstable saddle points of PCM. With twisted\nboundary conditions these saddle points become effectively stable and\none-dimensional in the regime of small N L0, whereas at large N L0 they are\nvery similar to the two-dimensional unitons with periodic boundary conditions.\nIn the context of adiabatic continuity conjecture for PCM with twisted boundary\nconditions, our results suggest that while the effect of the compactification\nis clearly different for different boundary conditions, one still cannot\nexclude the possibility of a weak crossover separating the strong-coupling\nregime at large N L0 and the Dunne-Unsal regime at small N L0 with twisted\nboundary conditions. \n\n"}

The latter can be formally interpreted\nin terms of a magnetic flux treading the compact dimensions. In the compact\nsubspace, the field operator obeys quasiperiodicity conditions with arbitrary\nphases. The VEV of the charge density is zero and the current density has\nnonzero components along the compact dimensions only. They are periodic\nfunctions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux quantum and\ntend to zero on the AdS boundary. Near the horizon, the effect of the\nbackground gravitational field is small and the leading term in the\ncorresponding asymptotic expansion coincides with the VEV for a massless field\nin the locally Minkowski bulk.

This heavy-flavor QCD is\nchosen as the simplest available context in which the dynamics of quark and\ngluon bound states can be studied with the required rigor using Minkowski-space\nHamiltonian operators in the Fock space, taking the advantage of asymptotic\nfreedom. The effective quarks and gluons differ from the point-like canonical\nones by having a finite size $s$. Their size plays the role of renormalization\ngroup parameter. However, instead of integrating out high-energy degrees of\nfreedom, our RGPEP procedure is based on a transformation of the front-form QCD\nHamiltonian from its canonical form with counterterms to the renormalized,\nscale-dependent operator that acts in the Fock space of effective quanta of\nquark and gluon fields, keeping all degrees of freedom intact but accounting\nfor them in a transformed form. We discuss different behavior of effective\nparticles interacting at different energy scales, corresponding to different\nsize s. Namely, we cover phenomena ranging from asymptotic freedom at highest\nenergies down to the scales at which the formation of bound states occurs. We\nbriefly present recent applications of the RGPEP to quarks and gluons in QCD,\nwhich have been developed using expansion in powers of the Fock-space\nHamiltonian running coupling. After observing that the QCD effective\nHamiltonian satisfies the requirement of producing asymptotic freedom, we\nderive the leading effective interaction between quarks in heavy-flavor QCD. An\neffective confining effect is derived as a result of assuming that the\nnon-Abelian and non-perturbative dynamics causes effective gluons to have mass. \n\n"}

The two\nmost promising effective models for early universe cosmology, inflation and\nekpyrosis, are mechanisms that, in order to address cosmological puzzles, must\noperate over vast expansion/energy ranges. This suggests that it might be\nappropriate to describe them using scaling laws. Here we combine these two\nideas and demonstrate that they drive inflation and ekpyrosis to their\nextremes: inflation must start at ultra-slow-roll, and ekpyrosis at\nultra-fast-roll. At face value, the implied spectra are overly tilted to the\nred, although in both cases minor departures from pure scale freedom bring the\nspectral indices within current observational bounds. These models predict a\nsignificant spectral running at a level detectable in the near future\n($\\alpha_s \\approx -10^{-3}$).

These unusual\nelectromagnetic responses can be characterized by an axion term $\\theta\n\\textbf{E} \\cdot \\textbf{B}$ with space and time dependent axion angle $\\theta\n(\\textbf{r} ,t)$. In this paper we compute the electromagnetic fields produced\nby an electric charge near to a topological Weyl semimetal with two Weyl nodes\nin the bulk Brillouin zone. We find that, as in ordinary metals and\ndielectrics, outside the WSM the electric field is mainly determined by the\noptical properties of the material. The magnetic field is, on the contrary, of\ntopological origin in nature due to the magnetoelectric effect of topological\nphases.

To obtain bounds on\ncolor-triplets and color-singlets of charges up to |Q|=8, we recast searches\nfor signatures of two production channels: the \"open\" channel - where the\nparticles are pair-produced above threshold, and are detectable in dedicated\nLHC searches for stable multiply charged leptons, and the \"closed\" channel -\nwhere a particle-antiparticle pair is produced as a bound state, detectable in\nsearches for a diphoton resonance.

In our rather general framework (which also comprises\nstructures which are far away from continuum differential geometry), there is\nin general nothing like a Ricci tensor or a curvature scalar. Because of the\nnon-locality of tensor products (over the algebra of functions) of forms,\ncorresponding components (with respect to some module basis) turn out to be\nrather non-local objects. But one can make use of the parallel transport\nassociated with a connection to `localize' such objects and in certain cases\nthere is a distinguished way to achieve this. This leads to covariant\ncomponents of the curvature tensor which then allow a contraction to a Ricci\ntensor. In the case of a differential calculus associated with a hypercubic\nlattice we propose a new discrete analogue of the (vacuum) Einstein equations. \n\n"}

Unlike its five dimensional Kaluza-Klein\ncompactification, the universal covering space of this manifold has no\ncausality violations. In other words, causal anomalies can be solved in higher\ndimensions.

The first abelian state is a generalized (331) state which\ndescribes clustering of k distinguishable electrons and reproduces the\nparafermion state upon symmetrization over the electron coordinates. This\ndescription yields simple expressions for the quasi-particle wave functions of\nthe parafermion state. The second abelian state is realized by a conformal\ntheory with a (2k-1)-dimensional chiral charge lattice and it reduces to the\nZ_k-parafermion state via the coset construction su(k)_1+su(k)_1/su(k)_2. The\ndetailed study of this construction provides us a complete account of the\nexcitations of the parafermion Hall state, including the field identifications,\nthe Z_k symmetry and the partition function. \n\n"}

As standard star products are not correct for such manifolds, the\nstandard non-commutative CS theory is not also appropriate here. Instead we\nformulate a new finite-dimensional matrix CS model as an approximation to the\nCS theory on the strip. A work which has points of contact with ours is due to\nLizzi, Vitale and Zampini where the authors obtain a description for the fuzzy\ndisc.

A particular type of Grassmann\nintegral equations is explicitly studied for certain low-dimensional Grassmann\nalgebras. The choice of the equation under investigation is motivated by the\neffective action formalism of (lattice) quantum field theory. In a very general\nsetting, for the Grassmann algebras G_2n, n = 2,3,4, the finite-dimensional\nanalogues of the generating functionals of the Green functions are worked out\nexplicitly by solving a coupled system of nonlinear matrix equations. Finally,\nby imposing the condition G[{\\bar\\Psi},{\\Psi}] = G_0[{\\lambda\\bar\\Psi},\n{\\lambda\\Psi}] + const., 0<\\lambda\\in R (\\bar\\Psi_k, \\Psi_k, k=1,...,n, are the\ngenerators of the Grassmann algebra G_2n), between the finite-dimensional\nanalogues G_0 and G of the (``classical'') action and effective action\nfunctionals, respectively, a special Grassmann integral equation is being\nestablished and solved which also is equivalent to a coupled system of\nnonlinear matrix equations.
