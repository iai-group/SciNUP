Several classical formulas have\nbeen derived for certain integers $s$ by Euler, Jacobi, Klein, Fricke, Atkin,\nWinquist, Dyson and Macdonald. In particular, Macdonald obtained expansion\nformulas for the integer exponents $s$ for which there exists a semi-simple Lie\nalgebra of dimension $s$.

In this paper we consider the\nproblem of finding normal forms and functional invariants at each type of\npoint. We also require that functional invariants are \"complete\" in the sense\nthat they permit to recognize locally isometric structures. The problem happens\nto be equivalent to the one of finding a smooth canonical parameterized curve\npassing through the point and being transversal to the distribution. For\nRiemannian points such that the gradient of the Gaussian curvature $K$ is\ndifferent from zero, we use the level set of $K$ as support of the\nparameterized curve. For Riemannian points such that the gradient of the\ncurvature vanishes (and under additional generic conditions), we use a curve\nwhich is found by looking for crests and valleys of the curvature. For Grushin\npoints we use the set where the vector fields are parallel. Tangency points are\nthe most complicated to deal with. The cut locus from the tangency point is not\na good candidate as canonical parameterized curve since it is known to be\nnon-smooth. Thus, we analyse the cut locus from the singular set and we prove\nthat it is not smooth either. A good candidate appears to be a curve which is\nfound by looking for crests and valleys of the Gaussian curvature. We prove\nthat the support of such a curve is uniquely determined and has a canonical\nparametrization. \n\n"}

Moreover, we present an explicit volume\nformula for the tubular neighborhood of a p-adic fractal string Lp, expressed\nin terms of the underlying complex dimensions. Special attention will be\nfocused on p-adic self-similar strings, in which the nonarchimedean theory\ntakes a more natural form than its archimedean counterpart. In contrast with\nthe archimedean setting, all p-adic self-similar strings are lattice and hence,\ntheir complex dimensions (as well as their zeros) are periodically distributed\nalong finitely many vertical lines.

The coefficient of the convex combination in the modified\nBFGS algorithm is dynamically chosen in every iteration.

We show in\nparticular that this exponential growth rate is strictly positive in the\nrelative interior of the limit cone and that there exists a unique slope for\nwhich it is maximal and equal to the critical exponent.\n  We notice that an interesting class of product spaces as above comes from the\nsecond alternative in the Rank Rigidity Theorem for CAT(0)-cube complexes:\nGiven a finite-dimensional CAT(0)-cube complex X and a group G of automorphisms\nwithout fixed point in the geometric compactification of X, then either G\ncontains a rank one isometry or there exists a convex F-invariant subcomplex of\nX which is a product of two unbounded cube subcomplexes; in the latter case one\ninductively gets a convex G-invariant subcomplex of X which can be decomposed\ninto a finite product of rank one Hadamard spaces. So our results imply in\nparticular that classical properties of discrete subgroups of higher rank Lie\ngroups (as stated e.g. by Y. Benoist and J.F. Quint) also hold for certain\ndiscrete isometry groups of reducible CAT(0)-cube complexes. \n\n"}

We establish\ncombinatorial conditions on subsets S and T of Fourier basis elements under\nwhich nonnegative functions with Fourier support S are sums of squares of\nfunctions with Fourier support T. Our combinatorial condition involves\nconstructing a chordal cover of a graph related to G and S (the Cayley graph\nCay($\\hat{G}$,S)) with maximal cliques related to T. Our result relies on two\nmain ingredients: the decomposition of sparse positive semidefinite matrices\nwith a chordal sparsity pattern, as well as a simple but key observation\nexploiting the structure of the Fourier basis elements of G.\n  We apply our general result to two examples. First, in the case where $G =\n\\mathbb{Z}_2^n$, by constructing a particular chordal cover of the half-cube\ngraph, we prove that any nonnegative quadratic form in n binary variables is a\nsum of squares of functions of degree at most $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$, establishing\na conjecture of Laurent.

This has implications for\ntools such as Optimal Power Flow (OPF), an optimization problem widely used in\npower system operations and planning, which should be adjusted to account for\nthis uncertainty. One way to handle the uncertainty is to formulate a Chance\nConstrained OPF (CC-OPF) which limits the probability of constraint violation\nto a predefined value. However, existing CC-OPF formulations and solutions are\nnot immune to drawbacks. On one hand, they only consider affine policies for\ngeneration control, which are not always realistic and may be sub-optimal. On\nthe other hand, the standard CC-OPF formulations do not distinguish between\nlarge and small violations, although those might carry significantly different\nrisk. In this paper, we introduce the Weighted CC-OPF (WCC-OPF) that can handle\ngeneral control policies while preserving convexity and allowing for efficient\ncomputation. The weighted chance constraints account for the size of violations\nthrough a weighting function, which assigns a higher risk to a higher\noverloads.

This paper\npresents an efficient scheme to minimize compression costs under dynamic\nconditions where deliveries to customers are described by time-dependent mass\nflow. The optimization scheme relies on a compact representation of gas flow\nphysics, a trapezoidal discretization in time and space, and a two-stage\napproach to minimize energy costs and maximize smoothness.

While this certainly enhances\nthe quality of the calibration, it makes it difficult to accommodate\nuser-imposed bounds on the model parameters such as restricting the market\npower parameters to the interval [0,1], which is a common requirement in\nconjectural variations approaches. We propose an algorithm to calibrate the\nsuppliers' sales and simultaneously deal with user-defined bounds on\nparameters.

Thereby, the user controls whether price\nelasticities and anchor prices should be close to their reference values, or\nthe suppliers' sales. The algorithm is tested on data from the European gas\nmarket, and required less than one minute to identify calibrated parameters.\nOur algorithm is widely applicable, since it is based on mild (and common)\nunderlying assumptions and can be configured to suit a specific purpose thanks\nto the inclusion of user-defined bounds on all relevant parameters. \n\n"}

Both rigid and non-rigid shape matching problems can be formulated as\nPM problems. Recently [Maron et al.] presented a novel convex semi-definite\nprogramming relaxation (PM-SDP) for PM which achieves state of the art results\non common shape matching benchmarks.\n  In this paper we analyze the successfulness of PM-SDP in solving PM problems\nwithout noise (Exact PM problems). We begin by showing Exact PM to be\ncomputationally equivalent to the graph isomorphism problem. We demonstrate\nsome natural theoretical properties of the relaxation, and use these properties\ntogether with the moment interpretation of [Lasserre] to show that for exact PM\nproblems and for (generic) input shapes which are asymmetric or bilaterally\nsymmetric, the relaxation returns a correct solution of PM.\n  For symmetric shapes, PM has multiple solutions. The non-convex set of\noptimal solutions of PM is strictly contained in the convex set of optimal\nsolutions of PM-SDP, so that `most' solutions of PM-SDP will not be solutions\nof PM. We deal with this by showing the solution set of PM to be the extreme\npoints of the solution set of PM-SDP, and suggesting a random algorithm which\nreturns a solution of PM with probability one, and returns all solutions of PM\nwith equal probability. We also show these results can be extended to the\nalmost-exact case.\n  To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to achieve exact recovery\nin the presence of multiple solutions. \n\n"}

In\nall cases there is calculated for each successive time-step the cost function\nmeasuring the total impact of whatever action is taken by the storage. The\nsuccession of such cost functions provides the information for the storage to\ndetermine how to behave over time, forming the basis of the appropriate\noptimisation problem.

Here we determine $f(n,k,\\varepsilon)$ up to a\nconstant factor for all $n \\geq k \\geq 1$ and all $\\varepsilon \\geq\n\\frac{1}{n^{0.49}}$. Our proof is algorithmic, and provides an efficient\nalgorithm for computing a sketch of size $O(f(n,k,\\varepsilon)/n)$ for each\npoint, so that the square of the distance between any two points can be\ncomputed from their sketches up to an additive error of $\\varepsilon$ in time\nlinear in the length of the sketches. We also discuss the case of smaller\n$\\varepsilon>2/\\sqrt n$ and obtain some new results about dimension reduction\nin this range. In particular, we show that for any such $\\varepsilon$ and any\n$k \\leq t=\\frac{\\log (2+\\varepsilon^2 n)}{\\varepsilon^2}$ there are\nconfigurations of $n$ points in $R^k$ that cannot be embedded in $R^{\\ell}$ for\n$\\ell < ck$ with $c$ a small absolute positive constant, without distorting\nsome inner products (and distances) by more than $\\varepsilon$. On the positive\nside, we provide a randomized polynomial time algorithm for a bipartite variant\nof the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma in which scalar products are approximated up\nto an additive error of at most $\\varepsilon$. This variant allows a reduction\nof the dimension down to $O(\\frac{\\log (2+\\varepsilon^2 n)}{\\varepsilon^2})$,\nwhere $n$ is the number of points. \n\n"}

These methods are based on augmenting the objective with\na penalty function, which is specified based on prior domain-specific expertise\nto induce a desired structure in the solution. We consider the problem of\nlearning suitable regularization functions from data in settings in which\nprecise domain knowledge is not directly available. Previous work under the\ntitle of `dictionary learning' or `sparse coding' may be viewed as learning a\nregularization function that can be computed via linear programming. We\ndescribe generalizations of these methods to learn regularizers that can be\ncomputed and optimized via semidefinite programming. Our framework for learning\nsuch semidefinite regularizers is based on obtaining structured factorizations\nof data matrices, and our algorithmic approach for computing these\nfactorizations combines recent techniques for rank minimization problems along\nwith an operator analog of Sinkhorn scaling. Under suitable conditions on the\ninput data, our algorithm provides a locally linearly convergent method for\nidentifying the correct regularizer that promotes the type of structure\ncontained in the data. Our analysis is based on the stability properties of\nOperator Sinkhorn scaling and their relation to geometric aspects of\ndeterminantal varieties (in particular tangent spaces with respect to these\nvarieties).

However, our understanding to\nthese algorithms is limited because the current convergence of asynchronous\n(block) coordinate descent algorithms are based on somewhat unrealistic\nassumptions. In particular, the age of the shared optimization variables being\nused to update a block is assumed to be independent of the block being updated.\nAlso, it is assumed that the updates are applied to randomly chosen blocks. In\nthis paper, we argue that these assumptions either fail to hold or will imply\nless efficient implementations. We then prove the convergence of\nasynchronous-parallel block coordinate descent under more realistic\nassumptions, in particular, always without the independence assumption. The\nanalysis permits both the deterministic (essentially) cyclic and random rules\nfor block choices. Because a bound on the asynchronous delays may or may not be\navailable, we establish convergence for both bounded delays and unbounded\ndelays. The analysis also covers nonconvex, weakly convex, and strongly convex\nfunctions. We construct Lyapunov functions that directly model both objective\nprogress and delays, so delays are not treated errors or noise.

Methodology\ntakes as an input projected economic development, expressed through a paced\ngrowth of the system loads, as well as uncertainties, expressed through\nmultiple scenarios of the growth. We price new devices according to their\ncapacities. Installation cost contributes to the optimization objective in\ncombination with the cost of operations integrated over time and averaged over\nthe scenarios. The multi-stage (-time-frame) optimization aims to achieve a\ngradual distribution of new resources in space and time. Constraints on the\ninvestment budget, or equivalently constraint on building capacity, is\nintroduced at each time frame. Our approach adjusts operationally not only\nnewly installed FACTS devices but also other already existing flexible degrees\nof freedom. This complex optimization problem is stated using the most general\nAC Power Flows. Non-linear, non-convex, multiple-scenario and multi-time-frame\noptimization is resolved via efficient heuristics, consisting of a sequence of\nalternating Linear Programmings or Quadratic Programmings (depending on the\ngeneration cost) and AC-PF solution steps designed to maintain operational\nfeasibility for all scenarios.

One most important advantage of the framework is that the\noptimal capacity of FACTS is build up gradually at each time frame in a limited\nnumber of locations, thus allowing to prepare the system better for possible\ncongestion due to future economic and other uncertainties. \n\n"}

The tracks are\nspatially discretized into segments (or blocks) and the train dynamics are\ndescribed by a discrete event system where the variables are the $k^{th}$\ndeparture times from each segment.

The Max-plus algebra model allows to analytically\nderive the asymptotic average train frequency as a function of many parameters,\nincluding train travel times, minimum safety intervals, the total number of\ntrains on the line and the number of trains on each branch.

The definition of total dual integrality (TDI) revolves\naround the existence of optimal dual solutions that are integral, and thus\nnaturally applies to a host of combinatorial optimization problems that are\ncast as integer programs whose LP relaxations have the TDIness property.\nHowever, when combinatorial problems are formulated using more general convex\nrelaxations, such as semidefinite programs (SDPs), it is not at all clear what\nan appropriate notion of integrality in the dual program is, thus inhibiting\nthe generalization of the theory to more general forms of structured convex\noptimization. (In fact, we argue that the rank-one constraint usually added to\nSDP relaxations is not adequate in the dual SDP.)\n  In this paper, we propose a notion of total dual integrality for SDPs that\ngeneralizes the notion for LPs, by relying on an \"integrality constraint\" for\nSDPs that is primal-dual symmetric. A key ingredient for the theory is a\ngeneralization to compact convex sets of a result of Hoffman for polytopes,\nfundamental for generalizing the polyhedral notion of total dual integrality\nintroduced by Edmonds and Giles. We study the corresponding theory applied to\nSDP formulations for stable sets in graphs using the Lov\\'asz theta function\nand show that total dual integrality in this case corresponds to the underlying\ngraph being perfect.

Thus the departure time user\nequilibrium (DTUE), the arrival time user equilibrium (ATUE), and the\nscheduling payoff user equilibrium (SPUE) are uniquely determined by the\nstationary state of the LWR model, which was shown to be locally,\nasymptotically stable with analysis of the discrete approximation of the LWR\nmodel and through a numerical example. In this study attempt to analytically\nprove the global stability of the SPUE, ATUE, and DTUE. We first generalize the\nconceptual models for arrival time and scheduling payoff choices developed in\n(Jin, 2018) for a single bottleneck with a generalized scheduling cost\nfunction, which includes the cost of the free-flow travel time. Then we present\nthe LWR model for the day-to-day dynamics for the scheduling payoff choice as\nwell as the SPUE.

This GS-ADMM partitions the data\ninto two group variables so that one group consists of $p$ block variables\nwhile the other has $q$ block variables, where $p \\ge 1$ and $q \\ge 1$ are two\nintegers. The two grouped variables are updated in a {\\it Gauss-Seidel} scheme,\nwhile the variables within each group are updated in a {\\it Jacobi} scheme,\nwhich would make it very attractive for a big data setting.

It was introduced by Michael Fisher and applications of the model to\nvarious wetting and melting phenomena were described in his Boltzmann medal\nlecture. In the present report, we explain interesting connections among\nrepresentation theory, probability theory, and random matrix theory using this\nsimple diffusion particle system. Each vicious walk of $N$ walkers is\nrepresented by an $N$-tuple of nonintersecting lattice paths on the\nspatio-temporal plane. There is established a simple bijection between\nnonintersecting lattice paths and semistandard Young tableaux. Based on this\nbijection and some knowledge of symmetric polynomials called the Schur\nfunctions, we can give a determinantal expression to the partition function of\nvicious walks, which is regarded as a special case of the Karlin-McGregor\nformula in the probability theory (or the Lindstr\\\"om-Gessel-Viennot formula in\nthe enumerative combinatorics). Due to a basic property of Schur function, we\ncan take the diffusion scaling limit of the vicious walks and define a\nnoncolliding system of Brownian particles. This diffusion process solves the\nstochastic differential equations with the drift terms acting as the repulsive\ntwo-body forces proportional to the inverse of distances between particles, and\nthus it is identified with Dyson's Brownian motion model.

We\nthen extend this new algorithm so that it solves the linear integer feasibility\nproblem with promising results for equality knapsack problems. We also present\na novel Groebner basis approach to solve a particular integer linear program as\nopposed to previous Groebner basis methods that effectively solved many\ndifferent integer linear programs simultaneously. Initial results indicate that\nthis optimisation algorithm performs better than previous Groebner basis\nmethods. \n\n"}

Here, we add a constructive\napproach, based on the arithmetic of the quaternion algebra $\\mathbb{H}\n(\\mathbb{Q} (\\sqrt{5}))$ and the existence of a particular involution of the\nsecond kind, which also provides the actual sublattices and the number of\ndifferent solutions for a given index.

We have developed rewriting procedures for Kan\nextensions (over the category of sets) and this enables one program to address\na wide range of problems. Thus it is possible to use the same framework (and\ntherefore program) to enumerate monoid or group (or category of groupoid)\nelements, to enumerate cosets or congruence classes on monoids, calculate\nequivariant equivalence relations, induced actions of groups, monoids or\ncategories and even more.

{"id": "math/9908016", "contents": "Title: A sagbi basis for the quantum Grassmannian Abstract: The maximal minors of a p by (m + p) matrix of univariate polynomials of\ndegree n with indeterminate coefficients are themselves polynomials of degree\nnp. The subalgebra generated by their coefficients is the coordinate ring of\nthe quantum Grassmannian, a singular compactification of the space of rational\ncurves of degree np in the Grassmannian of p-planes in (m + p)-space. These\nsubalgebra generators are shown to form a sagbi basis. The resulting flat\ndeformation from the quantum Grassmannian to a toric variety gives a new\n`Gr\\\"obner basis style' proof of the Ravi-Rosenthal-Wang formulas in quantum\nSchubert calculus. The coordinate ring of the quantum Grassmannian is an\nalgebra with straightening law, which is normal, Cohen-Macaulay, Gorenstein and\nKoszul, and the ideal of quantum Pl\\\"ucker relations has a quadratic Gr\\\"obner\nbasis. This holds more generally for skew quantum Schubert varieties. These\nresults are well-known for the classical Schubert varieties (n=0). We also show\nthat the row-consecutive p by p-minors of a generic matrix form a sagbi basis\nand we give a quadratic Gr\\\"obner basis for their algebraic relations. \n\n"}
