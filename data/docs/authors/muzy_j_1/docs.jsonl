In the YRZ ansatz a\nconstant RVB gap is assumed which leads to Luttinger zeros along the\nantiferromagnetic Brillouin zone (AFBZ) and four Fermi pockets centered on the\nnodal directions. We relax the assumption of a constant RVB gap function,\ntreating it as a Ising order parameter accompanied by thermal fluctuations. If\nthese thermal fluctuations are very strong leading to strictly short range\ncorrelations in the spatial dependence of the RVB gap, then the reconstruction\nof the Fermi surface into pockets will not survive. We examined the\nintermediate case of critical fluctuations leading to a power law falloff of\nthe RVB gap correlations. To this end we followed the analysis recently\ndeveloped by two of us to treat the effect of the power law correlations in the\nantiferromagnetic 2-dimensional xy model on the single electron Green's\nfunction. The partial truncation of the Fermi surface to form pockets survives\nin the presence of power law correlations. The linewidth of the quasiparticle\npeaks increases with the exponent of the power law correlations.

As such, our results apply to\nrather broad Potts spin glass type systems. Community detection describes the\ngeneral problem of partitioning a complex system involving many elements into\noptimally decoupled \"communities\" of such elements. We report on phase\ntransitions between solvable and unsolvable regimes. Solvable region may\nfurther split into \"easy\" and \"hard\" phases. Spin glass type phase transitions\nappear at both low and high temperatures (or noise). Low temperature\ntransitions correspond to an \"order by disorder\" type effect wherein\nfluctuations render the system ordered or solvable.

Earth-like habitable-zone (HZ) planets maintain stable surface\nliquid water over geological time. This requires equilibrium between the\ntemperature-dependent rate of greenhouse-gas consumption by weathering,and\ngreenhouse-gas resupply by other processes. Detected small-radius exoplanets,\nand anticipated M-dwarf HZ rocky planets, are expected to be tidally locked. We\ninvestigate two feedbacks that can destabilize climate on tidally-locked\nplanets. (1) If small changes in pressure alter the temperature distribution\nacross a planet's surface such that the weathering rate increases when the\npressure decreases, a positive feedback occurs involving increasing weathering\nrate near the substellar point, decreasing pressure, and increasing substellar\nsurface temperature. (2) When decreases in pressure increase the surface area\nabove the melting point (through reduced advective cooling of the substellar\npoint), and the corresponding increase in volume of liquid causes net\ndissolution of the atmosphere, a further decrease in pressure occurs. We use an\nidealized energy balance model to map out the conditions under which these\ninstabilities may occur. The weathering runaway can shrink the habitable zone,\nand cause geologically rapid 10^3-fold pressure shifts within the HZ. Mars may\nhave undergone a weathering runaway in the past. Substellar dissolution is\nusually a negative feedback or weak positive feedback on changes in pressure.\nBoth instabilities are suppressed if the atmosphere has a high radiative\nefficiency.

The regime of large deviations is separated\nfrom the regime of typical fluctuations by a phase transition where the\nsymmetry between the points in the sample is spontaneously broken. For\nstochastic processes with a fat tailed microscopic noise, this implies that\nwhile typical realizations are well described by a diffusion process with\ncontinuous sample paths, large deviation paths are typically discontinuous. For\neigenvalues of random matrices with fat tailed distributed elements, a large\ndeviation where the trace of the matrix is anomalously large concentrates on\njust a single eigenvalue, whereas in the thin tailed world the large deviation\naffects the whole distribution. These results find a natural application to\nfinance. Since the price dynamics of financial stocks is characterized by fat\ntailed increments, large fluctuations of stock prices are expected to be\nrealized by discrete jumps. Interestingly, we find that large excursions of\nprices are more likely realized by continuous drifts rather than by\ndiscontinuous jumps. Indeed, auto-correlations suppress the concentration of\nlarge deviations. Financial covariance matrices also exhibit an anomalously\nlarge eigenvalue, the market mode, as compared to the prediction of random\nmatrix theory. We show that this is explained by a large deviation with excess\ncovariance rather than by one with excess volatility. \n\n"}

The Weyl node splitting is achieved most easily in this\nsystem by breaking time-reversal (TR) symmetry, for example by magnetic doping.\nIf, however, spatial inversion (I) symmetry remains, the Weyl nodes will occur\nat the same energy, making it possible to align the Fermi energy simultaneously\nwith both nodes. The goal of this work is to explore the consequences of\nbreaking the I symmetry in this system.

The leak can have a natural origin, it\ncan mimic measurement devices, and it can also be used to reveal dynamical\nproperties of the closed system. In this paper we provide an unified treatment\nof leaking systems and we review applications to different physical problems,\nboth in the classical and quantum pictures. Our treatment is based on the\ntransient chaos theory of open systems, which is essential because real leaks\nhave finite size and therefore estimations based on the closed system differ\nessentially from observations. The field of applications reviewed is very\nbroad, ranging from planetary astronomy and hydrodynamical flows, to plasma\nphysics and quantum fidelity. The theory is expanded and adapted to the case of\npartial leaks (partial absorption/transmission) with applications to room\nacoustics and optical microcavities in mind. Simulations in the lima .con\nfamily of billiards illustrate the main text. Regarding billiard dynamics, we\nemphasize that a correct discrete time representation can only be given in\nterms of the so- called true-time maps, while traditional Poincar \\'e maps lead\nto erroneous results.

The effect of gate-tunable charge\ndensity in the additional layer is two-fold: it provides screening of the\nlong-range potential of charged defects in the system, and screens out Coulomb\ninteractions between charge carriers. We find that the efficiency of defect\ncharge screening is strongly dependent on the concentration and location of\ndefects within the DLG. In particular, only a moderate suppression of\nelectron-hole puddles around the Dirac point induced by the high concentration\nof remote impurities in the silicon oxide substrate could be achieved. A\nstronger effect is found on the elastic relaxation rate due to charged defects\nresulting in mobility strongly dependent on the electron denisty in the\nadditional layer of DLG. We find that the quantum interference correction to\nthe resistivity of graphene is also strongly affected by screening in DLG. In\nparticular, the dephasing rate is strongly suppressed by the additional\nscreening that supresses the amplitude of electron-electron interaction and\nreduces the diffusion time that electrons spend in proximity of each other. The\nlatter effect combined with screening of elastic relaxation rates results in a\npeculiar gate tunable weak-localization magnetoresistance and quantum\ncorrection to resistivity.

The\nchange is much more pronounced in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle than in\nthe annual mean ice area. The shape of the seasonal cycle is surprisingly\nconstant for the whole observational record despite the general decline.

Thus the dramatic climate change in\narctic ice area is seen in the amplitude of the cycle and to a lesser extend\nthe annual mean and the summer ice extend.

We investigate the site version of this process on the triangular\nlattice where clusters freeze as soon as they reach L infinity diameter at\nleast N for some parameter N. We show that, informally speaking, in the limit N\ngoes to infinity, the clusters only freeze in the critical window of site\npercolation on the triangular lattice.

A similar study\nhas been reported for the self part, and we study the self and distinct parts\nseparately because their damping processes are not simply related. We begin\nwith the perfect vibrational system, which provides precise definitions of the\nliquid correlations, and provides the vibrational approximation Fdvib(q,t) at\nall q and t. Two independent liquid correlations are defined, motional and\nstructural, and these are decorrelated sequentially, with a crossover time\ntc(q). This is done by two independent decorrelation processes: the first,\nvibrational dephasing, is naturally present in Fdvib(q,t) and operates to damp\nthe motional correlation; the second, transit-induced decorrelation, is invoked\nto enhance the damping of motional correlation, and then to damp the structural\ncorrelation. A microscopic model is made for the \"transit drift\", the averaged\ntransit motion that damps motional correlation on 0 < t < tc(q). Following the\npreviously developed self-decorrelation theory, a microscopic model is also\nmade for the \"transit random walk,\" which damps the structural correlation on t\n> tc(q).

This effect is due to the\ncoupling of orbital angular momentum to the magnetic flux. Here, we perform\ncalculations of the energy level structure, and consequently the conductance,\nfor more general cases ranging from a flat potential to strong surface band\nbending. The transverse states are not confined to a shell, but are distributed\nacross the nanowire.

In\nprinciple, this allows for precise identification of the occupied subbands from\nthe magnetoconductance patterns of quasi-ballistic devices.

While the dissipation for the B phase tends to zero as T goes to 0,\nQ^{-1} exhibits a peak value greater than that at T_c at intermediate\ntemperatures. Values for Q^{-1} in the ESP phase are consistently higher than\nin the B phase and are proportional to \\rho_s/\\rho until the ESP to B phase\ntransition is attained.

The general framework for the\nthermodynamical and mechanical processes is based on conservation laws while\nthe vorticity self-organization needs a variational approach. It is difficult\nto estimate to what extent the vorticity self-organization (a purely kinematic\nprocess) have influenced the characteristics of the tropical cyclone at\nstationarity. If this influence is substantial it is expected that the\nstationary state of the tropical cyclone has the same nature as the vortices of\nmany other systems in nature: ideal (Euler) fluids, superconductors, Bose -\nEinstein condensate, cosmic strings, etc.\n  In previous works we have formulated a description of the $2D$ vorticity\nself-organization in terms of a classical field theory.

We analyze global land\ncover data and extract cities as defined by maximally connected urban clusters.\nThe analysis of the city size distribution for all cities on the globe confirms\nZipf's law. Moreover, by investigating the percolation properties of the\nclustering of urban areas we assess the closeness to criticality for various\ncountries. At the critical thresholds, the urban land cover of the countries\nundergoes a transition from separated clusters to a gigantic component on the\ncountry scale.

In\nsuch periodically driven setups, by varying the drive sequence the effective\n(Floquet) Hamiltonian can be engineered to be topological: then, the principle\nof bulk--boundary correspondence guarantees the existence of robust edge\nstates.

The\nlikelihood of such binary events -- the cornerstone also for the categoric (as\nopposed to probabilistic) prediction of threshold exceedences -- is established\nfrom long time series of one or more observables of the same system. The\nprediction skill is measured by a summary index of the ROC curve that relates\nthe hit- and false alarm rates. Our results for the examined systems suggest\nthat exceedances of higher thresholds are more predictable; or in other words:\nrare large magnitude, i.e., extreme, events are more predictable than frequent\ntypical events. We find this to hold provided that the bin size for binning\ntime series data is optimized, but not necessarily otherwise. This can be\nviewed as a confirmation of a counterintuitive (and seemingly contrafactual)\nstatement that was previously formulated for more simple autoregressive\nstochastic processes. However, we argue that for dynamical systems in general\nit may be typical only, but not universally true. We argue that when there is a\nsufficient amount of data depending on the precision of observation, the skill\nof a class of data-driven categoric predictions of threshold exceedences\napproximates the skill of the analogous model-driven prediction, assuming\nstrictly no model errors. Furthermore, we show that a quantity commonly\nregarded as a measure of predictability, the finite-time maximal Lyapunov\nexponent, does not correspond directly to the ROC-based measure of prediction\nskill when they are viewed as functions of the prediction lead time and the\nthreshold level. This points to the fact that even if the Lyapunov exponent as\nan intrinsic property of the system, measuring the instability of trajectories,\ndetermines predictability, it does that in a nontrivial manner. \n\n"}

To represent the bulk phases of these systems, we use the generalized\nBernevig-Hughes-Zhang model that incorporates the Hubbard-like onsite Coulomb\nenergy U in addition to the spin-orbit coupling term that causes band\ninversion. The topological and Mott insulating phases are realized by\nappropriately choosing smaller and larger values of U, respectively.

This question is motivated by\nearlier work of A. M. Essin and one of us (M.

This approach does not produce a physical model for each\nsymmetry class, and indeed there are reasons to believe that some symmetry\nclasses may not be realizable in strictly two-dimensional systems, thus raising\nthe question of which classes are in fact possible. While our understanding is\nlimited to a restricted class of models, it is complete in the sense that for\neach of the 2080 possible symmetry classes, we either prove rigorously that the\nclass cannot be realized in our family of models, or we give an explicit model\nrealizing the class.

The\nunperturbed model displays an exact correspondence: both the edge and\nentanglement spectra within each topological sector a (a = 1,...,4) are flat\nand equally degenerate.

It is well-known that dynamics of\natmospheric CO2 is governed by multiple time-constants, and here we approximate\nthe solutions to a linear model of atmospheric CO2 dynamics with four\ntime-constants to identify factors governing the time-delay between peaks in\nCO2 emissions and concentrations, and therefore the timing of the concentration\npeak. The main factor affecting this time-delay is the ratio of the rate of\nchange of emissions during its increasing and decreasing phases. If this ratio\nis large in magnitude then the time-delay between peak emissions and\nconcentrations is large. Therefore it is important to limit the magnitude of\nthis ratio through mitigation, in order to achieve an early peak in CO2\nconcentrations. This can be achieved with an early global emissions peak,\ncombined with rapid decarbonization of economic activity, because the delay\nbetween peak emissions and concentrations is affected by the time-scale with\nwhich decarbonization occurs. Of course, for limiting the magnitude of peak\nconcentrations it is also important to limit the magnitude of emissions\nthroughout its trajectory, but that aspect has been studied elsewhere and is\nnot examined here. The carbon cycle parameters affecting the timing of the\nconcentration peak are primarily the long multi-century time-constant of\natmospheric CO2, and the ratio of contributions to the impulse response\nfunction of atmospheric CO2 from the infinite time-constant and the long\ntime-constant respectively. Reducing uncertainties in these parameters can\nreduce uncertainty in forecasts of the radiative forcing peak. \n\n"}

Adding\nirreversible perturbations to the drift of a Langevin diffusion that maintain\nthe same invariant measure accelerates its convergence to stationarity. Many\nexisting works thus advocate the use of such non-reversible dynamics for\nsampling. When implementing Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms (MCMC) using\ntime discretisations of such Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), one can\nappend the discretization with the usual Metropolis-Hastings accept-reject step\nand this is often done in practice because the accept--reject step eliminates\nbias. On the other hand, such a step makes the resulting chain reversible. It\nis not known whether adding the accept-reject step preserves the faster mixing\nproperties of the non-reversible dynamics. In this paper, we address this gap\nbetween theory and practice by analyzing the optimal scaling of MCMC algorithms\nconstructed from proposal moves that are time-step Euler discretisations of an\nirreversible SDE, for high dimensional Gaussian target measures.

The QG\nmodel reproduces well the evolution of the composite potential vorticity (PV)\nfield obtained from JRA-55 by considering a time-dependent effective topography\ngiven by the composite height field of the 550 K potential temperature surface.\nThe zonal-wavenumber-2 component of the effective topography is the most\nessential feature required to observe the vortex splitting. The\nstatistical-mechanics theory predicts a large-scale steady state as the most\nprobable outcome of turbulent stirring, and such a state can be computed\nwithout solving the QG dynamics. The theory is applied to a disk domain, which\nis modeled on the north polar cap in the stratosphere. The equilibrium state is\nobtained by computing the maximum of an entropy functional. In the range of\nparameters relevant to the winter stratosphere, this state is anticyclonic.

In this\npaper, we generalize the concept of butterfly velocity beyond the thermal case\nto a large class of other subspaces. Based on holographic duality, we consider\nthe code subspace of low energy excitations on a classical background geometry.\nUsing local reconstruction of bulk operators, we prove a general relation\nbetween the boundary butterfly velocities (of different operators) and the bulk\ncausal structure. Our result has implications in both directions of the\nbulk-boundary correspondence. Starting from a boundary theory with a given\nLieb-Robinson velocity, our result determines an upper bound of the bulk light\ncone starting from a given point. Starting from a bulk space-time geometry, the\nbutterfly velocity can be explicitly calculated for all operators that are the\nlocal reconstructions of bulk local operators.

These measures reflect dependence in static probability\ndistributions, generated by systems' evolution, rather than coherence of\nsystems' dynamics. Moreover, these \"static\" measures of dependence can be\nbiased due to properties of dynamics underlying the analyzed time series.\nConsequently, properties of local dynamics can be misinterpreted as properties\nof connectivity or long-range interactions.

While low-order SCEs have\nbeen remarkably successful in describing the dynamics of non-equilibrium\nmany-body systems (e.g., the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation), its convergence\nproperties have not been elucidated before. To address this issue we apply this\ntechnique to the canonical partition function of the classical harmonic\noscillator with a quartic $gx^{4}$ anharmonicity, for which perturbation\ntheory's divergence is well-known. We obtain the $N$th order SCE for the\npartition function, which is rigorously found to converge exponentially fast in\n$N$, and uniformly in $g\\ge0$.

Yet, the conformal field theory (CFT) describing the\ncritical point remained elusive, and only fragments of a quantitative\nanalytical understanding existed up to now. In the present paper we carry out a\ndetailed analysis of the current-current correlation function for the\nconductivity tensor, initially in the Chalker-Coddington network model for the\nIQHE plateau transition and then in its exact reformulation as a supersymmetric\nvertex model. We develop a heuristic argument for the continuum limit of the\nnon-local conductivity response function at criticality and thus identify a\nnon-Abelian current algebra at level n = 4. Based on precise lattice\nexpressions for the CFT primary fields we predict the multifractal scaling\nexponents of critical wavefunctions to be q(1-q)/4.

We develop a mathematical model to describe these\nphenomena by exploiting the asymptotic limit in which the bending stiffness is\nsmall compared to stresses in the sheet. The results of this analysis show\nthat, at a time $t$ after impact, the transverse wave is located at a radial\ndistance $r\\sim t^{1/2}$ from the impactor, in contrast to the classic $r\\sim\nt^{2/3}$ scaling observed for capillary--inertia ripples produced by dropping a\nstone into a pond.

The high resolution of our data allows us to quantify the energy\nscales of three coupling mechanisms between phonons, CEF-split localized 4f\nelectron states, and conduction electrons. Although these interactions do not\nappear to be atypically strong for this class of materials, we resolve, for the\nfirst time, a profound renormalization of low-energy quasiparticle excitations\non all levels.

DNA selectivity provides direct control over\ncolloid-colloid interactions allowing the engineering of structures such as\ncomplex crystals or gels. However, self-assembly of localized and finite\nstructures remains an open problem with many potential applications. In this\nwork, we present a system in which functionalized surfaces initiate a cascade\nreaction between linkers leading to self-assembly of crystals with a\ncontrollable number of layers. Specifically, we consider colloidal particles\nfunctionalized by two families of complementary DNA linkers with mobile\nanchoring points, as found in experiments using emulsions or lipid bilayers. In\nbulk, intra-particle linkages formed by pairs of complementary linkers prevent\nthe formation of inter-particle bridges and therefore colloid-colloid\naggregation. However, colloids interact strongly with the surface given that\nthe latter can destabilize intra-particle linkages. When in direct contact with\nthe surface, colloids are activated, meaning that they feature more unpaired\nDNA linkers ready to react. Activated colloids can then capture and activate\nother colloids from the bulk through the formation of inter-particle linkages.\nUsing simulations and theory, validated by existing experiments, we clarify the\nthermodynamics of the activation and binding process and explain how\nparticle-particle interactions, within the adsorbed phase, weaken as a function\nof the distance from the surface.

The reported empirical results show that\nthis extension is pertinent for financial modelling. The second part of the\npaper applies this theory to portfolio optimisation. Our multi-scale\ndescription allows us to characterize the portfolio return distribution at all\ntime scales simultaneously. The portfolio composition is predicted to change\nwith the investment time horizon (i.e., the time scale) in a way that can be\nfully determined once an adequate measure of risk is chosen.

The nodes represent crosslinkers, and the\nsprings correspond to polymer chains. The boundaries are fixed at the bottom,\nfree at the top, and periodic in the lateral direction.

The model is\nnumerically relaxed to a representative local energy minimum, resulting in an\ninhomogeneous, ``clumpy'' bulk structure.

This seems, however, to be in contradiction with the\nfundamental role played by covariance matrices in finance, which constitute the\npillars of modern investment theory and have also gained industry-wide\napplications in risk management. Our paper is an attempt to resolve this\nembarrassing paradox. The key observation is that the effect of noise strongly\ndepends on the ratio r = n/T, where n is the size of the portfolio and T the\nlength of the available time series. On the basis of numerical experiments and\nanalytic results for some toy portfolio models we show that for relatively\nlarge values of r (e.g. 0.6) noise does, indeed, have the pronounced effect\nsuggested by [1,2,3] and illustrated later by [4,5] in a portfolio optimization\ncontext, while for smaller r (around 0.2 or below), the error due to noise\ndrops to acceptable levels. Since the length of available time series is for\nobvious reasons limited in any practical application, any bound imposed on the\nnoise-induced error translates into a bound on the size of the portfolio. In a\nrelated set of experiments we find that the effect of noise depends also on\nwhether the problem arises in asset allocation or in a risk measurement\ncontext: if covariance matrices are used simply for measuring the risk of\nportfolios with a fixed composition rather than as inputs to optimization, the\neffect of noise on the measured risk may become very small. \n\n"}

This provides a unifying approach that allows first a\nstraightforward description of the early approaches of Bachelier. We generalise\nthe approach to stochastic equations that model interacting agents. Using a\nsimple change of variable, we show that the peer pressure model of Marsilli and\nthe wealth dynamics model of Solomon are closely related. The methods are\nfurther shown to be consistent with a global free energy functional that\ninvokes an entropy term based on the Boltzmann formula. A more recent approach\nby Michael and Johnson maximised a Tsallis entropy function subject to simple\nconstraints. We show how this approach can be developed from an agent model\nwhere the simple Langevin process is now conditioned by local rather than\nglobal noise. The approach yields a BBGKY type hierarchy of equations for the\nsystem correlation functions. Of especial interest is that the results can be\nobtained from a new free energy functional similar to that mentioned above\nexcept that a Tsallis like entropy term replaces the Boltzmann entropy term.

The main points of their\ntheory are that volume fluctuations, which have a power law tail with exponent\nroughly -1.5, are modulated by the average market impact function, which\ndescribes the response of prices to transactions. They argue that the average\nmarket impact function follows a square root law, which gives power law tails\nfor prices with exponent roughly -3. We demonstrate that the long-memory nature\nof order flow invalidates their statistical analysis of market impact, and\npresent a more careful analysis that properly takes this into account. This\nmakes it clear that the functional form of the average market impact function\nvaries from market to market, and in some cases from stock to stock. In fact,\nfor both the London Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange the average\nmarket impact function grows much slower than a square root law; this implies\nthat the exponent for price fluctuations predicted by modulations of volume\nfluctuations is much too big. We find that for LSE stocks the distribution of\ntransaction volumes does not even have a power law tail.

The growth of a pseudomorphic film\nwith tetragonally strained face centered symmetry (fct) has been observed by\nout-of-plane x-ray diffraction up to a maximum thickness of 10 Ni layers (two\nof them intermixed with the substrate), where a new fcc bulk-like phase is\nformed.

The\nphase diagram of the steady flow is described by three parameters: an effective\nMach number, a scaled energy loss parameter, and an integer number m: the\nnumber of half-oscillations in a mechanical analogy that appears in this\nproblem. In a steady shear flow the viscous heating is balanced by energy\ndissipation via inelastic collisions.

We model these markets as a set of buyers and a set of\nsellers diffusing in price space and interacting through an annihilation\ninteraction. We seek to compute the purely statistical effects of the presence\nof large numbers of traders, as scaling laws on various measures of liquidity,\nand to this end we allow our model very few parameters. We find that the\nbid-offer spread scales as $\\sqrt{1/{\\rm Deal Rate}}$.In addition we\ninvestigate the scaling of other intuitive relationships, such as the relation\nbetween fluctuations of the best bid/offer and the density of buyers/sellers.\nWe then study this model and its scaling laws under the influence of random\ndisturbances to trader drift, trader volatility, and entrance rate. We also\nstudy possible extensions to the model, such as the addition of market order\ntraders, and an interaction that models momentum-type trading.

However, given the lack of information about network evolution over\nlong periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about\ntrends over time.\n  Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising\nphenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of\nedges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average\ndistance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional\nwisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of\nthe number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).\n  Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even\nat a qualitative level.

This implies\nthe existence of different functional classes of vertices. Furthermore we find\nthat the second order vertex correlations are an essential component of the\nnetwork architecture. To model our empirical results we extend a previously\nintroduced model for language due to Dorogovtsev and Mendes. We propose an\naccelerated growing network model that contains three growth mechanisms: linear\npreferential attachment, local preferential attachment and the random growth of\na pre-determined small finite subset of initial vertices. We find that with\nthese elementary stochastic rules we are able to produce a network showing\nsyntactic-like structures. \n\n"}

Part II: trend\n  detection and assessment Abstract: A baroclinic model for the atmospheric jet at middle-latitudes is used as\nstochastic generator of non-stationary time series of the total energy of the\nsystem. A linear time trend is imposed on the parameter $T_E$, descriptive of\nthe forced equator-to-pole temperature gradient and responsible for setting the\naverage baroclinicity in the model. The focus lies on establishing a\ntheoretically sound framework for the detection and assessment of trend at\nextreme values of the generated time series. This problem is dealt with by\nfitting time-dependent Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models to sequences of\nyearly maxima of the total energy. A family of GEV models is used in which the\nlocation $\\mu$ and scale parameters $\\sigma$ depend quadratically and linearly\non time, respectively, while the shape parameter $\\xi$ is kept constant. From\nthis family, a model is selected by using diagnostic graphical tools, such as\nprobability and quantile plots, and by means of the likelihood ratio test. The\ninferred location and scale parameters are found to depend in a rather smooth\nway on time and, therefore, on $T_E$. In particular, power-law dependences of\n$\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ on $T_E$ are obtained, in analogy with the results of a\nprevious work where the same baroclinic model was run with fixed values of\n$T_E$ spanning the same range as in this case. It is emphasized under which\nconditions the adopted approach is valid. \n\n"}

We also investigate storm\nintensity by measuring the distribution of individual storm lifetime in days,\nstorm track length, and Emanuel's power dissiptation index. We find little\nevidence that the distribution of individual storm intensity is changing\nthrough time.

{"id": "physics/0702067", "contents": "Title: Explicit wave-averaged primitive equations using a Generalized\n  Lagrangian Mean Abstract: The generalized Langrangian mean theory provides exact equations for general\nwave-turbulence-mean flow interactions in three dimensions. For practical\napplications, these equations must be closed by specifying the wave forcing\nterms. Here an approximate closure is obtained under the hypotheses of small\nsurface slope, weak horizontal gradients of the water depth and mean current,\nand weak curvature of the mean current profile. These assumptions yield\nanalytical expressions for the mean momentum and pressure forcing terms that\ncan be expressed in terms of the wave spectrum. A vertical change of coordinate\nis then applied to obtain glm2z-RANS equations (55) and (57) with non-divergent\nmass transport in cartesian coordinates. To lowest order, agreement is found\nwith Eulerian-mean theories, and the present approximation provides an explicit\nextension of known wave-averaged equations to short-scale variations of the\nwave field, and vertically varying currents only limited to weak or localized\nprofile curvatures. Further, the underlying exact equations provide a natural\nframework for extensions to finite wave amplitudes and any realistic situation.\nThe accuracy of the approximations is discussed using comparisons with exact\nnumerical solutions for linear waves over arbitrary bottom slopes, for which\nthe equations are still exact when properly accounting for partial standing\nwaves. For finite amplitude waves it is found that the approximate solutions\nare probably accurate for ocean mixed layer modelling and shoaling waves,\nprovided that an adequate turbulent closure is designed. However, for surf zone\napplications the approximations are expected to give only qualitative results\ndue to the large influence of wave nonlinearity on the vertical profiles of\nwave forcing terms. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/0702148", "contents": "Title: Reliability of rank order in sampled networks Abstract: In complex scale-free networks, ranking the individual nodes based upon their\nimportance has useful applications, such as the identification of hubs for\nepidemic control, or bottlenecks for controlling traffic congestion. However,\nin most real situations, only limited sub-structures of entire networks are\navailable, and therefore the reliability of the order relationships in sampled\nnetworks requires investigation. With a set of randomly sampled nodes from the\nunderlying original networks, we rank individual nodes by three centrality\nmeasures: degree, betweenness, and closeness. The higher-ranking nodes from the\nsampled networks provide a relatively better characterisation of their ranks in\nthe original networks than the lower-ranking nodes. A closeness-based order\nrelationship is more reliable than any other quantity, due to the global nature\nof the closeness measure. In addition, we show that if access to hubs is\nlimited during the sampling process, an increase in the sampling fraction can\nin fact decrease the sampling accuracy. Finally, an estimation method for\nassessing sampling accuracy is suggested. \n\n"}

When analyzing global\nepidemics this force us to consider metapopulation models taking into account\nintra- and inter-community interactions. Recently Watts et al introduced a\nmetapopulation model which accounts for several features observed in real\noutbreaks [Watts et al, PNAS 102, 11157 (2005)]. In this work I provide an\nanalytical solution to this model, enhancing our understanding of the model and\nthe epidemic outbreaks it represents. First, I demonstrate that depending on\nthe intra-community expected outbreak size and the fraction of social bridges\nthe epidemic outbreaks die out or there is a finite probability to observe a\nglobal epidemics. Second, I show that the global scenario is characterized by\nresurgent epidemics, their number increasing with increasing the\nintra-community average distance between individuals.

{"id": "q-bio/0610057", "contents": "Title: Second look at the spread of epidemics on networks Abstract: In an important paper, M.E.J. Newman claimed that a general network-based\nstochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) epidemic model is isomorphic to\na bond percolation model, where the bonds are the edges of the contact network\nand the bond occupation probability is equal to the marginal probability of\ntransmission from an infected node to a susceptible neighbor. In this paper, we\nshow that this isomorphism is incorrect and define a semi-directed random\nnetwork we call the epidemic percolation network that is exactly isomorphic to\nthe SIR epidemic model in any finite population. In the limit of a large\npopulation, (i) the distribution of (self-limited) outbreak sizes is identical\nto the size distribution of (small) out-components, (ii) the epidemic threshold\ncorresponds to the phase transition where a giant strongly-connected component\nappears, (iii) the probability of a large epidemic is equal to the probability\nthat an initial infection occurs in the giant in-component, and (iv) the\nrelative final size of an epidemic is equal to the proportion of the network\ncontained in the giant out-component. For the SIR model considered by Newman,\nwe show that the epidemic percolation network predicts the same mean outbreak\nsize below the epidemic threshold, the same epidemic threshold, and the same\nfinal size of an epidemic as the bond percolation model. However, the bond\npercolation model fails to predict the correct outbreak size distribution and\nprobability of an epidemic when there is a nondegenerate infectious period\ndistribution. We confirm our findings by comparing predictions from percolation\nnetworks and bond percolation models to the results of simulations. In an\nappendix, we show that an isomorphism to an epidemic percolation network can be\ndefined for any time-homogeneous stochastic SIR model. \n\n"}
