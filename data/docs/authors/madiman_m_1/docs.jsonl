The decoding algorithm, called\ninterior point decoding, is designed for linear vector channels. The linear\nvector channels include many practically important channels such as inter\nsymbol interference channels and partial response channels. It is shown that\nthe maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) rule for a linear vector channel can be\nrelaxed to a convex optimization problem, which is called a relaxed MLD\nproblem. The proposed decoding algorithm is based on a numerical optimization\ntechnique so called interior point method with barrier function. Approximate\nvariations of the gradient descent and the Newton methods are used to solve the\nconvex optimization problem. In a decoding process of the proposed algorithm, a\nsearch point always lies in the fundamental polytope defined based on a\nlow-density parity-check matrix. Compared with a convectional joint message\npassing decoder, the proposed decoding algorithm achieves better BER\nperformance with less complexity in the case of partial response channels in\nmany cases. \n\n"}

The infrastructure uses multi-antenna base stations (BSs), in which the\nnumber of BSs and the number of antennas at each BS can scale at arbitrary\nrates relative to $n$. Under the model, capacity scaling laws are analyzed for\nboth dense and extended networks. Two BS-based routing schemes are first\nintroduced in this study: an infrastructure-supported single-hop (ISH) routing\nprotocol with multiple-access uplink and broadcast downlink and an\ninfrastructure-supported multi-hop (IMH) routing protocol. Then, their\nachievable throughput scalings are analyzed. These schemes are compared against\ntwo conventional schemes without BSs: the multi-hop (MH) transmission and\nhierarchical cooperation (HC) schemes. It is shown that a linear throughput\nscaling is achieved in dense networks, as in the case without help of BSs. In\ncontrast, the proposed BS-based routing schemes can, under realistic network\nconditions, improve the throughput scaling significantly in extended networks.\nThe gain comes from the following advantages of these BS-based protocols.\nFirst, more nodes can transmit simultaneously in the proposed scheme than in\nthe MH scheme if the number of BSs and the number of antennas are large enough.\nSecond, by improving the long-distance signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\nreceived signal power can be larger than that of the HC, enabling a better\nthroughput scaling under extended networks. Furthermore, by deriving the\ncorresponding information-theoretic cut-set upper bounds, it is shown under\nextended networks that a combination of four schemes IMH, ISH, MH, and HC is\norder-optimal in all operating regimes. \n\n"}

As a result, nodes have to make\ndistributed decisions about their transmission and reception parameters based\non their local view of the network. In this paper, we characterize the impact\nof distributed decisions on the global network performance in terms of\nachievable sum-rates. We first formalize the concept of local view by proposing\na protocol abstraction using the concept of local message passing. In the\nproposed protocol, nodes forward information about the network state to other\nneighboring nodes, thereby allowing network state information to trickle to all\nthe nodes. The protocol proceeds in rounds, where all transmitters send a\nmessage followed by a message by all receivers. The number of rounds then\nprovides a natural metric to quantify the extent of local information at each\nnode.\n  We next study three network connectivities, Z-channel, a three-user double\nZ-channel and a reduced-parametrization $K$-user stacked Z-channel. In each\ncase, we characterize achievable sum-rate with partial message passing leading\nto three main results. First, in many cases, nodes can make distributed\ndecisions with only local information about the network and can still achieve\nthe same sum-capacity as can be attained with global information irrespective\nof the actual channel gains. Second, for the case of three-user double\nZ-channel, we show that universal optimality is not achievable if the per node\ninformation is below a threshold.

The MMSE\ncan be regarded as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as a\nfunctional of the input distribution (of the random variable to be estimated).\nIt is shown that the MMSE is concave in the input distribution at any given\nSNR. For a given input distribution, the MMSE is found to be infinitely\ndifferentiable at all positive SNR, and in fact a real analytic function in SNR\nunder mild conditions. The key to these regularity results is that the\nposterior distribution conditioned on the observation through Gaussian channels\nalways decays at least as quickly as some Gaussian density.

We show that this discrete\nsuperposition network provides a near-optimal digital interface for operating a\nclass consisting of many Gaussian networks in the sense that any code for the\ndiscrete superposition network can be naturally lifted to a corresponding code\nfor the Gaussian network, while achieving a rate that is no more than a\nconstant number of bits lesser than the rate it achieves for the discrete\nsuperposition network. This constant depends only on the number of nodes in the\nnetwork and not on the channel gains or SNR. Moreover the capacities of the two\nnetworks are within a constant of each other, again independent of channel\ngains and SNR. We show that the class of Gaussian networks for which this\ninterface property holds includes relay networks with a single\nsource-destination pair, interference networks, multicast networks, and the\ncounterparts of these networks with multiple transmit and receive antennas.\n  The code for the Gaussian relay network can be obtained from any code for the\ndiscrete superposition network simply by pruning it. This lifting scheme\nestablishes that the superposition model can indeed potentially serve as a\nstrong surrogate for designing codes for Gaussian relay networks.\n  We present similar results for the K x K Gaussian interference network, MIMO\nGaussian interference networks, MIMO Gaussian relay networks, and multicast\nnetworks, with the constant gap depending additionally on the number of\nantennas in case of MIMO networks. \n\n"}

The channel is modeled with\nreal/complex additive noise of arbitrary distribution. Two problems are\naddressed. The first problem concerns whether overloaded error free codes exist\nin the absence of additive noise under these general settings, and if so\nwhether there are any practical optimum decoding algorithms. The second one is\nabout the bounds for the sum channel capacity when user data and signature\ncodes employ any real or complex alphabets (finite or infinite). In response to\nthe first problem, we have developed practical Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding\nalgorithms for overloaded CDMA systems for a large class of alphabets. In\nresponse to the second problem, a general theorem has been developed in which\nthe sum capacity lower bounds with respect to the number of users and spreading\ngain and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) can be derived as special cases for a\ngiven CDMA system. To show the power and utility of the main theorem, a number\nof sum capacity bounds for special cases are simulated.

Mahdavifar and Vardy have recently exploited this phenomenon to construct\ncodes that achieve the symmetric private capacity for private data transmission\nover a degraded wiretap channel. In the current paper, we build on their work\nand demonstrate how to construct quantum wiretap polar codes that achieve the\nsymmetric private capacity of a degraded quantum wiretap channel with a\nclassical eavesdropper. Due to the Schumacher-Westmoreland correspondence\nbetween quantum privacy and quantum coherence, we can construct quantum polar\ncodes by operating these quantum wiretap polar codes in superposition, much\nlike Devetak's technique for demonstrating the achievability of the coherent\ninformation rate for quantum data transmission.

The achievable rates of successive decoding (SD) receivers based on\nthe linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) channel estimation are analyzed\nin the large-system limit, by using the replica method under the assumption of\nreplica symmetry. It is shown that negligible pilot information is best in\nterms of the achievable rates of the SD receivers in the large-system limit.\nThe obtained analytical formulas of the achievable rates can improve the\nexisting lower bound on the capacity of the MIMO channel with no channel state\ninformation (CSI), derived by Hassibi and Hochwald, for all signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs). The comparison between the obtained bound and a high SNR\napproximation of the channel capacity, derived by Zheng and Tse, implies that\nthe high SNR approximation is unreliable unless quite high SNR is considered.\nEnergy efficiency in the low SNR regime is also investigated in terms of the\npower per information bit required for reliable communication.

We\nuse this second property to impose pair-wise marginal constraints over pairs of\nvariables connected to a check node of the LDPC code's Tanner graph.

In particular, scavenging energy from\nambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently\ndrawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point\nwireless link over the narrowband flat-fading channel subject to time-varying\nco-channel interference. It is assumed that the receiver has no fixed power\nsupplies and thus needs to replenish energy opportunistically via WEH from the\nunintended interference and/or the intended signal sent by the transmitter. We\nfurther assume a single-antenna receiver that can only decode information or\nharvest energy at any time due to the practical circuit limitation. Therefore,\nit is important to investigate when the receiver should switch between the two\nmodes of information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), based on the\ninstantaneous channel and interference condition. In this paper, we derive the\noptimal mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs\nbetween wireless information transfer and energy harvesting. Specifically, we\ndetermine the minimum transmission outage probability for delay-limited\ninformation transfer and the maximum ergodic capacity for no-delay-limited\ninformation transfer versus the maximum average energy harvested at the\nreceiver, which are characterized by the boundary of so-called \"outage-energy\"\nregion and \"rate-energy\" region, respectively. Moreover, for the case when the\nchannel state information (CSI) is known at the transmitter, we investigate the\njoint optimization of transmit power control, information and energy transfer\nscheduling, and the receiver's mode switching. Our results provide useful\nguidelines for the efficient design of emerging wireless communication systems\npowered by opportunistic WEH. \n\n"}

The resulting model\nis an intersection of a random key graph and an Erdos-Renyi graph, and is\nexpected to be useful in capturing various real-world networks; e.g., with\nsecure WSN applications in mind, link unreliability can be attributed to harsh\nenvironmental conditions severely impairing transmissions.

Coordinated resource allocation is the\nkey to efficient performance, but the demand on backhaul signaling and\ncomputational resources grows rapidly with number of cells, terminals, and\nsubcarriers. To handle this, we propose a novel multicell framework with\ndynamic cooperation clusters where each terminal is jointly served by a small\nset of base stations. Each base station coordinates interference to neighboring\nterminals only, thus limiting backhaul signalling and making the framework\nscalable. This framework can describe anything from interference channels to\nideal joint multicell transmission.\n  The resource allocation (i.e., precoding and scheduling) is formulated as an\noptimization problem (P1) with performance described by arbitrary monotonic\nfunctions of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios (SINRs) and arbitrary\nlinear power constraints. Although (P1) is non-convex and difficult to solve\noptimally, we are able to prove: 1) Optimality of single-stream beamforming; 2)\nConditions for full power usage; and 3) A precoding parametrization based on a\nfew parameters between zero and one.

In this paper we study the emerging paradigm of sampling and\nreconstructing spatial fields using sensors that move through space. We show\nthat mobile sensing offers some unique advantages over static sensing in\nsensing time-invariant bandlimited spatial fields. Since a moving sensor\nencounters such a spatial field along its path as a time-domain signal, a\ntime-domain anti-aliasing filter can be employed prior to sampling the signal\nreceived at the sensor. Such a filtering procedure, when used by a\nconfiguration of sensors moving at constant speeds along equispaced parallel\nlines, leads to a complete suppression of spatial aliasing in the direction of\nmotion of the sensors. We analytically quantify the advantage of using such a\nsampling scheme over a static sampling scheme by computing the reduction in\nsampling noise due to the filter.

A\ncertainty-equivalence type distributed estimator of the consensus + innovations\nform is proposed in which, at each each observation sampling epoch agents\nupdate their local parameter estimates by appropriately combining the data\nreceived from their neighbors and the locally sensed new information\n(innovation). Under global observability of the networked sensing model, i.e.,\nthe ability to distinguish between different instances of the parameter value\nbased on the joint observation statistics, and mean connectivity of the\ninter-agent communication network, the proposed estimator is shown to yield\nconsistent parameter estimates at each network agent. Further, it is shown that\nthe distributed estimator is asymptotically efficient, in that, the asymptotic\ncovariances of the agent estimates coincide with that of the optimal\ncentralized estimator, i.e., the inverse of the centralized Fisher information\nrate. From a technical viewpoint, the proposed distributed estimator leads to\nnon-Markovian mixed timescale stochastic recursions and the analytical methods\ndeveloped in the paper contribute to the general theory of distributed\nstochastic approximation. \n\n"}

We propose a computable outer\nbound valid for any memoryless channel. We first evaluate the sum-rate outer\nbound for the high- SNR linear deterministic approximation of the Gaussian\nnoise channel. This is shown to be capacity for the 3-user channel with\narbitrary channel gains and the sum-capacity for the symmetric K-user channel.\nInterestingly. for the K user channel having only the K th cognitive know all\nthe other messages is sufficient to achieve capacity i.e cognition at\ntransmitter 2 to K-1 is not needed. Next the sum capacity of the symmetric\nGaussian noise channel is characterized to within a constant additive and\nmultiplicative gap. The proposed achievable scheme for the additive gap is\nbased on Dirty paper coding and can be thought of as a MIMO-broadcast scheme\nwhere only one encoding order is possible due to the message sharing structure.\nAs opposed to other multiuser interference channel models, a single scheme\nsuffices for both the weak and strong interference regimes. With this scheme\nthe generalized degrees of freedom (gDOF) is shown to be a function of K, in\ncontrast to the non cognitive case and the broadcast channel case.\nInterestingly, it is show that as the number of users grows to infinity the\ngDoF of the K-user cognitive interference channel with cumulative message\nsharing tends to the gDoF of a broadcast channel with a K-antenna transmitter\nand K single-antenna receivers. The analytical additive additive and\nmultiplicative gaps are a function of the number of users.

Our goal is to\ndesign an artificial noise (AN)-aided transmit strategy, such that the\nachievable secrecy rate is maximized subject to the sum power constraint.\nAN-aided secure transmission has recently been found to be a promising approach\nfor blocking eavesdropping attempts. In many existing studies, the confidential\ninformation transmit covariance and the AN covariance are not simultaneously\noptimized. In particular, for design convenience, it is common to prefix the AN\ncovariance as a specific kind of spatially isotropic covariance. This paper\nconsiders joint optimization of the transmit and AN covariances for secrecy\nrate maximization (SRM), with a design flexibility that the AN can take any\nspatial pattern. Hence, the proposed design has potential in jamming the\neavesdroppers more effectively, based upon the channel state information (CSI).\nWe derive an optimization approach to the SRM problem through both analysis and\nconvex conic optimization machinery.

However, the\nsame representation and reconstruction framework is not readily applicable in a\nstreaming system: the unknown signal changes over time, and it is measured and\nreconstructed sequentially over small time intervals.\n  In this paper, we discuss two such streaming systems and a homotopy-based\nalgorithm for quickly solving the associated L1-norm minimization programs: 1)\nRecovery of a smooth, time-varying signal for which, instead of using block\ntransforms, we use lapped orthogonal transforms for sparse representation. 2)\nRecovery of a sparse, time-varying signal that follows a linear dynamic model.\nFor both the systems, we iteratively process measurements over a sliding\ninterval and estimate sparse coefficients by solving a weighted L1-norm\nminimization program. Instead of solving a new L1 program from scratch at every\niteration, we use an available signal estimate as a starting point in a\nhomotopy formulation.

By contrast, it has been\nargued in the science literature that such networks are highly vulnerable to a\ntargeted attack, and removing a small number of key nodes in the network will\ndramatically change the topological structure. Here we analyse a class of\npreferential attachment networks in the robust regime and prove four main\nresults supporting this claim: After removal of an arbitrarily small proportion\nepsilon>0 of the oldest nodes (1) the asymptotic degree distribution has\nexponential instead of power law tails; (2) the largest degree in the network\ndrops from being of the order of a power of the network size n to being just\nlogarithmic in n; (3) the typical distances in the network increase from order\nlog log n to order log n; and (4) the network becomes vulnerable to random\nremoval of nodes. Importantly, all our results explicitly quantify the\ndependence on the proportion epsilon of removed vertices. For example, we show\nthat the critical proportion of nodes that have to be retained for survival of\nthe giant component undergoes a steep increase as epsilon moves away from zero,\nand a comparison of this result with similar ones for other networks reveals\nthe existence of two different universality classes of robust network models.\nThe key technique in our proofs is a local approximation of the network by a\nbranching random walk with two killing boundaries, and an understanding of the\nparticle genealogies in this process, which enters into estimates for the\nspectral radius of an associated operator. \n\n"}

However, most of the works are focused on the simple,\nthree-node model with two-way relaying, not taking into account the fact that\nthere can be other neighboring nodes that can cause/receive interference. The\nway to deal with this problem in distributed wireless networks is usage of\nMAC-layer mechanisms that make a spatial reservation of the shared wireless\nmedium, similar to the well-known RTS/CTS in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. In\nthis paper, we investigate two-way relaying in presence of interfering nodes\nand usage of spatial reservation mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a\nreserved area in order to protect the nodes involved in two-way relaying from\nthe interference caused by neighboring nodes. We analytically derive the\nend-to-end rate achieved by PLNC considering the impact of interference and\nreserved area. A relevant performance measure is data rate per unit area, in\norder to reflect the fact that any spatial reservation blocks another data\nexchange in the reserved area. The numerical results carry a cautionary message\nthat the gains brought by PLNC over one-way relaying may be vanishing when the\ntwo-way relaying is considered in a broader context of a larger wireless\nnetwork. \n\n"}

Among different types of WET techniques, the radio\nfrequency (RF) signal enabled far-field WET is most practically appealing to\npower energy constrained wireless networks in a broadcast manner. To overcome\nthe significant path loss over wireless channels, multi-antenna or\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques have been proposed to enhance\nthe transmission efficiency and distance for RF-based WET. However, in order to\nreap the large energy beamforming gain in MIMO WET, acquiring the channel state\ninformation (CSI) at the energy transmitter (ET) is an essential task. This\ntask is particularly challenging for WET systems, since existing channel\ntraining and feedback methods used for communication receivers may not be\nimplementable at the energy receiver (ER) due to its hardware limitation. To\ntackle this problem, in this paper we consider a multiuser MIMO system for WET,\nwhere a multiple-antenna ET broadcasts wireless energy to a group of\nmultiple-antenna ERs concurrently via transmit energy beamforming. By taking\ninto account the practical energy harvesting circuits at the ER, we propose a\nnew channel learning method that requires only one feedback bit from each ER to\nthe ET per feedback interval. The feedback bit indicates the increase or\ndecrease of the harvested energy by each ER between the present and previous\nintervals, which can be measured without changing the existing hardware at the\nER. Based on such feedback information, the ET adjusts transmit beamforming in\ndifferent training intervals and at the same time obtains improved estimates of\nthe MIMO channels to ERs by applying a new approach termed analytic center\ncutting plane method (ACCPM). \n\n"}

Our\nframework can deal with phase asynchrony and symbol arrival-time asynchrony\nbetween the signals simultaneously transmitted by multiple sources. A salient\nfeature of this framework is that it can handle both fractional and integral\nsymbol offsets; previously proposed PNC decoding algorithms (e.g., XOR-CD and\nreduced-state Viterbi algorithms) can only deal with fractional symbol offset.\nMoreover, the Jt-CNC algorithm, based on belief propagation (BP), is\nBER-optimal for synchronous PNC and near optimal for asynchronous PNC.\nExtending beyond convolutional codes, we further generalize the Jt-CNC decoding\nalgorithm for all cyclic codes.

A key issue that arises for such inverse problems is\nthat of identifiability, i.e. whether the observation is sufficient to\nunambiguously determine the pair of inputs that generated the observation.\nIdentifiability is a key concern for applications like blind equalization in\nwireless communications and data mining in machine learning. Herein, a unifying\nand flexible approach to identifiability analysis for general conic prior\nconstrained BIPs is presented, exploiting a connection to low-rank matrix\nrecovery via lifting. We develop deterministic identifiability conditions on\nthe input signals and examine their satisfiability in practice for three\nclasses of signal distributions, viz. dependent but uncorrelated, independent\nGaussian, and independent Bernoulli. In each case, scaling laws are developed\nthat trade-off probability of robust identifiability with the complexity of the\nrank two null space. An added appeal of our approach is that the rank two null\nspace can be partly or fully characterized for many bilinear problems of\ninterest (e.g. blind deconvolution). We present numerical experiments involving\nvariations on the blind deconvolution problem that exploit a characterization\nof the rank two null space and demonstrate that the scaling laws offer good\nestimates of identifiability. \n\n"}

This chapter delivers a review of recent\nadvances in the field where the regularization prior promotes solutions\nconforming to some notion of simplicity/low-complexity. These priors encompass\nas popular examples sparsity and group sparsity (to capture the compressibility\nof natural signals and images), total variation and analysis sparsity (to\npromote piecewise regularity), and low-rank (as natural extension of sparsity\nto matrix-valued data).

A critical issue is how the PNC system performs when the\nreceived powers from the two users at the relay are imbalanced. In particular,\nhow would the PNC system perform under slight power imbalance that is\ninevitable in practice, even when power control is applied? To answer these\nquestions, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of q-PAM PNC. Our\ncontributions are as follows: 1) We give a systematic way to obtain the\nanalytical relationship between the minimum distance of the signal\nconstellation induced by the superimposed signals of the two users (a key\nperformance determining factor) and the channel-gain ratio of the two users,\nfor all q. In particular, we show how the minimum distance changes in a\npiecewise linear fashion as the channel-gain ratio varies. 2) We show that the\nperformance of q-PAM PNC is highly sensitive to imbalanced received powers from\nthe two users at the relay, even when the power imbalance is slight (e.g., the\nresidual power imbalance in a power-controlled system). This sensitivity\nproblem is exacerbated as q increases, calling into question the robustness of\nhigh-order modulated PNC. 3) We propose an asynchronized PNC system in which\nthe symbol arrival times of the two users at the relay are deliberately made to\nbe asynchronous. We show that such asynchronized PNC, when operated with a\nbelief propagation (BP) decoder, can remove the sensitivity problem, allowing a\nrobust high-order modulated PNC system to be built. \n\n"}

It is conjectured\nthat for a large class of models, the nature of this emergence is similar to\nthat of the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph, in the sense that (a) the sizes of\nthe maximal components in the critical regime scale like $n^{2/3}$, and (b) the\nstructure of the maximal components at criticality (rescaled by $n^{-1/3}$)\nconverges to random fractals.

We derive the necessary and sufficient condition for\nthe reversibility of LOCC conversions between two bipartite pure entangled\nstates in the asymptotic setting. In addition, we show that conversion can be\nachieved perfectly with only local unitary operation under such condition\nexcept for special cases. Interestingly, our result implies that an error-free\nreversible conversion is asymptotically possible even between states whose\ncopies can never be locally unitarily equivalent with any finite numbers of\ncopies, although such a conversion is impossible in the finite setting.

We focus on the\nBradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model that postulates a set of latent preference\nscores underlying all items, where the odds of paired comparisons depend only\non the relative scores of the items involved.\n  We characterize the minimax limits on identifiability of top-$K$ ranked\nitems, in the presence of random and non-adaptive sampling. Our results\nhighlight a separation measure that quantifies the gap of preference scores\nbetween the $K^{\\text{th}}$ and $(K+1)^{\\text{th}}$ ranked items. The minimum\nsample complexity required for reliable top-$K$ ranking scales inversely with\nthe separation measure irrespective of other preference distribution metrics.\nTo approach this minimax limit, we propose a nearly linear-time ranking scheme,\ncalled \\emph{Spectral MLE}, that returns the indices of the top-$K$ items in\naccordance to a careful score estimate. In a nutshell, Spectral MLE starts with\nan initial score estimate with minimal squared loss (obtained via a spectral\nmethod), and then successively refines each component with the assistance of\ncoordinate-wise MLEs. Encouragingly, Spectral MLE allows perfect top-$K$ item\nidentification under minimal sample complexity.

Rather than relying on the precise structure of\nthe codes, this method requires only that the codes are highly symmetric. In\nparticular, the technique applies to any sequence of linear codes where the\nblocklengths are strictly increasing, the code rates converge to a number\nbetween 0 and 1, and the permutation group of each code is doubly transitive.\nThis also provides a rare example in information theory where symmetry alone\nimplies near-optimal performance.\n  An important consequence of this result is that a sequence of Reed-Muller\ncodes with increasing blocklength achieves capacity if its code rate converges\nto a number between 0 and 1. This possibility has been suggested previously in\nthe literature but it has only been proven for cases where the limiting code\nrate is 0 or 1.

In this\nwork we quantify this tradeoff and study the exchange ratio between the\nfeedback rate (over the uplink) and the downlink rate. We study both finite and\ninfinite networks, and show that for high enough (but finite) SNR, the uplink\nrate can be exchanged for increased downlink rate with a favorable exchange\nratio.

Most existing formulations focus on estimating an\nunknown graph signal by observing its value on a subset of nodes. By contrast,\nin this paper, we study the problem of reconstructing a known graph signal\nusing as input a graph signal that is non-zero only for a small subset of nodes\n(seeding nodes). The sparse signal is then percolated (interpolated) across the\ngraph using a graph filter. Graph filters are a generalization of classical\ntime-invariant systems and represent linear transformations that can be\nimplemented distributedly across the nodes of the graph. Three setups are\ninvestigated. In the first one, a single simultaneous injection takes place on\nseveral nodes in the graph. In the second one, successive value injections take\nplace on a single node. The third one is a generalization where multiple nodes\ninject multiple signal values. For noiseless settings, conditions under which\nperfect reconstruction is feasible are given, and the corresponding schemes to\nrecover the desired signal are specified. Scenarios leading to imperfect\nreconstruction, either due to insufficient or noisy signal value injections,\nare also analyzed.

A distributed recursive estimator of the\n\\emph{consensus} + \\emph{innovations} type, namely $\\mathcal{CIWNLS}$, is\nproposed, in which the agents update their parameter estimates at each\nobservation sampling epoch in a collaborative way by simultaneously processing\nthe latest locally sensed information~(\\emph{innovations}) and the parameter\nestimates from other agents~(\\emph{consensus}) in the local neighborhood\nconforming to a pre-specified inter-agent communication topology. Under rather\nweak conditions on the connectivity of the inter-agent communication and a\n\\emph{global observability} criterion, it is shown that at every network agent,\nthe proposed algorithm leads to consistent parameter estimates.

The proposed approach is primal-dual based, where the\nprimal step minimizes certain approximation of the augmented Lagrangian of the\nproblem, and the dual step performs an approximate dual ascent. The\napproximation used in the primal step is able to decompose the variable blocks,\nmaking it possible to obtain simple subproblems by leveraging the problem\nstructures. Theoretically, we show that whenever the penalty parameter in the\naugmented Lagrangian is larger than a given threshold, the Prox-PDA converges\nto the set of stationary solutions, globally and in a sublinear manner (i.e.,\ncertain measure of stationarity decreases in the rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/r)$,\nwhere $r$ is the iteration counter).

To tackle this challenge, we\npropose a novel network architecture that integrates wireless power transfer\nand backscatter communication, called wirelessly powered backscatter\ncommunication (WP-BC) networks. In this architecture, power beacons (PBs) are\ndeployed for wirelessly powering devices; their ad-hoc communication relies on\nbackscattering and modulating incident continuous waves from PBs, which\nconsumes orders-of-magnitude less power than traditional radios.

Basically, the proposed\ncaching scheme consists of two phases, i.e, placement phase and delivery phase.\nIn the placement phase, each helper/user randomly and independently selects\ncontents from the server and stores them into its memory. In the delivery\nphase, the users request contents from the server, and the server satisfies\neach user through a helper. Different from the existing caching scheme, the\nproposed caching scheme takes into account the pre-stored contents at both\nhelpers and users in the placement phase to design the delivery phase.\nMeanwhile, the proposed caching scheme exploits index coding in the delivery\nphase and leverages multicast opportunities, even when different users request\ndistinct contents. Besides, we analytically characterize the performance limit\nof the proposed caching scheme, and show that the achievable rate region of the\nproposed caching scheme lies within constant margins to the\ninformation-theoretic optimum.

Recently, probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) by B\\\"ocherer et\nal. has been introduced for capacity approaching and rate-adaptive\ncommunication with a bitwise-demapper and binary decoder. Previous work by the\nauthors considered the optimization of protograph based LDPC codes for PAS and\nspecific spectral efficiencies (SEs) to jointly optimize the LDPC code node\ndegrees and the mapping of the coded bits to the bit-interleaved coded\nmodulation (BICM) bit-channels.

This inverse problem is a\nfundamental one in signal processing, and arises in many applications,\nincluding phase retrieval and blind channel estimation. In a typical phase\nretrieval setup, only the autocorrelation measurements are obtainable. We show\nthat, when the measurements are obtained using three simple \"masks\", phase\nretrieval reduces to the aforementioned reconstruction problem.\n  The classic solution to this problem is based on finding common factors\nbetween the $z$-transforms of the autocorrelation and cross-correlation\nvectors. This solution has enjoyed limited practical success, mainly due to the\nfact that it is not sufficiently stable in the noisy setting. In this work,\ninspired by the success of convex programming in provably and stably solving\nvarious quadratic constrained problems, we develop a semidefinite\nprogramming-based algorithm and provide theoretical guarantees. In particular,\nwe show that almost all signals can be uniquely recovered by this algorithm (up\nto a global phase).

This is the\nfirst observation of orientability for metric measure spaces. Our orientability\nhas two fundamental properties. One of them is the stability with respect to\nnoncollapsed sequences. As a corollary we see that if the cross section of a\ntangent cone of a noncollapsed limit space of orientable Riemannian manifolds\nis smooth, then it is also orientable in the ordinary sense, which can be\nregarded as a new obstruction for a given manifold to be the cross section of a\ntangent cone. The other one is that there are only two choices for orientations\non a limit space. We also discuss relationships between $L^2$-convergence of\norientations and convergence of currents in metric spaces. In particular for a\nnoncollapsed sequence, we prove a compatibility between the intrinsic flat\nconvergence by Sormani-Wenger, the pointed flat convergence by Lang-Wenger, and\nthe Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, which is a generalization of a recent work by\nMatveev-Portegies to the noncompact case.

On the cube $\\{-1,1\\}^n$, we\nshow that a measure $\\nu$ which exhibits low complexity can be written as a\nmixture of measures $\\{\\nu_\\theta\\}_{\\theta \\in \\mathcal{I}}$ such that: i. for\neach $\\theta$, the measure $\\nu_\\theta$ is a small perturbation of $\\nu$ such\nthat $\\log \\tfrac{d \\nu_\\theta}{d \\nu}$ is a linear function whose gradient is\nsmall and, ii. $\\nu_\\theta$ is close to some product measure, in Wasserstein\ndistance, for most $\\theta$. Thus, our framework can be used to study the\nbehavior of low-complexity measures beyond approximation of the partition\nfunction, showing that those measures are roughly mixtures of product measures\nwhose entropy is close to that of the original measure. In particular, as a\ncorollary of our theorems, we derive a bound for the na\\\"ive mean-field\napproximation of the log-partition function which improves the nonlinear large\ndeviation framework of Chatterjee and Dembo in several ways: 1.

Additionally, she observes the remainder of\nthe transmitted symbols through a discrete memoryless channel. This new model\nsubsumes the classical wiretap channel and wiretap channel II with noisy main\nchannel as its special cases. The strong secrecy capacity of the proposed\nchannel model is identified. Achievability is established by solving a dual\nsecret key agreement problem in the source model, and converting the solution\nto the original channel model using probability distribution approximation\narguments. In the dual problem, a source encoder and decoder, who observe\nrandom sequences independent and identically distributed according to the input\nand output distributions of the legitimate channel in the original problem,\ncommunicate a confidential key over a public error-free channel using a single\nforward transmission, in the presence of a compound wiretapping source who has\nperfect access to the public discussion.

In this ultra-dense edge\ncaching network (UDCN), SBS-user distances shrink, and each user can request a\ncached content from multiple SBSs. Unfortunately, the complexity of existing\ncaching controls' mechanisms increases with the number of SBSs, making them\ninapplicable for solving the fundamental caching problem: How to maximize local\ncaching gain while minimizing the replicated content caching? Furthermore,\nspatial dynamics of interference is no longer negligible in UDCNs due to the\nsurge in interference. In addition, the caching control should consider\ntemporal dynamics of user demands. To overcome such difficulties, we propose a\nnovel caching algorithm weaving together notions of mean-field game theory and\nstochastic geometry.

The performance of these schemes are studied under the\nhigh-dimensional asymptotic setting in which p grows linearly with n. In this\nasymptotic setting, phase transition diagrams (PT) are often used for comparing\nthe performance of different estimators. Although phase transition analysis is\nshown to provide useful information for compressed sensing, the fact that it\nignores the measurement noise not only limits its applicability in many\napplication areas, but also may lead to misunderstandings. For instance,\nconsider a linear regression problem in which n > p and the signal is not\nexactly sparse. If the measurement noise is ignored in such systems,\nregularization techniques, such as LQLS, seem to be irrelevant since even the\nordinary least squares (OLS) returns the exact solution.

However, determining whether or not a particular\nsensor is evolved or designed to be accurate and efficient is difficult. This\narises partly from the functional constraints being at cross purposes and\npartly since quantifying the predictive performance of even in silico sensors\ncan require prohibitively long simulations. To circumvent these difficulties,\nwe develop expressions for the predictive accuracy and thermodynamic costs of\nthe broad class of conditionally Markovian sensors subject to unifilar hidden\nsemi-Markov (memoryful) environmental inputs. Predictive metrics include the\ninstantaneous memory and the mutual information between present sensor state\nand input future, while dissipative metrics include power consumption and the\nnonpredictive information rate. Success in deriving these formulae relies\nheavily on identifying the environment's causal states, the input's minimal\nsufficient statistics for prediction. Using these formulae, we study the\nsimplest nontrivial biological sensor model---that of a Hill molecule,\ncharacterized by the number of ligands that bind simultaneously, the sensor's\ncooperativity. When energetic rewards are proportional to total predictable\ninformation, the closest cooperativity that optimizes the total energy budget\ngenerally depends on the environment's past hysteretically.

In particular,\nwe consider a three-node system with one transmitter that broadcasts a common\nsignal to separated information decoding (ID) and EH receivers. Owing to the\nnonlinearity of the EH receiver circuit, the efficiency of wireless power\ntransfer depends significantly on the waveform of the transmitted signal. In\nthis paper, we aim to answer the following fundamental question: What is the\noptimal input distribution of the transmit waveform that maximizes the rate of\nthe ID receiver for a given required harvested power at the EH receiver?

In this work we consider two\nsimultaneous extensions to the original regenerating codes framework introduced\nin [1]; i) both data reconstruction and repair are resilient to the presence of\na certain number of erroneous nodes in the network and ii) the number of helper\nnodes in every repair is not fixed, but is a flexible parameter that can be\nselected during the runtime.

We aim to characterize the capacity\nof this channel over a finite UAV communication period, subject to its maximum\nspeed constraint and an average transmit power constraint. To achieve the\ncapacity, the UAV should use a sufficiently long code that spans over its whole\ncommunication period. Accordingly, the multicast channel capacity is achieved\nvia maximizing the minimum achievable time-averaged rates of the $K$ users, by\njointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and transmit power allocation over\ntime. However, this problem is non-convex and difficult to be solved optimally.\nTo tackle this problem, we first consider a relaxed problem by ignoring the\nmaximum UAV speed constraint, and obtain its globally optimal solution via the\nLagrange dual method. The optimal solution reveals that the UAV should hover\nabove a finite number of ground locations, with the optimal hovering duration\nand transmit power at each location.

Thus, the source has to choose, how\nmany bits to transmit for each packet, and the order in which to transmit these\nbits, to minimize the cost of distortion (introduced by transmitting lower\nnumber of bits) and queueing plus transmission delay, across all packets.\nAssuming an exponential metric for distortion loss and linear delay cost, we\nshow that the optimization problem is jointly convex. Hence, the problem can be\nexactly solved using convex solvers, however, because of the complicated\nexpression derived from the KKT conditions, no closed form solution can be\nfound even with the simplest cost function choice made in the paper, also the\noptimal order in which packets should be transmitted needs to be found via\nbrute force.

Although there have\nbeen numerous IM schemes proposed thus far, none of them are free of some form\nof cost. It is, therefore, important to balance the benefit brought by and cost\nof each adopted IM scheme by adapting its operating parameters to various\nnetwork deployments and dynamic channel conditions.\n  We propose a novel IM scheme, called dynamic interference steering (DIS), by\nrecognizing the fact that interference can be not only suppressed or mitigated\nbut also steered in a particular direction. Specifically, DIS exploits both\nchannel state information (CSI) and the data contained in the interfering\nsignal to generate a signal that modifies the spatial feature of the original\ninterference to partially or fully cancel the interference appearing at the\nvictim receiver. By intelligently determining the strength of the steering\nsignal, DIS can steer the interference in an optimal direction to balance the\ntransmitter's power used for IS and the desired signal's transmission.

Specifically,\nthe UAVs first charge the GTs by transmitting the wireless energy transfer\n(WET) signals in the downlink. Then, by utilizing the harvested wireless energy\nfrom the UAVs, the GTs send their uplink wireless information transmission\n(WIT) signals to the UAVs. In this paper, depending on the operations of the\nUAVs, we adopt two different scenarios, namely integrated UAV and separated UAV\nWPCNs. First, in the integrated UAV WPCN, a UAV acts as a hybrid AP in which\nboth energy transfer and information reception are processed at a single UAV.\nIn contrast, for the separated UAV WPCN, we consider two UAVs each of which\nbehaves as an energy AP and an information AP independently, and thus the\nenergy transfer and the information decoding are separately performed at two\ndifferent UAVs. For both systems, we jointly optimize the trajectories of the\nUAVs, the uplink power control, and the time resource allocation for the WET\nand the WIT to maximize the minimum throughput of the GTs.

As a result, we propose\niterative algorithms which efficiently identify a local optimal solution for\nthe minimum throughput maximization problems.

Decentralized schemes allow the\ncreation of each cache independently, allowing users to join or leave without\ndependencies.

The LePage series,\nwhich is a probabilistic representation employed in this work, is used to\ntransform an intractable, infinite-dimensional inference problem into a\nconditionally Gaussian parametric problem. A major component of our approach is\nthe approximation of the tail of this series by a Gaussian random variable.\nStandard statistical techniques, such as Expectation-Maximization, Markov chain\nMonte Carlo, and Particle Filtering, can then be applied. In addition to the\nasymptotic normality of the tail of this series, we establish explicit,\nnonasymptotic bounds on the approximation error. Their proofs follow classical\nFourier-analytic arguments, using Ess\\'{e}en's smoothing lemma.

As one of its salient features, the wireless nodes involved in\nphysical-layer GSK generation extract randomness from a subset of their\nwireless channels, referred as the common source of randomness (CSR). Unlike\ntwo-user key generation, in GSK generation, some nodes must act as facilitators\nby broadcasting quantized versions of the linear combinations of the channel\nrealizations, so as to assist all the nodes to observe a CSR. However, we note\nthat broadcasting linear combination of channel realizations incurs non-zero\nleakage of the CSR to an eavesdropper, and moreover, quantizing the linear\ncombination also reduces the overall key-rate. Identifying these issues, we\npropose a practical GSK generation protocol, referred to as Algebraic\nSymmetrically Quantized GSK (A-SQGSK) protocol, in a network of three nodes,\nwherein due to quantization of symbols at the facilitator, the other two nodes\nalso quantize their channel realizations, and use them appropriately over\nalgebraic rings to generate the keys.

Instead, they are split, replicated (to ensure\nreliability in case of server malfunction) and stored in different servers. We\nanalyze the mean latency of such a split-and-replicate cloud storage system\nunder general sub-exponential service time. We present a novel scheduling\nscheme that utilizes the load-balancing policy of the \\textit{power of $d$\n$(\\geq 2)$} choices. An alternative to split-and-replicate is to use\nerasure-codes, and recently, it has been observed that they can reduce latency\nin data access (see \\cite{longbo_delay} for details). We argue that under high\nredundancy (integer redundancy factor strictly greater than or equal to 2)\nregime, the mean latency of a coded system is upper bounded by that of a\nsplit-and-replicate system (with same replication factor) and the gap between\nthese two is small. We validate this claim numerically under different service\ndistributions such as exponential, shift plus exponential and the heavy-tailed\nWeibull distribution and compare the mean latency to that of an\nunsplit-replicated system.

In such systems, the ultimate goal of any request is to compute a\nsequence of functions in the network, where each function can be computed at\nonly a specific subset of network nodes. In conventional approaches, for each\nfunction, we choose one node from the corresponding subset of the nodes to\ncompute that function. In contrast, in this work, we allow each function to be\ncomputed in more than one node, redundantly in parallel, to respond to a given\nrequest. We argue that such redundancy in computation not only improves the\nreliability of the network, but would also, perhaps surprisingly, reduce the\noverall transmission delay. In particular, we establish that by judiciously\nchoosing the subset of nodes which compute each function, in conjunction with a\nlinear network coding scheme to deliver the result of each computation, we can\ncharacterize and achieve the optimal end-to-end transmission delay. In\naddition, we show that using such technique, we can significantly reduce the\ntransmission delay as compared to the conventional approach. In some scenarios,\nsuch reduction can even scale with the size of the network. More precisely, by\nincreasing the number of nodes that can compute the given function in parallel\nby a multiplicative factor, the end-to-end delay will also decrease by the same\nfactor. Moreover, we show that while finding the subset of nodes for each\ncomputation, in general, is a complex integer program, approximation algorithms\ncan be proposed to reduce the computational complexity. In fact, for the case\nwhere the number of computing nodes for a given function is upper-bounded by a\nconstant, a dynamic programming scheme can be proposed to find the optimum\nsubsets in polynomial times.

The hybrid precoder is optimized for maximization of the\nminimum user rate under a fronthaul capacity constraint, an eRRH transmit power\nconstraint, and a constant-modulus constraint on the analog precoder.
