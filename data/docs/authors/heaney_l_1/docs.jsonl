Many textbooks and commentators report that Bell's theorem\nrefutes the possibility (suggested especially by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen\nin 1935) of supplementing ordinary quantum theory with additional (\"hidden\")\nvariables that might restore determinism and/or some notion of an\nobserver-independent reality. On this view, Bell's theorem supports the\northodox Copenhagen interpretation. Bell's own view of his theorem, however,\nwas quite different. He instead took the theorem as establishing an \"essential\nconflict\" between the now well-tested empirical predictions of quantum theory\nand relativistic \\emph{local causality}. The goal of the present paper is, in\ngeneral, to make Bell's own views more widely known and, in particular, to\nexplain in detail Bell's little-known mathematical formulation of the concept\nof relativistic local causality on which his theorem rests.

Overview Abstract: The operator algebraic framework plays an important role in mathematical\nphysics. Many different operator algebras exist for example for a theory of\nquantum mechanics. In Loop Quantum Gravity only two algebras have been\nintroduced until now. In the project about 'Algebras of Quantum Variables (AQV)\nfor LQG' the known holonomy-flux *-algebra and the Weyl C*-algebra will be\nmodified and a set of new algebras will be proposed and studied. The idea of\nthe construction of these algebras is to establish a finite set of operators,\nwhich generates (in the sense of Woronowicz, Schm\\\"udgen and Inoue) the\ndifferent O*- or C*-algebras of quantum gravity and to use inductive limits of\nthese algebras. In the Loop Quantum Gravity approach usually the basic\nclassical variables are connections and fluxes. Studying the three constraints\nappearing in the canonical quantisation of classical general relativity in the\nADM-formalism some other variables like curvature appear. Consequently the main\ndifficulty of a quantisation of gravity is to find a suitable replacement of\nthe set of elementary classical variables and constraints. The algebra of\nquantum gravity is supposed to be generated by a set of the operators\nassociated to holonomies, fluxes and in some cases even the curvature. There\nare two reasonable choices for this algebra: The set of constraints of Quantum\nGravity are contained in or at least the constraints are affilliated with this\nalgebra. Secondly, the algebra of quantum variables is said to be physical if\nit contains complete observables. In the project of 'Algebras of Quantum\nVariables for LQG' different algebras will be studied with respect to the\nproperty of being a physical algebra.

This theory is based on a symbolic representation of a\nfractal state-space geometry which is invariant under the action of\ndeterministic and locally causal dynamics. This symbolic representation is\nconstructed from self-similar families of quaternionic operators. Using\nnumber-theoretic properties of the cosine function, the statistical properties\nof the symbolic representation of the invariant set are shown to be consistent\nwith the contextual requirements of the Kochen-Specker theorem, are not\nconstrained by Bell inequalities, and mirror the statistics of entangled\nqubits. These number-theoretic properties in turn reflect the sparseness of the\ninvariant set in state space, and relate to the metaphysical notion of\ncounterfactual incompleteness. Using the concept of probability, the complex\nHilbert Space can be considered the completion of this symbolic representation\ninto the state space continuum. As a result, it is proposed that the complex\nHilbert Space should merely be considered a computational convenience in the\nlight of the algorithmic intractability of the invariant set geometry, and\nconsequently the superposed state should not be considered a fundamental aspect\nof physical theory. The physical basis for the proposed theory is relativistic\ngravity; for example the symbols used to describe the invariant set themselves\nlabel gravitationally distinct cosmological space-times.

In the 1960s, Kochen and Specker\n(who first studied these theories) constructed an elegant psi-epistemic theory\nfor Hilbert space dimension d=2, but also showed that any deterministic\npsi-epistemic theory must be \"measurement contextual\" in dimensions 3 and\nhigher. Last year, the topic attracted renewed attention, when Pusey, Barrett,\nand Rudolph (PBR) showed that any psi-epistemic theory must \"behave badly under\ntensor product.\" In this paper, we prove that even without the Kochen-Specker\nor PBR assumptions, there are no psi-epistemic theories in dimensions d>=3 that\nsatisfy two reasonable conditions: (1) symmetry under unitary transformations,\nand (2) \"maximum nontriviality\" (meaning that the probability distributions\ncorresponding to any two non-orthogonal states overlap). This no-go theorem\nholds if the ontic space is either the set of quantum states or the set of\nunitaries. The proof of this result, in the general case, uses some measure\ntheory and differential geometry. On the other hand, we also show the\nsurprising result that without the symmetry restriction, one can construct\nmaximally-nontrivial psi-epistemic theories in every finite dimension d. \n\n"}

There are\nmultiple mechanisms by which such noise is generated, many of which are poorly\nunderstood. Laser-cooled, trapped ions provide one of the most sensitive\nsystems to probe electric-field noise at MHz frequencies and over a distance\nrange 30 - 3000 $\\mu$m from the surface. Over recent years numerous experiments\nhave reported spectral densities of electric-field noise inferred from ion\nheating-rate measurements and several different theoretical explanations for\nthe observed noise characteristics have been proposed. This paper provides an\nextensive summary and critical review of electric-field noise measurements in\nion traps, and compares these experimental findings with known and conjectured\nmechanisms for the origin of this noise. This reveals that the presence of\nmultiple noise sources, as well as the different scalings added by geometrical\nconsiderations, complicate the interpretation of these results. It is thus the\npurpose of this review to assess which conclusions can be reasonably drawn from\nthe existing data, and which important questions are still open.

Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that\nquantum coherence and entanglement may play a role in this excitation energy\ntransfer (EET).

We compare the results for\nnonlocality with the amount of bipartite entanglement in the system. In\nparticular, we analyze in what way these correlation properties are affected by\ndifferent initial conditions. It is found that bipartite nonlocality only\nexists when the initial conditions are chosen in an unphysiological manner and\nprobably is absent when considering the EET in the FMO complex in its natural\nhabitat.

Structural physical approximation offers a systematic way of\napproximating those non-physical maps, positive but not completely positive\nmaps, with quantum channels.

The alternatives are represented by binary\nalternatives, which are called Ur-alternatives because of their logically\nfundamental character. Through Ur-alternatives as elementary quantum\ntheoretical units of information the Copernican revolution with respect to the\nquestion of space is realized in a consequent way. This means that not the\nobjects of nature are in a given space, but the existence of space arises as a\nkind of indirect representation of relations between abstract quantum\ntheoretical objects. The Ur-alternatives do not exist in a given physical\nreality, but the existence of space is constituted by Ur-alternatives at all.\nSuch a concept of reality is implicitly contained within the uncertainty\nrelation and can be seen especially in the EPR-paradoxon.

They work by gluing together states of overlapping clusters of\nsites on the lattice, called correlators. Recently Carleo and Troyer Science\n355, 602 (2017) introduced a new type sampleable ansatz called neural-network\nquantum states (NQS) that are inspired by the restricted Boltzmann model used\nin machine learning. By employing the formalism of tensor networks we show that\nNQS are a special form of CPS with novel properties. Diagramatically a number\nof simple observations become transparent. Namely, that NQS are CPS built from\nextensively sized GHZ-form correlators, which are related to a canonical\npolyadic decomposition of a tensor, making them uniquely unbiased\ngeometrically. Another immediate implication of the equivalence to CPS is that\nwe are able to formulate exact NQS representations for a wide range of\nparadigmatic states, including superposition of weighed-graph states, the\nLaughlin state, toric code states, and the resonating valence bond state. These\nexamples reveal the potential of using higher dimensional hidden units and a\nsecond hidden layer in NQS. The major outlook of this study is the elevation of\nNQS to correlator operators allowing them to enhance conventional\nwell-established variational Monte Carlo approaches for strongly correlated\nfermions. \n\n"}

Some of the previous work focused on obtaining a\nquantum advantage for trees in which a unique marked vertex is promised to\nexist. We remove this restriction and re-characterise the problem in terms of\nthe effective resistance of the search space. To this end, we present a\ngeneralisation of one of Montanaro's algorithms to trees containing $k \\geq 1$\nmarked vertices, where $k$ is not necessarily known \\textit{a priori}.\n  Our approach involves using amplitude estimation to determine a near-optimal\nweighting of a diffusion operator, which can then be applied to prepare a\nsuperposition state that has support only on marked vertices and ancestors\nthereof. By repeatedly sampling this state and updating the input vertex, a\nmarked vertex is reached in a logarithmic number of steps.

In this paper we evaluate Pauli's theorem against the single\nHilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics, and consequently show the\nconsistency of assuming a bounded, self-adjoint time operator canonically\nconjugate to a Hamiltonian with an unbounded, or semibounded, or finite point\nspectrum. We point out Pauli's implicit assumptions and show that they are not\nconsistent in a single Hilbert space. We demonstrate our analysis by giving two\nexplicit examples. Moreover, we clarify issues sorrounding the different\nsolutions to the canonical commutation relations, and, consequently, expand the\nclass of acceptable canonical pairs beyond the solutions required by Pauli's\ntheorem. \n\n"}

The features of the\nspontaneous emission are investigated and the lifetime of the initial state is\nevaluated: a Fermi \"golden rule\" still applies, but the on-shell matrix\nelements depend on the intensity of the laser field. In general, the lifetime\nis a decreasing function of the laser intensity. The phenomenon we discuss can\nbe viewed as an \"inverse\" quantum Zeno effect and can be analyzed in terms of\ndressed states. \n\n"}

Two\ndifferent concepts of \"mixed state\" for any nonlinear version of quantum theory\nare introduced: (i) >genuine mixture< corresponds to operational \"mixing\" of\ndifferent ensembles, and (ii) a mixture described by single density matrix\nwithout having a canonical operational possibility to pick out its specific\nconvex decomposition is called here an >elementary mixture<. Time evolution of\na class of nonlinear extensions of quantum mechanics is introduced. Evolution\nof an elementary mixture cannot be generally given by evolutions of components\nof its arbitrary convex decompositions. The theory is formulated in a\n\"geometric form\": It can be considered as a version of Hamiltonian mechanics on\ninfinite dimensional space of density matrices. A quantum interpretation of the\ntheory is sketched. \n\n"}

Complete\nsets of \"eigenfunctions\" are constructed, which depend on the way of choosing\nclassical solutions. For an eigenfunction, two different motions of the\nprobability distribution function (pulsation of the width and oscillation of\nthe center) contribute to the geometric phase which can be given in terms of\nthe parameters of classical solutions. The geometric phase for a general wave\nfunction is also given. If a wave function has a parity under the inversion of\nspace coordinate, then the geometric phase can be defined under the evolution\nof half of the period of classical motions. For the driven case, geometric\nphases are given in terms of Fourier coefficients of the external force. The\noscillator systems whose classical equation of motion is Mathieu's equation are\nperturbatively studied, and the first term of nonvanishing geometric phase is\ncalculated. \n\n"}

As a result, this\nmodification can be formulated in three different ways depending on which\nphysically relevant properties one aims to preserve.
