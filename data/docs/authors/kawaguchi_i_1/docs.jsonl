Of particular importance is the fate of the\ninitial value problem. Under what circumstances do infinite order differential\nequations possess a well-defined initial value problem and how many initial\ndata are required? In this paper we study the initial value problem for\ninfinite order differential equations in the mathematical framework of the\nformal operator calculus, with analytic initial data. This formalism allows us\nto handle simultaneously a wide array of different nonlocal equations within a\nsingle framework and also admits a transparent physical interpretation.

A key concept of the LORE method is the introduction of\nirreducible loop integrals (ILIs) which are evaluated from the Feynman diagrams\nby adopting the Feynman parametrization and\nultraviolet-divergence-preserving(UVDP) parametrization. It is then inevitable\nfor the ILIs to encounter the divergences in the UVDP parameter space due to\nthe generic overlapping divergences in the 4-dimensional momentum space. By\ncomputing the so-called $\\alpha\\beta\\gamma$ integrals arising from two loop\nFeynman diagrams, we show how to deal with the divergences in the parameter\nspace with the LORE method. By identifying the divergences in the UVDP\nparameter space to those in the subdiagrams, we arrive at the Bjorken-Drell's\nanalogy between Feynman diagrams and electrical circuits. The UVDP parameters\nare shown to correspond to the conductance or resistance in the electrical\ncircuits, and the divergence in Feynman diagrams is ascribed to the infinite\nconductance or zero resistance. In particular, the sets of conditions required\nto eliminate the overlapping momentum integrals for obtaining the ILIs are\nfound to be associated with the conservations of electric voltages, and the\nmomentum conservations correspond to the conservations of electrical currents,\nwhich are known as the Kirchhoff's laws in the electrical circuits analogy. As\nan application to the massive scalar $\\phi^4$ theory, it enables us to obtain\nthe well-known logarithmic running of the coupling constant and the consistent\npower-law running of the scalar mass at two loop level. Especially, we present\nan explicit demonstration on the general procedure of applying the LORE method\nto the multiloop calculations of Feynman diagrams when merging with the\nadvantage of Bjorken-Drell's circuit analogy. \n\n"}

We construct the\nsimplest dynamical Lagrangian density that is entirely composed from the\nconnection, via its curvature and torsion, and is an algebraic function of its\nderivatives. It is given by the contraction of the Ricci tensor with a tensor\nwhich is inverse to the symmetric, contracted square of the torsion tensor,\n$k_{\\mu\\nu}=S^\\rho_{\\lambda\\mu}S^\\lambda_{\\rho\\nu}$. We vary the total action\nfor the gravitational field and matter with respect to the affine connection,\nassuming that the matter fields couple to the connection only through\n$k_{\\mu\\nu}$. We derive the resulting field equations and show that they are\nidentical with the Einstein equations of general relativity with a nonzero\ncosmological constant, if the tensor $k_{\\mu\\nu}$ is regarded as the metric\ntensor. The cosmological constant is simply a constant of proportionality\nbetween the two tensors, which together with $c$ and $G$ provides a natural\nsystem of units in gravitational physics.

Here, we study generally covariant metric-torsion theories of gravity\npresented more concretely, setting that their Lagrangians are \\emph{manifestly}\ngenerally covariant scalars. It is assumed that Lagrangians depend on metric\ntensor, curvature tensor, torsion tensor and its first and second covariant\nderivatives, besides, on an arbitrary set of other tensor (matter) fields and\ntheir first and second covariant derivatives. Thus, both the standard minimal\ncoupling with the Riemann-Cartan geometry and non-minimal coupling with the\ncurvature and torsion tensors are considered.\n  The studies and results are as follow. (a) A physical interpretation of the\nNoether and Klein identities is examined.

In particular this first part describes the\nanalytic continuation, the functional equation, trivial zeros, the Euler\nproduct formula, Riemann's main result relating the zeros on the critical strip\nto the distribution of primes, the exact counting formula for the number of\nzeros on the strip $N(T)$, and the GUE statistics of the zeros on the critical\nline. We then turn to presenting some new results obtained in the past year and\ndescribe several strategies towards proving the RH. First we describe an\nelectrostatic analogy and argue that if the electric potential along the line\n$\\Re (z) =1$ is a regular alternating function, the RH would follow. The main\nnew result is that the zeros on the critical line are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the zeros of the cosine function, and this leads to a\ntranscendental equation for the $n$-th zero on the critical line that depends\nonly on $n$. If there is a unique solution to this equation for every $n$,\ndenoting $N_0 (T)$ the number of zeros on the critical line, then $N_0(T) =\nN(T)$, i.e. all zeros are on the critical line. These results are generalized\nto two infinite classes of functions, Dirichlet $L$-functions and $L$-functions\nbased on modular forms. We present extensive numerical analysis of the\nsolutions of these equations. We apply these methods to the Davenport-Heilbronn\n$L$-function, which is known to have zeros off of the line, and explain why the\nRH fails in this case.

Although knots and links are observables of\nthe Chern-Simons (C-S) functional, the dynamical conditions for their\ngeneration lie outside of the scope of the C-S theory. The nontriviality of\ndynamical generation of knotted structures is caused by the fact that the\ncomplements of all knots/links, say, in S^3 are 3-manifolds which have\npositive, negative or zero curvature. The ability to curve the ambient space\nthus far is attributed to masses. The mass theorem of general relativity\nrequires the ambient 3-manifolds to be of non negative curvature. Recently, we\nestablished that, in the absence of boundaries, complements of dynamically\ngenerated knots/links are represented by 3-manifolds of non negative curvature.\nThis fact opens the possibility to discuss masses in terms of dynamically\ngenerated knotted/ linked structures. The key tool is the notion of knot/link\nconcordance. The concept of concordance is an adaptation of the concept of\ncobordism to knots and links.

Instead, gauge invariant quantities generally become\ndiscontinuous, thus not admitting Poisson-algebraic structures and posing\nserious challenges to a quantization. Non-integrability also renders the\nparadigm of relational dynamics cumbersome, thereby straining common\ninterpretations of the dynamics. We illustrate these conceptual and technical\nchallenges with simple toy models. In particular, we exhibit reparametrization\ninvariant models which fail to be integrable and, as a consequence, can either\nnot be quantized with standard methods or lead to sick quantum theories without\na semiclassical limit.

The growth probability of a cluster is\npresented as a sum over all possible scenarios leading to the same final shape.\nThe classical point for the action, defined as a minus logarithm of the growth\nprobability, describes the most probable scenario and reproduces the Laplacian\ngrowth equation, which embraces numerous fundamental free boundary dynamics in\nnon-equilibrium physics. For non-classical scenarios we introduce virtual point\nsources, in which presence the action becomes the Kullback-Leibler entropy.\nStrikingly, this entropy is shown to be the sum of electrostatic energies of\nlayers grown per elementary time unit. Hence the growth probability of the\npresented non-equilibrium process obeys the Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics, which,\nas a rule, is not applied out from equilibrium. Each layer's probability is\nexpressed as a product of simple factors in an auxiliary complex plane after a\nproperly chosen conformal map. The action at this plane is a sum of Robin\nfunctions, which solve the Liouville equation.

It is shown that the Gaussian entanglement\nshares the same set of mathematical formulas with the harmonic oscillator in\nthe Lorentz-covariant world. It is thus possible to transfer the concept of\nentanglement to the Lorentz-covariant picture of the bound state which requires\nboth space and time separations between two constituent particles. These space\nand time variables become entangled as the bound state moves with a\nrelativistic speed. It is shown also that our inability to measure the\ntime-separation variable leads to an entanglement entropy together with a rise\nin the temperature of the bound state. As was noted by Paul A. M.

In this work, we initiate the study of\nmultipartite entanglement in a rich, yet tractable class of quantum states\ncalled stabilizer tensor networks. We demonstrate that, for generic stabilizer\ntensor networks, the geometry of the tensor network informs the multipartite\nentanglement structure of the state. In particular, we show that the average\nnumber of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) triples that can be extracted from\na stabilizer tensor network is small, implying that tripartite entanglement is\nscarce.

The main challenge is that the systems used for\ntransmitting physical information, in addition to any actions applied to them,\nmust necessarily obey these limitations. Encoding and decoding operations that\nobey a restrictive set of limitations need not exist a priori. We focus on the\ncase of erasure errors, and we first show that the problem is equivalent to\nquantum error correction using group-covariant encodings. We prove a no-go\ntheorem showing that that no finite dimensional, group-covariant quantum codes\nexist for Lie groups with an infinitesimal generator (e.g., U(1), SU(2), and\nSO(3)). We then explain how one can circumvent this no-go theorem using\ninfinite dimensional codes, and we give an explicit example of a covariant\nquantum error correcting code using continuous variables for the group U(1).\nFinally, we demonstrate that all finite groups have finite dimensional codes,\ngiving both an explicit construction and a randomized approximate construction\nwith exponentially better parameters. \n\n"}

In the\npresent paper, we employ the complexifier coherent states for QGR recently\nproposed by Thiemann and Winkler as semiclassical states, and thus fill the\ngeneral formulas obtained in [1] with life. We demonstrate how one can, under\nsome simplifying assumptions, explicitely compute expectation values of the\noperators relevant for the gravity-matter Hamiltonians of [1] in the\ncomplexifier coherent states. These expectation values give rise to effective\nmatter Hamiltonians on the background on which the gravitational coherent state\nis peaked and thus induce approximate notions of n-particle states and matter\npropagation on fluctuating spacetimes. We display the details for the scalar\nand the electromagnetic field. The effective theories exhibit two types of\ncorrections as compared to the the ordinary QFT on CST.

The main\naim of the paper is to show that, changing the quantization axis with respect\nto the common usage, it is possible to prove a general result either for N or\nthe coupling constant going to infinity for the exact solution of the model.\nThis completes the analysis, known in the current literature, with respect to\nthe same model in the limit of N and volume going to infinity, keeping the\ndensity constant. For the latter the proper axis of quantization is given by\nthe Hamiltonian of the two-level atoms and for the former the proper axis of\nquantization is defined by the interaction. The relevance of this result relies\non the observation that a general measurement apparatus acts using\nelectromagnetic interaction and so, one can states that the thermodynamic limit\nis enough to grant the appearance of classical effects. Indeed, recent\nexperimental results give first evidence that superposition states disappear\ninteracting with an electromagnetic field having a large number of photons. \n\n"}

We use this basis to\nconstruct the observables O of the quantum mechanics based on H. In particular,\nwe introduce pseudo-Hermitian position and momentum operators and a\npseudo-Hermitian quantization scheme that relates the latter to the ordinary\nclassical position and momentum observables. These allow us to address the\nproblem of determining the conserved probability density and the underlying\nclassical system for pseudo-Hermitian and in particular PT-symmetric quantum\nsystems. As a concrete example we construct the Hermitian Hamiltonian h, the\nphysical observables O, the localized states, and the conserved probability\ndensity for the non-Hermitian PT-symmetric square well.
