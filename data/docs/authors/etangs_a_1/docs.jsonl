Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

We analyze the infrared (IR) spectral energy distributions of radio,\nsub-millimeter and mid-IR selected AGNs at z~1-3 and constrain their stellar\nand AGN luminosities using AGN and host-galaxy templates.\n  Results. We find evidence of increasing stellar light, thereby decreasing the\nAGN mid-IR power going from mid-IR selected AGNs, to radio galaxies, and to\nsub-millimeter AGNs. This trend can be explained by either decreasing Eddington\nratios or increasing offsets from the local M_BH-M_star relation. All systems\nare characterized by high star formation rates regardless of their different\nAGN powers, thus neither AGN radiative power nor AGN-driven radio activity\nseems to influence the star formation rate in the selected AGNs. We discuss two\npossible evolutionary scenarios that might link these three AGN classes. \n\n"}

Limits on the speed of gravitational waves Abstract: In the current work we investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves\nin the field of gravitational waves. Starting with simple case of an\nelectromagnetic wave travelling in the field of a plane monochromatic\ngravitational wave we introduce the concept of surfing effect and analyze its\nphysical consequences. We then generalize these results to an arbitrary\ngravitational wave field. We show that, due to the transverse nature of\ngravitational waves, the surfing effect leads to significant observable\nconsequences only if the velocity of gravitational waves deviates from speed of\nlight. This fact can help to place an upper limit on the deviation of\ngravitational wave velocity from speed of light.

We\nfind a sequence of correlations, starting with a positive correlation between\nthe radio and soft X-ray fluxes in the hard spectral state, changing to a\nnegative one at the transition to soft spectral states. The temporal evolution\ncan be in either direction on that sequence, unless the source goes into a very\nweak radio state, from which it can return only following a major radio flare.\nThe flare decline is via relatively bright radio states, which results in a\nhysteresis loop on the flux-flux diagram. We also study the hard X-ray light\ncurve, and find its overall anticorrelation with the soft X-rays. During major\nradio flares, the radio flux responds exponentially to the level of a hard\nX-ray high-energy tail. We also specify the detailed correspondence between the\nradio states and the X-ray spectral states. We compare our results to those of\nblack-hole and neutron-star binaries.

So far\nWIMPs have eluded direct detection through interactions with baryonic matter.\nNeutrino emission from accumulated WIMP annihilations in the solar core has\nbeen proposed as a signature of DM, but has not yet been detected. These null\nresults may be due to small scale DM density fluctuations in the halo with the\ndensity of our local region being lower than the average (around 0.3 GeV/cm^3\n). However, the accumulated neutrino signal from WIMP annihilations in the\nGalactic stellar disk would be insensitive to local density variations. Inside\nthe disk, dark matter can be captured by stars causing an enhanced annihilation\nrate and therefore a potentially higher neutrino flux than what would be\nobserved from elsewhere in the halo. We estimate a neutrino flux from the WIMP\nannihilations in the stellar disk to be enhanced by more than an order of\nmagnitude compared to the neutrino fluxes from the halo. We offer a\nconservative estimate for this enhanced flux, based on the WIMP-nucleon\ncross-sections obtained from direct-detection experiments by assuming a density\nof around 0.3 GeV/cm^3 for the local DM.

A growing number of systems are reported to be in\nresonance, which is thought to arise from the planet migration process. If\nplanets are brought together and moved inward through torques produced by\ncircumstellar disks, then disk turbulence can act to prevent planets from\nstaying in a resonant configuration. This paper studies this process through\nnumerical simulations and via analytic model equations, where both approaches\ninclude stochastic forcing terms due to turbulence. We explore how the\namplitude and forcing time intervals of the turbulence affect the maintenance\nof mean motion resonances. If turbulence is common in circumstellar disks\nduring the epoch of planet migration, with the amplitudes indicated by current\nMHD simulations, then planetary systems that remain deep in mean motion\nresonance are predicted to be rare. More specifically, the fraction of resonant\nsystems that survive over a typical disk lifetime of 1 Myr is of order 0.01. If\nmean motion resonances are found to be common, their existence would place\ntight constraints on the amplitude and duty cycle of turbulent fluctuations in\ncircumstellar disks. These results can be combined by expressing the expected\nfraction of surviving resonant systems in the approximate form P_b = C /\nN_{orb}^{1/2}, where the dimensionless parameter C = 10 - 50 and where N_{orb}\nis the number of orbits for which turbulence is active. \n\n"}

This suggests that bright quasars must be triggered\nin major mergers: a large fraction of the galaxy must be converted to new bulge\nmass in a dynamical time or less.

This predicts a transition to merger-induced fueling\naround the traditional quasar-Seyfert luminosity divide (growth of BH masses\nabove/below 10^7 M_sun). We compile observations to test several predictions of\nsuch a division, including: (1) A transition to bulge-dominated hosts. (2) A\ntransition between 'pseudobulges' and 'classical' bulges hosting the remnant\nBHs: pseudobulges are formed in secular processes and minor mergers, whereas\nclassical bulges are relics of major mergers.

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems.

The theoretical results are used to develop models of\nbinary or multiple system formation from RPPs, and explain the observation that\na greater fraction of binaries originated farther from the Sun. At the stage of\nRPPs, small-body satellites can form in two ways: a merger between RPPs can\nhave two centers of contraction, or the formation of satellites from a disc\naround the primary or the secondary. Formation of the disc can be caused by\nthat the angular momentum of the RPP formed by the merger is greater than the\ncritical angular momentum for a solid body.

This result is in agreement with the recent\nmeasurements for dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) in the Milky Way by Strigari\net al.

This paper looks at the\neffect of large planetesimal eccentricities (e>>0.3) on their collisional\nlifetime and the amount of mass that can remain at late times M_{late}. For an\naxisymmetric planetesimal disk with common pericentres and eccentricities e, we\nfind that M_{late} \\propto e^{-5/3}(1+e)^{4/3}(1-e)^{-3}. For a scattered\ndisk-like population (i.e., common pericentres), in the absence of dynamical\nevolution, the mass evolution at late times would be as if only planetesimals\nwith the largest eccentricity were present. Despite the increased remaining\nmass, higher eccentricities do not increase the hot emission from the\ncollisional cascade until e>0.99, partly because most collisions occur near\npericentre thus increasing the dust blow-out diameter. However, at high\neccentricities (e>0.97) the blow-out population extending out from pericentre\nmay be detectable above the collisional cascade; higher eccentricities also\nincrease the probability of witnessing a recent collision. All of the imaging\nand spectroscopic constraints for eta Corvi can be explained with a single\nplanetesimal population with pericentre at 0.75AU, apocentre at 150AU, and mass\n5M_\\oplus; however, the origin of such a high eccentricity population remains\nchallenging.

We model the global shape of the\nstellar cross-correlation function as the convolution of a limb-darkened\nrotation profile and a gaussian representing the Doppler core of the average\nphotospheric line profile. The light blocked by the planet during the transit\nis a gaussian of the same intrinsic width, whose trajectory across the line\nprofile yields a precise measure of the misalignment angle and an independent\nmeasure of v sin I.

This\ntime-dependent surface heating gives rise to fluid motions which propagate\nthroughout the planet. We investigate the ability of this \"thermal tide\" to\nproduce a quadrupole moment which can couple to the stellar gravitational tidal\nforce. While previous investigations discussed planets with solid surfaces,\nhere we focus on entirely fluid planets in order to understand gas giants with\nsmall cores. The Coriolis force, thermal diffusion and self-gravity of the\nperturbations are ignored for simplicity. First, we examine the response to\nthermal forcing through analytic solutions of the fluid equations which treat\nthe forcing frequency as a small parameter. In the \"equilibrium tide\" limit of\nzero frequency, fluid motion is present but does not induce a quadrupole\nmoment. In the next approximation, finite frequency corrections to the\nequilibrium tide do lead to a nonzero quadrupole moment, the sign of which\ntorques the planet {\\it away} from synchronous spin. We then numerically solve\nthe boundary value problem for the thermally forced, linear response of a\nplanet with neutrally stratified interior and stably stratified envelope. The\nnumerical results find quadrupole moments in agreement with the analytic\nnon-resonant result at sufficiently long forcing period. Surprisingly, in the\nrange of forcing periods of 1-30 days, the induced quadrupole moments can be\nfar larger than the analytic result due to response of internal gravity waves\nwhich propagate in the radiative envelope.

We find that these models predict\ntoo many passive satellite galaxies in clusters, too few passive central\ngalaxies with low stellar masses, and too many passive central galaxies with\nhigh masses. We then outline a series of modifications to the model necessary\nto solve these problems: a) Instead of instantaneous stripping of the external\ngas reservoir after a galaxy becomes a satellite, the gas supply is assumed to\ndecrease at the same rate that the surrounding halo loses mass due to tidal\nstripping, b) The AGN feedback efficiency is lowered to bring the fraction of\nmassive passive centrals in better agreement with the data. We also allow for\nradio mode AGN feedback in satellite galaxies. c) We assume that satellite\ngalaxies residing in host haloes with masses below 10^12 M_sun do not undergo\nany stripping.

The ability to\ndo this relies on the system being in a quasi-equilibrium state in the sense\nthat the eccentricities are constant on the usual secular timescale, and decay\non a timescale which is much longer than the age of the system. Since the\nequilibrium eccentricity is effectively a function only of observable system\nparameters and the unknown Love number of the short-period planet, the latter\ncan be determined with accurate measurements of the planet's eccentricity and\nradius. However, this analysis relies on the unlikely assumption that the\nsystem is coplanar. Here we generalize our recent analysis of this fixed-point\nphenomenon to mutually inclined systems and show that the fixed point of\ncoplanar systems is replaced by a limit cycle, with the average value of the\neccentricity decreasing and its amplitude of variation increasing with\nincreasing mutual inclination. This behaviour significantly reduces the ability\nto unambiguously determine the Love number of the short-period planet if the\nmutual inclination is higher than around 10^o. We show that for Q-values less\nthan 10^6, the HAT-P-13 system cannot have a mutual inclination between 54 and\n126^o because Kozai oscillations coupled with tidal dissipation would act to\nquickly move the inclination outside this range, and that the behaviour of\nretrograde systems is the mirror image of that for prograde systems.

So\nfar, UV transit observations have led to the detection of atomic hydrogen,\noxygen and ionized carbon in the upper atmosphere of HD209458b. The\ninterpretation of these observations is controversial - it is not clear if the\nabsorption arises from an escaping atmosphere interacting with the stellar\nradiation and stellar wind, or the thermosphere inside the Roche lobe. Here we\nintroduce an empirical model that can be used to analyze UV transit depths of\nextrasolar planets and use it to interpret the transits of HD209458b in the H\nLy alpha and the OI triplet emission lines. The results indicate that the mean\ntemperature of the thermosphere is 8,000-11,000 K and that the H2/H\ndissociation front is located at pressures between 0.1-1 microbar, which\ncorrespond to an altitude of 1.1 Rp. The upper boundary of the model\nthermosphere is located at altitudes between 2.7-3 Rp, above which the\natmosphere is mostly ionized. We find that the HI transit depth reflects the\noptical depth of the thermosphere in the wings of the H Ly alpha line but that\nthe atmosphere also overflows the Roche lobe. By assuming a solar mixing ratio\nof oxygen, we obtain an OI transit depth that is statistically consistent with\nthe observations. An OI transit depth comparable to or slightly larger than the\nHI transit depth is possible if the atmosphere is undergoing fast hydrodynamic\nescape, the O/H ratio is supersolar, or if a significant quantity of neutral\noxygen is found outside the Roche lobe. Due to the large uncertainty in the\ndata, repeated observations are necessary to better constrain the OI transit\ndepths and thus the composition of the thermosphere. \n\n"}

Vortices have the ability to sequester particles, with\ntypical radii from about 1 mm to 10 cm, that are slightly decoupled from the\ngas. A generic feature of discs with surface density and effective temperature\nprofiles that are decreasing, power-law functions of radial distance is that\nfour vortex zones exist for a fixed particle size. In particular, two of the\nzones form an annulus at intermediate radial distances within which small\nparticles reside. Particle capture by vortices occurs on a dynamical time scale\nnear and at the boundaries of this annulus. As the disc ages and the particles\ngrow via coagulation, the size of the annulus shrinks. Older discs prefer to\ncapture smaller particles because the gas surface density decreases with time,\na phenomenon we term \"vortex aging\". More viscous, more dust-opaque and/or less\nmassive discs can have vortices that age faster and trap a broader range of\nparticle sizes throughout the lifetime of the disc. Thus, how efficiently a\ndisc retains its mass in solids depends on the relative time scales between\ncoagulation and vortex aging. If vortices form in protoplanetary discs, they\nare important in discs with typical masses and for particles that are likely to\ncondense out of the protostellar nebula. Particle capture also occurs at\ndistances relevant to planet formation. Future infrared, submillimetre and\ncentimetre observations of grain opacity as a function of radial distance will\ntest the hypothesis that vortices serve as nurseries for particle growth in\nprotoplanetary discs. \n\n"}

The main source\nof opacity in these objects is dust grains. We investigate two problems\ninvolving the effect of opacity on the evolution of planets of 3, 5, and 7 M_J.\nFirst, we pick three different overall metallicities for the planet and simply\nscale the opacity accordingly. We show that higher metallicity results in\nslower contraction as a result of higher opacity. It is found that the\npre-collapse time scale is proportional to the metallicity. In this scenario,\nsurvival of giant planets formed by gravitational instability is predicted to\nbe more likely around low-metallicity stars, since they evolve to the point of\ncollapse to small size on shorter time scales. But metal-rich planets, as a\nresult of longer contraction times, have the best opportunity to capture\nplanetesimals and form heavy-element cores. Second, we investigate the effects\nof opacity reduction as a result of grain growth and settling, for the same\nthree planetary masses and for three different values of overall metallicity.\nWhen these processes are included, the pre-collapse time scale is found to be\nof order 1000 years for the three masses, significantly shorter than the time\nscale calculated without these effects. In this case the time scale is found to\nbe relatively insensitive to planetary mass and composition. However, the\neffects of planetary rotation and accretion of gas and dust, which could\nincrease the timescale, are not included in the calculation.

Electrons are initially extracted from the surface of the star by\nthe intense rotation induced electric fields and later transformed into\nelectron-positron pairs through electromagnetic cascading. Observations of\nPulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) show that cascades in the pulsar magnetosphere must\nensure pair multiplicities of order $10^{4}-10^{5}$. These pairs finally end up\nas part of the relativistic magnetized wind emanating from the pulsar. The wind\nis slowed down, from its highly relativistic bulk motion, at a termination\nshock, which represents the reverse shock due to its interaction with the\nsurrounding ejecta of the progenitor supernova. At the (relativistic)\ntermination shock, acceleration of the pairs occurs, as part of the dissipation\nprocess, so that the cold wind is transformed into a plasma of relativistic\nnon-thermal particles, plus a potential thermal component, which however has\nnever been observed. As long as the pulsar wind is embedded in the supernova\nremnant these pairs are forced to escavate a bubble and lose energy\nadiabatically (because of the expansion) and radiatively (because of magnetic\nand radiation fields). We discuss here the observational constraints on the\nenergy and number content of such pairs and discuss the scenarios that may\nallow for the pairs to escape in the interstellar medium and possibly\ncontribute to the positron excess that has recently been detected by the PAMELA\nsatellite. Special attention is dedicated to the case of Pulsar Bow Shock\nNebulae. The pairs produced in these objects may be effectively carried out of\nthe Supernova Remnant and released in the Interstellar Medium. As a result, Bow\nShock Pulsar Wind Nebulae might be the main contributors to the positron excess\nin the Galaxy. \n\n"}

New Spitzer\n  observations at 3.6 microns Abstract: We present a new primary transit observation of the hot-jupiter HD189733b,\nobtained at 3.6 microns with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the\nSpitzer Space Telescope. Previous measurements at 3.6 microns suffered from\nstrong systematics and conclusions could hardly be obtained with confidence on\nthe water detection by comparison of the 3.6 and 5.8 microns observations. We\nuse a high S/N Spitzer photometric transit light curve to improve the precision\nof the near infrared radius of the planet at 3.6 microns. The observation has\nbeen performed using high-cadence time series integrated in the subarray mode.\nWe are able to derive accurate system parameters, including planet-to-star\nradius ratio, impact parameter, scale of the system, and central time of the\ntransit from the fits of the transit light curve. We compare the results with\ntransmission spectroscopic models and with results from previous observations\nat the same wavelength. We obtained the following system parameters:\nR_p/R_\\star=0.15566+0.00011-0.00024, b=0.661+0.0053-0.0050, and\na/R_\\star=8.925+0.0490-0.0523 at 3.6 microns. These measurements are three\ntimes more accurate than previous studies at this wavelength because they\nbenefit from greater observational efficiency and less statistic and systematic\nerrors. Nonetheless, we find that the radius ratio has to be corrected for\nstellar activity and present a method to do so using ground-based long-duration\nphotometric follow-up in the V-band. The resulting planet-to-star radius ratio\ncorrected for the stellar variability is in agreement with the previous\nmeasurement obtained in the same bandpass (Desert et al. 2009). We also discuss\nthat water vapour could not be evidenced by comparison of the planetary radius\nmeasured at 3.6 and 5.8 microns, because the radius measured at 3.6 microns is\naffected by absorption by other species, possibly Rayleigh scattering by haze. \n\n"}

These overluminous clusters preserve statistically the mean value\nof <Q(H0)> obtained by synthesis models, but the mean value cannot be used as a\ndescription of particular clusters.

It is proposed that the\ngravitational potential energy released by the formation of a short-period\nbinary, most likely source I, resulted in stellar ejection and powered the\noutflow. A scenario is presented for the formation of a compact,\nnon-hierarchical multiple star system, its decay into an ejected binary and two\nhigh-velocity stars, and launch of the outflow.

In this article we explore whether cosmological\nperturbations indeed have zero mean, and thus test one aspect of statistical\nhomogeneity. We carry out a classical test of the zero mean hypothesis against\na class of alternatives in which perturbations have non-vanishing means, but\nhomogeneous and isotropic covariances.

Alternatively, we test - by varying\nthe assumed proper motion - if the orbital phase of Palomar 13 within its orbit\nabout the Milky Way can influence its appearance and thus may be the origin of\nthese peculiarities, as has been suggested by Kuepper et al.

Analysis of the NaI absorption\nline profile has already shown that the sodium abundance has to drop by at\nleast a factor of ten above a critical altitude. Here we analyze the profile in\nthe deep core of the NaI doublet line from HST and high-resolution ground-based\nspectra to further constrain the vertical structure of the HD209458b\natmosphere. With a wavelength-dependent cross section that spans more than 5\norders of magnitude, we use the absorption signature of the NaI doublet as an\natmospheric probe. The NaI transmission features are shown to sample the\natmosphere of HD209458b over an altitude range of more than 6500km,\ncorresponding to a pressure range of 14 scale heights spanning 1 millibar to\n1e-9 bar pressures. By comparing the observations with a multi-layer model in\nwhich temperature is a free parameter at the resolution of the atmospheric\nscale height, we constrain the temperature vertical profile and variations in\nthe Na abundance in the upper part of the atmosphere of HD209458b. We find a\nrise in temperature above the drop in sodium abundance at the 3mbar level.

In a recent study, Clark and\ncollaborators showed that this picture requires revision. They demonstrated\nthat the accretion disks that build up around Population III stars are strongly\nsusceptible to fragmentation and that the first stars should therefore form in\nclusters rather than in isolation. We here use a series of high-resolution\nhydrodynamical simulations performed with the moving mesh code AREPO to follow\nup on this proposal and to study the influence of environmental parameters on\nthe level of fragmentation. We model the collapse of five independent minihalos\nfrom cosmological initial conditions, through the runaway condensation of their\ncentral gas clouds, to the formation of the first protostar, and beyond for a\nfurther 1000 years.

This dynamical configuration likely resulted from\nresonance capture as Neptune migrated outward during the late stages of planet\nformation. The details of Neptune's planetesimal-driven migration, including\nits radial extent and the concurrent eccentricity evolution of the planet, are\nthe subject of considerable debate. Two qualitatively different proposals for\nresonance capture have been proposed--migration-induced capture driven by\nsmooth outward evolution of Neptune's orbit and chaotic capture driven by\ndamping of the planet's eccentricity near its current semi-major axis. We\ndemonstrate that the distribution of comparable-mass, wide-separation binaries\noccupying resonant orbits can differentiate between these two scenarios. If\nmigration-induced capture occurred, this fraction records information about the\nformation locations of different populations of KBOs. Chaotic capture, in\ncontrast, randomizes the orbits of bodies as they are placed in resonance. In\nparticular, migration-induced capture produces the following signatures.

The radial distributions of galaxies in the four systems are\nconsistent with NFW profiles with a galaxy concentration of 3 to 6.

While this theory is general enough to accommodate an arbitrary\nfrequency-dependence of Q, this advantage has not yet been exploited in the\nliterature, where Q is assumed constant or is set to scale as inverse tidal\nfrequency, the latter assertion making the Darwin torque equivalent to a\ncorrected version of the MacDonald torque.\n  However neither a constant nor an inverse-frequency Q reflect the properties\nof realistic mantles and crusts, because the actual frequency-dependence is\nmore complex.

Angular momentum conservation during the\ncollapse results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force, which\neventually halts the inflow of material and leads to the development of a\ncentral mass surrounded by a disc. In the presence of an angular momentum\ntransport mechanism, mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through\nthis disc, and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of\ntheir mass. However, the mechanisms responsible for this transport of angular\nmomentum are not well understood. Although the gravitational field of a\ncompanion star or even gravitational instabilities (particularly in massive\ndiscs) may play a role, the most general mechanisms are turbulence viscosity\ndriven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and outflows accelerated\ncentrifugally from the surfaces of the disc.

Using the dual-band approximation, we assume that stellar\nirradiation and thermal emission from the hot Jupiter occur at distinct\nwavelengths (\"shortwave\" versus \"longwave\"). For a purely absorbing cloud/haze,\nwe demonstrate its dual effect of cooling and warming the upper and lower\natmosphere, respectively, which modifies, in a non-trivial manner, the\ncondition for whether a temperature inversion is present in the upper\natmosphere. The warming effect becomes more pronounced as the cloud/haze deck\nresides at greater depths. If it sits below the shortwave photosphere, the\nwarming effect becomes either more subdued or ceases altogether. If shortwave\nscattering is present, its dual effect is to warm and cool the upper and lower\natmosphere, respectively, thus counteracting the effects of enhanced longwave\nabsorption by the cloud/haze. We make a tentative comparison of a 4-parameter\nmodel to the temperature-pressure data points inferred from the observations of\nHD 189733b and estimate that its Bond albedo is approximately 10%.

Abstract: The prospect of detecting the first galaxies by observing their impact on the\nintergalactic medium as they reionized it during the first billion years leads\nus to ask whether such indirect observations are capable of diagnosing which\ntypes of galaxies were most responsible for reionization. We attempt to answer\nthis by considering a set of large-scale radiative transfer simulations of\nreionization in sufficiently large volumes to make statistically meaningful\npredictions of observable signatures, while also directly resolving all\natomically-cooling halos down to 10^8 M_solar. We focus here on predictions of\nthe 21-cm background, to see if upcoming observations are capable of\ndistinguishing a universe ionized primarily by high-mass halos from one in\nwhich both high-mass and low-mass halos are responsible, and to see how these\nresults depend upon the uncertain source efficiencies. We find that 21-cm\nfluctuation power spectra observed by the first generation EoR/21-cm radio\ninterferometer arrays should be able to distinguish the case of reionization by\nhigh-mass halos alone from that by both high- and low-mass halos, together.\nSome reionization scenarios yield very similar power spectra and rms evolution\nand thus can only be discriminated by their different mean reionization history\nand 21-cm PDF distributions. We find that the skewness of the 21-cm PDF\ndistribution smoothed over LOFAR-like window shows a clear feature correlated\nwith the rise of the rms due to patchiness. Measurements of the mean\nphotoionization rates are sensitive to the average density of the regions being\nstudied and therefore could be strongly skewed in certain cases. (abridged) \n\n"}

Aims: To search, using Very Large Array observations of this\nsource, radio knots and if detected, compare them with the optical and X-ray\nknots. To model the emission from the radio knots. Methods: We analyzed archive\ndata and also obtained new Very Large Array observations of this source, as\nwell as an optical image, to measure the present position of the knots. We also\nmodeled the radio emission from the knots in terms of shocks in a jet with\nintrinsically time-dependent ejection velocities.

However, there is great uncertainty in how efficiently\nradiation couples to matter in these high optical depth environments. In\nparticular, it is unclear what levels of turbulence the radiation can produce,\nand whether the infrared radiation trapped by the dust opacity can give rise to\nheavily mass-loaded winds. In this paper we report a series of two-dimensional\nflux-limited diffusion radiation-hydrodynamics calculations performed with the\ncode ORION in which we drive strong radiation fluxes through columns of dusty\nmatter confined by gravity. We consider both systems where the radiation flux\nis sub-Eddington throughout the gas column, and where it is super-Eddington at\nthe midplane but sub-Eddington in the atmosphere. In the latter, we find that\nthe radiation-matter interaction gives rise to radiation-driven Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability, which drives supersonic turbulence at a level sufficient to fully\nexplain the turbulence seen in Galactic protocluster gas clouds, and to make a\nnon-trivial contribution to the turbulence observed in starburst galaxy disks.\nHowever, the instability also produces a channel structure in which the\nradiation-matter interaction is reduced because the radiation field is not\nfully trapped.

Abstract: The oxygen absorption line imprinted in the scattered light from the\nEarth-like planets has been considered the most promising metabolic biomarker\nof the exo-life. We examine the feasibility of the detection of the 1.27 micron\noxygen band from habitable exoplanets, in particular, around late- type stars\nobserved with a future instrument on a 30 m class ground-based telescope. We\nanalyzed the night airglow around 1.27 micron with IRCS/echelle spectrometer on\nSubaru and found that the strong telluric emission from atmospheric oxygen\nmolecules declines by an order of magnitude by midnight. By compiling nearby\nstar catalogs combined with the sky background model, we estimate the\ndetectability of the oxygen absorption band from an Earth twin, if it exists,\naround nearby stars. We find that the most dominant source of photon noise for\nthe oxygen 1.27 micron band detection comes from the night airglow if the\ncontribution of the stellar PSF halo is suppressed enough to detect the planet.\nWe conclude that the future detectors for which the detection contrast is\nlimited by photon noise can detect the oxygen 1.27 micron absorption band of\nthe Earth twins for ~50 candidates of the late type star.

A\nrange of frequencies higher than this equilibrium rotation frequency can\nnaturally arise if the accretion flow is channeled by higher multipoles of the\nstar's magnetic field. The higher multipole components of the magnetic field\nwill balance the material stresses of the accretion flow at radii closer to the\nstar. The Kepler frequencies associated with these generalized Alfven radii\nincrease with the order of the multipole. Other frequency bands, like the\nepicyclic frequencies associated with the accretion flow, may in turn be higher\nthan the Kepler frequencies.

Our main\nresult is the determination of the thermal inertia of 5 NEAs, increasing the\ntotal number of NEAs with measured thermal inertia to 6. For two of our\ntargets, previously available estimates are refined. Our results allow the\nfirst determination of the typical thermal inertia of NEAs, which is around 300\nJ s^{-1/2} K^{-1} m^{-2}, larger than the typical thermal inertia of large\nmain-belt asteroids (MBAs) by more than an order of magnitude.

Many explanations in terms of dark matter particle\npairs annihilating to gamma gamma and gamma Z have been suggested, but these\ntypically require very large couplings or mysterious coincidences in the masses\nof several new particles to fit the signal strength. We propose a simple novel\nexplanation in which dark matter is part of a multiplet of new states which all\nhave mass near 260 GeV as a result of symmetry. Two dark matter particles\nannihilate to a pair of neutral particles in this multiplet which subsequently\ndecay to gamma gamma and gamma Z. For example, one may have a triplet of\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons, charged pions and a neutral pion, where the\ncharged pions are stabilized by their charge under a new U(1) symmetry and the\nslightly lighter neutral pion state decays to gamma gamma and gamma Z.

We resolve this long-standing problem and find that\nHe in the GRB's host HII region is responsible for most of the absorption. We\nshow that the X-ray absorbing column density (N_Hx) is correlated with both the\nneutral gas column density and with the optical afterglow extinction (Av). This\ncorrelation explains the connection between dark bursts and bursts with high\nN_Hx values. From these correlations we exclude an origin of the X-ray\nabsorption which is not related to the host galaxy, i.e. the intergalactic\nmedium or intervening absorbers are not responsible. We find that the\ncorrelation with the dust column has a strong redshift evolution, whereas the\ncorrelation with the neutral gas does not. From this we conclude that the\ncolumn density of the X-ray absorption is correlated with the total gas column\ndensity in the host galaxy rather than the metal column density, in spite of\nthe fact that X-ray absorption is typically dominated by metals. The strong\nredshift evolution of N_Hx/Av is thus a reflection of the cosmic metallicity\nevolution of star-forming galaxies. We conclude that the absorption of X-rays\nin GRB afterglows is caused by He in the HII region hosting the GRB. While dust\nis destroyed and metals are stripped of all of their electrons by the GRB to\ngreat distances, the abundance of He saturates the He-ionising UV continuum\nmuch closer to the GRB, allowing it to remain in the neutral or singly-ionised\nstate.

We explore gravitational interactions with\na distant planetary companion as a possible cause of these non-zero\neccentricities. For simplicity, we focus on the evolution of a planar\ntwo-planet system subject to slow eccentricity damping and provide an intuitive\ninterpretation of the resulting long-term orbital evolution. We show that\ndissipation shifts the two normal eigenmode frequencies and eccentricity ratios\nof the standard secular theory slightly, and that each mode decays at its own\nrate. Tidal damping of the eccentricities drives orbits to transition between\nperiods of pericenter circulation and libration, and the planetary system\nsettles into a locked state where the pericenters are nearly aligned or\nanti-aligned. Once in the locked state, the eccentricities of the two orbits\ndecrease very slowly due to tides rather than at the much more rapid\nsingle-planet rate, and thus eccentric orbits, even for close-in planets, can\noften survive much longer than the age of the system.

From the asteroseismic\nanalysis we find that each host has its rotation axis nearly perpendicular to\nthe line of sight with the sines of the angles constrained at the 1-sigma level\nto lie above 0.97 and 0.91, respectively. We use statistical arguments to show\nthat coplanar orbits are favoured in both systems, and that the orientations of\nthe planetary orbits and the stellar rotation axis are correlated. \n\n"}

In both cases the host stars are well-aligned with\nthe orbital planes of the planets. For KOI-94 we find \\lambda=-11+-11 deg,\nconfirming a recent result by Hirano and coworkers. Kepler-25 was a more\nchallenging case because the transit depth is unusually small (0.13 %). To\nobtain the obliquity it was necessary to use prior knowledge of the star's\nprojected rotation rate, and apply two different analysis methods to\nindependent wavelength regions of the spectra. The two methods gave consistent\nresults, \\lambda=7+-8 deg and -0.5+-5.7 deg.\n  There are now a total of five obliquity measurements for host stars of\nsystems of multiple transiting planets, all of which are consistent with\nspin-orbit alignment. This alignment is unlikely to be the result of tidal\ninteractions, because of the relatively large orbital distances and low\nplanetary masses in the systems. In this respect the multiplanet host stars\ndiffer from hot-Jupiter host stars, which commonly have large spin-orbit\nmisalignments whenever tidal interactions are weak. In particular the weak-tide\nsubset of hot-Jupiter hosts have obliquities consistent with an isotropic\ndistribution (p=0.6), but the multiplanet hosts are incompatible with such a\ndistribution (p~10^-6). This suggests that high obliquities are confined to\nhot-Jupiter systems, and provides further evidence that hot Jupiter formation\ninvolves processes that tilt the planetary orbit. \n\n"}

This correlation has been disputed by various authors, and\nour aim is to assess whether it is an intrinsic GRB property or the consequence\nof selection effects. We constructed a sample of Fermi GRBs with homogeneous\nselection criteria, and we studied their distribution in the Epi-Eiso plane.\nOur sample is made of 43 GRBs with a redshift and 243 GRBs without a redshift.\nWe show that GRBs with a redshift follow a broad Epi-Eiso relation, while GRBs\nwithout a redshift show several outliers. We use these samples to discuss the\nimpact of selection effects associated with GRB detection and with redshift\nmeasurement. We find that the Epi-Eiso relation is partly due to intrinsic GRB\nproperties and partly due to selection effects. The lower right boundary of the\nEpi-Eiso relation stems from a true lack of luminous GRBs with low Epi. In\ncontrast, the upper left boundary is attributed to selection effects acting\nagainst the detection GRBs with low Eiso and large Epi that appear to have a\nlower signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we demonstrate that GRBs with and\nwithout a redshift follow different distributions in the Epi-Eiso plane. GRBs\nwith a redshift are concentrated near the lower right boundary of the Epi-Eiso\nrelation. This suggests that it is easier to measure the redshift of GRBs close\nto the lower Epi-Eiso boundary. In this context, we attribute the controversy\nabout the reality of the Amati relation to the complex nature of this relation\nresulting from the combination of a true physical boundary and biases favoring\nthe detection and the measurement of the redshift of GRBs located close to this\nboundary. \n\n"}

While the number density of stars in the simulated inner-halo\npopulations decreases rapidly with distance, the outer-halo populations\ncontribute about 20-40 per cent in the fiducial solar neighborhood, in\nparticular at the lowest metallicities.

Abstract: Several gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) last much longer (~hours) in gamma-rays than\ntypical long GRBs (~ minutes), and recently it was proposed that these\n\"ultra-long GRBs\" may form a distinct population, probably with a different\n(e.g. blue supergiant) progenitor than typical GRBs. However, Swift\nobservations suggest that many GRBs have extended central engine activities\nmanifested as flares and internal plateaus in X-rays. We perform a\ncomprehensive study on a large sample of Swift GRBs with XRT observations to\ninvestigate GRB central engine activity duration and to determine whether\nultra-long GRBs are unusual events. We define burst duration t_burst based on\nboth gamma-ray and X-ray light curves rather than using gamma-ray observations\nalone. We find that t_burst can be reliably measured in 343 GRBs. Within this\n\"good\" sample, 21.9% GRBs have t_burst >=10^3 s and 11.5% GRBs have t_burst\n>=10^4 s. There is an apparent bimodal distribution of t_burst in this sample.\nHowever, when we consider an \"undetermined\" sample (304 GRBs) with t_burst\npossibly falling in the gap between GRB duration T_90 and the first X-ray\nobservational time, as well as a selection effect against t_burst falling into\nthe first Swift orbital \"dead zone\" due to observation constraints, the\nintrinsic underlying t_burst distribution is consistent with being a single\ncomponent distribution. We found that the existing evidence for a separate\nultra-long GRB population is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength\nobservations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion. We also discuss the\ntheoretical implications of our results. In particular, the central engine\nactivity duration of GRBs is generally much longer than the gamma-ray T90\nduration and it does not even correlate with T90. It would be premature to make\na direct connection between T90 and the size of the progenitor star. \n\n"}

These discoveries motivate the hypothesis that the IMF may\nvary (possibly very slightly) across galaxies and across components of\nindividual galaxies (e.g. bulges vs discs). In this paper we use a sample of 19\nlate-type strong gravitational lenses from the SWELLS survey to investigate the\nIMFs of the bulges and discs in late-type galaxies. We perform a joint analysis\nof the galaxies' total masses (constrained by strong gravitational lensing) and\nstellar masses (constrained by optical and near-infrared colours in the context\nof a stellar population synthesis [SPS] model, up to an IMF normalisation\nparameter).

The gravitational torque\non the disc from an inclined binary makes the disc precess around the binary\naxis, while the star-disc interaction torque due to the rotation-induced\nquadrupole makes the stellar spin and the disc angular momentum axes precess\naround each other. A significant star-disc misalignment angle can be generated\nfrom a small initial value as the star-disc system evolves in time such that\nthe two precession frequencies cross each other. This ``secular resonance''\nbehavior can be understood in a geometric way from the precession dynamics of\nspin and disc angular momenta. We derive the conditions for such resonance to\noccur, and find that they can be satisfied for reasonable protostar-disc-binary\nparameters. The evolution of star-disc inclination is also affected by mass\naccretion and by magnetic star-disc interaction torques, which can either\npromote or reduce star-disc misalignment. In general, as long as the initial\nbinary-disc inclination is greater than a few degrees, a variety of star-disc\nmisalignment angles can be generated within the disc lifetimes.

In this context, we detail the reasons why measurements of\nSaturn's bulk elemental and isotopic composition would place important\nconstraints on the volatile reservoirs in the protosolar nebula. We also show\nthat the in situ measurement of CO (or any other disequilibrium species that is\ndepleted by reaction with water) in Saturn's upper troposphere would constrain\nits bulk O/H ratio. We highlight the key measurements required to distinguish\ncompeting theories to shed light on giant planet formation as a common process\nin planetary systems with potential applications to most extrasolar systems. In\nsitu measurements of Saturn's stratospheric and tropospheric dynamics,\nchemistry and cloud-forming processes will provide access to phenomena\nunreachable to remote sensing studies. Different mission architectures are\nenvisaged, which would benefit from strong international collaborations. \n\n"}
{"id": "1404.6940", "contents": "Title: The compressional beta effect: a source of zonal winds in planets? Abstract: Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn feature strong zonal wind patterns on\ntheir surfaces. Although several different mechanisms that may drive these jets\nhave been proposed over the last decades, the origin of the zonal winds is\nstill unclear. Here, we explore the possibility that the interplay of planetary\nrotation with the compression and expansion of the convecting fluid can drive\nmultiple deep zonal jets by a compressional Rhines-type mechanism, as\noriginally proposed by Ingersoll and Pollard (1982). In a certain limit, this\ndeep mechanism is shown to be mathematically analogous to the classical Rhines\nmechanism possibly operating at cloud level. Jets are predicted to occur on a\ncompressional Rhines length $l_R = (2 \\Omega \\langle H_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle\nv_{jet}^{-1} )^{-1/2}$, where $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity, $\\langle\nH_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle$ is the mean inverse density scale height and $v_{jet}$ is\nthe typical jet velocity. Two-dimensional numerical simulations using the\nanelastic approximation reveal that this mechanism robustly generates jets of\nthe predicted width, and that it typically dominates the dynamics in systems\ndeeper than $O(l_R)$. Potential vorticity staircases are observed to form\nspontaneously and are typically accompanied by unstably stratified buoyancy\nstaircases. The mechanism only operates at large rotation rates, exceeding\nthose typically reached in three-dimensional simulations of deep convection in\nspherical shells. Applied to Jupiter and Saturn, the compressional Rhines\nscaling reasonably fits the available observations. Interestingly, even weak\nvertical density variations such as those in the Earth core can give rise to a\nlarge number of jets, leading to fundamentally different flow structures than\npredicted by the Boussinesq models typically used in this context. \n\n"}

Here, we turn to\nthe quintessential hazy world -- Titan -- to clarify how high altitude hazes\ninfluence transit spectra. We use solar occultation observations of Titan's\natmosphere from the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) aboard\nNASA's Cassini spacecraft to generate transit spectra. Data span 0.88-5 microns\nat a resolution of 12-18 nm, with uncertainties typically smaller than 1%. Our\napproach exploits symmetry between occultations and transits, producing transit\nradius spectra that inherently include the effects of haze multiple scattering,\nrefraction, and gas absorption. We use a simple model of haze extinction to\nexplore how Titan's haze affects its transit spectrum. Our spectra show strong\nmethane absorption features, and weaker features due to other gases. Most\nimportantly, the data demonstrate that high altitude hazes can severely limit\nthe atmospheric depths probed by transit spectra, bounding observations to\npressures smaller than 0.1-10 mbar, depending on wavelength. Unlike the usual\nassumption made when modeling and interpreting transit observations of\npotentially hazy worlds, the slope set by haze in our spectra is not flat, and\ncreates a variation in transit height whose magnitude is comparable to those\nfrom the strongest gaseous absorption features.

Turbulence can bring ice-coated\ndust grains from the midplane to the warm irradiated disk surface, and the ice\nmantles are reprocessed by photoreactions, thermal desorption, and surface\nreactions. The upward transport decreases the abundance of methanol and ammonia\nices at r < 30 AU, because warm dust temperature prohibits their reformation on\ngrain surfaces. This reprocessing could explain the smaller abundances of\ncarbon and nitrogen bearing molecules in cometary coma than those in low-mass\nprotostellar envelopes. We also show the effect of mixing on the synthesis of\ncomplex organic molecules (COMs) are two ways: (1) transport of ices from the\nmidplane to the disk surface and (2) transport of atomic hydrogen from the\nsurface to the midplane. The former enhances the COMs formation in the disk\nsurface, while the latter suppresses it in the midplane. Then, when mixing is\nstrong, COMs are predominantly formed in the disk surface, while their parent\nmolecules are (re)formed in the midplane. This cycle expands the COMs\ndistribution both vertically and radially outward compared with that in the\nnon-turbulent model.

We investigate the grain opacity k_gr in the atmosphere of\nprotoplanets. This is important for the planetary mass-radius relation since\nk_gr affects the H/He envelope mass of low-mass planets and the critical core\nmass of giant planets. Aims. The goal of this study is to derive an analytical\nmodel for k_gr. Methods. Our model is based on the comparison of the timescales\nof microphysical processes like grain settling in the Stokes and Epstein\nregime, growth by Brownian motion coagulation and differential settling, grain\nevaporation, and grain advection due to envelope contraction. With these\ntimescales we derive the grain size, abundance, and opacity. Results. We find\nthat the main growth process is differential settling. In this regime, k_gr has\na simple functional form and is given as 27 Q/8 H rho in the Epstein regime and\nas 2 Q/H rho for Stokes drag. Grain dynamics lead to a typical radial structure\nof k_gr with high ISM-like values in the top layers but a strong decrease in\nthe deeper parts where the grain-free molecular opacities take over.\nConclusions. In agreement with earlier results we find that k_gr is typically\nmuch lower than in the ISM. The equations also show that a higher dust input in\nthe top layer does not strongly increase k_gr with two important implications.\nFirst, for a formation of giant planet cores via pebbles, there could be the\nissue that pebbles increase the grain input high in the atmosphere due to\nablation. This could potentially increase k_gr hindering giant planet\nformation. Our study shows that this adverse effect should not occur. Second,\nit means that a higher stellar [Fe/H] which presumably leads to a higher\nsurface density of planetesimals only favors giant planet formation without\nbeing detrimental to it due to an increased k_gr. This corroborates the result\nthat core accretion explains the increase of the giant planet frequency with\n[Fe/H]. \n\n"}

While the majority of the target stars\nare main-sequence dwarfs of spectral type F, G, and K, Kepler covers stars with\neffective temperature as low as 2500 K, which corresponds to M stars. These\ncooler stars allow characterization of small planets near the habitable zone,\nyet it is not clear if this population is representative of that around FGK\nstars. In this paper, we calculate the occurrence of planets around stars of\ndifferent spectral types as a function of planet radius and distance from the\nstar, and show that they are significantly different from each other. We\nfurther identify two trends: First, the occurrence of Earth to Neptune-sized\nplanets is successively higher toward later spectral types at all orbital\nperiods probed by Kepler; Planets around M stars occur twice as frequently as\naround G stars, and thrice as frequently as around F stars. Second, a drop in\nplanet occurrence is evident at all spectral types inward of a 10 day orbital\nperiod, with a plateau further out. By assigning to each spectral type a median\nstellar mass, we show that the distance from the star where this drop occurs is\nstellar mass dependent, and scales with semi-major axis as the cube root of\nstellar mass. By comparing different mechanisms of planet formation, trapping\nand destruction, we find that this scaling best matches the location of the\npre-main-sequence co-rotation radius, indicating efficient trapping of\nmigrating planets or planetary building blocks. These results demonstrate the\nstellar-mass dependence of the planet population, both in terms of occurrence\nrate and of orbital distribution.

In this review, we discuss the latest constraints obtained from\nstudies of present-day GC populations, the formation of young massive clusters\n(YMCs) in the local Universe, and the observed, large-scale conditions for star\nand cluster formation in high-redshift galaxies. The main conclusion is that\nthe formation of massive, GC progenitor clusters is restricted to high-pressure\nenvironments similar to those observed at high redshift and at the sites of YMC\nformation in the local Universe. However, the correspondingly high gas\ndensities also lead to efficient cluster disruption by impulsive tidal shocks,\nwhich limits the survival of GCs progenitor clusters.

Additionally, the data indicate a strong population\nof stars around 4 Gyr, followed by a second rapid enrichment in [Fe/H]. A\nleaky-box chemical enrichment model generally matches the observed relation but\ndoes not predict a significant population of young stars nor the strong\nenrichment at late times. The young population in Fornax may therefore\noriginate from an externally triggered SF event. Our dynamical analysis reveals\nan increasing velocity dispersion with decreasing [Fe/H] from sigma_sys 7.5\nkm/s to >14 km/s, indicating an outside-in star formation history in a dark\nmatter dominated halo. The large velocity dispersion at low metallicities is\npossibly the result of a non-Gaussian velocity distribution amongst stars older\nthan ~8 Gyr. Our sample also includes members from the Fornax GCs H2 and H5. In\nagreement with past studies we find [Fe/H]=-2.04+-0.04 and a mean radial\nvelocity RV=59.36+-0.31 km/s for H2 and [Fe/H]=-2.02+-0.11 and RV=59.39+-0.44\nkm/s for H5.

We hypothesize that the\nin-situ breakup of small bodies such as asteroids spun to fission during the\ngiant branch phases of stellar evolution provides an important contribution to\nthis debris. The YORP effect, which arises from radiation pressure, accelerates\nthe spin rate of asymmetric asteroids, which can eventually shear themselves\napart. This pressure is maintained and enhanced around dying stars because the\noutward push of an asteroid due to stellar mass loss is insignificant compared\nto the resulting stellar luminosity increase. Consequently, giant star\nradiation will destroy nearly all bodies with radii in the range 100 m - 10 km\nthat survive their parent star's main sequence lifetime within a distance of\nabout 7 au; smaller bodies are spun apart to their strongest, competent\ncomponents.

The historical evolution of the pulse phase\naveraged CRSF centroid energy Ecyc since its discovery in 1976 is characterized\nby an initial value around 35 keV, an abrupt jump upwards to beyond about 40\nkeV between 1990 and 1994, and an apparent decay thereafter.

One of the most commonly used ways to remove the dust foreground\nis to extrapolate the polarized dust emission signal from frequencies where it\ndominates (e.g., ~ 350 GHz) to frequencies commonly targeted by cosmic\nmicrowave background experiments (e.g., ~150 GHz).

Abstract: Context: The 440 Myr old main-sequence A-star Fomalhaut is surrounded by an\neccentric debris belt with sharp edges. This sort of a morphology is usually\nattributed to planetary perturbations, but the orbit of the only planetary\ncandidate detected so far, Fomalhaut b, is too eccentric to efficiently shape\nthe belt. Alternative models that could account for the morphology without\ninvoking a planet are stellar encounters and gas-dust interactions.\n  Aims: We aim to test the possibility of gas-dust interactions as the origin\nof the observed morphology by putting upper limits on the total gas content of\nthe Fomalhaut belt.\n  Methods: We derive upper limits on the CII 158 $\\mu$m and OI 63 $\\mu$m\nemission by using non-detections from the Photodetector Array Camera and\nSpectrometer (PACS) onboard the Herschel Space Observatory.

Accordingly, the accretion rates onto\nthese objects are also higher than expected from the $\\dot{M}_*-M_*$ relation.\nMoreover there is no significant correlation between the mass of the brown\ndwarf or planet with the mass of its disc nor with the accretion rate from the\ndisc onto it. The discs around objects that form by disc fragmentation have\nlarger than expected masses as they accrete gas from the disc of their parent\nstar during the first few kyr after they form. The amount of gas that they\naccrete and therefore their mass depend on how they move in their parent disc\nand how they interact with it. Observations of disc masses and accretion rates\nonto very low-mass objects are consistent with the predictions of the disc\nfragmentation model. Future observations (e.g. by ALMA) of disc masses and\naccretion rates onto substellar objects that have even lower masses (young\nplanets and young, low-mass brown dwarfs), where the scaling relations\npredicted by the disc fragmentation model diverge significantly from the\ncorresponding relations established for higher-mass stars, will test the\npredictions of this model. \n\n"}

The flat optical and UV continua are mainly\nemitted from a circumbinary disk and a mini-disk around the secondary black\nhole (BH), respectively; and the observed sharp drop off and flux deficit at\nwavelength lambda ~ 4000-2500 Angstrom is due to a gap (or hole) opened by the\nsecondary BH migrating within the circumbinary disk. If confirmed by future\nobservations, this BBH will provide a unique laboratory to study the interplay\nbetween BBHs and accretion flows onto them. Our result also demonstrates a new\nmethod to find sub-parsec scale BBHs by searching for deficits in the\noptical-to-UV continuum among the spectra of quasars. \n\n"}

This project involved writing new algorithms to\nanalyze Kepler data, finding planets, and conducting follow-up work using\nground-based telescopes. I found that most stars have at least one planet at or\nwithin Earth's orbit and that 26% of Sun-like stars have an Earth-size planet\nwith an orbital period of 100 days or less.\n  The second topic is the connection between the properties of planets and\ntheir host stars.

They pose a great challenge for planet formation\ntheories, which fall into two broad classes: (1) formation further out followed\nby inward migration; (2) formation in situ, in the very inner regions of the\nprotoplanetary disk. We review the pros and cons of these classes, before\nfocusing on a new theory of sequential in situ formation from the inside-out\nvia creation of successive gravitationally unstable rings fed from a continuous\nstream of small (~cm-m size) \"pebbles,\" drifting inward via gas drag. Pebbles\nfirst collect at the pressure trap associated with the transition from a\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI)-inactive (\"dead zone\") region to an inner,\nMRI-active zone. A pebble ring builds up that begins to dominate the local mass\nsurface density of the disk and spawns a planet. The planet continues to grow,\nmost likely by pebble accretion, until it becomes massive enough to isolate\nitself from the accretion flow via gap opening. This reduces the local gas\ndensity near the planet, leading to enhanced ionization and a retreat of the\ndead zone inner boundary. The process repeats with a new pebble ring gathering\nat the new pressure maximum associated with this boundary.

The shallow disk gaps cannot terminate growth of\ngiant planets. For planets less massive than 10 Jupiter masses, their growth\nrates are mainly controlled by the gas supply through the global disk\naccretion, rather than their gaps. The insufficient gas supply compared with\nthe rapid gas capture causes a depletion of the gas surface density even at the\noutside of the gap, which can create an inner hole in the protoplanetary disk.\nOur model can also predict the depleted gas surface density in the inner hole\nfor a given planet mass. Secondly, our findings are applied to the formation of\nour solar system. For the formation of Jupiter, a very low-mass gas disk with a\nfew or several Jupiter masses is required at the beginning of its gas capture\nbecause of the non-stopping capture. Such a low-mass gas disk with sufficient\nsolid material can be formed through viscous evolution from an initially\n$\\sim$10AU-sized compact disk with the solar composition. By the viscous\nevolution with a moderate viscosity of $\\alpha \\sim 10^{-3}$, most of disk gas\naccretes onto the sun and a widely spread low-mass gas disk remains when the\nsolid core of Jupiter starts gas capture at $t \\sim 10^7$ yrs. The depletion of\nthe disk gas is suitable for explaining the high metallicity in giant planets\nof our solar system. A very low-mass gas disk also provides a plausible path\nwhere type I and II planetary migrations are both suppressed significantly. In\nparticular, we also show that the type II migration of Jupiter-size planets\nbecomes inefficient because of the additional gas depletion due to the rapid\ngas capture by themselves. \n\n"}

Here we present a three-dimensional model\nthat explains this relationship, in order to shed insight on the processes that\ncontrol heat redistribution in tidally-locked planetary atmospheres. This\nthree-dimensional model combines predictive analytic theory for the atmospheric\ncirculation and dayside-nightside temperature differences over a range of\nequilibrium temperature, atmospheric composition, and potential frictional drag\nstrengths with numerical solutions of the circulation that verify this analytic\ntheory. This analytic theory shows that the longitudinal propagation of waves\nmediates dayside-nightside temperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres,\nanalogous to the wave adjustment mechanism that regulates the thermal structure\nin Earth's tropics. These waves can be damped in hot Jupiter atmospheres by\neither radiative cooling or potential frictional drag. This frictional drag\nwould likely be caused by Lorentz forces in a partially ionized atmosphere\nthreaded by a background magnetic field, and would increase in strength with\nincreasing temperature. Additionally, the amplitude of radiative heating and\ncooling increases with increasing temperature, and hence both radiative\nheating/cooling and frictional drag damp waves more efficiently with increasing\nequilibrium temperature. Radiative heating and cooling play the largest role in\ncontrolling dayside-nightside temperature temperature differences in both our\nanalytic theory and numerical simulations, with frictional drag only important\nif it is stronger than the Coriolis force. As a result, dayside-nightside\ntemperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres increase with increasing\nstellar irradiation and decrease with increasing pressure. \n\n"}

Halo occupation distribution\n(HOD) modeling can extend the approach down to nonlinear scales, but galaxy\nassembly bias could introduce systematic errors by causing the HOD to vary with\nlarge scale environment at fixed halo mass. We investigate this problem using\nthe mock galaxy catalogs created by Hearin & Watson (2013, HW13), which exhibit\nsignificant assembly bias because galaxy luminosity is tied to halo peak\ncircular velocity and galaxy colour is tied to halo formation time. The\npreferential placement of galaxies (especially red galaxies) in older halos\naffects the cutoff of the mean occupation function $\\langle\nN_\\text{cen}(M_\\text{min}) \\rangle$ for central galaxies, with halos in\noverdense regions more likely to host galaxies.

A larger abundance of micrometre-sized grains leads to an overall\nheating of the disc, so that the water ice line moves further away from the\nstar. An increase in the water fraction inside the disc, maintaining a fixed\ndust abundance, increases the temperature in the icy regions of the disc and\nlowers the temperature in the inner regions. Discs with a larger silicate\nfraction have the opposite effect. Here we explore the consequence of the dust\ncomposition and abundance for the formation and migration of planets. We find\nthat discs with low water content can only sustain outwards migration for\nplanets up to 4 Earth masses, while outwards migration in discs with a larger\nwater content persists up to 8 Earth masses in the late stages of the disc\nevolution. Icy planetary cores that do not reach run-away gas accretion can\nthus migrate to orbits close to the host star if the water abundance is low.\nOur results imply that hot and warm super-Earths found in exoplanet surveys\ncould have formed beyond the ice line and thus contain a significant fraction\nin water. These water-rich super-Earths should orbit primarily around stars\nwith a low oxygen abundance, where a low oxygen abundance is caused by either a\nlow water-to-silicate ratio or by overall low metallicity. \n\n"}

It is widely believed that these planets formed near the\nwater-ice line of the protoplanetary disk, and subsequently migrated into much\nsmaller orbits. Most of the proposed migration mechanisms can be classified\neither as disk-driven migration, or as excitation of a very high eccentricity\nfollowed by tidal circularization. In the latter scenario, the giant planet\nthat is destined to become a hot Jupiter spends billions of years on a\nhighly-eccentric orbit, with apastron near the water-ice line. Eventually,\ntidal dissipation at periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbit. If this is\ncorrect, then it should be especially rare for hot Jupiters to be accompanied\nby another giant planet interior to the water-ice line. Using the current\nsample of giant planets discovered with the Doppler technique, we find that hot\nJupiters with P_orb < 10 days are no more or less likely to have exterior\nJupiter-mass companions than longer-period giant planets with P_orb >= 10 days.\nThis result holds for exterior companions both inside and outside of the\napproximate location of the water-ice line.

While the CO lasts less than one orbit, the\natomic gas evolves by viscous spreading resulting in an accretion disc inside\nthe parent belt and a decretion disc outside. The temperature, ionisation\nfraction and population levels of carbon and oxygen are followed with the\nphotodissociation region model Cloudy, which is coupled to a dynamical viscous\n$\\alpha$ model.

Meanwhile, recent\nhydrodynamical simulations have indicated that the accretion-induced collapse\nmay be avoided under certain conditions when double WDs merge violently.\nHowever, the properties of SNe Ia from this violent merger scenario are highly\ndependent on a particular mass-accretion stage, the so-called WD + He subgiant\nchannel, during which the primary WD is able to increase its mass by accreting\nHe-rich material from a He subgiant before the systems evolves into a double WD\nsystem. In this article, we aim to study this particular evolutionary stage\nsystematically and give the properties of violent WD mergers. By employing the\nEggleton stellar evolution code, we followed a large number of binary\ncalculations and obtained the regions in parameter space for producing violent\nmergers based on the WD + He subgiant channel. According to these simulations,\nwe found that the primary WDs can increase their mass by ~0.10-0.45 Msun during\nthe mass-accretion stage. We then conducted a series of binary population\nsynthesis calculations and found that the Galactic SN Ia birthrate from this\nchannel is about 0.01-0.4*10-3 yr-1. This suggests that the violent WD mergers\nfrom this channel may only contribute to ~0.3%-10% of all SNe Ia in our Galaxy.\nThe delay times of violent WD mergers from this channel are >1.7 Gyr,\ncontributing to the SNe Ia in old populations.

Theoretical\nmodels predict a positive correlation between heat redistribution efficiency\nand temperature for tidally locked planets; however, recent HST WASP-43b\nspectroscopic phase curve results are inconsistent with current predictions.\nUsing the Spitzer Space Telescope, we obtained a total of three phase curve\nobservations of WASP-43b (P=0.813 days) at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. The first 3.6\nmicron visit exhibits spurious nightside emission that requires invoking\nunphysical conditions in our cloud-free atmospheric retrievals. The two other\nvisits exhibit strong day-night contrasts that are consistent with the HST\ndata. To reconcile the departure from theoretical predictions, WASP-43b would\nneed to have a high-altitude, nightside cloud/haze layer blocking its thermal\nemission. Clouds/hazes could be produced within the planet's cool, nearly\nretrograde mid-latitude flows before dispersing across its nightside at high\naltitudes. Since mid-latitude flows only materialize in fast-rotating\n($\\lesssim1$ day) planets, this may explain an observed trend connecting\nmeasured day-night contrast with planet rotation rate that matches all current\nSpitzer phase curve results.

Moreover, it will be possible\nto probe the O2 bands at 627, 686 and 760 nm, the water vapour band at 717 nm,\nand the methane band at 715 nm. In particular, a 3.6-sigma detection of O2\ncould be made in about 60 nights of telescope time. Those would need to be\nspread over 3 years considering optimal observability conditions for the\nplanet. Conclusions. The very existence of Proxima b and the SPHERE-ESPRESSO\nsynergy represent a unique opportunity to detect biosignatures on an exoplanet\nin the near future. It is also a crucial pathfinder experiment for the\ndevelopment of Extremely Large Telescopes and their instruments (abridged). \n\n"}

Summary of the astrometric, photometric, and survey\n  properties Abstract: At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data\nrelease, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion\nsources brighter than magnitude 20.7. We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide\nillustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion\nof the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1\nconsists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,\nparallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars\nin common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric\ndata set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The\nsecond component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band\nmagnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the\ntypical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas. The median uncertainties on\nthe mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to ~0.03 mag over the\nmagnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping\nof the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin\nobservational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this\nfirst Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the\ndata quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions\nfrom the data. \n\n"}

Kepler planets show an asymmetric\nfeature, namely, there are small but significant deficits/excesses of planet\npairs with orbital period spacing slightly narrow/wide of the exact resonance,\nparticularly near the first order mean motion resonance (MMR), such as 2:1 and\n3:2 MMR. Similarly, if not exactly the same, an asymmetric feature (pileup wide\nof 2:1 MMR) is also seen in RV planets, but only for massive ones. We\nanalytically and numerically study planets' orbital evolutions near and in the\nMMR. We find that their orbital period ratios could be asymmetrically\ndistributed around the MMR center regardless of dissipation. In the case of no\ndissipation, Kepler planets' asymmetric orbital distribution could be partly\nreproduced for 3:2 MMR but not for 2:1 MMR, implying that dissipation might be\nmore important to the latter.

Albeit\nlight-curves from CoRoT have typically lower precision and shorter coverage,\nCoRoT's number of targets is similar to Kepler, and some of the known\ncircumbinary planets could potentially be detected in CoRoT data as well. The\naim of this work has been a revision of the entire CoRoT data-set for the\npresence of circumbinary planets, and the derivation of limits to the\nabundances of such planets. We developed a code which removes the light curve\nof the eclipsing binaries and searches for quasi-periodic transit-like features\nin a light curve after removal of binary eclipses and instrumental features.\nThe code needs little information on the sample systems and can be used for\nother space missions as well, like Kepler, K2, TESS and PLATO.

One of the proposed\nmigration scenarios is secular high-eccentricity or high-$e$ migration, in\nwhich the orbit of the planet is perturbed to high eccentricity by secular\nprocesses, triggering strong tidal evolution and orbital migration. Previous\ntheoretical studies have considered secular excitation in stellar binaries.\nRecently, a number of HJs have been observed in stellar triple systems. In the\nlatter, the secular dynamics are much richer compared to stellar binaries, and\nHJs could potentially be formed more efficiently.

While the former\nprocess has seen recent development, the effects of light multiple scattering\non exoplanet transit spectra has received little attention.

We therefore address the general behavior of\nhydrodynamic thermal escape models ranging from Pluto to highly-irradiated\nExtrasolar Giant Planets (EGPs). Energy-limited escape is harder to test\nbecause copious XUV radiation is mostly a feature of young stars, and hence\nrequires extrapolating to historic XUV fluences ($I_{\\mathrm{xuv}}$) using\nproxies and power laws. An energy-limited shoreline should scale as\n$I_{\\mathrm{xuv}} \\propto v_{\\mathrm{esc}}^3\\sqrt{\\rho}$, which differs\ndistinctly from the apparent $I_{\\mathrm{xuv}} \\propto v_{\\mathrm{esc}}^4$\nrelation.

Investigating giant planet\n  migration history via improved eccentricity and mass determination for 231\n  transiting planets Abstract: We carried out a Bayesian homogeneous determination of the orbital parameters\nof 231 transiting giant planets (TGPs) that are alone or have distant\ncompanions; we employed DE-MCMC methods to analyse radial-velocity (RV) data\nfrom the literature and 782 new high-accuracy RVs obtained with the HARPS-N\nspectrograph for 45 systems over 3 years. Our work yields the largest sample of\nsystems with a transiting giant exoplanet and coherently determined orbital,\nplanetary, and stellar parameters. We found that the orbital parameters of TGPs\nin non-compact planetary systems are clearly shaped by tides raised by their\nhost stars. Indeed, the most eccentric planets have relatively large orbital\nseparations and/or high mass ratios, as expected from the equilibrium tide\ntheory. This feature would be the outcome of high-eccentricity migration (HEM).\nThe distribution of $\\alpha=a/a_R$, where $a$ and $a_R$ are the semi-major axis\nand the Roche limit, for well-determined circular orbits peaks at 2.5; this\nalso agrees with expectations from the HEM. The few planets of our sample with\ncircular orbits and $\\alpha >5$ values may have migrated through disc-planet\ninteractions instead of HEM. By comparing circularisation times with stellar\nages, we found that hot Jupiters with $a < 0.05$ au have modified tidal quality\nfactors $10^{5} < Q'_p < 10^{9}$, and that stellar $Q'_s > 10^{6}-10^{7}$ are\nrequired to explain the presence of eccentric planets at the same orbital\ndistance.

We used medium-resolution optical\nspectroscopy to assess the objects' accretion status and to measure the Halpha\nline. We found no convincing example of passive disks; only transition disk and\ndebris disk systems in our sample are non-accreting. Among accretors, we find\nno example of flickering accretion, leading to an upper limit of 2.2% on the\nduty cycle of accretion gaps assuming that all accreting TTS experience such\nevents. Combining literature results with our observations, we find that the\nreliability of traditional Halpha-based criteria to test for accretion is high\nbut imperfect, particularly for low-mass TTS. We find a significant correlation\nbetween stellar mass and the full width at 10 per cent of the peak (W10%) of\nthe Halpha line that does not seem to be related to variations in free-fall\nvelocity.

The total time covered by these observations is\napproximately 20 years. We show that this source undergoes X-ray spectral\ntransitions from the low hard state (LHS) through the intermediate state (IS)\nto the high soft state (HSS) during these observations. During the RXTE\nobservations (1997 -- 2001, {180 ks, for a total 145 datasets}), the source was\napproximately 75%, 20% and only 5 of the time in the IS, LHS, and HSS,\nrespectively.

The spectra of BL Lac are well fitted by the bulk\nmotion Comptonization (BMC) model for all spectral states. We have established\nthe photon index saturation level, Gamma_{sat}=2.2+/-0.1, in the Gamma vs. mass\naccretion rate (Mdot) correlation. This Gamma-Mdot correlation allows us to\nestimate the black-hole (BH) mass in BL Lac to be M_{BH}~3x10^7 M_sol for a\ndistance of 300 Mpc. For the BH mass estimate, we use the scaling method taking\nstellar-mass Galactic BHs 4U~1543--47 and GX~339--4 as reference sources.

We compare\nthe results with the predictions of the recently proposed sound shell model.\nFor the gravitational wave power spectrum, we find that the predicted $k^{-3}$\nbehaviour, where $k$ is the wavenumber, emerges clearly for detonations. The\npower spectra from deflagrations show similar features, but exhibit a steeper\nhigh-$k$ decay and an extra feature not accounted for in the model. There are\ntwo independent length scales: the mean bubble separation and the thickness of\nthe sound shell around the expanding bubble of the low temperature phase. It is\nthe sound shell thickness which sets the position of the peak of the power\nspectrum. The low wavenumber behaviour of the velocity power spectrum is\nconsistent with a causal $k^{3}$, except for the thinnest sound shell, where it\nis steeper.

The\ndetectability of H$_2$O absorption features in transmission spectra depends on\nthe abundance of water vapor in the upper part of the atmosphere. We study the\nthree-dimensional distribution of atmospheric H$_2$O for synchronously rotating\nEarth-sized aquaplanets using the general circulation model (GCM) ROCKE-3D, and\nexamine the effects of total incident flux and stellar spectral type. We\nobserve a more gentle increase of the water vapor mixing ratio in response to\nincreased incident flux than one-dimensional models suggest, in qualitative\nagreement with the climate-stabilizing effect of clouds around the substellar\npoint previously observed in GCMs applied to synchronously rotating planets.\nHowever, the water vapor mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere starts to\nincrease while the surface temperature is still moderate. This is explained by\nthe circulation in the upper atmosphere being driven by the radiative heating\ndue to absorption by water vapor and cloud particles, causing efficient\nvertical transport of water vapor. Consistently, the water vapor mixing ratio\nis found to be well-correlated with the near-infrared portion of the incident\nflux.

The specific\naccretion-rate distribution is defined as the probability of a galaxy with a\ngiven stellar mass and redshift hosting an active nucleus with a certain\nspecific accretion rate. We find that the probability of a galaxy hosting an\nAGN increases with decreasing specific accretion rate. There is evidence that\nthis trend reverses at low specific accretion rates, $\\lambda<10^{-4}-10^{-3}$\n(in Eddington units). There is also a break close to the Eddington limit, above\nwhich the probability of an accretion event decreases steeply. The specific\naccretion-rate distribution evolves such that the fraction of AGN among\ngalaxies drops toward lower redshifts. This decrease in the AGN duty cycle is\nresponsible for the strong evolution of the accretion density of the Universe\nfrom redshift $z\\approx1-1.5$ to the present day. Our analysis also suggests\nthat this evolution is accompanied by a decoupling of accretion events onto\nblack holes from the formation of stars in galaxies. There is also evidence\nthat at earlier times the relative probability of high vs low specific\naccretion-rate events among galaxies increases. We argue that this differential\nredshift evolution of the AGN duty cycle with respect to $\\lambda$ produces the\nAGN downsizing trend, whereby luminous sources peak at earlier epochs compared\nto less luminous ones.

The analysis of the observed features provides information on the\nproperties of the inner disk, the accretion columns, and the winds. Both\nsources display composite HI line profiles, with contributions from both\naccreting gas and high-velocity winds. These lines become more symmetric and\nnarrower with increasing upper energy, which may be interpreted in terms of two\ncomponents with different decrements or imputed to self-absorption effects. XZ\nTau shows a relatively high state of activity with respect to literature\nobservations. The variation of the HeI 1.08um line blue-shifted absorption\nsuggests that the inner wind has undergone a dramatic change in its velocity\nstructure, connected with a recent accretion event. DR Tau has a more stable\nwind as its HeI 1.08um absorption is stable in time in spite of strong\nvariability of the emission component. The IR veiling can be interpreted as due\nto blackbody emission at temperatures of 1600K for XZ Tau and 2300K DR Tau,\nwith emitting areas ~30 times larger than the star. For XZ Tau these conditions\nare consistent with emission from the inner rim of the dusty disk, while for DR\nTau the fairly high temperature may suggest an origin from a thick gaseous disk\nwithin the dust sublimation radius. Strong and broad metallic lines, mainly\nfrom CI and FeI, are detected in XZ Tau, similar to those observed in other\nEXor sources during burst phases. DR Tau shows weaker and narrower metallic\nlines, despite its larger accretion luminosity. This suggests that accretion is\nnot the only driver of metallic line excitation. Our observations show the\npotential of wide-band, high-resolution near-IR spectroscopy to simultaneously\nprobe the phenomena that occur in the star-disk interaction region. \n\n"}

Many empirical studies of hot Jupiters have\nimplicitly assumed that the dayside is the hottest hemisphere and the nightside\nis the coldest hemisphere. For a given eclipse depth and phase amplitude, an\norbital lag between a planet's peak brightness and its eclipse---a phase\noffset---implies that planet's nightside emits greater flux. To quantify how\nphase offsets impact the energy budgets of short-period planets, we compile all\ninfrared observations of the nine planets with multi-band eclipse depths and\nphase curves. Accounting for phase offsets shifts planets to lower Bond albedo\nand greater day--night heat transport, usually by $\\lesssim 1\\sigma$.

Moreover, the rapid losses\nof nucleobases to pond seepage during wet periods, and to UV photodissociation\nduring dry periods means that the synthesis of nucleotides and their\npolymerization into RNA occurred in just one to a few wet-dry cycles. Under\nthese conditions, RNA polymers likely appeared prior to 4.17 billion years ago.\n  Significance: There are two competing hypotheses for the site at which an RNA\nworld emerged: hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean and warm little ponds.\nBecause the former lacks wet and dry cycles, which are well known to promote\npolymerization (in this case, of nucleotides into RNA), we construct a\ncomprehensive model for the origin of RNA in the latter sites.

Seven M-dwarfs included in the CARMENES sample had\nbeen observed before with HIRES and HARPS and either were reported to have one\nshort period planetary companion (GJ15A, GJ176, GJ436, GJ536 and GJ1148) or are\nmultiple planetary systems (GJ581 and GJ876).\n  Aims: We aim to report new precise optical radial velocity measurements for\nthese planet hosts and test the overall capabilities of CARMENES.\n  Methods: We combined our CARMENES precise Doppler measurements with those\navailable from HIRES and HARPS and derived new orbital parameters for the\nsystems. Bona-fide single planet systems are fitted with a Keplerian model. The\nmultiple planet systems were analyzed using a self-consistent dynamical model\nand their best fit orbits were tested for long-term stability.\n  Results: We confirm or provide supportive arguments for planets around all\nthe investigated stars except for GJ15A, for which we find that the\npost-discovery HIRES data and our CARMENES data do not show a signal at 11.4\ndays.

However, our synthetic population of isolated\nstars host a significant amount of giant planets even at low metallicity, in\ncontradiction to observations where giant planets are preferably found around\nhigh metallicity stars, indicating that pebble accretion is very efficient in\nthe standard pebble accretion framework. On the other hand, discs around stars\nembedded in cluster environments hardly form any giant planets at low\nmetallicity in agreement with observations, where these changes originate from\nthe increased temperature in the outer parts of the disc, which prolongs the\ncore accretion time-scale of the planet.

With the new data, the O-C diagram of the secondary\npulsation frequency (f2) continues to show two components (parabola and sine\nwave), like in the previous analysis.

Studying the clustering of dark energy, $\n\\Delta_{DE}$, yields positive but small value with maximum of $\n\\Delta_{DE}\\simeq10^{-3} $ at early time due to matter behaviour of the PL,\nwhile for the CPL and FSL cross $ \\Delta_{DE}=0 $ several time which\ndemonstrate void of dark energy with $ \\Delta_{DE}\\simeq-10^{-11} $ in certain\nperiods of the history of dark energy evolution. Among these three models, the\nPL model demonstrate that is more compatible with $ f\\sigma_{8} $ data. We also\ninvestigated a certain geometrical measure, namely the abundance of local\nmaxima as a function of threshold for three DDE models and find that the method\nis potentially capable to discriminate between the models, especially far from\nmean threshold. The contribution of PL and CPL for late ISW are significant\ncompared to cosmological constant and FSL model. The tension in the Hubble\nparameters is almost alleviated in the PL model. \n\n"}

Physically,\nPPDs might be truncated either by photoevaporation due to ultraviolet flux from\nmassive stars, or tidal truncation due to close stellar encounters. Here we aim\nto compare the two effects in real cluster environments. In this vein we first\nreview the properties of well studied stellar clusters with a focus on stellar\nnumber density, which largely dictates the degree of tidal truncation, and far\nultraviolet (FUV) flux, which is indicative of the rate of external\nphotoevaporation. We then review the theoretical PPD truncation radius due to\nan arbitrary encounter, additionally taking into account the role of eccentric\nencounters that play a role in hot clusters with a 1D velocity dispersion\n$\\sigma_v > 2$ km/s. Our treatment is then applied statistically to varying\nlocal environments to establish a canonical threshold for the local stellar\ndensity ($n_{c} > 10^4$ pc$^{-3}$) for which encounters can play a significant\nrole in shaping the distribution of PPD radii over a timescale $\\sim 3$ Myr.

The RV data is modelled\ntogether with the Kepler photometry using a photodynamical model. The inclusion\nof velocity information breaks the $MR^{-3}$ degeneracy inherent in timing data\nalone, allowing us to measure the absolute stellar and planetary radii and\nmasses. With uncertainties of 12% and 13% for the stellar and inner planet\nradii, and 35%, 24%, and 35% for the masses of the star, planet b, and planet c\nrespectively, these measurements are the most precise to date for a single host\nstar system using this technique. The transiting planet mass is determined at\nbetter precision than the star mass. This shows that modelling the radial\nvelocities and the light curve together in systems of dynamically interacting\nplanets provides a way of characterising both the star and the planets without\nbeing limited by knowledge of the star. On the other hand, the period ratio and\neccentricities place the Kepler-419 system in a sweet spot; had around twice as\nmany transits been observed, the mass of the transiting planet could have been\nmeasured using its own TTVs. Finally, the origin of the Kepler-419 system is\ndiscussed.

Abstract: Yes, for a wide range of cosmological models ($\\Lambda$CDM, non-interacting\n$w_z$CDM or models with possible interactions between dark energy and dark\nmatter, in either phantom or non-phantom regimes). In the recent past there\nhave been many attempts to solve the tension between direct measurements of\n$H_0$ and $\\sigma_8 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{0 {\\rm m}}}$ from the respective low redshift\nobservables and indirect measurements of these quantities from the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB).

We test this parameterization against the latest\nPlanck CMB data combined with recent BAO, SNeIa datasets and the R16 direct\n$H_0$ measurements, and compare among different cosmological models. Our\nanalysis reveals that a strong positive correlation between $H_0$ and\n$\\sigma_8$ is more or less generic, irrespective of the choice of cosmological\nmodels. We also find that present data slightly prefers a phantom equation of\nstate for dark energy and a slight negative value for effective equation of\nstate for dark matter (which is a direct signature of interacting models) with\na relatively high value for $H_0$ consistent with R16 and simultaneously, a\nconsistent value for $\\Omega_{0 {\\rm m}}$. Thus, even though the tensions\ncannot be fully resolved, interacting models with phantom equation of state get\na slight edge over the others for currently available data. We also see that\nallowing interaction between dark energy and dark matter may resolve the\ntension between the high redshift CMB data and individual low redshift\ndatasets, but the low redshift datasets have inconsistencies between them (e.g.\nbetween BAO and $H_0$, SNeIa and BAO, and cluster counts and $H_0$) that are\npractically independent of the cosmological model. \n\n"}

Here we present\nthe combined results of ALMA (0.9 mm) and VLA (7 mm) dust continuum\nobservations toward the protoplanetary disk around the solar analogue GM Aur.\nBoth images clearly resolve the $\\sim$35 au inner cavity. The ALMA observations\nalso reveal a fainter disk that extends up to $\\sim250$ au. We model our\nobservations using two approaches: an analytical fit to the observed\ndeprojected visibilities, and a physical disk model that fits the SED as well\nas the VLA and ALMA observations.

A size and magnitude\n  limited catalog of dwarf galaxies in the area of the Fornax cluster Abstract: The Fornax Deep Survey (FDS), an imaging survey in the u', g', r', and\ni'-bands, has a supreme resolution and image depth compared to the previous\nspatially complete Fornax Cluster Catalog (FCC). Our new data allows us to\nstudy the galaxies down to r'-band magnitude m$_{r'}\\approx$21 mag\n(M$_{r'}\\approx$-10.5 mag). These data provide an important legacy dataset to\nstudy the Fornax cluster. We aim to present the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) dwarf\ngalaxy catalog, focusing on explaining the data reduction and calibrations,\nassessing the quality of the data, and describing the methods used for defining\nthe cluster memberships for the catalog objects. As a first step we used the\nSExtractor fine-tuned for dwarf galaxy detection, to find galaxies from the FDS\ndata, covering a 26 deg$^2$ area of the main cluster, and the area around the\nFornax A substructure. We made 2D-decompositions of the identified galaxies\nusing GALFIT. We used color-magnitude, luminosity-radius and\nluminosity-concentration relations to separate the cluster galaxies from the\nbackground galaxies. We then divided the cluster galaxies into early- and\nlate-type galaxies according to their morphology and gave first order\nmorphological classifications. Our final catalog includes 14,095 galaxies. We\nclassify 590 galaxies as being likely Fornax cluster galaxies, of which 564 are\ndwarfs (M$_{r'}$ > -18.5 mag) consisting our Fornax dwarf catalog. Of the\ncluster dwarfs we classify 470 as early-types, and 94 as late-type galaxies.\nOur final catalog reaches its 50% completeness limit at magnitude M$_{r'}$ =\n-10.5 mag and surface brightness $\\bar{\\mu}_{e,r'}$ = 26 mag arcsec-2, which is\napproximately three magnitudes deeper than the FCC.

Achieving competitive constraints on these parameters\nrequires high signal-to-noise extraction of the projected gravitational\npotential from the CMB maps. Standard methods for reconstructing the lensing\npotential employ the quadratic estimator (QE). However, the QE performs\nsuboptimally at the low noise levels expected in upcoming experiments. Other\nmethods, like maximum likelihood estimators (MLE), are under active\ndevelopment. In this work, we demonstrate reconstruction of the CMB lensing\npotential with deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) - ie, a ResUNet. The\nnetwork is trained and tested on simulated data, and otherwise has no physical\nparametrization related to the physical processes of the CMB and gravitational\nlensing. We show that, over a wide range of angular scales, ResUNets recover\nthe input gravitational potential with a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the\nQE method, reaching levels comparable to analytic approximations of MLE\nmethods.

To trigger this process, it has been\nargued that sedimentation of solids onto the mid-plane needs to be efficient\nand therefore that a quiescent gaseous environment is required. It is often\nsuggested that dead-zone or disk-wind structure created by non-ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) effects meets this requirement. However,\nsimulations have shown that the midplane of a dead zone is not completely\nquiescent. In order to examine the concentration of solids in such an\nenvironment, we use the local-shearing-box approximation to simulate a\nparticle-gas system with an Ohmic dead zone including mutual drag force between\nthe gas and the solids. We systematically compare the evolution of the system\nwith ideal or non-ideal MHD, with or without back-reaction drag force from\nparticles on gas, and with varying solid abundances. Similar to previous\ninvestigations of dead zone dynamics, we find that particles of dimensionless\nstopping time $\\tau_s=0.1$ do not sediment appreciably more than those in ideal\nmagneto-rotational turbulence, resulting in a vertical scale height an order of\nmagnitude larger than in a laminar disk. Contrary to the expectation that this\nshould curb the formation of planetesimals, we nevertheless find that strong\nclumping of solids still occurs in the dead zone when solid abundances are\nsimilar to the critical value for a laminar environment. This can be explained\nby the weak radial diffusion of particles near the mid-plane. The results imply\nthat the sedimentation of particles to the mid-plane is not a necessary\ncriterion for the formation of planetesimals by the streaming instability. \n\n"}

In order to accommodate the new eclipse times, the\ntwo-planet model requires that one or both of the planets require highly\neccentric orbits, that is, $e \\geq$ 0.4. Such multiple planet orbits are\nconsidered to be unstable. Whilst our new observations are consistent with two\ncyclic variations as previously predicted, significant residuals remain. We\nconclude that either additional cyclic terms, possibly associated with more\nplanets, or other mechanisms, such as the Applegate mechanism are contributing\nto the eclipse time variations.

Interactions of the\ndust particles with the gas must serve to augment local particle densities, and\nfacilitate growth past barriers in the metre size range. Amongst a number of\nmechanisms that can amplify the local density of solids, aerodynamic streaming\ninstability (SI) is one of the most promising. This work tests the physical\nassumptions of models that lead to SI in protoplanetary disks (PPDs). We\nconduct laboratory experiments in which we track the three-dimensional motion\nof spherical solid particles fluidized in a low-pressure, laminar,\nincompressible, gas stream. The particle sizes span the Stokes-Epstein drag\nregime transition and the overall dust-to-gas mass density ratio is close to\nunity. Lambrechts et al. (2016) established the similarity of the laboratory\nflow to a simplified PPD model flow. We obtain experimental results suggesting\nan instability due to particle-gas interaction: i) there exist variations in\nparticle concentration in the direction of the mean drag forces; ii) the\nparticles have a tendency to 'catch up' to one another when they are in\nproximity; iii) particle clumping occurs on very small scales, which implies\nlocal enhancements above the background dust-to-gas mass density ratio by\nfactors of several tens; v) the presence of these density enhancements occurs\nfor a mean dust-to-gas mass density ratio approaching or greater than 1; v) we\nfind evidence for collective particle drag reduction when the local particle\nnumber density becomes high and when the background gas pressure is high so\nthat the drag is in the continuum regime.

The\noptically thin CO (J=3-2) emission is co-located with previously identified\ndust emission from the belt, and the emission velocity structure is consistent\nwith Keplerian rotation around the central star. The detected CO is not well\nshielded against photodissociation, and must thus be continuously replenished\nby gas release from exocomets within the belt.

More luminous stars will therefore on average host more\nmassive (and hence more easily detectable) exocometary CO disks, leading to the\nhigher detection rates observed.

This corresponds to previous steady-state cooling\nflow models calculated by White & Sarazin (1987). Detailed agreement is found\nbetween steady-state models and time-dependent models at fixed times in the\nsimulations.

The\nproperties of the OVI absorption are inconsistent with the standard superbubble\nmodel in which this gas arises in a conductive interface inside the outer\nshell.

Assuming the excess flux of 10-20 TW over the heat flux level produced\nby known sources, which is quoted by many researchers, to be due to the energy\nliberated in the outer kernel layers in daemon-stimulated proton decay of iron\nnuclei, we have come to the conclusion that the Earth's kernel is presently\nmeasured in few fractions of meter in size. The observed mantle flux of 3He\n(and the limiting 3He/4He ~ 10^(-4) ratio itself) can be provided if at least\none 3He(or 3T) nucleus is emitted in a daemon-stimulated decay of ~100-1000 Fe\nnuclei.

The mass of the enshrouded stellar cluster must be\n> 2.5x10^6 M_sun and the age must be < 4.8x10^6 yr.

The joint measurements with two\nindependent telescopes allow us to assess the impact of instrument-specific\nsystematics, one of the major difficulties in cosmic shear measurements. For\nboth surveys, we carefully account for effects such as smearing by the point\nspread function and shearing due to telescope optics. We find negligible\nresiduals in both cases and recover mutually consistent cosmic shear signals,\nsignificant at the 5.1 sigma level.

Models in which all CDM halos have either a constant\nemissivity or a constant energy emitted per Hubble time, per unit mass, predict\nthat reionization ends near z~6 and the optical depth is in the range 0.05 <\ntau_e < 0.09, consistent with WMAP results at the 1 to 2 sigma level.

Given some of the recent\ndeterminations of the SFH, the observed SN Ia redshift distribution indicates a\nlong (>~1 h^-1 Gyr) mean delay time between the formation of a stellar\npopulation and the explosion of some of its members as SNe Ia. For example, if\nthe Madau et al. (1998) SFH is assumed, the delay time tau is constrained to be\ntau > 1.7 (tau > 0.7) h^-1 Gyr at the 95%(99%) confidence level (CL).

MOND requires\ngravitation to depart from Newtonian theory in the extragalactic regime where\ndynamical accelerations are small. So far relativistic gravitation theories\nproposed to underpin MOND have either clashed with the post-Newtonian tests of\ngeneral relativity, or failed to provide significant gravitational lensing, or\nviolated hallowed principles by exhibiting superluminal scalar waves or an\n\\textit{a priori} vector field. We develop a relativistic MOND inspired theory\nwhich resolves these problems. In it gravitation is mediated by metric, a\nscalar field and a 4-vector field, all three dynamical. For a simple choice of\nits free function, the theory has a Newtonian limit for nonrelativistic\ndynamics with significant acceleration, but a MOND limit when accelerations are\nsmall. We calculate the $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ PPN coefficients showing them to\nagree with solar system measurements. The gravitational light deflection by\nnonrelativistic systems is governed by the same potential responsible for\ndynamics of particles. To the extent that MOND successfully describes dynamics\nof a system, the new theory's predictions for lensing by that system's visible\nmatter will agree as well with observations as general relativity's predictions\nmade with a dynamically successful dark halo model. Cosmological models based\non the theory are quite similar to those based on general relativity; they\npredict slow evolution of the scalar field.

The most statistically significant portion of this\nsample involves the comparison of Mg and Fe wavelength shifts using the\nmany-multiplet (MM) method. However, the sensitivity of this method to the\nabundance of heavy isotopes, especially Mg, is enough to imitate an apparent\nvariation in alpha in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.8. We implement recent\nyields of intermediate mass (IM) stars into a chemical evolution model and show\nthat the ensuing isotope distribution of Mg can account for the observed\nvariation in alpha provided the early IMF was particularly rich in intermediate\nmass stars (or the heavy Mg isotope yields from AGB stars are even higher than\nin present-day models). As such, these observations of quasar absorption\nspectra can be used to probe the nucleosynthetic history of low-metallicity\ndamped Lyman-alpha systems in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 1.8.

We study the cross-correlation as a function\nof group mass, and as a function of the luminosity, stellar mass, colour,\nspectral type and specific star formation rate of the galaxies. All these\ncross-correlation functions show a clear transition from the `1-halo' to the\n`2-halo' regimes on a scale comparable to the virial radius of the groups in\nconsideration. On scales larger than the virial radius, all cross-correlation\nfunctions are roughly parallel, consistent with the linear bias model. In\nparticular, the large scale correlation amplitudes are higher for more massive\ngroups, and for brighter and redder galaxies. In the `1-halo' regime, the\ncross-correlation function depends strongly on the definition of the group\ncenter. We consider both a luminosity-weighted center (LWC) and a center\ndefined by the location of the brightest group galaxy (BGC). With the first\ndefinition, the bright early-type galaxies in massive groups are found to be\nmore centrally concentrated than the fainter, late-type galaxies.

We\nsplit the population of galaxies in early types, late types, and intermediate\ntypes, based on their colour and specific star formation rate. At fixed\nluminosity, the early type fraction increases with increasing halo mass. Most\nimportantly, this mass dependence is smooth and persists over the entire mass\nrange probed, without any break or feature at any mass scale. We argue that the\nprevious claim of a characteristic feature on galaxy group scales is an\nartefact of the environment estimators used. At fixed halo mass, the luminosity\ndependence of the type fractions is surprisingly weak: galaxy type depends more\nstrongly on halo mass than on luminosity. We also find that the early type\nfraction decreases with increasing halo-centric radius. Contrary to previous\nstudies, we find that this radial dependence is also present in low mass\nhaloes. The properties of satellite galaxies are strongly correlated with those\nof their central galaxy. In particular, the early type fraction of satellites\nis significantly higher in a halo with an early type central galaxy than in a\nhalo of the same mass but with a late type central galaxy. This phenomenon,\nwhich we call `galactic conformity', is present in haloes of all masses and for\nsatellites of all luminosities. Finally, the fraction of intermediate type\ngalaxies is always ~20 percent, independent of luminosity, independent of halo\nmass, independent of halo-centric radius, and independent of whether the galaxy\nis a central galaxy or a satellite galaxy.

BHMFs at intermediate redshifts are calculated in two\nways. One way is from early-type galaxy luminosity functions (LFs); we assume\nan M_BH - L_sph correlation at a redshift by considering a passive evolution of\nL_sph in the local relationship. The resultant BHMFs (spheroid-BHMFs) from LFs\nof red sequence galaxies indicates a slight decrease of number density with\nincreasing redshift at M_BH > 10^{7.5-8} M_solar. Since a redshift evolution in\nslope and zeropoint of the M_BH - L_sph relation is unlikely to be capable of\nmaking such an evolution in BHMF, the evolution of the spheroid-BHMFs is\nperhaps due mainly to the decreasing normalization in the galaxy LFs. We also\ninvestigate how spheroid-BHMFs are affected by uncertainties existing in the\nderivation in detail. The other way of deriving a BHMF is based on the\ncontinuity equation for number density of SMBHs and LFs of active galactic\nnucleus (AGN). The resultant BHMFs (AGN-BHMFs) show no clear evolution out to z\n= 1 at M_BH > 10^8 M_solar, but exhibit a significant decrease with redshift in\nthe lower mass range. Comparison of the spheroid-BHMFs with the AGN-BHMFs\nsuggests that at M_BH > 10^{8} M_solar, the spheroid-BHMFs are broadly\nconsistent with the AGN-BHMFs out to z ~ 1. The agreement between the\nspheroid-BHMFs and the AGN-BHMFs appears to support that most of the SMBHs are\nalready hosted by massive spheroids at z ~ 1 and they evolve without\nsignificant mass growth since then. \n\n"}

But only a small fraction of galaxies is moving face-on.\nTherefore, in this work we focus on a systematic study of the effect of the\ninclination angle between the direction of motion and the galaxy's rotation\naxis.\n  In agreement with some previous works, we find that the inclination angle\ndoes not play a major role for the mass loss as long as the galaxy is not\nmoving close to edge-on. We can predict this behaviour by extending Gunn &\nGott's estimate of the stripping radius, which is valid for face-on geometries,\nto moderate inclinations.\n  The inclination plays a role as long as the ram pressure is comparable to\npressures in the galactic plane, which can span two orders of magnitude. For\nvery strong ram pressures, the disc will be stripped completely, and for very\nweak ram pressures, mass loss is negligible independent of inclination. We show\nthat in non-edge-on geometries the stripping proceeds remarkably similar. A\nmajor difference between different inclinations is the degree of asymmetry\nintroduced in the remaining gas disc.\n  We demonstrate that the tail of gas stripped from the galaxy does not\nnecessarily point in a direction opposite to the galaxy's direction of motion.\nTherefore, the observation of a galaxy's gas tail may be misleading about the\ngalaxy's direction of motion. \n\n"}

The position of the peak does not seem to depend on the\nvelocity dispersion of the nearest cluster, undermining the importance of the\ngravitational effect of the clusters involved.

The resonant energy\ntransfer between the orbit and NS speeds up or slows down the inspiral and\ninduces a phase change in the emitted gravitational waves from the binary. A\ntidal resonance, (jk,m), occurs when the mode frequency equals m times the\norbital frequency. For f-mode resonance to occur before coalescence, the NS\nmust have rapid rotation, with spin frequency nu_s>710Hz for (22,2)-resonance\nand nu_s>570Hz for (33,3)-resonance (M=1.4Mo and R=10km; however, for R=15km,\nthese spin frequencies become 330Hz and 250Hz). Because of strong tidal\ncoupling, f-mode resonances induce a large change in the number of orbital\ncycles, N_orb, with maximum N_orb~10-1000 for (22,2)-resonance and N_orb~1 for\n(33,3)- resonance. Such resonant effects, if present, must be included in\nconstructing waveform templates used in searching for gravitational wave\nsignals. Higher order f-mode resonances can occur at slower rotation rates, but\nN_orb<0.1. For the dominant g-mode (22,2)-resonance, even modest rotation\n(nu_s<100Hz) can enhance the resonant effect on the orbit by shifting resonance\nto a smaller orbital frequency. However, because of the weak coupling, N_orb\nlies in the range 10^-3-10^-2 (depending on the NS EOS) and is probably\nnegligible for the purpose of detecting gravitational waves. R-mode resonances\nrequire misaligned spin-orbit inclinations, and the dominant resonances\ncorrespond to (22,3) and (22,1). Since tidal coupling depends strongly on\nrotation rate, N_orb<10^-2(R/10km)^(10)(M/1.4Mo)^(-20/3) is negligible for\ncanonical NS parameters but can be appreciable if the NS radius is larger. \n\n"}

A\nproposed explanation for this remarkable fact is that gravitational radiation\nfrom a steady-state r-mode oscillation in the neutron star's core halts the\nspin-up due to accretion. For the neutron star transients, balancing the\ntime-averaged accretion torque with gravitational wave emission from\nsteady-state, constant amplitude r-mode pulsations implies a quiescent\nluminosity too bright to be consistent with observations (in particular of Aql\nX-1). The viscous dissipation (roughly 10 MeV per accreted nucleon for a spin\nof 300 Hz) from such an r-mode makes the core sufficiently hot to power a\nthermal luminosity of order 1e34 erg/s when accretion halts. This is the\nminimum quiescent luminosity that the neutron star must emit when viscous\nheating in the core is balanced by radiative cooling from the surface, as is\nthe case when the core of the star is superfluid.
