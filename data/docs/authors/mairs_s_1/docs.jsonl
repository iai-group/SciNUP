We investigate the\ndependence of light scattering properties on wavelength, cluster size and\nporosity using these aggregate models.

One method employs a direct fit to a modified\nblackbody SED; the other involves a comparison of flux ratios to an analytical\nprediction. Fitting fluxes near the SED peak produces inaccurate temperature\nand dust spectral index estimates due to the line of sight temperature (and\ndensity) variations. Longer wavelength fluxes in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the\nspectrum (>~ 600 micron for typical cores) may more accurately recover the\nspectral index, but both methods are very sensitive to noise. The temperature\nestimate approaches the density weighted temperature, or \"column temperature,\"\nof the source as short wavelength fluxes are excluded. An inverse temperature -\nspectral index correlation naturally results from SED fitting, due to the\ninaccurate isothermal assumption, as well as noise uncertainties. We show that\nabove some \"threshold\" temperature, the temperatures estimated through the flux\nratio method can be highly inaccurate. In general, observations with widely\nseparated wavelengths, and including shorter wavelengths, result in higher\nthreshold temperatures; such observations thus allow for more accurate\ntemperature estimates of sources with temperatures less than the threshold\ntemperature.

This model predicts that weak turbulence, generically present\nin most of astrophysical systems, enhances the rate of reconnection by reducing\nthe transverse scale for reconnection events and by allowing many independent\nflux reconnection events to occur simultaneously. As a result the reconnection\nspeed becomes independent of Ohmic resistivity and is determined by the\nmagnetic field wandering induced by turbulence. To quantify the reconnection\nspeed we use both an intuitive definition, i.e. the speed of the reconnected\nflux inflow, as well as a more sophisticated definition based on a formally\nderived analytical expression. Our results confirm the predictions of the\nLazarian & Vishniac model. In particular, we find that Vrec Pinj^(1/2), as\npredicted by the model.

The model includes self-shielding, mutual shielding and shielding by\natomic and molecular hydrogen, and it is the first such model to include the\nrare isotopologues C17O and 13C17O.

The photodissociation rate in the unattenuated interstellar\nradiation field is 2.6e-10 s^-1, 30% higher than currently adopted values.\nIncreasing the excitation temperature or the Doppler width can reduce the\nphotodissociation rates and the isotopic selectivity by as much as a factor of\nthree for temperatures above 100 K.

Our studies of magnetic field diffusion in turbulent\nmedium reveal interesting new phenomena. In the presence of gravity and\nturbulence, our 3D simulations show the decrease of the magnetic flux-to-mass\nratio as the gaseous density at the center of the gravitational potential\nincreases. We observe this effect both in the situations when we start with\nequilibrium distributions of gas and magnetic field and when we follow the\nevolution of collapsing dynamically unstable configurations. Thus the process\nof turbulent magnetic field removal should be applicable both to quasi-static\nsubcritical molecular clouds and cores and violently collapsing supercritical\nentities. The increase of the gravitational potential as well as the\nmagnetization of the gas increases the segregation of the mass and magnetic\nflux in the saturated final state of the simulations, supporting the notion\nthat the reconnection-enabled diffusivity relaxes the magnetic field + gas\nsystem in the gravitational field to its minimal energy state.

We also study the possibility of a collisional runaway developing in the\nfirst $\\sim 2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ of dynamical evolution.

Analysis of the radii of curvature of electron trajectories in the\ninertial observer's frame (IOF) enables these two effects to be considered\ntogether. We demonstrate that for dipolar magnetic field lines on the TS there\nexists a `caustic phase' beyond which no emission can be observed.

NE shows no evidence of variation in 23\nepochs where it is resolved separately from the primary radio component,\ndemonstrating that the variable emission arises in the primary. Since NE is\nnon-variable, the radio flux from the primary can now be well determined for\nthe first time, most especially in observations that do not resolve both the\nprimary and NE components. The variable radio emission from the primary has a\nperiod of 6.7+/-0.3 years which is described by a simple model of a non-thermal\nsource orbiting within the stellar wind envelope of the binary.

As more such models become available, it\nbecomes increasingly important to test them. In this and a companion paper, we\ntest a suite of publicly available evolutionary synthesis models using\nintegrated optical spectra in the blue-near-UV range of 27 well studied star\nclusters from the work of Leonardi & Rose (2003) spanning a wide range of ages\nand metallicities. Most (23) of the clusters are from the Magellanic clouds.\nThis paper concentrates on methodological aspects of spectral fitting. The data\nare fitted with SSP spectral models from Vazdekis and collaborators, based on\nthe MILES library. Best-fit and Bayesian estimates of age, metallicity and\nextinction are presented, and degeneracies between these parameters are mapped.\nWe find that these models can match the observed spectra very well in most\ncases, with small formal uncertainties in t, Z and A_V. In some cases, the\nspectral fits indicate that the models lack a blue old population, probably\nassociated with the horizontal branch. This methodology, which is mostly based\non the publicly available code STARLIGHT, is extended to other sets of models\nin Paper II, where a comparison with properties derived from spatially resolved\ndata (color-magnitude diagrams) is presented.

Since radiation feedback from embedded stars\ncan modify this as collapse proceeds, feedback plays an important role in\ndetermining the IMF. However, the effects and importance of radiative heating\nare likely to depend strongly on the surface density of the collapsing clouds,\nwhich determines both their effectiveness at trapping radiation and the\naccretion luminosities of the stars forming within them. In this paper we\nreport a suite of adaptive mesh refinement radiation-hydrodynamic simulations\nusing the ORION code in which we isolate the effect of column density on\nfragmentation by following the collapse of clouds of varying column density\nwhile holding the mass, initial density and velocity structure, and initial\nvirial ratio fixed.

The build-up of magnetic helicity at small scales provides an\nimportant saturation mechanism. In order to understand the nature of the solar\ndynamo we need to understand the details of the saturation mechanism in\nspherical geometry. In particular, we want to understand the effects of\nmagnetic helicity fluxes from turbulence and meridional circulation. We\nconsider a model with just radial shear confined to a thin layer (tachocline)\nat the bottom of the convection zone. The kinetic alpha owing to helical\nturbulence is assumed to be localized in a region above the convection zone.\nThe dynamical quenching formalism is used to describe the build-up of mean\nmagnetic helicity in the model, which results in a magnetic alpha effect that\nfeeds back on the kinetic alpha effect. In some cases we compare with results\nobtained using a simple algebraic alpha quenching formula. In agreement with\nearlier findings, the magnetic alpha effect in the dynamical alpha quenching\nformalism has the opposite sign compared with the kinetic alpha effect and\nleads to a catastrophic decrease of the saturation field strength with\nincreasing magnetic Reynolds numbers. However, at high latitudes this quenching\neffect can lead to secondary dynamo waves that propagate poleward due to the\nopposite sign of alpha. Magnetic helicity fluxes both from turbulent mixing and\nfrom meridional circulation alleviate catastrophic quenching. \n\n"}

First, the field offers\nlocally support against gravitational collapse in the accretion flow,\nsubstantially reducing the amount of secondary fragmentation in comparison to\nthe gas dynamical case. Second, the field drains angular momentum from the\ncollapsing gas, further increasing the amount of material available for\naccretion by the central, massive, protostar, and thus increasing its final\nmass by about 50% from the purely gas dynamical case. Third, the field is wound\nup by the rotation of the flow, driving a tower flow. However, this flow never\nachieves the strength seen in low-mass star formation simulations for two\nreasons: gravitational fragmentation disrupts the circular flow in the central\nregions where the protostars form, and the expanding H II regions tend to\nfurther disrupt the field geometry.

Abstract: Many intermediate age star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds present multiple\nmain sequence turn-offs (MMSTO), which challenge the classical idea that star\nformation in such objects took place over short timescales. It has been\nrecently suggested that the presence of fast rotators among main sequence stars\ncould be the cause of such features (Bastian & de Mink 2009), hence relaxing\nthe need for extended periods of star formation. In this letter, we compute\nevolutionary tracks and isochrones of models with and without rotation. We find\nthat, for the same age and input physics, both kinds of models present\nturn-offs with an almost identical position in the colour-magnitude diagrams.\nAs a consequence, a dispersion of rotational velocities in coeval ensembles of\nstars could not explain the presence of MMSTOs. We construct several synthetic\ncolour-magnitude diagrams for the different kinds of tracks and combinations of\nthem. The models that best reproduce the morphology of observed MMSTOs are\nclearly those assuming a significant spread in the stellar ages - as long as\n~400 Myr - added to a moderate amount of convective core overshooting. Only\nthese models produce the detailed \"golf club\" shape of observed MMSTOs. A\nspread in rotational velocities alone cannot do anything similar. We also\ndiscuss models involving a mixture of stars with and without overshooting, as\nan additional scenario to producing MMSTOs with coeval populations. We find\nthat they produce turn-offs with a varying extension in the CMD direction\nperpendicular to the lower main sequence, which are clearly not present in\nobserved MMSTOs. \n\n"}

The evolutionary history of each element is different\nowing to the effects of the initial progenitor mass and metallicity on element\nproduction. In the bulge and thick disk the star formation timescale is shorter\nthan in the solar neighbourhood, leading to higher [alpha/Fe] ratios. Likewise,\nthe smaller contribution from Type Ia supernovae in these regions leads to\nlower [Mn/Fe] ratios. Also in the bulge, the abundances of [(Na, Al, P, Cl, K,\nSc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] are higher because of the effect of metallicity on element\nproduction from core-collapse supernovae. According to our predictions, it is\npossible to find metal-rich stars ([Fe/H]>-1) that formed in the early Universe\nas a result of rapid star formation. The chemical enrichment timescale of the\nhalo is longer than in the solar neighbourhood, and consequently the ratios of\n[(C, F)/Fe] and 12C/13C are higher owing to a significant contribution from\nlow-mass AGB stars.

Implications for the Origin of the Initial Mass Function Abstract: One model for the origin of typical galactic star clusters such as the Orion\nNebula Cluster (ONC) is that they form via the rapid, efficient collapse of a\nbound gas clump within a larger, gravitationally-unbound giant molecular cloud.\nHowever, simulations in support of this scenario have thus far have not\nincluded the radiation feedback produced by the stars; radiative simulations\nhave been limited to significantly smaller or lower density regions. Here we\nuse the ORION adaptive mesh refinement code to conduct the first ever\nradiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the global collapse scenario for the\nformation of an ONC-like cluster. We show that radiative feedback has a\ndramatic effect on the evolution: once the first ~10-20% of the gas mass is\nincorporated into stars, their radiative feedback raises the gas temperature\nhigh enough to suppress any further fragmentation. However, gas continues to\naccrete onto existing stars, and, as a result, the stellar mass distribution\nbecomes increasingly top-heavy, eventually rendering it incompatible with the\nobserved IMF. Systematic variation in the location of the IMF peak as star\nformation proceeds is incompatible with the observed invariance of the IMF\nbetween star clusters, unless some unknown mechanism synchronizes the IMFs in\ndifferent clusters by ensuring that star formation is always truncated when the\nIMF peak reaches a particular value.

During our monitoring, an initial period of quiescence was\nfollowed by increased activity which culminated in a radio flare. In the\ntransition period the accretion disc of SS433 became visible in H-alpha and HeI\nemission lines and remained so until the observations were terminated; the\nline-of-sight velocity of the centre of the disc lines during this time behaved\nas though the binary orbit has significant eccentricity rather than being\ncircular, consistent with three recent lines of evidence. After the accretion\ndisc appeared its rotation speed increased steadily from 500 to 700 km/s. The\nlaunch speed of the jets first decreased then suddenly increased.

However, the combination of 2MASS near-infrared (NIR) and\nSpitzer-IRAC mid-infrared (MIR) photometry enables a powerful method for\ndetermining the line of sight reddening to any star: the sampled wavelengths\nlie in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the spectral energy distribution of most\nstars, where, to first order, all stars have essentially the same intrinsic\ncolor. Thus, changes in stellar NIR-MIR colors due to interstellar reddening\nare readily apparent, and (under an assumed extinction law) the observed colors\nand magnitudes of stars can be easily and accurately restored to their\nintrinsic values, greatly increasing their usefulness for Galactic structure\nstudies. In this paper we explore this \"Rayleigh-Jeans Color Excess\" (RJCE)\nmethod and demonstrate that use of even a simple variant of the RJCE method\nbased on a single reference color, (H-[4.5um]), can rather accurately remove\ndust effects from previously uninterpretable 2MASS color-magnitude diagrams of\nstars in fields along the heavily reddened Galactic mid-plane, with results far\nsuperior to those derived from application of other dereddening methods.

We address, through 2D\n(axisymmetric) simulations, the question of whether realistic levels of\nnonideal effects, computed with a simplified chemical network including dust\ngrains, can weaken the magnetic braking enough to enable a rotationally\nsupported disk to form. We find that ambipolar diffusion, the dominant nonideal\nMHD effect over most of the density range relevant to disk formation, does not\nenable disk formation, at least in 2D. The reason is that ambipolar diffusion\nallows the magnetic flux that would be dragged into the central stellar object\nin the ideal MHD limit to pile up instead in a small circumstellar region,\nwhere the magnetic field strength (and thus the braking efficiency) is greatly\nenhanced. We also find that, on the scale of tens of AU or more, a realistic\nlevel of Ohmic dissipation does not weaken the magnetic braking enough for a\nrotationally supported disk to form, either by itself or in combination with\nambipolar diffusion. The Hall effect, the least explored of these three\nnonideal MHD effects, can spin up the material close to the central object to a\nsignificant, supersonic rotation speed, even when the core is initially\nnon-rotating, although the spun-up material remains too sub-Keplerian to form a\nrotationally supported disk.

Abstract: We explore the minimal conditions which enable the formation of\nmetal-enriched solar and sub-solar mass stars. We find that in the absence of\ndust grains, gas fragmentation occurs at densities nH ~ [10^4-10^5]cm^{-3} when\nthe metallicity exceeds Z ~ 10^{-4} Zsun. The resulting fragmentation masses\nare > 10 Msun. The inclusion of Fe and Si cooling does not affect the thermal\nevolution as this is dominated by molecular cooling even for metallicities as\nlarge as Z = 10^{-2} Zsun. The presence of dust is the key driver for the\nformation of low-mass stars. We focus on three representative core-collapse\nsupernova (SN) progenitors, and consider the effects of reverse shocks of\nincreasing strength: these reduce the depletion factors, fdep =\nMdust/(Mdust+Mmet), alter the shape of the grain size distribution function and\nmodify the relative abundances of grain species and of metal species in the gas\nphase. We find that the lowest metallicity at which fragmentation occurs is\nZ=10^{-6} Zsun for gas pre-enriched by the explosion of a 20 Msun primordial SN\n(fdep > 0.22) and/or by a 35 Msun, Z=10^{-4} Zsun SN (fdep > 0.26); it is ~ 1\ndex larger, when the gas is pre-enriched by a Z = 10^{-4} Zsun, 20 Msun SN\n(fdep > 0.04). Cloud fragmentation depends on the depletion factor and it is\nsuppressed when the reverse shock leads to a too large destruction of dust\ngrains. These features are all consistent with the existence of a minimum\ndust-to-gas ratio, Dcr, above which fragmentation is activated. We derive a\nsimple analytic expression for Dcr which, for grain composition and properties\nexplored in the present study, reads Dcr = [2.6 - 6.3] x 10^{-9}. When the\ndust-to-gas ratio of star forming clouds exceeds this value, the fragmentation\nmasses range between 0.01 Msun and 1 Msun, thus enabling the formation of the\nfirst low-mass stars. \n\n"}

As for\nAFGL5142, the hot core emission is resolved into two elongated cores separated\n1800 AU. A detailed comparison of the complex molecule peaks to the new CO(2-1)\ndata and H2O maser data from literature suggests that also for AFGL5142 the\ncomplex molecules are mainly associated with disks, except for a faint and\nextended molecular emission found to the west, which is possibly produced in\nthe interface between one of the outflows and the dense surrounding gas. \n\n"}

Specifically, we investigate the possibility of the\nvery massive star (VMS) VFTS 682 being a runaway member of R136. Recent\nobservations of the above VMS, by virtue of its isolated location and its\nmoderate peculiar motion, have raised the fundamental question whether isolated\nmassive star formation is indeed possible. We perform the first realistic\nN-body computations of fully mass-segregated R136-type star clusters in which\nall the massive stars are in primordial binary systems. These calculations\nconfirm that the dynamical ejection of a VMS from a R136-like cluster, with\nkinematic properties similar to those of VFTS 682, is common. Hence the\nconjecture of isolated massive star formation is unnecessary to account for\nthis VMS. Our results are also quite consistent with the ejection of 30 Dor\n016, another suspected runaway VMS from R136. We further note that during the\nclusters' evolution, mergers of massive binaries produce a few single stars per\ncluster with masses significantly exceeding the canonical upper-limit of 150\nsolar mass. The observations of such single super-canonical stars in R136,\ntherefore, do not imply an IMF with an upper limit greatly exceeding the\naccepted canonical 150 solar mass limit, as has been suggested recently, and\nthey are consistent with the canonical upper limit. \n\n"}

We detect a\nwarm dust component in Kepler's remnant with T = 82K and mass 0.0031Msun; this\nis spatially coincident with thermal X-ray emission optical knots and\nfilaments, consistent with the warm dust originating in the circumstellar\nmaterial swept up by the primary blast wave of the remnant.

Comparing the\nspatial distribution of the warm dust with X-rays from the ejecta and swept-up\nmedium, and Ha emission arising from the post-shock edge, we show that the warm\ndust is swept up interstellar material.

Our model\nassumes that early superhumps are caused by the rotation effect of\nnon-axisymmetrically flaring disks. We have developed a Bayesian model for this\nreconstruction, in which a smoother disk-structure tends to have a higher prior\nprobability. We analyzed simultaneous optical and near-infrared photometric\ndata of early superhumps of the dwarf nova, V455 And using this technique. The\nreconstructed disk has two flaring parts in the outermost region of the disk.\nThese parts are responsible for the primary and secondary maxima of the light\ncurves. The height-to-radius ratio is h/r=0.20-0.25 in the outermost region. In\naddition to the outermost flaring structures, flaring arm-like patterns can be\nseen in an inner region of the reconstructed disk. The overall profile of the\nreconstructed disk is reminiscent of the disk structure that is deformed by the\ntidal effect. However, an inner arm-like pattern, which is responsible for the\nsecondary minimum in the light curve, cannot be reproduced only by the tidal\neffect. It implies the presence of another mechanism that deforms the disk\nstructure. Alternatively, the temperature distribution of the disk could be\nnon-axisymmetric. We demonstrate that the disk structure with weaker arm-like\npatterns is optimal in the model including the irradiation effect. However, the\nstrongly irradiated disk gives quite blue colors, which may conflict with the\nobservation. Our results suggest that the amplitude of early superhumps depends\nmainly on the height of the outermost flaring regions of the disk. We predict\nthat early superhumps can be detected with an amplitude of >0.02 mag in about\n90% of WZ Sge stars. \n\n"}

Most studies\nhave so far concentrated on the colder parts (T<30K) of these regions. The aim\nis to characterize the warmer parts of the protostellar envelope in order to\nquantify the feedback of the protostars on their surroundings in terms of\nshocks, UV heating, photodissociation and outflow dispersal. Fully sampled\nlarge scale maps of the region were obtained; APEX-CHAMP+ was used for 12CO\n6-5, 13CO 6-5 and [CI] 2-1, and JCMT-HARP-B for 12CO 3-2 emissions.\nComplementary Herschel-HIFI and ground-based lines of CO and its isotopologs,\nfrom 1-0 upto 10-9 (Eu/k 300K), are collected at the source positions.\nRadiative-transfer models of the dust and lines are used to determine\ntemperatures and masses of the outflowing and UV-heated gas and infer the CO\nabundance structure. Broad CO emission line profiles trace entrained shocked\ngas along the outflow walls, with typical temperatures of ~100K. At other\npositions surrounding the outflow and the protostar, the 6-5 line profiles are\nnarrow indicating UV excitation. The narrow 13CO 6-5 data directly reveal the\nUV heated gas distribution for the first time. The amount of UV-heated and\noutflowing gas are found to be comparable from the 12CO and 13CO 6-5 maps,\nimplying that UV photons can affect the gas as much as the outflows. Weak [CI]\nemission throughout the region indicates a lack of CO dissociating photons.\nModeling of the C18O lines indicates the necessity of a \"drop\" abundance\nprofile throughout the envelope where the CO freezes out and is reloaded back\ninto the gas phase, thus providing quantitative evidence for the CO ice\nevaporation zone around the protostars. The inner abundances are less than the\ncanonical value of CO/H_2=2.7x10^-4, indicating some processing of CO into\nother species on the grains. \n\n"}

We establish a simple\nprescription for preparing equivalent RMF and SHF parametrizations starting\nfrom a minimal set of empirical constraints on symmetric nuclear matter,\nnuclear binding energy and charge radii, enforcing equivalence of their Lorenz\neffective masses, and then using the pure neutron matter (PNM) equation of\nstate (EoS) obtained from ab-initio calculations to optimize the pure isovector\nparameters in the RMF and SHF models. We find the resulting RMF and SHF\nparametrizations give broadly consistent predictions of the symmetry energy J\nand its slope parameter L at saturation density within a tight range of <~2 MeV\nand <~6 MeV respectively, but that clear model dependence shows up in the\npredictions of higher-order symmetry energy parameters, leading to important\ndifferences in (a) the slope of the correlation between J and L from the\nconfidence ellipse, (b) the isospin-dependent part of the incompressibility of\nnuclear matter K_tau, (c) the symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities,\nand (d) the predicted neutron star radii.

This field exceeds the dipolar field $B_d$,\nresponsible for the braking of the pulsar rotation, by at least one order of\nmagnitude. Neither magnetospheric currents nor small scale field components\ngenerated during neutron star's birth can provide such field structures in old\npulsars.

A recent study by us,\nviz., that of Banerjee, Kroupa & Oh (2012; Paper I), which involves realistic\nN-body computations of star clusters mimicking R136, indicates that such\n\"super-canonical\" (SC) stars can be formed out of a dense stellar population\nwith a canonical initial mass function (IMF) through dynamically induced\nmergers of the most massive binaries. Here we study the formation of SC stars\nin the R136 models of Paper I in detail. To avoid forming extraneous SC stars\nfrom initially highly eccentric primordial binaries as in Paper I, we compute\nadditional models with only initially circular primordial binaries. We also\ntake into account the mass-evolution of the SC stars using detailed stellar\nevolutionary models that incorporate updated treatments of stellar winds. We\nfind that SC stars begin to form via dynamical mergers of massive binaries from\napprox. 1 Myr cluster age. We obtain SC stars with initial masses up to approx.\n250 M_sun from these computations. Multiple SC stars are found to remain bound\nto the cluster simultaneously within a SC-lifetime. These properties of the\ndynamically formed SC stars are consistent with those observed in R136. In\nfact, the stellar evolutionary models of SC stars imply that had they formed\nprimordially along with the rest of the R136 cluster, i.e., violating the\ncanonical upper limit, they would have evolved below the canonical 150 M_sun\nlimit by approx. 3 Myr, the likely age of R136, and would not have been\nobservable as SC stars at the present time in R136. This strongly supports the\ndynamical formation scenario of the observed SC stars in R136. \n\n"}

Two of these sources (including the EGO)\nare also associated with 6.7 GHz Class II methanol masers; the Class II masers\nare coincident with millimeter continuum cores that exhibit hot core line\nemission and drive active outflows, as indicated by the detection of SiO(5-4).\nIn these cases, the Class I masers are coincident with outflow lobes, and\nappear as clear cases of excitation by active outflows. In contrast, the third\nClass I source is associated with an ultracompact HII region, and not with\nClass II masers. The lack of SiO emission suggests the 13CO outflow is a relic,\nconsistent with its longer dynamical timescale. Our data show that massive\nyoung stellar objects associated only with Class I masers are not necessarily\nyoung, and provide the first unambiguous evidence that Class I masers may be\nexcited by both young (hot core) and older (UC HII) MYSOs within the same\nprotocluster. \n\n"}

Thanks to\nthe unprecedented data quality obtained by space missions, particularly CoRoT\nand Kepler, invaluable information is extracted from the high-precision stellar\noscillation frequencies, which provide very strong constraints on possible\nstellar models for a given set of classical observations.

Both stars have very similar atmospheric properties;\nhowever, using the individual frequencies extracted from the Kepler data, we\nhave determined quite distinct global properties, with increased precision\ncompared to that of earlier results. We found that both stars have left the\nmain sequence and characterized them as follows: KIC10920273 is a\none-solar-mass star (M=1.00 +/- 0.04 M_sun), but much older than our Sun\n(t=7.12 +/- 0.47 Gyr), while KIC11395018 is significantly more massive than the\nSun (M=1.27 +/- 0.04 M_sun) with an age close to that of the Sun (t=4.57 +/-\n0.23 Gyr).

As part of\nthe \"Water In Star-forming regions with Herschel\" (WISH) key program, water and\nother important molecules, such as CO and OH, have been observed in 51 embedded\nyoung stellar objects (YSOs). The studied sample covers a range of luminosities\nfrom <1 to >10^5 L_sol. Aims; We analyse the CO line emission towards a large\nsample of protostars in terms of both line intensities and profiles. Methods;\nHerschel-HIFI spectra of the 12CO 10-9, 13CO 10-9 and C18O 5-4, 9-8 and 10-9\nlines are analysed for a sample of 51 YSOs. In addition, JCMT spectra of 12CO\n3-2 and C18O 3-2 extend this analysis to cooler gas components. Results; All\nobserved CO and isotopologue spectra show a strong linear correlation between\nthe logarithms of the line and bolometric luminosities across six orders of\nmagnitude on both axes. This suggests that the high-J CO lines primarily trace\nthe amount of dense gas associated with YSOs. This relation can be extended to\nlarger (extragalactic) scales. The majority of the detected 12CO line profiles\ncan be decomposed into a broad and a narrow Gaussian component, while the C18O\nspectra are mainly fitted with a single Gaussian. A broadening of the line\nprofile is also observed from pre-stellar cores to embedded protostars, which\nis due mostly to non-thermal motions (turbulence/infall). The widths of the\nbroad 12CO 3-2 and 10-9 velocity components correlate with those of the narrow\nC18O 9-8 profiles, suggesting that the entrained outflowing gas and envelope\nmotions are related independent of the mass of the protostar.

Here, we study the underlying dynamical mechanisms which\ncan incite planetary escape in two-planet post-main sequence systems. Stellar\nmass loss alone is unlikely to be rapid and high enough to eject planets at\ntypically-observed separations. However, the combination of mass loss and\nplanet-planet interactions can prompt a shift from stable to chaotic regions of\nphase space. Consequently, when mass loss ceases, the unstable configuration\nmay cause escape.

These\nresults are based on high-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy taken with the\nKeck II telescope to provide a first characterization of these systems as\ndouble-lined rather than single-lined. It applies the power of infrared\nspectroscopy to the detection of cool secondaries; the flux scales as a less\nsteep function of mass in the infrared than in the visible, thus enabling an\nidentification of low-mass secondaries. We found that the RX J0513.1+0851 and\nRX J0539.9+0956 primary stars are fast rotators, 60 km/s and 80 km/s\nrespectively; this introduces extra difficulty in the detection of the\nsecondary component as a result of the quite broad absorption lines. To date,\nthese are the highest rotational velocities measured for a pre-main sequence\nspectroscopic binary. The orbital parameters and mass ratios were determined by\ncombining new visible light spectroscopy with our infrared data for both\nsystems. For RX J0513.1+0851, we derived a period of ~4 days and a mass ratio\nof q = 0.46 +/- 0.01 and for RX J0539.9+0956, a period of ~1117 days and a mass\nratio of q = 0.66 +/- 0.01. Based on our derived properties for the stellar\ncomponents, we estimate the luminosities and hence distances to these binaries\nat 220 pc and 90 pc.

On the other\nhand, the cloud morphology and the large-scale velocity distribution of the gas\ndo strongly depend on the cooling function.

We compare\nour view of gas flows in M51 -- which arise due to departures from axi-symmetry\nin the gravitational potential (i.e. the nuclear bar and spiral arms) -- with\nthe global pattern of star formation as traced by Halpha and 24\\mu m emission.\nWe find that the dynamical environment of GMCs strongly affects their ability\nto form stars, in the sense that GMCs situated in regions with large streaming\nmotions can be stabilized, while similarly massive GMCs in regions without\nstreaming go on to efficiently form stars. We argue that this is the result of\nreduced surface pressure felt by clouds embedded in an ambient medium\nundergoing large streaming motions, which prevents collapse. Indeed, the\nvariation in gas depletion time expected based on the observed streaming\nmotions throughout the disk of M51 quantitatively agrees with the variation in\nobserved gas depletion time scale. The example of M51 shows that streaming\nmotions, triggered by gravitational instabilities in the form of bars and\nspiral arms, can alter the star formation law; this can explain the variation\nin gas depletion time among galaxies with different masses and morphologies. In\nparticular, we can explain the long gas depletion times in spiral galaxies\ncompared to dwarf galaxies and starbursts.

The clumps show, for the first time in a \"dense\ngas tracer\", a significant correlation between HCO+ line emission from cold\nmolecular gas and Br{\\gamma} line emission of associated nebulae. This\ncorrelation arises in the HCO+ line's brightness, not its linewidth. In\ncontrast, the correlation between the N2H+ line emission and Br{\\gamma} is weak\nor absent. The HCO+/N2H+ line ratio also varies widely from clump to clump:\nbright HCO+ emission tends to be more closely associated with Br{\\gamma}\nnebulosity, while bright N2H+ emission tends to avoid areas that are bright in\nBr{\\gamma}. Both molecular species show correlations of weak significance with\ninfrared H2 v=1-0 and v=2-1 line emission, in or near the clumps. The H2\nemission line ratio is consistent with fluorescent excitation in most of the\nclumps, although thermal excitation is seen in a few clumps. We interpret these\ntrends as evidence for evolution in the gas conditions due to the effects of\nongoing star formation in the clumps, in particular, the importance of UV\nradiation from massive YSOs as the driving agent that heats the molecular gas\nand alters its chemistry. This suggests that some traditional dense gas tracers\nof molecular clouds do not sample a homogeneous population of clumps, i.e.,\nthat the HCO+ brightness in particular is directly related to the heating and\ndisruption of cold gas by massive young stars, whereas the N2H+ better samples\ngas not yet affected by this process.

We considered dynamical age (i.e. the ratio\nbetween age and half-light relaxation time) among possible second-parameters.\nWe used a set of direct N-body simulations, including ones with dark remnants\nto illustrate how core density peaks, due to core collapse, in a dynamical-age\nrange similar to that in which blue HBs are overabundant with respect to the\nmetallicity expectation, especially for low-concentration initial conditions.\nResults.

It\nhas two A-type stars in a proven binary system at the centre. However, the\nradiation from these two central stars is too soft to ionize the surrounding\nmaterial leading to a so far fruitless search for the responsible ionizing\nsource. Such a source is clearly required and has already been inferred to\nexist via an observed temporal variation of the centre-of-mass velocity of the\nA-type stars. Moreover, the ejected nebula is nitrogen-rich which raises\nquestion about the mass-loss process from a likely intermediate-mass\nprogenitor. We use optical integral-field spectroscopy to study the emission\nlines of the inner nebula ring. This has enabled us to perform an empirical\nanalysis of the optical collisionally excited lines, together with a fully\nthree-dimensional photoionization modelling. Our empirical results are used to\nconstrain the photoionization models, which determine the evolutionary stage of\nthe responsible ionizing source and its likely progenitor. The time-scale for\nthe evolutionary track of a hydrogen-rich model atmosphere is inconsistent with\nthe dynamical age obtained for the ring. This suggests that the central star\nhas undergone a very late thermal pulse. We conclude that the ionizing star\ncould be hydrogen-deficient and compatible with what is known as a PG 1159-type\nstar. The evolutionary tracks for the very late thermal pulse models imply a\ncentral star mass of ~ 0.64M${}_{\\odot}$, which originated from a ~\n3M${}_{\\odot}$ progenitor.

The\nobserved spatial scale of the maser distribution was from 9 to 4900\nastronomical units, and the following morphological categories were observed:\nelliptical, arched, linear, paired, and complex. The position of the maser spot\nwas determined to an accuracy of approximately 0.1 mas, sufficiently high to\nmeasure the internal proper motion from two years of monitoring observations.\nThe VLBI observation, however, detected only approximately 20% of all maser\nemission, suggesting that the remaining 80% of the total flux was spread into\nan undetectable extended distribution.

Using data with 1 min sampling, we find\nclear evidence that in its low state BOKS 45906 shows a flux variability on a\nperiod of 56.5574+/-0.0014 min and a semi-amplitude of ~3 percent.

We model the observed present day mass functions of the young\nGalactic Arches and Quintuplet star clusters using our rapid binary evolution\ncode.

Exploiting the effects of binary mass exchange on the cluster\nmass function, we find that the most massive stars in both clusters are\nrejuvenated products of binary mass transfer, i.e. the massive counterpart of\nclassical blue straggler stars. This resolves the problem of an apparent age\nspread among the most luminous stars exceeding the expected duration of star\nformation in these clusters.

The protostellar evolution is calculated with a detailed\nmulti-zone model, with the accretion rate regulated by feedback from an\nevolving disk-wind outflow cavity. Disk and envelope evolutions are calculated\nself-consistently. In this framework, an evolutionary track is determined by\nthree environmental initial conditions: the initial core mass M_c, the mean\nsurface density of the ambient star-forming clump Sigma_cl, and the\nrotational-to-gravitational energy ratio of the initial core, beta_c.\nEvolutionary sequences with various M_c, Sigma_cl, beta_c are constructed. We\nfind that in a fiducial model with M_c=60Msun, Sigma_cl=1 g/cm^2 and\nbeta_c=0.02, the final star formation efficiency >~0.43. For each evolutionary\ntrack, RT simulations are performed at selected stages, with temperature\nprofiles, SEDs, and images produced. At a given stage the envelope temperature\nis highly dependent on Sigma_cl, but only weakly dependent on M_c. The SED and\nMIR images depend sensitively on the evolving outflow cavity, which gradually\nwides as the protostar grows. The fluxes at <~100 microns increase\ndramatically, and the far-IR peaks move to shorter wavelengths. We find that,\ndespite scatter caused by different M_c, Sigma_cl, beta, and inclinations,\nsources at a given evolutionary stage appear in similar regions on color-color\ndiagrams, especially when using colors at >~ 70 microns, where the scatter due\nto the inclination is minimized, implying that such diagrams can be useful\ndiagnostic tools of evolutionary stages of massive protostars.

The recently discovered Galactic halo star\nSDSS J102915+172927 has a stellar mass of 0.8 Msun and a metallicity of\nZ=4.5x10^-5 Zsun and represents an optimal candidate for the dust-induced\nlow-mass star formation. Indeed, for the two most plausible Population III\nsupernova progenitors, with 20 Msun and 35 Msun, the critical dust-to-gas mass\nratio can be overcome provided that at least 0.4 Msun of dust condenses in the\nejecta, allowing for moderate destruction by the reverse shock. Here we show\nthat even if dust formation in the first supernovae is less efficient or strong\ndust destruction does occur, grain growth during the collapse of the parent gas\ncloud is sufficiently rapid to activate dust cooling and likely fragmentation\ninto low-mass and long-lived stars. Silicates and magnetite grains can\nexperience significant grain growth in the density range 10^9 /cc < nH<10^12\n/cc by accreting gas-phase species (SiO, SiO2, and Fe) until their gas-phase\nabundance drops to zero, reaching condensation efficiencies =1. The\ncorresponding increase in the dust-to-gas mass ratio allows dust-induced\ncooling and fragmentation to be activated at 10^12 /cc < nH < 10^14 /cc, before\nthe collapsing cloud becomes optically thick to continuum radiation.

We selected these clusters from our previous work, wherein we derived\ncluster radial velocities and metallicities from Calcium II infrared triplet\n(CaT) spectra also taken with the VLT. We discovered that the ages of six of\nour clusters have been appreciably underestimated by previous studies, which\nused comparatively small telescopes, graphically illustrating the need for\nlarge apertures to obtain reliable ages of old and intermediate-age SMC star\nclusters. In particular, three of these clusters, L4, L6 and L110, turn out to\nbe amongst the oldest SMC clusters known, with ages of 7.9 +- 1.1, 8.7 +- 1.2\nand 7.6 +- 1.0 Gyr, respectively, helping to fill a possible \"SMC cluster age\ngap\" (Glatt et al. 2008). Using the present ages and metallicities from Parisi\net al.

Additionally, clusters younger than aprox. 4 Gyr\nnow show better agreement with the bursting model, but we confirm that this\nmodel is not a good representation of the AMR during the intermediate-age/old\nperiod.

The normal\noutbursts within a supercycle showed a general trend that the rising rate to\nmaximum becomes slower as the next superoutburst approaches. The change can be\ninterpreted as the consequence of the increased gas-stream flow onto the inner\nregion of the disk as the result of the tilted disk.

Here we show that the preferred level of running\nalleviates small-scale issues within the $\\Lambda$CDM model, more so even than\nviable WDM models.

In addition these\nlower mass stars retain more helium at the end of the model evolution\nindicating that they are likely to be observed as type Ib supernovae rather\nthan their more massive, Wolf-Rayet counter parts. We are able to rule out\ntypical Wolf-Rayet models as the progenitor because their ejecta masses are too\nhigh and they do not fit the observed SED unless they have a massive companion\nwhich is the observed source at the supernova location.

Mapping the Dark Matter Halo Abstract: We present robust constraints from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) on the\nshape and distribution of the dark matter halo within the Milky Way (MW). Using\nthe number density distribution and kinematics of SDSS halo stars, we probe the\ndark matter distribution to heliocentric distances exceeding 10 kpc and\ngalactocentric distances exceeding 20 kpc. Our analysis utilizes Jeans\nequations to generate two-dimensional acceleration maps throughout the volume;\nthis approach is thoroughly tested on a cosmologically derived N-body+SPH\nsimulation of a MW-like galaxy. We show that the known accelerations (gradients\nof the gravitational potential) can be successfully recovered in such a\nrealistic system. Leveraging the baryonic gravitational potential derived by\nBovy & Rix (2013), we show that the gravitational potential implied by the SDSS\nobservations cannot be explained, assuming Newtonian gravity, by visible matter\nalone: the gravitational force experienced by stars at galactocentric distances\nof 20 kpc is as much as three times stronger than what can be attributed to\npurely visible matter. We also show that the SDSS data provide a strong\nconstraint on the shape of the dark matter halo potential.

The keys to reproduce this result are a low initial\nwater ice abundance after the pre-collapse phase together with the fact that\natomic oxygen cannot freeze-out and form water ice in regions with T(dust)>15\nK.

The time of quenching varies from ~2 Gyr before\naccretion (first crossing of r200,c) to >4 Gyr after, depending on satellite\nand host mass. Once begun, quenching is rapid (>~ 500 Myr) in low-mass galaxies\n(M* < 10^10 M_Sun), but significantly more protracted for more massive\nsatellites. The simulations predict a substantial role of outflows driven by\nram pressure -- but not tidal forces -- in removing the star-forming\ninterstellar matter (ISM) from satellite galaxies, especially dwarfs (M* ~ 10^9\nM_Sun) where they account for nearly two thirds of ISM loss in both groups and\nclusters. Immediately before quenching is complete, this fraction rises to ~80%\neven for Milky Way analogues (M* ~ 10^10.5 M_Sun) in groups (M_host ~ 10^13.5\nM_Sun). We show that (i) ISM stripping was significantly more effective at\nearly times than at z = 0; (ii) approximately half the gas is stripped from\n`galactic fountains' and half directly from the star forming disk; (iii)\ngalaxies undergoing stripping experience ram pressure up to ~100 times the\naverage at a given group/cluster-centric radius, because they are\npreferentially located in overdense ICM regions. Remarkably, stripping causes\nat most half the loss of the extended gas haloes surrounding our simulated\nsatellites.

But we do not confirm the view that cD\nhalos are an extra, low-surface-brightness component that is distinct from the\nmain body of a normal giant elliptical. Instead, all of the brightness profile\nof NGC 6166 outside its core is described to +- 0.037 mag/arcsec**2 by a single\nSersic function with index n ~ 8.3. The cD halo is not recognizable from\nphotometry alone. This blurs the distinction between cDs and similar-n\ncore-boxy-nonrotating ellipticals.

We examine the\nrelation between dust and gas at 10-50 pc resolution in the Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) based on Herschel far-infrared (FIR), H I 21\ncm, CO, and Halpha observations. In the diffuse atomic ISM, we derive the\ngas-to-dust ratio as the slope of the dust-gas relation and find gas-to-dust\nratios of 380+250-130 in the LMC, and 1200+1600-420 in the SMC, not including\nhelium. The atomic-to-molecular transition is located at dust surface densities\nof 0.05 Mo pc-2 in the LMC and 0.03 Mo pc-2 in the SMC, corresponding to AV ~\n0.4 and 0.2, respectively.

In the LMC, the slope of the dust-gas relation\nin the dense ISM is lower than in the diffuse ISM by a factor ~2, even after\naccounting for the effects of CO-dark H2 in the translucent envelopes of\nmolecular clouds. Coagulation of dust grains and the subsequent dust emissivity\nincrease in molecular clouds, and/or accretion of gas-phase metals onto dust\ngrains, and the subsequent dust abundance (dust-to-gas ratio) increase in\nmolecular clouds could explain the observations. In the SMC, variations in the\ndust-gas slope caused by coagulation or accretion are degenerate with the\neffects of CO-dark H2.

Abstract: The formation of very young massive clusters or \"starburst\" clusters is\ncurrently one of the most widely debated topic in astronomy. The classical\nnotion dictates that a star cluster is formed in-situ in a dense molecular gas\nclump followed by a substantial residual gas expulsion. On the other hand,\nbased on the observed morphologies of many young stellar associations, a\nhierarchical formation scenario is alternatively suggested. A very young (age\n$\\approx$ 1 Myr), massive ($>10^4M_\\odot$) star cluster like the Galactic NGC\n3603 young cluster (HD 97950) is an appropriate testbed for distinguishing\nbetween such \"monolithic\" and \"hierarchical\" formation scenarios. A recent\nstudy by Banerjee and Kroupa (2014) demonstrates that the monolithic scenario\nremarkably reproduces the HD 97950 cluster. In the present work, we explore the\npossibility of the formation of the above cluster via hierarchical assembly of\nsubclusters. These subclusters are initially distributed over a wide range of\nspatial volumes and have various modes of sub-clustering. Unlike the monolithic\nmodel that reproduces HD 97950 very well, the same is found to be prohibitive\nwith hierarchical assembly alone. Only those systems which assemble promptly\ninto a single cluster (in $\\lesssim1$ Myr) from a close separation (all within\n$\\lesssim2$ pc) could match the observed density profile of HD 97950 after\n$\\approx70$% gas dispersal. These results therefore suggest that NGC 3603 young\ncluster has formed essentially monolithically, i.e., either in-situ or via a\nprompt assembly, followed by a substantial residual gas expulsion. Both\nscenarios are consistent with the inferred young age and the small age spread\nof this cluster. Future observations of molecular cloud filaments with ALMA and\nproper motion measurements of young clusters with Gaia will provide more direct\ntests of such birth environments. [Abridged] \n\n"}

Interstellar turbulence is non-universal, with a wide range of\nMach numbers, magnetic fields strengths, and driving mechanisms. Although some\nof these parameters were explored, most previous works assumed that the gas is\nisothermal. However, we know that cold molecular clouds form out of the warm\natomic medium, with the gas passing through chemical and thermodynamic phases\nthat are not isothermal. Here we determine the role of temperature variations\nby modelling non-isothermal turbulence with a polytropic equation of state\n(EOS), where pressure and temperature are functions of gas density,\nP~rho^Gamma, T~rho^(Gamma-1). We use grid resolutions of 2048^3 cells and\ncompare polytropic exponents Gamma=0.7 (soft EOS), Gamma=1 (isothermal EOS),\nand Gamma=5/3 (stiff EOS). We find a complex network of non-isothermal\nfilaments with more small-scale fragmentation occurring for Gamma<1, while\nGamma>1 smoothes out density contrasts. The density probability distribution\nfunction (PDF) is significantly affected by temperature variations, with a\npower-law tail developing at low densities for Gamma>1. In contrast, the PDF\nbecomes closer to a lognormal distribution for Gamma<=1. We derive and test a\nnew density variance - Mach number relation that takes Gamma into account. This\nnew relation is relevant for theoretical models of the SFR and IMF, because it\ndetermines the dense gas mass fraction of a cloud, from which stars form. We\nderive the SFR as a function of Gamma and find that it decreases by a factor of\n~5 from Gamma=0.7 to Gamma=5/3. \n\n"}

Population B is characterized by a constant [20/30] flux ratio\nthroughout the HII region, heats up to $\\sim$ 75 K close to the star, and is\nless efficient in absorbing radiation pressure, forming a dust wave at 0.1 pc\nfrom the star. We conclude that the dust inside IC 434 is bimodal. The\ncharacteristics of population A are remarkable and can not be explained by\ncurrent dust models. Population B are grains that match the classical\ndescription of spherical, compact dust.

However, how they fit\ninto the unified model (UM) of AGN is still an open question. The aims of this\nwork are to study at mid-infrared (mid-IR) (1) the Compton-thick nature of\nLINERs; and (2) the disappearance of the dusty torus in LINERs predicted from\ntheoretical arguments. We have compiled all the available low spectral\nresolution mid-IR spectra of LINERs from the IRS/Spitzer (40 LINERs). We have\ncomplemented this sample with Spitzer/IRS spectra of PGQSOs, S1s, S2s, and SBs\nnuclei. We have studied the AGN versus the starburst content in our sample\nusing different indicators: the EW(PAH 6.2um), the strength of the silicate\nfeature at 9.7um, and the steepness of the mid-IR spectra. In 25 out of the 40\nLINERs (i.e., 62.5%) the mid-IR spectra are not SB-dominated, similar to the\ncomparison S2 sample (67.7%). The average spectra of both SB-dominated LINERs\nand S2s are very similar to the average spectrum of the SB class. Moreover, the\naverage spectrum of AGN-dominated LINERs with Lx(2-10keV)>10E+41 erg/s is\nsimilar to the average mid-IR spectrum of AGN-dominated S2s. However, faint\nLINERs show flat spectra different from any of the other optical classes,\nsuggesting the disappearance of the dusty torus.

Field\nline helicity offers further advantages because it preserves all topological\ninformation and can distinguish between different magnetic fields with the same\ntotal helicity. Magnetic reconnection changes field connectivity and field line\nhelicity reflects these changes; the goal of this paper is to characterize that\nevolution. We start by deriving the evolution equation for field line helicity\nand examining its terms, also obtaining a simplified form for cases where\ndynamics are localized within the domain. The main result, which we support\nusing kinematic examples, is that during localized reconnection in a complex\nmagnetic field, the evolution of field line helicity is dominated by a\nwork-like term that is evaluated at the field line endpoints, namely the scalar\nproduct of the generalized field line velocity and the vector potential.\nFurthermore, the flux integral of this term over certain areas is very small\ncompared to the integral of the unsigned quantity, which indicates that changes\nof field line helicity happen in a well-organized pairwise manner. It follows\nthat reconnection is very efficient at redistributing helicity in complex\nmagnetic fields despite having little effect on the total helicity. \n\n"}

The resulting maps of the projected structure of the young stellar\npopulations, in units of intrinsic stellar surface density, allow direct\ncomparison between different regions.

This sample doubles the\nnumber of dSph stars with measurements of [C/Fe]. The [C/Fe] ratio in the\nclusters decreases with increasing luminosity above log(L/L_sun) ~= 1.6, which\ncan be explained by deep mixing in evolved giants. The same decrease is\nobserved in dSphs, but the initial [C/Fe] of the dSph giants is not uniform.\nStars in dSphs at lower metallicities have larger [C/Fe] ratios. We hypothesize\nthat [C/Fe] (corrected to the initial carbon abundance) declines with\nincreasing [Fe/H] due to the metallicity dependence of the carbon yield of\nasymptotic giant branch stars and due to the increasing importance of Type Ia\nsupernovae at higher metallicities. We also identified 11 very carbon-rich\ngiants (8 previously known) in three dSphs.

Nonetheless, the stars with [C/Fe] < +1 in dSphs follow a\ndifferent [C/Fe] track with [Fe/H] than the halo stars. Specifically, [C/Fe] in\ndSphs begins to decline at lower [Fe/H] than in the halo.

To overcome this problem\none can use subgrid-scale (SGS) closures -- models for the influence of\nunresolved, subgrid-scales on the resolved ones. In this work we propose and\nvalidate a set of constant coefficient closures for the resolved, compressible,\nideal MHD equations. The subgrid-scale energies are modeled by Smagorinsky-like\nequilibrium closures. The turbulent stresses and the electromotive force (EMF)\nare described by expressions that are nonlinear in terms of large scale\nvelocity and magnetic field gradients. To verify the closures we conduct a\npriori tests over 137 simulation snapshots from two different codes with\nvarying ratios of thermal to magnetic pressure ($\\beta_\\mathrm{p} = 0.25, 1,\n2.5, 5, 25$) and sonic Mach numbers ($M_s = 2, 2.5, 4$).

Our\napproach combines detection of stream overdensities by a\nDifference-of-Gaussians process with fast streakline models, a continuous\nlikelihood function built from these models, and inference with MCMC. By\ngenerating $\\approx10^7$ model streams, we show that the geometry of the Pal 5\ndebris yields powerful constraints on the solar position and motion, the Milky\nWay and Pal 5 itself. All 10 model parameters were allowed to vary over large\nranges without additional prior information. Using only SDSS data and a few\nradial velocities from the literature, we find that the distance of the Sun\nfrom the Galactic Center is $8.30\\pm0.25$ kpc, and the transverse velocity is\n$253\\pm16$ km/s.

Most studies to date have compared the yields from potential\nsources (asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs), fast rotating massive stars\n(FRMS), high mass interacting binaries (IBs), and very massive stars (VMS))\nwith observations of specific elements that are observed to vary from\nstar-to-star in GCs, focussing on extreme GCs such as NGC 2808, which display\nlarge He variations. However, a consistency check between the results of\nfitting extreme cases with the requirements of more typical clusters, has\nrarely been done. Such a check is particularly timely given the constraints on\nHe abundances in GCs now available. Here we show that all of the popular\nenrichment sources fail to reproduce the observed trends in GCs, focussing\nprimarily on Na, O and He. In particular, we show that any model that can fit\nclusters like NGC 2808, will necessarily fail (by construction) to fit more\ntypical clusters like 47 Tuc or NGC 288. All sources severely over-produce He\nfor most clusters. Additionally, given the large differences in He spreads\nbetween clusters, but similar spreads observed in Na--O, only sources with\nlarge degrees of stochasticity in the resulting yields will be able to fit the\nobservations. We conclude that no enrichment source put forward so far (AGBs,\nFRMS, IBs, VMS - or combinations thereof) is consistent with the observations\nof GCs. Finally, the observed trends of increasing [N/Fe] and He spread with\nincreasing cluster mass cannot be resolved within a self-enrichment framework,\nwithout further exacerbating the mass budget problem. \n\n"}

These\nobservations are complemented with Spitzer GLIMPSE/MIPSGAL mid-IR survey data\nto help classify the elected star-forming clumps into three evolutionary\nstages: pre-stellar, proto-stellar and UCHII regions. The results suggest that\n0.05 g cm$^{-2}$ is a reliable empirical lower bound for the clump surface\ndensities required for massive-star formation to occur. The optically thick\nHCO$^{+}$(1-0) and HNC(1-0) lines, as well as the optically thin\nN$_{2}$H$^{+}$(1-0) line were used to search for infall motions toward these\nsources. By analyzing the asymmetries of the optically thick HCO$^{+}$(1-0) and\nHNC(1-0) lines and the mapping observations of HCO$^{+}$(1-0), a total of 131\nreliable infall candidates have been identified. The HCO$^{+}$(1-0) line shows\nthe highest occurrence of obvious asymmetric features, suggesting that it may\nbe a better infall motion tracer than other lines such as HNC(1-0). The\ndetection rates of infall candidates toward pre-stellar, proto-stellar and\nUCHII clumps are 0.3452, 0.3861 and 0.2152, respectively.

Only a few percent of the available gas in\nmolecular clouds forms stars, leading to the observed low star formation rate\n(SFR). The same holds when averaged over many molecular clouds, such that the\nSFR of whole galaxies is again surprisingly low. Indeed, considering the low\ntemperatures, molecular clouds should be highly gravitationally unstable and\ncollapse on their global mean freefall timescale. And yet, they are observed to\nlive about 10-100 times longer, i.e., the SFR per freefall time (SFR_ff) is\nonly a few percent. Thus, other physical mechanisms must counteract the quick\nglobal collapse. Turbulence, magnetic fields and stellar feedback have been\nproposed as regulating agents, but it is still unclear which of these processes\nis the most important and what their relative contributions are. Here we run\nhigh-resolution simulations including gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields, and\njet/outflow feedback. We confirm that clouds collapse on a mean freefall time,\nif only gravity is considered, producing stars at an unrealistic rate. In\ncontrast, if turbulence, magnetic fields, and feedback are included\nstep-by-step, the SFR is reduced by a factor of 2-3 with each additional\nphysical ingredient. When they all act in concert, we find a constant SFR_ff =\n0.04, currently the closest match to observations, but still about a factor of\n2-4 higher than the average. A detailed comparison with other simulations and\nwith observations leads us to conclude that only models with turbulence\nproducing large virial parameters, and including magnetic fields and feedback\ncan produce realistic SFRs. \n\n"}

In particular, with just a few sources studied in detail, it is\nunclear what role environment plays in complex molecule formation. In this\nlight, a comparison of relative abundances of related species between sources\nmight be useful to explain observed differences.

Aims: In this paper, we study two\ncarefully selected post-AGB stars in the LMC. The combination of favourable\natmospheric parameters for detailed abundance studies and their known distances\nmake these objects ideal probes of the internal AGB third dredge-up and\ns-process nucleosynthesis in that they provide observational constraints for\ntheoretical AGB models. Methods: We use high-resolution optical UVES spectra to\ndetermine accurate stellar parameters and perform detailed elemental abundance\nstudies. Additionally, we use available photometric data to construct SEDs for\nreddening and luminosity determinations. We then estimate initial masses from\ntheoretical post-AGB tracks. Results: Both stars show extreme s-process\nenrichment associated with relatively low C/O ratios of about 1.3. We could\nonly derive upper limits of the lead (Pb) abundance which indicate no strong Pb\noverabundances with respect to other s-elements.

The brightness of the [NII] and Halpha lines as a\nfunction of distance from W26 agrees reasonably well with observations when\nonly the line flux is considered. The radial velocity disagrees, however: the\nbrightest observed emission is blueshifted by ~25 km/s relative to the radial\nvelocity of the star, whereas a spherically symmetric wind has the brightest\nemission at zero radial velocity. Our results show that the bright nebula\nsurrounding W26 must be asymmetric; we suggest it is confined by external ram\npressure from the wind of the nearby supergiant W9. We obtain a lower limit on\nthe nitrogen abundance within the nebula of 2.35 times solar. The line ratio\nstrongly favours photoionization over shock ionization, and so even if the\nobserved nebula is pressure confined there should still be an ionization front\nand a photoionization-confined shell closer to the star. \n\n"}

Abstract: We summarise some of the recent progress in understanding the formation and\nevolution of globular clusters (GCs) in the context of galaxy formation and\nevolution. It is discussed that an end-to-end model for GC formation and\nevolution should capture four different phases: (1) star and cluster formation\nin the high-pressure interstellar medium of high-redshift galaxies, (2) cluster\ndisruption by tidal shocks in the gas-rich host galaxy disc, (3) cluster\nmigration into the galaxy halo, and (4) the final evaporation-dominated\nevolution of GCs until the present day. Previous models have mainly focussed on\nphase 4. We present and discuss a simple model that includes each of these four\nsteps - its key difference with respect to previous work is the simultaneous\naddition of the high-redshift formation and early evolution of young GCs, as\nwell as their migration into galaxy haloes. The new model provides an excellent\nmatch to the observed GC mass spectrum and specific frequency, as well as the\nrelations of GCs to the host dark matter halo mass and supermassive black hole\nmass. These results show (1) that the properties of present-day GCs are\nreproduced by assuming that they are the natural outcome of regular\nhigh-redshift star formation (i.e. they form according to same physical\nprocesses that govern massive cluster formation in the local Universe), and (2)\nthat models only including GC evaporation strongly underestimate their\nintegrated mass loss over a Hubble time. \n\n"}

Sub-filaments and\n  velocities Abstract: We show that hydrodynamic turbulent cloud simulations naturally produce large\nfilaments made up of a network of smaller and coherent sub-filaments. Such\nsimulations resemble observations of filaments and fibres in nearby molecular\nclouds. The sub-filaments are dynamical features formed at the stagnation\npoints of the turbulent velocity field where shocks dissipate the turbulent\nenergy. They are a ubiquitous feature of the simulated clouds, which appear\nfrom the beginning of the simulation and are not formed by gradual\nfragmentation of larger filaments. Most of the sub-filaments are\ngravitationally sub-critical and do not fragment into cores, however, there is\nalso a significant fraction of supercritical sub-filaments which break up into\nstar-forming cores. The sub-filaments are coherent along their length, and the\nresidual velocities along their spine show that they are subsonically\ncontracting without any ordered rotation on scales of ~0.1 pc. Accretion flows\nalong the sub-filaments can feed material into star forming cores embedded\nwithin the network. The overall mass in sub-filaments and the number of\nsub-filaments increases as the cloud evolves. We propose that the formation of\nfilaments and sub-filaments is a natural consequence of the turbulent cascade\nin the complex multi-phase interstellar medium. Sub-filaments are formed by the\nhigh wavenumber, small scale modes in the turbulent velocity field. These are\nthen stretched by local shear motions and gathered together by a combination of\nlow wavenumber modes and gravitational contraction on larger scales, and by\ndoing so build up the extended filaments observed in column density maps. \n\n"}

The data reach a\nlimiting surface brightness (1sigma) of ~1 x 10^-19 erg s^-1 cm^-2 arcsec^-2 in\nazimuthally averaged radial profiles, an order of magnitude improvement over\nprevious narrowband imaging. Our sample consists of 26 spectroscopically\nconfirmed Ly alpha-emitting, but mostly continuum-faint (m_AB >~ 27) galaxies.\nIn most objects the Ly alpha emission is considerably more extended than the UV\ncontinuum light. While 5 of the faintest galaxies in the sample show no\nsignificantly detected Ly alpha haloes, the derived upper limits suggest that\nthis is just due to insufficient S/N. Ly alpha haloes therefore appear to be\n(nearly) ubiquitous even for low-mass (~10^8-10^9 M_sun) star-forming galaxies\nat z>3. We decompose the Ly alpha emission of each object into a compact\n`continuum-like' and an extended halo component, and infer sizes and\nluminosities of the haloes. The extended Ly alpha emission approximately\nfollows an exponential surface brightness distribution with a scale length of a\nfew kpc.

Both observational\nand computational studies of star-forming massive molecular gas clouds infer\nthat massive cluster formation is primarily triggered along the small-scale\n($\\lesssim0.3$ pc) filamentary substructures within the clouds. The present\nstudy is intended to investigate the possible ways in which a\nfilament-like-compact, massive star cluster (effective radius 0.1-0.3 pc) can\nexpand $\\gtrsim10$ times, still remaining massive enough ($\\gtrsim10^4\nM_\\odot$), to become a young massive star cluster, as we observe today. To that\nend, model massive clusters (of initially $10^4 M_\\odot-10^5 M_\\odot$) are\nevolved using Sverre Aarseth's state-of-the-art N-body code NBODY7. All the\ncomputed clusters expand with time, whose sizes (effective radii) are compared\nwith those observed for young massive clusters, of age $\\lesssim100$ Myr, in\nthe Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. It is found that beginning from the\nabove compact sizes, a star cluster cannot expand by its own, i.e., due to\ntwo-body relaxation, stellar-evolutionary mass loss, dynamical heating by\nprimordial binaries and stellar-mass black holes, up to the observed sizes of\nyoung massive clusters; they always remain much more compact compared to the\nobserved ones. This calls for additional mechanisms that can boost the\nexpansion of a massive cluster after its assembly. Using further N-body\ncalculations, it is shown that a substantial residual gas expulsion, with\n$\\approx30$% star formation efficiency, can indeed swell the newborn embedded\ncluster adequately.

The old objects are distributed in a\nlarger volume than the young ones. An important fraction of PNe (>30%) was\nfound to be highly N-rich (Type I PNe). Such PNe occur at any metallicity. In\naddition, about 60% of the sample presents high ionization (He++/He >= 0.1),\npossessing a central star with effective temperature larger than 10^6 K.\nPossible biases in the sample are discussed. From comparison with stellar\nevolution models by A. Karakas's group of the observed N/O abundance ratios,\nour PNe should have had initial masses lower than 4 M_sun, although if the\ncomparison is made with Ne vs. O abundances, the initial masses should have\nbeen lower than 2 M_sun. It appears that these models of stars of 2-3 M_sun are\nproducing too much 22Ne in the stellar surface at the end of the AGB. On the\nother hand, the comparison with another set of stellar evolution models by P.\nVentura's group with a different treatment of convection and on the assumptions\nconcerning the overshoot of the convective core during the core H-burning\nphase, provided a reasonable agreement between N/O and Ne/H observed and\npredicted ratios if initial masses of more massive stars are of about 4 M_sun. \n\n"}

For the first time, we study the effect of grain surface\nchemistry (GSC) on star formation and its impact on the initial mass function\n(IMF). We follow a contracting translucent cloud in which we treat the\ngas-grain chemical interplay in detail, including the process of freeze-out. We\nperform 3d hydrodynamical simulations under three different conditions, a pure\ngas-phase model, a freeze-out model, and a complete chemistry model. The models\ndisplay different thermal evolution during cloud collapse. The equation of\nstate (EOS) of the gas becomes softer with CO freeze-out and the results show\nthat at the onset of star formation, the cloud retains its evolution history\nsuch that the number of formed stars differ (by 7%) between the three models.\nWhile the stellar mass distribution results in a different IMF when we consider\npure freeze-out, with the complete treatment of the GSC, the divergence from a\npure gas-phase model is minimal. We find that the impact of freeze-out is\nbalanced by the non-thermal processes; chemical and photodesorption. We also\nfind an average filament width of 0.12 pc ($\\pm$0.03 pc), and speculate that\nthis may be a result from the changes in the EOS caused by the gas-dust thermal\ncoupling.

Not only the jump condition on both sides of the conversion\nfront but the structures inside the front are also considered by taking into\naccount what happens during the conversion processes on the time scale of weak\ninteractions as well as equations of state (EOS's) in the mixed phase. Under\nthe assumption that HM is metastable with their free energies being larger than\nthose of 3QM but smaller than those of 2-flavor quark matter (2QM), we consider\nthe transition via 2QM triggered by a rapid density rise in a shock wave. Based\non the results, we discuss which combustion modes (strong/weak detonation) may\nbe realized. HM is described by an EOS based on the relativistic mean field\ntheory and 2, 3QM's are approximated by the MIT bag model. We demonstrate for a\nwide range of bag constant and strong coupling constant in this combination of\nEOS's that the combustion may occur in the so-called endothermic regime, in\nwhich the Hugoniot curve for combustion runs below the one for the shock wave\nin P-V plane, and which has no terrestrial counter part.

Depending on the EOS of quark matter (QM) as well as\nthe density of HM and the Mach number of the detonation front, deconfinement\nfrom HM to 2QM is either completed or not completed in the shock wave. In the\nlatter case, which is more likely if the EOS of QM ensures that deconfinement\noccurs above the nuclear saturation density and that the maximum mass of cold\nquark stars is larger than two solar mass, the conversion continues further via\nthe mixing state of HM and 3QM on the time scale of weak interactions. \n\n"}

We present tensor classification as such a technique for smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics (SPH). These methods have already been used to great\neffect in N-Body cosmological simulations, which require smoothing defined as\nan input free parameter. We show that tensor classification successfully\nidentifies a wide range of structures in SPH density fields using its native\nsmoothing, removing a free parameter from the analysis and preventing the need\nfor tesselation of the density field, as required by some classification\nalgorithms. As examples, we show that tensor classification using the tidal\ntensor and the velocity shear tensor successfully identifies filaments, shells\nand sheet structures in giant molecular cloud simulations, as well as spiral\narms in discs. The relationship between structures identified using different\ntensors illustrates how different forces compete and co-operate to produce the\nobserved density field. We therefore advocate the use of multiple tensors to\nclassify structure in SPH simulations, to shed light on the interplay of\nmultiple physical processes. \n\n"}

Our objective is to find the brightest (V<14) most\nmetal-poor stars. Methods. Candidates were selected using a new method, which\nis based on the mismatch between spectral types derived from colors and\nobserved spectral types. They were observed first at low resolution with EFOSC2\nat the NTT/ESO to obtain an initial set of stellar parameters.

If NSBM are indeed solely responsible for the solar system r-\nprocess abundances, a galaxy like our own would require to host a few NSBM per\nmillion years, with each event ejecting, on average, about 5x10^{-2} M_sun of\nr-process material. Because the ejecta velocities in the tidal tail are\nsignificantly larger than in ordinary supernovae, NSBM deposit a comparable\namount of energy into the interstellar medium (ISM). In contrast to extensive\nefforts studying spherical models for supernova remnant evolution, calculations\nquantifying the impact of NSBM ejecta in the ISM have been lacking. To better\nunderstand their evolution in a cosmological context, we perform a suite of\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with optically-thin radiative\ncooling of isolated NSBM ejecta expanding in environments with conditions\nadopted from Milky Way-like galaxy simulations. Although the remnant morphology\nis highly complex at early times, the subsequent radiative evolution that\nresults from thermal instability in atomic gas is remarkably similar to that of\na standard supernova blast wave.

We\nfocus on the total infrared luminosity from the cold-dust component\n(L_IR^(cd)), whose emission can be described by a modified black body (MBB) of\na single temperature (T_mbb). An object on the (L_IR^(cd), T_mbb) plane can be\nexplained by the equivalent of the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a MBB with an\neffective radius of R_eff. We show that R_eff is a good measure of the combined\nsize of the dusty starbursting regions (DSBRs) of the host galaxy. In at least\none case where the individual DSBRs are well resolved through strong\ngravitational lensing, R_eff is consistent with the direct size measurement. We\nshow that the observed L_IR-T relation is simply due to the limited R_eff (<~ 2\nkpc). The small R_eff values also agree with the compact sizes of the DSBRs\nseen in the local universe. However, previous interferometric observations to\nresolve high-z dusty starbursting galaxies often quote much larger sizes. This\ninconsistency can be reconciled by the blending effect when considering that\nthe current interferometry might still not be of sufficient resolution. From\nR_eff we infer the lower limits to the volume densities of the star formation\nrate (\"minSFR3D\") in the DSBRs, and find that the $L_{IR}$-$T$ relation\noutlines a boundary on the (L_IR^(cd), T) plane, below which is the \"zone of\navoidance\" in terms of minSFR3D. \n\n"}

We use\n3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to model a star with radius $10\nR_{\\odot}$ and mass $1 M_{\\odot}$, representative of the missing population of\nRGs, colliding with high density clumps.

Because the\nenvelope is unbound on account of the kinetic energy of the star, any\nsignificant amount of stripping of the RG population in the GC should be\nmirrored by a systematic decay of their orbits and possibly by their enhanced\nrotational velocity.

We derive\nelemental abundances and stellar atmosphere parameters by means of the\nclassical equivalent width method. We also performed orbit integrations using\nproper motions. The Fe abundances we derive trace a shallow negative radial\nmetallicity gradient of slope -0.027+/-0.007 dex.kpc-1 in the outer 12 kpc of\nthe disk. The [alpha/Fe] gradient appears flat, with a slope of 0.006+/-0.007\ndex.kpc-1 . The two outermost clusters (Be 29 and Sau 1) appear to follow\nelliptical orbits. Be 20 also exhibits a peculiar orbit with a large excursion\nabove the plane. The irregular orbits of the three most metal-poor clusters (of\nwhich two are located at the edge of the Galactic disk), if confirmed by more\nrobust astrometric measurements such as those of the Gaia mission, are\ncompatible with an inside-out formation scenario for the Milky Way, in which\nextragalactic material is accreted onto the outer disk. We cannot determine if\nBe 20, Be 29,and Sau 1 are of extragalactic origin, as they may be old genuine\nGalactic clusters whose orbits were perturbed by accretion events or minor\nmergers in the past 5 Gyr, or they may be representants of the thick disk\npopulation.

The\nformyl radical HCO is an important candidate precursor for several O-bearing\nterrestrial COMs in cores, as an abundant building block of many of these\nmolecules. Several chemical routes have been proposed to account for its\nformation, both on grain surfaces, as an incompletely hydrogenated product of H\naddition to frozen-out CO molecules, or in the gas phase, either the product of\nthe reaction between H2CO and a radical, or as a product of dissociative\nrecombination of protonated formaldehyde H2COH+. The detection and abundance\ndetermination of H2COH+, if present, could provide clues as to whether this\nlatter scenario might apply. We searched for protonated formaldehyde H2COH+ in\nthe prestellar core L1689B using the IRAM 30m telescope. The H2COH+ ion is\nunambiguously detected, for the first time in a cold (~10 K) source.

We use\nasteroseismic data of red giants, observed by Kepler, to test the current\ntheoretical framework of modelling the Galaxy based on population synthesis\nmodeling and the use of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants. We use the\nopen source code Galaxia to model the Milky Way and find the distribution of\nthe masses predicted by Galaxia to be systematically offset with respect to the\nseismically-inferred observed masses. The Galactic model overestimates the\nnumber of low mass stars, and these stars are predominantly old and of low\nmetallicity. Using corrections to the $\\Delta \\nu$ scaling relation suggested\nby stellar models (available for download) significantly reduces the\ndisagreement between predicted and observed masses. For a few cases where\nnon-seismic mass estimates are available, the corrections to $\\Delta \\nu$ also\nimprove the agreement between seismic and non-seismic mass estimates.

We study\nthe formation of a gaseous proto-cluster inside a molecular cloud by performing\nhigh resolution MHD simulations and associate its internal properties to those\nof the parent cloud by varying the level of the initial turbulence of the\ncloud, with a view to better characterize the subsequent stellar cluster\nformation. The gaseous proto-cluster is formed out of global collapse of a\nmolecular cloud, and has non-negligible rotation due to angular momentum\nconservation during the collapse of the object. Most of the star formation\noccurs in this region which occupies only a small volume fraction of the whole\ncloud.

We observe an anti-correlation of C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ in NGC\n1333-IRAS4A, NGC 1333-IRAS4B, L1157, and L1448C, with N$_2$H$^+$ forming a ring\naround the centrally peaked C$^{18}$O emission due to N$_2$H$^+$ being\nchemically destroyed by CO. The emission regions of models and observations\nmatch for a CO binding energy of 1200 K, which is higher than the binding\nenergy of pure CO ices ($\\sim$855 K).

The flattened envelope is detected\nin C18O, extending out to >~ 2400 AU from the VLA 1 source. It has a\ndifferential rotation, with the outer part (>~ 2000 AU) better described by a\nrotation that has constant specific angular momentum and the innermost part (<~\n160 AU) by a Keplerian rotation.

In parallel, recent studies have also proved that DIBs\nextracted from stellar spectra constitute new tools for building the 3D\nstructure of the Galactic Interstellar Medium (ISM).

Choosing an appropriate cut along the filament\nmajor axis, we minimize the impact of the filament emission on the modeling.\nFor the bulk of the core (5000-20000 au) an isothermal sphere model with a\ntemperature of around 10 K provides the best fits.

In this paper (PaperII), we explore the\nreliability of the measured total gas mass, dust surface density and dust\ntemperature maps derived from modified blackbody fitting of synthetic Herschel\nobservations. We found from our pixel-by-pixel analysis of the measured dust\nsurface density and dust temperature a worrisome error spread especially close\nto star-formation sites and low-density regions, where for those \"contaminated\"\npixels the surface densities can be under/overestimated by up to three orders\nof magnitude. In light of this, we recommend to treat the pixel-based results\nfrom this technique with caution in regions with active star formation. In\nregions of high background typical in the inner Galactic plane, we are not able\nto recover reliable surface density maps of individual synthetic regions, since\nlow-mass regions are lost in the FIR background. When measuring the total gas\nmass of regions in moderate background, we find that modified blackbody fitting\nworks well (absolute error:+9%;-13%) up to 10kpc distance (errors increase with\ndistance).

The idea is that the low-mass,\npre-main sequence stars sweep up gas expelled by the massive stars of the same\ngeneration into their protoplanetary disc as they move through the GC core. We\nperform simulations with 2 different smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes to\ninvestigate if a low-mass star surrounded by a protoplanetary disc can accrete\nthe amount of enriched material required in this scenario. We focus on the gas\nloading rate onto the disc and star as well as on the lifetime of the disc. We\nfind that the gas loading rate is a factor of 2 smaller than the geometric\nrate, because the effective cross section of the disc is smaller than its\nsurface area. The loading rate is consistent for both codes, irrespective of\nresolution. The disc gains mass in the high resolution runs, but loses angular\nmomentum on a time scale of 10^4 yrs. Two effects determine the loss of\n(specific) angular momentum in our simulations: 1) continuous ram pressure\nstripping and 2) accretion of material with no azimuthal angular momentum. Our\nstudy and previous work suggest that the former, dominant process is mainly\ncaused by numerical rather than physical effects, while the latter is not.

Leading candidates for their origin are\nblue supergiant collapsars, magnetars, and white dwarf tidal disruption events\n(WD-TDEs) caused by massive black holes (BHs). Recent observations of\nsupernova-like (SN-like) bumps associated with ulGRBs challenged both the\nWD-TDE and the blue supergiant models because of the detection of SNe and the\nabsence of hydrogen lines, respectively. We propose that WD-TDEs can\naccommodate the observed SN-like bumps if the fallback WD matter releases\nenergy into the unbound WD ejecta. The observed ejecta energy, luminosity, and\nvelocity are explained by the gravitational energy, Eddington luminosity, and\nescape velocity of the formed accretion disk, respectively. We also show that\nthe observed X-rays can ionize the ejecta, eliminating lines. The SN-like light\ncurves (SN 2011kl) for the ulGRB 111209A are consistent with all three models,\nalthough a magnetar model is unnatural because the spin-down time required to\npower the SN-like bump is a hundred times longer than the GRB.

This suggests that Hercules may be dissolving under the Milky\nWay's gravitational influence, and hence could be a tidal stream in formation\nrather than a bound, dark-matter dominated satellite. Using Bayesian inference\nin combination with N-body simulations, we show that Hercules has to be on a\nvery eccentric orbit (epsilon~0.95) within the Milky Way in this scenario. On\nsuch an orbit, Hercules \"explodes\" as a consequence of the last tidal shock at\npericenter 0.5 Gyr ago. It is currently decelerating towards apocenter of its\norbit with a velocity of V=157 km/s -- of which 99% is directed radially\noutwards. Due to differential orbital precession caused by the non-spherical\nnature of the Galactic potential, its debris fans out nearly perpendicular to\nits orbit. This explains why Hercules has an elongated shape without showing a\ndistance gradient along its main body: it is in fact a stream that is\nsignificantly broader than it is long. In other words, it is moving\nperpendicular to its apparent major axis. In this scenario, there is a spike in\nthe radial velocity profile created by the dominant debris component that\nformed through the last pericenter passage. This is similar to kinematic\nsubstructure that is observed in the real Hercules. Modeling a satellite on\nsuch a highly eccentric orbit is strongly dependent on the form of the Galactic\npotential. We therefore propose that detailed kinematic investigation of\nHercules and other exploding satellite candidates can yield strong constraints\non the potential of the Milky Way. \n\n"}

Summary of the astrometric, photometric, and survey\n  properties Abstract: At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data\nrelease, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion\nsources brighter than magnitude 20.7. We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide\nillustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion\nof the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1\nconsists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,\nparallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars\nin common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric\ndata set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The\nsecond component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band\nmagnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the\ntypical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas. The median uncertainties on\nthe mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to ~0.03 mag over the\nmagnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping\nof the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin\nobservational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this\nfirst Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the\ndata quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions\nfrom the data. \n\n"}

The existence of these high-mass stars that\napparently formed in the field challenges the generally accepted paradigm,\nwhich requires star formation to occur in clustered environments.

The global\nnature of the collapse implies that the SFR increases over time. The\nhierarchical nature of the collapse consists of small-scale collapses within\nlarger-scale ones. The large-scale collapses culminate a few Myr later than the\nsmall-scale ones and consist of filamentary flows that accrete onto massive\ncentral clumps. The small-scale collapses form clumps that are embedded in the\nfilaments and falling onto the large-scale collapse centers. The stars formed\nin the early, small-scale collapses share the infall motion of their parent\nclumps. Thus, the filaments feed both gaseous and stellar material to the\nmassive central clump. This leads to the presence of a few older stars in a\nregion where new protostars are forming, and also to a self-similar structure,\nin which each unit is composed of smaller-scale sub-units that approach each\nother and may merge. Because the older stars formed in the filaments share the\ninfall motion of the gas onto the central clump, they tend to have larger\nvelocities and to be distributed over larger areas than the younger stars\nformed in the central clump. Finally, interpreting the IMF at face-value as a\nprobability distribution implies that massive stars only form once the {\\it\nlocal} SFR is large enough to sample the IMF up to high masses. In combination\nwith the increase of the SFR, this implies that massive stars tend to appear\nlate in the evolution of the MC, and only in the central massive clumps.

We find that L_X\n\\propto SFR^{0.83} x (1+z)^{1.3}, where the redshift evolution and\nnon-linearity likely reflect changes in high-mass X-ray binary populations of\nstar-forming galaxies. Using galaxies with a broader range of SFR, we also\nconstrain a stellar-mass-dependent contribution to L_X, likely related to\nlow-mass X-ray binaries. Using this calibration, we convert our X-ray main\nsequence to SFRs and measure a star-forming main sequence with a constant slope\n~0.76+/-0.06 and a normalization that evolves with redshift as\n(1+z)^{2.95+/-0.33}. Based on the X-ray emission, there is no evidence for a\nbreak in the main sequence at high stellar masses, although we cannot rule out\na turnover given the uncertainties in the scaling of L_X to SFR. \n\n"}

Abstract: Supermassive stars (SMS; ~ 10^5 M_sun) formed from metal-free gas in the\nearly Universe attract attention as progenitors of supermassive black holes\nobserved at high redshifts. To form SMSs by accretion, central protostars must\naccrete at as high rates as ~ 0.1-1 M_sun/yr. Such protostars have very\nextended structures with bloated envelopes, like super-giant stars, and are\ncalled super-giant protostars (SGPSs). Under the assumption of hydrostatic\nequilibrium, SGPSs have density inverted layers, where the luminosity becomes\nlocally super-Eddington, near the surface. If the envelope matter is allowed to\nflow out, however, a stellar wind could be launched and hinder the accretion\ngrowth of SGPSs before reaching the supermassive regime. We examine whether\nradiation-driven winds are launched from SGPSs by constructing steady and\nspherically symmetric wind solutions. We find that the wind velocity does not\nreach the escape velocity in any case considered. This is because once the\ntemperature falls below ~ 10^4 K, the opacity plummet drastically owing to the\nrecombination of hydrogen and the acceleration ceases suddenly. This indicates\nthat, in realistic non-steady cases, even if outflows are launched from the\nsurface of SGPSs, they would fall back again. Such a \"wind\" does not result in\nnet mass loss and does not prevent the growth of SGPSs. In conclusion, SGPSs\nwill grow to SMSs and eventually collapse to massive BHs of ~ 10^5 M_sun, as\nlong as the rapid accretion is maintained. \n\n"}

The inferred individual distances provide an intrinsic mean value for\nthe SMC distance modulus of 19.01 mag and a standard deviation of 0.08 mag, in\nagreement with the literature.

We find two distinct modes of accretion depending\non the resistivity and field strength. A small resistivity or high field\nstrength promotes the development of rapidly infalling `avalanche accretion\nstreams' in a vertically extended disk envelope that dominates the dynamics of\nthe system, especially the mass accretion. The streams are suppressed in\nsimulations with larger resistivities or lower field strengths, where most of\nthe accretion instead occurs through a laminar disk. In these simulations, the\ndisk accretion is driven mainly by a slow wind that is typically accelerated by\nthe pressure gradient from a predominantly toroidal magnetic field. Both\nwind-dominated and stream-dominated modes of accretion create prominent\nfeatures in the surface density distribution of the disk, including rings and\ngaps, with a strong spatial variation of the magnetic flux relative to the\nmass.

Integrated-light spectra were obtained by scanning the\nslit of the UVES spectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope across the\nhalf-light diameters of the clusters. We modelled the spectra using resolved\nHST colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), as well as theoretical isochrones, in\ncombination with standard stellar atmosphere and spectral synthesis codes. The\nabundances of Fe, Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ba were compared with literature data\nfor individual stars in the clusters. The typical differences between iron\nabundances derived from our integrated-light spectra and those compiled from\nthe literature are less than 0.1 dex. A larger difference is found for one\ncluster (NGC 6752), and is most likely caused primarily by stochastic\nfluctuations in the numbers of bright red giants within the scanned area. As\nexpected, the alpha-elements (Ca, Ti) are enhanced by about 0.3 dex compared to\nthe Solar-scaled composition, while the [Cr/Fe] ratios are close to Solar. When\nusing up-to-date line lists, our [Mg/Fe] ratios also agree well with literature\ndata.

The competitive\naccretion theory of massive star formation posits that the most massive stars\nshould sit in deeper potential wells than lower-mass stars. This may be\nobservable in the relative surface density or spatial concentration of the most\nmassive stars compared to other, lower-mass stars. Massive stars in\ncool--collapse N-body models do end up in significantly deeper potentials, and\nare mass segregated. However, in models of warm (expanding) star-forming\nregions, whilst the massive stars do come to be in deeper potentials than\naverage stars, they are not mass segregated. In the purely hydrodynamical SPH\nsimulations, the massive stars do come to reside in deeper potentials, which is\ndue to their runaway growth. However, when photoionisation and stellar winds\nare implemented in the simulations, these feedback mechanisms regulate the mass\nof the stars and disrupt the inflow of gas into the clouds' potential wells.\nThis generally makes the potential wells shallower than in the control runs,\nand prevents the massive stars from occupying deeper potentials. This in turn\nresults in the most massive stars having a very similar spatial concentration\nand surface density distribution to lower-mass stars. Whilst massive stars do\nform via competitive accretion in our simulations, this rarely translates to a\ndifferent spatial distribution and so any lack of primordial mass segregation\nin an observed star-forming region does not preclude competitive accretion as a\nviable formation mechanism for massive stars. \n\n"}

It is then important to study variations of evolutionary\nchannels for merging BHs, which might instead form accreting BHs and become\nULXs. It was recently shown that massive binaries with mass ratios close to\nunity and tight orbits can undergo efficient rotational mixing and evolve\nchemically homogeneously, resulting in a compact BH binary. We study similar\nsystems by computing ~120000 detailed binary models with the MESA code covering\na wide range of initial parameters. For initial mass ratios M2/M1~0.1-0.4,\nprimaries >40Msun can evolve chemically homogeneously, remaining compact and\nforming a BH without undergoing Roche-lobe overflow. The secondary then expands\nand transfers mass to the BH, initiating a ULX phase. We predict that ~1 out of\n10^4 massive stars evolves this way, and that in the local universe 0.13 ULXs\nper Msun yr^-1 of star-formation rate are observable, with a strong preference\nfor low-metallicities. At metallicities log Z>-3, BH masses in ULXs are limited\nto 60Msun due to the occurrence of pair-instability supernovae which leave no\nremnant, resulting in an X-ray luminosity cut-off. At lower metallicities, very\nmassive stars can avoid exploding as pair-instability supernovae and instead\nform BHs with masses above 130Msun, producing a gap in the ULX luminosity\ndistribution. After the ULX phase, neutron-star-BH binaries that merge in less\nthan a Hubble time are produced with a formation rate <0.2 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. We\nexpect that upcoming X-ray observatories will test these predictions, which\ntogether with additional gravitational wave detections will provide strict\nconstraints on the origin of the most massive BHs that can be produced by\nstars. \n\n"}

Dust scattering was\nrecently recognized as a potential contributor to polarization, although its\nbasic properties have yet to be thoroughly explored. Here, we quantify the\neffects of optical depth on the scattering-induced polarization in inclined\ndisks through a combination of analytical illustration, approximate\nsemi-analytical modeling using formal solution to the radiative transfer\nequation, and Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the near-side of the disk\nis significantly brighter in polarized intensity than the far-side, provided\nthat the disk is optically thick and that the scattering grains have yet to\nsettle to the midplane. This asymmetry is the consequence of a simple geometric\neffect: the near-side of the disk surface is viewed more edge-on than the\nfar-side. It is a robust signature that may be used to distinguish the\nscattering-induced polarization from that by other mechanisms, such as aligned\ngrains. The asymmetry is weaker for a geometrically thinner dust disk. As such,\nit opens an exciting new window on dust settling. We find anecdotal evidence\nfrom dust continuum imaging of edge-on disks that large grains are not yet\nsettled in the youngest (Class 0) disks, but become more so in older disks.\nThis trend is corroborated by the polarization data in inclined disks showing\nthat younger disks have more pronounced near-far side asymmetry and thus less\ngrain settling.

However, we find that\nthe number-density/luminosity of such sources at high redshifts has been\nseverely over-estimated by studies that have attempted to push the\nhighly-confused Herschel SPIRE surveys beyond z~2. Consequently we confirm\nrecent reports that cosmic star-formation density is dominated by UV-visible\nstar formation at z>4. Using both direct (1/Vmax) and maximum likelihood\ndeterminations of the LF, we find that its high-redshift evolution is well\ncharacterized by continued positive luminosity evolution coupled with negative\ndensity evolution (with increasing redshift). This explains why bright sub-mm\nsources continue to be found at z>5, even though their integrated contribution\nto cosmic star-formation density at such early times is very small. The\nevolution of the far-IR galaxy LF thus appears similar in form to that already\nestablished for active galactic nuclei, possibly reflecting a similar\ndependence on the growth of galaxy mass. \n\n"}

The stellar evolution was computed using\nthe STELLAR evolution code developed by Yorke & Bodenheimer with recent\nmodifications by Hosokawa et al. The mass accretion rates were taken from\nnumerical hydrodynamics models of Vorobyov & Basu computing the circumstellar\ndisk evolution starting from the gravitational collapse of pre-stellar cloud\ncores of various mass and angular momentum. The resulting stellar evolution\ntracks were compared with the isochrones and isomasses calculated using\nnon-accreting models. We find that mass accretion in the initial several Myr of\nprotostellar evolution can have a strong effect on the subsequent evolution of\nyoung stars and brown dwarfs. The disagreement between accreting and\nnon-accreting models in terms of the total stellar luminosity L_st, stellar\nradius R_st and effective temperature T_eff depends on the thermal efficiency\nof accretion, i.e., on the fraction of accretion energy absorbed by the central\nobject. The largest mismatch is found for the cold accretion case, in which\nessentially all accretion energy is radiated away. The relative deviations in\nL_st and R_st in this case can reach 50% for 1.0-Myr-old objects and remain\nnotable even for 10-Myr-old objects. In the hot and hybrid accretion cases, in\nwhich a constant fraction of accretion energy is absorbed, the disagreement\nbetween accreting and non-accreting models becomes less pronounced, but still\nremains notable for 1.0-Myr-old objects.

The Early Break-Out Phase Abstract: In this series of papers, we model the formation and evolution of the\nphotoionized region and its observational signatures during massive star\nformation. Here we focus on the early break out of the photoionized region into\nthe outflow cavity. Using results of 3-D magnetohydrodynamic-outflow\nsimulations and protostellar evolution calculations, we perform post-processing\nradiative-transfer. The photoionized region first appears at a protostellar\nmass of 10Msun in our fiducial model, and is confined to within 10-100AU by the\ndense inner outflow, similar to some observed very small hypercompact HII\nregions. Since the ionizing luminosity of the massive protostar increases\ndramatically as Kelvin-Helmholz (KH) contraction proceeds, the photoionized\nregion breaks out to the entire outflow region in <10,000yr. Accordingly, the\nradio free-free emission brightens significantly in this stage. In our fiducial\nmodel, the radio luminosity at 10 GHz changes from 0.1 mJy kpc2 at m=11Msun to\n100 mJy kpc2 at 16Msun, while the infrared luminosity increases by less than a\nfactor of two. The radio spectral index also changes in the break-out phase\nfrom the optically thick value of 2 to the partially optically thin value of\n0.6. Additionally, we demonstrate that short-timescale variation in free-free\nflux would be induced by an accretion burst. The outflow density is enhanced in\nthe accretion burst phase, which leads to a smaller ionized region and weaker\nfree-free emission. The radio luminosity may decrease by one order of magnitude\nduring such bursts, while the infrared luminosity is much less affected, since\ninternal protostellar luminosity dominates over accretion luminosity after KH\ncontraction starts. Such variability may be observable on timescales as short\n10-100 yr, if accretion bursts are driven by disk instabilities. \n\n"}

We present a mechanism\nthat causes such a spin-orbit misalignment for a protoplanetary disc due to its\nmovement through an ambient medium. Our physical explanation of the mechanism\nis based on the theoretical solutions to the Stark problem. We test this idea\nby performing self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations and simplified\ngravitational $N$-body simulations.

The hydrodynamical simulations show the\nmechanism in its full extent, including gas-dynamical and viscous processes in\nthe disc which are not included in the theoretical framework. We find that a\nprotoplanetary disc embedded in a flow changes its orientation as its angular\nmomentum vector tends to align parallel to the relative velocity vector. Due to\nthe force exerted by the flow, orbits in the disc become eccentric, which\nproduces a net torque and consequentially changes the orbital inclination.

Furthermore, the morphology of\nthe polarization vectors at 3.1 mm is completely different from those at 1.3\nmm. We interpret that the polarization at 3.1 mm to be dominated by the grain\nalignment with the radiative flux producing azimuthal polarization vectors,\nwhile the self-scattering dominates at 1.3 mm and produces the polarization\nvectors parallel to the minor axis of the disk.

This depression is much greater than that\nexpected from the neglect of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects, in\nparticular the dominant effect of overionisation. Here we attempt to reproduce\nthe apparent Fe discrepancy, and investigate differences in reported sodium\nabundances. We compare in detail the methods and results of the recent study\nwith those of an earlier study of NGC 6752 AGB stars. Iron and sodium\nabundances are derived using Fe I, Fe II, and Na I lines. Various uncertainties\nare explored. We reproduce the large Fe I depression found by the recent study,\nusing different observational data and computational tools. Further\ninvestigation shows that the degree of the apparent Fe I depression is strongly\ndependent on the adopted stellar effective temperature. To minimise\nuncertainties in Fe I we derive temperatures for each star individually using\nthe infrared flux method (IRFM). We find that the $T_{\\rm{eff}}$ scales used by\nboth the previous studies are cooler, by up to 100 K; such underestimated\ntemperatures amplify the apparent Fe I depression. Our IRFM temperatures result\nin negligible apparent depression, consistent with theory.

We use a set of\nhydrodynamic simulations to determine the structure of discs forming in\ncollapsing molecular clouds. We examine how radiative feedback from the host\nprotostar affects the disc properties by examining three regimes: without\nradiative feedback, with continuous radiative feedback and with episodic\nfeedback, similar to FU Ori-type outbursts. We find that the radial surface\ndensity and temperature profiles vary significantly as the disc accretes gas\nfrom the infalling envelope. These profiles are sensitive to the presence of\nspiral structure, induced by gravitational instabilities, and the radiative\nfeedback provided by the protostar, especially in the case when the feedback is\nepisodic.

The total flux-density variability at 1.3mm is found, in general, to\nbe faster, and to have larger amplitude and flatter PSD slopes than 3.5mm. The\npolarisation degree is on average larger at 1.3mm than at 3.5mm, by a factor of\n2.6. The variability of linear polarisation degree is faster and has higher\nfractional amplitude than for total flux density, with the typical time scales\nduring prominent polarisation peaks being significantly faster at 1.3mm than at\n3.5mm. The polarisation angle at both 3.5 and 1.3mm is highly variable.

An important difference between these two cases\nis the nucleosynthetic yield, which is altered by the increased neutron excess\nin Chandrasekhar progenitors due to their pre-explosion simmering and high\ncentral density.\n  From comparison with theoretical nucleosynthesis yields, we show that the\nchemical composition of the most metal-rich star in the Ursa Minor dwarf\ngalaxy, COS 171, is dominated by nucleosynthesis from a low-metallicity,\nlow-mass, sub-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia. Key diagnostic abundance ratios include\nC/Fe, {\\alpha}/Fe, Mn/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios, which could not have been produced\nby Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia, Core-Collapse Type II supernovae or\nPair-Instsability supernovae. Strong deficiencies of Ni/Fe, Cu/Fe and Zn/Fe\nalso suggest the absence of alpha-rich freeze-out nucleosynthesis, favoring\nlow-mass WD progenitor SNe Ia.

Radial variations in M87's\n  IMF Abstract: We present the first constraints on stellar mass-to-light ratio gradients in\nan early-type galaxy (ETG) using multiple dynamical tracer populations to model\nthe dark and luminous mass structure simultaneously. We combine the kinematics\nof the central starlight, two globular cluster populations and satellite\ngalaxies in a Jeans analysis to obtain new constraints on M87's mass structure,\nemploying a flexible mass model which allows for radial gradients in the\nstellar mass-to-light ratio.

Velocity gradients detected along three filaments\nindicate that they are collapsing with a total mass infall rate of about 440\n$M_\\odot$ Myr$^{-1}$, suggesting the hub mass would be doubled in six free-fall\ntimes, adding up to $ \\sim2 $ Myr.

We applied the obtained O$_2$ transmittance to K I\n$D_2$ synthetic polarimetric spectra and found that in the absence of\nline-of-sight motions, the residual O$_2$ has a negligible effect on the K I\n$D_2$ line.

In this context, the magnetic field is\ndragged by the collapsing gas, so its structure must reflect the flow that\ngenerates the filament. Around the filament, the gas is accreted onto it, and\nthe magnetic lines must then be perpendicular to the filament. As the gas\ndensity increases, the gas flow changes direction, becoming almost parallel to\nthe filament, and magnetic lines also tend to align with it. At the spine of\nthe filament, however, magnetic lines become perpendicular again since they\nmust connect to lines on the opposite side of the filament, resulting in\n\"U\"-shaped magnetic structures, which tend to be stretched by the longitudinal\nflow along the filament.

Another four sources, two disks and two protostars, show\nmoderately-enhanced standard deviations in brightness, as expected for\nstochastic variables.

The ensemble distribution of slopes is well fit by a normal\ndistribution with sigma ~ 0.023. Most sources are not rapidly brightening or\nfading in the sub-mm.

Nonetheless, Ting et al. (2017) were recently able to demonstrate\nthat oxygen abundances can be determined from low-resolution (R$\\simeq$2000)\noptical spectra. Here we investigate the physical processes that enable such a\nmeasurement for cool stars, such as K-giants. We show that the strongest\nspectral diagnostics of oxygen come from the CNO atomic-molecular network, but\nare manifested in spectral features that do not involve oxygen. In the outer\natmosphere layers most of the carbon is locked up in CO, and changes to the\noxygen abundance directly affect the abundances of all other carbon-bearing\nmolecules, thereby changing the strength of CH, CN, and C$_2$ features across\nthe optical spectrum. In deeper atmosphere layers most of the carbon is in\natomic form, and any change in the oxygen abundance has little effect on the\nother carbon-bearing molecules. The key physical effect enabling such oxygen\nabundance measurements is that spectral features in the optical arise from both\nthe CO-dominant and the atomic carbon-dominant regions, providing\nnon-degenerate constraints on both C and O.

Of all maser species, methanol is one of the\nstrongest and most abundant tracers of gas around high-mass protostellar disks\nand in outflows.

I present here the application of an\naffine invariant Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler (emcee) to\nthe DAMOCLES code in order to investigate the multi-dimensional parameter space\nrigorously and characterise the posterior probability distribution. A\nlikelihood function is formulated that handles both Monte Carlo and\nobservational uncertainties. This Bayesian approach is applied to four\nsimulated line profiles in order to test the method and investigate its\nefficacy. The majority of parameters can be tightly constrained using this\nmethod, and a strong (predictable) dependence between the grain size and the\ndust mass is quantified.

These\nmassive GCs are assumed to show UV upturns similar to those observed recently\nin M87, the central giant elliptical galaxy in the Virgo cluster of galaxies.\nData taken from the literature reveals a strong correlation between the\nstrength of the UV upturn and the specific frequency of metal-rich GCs in ETGs.\nAdopting a Schechter function parametrization of GC mass functions, simulations\nof long-term dynamical evolution of GC systems show that the observed\ncorrelation between UV upturn strength and GC specific frequency can be\nexplained by variations in the characteristic truncation mass ${\\cal{M}}_{\\rm\nc}$ such that ${\\cal{M}}_{\\rm c}$ increases with ETG luminosity in a way that\nis consistent with observed GC luminosity functions in ETGs.

By using a large number of chemo-dynamical 2D test-particle\nsimulations with a rotating bar and/or spiral arms, we find that the observed\n[Fe/H] dependence of the Hercules stream is a natural consequence of the\ninside-out formation of the stellar disc and the existence of highly non-closed\norbits in the rotating frame of the bar or spiral arms. Our successful models\nthat reproduce the observed properties of the Hercules stream include not only\nfast-bar-only and fast-bar+spiral models, but also slow-bar+spiral models.

In this paper, we investigate the\nhypothesis that only certain mass accretion rates result in detectable bandhead\nemission in the near infrared spectra of MYSOs. Using an analytic disc model\ncombined with an LTE model of the CO emission, we find that high accretion\nrates ($\\gtrsim 10^{-4}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}{\\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$) result in large\ndust sublimation radii, a larger contribution to the $K$-band continuum from\nhot dust at the dust sublimation radius, and therefore correspondingly lower CO\nemission with respect to the continuum.

In general, moderate accretion\nrates produce the most prominent, and therefore detectable, CO first overtone\nemission. We compare our findings to a recent near-infrared spectroscopic\nsurvey of MYSOs, finding results consistent with our hypothesis.

We have developed a Bayesian method that generates 2D probability\nmaps of a star's age and metallicity from photometry and parallax using\nisochrones. Our synthetic tests show that including a near-UV passband enables\nus to break the degeneracy between a star's age and metallicity for certain\nevolutionary stages. It is possible to find well-constrained ages and\nmetallicities for turn-off and sub-giant stars with colours including a U band\nand a parallax with uncertainty less than ~20%. Metallicities alone are\npossible for the main sequence and giant branch. We find good agreement with\nthe literature when we apply our method to the Gaia benchmark stars,\nparticularly for turn-off and young stars.

The model\nof the most prominent object (Main) contains the most massive (proto)star\n($M_\\star\\approx7~M_\\odot$) and disc+envelope\n($M_\\mathrm{gas}\\approx0.4~M_\\odot$), and is the most luminous\n($L_\\mathrm{Main} \\sim 10^4~L_\\odot$). The model discs are small (a few hundred\nau) for all sources. The composite model shows that the elongated spiral-like\nfeature converging to the MM1 core can be convincingly interpreted as a\nfilamentary accretion flow that feeds the rising stellar system. The kinematics\nof this filament is reproduced by a parabolic trajectory with focus at the\ncenter of mass of the region. Radial collapse and fragmentation within this\nfilament, as well as smaller filamentary flows between pairs of sources are\nproposed to exist. Our modelling supports an interpretation where what was once\nconsidered as a single massive star with a $\\sim 10^3$ au disc and envelope, is\ninstead a forming stellar association which appears to be virialized and to\nform several low-mass stars per high-mass object. \n\n"}

We describe\nsome of the selections that can be made in Gaia DR2 to highlight the main\nstructures of the Gaia HRDs. We select both field and cluster (open and\nglobular) stars, compare the observations with previous classifications and\nwith stellar evolutionary tracks, and we present variations of the Gaia HRD\nwith age, metallicity, and kinematics. Late stages of stellar evolution such as\nhot subdwarfs, post-AGB stars, planetary nebulae, and white dwarfs are also\nanalysed, as well as low-mass brown dwarf objects. The Gaia HRDs are\nunprecedented in both precision and coverage of the various Milky Way stellar\npopulations and stellar evolutionary phases. Many fine structures of the HRDs\nare presented. The clear split of the white dwarf sequence into hydrogen and\nhelium white dwarfs is presented for the first time in an HRD. The relation\nbetween kinematics and the HRD is nicely illustrated.

It seems possible that\nthe proposed mechanism acting in individual giant molecular clouds may produce\nsignificant abundance effects for masses corresponding to single stars or small\ngroups of stars.

To achieve this we\ndevelop appropriate stellar population synthesis models and take into account,\nfor the first time, an initial-final mass relation which takes into\nconsideration a varying He abundance. We conclude that while the multiple\npopulations may be present in massive early-type galaxies, they are likely not\nresponsible for the observed variations in the mass- to-light ratio and IMF\nsensitive line strengths. Finally, we estimate the fraction of stars with\nmultiple populations chemistry that come from disrupted globular clusters\nwithin massive ellipticals and find that they may explain some of the observed\nchemical patterns in the centres of these galaxies. \n\n"}

This scenario therefore contrasts with the simplified classic paradigm\nof a stable disk+jet system, which is the standard model for low-mass star\nformation, and provides an experimental confirmation of a multi-directional and\nunsteady accretion model for massive star formation. \n\n"}

However, we will report three important findings\nregarding the chemical evolution and the detectability of interstellar glycine.\nFirst, with the experimentally obtained binding energy from the temperature\nprogrammed thermal desorption (TPD) experiment, a large proportion of glycine\nwas destroyed through the grain surface reactions with NH or CH$_3$O radicals\nbefore it fully evaporates. As a result, the formation process in the gas phase\nis more important than thermal evaporation from grains. If this is the case,\nNH$_2$OH and CH$_3$COOH rather than CH$_3$NH$_2$ and CH$_2$NH would be the\nessential precursors to the gas phase glycine. Secondly, since the gas phase\nglycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, early\nevolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the\nfuture glycine surveys. Thirdly, we suggest the possibility that the\nsuprathermal hydrogen atoms can strongly accelerate the formation of COOH\nradicals from CO$_2$, resulting in the dramatic increase of formation rate of\nglycine on grains. The efficiency of this process should be investigated in\ndetail by theoretical and experimental studies in the future. \n\n"}

Using\nthe Bayesian X-ray Astronomy (BXA) package, we constrain redshift, column\ndensity, photon index and luminosity simultaneously. The redshift information\nprimarily comes from absorption edges in Compton-thin AGN, and from the Fe\nK$\\alpha$ fluorescent line in heavily obscured AGN.

Second, unlike the planets themselves, the\nTNOs do not orbit on coplanar, circular orbits around the Sun, but move mostly\non inclined, eccentric orbits and are distributed in a complex way. This\nimplies that some process restructured the outer solar system after its\nformation. However, some of TNOs, referred to as Sednoids, move outside the\nzone of influence of the planets. Thus external forces must have played an\nimportant part in the restructuring of the outer solar system. The study\npresented here shows that a close fly-by of a neighbouring star can\nsimultaneously lead to the observed lower mass density outside 30 AU and excite\nthe TNOs onto eccentric, inclined orbits, including the family of Sednoids. In\nthe past it was estimated that such close fly-bys are rare during the relevant\ndevelopment stage. However, our numerical simulations show that such a scenario\nis much more likely than previously anticipated.

Based on the spiral-arm\ninstability analysis of our Paper I, we present linear perturbation theory of\ndynamical instability of self-gravitating spiral arms of magnetised gas,\nfocusing on the effect of toroidal magnetic fields. Spiral arms can be\ndestabilised by the toroidal fields which cancel Coriolis force, i.e.\nmagneto-Jeans instability. Our analysis can be applied to multi-component\nsystems that consist of gas and stars. To test our analysis, we perform ideal\nmagneto-hydrodynamics simulations of isolated disc galaxies and examine the\nsimulation results. We find that our analysis can characterise dynamical\ninstability leading arms to fragment and form clumps if magnetic fields are\nnearly toroidal. We propose that dimensionless growth rate of the most unstable\nperturbation, which is computed from our analysis, can be used to predict\nfragmentation of spiral arms within an orbital time-scale.

Using our analytic\nmodel, we estimate a typical mass of clumps forming from spiral-arm\nfragmentation to be consistent with observed giant clumps $\\sim10^{7-8}~{\\rm\nM_\\odot}$. Furthermore, we find that, although the magnetic destabilisation can\ncause low-density spiral arms to fragment, the estimated mass of resultant\nclumps is almost independent from strength of magnetic fields since marginal\ninstability occurs at long wavelengths which compensate the low densities of\nmagnetically destabilised arms. \n\n"}

In this work, we re-examine the sample from Sander\net al. (2012) to derive key properties of the Galactic WC population. All\nquantities depending on the distance are updated, while the underlying spectral\nanalyses remain untouched. Contrasting earlier assumptions, our study yields\nthat WC stars of the same subtype can significantly vary in absolute magnitude.\nWith Gaia DR2, the picture of the Galactic WC population becomes more complex:\nWe obtain luminosities ranging from log L = 4.9 to 6.0 with one outlier having\nlog L = 4.7. This indicates that the WC stars are likely formed from a broader\ninitial mass range than previously assumed.

One and only mechanism proposed for prolonging the residence time of\nhot grains in the near-stellar environments is trapping of charged\nnanoparticles by stellar magnetic fields. We revisit the model of magnetic\ngrain trapping around main-sequence stars of various spectral classes by taking\ninto account sublimation and electric charging of the grains. The model of\nmagnetic grain trapping predicts that hot dust grains are present in the\nvicinity of main-sequence stars with high rotation velocities and intermediate\nmagnetic-field strengths. On the contrary, we find that the detection of hot\ndust grains has no correlation with the rotation velocities of central stars\nnor the magnetic field strengths of the stars. Our numerical evaluation of\nelectric grain charging indicates that the surface potential of\nsubmicrometer-sized grains in the vicinity of main-sequence stars is typically\n4-5 V, which is one order of magnitude smaller than the value assumed by the\nmodel of magnetic grain trapping. On the basis of our numerical simulation on\nsublimation of dust grains in the vicinity of a star, it turns out that their\nlives end due to sublimation in a timescale much shorter than the period of one\nrevolution at the gyroradius.

We show that a globular cluster with a helium-rich\nconcentrated population will be slightly smaller than a globular cluster with a\nnormal-helium second generation, with the largest difference seen in the\nextended normal-helium population. This effect is shown both for a cluster in\nisolation and one in a realistic Milky Way tidal field. We show that this\neffect is a result of mass segregation, and the earlier loss of more massive\nstars in a helium-rich concentrated population due to their decreased main\nsequence lifetime. The two populations will therefore become dynamically mixed\nat a slightly earlier time than if they have the same helium abundance.\nFurthermore, we find that it is possible for the helium-enriched population to\nbecome more extended than the normal-helium population if it forms with a low\ninitial concentration or the cluster is able to evolve for a large number of\nrelaxation times. We conclude that the dynamical effects of helium on stellar\nmasses are modest, and that the initial concentration of the two populations\nand the strength of the Milky Way tidal field are more important in determining\nthe relative radial distributions of multiple populations. \n\n"}

We used archival data from the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) taken between 1995 and 2014, to derive long-baseline\nastrometric time series for stars near the center of the cluster, using\nstate-of-the-art software to extract high-precision astrometry from images. We\nthen modelled these time-series data, and compared microlensing model fits to\nsimple linear proper-motion fits for each selected star. We find no evidence\nfor astrometric microlensing in M 22, in particular for Bulge stars, which are\nmuch more likely to be lensed than cluster stars, due to the geometry of\nmicrolensing events. Although it is in principle possible to derive mass limits\nfrom such non-detections, we find that no useful mass limits can be derived for\nM 22 with available data, mostly due to a 10-year gap in coverage.

A discrepancy between [FeI/H] and [FeII/H] (not observed in\nRGB stars) has been detected adopting spectroscopic temperatures.

Here we analyzed a sample of 19 AGB and 14 RGB\nstars of NGC6752 observed with the spectrographs UVES. The two temperature\nscales agree very well for the RGB stars while for the AGB stars there is a\nsystematic offset of ~100 K.

An unexpected result is that the photometric temperatures do not satisfy\nthe excitation equilibrium in the AGB stars.

While the light element\nabundance variations are very common in globular clusters, they are\ncomparatively rare in the Galactic halo field population. However, little is\nknown regarding the occurrence of the abundance anomalies in other environments\nsuch as that of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. Consequently, we have\ninvestigated the anti-correlation and bimodality of CH and CN band strengths,\nwhich are markers of the abundance variations in GGCs, in the spectra of red\ngiants in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Using spectra at the Na~D\nlines, informed by similar spectra for five GGCs (NGC 288, 1851, 6752, 6809 and\n7099), we have also searched for any correlation between CN and Na in the\nSculptor red giant sample. Our results indicate that variations analogous to\nthose seen in GGCs are not present in our Sculptor sample. Instead, we find a\nweak positive correlation between CH and CN, and no correlation between Na and\nCN. We also reveal a deficiency in [Na/Fe] for the Sculptor stars relative to\nthe values in GGCs, a result which is consistent with previous work for dSph\ngalaxies. The outcomes reinforce the apparent need for a high stellar density\nenvironment to produce the light element abundance variations. \n\n"}

Using extant optical and infra-red photometry\nwe constructed a preliminary photometric membership catalogue, consisting of\n2230 dwarf and turn-off stars.

The ultraviolet, optical, and\nnear-infrared emission was consistent with being powered by the radioactive\ndecay of nuclei synthesized in the merger ejecta by the rapid neutron capture\nprocess (r-process). Starting from an outline of the inferred properties of\nthis 'kilonova' emission, I discuss possible astrophysical sites for r-process\nnucleosynthesis in NS mergers, arguing that the heaviest r-process elements\nsynthesized in this event most likely originated in outflows from a post-merger\naccretion disk.

We derived accurate stellar ages for the cluster NGC6530,\nassociated with the Lagoon Nebula to infer its SF history. We use the Gaia-ESO\nsurvey observations and Gaia DR2 data, to derive cluster membership and\nfundamental stellar parameters. We identified 652 confirmed and 9 probable\nmembers. The reddening inferred for members and non-members allows us to\ndistinguish MS stars and giants, in agreement with the distances inferred from\nGaia DR2 data. The foreground and background stars show a spatial pattern that\ntraces the 3D structure of the nebular dust component. We derive stellar ages\nfor 382 confirmed cluster members and we find that the gravity-sensitive gamma\nindex distribution for M stars is correlated with stellar age. For all members\nwith Teff<5500 K, the mean logarithmic age is 5.84 (units of years) with a\ndispersion of 0.36 dex. The age distribution of stars with accretion and/or\ndisk (CTTSe) is similar to that of stars without accretion and without disk\n(WTTSp). We interpret this dispersion as evidence of a real age spread since\nthe total uncertainties on age determinations, derived from Monte Carlo\nsimulations, are significantly smaller than the observed spread. This\nconclusion is supported by the evidence of a decreasing of the\ngravity-sensitive gamma index as a function of stellar ages. The presence of\nthe age spread is also supported by the spatial distribution and the kinematics\nof old and young members. In particular, members with accretion and/or disk,\nformed in the last 1 Myr, show evidence of subclustering around the cluster\ncenter, in the Hourglass Nebula and in the M8-E region, suggesting a possible\ntriggering of star formation events by the O-type star ionization fronts. \n\n"}
