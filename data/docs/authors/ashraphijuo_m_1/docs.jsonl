The source signal arrives at the destination\nvia N hops through N-1 layers of relays. We analyze the diversity of such\nchannels with fixed network size at high SNR. In the clustered case where the\nrelays within the same layer can have full cooperation, the cooperative\ndecode-and-forward (DF) scheme is shown to be optimal in terms of the\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). The upper bound on the DMT, the cut-set\nbound, is attained. In the non-clustered case, we show that the naive\namplify-and-forward (AF) scheme has the maximum multiplexing gain of the\nchannel but is suboptimal in diversity, as compared to the cut-set bound. To\nimprove the diversity, space-time relay processing is introduced through the\nparallel partition of the multihop channel. The idea is to let the source\nsignal go through K different \"AF paths\" in the multihop channel. This parallel\nAF scheme creates a parallel channel in the time domain and has the maximum\ndiversity if the partition is properly designed.

The infrastructure uses multi-antenna base stations (BSs), in which the\nnumber of BSs and the number of antennas at each BS can scale at arbitrary\nrates relative to $n$. Under the model, capacity scaling laws are analyzed for\nboth dense and extended networks. Two BS-based routing schemes are first\nintroduced in this study: an infrastructure-supported single-hop (ISH) routing\nprotocol with multiple-access uplink and broadcast downlink and an\ninfrastructure-supported multi-hop (IMH) routing protocol. Then, their\nachievable throughput scalings are analyzed. These schemes are compared against\ntwo conventional schemes without BSs: the multi-hop (MH) transmission and\nhierarchical cooperation (HC) schemes. It is shown that a linear throughput\nscaling is achieved in dense networks, as in the case without help of BSs. In\ncontrast, the proposed BS-based routing schemes can, under realistic network\nconditions, improve the throughput scaling significantly in extended networks.\nThe gain comes from the following advantages of these BS-based protocols.\nFirst, more nodes can transmit simultaneously in the proposed scheme than in\nthe MH scheme if the number of BSs and the number of antennas are large enough.\nSecond, by improving the long-distance signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\nreceived signal power can be larger than that of the HC, enabling a better\nthroughput scaling under extended networks. Furthermore, by deriving the\ncorresponding information-theoretic cut-set upper bounds, it is shown under\nextended networks that a combination of four schemes IMH, ISH, MH, and HC is\norder-optimal in all operating regimes. \n\n"}

For subspace codes and CDCs, a subspace metric was introduced to\ncorrect both errors and erasures, and an injection metric was proposed to\ncorrect adversarial errors. In this paper, we investigate the packing and\ncovering properties of subspace codes with both metrics. We first determine\nsome fundamental geometric properties of the projective space with both\nmetrics.

In addition, simulation results indicate that the\ndelay performance of these algorithms can be quite bad.

We first provide an achievable secrecy rate for\nthe general untrusted relay channel, and proceed to investigate this question\nfor two types of relay networks with orthogonal components. For the first\nmodel, there is an orthogonal link from the source to the relay. For the second\nmodel, there is an orthogonal link from the relay to the destination. For the\nfirst model, we find the equivocation capacity region and show that answer is\nnegative. In contrast, for the second model, we find that the answer is\npositive.

The secrecy level is measured by the\nequivocation rate at the eavesdropper. We first study the general\n(non-degraded) broadcast channel with an eavesdropper. We present an inner\nbound on the secrecy capacity region for this model. This inner bound is based\non a combination of random binning, and the Gelfand-Pinsker binning. We further\nstudy the situation in which the channels are degraded. For the degraded\nbroadcast channel with an eavesdropper, we present the secrecy capacity region.\nOur achievable coding scheme is based on Covers superposition scheme and random\nbinning.

Specializing our results to the\nGaussian MIMO many-to-one interference channel, which is a special case of the\nclass of channels considered, we obtain new capacity results. Firstly, we\nextend the noisy interference regime, previously studied for (many-to-one)\ninterference channels with average power constraints on the inputs, to a more\ngeneral class of inputs. This more general class includes the practical\nscenario of inputs being restricted to fixed finite-size constellations such as\nPSK or QAM.

On the achievability\nside, we consider compress-and-forward based strategies. Specifically, a\ngeneralized compress-and-forward strategy, where the destinations jointly\ndecode the compression indices and the source messages, is shown to improve\nupon the compress-and-forward strategy which sequentially decodes the\ncompression indices and source messages, and the recently proposed generalized\nhash-and-forward strategy. We also construct a nested lattice code based\ncompute-and-forward relaying scheme, which outperforms other relaying schemes\nwhen the direct link is weak. In this case, it is shown that, with a relay, the\ninterference link can be useful for decoding the source messages. Noting the\nneed for upperbounding the capacity for this channel, we propose a new\ntechnique with which the sum rate can be bounded. In particular, the sum\ncapacity is upperbounded by considering the channel when the relay node has\nabundant power and is named potent for that reason. For the Gaussian\ninterference relay channel with potent relay, we study the strong and the weak\ninterference regimes and establish the sum capacity, which, in turn, serve as\nupperbounds for the sum capacity of the GIFRC with finite relay power.\nNumerical results demonstrate that upperbounds are tighter than the cut-set\nbound, and coincide with known achievable sum rates for many scenarios of\ninterest.

The new outer bound follows from arguments originally devised for\nbroadcast channels among which Sato's observation that the capacity region of\nchannels with non-cooperative receivers only depends on the channel output\nconditional marginal distributions. The new inner bound is shown to include all\npreviously proposed coding schemes and it is thus the largest known achievable\nrate region to date.

For these channels there is\nno loss in optimality if both destinations decode both messages. This result\nparallels analogous results for the classical IFC and for the cognitive IFC and\nis the first known capacity result for the general IFC-CR.

The GHF relaying\nstrategy is ideally suited for the broadcasting relay because it can be\nimplemented in an incremental fashion, i.e., the relay message to one receiver\nis a degraded version of the message to the other receiver. A\ngeneralized-degree-of-freedom (GDoF) analysis in the high signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) regime reveals that in the symmetric channel setting, each common relay\nbit can improve the sum rate roughly by either one bit or two bits\nasymptotically depending on the operating regime, and the rate gain can be\ninterpreted as coming solely from the improvement of the common message rates,\nor alternatively in the very weak interference regime as solely coming from the\nrate improvement of the private messages.

It is shown that each of the\nrandom variables in the expansion corresponds to independent Bernoulli random\nvariables. Thus, each of the expansion levels (of the underlying channel)\ncorresponds to a binary symmetric channel (BSC), and the coding problem is\nreduced to coding over these parallel channels while satisfying the channel\ninput constraint. This optimization formulation is stated as the achievable\nrate result, for which a specific choice of input distribution is shown to\nachieve a rate which is arbitrarily close to the channel capacity in the high\nSNR regime.

In other words,\ndepending on the realization of the link erasures, the underlying graph at each\ntime instant is assumed to be a subgraph of the original graph. Implicit in\nthis model is the assumption that the erasures are symmetric: if at time t the\npacket from node i to node j is dropped, the same is true for the packet\ntransmitted from node j to node i. However, in practical wireless communication\nsystems this assumption is unreasonable and, due to the lack of symmetry,\nstandard averaging protocols cannot guarantee that the network will reach\nconsensus to the true average.

A single-hop\nbroadcasting system model is considered that aims to deliver a block of packets\nto all receivers in the presence of packet erasures. For a fair and\nanalytically tractable comparison between the two coding schemes, the\ntransmission comprises two phases: a systematic transmission phase and a\nnetwork coded transmission phase which is further divided into rounds. After\nthe systematic transmission phase and given the same packet reception state,\nthree quantitative metrics are proposed and derived in each scheme: 1) the\nabsolute minimum number of transmissions in the first coded transmission round\n(assuming no erasures), 2) probability distribution of extra coded\ntransmissions in a subsequent round (due to erasures), and 3) average packet\ndecoding delay. This comparative study enables application-aware adaptive\nselection between IDNC and RLNC after systematic transmission phase.\n  One contribution of this paper is to provide a deep and systematic\nunderstanding of the IDNC scheme, to propose the notion of packet diversity and\nan optimal IDNC encoding scheme for minimizing metric 1.

The first one is a proof of the so-called Maxwell construction\nstating that the MAP threshold is equal to the Area threshold of the BP GEXIT\ncurve. The second is a proof of the equality between the BP and MAP GEXIT\ncurves above the MAP threshold. The third application is the intimately related\nfact that the replica symmetric formula for the conditional entropy in the\ninfinite block length limit is exact. \n\n"}

In many existing studies, the confidential\ninformation transmit covariance and the AN covariance are not simultaneously\noptimized.

Hence, the proposed design has potential in jamming the\neavesdroppers more effectively, based upon the channel state information (CSI).\nWe derive an optimization approach to the SRM problem through both analysis and\nconvex conic optimization machinery.

This problem, known as physical-layer multicasting, has drawn\nmuch interest. Presently, a popularized approach is transmit beamforming, in\nwhich the beamforming optimization is handled by a rank-one approximation\nmethod called semidefinite relaxation (SDR). SDR-based beamforming has been\nshown to be promising for a small or moderate number of users. This paper\ndescribes two new transceiver strategies for physical-layer multicasting. The\nfirst strategy, called stochastic beamforming (SBF), randomizes the beamformer\nin a per-symbol time-varying manner, so that the rank-one approximation in SDR\ncan be bypassed. We propose several efficiently realizable SBF schemes, and\nprove that their multicast achievable rate gaps with respect to the MISO\nmulticast capacity must be no worse than 0.8314 bits/s/Hz, irrespective of any\nother factors such as the number of users. The use of channel coding and the\nassumption of sufficiently long code lengths play a crucial role in achieving\nthe above result. The second strategy combines transmit beamforming and the\nAlamouti space-time code. The result is a rank-two generalization of SDR-based\nbeamforming. We show by analysis that this SDR-based beamformed Alamouti scheme\nhas a better worst-case effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scaling, and\nhence a better multicast rate scaling, than SDR-based beamforming. We further\nthe work by combining SBF and the beamformed Alamouti scheme, wherein an\nimproved constant rate gap of 0.39 bits/s/Hz is proven. Simulation results show\nthat under a channel-coded, many-user setting, the proposed multicast\ntransceiver schemes yield significant SNR gains over SDR-based beamforming at\nthe same bit error rate level. \n\n"}

To meet the\npractical requirement that energy receivers (ERs) operate with much higher\nreceived power than information receivers (IRs), ERs need to be deployed closer\nto the transmitter than IRs. However, due to the broadcast nature of wireless\nchannels, one critical issue is that the messages sent to IRs cannot be\neavesdropped by ERs, which possess better channels from the transmitter. In\nthis paper, we address this new secrecy communication problem in a multiuser\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) SWIPT system where a multi-antenna\ntransmitter sends information and energy simultaneously to one IR and multiple\nERs, each with a single antenna. By optimizing transmit beamforming vectors and\ntheir power allocation, we maximize the weighted sum-energy transferred to ERs\nsubject to a secrecy rate constraint for the information sent to the IR. We\nsolve this non-convex problem optimally by reformulating it into a two-stage\nproblem.

Furthermore, two\nsuboptimal low-complexity beamforming schemes are proposed, and their\nachievable (secrecy) rate-energy (R-E) regions are compared against that by the\noptimal scheme. \n\n"}

The work considers a broad setting where communication takes place\nin the presence of a random fading process, and in the presence of a feedback\nprocess that, at any point in time, may provide CSIT estimates - of some\narbitrary accuracy - for any past, current or future channel realization. This\nfeedback quality may fluctuate in time across all ranges of CSIT accuracy and\ntimeliness, ranging from perfectly accurate and instantaneously available\nestimates, to delayed estimates of minimal accuracy. Under standard\nassumptions, the work derives the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region, which is\ntight for a large range of CSIT quality.

The enhanced precision from a few additional reads allows\nFER performance to approach that of full-precision soft information and enables\nan LDPC code to significantly outperform a BCH code.

The Poltyrev's capacity, is the highest\nachievable normalized log density (NLD) of codewords per unit volume, at\npossibly large block length, that guarantees a vanishing error probability. For\na given finite block length and a fixed error probability, there is a gap\nbetween the highest achievable NLD and Poltyrev's capacity. The dispersion\nanalysis quantifies asymptotically this gap.\n  The thesis begins by the dispersion analysis of infinite constellations in\nscalar fading channels. Later on, we extend the analysis to the case of\nmultiple input multiple output fading channels. As in other channels, we show\nthat the gap between the highest achievable NLD and the Poltyrev's capacity,\nvanishes asymptotically as the square root of the channel dispersion over the\nblock length, multiplied by the inverse Q-function of the allowed error\nprobability.\n  Moreover, exact terms for Poltyrev's capacity and channel dispersion, are\nderived in the thesis.

However, the use of very large antenna arrays at the base stations\n(BSs) brings new issues, such as the significantly increased hardware and\nsignal processing costs. In order to reap the enormous gain of massive MIMO and\nyet reduce its cost to an affordable level, this paper proposes a novel system\ndesign by integrating an electromagnetic (EM) lens with the large antenna\narray, termed the EM-lens enabled MIMO. The EM lens has the capability of\nfocusing the power of an incident wave to a small area of the antenna array,\nwhile the location of the focal area varies with the angle of arrival (AoA) of\nthe wave. Therefore, in practical scenarios where the arriving signals from\ngeographically separated users have different AoAs, the EM-lens enabled system\nprovides two new benefits, namely energy focusing and spatial interference\nrejection. By taking into account the effects of imperfect channel estimation\nvia pilot-assisted training, in this paper we analytically show that the\naverage received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in both the single-user and\nmultiuser uplink transmissions can be strictly improved by the EM-lens enabled\nsystem. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed design makes it possible\nto considerably reduce the hardware and signal processing costs with only\nslight degradations in performance. To this end, two complexity/cost reduction\nschemes are proposed, which are small-MIMO processing with parallel receiver\nfiltering applied over subgroups of antennas to reduce the computational\ncomplexity, and channel covariance based antenna selection to reduce the\nrequired number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Numerical results are provided\nto corroborate our analysis. \n\n"}

This\ncharacterization answers in the affirmative the open question whether there\nexists a non-vanishing gap between the optimal bandwidth-storage tradeoff of\nthe functional-repair regenerating codes (i.e., the cut-set bound) and that of\nthe exact-repair regenerating codes.

This is achieved by using a deterministic non-block-based\nnetwork coding scheme, which allows us to sidestep some of the limitations put\nin place by the block coding model used to determine the network capacity.\n  Under the network coding scheme we outline, the sender is able to transmit\nnetwork coded packets above the channel rate of some receivers, while ensuring\nthat they still experience nonzero delivery rates. Interestingly, in this\ngeneralised form of asynchronous network coded broadcast, receivers are not\nrequired to obtain knowledge of all packets transmitted so far. Instead, causal\nfeedback from the receivers about packet erasures is used by the sender to\ndetermine a network coded transmission that will allow at least one, but often\nmultiple receivers, to deliver their next needed packet.\n  Although the analysis of deterministic coding schemes is generally a\ndifficult problem, by making some approximations we are able to obtain\ntractable estimates of the receivers' delivery rates, which are shown to match\nreasonably well with simulation.

A famous trend to overcome this issue is to focus\non subclasses of alternant/Goppa codes with a non trivial automorphism group.\nSuch codes display then symmetries allowing compact parity-check or generator\nmatrices. For instance, a key-reduction is obtained by taking quasi-cyclic (QC)\nor quasi-dyadic (QD) alternant/Goppa codes. We show that the use of such\nsymmetric alternant/Goppa codes in cryptography introduces a fundamental\nweakness. It is indeed possible to reduce the key-recovery on the original\nsymmetric public-code to the key-recovery on a (much) smaller code that has not\nanymore symmetries. This result is obtained thanks to a new operation on codes\ncalled folding that exploits the knowledge of the automorphism group. This\noperation consists in adding the coordinates of codewords which belong to the\nsame orbit under the action of the automorphism group. The advantage is\ntwofold: the reduction factor can be as large as the size of the orbits, and it\npreserves a fundamental property: folding the dual of an alternant (resp.\nGoppa) code provides the dual of an alternant (resp.

Based on a\nRician model for the LoS channels, we show, analytically and numerically, that\nLoS interference hinders the achievable secondary user capacity when\ninterference constraints are imposed at the primary user receiver. This is\ncaused by the poor dynamic range of the interference channels fluctuations when\na dominant LoS component exists. In order to improve the capacity of such\nsystem, we propose the usage of an Electronically Steerable Parasitic Array\nRadiator (ESPAR) antennas at the secondary terminals. An ESPAR antenna involves\na single RF chain and has a reconfigurable radiation pattern that is controlled\nby assigning arbitrary weights to M orthonormal basis radiation patterns via\naltering a set of reactive loads. By viewing the orthonormal patterns as\nmultiple virtual dumb antennas, we randomly vary their weights over time\ncreating artificial channel fluctuations that can perfectly eliminate the\nundesired impact of LoS interference.

Our first cooperative STB is the\nSTB sequentially operating in the macrocell and femtocells (STB-SMF), where the\ncooperative FBSs individually design their STB matrices and then feed their\nperformance metrics to the MBS for guiding the STB in the macrocell.

The ET\nleverages its observed backscatter signals to estimate the backscatter-channel\n(i.e., ET-to-ER-to-ET) state information (BS-CSI) directly.

No feedback is assumed. It is well known that the ratio between the\nminimum energy per bit and the noise level converges to $-1.59$ dB as $k$ goes\nto infinity, regardless of whether CSI is available at the receiver or not.\nThis paper shows that lack of CSI at the receiver causes a slowdown in the\nspeed of convergence to $-1.59$ dB as $k\\to\\infty$ compared to the case of\nperfect receiver CSI. Specifically, we show that, in the no-CSI case, the gap\nto $-1.59$ dB is proportional to $((\\log k) /k)^{1/3}$, whereas when perfect\nCSI is available at the receiver, this gap is proportional to $1/\\sqrt{k}$.

Hence, contrary\nto traditional LTE, we propose using single-carrier frequency division multiple\naccesses (SC-FDMA) for downlink along with the conventional method of using it\nfor uplink. The use of multiple antennas at eNB and singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) in the downlink allows multiple users (MU) to operate on\nthe same set of ubcarriers. In the uplink, successive interference cancellation\nwith optimal ordering (SSIC-OO) algorithm is used to decouple signals of UEs\noperating in the same set of subcarriers. A smart antenna approach is adopted\nwhich prevents interference, in downlink of a UE, from uplink signals of other\nUEs sharing same subcarriers. The approach includes using multiple antennas at\nUEs to form directed beams towards eNode and nulls towards other UEs.

Specifically, the phases of the QAM modulated data symbols\nare manipulated before transmission in order to make them more immune to the\nrandom rotational effects of phase noise. At the receiver, a two-stage detector\nis implemented, which first detects the amplitude of the transmitted symbols\nfrom a nonlinear combination of the received signal amplitudes. Then in the\nsecond stage, the detector performs phase detection. The studied signaling\nmethod does not require transmission of any known symbols that act as pilots.\nFurthermore, no phase noise estimator (or a tracker) is needed at the receiver\nto compensate the effect of phase noise. This considerably reduces the\ncomplexity of the receiver structure. Moreover, it is observed that the studied\nalgorithm can be used for the setups where a common local oscillator or\nseparate independent oscillators drive the radio-frequency circuitries\nconnected to each antenna. Due to the differential encoding/decoding of the\nphase, weighted averaging can be employed at a multi-antenna receiver, allowing\nfor phase noise suppression to leverage the large number of antennas.

Herein its secrecy-capacity is\nderived and shown to be equal to its semantic-security (SS) capacity. In this\nsetting, the legitimate users communicate via a discrete-memoryless (DM)\nchannel in the presence of an eavesdropper that has perfect access to a subset\nof its choosing of the transmitted symbols, constrained to a fixed fraction of\nthe blocklength. The secrecy criterion is achieved simultaneously for all\npossible eavesdropper subset choices. The SS criterion demands negligible\nmutual information between the message and the eavesdropper's observations even\nwhen maximized over all message distributions.\n  A key tool for the achievability proof is a novel and stronger version of\nWyner's soft covering lemma. Specifically, a random codebook is shown to\nachieve the soft-covering phenomenon with high probability. The probability of\nfailure is doubly-exponentially small in the blocklength. Since the combined\nnumber of messages and subsets grows only exponentially with the blocklength,\nSS for the WTC II is established by using the union bound and invoking the\nstronger soft-covering lemma. The direct proof shows that rates up to the\nweak-secrecy capacity of the classic WTC with a DM erasure channel (EC) to the\neavesdropper are achievable. The converse follows by establishing the capacity\nof this DM wiretap EC as an upper bound for the WTC II. From a broader\nperspective, the stronger soft-covering lemma constitutes a tool for showing\nthe existence of codebooks that satisfy exponentially many constraints, a\nbeneficial ability for many other applications in information theoretic\nsecurity. \n\n"}

The state sequence is known non-causally to both the\nencoder and the adversary. Taking an Arbitrarily Varying Channel (AVC)\napproach, we consider two setups, namely, the discrete memoryless\nGel'fand-Pinsker (GP) AVC and the additive white Gaussian Dirty Paper (DP) AVC.\nWe determine the randomized coding capacity of both the AVCs under a maximum\nprobability of error criterion.

This survey tries to give the interested\nreader an overview of the area.\n  Erdal Arikan came up with his landmark polar coding shemes which achieve\ncapacity on symmetric channels subject to the constraint that the input\ncodewords are equiprobable. His idea is to convert any B-DMC into efficiently\nencodable-decodable channels which have rates 0 and 1, while conserving\ncapacity in this transformation. An exponentially decreasing probability of\nerror which independent of code rate is achieved for all rates lesser than the\nsymmetric capacity. These codes perform well in practice since encoding and\ndecoding complexity is O(N log N).

Towards this goal, we first note the structure of\nthe optimal beamformer with per-antenna gain and phase control and the\nstructure of good beamformers with per-antenna phase-only control. Learning\nthese beamforming structures in mmW systems is fraught with considerable\ncomplexities such as the need for a non-broadcast system design, the\nsensitivity of the beamformer approximants to small path length changes, etc.\nTo overcome these issues, we establish a physical interpretation between these\nbeamformer structures and the angles of departure/arrival of the dominant\npath(s). This physical interpretation provides a theoretical underpinning to\nthe emerging interest on directional beamforming approaches that are less\nsensitive to small path length changes. While classical approaches for\ndirection learning such as MUSIC have been well-understood, they suffer from\nmany practical difficulties in a mmW context such as a non-broadcast system\ndesign and high computational complexity.

While the aggregate network traffic is growing at an\nunprecedented rate, users tend to request the same popular contents at\ndifferent time instants. Therefore, caching the most popular contents at the\nnetwork edge is a promising solution to reduce the traffic and the energy\nconsumption over the backhaul links. In this paper, two scenarios are\nconsidered, where caching is performed either at a small base station, or\ndirectly at the user terminals, which communicate using \\ac{D2D}\ncommunications. In both scenarios, joint design of the transmission and caching\npolicies is studied when the user demands are known in advance. This joint\ndesign offers two different caching gains, namely, the \\textit{pre-downloading}\nand \\textit{local caching gains}.

In particular, we compare the standard\nand the maximal $f$-divergences regarding their ability to detect the\nreversibility of quantum operations.

A compress-and-forward relaying strategy, named the VMAC scheme,\nis employed, in which the BSs can either perform single-user compression or\nWyner-Ziv coding to quantize the received signals and send the quantization\nbits to the CP via capacity-limited fronthaul links; the CP performs successive\ndecoding with either successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver or\nlinear minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) receiver. Under this setup, this paper\ninvestigates the joint optimization of the transmit beamformers at the users\nand the quantization noise covariance matrices at the BSs for maximizing the\nnetwork utility. A novel weighted minimum-mean-square-error successive convex\napproximation (WMMSE-SCA) algorithm is first proposed for maximizing the\nweighted sum rate under the user transmit power and fronthaul capacity\nconstraints with single-user compression.

As an information-theoretic paradigm, secrecy\nrate derives bounds for secure transmission when the channel to the\neavesdropper is known. However, such bounds are shown to be restrictive in\npractice and may require exploitation of specialized coding schemes. In this\npaper, we employ the concept of directional modulation and follow a signal\nprocessing approach to enhance the security of multi-user MIMO communication\nsystems when a multi-antenna eavesdropper is present. Enhancing the security is\naccomplished by increasing the symbol error rate at the eavesdropper. Unlike\nthe information-theoretic secrecy rate paradigm, we assume that the legitimate\ntransmitter is not aware of its channel to the eavesdropper, which is a more\nrealistic assumption. We examine the applicability of MIMO receiving algorithms\nat the eavesdropper. Using the channel knowledge and the intended symbols for\nthe users, we design security enhancing symbol-level precoders for different\ntransmitter and eavesdropper antenna configurations.

Our goal is to jointly design the optimal input\ncovariances for the multicast message, confidential message and AN, such that\nthe achievable secrecy rate region is maximized subject to the sum power\nconstraint. This secrecy rate region maximization (SRRM) problem is a nonconvex\nvector maximization problem. To handle it, we reformulate the SRRM problem into\na provably equivalent scalar optimization problem and propose a searching\nmethod to find all of its Pareto optimal points. The equivalent scalar\noptimization problem is identified as a secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem\nwith the quality of multicast service (QoMS) constraints. Further, we show that\nthis equivalent QoMS-constrained SRM problem, albeit nonconvex, can be\nefficiently handled based on a two-stage optimization approach, including\nsolving a sequence of semidefinite programs.

Another consequence of under-sampling is lower signal to noise ratio\n(SNR) due to fewer acquired measurements. Even if an oracle provided the\ninformation to perfectly disambiguate the underdetermined system, the\nreconstructed image could still have lower image quality than a corresponding\nfully sampled acquisition because of the reduced measurement time. The effects\nof lower SNR and the underdetermined system are coupled during reconstruction,\nmaking it difficult to isolate the impact of lower SNR on image quality. To\nthis end, we present an image quality prediction process that reconstructs\nfully sampled, fully determined data with noise added to simulate the loss of\nSNR induced by a given under-sampling pattern.

Moreover, no assumptions on the noise statistics are required\napart from a zero-mean and finite SO moments. We show that both R-D NC\nESPRIT-type algorithms with spatial smoothing perform asymptotically identical\nin the high effective SNR regime.

Recently, the Partial\nInformation Decomposition (PID) was proposed to decompose mutual information\n(MI) about a target variable into components which are redundant, unique and\nsynergistic within different subsets of predictor variables. Here, we propose\nto apply the elegant formalism of the PID to multivariate entropy, resulting in\na Partial Entropy Decomposition (PED). We implement the PED with an entropy\nredundancy measure based on pointwise common surprisal; a natural definition\nwhich is closely related to the definition of MI. We show how this approach can\nreveal the dyadic vs triadic generative structure of multivariate systems that\nare indistinguishable with classical Shannon measures. The entropy perspective\nalso shows that misinformation is synergistic entropy and hence that MI itself\nincludes both redundant and synergistic effects. We show the relationships\nbetween the PED and MI in two predictors, and derive two alternative\ninformation decompositions which we illustrate on several example systems. This\nreveals that in entropy terms, univariate predictor MI is not a proper subset\nof the joint MI, and we suggest this previously unrecognised fact explains in\npart why obtaining a consistent PID has proven difficult. The PED also allows\nseparate quantification of mechanistic redundancy (related to the function of\nthe system) versus source redundancy (arising from dependencies between\ninputs); an important distinction which no existing methods can address. The\nnew perspective provided by the PED helps to clarify some of the difficulties\nencountered with the PID approach and the resulting decompositions provide\nuseful tools for practical data analysis across a wide range of application\nareas. \n\n"}

However, the limited endurance of UAVs greatly hinders the practical\nimplementation of UAV-enabled communications. To overcome this issue, this\npaper proposes a novel scheme for UAV-enabled communications by utilizing the\npromising technique of proactive caching at the users. Specifically, we focus\non content-centric communication systems, where a UAV is dispatched to serve a\ngroup of ground nodes (GNs) with random and asynchronous requests for files\ndrawn from a given set. With the proposed scheme, at the beginning of each\noperation period, the UAV pro-actively transmits the files to a subset of\nselected GNs that cooperatively cache all the files in the set. As a result,\nwhen requested, a file can be retrieved by each GN either directly from its\nlocal cache or from its nearest neighbor that has cached the file via\ndevice-to-device (D2D) communications. It is revealed that there exists a\nfundamental trade-off between the file caching cost, which is the total time\nrequired for the UAV to transmit the files to their designated caching GNs, and\nthe file retrieval cost, which is the average time required for serving one\nfile request. To characterize this trade-off, we formulate an optimization\nproblem to minimize the weighted sum of the two costs, via jointly designing\nthe file caching policy, the UAV trajectory and communication scheduling. As\nthe formulated problem is NP-hard in general, we propose efficient algorithms\nto find high-quality approximate solutions for it.

Specifically,\nthe UAVs first charge the GTs by transmitting the wireless energy transfer\n(WET) signals in the downlink. Then, by utilizing the harvested wireless energy\nfrom the UAVs, the GTs send their uplink wireless information transmission\n(WIT) signals to the UAVs. In this paper, depending on the operations of the\nUAVs, we adopt two different scenarios, namely integrated UAV and separated UAV\nWPCNs. First, in the integrated UAV WPCN, a UAV acts as a hybrid AP in which\nboth energy transfer and information reception are processed at a single UAV.\nIn contrast, for the separated UAV WPCN, we consider two UAVs each of which\nbehaves as an energy AP and an information AP independently, and thus the\nenergy transfer and the information decoding are separately performed at two\ndifferent UAVs. For both systems, we jointly optimize the trajectories of the\nUAVs, the uplink power control, and the time resource allocation for the WET\nand the WIT to maximize the minimum throughput of the GTs.

While such a risk\nminimization strategy is very natural to learn binary output models, such as in\nclassification, its capacity to estimate a specific signal vector is largely\nunexplored. A major difficulty is that the hinge loss is just piecewise linear,\nso that its \"curvature energy\" is concentrated in a single point. This is\nsubstantially different from other popular loss functions considered in signal\nestimation, e.g., the square or logistic loss, which are at least locally\nstrongly convex. It is therefore somewhat unexpected that we can still prove\nvery similar types of recovery guarantees for the hinge loss estimator, even in\nthe presence of strong noise.

In the receiver, we propose to split the analog combining\nsubsystem into a channel gain aggregation stage followed by a spreading stage.\nBoth stages use phase shifters. Our goal is to design the two-stage analog\ncombiner to optimize mutual information (MI) between the transmitted and\nquantized signals by effectively managing quantization error. To this end, we\nformulate an unconstrained MI maximization problem without a constant modulus\nconstraint on analog combiners, and derive a two-stage analog combining\nsolution. The solution achieves the optimal scaling law with respect to the\nnumber of radio frequency chains and maximizes the MI for homogeneous singular\nvalues of a MIMO channel. We further develop a two-stage analog combining\nalgorithm to implement the derived solution for mmWave channels. By decoupling\nchannel gain aggregation and spreading functions from the derived solution, the\nproposed algorithm implements the two functions by using array response vectors\nand a discrete Fourier transform matrix under the constant modulus constraint\non each matrix element. Therefore, the proposed algorithm provides a near\noptimal solution for the unconstrained problem, whereas conventional hybrid\napproaches offer a near optimal solution only for a constrained problem. The\nclosed-form approximation of the ergodic rate is derived for the algorithm,\nshowing that a practical digital combiner with two-stage analog combining also\nachieves the optimal scaling law.

Local\ndecodability can be a beneficial feature in some communication scenarios, such\nas when the receivers can afford to listen to only a part of the transmissions\nbecause of limited availability of power. The locality of an index code is the\nratio of the maximum number of codeword symbols queried by a receiver to the\nmessage length. In this paper we analyze the optimum locality of linear codes\nfor the family of index coding problems whose min-rank is one less than the\nnumber of receivers in the network. We first derive the optimal trade-off\nbetween the index coding rate and locality with vector linear coding when the\nside information graph is a directed cycle.

The format is designed by maximizing the generalized mutual\ninformation (GMI) and by imposing a constant-modulus on the 4D structure. The\nproposed format yields an improved performance with respect to state-of-the-art\ngeometrically shaped modulation formats for bit-interleaved coded modulation\nsystems at the same spectral efficiency. Unlike previously published results,\nthe coordinates of the constellation points and the binary labeling of the\nconstellation are jointly optimized. When compared with\npolarization-multiplexed 8-ary quadrature-amplitude modulation (PM-8QAM), gains\nof up to 0.7 dB in signal-to-noise ratio are observed in the additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN) channel.

In CeMm-RANs,\nenhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs), which are equipped with local cache and\nbaseband signal processing capabilities in addition to the basic\nfunctionalities of conventional RRHs, are connected to the baseband processing\nunit via fronthaul links. Two different fronthaul information transfer\nstrategies are considered, namely, hard fronthaul information transfer, where\nhard information of uncached requested files is transmitted via the fronthaul\nlinks to a subset of eRRHs, and soft fronthaul information transfer, where the\nfronthaul links are used to transmit quantized baseband signals of uncached\nrequested files. The hybrid precoder is optimized for maximization of the\nminimum user rate under a fronthaul capacity constraint, an eRRH transmit power\nconstraint, and a constant-modulus constraint on the analog precoder. The\nresulting optimization problem is non-convex, and hence the global optimal\nsolution is difficult to obtain. Therefore, convex approximation methods are\nemployed to tackle the non-convexity of the achievable user rate, the fronthaul\ncapacity constraint, and the constant modulus constraint on the analog\nprecoder.

In general, the databases can be storage\nconstrained where each database can only store up to $\\mu K L$ bits where\n$\\frac{1}{N} \\leq \\mu \\leq 1$ and $L$ is the size of each message in bits. Let\n$t= \\mu N$, a recent work showed that the capacity of Storage Constrained PIR\n(SC-PIR) is $\\left( 1+ \\frac{1}{t} + \\frac{1}{t^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{t^{K-1}}\n\\right)^{-1}$, which is achieved by a storage placement scheme inspired by the\ncontent placement scheme in the literature of coded caching and the original\nPIR scheme. Not surprisingly, this achievable scheme requires that each message\nis $L = {N \\choose t}t^K$ bits in length, which can be impractical. In this\npaper, without trying to make the connection between SC-PIR and coded caching\nproblems, based on a general connection between the Full Storage PIR (FS-PIR)\nproblem ($\\mu = 1$) and SC-PIR problem, we propose a new SC-PIR design idea\nusing novel storage placement schemes. The proposed schemes significantly\nreduce the message size requirement while still meeting the capacity of SC-PIR.\nIn particular, the proposed SC-PIR schemes require the size of each file to be\nonly $L = Nt^{K-1}$ compared to the state-of-the-art $L = {N \\choose t}t^K$.\nHence, we conclude that PIR may not meet coded caching when the size of $L$ is\nconstrained. \n\n"}

An area theorem for transmission over general memoryless channels\nis introduced and some of its many consequences are discussed.

This\ntradeoff is precisely known in the case of i.i.d. Rayleigh-fading, for T>=\nn_t+n_r-1 where T is the number of time slots over which coding takes place and\nn_t,n_r are the number of transmit and receive antennas respectively. For T <\nn_t+n_r-1, only upper and lower bounds on the D-MG tradeoff are available.\n  In this paper, we present a complete solution to the problem of explicitly\nconstructing D-MG optimal ST codes, i.e., codes that achieve the D-MG tradeoff\nfor any number of receive antennas. We do this by showing that for the square\nminimum-delay case when T=n_t=n, cyclic-division-algebra (CDA) based ST codes\nhaving the non-vanishing determinant property are D-MG optimal.
