Herein we describe the potential employment of large detectors\n(>1 kiloton) for studies of higher energy neutrinos interactions, from the\ncosmic rays and as a long baseline neutrino detector. Generally when people\nhave considered large new instruments such as Hanohano and LENA, they have\nabandoned the possibility of doing useful measurements with higher energy\nneutrino interactions since these produce enough light to illuminate every\nphotomultiplier tube, and the scintillation light is isotropic. Here we take\ninto account Fermat's principle, which tells us that indeed the first light to\nreach the PMTs will be on or near the lightcone, the \"Fermat surface\", and that\ndirectional track information is available. Moreover we have realized that\nparticle type distinction is possible (quasi-elastic muons from electrons). In\nfact the resolution from a detector of comparable size to SuperKamiokande, may\nbe better in both angle, energy and possibly particle type.

Moreover, this capability can be\ndemonstrated with the use of (future) KamLAND detected events in the new long\nbaseline neutrino beam from the Jaeri accelerator in Japan, due to start\noperations this year. Some of the most attractive possibilities for the future\nmay be in using Hanohano as a movable long baseline detector in this same beam,\nthe employment of LENA in Europe in future long baseline neutrino beams from\nCERN, and in the DUSEL underground laboratory at Homestake. \n\n"}

Such events have played\nan important role in the commissioning of the detector since the start of the\ninstallation phase in 2005 and were particularly important for understanding\nthe detector performance in the time prior to the arrival of the first LHC\nbeams.

The experiment includes a sophisticated near detector complex, 280 m\ndownstream of the neutrino production target in order to measure the properties\nof the neutrino beam and to better understand neutrino interactions at the\nenergy scale below a few GeV. A key element of the near detectors is the ND280\ntracker, consisting of two active scintillator-bar target systems surrounded by\nthree large time projection chambers (TPCs) for charged particle tracking. The\ndata collected with the tracker is used to study charged current neutrino\ninteraction rates and kinematics prior to oscillation, in order to reduce\nuncertainties in the oscillation measurements by the far detector.

We find\noptimal baselines of about 2500 km to 5000 km for the CP violation measurement,\nwhere now values of E_mu as low as about 12 GeV may be possible. However, for\nlarge theta_{13}, we demonstrate that the lower threshold and the backgrounds\nreconstructed at lower energies allow in fact for muon energies as low as 5 GeV\nat considerably shorter baselines, such as FNAL-Homestake.

The nominal depletion\nvoltage being 3000V, the detector under investigation shows a peculiar behavior\nfor biases around 2000V: in a narrow range of about 100V the charge collection\nis strongly reduced. The detector seems to be composed by two parts: a small\nvolume around the HV contact where charges are efficiently collected as at\nhigher voltage, and a large volume where charges are poorly collected.

{"id": "1103.0986", "contents": "Title: Xenon Recirculation-Purification with a Heat Exchanger Abstract: Liquid-xenon based particle detectors have been dramatically growing in size\nduring the last years, and are now exceeding the one-ton scale. The required\nhigh xenon purity is usually achieved by continuous recirculation of xenon gas\nthrough a high-temperature getter. This challenges the traditional way of\ncooling these large detectors, since in a thermally well insulated detector,\nmost of the cooling power is spent to compensate losses from recirculation. The\nphase change during recondensing requires five times more cooling power than\ncooling the gas from ambient temperature to -100C (173 K). Thus, to reduce the\ncooling power requirements for large detectors, we propose to use the heat from\nthe purified incoming gas to evaporate the outgoing xenon gas, by means of a\nheat exchanger. Generally, a heat exchanger would appear to be only of very\nlimited use, since evaporation and liquefaction occur at zero temperature\ndifference. However, the use of a recirculation pump reduces the pressure of\nthe extracted liquid, forces it to evaporate, and thus cools it down. We show\nthat this temperature difference can be used for an efficient heat exchange\nprocess. We investigate the use of a commercial parallel plate heat exchanger\nwith a small liquid xenon detector. Although we expected to be limited by the\navailable cooling power to flow rates of about 2 SLPM, rates in excess of 12\nSLPM can easily be sustained, limited only by the pump speed and the impedance\nof the flow loop. The heat exchanger operates with an efficiency of (96.8 +/-\n0.5)%. This opens the possibility for fast xenon gas recirculation in\nlarge-scale experiments, while minimizing thermal losses. \n\n"}

Using data taken in 2010, LHCb has applied two\nmethods to determine the absolute scale of its luminosity measurements for\nproton-proton collisions at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV.

In this thesis we develop a modified\nversion of the SiD simulation model for CLIC, taking into account the specific\nexperimental conditions. In addition, we developed a software tool to\ninvestigate the impact of beam-related backgrounds on the detector by\noverlaying events from different simulated event samples. Moreover, we present\nfull simulation studies, determining the performance of the calorimeter and\ntracking systems. We show that the track reconstruction in the all-silicon\ntracker of SiD is robust in the presence of the backgrounds at CLIC.\nFurthermore, we investigate tungsten as a dense absorber material for the\nhadronic calorimeter, which allows for the construction of a compact hadronic\ncalorimeter that fulfills the requirements on the energy resolution and shower\ncontainment without a significant increase of the coil radius. Finally, the\nmeasurement of the decays of light Higgs bosons into two muons is studied in\nfull simulation. We find that with an integrated luminosity of 2 ab$^{-1}$,\ncorresponding to 4 years of data taking at CLIC, the respective Higgs branching\nratio can be determined with a statistical uncertainty of approximately 15%. \n\n"}

At hadron colliders the dominant\nfraction of hits is due to low momentum tracks for which multiple scattering\n(MS) effects dominate the hit resolution. MS is also the dominating source for\nhit confusion and track uncertainties in low energy precision experiments. In\nall such environments, where MS dominates, track reconstruction and fitting can\nbe largely simplified by using three-dimensional (3D) hit-triplets as provided\nby pixel detectors. This simplification is possible since track uncertainties\nare solely determined by MS if high precision spatial information is provided.\nFitting of hit-triplets is especially simple for tracking detectors in\nsolenoidal magnetic fields. The over-constrained 3D-triplet method provides a\ncomplete set of track parameters and is robust against fake hit combinations.\nThe triplet method is ideally suited for pixel detectors where hits can be\ntreated as 3D-space points. With the advent of relatively cheap and\nindustrially available CMOS-sensors the construction of highly granular full\nscale pixel tracking detectors seems to be possible also for experiments at LHC\nor future high energy (hadron) colliders.

With this\nspecial choice of the NSI parameters, we observe a shift in the oscillation\namplitude without distorting the $L/E$ pattern of the oscillation probability.\nThis shift in the depth of the oscillation dip can be caused by the NSI\nparameters as well as by $\\theta_{13}$, making it quite difficult to\ndisentangle the NSI effects from the standard oscillations. We explore the\ncorrelations between the NSI parameters and $\\theta_{13}$ that may lead to\nsignificant deviations in the reported value of the reactor mixing angle with\nthe help of iso-probability surface plots. Finally, we present the limits on\nelectron, muon/tau, and flavor universal (FU) NSI couplings with and without\nconsidering the uncertainty in the normalization of the total event rates.\nAssuming a perfect knowledge of the event rates normalization, we find strong\nupper bounds $\\sim$ 0.1\\% for the electron and FU cases improving the present\nlimits by one order of magnitude. However, for a conservative error of 5\\% in\nthe total normalization, these constraints are relaxed by almost one order of\nmagnitude. \n\n"}

The effects of resolution broadening from multiple scattering\ndiminish with increasing muon momentum. As the momentum of the muon increases,\nthe contrast of the image goes down and therefore requires higher resolution in\nthe muon spectrometer to resolve the image.

In this paper single crystal sapphire sensors\nare considered as a promising alternative. Industrially grown sapphire wafers\nare available in large sizes, are of low cost and, like diamond sensors, can be\noperated without cooling.

It\ncomprises 8 sapphire plates of 1 cm^2 size and 525 micro m thickness,\nmetallized on both sides, and apposed to form a stack. Each second metal layer\nis supplied with a bias voltage, and the layers in between are connected to\ncharge-sensitive preamplifiers. The performance of the detector was studied in\na 5 GeV electron beam. The charge collection efficiency measured as a function\nof the bias voltage rises with the voltage, reaching about 10 % at 950 V.

The space-time is five dimensional and the extra flat\nspatial dimension is compactified on the orbifold $S^1/(Z_2 \\times Z_2')$,\nleading to Pati-Salam gauge symmetry on the boundary where Yukawa interactions\nare localised. The gauge symmetry breaking is completed by means of a rather\neconomic scalar sector, avoiding the doublet-triplet splitting problem. The\nmatter fields live in the bulk and their massless modes get exponential\nprofiles, which naturally explain the mass hierarchy of the different fermion\ngenerations. Quarks and leptons properties are naturally reproduced by a\nmechanism, first proposed by Kitano and Li, that lifts the SO(10) degeneracy of\nbulk masses in terms of a single parameter.

Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks.

At present it is not possible to\neven transfer most of this data from the four main particle detectors at the\nLHC to \"offline\" data facilities, much less to permanently store it for future\nprocessing. For this reason the LHC detectors are equipped with real-time\nanalysis systems, called triggers, which process this volume of data and select\nthe most interesting proton-proton collisions. The LHC experiment triggers\nreduce the data produced by the LHC by between 1/1000 and 1/100000, to tens of\npetabytes per year, allowing its economical storage and further analysis. The\nbulk of the data-reduction is performed by custom electronics which ignores\nmost of the data in its decision making, and is therefore unable to exploit the\nmost powerful known data analysis strategies.

While the spallation target outperforms\nstandard targets in the backward direction by more than a factor 7 it is not\nmore efficient than standard targets viewed under 90{\\deg}. Not surprisingly,\nthe geometry of the target plays a large role in the generation of surface\nmuons. Through careful optimization, a gain in surface muon rate of between 30\n- 60% over the standard \"box-like\" target used at the Paul Scherrer Institute\ncould be achieved by employing a rotated slab target. An additional 10% gain\ncould also be possible by utilizing novel target materials such as, e.g., boron\ncarbide. \n\n"}

The performance\nof gaseous Xe can be further improved by molecular additives such as\ntrimethylamine(TMA), which is expected to (1) cool down the ionization\nelectrons, (2) convert Xe excitation energy to TMA ionizations through Penning\ntransfer, and (3) produce scintillation and electroluminescence light in a more\neasily detectable wavelength (300 nm). In order to test the feasibility of the\nperformance improvements with TMA, we made the first direct measurement of\nPenning and fluorescence transfer efficiency with gaseous mixtures of Xe and\nTMA. While we observed a Penning transfer efficiency up to ~35%, we found\nstrong suppression of primary scintillation light with TMA.

The signal obtained from these\ndetectors depends first on the physics of the medium (the initial scintillation\nand ionization), and second how the physics of the detector manipulates the\nresulting photons and liberated electrons. In this paper we develop a model of\nthe detector physics that incorporates event topology, detector geometry,\nelectric field configuration, purity, optical properties of components, and\nwavelength shifters. We present an analytic form of the model, which allows for\ngeneral study of detector design and operation, and a Monte Carlo model which\nenables a more detailed exploration of S2 events.

The role of e-ion recombination is\ndiscussed for both parent recombination and volume recombination.

Subsequently, the\nplasma time that determines the volume recombination probability at non-zero\nfield is demonstrated to be different between electronic recoils and nuclear\nrecoils due to the difference of ionization density between two processes.

The most advanced of these proposals have very similar\nsetups, in which a proton beam strikes a target yielding neutrons which are\nabsorbed by a high isotopic purity 7Li converter, yielding 8Li whose resulting\ndecay yields the antineutrinos. In this note, we use FLUKA and GEANT4\nsimulations to investigate three proposed modifications of this standard\nproposal. In the first, the 7Li is replaced with 7Li compounds including a\ndeuterium moderator. In the second, a gap is placed between the target and the\nconverter to reduce the neutron bounce-back.

The gas inside\nthe TPCs can be used as an active target to study the neutrino interactions in\ngreat detail. The low density of the gas leads to very low track energy\nthresholds, allowing the reconstruction of very low momentum tracks, e.g.\nprotons with kinetic energies down to $\\mathcal{O}$(1 MeV). Since different\nnuclear interaction models vary considerably in their predictions of those low\nmomentum track multiplicities, this makes neutrino interactions on gases a\npowerful probe to test those models. The TPCs operate with an argon-based gas\nmixture (95% by volume) and have been exposed to the T2K neutrino beam since\nthe beginning of the experiment in 2010. Due to the low total mass of the gas,\nneutrino argon interactions happen only rarely, compared to the surrounding\nscintillator-based detectors. We expect about 600 such events in the recorded\ndata so far (about 200 in the fiducial volume). We are able to separate those\nevents from the background and thus demonstrate the viability of using gaseous\nargon as a target for a neutrino beam. This enables us to do a cross- section\nmeasurement on gaseous argon, the first measurement of this kind.

By profiling the performance of the reconstruction\nalgorithm on simulation we show that the ability to identify and include energy\ndeposited by radiative photons leads to a significant improvement in the energy\nmeasurement of low-energy electrons. The fractional energy resolution we\nmeasure improves from over 30% to ~20% when we attempt to include radiative\nphotons in the reconstruction. These studies are relevant to a large number of\nanalyses which aim to study neutrinos by measuring electrons produced by\n$\\nu_e$ interactions over a broad energy range. \n\n"}

In this paper, the discriminating\nvariables and the algorithms used for heavy-flavour jet identification during\nthe first years of operation of the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions\nat a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, are presented. Heavy-flavour jet\nidentification algorithms have been improved compared to those used previously\nat centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. For jets with transverse momenta in\nthe range expected in simulated $\\mathrm{t}\\overline{\\mathrm{t}}$ events, these\nnew developments result in an efficiency of 68% for the correct identification\nof a b jet for a probability of 1% of misidentifying a light-flavour jet.

Consequently\nnon-negligible degradation of azimuthal spatial resolution is caused due to\nthis IBF. Meanwhile, it is necessary to collect primary ionized electrons to\nmaintain intrinsic performance of the MPGDs. The MPGD based TPC is currently\nplanned to be used as a central tracking detector of the International Large\nDetector (ILD), which is one of the detector concepts for the future\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC) project, and which requires fine azimuthal\nspatial resolution of less than 100 ${\\rm \\mu m}$ over the drift length of the\nTPC to attain high momentum resolution.

However, it is limited by the diffusion of electrons. It is known\nthat the addition of a small fraction of a molecular gas to xenon reduces\nelectron diffusion. On the other hand, the electroluminescence (EL) yield drops\nand the achievable energy resolution may be compromised. We have studied the\neffect of adding several molecular gases to xenon (CO${}_{2}$, CH${}_{4}$ and\nCF${}_{4}$) on the EL yield and energy resolution obtained in a small prototype\nof driftless gas proportional scintillation counter. We have compared our\nresults on the scintillation characteristics (EL yield and energy resolution)\nwith a microscopic simulation, obtaining the diffusion coefficients in those\nconditions as well. Accordingly, electron diffusion may be reduced from about\n10 mm/$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$ for pure xenon down to 2.5 mm/$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$\nusing additive concentrations of about 0.05%, 0.2% and 0.02% for CO${}_{2}$,\nCH${}_{4}$ and CF${}_{4}$, respectively. Our results show that CF${}_{4}$\nadmixtures present the highest EL yield in those conditions, but very poor\nenergy resolution as a result of huge fluctuations observed in the EL\nformation. CH${}_{4}$ presents the best energy resolution despite the EL yield\nbeing the lowest. The results obtained with xenon admixtures are extrapolated\nto the operational conditions of the NEXT-100 TPC. CO${}_{2}$ and CH${}_{4}$\nshow potential as molecular additives in a large xenon TPC, CH${}_{4}$ showing\nthe best performance and stability to be used in the NEXT-100 TPC, with an\nextrapolated energy resolution of 0.4% at 2.45 MeV for concentrations below\n0.4%. \n\n"}

Substantial increases of\nmomentum resolution respect to standard fit is obtained. The key point is the\nuse of a realistic probability distribution for each hit (heteroscedasticity).\nTwo different methods are used for the fits, the first method introduces an\neffective variance for each hit, the second method implements the maximum\nlikelihood search. The tracker model is similar to the PAMELA tracker. Each\nside, of the two sided of the PAMELA detectors, is simulated as momentum\nreconstruction device. One of the two is similar to silicon micro-strip\ndetectors of large use in running experiments. Two different position\nreconstructions are used for the standard fits, the $\\eta$-algorithm (the best\none) and the two-strip center of gravity. The gain obtained in momentum\nresolution is measured as the virtual magnetic field and the virtual\nsignal-to-noise ratio required by the two standard fits to reach an overlap\nwith the best of two new methods. For the best side, the virtual magnetic field\nmust be increased 1.5 times respect to the real field to reach the overlap and\n1.8 for the other. For the high noise side, the increases must be 1.8 and 2.0.\nThe signal-to-noise ratio has similar increases but only for the\n$\\eta$-algorithm. The signal-to-noise ratio has no effect on the fits with the\ncenter of gravity. Very important results are obtained if the number N of\ndetecting layers is increased, our methods provide a momentum resolution\ngrowing linearly with N, much higher than standard fits that grow as the\n$\\sqrt{N}$. \n\n"}

The latter are of\ncourse inspired by the perceived demands of future experiments, and/or the\nincreasing demands of the current generation of experiments, as these are\nconfronted with, for example, increased luminosity.

Despite the great\nsensitivity attained after 60 years of developments, the result of the\nexperiments is still compatible with zero. Still, new experiments have a high\ndiscovery potential since they probe new physics at the multi-TeV scale, beyond\nthe reach of direct searches at colliders.

The study of rare events, not contemplated in the Standard\nModel, can greatly benefit from the use of this kind of detectors. In\nparticular, a deeper understanding of atmospheric neutrino properties will be\nobtained thanks to the unprecedented quality of the data ICARUS provides.\nHowever if we concentrate on the T600 performance, most of the $\\nu_\\mu$\ncharged current sample will be partially contained, due to the reduced\ndimensions of the detector. In this article, we address the problem of how well\nwe can determine the kinematics of events having partially contained tracks.\nThe analysis of a large sample of atmospheric muons collected during the T600\ntest run demonstrate that, in case the recorded track is at least one meter\nlong, the muon momentum can be reconstructed by an algorithm that measures the\nMultiple Coulomb Scattering along the particle's path. Moreover, we show that\nmomentum resolution can be improved by a factor two using an algorithm based on\nthe Kalman Filtering technique. \n\n"}

Polyakov and G.~ 'tHooft in 1974. Numerous and unsuccessful attempts of\nexperimental search for monopole in cosmic rays and on accelerators in high\nenergy particle collisions have been done. Also the searches have been carried\nout in mica for monopole tracks as well as for relict monopoles, entrapped by\nferromagnetic inclusions in iron-ores, moon rock and meteorites. These\nentrapped monopoles, when released, would have the lowest velocities\n$\\beta<10^{-6}$ and do not yield ionization at all, and are hard to detect.\nTherefore it is necessary to examine thoroughly the mechanisms of slow heavy\nmonopole interaction with matter and their scale of energy loss.\n  We discuss here the interaction of a massive slow magnetic monopole with\nmagnetically ordered matter, with conductors, superconductors and with\ncondensed matter in general. Our results indicate that the energy loss of a\nslow supermassive monopole reach $10^{8} eV/cm$ and more if we take into\nconsideration the Cherenkov radiation of magnons or phonons and conductivity of\nthe media. A new method of search for cosmic and relict monopoles by\nmagnetically ordered film is considered too. This approach resembles the\ntraditional method of nuclear emulsion chamber.
