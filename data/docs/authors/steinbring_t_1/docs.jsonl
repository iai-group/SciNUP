Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach. We also briefly discuss how the SZ and\nX-ray cluster data can be combined to resolve the helium abundance dependence\nfor the d_a(z) cosmological test. \n\n"}

The central regions\nof the intracluster medium (ICM) can have cooling timescales of ~200 Myr or\nshorter--in order to prevent a cooling catastrophe the ICM must be heated by\nsome mechanism such as AGN feedback or thermal conduction from the thermal\nreservoir at large radii. The cores of galaxy clusters are linearly unstable to\nthe heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI), which significantly changes\nthe thermodynamics of the cluster core. The HBI is a convective,\nbuoyancy-driven instability that rearranges the magnetic field to be\npreferentially perpendicular to the temperature gradient. For a wide range of\nparameters, our simulations demonstrate that in the presence of the HBI, the\neffective radial thermal conductivity is reduced to less than 10% of the full\nSpitzer conductivity. With this suppression of conductive heating, the cooling\ncatastrophe occurs on a timescale comparable to the central cooling time of the\ncluster.

The vortices (and thus magnetic\nflux) would be expelled from the star during stellar spin-down, leading to\nmagnetic reconnection at the surface of the star and the prolific production of\nthermal energy.

The\ndifferences between pulses are due both to the intrinsic diversity in the\nblobs' properties and to their orientation with respect to the line of sight.\nWe show that the peak flux and the polarization of each pulse are connected\nthrough the orientation of the blob that produces the pulse, while the position\nangle fluctuates randomly from one pulse to the next and is constant within an\nindividual pulse.

The seventies were a golden era for gamma-ray and\ncosmic-ray astrophysics, with the (re)discovery of the \"diffuse shock\nacceleration\" theory for cosmic rays, and the first CO and GeV gamma-ray\nsurveys of the galactic plane, verifying the importance of pi-zero decay in the\nlarge-scale gamma-ray emission of the Galaxy. But because of this strong\ngalactic background, GeV gamma-ray sources were hard to identify. The first\nsuch sources definitely identified were three pulsars, with a suggestion that\nsupernova remnants interacting with molecular clouds in massive star-forming\nregions (\"SNOBs\") were also gamma-ray sources.

Such an\nassumption is valid in the weak field, as verified by precision experiments and\nobservations, but it need not hold in the dynamical strong-field regime where\ntests are lacking. Fundamental bias can cause systematic errors in the\ndetection and parameter estimation of signals, which can lead to a\nmischaracterization of the universe through incorrect inferences about source\nevent rates and populations. We propose a remedy through the introduction of\nthe parameterized post-Einsteinian framework, which consists of the enhancement\nof waveform templates via the inclusion of post-Einsteinian parameters. These\nparameters would ostensibly be designed to interpolate between templates\nconstructed in general relativity and well-motivated alternative theories of\ngravity, and also include extrapolations that follow sound theoretical\nprinciples, such as consistency with conservation laws and symmetries. As an\nexample, we construct parameterized post-Einsteinian templates for the binary\ncoalescence of equal-mass, non-spinning compact objects in a quasi-circular\ninspiral.

In this paper, the condition\nfor planetesimal accretion is investigated around Alpha CenB, which is believed\nto be an ideal candidate for detection of an Earth-like planet in or near its\nhabitable zone(0.5-0.9 AU).

Twenty-four cases with different binary\ninclinations(i_B=0, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 deg), gas densities(0.3,1,and 3 times of\nthe Minimum Mass of Solar Nebula, MMSN hereafter), and with and without gas\ndepletion, are simulated.

In terms of\nstellar structure, SN Ib/c progenitors in binary systems are predicted to have\na wide range of final masses even up to 7 Msun, with helium envelopes of 0.16 -\n1.5 Msun.

Such a short\nquiescent period between outbursts has never been seen before from a neutron\nstar X-ray transient. X-ray pulsations at the 599 Hz spin frequency are\ndetected throughout both outbursts. For the first time, we derive a pulse phase\nmodel that connects two outbursts, providing a long baseline for spin frequency\nmeasurement. Comparison with the frequency measured during the 2004 outburst of\nthis source gives a spin-down during quiescence of -4(1)x10^-15 Hz/s,\napproximately an order of magnitude larger than the long-term spin-down\nobserved in the 401 Hz accretion-powered pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. If this\nspin-down is due to magnetic dipole radiation, it requires a 2x10^8 G field\nstrength, and its high spin-down luminosity may be detectable with the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope. Alternatively, this large spin-down could be produced by\ngravitational wave emission from a fractional mass quadrupole moment of Q/I =\n1x10^{-9}. The rapid succession of the outbursts also provides a unique test of\nmodels for accretion in low-mass X-ray binaries. Disk instability models\ngenerally predict that an outburst will leave the accretion disk too depleted\nto fuel a second outburst after such a brief quiescence. We suggest a\nmodification in which the outburst is shut off by the onset of a propeller\neffect before the disk is depleted.

For an on-axis observer, the photosphere appears concave shaped\ndue to the low density and high beaming factor of the jet. The luminosity\nvaries because of the abrupt change in the position of the photosphere due to\nthe internal structure of the jet. Comparing our results with GRB090902B, the\nflux level of the thermal-like component is similar to our model, although the\npeak energy looks a little bit higher (but still within a factor of 2).

We detected a total of 57 thermonuclear bursts\nthroughout the outburst with AGILE, Swift, RXTE, and INTEGRAL. The wide range\nof inferred accretion rates (between <1% and about 20% of the Eddington\naccretion rate m-dot_Edd) spanned during the outburst allows us to study\nchanges in the nuclear burning processes and to identify up to seven different\nphases.

Aims. Our goal is to study\nthe timing and spectral properties of GX 339-4 using its recent outburst data\nand extract information about the nature of the accretion flow. Methods. We use\nRXTE archival data of the recent GX 339-4 outburst and analyze them with the\nNASA HEAsoft package, version 6.8.

We found that the QPO frequencies are monotonically increasing from\n0.102 Hz to 5.69 Hz within a period of ~ 26 days. We explain this evolution\nwith the propagating oscillatory shock (POS) solution and find the variation of\nthe initial and final shock locations and strengths. The model fits also give\nthe velocity of the propagating shock wave, which is responsible for the\ngeneration of QPOs and their evolutions, at ~ 10 m/s. We observe from the\nspectra that up to 2010 April 10, the object was in a hard state. After that,\nit went to the hard-intermediate state.

We find that the average LAT gamma-ray spectrum of\nMrk 501 can be well described by a single power-law function with a photon\nindex of 1.78 +/- 0.03. While we observe relatively mild flux variations with\nthe Fermi-LAT (within less than a factor of 2), we detect remarkable spectral\nvariability where the hardest observed spectral index within the LAT energy\nrange is 1.52 +/- 0.14, and the softest one is 2.51 +/- 0.20. These unexpected\nspectral changes do not correlate with the measured flux variations above\n0.3GeV. In this paper, we also present the first results from the\n4.5-month-long multifrequency campaign (2009 March 15 - August 1) on Mrk 501,\nwhich included the VLBA, Swift, RXTE, MAGIC and VERITAS, the F-GAMMA,\nGASP-WEBT, and other collaborations and instruments which provided excellent\ntemporal and energy coverage of the source throughout the entire campaign. The\naverage spectral energy distribution of Mrk 501 is well described by the\nstandard one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. In the framework of this\nmodel, we find that the dominant emission region is characterized by a size <~\n0.1 pc (comparable within a factor of few to the size of the partially-resolved\nVLBA core at 15-43 GHz), and that the total jet power (~10^{44} erg s^{-1})\nconstitutes only a small fraction (~10^{-3}) of the Eddington luminosity.

This conclusion was obtained by extrapolating the apparent orientation\nof the narrow line region to the inner parts of the ionisation cones.

Furthermore, X-ray\npolarimetry across a broad photon energy range may independently verify the\nmisalignment between the ionisation cones and the axis of the torus. To model\nthe expected polarisation percentage and position angle, we apply the radiative\ntransfer code STOKES.

This is\ndue in part to the proximity of a hot soft photon bath from the stellar surface\nto putative radiation dissipation regions in the inner magnetosphere. Moreover,\nbecause the scattering process becomes resonant at the cyclotron frequency, the\neffective cross section exceeds the classical Thomson value by over two orders\nof magnitude, thereby enhancing the efficiency of continuum production and the\ncooling of relativistic electrons. This paper presents computations of the\nelectron cooling rates for this process, which are needed for resonant Compton\nmodels of non-thermal radiation from such highly-magnetized pulsars. The\ncomputed rates extend previous calculations of magnetic Thomson cooling to the\ndomain of relativistic quantum effects, sampled near and above the quantum\ncritical magnetic field of 44.13 TeraGauss.

We have developed an orthonormalization process to apply this basis to\npixelized images, and implemented the method as a Python pipeline. The new\nbasis displays remarkable flexibility, being able to accurately fit all kinds\nof galaxy shapes, including irregulars, spirals, ellipticals, highly compact\nand highly elongated galaxies. It does this while using fewer components that\nsimilar methods, as shapelets, and without producing artifacts, due to the\nefficiency of the rational Chebyshev polynomials to fit quickly decaying\nfunctions like galaxy profiles. The method is lineal and very stable, and\ntherefore capable of processing large numbers of galaxies in a fast and\nautomated way. Due to the high quality of the fits in the central parts of the\ngalaxies, and the efficiency of the CHEF basis modeling galaxy profiles up to\nvery large distances, the method provides highly accurate estimates of total\ngalaxy fluxes and ellipticities. Future papers will explore in more detail the\napplication of the method to perform multiband photometry, morphological\nclassification and weak shear measurements. \n\n"}

We demonstrate that the time evolution of the\naxisymmetric force-free magnetic fields can be expressed in terms of the\nhyperbolic Grad-Shafranov equation. We find exact non-linear time-dependent\nsplit-monopole structure of magnetosphere driven by spinning and collapsing NS\nin Schwarzschild geometry. Based on this solution, we argue that the collapse\nof a NS into the BH happens smoothly, without natural formation of current\nsheets or other dissipative structures on the open field lines and, thus, does\nnot allow the magnetic field to become disconnected from the star and escape to\ninfinity. Thus, as long as an isolated Kerr BH can produce plasma and currents,\nit does not lose its open magnetic field lines, its magnetospheric structure\nevolved towards a split monopole and the BH spins down electromagnetically. The\n\"no hair theorem\", which assumes that the outside medium is a vacuum, is not\napplicable in this case: highly conducting plasma introduces a topological\nconstraint forbidding the disconnection of the magnetic field lines from the\nBH. Eventually, a single random large scale spontaneous reconnection event will\nlead to magnetic field release, shutting down the electromagnetic BH engine\nforever.

Correlations between Flux, Color, and\n  Polarization Abstract: We report on the correlation between the flux, color and polarization\nvariations on time scales of days--months in blazars, and discuss their\nuniversal aspects. We performed monitoring of 42 blazars in the optical and\nnear-infrared bands from 2008 to 2010 using TRISPEC attached to the \"Kanata\"\n1.5-m telescope. We found that 28 blazars exhibited \"bluer-when-brighter\"\ntrends in their whole or a part of time-series data sets. This corresponds to\n88% of objects that were observed for >10 days. Thus, our observation\nunambiguously confirmed that the \"bluer-when-brighter\" trend is common in the\nemission from blazar jets. This trend was apparently generated by a variation\ncomponent with a constant and relatively blue color and an underlying red\ncomponent. Prominent short-term flares on time scales of days--weeks tended to\nexhibit a spectral hysteresis; their rising phases were bluer than their decay\nphases around the flare maxima. In contrast to the strong flux--color\ncorrelation, the correlation of the flux and polarization degree was relatively\nweak; only 10 objects showed significant positive correlations. Rotations of\npolarization were detected only in three objects: PKS 1510-089, 3C 454.3, and\nPKS 1749+096, and possibly in S5 0716+714.

Our observation suggests the presence of\nseveral distinct emitting sources, which have different variation time-scales,\ncolors, and polarizations.

We show that it is likely that the short burst was indeed\noriginating from LS I +61 303 (although we cannot totally exclude the\nimprobable presence of a far-away line-of-sight magnetar) and that it is a\ndifferent phenomena with respect to the previously-observed ks-long flares from\nthis system. Accepting as a hypothesis that LS I +61 303 is the first magnetar\ndetected in a binary system, we study which are the implications. We find that\na magnetar-composed LS I +61 303-system would most likely be (i.e., for usual\nmagnetar parameters and mass-loss rate) subject to a flip-flop behavior, from a\nrotational powered regime (in apastron) to a propeller regime (in periastron)\nalong each of the LS I +61 303, eccentric orbital motion.

This flip-flop\nscenario would explain the system's behavior where a recurrent TeV emission was\nseen appearing near apastron only, the anti-correlation of GeV and TeV\nemission, and the long-term TeV variability (which seems correlated to LS I +61\n303's super-orbital period), including the appearance of a low TeV-state.\nFinally, we qualitatively put the multi-wavelength phenomenology in context of\nour proposed model, and make some predictions for further testing. \n\n"}

The optical prompt emission was detected by\nSwift/UVOT, ROTSE-IIIb and BOOTES telescopes when the GRB was still radiating\nin the gamma-ray band. Nearly 200 s of observations were obtained\nsimultaneously from optical, X-ray to gamma-ray, which makes it one of the\nexceptional cases to study the broadband spectral energy distribution across 6\norders of magnitude in energy during the prompt emission phase. By fitting the\ntime resolved prompt spectra, we clearly identify, for the first time, an\ninteresting two-break energy spectrum, roughly consistent with the standard GRB\nsynchrotron emission model in the fast cooling regime. Although the prompt\noptical emission is brighter than the extrapolation of the best fit X/gamma-ray\nspectra, it traces the gamma-ray light curve shape, suggesting a relation to\nthe prompt high energy emission. The synchrotron + SSC scenario is disfavored\nby the data, but the models invoking a pair of internal shocks or having two\nemission regions can interpret the data well.

Within the framework of classical error models, the\ndependent variable relates to the independent variable according to the usual\nadditive model. The classes of linear models considered are regression lines in\nthe limit of uncorrelated errors in X and in Y. For homoscedastic data, the\nresults are taken from earlier attempts and rewritten using a more compact\nnotation. For heteroscedastic data, the results are inferred from a procedure\nrelated to functional models. An example of astronomical application is\nconsidered, concerning the [O/H]-[Fe/H] empirical relations deduced from five\nsamples related to different stars and/or different methods of oxygen abundance\ndetermination.

An important question is\nwhether the distribution of arrival directions for such UHECR nuclei can\nexhibit observable anisotropy or positional correlations with their\nastrophysical source objects despite the expected strong deflections by\nintervening magnetic fields.

Assuming that only iron nuclei\nare injected steadily from sources with equal luminosity and spatially\ndistributed according to the observed large scale structure in the local\nUniverse, at the number of events published by the PAO so far, the arrival\ndistribution of UHECRs would be consistent with no auto-correlation at 95%\nconfidence if the mean number density of UHECR sources $n_s >~ 10^{-6}$\nMpc$^{-3}$, and consistent with no cross-correlation with sources within 95%\nerrors for $n_s >~ 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$.

The canonical thermally\naveraged cross section for a generic WIMP is usually stated as 3*10^-26\ncm^3s^-1, with unspecified uncertainty, and taken to be independent of WIMP\nmass. Recent searches for annihilation products of DM annihilation have just\nreached the sensitivity to exclude this canonical cross section for 100%\nbranching ratio to certain final states and small WIMP masses. The ultimate\ngoal is to probe all kinematically allowed final states as a function of mass\nand, if all states are adequately excluded, set a lower limit to the WIMP mass.\nProbing the low-mass region is further motivated due to recent hints for a\nlight WIMP in direct and indirect searches.

In this paper, we present an approach to foreground removal that\nexplicitly accounts for this frequency dependence. We apply the delay\ntransformation introduced in Parsons & Backer (2009) to each baseline of an\ninterferometer to concentrate smooth-spectrum foregrounds within the bounds of\nthe maximum geometric delays physically realizable on that baseline. By\nfocusing on delay-modes that correspond to image-domain regions beyond the\nhorizon, we show that it is possible to avoid the bulk of smooth-spectrum\nforegrounds. We map the point-spread function of delay-modes to k-space,\nshowing that delay-modes that are uncorrupted by foregrounds also represent\nsamples of the three-dimensional power spectrum, and can be used to constrain\ncosmic reionization. Because it uses only spectral smoothness to differentiate\nforegrounds from the targeted 21cm signature, this per-baseline analysis\napproach relies on spectrally- and spatially-smooth instrumental responses for\nforeground removal.

The two are roughly in\npressure equilibrium, with the UFOs potentially providing additional support\nfor the initial jet collimation. The UFOs are much more massive than the jet,\nbut their kinetic power is probably about an order of magnitude lower, at least\nfor the observations considered here.

First, we investigate the contribution of intergalactic\ncascades induced by gamma-rays and/or cosmic rays (CRs) to the diffuse\ngamma-ray background (DGB) in view of the latest Fermi data. We identify a\npossible VHE Excess from the fact that the Fermi data are well above\nexpectations for an attenuated power law, and show that cascades induced by VHE\ngamma rays (above ~10 TeV) and/or VHECRs (below ~10^19 eV) may significantly\ncontribute to the DGB above ~100 GeV. The relevance of the cascades is also\nmotivated by the intergalactic cascade interpretations of extreme TeV blazars\nsuch as 1ES 0229+200, which suggest very hard intrinsic spectra.

However, even for\nstronger magnetic fields, the GeV delay can be explained with hadronic models,\ndue to the long acceleration timescale of protons and the continuous photopion\nproduction after the end of the particle injection. While the FWHMs of the MeV\nand GeV lightcurves are almost the same in one-zone leptonic models, the FWHM\nof the 1--30 GeV lightcurves in hadronic models are significantly wider than\nthose of the 0.1--1 MeV lightcurves.

We report here on VHE gamma-ray observations of the Coma galaxy\ncluster with the VERITAS array of imaging Cherenkov telescopes, with\ncomplementing Fermi-LAT observations at GeV energies. No significant gamma-ray\nemission from the Coma cluster was detected. Integral flux upper limits at the\n99% confidence level were measured to be on the order of (2-5)*10^-8\\ ph. m^-2\ns^-1 (VERITAS, >220 GeV} and ~2*10^-6 ph. m^-2 s^-1 (Fermi, 1-3 GeV),\nrespectively. We use the gamma-ray upper limits to constrain CRs and magnetic\nfields in Coma. Using an analytical approach, the CR-to-thermal pressure ratio\nis constrained to be < 16% from VERITAS data and < 1.7% from Fermi data\n(averaged within the virial radius). These upper limits are starting to\nconstrain the CR physics in self-consistent cosmological cluster simulations\nand cap the maximum CR acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to\nbe <50%.

Given recent evidence of similar gamma-ray lines from the Inner\nGalaxy, it is tempting to interpret these unassociated sources as nearby dark\nmatter subhalos, powered by ongoing annihilations. In this paper, we study the\nspectrum, luminosity, and angular distribution of these sources, with the\nintention of testing the hypothesis that they are, in fact, dark matter\nsubhalos. We find that of the 12 sources containing at least one prospective\nline photon, only 2 exhibit an overall gamma-ray spectrum which is consistent\nwith that predicted from dark matter annihilations (2FGL J2351.6-7558 and 2FGL\nJ0555.9-4348).

The emergent luminosity is powered by CSM interaction, analogous to the\nprocess in luminous Type IIn supernovae, except with 10 times lower explosion\nenergy and at slower speeds (causing a longer duration and lower emergent\nluminosity). Such an explosive event provides a natural explanation for the\nlight curve evolution, but also accounts for a number of puzzling attributes of\nthe Homunculus nebula: (1) rough equipartition of total radiated and kinetic\nenergy, (2) the double-shell structure of the Homunculus, (3) the apparent\nsingle age and Hubble-like flow resulting from the thin swept-up shell, (4) the\ncomplex mottled appearance of the polar lobes in HST images, arising from\nRaleigh-Taylor or Vishniac instabilities, (5) efficient and rapid dust\nformation, as seen in Type IIn supernovae, and (6) the fast (5000 km/s)\nmaterial outside the Homunculus, arising from the acceleration of the forward\nshock upon exiting the dense CSM.

This source had a massive hot\nprogenitor star identified in pre-explosion data, it had documented evidence of\npre-outburst variability, and it was subsequently discovered to have a 2nd\noutburst in 2010. This same source rebrightened again in 2012, and early\nspectra showed the same narrow-line profiles as before, suggesting another\nLBV-like eruption. We present new photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2009ip,\nindicating that it has transitioned into a true SN. The most striking discovery\nin these data is that unlike previous reports, the spectrum exhibited Balmer\nlines with very broad P-Cygni profiles characteristic of normal Type II\nsupernovae (SNe II), in addition to narrow emission lines seen in SNe IIn and\nLBVs. Emission components have FWHM 8000 km/s, while the P-Cygni absorption\ncomponent has blue wings extending to -13,000 km/s. These velocities are\ntypical of SNe II, but have never been associated with emission lines from a\nnonterminal LBV-like eruption. Initially, the peak absolute magnitude seemed\nfainter than that of normal SNe. However, after a brief period of fading, the\nsource quickly brightened again to M_R=-17.5 mag over a couple days.

We briefly discuss a number of science cases\nthat aim at studying the chemo-dynamical history of the major Galactic\ncomponents (bulge, thin and thick disks, and halo) - either as a follow-up to\nthe Gaia mission or on their own merits.

Our aim was to create a model\ndescribing highly deformed PSF in optical astronomy, allowing uncertainties\ncaused by image deformations to be reduced. Detailed laboratory measurements of\nPSF, pixel sensitivity, and pixel response functions were performed. These data\nwere used to create an effective high quality polynomial model of the PSF.\nFinally, tuning the model and tests in applications to the real sky data were\nperformed.\n  We have developed a PSF model that accurately describes even very deformed\nstars in our wide-field experiment. The model is suitable for use in any other\nexperiment with similar image deformation, with a simple tuning of its\nparameters. Applying this model to astrometric procedures results in a\nsignificant improvement over standard methods, while basic photometry precision\nperformed with the model is comparable to the results of an optimised aperture\nalgorithm. Additionally, the model was used to search for a weak signal --\nnamely a possible gamma ray burst optical precursor -- showing very promising\nresults. Precise modelling of the PSF function significantly improves the\nastrometric precision and enhances the discovery potential of a wide-field\nsystem with lens optics. \n\n"}

Violent\nmergers of two carbon--oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs) are one candidate\nsuggested to be responsible for at least a significant fraction of normal SNe\nIa. Here, we simulate the merger of two CO WDs using a moving-mesh code that\nallows for the inclusion of thin helium (He) shells (0.01\\,\\msun) on top of the\nWDs, at an unprecedented numerical resolution. The accretion of He onto the\nprimary WD leads to the formation of a detonation in its He shell. This\ndetonation propagates around the CO WD and sends a converging shock wave into\nits core, known to robustly trigger a second detonation, as in the well-known\ndouble-detonation scenario for\n  He-accreting CO WDs. However, in contrast to that scenario where a massive He\nshell is required to form a detonation through thermal instability, here the He\ndetonation is ignited dynamically. Accordingly the required He-shell mass is\nsignificantly smaller, and hence its burning products are unlikely to affect\nthe optical display of the explosion.

Using the recent\nresults on the X-ray efficiency dependence on pulsar characteristic age, we\nthen compute the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of rotation-powered pulsars.\nIn a general case it has a broken power-law shape with a high luminosity\ncutoff, which depends on the distributions of the birth spin period and the\nmagnetic field.\n  Using the observed XLF of sources in the nearby galaxies and the condition\nthat the pulsar XLF does not exceed that, we find the allowed region for the\nparameters describing the birth period distribution.

At first sight,\nthe tail luminosity decline rates that we measure are consistent with the\nradioactive decay of \\co, and would require 1-4M of \\ni to produce the\nluminosity. These \\ni masses cannot be made consistent with the short diffusion\ntimes at peak, and indeed are insufficient to power the peak luminosity. We\ninstead favour energy deposition by newborn magnetars as the power source for\nthese objects. A semi-analytical diffusion model with energy input from the\nspin-down of a magnetar reproduces the extensive lightcurve data well. The\nmodel predictions of ejecta velocities and temperatures which are required are\nin reasonable agreement with those determined from our observations.

Inverse Compton scattering of ambient photon fields\non relativistic particles diffusing through cluster environment is thought to\nbe the source of GeV-TeV emission of globular clusters. Using pair starved\npolar cap model gamma-ray emission from synthetic millisecond pulsar was\nmodelled. In addition to pulsar emission characteristics, the synthetic pulsar\nmodel yielded spectra of electrons escaping pulsar magnetosphere. To simulate\ngamma-ray emission of globular cluster, both products of synthetic millisecond\npulsar modelling were used. Gamma-ray spectra of synthetic millisecond pulsars\nresiding in the cluster were summed to produce the magnetospheric component of\ncluster emission. Electrons ejected by these pulsars were injected into\nsynthetic globular cluster environment. Their diffusion and interaction, both,\nwith cluster magnetic field and ambient photon fields, were performed with\nBednarek & Sitarek (2007) model yielding ICS component of cluster emission.

Several common\nradioisotopes in detector construction materials are found in long decay\nchains, notably those headed by 238U, 235U, and 232Th. Gamma radioassay using\nGe detectors identifies decay rates of a few of the radioisotopes in each\nchain, and typically assumes that the chain is in secular equilibrium. If the\nchains are out of equilibrium, detector background rates can be elevated\nsignificantly above expectation. In this work we quantify the increase in\nneutron and gamma production rates from an excess of various sub-chains of the\n238U decay chain. We find that the 226Ra sub-chain generates x10 higher neutron\nflux per decay than the 238U early sub-chain and 210Pb sub-chain, in materials\nwith high (alpha,n) neutron yields. Typical gamma screening results limit\npotential 238U early sub-chain activity to x20-60 higher than 226Ra sub-chain\nactivity. Monte Carlo simulation is used to quantify the contribution of the\nsub-chains of 238U to low-energy nuclear recoil (NR) and electron recoil (ER)\nbackgrounds in simplified one tonne liquid Ar and liquid Xe detectors.

Abstract: Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), if exist in nature, are expected to mix with\nphotons in the presence of an external magnetic field. The energy range of\nphotons which undergo strong mixing with ALPs depends on the ALP mass, on its\ncoupling with photons as well as on the external magnetic field and particle\ndensity configurations. Recent observations of blazars by the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope in the 0.1-300 GeV energy range show a break in their spectra\nin the 1-10 GeV range. We have modeled this spectral feature for the\nflat-spectrum radio quasar 3C454.3 during its November 2010 outburst, assuming\nthat a significant fraction of the gamma rays convert to ALPs in the large\nscale jet of this blazar. Using theoretically motivated models for the magnetic\nfield and particle density configurations in the kiloparsec scale jet, outside\nthe broad-line region, we find an ALP mass $m_a\\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-7}$ eV and\ncoupling $g_{a\\gamma} \\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ after performing an\nillustrative statistical analysis of spectral data in four different epochs of\nemission.

This leads to an\nunexpected richness of possible theoretical models able to describe such\nphenomenology. Hints of emission at tens of GeV are indeed known since the\nEGRET observations during the '90s and confirmed in the Fermi-LAT data.\nHowever, our comprehension of these phenomena is still far to be satisfactory.\nIn this respect, the VHE characterization of GRBs may constitute a breakthrough\nfor understanding their physics and, possibly, for providing decisive clues for\nthe discrimination among different proposed emission mechanisms, which are\nbarely distinguishable at lower energies. The current generation of Cherenkov\nobservatories, such as the MAGIC telescopes, have opened the possibility to\nextend the measurement of GRB emission, and in general to any short time-scale\ntransient phenomena, fromfew tens of GeV up to the TeV energy range, with a\nhigher sensitivity with respect to gamma-ray space-based instruments. In the\nnear future, a crucial role for the VHE observations of GRBs will be played by\nthe Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), thanks to its about one order of magnitude\nbetter sensitivity and lower energy threshold with respect to current\ninstruments. In this contribution, we present a method aimed at providing VHE\ndetection prospects for observations of GRB-like transient events with\nCherenkov telescopes. In particular, we consider the observation of the\ntransient event GRB 090102 as a test case for the method and show the achieved\ndetection prospects under different observational conditions for the MAGIC\ntelescopes and CTA. \n\n"}

The readout of the front-end modules into a\ncamera server is Ethernet-based using standard Ethernet switches.

The radio object was detected both in our new VLA\nimage from observations in 2012 at 5.5 GHz and in archival VLA images from\nobservations in 1987 at 4.75 GHz and in the period from 1990 to 2002 at 8.31\nGHz. The radio morphology of this object is characterized as a compact,\npartially resolved point source located at the northern tip of a radio \"tongue\"\nsimilar to the X-ray structure observed by Chandra. Behind the Cannonball, a\nradio counterpart to the X-ray plume is observed. This object consists of a\nbroad radio plume with a size of 30\\arcsec$\\times$15\\arcsec, followed by a\nlinear tail having a length of 30\\arcsec. The compact head and broad plume\nsources appear to have relatively flat spectra ($\\propto\\nu^\\alpha$) with mean\nvalues of $\\alpha=-0.44\\pm0.08$ and $-0.10\\pm0.02$, respectively; and the\nlinear tail shows a steep spectrum with the mean value of $-1.94\\pm0.05$.

Some core-collapse supernovae that are\ndetected during the first days after the explosion prominently show two peaks\nin the optical bands, including the $R$ and $I$ bands, where the first peak\nappears to be powered by the cooling of shocked surface material and the second\npeak is clearly powered by radioactive decay. Such light curves have been\nexplored in detail theoretically for SN 1993J and 2011dh, where it was found\nthat they may be explained by progenitors with extended, low-mass envelopes.\nHere we generalize these results. We explore, first, whether any double-peaked\nlight curve of this type can be generated by a progenitor with a \"standard\"\ndensity profile, such as a red supergiant or a Wolf-Rayet star. We show that a\nstandard progenitor (1) cannot produce a double-peaked light curve in the $R$\nand $I$ bands, and (2) cannot exhibit a fast drop in the bolometric luminosity\nas is seen after the first peak. We then explore the signature of a progenitor\nwith a compact core surrounded by extended, low-mass material.

We use this result\nto provide simple formulae to estimate (1) the mass of the extended material\nfrom the time of the first peak, (2) the extended material radius from the\nluminosity of the first peak, and (3) an upper limit on the core radius from\nthe luminosity minimum between the two peaks. \n\n"}

Assuming\nthat these emissions are caused by magnetic cycles similar to the sunspot\ncycle, we construct flux transport dynamo models of $1M_{\\odot}$ stars rotating\nwith different rotation periods. We first compute the differential rotation and\nthe meridional circulation inside these stars from a mean-field hydrodynamics\nmodel. Then these are substituted in our dynamo code to produce periodic\nsolutions. We find that the dimensionless amplitude $f_m$ of the toroidal flux\nthrough the star increases with decreasing rotation period. The observational\ndata can be matched if we assume the emissions to go as the power 3-4 of $f_m$.\nAssuming that the Babcock-Leighton mechanism saturates with increasing\nrotation, we can provide an explanation for the observed saturation of emission\nat low Rossby numbers. The main failure of our model is that it predicts an\nincrease of magnetic cycle period with increasing rotation rate, which is the\nopposite of what is found observationally. Much of our calculations are based\non the assumption that the magnetic buoyancy makes the magnetic flux tubes to\nrise radially from the bottom of the convection zone.

Continuous energy injection via successive supernovae\ngoing off within the hot/dilute bubble maintains a strong termination shock.\nThis strong shock keeps the superbubble over-pressured and drives the outer\nshock well after it becomes radiative. Isolated supernovae, in contrast, with\nno further energy injection, become radiative quite early ($\\lesssim 0.1$ Myr,\n10s of pc), and stall at scales $\\lesssim 100$ pc. We show that isolated\nsupernovae lose almost all of their mechanical energy by a Myr, but\nsuperbubbles can retain up to $\\sim 40\\%$ of the input energy in form of\nmechanical energy over the lifetime of the star cluster (few 10s of Myr).

Here, we show that for\nthe most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix $C$ can be\nhierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank updates of the\nidentity matrix, yielding an $\\mathcal O (n\\log^2 n) $ algorithm for inversion.\nMore importantly, we show that this factorization enables the evaluation of the\ndeterminant $\\det(C)$, permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in\nhigh dimensions under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining $K$. Our\nfast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation of\nhyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The combination\nof nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with high-performance\ncomputing resources will permit the modeling of previously intractable\nproblems.

It is\nalso known for hosting a bright galaxy, NGC 1400, with a large radial velocity\n(1200 km s$^{-1}$) with respect to the group center. Previous ROSAT X-ray\nobservations revealed an extended region of enhanced surface brightness just\neastward of NGC 1400. We investigate the NGC 1407/1400 complex with XMM-Newton\nand Chandra observations. We find that the temperature and metallicity of the\nenhanced region are different (cooler and more metal rich) than those of the\nsurrounding group gas, but consistent with those of the ISM in NGC 1400. The\nrelative velocity of NGC 1400 is large enough that much of its ISM could have\nbeen ram pressure stripped while plunging through the group atmosphere. We\nconclude that the enhanced region is likely to be hot gas stripped from the ISM\nof NGC 1400. We constrain the motion of NGC 1400 using the the pressure jump at\nits associated stagnation front and the total mass profile of the NGC 1407\ngroup. We conclude that NGC 1400 is moving within ~$30^{\\circ}$ of the\nline-of-sight with Mach number $\\mathcal{M}\\lesssim3$. We do not detect any\nobvious shock features in this complex, perhaps due to the highly line-of-sight\nmotion of NGC 1400.

When a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle WIMP\nfrom the Galactic Halo elastically scatters off of a nucleus in the detector,\nthe small amount of energy deposited can trigger an explosion. For specificity,\nthis paper focuses on a type of two-component explosive known as a\nnanothermite, consisting of a metal and an oxide in close proximity. When the\ntwo components interact they undergo a rapid exothermic reaction --- an\nexplosion. As a specific example, we consider metal nanoparticles of 5 nm\nradius embedded in an oxide. One cell contains more than a few million\nnanoparticles, and a large number of cells adds up to a total of 1 kg detector\nmass. A WIMP interacts with a metal nucleus of the nanoparticles, depositing\nenough energy to initiate a reaction at the interface between the two layers.\nWhen one nanoparticle explodes it initiates a chain reaction throughout the\ncell. A number of possible thermite materials are studied. Excellent background\nrejection can be achieved because of the nanoscale granularity of the detector:\nwhereas a WIMP will cause a single cell to explode, backgrounds will instead\nset off multiple cells.\n  If the detector operates at room temperature, we find that WIMPs with masses\nabove 100 GeV (or for some materials above 1 TeV) could be detected; they\ndeposit enough energy ($>$10 keV) to cause an explosion. When operating\ncryogenically at liquid nitrogen or liquid helium temperatures, the nano\nexplosive WIMP detector can detect energy deposits as low as 0.5 keV, making\nthe nano explosive detector more sensitive to very light $<$10 GeV WIMPs,\nbetter than other dark matter detectors. \n\n"}

It is found that there is a critical value of the\nspecific angular momentum, above which the standing shock wave revives, for a\ngiven combination of mass accretion rate and neutrino luminosity, i.e. an\nexplosion can occur by rotation even if the neutrino luminosity is lower than\nthe critical value for a given mass accretion rate in non-rotational models.\nThe coupling of rotation and hydrodynamical instabilities plays an important\nrole to characterize the dynamics of shock revival for the range of specific\nangular momentum that are supposed to be realistic.

Here we present a wide survey of the\ncorrections due to these effects in two situations of great interest for GW\nastronomy: the black hole (BH) ringdown emission and the inspiral of two\ncompact objects. We take into account various effects such as: electric\ncharges, magnetic fields, cosmological evolution, possible deviations from\nGeneral Relativity, firewalls, and various forms of matter such as accretion\ndisks and dark matter halos. Our analysis predicts the existence of resonances\ndictated by the external mass distribution, which dominate the very late-time\nbehavior of merger/ringdown waveforms. The mode structure can drastically\ndiffer from the vacuum case, yet the BH response to external perturbations is\nunchanged at the time scales relevant for detectors. This is because although\nthe vacuum Schwarzschild resonances are no longer quasinormal modes of the\nsystem, they still dominate the response at intermediate times.

The high stellar density at the location of\nSgr A* produces a background of ~250 mJy at 4.5 microns in each pixel with a\nlarge pixel-to-pixel gradient, but the light curve for the highly variable Sgr\nA* source was successfully measured by modeling and removing the variations due\nto pointing wobble.

Since the claimed emission lines lie around 3.5 keV, we focus on\ngalaxies and galaxy groups (masking the central regions), since these objects\nemit very little radiation above $\\sim 2$ keV and offer a clean background\nagainst which to detect emission lines.

In total, we examine\n81 and 89 galaxies with Chandra and XMM-Newton respectively, totaling 15.0 and\n14.6 Ms of integration time.

The instrumental dead time per\nevent is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percent\nevent-to-event. The most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noise\nlevel in the power density spectrum (PDS) that cannot be modeled easily with\nthe standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time.

I: Stellar mass at z<1 Abstract: LGRBs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to star\nformation. The conditions necessary to produce LGRBs can affect the relation\nbetween the LGRB rate and star formation. By using the power of a complete LGRB\nsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,\nwhat is its origin. In this first paper, we build the SED of the z<1 host\ngalaxies of the BAT6 LGRB sample, and determine their stellar masses from SED\nfitting. We compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) with\nstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (UltraVISTA); (ii) with\nsemi-analitical models of the z<1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) with\nnumerical simulations of LGRB hosts having different metallicity thresholds for\nthe progenitor star environment. We find that at z<1 LGRBs tend to avoid\nmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forming\ngalaxies. The stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent with\nthat of the UltraVISTA star-forming galaxies weighted for their SFR. This\nimplies that, at least at z<1, LGRBs are not unbiased tracers of star\nformation. To make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-end\nof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow SFR-Mass relation for\nthe low mass galaxy population. GRB host galaxy simulations indicates that, to\nreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the order\nof Z_th=0.3-0.5Z_sun is necessary. Models without a metallicity threshold or\nwith an extreme threshold of Z_th = 0.1Z_sun are excluded at z<1. The use of\nthe BAT6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biases\nwhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. The\npreference for low metallicities (Z<~0.5Z_sun) can be a consequence of the\nparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a GRB.\n(Abridged) \n\n"}

A sequence of optical spectra obtained with the\n9.2-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) between +8 and +45 days after discovery\nrevealed a hot, blue continuum with no visible spectral features.

In the regions of the wind where\nneutrino irradiation raises the electron fraction to Ye > 0.25, r-process\nnucleosynthesis halts before producing high-opacity, complex ions (the\nlanthanides). The kilonova light curves thus show two distinct components: a\nbrief (~2 day) blue optical transient produced in the outer lanthanide-free\nejecta, and a longer (~10 day) infrared transient produced in the inner,\nlanthanide line-blanketed region. Mergers producing a longer-lived neutron\nstar, or a more rapidly spinning black hole, have stronger neutrino\nirradiation, generate more lanthanide-free ejecta, and are optically brighter\nand bluer. At least some optical emission is produced in all disk wind models,\nwhich should enhance the detectability of electromagnetic counterparts to\ngravitational wave sources. However, the presence of even a small amount\n(10^{-4} Msun) of overlying, neutron-rich dynamical ejecta will act as a\n\"lanthanide-curtain\", obscuring the optical wind emission from certain viewing\nangles. Because the disk outflows have moderate velocities (~10,000 km/s),\nnumerous resolved line features are discernible in the spectra, distinguishing\ndisk winds from fast-moving dynamical ejecta, and offering a potential\ndiagnostic of the detailed composition of freshly produced r-process material. \n\n"}

The one-zone SSC model can describe\nreasonably well the SED of each day for the 13 consecutive days. This flaring\nactivity is also very well described by a two-zone SSC model, where one zone is\nresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which is\nspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variable\nemission occurring in X-rays and VHE gamma-rays.\n  Both the one-zone SSC and the two-zone SSC models can describe the daily SEDs\nvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesis\nthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particle\npopulation. This shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanism\nproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for the\nbroadband SED variations during the flaring episodes in blazars.

On the ground of our interpretation of the results emerging\nfrom the literature, we suggest that in models describing DNe outbursts, such\nas the disk instability model, the secondary instability model (Bath 1973) and\nthe thermonuclear runaway model (Mitrofanov 1978), the role of the magnetic\nfield is at least twofold.

The energy release and particle acceleration during\nreconnection have been proposed as a mechanism for producing high-energy\nemissions and cosmic rays. We carry out two- and three-dimensional kinetic\nsimulations to investigate relativistic magnetic reconnection and the\nassociated particle acceleration. The simulations focus on electron-positron\nplasmas starting with a magnetically dominated, force-free current sheet\n($\\sigma \\equiv B^2/(4\\pi n_e m_e c^2) \\gg 1$). For this limit, we demonstrate\nthat relativistic reconnection is highly efficient at accelerating particles\nthrough a first-order Fermi process accomplished by the curvature drift of\nparticles along the electric field induced by the relativistic flows. This\nmechanism gives rise to the formation of hard power-law spectra $f \\propto\n(\\gamma-1)^{-p}$ and approaches $p = 1$ for sufficiently large $\\sigma$ and\nsystem size. Eventually most of the available magnetic free energy is converted\ninto nonthermal particle kinetic energy. An analytic model is presented to\nexplain the key results and predict a general condition for the formation of\npower-law distributions. The development of reconnection in these regimes leads\nto relativistic inflow and outflow speeds and enhanced reconnection rates\nrelative to non-relativistic regimes. In the three-dimensional simulation, the\ninterplay between secondary kink and tearing instabilities leads to strong\nmagnetic turbulence, but does not significantly change the energy conversion,\nreconnection rate, or particle acceleration.

By adjusting the maximum time offset between a pair of\ndata segments to be coherently combined, one can tune the method to trade off\nsensitivity and computing costs. In particular, the detectable signal amplitude\nscales as the inverse fourth root of this coherence time. The improvement in\namplitude sensitivity for a search with a coherence time of 1hr, compared with\na directed stochastic background search with 0.25Hz wide bins is about a factor\nof 5.4. We show that a search of 1yr of data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced\nVirgo with a coherence time of 1hr would be able to detect GWs from Sco X-1 at\nthe level predicted by torque balance over a range of signal frequencies from\n30-300Hz; if the coherence time could be increased to 10hr, the range would be\n20-500Hz.

As changes in the pulse shape are often correlated with timing\nirregularities, precession is a possible cause of these phenomena. Whereas\npulsar magnetospheres are filled with plasma, most pulsar precession studies\nwere carried out within the vacuum approximation and neglected the effects of\nmagnetospheric currents and charges.

Our\nmodel identifies a \"feeding-dominated\" accretion regime and a\n\"feedback-limited\" one, the latter being characterized by intermittent (duty\ncycles ${\\cal D} \\lesssim 0.5$) and inefficient growth, with recurring outflow\nepisodes.

The\nnorthern part of the front appears the sharpest, with a width smaller than 2.5\nkpc (1.5 Coulomb mean free paths; at 99 per cent confidence). Everywhere along\nthe front, the temperature discontinuity is narrower than 4-8 kpc and the\nmetallicity gradient is narrower than 6 kpc, indicating that diffusion,\nconduction and mixing are suppressed across the interface. Such transport\nprocesses can be naturally suppressed by magnetic fields aligned with the cold\nfront. Interestingly, comparison to magnetohydrodynamic simulations indicates\nthat in order to maintain the observed sharp density and temperature\ndiscontinuities, conduction must also be suppressed along the magnetic field\nlines. However, the northwestern part of the cold front is observed to have a\nnon-zero width. While other explanations are possible, the broadening is\nconsistent with the presence of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) on\nlength-scales of a few kpc.

This component, often associated with the GRB\njet's photosphere, is usually subdominant compared to a much stronger\nnon-thermal one. The prompt emission of Fermi GRB 131014A provides a unique\nopportunity to study this thermal-like component. Indeed, the thermal emission\nin GRB 131014A is much more intense than in other GRBs and a pure thermal\nepisode is observed during the initial 0.16 s. The thermal-like component cools\nmonotonically during the first second while the non-thermal emission kicks off.\nThe intensity of the non-thermal component progressively increases until being\nenergetically dominant at late time. This is a perfect scenario to disentangle\nthe thermal component from the non-thermal one. A low-energy spectral index of\n+0.6 better fit the thermal component than the typical index value +1\ncorresponding to a pure Planck function. The non-thermal component is\nadequately fitted with a Band function whose low and high energy power law\nindices are ~-0.7 and <~-3, respectively; this is also statistically equivalent\nto a cutoff power law with a ~-0.7 index. This is in agreement with our\nprevious results. Finally, a strong correlation is observed between the\ntime-resolved luminosity of the non-thermal component, L$_i^{nTh}$, and its\ncorresponding rest frame spectral peak energy, E$_{peak,i}^{rest,nTh}$, with a\nslope similar to the one reported in our previous articles. Assuming this\nrelation to be universal for all GRBs we estimate a redshift of ~1.55 for GRB\n131014A that is a typical value for long GRBs. These observational results are\nconsistent with the models in which the non-thermal emission is produced well\nabove the GRB jet photosphere but they may also be compatible with other\nscenarios (e.g., dissipative photosphere) that are not discussed in this\narticle. \n\n"}

Originally consisting of just four\nidentical IACTs (CT1-4) with an effective mirror diameter of 12$\\,$m each, it\nwas expanded with a fifth IACT (CT5) with a mirror diameter of 28$\\,$m in 2012.\nBeing the largest IACT worldwide, CT5 allows to lower the energy threshold of\nH.E.S.S., making the array sensitive at energies where space-based detectors\nrun out of statistics. Events can be analysed either monoscopically (i.e. using\nonly information of CT5) or stereoscopically (requiring at least two triggered\ntelescopes per event). To achieve a good performance, a sophisticated event\nreconstruction and analysis framework is indispensable. This is particularly\nimportant for H.E.S.S. since it is now the first IACT array that consists of\ndifferent telescope types. An advanced reconstruction method is based on a\nsemi-analytical model of electromagnetic particle showers in the atmosphere\n(model analysis). The properties of the primary particle are reconstructed by\ncomparing the image recorded by each triggered telescope with the Cherenkov\nemission from the shower model using a log-likelihood maximisation. Due to its\nperformance, this method has become one of the standard analysis techniques\napplied to CT1-4 data. Now it has been modified for use with the five-telescope\narray. We present the adapted model analysis and its performance in both\nmonoscopic and stereoscopic analysis mode. \n\n"}

The active galaxy is a member of a small sample\nof radio-loud NLS1s detected in $\\gamma$-rays by the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope.

We present results from our X-ray monitoring program comprised of Swift\nsnapshot observations from 2012 through 2014 and two new X-ray observations\nwith XMM-Newton in 2012. We analyze the X-ray spectrum and variability of this\npeculiar source using supplementary archival data from 2004 and 2011. The\n(0.5-10) keV spectrum is well described by a flat power law, which can be\ninterpreted as non-thermal emission from a relativistic jet. The source\nexhibits moderate flux variability on timescales of both months and years.\nCorrelated brightness variations in the (0.5-2) keV and (2-10) keV bands are\nexplained by a single variable spectral component, such as the jet. A possible\nsoft excess seen in the data from 2004 cannot be confirmed by the new \\xmm{}\nobservations in 2012. Any contribution to the total flux in 2004 is less than\n$20\\%$ of the power-law component.

On larger\nscales, the outer accretion disk and molecular torus act as the reservoirs of\ngas for the continuing AGN activity. And on all scales from the black hole\noutwards, powerful winds are seen that probably affect the evolution of the\nhost galaxy as well as regulate the feeding of the AGN itself. In this review\narticle, we discuss how X-ray spectroscopy can be used to study each of these\ncomponents. We highlight how recent measurements of the high-energy cutoff in\nthe X-ray continuum by NuSTAR are pushing us to conclude that X-ray coronae are\nradiatively-compact and have electron temperatures regulated by\nelectron-positron pair production.

The QPO is detected at 0.08 Hz in the IR as well as two optical bands\n(U and V). Interestingly, these QPOs are at half the X-ray QPO frequency at\n0.16 Hz, which is classified as the type-C QPO; a weak sub-harmonic close to\nthe IR and optical QPO frequency is also detected in X-rays.

In our previous paper, Graham & Fruchter (2013), we compared the\nmetallicity distribution of LGRB host galaxies to the that of star forming\ngalaxies in the local universe.

We map out the\npotential signals and current constraints on such a framework in indirect\nsearches, using a model-independent setup based on multi-step hierarchical\ncascade decays. While remaining agnostic to the details of the hidden sector\nmodel, our framework captures the generic broadening of the spectrum of\nsecondary particles (photons, neutrinos, e+e- and antiprotons) relative to the\ncase of direct annihilation to Standard Model particles. We explore how\nindirect constraints on dark matter annihilation limit the parameter space for\nsuch cascade/multi-particle decays.

Through the merger and\nringdown, however, a different set of degeneracies apply. This suggests the\npossibility that, if the inspiral, merger and ringdown are all within the\nsensitive frequency band of a detector, we may be able to break these\ndegeneracies and more accurately measure both spins. In this work we\ninvestigate our ability to measure individual spins for non-precessing\nbinaries, for a range of configurations and signal strengths, and conclude that\nin general the spin of the larger black hole will be measurable (at best) with\nobservations from Advanced LIGO and Virgo.

The measurements used to validate\nthe model and characterize its uncertainty are derived primarily from a\ndedicated photon radiation pressure actuator, with cross-checks provided by\noptical and radio frequency references. We describe how the gravitational-wave\nreadout signal is calibrated into equivalent gravitational-wave-induced strain\nand how the statistical uncertainties and systematic errors are assessed.\nDetector data collected over 38 calendar days, from September 12 to October 20,\n2015, contain the event GW150914 and approximately 16 of coincident data used\nto estimate the event false alarm probability.

At VHE, it was first\ndetected by VERITAS and later confirmed by MAGIC. Its spectral energy\ndistribution is highly attenuated at VHE gamma rays, which is coherent with\ndistant sources. Several estimations enabled the redshift to be constrained to\nthe range 0.6 < z < 1.3.

Elliptical galaxies are associated with groups, and BL-Lac\nobjects are typically hosted by them, so we decided to search for the host\ngroup of the blazar. For this, we performed optical spectroscopic observations\nof thirty objects in the field of view of PKS 1424+240 using the Gemini MOS.\nAfter analysing the data for groups, we evaluated the probability of finding\ngroups of galaxies by chance around the position of PKS 1424+240, using a deep\ncatalogue of groups.

Here we explore how acceleration is affected by a time-varying\nflux, as AGN are known to be highly variable. If the period of flux\noscillations is longer than the thermal timescale, we expect the gas to cool\nduring the low flux state, and therefore line opacity should quickly increase.\nThe cloud will receive a small kick due to the increased radiation force.

We calculate the chemical separation on\nfreezing for a number of different nuclear mixtures resulting from a range of\nburning conditions for the rp-process. We confirm the generic result that light\nnuclei are preferentially retained in the liquid and heavy nuclei in the solid.\nThis is in agreement with the previous study of a 17-component mixture of\nrp-process ashes by Horowitz et al. (2007), but extends that result to a much\nlarger range of compositions. We also find an alternate phase separation regime\nfor the lightest ash mixtures which does not demonstrate this generic\nbehaviour. With a few exceptions, we find that chemical separation reduces the\nexpected $Q_{\\rm imp}$ in the outer crust compared to the initial rp-process\nash, where $Q_{\\rm imp}$ measures the mean-square dispersion in atomic number\n$Z$ of the nuclei in the mixture. We find that the fractional spread of $Z$\nplays a role in setting the amount of chemical separation and is strongly\ncorrelated to the divergence between the two/three-component approximations and\nthe full component model. The contrast in $Y_e$ between the initial rp-process\nashes and the equilibrium liquid composition is similar to that assumed in\nearlier two-component models of compositionally driven convection, except for\nvery light compositions which produce nearly negligible convective driving.

This allows to estimate the white dwarf masses as\nthe white dwarf mass-radius relation M-R and the expected free-fall velocities\nat the surface are well known. This method is widely used, however, derived\nwhite dwarf masses M can be systematically underestimated because the accretion\nflow is stopped at and re-accelerates from the magnetospheric boundary R_m, and\ntherefore, its velocity at the surface will be lower than free-fall.To avoid\nthis problem we computed a two-parameter set of model hard X-ray spectra, which\nallows to constrain a degenerate M - R_m dependence. On the other hand,\nprevious works showed that power spectra of accreting X-ray pulsars and\nintermediate polars exhibit breaks at the frequencies corresponding to the\nKeplerian frequencies at the magnetospheric boundary. Therefore, the break\nfrequency \\nu_b in an intermediate polar power spectrum gives another relation\nin the M - R_m plane. The intersection of the two dependences allows,\ntherefore, to determine simultaneously the white dwarf mass and the\nmagnetospheric radius. To verify the method we analyzed the archival Suzaku\nobservation of EX Hya obtaining M /M_sun= 0.73 \\pm 0.06 and R_ m / R = 2.6 \\pm\n0.4 consistent with the values determined by other authors.

In one of the leading formation\nscenarios, a black hole of $\\sim100$ M$_{\\odot}$ results from the collapse of\nthe inner core of a supermassive star ($\\gtrsim 10^{4-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$), created\nby the rapid accumulation ($\\gtrsim 0.1 $ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) of pristine\ngas at the centre of newly formed galaxies at $z\\sim 15$. The subsequent\nevolution is still speculative: the remaining gas in the supermassive star can\neither directly plunge into the nascent black hole, or part of it can form a\ncentral accretion disc, whose luminosity sustains a surrounding, massive, and\nnearly hydrostatic envelope (a system called a \"quasi-star\"). To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon.

The eccentricity of a BHB carries precious information\nabout its formation channel: BHBs formed in the field, in globular clusters, or\nclose to a massive black hole (MBH) have distinct eccentricity distributions in\nthe eLISA band. We generate mock eLISA observations, folding in measurement\nerrors, and using Bayesian model selection we study whether eLISA measurements\ncan identify the BHB formation channel.

The data\nindicate that this ratio, after a decline between $0.5-8$ GeV, rises steadily\nwith a trend towards saturation at 200-400GeV. These observations (except for\nthe trend) appear to be in conflict with the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA)\nmechanism, operating in a \\emph{single} supernova remnant (SNR) shock. We argue\nthat $e^{+}/e^{-}$ ratio can still be explained by the DSA if positrons are\naccelerated in a \\emph{subset} of SNR shocks which: (i) propagate in clumpy gas\nmedia, and (ii) are modified by accelerated CR \\emph{protons}. The protons\npenetrate into the dense gas clumps upstream to produce positrons and,\n\\emph{charge the clumps positively}. The induced electric field expels\npositrons into the upstream plasma where they are shock-accelerated. Since the\nshock is modified, these positrons develop a harder spectrum than that of the\nCR electrons accelerated in other SNRs. Mixing these populations explains the\nincrease in the $e^{+}/e^{-}$ ratio at $E>8$ GeV. It decreases at $E<8$ GeV\nbecause of a subshock weakening which also results from the shock modification.\nContrary to the expelled positrons, most of the antiprotons, electrons, and\nheavier nuclei, are left unaccelerated inside the clumps.

{"id": "1609.04172", "contents": "Title: Gaia Data Release 1. Summary of the astrometric, photometric, and survey\n  properties Abstract: At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data\nrelease, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion\nsources brighter than magnitude 20.7. We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide\nillustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion\nof the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1\nconsists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,\nparallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars\nin common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric\ndata set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The\nsecond component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band\nmagnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the\ntypical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas. The median uncertainties on\nthe mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to ~0.03 mag over the\nmagnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping\nof the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin\nobservational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this\nfirst Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the\ndata quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions\nfrom the data. \n\n"}

The Cepheid distances are estimated\nfrom a recent calibration of the near-infrared Period-Luminosity P-L relation.\nThe comparison is carried out in parallax space, where the DR1 parallax errors,\nwith a median value of half the median parallax, are expected to be\nwell-behaved. With the exception of one outlier, the DR1 parallaxes are in\nremarkably good global agreement with the predictions, and the published errors\nmay be conservatively overestimated by about 20%. The parallaxes of 9 Cepheids\nbrighter than G = 6 may be systematically underestimated, trigonometric\nparallaxes measured with the HST FGS for three of these objects confirm this\ntrend. If interpreted as an independent calibration of the Cepheid luminosities\nand assumed to be otherwise free of systematic uncertainties, DR1 parallaxes\nwould imply a decrease of 0.3% in the current estimate of the local Hubble\nconstant, well within their statistical uncertainty, and corresponding to a\nvalue 2.5 sigma (3.5 sigma if the errors are scaled) higher than the value\ninferred from Planck CMB data used in conjunction with Lambda-CDM.

The early results from DR1 demonstrate again the\nenormous impact that the full mission will likely have on fundamental questions\nin astrophysics and cosmology. \n\n"}

Here we suggest that the carousels\nof these pulsars, and hence their beams, are not circular but elliptical with\naxes tilted with respect to the fiducial plane. We show that certain relatively\nunusual lines of sight can cause bi-drifting to be observed, and a simulation\nof the two known exemplars is presented. Although bi-drifting is rare,\nnon-circular beams may be common among pulsars and reveal themselves by having\nprofile centroids displaced from the fiducial plane identified by polarisation\nposition angle swings. They may also result in profiles with asymmetric and\nfrequency-dependent component evolution. It is further suggested that the\ncarousels may change their tilt by specific amounts and later reverse them.\nThis may occur suddenly, accompanying a mode change (e.g. PSR B0943+10), or\nmore gradually and short-lived as in \"flare\" pulsars (e.g. PSR B1859+07).

The magnetic pressure elevates most of the gas carrying the accretion\nflow at $R$ to large heights $z > 0.1 R$ and low densities, while leaving a\nthin dense layer containing most of the mass --- but contributing very little\naccretion --- around the equator. We show that such a disk model leads\nnaturally to the formation of a broad emission line region through thermal\ninstability. Extrapolating to larger radii, we demonstrate that local\ngravitational instability and associated star formation are strongly suppressed\ncompared to standard disk models for AGN, although star formation in the\nequatorial zone is predicted for sufficiently high mass supply rates. This new\nclass of accretion disk models thus appears capable of resolving two\nlongstanding puzzles in the theory of AGN fueling: the formation of broad\nemission line regions and the suppression of fragmentation thought to inhibit\naccretion at the required rates.

It can take several hours\nfor a detector to stabilize enough to return to its nominal state for\nscientific observations. The down time can be reduced if advance warning of\nimpending shaking is received and the impact is suppressed in the isolation\nsystem with the goal of maintaining stable operation even at the expense of\nincreased instrumental noise. Here we describe an early warning system for\nmodern gravitational-wave observatories. The system relies on near real-time\nearthquake alerts provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Hypocenter and\nmagnitude information is generally available in 5 to 20 minutes of a\nsignificant earthquake depending on its magnitude and location. The alerts are\nused to estimate arrival times and ground velocities at the gravitational-wave\ndetectors.

Our initial results\nindicate that by using detector control configuration changes, we could prevent\ninterruption of operation from 40-100 earthquake events in a 6-month\ntime-period. \n\n"}

The lines\npresumably emit from TDE debris or circumnuclear clouds photoionized by the\nflare. Line velocities however are much lower than expected from a stellar\ndisruption by supermassive black hole (SMBH), and are somewhat faster than\nexpected for the broad line region (BLR) clouds of a persistently active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN). The distinctive spectral states are not strongly\nrelated to observed luminosity and velocity, nor to SMBH mass estimates. We use\nexhaustive photoionization modelling to map the domain of fluxes and cloud\nproperties that yield (e.g.) a He-overbright state where a large\nHeII(4686A)/H$\\alpha$ line-ratio creates an illusion of helium enrichment.\nAlthough observed line ratios occur in a plausible minority of cases, AGN-like\nillumination can not reproduce the observed equivalent widths.

Previous deep Chandra observations of low mass X-ray\nbinaries (LMXBs) in early-type galaxies have typically targeted the large\npopulations of massive galaxies. NGC 7457 is a nearby, early-type galaxy with a\nstellar luminosity of $1.7\\times10^{10} L_{K\\odot}$, allowing us to investigate\nthe populations in a relatively low mass galaxy. We classify the detected X-ray\nsources into field LMXBs, globular cluster LMXBs, and background AGN based on\nidentifying optical counterparts in new HST/ACS images. We detect 10 field\nLMXBs within the $r_{ext}$ ellipse of NGC 7457 (with semi-major axis $\\sim$ 9.1\nkpc, ellipticity = 0.55). The corresponding number of LMXBs with\n$L_{x}>2\\times10^{37}erg/s$ per stellar luminosity is consistent with that\nobserved in more massive galaxies, $\\sim 7$ per $10^{10} L_{K\\odot}$.

However, no X-ray emission is detected from\nany of these clusters.

The efficient\nprocessing of large-scale data sets is of great importance. We propose an\nacceleration strategy for a recently proposed primal-dual distributed\nalgorithm. A preconditioning approach can incorporate into the algorithmic\nstructure both the sampling density of the measured visibilities and the noise\nstatistics. Using the sampling density information greatly accelerates the\nconvergence speed, especially for highly non-uniform sampling patterns, while\nrelying on the correct noise statistics optimises the sensitivity of the\nreconstruction. In connection to CLEAN, our approach can be seen as including\nin the same algorithmic structure both natural and uniform weighting, thereby\nsimultaneously optimising both the resolution and the sensitivity.

At the same\ntime they are bright emitters, which is indicative of strong energy\ndissipation. This points towards a mechanism of internal dissipation which does\nnot result in a global disruption of the flow. One possibility is internal\nshocks and another one is turbulence driven by local instabilities. Such\ninstabilities can be triggered when a freely expanding jet is reconfined by\neither the cocoon or external gas pressure.

In\nparticular, tritium is specially relevant due to its decay properties (very low\nendpoint energy and long half-life) when induced in the detector medium, and\nbecause it can be generated in any material as a spallation product.\nQuantification of cosmogenic production of tritium is not straightforward,\nneither experimentally nor by calculations.

The basic idea is that primary\nparticles are accelerated in astrophysical sources, such as supernova remnant\nshocks and eventually propagate in the Galactic volume, occasionally\ninteracting with gas, mainly in the disc of the Galaxy, and there they produce\nsecondary nuclei through spallation. At sufficiently high energy, typically\n$\\gtrsim 100$ GeV/n, the ratio of fluxes of the secondary nucleus to that of\nthe main primary nucleus is found to scale as $E_{k}^{-\\delta}$, where $E_{k}$\nis the energy per nucleon (a conserved quantity in spallation reactions) and\n$\\delta$ identifies the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient. The\nsame shock waves that may be responsible for cosmic ray acceleration in the\nfirst place also pick up any other charged particle in the upstream, provided\nbeing above threshold for injection.

Here we report on a mock data\nchallenge, performed prior to the first detections of GW signals by Advanced\nLIGO, to compare these two methods. The all-samples method is found to be\nself-consistent in terms of the rate of false positive detection claims, but\nits p-value estimates are systematically conservative and subject to higher\nvariance. Conversely, the coincidence-removal method yields a mean-unbiased\nestimate of the p-value but sacrifices self-consistency.

Neutrino transport is incorporated by an approximate\ntransfer scheme based on the truncated moment formalism.

The hot accretion disk\nformed after tidal disruption of the neutron star emits a copious amount of\nneutrinos with the peak total luminosity ~1--3x10^53 erg s^(-1) via thermal\npair production and subsequent electron/positron captures on free nucleons.\nNevertheless, the neutrino irradiation does not modify significantly the\nelectron fraction of the dynamical ejecta from the neutrinoless\nbeta-equilibrium value at zero temperature of initial neutron stars.

Today the presence of an annual modulation, which matches in period and\nphase the expectation for dark matter, is supported at > 9$\\sigma$ confidence.\nThe underlying nature of dark matter, however, is still considered an open and\nfundamental question of particle physics. No other direct dark matter search\ncould confirm the DAMA claim up to now; moreover, numerous null-results are in\nclear contradiction under so-called standard assumptions for the dark matter\nhalo and the interaction mechanism of dark with ordinary matter. As both bear a\ndependence on the target material, resolving this controversial situation will\nconvincingly only be possible with an experiment using sodium iodide (NaI) as\ntarget. COSINUS aims to even go a step further by combining NaI with a novel\ndetection approach. COSINUS aims to operate NaI as a cryogenic calorimeter\nreading scintillation light and phonon/heat signal. Two distinct advantages\narise from this approach, a substantially lower energy threshold for nuclear\nrecoils and particle identification on an event-by-event basis. These key\nbenefits will allow COSINUS to clarify a possible nuclear recoil origin of the\nDAMA signal with comparatively little exposure of O(100kg days) and, thereby,\nanswer a long-standing question of particle physics. Today COSINUS is in R&D\nphase; in this contribution we show results from the 2nd prototype, albeit the\nfirst one of the final foreseen detector design. The key finding of this\nmeasurement is that pure, undoped NaI is a truly excellent scintillator at low\ntemperatures: We measure 13.1% of the total deposited energy in the NaI crystal\nin the form of scintillation light (in the light detector). \n\n"}

Low signal-to-noise ratio signals need\ntemplated searches with long coherent integration times and thus fine\nparameter-space resolution. Longer integration increases sensitivity. Low-mass\nx-ray binaries (LMXBs) such as Scorpius X-1 (Sco X-1) may emit accretion-driven\nCWs at strains reachable by current ground-based observatories. Binary orbital\nparameters induce phase modulation. This paper describes how resampling\ncorrects binary and detector motion, yielding source-frame time series used for\ncross-correlation. Compared to the previous, detector-frame, templated\ncross-correlation method, used for Sco X-1 on data from the first Advanced LIGO\nobserving run (O1), resampling is about 20x faster in the costliest,\nmost-sensitive frequency bands. Speed-up factors depend on integration time and\nsearch setup. The speed could be reinvested into longer integration with a\nforecast sensitivity gain, 20 to 125 Hz median, of approximately 51%, or from\n20 to 250 Hz, 11%, given the same per-band cost and setup. This paper's timing\nmodel enables future setup optimization.

Using a\nseries of spherically-symmetric simulations, here we investigate the impact of\nthermal conduction on the observed temperature distributions in outer regions\nof three massive clusters, and find that thermal conduction substantially\nmodifies the ICM temperature profile. Within 3 Gyr, the gas temperature at a\nrepresentative radius of $0.3r_{500}$ typically decreases by ~10 - 20% and the\naverage temperature slope between $0.3r_{500}$ and $r_{500}$ drops by ~ 30 -\n40%, indicating that the observed ICM would not stay in a long-term equilibrium\nstate in the presence of thermal conduction.

We report the discovery of three supernovae at the\nspectroscopically-confirmed redshifts of 2.399 (HSC16adga), 1.965 (HSC17auzg),\nand 1.851 (HSC17dbpf), and two supernova candidates with the host-galaxy\nphotometric redshifts of 3.2 (HSC16apuo) and 4.2 (HSC17dsid), respectively. In\nthis paper, we present their photometric properties and the spectroscopic\nproperties of the confirmed high-redshift supernovae are presented in the\naccompanying paper (Curtin et al. 2019). The supernovae with the confirmed\nredshifts of z ~ 2 have the rest ultraviolet peak magnitudes close to -21 mag\nand they are likely superluminous supernovae. The discovery of three supernovae\nat z ~ 2 roughly corresponds to the approximate event rate of ~ 900 +/- 520\nGpc-3 yr-1 with Poisson error, which is consistent with the total superluminous\nsupernova rate estimated by extrapolating the local rate based on the cosmic\nstar-formation history. Adding unconfirmed superluminous supernova candidates\nwould increase the event rate. Our superluminous supernova candidates at the\nredshifts of around 3 and 4 indicate the approximate superluminous supernova\nrates of ~ 400 +/- 400 Gpc-3 yr-1 (z ~ 3) and ~ 500 +/- 500 Gpc-3 yr-1 (z ~ 4)\nwith Poisson errors.

Understanding the properties of these sources is of\ninterest since the majority of NLSy1s are very different from typical blazars.\nHere, we present a multi-frequency analysis of FBQS J1644+2619, one of the most\nrecently discovered gamma-ray emitting NLSy1s. We analyse an ~80 ks XMM-Newton\nobservation obtained in 2017, as well as quasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength\nobservations covering the radio - gamma-ray range. The spectral energy\ndistribution of the source is similar to the other gamma-ray NLSy1s, confirming\nits blazar-like nature. The X-ray spectrum is characterised by a hard photon\nindex (Gamma = 1.66) above 2 keV and a soft excess at lower energies.The hard\nphoton index provides clear evidence that inverse Compton emission from the jet\ndominates the spectrum, while the soft excess can be explained by a\ncontribution from the underlying Seyfert emission.

Magnetar birth may be accompanied by the fall-back of stellar debris,\nlasting for seconds or longer following the explosion. Accretion alters the\nmagnetar evolution by (1) providing an additional source of rotational energy\n(or a potential sink, if the propeller mechanism operates); (2) enhancing the\nspin-down luminosity above the dipole rate by compressing the magnetosphere and\nexpanding the polar cap region of open magnetic field lines; (3) supplying an\nadditional accretion-powered neutrino luminosity that sustains the wind\nbaryon-loading, even after the magnetar's internal neutrino luminosity has\nsubsided. The more complex evolution of the jet power and magnetization of an\naccreting magnetar more readily accounts for the high 56Ni yields GRB SNe and\nirregular time evolution of some GRB light curves (e.g.~bursts with precursors\nfollowed by a long quiescent interval before the main emission episode).\nAdditional baryon-loading from accretion-powered neutrino irradiation of the\nmagnetar polar cap lengthens the timeframe over which the jet magnetization is\nin the requisite range sigma ~< 1e3 for efficient gamma-ray emission, thereby\naccommodating GRBs with ultra-long durations. Though accretion does not\nsignificantly raise the maximum energy budget from the limit of <~ few 1e52\nergs for an isolated magnetar, it greatly expands the range of magnetic field\nstrengths and birth spin periods capable of powering GRB jets, reducing the\ndifferences between the magnetar properties normally invoked to explain GRBs\nversus SLSNe. \n\n"}

If one focuses on the onset of the collective oscillations,\non the other hand, the equations can be linearized and the technique of linear\nanalysis can be employed. Unfortunately, however, it is well known that such an\nanalysis, when applied with discretizations of continuous angular\ndistributions, suffers from the appearance of so-called spurious modes,\nunphysical eigenmodes of the discretized linear equations.

In this paper we investigate how standard flagging affects the\ndetectability of such transients by examining the case of transient detection\nin an observing mode used for Low Frequency Array (LOFAR; \\citep{LOFAR})\nsurveys.

We have studied the orbital and spin evolution of\nbinary BHs in triple systems, where the tertiary companion excites large\neccentricity in the inner binary through Lidov-Kozai oscillations, causing the\nbinary to merge via gravitational radiation. Using the single-orbital-averaged\nand double-orbital-averaged secular dynamics equations of triples, we determine\nthe merger window (the range of companion inclinations that allows the inner\nbinary to merge) and the merger fraction as a function of various system\nparameters. For typical BH binaries, the merger fraction increases rapidly with\nthe perturber eccentricity $e_{\\rm out}$ because of the octupole perturbation,\nreaching $10-20\\%$ at $e_{\\rm out}=0.9$. We derive the analytical expressions\nfor the merger window and merger fraction for systems with negligible octupole\neffect, and apply them to neutron star binary mergers in triples.

TTVs can be readily\nmodeled given knowledge of the interacting planets' orbital configurations and\nplanet-star mass ratios, but such models are highly nonlinear and difficult to\ninvert. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are often used to explore the\nposterior distribution for model parameters, but, due to the high correlations\nbetween parameters, nonlinearity, and potential multi-modality in the\nposterior, many samplers perform very inefficiently. Therefore, we assess the\nperformance of several MCMC samplers that use varying degrees of geometric\ninformation about the target distribution. We generate synthetic datasets from\nmultiple models, including the TTVFaster model and a simple sinusoidal model,\nand test the efficiencies of various MCMC samplers. We find that sampling\nefficiency can be greatly improved for all models by sampling from a parameter\nspace transformed using an estimate of the covariance and means of the target\ndistribution. No one sampler performs the best for all datasets, but several\nsamplers, such as Differential Evolution Monte Carlo and Geometric adaptive\nMonte Carlo, have consistently efficient performance. For datasets with near\nGaussian posteriors, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers with 2 or 3 leapfrog\nsteps obtained the highest efficiencies. Based on differences in effective\nsample sizes per time, we show that the right choice of sampler can improve\nsampling efficiencies by several orders of magnitude. \n\n"}

Using data from the GMRT we show\nthat post-correlation beamformation results in a many-folds increase in the\nsignal-to-noise for periodic signals from pulsars and several order of\nmagnitude reduction in the number of false triggers from single pulse events\nlike fast radio bursts (FRBs). This difference arises primarily because the\npost-correlation beam contains less red-noise, as well as less radio frequency\ninterference. The post-correlation beam can also be more easily calibrated than\nthe incoherent or phased array beams. We also discuss two different modes of\npost-correlation beamformation, viz.

ELROI uses short, omnidirectional flashes of laser light\nto encode a unique ID number which can be read by a small ground telescope\nusing a photon-counting sensor and innovative extreme background-rejection\ntechniques. ELROI is smaller and lighter than a typical radio beacon, low-power\nenough to run on its own small solar cell, and can safely operate for the\nentire orbital lifetime of a satellite or debris object. The concept has been\nvalidated in ground tests, and orbital prototypes are scheduled for launch in\n2018 and beyond. In this paper we focus on the details of the encoding scheme\nand data analysis that allow a milliwatt optical signal to be read from orbit.\nWe describe the techniques of extreme background-rejection needed to achieve\nthis, including spectral filtering and temporal filtering using a period- and\nphase-recovery algorithm, and discuss the requirements for an error-correcting\ncode to encode the ID number.

In high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) mainly winds are accreted.\nThis nearly inviscid and dominant sub-Keplerian flow falls almost freely\ntowards the black hole. A standard Keplerian disc can form out of this\nsub-Keplerian matter in presence of a significant viscosity and could be small\nin size. However, in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), highly viscous and larger\nKeplerian accretion disc is expected to form inside the sub-Keplerian disc due\nto the Roche-lobe overflow. Due to two viscous timescales in these two\ncomponents, it is expected to have a larger lag between the times-of-arrival of\nthese components in LMXBs than that in HMXBs. Direct cross-correlation between\nthe photon fluxes will not reveal this lag/delay since they lack linear\ndependence; however, they are coupled through the viscous processes which bring\nin both matter.

We present here the first\nmodeling of the multi-band spectral energy distribution (SED) of this inner\nregion to better constrain the physical condition of the innermost accretion\nflow. Our modeling uses the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to fit the\nSED, accounting for the limitations on the accretion rate at the outer radius\nof $10^3~r_g$ from the earlier works and the domination of the accretion flow\nwithin $30~r_g$ to the sub-mm bump.

Unfortunately, the accuracy of the pulsar timing is\nseriously affected by the spin-down irregularities, such as spin fluctuations\nwith a manifestation of low frequency structures (the so-called red noise\nprocesses), and various activities of magnetospheres. Except from the random\ntiming noise, significant periodic or quasi-periodic components could also be\nfound in some timing residuals of pulsars, indicating the presence of\nunmodelled deterministic effects.

In this paper, we suggest a new mechanism involving the de\nHaas-van Alphen magnetic oscillation, which could trigger the observed low\nfrequency structures.

The favored mechanism at their origin is a\nsustained power injection from a magnetar. This study presents non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent radiative transfer simulations of\nvarious single carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet star explosions influenced by magnetars\nof diverse properties and covering from a few days to one or two years after\nexplosion. Nonthermal processes are treated; the magnetar-power deposition\nprofile is prescribed; dynamical effects are ignored. In this context, the main\ninfluence of the magnetar power is to boost the internal energy of the ejecta\non week-long time scales, enhancing the ejecta temperature and ionization,\nshifting the spectral energy distribution to the near-UV (even for the adopted\nsolar metallicity), creating blue optical colors. Varying the ejecta and\nmagnetar properties introduces various stretches and shifts to the light curve\n(rise time, peak or nebular luminosity, light curve width). At maximum, all\nmodels show the presence of OII and CII lines in the optical, and more rarely\nOIII and CIII lines. Non-thermal effects are found to be negligible during the\nhigh-brightness phase. After maximum, higher energy explosions are hotter and\nmore ionized, and produce spectra that are optically bluer. Clumping is a\nsource of spectral diversity after maximum. Clumping is essential to trigger\nejecta recombination and yield the presence of OI, CaII, and FeII lines from a\nfew weeks after maximum until nebular times. The UV and optical spectrum of\nGaia16apd at maximum or the nebular spectrum of LSQ14an at +410d are compatible\nwith some models that assume no clumping. However, most observed SLSNe Ic seem\nto require clumping from early post-maximum to nebular times (e.g., SN2007bi at\n+46 and +367d; Gaia16apd at +43d). \n\n"}

Thus, all low-frequency ion\nheating in such plasmas is due to compressive fluctuations (\"slow modes\").\nBecause these fluctuations energetically decouple from the Alfv\\'enic ones\nalready in the inertial range, the above conclusion means that the energy\npartition between ions and electrons in low-beta plasmas is decided at the\nouter scale, where turbulence is launched, and can be determined from\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the relevant astrophysical systems. Any\nadditional ion heating must come from non-gyrokinetic mechanisms such as\ncyclotron heating or the stochastic heating owing to distortions of ions'\nLarmor orbits. An exception to these conclusions occurs in the Hall limit,\ni.e., when the ratio of the ion to electron temperatures is as low as the ion\nbeta (equivalently, the electron beta is order unity). In this regime, slow\nmodes couple to Alfv\\'enic ones well above the Larmor scale (viz., at the ion\ninertial or ion sound scale), so the Alfv\\'enic and compressive cascades join\nand then separate again into two cascades of fluctuations that linearly\nresemble kinetic Alfv\\'en and ion cyclotron waves, with the former heating\nelectrons and the latter ions. The two cascades are shown to decouple, scalings\nfor them are derived, and it is argued physically that the two species will be\nheated by them at approximately equal rates. \n\n"}
