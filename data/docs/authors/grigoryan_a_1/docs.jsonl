Current proposals for such systems achieve an\nenhancement of the magnetic response by a suitable laser field configuration,\nbut still rely on high gas densities. Thus further progress is desirable, and\nthis requires an understanding of the precise mechanism for the enhancement.\nTherefore, here we study the magnetic and electric response to a probe field\ninteracting with three-level atoms in ladder configuration.

However, the\nbroad spectrum of subsequent breakthroughs, surprises, and continuing puzzles\ncould only be partially anticipated. Since the release of the YR, the BESII\nprogram concluded only to give birth to BESIII; the $B$-factories and CLEO-c\nflourished; quarkonium production and polarization measurements at HERA and the\nTevatron matured; and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC have opened a window on the\ndeconfinement regime. All these experiments leave legacies of quality,\nprecision, and unsolved mysteries for quarkonium physics, and therefore beg for\ncontinuing investigations. The plethora of newly-found quarkonium-like states\nunleashed a flood of theoretical investigations into new forms of matter such\nas quark-gluon hybrids, mesonic molecules, and tetraquarks.

However, this\nresonant transmission takes place only in the case when the regularization of\nthe distribution $\\delta'(x) $ is constructed in a specific way. Otherwise, the\n$\\delta'$-potential is fully non-transparent. Moreover, when the transmission\nis non-zero, the structure of a resonant set depends on a regularizing sequence\n$\\Delta'_\\varepsilon(x)$ that tends to $\\delta'(x)$ in the sense of\ndistributions as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$.

However, a key challenge for such solid-state systems\nis to realize a spin coherence time that is much longer than the time for\nquantum spin manipulation protocols. Here we demonstrate an improvement of more\nthan two orders of magnitude in the spin coherence time ($T_2$) of NV centers\ncompared to previous measurements: $T_2 \\approx 0.5$ s at 77 K, which enables\n$\\sim 10^7$ coherent NV spin manipulations before decoherence. We employed\ndynamical decoupling pulse sequences to suppress NV spin decoherence due to\nmagnetic noise, and found that $T_2$ is limited to approximately half of the\nlongitudinal spin relaxation time ($T_1$) over a wide range of temperatures,\nwhich we attribute to phonon-induced decoherence. Our results apply to\nensembles of NV spins and do not depend on the optimal choice of a specific NV,\nwhich could advance quantum sensing, enable squeezing and many-body\nentanglement in solid-state spin ensembles, and open a path to simulating a\nwide range of driven, interaction-dominated quantum many-body Hamiltonians. \n\n"}

This is the fact that the concrete implementation of the\nrestrictions on paths over an interval of time corresponds, in an operator\nlanguage, to sharp monitoring at every moment of time in the given time\ninterval. Such processes suffer from the quantum Zeno effect -- the continual\nmonitoring of a quantum system in a Hilbert subspace prevents its state from\nleaving that subspace. As a consequence, path integral amplitudes defined in\nthis seemingly obvious way have physically and intuitively unreasonable\nproperties and in particular, no sensible classical limit. In this paper we\ndescribe this frequently-occurring but little-appreciated phenomenon in some\ndetail, showing clearly the connection with the quantum Zeno effect.

Two similar models\nhave been proposed, one by Di\\'osi [D-model] and one by Karolyhazy and\ncollaborators [K-model], based on apparently unrelated minimal spacetime\nbounds.

A natural question arises, whether such an impressive\nenhancement persists when one takes into account the decoherence effects that\nare unavoidable in any real-life implementation. In this thesis, we resolve a\nmajor part of this issue by describing general techniques that allow to\nquantify the attainable precision in metrological schemes in the presence of\nuncorrelated noise. We show that the abstract geometrical structure of a\nquantum channel describing the noisy evolution of a single particle dictates\nthen critical bounds on the ultimate quantum enhancement.

In 2005, Dahl conjectured that M can be given a metric, for\nwhich a finite part of the spectrum consists of arbitrarily prescribed\neigenvalues of arbitrary (finite) multiplicity. The only constraints one has to\nrespect are the exception of the zero eigenvalue (due to the Atiyah-Singer\nindex theorem) and in certain dimensions, the quaternionic structure of the\neigenspaces and also the symmetry of the spectrum. Dahl also proved his\nconjecture in case all eigenvalues have simple multiplicities. The question, if\none can prescribe arbitrary multiplicities, or if the existence of eigenvalues\nof higher multiplicity might somehow be topologically obstructed, has been open\never since.

The information is used in order to estimate Farber's topological\ncomplexity of these spaces when $m$ approaches (from below) a 2-power. In\nparticular, we get almost sharp estimates for $F_{2,2^e-1}$ which resemble the\nknown situation for the real projective spaces $F_{1,2^e}$. Our results\nindicate that the agreement between the topological complexity and the\nimmersion dimension of real projective spaces no longer holds for other flag\nmanifolds.

The SOC of the Rashba type is\ncreated if the atoms pick up a {\\pi} phase after completing a cyclic transition\nbetween four combined spin-layer states composed of two spin and two layer\nstates.

On the ring edges the\nbag (infinite mass) boundary conditions are imposed for the field operator.\nThis leads to the Casimir type effect on the vacuum characteristics. The radial\ncurrent vanishes. The charge and the azimuthal current are decomposed into the\nboundary-free and boundary-induced contributions. Both these contributions are\nodd periodic functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux\nquantum. An important feature that distinguishes the VEVs of the charge and\ncurrent densities from the VEV of the energy density, is their finiteness on\nthe ring edges. The current density is equal to the charge density for the\nouter edge and has the opposite sign on the inner edge. The VEVs are peaked\nnear the inner edge and, as functions of the field mass, exhibit quite\ndifferent features for two inequivalent representations of the Clifford\nalgebra.

The resulting map on $\\Sigma$ has lower energy, and repeating this\nprocess on balls covering $\\Sigma$, one can obtain a global harmonic map in the\nlimit. We develop the analogous procedure in the gauge theory context.

The second family consists of\n6-dimensional quasitoric manifolds over polytopes from P. Our main result is\nthat both families are cohomologically rigid, i.e. two manifolds M and M' from\neither of the families are diffeomorphic if and only if their cohomology rings\nare isomorphic. We also prove that if M and M' are diffeomorphic, then their\ncorresponding polytopes are combinatorially equivalent. These results are\nintertwined with the classical subjects of geometry and topology, such as\ncombinatorics of 3-polytopes, the Four Colour Theorem, aspherical manifolds,\ndiffeomorphism classification of 6-manifolds and invariance of Pontryagin\nclasses. The proofs use techniques of toric topology. \n\n"}

The quantum\nFisher information is usually used to determine an upper bound on how precisely\nmeasurements on a state can be used to estimate a classical parameter, and as\nsuch it is an important resource. Quantum enhanced metrology aims to create\nnon-classical states with large quantum Fisher information and utilise them in\nprecision measurements.

In the limit of many such systems, passivity leads in turn to the\nconcept of complete passivity, thermal states, and the emergence of a\nthermodynamic temperature. In contrast, here we need only consider a single\nsystem and show that every passive state except the thermal state is unstable\nunder a weaker form of reversibility. More precisely, we show that given a\nsingle copy of any athermal quantum state we may extract a maximal amount of\nenergy from the state when we can use a machine that operates in a reversible\ncycle and whose state is left unchanged. This means that for individual systems\nthe only form of passivity that is stable under general reversible processes is\ncomplete passivity, and thus provides a single-shot and more physically\nmotivated identification of thermal states and the emergence of temperature.\nThe machine which extracts work from passive states exploits the fact that one\ncan find a subspace which acts as a virtual hot reservoir, and a subspace which\nacts as a virtual cold reservoir.

This problem connects to the classical\ntheory of special functions and, more specifically, to the Hermite as well as\nthe Kummer hypergeometric functions. Reconstructing the solution of the\noriginal diffusion model from novel self-similar solutions of the associated\nself-similar PDE, we infer that the $t^{-1/2}$ decay law of the diffusion\namplitude is {\\it not necessary}. In particular, it is possible to engineer\nsetups of {\\it both} the Cauchy problem and the initial-boundary value problem\nin which the solution decays at a {\\it different rate}. Nevertheless, we\nobserve that the $t^{-1/2}$ rate corresponds to the dominant decay mode among\nintegrable initial data, i.e., ones corresponding to finite mass. Hence, unless\nthe projection to such a mode is eliminated, generically this decay will be the\nslowest one observed. In initial-boundary value problems, an additional issue\nthat arises is whether the boundary data are \\textit{consonant} with the\ninitial data; namely, whether the boundary data agree at all times with the\nsolution of the Cauchy problem associated with the same initial data, when this\nsolution is evaluated at the boundary of the domain.

The\nresulting multipartite entanglement structure captured by this ansatz has\nproven rich enough to describe the ground states and unitary dynamics of\nvarious physical systems of interest. In the present paper, we initiate the\nstudy of neural network states in quantum information-processing tasks. We\ndemonstrate that neural network states are capable of efficiently representing\nquantum codes for quantum information transmission and quantum error\ncorrection, supplying further evidence for the usefulness of neural network\nstates to describe multipartite entanglement.

A feature of this elastica is that it\nexhibits time-dependent monodromy. A frame parallel-transported along the\nelastica is in general only quasi-periodic, resulting in time-dependent\nboundary conditions for the coordinates. This complication is addressed by a\ngauge transformation, after which a contraction mapping argument can be\napplied. Local existence and uniqueness of elastica solutions are established\nfor initial data in suitable Sobolev spaces. \n\n"}

Our strategy is to make\nthis class of algorithms as mathematically transparent as possible.

In so doing, we create symbolic\nabelian quantum hidden subgroup algorithms that are analogous to the those\nsymbolic algorithms found within such software packages as Axiom, Cayley,\nMaple, Mathematica, and Magma.\n  As a spin-off of this effort, we create three different generalizations of\nShor's quantum factoring algorithm to free abelian groups of finite rank. We\nrefer to these algorithms as wandering (or vintage Z_Q) Shor algorithms. They\nare essentially quantum algorithms on free abelian groups A of finite rank n\nwhich, with each iteration, first select a random cyclic direct summand Z of\nthe group A and then apply one iteration of the standard Shor algorithm to\nproduce a random character of the \"approximating\" finite group A=Z_Q, called\nthe group probe.

These experiments are similar in\nnature to those in atomic physics, used in the detection of the Rabi-Vacuum\ncoupling between coherent cavity modes and atoms. Our conjecture is that a\nsimilar Rabi-Vacuum-splitting phenomenon occurs in the MT case. \n\n"}

A mathematical characterization of these monotone magnitudes\nis presented. They are then related to optimal strategies of conversion of\nshared states. More detailed results are presented for pure states of bipartite\nsystems. It is show that more than one measure are required simultaneously in\norder to quantify completely the non-local resources contained in a bipartite\npure state, while examining how this fact does not hold in the so-called\nasymptotic limit. Finally, monotonicity under local transformations is proposed\nas the only natural requirement for measures of entanglement. \n\n"}

The\npresent paper gives a self contained treatment of the subject, following as\nmuch in parallel as possible with classical information theory and, on the\nother side, stressing profound differences of the quantum case. An emphasis is\nmade on recent results, such as general quantum coding theorems including cases\nof infinite (possibly continuous) alphabets and constrained inputs, reliability\nfunction for pure state channels and quantum Gaussian channel. Several still\nunsolved problems are briefly outlined. \n\n"}

The aim of this article is to investigate the decoherence effects,\nwhich lead to superselection sectors, with the help of exactly soluble\nHamiltonian models. Starting from the examples of Araki and of Zurek more\ngeneral models with scattering are presented for which the projection operators\nonto the induced superselection sectors do no longer commute with the\nHamiltonian. The example of an environment given by a free quantum field\nindicates that infrared divergence plays an essential role for the emergence of\ninduced superselection sectors. For all models the induced superselection\nsectors are uniquely determined by the Hamiltonian, whereas the time scale of\nthe decoherence depends crucially on the initial state of the total system. \n\n"}
