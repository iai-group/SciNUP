We demonstrate that our measurement is robust and has an uncertainty\nof only +/-0.4 mas/yr on each component of the proper motion. We find mu_alpha\n= -11.7+/-0.4+/-0.5 mas/yr and mu_delta = +4.2+/-0.4+/-0.5 mas/yr relative to\nthe pulsar's standard of rest, where the two uncertainties are from the\nmeasurement and the ncertainties in correcting the proper motion reference\nframe, respectively. Comparing this proper motion to the symmetry axis of the\npulsar wind nebula, we must also consider the unknown velocity of the pulsar's\nprogenitor (assumed to be ~10 km/s), and hence add an additional uncertainty of\n+/-2 mas/yr to each component of the proper motion, although this could be\nsignificantly larger.

However, massive KK modes in the\nearly universe may become dangerous cosmological relics if the inner manifold\ncontains warped throat(s) with approximate isometries. In the complimentary\npicture, in the AdS/CFT dual gauge theory with extra symmetries, massive\nglueballs of various spins become the dangerous cosmological relics.

We argue that in principle it would\nbe better to fit the foregrounds non-parametrically - allowing the data to\ndetermine their shape - rather than selecting some functional form in advance\nand then fitting its parameters. Non-parametric fits often suffer from other\nproblems, however. We discuss these before suggesting a non-parametric method,\nWp smoothing, which seems to avoid some of them. After outlining the principles\nof Wp smoothing we describe an algorithm used to implement it. We then apply Wp\nsmoothing to a synthetic data cube for the LOFAR EoR experiment. The\nperformance of Wp smoothing, measured by the extent to which it is able to\nrecover the variance of the cosmological signal and to which it avoids leakage\nof power from the foregrounds, is compared to that of a parametric fit, and to\nanother non-parametric method (smoothing splines).

For the same initial\nconditions, such as the fixed accretion rate, it is found that the intrinsic\nsize and radiation intensity of the images become larger, but the images become\nmore compact in the inner region, while the size of the black hole shadow\ndecreases with the increase of the black hole spin. With the increase of the\ninclination angles, the shapes of the black hole shadows change and become\nsmaller, even disappear at all due to the obscuration by the thick disks. For\nmedian inclination angles, the radial velocity observed at infinity is larger\nbecause of both the rotation and radial motion of the fluid in the disk, which\nresults in the luminous part of the images is much brighter. For larger\ninclination angles, such as the disk is edge on, the emission becomes dimmer at\nlonger observational wavelengths (such as at 7.0mm and 3.5mm wavelengths), or\nbrighter at shorter observational wavelengths (such as at 1.3 mm wavelength)\nthan that of the face on case, except for the high spin and high inclination\nimages.

In particular, we show that if one records an\nanisotropy signal produced by heavy nuclei of charge Z above an energy E_{thr},\none should record an even stronger (possibly much stronger) anisotropy at\nenergies >E_{thr}/Z due to the proton component that is expected to be\nassociated with the sources of the heavy nuclei. This conclusion remains robust\nwith respect to the parameters characterizing the sources and it does not\ndepend at all on the modelling of astrophysical magnetic fields. As a concrete\nexample, we apply this test to the most recent data of the Pierre Auger\nObservatory. Assuming that the anisotropy reported above 55EeV is not a\nstatistical accident, and that no significant anisotropy has been observed at\nenergies <10EeV, we show that the apparent clustering toward Cen A cannot be\nattributed to heavy nuclei. Similar conclusions are drawn regarding the\napparent excess correlation with nearby active galactic nuclei. We then discuss\na robust lower bound to the magnetic luminosity that a source must possess in\norder to be able to accelerate particles of charge Z up to 100EeV,\nL_B>10^{45}Z^{-2}erg/s. Using this bound in conjunction with the above\nconclusions, we argue that the current PAO data does not support the model of\ncosmic ray origin in active radio-quiet or even radio-loud galaxies. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that the apparent clustering in the direction of Cen A can be\nexplained by the contribution of the last few gamma-ray bursts or magnetars in\nthe host galaxy thanks to the scattering of the cosmic rays on the magnetized\nlobes. \n\n"}

In this paper we show that the main\nobserved properties of this HE emission are those predicted by the cannonball\n(CB) model of GRBs: In the CB model all the observed radiations in a GRB are\nproduced by the interaction of a highly relativistic jet of plasmoids (CBs)\nwith the environment. The prompt X-ray and MeV $\\gamma$-ray pulses are produced\nby inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of glory photons -photons scattered/emitted\ninto a cavity created by the wind/ejecta blown from the progenitor star or a\ncompanion star long before the GRB- by the thermal electrons in the CBs. A\nsimultaneous optical and high energy emission begins shortly after each MeV\npulse when the CB collides with the wind/ejecta, and continues during the\ndeceleration of the CB in the interstellar medium. The optical emission is\ndominated by synchrotron radiation (SR) from the swept-in and knocked-on\nelectrons which are Fermi accelerated to high energies by the turbulent\nmagnetic fields in the CBs, while ICS of these SR photons dominates the\nemission of HE photons. The lightcurves of the optical and HE emissions have\napproximately the same temporal behaviour but have different power-law spectra.\nThe emission of very high energy (VHE) photons above 100 TeV is dominated by\nthe decay of $\\pi^0$'s produced in hadronic collisions of Fermi accelerated\nprotons in the CBs.

This catalog\nsummarizes 46 high-confidence pulsed detections using the first six months of\ndata taken by the Large Area Telescope (LAT), Fermi's main instrument. Sixteen\npreviously unknown pulsars were discovered by searching for pulsed signals at\nthe positions of bright gamma-ray sources seen with the LAT, or at the\npositions of objects suspected to be neutron stars based on observations at\nother wavelengths. Pulsed gamma-ray emission was discovered from twenty-four\nknown pulsars by using ephemerides (timing solutions) derived from monitoring\nradio pulsars. Eight of these new gamma-ray pulsars are millisecond pulsars.\nThe pulsed energy spectra can be described by a power law with an exponential\ncutoff, with cutoff energies in the range 1 to 5 GeV. The rotational energy\nloss rate (\\dot{E}) of these neutron stars spans 5 decades, from ~3x10^{33}\nerg/s to 5x10^{38} erg/s, and the apparent efficiencies for conversion to\ngamma-ray emission range from ~0.1% to unity, although distance uncertainties\ncomplicate efficiency estimates. The pulse shapes show substantial diversity,\nbut roughly 75% of the gamma-ray pulse profiles have two peaks, separated by\n>0.2 of rotational phase. For most of the pulsars, gamma-ray emission appears\nto come mainly from the outer magnetosphere, while polar-cap emission remains\nplausible for a remaining few. Finally, these discoveries suggest that\ngamma-ray-selected young pulsars are born at a rate comparable to that of their\nradio-selected cousins and that the birthrate of all young gamma-ray-detected\npulsars is a substantial fraction of the expected Galactic supernova rate. \n\n"}

The X-ray spectrum is characterized by two main peculiar\nfeatures, i) a strong soft excess with a steep rise below about 1.3 keV and ii)\na deep drop in flux above 8.2 keV. We focus here on a reflection-based\ninterpretation which interprets both features, as well as the large soft\nexcess, in terms of partially ionized reflection off the inner accretion disc.\nWe show that the two peculiar spectral features mentioned above can be\nreproduced by two relativistic emission lines due to Fe K and Fe L. The lines\nare produced in the inner accretion disc and independently yield consistent\ndisc parameters. We argue that the high L/K intensity ratio is broadly\nconsistent with expectations from an ionized accretion disc reflection,\nindicating that they belong to a single ionized reflection component. The\nspectral shape, X-ray flux, and variability properties are very similar in the\nXMM-Newton and Suzaku observations, performed about 5 years apart.

A plausible scenario is\nthat this emission is the afterglow synchrotron emission produced by electrons\naccelerated in the forward shocks. In this scenario, the electrons that produce\nsynchrotron high-energy emission also undergo inverse-Compton (IC) loss and the\nIC scattering with the synchrotron photons should be in the Klein-Nishina\nregime. Here we study effects of the Klein-Nishina scattering on the\nhigh-energy synchrotron afterglow emission.

Several studies have modeled these hazes as\nradiation from the leptonic byproducts of dark matter annihilations, and\narguably no convincing astrophysical alternative has been suggested. We discuss\nthe characteristics of astrophysical cosmic ray sources that could potentially\nexplain this microwave and gamma-ray emission. The most promising astrophysical\nscenarios involve cosmic ray sources that are clustered such that many fall\nwithin ~1 kpc of the Galactic Center. For example, we show that several hundred\nGalactic Center supernovae in the last million years plus a diffusion-hardened\nelectron spectrum may be consistent with present constraints on this emission.\nAlternatively, it could be due to a burst of activity probably associated with\nSagittarius A* occurring ~1 Myr ago and producing >10^51 erg in cosmic ray\nelectrons. Different models predict different trends for the spectral index of\nthe microwave and gamma-ray spectrum as a function of angle from the Galactic\nCenter that should be robust to cosmic ray propagation uncertainties.

Motivated by recent detection of\nemission from very early stages of several SNe, we revisit the theory of shock\nbreakout and the following emission. We derive analytic light curves, paying\nspecial attention to the photon-gas coupling and deviations from thermal\nequilibrium. We then consider the breakout from several SNe progenitors. We\nfind that for more compact progenitors, white dwarfs, Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs)\nand possibly more energetic blue-supergiant explosions, the observed radiation\nis out of thermal equilibrium at the breakout, during the planar phase (i.e.,\nbefore the expanding gas doubles its radius), and during the early spherical\nphase. Therefore, during these phases we predict significantly higher\ntemperatures than previous analysis that assumed equilibrium. When thermal\nequilibrium prevails, we find the location of the thermalization depth and its\ntemporal evolution. Our results are useful for interpretation of early SN light\ncurves. Some examples are: (i) Red supergiant SNe have an early bright peak in\noptical and UV flux, less than an hour after breakout.

Methods: We show by simple estimates that magnetic field decay, dark\nmatter accretion, and crust cracking mechanism are unlikely to have a\nsignificant effect on old neutron stars. The thermal evolution for the other\nmechanisms is computed using the code of Fern\\'andez and Reisenegger.

Results: We find that\nmagnetic field decay, dark matter accretion, and crust cracking do not produce\ndetectable heating of old pulsars.

More restrictive\nupper limits on the surface temperatures of classical pulsars could rule out\nvortex creep as the main source of thermal emission.

The radio frequency spectrum and angular distribution depend on\nthe shower development, so are sensitive to the interaction cross sections. At\nenergies above about 10^{16} eV (in ice), the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM)\neffect significantly reduces the cross sections for the two dominant\nelectromagnetic interactions: bremsstrahlung and pair production. At higher\nenergies, above about 10^{20} eV, the photonuclear cross section becomes larger\nthan that for pair production, and direct pair production and electronuclear\ninteractions become dominant over bremsstrahlung. The electron interaction\nlength reaches a maximum around 10^{21} eV, and then decreases slowly as the\nelectron energy increases further. In this regime, the growth in the photon\ncross section and electron energy loss moderates the rise in nu_e shower\nlength, which rises from ~10 m at 10^{16} eV to ~50 m at 10^{19} eV and ~100 m\nat 10^{20} eV, but only to ~1 km at 10^{24} eV.

The different types of radioactive decay, alpha,\nbeta, and gamma decay, all are different types of interactions causing the\nsame, spontaneous, and time-independent decay of an unstable nucleus into\nanother and more stable nucleus. Nuclear reactions in cosmic sites re-arrange\nthe basic constituents of atomic nuclei (neutrons and protons) among the\ndifferent configurations which are allowed by Nature, thus producing\nradioactive isotopes as a by-product. Throughout cosmic history, such reactions\noccur in different sites, and lead to rearrangements of the relative abundances\nof cosmic nuclei, a process called cosmic chemical evolution, which can be\nstudied through the observations of radioactivity. The special role of\nradioactivity in such studies is contributed by the intrinsic decay of such\nmaterial after it has been produced in cosmic sites. This brings in a new\naspect, the clock of the radioactive decay. Observational studies of cosmic\nradioactivities intrinsically obtain isotopic information which are at the\nheart of cosmic nucleosynthesis. They are best performed by precision mass\nspectroscopy in terrestrial laboratories, which has been combined with\nsophisticated radiochemistry to extract meteoritic components originating from\noutside the solar system, and by spectroscopy of characteristic gamma-ray lines\nemitted upon radioactive decay in cosmic environments and measured with\nspace-based telescopes.

Combining our results with previous\nworks, we reach potential associations for 119 out of the 128 Fermi sources\nwithin said region. If these associations are correct, we estimate that less\nthan 20% of all remaining unassociated 1FGL sources at high Galactic latitude\n(|b| > 15 degrees) might host `exotic' counterparts distinct from known classes\nof gamma-ray emitters.

Abridged Although Li has been extensively\nstudied in the Galactic disk and halo, to date there is only one uncertain\ndetection of Li in an unevolved bulge star. AIMS: Our aim with this study is to\nprovide the first clear detection of Li in the Galactic bulge, based on an\nanalysis of a dwarf star that has largely retained its initial Li abundance.\nMETHODS: We have performed a detailed elemental abundance analysis of the bulge\ndwarf star MOA-2010-BLG-285S using a high-resolution, and high signal-to-noise\nspectrum obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the VLT when the object was\noptically magnified during a gravitational microlensing event (visual\nmagnification A~550 during observation). The lithium abundance was determined\nthrough synthetic line profile fitting of the 7Li resonance doublet line at\n670.8 nm. The results have been corrected for departures from LTE. Results:\nMOA-2010-BLG-285S is, at [Fe/H]=-1.23, the most metal-poor dwarf star detected\nso far in the Galactic bulge. Its old age (12.5 Gyr) and enhanced [alpha/Fe]\nratios agree well with stars in the thick disk at similar metallicity. This\nstar represents the first unambiguous detection of Li in a metal-poor dwarf\nstar in the Galactic bulge. We find an NLTE corrected Li abundance of log\ne(Li)=2.16, which is consistent with values derived for Galactic disk and halo\ndwarf stars at similar metallicities and temperatures. Conclusion: Our results\nshow that there are no signs of Li enrichment or production in the Galactic\nbulge during its earliest phases. Observations of Li in other galaxies (omega\nCen) and other components of the Galaxy suggest further that the Spite plateau\nis universal. \n\n"}

Additional uncertainties arise due to the choices\nmade by analysts in determining Epeak (e.g., the start and stop times of\nintegration), imperfect knowledge of the response of the detector, different\nenergy ranges for various detectors, and differences in models used to fit the\nspectra.

We\nmeasure that the one-sigma uncertainty associated with the analyst's choices is\n28%, i.e., 0.12 in Log10(Epeak), with the resultant errors always being\npresent.

We\nshow that such a delay can arise even in bright quasars for purely dynamical\nreasons. If some large-scale process produces rapid inflow, smaller scales will\nquickly become gas-dominated. As the gas density peaks, so does the SFR.\nHowever, gravitational torques which govern further inflow are relatively\ninefficient in gas-dominated systems; as more gas is turned into stars, the\nstars provide an efficient angular momentum sink allowing more rapid inflow.\nMoreover, the gas provided to the central regions in mergers or strong disk\ninstabilities will typically be ~100 times larger than that needed to fuel the\nBH; the system is effectively in the 'infinite gas supply' limit. BH growth can\ntherefore continue for some time while the gas supply exhausts, until it has\nsignificantly depleted to the point where the BH is finally 'starved.'

We\nwant to outline a coherent description of Tycho's properties in terms of SNR\nevolution, shock hydrodynamics and multi-wavelength emission by accounting for\nparticle acceleration at the forward shock via first order Fermi mechanism. We\nadopt here a quick and reliable semi-analytical approach to non-linear\ndiffusive shock acceleration which includes magnetic field amplification due to\nresonant streaming instability and the dynamical backreaction on the shock of\nboth cosmic rays (CRs) and self-generated magnetic turbulence. We find that\nTycho's forward shock is accelerating protons up to at least 500 TeV,\nchannelling into CRs about the 10 per cent of its kinetic energy. Moreover, the\nCR-induced streaming instability is consistent with all the observational\nevidences indicating a very efficient magnetic field amplification (up to ~300\nmicro Gauss).

The point source was also detected in follow-up higher\nfrequency(1170 MHz) observations. The spectral index for the point source\nobtained from the GMRT observations is alpha = -2.1. The steep spectrum, as\nwell as the location of the point source near the centre of the SNR establish\nthe fact that it is indeed the pulsar J2022+3842 associated with this SNR.\nConsistent with this, subsequent analysis of archival Chandra X-ray data shows\na point source coincident with the radio point source, as well as diffuse\nextended X-ray emission surrounding the unresolved source. However, no pulsed\nemission was detected despite deep searches at both 610 MHz and 1160 MHz\nalthough pulsed emission has been seen at 2 GHz with the GBT.

{"id": "1106.4179", "contents": "Title: Formation of stars and planets: the role of magnetic fields Abstract: Star formation is thought to be triggered by gravitational collapse of the\ndense cores of molecular clouds. Angular momentum conservation during the\ncollapse results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force, which\neventually halts the inflow of material and leads to the development of a\ncentral mass surrounded by a disc. In the presence of an angular momentum\ntransport mechanism, mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through\nthis disc, and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of\ntheir mass. However, the mechanisms responsible for this transport of angular\nmomentum are not well understood. Although the gravitational field of a\ncompanion star or even gravitational instabilities (particularly in massive\ndiscs) may play a role, the most general mechanisms are turbulence viscosity\ndriven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and outflows accelerated\ncentrifugally from the surfaces of the disc.

Several such uses of ground-based data, especially weak\ngravitational lensing, require highly precise measurements of galaxy image\nstatistics with careful correction for the effects of the point-spread function\n(PSF). In this paper, we introduce the SHERA (SHEar Reconvolution Analysis)\nsoftware to simulate ground-based imaging data with realistic galaxy\nmorphologies and observing conditions, starting from space-based data (from\nCOSMOS, the Cosmological Evolution Survey) and accounting for the effects of\nthe space-based PSF. This code simulates ground-based data, optionally with a\nweak lensing shear applied, in a model-independent way using a general Fourier\nspace formalism. The utility of this pipeline is that it allows for a precise,\nrealistic assessment of systematic errors due to the method of data processing,\nfor example in extracting weak lensing galaxy shape measurements or galaxy\nradial profiles, given user-supplied observational conditions and real galaxy\nmorphologies. Moreover, the simulations allow for the empirical test of error\nestimates and determination of parameter degeneracies, via generation of many\nnoise maps.

An investigation of the\nrelationship among G8.7-0.1 and the TeV unidentified source HESS J1804-216\nprovides us with an important clue on diffusion process of cosmic rays if\nparticle acceleration operates in the SNR. The GeV gamma-ray emission is\nextended with most of the emission in positional coincidence with the SNR\nG8.7-0.1 and a lesser part located outside the western boundary of G8.7-0.1.\nThe region of the gamma-ray emission overlaps spatially-connected molecular\nclouds, implying a physical connection for the gamma-ray structure.

This is achieved by summarizing the efficiencies of\naccretion, cooling, star formation, and feedback given by the HYD, as functions\nof the halo mass and redshift. Surprisingly, by turning the HYD into a SAM, we\nconserve the mass of individual galaxies, with deviations at the level of 0.1\ndex, on an object-by-object basis. This is true for all redshifts, and for the\nmass of stars and gas components, although the agreement reaches 0.2 dex for\nsatellite galaxies at low redshift. We show that the same level of accuracy is\nobtained even in case the SAM uses only one phase of gas within each galaxy.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that the formation history of one massive galaxy\nprovides sufficient information for the SAM to reproduce the population of\ngalaxies within the entire cosmological box. The reasons for the small scatter\nbetween the HYD and SAM galaxies are: a) The efficiencies are matched as\nfunctions of the halo mass and redshift, meaning that the evolution within\nmerger-trees agrees on average. b) For a given galaxy, efficiencies fluctuate\naround the mean value on time scales of 0.2-2 Gyr. c) The various mass\ncomponents of galaxies are obtained by integrating the efficiencies over time,\naveraging out these fluctuations. We compare the efficiencies found here to\nstandard SAM recipes and find that they often deviate significantly. For\nexample, here the HYD shows smooth accretion that is less effective for low\nmass haloes, and is always composed of hot or dilute gas; cooling is less\neffective at high redshift; and star formation changes only mildly with cosmic\ntime. The method developed here can be applied in general to any HYD, and can\nthus serve as a common language for both HYDs and SAM (Abridged). \n\n"}

In Type I AGN that have a\ntypical X-ray luminosity of Lx~1.5e44 erg/s and z~1.6, the cold Fe K at 6.4 keV\nis weak (EW~0.05keV), in agreement with the known trend. In contrast,\nhigh-ionization lines of Fe XXV and Fe XXVI are pronounced. These\nhigh-ionization Fe K lines appear to have a connection with high accretion\nrates. While no broad Fe emission is detected in the total spectrum, it might\nbe present, albeit at low significance, when the X-ray luminosity is restricted\nto the range below 3e44 erg/s, or when an intermediate range of Eddington ratio\naround 0.1 is selected. In Type II AGN, both cold and high-ionzation lines\nbecome weak with increasing X-ray luminosity. However, strong high-ionization\nFe K (EW~0.3 keV) is detected in the spectrum of objects at z>2, while no 6.4\nkeV line is found.

Therefore, deep studies of these objects are instrumental for an\nunderstanding of the high energy processes in our Galaxy. RX J0852.0-4622, also\nknown as Vela Junior, is one of the few (4) shell-type SNRs resolved at Very\nHigh Energies (VHE; E > 100 GeV). It is one of the largest known VHE sources (~\n1.0 deg radius) and its flux level is comparable to the flux level of the Crab\nNebula in the same energy band. These characteristics allow for a detailed\nanalysis, shedding further light on the high-energy processes taking place in\nthe remnant. In this document we present further details on the spatial and\nspectral morphology derived with an extended data set. The analysis of the\nspectral morphology of the remnant is compatible with a constant power-law\nphoton index of 2.11 +/- 0.05_stat +/- 0.20_syst from the whole SNR in the\nenergy range from 0.5 TeV to 7 TeV. The analysis of the spatial morphology\nshows an enhanced emission towards the direction of the pulsar PSR J0855-4644,\nhowever as the pulsar is lying on the rim of the SNR, it is difficult to\ndisentangle both contributions. Therefore, assuming a point source, the upper\nlimit on the flux of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) between 1 TeV and 10 TeV, is\nestimated to be ~ 2% of the Crab Nebula flux in the same energy range. \n\n"}

The reason is in the divergent\nnature of amplification factors near fold caustics increasingly sensitive to\nsmall spatial size details. Higher-order disc images produced by strong light\nbending around the black hole may affect the amplification curves, making a\ncontribution of up to several percent near maximum amplification. In accordance\nwith theoretical predictions, some of the observed high-amplification events\npossess fine structure. Here we consider three putative caustic crossing\nevents, one by SBS1520+530 and two events for individual images of the\nEinstein's cross (QSO J2237+0305). Using relativistic disc models allows to\nimprove the fits, but the required inclinations are high, about 70deg or\nlarger. Such high inclinations apparently contradict the absence of any strong\nabsorption that is likely to arise if a disc is observed edge-on through a dust\ntorus. Still, the high inclinations are required only for the central parts of\nthe disc, that allows the disc itself to be initially tilted by 60-90deg with\nrespect to the black hole and aligned toward the black hole equatorial plane\nnear the last stable orbit radius. For SBS1520+530, an alternative explanation\nfor the observed amplification curve is a superposition of two subsequent fold\ncaustic crossings. While relativistic disc models favour black hole masses\n~10^10 solar (several times higher than the virial estimates) or small\nEddington ratios, this model is consistent with the observed distribution of\ngalaxies over peculiar velocities only if the black hole mass is about 3 10^8\nsolar. \n\n"}

The model independent and\ndependent spectral analysis showed that during these time lags the structure of\naccretion disk significantly varied.

The two\nclasses are comprised of: (1) The weak jet sources, corresponding to FR I radio\ngalaxies, having a decelerating or spine-sheath jet with velocity gradients,\nand (2) The strong jet sources, having fast, collimated jets, and typically\ndisplaying strong emission lines. The dichotomy in the \\nu_peak-L_peak plane\ncan be understood as a `broken power sequence' in which jets exist on one\nbranch or the other based on the particular accretion mode.

However, the median\nmetallicity of the 7 broad-lined SN Ic (SN Ic-BL) in our sample is\nsignificantly lower, log(O/H)+12 = 8.34. The age of the young stellar\npopulation of SN Ic-BL host environments also seems to be lower than for SN Ib\nand Ic, but our age sample is small. A synthesis of SN Ibc host environment\nspectroscopy to date does not reveal a significant difference in SN Ib and Ic\nmetallicities, but reinforces the significance of the lower metallicities for\nSN Ic-BL. This combined sample demonstrates that galaxy-targeted SN searches\nintroduce a significant bias for studies seeking to infer the metallicity\ndistribution of SN progenitors, and we identify and discuss other systematic\neffects that play smaller roles. We discuss the path forward for making\nprogress on SN Ibc progenitor studies in the LSST era. \n\n"}

These winds provide the matter that manifests\nas blueshifted absorption features in the UV and X-ray spectra of a large\nfraction of these sources; furthermore, their density distribution in the\npoloidal plane determines the \"appearance\" (i.e. the column and velocity\nstructure of these absorption features) as a function of the observer\ninclination angle. This work focuses on just the broadest characteristics of\nthese objects; nonetheless, it provides scaling laws that allow one to\nreproduce within this model the properties of objects spanning a very wide\nluminosity range and viewed at different inclination angles, and trace them to\na common underlying dynamical structure.

It appears after the spontaneous\nbreaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry, which was proposed to solve the\nstrong-CP problem. Other pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons, postulated in some\nextensions of the standard model of particle physics, are called axion-like\nparticles (ALPs) if they share certain characteristics with the axion, in\nparticular a coupling to two photons. Thus far, axion and ALP searches have\nbeen unsuccessful, indicating that their couplings have to be extremely weak.\nHowever, axions and ALPs could be responsible for some observable effects in\nastrophysics and cosmology, which can also be exploited to constrain the\nparameter space of these particles. We focus on limits coming from cosmology,\nwhich is an optimal field for studying axions and ALPs. In particular, we first\ninvestigate the possibility of a primordial population of axions and ALPs\narising during the earliest epochs of the universe. The importance of this\nanalysis lies on the fact that axions and ALPs are ideal dark matter candidates\nbecause of their faint interactions and their peculiar production mechanisms.\nFinally, we consider the consequences of the decay of such a population on\nspecific cosmological observables, namely the photon spectrum of galaxies, the\ncosmic microwave background, the effective number of neutrino species, and the\nabundance of primordial elements. Our bounds constitute the most stringent\nprobes of early decays and exclude a part of the ALP parameter space that is\notherwise very difficult to test experimentally. \n\n"}

Our results show that asymmetric mass ejection caused\nby hydrodynamic instabilities can accelerate the neutron star (NS) up to recoil\nvelocities of more than 700 km/s by the \"gravitational tug-boat mechanism\",\nwhich is enough to explain most observed pulsar velocities. The associated NS\nspin periods are about 100 ms to 8 s without any correlation between spin and\nkick magnitudes or directions. This suggests that faster spins and a possible\nspin-kick alignment might require angular momentum in the progenitor core prior\nto collapse. Our simulations for the first time demonstrate a clear correlation\nbetween the size of the NS kick and anisotropic ejection of heavy elements\ncreated by explosive burning behind the shock. In the case of large NS kicks\nthe explosion is significantly stronger opposite to the kick vector. Therefore\nthe bulk of the Fe-group elements, in particular nickel, is ejected mostly in\nlarge clumps against the kick direction. This contrasts with the case of low\nrecoil velocity, where the Ni-rich lumps are more isotropically distributed.\nIntermediate-mass nuclei heavier than Si (like Ca and Ti) also exhibit a\nsignificant enhancement in the hemisphere opposite to the direction of fast NS\nmotion, while the distribution of C, O, and Ne is not affected, and that of Mg\nonly marginally. Mapping the spatial distribution of the heavy elements in SN\nremnants with identified pulsar motion may offer an important diagnostic test\nof the kick mechanism.

This hyperaccretion disk is optically thin to\nneutrinos in the radial direction, therefore the neutrinos produced at one\nradius can travel for a long distance in the disk. Those neutrinos can thus be\nabsorbed with certain probability by the disk matter at the other radius and\nheat the disk there. The effect of this \"global neutrino heating\" has been\nignored in previous works and is the focus of this paper. We find that around\nthe \"ignition\" radius r_{ign}, the global neutrino heating rate could be\ncomparable to or even larger than the local viscous heating rate thus must be\nan important process. Two possible consequences are in order if the \"global\nneutrino heating\" is taken into account: i) the temperature of the disk is\nslightly raised and the \"ignition\" radius r_{ign} slightly shifts to a larger\nradius, both lead to the increasing of the total neutrino flux; ii) what is\nmore interesting is that, the temperature of the ADAF just beyond r_{ign} may\nbe raised above the virial temperature thus the accretion will be suppressed.\nIn this case, the activity of the black hole is expected to oscillate between\nan active and inactive phases.

It has been pointed out that IceCube has\noverestimated the neutrino flux at GRB site by a factor of $\\sim 5$. In this\npaper we point out that, in addition to the issue of neutrino production at\nsource, the neutrino oscillation and the possible neutrino decay during their\nflight from GRB to Earth should further reduce the detectability of IceCube,\nwhich is most sensitive to the muon-neutrino flavor as far as point-source\nidentification is concerned.

If the location of the crust cracking of the magnetic\nfield is close to the magnetic pole, part of the released energy may excite the\nAlfevn wave that can propagate into outer magnetosphere. The oscillation of the\nmagnetic field induces the available potential drop ~10^{15}Volts, which can\naccelerate the electrons and/or positrons to the Lorentz factor ~10^{7} in the\nouter magnetosphere. The curvature radiation process at outer magnetosphere can\nproduce GeV gamma-rays. If the radiation process is occurred above r~5x 10^7cm\nfrom the stellar surface, the emitted GeV gamma-rays can escape from the\npair-creation process with the X-rays and/or the magnetic field. The expected\nluminosity of the GeV emissions is order of L_{\\gamma}< 10^{35} erg/s, and the\nradiation process will last for a temporal scale of years.

Instead, this torque-limited accretion model yields black\nholes and galaxies evolving on average along the observed scaling relations by\nrelying only on a fixed, 5% mass retention rate onto the black hole from the\nradius at which the accretion flow is fed. Feedback from the black hole may\n(and likely does) occur, but does not need to couple to galaxy-scale gas in\norder to regulate black hole growth. We show that this result is insensitive to\nvariations in the initial black hole mass, stellar feedback, or other\nimplementation details. The torque-limited model allows for high accretion\nrates at very early epochs (unlike the Bondi case), which if viable can help\nexplain the rapid early growth of black holes, while by z = 2 it yields\nEddington factors of 1%-10%. This model also yields a less direct\ncorrespondence between major merger events and rapid phases of black hole\ngrowth.

These globular clusters are expected to provide a large\nnumber of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) within the central parsec of the Galactic\nCenter. We propose that the GeV $\\gamma$-ray emission observed from the\nGalactic Center is in fact a cumulative effect of the emission from several\nglobular clusters captured by the Galactic Center black hole. Moreover, the\nmillisecond pulsars in globular clusters accelerate leptons in their wind zones\nto energies of the order of a few tens of TeV injecting them into the dense\ninfrared and optical radiation region present within the central parsec.

To disentangle different models requires detailed comparisons\nbetween theoretical predictions and multi-wavelength observations. Our previous\nsimulations have demonstrated that the primary features of the Fermi bubbles\ncould be successfully reproduced by recent jet activity from the central active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN). In this work, we generate gamma-ray and microwave maps\nand spectra based on the simulated properties of cosmic rays (CRs) and magnetic\nfields in order to examine whether the observed bubble and haze emission could\nbe explained by leptons contained in the AGN jets. We also investigate the\nmodel predictions of the polarization properties of the Fermi bubbles. We find\nthat: (1) The same population of leptons can simultaneously explain the bubble\nand haze emission given that the magnetic fields within the bubbles are very\nclose to the exponentially distributed ambient field, which can be explained by\nmixing in of the ambient field followed by turbulent field amplification; (2)\nThe centrally peaked microwave profile suggests CR replenishment, which is\nconsistent with the presence of a more recent second jet event; (3) The bubble\ninterior exhibits a high degree of polarization because of ordered radial\nmagnetic field lines stretched by elongated vortices behind the shocks;\nhighly-polarized signals could also be observed inside the draping layer; (4)\nEnhancement of rotation measures could exist within the shock-compressed layer\nbecause of increased gas density and more amplified and ordered magnetic\nfields. We discuss the possibility that the deficient haze emission at b<-35\ndegrees is due to the suppression of magnetic fields, which is consistent with\nthe existence of lower-energy CRs causing the polarized emission at 2.3 GHz.\nPossible AGN jet composition in the leptonic scenario is also discussed. \n\n"}

The source has large fractional circular polarization, m_c \\equiv |V|/I,\ndetected at high significance across the entire band (from 15 to 90\\sigma per\n128 MHz sub-band).

The corresponding supernova simulations represent two extreme cases,\ne.g., with respect to the protoneutron star (PNS) compactness and shock\nevolution.

The suppression is due to a change in the rest-mass density\nand angular velocity profiles due to the formation and to the linear growth of\na toroidal component that rapidly overcomes the original poloidal one, leading\nto an amplification of the total magnetic energy. The study is carried out\nperforming three-dimensional ideal-magnetohydrodynamics simulations in full\ngeneral relativity, superimposing to the initial (matter) equilibrium\nconfigurations a purely poloidal magnetic field in the range $10^{14}-10^{16}$\nG.

The source exhibits remarkable spectral\nvariability from months to years timescales. The observed spectral variability\nis entirely due to variations of the column density of a neutral absorber\ntowards the intrinsic nuclear continuum. The column density is generally\nCompton-thin ranging from a few times 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ to a few times\n10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$.

These accretion flows are responsible\nfor luminous systems such as active galactic nuclei radiating at or close to\nthe Eddington luminosity and black hole X-ray binaries in the soft state. Hot\naccretion flows, the topic of this review, are virially hot and optically thin.\nThey occur at lower mass accretion rates, and are described by models such as\nthe advection-dominated accretion flow and luminous hot accretion flow.

CSI\nuses a flux-limited sample of galaxies in Spitzer IRAC 3.6micron imaging of\nSWIRE fields to efficiently trace the stellar mass of average galaxies to\nz~1.5. This paper provides an overview of the survey selection, observations,\nand processing of the photometry and spectrophotometry.

Our unique methodology for analyzing low-dispersion\nspectra taken with multilayer prisms in IMACS, combined with panchromatic\nphotometry from the ultraviolet to the IR, has yielded high quality redshifts\nfor 43,347 galaxies in our first 5.3 sq. degs of the SWIRE XMM-LSS field. A new\napproach to assessing data quality is also described, and three different\napproaches are used to estimate our redshift errors, with robust agreement.\nOver the full range of 3.6micron fluxes of our selection, we find typical\nredshift uncertainties of sigma_z/(1+z) < 0.015. In comparisons with previously\npublished spectroscopic redshifts we find scatters of sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.011 for\ngalaxies at 0.7< z< 0.9, and sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.014 for galaxies at 0.9< z< 1.2.\nFor galaxies brighter and fainter than i=23 mag, we find sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.008\nand sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.022, respectively.

Recent simulations and\nobservations have shown that the smooth spectral structure of foregrounds\ncombines with instrument chromaticity to contaminate a \"wedge\"-shaped region in\ncylindrical Fourier space.

Using a quadratic estimator\nformalism applied to the interferometric measurement equation, we provide a\nframework for such a rigorous analysis (incorporating a fully covariant\ntreatment of errors).

A search for (active) SMBH\nbinaries (SMBHBs) at the centers of the merger remnants is currently ongoing.\nPerhaps the greatest challenge is to identify the inactive SMBHBs, which might\nbe the most abundant, but are also the most difficult to identify.

We show that the deep\ndips in its evolving X-ray light curve can be well explained by the presence of\na SMBHB at its core. A SMBHB model with a mass of the primary of M_BH = 10^7\nM_sun, a mass ratio q=0.08, and a semimajor axis a_b = 0.6 mpc is in good\nagreement with the observations.

To investigate this, we ran Newtonian smooth particle hydrodynamical\nsimulations starting with an incoming donor approaching an IMBH on a parabolic\norbit. We survey a large parameter space by varying the star-to-BH mass ratio\n($10^{-5}-10^{-3}$) and the periapsis separation $r_p$ from 2.2 to $2.7~r_t$\nwith $r_t$, the tidal radius.

The resulting abundances are very\nsimilar to each other and reproduce the general features of the observed\nr-process abundance (the second and third peaks, the rare-earth peak and the\nlead peak) for all mass models as they are mainly determined by the fission\nyields. We find distinct differences in the abundance yields at and just above\nthe third peak, which can be traced back to different predictions of neutron\nseparation energies for r-process nuclei around neutron number $N=130$. The\nremaining trajectories, which contribute 10% by mass to the total integrated\nabundances, follow such a fast expansion that the r process does not use all\nthe neutrons.

Abstract: Measurements of the cosmic ray antiproton spectrum can be used to search for\ncontributions from annihilating dark matter and to constrain the dark matter\nannihilation cross section. Depending on the assumptions made regarding cosmic\nray propagation in the Galaxy, such constraints can be quite stringent. We\nrevisit this topic, utilizing a set of propagation models fit to the cosmic ray\nboron, carbon, oxygen and beryllium data. We derive upper limits on the dark\nmatter annihilation cross section and find that when the cosmic ray propagation\nparameters are treated as nuisance parameters (as we argue is appropriate), the\nresulting limits are significantly less stringent than have been previously\nreported. We also note (as have several previous groups) that simple\nGALPROP-like diffusion-reacceleration models predict a spectrum of cosmic ray\nantiprotons that is in good agreement with PAMELA's observations above ~5 GeV,\nbut that significantly underpredict the flux at lower energies.

NuSTAR\ndetected the source serendipitously as it was emerging from quiescence: its\nluminosity was $6\\times 10^{34}$ erg~s$^{-1}$ on 2013 July 31, and $5\\times\n10^{35}$ erg~s$^{-1}$ in a second observation on 2013 August 3. A bright, 800-s\nlong, H-triggered mixed H/He thermonuclear Type I burst with mild photospheric\nradius expansion (PRE) was present during the second observation. Assuming that\nthe luminosity during the PRE was at the Eddington level, a H mass fraction\n$X=0.7$ in the atmosphere, and a neutron star mass $M=1.4 M_{\\odot}$, we\ndetermine a new lower limit on the distance for this source of $6.3 \\pm 0.5$\nkpc. Combining with previous upper limits, this places GRS 1741.9-2853 at a\ndistance of 7 kpc. Energy independent (achromatic) variability is observed\nduring the cooling of the neutron star, which could result from the disturbance\nof the inner accretion disk by the burst. The large dynamic range of this burst\nreveals a long power-law decay tail. We also detect, at a 95.6\\% confidence\nlevel (1.7 $\\sigma$), a narrow absorption line at $5.46\\pm0.10$ keV during the\nPRE phase of the burst, reminiscent of the detection by Waki et al. (1984).

To\nensure robust photometric redshift solutions, and to minimize incompleteness,\nwe confine our search to objects with H_{160} < 28.6 (AB mag), consider only\nimage regions with an rms noise sigma_{160} > 30 mag (within a 0.5-arcsec\ndiameter aperture), and insist on detections in both H_{160} and J_{140}. The\nresult is a survey covering an effective area (after accounting for\nmagnification) of 10.9 sq. arcmin, which yields 12 galaxies at 8.4 < z < 9.5.\nWithin the Abell-2744 cluster and parallel fields we confirm the three\nbrightest objects reported by Ishigaki et al. (2014), but recover only one of\nthe four z > 8.4 sources reported by Zheng et al. (2014). In the\nMACSJ0416.1-240 cluster field we report five objects, and explain why each of\nthese eluded detection or classification as z ~ 9 galaxies in the published\nsearches of the shallower CLASH data. Finally, we uncover four z ~ 9 galaxies\nfrom the previously unsearched MACSJ0416.1-240 parallel field. Based on the\npublished magnification maps we find that only one of these 12 galaxies is\nlikely boosted by more than a factor of two by gravitational lensing.\nConsequently we are able to perform a fairly straightforward reanalysis of the\nnormalization of the z ~ 9 UV galaxy luminosity function as explored previously\nin the HUDF12 programme. We conclude that the new data strengthen the evidence\nfor a continued smooth decline in UV luminosity density (and hence\nstar-formation rate density) from z ~ 8 to z ~ 9, contrary to recent reports of\na marked drop-off at these redshifts.

We aim to shed light on the mechanism which triggers the X-ray\nactivity for this source. XTE J1946+274 was observed by Chandra-ACIS during\nquiescence in 2013 March 12. In addition, this source has been monitored from\nthe ground-based astronomical observatories of El Teide (Tenerife, Spain),\nRoque de los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain) and Sierra Nevada (Granada, Spain)\nsince 2011 September, and from the TUBITAK National Observatory (Antalya,\nTurkey) since 2005 April. We have performed spectral and photometric temporal\nanalyses in order to investigate the quiescent state and transient behavior of\nthis binary system. In 2006, a long mass ejection event took place from the Be\nstar, lasting for about seven years. We also found that a large Be\ncircumstellar disk was present during quiescence, although major X-ray activity\nwas not observed. We made an attempt to explain this scenario by assuming the\npermanently presence of a tilted and warped Be circumstellar disk. The 0.3-10\nkeV X-ray spectrum during quiescence was well fitted with either an absorbed\nblackbody or absorbed power-law models.

We model the day-scale\nSEDs with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models,\ninvestigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observed\nbroadband SED variability can be associated to variations in the relativistic\nparticle population.\n  Flux variability was remarkable in the X-ray and VHE bands while it was minor\nor not significant in the other bands. The one-zone SSC model can describe\nreasonably well the SED of each day for the 13 consecutive days. This flaring\nactivity is also very well described by a two-zone SSC model, where one zone is\nresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which is\nspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variable\nemission occurring in X-rays and VHE gamma-rays.\n  Both the one-zone SSC and the two-zone SSC models can describe the daily SEDs\nvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesis\nthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particle\npopulation. This shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanism\nproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for the\nbroadband SED variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. The two-zone\nSSC model provides a better agreement to the observed SED at the narrow peaks\nof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although the\nreported one-zone SSC model could be further improved by the variation of the\nparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\\delta$, $B$ and $R$), in\naddition to the parameters related to the particle population. \n\n"}

For this limit, we demonstrate\nthat relativistic reconnection is highly efficient at accelerating particles\nthrough a first-order Fermi process accomplished by the curvature drift of\nparticles along the electric field induced by the relativistic flows. This\nmechanism gives rise to the formation of hard power-law spectra $f \\propto\n(\\gamma-1)^{-p}$ and approaches $p = 1$ for sufficiently large $\\sigma$ and\nsystem size.

It is generally accepted that these jets are powered\nelectromagnetically, by the magnetised rotation of a central compact object.\nHowever, how they produce the observed emission and survive the propagation for\nmany orders of magnitude in distance without being disrupted by current-driven\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities is the subject of active debate. We carry out\ntime-dependent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic,\nPoynting flux dominated jets. The jets are launched self-consistently by the\nrotation of a strongly magnetised central compact object. This determines the\nnatural degree of azimuthal magnetic field winding, a crucial factor that\ncontrols jet stability. We find that the jets are susceptible to two types of\ninstability: (i) a global, external kink mode that grows on long time scales\nand causes the jets to bodily bend sideways. Whereas this mode does not cause\njet disruption over the simulated distances, it substantially reduces jet\npropagation speed. We show, via an analytic model, that the growth of the\nexternal kink mode depends on the slope of the ambient medium density profile.\nIn flat density distributions characteristic of galactic cores, an AGN jet may\nstall, whereas in stellar envelopes the external kink weakens as the jet\npropagates outward; (ii) a local, internal kink mode that grows over short time\nscales and causes small-angle magnetic reconnection and conversion of about\nhalf of jet electromagnetic energy flux into heat.

To better understand this\nphenomenon, we take a first step to building a sample of changing-look quasars\nwith a systematic but simple archival search for these objects in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey Data Release 12.

Since the inflaton quartic coupling is very small, once\nquantum corrections through the gauge and Yukawa interactions are taken into\naccount, the inflaton effective potential most likely becomes unstable. In\norder to avoid this problem, we need to impose stability conditions on the\neffective inflaton potential, which lead to not only non-trivial relations\namongst the particle mass spectrum of the model, but also correlations between\nthe inflationary predictions and the mass spectrum. For concrete discussion, we\ninvestigate the minimal $B-L$ extension of the Standard Model with\nidentification of the $B-L$ Higgs field as inflaton. The stability conditions\nfor the inflaton effective potential fix the mass ratio amongst the $B-L$ gauge\nboson, the right-handed neutrinos and the inflaton.

Our\nsimulations, in contrast, exhibit a stronger relationship, and show that\nprevious work was box-size limited: turbulent `eddies' were artificially\nrestricted by the numerical domain rather than by the scale height.\nZero-net-flux runs without physical diffusion coefficients yield a stress\nproportional to $P^{0.5}$, where P is pressure. The stresses are also\nproportional to the grid length and hence remain numerically unconverged. The\nsame runs with physical diffusivities, however, give a result closer to an\nalpha-disk: the stress is proportional to $P^{0.9}$. Net-flux simulations\nwithout explicit diffusion exhibit stresses proportional to $P^{0.5}$, but\nstronger imposed fields weaken this correlation.

Abstract: Collisions of white dwarfs (WDs) have recently been invoked as a possible\nmechanism for type Ia supernovae (SNIa). A pivotal feature for the viability of\nWD collisions as SNIa progenitors is that a significant fraction of the mass is\nhighly compressed to the densities required for efficient $^{56}$Ni production\nbefore the ignition of the detonation wave. Previous studies have predominantly\nemployed model WDs composed entirely of carbon-oxygen (CO), whereas WDs are\nexpected to have a non-negligible helium envelope. Given that helium is more\nsusceptible to explosive burning than CO under the conditions characteristic of\nWD collision, a legitimate concern is whether or not early time He detonation\nignition can translate to early time CO detonation, thereby drastically\nreducing $^{56}$Ni synthesis. We investigate the role of He in determining the\nfate of WD collisions by performing a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamics\ncalculations. We find that a necessary condition for non-trivial reduction of\nthe CO ignition time is that the He detonation birthed in the contact region\nsuccessfully propagates into the unshocked shell. We determine the minimal He\nshell mass as a function of the total WD mass that upholds this condition.\nAlthough we utilize a simplified reaction network similar to those used in\nprevious studies, our findings are in good agreement with detailed\ninvestigations concerning the impact of network size on He shell detonations.\nThis allows us to extend our results to the case with more realistic burning\nphysics. Based on the comparison of these findings against evolutionary\ncalculations of WD compositions, we conclude that most, if not all, WD\ncollisions will not be drastically impacted by their intrinsic He components. \n\n"}

These are likely due to rapid dissipation of electromagnetic energy in\na highly magnetized, relativistic plasma. In order to understand the generic\nfeatures of such processes, we have investigated simple models based on\nrelaxation of unstable force-free magnetostatic equilibria. In this work, we\nmake the connection between the corresponding plasma dynamics and the expected\nradiation signal, using 2D particle-in-cell simulations that self-consistently\ninclude synchrotron radiation reaction. We focus on the lowest order unstable\nforce-free equilibrium in a 2D periodic box.

Here we present extensive new H.E.S.S. measurements of\nRX$~$J1713.7-3946, almost doubling the observation time compared to our\nprevious publication. Combined with new improved analysis tools, the previous\nsensitivity is more than doubled.

We demonstrate that\nthe dark matter interaction types, and hence the annihilation processes\nrelevant for relic density and indirect detection, are strongly dictated by the\nmass generation mechanism chosen for the dark sector particles, and the\nrequirement of gauge invariance. We focus on the class of models in which\nfermionic dark matter couples to a spin-1 vector or axial-vector mediator.\nHowever, in order to generate dark sector mass terms, it is necessary in most\ncases to introduce a dark Higgs field and thus a spin-0 scalar mediator will\nalso be present. In the case that all the dark sector fields gain masses via\ncoupling to a single dark sector Higgs field, it is mandatory that the\naxial-vector coupling of the spin-1 mediator to the dark matter is non-zero;\nthe vector coupling may also be present depending on the charge assignments.\nFor all other mass generation options, only pure vector couplings between the\nspin-1 mediator and the dark matter are allowed. If these coupling restrictions\nare not obeyed, unphysical results may be obtained such as a violation of\nunitarity at high energies.

Such initial models, however, are difficult to\nconstruct for giant stars because of the wide range in spatial scales of the\nhydrostatic equilibrium and in dynamical timescales between the core and the\nenvelope of the giant. They are needed for, e.g., modeling the common envelope\nphase where a giant envelope encompasses both the giant core and a companion\nstar.

We determine typical stellar\nstratification profiles with the 1D stellar evolution code MESA. After an\nappropriate mapping, hydrodynamical simulations are conducted using the\nmoving-mesh code AREPO. The giant profiles are approximated by replacing the\ncore of the giant with a point mass and by constructing a suitable continuation\nof the profile to the center. Different reconstruction methods are tested that\ncan specifically control the convective behaviour of the model. After mapping\nto a grid, a relaxation procedure that includes damping of spurious velocities\nyields stable models in three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. Initially\nconvectively stable configurations lead to stable hydrodynamical models while\nfor stratifications that are convectively unstable in the stellar evolution\ncode, simulations recover the convective behaviour of the initial model and\nshow large convective plumes with Mach numbers up to 0.8.

Their dispersive arrival times suggest an\nextragalactic origin and imply radio luminosities orders of magnitude larger\nthan any other kind of known short-duration radio transient. Thus far, all FRBs\nhave been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute\nlocalizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host\ngalaxy) have relied on contemporaneous variability of field sources or the\npresence of peculiar field stars or galaxies. These attempts have not resulted\nin an unambiguous association with a host or multi-wavelength counterpart. Here\nwe report the sub-arcsecond localization of FRB 121102, the only known\nrepeating burst source, using high-time-resolution radio interferometric\nobservations that directly image the bursts themselves. Our precise\nlocalization reveals that FRB 121102 originates within 100 mas of a faint 180\nuJy persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with\nnon-thermal emission, and a faint (25th magnitude) optical counterpart. The\nflux density of the persistent radio source varies by tens of percent on day\ntimescales, and very long baseline radio interferometry yields an angular size\nless than 1.7 mas. Our observations are inconsistent with the fast radio burst\nhaving a Galactic origin or its source being located within a prominent\nstar-forming galaxy. Instead, the source appears to be co-located with a\nlow-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a previously unknown type of\nextragalactic source. [Truncated] If other fast radio bursts have similarly\nfaint radio and optical counterparts, our findings imply that direct\nsub-arcsecond localizations of FRBs may be the only way to provide reliable\nassociations. \n\n"}

Recently, several empirical luminosity correlations have been\nstatistically proposed from GRB observations. However, to treat GRB as the\ndistance indicator, there are two key issues: the redshift evolution of\nluminosity correlations and their calibrations. In this paper, we choose the\nAmati relation, the correlation between the peak spectra energy and the\nequivalent isotropic energy of GRBs ($E_{\\rm p}-E_{\\rm iso}$), as an example,\nand find that the current GRB dataset implies that there could be a evolution\nof the luminosity correlation with respect to the redshift. Therefore, we\npropose an extended Amati relation with two extra redshift-dependent terms to\ncorrect the redshift evolution of GRB relation. Secondly, we carefully check\nthe reliability of the calibration method using the low-redshift GRB data.\nImportantly, we find that the low-redshift calibration method does not take\nwhole correlations between $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and coefficients into account.\nNeglecting these correlation information can break the degeneracies and obtain\nthe biased constraint on $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ which is very sensitive to values of\nparameters for the calibration.

In order to create a massive BH seed, the host halo needs to be\nprevented from forming stars. H$_2$ therefore needs to be irradiated by a large\nflux of Lyman-Werner (LW) UV photons in order to suppress H$_2$ cooling. A key\nuncertainty in this scenario is the escape fraction of LW radiation from first\ngalaxies, the dominant source of UV photons at this epoch. To better constrain\nthis escape fraction, we have performed radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of\nthe growth of HII regions and their associated photodissociation regions in the\nfirst galaxies using the ZEUS-MP code. We find that the LW escape fraction\ncrucially depends on the propagation of the ionisation front (I-front).

We undertake a population synthesis study to compute the delay-time\ndistribution of core-collapse supernovae, that is, the supernova rate versus\ntime following a starburst, taking into account binary interactions. We test\nthe systematic robustness of our results by running various simulations to\naccount for the uncertainties in our standard assumptions. We find that a\nsignificant fraction, $15^{+9}_{-8}$%, of core-collapse supernovae are `late',\nthat is, they occur 50-200 Myrs after birth, when all massive single stars have\nalready exploded. These late events originate predominantly from binary systems\nwith at least one, or, in most cases, with both stars initially being of\nintermediate mass ($4-8M_{\\odot}$). The main evolutionary channels that\ncontribute often involve either the merging of the initially more massive\nprimary star with its companion or the engulfment of the remaining core of the\nprimary by the expanding secondary that has accreted mass at an earlier\nevolutionary stage. Also, the total number of core-collapse supernovae\nincreases by $14^{+15}_{-14}$% because of binarity for the same initial stellar\nmass.

Although\neach technique has model-dependent uncertainties, these are the best empirical\ntools currently available and should be vetted in systems where both techniques\ncan be applied. A detailed comparison of the two methods is also useful because\nneither method can be applied to all AGN.

Firstly, we consider BH\npopulations with two different masses in order to learn basic differences from\nmodels with single-mass BHs only. Secondly, we consider continuous BH mass\nfunctions adapted from recent studies on massive star evolution in a low\nmetallicity environment, where globular clusters are formed.

We demonstrate a number of\npractical ways on improving the accuracy of tracing magnetic fields in diffuse\ninterstellar media using velocity centroid gradients (VCGs). Addressing the\nmagnetic field tracing in super-Alfvenic turbulence we introduce the procedure\nof filtering low spatial frequencies, that enables magnetic field tracing in\nthe situations when the kinetic energy of turbulent plasmas dominate its\nmagnetic energy. We propose the synergic way of of using VCGs together with\nintensity gradients (IGs), synchrotron intensity gradients (SIGs) as well as\ndust polarimetry.

We present here 3D numerical simulations of jet propagation in\nmergers' outflows and we calculate the resulting emission. This emission\nconsists of two components: the cooling emission, the leakage of the thermal\nenergy of the hot cocoon, and the cocoon macronova that arises from the\nradioactive decay of the cocoon's material. This emission gives a brief (~ one\nhour) blue, wide angle signal. While the parameters of the outflow and jet are\nuncertain, for the configurations we have considered the signal is bright (~\n-14 $-$ -15 absolute magnitude) and outshines all other predicted UV-optical\nsignals.

As a consequence, most of the formed PBHs\nare rapidly rotating near the extreme value $a_{*}=1$, where $a_{*}$ is the\nnondimensional Kerr parameter at their formation. The smaller the density\nfluctuation $\\sigma_{H}$ at horizon entry is, the stronger the tendency towards\nthe extreme rotation.

Because the Alfv\\'en speed\nvaries with distance from the disk, the AWs undergo partial non-WKB reflection,\nand counter-propagating AWs subsequently interact, causing AW energy to cascade\nto small scales and dissipate. To investigate this process, we introduce an\nElsasser-like formulation of general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) and develop the\ntheory of general relativistic reduced MHD in an inhomogeneous medium. We then\nderive a set of equations for the mean-square AW amplitude $M_+$ and turbulent\nheating rate $Q$ under the assumption that, in the plasma rest frame, AWs\npropagating away from the disk are much more energetic than AWs propagating\ntoward the disk. For the case in which the background flow is axisymmetric and\ntime-independent, we solve these equations analytically to determine $M_+$ and\n$Q$ as functions of position. We find that, for an idealized thin disk threaded\nby a large-scale poloidal magnetic field, the AW energy flux is $\\sim\n(\\rho_{\\rm b}/\\rho_{\\rm d})^{1/2} \\beta_{\\rm net,d}^{-1/2}$ times the disk's\nradiative flux, where $\\rho_{\\rm b}$ and $\\rho_{\\rm d}$ are the mass densities\nat the coronal base and disk midplane, respectively, and $\\beta_{\\rm net,d}$ is\nthe ratio (evaluated at the disk midplane) of plasma-plus-radiation pressure to\nthe pressure of the average vertical magnetic field.

To study the dynamical evolution of the system, we\nsimulate the motions of Proxima and alpha Centauri A and B due to the\nperturbations from the Galactic tide and stellar encounters in a Monte Carlo\nfashion.

A white noise power spectral density (PSD) is expected at low\nfrequency in this model, however, direct observational constraint to the low\nfrequency PSD slope is hard due to limited lengths of the light curves\navailable. Meanwhile, quasars show too large scatter in their DRW parameters to\nbe attributed to the uncertainties in the measurements and the dependence of\nvariation to known physical factors.

Our method is\nparticularly useful for constraining scaling relations between two or more\ngalaxy properties and dark matter halo mass, and can also be used to constrain\nthe intrinsic scatter in these scaling relations. We show that, if\nobservational scatter is not properly accounted for, the traditional stacking\nmethod can produce biased results when exploring correlations between multiple\ngalaxy properties and halo mass.

We have calculated the diffusion based on the observed\ngas density and temperature distributions for 13 early-type galaxies that\nbelonging to the different environments and cover a wide range of X-ray\nluminosities. To estimate the maximum effect of sedimentation and thermal\ndiffusion, we have solved the full set of Burgers' equations for a\nnon-magnetized ISM plasma.

For galaxies with a flat or declining radial temperature profile the\naverage increase of the helium abundance is 60\\% in one billion years of\ndiffusion. The revealed effect can introduce a significant bias in the metal\nabundance measurements based on X-ray spectroscopy and can affect the evolution\nof stars that could be formed from a gas with a high helium abundance. \n\n"}

We find that the\nradial profile of 21-cm differential brightness temperature is quite sensitive\nto the stellar and halo masses, which reflects the time evolution of the escape\nfraction. In the case of a less massive star, ionizing photons hardly escape\nfrom its host halo due to the absorption by dense halo gas, thus an deep 21-cm\nabsorption feature at just outside the halo lasts a long time.

The evolution of the\nmerger rate across redshifts $0 < z \\lesssim 1$ is directly tied to the\nformation and evolutionary processes, providing insight regarding the\nprogenitor formation rate together with the distribution of time delays between\nformation and merger. Because the limiting distance to which BBHs are detected\ndepends on the masses of the binary, the redshift distribution of detected\nbinaries depends on their underlying mass distribution. We therefore consider\nthe mass and redshift distributions simultaneously, and fit the merger rate\ndensity, ${dN}/{dm_1\\,dm_2\\,dz}$. Our constraints on the mass distribution\nagree with previously published results, including evidence for an upper mass\ncutoff at $\\sim 40 \\ M_\\odot$.

A quite natural explanation of this\nissue is given from the angle of higher-curvature gravity, both in four- and in\nfive-dimensional spacetime. The results here obtained reveal that the amplitude\nof the Kalb-Ramond field may be actually large and play a significant role\nduring the early universe, while the presence of higher-order gravity\nsuppresses this field during the cosmological evolution, so that it eventually\nbecomes negligible in the current universe. Besides the suppression of the\nKalb-Ramond field, the extra degree of freedom in $F(R)$ gravity, usually known\nas scalaron, also turns out to be responsible for inflation. Such F(R) gravity\nwith Kalb-Ramond fields may govern the early universe to undergo an\ninflationary stage at early times (with the subsequent graceful exit) for wider\nrange of F(R) gravity than without antisymmetric fields..

Along the way we apply the in-in formalism, the delta N\nformalism, and gauge transformations to compute non-Gaussianities and\nilluminate different aspects of the physical origin of these results. Local\nnon-Gaussianity in the squeezed limit does not weaken the Gaussian conclusion\nthat PBHs as dark matter in canonical single-field inflation require a\ncomplicated and fine-tuned potential shape with an epoch where slow roll is\ntransiently violated. \n\n"}

This is the pulsar in the\noriginal source 3FGL J1417.5-4402, that has undergone a transition from X-ray\nstate to a pulsar state, just like some redbacks did. The system has many\ncharacteristics similar to redback pulsars family, but is on a much wider\norbit.

Understanding the progenitors and the\nmechanism driving SN Ic-bl explosions vs those of their SNe Ic cousins is key\nto understanding the SN-GRB relationship and jet production in massive stars.\nHere we present the largest set of host-galaxy spectra of 28 SNe Ic and 14 SN\nIc-bl, all discovered before 2013 by the same untargeted survey, namely the\nPalomar Transient Factory (PTF). We carefully measure their gas-phase\nmetallicities, stellar masses (M*s) and star-formation rates (SFRs) by taking\ninto account recent progress in the metallicity field and propagating\nuncertainties correctly. We further re-analyze the hosts of 10 literature\nSN-GRBs using the same methods and compare them to our PTF SN hosts with the\ngoal of constraining their progenitors from their local environments by\nconducting a thorough statistical comparison, including upper limits. We find\nthat the metallicities, SFRs and M*s of our PTF SN Ic-bl hosts are\nstatistically comparable to those of SN-GRBs, but significantly lower than\nthose of the PTF SNe Ic. The mass-metallicity relations as defined by the SNe\nIc-bl and SN-GRBs are not significantly different from the same relations as\ndefined by the SDSS galaxies, in contrast to claims by earlier works. Our\nfindings point towards low metallicity as a crucial ingredient for SN Ic-bl and\nSN-GRB production since we are able to break the degeneracy between high SFR\nand low metallicity.

Typically\nhalf of the destroyed star remains bound to the black hole and falls back on\nhighly eccentric orbits, forming an accretion flow which powers a luminous\nflare. In this paper we use analytical and numerical calculations to explore\nthe effect of stellar rotation on the fallback rate of material. We find that\nslowly spinning stars ($\\Omega_* \\lesssim 0.01 \\Omega_{\\rm{breakup}}$) provide\nonly a small perturbation to fallback rates found in the non-spinning case.\nHowever when the star spins faster, there can be significant effects. If the\nstar is spinning retrograde with respect to its orbit the tidal force from the\nblack hole has to spin down the star first before disrupting it, causing\ndelayed and sometimes only partial disruption events. However, if the star is\nspinning prograde this works with the tidal force and the material falls back\nsooner and with a higher peak rate. We examine the power-law index of the\nfallback curves, finding that in all cases the fallback rate overshoots the\ncanonical $t^{-5/3}$ rate briefly after the peak, with the depth of the\novershoot dependent on the stellar spin. We also find that in general the late\ntime evolution is slightly flatter than the canonical $t^{-5/3}$ rate. We\ntherefore conclude that considering the spin of the star may be important in\nmodelling observed TDE lightcurves. \n\n"}

However, spatially correlated sources of\nnoise, such as errors in the planetary ephemeris or clock errors, can produce\nfalse-positive correlations.

We compare mass infall rates of tidal-disruption debris of a non-rotating\nand of a rotating star when they come close to the supermassive black hole.\nRemarkably the mass distribution of debris bound to the black hole as a\nfunction of specific energy shows clear difference between rotating and\nnon-rotating stars, even if the stellar rotation is far from the break-up\nlimit. The debris of a star whose initial spin is parallel to the orbital\nangular momentum has a mass distribution which extends to lower energy than\nthat of non-rotating star. The debris of a star with anti-parallel spin has a\nlarger energy compared with a non-rotating counterpart. As a result, debris\nfrom a star with anti-parallel spin is bound more loosely to the black hole and\nthe mass-infall rate rises later in time, while that of a star with a parallel\nspin is tightly bound and falls back to the black hole earlier. The different\nrising timescales of mass-infall rate may affect the early phase of flares due\nto the tidal disruptions.\n  In the Appendix we study the disruptions by using a uniform-density ellipsoid\nmodel which approximately takes into account the effect of strong gravity of\nthe black hole. We find the mass infall rate reaches its maximum earlier for\nstrong gravity cases because the debris is trapped in a deeper potential well\nof the black hole. \n\n"}

A quantitative analytical theory of\nthis radiation, which we refer to as jitter radiation, is developed. It is\nshown that the emergent spectrum is determined by statistical properties of the\nmagnetic field. As an example,we then use the model of a magnetic field in\ninternal shocks of GRBs. The spectral power distribution of radiation produced\nby the power-law electrons is well described by a sharply broken power-law with\nindices 1 and -(p-1)/2 and the jitter break frequency is independent of the\nfield strength but depends on the electron density in the ejecta. Since\nlarge-scale fields may also be present in the ejecta, we construct a\ntwo-component, jitter+synchrotron spectral model of the prompt $\\gamma$-ray\nemission. Quite surprisingly, this model seems to be readily capable of\nexplaining several properties of time-resolved spectra of some GRBs, such as\n(i) the violation of the constraint on the low-energy spectral index called the\nsynchrotron ``line of death'', (ii) the sharp spectral break at the peak\nfrequency, inconsistent with the broad synchrotron bump, (iii) the evidence for\ntwo spectral sub-components, and (iv) possible existence of emission features\ncalled ``GRB lines''.

The X-ray light curve initially\ndecays very fast, subsequently flattens and eventually steepens again, similar\nto many X-ray afterglows. The first and second phases end about 172 and 1450 s\nafter the burst onset, respectively. We find evidence of spectral evolution\nfrom a softer emission with photon index Gamma ~ 3.0 during the initial steep\ndecay, to a harder emission with Gamma ~ 2.0 during the following evolutionary\nphases. The spectra show intrinsic absorption in the host galaxy. The\nconsistency of the initial photon index with the high energy BAT photon index\nsuggests that the initial phase of the X-ray light curve may be the low-energy\ntail of the prompt emission. The lack of jet break signatures in the X-ray\nafterglow light curve is not consistent with empirical relations between the\nsource rest-frame peak energy and the collimation-corrected energy of the\nburst.

Here, we assess this claim by comparing the cool\ndisc-blackbody model with a range of other models. For example, we show that\nthe same ULX spectra can be fitted equally well by subtracting a disc-blackbody\ncomponent from a dominant power-law component, thus turning a soft excess into\na soft deficit. Then, we propose a more complex physical model, based on a\npower-law component slightly modified at various energies by smeared emission\nand absorption lines from highly-ionized, fast-moving gas. We use the\nXMM-Newton/EPIC spectra of two ULXs in Holmberg II and NGC 4559 as examples.\nOur main conclusion is that the presence of a soft excess or a soft deficit\ndepends on the energy range over which we choose to fit the ``true'' power-law\ncontinuum; those small deviations from the power-law spectrum are well modelled\nby disc-blackbody components (either in emission or absorption) simply because\nthey are a versatile fitting tool for most kinds of smooth, broad bumps. Hence,\nwe argue that those components should not be taken as evidence for accretion\ndisc emission, nor used to infer BH masses. Finally, we speculate that bright\nULXs could be in a spectral state similar to (or an extension of) the\nsteep-power-law state of Galactic BH candidates, in which the disc is now\ncompletely comptonized and not directly detectable, and the power-law emission\nmay be modified by the surrounding, fast-moving, ionized gas. \n\n"}

In particular, the photon pumping scenario has explicit\nexpectations for temporal variation in the strength of the excited lines, owing\nto the decline in the ionizing flux of the GRB afterglow. We analyze afterglow\nspectra of GRB 020813 obtained in two epochs of ~16 hours apart, and examine\ntransitions from the first excited state of Fe^+ at J=7/2 in these two sets of\ndata.

We find that a\nuniform cosmological accretion turns into a rapidly varying disc buildup rate.\nThe generic sequence of events (Shocked-Accretion Massive Burst & Shutdown:\nSAMBA) consists of four distinct phases: a) continuous cold accretion while the\nhalo is below a threshold mass Msh~10^12Mo, b) tentative quenching of gas\nsupply for ~2Gyr, starting once the halo is ~Msh and growing a rapidly\nexpanding shock, c) a massive burst due to the big crunch of ~10^11Mo gas in\n\\~0.5Gyr, when the heated gas cools and joins new infalling gas, and d) a\nlong-term shutdown, enhanced by a temporary shock instability in late SAMBAs,\nthose that quench at z~2, burst at z~1 and end up quenched in 10^12-13Mo haloes\ntoday. These events occur at all redshifts in galaxies of baryonic mass\n\\~10^11Mo and involve a substantial fraction of this mass. They arise from\nrather smooth accretion, or minor mergers, which, unlike major mergers, may\nleave the disc intact while being built in a rapid pace. The early bursts match\nobserved maximum starbursting discs at z>~2, predicted to reside in <~10^13Mo\nhaloes. The late bursts resemble discy LIRGs at z<~1.

First, the expression of the\nactive mass in Schwarzschild's solution is given for a barotropic perfect\nfluid, both for general relativity (GR) and for an alternative, scalar theory.\nThe principle of the asymptotic method is then recalled and the PN expansion of\nthe active mass is derived. The PN correction to the active mass is made of the\nNewtonian elastic energy, augmented, for the scalar theory, by a term due to\nthe self-reinforcement of the gravitational field. Third, two equations, both\ncorrect to first order, are derived for the geodesic motion of a mass particle:\na \"standard\" one and an \"asymptotic\" one. Finally, the difference between the\nsolutions of these two equations is numerically investigated in the case of\nMercury. The asymptotic solution deviates from the standard one like the square\nof the time elapsed since the initial time. This is due to a practical\nshortcoming of the asymptotic method, which is shown to disappear if one\nreinitializes the asymptotic problem often enough.

This formulation includes\nthe dissipative effects of the conductivity in the medium.
