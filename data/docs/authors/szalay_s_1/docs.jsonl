Theor. 43 115303 which covers the cases of the\nsu(1,1) algebra (for x > 0), the su(2) algebra (for x < 0) and the h(4)\nordinary Weyl-Heisenberg algebra (for x = 0). For finite-dimensional\nrepresentations of A(x) and A(x,s), where A(x,s) is a truncation of order s of\nA(x) in the sense of Pegg-Barnett, a connection is established with k-fermionic\nalgebras (or quon algebras). This connection makes it possible to use\ngeneralized Grassmann variables for constructing certain coherent states.\nCoherent states of the Perelomov type are derived for infinite-dimensional\nrepresentations of A(x) and for finite-dimensional representations of A(x) and\nA(x,s) through a Fock-Bargmann analytical approach based on the use of complex\n(or bosonic) variables. The same approach is applied for deriving coherent\nstates of the Barut-Girardello type in the case of infinite-dimensional\nrepresentations of A(x). In contrast, the construction of \\`a la\nBarut-Girardello coherent states for finite-dimensional representations of A(x)\nand A(x,s) can be achieved solely at the price to replace complex variables by\ngeneralized Grassmann (or k-fermionic) variables.

To this end, we\nemploy the example of the Ising chain, displaying an order-disorder quantum\nphase transitions. Employing both analytical and numerical methods, we compute\nentanglement entropies for various system bipartitions (A|B) and consider\nground states with and without Majorana edge states. We find that the thermal\nground states, enjoying the Hamiltonian symmetries, show non-local\nconvertibility if either A or B are smaller than, or of the order of, the\ncorrelation length. In contrast, the ordered (symmetry breaking) ground state\nis always locally convertible. The edge states behavior explains all these\nresults and could disclose a paradigm to understand local convertibility in\nother quantum phases of matter. The connection we establish between\nconvertibility and non-local, quantum correlations provides a clear criterion\nof which features a universal quantum simulator should possess to outperform a\nclassical machine. \n\n"}

They arise as a\nrelativistic analog of the wave functions of quantum mechanics but can be\napplied also in quantum field theory. The evolution of a wave function with N\ntime variables is governed by N Schr\\\"odinger equations, one for each time\nvariable. These Schr\\\"odinger equations can be inconsistent with each other,\ni.e., they can fail to possess a joint solution for every initial condition; in\nfact, the N Hamiltonians need to satisfy a certain commutator condition in\norder to be consistent. While this condition is automatically satisfied for\nnon-interacting particles, it is a challenge to set up consistent multi-time\nequations with interaction.

In particular, we show that for the zero initial potential, a\nnon-conservative transformation is always equivalent to a pair of conservative\ntransformations. These single-channel results are illustrated on the inversion\nof the neutron-proton triplet eigenphase shifts for the S and D waves. We then\nsummarize and extend our previous works on the coupled-channel case and stress\nremaining difficulties and open questions. We mostly concentrate on two-channel\nexamples to illustrate general principles while keeping mathematics as simple\nas possible. In particular, we discuss the difference between the\nequal-threshold and different-threshold problems. For equal thresholds,\nconservative transformations can provide non-diagonal Jost and scattering\nmatrices. Iterations of such transformations are shown to lead to practical\nalgorithms for inversion. A convenient technique where the mixing parameter is\nfitted independently of the eigenphases is developed with iterations of pairs\nof conjugate transformations and applied to the neutron-proton triplet S-D\nscattering matrix, for which exactly-solvable matrix potential models are\nconstructed. For different thresholds, conservative transformations do not seem\nto be able to provide a non-trivial coupling between channels. In contrast, a\nsingle non-conservative transformation can generate coupled-channel potentials\nstarting from the zero potential and is a promising first step towards a full\nsolution to the coupled-channel inverse problem with threshold differences. \n\n"}

A brief derivation of the path integral formulation of\nquantum mechanics in its original form using the orthonormal position and\nmomentum basis is reviewed. For spin systems such as single molecule magnets,\nthe formulation of path integral requires the use of non-orthonormal spin\ncoherent state in $(2s+1)$ dimensional Hilbert space, the coordinate\nindependent and the coordinate dependent form of the spin coherent state path\nintegral is derived. These two forms of spin coherent state path integral are\napplied to the tunneling of single molecule magnets through its magnetic\nanisotropy barrier. Most experimental and numerical results are presented. The\nsuppression of tunneling for half-odd integer spin (spin-parity effect) at zero\nmagnetic field is derived from both forms, which shows that this result\n(spin-parity effect) is independent of the coordinate.

We argue that the\ntheory of operator spaces offers a natural framework for studying to what\nextent extractors are secure against quantum adversaries: we first phrase the\ndefinition of extractors as a bounded norm condition between normed spaces, and\nthen show that the presence of quantum adversaries corresponds to a completely\nbounded norm condition between operator spaces. From this we show that very\nhigh min-entropy extractors as well as extractors with small output are always\n(approximately) quantum-proof. We also study a generalization of extractors\ncalled randomness condensers. We phrase the definition of condensers as a\nbounded norm condition and the definition of quantum-proof condensers as a\ncompletely bounded norm condition. Seeing condensers as bipartite graphs, we\nthen find that the bounded norm condition corresponds to an instance of a well\nstudied combinatorial problem, called bipartite densest subgraph. Furthermore,\nusing the characterization in terms of operator spaces, we can associate to any\ncondenser a Bell inequality (two-player game) such that classical and quantum\nstrategies are in one-to-one correspondence with classical and quantum attacks\non the condenser. Hence, we get for every quantum-proof condenser (which\nincludes in particular quantum-proof extractors) a Bell inequality that can not\nbe violated by quantum mechanics. \n\n"}

Since the structure of\npartial separability and multipartite entanglement is getting complicated if\nthe number of subsystems exceeds two, one can not expect the existence of an\nultimate scalar entanglement measure, which grasps even a small part of the\nrich hierarchical structure of multipartite entanglement, and some higher order\nstructure characterizing that is needed. In this paper we make some steps\ntowards this direction.\n  First, we reveal the lattice-theoretic structure of the partial separability\nclassification, introduced earlier [Sz. Szalay and Z. Kokenyesi, Phys. Rev. A\n86, 032341 (2012)]. It turns out that, mathematically, the structure of the\nentanglement classes is the up-set lattice of the structure of the different\nkinds of partial separability, which is the down-set lattice of the lattice of\nthe partitions of the subsystems. It turns also out that, physically, this\nstructure is related to the LOCC convertibility: If a state from a class can be\nmapped into another one, then that class can be found higher in the hierarchy.\n  Second, we introduce the notion of multipartite monotonicity, expressing that\na given set of entanglement monotones, while measuring the different kinds of\nentanglement, shows also the same hierarchical structure as the entanglement\nclasses. Then we construct such hierarchies of entanglement measures, and\npropose a physically well-motivated one, being the direct multipartite\ngeneralization of the entanglement of formation based on the entanglement\nentropy, motivated by the notion of statistical distinguishability. The\nmultipartite monotonicity shown by this set of measures motivates us to\nconsider the measures to be the different manifestations of some \"unified\"\nnotion of entanglement. \n\n"}

A finite quantum system, induced\nby a transition operator, makes transitions from its states to the states of\nthe same system or to those of another system.

Towards developing a complete statistical theory for\ntransition strength densities, we have derived formulas for lower order\nbivariate moments of the strength densities generated by a variety of\ntransition operators. For a spinless fermion system, using EGUE($k$)\nrepresentation for Hamiltonian and an independent EGUE($t$) representation for\ntransition operator, finite-$N$ formulas for moments up to order four are\nderived, for the first time, for the transition strength densities.

Abstract: It is straightforward to give a sum-over-paths expression for the transition\namplitudes of a quantum circuit as long as the gates in the circuit are\nbalanced, where to be balanced is to have all nonzero transition amplitudes of\nequal magnitude. Here we consider the question of whether, for such circuits,\nthe relative phases of different discrete-time paths through the configuration\nspace can be defined in terms of a classical action, as they are for\ncontinuous-time paths. We show how to do so for certain kinds of quantum\ncircuits, namely, Clifford circuits where the elementary systems are\ncontinuous-variable systems or discrete systems of odd-prime dimension. These\ntypes of circuit are distinguished by having phase-space representations that\nserve to define their classical counterparts. For discrete systems, the\nphase-space coordinates are also discrete variables. We show that for each gate\nin the generating set, one can associate a symplectomorphism on the phase-space\nand to each of these one can associate a generating function, defined on two\ncopies of the configuration space. For discrete systems, the latter association\nis achieved using tools from algebraic geometry. Finally, we show that if the\naction functional for a discrete-time path through a sequence of gates is\ndefined using the sum of the corresponding generating functions, then it yields\nthe correct relative phases for the path-sum expression. These results are\nlikely to be relevant for quantizing physical theories where time is\nfundamentally discrete, characterizing the classical limit of discrete-time\nquantum dynamics, and proving complexity results for quantum circuits. \n\n"}

In our model the two-atom system is envisaged as an open\nsystem coupled with a massless scalar field prepared in one of the physical\nvacuum states of interest. We employ the quantum master equation in the\nBorn-Markov approximation in order to describe the time evolution of the atomic\nsubsystem. We investigate two different states of motion for the atoms, namely\nstatic atoms and also stationary atoms with zero angular momentum. The purpose\nof this work is to expound the impact on the creation of entanglement coming\nfrom the combined action of the different physical processes underlying the\nHawking effect and the Unruh-Starobinskii effect. We demonstrate that, in the\nscenario of rotating black holes, the degree of quantum entanglement is\nsignificantly modified due to the phenomenon of superradiance in comparison\nwith the analogous cases in a Schwarzschild spacetime. In the perspective of a\nzero angular momentum observer (ZAMO), one is allowed to probe entanglement\ndynamics inside the ergosphere, since static observers cannot exist within such\na region. On the other hand, the presence of superradiant modes could be a\nsource for violation of complete positivity. This is verified when the quantum\nfield is prepared in the Frolov-Thorne vacuum state. In this exceptional\nsituation, we raise the possibility that the loss of complete positivity is due\nto the breakdown of the Markovian approximation, which means that any arbitrary\nphysically admissible initial state of the two atoms would not be capable to\nhold, with time evolution, its interpretation as a physical state inasmuch as\nnegative probabilities are generated by the dynamical map. \n\n"}

At its heart\nis the statement that the space of operators that commute with the tensor\npowers of all unitaries is spanned by the permutations of the tensor factors.\nIn this work, we describe a similar duality theory for tensor powers of\nClifford unitaries. The Clifford group is a central object in many subfields of\nquantum information, most prominently in the theory of fault-tolerance. The\nduality theory has a simple and clean description in terms of finite\ngeometries. We demonstrate its effectiveness in several applications:\n  (1) We resolve an open problem in quantum property testing by showing that\n\"stabilizerness\" is efficiently testable: There is a protocol that, given\naccess to six copies of an unknown state, can determine whether it is a\nstabilizer state, or whether it is far away from the set of stabilizer states.\nWe give a related membership test for the Clifford group.\n  (2) We find that tensor powers of stabilizer states have an increased\nsymmetry group. We provide corresponding de Finetti theorems, showing that the\nreductions of arbitrary states with this symmetry are well-approximated by\nmixtures of stabilizer tensor powers (in some cases, exponentially well).\n  (3) We show that the distance of a pure state to the set of stabilizers can\nbe lower-bounded in terms of the sum-negativity of its Wigner function.

However, the behavior of\nOTOCs of local operators in generic chaotic local Hamiltonians remains poorly\nunderstood, with some semiclassical and large N models exhibiting exponential\ngrowth of OTOCs and a sharp chaos wavefront and other random circuit models\nshowing a diffusively broadened wavefront.

The action is proportional to the four\ndimensional non-commutative curvature scalar (which is torsion dependent) that\nis sourced by the Nambu-Goto world-sheet action for a string, plus the\nKalb-Ramond string action. This `quantum gravity' is actually a non-commutative\n{\\it classical} matrix dynamics, and the only two fundamental constants in the\ntheory are the square of Planck length and the speed of light. By treating the\nentity described by this action as a microstate, one constructs the statistical\nthermodynamics of a large number of such microstates, in the spirit of trace\ndynamics.

In near-critical quantum circuits, entropy flows as a locally\nconserved quantum current, obeying circuit laws analogous to the electric\ncircuit laws.

The constructions\nof [1] make heavy use of the notion of semiclassical states for QGR. In the\npresent paper, we employ the complexifier coherent states for QGR recently\nproposed by Thiemann and Winkler as semiclassical states, and thus fill the\ngeneral formulas obtained in [1] with life. We demonstrate how one can, under\nsome simplifying assumptions, explicitely compute expectation values of the\noperators relevant for the gravity-matter Hamiltonians of [1] in the\ncomplexifier coherent states. These expectation values give rise to effective\nmatter Hamiltonians on the background on which the gravitational coherent state\nis peaked and thus induce approximate notions of n-particle states and matter\npropagation on fluctuating spacetimes. We display the details for the scalar\nand the electromagnetic field. The effective theories exhibit two types of\ncorrections as compared to the the ordinary QFT on CST. The first is due to the\nquantum fluctuations of the gravitational field, the second arises from the\nfact that background independence forces both geometry and matter to propagate\non a spacetime that is the product of the real line and a (random) graph.\nFinally we obtain explicit numerical predictions for non-standard dispersion\nrelations for the scalar and the electromagnetic field.

In this\npaper we build a framework for probabilistic theories with non-fixed causal\nstructure. This combines the radical elements of general relativity and quantum\ntheory. The key idea in the construction is physical compression. A physical\ntheory relates quantities. Thus, if we specify a sufficiently large set of\nquantities (this is the compressed set), we can calculate all the others. We\napply three levels of physical compression. First, we apply it locally to\nquantities (actually probabilities) that might be measured in a particular\nregion of spacetime. Then we consider composite regions. We find that there is\na second level of physical compression for the composite region over and above\nthe first level physical compression for the component regions. Each\napplication of first and second level physical compression is quantified by a\nmatrix. We find that these matrices themselves are related by the physical\ntheory and can therefore be subject to compression. This is the third level of\nphysical compression.

The problem is that the angle is a multivalued or\ndiscontinuous variable on the corresponding phase space. The remedy is to\nreplace phi by the smooth periodic functions cos phi and sin phi. In the case\nof the canonical pair (phi,l),l: orbital angular momentum (OAM), the phase\nspace S_(phi,l) ={phi in R mod 2pi, l in R} has the global structure S^1 x R of\na cylinder on which the Poisson brackets of the 3 functions cos phi, sin phi\nand l obey the Lie algebra of the euclidean group E(2) in the plane. This\nproperty provides the basis for the quantization of the system in terms of\nirreducible unitary representations of the group E(2) or of its covering\ngroups. A crucial point is that - due to the fact that the subgroup SO(2) = S^1\nis multiply connected - these representations allow for fractional OAM l = n +\nc, c in [0,1).

Our elementary start-point is to introduce the perturbing parameter as\nlate as possible. Our main skills are Hamiltonian redivision so as to overcome\na flaw of the usual perturbation theory, and the perturbing Hamiltonian matrix\nproduct decomposition in order to separate the contraction and anti-contraction\nterms. Our calculational technology is the limit process for eliminating\napparent divergences. Our central idea is ``dynamical rearrangement and\nsummation\" for the sake of the partial contributions from the high order even\nall order approximations absorbed in our perturbed solution. Consequently, we\nobtain the improved forms of the zeroth, first, second and third order\nperturbed solutions absorbing the partial contributions from the high order\neven all order approximations of perturbation. Then we deduce the improved\ntransition probability. In special, we propose the revised Fermi's golden rule.\nMoreover, we apply our scheme to obtain the improved forms of perturbed energy\nand perturbed state. In addition, we study an easy understanding example of\ntwo-state system to illustrate our scheme and show its advantages. All of this\nimplies the physical reasons and evidences why our improved scheme of\nperturbation theory are actually calculable, operationally efficient,\nconclusively more accurate. Our improved scheme is the further development and\ninteresting application of our exact solution, and it has been successfully\nused to study on open system dynamics [An Min Wang, quant-ph/0601051]. \n\n"}

Firstly, we express the normalized\nvolume elements of the Bures (minimal monotone) metric for n = 2 and 3,\nobtaining thereby \"Bures prior probability distributions\" over the two- and\nthree-state systems. Then, as an essential first step in extending these\nresults to n > 3, we determine that the \"Hall normalization constant\" (C_{n})\nfor the marginal Bures prior probability distribution over the\n(n-1)-dimensional simplex of the n eigenvalues of the n x n density matrices\nis, for n = 4, equal to 71680/pi^2. Since we also find that C_{3} = 35/pi, it\nfollows that C_{4} is simply equal to 2^{11} C_{3}/pi. (C_{2} itself is known\nto equal 2/pi.) The constant C_{5} is also found. It too is associated with a\nremarkably simple decompositon, involving the product of the eight consecutive\nprime numbers from 2 to 23.\n  We also preliminarily investigate several cases, n > 5, with the use of\nquasi-Monte Carlo integration. We hope that the various analyses reported will\nprove useful in deriving a general formula (which evidence suggests will\ninvolve the Bernoulli numbers) for the Hall normalization constant for\narbitrary n.

Continuing this work, we obtain exact\nBures probabilities that the members of certain low-dimensional subsets of the\nfifteen-dimensional convex set of 4 x 4 density matrices are separable or\nclassically correlated. The main analytical tools employed are symbolic\nintegration and a formula of Dittmann (quant-ph/9908044) for Bures metric\ntensors. This study complements an earlier one (quant-ph/9810026) in which\nnumerical (randomization) --- but not integration --- methods were used to\nestimate Bures separability probabilities for unrestricted 4 x 4 or 6 x 6\ndensity matrices. The exact values adduced here for pairs of quantum bits\n(qubits), typically, well exceed the estimate (.1) there, but this disparity\nmay be attributable to our focus on special low-dimensional subsets.
