Abstract: Abreg: By combining HST/UDF imagery with kinematics from VLT/GIRAFFE we\nderive a physical model of distant galaxy J033245.11-274724.0 in a way similar\nto what can be done in the nearby Universe. Here we study the properties of a\ndistant compact LIRGs galaxy. Given the photometric and spectro photometric\naccuracies, we can decompose the galaxy in sub components and correct them for\nreddening. The galaxy is dominated by a dust enshrouded disk revealed by UDF\nimagery. The disk radius is half that of the Milky Way and the galaxy have a\nSFR=20Mo/yr. Morphology and kinematics show that gas and stars together spiral\ninwards rapidly to feed the disk and the central regions. A combined system of\na bar and two non rotating spiral arms regulates the material accretion,\ninduces large sigma, with sigma larger than 100 km/s and redistributes the\nangular momentum (AM). The detailed physical properties resemble to the\nexpectations from modeling a merger of two equal mass, gaseous rich galaxies,\n0.5 Gyr after the merger. In its later evolution, this galaxy could become a\nlate type galaxy which falls on the T-F relation, with an AM mostly induced by\nthe orbital AM of the merger. \n\n"}

This interpretation is supported by the Butcher-Oemler effect.\n  We investigate E+A galaxies as an intermediate state between late-type\ngalaxies in low density environments and early-type galaxies in high density\nenvironment to constrain the possible transformation processes. For this\npurpose we model a grid of post-starburst galaxies by inducing a burst and/or a\nhalting of star formation on the normal evolution of spiral galaxies with our\ngalaxy evolution code GALEV.\n  From our models we find that the common E+A criteria exclude a significant\nnumber of post-starburst galaxies and propose that comparing their spectral\nenergy distributions leads to a more sufficient method to investigate\npost-starbust galaxies. We predict that a higher number of E+A galaxies in the\nearly universe can not be ascribed solely to a higher number of starburst, but\nis a result of a lower metallicity and a higher burst strength due to more gas\ncontent of the galaxies in the early universe.

GCs beginning their\nformation have an initial metallicity determined by the pre-enrichment of their\nsurrounding protocloud, but can also undergo internal self-enrichment during\nformation. Stochastic variations in metallicity arise because of the finite\nnumbers of supernova. We construct an analytic formulation of the combined\neffects of pre-enrichment and self-enrichment and use Monte Carlo models to\nverify that the model accurately encapsulates the mean metallicity and\nmetallicity spread among real GCs. The predicted metallicity spread due to\nself-enrichment alone, a robust prediction of the model, is much smaller than\nthe observed spread among real GCs. This result rules out self-enrichment as a\nsignificant contributor to the metal content in most GCs, leaving\npre-enrichment as the viable alternative. Self-enrichment can, however, be\nimportant for clusters with masses well above 10^6 Msun, which are massive\nenough to hold in a significant fraction of their SN ejecta even without any\nexternal pressure confinement. This transition point corresponds well to the\nmass at which a mass-metallicity relationship (\"blue tilt\") appears in the\nmetal-poor cluster sequence in many large galaxies. We therefore suggest that\nself-enrichment is the primary driver for the mass-metallicity relation.

We show that L_def\ncorrelates with the velocity dispersion sigma of the host galaxy bulge averaged\noutside the central region that may be affected by a supermassive black hole\n(BH). We confirm that L_def correlates with BH mass MBH. Also, the fractional\nlight deficit L_def/L correlates with MBH/M, the ratio of BH mass to the galaxy\nstellar mass. All three correlations have scatter similar to or smaller than\nthe scatter in the well known correlation between MBH and sigma. The new\ncorrelations are remarkable in view of the dichotomy between ellipticals with\ncores and those with central extra light. Core light deficit correlates closely\nwith MBH and sigma, but extra light does not. This supports the suggestion that\nextra light Es are made in wet mergers with starbursts whereas core Es are made\nin dry mergers.

In all other cases the growth of thermal perturbations is\nsuppressed by a combination of buoyancy and thermal conduction.

We calculate the accretion luminosity of a system based on the\naccretion-rate which is assumed to be equal to the mass-supply rate at the\nradius of ~10^-2 pc. For the models with high temperature gas at large radii\n(~10 pc) and high luminosities, we find a strong correlation between the\nmass-outflow rate (Mdot_out) and the luminosity (L). The power law index (q)\ndescribing the Mdot_out-L relation is q=2.0(+/-0.1), which is very similar to\nthat for radiation-driven stellar and disc wind models. More surprisingly, for\nhigh density at large radii, we find steady state solutions with the accretion\nluminosity exceeding the Eddington limit. The super-Eddington accretion\nproceeds in the equatorial region and is possible because the radiation flux\nfrom the disc is significantly reduced in the equatorial direction due to the\ngeometrical foreshortening effect. In all models, an outflow is driven from an\ninflow with sub-Keplerian rotation. For high temperature at large radii, the\ninflow occurs over a wide range of the polar angles, and the outflow occurs in\na relatively narrow polar cone. However, for the super-Eddington cases with low\ntemperature at large radii, the inflow persists only very close to the\nequatorial plane, resembling a thin accretion disc, while the outflow arises in\na wide range of radii and polar angles. The geometry of this extreme\ninflow-outflow solution is very similar to a radiation-driven wind from a\nluminous Keplerian accretion disc. \n\n"}

We find that closed-box models in which H_2 is not replenished by HI\nrequire improbably large increases in rho(H_2) and a decrease in the MGDR with\nlookback time that is inconsistent with observations. Allowing the H_2 used in\nstar formation to be replenished by HI does not alleviate the problem because\nobservations show that there is very little evolution of rho(HI) from z = 0 to\nz = 4. We show that to be consistent with observational constraints, star\nformation on cosmic timescales must be fueled by intergalactic ionized gas,\nwhich may come from either accretion of gas through cold (but ionized) flows or\nfrom ionized gas associated with accretion of dark matter halos. We constrain\nthe rate at which the extraglactic ionized gas must be converted into HI and\nultimately into H_2. The ionized gas inflow rate roughly traces the SFRD: about\n1 - 2 x 10^8 M_sun Gyr^-1 Mpc^-3 from z ~ 1 - 4, decreasing by about an order\nof magnitude from z=1 to z=0 with details depending largely on MGDR(t). All\nmodels considered require the volume averaged density of rho(H_2) to increase\nby a factor of 1.5 - 10 to z ~ 1.5 over the currently measured value. Because\nthe molecular gas must reside in galaxies, it implies that galaxies at high z\nmust, on average, be more molecule rich than they are at the present epoch,\nwhich is consistent with observations.

By examining the dynamical state of molecular clouds, it is\npossible to assess the primary candidates for how the turbulent energy is\ninjected. The aim of this paper is to constrain the scales at which turbulence\nis driven in the molecular interstellar medium, by comparing simulated\nmolecular spectral line observations of numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nmodels and molecular spectral line observations of real molecular clouds.

The\nsimulations produced a cosmic star formation history (SFH) that is broadly\nconsistent with observations until z $\\sim$ 0.5, and a steady evolution of the\nuniversal neutral hydrogen fraction ($\\Omega_{\\rm H I}$). At z=0, about 40% of\nthe baryons are in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), but most metals\n(80%-90%) are locked in stars. At higher z the proportion of metals in the IGM\nis higher due to more efficient loss from galaxies. The IGM metals primarily\nreside in the WHIM throughout cosmic history. The metallicity evolution of the\ngas inside galaxies is broadly consistent with observations, but the diffuse\nIGM is under enriched at z $\\sim$ 2.5.

We explain the origin of these wide binaries by\nformation during the dissolution phase of young star clusters: an initially\nunbound pair of stars may form a binary when their distance in phase-space is\nsmall. Using N-body simulations, we find that the resulting wide binary\nfraction in the semi-major axis range 1000 au - 0.1 pc for individual clusters\nis 1-30%, depending on the initial conditions. The existence of numerous wide\nbinaries in the field is consistent with observational evidence that most\nclusters start out with a large degree of substructure.

We find that the true lifetime of the\ncloud (defined as when all of the material from the core of the cloud is well\nmixed with the intercloud material in the hydrodynamic cells) is about 6 times\nt_KHD, where t_KHD is the growth timescale for the most disruptive,\nlong-wavelength, KH instabilities. These findings have wide implications for\ndiffuse sources where there is transfer of material between hot and cool\nphases.\n  The properties of the interaction as a function of Mach number and cloud\ndensity contrast are also studied. The interaction is milder at lower Mach\nnumbers with the most marked differences occuring at low shock Mach numbers\nwhen the postshock gas is subsonic with respect to the cloud (i.e. M < 2.76).\nMaterial stripped off the cloud only forms a long \"tail-like\" feature if the\ndensity contrast of the cloud to the ambient medium, chi > 1e3. \n\n"}

With sensitive, multicolor Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we\ncharacterize the large population of <10 Myr old star clusters that suffuse the\nsystem. From the colors and luminosities of the young star clusters, we find\nthat the galaxies in HCG 31 follow the same universal scaling relations as\nactively star-forming galaxies in the local Universe despite the unusual\ncompact group environment. Furthermore, the specific frequency of the globular\ncluster system is consistent with the low end of galaxies of comparable masses\nlocally. This, combined with the large mass of neutral hydrogen and tight\nconstraints on the amount of intragroup light, indicate that the group is\nundergoing its first epoch of interaction-induced star formation. In both the\nmain galaxies and the tidal-dwarf candidate, F, stellar complexes, which are\nsensitive to the magnitude of disk turbulence, have both sizes and masses more\ncharacteristic of z=1-2 galaxies. After subtracting the light from compact\nsources, we find no evidence for an underlying old stellar population in F --\nit appears to be a truly new structure. The low velocity dispersion of the\nsystem components, available reservoir of HI, and current star formation rate\nof ~10 solar masses per year, indicate that HCG31 is likely to both exhaust its\ncold gas supply and merge within ~1 Gyr.

However, we know very little about the\nsecular processes associated with disk evolution. One major uncertainty is the\nextent to which stars migrate radially through the disk, thereby washing out\nsignatures of their past (e.g. birth sites). Recent theoretical work finds that\nsuch \"blurring\" of the disk can be important if spiral arms are transient\nphenomena. Here we describe an experiment to determine the importance of\ndiffusion from the Solar circle with cosmic time. Consider a star cluster that\nhas been placed into a differentially rotating, stellar fluid. We show that all\nclusters up to ~10^4 solar masses, and a significant fraction of those up to\n~10^5 solar masses, are expected to be chemically homogeneous, and that\nclusters of this size can be assigned a unique \"chemical tag\" by measuring the\nabundances of <~10 independent element groups, with better age and orbit\ndeterminations allowing fewer abundance measurements. The star cluster\ntherefore acts like a \"tracer dye\", and the present-day distribution of its\nstars provides a strong constraint on the rate of radial diffusion or migration\nin the Galactic disk.

First, we model\nthe observations with a dusty wind-blown bubble, and then ask whether dust\ncould survive within N49 to its present age (estimated to be 5x10^5 to 10^6\nyears). We find that dust sputtering and especially dust-gas friction would\nimply relatively short timescales (t ~ 10^4 years) for dust survival in the\nwind-shocked region of the bubble. To explain the 24 micron emission, we\npostulate that the grains are replenished within the wind-blown bubble by\ndestruction of embedded, dense cloudlets of ISM gas that have been over-run by\nthe expanding wind-blown bubble. We calculate the ablation timescales for\ncloudlets within N49 and find approximate parameters for the embedded cloudlets\nthat can replenish the dust; the parameters for the cloudlets are roughly\nsimilar to those observed in other nebula. Such dust will have an important\neffect on the bubble: including simple dust cooling in a wind-blown bubble\nmodel for N49, we find that the luminosity is higher by approximately a factor\nof six at a bubble age of about 10^4 years. At ages of 10^7 years, the energy\ncontained in the bubble is lower by about a factor of eight if dust is\nincluded; if dust must be replenished within the bubble, the associated\naccompanying gas mass will also be very important to wind-blown bubble cooling\nand evolution.

Its brightness profile is a Sersic\nfunction with index n = 1.55 +- 0.07 along the major axis and 1.33 +- 0.12\nalong the minor axis. Therefore it is a pseudobulge. It is much less luminous\nthan the boxy bar, so the true pseudobulge-to-total luminosity ratio of the\ngalaxy is PB/T = 0.06 +- 0.01, much less than the previously believed value of\nB/T = 0.4 for the boxy bulge.

We combine our PDF with a model for Galactic and\nextra-Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission to obtain an estimator and projected\nerror on dark matter particle properties (mass and annihilation cross section)\nusing the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. We compare the estimator obtained\nfrom the true PDF to that obtained from the simpler Poisson analysis. We find\nthat, although both estimators are unbaised in the presence of backgrounds, the\nerror on dark matter properties derived from the true PDF is ~50% smaller than\nwhen utilizing the Poisson-based analysis. \n\n"}

In this model optical\nhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circular\nvelocity, at higher redshifts. This model also predicts that the scaling\nrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than the\ncorresponding stellar relations.

The nature of this offset is consistent with\nsuggestions that low metallicity environments may be required to produce high\nmass progenitors, although the detection of several GRBs in high-mass,\nhigh-metallicity galaxies challenges the notion of a strict metallicity cut-off\nfor host galaxies that are capable of producing GRBs. We show that the nature\nof this reported offset may be explained by a recently proposed\nanti-correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the metallicity of\nstar forming galaxies. If low metallicity galaxies produce more stars than\ntheir equally massive, high-metallicity counterparts, then transient events\nthat closely trace the SFR in a galaxy would be more likely to be found in\nthese low metallicity, low mass galaxies. Therefore, the offset between the GRB\nand SDSS defined M-Z relations may be the result of the different methods used\nto select their respective galaxy populations, with GRBs being biased towards\nlow metallicity, high SFR, galaxies. We predict that such an offset should not\nbe expected of transient events that do not closely follow the star formation\nhistory of their host galaxies, such as short duration GRBs and SN Ia, but\nshould be evident in core collapse SNe found through upcoming untargeted\nsurveys. \n\n"}

We use the\npublished catalog of abundance measurements from the previous paper in this\nseries. The measurements are based on spectral synthesis of iron absorption\nlines. For each MDF, we determine maximum likelihood fits for Leaky Box,\nPre-Enriched, and Extra Gas (wherein the gas supply available for star\nformation increases before it decreases to zero) analytic models of chemical\nevolution. Although the models are too simplistic to describe any MDF in\ndetail, a Leaky Box starting from zero metallicity gas fits none of the\ngalaxies except Canes Venatici I well. The MDFs of some galaxies, particularly\nthe more luminous ones, strongly prefer the Extra Gas Model to the other\nmodels.

This is the largest dataset ever used for such an analysis\nand it allows us to explore the outskirts of massive red galaxies at\nunprecedented physical scales.

At larger radii the profiles deviate from\nthe best-fit Sersic models and exhibit extra light in the g, r, i and z-band\nstacks. This excess light can probably be attributed to unresolved intragroup\nor intracluster light or a change in the light profile itself.

Abstract: To gain new insights into the radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy reported for\nactive galactic nuclei, we examine radio loudness as a function of Eddington\nratio for a previously published sample of 199 AGN from five different\npopulations. After initially considering radio loudnesses derived using total\nradio luminosities, we repeat the investigation using core radio luminosities\nonly, applying a previously established mass correction for these core\nluminosities. In both cases, for Eddington ratios < 1 per cent, Fanaroff-Riley\ntype I and broad-line radio galaxies are on average more radio-loud than\nSeyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. However, the\ndistribution of radio loudnesses for the mass-corrected, core-only sample is\nmuch narrower than that of the clearly bimodal total radio loudness\ndistribution. The advantages and disadvantages of using core- or lobe-dominated\nradio luminosity as a measure of instantaneous jet power are discussed. We\nfurthermore compare the core and total radio luminosities for the entire\nsample, as well as illustrating the importance of the mass term by comparing\nthe AGN with a sample of black hole X-ray binaries.

The\nvelocity distribution is mostly sensitive to the relative spiral arm phase and\npattern speed. In all cases the arms induce strong kinematic imprints for\npattern speeds around 17 km/s/kpc (close to the 4:1 inner resonance) but no\nsubstructure is induced close to corotation.

In particular, we determine\nline-of-sight-averaged [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] in the metal-poor main-sequence\nturnoff (MPMSTO) population along every Sloan Extension for Galactic\nUnderstanding and Exploration (SEGUE) spectroscopic line of sight. Restricting\nour sample to those lines of sight along which we do not detect elements of\ncold halo substructure (ECHOS), we compile the largest spectroscopic sample of\nstars in the smooth component of the halo ever observed in situ beyond 10 kpc.\nWe find significant spatial autocorrelation in [Fe/H] in the MPMSTO population\nin the distant half of our sample beyond about 15 kpc from the Galactic center.\nInside of 15 kpc however, we find no significant spatial autocorrelation in\n[Fe/H]. At the same time, we perform SEGUE-like observations of N-body\nsimulations of Milky Way analog formation.

We find that all\ncomponents exhibit nearly isothermal kinematics in |z|, and a slow outward\ndecrease of the vertical velocity dispersion: \\sigma_z (z,R|[\\alpha/Fe],[Fe/H])\n~ \\sigma_z ([\\alpha/Fe],[Fe/H]) x \\exp (-(R-R_0)/7 kpc}). The characteristic\nvelocity dispersions of these components vary from ~ 15 km/s for chemically\nyoung, metal-rich stars, to >~ 50 km/s for metal poor stars. The mean \\sigma_z\ngradient away from the mid plane is only 0.3 +/- 0.2 km/s/kpc. We find a\ncontinuum of vertical kinetic temperatures (~\\sigma^2_z) as function of\n([\\alpha/Fe],[Fe/H]), which contribute to the stellar surface mass density as\n\\Sigma_{R_0}(\\sigma^2_z) ~ \\exp(-\\sigma^2_z). The existence of isothermal\nmono-abundance populations with intermediate dispersions reject the notion of a\nthin-thick disk dichotomy. This continuum of disks argues against models where\nthe thicker disk portions arise from massive satellite infall or heating;\nscenarios where either the oldest disk portion was born hot, or where internal\nevolution plays a major role, seem the most viable. The wide range of \\sigma_z\n([\\alpha/Fe],[Fe/H]) combined with a constant \\sigma_z(z) for each abundance\nbin provides an independent check on the precision of the SEGUE abundances:\n\\delta_[\\alpha/Fe] ~ 0.07 dex and \\delta_[Fe/H] ~ 0.15 dex. The radial decline\nof the vertical dispersion presumably reflects the decrease in disk\nsurface-mass density.

For each cloud, we\nestimate the shear parameter which describes the ability of density\nperturbations to grow within the cloud. We find that for almost all molecular\nclouds considered, there is no evidence that shear is playing a significant\nrole in opposing the effects of self-gravity.

We argue that the main cause of the catastrophic cooling is a\nmismatch between the mass of the gas in which the energy is injected and the\nmass of the parent stellar population. Because too much mass is heated, the\ntemperatures are too low and the cooling times too short. We use analytic\narguments to estimate, as a function of the gas density and the numerical\nresolution, the minimum heating temperature that is required for the injected\nthermal energy to be efficiently converted into kinetic energy. We then propose\nand test a stochastic implementation of thermal feedback that uses this minimum\ntemperature increase as an input parameter and that can be employed in both\nparticle- and grid-based codes. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamics\nsimulations to test the method on models of isolated disc galaxies in dark\nmatter haloes with total mass 10^10 and 10^12 h^-1 solar masses. The thermal\nfeedback strongly suppresses the star formation rate and can drive massive,\nlarge-scale outflows without the need to turn off radiative cooling\ntemporarily. In accord with expectations derived from analytic arguments, for\nsufficiently high resolution the results become insensitive to the imposed\ntemperature jump and also agree with high-resolution simulations employing\nkinetic feedback. \n\n"}

Our\nmodels are directly applicable to semi-analytic models (SAMs) of galaxy\nformation. We have previously argued that filaments of cold (~10^4 K) gas\ncondense out of the intracluster medium (ICM) in hydrostatic and thermal\nequilibrium when the ratio of the thermal instability timescale to the\nfree-fall time $t_{TI}/t_{ff}$ falls below 5-10. This criterion corresponds to\nan upper limit on the density of the ICM and motivates a model in which a\ndensity core forms wherever $t_{TI}/t_{ff} \\lesssim 10$. Consistent with\nobservations and numerical simulations, this model predicts larger and more\ntenuous cores for lower-mass halos---while the core density in a cluster may be\nas large as ~ 0.1 cm^{-3}, the core density in the Galactic halo should not\nexceed ~ 10^{-4} cm^{-3}. We can also explain the large densities in smaller\nmass halos (galactic `coronae') if we include the contribution of the central\ngalaxy to the gravitational potential. Our models produce a favorable match to\nthe observational X-ray luminosity-temperature (Lx-Tx) relation. For halo\nmasses $\\lesssim 10^{13}$ Msun the core size approaches the virial radius.\nThus, most of the baryons in such halos cannot be in the hot ICM, but either in\nthe form of stars or in the form of hot gas beyond the virial radius. Because\nof the smaller mass in the ICM and much larger mass available for star\nformation, the majority of the baryons in low mass halos ($\\lesssim 10^{13}$\nMsun) can be expelled beyond the virial radius due to supernova feedback.

To date, our understanding of why Xco should be so\nconstant remains poor. Using a combination of extremely high resolution (~ 1\npc) galaxy evolution simulations and molecular line radiative transfer\ncalculations, we suggest that Xco displays a narrow range of values in the\nGalaxy due to the fact that molecular clouds share very similar physical\nproperties. In our models, this is itself a consequence of stellar feedback\ncompeting against gravitational collapse. GMCs whose lifetimes are regulated by\nradiative feedback show a narrow range of surface densities, temperatures and\nvelocity dispersions with values comparable to those seen in the Milky Way. As\na result, the X-factors from these clouds show reasonable correspondence with\nobserved data from the Local Group, and a relatively narrow range.

We analyze the rest-frame U-B color\ncorrelations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies in\nthe redshift range 0.5< z<0.8 from the DEEP2/AEGIS survey. We find that Sersic\nindex (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters and\nresembles a step-function with a threshold value of n=2.3. There exists,\nhowever, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high n\nvalues that seem to contradict this behavior. We hypothesize that their Sersic\nvalues may be distorted by bursts of star formation, AGNs, and/or poor fits,\nleading us to consider central surface stellar mass density as an alternative\nto Sersic index. Not only does it correct the outliers, it also forms a tight\nrelationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies is\nmost physically linked with quenching. Furthermore, at z~0.65, the majority of\nthe blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since their\nGIM2D bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses of\nsimilar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass must\nabsolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench.

The influence of the bulge mass on the stellar orbits\nin the inner regions of a disk is also investigated. The new description offers\nthe advantage of easy control of the parameters of the Gaussian profile of its\npotential. We find a range of values for the perturbation amplitude from 400 to\n800 km^2 s^{-2} kpc^{-1} which implies a maximum ratio of the tangential force\nto the axisymmetric force between 3% and 6%, approximately. Good\nself-consistency of arm shapes is obtained between the Inner Lindblad resonance\n(ILR) and the 4:1 resonance. Near the 4:1 resonance the response density starts\nto deviate from the imposed logarithmic spiral form. This creates bifurcations\nthat appear as short arms. Therefore the deviation from a perfect logarithmic\nspiral in galaxies can be understood as a natural effect of the 4:1 resonance.\nBeyond the 4:1 resonance we find closed orbits which have similarities with the\narms observed in our Galaxy.

Metals do not show an axisymmetric distribution during\nphases of strong migration. Azimuthal variations are visible during the whole\nphase of strong bar phase, and tend to disappear as the effect of radial\nmigration diminishes, together with a reduction in the bar strength.

Here we develop a new test of the cosmic evolution of supermassive\nblack holes (SMBHs) in disk galaxies by considering the local population of\nSMBHs. We show that substantial SMBH growth in spiral galaxies is required as\ndisks assemble. SMBHs exhibit a tight relation between their mass and the\nvelocity dispersion of the spheroid within which they reside, the M_BH-sigma\nrelation. In disk galaxies the bulge is the spheroid of interest. We explore\nthe evolution of the M_BH-sigma relation when bulges form together with SMBHs\non the M_BH-sigma relation and then slowly reform a disk around them. The\nformation of the disk compresses the bulge raising its sigma. We present\nevidence for such compression in the form of larger velocity dispersion of\nclassical bulges compared with elliptical galaxies at the same mass. This\ncompression leads to an offset in the M_BH-sigma relation if it is not\naccompanied by an increased M_BH. We quantify the expected offset based on\nphotometric data and show that, on average, SMBHs must grow by ~ 50-65% just to\nremain on the M_BH-sigma relation. We find no significant offset in the\nM_BH-sigma relations of classical bulges and of ellipticals, implying that\nSMBHs have been growing along with disks.

Abstract: Carbon-enhanced metal poor stars (CEMP) form a significant proportion of the\nmetal-poor stars, their origin is not well understood. Three very metal-poor\nC-rich turnoff stars were selected from the SDSS survey, observed with the ESO\nVLT (UVES) to precisely determine the element abundances. In turnoff stars\n(unlike giants) the carbon abundance has not been affected by mixing with deep\nlayers and is therefore easier to interpret. The analysis was performed with 1D\nLTE static model atmospheres. When available, non-LTE corrections were applied\nto the classical LTE abundances. The 3D effects on the CH and CN molecular\nbands were computed using hydrodynamical simulations of the stellar atmosphere\n(CO5BOLD) and are found to be very important. To facilitate a comparison with\nprevious results, only 1D abundances are used in the discussion. The abundances\n(or upper limits) of the elements enable us to place these stars in different\nCEMP classes.

Using a subsample of disks with previously measured accretion\nluminosities, we show that Pf-beta line luminosity is well correlated with\naccretion luminosity over a range of at least three orders of magnitude. We use\nthis correlation to derive accretion luminosities for all 120 targets, 65 of\nwhich are previously unreported in the literature. We also report accretion\nrates for 67 targets, 16 previously unmeasured. Our large sample size and our\nability to probe high extinction values allow for relatively unbiased\ncomparisons between different types of disks.

In order to do this, we compare to observations the\nspecific star formation rate evolution predicted by well calibrated models of\nchemical evolution for elliptical and spiral galaxies, using the additional\nconstraints on the mean stellar ages of these galaxies (at a given mass).

The properties of such\nPopulation III (Pop III) stars are thought to be very different than later\ngenerations, because cooling is dramatically different in gas with a\nmetallicity below a critical value Z_c, which lies between ~10^-6 and 10^-3\nsolar value. Z_c is much smaller than the typical average metallicity, <Z>, and\nthus the mixing efficiency of the pristine gas in the interstellar medium plays\na crucial role in the transition from Pop III to normal star formation. The\nsmall critical value, Z_c, corresponds to the far left tail of the probability\ndistribution function (PDF) of the metallicity. Based on closure models for the\nPDF formulation of turbulent mixing, we derive equations for the fraction of\ngas, P, lying below Z_c, in compressible turbulence. Our simulation data shows\nthat the evolution of the fraction P can be well approximated by a generalized\nself-convolution model, which predicts dP/dt = -n/tau_con P (1-P^(1/n)), where\nn is a measure of the locality of the PDF convolution and the timescale tau_con\nis determined by the rate at which turbulence stretches the pollutants. Using a\nsuite of simulations with Mach numbers ranging from M = 0.9 to 6.2, we provide\naccurate fits to n and tau_con as a function of M, Z_c/<Z>, and the scale, L_p,\nat which pollutants are added to the flow. For P>0.9, mixing occurs only in the\nregions surrounding the pollutants, such that n=1. For smaller P, n is larger\nas mixing becomes more global.

At such small radii, stars dominate the\nlensing mass, so that lensing provides a direct probe of the stellar\nmass-to-light ratio, with only small corrections needed for dark matter. The\nredshift of the galaxy lensed by ESO325-G004 was unknown until now, so the\nlensing mass was not securely determined. Using X-SHOOTER, we measure a secure\nsource redshift of z_src=2.141. Combined with the lensing configuration, this\nyields a total mass inside the Einstein radius of (1.50+/-0.06) 10^11 M_sun. We\nestimate the range of possible contribution of dark matter to the lensing mass,\nusing statistics from cosmological N-body simulations.

Several\nworks have studied the question whether a softening scale fixed in space and\ntime provides a good enough modelling of an astrophysical system.

Disk and spheroidal\ngalaxies show negative $\\mu$ gradients that steepen with stellar mass. In\nspheroidal galaxies $\\mu$ saturates at a critical value that is independent of\nthe galaxy mass. Thus, all the massive spheroidal galaxies have similar local\n$\\mu$ at the same radius (in HLR units). The SFH of the regions beyond 1 HLR\nare well correlated with their local $\\mu$, and follow the same relation as the\ngalaxy-averaged age and $\\mu$; suggesting that local stellar mass surface\ndensity preserves the SFH of disks. The SFH of bulges are, however, more\nfundamentally related to the total stellar mass, since the radial structure of\nthe stellar age changes with galaxy mass even though all the spheroid dominated\ngalaxies have similar radial structure in $\\mu$. Thus, galaxy mass is a more\nfundamental property in spheroidal systems while the local stellar mass surface\ndensity is more important in disks. \n\n"}

The dust\ncontent of late-type dwarf galaxies with episodic star formation is studied\nwith a multicomponent model of dust evolution, which includes dust input from\nAGB stars, type II SNe and dust mass growth by accretion of gas species in the\nISM. Dust growth in the ISM becomes an important dust source in dwarf galaxies,\non the timescale of 0.1 - few Gyrs. It increases the dust-to-gas ratio (DGR)\nduring post-burst evolution, unlike type II SNe, which eject grains into the\nISM only during starbursts. Before the dust growth in the ISM overtakes the\ndust production, AGB stars can be major sources of dust in metal-poor dwarf\ngalaxies. Our models reproduce the relation between the DGR and oxygen\nabundance, derived from observations of a large sample of dwarf galaxies. The\nsteep decrease in the DGR at low O values is explained by the relatively low\nefficiency of dust condensation in stars. The scatter observed at higher O\nvalues is determined mainly by different critical metallicities for the\ntransition from stardust- to ISM-growth dominated dust production, depending on\nthe star formation history. In galaxies with episodic star formation,\nadditional dispersion in the DGR is introduced by grain destruction during\nstarbursts, followed by an increase of the dust mass due to dust growth in the\nISM during post-burst evolution.

Here we extend the Mdust-SFR relation to\nthe high end and show that it bends over at very large SFRs (i.e., dust masses\nare lower than predicted for a given SFR). We identify several distinct\nevolutionary processes in the diagram: (1) A star-bursting phase in which dust\nbuilds up rapidly at early times. The maximum attainable dust mass in this\nprocess is the cause of the bend-over of the relation. A high dust-formation\nefficiency, a bottom-light initial mass function, and negligible supernova\nshock dust destruction are required to produce sufficiently high dust masses.\n(2) A quiescent star-forming phase in which the subsequent parallel decline in\ndust mass and SFR gives rise to the Mdust-SFR relation, through astration and\ndust destruction.

We performed SPH simulations using\nisolated galaxy models for the purpose of verifying whether dynamical and\nchemical properties of the thick discs formed in such clumpy galaxies are\ncompatible with observations. The results of our simulations seem nearly\nconsistent with observations in dynamical properties such as radial and\nvertical density profiles, significant rotation velocity lag with height and\ndistributions of orbital eccentricities. In addition, the thick discs in our\nsimulations indicate nearly exponential dependence of azimuthal and vertical\nvelocity dispersions with radius, nearly isothermal kinematics in vertical\ndirection and negligible metallicity gradients in radial and vertical\ndirections. However, our simulations cannot reproduce altitudinal dependence of\neccentricities, metallicity relations with eccentricities or rotation\nvelocities, which shows striking discrepancy from recent observations of the\nGalactic thick disc. From this result, we infer that the clumpy disc scenario\nfor thick-disc formation would not be suitable at least for the Milky Way.

In this paper, we analyze flux calibrated optical\nspectra to measure accurate spectral types and extinctions of 283 nearby T\nTauri stars. The primary advances in this paper are (1) the incorporation of a\nsimplistic accretion continuum in optical spectral type and extinction\nmeasurements calculated over the full optical wavelength range and (2) the\nuniform analysis of a large sample of stars. Comparisons between the\nnon-accreting TTS photospheric templates and stellar photosphere models are\nused to derive conversions from spectral type to temperature. Differences\nbetween spectral types can be subtle and difficult to discern, especially when\naccounting for accretion and extinction. The spectral types measured here are\nmostly consistent with spectral types measured over the past decade.

Around 30 days past\npeak, which is coincident with a bump in the declining light curve, we measure\nP~0.7% and significant variations in P across some broad lines, particularly\nHeI/NaI. By 60 days past peak the source appears to be approaching a low value\nof interstellar polarization (P<0.2%). The results are consistent with a\nscenario in which a potentially bipolar explosion during 2012a impacts a\ntoroidal distribution of CSM, thereby causing the 2012b brightening.\nOrthogonality between the 2012a and 2012b geometries is inconsistent with the\nhypothesis that the 2012a event launched the CSM that was hit 40 days later by\nmaterial from the 2012b event. Rather, the aspherical CSM probably has a\nseparate origin associated with the outbursts of the stellar progenitor during\nprior years. Previous calculations that assumed spherical symmetry for the CSM\nhave underestimated the required explosion energy, as the results suggest that\n<10% of the fast SN ejecta participated in strong CSM interaction during the\n2012b phase.

We\npresent a picture in which the population of AGN can be divided into two\ndistinct populations. The Radiative-Mode AGN are associated with black holes\nthat produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of ~1% of\nthe Eddington Limit. They are primarily associated with less massive black\nholes growing in high-density pseudo-bulges at a rate sufficient to produce the\ntotal mass budget in these black holes in ~10 Gyr. The circum-nuclear\nenvironment contains high density cold gas and associated star-formation. Major\nmergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular\nprocesses appear dominant. Stellar feedback will be generic in these objects\nand strong AGN feedback is seen only in the most powerful AGN. In Jet-Mode AGN\nthe bulk of energetic output takes the form of collimated outflows (jets).\nThese AGN are associated with the more massive black holes in more massive\n(classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies. Neither the accretion onto these\nblack holes nor star-formation in their host bulge is significant today.

We consider\na simple, however rather realistic, mean-field galactic dynamo model where the\neffects of small-scale generation are represented by random injections of\nmagnetic field from star forming regions. We represent an encounter by the\nintroduction of large-scale streaming velocities and by an increase in\nsmall-scale magnetic field injections. The latter describes the effect of an\nincrease of the star formation rate caused by the encounter. We demonstrate\nthat large-scale streaming, with associated deviations in the rotation curve,\ncan result in an enhancement of the anisotropic turbulent (ordered) magnetic\nfield strength, mainly along the azimuthal direction, leading to a significant\ntemporary increase of the total magnetic energy during the encounter; the\nrepresentation of an increase in star formation rate has an additional strong\neffect. In contrast to expectations, the large-scale (regular) magnetic field\nstructure is not significantly destroyed by the encounter. It may be somewhat\nweakened for a relatively short period, and its direction after the encounter\nmay be reversed. The encounter causes enhanced total and polarized emission\nwithout increase of the regular magnetic field strength. The increase of\nsynchrotron emission caused by the large-scale streaming can be comparable to\nthe effect of the increase of the star formation rate, depending on the choice\nof parameters.The effects of the encounter on the total magnetic field energy\nlast only slightly longer than the duration of the encounter (ca. 1 Gyr). \n\n"}

We select\ngalaxies that have a stellar mass >3x10^10 Msun inside r=1 kpc out to z=2.5,\nusing the 3D-HST survey and data at low redshift. Remarkably, the number\ndensity of galaxies with dense cores appears to have decreased from z=2.5 to\nthe present. This decrease is probably mostly due to stellar mass loss and the\nresulting adiabatic expansion, with some contribution from merging. We infer\nthat dense cores were mostly formed at z>2.5, consistent with their largely\nquiescent stellar populations. While the cores appear to form early, the\ngalaxies in which they reside show strong evolution: their total masses\nincrease by a factor of 2-3 from z=2.5 to z=0 and their effective radii\nincrease by a factor of 5-6. As a result, the contribution of dense cores to\nthe total mass of the galaxies in which they reside decreases from ~50% at\nz=2.5 to ~15% at z=0. Because of their early formation, the contribution of\ndense cores to the total stellar mass budget of the Universe is a strong\nfunction of redshift. The stars in cores with M_1kpc>3x10^10 Msun make up ~0.1%\nof the stellar mass density of the Universe today but 10%-20% at z~2, depending\non their IMF.

The simulations follow timed release of mass, energy, and\nmetals by stellar evolution and employ phenomenological treatments of supernova\nfeedback, pre-supernova feedback modeled as feedback by radiation pressure from\nmassive stars, and quenching of gas cooling in large halos. We construct the\nfiducial model so that it reproduces the observationally estimated galaxy\nstellar mass functions and the relationships between the galaxy stellar mass\nand the host halo mass from $z = 4$ to 0. We find that the fiducial model\nconstructed this way naturally explains the cosmic star formation history, the\ngalaxy downsizing, and the star formation rate and metallicity of the\nstar-forming galaxies. The simulations without the quenching of the gas cooling\nin large halos overproduce massive galaxies at $z < 2$ and fail to reproduce\ngalaxy downsizing. The simulations that do not employ the radiation pressure\nfeedback from young stars predict too strong redshift evolution of the\nmass-metallicity relation. Furthermore, the slope of the relation becomes too\nsteep at low redshift without the radiation pressure feedback. The metallicity\ndependence in the radiation pressure feedback is a key to explain the observed\nmass-metallicity relation. These facts indicate that these two processes in\naddition to supernova feedback are essential for galaxy evolution. Our simple\nphenomenological model is suitable to construct a mock galaxy sample to study\nphysical properties of observed galaxy populations. \n\n"}

All studied galaxies undergo a phase of\nmerging activity at high redshift, so that stars older than 9 Gyr are found in\na centrally concentrated component, while younger stars are mostly found in\ndiscs. We find that most MAPs have simple exponential radial and vertical\ndensity profiles, with a scale-height that typically increases with age.\nBecause a large range of merger histories can create populations with simple\nstructures, this suggests that the simplicity of the structure of\nmono-abundance populations observed in the Milky Way by Bovy et al.

Binaries\nwith highly inclined orbits in respect to their orbit around the MBH are\nstrongly affected by secular processes, which periodically change their\neccentricities and inclinations (e.g. Kozai--Lidov cycles). During periapsis\napproach, dissipative processes such as tidal friction may become highly\nefficient, and may lead to shrinkage of a binary orbit and even to its merger.\nBinaries in this environment can therefore significantly change their orbital\nevolution due to the MBH third-body perturbative effects.

With such\nsmall scatter this star-formation main sequence (SFMS) has been interpreted as\ndeterministic and fundamental. Here we demonstrate that it is a simple\nconsequence of the central limit theorem. Our derivation begins by\napproximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like a\nrandom walk (where the expectation of SFR at any time is equal to the SFR at\nthe previous time). We then derive expectation values for median SSFR of\nstar-forming disks and their scatter over time. We generalize the results for\nstochastic changes in SFR that are not independent of each other but are\ncorrelated over time. For unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive an\nexpectation that <SSFR> should be independent of mass, decline as 1/T, and have\na relative scatter that is independent of mass and time.

The framework reproduces several important\nobservables, including: the scatter in SSFR at fixed mass; the SFHs of nearby\ndwarf galaxies and the Milky Way; and the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation.\nThe evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss ways\nto generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such as\nmergers.

However, neutral intergalactic gas that existed during the\nEoR was opaque to Lya emission that escaped from galaxies during this epoch,\nwhich makes it difficult to observe.

We use the adaptive mesh refinement code Enzo to simulate the\ncollapse of gas at high redshift, including a nine species chemical model of H,\nHe, and H$_2$. The direct collapse model requires that the gas cools\npredominantly via atomic hydrogen. To this end we simulate the effect of an\nanisotropic radiation source on the collapse of a halo at high redshift.

Based on our ellipticity measurements from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey Data Release 7, and additional imaging from the Isaac Newton\nTelescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotators\nunder the assumption of axisymmetry. The so-obtained intrinsic shape\ndistribution for the fast rotators can be described with a Gaussian with a mean\nflattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additional\ntail towards rounder shapes. The slow rotators are much rounder, and are well\ndescribed with a Gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. We then checked\nthat our results were consistent when applying a different and independent\nmethod to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observed\nellipticity distributions directly using Gaussian parametrisations for the\nintrinsic axis ratios. Although both fast and slow rotators are identified as\nearly-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shape\nstudies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions are\nsignificantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios.

These spheres undergo solid-body\nrotation with maximum velocities in the range 0-300 \\kms and neutral hydrogen\noptical depths in the range $\\tau_{\\rm H}=10^{5}-10^{7}$. We consider two types\nof source distributions in the sphere: central and homogeneous. Our main result\nis that rotation introduces a dependence of the line morphology with viewing\nangle and rotational velocity. Observations with a line of sight parallel to\nthe rotation axis yield line morphologies similar to the static case. For lines\nof sight perpendicular to the rotation axis both the intensity at the line\ncenter and the line width increase with rotational velocity. Along the same\nline of sight, the line becomes single peaked at rotational velocities close to\nhalf the line width in the static case. Notably, we find that rotation does not\ninduce any spatial anisotropy in the integrated line flux, the escape fraction\nor the average number of scatterings. This is because Lyman {\\alpha} scattering\nthrough a rotating solid-body proceeds identical as in the static case. The\nonly difference is the doppler shift from the different regions in the sphere\nthat move with respect to the observer.

The whole\ncluster SMF is well fitted by a double Schechter function. The SMFs of cluster\nSF and passive galaxies are statistically different. The SMF of the SF cluster\ngalaxies does not depend on the environment.

Eight radio source\nsamples are combined to produce a catalogue of 211 radio-loud AGN with\n0.5<z<1.0, which are spectroscopically classified into jet-mode and\nradiative-mode (radiatively-efficient) AGN classes. Comparing with large\nsamples of local radio-AGN from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the cosmic\nevolution of the radio luminosity function of each radio-AGN class is\nindependently derived. Radiative-mode radio-AGN show an order of magnitude\nincrease in space density out to z~1 at all luminosities, consistent with these\nAGN being fuelled by cold gas. In contrast, the space density of jet-mode\nradio-AGN decreases with increasing redshift at low radio luminosities (L_1.4 <\n1e24 W/Hz) but increases at higher radio luminosities. Simple models are\ndeveloped to explain the observed evolution.

A model which assumes that\nthe AGN activity is triggered by major mergers is quite successful in\npredicting both the low halo mass of COSMOS AGN and the typical mass of\nluminous SDSS quasars at z~3, with the latter inhabiting more massive halos\nrespect to moderate luminosity AGN. Alternatively we can argue, at least for\nType 1 COSMOS AGN, that they are possibly representative of an early phase of\nfast (i.e. Eddington limited) BH growth induced by cosmic cold flows or disk\ninstabilities. Given the moderate luminosity, these new fast growing BHs have\nmasses of e7-8 Msun at z~3 which might evolve into e8.5-9 Msun mass BHs at z=0.\nFollowing our clustering measurements, we argue that this fast BH growth at z~3\nin AGN with moderate luminosity occurs in DMHs with typical mass of 6 times e12\nMsun/h. \n\n"}

Our observations show that\nmolecular gas is being driven out of the nuclear region at $\\dot{M}_{\\rm out}\n\\approx 110 M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, of which the vast majority cannot escape the\nnucleus. Only 2 $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is actually capable of escaping the galaxy.\nMost of the molecular gas that remains is very inefficient at forming stars.\nThe far-infrared emission is dominated by an ultra-compact ($\\lesssim50$pc)\nsource that could either be powered by an AGN or by an ultra-compact starburst.\nThe ratio of the SF surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$) to the gas surface\ndensity ($\\Sigma_{\\rm H_2}$) indicates that SF is suppressed by a factor of\n$\\approx 50$ compared to normal star-forming galaxies if all gas is forming\nstars, and $\\approx$150 for the outskirt (98%) dense molecular gas if the\ncentral region is is powered by an ultra-compact starburst.

To better understand the impact of SN explosions on the\nevolution of galaxies, we perform a suite of high-resolution (12 pc), zoom-in\ncosmological simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy at z=3 with adaptive mesh\nrefinement. We find that SN explosions can efficiently regulate star formation,\nleading to the stellar mass and metallicity consistent with the observed\nmass-metallicity relation and stellar mass-halo mass relation at z~3. This is\nachieved by making three important changes to the classical feedback scheme: i)\nthe different phases of SN blast waves are modelled directly by injecting\nradial momentum expected at each stage, ii) the realistic time delay of SNe,\ncommencing at as early as 3 Myr, is required to disperse very dense gas before\na runaway collapse sets in at the galaxy centre via mergers of gas clumps, and\niii) a non-uniform density distribution of the ISM is taken into account below\nthe computational grid scale for the cell in which SN explodes. The last\ncondition is motivated by the fact that our simulations still do not resolve\nthe detailed structure of a turbulent ISM in which the fast outflows can\npropagate along low-density channels. The simulated galaxy with the SN feedback\nmodel shows strong outflows, which carry approximately ten times larger mass\nthan star formation rate, as well as smoothly rising circular velocity.

These galaxies have both more gas and more\nstars in their disks than the typical disk galaxy of similar rotational\nvelocity. The \"condensed\" baryon fraction, $f_C$, the fraction of the baryons\nin a dark matter halo that settle either as cold gas or stars into the disk, is\ntwice as high in the HI-massive sample than typical, and almost reaches the\nuniversal baryon fraction in some cases, suggesting that the most extreme of\nthese galaxies have little in the way of a hot baryonic component or cold\nbaryons distributed well outside the disk.

The radio\ninformation allows identification of quasars missed by typical color-based\nselections. While we find no good 6.4 < z <7.2 quasar candidates at the\nsensitivities of these surveys, we discover two new radio-loud quasars at z~6.\nFurthermore, we identify two additional z~6 radio-loud quasars which were not\npreviously known to be radio-loud, nearly doubling the current z~6 sample. We\nshow the importance of having infrared photometry for z>5.5 quasars to robustly\nclassify them as radio-quiet or radio-loud. Based on this, we reclassify the\nquasar J0203+0012 (z=5.72), previously considered radio-loud, to be\nradio-quiet. Using the available data in the literature, we constrain the\nradio-loud fraction of quasars at z~6, using the Kaplan--Meier estimator, to be\n$8.1^{+5.0}_{-3.2}\\%$. This result is consistent with there being no evolution\nof the radio-loud fraction with redshift, in contrast to what has been\nsuggested by some studies at lower redshifts. \n\n"}

In this paper we discuss how a classification based on\ncanonical, non-parametric structural indices measured on resolved stellar mass\nmaps, rather than on single-band images, reduces the misclassification of\nclumpy but not merging galaxies. We calibrate the mass-based selection of\nmergers using the MIRAGE hydrodynamical numerical simulations of isolated and\nmerging galaxies which span a stellar mass range of\n$10^{9.8}$-$10^{10.6}M_{sun}$ and merger ratios between 1:1-1:6.3.

The He II proximity zone\nsizes decrease at higher redshifts, particularly at z > 3.3. This trend is\nsimilar to that for H I, signaling an onset of He II reionization at z~4.\n  For quasar SDSS1253+6817 (z=3.48), the He II absorption trough displays a\ngradual decline and serves a good case for modeling the He II reionization.

This misalignment persists\nfor about 2 Gyr before the gas-star misalignment angle drops below 20 degrees.\nThe time it takes for the gaseous and stellar components to align is much\nlonger than previously thought, because the gas disc is accreting a significant\namount of mass for about 1.5 Gyr after the merger, during which the angular\nmomentum change induced by accreted gas dominates over that induced by stellar\ntorques.

(2) The gas disk in the galactic nucleus\nundergoes an initial burst of star formation followed by several Myrs where\nstellar feedback suppresses the star formation rate (SFR).

However, the use of the radio lobe luminosity in the denominator\n(essentially to try and factor out the intrinsic power of the central engine)\nhas been criticized and other proxies for the intrinsic engine power have been\nproposed.

Second, we infer the ISRF intensity from\nthe total power emitted by dust per unit extinction, and then predict the\nemission spectrum. In both cases, we test the ability of the models to\nreproduce dust emission and extinction at the same time.\n  We identify two issues. Not all models can reproduce the average dust\nemission per unit extinction: there are differences of up to a factor $\\sim2$\nbetween models, and the best accord between model and observation is obtained\nwith the more emissive grains derived from recent laboratory data on silicates\nand amorphous carbons.

The mass of disc gas, M$_{\\rm gas}$, depends upon a galaxy halo's\nspin and virial mass, but not upon stellar feedback. Halos with low spin have\nhigh star formation efficiency and lower disc gas mass. Similarly, lower\nstellar feedback leads to more star formation so the gas mass ends up nearly\nthe same irregardless of stellar feedback strength. Even considering spin, the\nM$_{\\rm gas}$ relation with halo mass, M$_{200}$ only shows a factor of 3\nscatter. The M$_{\\rm gas}$--M$_{200}$ relation show a break at\nM$_{200}$=$2\\times10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$ that corresponds to an observed break in\nthe M$_{\\rm gas}$--M$_\\star$ relation. The constant disc mass stems from a\nshared halo gas density profile in all the simulated galaxies. In their outer\nregions, the profiles are isothermal. Where the profile rises above $n=10^{-3}$\ncm$^{-3}$, the gas readily cools and the profile steepens. Inside the disc,\nrotation supports gas with a flatter density profile except where supernova\nexplosions disrupt the disc.

In Smith &\nMarian (2015) we generalized the power spectrum methodology of Feldman et al.\n(1994) to take into account the key tenets of galaxy formation: galaxies form\nand reside exclusively in dark matter haloes; a given dark matter halo may host\ngalaxies of various luminosities; galaxies inherit the large-scale bias\nassociated with their host halo. In this paradigm we derived the optimal\nweighting and reconstruction scheme for maximizing the signal-to-noise on a\ngiven band power estimate.

For the host system we vary\nthe gas fraction, disk size and thickness, halo mass, and concentration, while\nwe explore different masses, concentrations, and orbits for the satellite.

Several approaches to reducing shape noise have recently\nbeen put forward, using information beyond photometry, such as radio\npolarization and optical spectroscopy. Here we investigate how well the\nintrinsic ellipticities of galaxies can be predicted using other, exclusively\nphotometric parameters. These parameters (such as galaxy colours) are already\navailable in the data and do not necessitate additional, often expensive\nobservations. We apply two regression techniques, generalized additive models\n(GAM) and projection pursuit regression (PPR) to the publicly released data\ncatalog of galaxy properties from CFHTLenS. In our simple analysis we find that\nthe individual galaxy ellipticities can indeed be predicted from other\nphotometric parameters to better precision than the scatter about the mean\nellipticity. This means that without additional observations beyond photometry\nthe ellipticity contribution to the shear can be measured to higher precision,\ncomparable to using a larger sample of galaxies.

Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are\nsufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using\nonly the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,\norder-of-magnitude errors. \n\n"}

To study dust extinction curves intrinsic to the\nquasars, from the HAQ survey we selected 16 cases where the Small Magellanic\nCloud (SMC) law could not provide a good solution to the spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs).

The derived\nextinction, $A_V$, ranges from 0.2-1.0 mag. All the individual extinction\ncurves of our quasars are steeper ($R_V=2.2$-2.7) than that of the SMC, with a\nweighted mean value of $R_V=2.4$.

For this purpose we built a numerical model of the cloud\nassuming QUMOND, a modified gravity theory of MD. In the modified gravity\nversions of MD, the internal dynamics of a system is influenced by the external\ngravitational field in which the system is embedded, even when this external\nfield is constant and uniform, a phenomenon dubbed the external field effect\n(EFE).

Our\nnew results strengthen our previous conclusion that the LF appears to evolve\nsmoothly from z=8 to z=9, an evolution which can be equally well modelled by a\nfactor of ~2 drop in density, or a dimming of ~0.5 mag in M*.

To\naccomplish these tasks it is important to have large samples of clusters with\nhomogeneous data and analysis to derive kinematics, chemical abundances, ages\nand locations. We obtain homogeneous metallicities and alpha-element\nenhancement for over 800 red giant stars in 51 Galactic bulge, disc, and halo\nglobular clusters that are among the most distant and/or highly reddened in the\nGalaxy's globular cluster system. We observed R ~ 2000 spectra in the\nwavelength interval 456-586 nm and applied full spectrum fitting technique. We\ncompared the mean abundances of all clusters with previous work and with field\nstars. We used the relation between mean metallicity and horizontal branch\nmorphology defined by all clusters to select outliers for discussion. We find\nour metallicities are comparable to those derived from high-resolution data to\nwithin sigma = 0.08 dex over the interval -2.5 < [Fe/H] < 0.0. We also find\nthat the distribution of [Mg/Fe] and [alpha/Fe] with [Fe/H] for the 51 clusters\nfollows the general trend exhibited by field stars. It is the first time that\nthe following clusters have been included in a large sample of homogeneous\nstellar spectroscopic observations and metallicity derivation: BH 176, Djorg 2,\nPal 10, NGC 6426, Lynga 7, and Terzan 8.

A possible resolution to\nthis conundrum is that many AGN are reddened by dust along the line of sight.\nTo explore this possibility, we stack 5000 SDSS AGN with luminosity\nL~10^45erg/s and redshift z~0.4 in bins of optical continuum slope alpha_opt\nand width of the broad H$\\beta$ emission line. We measure the EW of the NaID\nabsorption feature in each stacked spectrum. We find a linear relation between\nalpha_opt and EW(NaID), such that EW(NaID) increases as alpha_opt becomes\nredder. In the bin with the smallest H$\\beta$ width, objects with the bluest\nslopes that are similar to accretion disk predictions are found to have\nEW(NaID)=0, supporting the line-of-sight dust hypothesis. This conclusion is\nalso supported by the dependence of the $H\\alpha/H\\beta$ line ratio on\nalpha_opt. The implied relationship between alpha_opt and dust reddening is\ngiven by E(B-V)~0.2(-0.1-alpha_opt), and the implied reddening of a typical\ntype 1 AGN with alpha_opt=-0.5 is E(B-V)~0.08mag. Photoionization calculations\nshow that the dusty gas responsible for reddening is too ionized to produce the\nobserved features. Therefore, we argue that the sodium absorption arises in\nregions of the host ISM which are shielded from the AGN radiation, and the\ncorrelation with alpha_opt arises since ISM columns along shielded and\nnon-shielded sightlines are correlated.

Combined with estimated\ndynamical times t_dyn ~ 3-5 Gyr and SED fitting results for the time at which\nsatellites stopped forming stars, t_quench ~ 6 Gyr, we infer that for a\nsignificant fraction of the satellites, star formation quenched before those\nsatellites entered their current hosts. The result holds for red satellites\nover a large range of cluster-centric distances 0.1 - 0.6 Mpc/h. We discuss the\nimplications of this result for models of galaxy formation. \n\n"}

Recent galaxy formation simulations\nhave demonstrated the need for active CR transport either in the form of\ndiffusion or streaming to successfully launch winds in galaxies. However, due\nto computational limitations, most previous simulations have modeled CR\ntransport isotropically. Here, we discuss high resolution simulations of\nisolated disk galaxies in a $10^{11}\\rm{M_\\odot}$ halo with the moving mesh\ncode {\\sc Arepo} that include injection of CRs from supernovae, advective\ntransport, CR cooling, and CR transport through isotropic or anisotropic\ndiffusion. We show that either mode of diffusion leads to the formation of\nstrong bipolar outflows. However, they develop significantly later in the\nsimulation with anisotropic diffusion compared to the simulation with isotropic\ndiffusion. Moreover, we find that isotropic diffusion allows most of the CRs to\nquickly diffuse out of the disk, while in the simulation with anisotropic\ndiffusion, most CRs remain in the disk once the magnetic field becomes\ndominated by its azimuthal component, which occurs after $\\sim 300\\,{\\rm\nMyrs}$. This has important consequences for the gas dynamics in the disk. In\nparticular, we show that isotropic diffusion strongly suppresses the\namplification of the magnetic field in the disk compared to anisotropic or no\ndiffusion models. We therefore conclude that reliable simulations which include\nCR transport inevitably need to account for anisotropic diffusion. \n\n"}

In this paper, we elaborate our model of RAT\nalignment for grains with enhanced magnetic susceptibility due to iron\ninclusions, such that RAT alignment is magnetically enhanced for which we term\nMRAT mechanism. Such grains can get aligned with high angular momentum at the\nso-called high-J attractor points, achieving a high degree of alignment. Using\nour analytical model of RATs we derive the critical value of the magnetic\nrelaxation parameter $\\delta_{m}$ to produce high-J attractor points as\nfunctions of $q^{\\max}$ and the anisotropic radiation angle relative to the\nmagnetic field $\\psi$. We find that if about $10\\%$ of total iron abundance\npresent in silicate grains are forming iron clusters, it is sufficient to\nproduce high-J attractor points for all reasonable values of $q^{\\max}$.

Abstract: Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is widely considered to be the\nmain driver in regulating the growth of massive galaxies through heating or\ndriving gas out of the galaxy, preventing further increase in stellar mass.\nObservational proof for this scenario has, however, been scarce. We have\nassembled a sample of 132 radio-quiet type-2 and red AGN at 0.1<z<1. We measure\nthe kinematics of the AGN-ionized gas, the host galaxies' stellar masses and\nstar formation rates and investigate the relationships between AGN\nluminosities, specific star formation rates (sSFR) and outflow strengths W90 --\nthe 90\\% velocity width of the [OIII]5007 line power and a proxy for the\nAGN-driven outflow speed. Outflow strength is independent of sSFR for AGN\nselected on their mid-IR luminosity, in agreement with previous work\ndemonstrating that star formation is not sufficient to produce the observed\nionized gas outflows which have to be powered by AGN activity. More\nimportantly, we find a negative correlation between W90 and sSFR in the AGN\nhosts with the highest SFRs, i.e., with the highest gas content, where\npresumably the coupling of the AGN-driven wind to the gas is strongest. This\nimplies that AGN with strong outflow signatures are hosted in galaxies that are\nmore `quenched' than galaxies with weaker outflow signatures. Despite the\ngalaxies' high SFRs, we demonstrate that the outflows are not star-formation\ndriven but indeed due to AGN-powering. This observation is consistent with the\nAGN having a net suppression, `negative' impact, through feedback on the\ngalaxies' star formation history. \n\n"}

We aim to determine the fraction\nof core mass in the temperature range < 8 K that can be expected for typical\nlow- and high-mass star formation regions. We calculate the dust temperature\nwithin standard spherically symmetric prestellar cores for a grid of density\npowerlaws in the outer core regions, core masses, and variation in the external\nmulti-component radiation field. The dust is assumed to be composed of\namorphous silicate and carbon, and variations of its optical properties are\ndiscussed. As measure for the distribution of cores and clumps, we use core\nmass functions derived for various environments. In view of the high densities\nin very cold central regions, dust and gas temperatures are assumed to be\nequal. We find that the fraction of mass with temperatures < 8 K in typical\nlow- and high-mass cores is < 20\\%. It is possible to obtain higher fractions\nof very cold gas by placing intermediate- or high-mass cores in a typical\nlow-mass star formation environment.

Since most of the elements visible in\nX-rays are formed by type Ia (SNIa) and/or core-collapse (SNcc) supernovae,\nmeasuring their abundances gives us direct information on the nucleosynthesis\nproducts of billions of SNe since the epoch of the star formation peak (z~2-3).\nIn this study, we compare the most accurate average X/Fe abundance ratios\n(compiled in a previous work from XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS observations of 44\ngalaxy clusters, groups, and ellipticals), representative of the chemical\nenrichment in the nearby ICM, to various SNIa and SNcc nucleosynthesis models\nfound in the literature. The use of a SNcc model combined to any favoured\nstandard SNIa model (deflagration or delayed-detonation) fails to reproduce our\nabundance pattern. In particular, the Ca/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios are significantly\nunderestimated by the models. We show that the Ca/Fe ratio can be reproduced\nbetter, either by taking a SNIa delayed-detonation model that matches the\nobservations of the Tycho supernova remnant, or by adding a contribution from\nthe Ca-rich gap transient SNe, whose material should easily mix into the hot\nICM.

In either case, the fraction of SNIa over\nthe total number of SNe (SNIa+SNcc) contributing to the ICM enrichment ranges\nwithin 29-45%.

Abstract: Recent spatially resolved observations of galaxies at z=0.6-3 reveal that\nhigh-redshift galaxies show complex kinematics and a broad distribution of\ngas-phase metallicity gradients. To understand these results, we use a suite of\nhigh-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Feedback in Realistic\nEnvironments (FIRE) project, which include physically motivated models of the\nmulti-phase ISM, star formation, and stellar feedback. Our simulations\nreproduce the observed diversity of kinematic properties and metallicity\ngradients, broadly consistent with observations at z=0-3. Strong negative\nmetallicity gradients only appear in galaxies with a rotating disk, but not all\nrotationally supported galaxies have significant gradients. Strongly perturbed\ngalaxies with little rotation always have flat gradients. The kinematic\nproperties and metallicity gradient of a high-redshift galaxy can vary\nsignificantly on short time-scales, associated with starburst episodes.\nFeedback from a starburst can destroy the gas disk, drive strong outflows, and\nflatten a pre-existing negative metallicity gradient. The time variability of a\nsingle galaxy is statistically similar to the entire simulated sample,\nindicating that the observed metallicity gradients in high-redshift galaxies\nreflect the instantaneous state of the galaxy rather than the accretion and\ngrowth history on cosmological time-scales. We find weak dependence of\nmetallicity gradient on stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR).\nLow-mass galaxies and galaxies with high sSFR tend to have flat gradients,\nlikely due to the fact that feedback is more efficient in these galaxies.

Stochastic optics extends traditional\nsynthesis imaging by simultaneously reconstructing an unscattered image and its\nrefractive perturbations.

Several lines of evidence suggest that these quiescent galaxies form a\ndistinct population rather than a low star formation tail of the main sequence.\nWe demonstrate that a tight main sequence, evolving with epoch, is a natural\noutcome of most histories of star formation and has little astrophysical\nsignificance, but that the quiescent population requires additional\nastrophysics to explain its properties. Using a simple model for disk evolution\nbased on the observed dependence of star formation on gas content in local\ngalaxies, and assuming simple histories of cold gas inflow, we show that the\nevolution of galaxies away from the main sequence can be attributed to the\ndepletion of gas due to star formation after a cutoff in gas inflow. The\nquiescent population is composed of galaxies in which the density of disk gas\nhas fallen below a threshold for disk stability.

To clarify what constraint\nwe can get for the dust enrichment in normal galaxies detected by ALMA, we use\na theoretical model that includes major processes driving dust evolution in a\ngalaxy; that is, dust condensation in stellar ejecta, dust growth by the\naccretion of gas-phase metals, and supernova destruction. Using the dust\nemission fluxes detected in two normal galaxies at $z>6$ by ALMA as a\nconstraint, we can get the range of the time-scales (or efficiencies) of the\nabove mentioned processes. We find that if we assume extremely high\ncondensation efficiency in stellar ejecta ($f_{\\mathrm{in}} \\ga 0.5$), rapid\ndust enrichment by stellar sources in the early phase may be enough to explain\nthe observed ALMA flux, unless dust destruction by supernovae in those galaxies\nis stronger than that in nearby galaxies. If we assume a condensation\nefficiency expected from theoretical calculations ($f_{\\mathrm{in}} \\la 0.1$),\nstrong dust growth (even stronger than assumed for nearby galaxies if they are\nmetal-poor galaxies) is required.

The slope of f_SF vs. D8 is -0.008 +/- 0.002. The f_SF of clusters\nlocated in low-density large-scale environments, 0.244 +/- 0.011, is higher\nthan for clusters located in high-density supercluster cores, 0.202 +/- 0.014.\nWe also divide superclusters, according to their morphology, into filament- and\nspider-type systems. The inverse relationship between cluster f_SF and\nlarge-scale density is dominated by filament- rather than spider-type\nsuperclusters. In high-density cores of superclusters, we find a higher f_SF in\nspider-type superclusters, 0.229 +/- 0.016, than in filament-type\nsuperclusters, 0.166 +/- 0.019. Using principal component analysis, we confirm\nthese results and the direct correlation between cluster substructure and SF.\nThese results indicate that cluster SF is affected by both the dynamical age of\nthe cluster (younger systems exhibit higher amounts of SF); the large-scale\ndensity of the supercluster environment (high-density core regions exhibit\nlower amounts of SF); and supercluster morphology (spider-type superclusters\nexhibit higher amounts of SF at high densities). \n\n"}

The smooth distribution across colors for the disk\ngalaxies corresponds to a slow exhaustion of gas, with no fast quenching event.\nMeanwhile, blue spheroids most likely come from major mergers of star-forming\ndisk galaxies, and the dearth of spheroids at intermediate green colors is\nsuggestive of rapid quenching.

The high fraction of bulge-dominated galaxies that host an AGN\nin the blue cloud and green valley is consistent with the scenario in which the\nAGN is triggered after a major merger, and the host galaxy then quickly evolves\ninto the green valley.

Their compact radio structure can be imaged with very\nlong baseline interferometry (VLBI) on parsec scales. Blazars at extremely high\nredshifts provide a unique insight into the AGN phenomena in the early\nUniverse. We observed four radio sources at redshift $z>4$ with the European\nVLBI Network (EVN) at 1.7 and 5 GHz. These objects were previously classified\nas blazar candidates based on X-ray observations. One of them, J2134$-$0419 is\nfirmly confirmed as a blazar with our VLBI observations, due to its\nrelativistically beamed radio emission. Its radio jet extended to $\\sim$10\nmilli-arcsec scale makes this source a promising target for follow-up VLBI\nobservations to reveal any apparent proper motion. Another target, J0839+5112\nshows a compact radio structure typical of quasars. There is evidence for flux\ndensity variability and its radio \"core\" has a flat spectrum. However, the EVN\ndata suggest that its emission is not Doppler-boosted. The remaining two blazar\ncandidates (J1420+1205 and J2220+0025) show radio properties totally unexpected\nfrom radio AGN with small-inclination jet. Their emission extends to arcsec\nscales and the Doppler factors of the central components are well below 1.\nTheir structures resemble that of double-lobed radio AGN with large inclination\nto the line of sight.

We restrict our measurements to scales $>1$\nMpc to probe the correlations between the formation histories of distinct\nhalos. Over the stellar mass range $10^{9.7} \\le M_\\ast/M_\\odot \\le 10^{10.9}$,\nwe find minimal statistical evidence for conformity.

For models\nwith strong correlations between halo and stellar age, the conformity signal is\ntoo large to be consistent with the data. For weaker implementations of\nage-matching, galactic conformity is not a sensitive diagnostic of halo\nassembly bias, and would not produce a detectable signal in SDSS data.

The dependence on the\ndisc inclination is such that weaker bars form in more inclined discs. The bars\nexperience either a very weak buckling or none at all.

There are two key\nnovelties. First, starting with a large database of deep Spitzer 24{\\mu}m and\nVLA 20cm detections that are used to define prior positions for fitting the\nFIR/submm data, we perform an active selection of useful priors independently\nat each frequency band, moving from less to more confused bands. Exploiting\nknowledge of redshift and all available photometry, we identify hopelessly\nfaint priors that we remove from the fitting pool. This approach significantly\nreduces blending degeneracies and allows reliable photometry to be obtained for\ngalaxies in FIR+mm bands. Second, we obtain well-behaved, nearly Gaussian flux\ndensity uncertainties, individually tailored to all fitted priors in each band.\nThis is done by exploiting extensive simulations that allow us to calibrate the\nconversion of formal fitting uncertainties to realistic uncertainties depending\non quantities directly measurable. We achieve deeper detection limits with high\nfidelity measurements and uncertainties at FIR+mm bands.

Although the LG mostly reionizes in\nan inside-out fashion, the final 40 per cent of its ionization shows some\noutside influence. For the LG satellites, we find no evidence that their\nredshift of reionization is related to the present-day mass of the satellite or\nthe distance from the central galaxy. We find that less than 20 per cent of\npresent-day satellites for MW and M31 have undergone any star formation prior\nto the end of global reionization.

Radiative transfer calculations are used to model dust\nemission and polarization on the top of MHD simulations. We compute synthetic\nmaps of column density $N_H$, polarization fraction $p$, and polarization angle\ndispersion $S$, and study their dependencies on the important properties of the\nMHD simulations. These include the large-scale magnetic field and its\norientation, the small-scale magnetic field, and supernova-driven shocks.\nSimilar filament-like structures of $S$ as seen in the Planck all-sky maps are\nvisible in our synthetic results, although the smallest scale structures are\nabsent from our maps. Supernova-driven shock fronts and $S$ do not show\nsignificant correlation. Instead, $S$ can clearly be attributed to the\ndistribution of the small-scale magnetic field. We also find that the\nlarge-scale magnetic field influences the polarization properties, such that,\nfor a given strength of magnetic fluctuation, a strong plane-of-the-sky mean\nfield weakens the observed $S$, while strengthening $p$. The anticorrelation of\n$p$ and $S$, and decreasing $p$ as a function of $N_H$ are consistent across\nall synthetic observations.

This technique has been established as a fundamental tool in\nextragalactic research. It has been extensively applied to large spectroscopic\ndata sets, notably the SDSS, leading to important insights into the galaxy\nassembly history. However, despite significant improvements over the past\ndecade, all current PSS codes suffer from two major deficiencies that inhibit\nus from gaining sharp insights into the star-formation history (SFH) of\ngalaxies and potentially introduce substantial biases in studies of their\nphysical properties (e.g., stellar mass, mass-weighted stellar age and specific\nstar formation rate). These are i) the neglect of nebular emission in spectral\nfits, consequently, ii) the lack of a mechanism that ensures consistency\nbetween the best-fitting SFH and the observed nebular emission characteristics\nof a star-forming (SF) galaxy. In this article, we present FADO (Fitting\nAnalysis using Differential evolution Optimization): a conceptually novel,\npublicly available PSS tool with the distinctive capability of permitting\nidentification of the SFH that reproduces the observed nebular characteristics\nof a SF galaxy. This so-far unique self-consistency concept allows us to\nsignificantly alleviate degeneracies in current spectral synthesis.

We study in detail how\nionizing radiation can leak from high redshift galaxies. For this purpose, we\nuse a series of high resolution radiation hydrodynamics simulations, zooming on\nthree dwarf galaxies in a cosmological context.

These observations have spatial (angular) resolutions of 30--720 pc\n(0.07\"-0.67\") in a part of the spectrum that is likely to be optically thin.\nThis allows us to estimate the size of the energetically dominant regions.

In the model the gas is in vertical pressure and energy\nbalance. Star formation feedback injects energy and momentum, and\nnon-axisymmetric torques prevent the gas from becoming more than marginally\ngravitationally unstable. From these assumptions we derive the relationship\nbetween galaxies' bulk properties (gas surface density, stellar content, and\nrotation curve) and their star formation rates, gas velocity dispersions, and\nrates of radial inflow. We show that the turbulence in discs can be powered\nprimarily by star formation feedback, radial transport, or a combination of the\ntwo. In contrast to models that omit either radial transport or star formation\nfeedback, the predictions of this model yield excellent agreement with a wide\nrange of observations, including the star formation law measured in both\nspatially resolved and unresolved data, the correlation between galaxies' star\nformation rates and velocity dispersions, and observed rates of radial inflow.\nThe agreement holds across a wide range of galaxy mass and type, from local\ndwarfs to extreme starbursts to high-redshifts discs. We apply the model to\ngalaxies on the star-forming main sequence, and show that it predicts a\ntransition from mostly gravity-driven turbulence at high redshift to star\nformation-driven turbulence at low redshift. This transition, and the changes\nin mass transport rates that it produces, naturally explain why galaxy bulges\ntend to form at high redshift and discs at lower redshift, and why galaxies\ntend to quench inside-out. \n\n"}

The HII region RCW 36, located in the Vela molecular\nridge, contains a young star cluster with two O-type stars. We present new CO\nobservations of RCW 36 with NANTEN2, Mopra, and ASTE using $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0,\n2-1, 3-2) and $^{13}$CO($J$ = 2-1) line emissions. We have discovered two\nmolecular clouds lying at the velocities $V_\\mathrm{LSR} \\sim$5.5 and 9 km\ns$^{-1}$. Both clouds are likely to be physically associated with the star\ncluster, as verified by the good spatial correspondence among the two clouds,\ninfrared filaments, and the star cluster. We also found a high intensity ratio\nof $\\sim$0.6-1.2 for CO $J$ = 3-2 / 1-0 toward both clouds, indicating that the\ngas temperature has been increased due to heating by the O-type stars. We\npropose that the O-type stars in RCW 36 were formed by a collision between the\ntwo clouds, with a relative velocity separation of 5 km s$^{-1}$. The\ncomplementary spatial distributions and the velocity separation of the two\nclouds are in good agreement with observational signatures expected for O-type\nstar formation triggered by a cloud-cloud collision. We also found a\ndisplacement between the complementary spatial distributions of the two clouds,\nwhich we estimate to be 0.3 pc assuming the collision angle to be 45$^{\\circ}$\nrelative to the line-of-sight. We estimate the collision timescale to be\n$\\sim$10$^5$ yr. It is probable that the cluster age by Ellerbroek et al.\n(2013b) is dominated by the low-mass members which were not formed under the\ntriggering by cloud-cloud collision, and that the O-type stars in the center of\nthe cluster are explained by the collisional triggering independently from the\nlow-mass star formation. \n\n"}

In self-consistently turbulent\nscenarios the ratio of filament to initial cloud magnetic energy densities is\n~1. The effect of Gaussian velocity fields is bound to the turbulence Mach\nnumber: Supersonic velocities trigger a rapid cloud expansion; subsonic\nvelocities only have a minor impact. The role of turbulent magnetic fields\ndepends on their tension and is similar to the effect of radiative losses: the\nstronger the magnetic field or the softer the gas equation of state, the\ngreater the magnetic shielding at wind-filament interfaces and the suppression\nof Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.

A white noise power spectral density (PSD) is expected at low\nfrequency in this model, however, direct observational constraint to the low\nfrequency PSD slope is hard due to limited lengths of the light curves\navailable.

We demonstrate this by\nfirst calculating the angle-dependence rotational damping and excitation\ncoefficients by photon absorption followed by infrared emission. We then\ncalculate the degree of PAH alignment for the different environments and\nphysical parameters, including the illumination direction, ionization fraction,\nand magnetic field strength. For the reflection nebula (RN) conditions with\nunidirectional radiation field, we find that the degree of alignment tends to\nincrease with increasing the angle $\\psi$ between the illumination direction\nand the magnetic field, as a result of the decrease of the cross-section of\nphoton absorption with $\\psi$.

In this paper, we carry out a suite of N-body simulations of\nequal-mass galaxy collisions, varying the initial orbits and density profiles\nfor the merging galaxies and running simulations both with and without central\nMBHs.

The O VI profile mimics weak low-ionization profiles at\nlow velocities, and strong saturated profiles at high velocities. These trends\nindicate that O VI gas is co-spatial with the low-ionization gas. Further, at\nvelocities blueward of -200 km/s the column density of the low-ionization\noutflow rapidly drops while the O VI column density rises, suggesting that O VI\nis created as the low-ionization gas is destroyed.

The dark\nmatter particle candidates are axion-like, with masses of order eV and strong\nself-interactions. They Bose-Einstein condense into a superfluid phase in the\ncentral regions of galaxy halos. The superfluid phonon excitations in turn\ncouple to baryons and mediate an additional long-range force. For a suitable\nchoice of the superfluid equation of state, this force can mimic Milgrom's law.\nIn this paper we develop in detail some of the main phenomenological\nconsequences of such a formalism, by revisiting the expected dark matter halo\nprofile in the presence of an extended baryon distribution. In particular, we\nshow how rotation curves of both high and low surface brightness galaxies can\nbe reproduced, with a slightly rising rotation curve at large radii in massive\nhigh surface brightness galaxies, thus subtly different from Milgrom's law. We\nfinally point out other expected differences with Milgrom's law, in particular\nin dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies, tidal dwarf galaxies, and globular\nclusters, whose Milgromian or Newtonian behavior depends on the position with\nrespect to the superfluid core of the host galaxy. We also expect ultra-diffuse\ngalaxies within galaxy clusters to have velocities slightly above the baryonic\nTully-Fisher relation. Finally, we note that, in this framework, photons and\ngravitons follow the same geodesics, and that galaxy-galaxy lensing, probing\nlarger distances within galaxy halos than rotation curves, should follow\npredictions closer to the standard cosmological model than those of Milgrom's\nlaw. \n\n"}

In order to investigate why red quasars are red, we studied optical and\nNIR spectra of 20 red quasars at $z\\sim$0.3 and 0.7, where the usage of the NIR\nspectra allowed us to look into red quasar properties in ways that are little\naffected by dust extinction. The Paschen to Balmer line ratios were derived for\n13 red quasars and the values were found to be $\\sim$10 times higher than\nunobscured type 1 quasars, suggesting a heavy dust extinction with $A_V > 2.5$\nmag.

By running a control-simulation in which\nAGN feedback is switched-off, we identify AGN feedback as the primary mechanism\naffecting the build-up of the stellar component of radio galaxies, thus\nexplaining the different environment in radio galaxies and their radio-quiet\ncounterparts.

However, this\nmethod is limited by degeneracies between the density profile of dark matter\nand the stellar mass-to-light ratio. In this work we reduce this degeneracy by\ncombining weak lensing together with strong lensing and stellar kinematics. Our\nanalysis is based on two galaxy samples: 45 strong lenses from the SLACS survey\nand 1,700 massive quiescent galaxies from the SDSS main spectroscopic sample\nwith weak lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. We use a\nBayesian hierarchical approach to jointly model all three observables. We fit\nthe data with models of varying complexity and show that a model with a radial\ngradient in the stellar mass-to-light ratio is required to simultaneously\ndescribe both galaxy samples. This result is driven by a subset of strong\nlenses with very steep total density profile, that cannot be fitted by models\nwith no gradient. Our measurements are unable to determine whether $M_*/L$\ngradients are due to variations in stellar population parameters at fixed IMF,\nor to gradients in the IMF itself. The inclusion of $M_*/L$ gradients decreases\ndramatically the inferred IMF normalisation, compared to previous lensing-based\nstudies, with the exact value depending on the assumed dark matter profile. The\nmain effect of strong lensing selection is to shift the stellar mass\ndistribution towards the high mass end, while the halo mass and stellar IMF\ndistribution at fixed stellar mass are not significantly affected. \n\n"}

Its mass and size are then increased adiabatically while\nits position, velocity, and orientation are determined from rigid-body\ndynamics. At z = 1, the rigid disc is replaced by an N-body disc whose\nparticles sample a three-integral distribution function (DF). The simulation\nthen proceeds to z = 0 with live disc and halo particles. By comparison, other\nmethods assume one or more of the following: the centre of the rigid disc\nduring the growth phase is pinned to the minimum of the halo potential, the\norientation of the rigid disc is fixed, or the live N-body disc is constructed\nfrom a two rather than three-integral DF.

In our numerical implementation, star formation and SN feedback\nare self-consistently treated and well resolved in the multiphase, turbulent,\nmagnetized interstellar medium. Bursts of star formation produce spatially and\ntemporally correlated SNe that drive strong outflows, consisting of hot\n(T>5x10^5K) winds and warm (5050K < T < 2x10^4K) fountains. The hot gas at\ndistance d>1kpc from the midplane has mass and energy fluxes nearly constant\nwith d. The hot flow escapes our local Cartesian box barely affected by gravity\nand is expected to accelerate up to the terminal velocity of\nv_wind~350-500km/s.

We consider both UV and X-ray\nemission from an accreting BH to simulate its radiative feedback. The selected\nhalo has a mass of $\\rm 3 \\times 10^{10}~M_{\\odot}$ at $z=7.5$ and we turn on\nradiative feedback from a MBH seed of $\\rm 10^5~M_{\\odot}$ along with in-situ\nstar formation at $z=12$ when the halo mass reaches well above the atomic\ncooling limit.

The galaxy model in MOG has the\nsame initial conditions as in galaxy models with dark matter halo.

In order to\nconstrain the nature of the gas traced by OVI, we analyze additional\nobservables of the outer halo, namely HI to OVI column ratios of 1-10, an\nabsence of low-ion absorption, a mean differential extinction of E(B-V)~10^-3,\nand a linear relation between OVI column and velocity width. We contrast these\nobservations with two physical scenarios: (1) OVI traces high-pressure (~30\ncm^-3 K) collisionally-ionized gas cooling from a virially-shocked phase, and\n(2) OVI traces low-pressure (<~1 cm^-3 K) gas beyond the accretion shock, where\nthe gas is in ionization and thermal equilibrium with the UV background. We\ndemonstrate that the high-pressure scenario requires multiple gas phases to\nexplain the observations, and a large deposition of energy at >~100 kpc to\noffset the energy radiated by the cooling gas. In contrast, the low-pressure\nscenario can explain all considered observations with a single gas phase in\nthermal equilibrium, provided that the baryon overdensity is comparable to the\ndark-matter overdensity, and that the gas is enriched to >~Z_sun/3 with an\nISM-like dust-to-metal ratio.

The obtained image transversely resolves\nthe edge-brightened jet in 3C 84 only 30 microarcseconds from the core, which\nis ten times closer to the central engine than what has been possible in\nprevious ground-based observations, and it allows us to measure the jet\ncollimation profile from ~ 100 to ~10000 gravitational radii from the black\nhole.

We carry out two distinct analyses to test whether multiple\nstar-formation epochs have occurred within NGC 1978. First, we use UV CMDs to\nselect stars from the first and second population along the SGB, and then\ncompare their positions in optical CMDs, where the morphology is dominantly\ncontrolled by age as opposed to multiple population effects.

We find no correlation between the column density of NV and the\nneutral gas properties such as metallicity, HI column density and dust\ndepletion, however the relative velocity of NV, typically a blueshift with\nrespect to the neutral gas, is found to be correlated with the column density\nof HI. This may be explained if the NV gas is part of an HII region hosting the\nGRB, where the region's expansion is confined by dense, neutral gas in the\nGRB's host galaxy. We find tentative evidence (at 2-sigma significance) that\nthe X-ray derived column density, N_H,X, may be correlated with the column\ndensity of NV, which would indicate that both measurements are sensitive to the\ncolumn density of the gas located in the vicinity of the GRB. We investigate\nthe scenario where NV (and also OVI) is produced by recombination after the\ncorresponding atoms have been stripped entirely of their electrons by the\ninitial prompt emission, in contrast to previous models where highly-ionized\ngas is produced by photoionization from the GRB afterglow. \n\n"}

We present an improved postprocessing framework to estimate the\nabundance of atomic and molecular hydrogen and apply it to the IllustrisTNG\nsimulations. We compare five different models for the atomic-to-molecular\ntransition, including empirical, simulation-based, and theoretical\nprescriptions. Most of these models rely on the surface density of neutral\nhydrogen and the ultraviolet (UV) flux in the Lyman-Werner band as input\nparameters. Computing these quantities on the kiloparsec scales resolved by the\nsimulations emerges as the main challenge. We show that the commonly used Jeans\nlength approximation to the column density of a system can be biased and\nexhibits large cell-to-cell scatter. Instead, we propose to compute all surface\nquantities in face-on projections and perform the modeling in two dimensions.\nIn general, the two methods agree on average, but their predictions diverge for\nindividual galaxies and for models based on the observed midplane pressure of\ngalaxies. We model the UV radiation from young stars by assuming a constant\nescape fraction and optically thin propagation throughout the galaxy. With\nthese improvements, we find that the five models for the atomic-to-molecular\ntransition roughly agree on average but that the details of the modeling matter\nfor individual galaxies and the spatial distribution of molecular hydrogen.

Each AGN has been observed for\nat least five epochs between 1996 and 2017. We find that BL Lac objects have\ncore electric vector position angles (EVPAs) which tend towards alignment with\nthe local jet direction; compared to flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), their\nEVPAs are also less variable over time. The AGN cores which are most\nfractionally polarized and least variable in polarization have EVPAs that are\nclosely aligned with the local jet direction; they also have low variability in\nEVPA.

We combine observations and\nchemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to\nphysical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived.

The upper limits range between $\\sim 10^{11}$\nand $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical\nmodel matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at $r \\sim\n50-100$ au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets. The inferred high CS/SO and CS/SO$_2$ ratios require a non-solar C/O\ngas-phase ratio of > 1, consistent with the recent observations of hydrocarbon\nrings in DM Tau. The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to\nCS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau\nand points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas. \n\n"}

However, it remains relatively unexplored because dense\nmolecular gas tracers like HCN and HCO+ are faint in low metallicity systems.\nWe present Green Bank Telescope observations of HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) on giant\nmolecular cloud (34pc) scales in the nearby low metallicity ($12+\\log({\\rm\nO/H})=8.2$) starburst IC 10 and compare them to those in other galaxies.

The Halpha star formers, drawn from the highly spatially complete\nGalaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, show an increase in clustering on small\nseparations.

We address this problem by constructing a\nsample of more than 80,000 colour-selected AGN from redshift z=0 to 7.5. While\nthis sample is composed of multiple data sets with spectroscopic redshifts and\ncompleteness estimates, we homogenise these data sets to identical cosmologies,\nintrinsic AGN spectra, and magnitude systems. Using this sample, we derive the\nAGN UV luminosity function from redshift z=0 to 7.5. The luminosity function\nhas a double power law form at all redshifts. The break magnitude $M_*$ of the\nAGN luminosity function shows a steep brightening from $M_*\\sim -24$ at z=0.7\nto $M_*\\sim -29$ at z=6. The faint-end slope $\\beta$ significantly steepens\nfrom $-1.7$ at $z<2.2$ to $-2.4$ at $z\\simeq 6$.

We incorporated\nhigh-resolution X-ray and mid-IR spectroscopy, combined with broad-band\ncontinuum modelling, to investigate the properties of dust in this AGN. We used\nnew Chandra HETGS observations taken in June 2017, as well as archival data\nfrom XMM-Newton, Swift, HST, Spitzer, IRAS, and Herschel for our\nIR-optical-UV-X-ray modelling. Two distinct components of dust in IC 4329A are\nfound. One component is in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy,\nand the other is a nuclear component in the AGN torus and its associated wind.\nThe emitting dust in the torus is evident in mid-IR emission (9.7 and 18 micron\nfeatures), while dust in the wind is present through both reddening and X-ray\nabsorption (O, Si, and Fe edge features). The gas depletion factors into dust\nfor O, Si, and Fe are measured. We derive an intrinsic reddening E(B-V) ~ 1.0,\nwhich is most consistent with a grey (flat) extinction law. The AGN wind\nconsists of three ionisation components. From analysis of long-term changes in\nthe wind, we determine limits on the location of the wind components. The two\nlowest ionisation components are likely carriers of dust from the AGN torus. We\nfind that the dust in the nuclear component of IC 4329A is different from dust\nin the Milky Way. The dust grains in the AGN torus and wind are likely larger\nthan the standard Galactic dust, and are in a porous composite form (containing\namorphous silicate with iron and oxygen).

We confirm the intrinsic Baldwin Effect and brighter-means-bluer\ntrends in which emission line strength and color are associated with changes in\nluminosity. We then create a composite differential spectrum that captures the\nwavelength dependence of quasar variability as a function of change in\nluminosity. When using a bandpass around 1740 \\AA\\ to describe the luminosity,\nthe differential spectrum follows a power law at longer wavelengths that breaks\nblueward of 1700 \\AA. However, the shape of the differential spectrum, the\nlocation of the power law break, and the slope of the intrinsic Baldwin Effect\nall vary with the choice of bandpass used to define the change in quasar\nluminosity. We propose that the observed behavior can be explained by\ninhomogeneous accretion or slim accretion disk models where delays in the\nreprocessing of incident light on the accretion disk cause local deviations in\ntemperature from the thin disk model.

In dense magnetized molecular clouds where C-shocks are\npresent, PAHs and nanoparticles are widely believed to originate from grain\nshattering due to grain-grain collisions. The remaining question is whether\nthese nanoparticles can survive in the dense and hot shocked regions, and how\nto constrain their size and abundance with observations. In this paper, we\npresent a new mechanism to destroy nanoparticles in C-shocks based on\ncentrifugal stress within rapidly spinning nanoparticles spun-up by stochastic\natomic bombardment, which is termed rotational disruption. We find that, due to\nsupersonic neutral gas-charged grain drift in C-shocks, nanoparticles can be\nspun-up to suprathermal rotation by stochastic torques exerted by supersonic\nneutral flow. The resulting centrifugal stress within suprathermally rotating\nnanoparticles can exceed the maximum tensile strength of grain material\n($S_{\\max}$), resulting in rapid disruption of nanoparticles smaller than\n$a\\sim 1$ nm for $S_{\\max}\\sim 10^{9}\\erg\\cm^{-3}$.

This process can repeat several times and lead to\nsignificant mass growth. In this paper, we calculate the mass of the largest BH\nthat can be formed through repeated mergers of stellar seed BHs and determine\nhow its value depends on the physical properties of the host cluster. We adopt\nan analytical model in which the energy generated by the black hole binaries in\nthe cluster core is assumed to be regulated by the process of two-body\nrelaxation in the bulk of the system. This principle is used to compute the\nhardening rate of the binaries and to relate this to the time-dependent global\nproperties of the parent cluster. We demonstrate that in clusters with initial\nescape velocity $\\gtrsim 300\\rm km\\ s^{-1}$ in the core and density $\\gtrsim\n10^5\\ M_\\odot\\rm pc^{-3}$, repeated mergers lead to the formation of BHs in the\nmass range $100-10^5 \\,M_\\odot$, populating any upper mass gap created by\npair-instability supernovae.

We focus in particular on the comparison between\nthe original SPARC parameters, with constant mass-to-light ratios for bulges\nand disks, and the parameters for which galaxies follow the tightest radial\nacceleration relation. We show that fits are improved in the second case, and\nthat the pure halo scaling relations also become tighter. We report that the\ndensity at the radius where the slope is -2 is strongly anticorrelated to this\nradius, and to the Einasto index. The latter is close to unity for a large\nnumber of galaxies, indicative of large cores. In terms of dark matter-baryon\nscalings, we focus on relations between the core properties and the extent of\nthe baryonic component, which are relevant to the cusp-core transformation\nprocess. We report a positive correlation between the core size of halos with\nsmall Einasto index and the stellar disk scale-length, as well as between the\naveraged dark matter density within 2 kpc and the baryon-induced rotational\nvelocity at that radius. This finding is related to the consequence of the\nradial acceleration relation on the diversity of rotation curve shapes,\nquantified by the rotational velocity at 2 kpc. While a tight radial\nacceleration relation slightly decreases the observed diversity compared to the\noriginal SPARC parameters, the diversity of baryon-induced accelerations at 2\nkpc is sufficient to induce a large diversity, incompatible with current\nhydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, while maintaining a tight\nradial acceleration relation. \n\n"}

In this paper, we present results from a set of\ncosmological simulations of regions of the Universe with different streaming\nvelocities performed with the moving mesh code AREPO. Our simulations have very\nhigh mass resolution, enabling us to accurately resolve minihaloes as small as\n$10^5 \\: {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$. We show that in the absence of streaming, the least\nmassive halo that contains cold gas has a mass $M_{\\rm halo, min} = 5 \\times\n10^{5} \\: {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$, but that cooling only becomes efficient in a\nmajority of haloes for halo masses greater than $M_{\\rm halo,50\\%} = 1.6 \\times\n10^6 \\: {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$. In regions with non-zero streaming velocities,\n$M_{\\rm halo, min}$ and $M_{\\rm halo,50\\%}$ both increase significantly, by\naround a factor of a few for each one sigma increase in the value of the local\nstreaming velocity. As a result, in regions with streaming velocities\n$v_\\mathrm{stream} \\ge 3\\,\\sigma_\\mathrm{rms}$, cooling of gas in minihaloes is\ncompletely suppressed, implying that the first stars in these regions form\nwithin atomic cooling haloes. \n\n"}

This system was first discovered in the Arecibo\nLegacy Fast ALFA HI survey and was cataloged as an (almost) dark galaxy because\nit did not exhibit any obvious optical counterpart in the available survey data\n(e.g., Sloan Digital Sky Survey). Subsequent WIYN pODI imaging revealed an\nultra-low SB stellar component located at the center of the HI detection. We\nuse the HST images to produce a deep color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of the\nresolved stellar population present in Coma P. We clearly detect a red stellar\nsequence that we interpret to be a red giant branch, and use it to infer a tip\nof the red giant branch (TRGB) distance of 5.50$^{+0.28}_{-0.53}$ Mpc. The new\ndistance is substantially lower than earlier estimates and shows that Coma P is\nan extreme dwarf galaxy. Our derived stellar mass is only 4.3 $\\times$ 10$^5$\n$M_\\odot$, meaning that Coma P has an extreme HI-to-stellar mass ratio of 81.\nWe present a detailed analysis of the galaxy environment within which Coma P\nresides. We hypothesize that Coma P formed within a local void and has spent\nmost of its lifetime in a low-density environment. Over time, the gravitational\nattraction of the galaxies located in the void wall has moved it to the edge,\nwhere it had a recent \"fly-by\" interaction with M64. We investigate the\npossibility that Coma P is at a farther distance and conclude that the\navailable data are best fit by a distance of 5.5 Mpc. \n\n"}

Remnants from supermassive stars\n(SMSs) with masses around 10,000 solar masses provide the ideal seed\ncandidates, known as direct collapse black holes. However, their very existence\nand formation environment in the early Universe are still under debate, with\ntheir supposed rarity further exacerbating the problem of modeling their\nab-initio formation. SMS models have shown that rapid collapse, with an infall\nrate above a critical value, in metal-free haloes is a requirement for the\nformation of a proto-stellar core which will then form an SMS. Using a\nradiation hydrodynamics simulation of early galaxy formation, we show the\nnatural emergence of metal-free haloes both massive enough, and with\nsufficiently high infall rates, to form an SMS. We find that haloes that are\nexposed to both a Lyman-Werner intensity of J_LW ~ 3 J_21 and that undergo at\nleast one period of rapid growth early in their evolution are ideal cradles for\nSMS formation. This rapid growth induces substantial dynamical heating,\namplifying the existing Lyman-Werner suppression originating from a group of\nyoung galaxies 20 kiloparsecs away. Our results strongly indicate that\nstructure formation dynamics, rather than a critical Lyman-Werner (LW) flux,\nmay be the main driver of massive black hole formation in the early Universe.\nWe find that massive black hole seeds may be much more common in overdense\nregions of the early Universe than previously considered with a comoving number\ndensity up to 10^-3 Mpc^-3. \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.07571", "contents": "Title: Near-Field Cosmology with the Lowest-Mass Galaxies Abstract: The premise of \"near-field cosmology\" is that the study of nearby low-mass\ngalaxies on a star-by-star basis has implications that extend far beyond the\nlocal Universe and include the nature of dark matter, lives and deaths of the\nfirst stars, cosmic reionization, and galaxy formation across cosmic time. In\nresponse to the Astro2020 call for science white papers, we provide a\nhigh-level synopsis of several major questions in near-field cosmology, the\npotential for transformative progress in the next decade and beyond, and\nmechanisms for achieving these goals. Our recommendations include: (i)\nobtaining kinematic information from large samples of individual line-of-sight\nand transverse velocities of stars and from spatially resolved gas observations\nin nearby dwarf galaxies to directly inform our understanding of dark matter\ninteractions in the deeply nonlinear regime; and (ii) an intensive program of\noptical imaging and UV and optical spectroscopy of resolved stars in low-mass\ngalaxies, including low-metallicity massive stars and HII regions (which are\ncentral to understanding faint galaxies at all earlier epochs). Realizing these\naims requires a large aperture ($\\gtrsim 9$m) UV/optical space telescope, a\ntwo-fold community investment in ground-based optical spectroscopy through both\nELTs and a dedicated wide-field spectroscopic survey on a 10m class telescope,\nand radio facilities that can measure high-precision, spatially resolved\nrotation curves of low-mass galaxies. Finally, we suggest that a servicing\nmission to extend the life of HST beyond 2025 should be seriously explored. \n\n"}

The jet consists of a pair of\n$\\sim$0.15 pc segments on either side of MWC~922 separated by gaps. The most\ndistant jet segments disappear $\\sim$0.6 pc from the star. The northwest beam\npoints to a faint emission-line feature 1.65 pc from MWC~922 that may be a\nterminal bow shock where the jet rams the ambient medium. The narrow\nopening-angle of the jet combined with an estimated internal sound speed of\n$\\sim$10 \\kms\\ implies a jet speed $\\sim$500 \\kms . The previously detected\nnebula extends up to 0.6~pc to the southwest of MWC~922 at right angles to the\njet and appears to be an extension of the compact, edge-on disk surrounding the\nstar. It points toward the HII region Messier 16 located $\\sim$1\\degr\\\n($\\sim$30 pc in projection) to the southwest.

The very high accretion rate makes it\npossible that massive black holes hosted in xA quasars radiate at a stable,\nextreme luminosity-to-mass ratio. This in turns translates into stable physical\nand dynamical conditions of the mildly ionized gas in the quasar low-ionization\nline emitting region. In this contribution, we analyze the main optical and UV\nspectral properties of extreme Population A quasars that make them easily\nidentifiable in large spectroscopic surveys at low-z (z < 1) and intermediate-z\n(2 < z < 2.6), and the physical conditions that are derived for the formation\nof their emission lines. Ultimately, the analysis supports the possibility of\nidentifying a virial broadening estimator from low-ionization line widths, and\nthe conceptual validity of the redshift-independent luminosity estimates based\non virial broadening for a known luminosity-to-mass ratio. \n\n"}

In this paper we take a short tour through the SN\ndiversity and discuss some important, physical issues related to it. Because of\nthe role of SN Ia in determining the cosmological parameters, it is crucial to\nunderstand the physical origin of even subtle, observed differences. An\nimportant issue is also the reddening correction. We belive that the measure of\ninterstellar lines on medium resolution spectra of SNe can be used to derive\nlower limits on the interstellar extinction. A few physical parameters of the\nprogenitor, namely radius, mass, density structure and angular momentum, may\nexplain most of the diversity of core-collapse events. In addition, if the\nejecta expand into a dense circumstellar medium the ejecta-CSM interaction may\ndominate the observed outcome and provide a mean to probe the mass loss history\nof the SN progenitor in the last stages of its evolution. \n\n"}
