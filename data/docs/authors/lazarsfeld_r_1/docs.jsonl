The theory dramatically simplifies in this limit, because the\ncorrelation functions of all, not only topological (or BPS), observables may be\ncomputed explicitly in terms of integrals over finite-dimensional moduli spaces\nof instanton configurations. In Part I (arXiv:hep-th/0610149) we discussed in\ndetail the one-dimensional (that is, quantum mechanical) models of this type.\nHere we analyze the supersymmetric two-dimensional sigma models and\nfour-dimensional Yang--Mills theory, using the one-dimensional models as a\nprototype. We go beyond the topological (or BPS) sectors of these models and\nconsider them as full-fledged quantum field theories. We study in detail the\nspace of states and find that the Hamiltonian is not diagonalizable, but has\nJordan blocks. This leads to the appearance of logarithms in the correlation\nfunctions. We find that our theories are in fact logarithmic conformal field\ntheories (theories of this type are of interest in condensed matter physics).\nWe define jet-evaluation observables and consider in detail their correlation\nfunctions. They are given by integrals over the moduli spaces of holomorphic\nmaps, which generalize the Gromov--Witten invariants. These integrals generally\ndiverge and require regularization, leading to an intricate logarithmic mixing\nof the operators of the sigma model.

We study this problem for $r$ points\nin the plane over an algebraically closed field $k$ of arbitrary characteristic\nin case either $r \\le 8$ or the points lie on a (possibly reducible) conic.

Abstract: Searching for structural reasons behind old results and conjectures of\nChudnovksy regarding the least degree of a nonzero form in an ideal of fat\npoints in projective N-space, we make conjectures which explain them, and we\nprove the conjectures in certain cases, including the case of general points in\nthe projective plane. Our conjectures were also partly motivated by the\nEisenbud-Mazur Conjecture on evolutions, which concerns symbolic squares of\nprime ideals in local rings, but in contrast we consider higher symbolic powers\nof homogeneous ideals in polynomial rings. \n\n"}

It is classically realized as a closed\nsubscheme of a Grassmannian or a product of Grassmannians. In this paper we\nconsider schemes over a field $k$ of characteristic zero and we present a new\nproof of the existence of the Hilbert scheme as a subscheme of the Grassmannian\n$\\mathbf{Gr}_{p(r)}^{N(r)}$, where $N(r)= h^0 (\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^n}(r))$.\nMoreover, we exhibit explicit equations defining it in the Pl\\\"ucker\ncoordinates of the Pl\\\"ucker embedding of $\\mathbf{Gr}_{p(r)}^{N(r)}$. Our\nproof of existence does not need some of the classical tools used in previous\nproofs, as flattening stratifications and Gotzmann's Persistence Theorem. The\ndegree of our equations is $\\text{deg} p(t)+2$, lower than the degree of the\nequations given by Iarrobino and Kleiman in 1999 and also lower (except for the\ncase of hypersurfaces) than the degree of those proved by Haiman and Sturmfels\nin 2004 after Bayer's conjecture in 1982.

Themes correspond to asymptotic expansion of\na given vanishing period, so to the image of a fresco in the module of\nasymptotic expansions.

We moreover give\nexplicit formulas for algebraic connections on a class of finitely generated\nprojective modules on ellipsoid surfaces. The connections we construct are\nnon-flat with trace of curvature equal to zero. We construct these formulas\nusing an idempotent matrix $M$ defining the module $E$. Such an idempotent\nmatrix $M$ is constructed from a \"projective basis\" $B$ defining the module\n$E$. Associated to a projective basis $B$ for $E$ we construct a connection\n$\\nabla_B$.

For example, the multiplicity of an ideal is used\nto count points of intersection of two analytic sets at points of\nnon-transverse intersection. A problem with the multiplicity of an ideal or\nmodule is that it is only defined for modules and ideals of finite colength.\n  In this paper we use pairs of modules and their multiplicities as a way\naround this difficulty. A key tool is the multiplicity-polar theorem which\napplies to families of pairs of modules, linking the multiplicity at a general\npair of the family to the multiplicity of the pair at the special fiber.\n  The specific problem we work on is:\n  Suppose X,0 is an equidimensional complex analytic set in C^n, and T^*_X(C^n)\nis the closure of the conormal vectors to the smooth part of X, s, a section of\nT^*(C^n), the cotangent bundle of C^n restricted to X. Suppose the intersection\nof the image of s, denoted im(s), with T^*_X(C^n) is isolated. Then we\ncalculate the intersection multiplicity im(s)\\cdot T^*_X(C^n) using the\nmultiplicity of pairs.

Our aim is to\ncontribute to the general theory of nilpotent pairs. Roughly speaking, a\nnilpotent pair (e_1,e_2) consists of two commuting elements in \\g that can\nindependently be contracted to the origin. A principal nilpotent pair is a\ndouble counterpart of a regular nilpotent element. Consequently, the theory of\nnilpotent pairs should stand out as double counterpart of the theory of\nnilpotent orbits. We show that any nilpotent pair has a characteristic\n(h_1,h_2), which is unique within to conjugacy. Generalizing Dynkin's approach\nto (sl_2)-triples, we prove that the number of G-orbits of characteristics of\nnilpotent pairs is finite and provide some estimates for the numerical labels\n\\alpha_j(h_i), where {\\alpha_j} are suitable simple roots of \\g.

This implies that there are finitely many G-orbits of wonderful\npairs. A number of nice properties of wonderful pairs shows that these can be\nregarded as right double analogue of nilpotent orbits.
