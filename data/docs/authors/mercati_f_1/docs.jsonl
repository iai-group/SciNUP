Abstract: At present, there are two possible, and equally plausible, explanations for\nthe physics of quantum measurement. The first explanation, known as the\nmany-worlds interpretation, does not require any modification of quantum\nmechanics, and asserts that at the time of measurement the Universe splits into\nmany branches, one branch for every possible alternative. The various branches\ndo not interfere with each other because of decoherence, thus providing a\npicture broadly consistent with the observed Universe. The second explanation,\nwhich requires quantum mechanics to be modified from its presently known form,\nis that at the time of measurement the wave-function collapses into one of the\npossible alternatives. The two explanations are mutually exclusive, and up\nuntil now, no theoretical reasoning has been put forward to choose one\nexplanation over the other. In this article, we provide an argument which\nimplies that the collapse interpretation is favored over the many-worlds\ninterpretation. Our starting point is the assertion (which we justify) that\nthere ought to exist a reformulation of quantum mechanics which does not refer\nto a classical spacetime manifold. The need for such a reformulation implies\nthat quantum theory becomes non-linear on the Planck mass/energy scale.\nStandard linear quantum mechanics is an approximation to this non-linear\ntheory, valid at energy scales much smaller than the Planck scale. Using ideas\nbased on noncommutative differential geometry, we develop such a reformulation\nand derive a non-linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, which can explain collapse of\nthe wave-function.

We link the\nTully-Fisher-Milgrom relation of spiral galaxies (or MOND) with the\nrelativistic pressure of the neutrino dark fluid without modifying Einsteinian\ngravity. \n\n"}

The summation formula\nfor the series over the zeros of the Bessel function, previously discussed in\nthe literature, is obtained as a limiting case. The Wightman function for a\nscalar field with general curvature coupling parameter is considered inside a\nspherical boundary on background of constant negative curvature space. The\ncorresponding mode sum contains series over the zeros of the associated\nLegendre function. The application of the summation formula allows us to\npresent the Wightman function in the form of the sum of two integrals. The\nfirst one corresponds to the Wightman function for the bulk geometry without\nboundaries and the second one is induced by the presence of the spherical\nshell. For points away from the boundary the latter is finite in the\ncoincidence limit.

The latter\ninvolves point-like brane defects (D-particles), which provide the\ntopologically non-trivial foamy structures of space-time. A stochastic Langevin\nequation for the velocity recoil of D-particles can be derived from the pinched\napproximation for a sum over genera in the calculation of the partition\nfunction of a bosonic string in the presence of heavy D-particles. The string\ncoupling in standard perturbation theory is related to the exponential of the\nexpectation of the dilaton. Inclusion of fluctuations of the dilaton itself and\nuncertainties in the string background will then necessitate fluctuations in\n$g_{s}$. The fluctuation in the string coupling in the sum over genera\ntypically leads to a generic structure of the Langevin equation where the\ncoefficient of the noise term, dependent on the string coupling $g_{s}$,\nfluctuates.

In\nrecent years there has been considerable controversy on this issue.

We first clarify that such dramatically different\npredictions can arise because the required measure on the space of solutions is\nintrinsically ambiguous in general relativity.

This creates a\nproblem: why is the universe atypical? We suggest that the problem is an\nartefact created by inappropriate transfer of the traditional concept of\nentropy to the whole universe. Use of what we call the relational $N$-body\nproblem as a model indicates the need to employ two distinct entropy-type\nconcepts to describe the universe. One, which we call entaxy, is novel. It is\nscale-invariant and decreases as the observable universe evolves. The other is\nthe algebraic sum of the dimensionful entropies of branch systems (isolated\nsubsystems of the universe). This conventional additive entropy increases. In\nour model, the decrease of entaxy is fundamental and makes possible the\nemergence of branch systems and their increasing entropy. We have previously\nshown that all solutions of our model divide into two halves at a unique `Janus\npoint' of maximum disorder. This constitutes a common past for two futures each\nwith its own gravitational arrow of time. We now show that these arrows are\nexpressed through the formation of branch systems within which conventional\nentropy increases. On either side of the Janus point, this increase is in the\nsame direction in every branch system. We also show that it is only possible to\nspecify unbiased solution-determining data at the Janus point. Special\nproperties of these `mid-point data' make it possible to develop a rational\ntheory of the typicality of universes whose governing law, as in our model,\ndictates the presence of a Janus point in every solution. If our\nself-gravitating universe is governed by such a law, then the second law of\nthermodynamics is a necessary direct consequence of it and does not need any\nspecial initial condition. \n\n"}

In fact, an h --> tau mu decay rate at a level\nindicated by the CMS measurement is easily realized if the muon and electron\nmasses are due to a new source of EWSB, while the tau mass is due to the Higgs.\nWe illustrate this with two examples: a two Higgs doublet model, and a model in\nwhich the Higgs is partially composite, with EWSB triggered by a technicolor\nsector.

For energy densities\nhigher than the new mass scale of the theory, a gravitating dust component is\nshown to generically induce an accelerated expansion of the Universe. Within\nsuch a simple scenario, inflation gracefully exits when the GR regime is\nrecovered, but the Universe would remain matter dominated. In order to\nimplement a reheating era after inflation, we then consider inflation to be\ndriven by a mixture of unstable dust species decaying into radiation. Because\nthe speed of sound gravitates within the Born-Infeld model under consideration,\nour scenario ends up being predictive on various open questions of the\ninflationary paradigm. The total number of e-folds of acceleration is given by\nthe lifetime of the unstable dust components and is related to the duration of\nreheating. As a result, inflation does not last much longer than the number of\ne-folds of deceleration allowing a small spatial curvature and large scale\ndeviations to isotropy to be observable today. Energy densities are\nself-regulated as inflation can only start for a total energy density less than\na threshold value, again related to the species' lifetime.

It has been argued that this is an\nanalogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves\n(CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that\nfulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent\nliterature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework\nof quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag\nand Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states\nwhich are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for\na certain class of processes and initial conditions. On the other hand, if a\nquantum field theory admits sufficiently many uncorrelated states across\nacausally related spacetime regions (as implied by the split property), then\nthe D-CTC condition can always be fulfilled approximately to arbitrary\nprecision.

A simple case considering the thermal\nequilibrium between the Schwarzschild black hole and radiation gas in an\nisolated box has been well investigated previously in detail, i.e. taking the\nconservation of energy and principle of maximal entropy for the isolated system\ninto account.

This opens the door to\nanother way of finding gravitons. The most basic form of an interaction is the\nfirst order Fermi acceleration (deceleration) of a laser photon as it is\nreflected by a test mass mirror oscillating in the gravitational wave,\nresulting in a frequency blueshift (redshift) of the photon depending on\nwhether the mirror is advancing towards (receding from) the photon before the\nreflection.

These\nalgebras represent the centrepiece of the kinematics of special relativity (and\nits analogue in (Anti-)de Sitter spacetime), and provide the simplest framework\nto build physical models in which inertial observers are equivalent. Such a\nproperty can be expected to be preserved by Quantum Gravity, a theory which\nshould build a length/energy scale into the microscopic structure of spacetime.\nQuantum groups, and their infinitesimal version `Lie bialgebras', allow to\nencode such a scale into a noncommutativity of the algebra of functions over\nthe group (and over spacetime, when the group acts on a homogeneous space).

A similar phenomenon appears when one considers an Einsteinian\nblack hole and a shell of matter placed at some distance from it, so that\nastrophysical estimates could be made for the allowed mass of the black hole\nenvironment. While echoes for both systems have been extensively studied\nrecently, no such analysis has been done for a system featuring phenomena\nsimultaneously, that is, echoes due to new physics near the surface/event\nhorizon and echoes due to matter at some distance from the black hole.

At hadron colliders,\nQCD predictions are obtained by convoluting perturbative parton-level results\nwith non-perturbative PDFs, whose precise determination is crucial to reach\npercent-accurate theoretical predictions. At the parton level, cross sections\nare obtained through a perturbative expansion in the strong coupling. In some\ncases, large terms appear at all orders and spoil the convergence of the\nseries. The perturbative description is rescued by resumming the series to all\norders, thereby making theory calculations accurate in regions where a\nfixed-order treatment is not sufficient. In this thesis I first present two\nglobal PDF sets where fixed-order calculations are supplemented by threshold\nand high-energy resummation, respectively. In the first case, it is found that\nincluding resummation into PDFs can compensate for the enhancement in the\npartonic cross sections, with implications for high-mass resonance searches. In\nthe second case, resummation quantitatively improves the description of the\nHERA structure functions, thus providing evidence of the onset of a new\ndynamical regime of QCD in the HERA data.

This is achieved in flat spacetime by studying\neikonal scattering of higher spin particles in more than three spacetime\ndimensions.

We show first how the same set of\nhistories can be relabeled in various ways, including the use of the Heisenberg\nequations of motion and of passive transformations of field variables. In the\nthe usual approximate quantum mechanics of a measured subsystem, two\nobservables re- presented by different Hermitian operators are physically\ndistinguished by the different apparatus used to measure them. In the quantum\nmechanics of a closed system, however, any apparatus is part of the system and\nthe notion of physically distinct situations has a different character. We show\nthat a triple consisting of an initial condition, a Hamiltonian, and a set of\nhistories is physically equivalent to another triple if the operators\nrepresenting these initial conditions, Hamiltonians, and histories are related\nby any fixed unitary transformation. We apply this result to the question of\nwhether the universe might exhibit physically inequivalent quasiclassical\nrealms (which we earlier called quasiclassical domains), not just the one that\nincludes familiar experience.

The framework is formulated in terms of two scalar meson nonets (a\ntwo-quark nonet and a four-quark nonet) together with a scalar glueball. It is\nshown that while some properties of these states are sensitive to the mass of\nf0(600) and f0(1370), several relatively robust conclusions can be made: The\nf0(600), the f0(980), and the f0(1370) are admixtures of two and four quark\ncomponents, with f0(600) being dominantly a non-strange four-quark state, and\nf0(980) and f0(1370) having a dominant two-quark component. Similarly, the\nf0(1500) and the f0(1710) have considerable two and four quark admixtures, but\nin addition have a large glueball component.

Various recent theoretical frameworks indicate a\npossible window for non-Newtonian forces with gravitational coupling strength\nin the micrometre range. The major expected background in the same range is\nattributable to the Casimir force or variants of it if dielectric materials,\nrather than conducting ones, are considered. Here we review the measurements of\nthe Casimir force performed so far in the micrometre range and how they\ndetermine constraints on non-Newtonian gravitation, also discussing the\ndominant sources of false signals. We also propose a geometry-independent\nparameterization of all data in terms of the measurement of the constant c. Any\nCasimir force measurement should lead, once all corrections are taken into\naccount, to a determination of the constant c which, in order to assess the\naccuracy of the measurement, can be compared with its more precise value known\nthrough microscopic measurements. Although the last decade of experiments has\nresulted in solid demonstrations of the Casimir force, the situation is not\nconclusive with respect to being able to discover new physics.

The main feature of this new approach\nis to incorporate in a local sense the principle of general covariance of\ngeneral relativity, thus giving rise to the concept of a \"locally covariant\nquantum field theory\". Such locally covariant quantum field theories will be\ndescribed mathematically in terms of covariant functors between the categories,\non one side, of globally hyperbolic spacetimes with isometric embeddings as\nmorphisms and, on the other side, of *-algebras with unital injective\n*-endomorphisms as morphisms. Moreover, locally covariant quantum fields can be\ndescribed in this framework as natural transformations between certain\nfunctors. The usual Haag-Kastler framework of nets of operator-algebras over a\nfixed spacetime background-manifold, together with covariant automorphic\nactions of the isometry-group of the background spacetime, can be re-gained\nfrom this new approach as a special case. Examples of this new approach are\nalso outlined. In case that a locally covariant quantum field theory obeys the\ntime-slice axiom, one can naturally associate to it certain automorphic\nactions, called ``relative Cauchy-evolutions'', which describe the dynamical\nreaction of the quantum field theory to a local change of spacetime background\nmetrics. The functional derivative of a relative Cauchy-evolution with respect\nto the spacetime metric is found to be a divergence-free quantity which has, as\nwill be demonstrated in an example, the significance of an energy-momentum\ntensor for the locally covariant quantum field theory. Furthermore, we discuss\nthe functorial properties of state spaces of locally covariant quantum field\ntheories that entail the validity of the principle of local definiteness. \n\n"}
