The GW pulse is distorted by the gravitational effect of the\nself-energy residing in between these shells. We illustrate this distortion for\nGW pulses from the final plunge of black hole (BH) binaries, leading to the\nevolution of the GW profile as a function of the radial distance from the\nsource. The distortion depends on the total GW energy released and the duration\nof the emission, scaled by the total binary mass, M. The effect should be\nrelevant in finite box simulations where the waveforms are extracted within a\nradius of <~ 100M. For characteristic emission parameters at the final plunge\nbetween binary BHs of arbitrary spins, this effect could distort the simulated\nGW templates for LIGO and LISA by a fraction of 0.001.

The\n'concordance' LCDM model is still a good fit when there is just a 'step' in the\nspectrum. However if there is a 'bump' in the spectrum (due e.g. to two phase\ntransitions in rapid succession), the precision CMB data can be well-fitted by\na flat Einstein-de Sitter cosmology without dark energy.

The\nexperiment is exemplified here by an application of this concept to gravity\nwaves at the surface of an incompressible liquid in a basin of finite height,\nwith particular emphasis on the quantized vortex. We construct a complex wave\nfunction with the height of the fluid in the basin as its square modulus and\nthe velocity potential as its phase.

However, N-body\nsimulations show that dark matter halos grow through a mixture of smooth\naccretion, violent encounters and fragmentations, and modeling halo collapse as\nspherical, or even as ellipsoidal, is a significant oversimplification. We\npropose that some of the physical complications inherent to a realistic\ndescription of halo formation can be included in the excursion set theory\nframework, at least at an effective level, by taking into account that the\ncritical value for collapse is not a fixed constant $\\delta_c$, as in the\nspherical collapse model, nor a fixed function of the variance $\\sigma$ of the\nsmoothed density field, as in the ellipsoidal collapse model, but rather is\nitself a stochastic variable, whose scatter reflects a number of complicated\naspects of the underlying dynamics.

{"id": "0910.2490", "contents": "Title: Getting path integrals physically and technically right Abstract: Feynman's Lagrangian path integral was an outgrowth of Dirac's vague surmise\nthat Lagrangians have a role in quantum mechanics. Lagrangians implicitly\nincorporate Hamilton's first equation of motion, so their use contravenes the\nuncertainty principle, but they are relevant to semiclassical approximations\nand relatedly to the ubiquitous case that the Hamiltonian is quadratic in the\ncanonical momenta, which accounts for the Lagrangian path integral's \"success\".\nFeynman also invented the Hamiltonian phase-space path integral, which is fully\ncompatible with the uncertainty principle. We recast this as an ordinary\nfunctional integral by changing direct integration over subpaths constrained to\nall have the same two endpoints into an equivalent integration over those\nsubpaths' unconstrained second derivatives. Function expansion with generalized\nLegendre polynomials of time then enables the functional integral to be\nunambiguously evaluated through first order in the elapsed time, yielding the\nSchroedinger equation with a unique quantization of the classical Hamiltonian.\nWidespread disbelief in that uniqueness stemmed from the mistaken notion that\nno subpath can have its two endpoints arbitrarily far separated when its\nnonzero elapsed time is made arbitrarily short. We also obtain the quantum\namplitude for any specified configuration or momentum path, which turns out to\nbe an ordinary functional integral over, respectively, all momentum or all\nconfiguration paths. The first of these results is directly compared with\nFeynman's mistaken Lagrangian-action hypothesis for such a configuration path\namplitude, with special heed to the case that the Hamiltonian is quadratic in\nthe canonical momenta. \n\n"}

The\nconventional, standard adiabatic quantum computation proceeds along\neigenenergies of parameter-dependent Hamiltonians. By contrast, discrete\nadiabatic computation utilizes adiabatic passage along the quasienergies of\nparameter-dependent unitary operators. For example, such computation can be\nrealized by a concatenation of parameterized quantum circuits, with an\nadiabatic though inevitably discrete change of the parameter. A design\nprinciple of adiabatic passage along quasienergy is recently proposed: Cheon's\nquasienergy and eigenspace anholonomies on unitary operators is available to\nrealize anholonomic adiabatic algorithms [Tanaka and Miyamoto, Phys.

We\ndescribe a one-particle system by introducing two equally large sub-ensembles\nfor each of which one obtains an equation of motion that has the form of a\nNavier-Stokes- or ''anti''-Navier-Stokes-type equation, respectively. By\naveraging over the total ensemble one obtains a new equation of motion which\ncan be converted into the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. The concept\nallows the inclusion of electromagnetic fields and can be extended to\ninteracting N-particle systems. We analyze the problem of how an experimental\nsetup can consistently be decomposed into the quantum system under study and\nthe residual quantum system ''apparatus''. The irregular extra motion of the\nparticle under study allows a decomposition of the associated ensemble into two\nsub-ensembles the members of which perform, respectively, a right-handed or\nleft-handed irregular circular motion about a given axis which becomes\nphysically relevant in the presence of a magnetic field.

For the scalar type perturbations, we identify\nin general six degrees of freedom.

A smoothly evolving\nvacuum energy density that inherits its time-dependence from cosmological\nfunctions, such as the Hubble rate or the scale factor, is not only a\nqualitatively more plausible and intuitive idea, but is also suggested by\nfundamental physics, in particular by quantum field theory (QFT) in curved\nspace-time. To implement this notion, is not strictly necessary to resort to ad\nhoc scalar fields, as usually done in the literature (e.g. in quintessence\nformulations and the like). A \"running\" Lambda term can be expected on very\nsimilar grounds as one expects (and observes) the running of couplings and\nmasses with a physical energy scale in QFT.

It is shown that: a) as a\nconsequence of inconsistent definition of standard position operator,\npredictions of the theory contradict the data on observations of stars; b) the\ncosmological acceleration and gravity can be treated simply as {\\it\nkinematical} manifestations of quantum de Sitter symmetry, {\\it i.e. the\ncosmological constant problem does not exist, and for describing those\nphenomena the notions of dark energy, space-time background and gravitational\ninteraction are not needed}.

Then we\nshow that if we simply model the propagation of a photon in vacuum as a\nsuccession of transient captures with virtual pairs, we can derive a finite\nvelocity of the photon with a magnitude close to the measured speed of light\n$c$. Again this is the occasion to adjust better our vacuum model.

This equality is very peculiar because it need not\nhave occurred at all and, if it did, should only have happened once (right now)\nin the context of LambdaCDM.

This paper reviews the orthodox, or Dirac-von Neumann\ninterpretation, and makes explicit that Hilbert space describes propositions\nabout measurement results. Kets are defined as conditional clauses referring to\nmeasurements in a formal language. It is seen that these clauses are elements\nof a Hilbert space, such that addition is logical disjunction, the dual space\nconsists of consequent clauses, and the inner product is a set of statements in\nthe subjunctive mood. The probability interpretation gives truth values for\ncorresponding future tense statements when the initial state is actually\nprepared and the final state is to be measured. The mathematical structure of\nquantum mechanics is formulated in terms of discrete measurement results at\nfinite level of accuracy and does not depend on an assumption of a substantive,\nor background, space-time continuum. A continuum of kets, |x> for x in R^3, is\nconstructed from linear combinations of kets in a finite basis. The inner\nproduct can be expressed either as a finite sum or as an integral. Discrete\nposition functions are uniquely embedded into smooth wave functions in such a\nway that differential operators are defined.

The\nsystem is either at statistical equilibrium or general non-equilibrium, and may\nobey either classical or quantum physics. L. Hardy's mathematical axioms\nprovide a basis for the physics obeyed by any such system. One axiom is that\nthe number N of distinguishable states a in the system obeys N=max. This\nassumes that N is known as deterministic prior knowledge. However, most\nobserved systems suffer statistical fluctuations, for which N is therefore only\nknown approximately. Then what happens if the scope of the axiom N=max is\nextended to include such observed systems? It is found that the state a of the\nsystem must obey a principle of maximum Fisher information, I=I_{max}. This is\nimportant because many physical laws have been derived, assuming as a working\nhypothesis that I=I_{max}. These derivations include uses of the principle of\nExtreme physical information (EPI). Examples of such derivations were of the De\nBroglie wave hypothesis, quantum wave equations, Maxwell's equations, new laws\nof biology (e.g. of Coulomb force-directed cell development, and of in situ\ncancer growth), and new laws of economic fluctuation and investment.

We argue that the fundamentally important\ncontent of the Superposition Principle is not the \"probability amplitude\" of\nposterior state observation but future state availability conditional only on\nprior information. Since event detection also implies posterior conditions\n(e.g. a specific type of detectable event occurred) as well as prior\nconditions, the probabilities of detected outcomes are also conditional on\nproperties of the posterior properties of the observation.

It does not include collapse, and it does not consider the environment.\nIt is assumed that a discrete degenerate or non-degenerate observable is\nmeasured. Premeasurement is defined by the calibration condition, which\nrequires that every initially statistically sharp value of the measured\nobservable has to be detected with statistical certainty by the measuring\ninstrument. The entire theory is derived as a logical consequence of this\ndefinition using the standard quantum formalism. The study has a comprehensive\ncoverage, hence the article is actually a topical review. Connection is made\nwith results of other authors, particularly with basic works on premeasurement.\nThe article is a conceptual review, not a historical one. General exact\npremeasurement is defined in 7 equivalent ways. Nondemolition premeasurement,\ndefined by requiring preservation of any sharp value of the measured\nobservable, is characterized in 10 equivalent ways. Overmeasurement, i. e., a\nprocess in which the observable is measured on account of being a function of a\nfiner observable that is actually measured, is discussed. Disentangled\npremeasurement, in which, by definition, to each result corresponds only one\npointer-observable state in the final composite-system state, is investigated.\nIdeal premeasurement, a special case of both nondemolition premeasurement and\ndisentangled premeasurement, is defined, and its most important properties are\ndiscussed. Finally, disentangled and entangled premeasurements, in conjunction\nwith nondemolition or demolition premeasurements, are used for classification\nof all premeasurements. \n\n"}

Abstract: We investigate the quantumness of primordial cosmological fluctuations and\nits detectability. The quantum discord of inflationary perturbations is\ncalculated for an arbitrary splitting of the system, and shown to be very large\non super-Hubble scales. This entails the presence of large quantum\ncorrelations, due to the entangled production of particles with opposite\nmomentums during inflation. To determine how this is reflected at the\nobservational level, we study whether quantum correlators can be reproduced by\na non-discordant state, i.e. a state with vanishing discord that contains\nclassical correlations only. We demonstrate that this can be done for the power\nspectrum, the price to pay being twofold: first, large errors in other\ntwo-point correlation functions and second, the presence of intrinsic\nnon-Gaussianity. The detectability of these two features remains to be\ndetermined but could possibly rule out a non-discordant description of the\ncosmic microwave background. If one abandons the idea that perturbations should\nbe modeled by quantum mechanics and wants to use a classical stochastic\nformalism instead, we show that any two-point correlators on super-Hubble\nscales can be exactly reproduced regardless of the squeezing of the system.

Abstract: The aberration and Doppler coupling effects of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) were recently measured by the Planck satellite. The most\nstraightforward interpretation leads to a direct detection of our peculiar\nvelocity $\\beta$, consistent with the measurement of the well-known dipole. In\nthis paper we discuss the assumptions behind such interpretation. We show that\nDoppler-like couplings appear from two effects: our peculiar velocity and a\nsecond order large-scale effect due to the dipolar part of the gravitational\npotential. We find that the two effects are exactly degenerate but only if we\nassume second-order initial conditions from single-field Inflation. Thus,\ndetecting a discrepancy in the value of $\\beta$ from the dipole and the Doppler\ncouplings implies the presence of a primordial non-Gaussianity. We also show\nthat aberration-like signals likewise arise from two independent effects: our\npeculiar velocity and lensing due to a first order large-scale dipolar\ngravitational potential, independently on Gaussianity of the initial\nconditions. In general such effects are not degenerate and so a discrepancy\nbetween the measured $\\beta$ from the dipole and aberration could be accounted\nfor by a dipolar gravitational potential. Only through a fine-tuning of the\nradial profile of the potential it is possible to have a complete degeneracy\nwith a boost effect.

However, for fermionic\nexpressions these infinite terms are due to anti-particles only. This exposes\nan asymmetry in standard QFT, which can be traced back to a bias towards\nparticles in the Dirac bra-ket notation. To counter this bias a new ordering\nprinciple (called the $\\mathbb{R}$-product) is required which restores the\nsymmetry (or rather duality) between particles and anti-particles and\neliminates the infinite v.e.v. While this $\\mathbb{R}$-product was already used\nin a bound-state application, this paper aims to give it a more general\nfoundation and analyze its overall impact in QFT.\n  For boson fields the particle bias is hidden and the fields must first be\nexpanded into bilinear particle-anti-particle fermion operators. This new\nrepresentation also leads to vanishing v.e.v.'s and avoids some common\ntechnical problems in the quantization of vector fields, while it admits new\nconstant contributions that mimic the Higgs mechanism without unacceptable\ncontributions to the cosmological constant.\n  Since the $\\mathbb{R}$-product does not apply between operators belonging to\ndifferent space- time coordinates (e.g. propagators and vacuum condensates),\nmost standard QFT calculations remain unaffected by this new principle,\npreserving those quantitative successes. The boson propagator also retains a\nstandard bosonic form despite the fermionic representation.

Is this decomposition unique? Must the number of branches\nincrease with time?

It is well-known that for pure states, essentially all\nentanglement measures are equal to the v. Neumann entropy of the reduced state,\nbut for mixed states, this uniqueness is lost. In quantum field theory,\nbipartite systems are associated with causally disjoint regions. There are no\nseparable (normal) states to begin with when the regions touch each other, so\none must leave a finite \"safety-corridor\". Due to this corridor, the normal\nstates of bipartite systems are necessarily mixed, and the v. Neumann entropy\nis not a good entanglement measure in the above sense.\n  In this paper, we study various entanglement measures which vanish on\nseparable states, do not increase under separable (local) operations, and have\nother desirable properties. In particular, we study the relative entanglement\nentropy, defined as the minimum relative entropy between the given state and an\narbitrary separable state. We establish rigorous upper and lower bounds in\nvarious quantum field theoretic (QFT) models, as well as also model-independent\nones.

Typically, the bounds show a\ndivergent behavior when the systems get close to each other--sometimes of the\nform of a generalized \"area law\"--and decay when the systems are far apart.

First, we simplify and\nanalyze the weak-measurement and interference protocols for measuring the OTOC\nand its quasiprobability. We decrease, exponentially in system size, the number\nof trials required to infer the OTOC from weak measurements. We also construct\na circuit for implementing the weak-measurement scheme. Next, we calculate the\nquasiprobability (after coarse-graining) numerically and analytically: We\nsimulate a transverse-field Ising model first. Then, we calculate the\nquasiprobability averaged over random circuits, which model chaotic dynamics.\nThe quasiprobability, we find, distinguishes chaotic from integrable regimes.\nWe observe nonclassical behaviors: The quasiprobability typically has negative\ncomponents. It becomes nonreal in some regimes. The onset of scrambling breaks\na symmetry that bifurcates the quasiprobability, as in classical-chaos\npitchforks. Finally, we present mathematical properties. The quasiprobability\nobeys a Bayes-type theorem, for example, that exponentially decreases the\nmemory required to calculate weak values, in certain cases.

An alternative to new elementary particles\npostulates DM as made of macroscopic compact halo objects (MACHO) such as black\nholes formed in the very early universe. Stellar-mass primordial black holes\n(PBHs) are subject to less robust constraints than other mass ranges and might\nbe connected to gravitational-wave signals detected by the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).

Current SNe datasets constrain compact objects to\nrepresent less than 35.2% (Joint Lightcurve Analisis) and 37.2% (Union 2.1) of\nthe total matter content in the universe, at 95% confidence-level. The results\nare valid for masses larger than $\\sim 0.01M_\\odot$ (solar-masses), limited by\nthe size SNe relative to the lens Einstein radius.

On the basis of the gauge/gravity duality, these black strings are\ndual to rotating thermal states of a strongly interacting conformal field\ntheory (CFT) that lives on a cylinder. In this work, we obtain the complete\nquasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of the gravitational perturbations of rotating\nblack strings. Analytic solutions for the dispersion relations are found in the\nhydrodynamic limit, characterized by fluctuations with wavenumber and frequency\nmuch smaller than the Hawking temperature of the string (or the temperature in\nthe CFT dual description). We obtain these dispersion relations both by\nstudying the gravitational perturbations of rotating black strings and by\ninvestigating the hydrodynamic fluctuations of a moving fluid living on the\nboundary of the AdS spacetime. Relativistic effects like the Doppler shift of\nthe frequencies, wavelength contraction, and dilation of the thermalization\ntime are shown explicitly in such a regime. We also investigate the behavior of\na sound wave propagating in a viscous fluid for several values of the rotation\nparameter. The numerical solutions for the fundamental QNMs show a crossover (a\ntransition) from a hydrodynamic-like behavior to a linear relativistic scaling\nfor large wavenumbers. Additionally, we find a new family of QNMs which are\npurely damped in the zero wavenumber limit and that does not follow as a\ncontinuation of QNMs of the static black string, but that appears to be closely\nrelated to the algebraically special perturbation modes. \n\n"}

More specifically, with $P$ the Markov chain\ntransition matrix and $D = \\sqrt{P\\circ P^T}$ its discriminant matrix ($D=P$ if\n$P$ is symmetric), we construct a quantum walk algorithm that for any quantum\nstate $|v\\rangle$ and integer $t$ returns a quantum state $\\epsilon$-close to\nthe state $D^t|v\\rangle/\\|D^t|v\\rangle\\|$. The algorithm uses\n$O\\Big(\\|D^t|v\\rangle\\|^{-1}\\sqrt{t\\log(\\epsilon\\|D^t|v\\rangle\\|)^{-1}}\\Big)$\nexpected quantum walk steps and $O(\\|D^t|v\\rangle\\|^{-1})$ expected reflections\naround $|v\\rangle$. This shows that quantum walks can accelerate the transient\ndynamics of Markov chains, complementing the line of results that proves the\nacceleration of their limit behavior.\n  We show that this tool leads to speedups on random walk algorithms in a very\nnatural way. Specifically we consider random walk algorithms for testing the\ngraph expansion and clusterability, and show that we can quadratically improve\nthe dependency of the classical property testers on the random walk runtime.\nMoreover, our quantum algorithm exponentially improves the space complexity of\nthe classical tester to logarithmic.

The pure vacuum problem requires\nsingular, Aichelburg-Sexl type sources to achieve finite energy solutions,\nwhich are problematic to treat both mathematically and numerically. Instead\nthen, we use null (massless) particles to source non-trivial geometry within\nthe initial wave fronts. The main purposes of this paper are to (a) motivate\nthe problem, (b) introduce methods for numerically solving the Einstein\nequations coupled to distributions of collisionless massless or massive\nparticles, and (c) present a first result on the formation of black holes in\nthe head-on collision of axisymmetric distributions of null particles.\nRegarding the last-named, initial conditions are chosen so that a black hole\nforms promptly, with essentially no matter escaping the collision. This can be\ninterpreted as approaching the ultra-relativistic collision problem from within\nan infinite boost limit, but where the matter distribution is spread out, and\nthus non-singular. We find results that are consistent with earlier\nperturbative calculations of the collision of Aichelburg-Sexl singularities, as\nwell as numerical studies of the high-speed collision of boson stars, black\nholes, and fluid stars: a black hole is formed containing most of the energy of\nthe spacetime, with the remaining $15\\pm1\\%$ of the initial energy radiated\naway as gravitational waves.

However, this is quite different from the standard $\\rm\nQ$-ball formation. The running in presence of gauge and Yukawa couplings\nbecomes strong if $m_{1/2}/m_0$ is sufficiently large. Moreover, the $\\rm\nQ$-balls which are formed during the early oscillations constantly evolve, due\nto the redshift of the Hubble-induced soft mass, until the low-energy\nsupersymmtery breaking becomes dominant. For smaller $m_{1/2}/m_0$, $\\rm\nQ$-balls are not formed during early oscillations because of the shrinking of\nthe instability band due to the Hubble expansion. In this case the $\\rm\nQ$-balls are formed only at the weak scale, but typically carry smaller\ncharges, as a result of their amplitude redshift. Therefore, the Hubble-induced\ncorrections to the flat directions give rise to a successful $\\rm Q$-ball\ncosmology. \n\n"}

Doppler shifts due to thermal\nmotions of cavity walls provide necessary mixing, but also preserve the\namplitudes and phases. The lambda/2 intervals of the modes thus preserved must\nhave equal energy expectations, say <E>, in the resulting equilibrium. By\ndefinition again, they can be exchanged between modes only in whole numbers and\nhence only between harmonics. Each family of harmonic modes is thus\nself-contained and is disjoint from other families in such exchanges, and\nfurther, can have no more than one mode excited at any instant. The second\nproperty identifies harmonic families of standing wave modes as the harmonic\noscillators of Planck's theory, since a family can only bear energy equal to\nexactly one of E, 2E, 3E, etc These two properties further imply that the\nenergy expectation gets averaged only over an individual family, as the\nequilibrium energy <E(f)> steadily available at a given mode would have\ncontributions from its entire harmonic family.

The electric\ncharges are released by activation of dormant charge carriers in the oxygen\nanion sublattice, called peroxy bonds or positive hole pairs (PHP), where a PHP\nrepresents an $O_3X/^{OO}\\backslash YO_3$ with $X,Y = Si^{4+}, Al^{3+}...$,\ni.e. an $O^-$ in a matrix of $O^{2-}$ of silicates.

Recent laboratory experiments indeed show that\nstressed rocks form electric batteries which can release their charge when a\nconducting path closes the equivalent electric circuit.

In this\ninvestigation, it is argued that the high redshift can be due to the\ngravitational redshift as an intrinsic redshift.

These hidden subgroup problems are then solved\nby Fourier sampling: the quantum Fourier transform of y is computed and\nmeasured. When the underlying group is non-Abelian, two important variants of\nthe Fourier sampling paradigm have been identified: the weak standard method,\nwhere only representation names are measured, and the strong standard method,\nwhere full measurement occurs. It has remained open whether the strong standard\nmethod is indeed stronger, that is, whether there are hidden subgroups that can\nbe reconstructed via the strong method but not by the weak, or any other known,\nmethod.
