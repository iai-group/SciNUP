In the eighties, three physicists, Knizhnik, Polyakov et\nZamolodchikov (KPZ) came up in \\cite{\\KPZ} with a novel and far-reaching\napproach in order to understand the critical behavior of these models. Among\nthese, one finds for example random walks, percolation as well as the Ising\nmodel. The main underlying idea of their approach is to study these models\nalong a two-step procedure as follows: a/ First of all, instead of considering\nthe model on some regular lattice of the plane (such as $\\Z^2$ for example),\none defines it instead on a well-chosen \"random planar lattice\". Doing so\ncorresponds to studying the model in its {\\it quantum gravity} form. In the\ncase of percolation, the appropriate choice of random lattice matches with the\nso-called planar maps. b/ Then it remains to get back to the actual {\\it\nEuclidean} setup.

We first discuss the survival probability S(t) that a diffusing\nparticle, in arbitrary spatial dimension, remains inside a conical domain up to\ntime t. In general, this quantity decays algebraically S ~ t^{-beta} in the\nlong-time limit. The exponent beta depends on the opening angle of the cone and\nthe spatial dimension, and it is root of a transcendental equation involving\nthe associated Legendre functions. The exponent becomes a function of a single\nscaling variable in the limit of large spatial dimension. We then describe two\nfirst-passage problems involving the order of N independent Brownian particles\nin one dimension where survival probabilities decay algebraically as well. To\nanalyze these problems, we identify the trajectories of the N particles with\nthe trajectory of one particle in N dimensions, confined to within a certain\nboundary, and we use a circular cone with matching solid angle as a replacement\nfor the confining boundary. For N=3, the confining boundary is a wedge and the\napproach is exact.

This is an old and famously difficult question. One can generalize the\nquestion in two ways: first, one may consider the {\\em dielectric breakdown\nmodel} $\\eta$-DBM, a generalization of DLA in which particle locations are\nsampled from the $\\eta$-th power of harmonic measure, instead of harmonic\nmeasure itself. Second, instead of restricting attention to deterministic\nlattices, one may consider $\\eta$-DBM on random graphs known or believed to\nconverge in law to a Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface with parameter\n$\\gamma \\in [0,2]$.\n  In this generality, we propose a scaling limit candidate called quantum\nLoewner evolution, QLE$(\\gamma^2, \\eta)$. QLE is defined in terms of the radial\nLoewner equation like radial SLE, except that it is driven by a measure valued\ndiffusion $\\nu_t$ derived from LQG rather than a multiple of a standard\nBrownian motion. We formalize the dynamics of $\\nu_t$ using an SPDE. For each\n$\\gamma \\in (0,2]$, there are two or three special values of $\\eta$ for which\nwe establish the existence of a solution to these dynamics and explicitly\ndescribe the stationary law of $\\nu_t$.\n  We also explain discrete versions of our construction that relate DLA to\nloop-erased random walk and the Eden model to percolation. A certain\n\"reshuffling\" trick (in which concentric annular regions are rotated randomly,\nlike slot machine reels) facilitates explicit calculation.\n  We propose QLE$(2,1)$ as a scaling limit for DLA on a random\nspanning-tree-decorated planar map, and QLE$(8/3,0)$ as a scaling limit for the\nEden model on a random triangulation. We propose using QLE$(8/3,0)$ to endow\npure LQG with a distance function, by interpreting the region explored by a\nbranching variant of QLE$(8/3,0)$, up to a fixed time, as a metric ball in a\nrandom metric space. \n\n"}

For density dependent families\nof MCs that represent the interaction of large groups of identical objects,\nKurtz has proposed two kinds of approximations. One is based on ordinary\ndifferential equations, while the other uses a diffusion process. The\ncomputational cost of the deterministic approximation is significantly lower,\nbut the diffusion approximation retains stochasticity and is able to reproduce\nrelevant random features like variance, bimodality, and tail behavior. In a\nrecent paper, for particular stochastic Petri net models, we proposed a jump\ndiffusion approximation that aims at being applicable beyond the limits of\nKurtz's diffusion approximation, namely when the process reaches the boundary\nwith non-negligible probability. Other limitations of the diffusion\napproximation in its original form are that it can provide inaccurate results\nwhen the number of objects in some groups is often or constantly low and that\nit can be applied only to pure density dependent Markov chains. In order to\novercome these drawbacks, in this paper we propose to apply the jump-diffusion\napproximation only to those components of the model that are in density\ndependent form and are associated with high population levels. The remaining\ncomponents are treated as discrete quantities. The resulting process is a\nhybrid switching jump diffusion.

Both classes were introduced---with Brownian-time-type\nkernel formulations---by Allouba in a series of articles starting in 2006,\nwhere he presented class (2) in its rigorous stochastic integral equations\nform.

While their structural theory\nis very well understood, far less is known about computing their main\nparameters.\n  We give polynomial time algorithms to compute feasibility of BL-datum, the\noptimal BL-constant and a weak separation oracle for the BL-polytope. The same\nresult holds for the so-called Reverse BL inequalities of Barthe. The best\nknown algorithms for any of these tasks required at least exponential time.\n  The algorithms are obtained by a simple efficient reduction of a given\nBL-datum to an instance of the Operator Scaling problem defined by Gurvits, for\nwhich the present authors have provided a polynomial time algorithm. This\nreduction implies algorithmic versions of many of the known structural results,\nand in some cases provide proofs that are different or simpler than existing\nones.\n  Of particular interest is the fact that the operator scaling algorithm is\ncontinuous in its input.

Such matched behavior\nmakes analysis of the bike sharing systems more difficult and challenging. This\npaper considers a more general large-scale bike sharing system from two\nimportant views: (a) Bikes move in an irreducible path graph, which is related\nto geographical structure of the bike sharing system; and (b) Markovian arrival\nprocesses (MAPs) are applied to describe the non-Poisson and burst behavior of\nbike-user (abbreviated as user) arrivals, while the burstiness demonstrates\nthat the user arrivals are time-inhomogeneous and space-heterogeneous in\npractice. For such a complicated bike sharing system, this paper establishes a\nmulticlass closed queueing network by means of some virtual ideas, for example,\nbikes are abstracted as virtual customers; stations and roads are regarded as\nvirtual nodes. Thus user arrivals are related to service times at station\nnodes; and users riding bikes on roads are viewed as service times at road\nnodes. Further, to deal with this multiclass closed queueing network, we\nprovide a detailed observation practically on physical behavior of the bike\nsharing system in order to establish the routing matrix, which gives a\nnonlinear solution to compute the relative arrival rates in terms of the\nproduct-form solution to the steady-state probabilities of joint queue lengths\nat the virtual nodes. Based on this, we can compute the steady-state\nprobability of problematic stations, and also deal with other interesting\nperformance measures of the bike sharing system. We hope that the methodology\nand results of this paper can be applicable in the study of more general bike\nsharing systems through multiclass closed queueing networks. \n\n"}

Moreover, the\nnotion of association schemes can be relaxed slightly by using suitably\ndeformed families of stochastic matrices by skipping the integrality\nconditions. This leads to larger class of examples which are again associated\nto discrete hypergroups.\n  In this paper we propose a topological generalization of the notion of\nassociation schemes by using a locally compact basis space $X$ and a family of\nMarkov-kernels on $X$ indexed by a further locally compact space $D$ where the\nsupports of the associated probability measures satisfy some partition\nproperty.

In this paper, for all integers\n$q\\geq 3$ and $\\Delta\\geq 3$, we develop algorithms that produce samples within\nerror $o(1)$ from the $q$-state Potts model on random $\\Delta$-regular graphs,\nwhenever the temperature is in uniqueness, for both the ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic cases.\n  The algorithm for the antiferromagnetic Potts model is based on iteratively\nadding the edges of the graph and resampling a bichromatic class that contains\nthe endpoints of the newly added edge. Key to the algorithm is how to perform\nthe resampling step efficiently since bichromatic classes may induce\nlinear-sized components. To this end, we exploit the tree uniqueness to show\nthat the average growth of bichromatic components is typically small, which\nallows us to use correlation decay algorithms for the resampling step.

In this paper we study UFG diffusions and demonstrate the\nimportance of such a class of processes in several respects: roughly speaking\ni) we show that UFG processes constitute a family of SDEs which exhibit\nmultiple invariant measures and for which one is able to describe a systematic\nprocedure to determine the basin of attraction of each invariant measure\n(equilibrium state). ii) We use an explicit change of coordinates to prove that\nevery UFG diffusion can be, at least locally, represented as a system\nconsisting of an SDE coupled with an ODE, where the ODE evolves independently\nof the SDE part of the dynamics. iii) As a result, UFG diffusions are\ninherently \"less smooth\" than hypoelliptic SDEs; more precisely, we prove that\nUFG processes do not admit a density with respect to Lebesgue measure on the\nentire space, but only on suitable time-evolving submanifolds, which we\ndescribe. iv) We show that our results and techniques, which we devised for UFG\nprocesses, can be applied to the study of the long-time behaviour of\nnon-autonomous hypoelliptic SDEs and therefore produce several results on this\nlatter class of processes as well. v) Because processes that satisfy the\n(uniform) parabolic H\\\"ormander condition are UFG processes, our paper contains\na wealth of results about the long time behaviour of (uniformly) hypoelliptic\nprocesses which are non-ergodic, in the sense that they exhibit multiple\ninvariant measures. \n\n"}

The first one is a global one and says\nthat if the difference between the covariance kernels of two Gaussian fields,\ntaking values in some Sobolev space, has suitable Sobolev regularity, then\nthese fields differ by a H\\\"older continuous Gaussian process. Our second\ndecomposition theorem is more specialized and is in the setting of Gaussian\nfields whose covariance kernel has a logarithmic singularity on the diagonal --\nor log-correlated Gaussian fields. The theorem states that any log-correlated\nGaussian field $X$ can be decomposed locally into a sum of a H\\\"older\ncontinuous function and an independent almost $\\star$-scale invariant field (a\nspecial class of stationary log-correlated fields with 'cone-like' white noise\nrepresentations). This decomposition holds whenever the term $g$ in the\ncovariance kernel $C_X(x,y)=\\log(1/|x-y|)+g(x,y)$ has locally\n$H^{d+\\varepsilon}$ Sobolev smoothness.\n  We use these decompositions to extend several results that have been known\nbasically only for $\\star$-scale invariant fields to general log-correlated\nfields.

The\nalgorithm provides a rapid means of evaluating Li_s(z) for general values of\ncomplex s and the region of complex z values given by |z^2/(z-1)|<4.\n  Alternatively, the Hurwitz zeta can be very rapidly evaluated by means of an\nEuler-Maclaurin series.
