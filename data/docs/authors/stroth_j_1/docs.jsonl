It is argued\nthat the large width of the QGP bags not only explains the observed deficit in\nthe number of hadronic resonances, but also clarifies the reason why the heavy\nQGP bags cannot be directly observed as metastable states in a hadronic phase.\nThe model allows us to estimate the minimal value of the width of QGP bags from\na variety of the lattice QCD data and get that the minimal resonance width at\nzero temperature is about 600 MeV, whereas the minimal resonance width at the\nHagedorn temperature is about 2000 MeV. As shown these estimates are almost\ninsensitive to the number of the elementary degrees of freedom. The recent\nlattice QCD data are analyzed and it is found that besides sigma T**4 term the\nlattice QCD pressure contains T-linear and T**4 ln T terms in the range of\ntemperatures between 240 MeV and 420 MeV. The presence of the last term in the\npressure bears almost no effect on the width estimates.

We find that all electron capture\nreactions are thermally stable in accreting neutron star oceans and thus are\nnot a viable trigger mechanism. Fusion reactions other than 12C + 12C are\ninfeasible as well since the possible reactants either deplete at much\nshallower depths or have prohibitively large Coulomb barriers. Thus we confirm\nthe proposal of Cumming & Bildsten and Strohmayer & Brown that 12C + 12C\ntriggers superbursts. We then examine the 12C + 12C fusion rate. The reaction\ncross-section is experimentally unknown at astrophysically relevant energies,\nbut resonances exist in the 12C + 12C system throughout the entire measured\nenergy range. Thus it is likely, and in fact has been predicted, that a\nresonance exists near the Gamow peak energy ~ 1.5 MeV. For such a hypothetical\n1.5 MeV resonance, we derive both a fiducial value and upper limit to the\nresonance strength and find that such a resonance could decrease the\ntheoretically predicted superburst ignition depth by up to a factor of 4; in\nthis case, observationally inferred superburst ignition depths would accord\nwith model predictions for a range of plausible neutron star parameters.

We can imagine a unitary transformation which groups four non\nidentical nucleons (i.e. with different spin and isospin) close in coordinate\nspace. Those nucleons, being non identical, do not obey the Pauli principle,\nthus their relative momenta are negligibly small (just to fulfill the\nHeisenberg principle). Such a cluster can be identified with an $\\alpha$ boson.\nBut in dense nuclear matter, those $\\alpha$ particles still obey the Pauli\nprinciple since are constituted of Fermions. The ground state energy of nuclear\nmatter $\\alpha$ clusters is the same as for nucleons, thus it is degenerate. We\ncould think of $\\alpha$ particles as vortices which can now braid, for instance\nmaking $^8Be$ which leave the ground state energy unchanged. Further braiding\nto heavier clusters ($^{12}C$, $^{16}O$..) could give a different\nrepresentation of the ground state at no energy cost. In contrast d-like\nclusters (i.e. N=Z odd-odd nuclei, where N and Z are the neutron and proton\nnumber respectively) cannot describe the ground state of nuclear matter and can\nbe formed at high excitation energies (or temperatures) only. We show that\neven-even, N=Z, clusters could be classified as non-Abelian states of matter.\nAs a consequence an $\\alpha$ condensate in nuclear matter might be hindered by\nthe Fermi motion, while it could be possible a condensate of $^8Be$ or heavier\nclusters. \n\n"}

This paper discusses the extent to which the meson\nspectrum should be viewed as evidence for a Hagedorn spectrum and argues that\ndata do not provide a strong evidence for the Hagedorn conjecture. The\nconclusion is based on three reasons. It is shown that \"realistic\" quark models\nhave a spectrum in which the number of mesons up to 2.3 GeV grows with mass in\na very similar way to the spectrum of physical mesons up to 2.3 GeV.

An additional motivation for conducting such searches comes from the\nexistence of an unconfirmed, but not refuted, claim of evidence for\nneutrinoless double decay in $^{76}\\text{Ge}$. As a consequence, a new\ngeneration of experiments, employing different detection techniques and\n$\\beta\\beta$ isotopes, is being actively promoted by experimental groups across\nthe world. In addition, nuclear theorists are making remarkable progress in the\ncalculation of the neutrinoless double beta decay nuclear matrix elements, thus\neliminating a substantial part of the theoretical uncertainties affecting the\nparticle physics interpretation of this process. In this report, we review the\nmain aspects of the double beta decay process and some of the most relevant\nexperiments. The picture that emerges is one where searching for neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay is recognized to have both far-reaching theoretical\nimplications and promising prospects for experimental observation in the near\nfuture. \n\n"}

We perform coupled-cluster calculations to quantify\nto what extent selected closed-shell nuclei in the oxygen and calcium isotopic\nchains can effectively be mapped onto an effective independent-particle\npicture. To do so, we revisit in detail the notion of ESPEs in the context of\nstrongly correlated many-nucleon systems and illustrate the necessity to\nextract ESPEs through the diagonalization of the centroid {\\it matrix}, as\noriginally argued by Baranger. For the purpose of illustration, we analyse the\nimpact of correlations on observable one-nucleon separation energies and\nnon-observable ESPEs in selected closed-shell oxygen and calcium isotopes.

In these models the crust-core\ntransition density, and thus crustal thickness, is calculated consistently with\nthe core equation of state (EOS). For the canonical neutron star, the lower\nbound of the r-mode instability window is reduced in frequency by \\approx150 Hz\nfrom the softest to the stiffest symmetry energy used, independent of mass and\ntemperature. The instability window also drops by \\approx 100 Hz independent of\nEOS when the mass is raised from 1.4 M_{\\odot} to 2.0 M_{\\odot}. Where\ntemperature estimates are available, the observed neutron stars in low mass\nX-ray binaries (LMXBs) have frequencies below the instability window for the\n1.4 M_{\\odot} models, while some LMXBs fall within the instability window for\n2.0 M_{\\odot} stars if the symmetry energy is relatively stiff, indicating that\na softer symmetry energy is more consistent with observations within this\nmodel. Thus we conclude that smaller values of L help stabilize neutron stars\nagainst runaway r-mode oscillations. The critical temperature, below which no\nstar can reach the instability window without exceeding its Kepler frequency,\nvaries by nearly an order of magnitude from soft to stiff symmetry energies.\nWhen the crust thickness and core EOS are treated consistently, a thicker crust\ncorresponds to a lower critical temperature, the opposite result to previous\nstudies in which the transition density was independent of the core EOS. \n\n"}

In\nthe case of low-background physics, however, a primary concern is the effect on\nthe detector from radioactivity inherent in the detector parts themselves. From\nthis standpoint, there is no single source or beam, but rather a collection of\nsources with potentially complicated spatial extent. LUXSim is a simulation\nframework used by the LUX collaboration that takes a component-centric approach\nto event generation and recording. A new set of classes allows for multiple\nradioactive sources to be set within any number of components at run time, with\nthe entire collection of sources handled within a single simulation run.\nVarious levels of information can also be recorded from the individual\ncomponents, with these record levels also being set at runtime.

For photonuclear reactions with a narrow gamma beam, the\nenergy deposition in the target can be reduced by using a stack of thin target\nwires, hence avoiding direct stopping of the Compton electrons and e^+e^-\npairs. The well-defined initial excitation energy of the compound nucleus leads\nto a small number of reaction channels and enables new combinations of target\nisotope and final radioisotope. The narrow-bandwidth gamma excitation may make\nuse of collective resonances in gamma-width, leading to increased cross\nsections.

The first property is the approximate scaling\nrelation between proton and neutron high-momentum distributions weighted by\ntheir relative fractions in the nucleus. The second property is the inverse\nproportionality of the strength of the high-momentum distribution of protons\nand neutrons to the same relative fractions.

In\nparticular, we show how chiral and QCD sum rules, together with constraints\nfrom lattice QCD, can render these relations quantitative.

{"id": "1408.0857", "contents": "Title: Impact of the equation-of-state -- gravity degeneracy on constraining\n  the nuclear symmetry energy from astrophysical observables Abstract: There is a degeneracy between the equation of state (EOS) of superdense\nneutron-rich nuclear matter and the strong-field gravity in understanding\nproperties of neutron stars. While the EOS is still poorly known, there are\nalso longstanding ambiguities in choosing General Relativity or alternative\ngravity theories in the not-so-well tested strong-field regime. Besides\npossible appearance of hyperons and new phases, the most uncertain part of the\nnucleonic EOS is currently the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy.\nTo provide information that may help break the EOS-gravity degeneracy, we\ninvestigate effects of symmetry energy within its uncertain range determined by\nterrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments on the gravitational binding energy\nand spacetime curvature of neutron stars within GR and the scalar-tensor (ST)\ntheory of gravity. In particular, we focus on effects of the following\nparameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter: (1) the\nincompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter, (2) the slope $L$ of\nsymmetry energy at saturation density and (3) the high-density behavior of\nsymmetry energy. We find that the variation of either the density slope $L$ or\nthe high-density behavior of symmetry energy leads to large changes in both the\nbinding energy and curvature of neutron stars while effects of varying the more\nconstrained $K_0$ are negligibly small. The difference in predictions using the\nGR and the ST theory appears only for massive neutron stars, and is\nsignificantly smaller than the differences resulting from variations in the\nsymmetry energy. We conclude that within the ST theory of gravity, the\nEOS-gravity degeneracy has been broken by the recent relativistic pulsar\nmeasurements, and that measurements of neutron star properties sensitive to the\ncompactness constrain mainly the density dependence of the symmetry energy. \n\n"}

Due to large internal momenta involved we are\ndealing with the relativistic bound state that is best described by the\nlight-cone momentum distribution of nucleons in the deuteron. We present the\nfirst attempt of extracting the deuteron light-cone momentum distribution\nfunction from data and discuss the importance of this quantity for studies of\nQCD structure of the bound nucleon in deep inelastic scattering off the\ndeuteron. We conclude the review giving an outlook of the next generation of\nhigh energy experiments which will extend our reach to much smaller distances\nin the deuteron. \n\n"}

There is little systematic knowledge of the contribution\nof collective excitations to the interaction between nuclei, particularly in\nthe overlap region of heavy nuclei.\n  Purpose: To study the dynamic polarization potential (DPP) generated by\nchannel coupling that had been validated for a case where scattering is\nsensitive to the nuclear potential over a wide radial range; to exhibit\nevidence of the non-locality due to collective coupling; to validate, or\notherwise, the representation of DPPs by uniform renormalization of potentials.\n  Methods: S-matrix to potential inversion yields local potentials reproducing\nthe elastic channel S-matrix of coupled channel calculations. Subtracting the\nelastic channel uncoupled potential yields a local L-independent representation\nof the DPP. The dependence of the DPP on the nature of the coupled states and\nother parameters can be studied.\n  Results: Local DPPs were found due to the excitation of C-12 and the combined\nexcitation of O-16 and C-12. The radial forms found were very different from\nuniform renormalization of the potential. Full coupling led to a 10 percent\nincrease in the volume integral of the real potential. Evidence for the\nnon-locality of the underlying formal DPP and the effect of direct coupling\nbetween the collective states is found.\n  Conclusions: The local DPP generating the secondary rainbow is found. DPPs\nhave forms depending on the specific excitations and cannot be represented by a\nuniform renormalization of the potential. The method is useful for study of the\ncontribution of collective excitations to internuclear potentials, concerning\nwhich remarkably little is known in general. \n\n"}

We find that multistrange hadrons scatter less\nduring the hadronic stage than nonstrange particles, and thus their\ndistributions reflect the properties of the system in an earlier stage than the\ndistributions of nonstrange particles. \n\n"}

The\ncoarse-graining of the microscopic simulations enables to calculate thermal\ndilepton emission rates by application of in-medium spectral functions from\nequilibrium quantum-field theoretical calculations. The results show that\nextremely high baryon chemical potentials dominate the evolution of the created\nhot and dense fireball. Consequently, a significant modification of the $\\rho$\nspectral shape becomes visible in the dilepton invariant-mass spectrum,\nresulting in an enhancement in the low-mass region $M_{ee} = 200$ to 600\nMeV/$c^{2}$. This enhancement, mainly caused by baryonic effects on the $\\rho$\nspectral shape, can fully describe the experimentally observed excess above the\nhadronic cocktail contributions in Ar+KCl ($E_{\\mathrm{lab}}=1.76$ $A$GeV)\nreactions as measured by the HADES collaboration and also gives a good\nexplanation of the older DLS Ca+Ca ($E_{\\mathrm{lab}}=1.04$ $A$GeV) data. For\nthe larger Au+Au ($E_{\\mathrm{lab}}=1.23$ $A$GeV) system, we predict an even\nstronger excess from our calculations. A systematic comparison of the results\nfor different system sizes from C+C to Au+Au shows that the thermal dilepton\nyield increases stronger ($\\propto A^{4/3}$) than the hadronic background\ncontributions, which scale with $A$, due to its sensitivity on the time\nevolution of the reaction.

The two measurements were combined in order\nto measure direct photons over a broad transverse momentum range of $0.9 <\np_{\\rm T} < 14$ GeV/$c$. A direct photon signal was observed in the thermal\nregion $0.9 < p_{\\rm T} < 2.1$ GeV/$c$, with a significance of $2.6\\sigma$ in\nthe 20\\% most central collisions. The corresponding direct photon spectrum can\nbe described by an exponential with an inverse slope parameter of $(304 \\pm\n11^{\\rm stat} \\pm 40^{\\rm syst})$ MeV, without subtracting the hard scattering\ncomponent, which is somewhat larger than the inverse slope parameter of the\ndirect photon spectrum at RHIC energies.

Previous theoretical analyses\nhave shown that the elastic breakup (EBU) mechanism (i.e., projectile breakup\nleaving the target in its ground state) is able to account only for a small\nfraction of the total $\\alpha$ inclusive breakup cross sections, pointing\ntoward the dominance of non-elastic breakup (NEB) mechanisms.\n  Purpose: We aim to provide a systematic study of the $\\alpha$ inclusive cross\nsections observed in nuclear reactions induced by $^{6}$Li projectiles. In\naddition to estimating the total $\\alpha$ singles cross sections, it is our\ngoal to evaluate angular and energy distributions of these $\\alpha$ particles\nand compare with experimental data, when available.\n  Method: We compute separately the EBU and NEB components of the inclusive\nbreakup cross sections. For the former, we use the continuum-discretized\ncoupled-channels (CDCC) method, which treats this mechanism to all orders. For\nthe NEB part, we employ the the model proposed in the eighties by Ichimura,\nAustern and Vincent [Phys. Rev.

These factorization breaking effects arise from soft color\nexchanges between charm-anticharm pairs undergoing hadronization and comoving\npartons that are long-lived on time scales of quarkonium formation. We compute\nthe short distance pair production of heavy quarks in the Color Glass\nCondensate (CGC) effective field theory and employ an improved Color\nEvaporation model (ICEM) to describe their hadronization into quarkonium at\nlarge distances. The combined CGC+ICEM model provides a quantitative\ndescription of $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(2S)$ data in proton-proton (p+p) collisions\nfrom both RHIC and the LHC. Factorization breaking effects in hadronization,\ndue to additional parton comovers in the nucleus, are introduced heuristically\nby imposing a cutoff $\\Lambda$, representing the momentum kick from soft color\nexchanges, in the ICEM model. Such soft exchanges have no perceptible effect on\n$J/\\psi$ suppression in p+A collisions. In contrast, the interplay of the\nphysics of these soft exchanges at large distances, with the physics of\nsemi-hard rescattering at short distances, causes a significant additional\nsuppression of $\\psi(2S)$ yields relative to that of the $J/\\psi$.

Lattice Quantum\nChromodynamics provides a rigorous, non-perturbative definition of quantum\nchromodynamics that can be implemented numerically. It has been estimated that\na precision of two percent would be possible by 2020 if two challenges are\novercome: contamination of $g_A$ from excited states must be controlled in the\ncalculations and statistical precision must be improved markedly. Here we\nreport a calculation of $g_A^{QCD} = 1.271\\pm0.013$, using an unconventional\nmethod inspired by the Feynman-Hellmann theorem that overcomes these\nchallenges. \n\n"}

A\nparticularly predictive model for the self-interactions is resonant short-range\ninteractions with an S-wave scattering length that is much larger than the\nrange. The velocity dependence of the cross section in such a model provides an\nexcellent fit to self-interaction cross sections inferred from dark-matter\nhalos of galaxies and clusters of galaxies if the dark-matter mass is about 19\nGeV and the scattering length is about 17 fm. Such a model makes definite\npredictions for the few-body physics of weakly bound clusters of the\ndark-matter particles. The formation of the two-body bound cluster is a\nbottleneck for the formation of larger bound clusters. We calculate the\nproduction of two-body bound clusters by three-body recombination in the early\nuniverse under the assumption that the dark matter particles are identical\nbosons, which is the most favorable case. If the dark-matter mass is 19 GeV and\nthe scattering length is 17 fm, the fraction of dark matter in the form of\ntwo-body bound clusters can increase by as much as 4 orders of magnitude when\nthe dark-matter temperature falls below the binding energy, but its present\nvalue remains less than 10^(-6). The present fraction can be increased to as\nlarge as 10^(-3) by relaxing the constraints from small-scale structure and\ndecreasing the mass of the dark matter particle. \n\n"}

From Transparency to High p$_t$ Suppression Abstract: Heavy ion collisions at RHIC energies (Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV) exhibit significant new features as compared to\nearlier experiments at lower energies. The reaction is characterized by a high\ndegree of transparency of the collisions partners leading to the formation of a\nbaryon-poor central region. In this zone, particle production occurs mainly\nfrom the stretching of the color field. The initial energy density is well\nabove the one considered necessary for the formation of the Quark Gluon Plasma,\nQGP. The production of charged particles of various masses is consistent with\nchemical and thermal equilibrium. Recently, a suppression of the high\ntransverse momentum component of hadron spectra has been observed in central\nAu+Au collisions. This can be explained by the energy loss experienced by\nleading partons in a medium with a high density of unscreened color charges.

The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity.
