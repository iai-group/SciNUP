Comparison with the SEDs of other AGNs\nimplies that the internal reddening of NGC5548 is E(B-V) = 0.17 mag. The\nextinction curve is consistent with the mean curve of other AGNs found by\nGaskell & Benker, but inconsistent with an SMC-type reddening curve. Because\nmost IR emission originates exterior to the broad-line region (BLR), the SED\nseen by the inner BLR is different from that seen by the outer BLR and from the\nearth. The most likely BLR covering factor is ~ 40% and it is not possible to\nget an overall BLR covering factor of less than 20%. This requires that the BLR\nis not spherically symmetric and that we are viewing through a hole.\nLine-continuum variability transfer functions are consistent with this\ngeometry. The covering factor and geometry imply that near the equatorial plane\nthe BLR covering approaches 100%. The spectrum seen by the outer regions of the\nBLR and by the torus is thus modified by the absorption in the inner BLR. This\nshielding solves the problem of observed BLR ionization stratification being\nmuch greater than implied by photoionization models. The BLR obscuration also\nremoves the problem of the torus covering factor being greater than the BLR\ncovering factor, and gives consistency with the observed fraction of obscured\nAGNs. The flux reduction at the torus also reduces the problem of AGN\ndust-reverberation lags giving sizes smaller than the dust-sublimation radii. \n\n"}

The original method is valid only for stable\nlinear systems, and we present an extension to unstable linear systems. The\ndynamics on the unstable subspace are represented by projecting the original\nequations onto the global unstable eigenmodes, assumed to be small in number. A\nsnapshot-based algorithm is developed, using approximate balanced truncation,\nfor obtaining a reduced-order model of the dynamics on the stable subspace. The\nproposed algorithm is used to study feedback control of 2-D flow over a flat\nplate at a low Reynolds number and at large angles of attack, where the natural\nflow is vortex shedding, though there also exists an unstable steady state. For\ncontrol design, we derive reduced-order models valid in the neighborhood of\nthis unstable steady state.

Subhaloes with masses\nlarger than 10^5 M_sun/h are well resolved, an improvement of at least two\norders of magnitude over previous lensing studies.

We focus on the \"anomalous\" flux ratio\nproblem, in particular on the violation of the cusp-caustic relation due to\nsubstructures. We find that subhaloes with masses less than ~ 10^8 M_sun/h play\nan important role in causing flux anomalies; such low mass subhaloes have been\nunresolved in previous studies.

However, there exists a class of\nextreme gravitational microlensing events in which the effects of terrestrial\nparallax can be readily detected and so permit the measurement of the distance,\nmass, and transverse velocity of the lens. Here we report observations of the\nfirst such extreme microlensing event OGLE-2007-BLG-224, from which we infer\nthat the lens is a brown dwarf of mass M=0.056 +- 0.004 Msun, with a distance\nof 525 +- 40 pc and a transverse velocity of 113 +- 21 km/s.

In examining the latter case we have quantified the extent of\nthe expansion, which is uncertain observationally, in terms of the star\nformation parameters and time of the expulsion of the cold gas.

In particular their star formation histories and source of\nemission are not accurately constrained. In this paper we introduce a new\napproach to analyse the SMG data.

With the assumption that radio and X-ray\nluminosity are suitable proxies for jet power and accretion power,\nrespectively, a broad fundamental connection between accretion and jet\nproduction is implied. In an effort to refine these links and enhance their\npower, we have explored the above relations exclusively among black holes with\ndirect, dynamical mass-measurements.

We find that the specific SFR\ndensity at z <~ 10 varies systematically from region to region by up to an\norder of magnitude, but the global value, averaged over all volumes, reproduces\nobservational data. Massive, compact galaxies, similar to those observed in the\nGOODS fields, form in the overdense regions as early as z=6, but do not appear\nin the underdense regions until z~3.

There are a\ncomparable number of double neutron star systems compared to isolated recycled\npulsars. We find that standard evolutionary models cannot explain this fact,\npredicting several times the number of isolated recycled pulsars than those in\ndouble neutron star systems. We demonstrate, through population synthesis\ncalculations, that the velocity distribution of isolated recycled pulsars is\nbroader than for binary systems. When this is accounted for in a model for\nradio pulsar survey selection effects, which include the effects of Doppler\nsmearing for the double neutron star binaries, we find that there is a small\n(25%) bias towards the detection of double neutron star systems.

The model introduces Lya radiative\ntransfer as the single factor for transforming the intrinsic Lya emission\nproperties into the observed ones. Spatial diffusion of Lya photons from\nradiative transfer results in extended Lya emission and only the central part\nwith high surface brightness can be observed. Because of radiative transfer,\nthe appearance of LAEs depends on density and velocity structures in\ncircumgalactic and intergalactic media as well as the viewing angle, which\nleads to a broad distribution of apparent (observed) Lya luminosity for a given\nintrinsic Lya luminosity. Radiative transfer also causes frequency diffusion of\nLya photons. The resultant Lya line is asymmetric with a red tail. The peak of\nthe Lya line shifts towards longer wavelength and the shift is anti-correlated\nwith the apparent to intrinsic Lya luminosity ratio. The simple radiative\ntransfer model provides a new framework for studying LAEs. It is able to\nexplain an array of observed properties of z~5.7 LAEs in Ouchi et al.

We also study the possibility of a collisional runaway developing in the\nfirst $\\sim 2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ of dynamical evolution. We find that the evolution of\nthis cluster is dramatically different depending on the choice of IMF: if a\nprimordially mass segregated IMF is chosen, a collisional runaway should always\noccur between $2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ for a broad range of initial concentrations. In\ncontrast, for a standard Kroupa IMF no collisional runaway is predicted. We\nargue that if Arches was created with a mass segregated IMF similar to what is\nobserved today then at the current cluster age a very unusual, high-mass star\nshould be created. However, whether a collisional runaway leads to the\nformation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) depends strongly on the\nmass loss rate via winds from massive stars. Growth of stellar mass through\ncollisions can be quenched by strong wind mass loss. In that case, the\ninter-cluster as well as intra-cluster medium are expected to have a\nsignificant Helium enrichment which may be observed via Helium recombination\nlines. The excess amount of gas lost in winds may also be observed via X-ray\nobservations as diffused X-ray sources. \n\n"}

Most observed dwarf\ngalaxies consists of a rotating stellar disc embedded in a massive DM halo with\na near constant-density core. Yet, models based on the CDM scenario invariably\nform galaxies with dense spheroidal stellar \"bulges\" and steep central DM\nprofiles, as low angular momentum baryons and DM sink to the center of galaxies\nthrough accretion and repeated mergers. Processes that decrease the central\ndensity of CDM halos have been identified, but have not yet reconciled theory\nwith observations of present day dwarfs. This failure is potentially\ncatastrophic for the CDM model, possibly requiring a different DM particle\ncandidate. This Letter presents new hydrodynamical simulations in a Lambda$CDM\nframework where analogues of dwarf galaxies, bulgeless and with a shallow\ncentral DM profile, are formed. This is achieved by resolving the inhomogeneous\ninterstellar medium, resulting in strong outflows from supernovae explosions\nwhich remove low angular momentum gas. This inhibits the formation of bulges\nand decreases the dark-matter density to less than half within the central\nkiloparsec. Realistic dwarf galaxies are thus shown to be a natural outcome of\ngalaxy formation in the CDM scenario. \n\n"}

For example, it has been\nindicated that the dynamical friction doesn't work in cored density profiles\n(constant density in the central region) despite that the Chandrasekhar formula\npredicts drag force even in the constant densities.

We simulate 1:1 disk mergers at seven different initial\ngas fractions ranging from 0 to 40%, using the TreeSPH code Gadget-2. We\nclassify the stellar orbits in each remnant and construct radial profiles of\nthe orbital content, intrinsic shape, and orientation. The dissipationless\nremnants are typically prolate-triaxial, dominated by box orbits within r_c ~\n1.5Reff, and by tube orbits in their outer parts. As the gas fraction\nincreases, the box orbits within r_c are increasingly replaced by a population\nof short axis tubes (z-tubes) with near zero net rotation, and the remnants\nbecome progressively more oblate and round. The long axis tube (x-tube) orbits\nare highly streaming and relatively insensitive to the gas fraction, implying\nthat their angular momentum is retained from the dynamically cold initial\nconditions.

If so, it hosts the closest known neutron\nstar, and its existence implies a great abundance of similar systems and a rate\nof white-dwarf neutron-star mergers similar to that of the type Ia supernova\nrate. Here, we present high signal-to-noise spectra of SDSS 1257+5428, which\nconfirm an independent finding that the system is in fact composed of two white\ndwarfs, one relatively cool and with low mass, and the other hotter and more\nmassive. With this, the demographics and merger rate are no longer puzzling\n(various factors combine to lower the latter by more than two orders of\nmagnitude). We show that the spectra are fit well with a combination of two\nhydrogen model atmospheres, as long as the lines of the higher-gravity\ncomponent are broadened significantly relative to what is expected from just\npressure broadening. Interpreting this additional broadening as due to\nrotation, the inferred spin period is short, about 1 minute. Similarly rapid\nrotation is only seen in accreting white dwarfs that are magnetic; empirically,\nit appears that in non-magnetized white dwarfs, accreted angular momentum is\nlost by nova explosions before it can be transferred to the white dwarf. This\nsuggests that the massive white dwarf in SDSS 1257+5428 is magnetic as well,\nwith B~10^5 G. Alternatively, the broadening seen in the spectral lines could\nbe due to a stronger magnetic field, of ~10^6 G. The two models could be\ndistinguished by further observations. \n\n"}

How these\ncool outflows arise is still in question. Hot gas from supernovae has long been\nsuspected as the primary driver, but this mechanism suffers from its tendency\nto destroy the cool gas as the latter is accelerated. We propose a modification\nof the supernova scenario that overcomes this difficulty.\n  Star formation is observed to take place in clusters; in a given galaxy, the\nbulk of the star formation is found in the ~20 most massive clusters. We show\nthat, for L* galaxies, the radiation pressure from clusters with M>10^6 M_sun\nis able to expel the surrounding gas at velocities in excess of the circular\nvelocity of the disk galaxy. This cool gas can travel above the galactic disk\nin less than 2 Myr, well before any supernovae erupt in the driving cluster.\nOnce above the disk, the cool outflowing gas is exposed to radiation, and\nsupernovae induced hot gas outflows, from other clusters in the disk, which\ndrive it to distances of several tens to hundreds of kpc. Because the\nradiatively driven clouds grow in size as they travel, and because the hot gas\nis more dilute at large distance, the clouds are less subject to destruction if\nthey do eventually encounter hot gas. Therefore, unlike wind driven clouds,\nradiatively driven clouds can survive to distances ~50 kpc. We identify these\ncluster-driven winds with large-scale galactic outflows. Another implication of\nour model is that only starburst galaxies, where massive clusters reside, are\nable to drive winds cold outflows on galactic scales via this mechanism. We\nfind that the critical star formation rates above which large scale cool\noutflows will be launched to be ~0.1 M_sun/yr/kpc^2, which is in good agreement\nwith observations. \n\n"}

During the subsequent evolution, the accretion disk, which\nis truncated at the tidal radius because of the tidal torque, also shrinks as\nthe orbital decay. Assuming that the disk mass changed by this process is all\naccreted, the disk becomes radiatively inefficient when the semi-major axis is\nseveral hundred Schwarzschild radii. The high-energy radiations, in spite of a\nlow bolometric luminosity, are emitted from an accretion disk around each black\nhole long before the black hole coalescence as well as the gravitational wave\nsignals. The synchrotron process can notably produce potentially observable\nradio emissions at large distances if there is a strong, dipole magnetic field\naround each black hole. In unequal mass-ratio binaries, step-like light\nvariations are seen in the observed light curve because the luminosity is\nhigher and its duration time are shorter in the radio emission by the disk\naround the secondary black hole than those of the primary black hole. Such a\nprecursor would be unique to not a single black hole system but a binary black\nhole system, and implies that binary black holes finally merge without\naccretion disks. \n\n"}

For this purpose we use a suite of large\ncosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the OWLS project. We improve on\nprevious work by considering a wider range of halo masses and redshifts, by\ndistinguishing accretion onto haloes and galaxies, by including important\nfeedback processes, and by comparing simulations with different physics. The\nspecific rate of gas accretion onto haloes is, like that for dark matter, only\nweakly dependent on halo mass. For halo masses Mhalo>>10^11 Msun it is\nrelatively insensitive to feedback processes. In contrast, accretion rates onto\ngalaxies are determined by radiative cooling and by outflows driven by\nsupernovae and active galactic nuclei. Galactic winds increase the halo mass at\nwhich the central galaxies grow the fastest by about two orders of magnitude to\nMhalo~10^12 Msun. Gas accretion is bimodal, with maximum past temperatures\neither of order the virial temperature or <~10^5 K. The fraction of gas\naccreted on to haloes in the hot mode is insensitive to feedback and metal-line\ncooling. It increases with decreasing redshift, but is mostly determined by\nhalo mass, increasing gradually from less than 10% for ~10^11 Msun to greater\nthan 90% at 10^13 Msun.

The existence of a characteristic value of log N(O VI) for\ngalactic O VI absorbers, and the lack of evolution in log N(O VI) for\nintergalactic absorbers, lend support to the ``cooling-flow' model of Heckman\net al.

In this paper, the first in a series, we present and test a novel\nnumerical implementation of stellar feedback resulting from momentum imparted\nto the ISM by radiation, supernovae, and stellar winds. We employ a realistic\ncooling function, and find that a large fraction of the gas cools to <100K, so\nthat the ISM becomes highly inhomogeneous. Despite this, our simulated galaxies\nreach an approximate steady state, in which gas gravitationally collapses to\nform giant molecular clouds (GMCs), dense clumps, and stars; subsequently,\nstellar feedback disperses the GMCs, repopulating the diffuse ISM. This\ncollapse and dispersal cycle is seen in models of SMC-like dwarfs, the\nMilky-Way, and z~2 clumpy disk analogues. The simulated global star formation\nefficiencies are consistent with the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.\nMoreover, the star formation rates are nearly independent of the numerically\nimposed high-density star formation efficiency, density threshold, and density\nscaling. This is a consequence of the fact that, in our simulations, star\nformation is regulated by stellar feedback limiting the amount of very dense\ngas available for forming stars. In contrast, in simulations without stellar\nfeedback, i.e. under the action of only gravity and gravitationally-induced\nturbulence, the ISM experiences runaway collapse to very high densities. In\nthese simulations without feedback, the global star formation rates exceed\nobserved galactic star formation rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude,\ndemonstrating that stellar feedback is crucial to the regulation of star\nformation in galaxies. \n\n"}

We use a large, cosmological, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation\nto investigate how this decline is related to the evolution of gas accretion\nand to outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the drop\nin the star formation rate follows a corresponding decline in the global\ncold-mode accretion rate density onto haloes, but with a delay of order the gas\nconsumption time scale in the interstellar medium. Here we define cold-mode\n(hot-mode) accretion as gas that is accreted and whose temperature has never\nexceeded (did exceed) 10^5.5 K. In contrast to cold-mode accretion, which peaks\nat z~3, the hot mode continues to increase to z~1 and remains roughly constant\nthereafter. By the present time, the hot mode strongly dominates the global\naccretion rate onto haloes. Star formation does not track hot-mode halo\naccretion because most of the hot halo gas never accretes onto galaxies. AGN\nfeedback plays a crucial role by preferentially preventing gas that entered\nhaloes in the hot mode from accreting onto their central galaxies.\nConsequently, in the absence of AGN feedback, gas accreted in the hot mode\nwould become the dominant source of fuel for star formation and the drop off in\nthe cosmic star formation rate would be much less steep. \n\n"}

First, we divide the\ngalaxy sample in 32 subsamples based on the similarities between the full\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the galaxies. For each of these 32\ngalaxy types we construct a composite SED by de-redshifting and scaling the\nobserved photometry. This approach increases the signal-to-noise ratio and\nsampling of galaxy SEDs and allows for model-independent stellar population\nstudies. The composite SEDs are of spectroscopic quality, and facilitate -- for\nthe first time -- Halpha measurement for a large magnitude-limited sample of\ndistant galaxies. The linewidths indicate a photometric redshift uncertainty of\ndz<0.02x(1+z). The composite SEDs also show the Balmer and 4000 Angstrom\nbreaks, MgII absorption at ~2800 Angstrom, the dust absorption feature at 2175\nAngstrom, and blended [OIII]+Hbeta emission.

We formulate a\nsystematic theoretical framework of entropy-based statistical mechanics for\nspherically symmetric collisionless self-gravitating systems. We use an\napproach that is very different from that of the conventional statistical\nmechanics of short-range interaction systems. We demonstrate that the\nequilibrium states of self-gravitating systems consist of both mechanical and\nstatistical equilibria, with the former characterized by a series of\nvelocity-moment equations and the latter by statistical equilibrium equations,\nwhich should be derived from the entropy principle. The velocity-moment\nequations of all orders are derived from the steady-state collisionless\nBoltzmann equation. We point out that the ergodicity is invalid for the whole\nself-gravitating systems, but it can be re-established locally. Based on the\nlocal ergodicity, using Fermi-Dirac-like statistics, with the nondegenerate\ncondition and the spatial independence of the local microstates, we rederive\nthe Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. This is consistent with the validity of the\ncollisionless Boltzmann equation, and should be the correct entropy form for\ncollisionless self-gravitating systems. Apart from the usual constraints of\nmass and energy conservation, we demonstrate that the series of moment or\nvirialization equations must be included as additional constraints on the\nentropy functional when performing the variational calculus; this is an\nextension to the original prescription by White & Narayan. Any possible\nvelocity distribution can be produced by the statistical-mechanical approach\nthat we have developed with the extended Boltzmann-Gibbs/White-Narayan\nstatistics.

This is the first detection of a BAL,\nwhich is sometimes seen in powerful quasars with high accretion rates, in a BL\nLac object.

When\nsufficient gas is driven towards the BH, gravitational instabilities\ngenerically form lopsided, eccentric disks that propagate inwards. The lopsided\nstellar disk exerts a strong torque on the gas disk, driving inflows that fuel\nrapid BH growth. Here, we investigate whether the same gas disk is the 'torus'\ninvoked to explain obscured AGN. The disk is generically thick and has\ncharacteristic ~1-10 pc sizes and masses resembling those required of the\ntorus. The scale heights and obscured fractions of the predicted torii are\nsubstantial even in the absence of strong stellar feedback providing the\nvertical support. Rather, they can be maintained by strong bending modes and\nwarps excited by the inflow-generating instabilities. Other properties commonly\nattributed to feedback processes may be explained by dynamical effects:\nmisalignment between torus and host galaxy, correlations between local SFR and\nturbulent gas velocities, and dependence of obscured fractions on AGN\nluminosity or SFR. We compare the predicted torus properties with observations\nof gas surface density profiles, kinematics, scale heights, and SFR densities\nin AGN nuclei, and find that they are consistent.

TreeCol therefore forms the basis\nfor a fast, approximate method for modelling the attenuation of radiation\nwithin large numerical simulations. It constructs a HEALPix sphere at any\ndesired location and accumulates the column density by walking the tree and by\nadding up the contributions from all tree nodes whose line of sight contributes\nto the pixel under consideration. In particular when combined with widely-used\ntree-based gravity solvers the new scheme requires little additional\ncomputational cost. In a simulation with $N$ resolution elements, the\ncomputational cost of TreeCol scales as $N \\log N$, instead of the $N^{5/3}$\nscaling of most other radiative transfer schemes. TreeCol is naturally\nadaptable to arbitrary density distributions and is easy to implement and to\nparallelize.

We review the known ring systems of the four giant planets, as well as\nthe prospects for ring systems yet to be discovered. We then review planetary\nrings by type. The main rings of Saturn comprise our system's only dense broad\ndisk and host many phenomena of general application to disks including spiral\nwaves, gap formation, self-gravity wakes, viscous overstability and normal\nmodes, impact clouds, and orbital evolution of embedded moons.

This was accomplished using proper\nmotion measurements within the central region of the cluster, obtained with the\nlaser guide star adaptive optics system at Keck Observatory over a 3 year time\nbaseline (2006-2009). This uniform dataset results in proper motion\nmeasurements that are improved by a factor ~5 over previous measurements from\nheterogeneous instruments, yielding internal velocity dispersion estimates 0.15\n+/- 0.01 mas/yr, which corresponds to 5.4 +/- 0.4 km/s at a distance of 8.4\nkpc.\n  Projecting a simple model for the cluster onto the sky to compare with our\nproper motion dataset, in conjunction with surface density data, we estimate\nthe total present-day mass of the cluster to be 15,000 (+7400 -6000) Solar\nmasses.

The disk is proposed to\nhave formed when a stellar black hole flew by the star, tidally disrupted its\nenvelope, and placed the star on its present orbit with some of the tidal\ndebris forming a disk. A disrupting encounter at the location of the observed\ncloud is most likely to be caused by a stellar black hole because of the\nexpected dynamical mass segregation; the rate of these disk-forming encounters\nmay be as high as $\\sim 10^{-6}$ per year. The star should also be spun up by\nthe encounter, so the disk may subsequently expand by absorbing angular\nmomentum from the star. Once the disk expands up to the tidal truncation\nradius, the tidal perturbation of the outer disk edge at every peribothron may\nplace gas streams on larger orbits which can give rise to a photoevaporation\nwind that forms the cloud at every orbit. This model predicts that, after the\ncloud is disrupted at the next peribothron passage in 2013, a smaller\nunresolved cloud will gradually grow around the star on the same present orbit.\nAn increased infrared luminosity from the disk may also be detectable when the\nperibothron is reached.

On one hand,\nradiative emission drastically decreases the thermal energy content of the\ninterstellar plasma (ISM), inducing a slow cooling flow toward the centre. On\nthe other hand, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) struggles to prevent the\nrunaway cooling catastrophe, injecting huge amount of energy in the ISM. The\npresent study intends to deeply investigate the role of mechanical AGN feedback\nin (isolated or massive) elliptical galaxies, extending and completing the mass\nrange of tested cosmic environments. Our previously successful feedback models,\nin galaxy clusters and groups, demonstrated that AGN outflows, self-regulated\nby cold gas accretion, are able to properly quench the cooling flow, without\ndestroying the cool core.

Simple calculations suggest too low a slope and too\nhigh a scatter, and recent semi-analytic models and numerical galaxy\nsimulations typically fail to reproduce some aspects of the relation.\nFurthermore, the assumptions underlying one model are often inconsistent with\nthose behind another. This paper aims to develop a rigorous prediction for the\nBTFR in the context of LCDM, using only a priori expected effects and\nrelations, a minimum of theoretical assumptions, and no free parameters. The\nrobustness of the relation to changes in key galactic parameters will be\nexplored. I adopt a modular approach, taking each of the stand alone galaxy\nrelations necessary for constructing the BTFR from up-to-date numerical\nsimulations of dark halos. These relations -- and their expected scatter -- are\nused to describe model spirals with a range of masses, resulting in a band in\nthe space of the BTFR that represents the current best guess for the LCDM\nprediction. Consistent treatment of expected LCDM effects goes a large way\ntowards reconciling the naive slope-3 LCDM prediction with the data, especially\nin the range 10^9 M_sun < M_bar < 10^11 M_sun. The theoretical BTFR becomes\nsignificantly curved at M_bar > 10^11 M_sun, but this is difficult to test\nobservationally due to the scarcity of extremely high mass spirals. Low mass\ngas-rich galaxies have systematically lower rotational velocity than the LCDM\nprediction, although the relation used to describe baryon mass fractions must\nbe extrapolated in this regime. The fact that the BTFR slope derived here is\nsignificantly greater than in early predictions is a direct consequence of a\ncorresponding increase in the expected sensitivity of baryon mass fraction to\ntotal halo mass. \n\n"}

Several recent studies\nargue that the loss of summer sea ice does not involve an irreversible\nbifurcation, because it is highly reversible in models. However, a broader\ndefinition of a `tipping point' also includes other abrupt, non-linear changes\nthat are neither bifurcations nor necessarily irreversible. Examination of\nsatellite data for Arctic sea-ice area reveals an abrupt increase in the\namplitude of seasonal variability in 2007 that has persisted since then. We\nidentified this abrupt transition using recently developed methods that can\ndetect multi-modality in time-series data and sometimes forewarn of\nbifurcations. When removing the mean seasonal cycle (up to 2008) from the\nsatellite data, the residual sea-ice fluctuations switch from uni-modal to\nmulti-modal behaviour around 2007. We originally interpreted this as a\nbifurcation in which a new lower ice cover attractor appears in deseasonalised\nfluctuations and is sampled in every summer-autumn from 2007 onwards. However,\nthis interpretation is clearly sensitive to how the seasonal cycle is removed\nfrom the raw data, and to the presence of continental land masses restricting\nwinter-spring ice fluctuations. Furthermore, there was no robust early warning\nsignal of critical slowing down prior to the hypothesized bifurcation. Early\nwarning indicators do however show destabilization of the summer-autumn sea-ice\ncover since 2007. Thus, the bifurcation hypothesis lacks consistent support,\nbut there was an abrupt and persistent increase in the amplitude of the\nseasonal cycle of Arctic sea-ice cover in 2007, which we describe as a\n(non-bifurcation) `tipping point'.

For 6 of the 13\nhosts for which Lya is not detected we place fairly strong 3sigma upper limits\non the EW (<20A), while for others the EW is either unconstrained or has a less\nconstraining upper limit.

We complement this sample of\nA-type stars with intrinsically brighter, intermediate-age, asymptotic giant\nbranch stars. A set of 4 distant cool carbon stars is compiled from the\nliterature and we perform spectroscopic follow-up on a further 4 N-type carbon\nstars using the WHT-ISIS instrument. Altogether, this provides us with the\nlargest sample to date of individual star tracers out to r ~ 150 kpc.

These H II regions are discrete objects, but most multiwavelength models\nof starbursts assume a uniform medium of ionized gas, if they include the\nabsorption at all.

The cross sections are calculated by assuming that H II regions\nare Str\\\"omgren spheres. The coefficient asymptotes to a constant value at low\nfrequencies, because H II regions partially cover the starburst, and are buried\npart way into the starburst's synchrotron emitting material.

One possible explanation is the increased difficulty of detecting\nthese haloes if most of the visible matter is lost at early evolutionary phases\nthrough galactic winds. In this work we study the current models of triggering\ngalactic winds in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) from supernovae, and study,\nbased on 3D hydrodynamic numerical simulations, the correlation of the mass\nloss rates and important physical parameters as the dark matter halo mass and\nits radial profile, and the star formation rate. We find that the existence of\nwinds is ubiquitous, independent on the gravitational potential. Our\nsimulations revealed that the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) may play a\nmajor role on pushing matter out of these systems, even for very massive\nhaloes. The instability is responsible for 5 - 40% of the mass loss during the\nearly evolution of the galaxy, being less relevant at $t > 200$Myrs.

They cause angular momentum to be\nredistributed within the galaxy, emitted mainly from (near-)resonant material\nat the inner Lindblad resonance of the bar, and absorbed mainly by\n(near-)resonant material in the spheroid (i.e., the halo and, whenever\nrelevant, the bulge) and in the outer disk. Spheroids delay and slow down the\ninitial growth of the bar they host, but, at the later stages of the evolution,\nthey strengthen the bar by absorbing angular momentum. Increased velocity\ndispersion in the (near-)resonant regions delays bar formation and leads to\nless strong bars. When bars form they are vertically thin, but soon their inner\nparts puff up and form what is commonly known as the boxy/peanut bulge. This\ngives a complex and interesting shape to the bar which explains a number of\nobservations and also argues that the COBE/DIRBE bar and the Long bar in our\nGalaxy are, respectively, the thin and the thick part of a single bar. The\nvalue of the bar pattern speed may be set by optimising the balance between\nemitters and absorbers, so that a maximum amount of angular momentum is\nredistributed. As they evolve, bars grow stronger and rotate slower.

Contrary to conventional perception, we find that\nthe global light distribution of the majority (>75%) of elliptical galaxies is\nnot well described by a single Sersic function.

Abstract: Using collisionless N-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky\nWay (MW) we construct realistic models of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies of\nthe Local Group. The dwarfs are initially composed of stellar disks embedded in\ndark matter haloes with different inner density slopes and are placed on an\neccentric orbit typical for MW subhaloes. After a few Gyr of evolution the\nstellar component is triaxial as a result of bar instability induced by tidal\nforces. Observing the simulated dwarfs along three principal axes of the\nstellar component we create mock data sets and determine the their half-light\nradii and line-of-sight velocity dispersions. Using the estimator proposed by\nWolf et al. we calculate masses within half-light radii. The masses obtained\nthis way are over(under)estimated by up to a factor of two when the line of\nsight is along the longest (shortest) axis of the stellar component. We then\ndivide the initial stellar distribution into an inner and outer population and\ntrace their evolution in time. The two populations, although affected by tidal\nforces, retain different density profiles even after a few Gyr. We measure the\nhalf-light radii and velocity dispersions of the stars in the two populations\nalong different lines of sight and use them to estimate the slope of the mass\ndistribution in the dwarfs following the method proposed by Walker &\nPenarrubia. The inferred slopes are systematically over- or underestimated,\ndepending on the line of sight. In particular, when the dwarf is seen along the\nlongest axis of the stellar component, a significantly shallower density\nprofile is inferred than the real one measured from the simulations. Since most\ndSphs are non-spherical and their orientation with respect to our line of sight\nis unknown, the method can be reliably applied only to a large sample of dwarfs\nwhen these systematic errors are expected to be diminished. \n\n"}

Far-infrared\n  cooling lines in low-mass young stellar objects Abstract: (Abridged) Far-infrared Herschel-PACS spectra of 18 low-mass protostars of\nvarious luminosities and evolutionary stages are studied. We quantify their\nfar-infrared line emission and the contribution of different atomic and\nmolecular species to the gas cooling budget during protostellar evolution. We\nalso determine the spatial extent of the emission and investigate the\nunderlying excitation conditions. Most of the protostars in our sample show\nstrong atomic and molecular far-infrared emission. Water is detected in 17\nobjects, including 5 Class I sources. The high-excitation H2O line at 63.3\nmicron is detected in 7 sources. CO transitions from J=14-13 up to 49-48 are\nfound and show two distinct temperature components on Boltzmann diagrams with\nrotational temperatures of ~350 K and ~700 K. H2O has typical excitation\ntemperatures of ~150 K. Emission from both Class 0 and I sources is usually\nspatially extended along the outflow direction but with a pattern depending on\nthe species and the transition. The H2O line fluxes correlate strongly with\nthose of the high-J CO lines, as well as with the bolometric luminosity and\nenvelope mass. They correlate less strongly with OH and not with [OI] fluxes.\nThe PACS data probe at least two physical components. The H2O and CO emission\nlikely arises in non-dissociative (irradiated) shocks along the outflow walls\nwith a range of pre-shock densities. Some OH is also associated with this\ncomponent, likely resulting from H2O photodissociation. UV-heated gas\ncontributes only a minor fraction to the CO emission observed by PACS, based on\nthe strong correlation between the shock-dominated CO 24-23 line and the CO\n14-13 line.

Abstract: We investigate the large-scale clustering and gravitational interaction of\nbaryons and dark matter (DM) over cosmic time using a set of collisionless\nN-body simulations. Both components, baryons and DM, are evolved from distinct\nprimordial density and velocity power spectra as predicted by early-universe\nphysics. We first demonstrate that such two-component simulations require an\nunconventional match between force and mass resolution (i.e. force softening on\nat least the mean particle separation scale). Otherwise, the growth on any\nscale is not correctly recovered because of a spurious coupling between the two\nspecies at the smallest scales. With these simulations, we then demonstrate how\nthe primordial differences in the clustering of baryons and DM are\nprogressively diminished over time. In particular, we explicitly show how the\nBAO signature is damped in the spatial distribution of baryons and imprinted in\nthat of DM. This is a rapid process, yet it is still not fully completed at low\nredshifts. On large scales, the overall shape of the correlation function of\nbaryons and DM differs by 2% at z = 9 and by 0.2% at z = 0. The differences in\nthe amplitude of the BAO peak are approximately a factor of 5 larger: 10% at z\n= 9 and 1% at z = 0. These discrepancies are, however, smaller than effects\nexpected to be introduced by galaxy formation physics in both the shape of the\npower spectrum and in the BAO peak, and are thus unlikely to be detected given\nthe precision of the next generation of galaxy surveys. Hence, our results\nvalidate the standard practice of modelling the observed galaxy distribution\nusing predictions for the total mass clustering in the Universe. \n\n"}

The model requires the following two key ingredients: (i) mass assembly\nhistories of central and satellite galaxies, and (ii) local observational\nconstraints of the star formation rates of central galaxies as function of halo\nmass. We obtain a universal fitting formula that describes the (median) SFH of\ncentral galaxies as function of halo mass, galaxy stellar mass and redshift. We\nuse this model to make predictions for various aspects of the star formation\nrates of central galaxies across cosmic time. Our main findings are the\nfollowing. (1) The specific star formation rate (SSFR) at high $z$ increases\nrapidly with increasing redshift [$\\propto (1+z)^{2.5}$] for halos of a given\nmass and only slowly with halo mass ($\\propto M_h^{0.12}$) at a given $z$, in\nalmost perfect agreement with the specific mass accretion rate of dark matter\nhalos.

We compare\nour view of gas flows in M51 -- which arise due to departures from axi-symmetry\nin the gravitational potential (i.e. the nuclear bar and spiral arms) -- with\nthe global pattern of star formation as traced by Halpha and 24\\mu m emission.\nWe find that the dynamical environment of GMCs strongly affects their ability\nto form stars, in the sense that GMCs situated in regions with large streaming\nmotions can be stabilized, while similarly massive GMCs in regions without\nstreaming go on to efficiently form stars. We argue that this is the result of\nreduced surface pressure felt by clouds embedded in an ambient medium\nundergoing large streaming motions, which prevents collapse. Indeed, the\nvariation in gas depletion time expected based on the observed streaming\nmotions throughout the disk of M51 quantitatively agrees with the variation in\nobserved gas depletion time scale.

Consolidating\nthe confidence levels during cross-correlation studies, understanding the\nartefacts induced by sampling irregularities, establishing detection limits for\nfuture observatories are just some of the applications of simulated data sets.\nCurrently, the widely used methodology of amplitude and phase randomisation is\nable to produce artificial light curves which have a given underlying power\nspectral density (PSD) but which are strictly Gaussian distributed. This\nrestriction is a significant limitation, since the majority of the light curves\ne.g. active galactic nuclei, X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts show strong\ndeviations from Gaussianity exhibiting `burst-like' events in their light\ncurves yielding long-tailed probability distribution functions (PDFs). In this\nstudy we propose a simple method which is able to precisely reproduce light\ncurves which match both the PSD and the PDF of either an observed light curve\nor a theoretical model.

While the\nspectrum, intensity, and angular distribution of this signal is in good\nagreement with predictions from annihilating dark matter, it has also been\nsuggested that a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars could be\nresponsible for this excess GeV emission from the Inner Galaxy. In this paper,\nwe consider this later possibility in detail. Comparing the observed spectral\nshape of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess to the spectrum measured from 37\nmillisecond pulsars by Fermi, we find that these sources exhibit a spectral\nshape that is much too soft at sub-GeV energies to accommodate this signal. We\nalso construct population models to describe the spatial distribution and\nluminosity function of the Milky Way's millisecond pulsars. After taking into\naccount constraints from the observed distribution of Fermi sources (including\nboth sources known to be millisecond pulsars, and unidentified sources which\ncould be pulsars), we find that millisecond pulsars can account for no more\nthan ~10% of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess.

This is generally\nderived employing a collisional MHD model. However, in the ICM the ion mean\nfree path between collisions is of the order of the dynamical scales, thus\nrequiring a collisionless MHD description. Unlike collisional MHD simulations,\nour study uses an anisotropic plasma pressure with respect to the direction of\nthe local magnetic field, which brings the plasma within a parameter space\nwhere collisionless instabilities should take place. Within the adopted model\nthese instabilities are contained at bay through the relaxation term of the\npressure anisotropy which simulates the feedback of the mirror and firehose\ninstabilities. This relaxation acts to get the plasma distribution function\nconsistent with the empirical studies of collisionless plasmas. Our 3D\nnumerical simulations of forced transonic turbulence motivated by modeling of\nthe turbulent ICM are performed for different initial values of the magnetic\nfield intensity, and different relaxation rates of the pressure anisotropy. We\nfound that in the high beta plasma regime corresponding to the ICM conditions,\na fast anisotropy relaxation rate gives results which are similar to the\ncollisional-MHD model as far as the statistical properties of the turbulence\nare concerned. Also, the amplification of seed magnetic fields due to the\nturbulent dynamo action is similar to the collisional-MHD model. Our\nsimulations that do not employ the anisotropy relaxation deviate significantly\nfrom the collisional-MHD results, and show more power at the small-scale\nfluctuations of both density and velocity representing the results of the\ninstabilities.

By combining\nempirical constraints derived for star formation at low gas column densities\nand metallicities in the local universe with a model for dark matter and\nbaryonic mass assembly, we provide an analytical description of how the dwarf\nspheroidals acquired their stellar content. Their progenitors formed stars\nuntil the gas content, initially reduced from the cosmic average by the thermal\npressure of the reionized intergalactic medium, was finally ram pressure\nstripped during the progenitors' accretion on to the host galaxy. Dwarf\nspheroidal satellites of differing luminosities seem to share very similar most\nmassive progenitor histories that reach thresholds for gas cooling by atomic\nline emission at epochs at which the Lagrangian volume of the Local Group\nshould have been reionized.

In most starbursts, the supernova\nremnants blast open a hot phase that fills the regions and launches a\nsuperwind. Denser starbursts are too overpressured for hot wind formation, but\nsupernovae still stir up the ISM. I argue that supernovae power ubiquitous\nturbulence through each of the starburst ISM phases, including the hot wind,\nand that a fluctuation dynamo amplifies magnetic fields until they are in\nequipartition with the turbulence. Supernovae can drive turbulence with speeds\nof ~1000 km/s in the hot wind and ~20 km/s in the cold molecular gas, depending\non the outer scale. I predict magnetic field strengths of 70 muG in the\nGalactic Center starburst, 300 muG in M82 and NGC 253, and 2 mG in Arp 220's\nnuclei. The mean magnetic field strengths are a few times stronger in molecular\ngas than in hot winds, but do not vary strongly with density within a\nstarburst. I explain how the dominance of supernova-driven turbulence leads to\nnear equipartition between the components of starburst ISM. I also consider\nimplications for cosmic ray (CR) diffusion in starbursts. The high amounts of\npower cascading to small scales could confine CRs very effectively in\nstarbursts, so much that CR transport is dominated by the flow of gas rather\nthan diffusion through the gas. In addition, I discuss the effects of\nturbulence on X-ray line width, the far-infrared--radio correlation, observed\nradio polarization, and Faraday rotation measures.

Our simulations include fully explicit treatment of both the\nmulti-phase ISM (molecular through hot) and stellar feedback. The stellar\nfeedback inputs (energy, momentum, mass, and metal fluxes) are taken directly\nfrom stellar population models. These sources of stellar feedback, with zero\nadjusted parameters, reproduce the observed relation between stellar and halo\nmass up to M_halo~10^12 M_sun (including dwarfs, satellites, MW-mass disks, and\nsmall groups).

We predict weak redshift\nevolution in the M_star-M_halo relation, consistent with current constraints to\nz>6. We find that the M_star-M_halo relation is insensitive to numerical\ndetails, but is sensitive to the feedback physics. Simulations with only\nsupernova feedback fail to reproduce the observed stellar masses, particularly\nin dwarf and high-redshift galaxies: radiative feedback (photo-heating and\nradiation pressure) is necessary to disrupt GMCs and enable efficient coupling\nof later supernovae to the gas. Star formation rates agree well with the\nobserved Kennicutt relation at all redshifts. The galaxy-averaged Kennicutt\nrelation is very different from the numerically imposed law for converting gas\ninto stars in the simulation, and is instead determined by self-regulation via\nstellar feedback.

In\ncontrast, the spectrum of secondary positrons produced through the collisions\nof cosmic rays in the interstellar medium is predicted to fall rapidly with\nenergy, and thus is unable to account for the observed rise.

We describe a numerical scheme, tests, and an\nastrophysically relevant application using the M1 radiation closure within a\nnew three-dimensional (3D) general relativistic (GR) radiation (R)\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) massively parallel code called HARMRAD. Our 3D\nGRRMHD simulation of super-Eddington accretion (about $20$ times Eddington)\nonto a rapidly rotating BH (dimensionless spin $j=0.9375$) shows sustained\nnon-axisymmemtric disk turbulence, a persistent electromagnetic jet driven by\nthe Blandford-Znajek effect, and a total radiative output consistently near the\nEddington rate. The total accretion efficiency is of order $20\\%$, the\nlarge-scale electromagnetic jet efficiency is of order $10\\%$, and the total\nradiative efficiency that reaches large distances remains low at only order\n$1\\%$. However, the radiation jet and the electromagnetic jet both emerge from\na geometrically beamed polar region, with super-Eddington isotropic equivalent\nluminosities. Such simulations with HARMRAD can enlighten the role of BH spin\nvs.\\ disks in launching jets, help determine the origin of spectral and\ntemporal states in x-ray binaries, help understand how tidal disruption events\n(TDEs) work, provide an accurate horizon-scale flow structure for M87 and other\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN), and isolate whether AGN feedback is driven by\nradiation or by an electromagnetic, thermal, or kinetic wind/jet.

For radio emission from a helical magnetic field,\nthe polarization as a function of the square of the wavelength becomes\nasymmetric with respect to zero. Mathematically speaking, the resulting\nemission occurs then either at observable or at unobservable (imaginary)\nwavelengths. We demonstrate that rotation measure (RM) synthesis allows for the\nreconstruction of the underlying Faraday dispersion function in the former\ncase, but not in the latter. The presence of positive magnetic helicity can\nthus be detected by observing positive RM in highly polarized regions in the\nsky and negative RM in weakly polarized regions.

Comparison of Model with\n  Simulation Results Abstract: We compare subhalo mass and velocity functions obtained from different\nsimulations with different subhalo finders among each other, and with\npredictions from the new semi-analytical model of Jiang & van den Bosch (2014).\nWe find that subhalo mass functions (SHMFs) obtained using different subhalo\nfinders agree with each other at the level of ~ 20 percent, but only at the low\nmass end. At the massive end, subhalo finders that identify subhaloes based\npurely on density in configuration space dramatically underpredict the subhalo\nabundances by more than an order of magnitude. These problems are much less\nsevere for subhalo velocity functions (SHVFs), indicating that they arise from\nissues related to assigning masses to the subhaloes, rather than from detecting\nthem.

Therefore, conformity manifestly\nviolates the widely adopted assumption that the dark matter halo mass Mvir\nexclusively governs galaxy occupation statistics. This paper is the first in a\nseries studying the implications of the observed conformity signal for the\ngalaxy-dark matter connection. We show that recent measurements of conformity\non scales R ~1-5 Mpc imply that central galaxy quenching statistics cannot be\ncorrectly predicted with the knowledge of Mvir alone. We also demonstrate that\nejected (or `backsplash') satellites cannot give rise to the signal. We then\ninvoke the age matching model, which is predicated on the co-evolution of\ngalaxies and halos.

We construct the\nfiducial model so that it reproduces the observationally estimated galaxy\nstellar mass functions and the relationships between the galaxy stellar mass\nand the host halo mass from $z = 4$ to 0. We find that the fiducial model\nconstructed this way naturally explains the cosmic star formation history, the\ngalaxy downsizing, and the star formation rate and metallicity of the\nstar-forming galaxies. The simulations without the quenching of the gas cooling\nin large halos overproduce massive galaxies at $z < 2$ and fail to reproduce\ngalaxy downsizing. The simulations that do not employ the radiation pressure\nfeedback from young stars predict too strong redshift evolution of the\nmass-metallicity relation. Furthermore, the slope of the relation becomes too\nsteep at low redshift without the radiation pressure feedback. The metallicity\ndependence in the radiation pressure feedback is a key to explain the observed\nmass-metallicity relation. These facts indicate that these two processes in\naddition to supernova feedback are essential for galaxy evolution.

{"id": "1410.1075", "contents": "Title: Formation of stars and clusters over cosmological time Abstract: The concept that stars form in the modern era began some 60 years ago with\nthe key observation of expanding OB associations. Now we see that these\nassociations are an intermediate scale in a cascade of hierarchical structures\nthat begins on the ambient Jeans length close to a kiloparsec in size and\ncontinues down to the interiors of clusters, perhaps even to binary and\nmultiple stellar systems. The origin of this structure lies with the dynamical\nnature of cloud and star formation, driven by supersonic turbulence and\ninterstellar gravity. Dynamical star formation is relatively fast compared to\nthe timescale for cosmic accretion, and then the star formation rate keeps up\nwith the accretion rate, leading to a sequence of near-equilibrium states\nduring galaxy formation and evolution. Dynamical star formation also helps to\nexplain the formation of bound clusters, which require a local efficiency that\nexceeds the average by more than an order of magnitude. Efficiency increases\nwith density in a hierarchically structured gas. Cluster formation should vary\nwith environment as the relative degree of cloud self-binding varies, and this\ndepends on the ratio of the interstellar velocity dispersion to the galaxy\nrotation speed. As this ratio increases, galaxies become more clumpy, thicker,\nand have more tightly bound star-forming regions. The formation of old globular\nclusters is understood in this context, with the metal-rich and metal-poor\nglobulars forming in high-mass and low-mass galaxies, respectively, because of\nthe galactic mass-metallicity relation. Metal-rich globulars remain in the\ndisks and bulge regions where they formed, while metal-poor globulars get\ncaptured as parts of satellite galaxies and end up in today's spiral galaxy\nhalos. Blue globulars in the disk could have formed very early when the whole\nMilky Way had a low mass. \n\n"}

The\nfeedback runs implement the full physics model of the Illustris simulation\nproject, including star formation driven galactic winds and energetic feedback\nfrom supermassive blackholes. We explore: (a) the accretion rate of material\ncontributing to the net growth of galaxies and originating directly from the\nintergalactic medium, finding that feedback strongly suppresses the raw, as\nwell as the net, inflow of this \"smooth mode\" gas at all redshifts, regardless\nof the temperature history of newly acquired gas.

Because of their extensive\nwavelength coverage, proximity, and nearly face-on geometry, the Magellanic\nClouds (MCs) provide a unique opportunity to study these processes in great\ndetail. In this paper we use the complete sample of supernova remnants (SNRs)\nin the MCs to calculate the lifetime and destruction efficiencies of silicate\nand carbon dust in these galaxies. We find dust lifetimes of 22 +- 13 Myr (30\n+- 17 Myr) for silicate (carbon) grains in the LMC, and 54 +- 32 Myr (72 +- 43\nMyr) for silicate (carbon) grains in the SMC. The significantly shorter\nlifetimes in the MCs, as compared to the Milky Way, are explained as the\ncombined effect of their lower total dust mass, and the fact that the\ndust-destroying isolated SNe in the MCs seem to be preferentially occurring in\nregions with higher than average dust-to-gas (D2G) mass ratios. We also\ncalculate the supernova rate and the current star formation rate in the MCs,\nand use them to derive maximum dust injection rates by asymptotic giant branch\nstars and core collapse supernovae. We find that the injection rates are an\norder of magnitude lower than the dust destruction rates by the SNRs.

Abstract: Many things in current interstellar dust studies are taken as well understood\ngivens by much of the community. For example, it is widely held that\ninterstellar dust is made up of only three components, i.e., astronomical\nsilicates, graphite and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and that our\nunderstanding of these is now complete and sufficient enough to interpret\nastronomical observations of dust in galaxies. To zeroth order this is a\nreasonable approximation. However, while these three pillars of dust modelling\nhave been useful in advancing our understanding over the last few decades, it\nis now apparent that they are insufficient to explain the observed evolution of\nthe dust properties from one region to another. Thus, it is time to abandon the\nthree pillars approach and to seek more physically-realistic interstellar dust\nanalogues. The analy- sis of the pre-solar grains extracted from meteorites,\ninterplanetary dust particles and from the Stardust mission, and the\ninterpretation of x-ray scattering and absorption observations, supports the\nview that our current view of the interstellar dust composition(s) is indeed\ntoo naive. The aim of this review is to point out where our current views are\nrather secure and, perhaps more importantly, where they are far from secure and\nwe must re-think our ideas. To this aim ten as- pects of interstellar dust will\nbe scrutinised and re-evaluated in terms of their validity within the current\nobservational, experimental, modelling and theoretical constraints.

The simulations account for the hydrodynamical feedback from\nphotoionization heating and the explosion of massive stars as supernovae (SNe).\nOur reference simulation, which was carried out in a box of size 25 comoving\nMpc/h using 2 x 512^3 particles, produces a reasonable reionization history and\nmatches the observed UV luminosity function of galaxies. Simulations with\ndifferent box sizes and resolutions are used to investigate numerical\nconvergence, and simulations in which either SNe or photoionization heating or\nboth are turned off, are used to investigate the role of feedback from star\nformation. Ionizing radiation is treated using accurate radiative transfer at\nthe high spatially adaptive resolution at which the hydrodynamics is carried\nout. SN feedback strongly reduces the star formation rates (SFRs) over nearly\nthe full mass range of simulated galaxies and is required to yield SFRs in\nagreement with observations. Photoheating helps to suppress star formation in\nlow-mass galaxies, but its impact on the cosmic SFR is small. Because the\neffect of photoheating is masked by the strong SN feedback, it does not imprint\na signature on the UV galaxy luminosity function, although we note that our\nresolution is insufficient to model star-forming minihaloes cooling through\nmolecular hydrogen transitions.

PKS 2254-367 and the radio source in NGC 1052 (PKS 0238-084;\nD=17.2 Mpc) are the two closest GPS radio sources to us, far closer than the\nnext closest example, PKS 1718-649 (D=59 Mpc). As such, IC 1459 and NGC 1052\noffer opportunities to study the details of the pc-scale radio sources as well\nas the environments that the radio sources inhabit, across the electromagnetic\nspectrum. Given that some models for the origin and evolution of GPS radio\nsources require a strong connection between the radio source morphology and the\ngaseous nuclear environment, such opportunities for detailed study are\nimportant. Our VLBI images of PKS 2254-367 show that the previously identified\nsimilarities between IC 1459 and NGC 1052 continue onto the pc-scale.

I\nemphasize two advances: 1 - \"Classical bulges\" are observationally\nindistinguishable from ellipticals, and like them, are thought to form by major\ngalaxy mergers. \"Disky pseudobulges\" are diskier and more actively star-forming\n(except in S0s) than are ellipticals. Theys are products of the slow\n(\"secular\") evolution of galaxy disks: bars and other nonaxisymmetries move\ndisk gas toward the center, where it starbursts and builds relatively flat,\nrapidly rotating components. This secular evolution is a new area of galaxy\nevolution work that complements hierarchical clustering. 2 - Disks of\nhigh-redshift galaxies are unstable to the formation of mass clumps that sink\nto the center and merge - an alternative channel for the formation of classical\nbulges. I review successes and unsolved problems in the formation of\nbulges+ellipticals and their coevolution (or not) with supermassive black\nholes. I present an observer's perspective on simulations of dark matter galaxy\nformation including baryons. I review how our picture of the quenching of star\nformation is becoming general and secure at redshifts z < 1. The biggest\nchallenge is to produce realistic bulges+ellipticals and disks that overlap\nover a factor of 10**3 in mass but that differ from each other as observed over\nthat whole range. Second, how does hierarchical clustering make so many giant,\nbulgeless galaxies in field but not cluster environments?

We use a million spectra targeting\nLuminous Red Galaxies at z<0.8, after subtracting a best fit model galaxy\nspectrum from each one, as an estimate of the high-redshift Lya surface\nbrightness. The quasar-Lya emission cross-correlation we detect has a shape\nconsistent with a LambdaCDM model with Omega_M =0.30^+0.10-0.07. The predicted\namplitude of this cross-correlation is proportional to the product of the mean\nLya surface brightness, <mu_alpha>, the amplitude of mass fluctuations, and the\nquasar and Lya emission bias factors. Using known values, we infer\n<mu_alpha>(b_alpha/3) = (3.9 +/- 0.9) x 10^-21 erg/s cm^-2 A^-1 arcsec^-2,\nwhere b_alpha is the Lya emission bias factor. If the dominant sources of Lya\nemission are star forming galaxies, we infer rho_SFR = (0.28 +/- 0.07)\n(3/b_alpha) /yr/Mpc^3 at z=2-3.5. For b_alpha=3, this value is a factor of\n21-35 above previous estimates from individually detected Lya emitters,\nalthough consistent with the total rho_SFR derived from dust-corrected,\ncontinuum UV surveys. 97% of the Lya emission in the Universe at these\nredshifts is therefore undetected in previous surveys of Lya emitters.

Abstract: Young tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) are observed in the tidal debris of\ngas-rich interacting galaxies. In contrast to what is generally assumed to be\nthe case for isolated dwarf galaxies, TDGs are not embedded in their own dark\nmatter (DM) sub-halo. Hence, they are more sensitive to stellar feedback and\ncould be disrupted on a short time-scale. Detailed numerical and observational\nstudies demonstrate that isolated DM-dominated dwarf galaxies can have\nlifetimes of more than 10 Gyr. For TDGs that evolve in a tidal field with\ncompressing accelerations equal to the gravitational acceleration within a DM\nsub-halo typical of an isolated dwarf galaxy, a similar survival time is\nexpected. The tidal acceleration profile depends on the virial mass of the host\ngalaxy and the distance between the TDG and its host. We analytically compare\nthe tidal compression to the gravitational acceleration due to either cuspy or\ncored DM sub-halos of various virial masses. For example, the tidal field at a\ndistance of 100 kpc to a host halo of 10^13 Msol can be as stabilizing as a\n10^9 Msol DM sub-halo. By linking the tidal field to the equivalent\ngravitational field of a DM sub-halo, we can use existing models of isolated\ndwarfs to estimate the survivability of TDGs.

Abstract: We assess a model of late cosmic reionization in which the ionizing\nbackground radiation arises entirely from high redshift quasars and other\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs). The low optical depth to Thomson scattering\nreported by the Planck Collaboration pushes the redshift of instantaneous\nreionization down to z=8.8^{+1.7}_{-1.4} and greatly reduces the need for\nsignificant Lyman-continuum emission at very early times. We show that, if\nrecent claims of a numerous population of faint AGNs at z=4-6 are upheld, and\nthe high inferred AGN comoving emissivity at these epochs persists to higher,\nz~10, redshifts, then active galaxies may drive the reionization of hydrogen\nand helium with little contribution from normal star-forming galaxies. We\ndiscuss an AGN-dominated scenario that satisfies a number of observational\nconstraints: the HI photoionization rate is relatively flat over the range\n2<z<5, hydrogen gets fully reionized by z=5.7, and the integrated Thomson\nscattering optical depth is tau=0.056, in agreement with measurements based on\nthe Lya opacity of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) polarization.

We have implemented our proposal in Balrog, a software\npackage which embeds fake objects in real imaging in order to accurately\ncharacterize measurement biases.\n  We demonstrate this technique with an angular clustering measurement using\nDark Energy Survey (DES) data. We first show that recovery of our injected\ngalaxies depends on a wide variety of survey characteristics in the same way as\nthe real data.

The resulting extinction map has >4 times better resolution\nthan maps of dust emission, while providing a more direct measurement of the\ndust column. There is superb morphological agreement between the new map and\nmaps of the extinction inferred from dust emission by Draine et al. 2014.\nHowever, the widely-used Draine & Li (2007) dust models overpredict the\nobserved extinction by a factor of ~2.5, suggesting that M31's true dust mass\nis lower and that dust grains are significantly more emissive than assumed in\nDraine et al.

Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are\nsufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using\nonly the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,\norder-of-magnitude errors. \n\n"}

If two galaxies each\nhosting a central BH merge, the BHs would be dragged towards the center of the\nnewly formed galaxy. If/when the holes get sufficiently close, they coalesce\nvia the emission of gravitational waves. How often two BHs are involved in\ngalaxy mergers depends crucially on how many galaxies host BHs and on the\ngalaxy merger history. It is therefore necessary to start with full\ncosmological models including BH physics and a careful dynamical treatment.\nAfter galaxies have merged, however, the BHs still have a long journey until\nthey touch and coalesce.

Using numerical simulations, we examine the\nsegregation of twelve different subhalo properties with respect to both orbital\nenergy and halo-centric radius (in real space as well as in projection).\nSubhaloes are strongly segregated by accretion redshift, which is an outcome of\nthe inside-out assembly of their host haloes. Since subhaloes that were\naccreted earlier have experienced more tidal stripping, subhaloes that have\nlost a larger fraction of their mass at infall are on more bound orbits.\nSubhaloes are also strongly segregated in their masses and maximum circular\nvelocities at accretion. We demonstrate that part of this segregation is\nalready imprinted in the infall conditions. For massive subhaloes it is\nsubsequently boosted by dynamical friction, but only during their first radial\norbit. The impact of these two effects is counterbalanced, though, by the fact\nthat subhaloes with larger accretion masses are accreted later. Because of\ntidal stripping, subhaloes reveal little to no segregation by present-day mass\nor maximum circular velocity, while the corresponding torques cause subhaloes\non more bound orbits to have smaller spin. There is a weak tendency for\nsubhaloes that formed earlier to be segregated towards the center of their host\nhalo, which is an indirect consequence of the fact that (sub)halo formation\ntime is correlated with other, strongly segregated properties.

We examine the\neffect of streaming velocities on the galaxy correlation function, including\nall leading-order contributions for the first time. We find that the impact on\nthe BAO peak is dramatically enhanced (by a factor of ~5) over the results of\nprevious investigations, with the primary new effect due to advection: if a\ngalaxy retains memory of the primordial streaming velocity, it does so at its\nLagrangian, rather than Eulerian, position. Since correlations in the streaming\nvelocity change rapidly at the BAO scale, this advection term can cause a\nsignificant shift in the observed BAO position. If streaming velocities impact\ntracer density at the 1% level, compared to the linear bias, the recovered BAO\nscale is shifted by approximately 0.5%.

Simple theories of isothermal fragmentation successfully\nreproduce the core mass function (CMF) which has a very similar shape to the\ninitial mass function (IMF) of stars. However, numerical simulations of\nisothermal turbulent fragmentation thus far have not succeeded in identifying a\nfragment mass scale that is independent of the simulation resolution. Moreover,\nthe fluid equations for magnetized, self-gravitating, isothermal turbulence are\nscale-free, and do not predict any characteristic mass. In this paper we show\nthat, although an isothermal self-gravitating flow does produce a CMF with a\nmass scale imposed by the initial conditions, this scale changes as the parent\ncloud evolves. In addition, the cores that form undergo further fragmentation\nand after sufficient time forget about their initial conditions, yielding a\nscale-free pure power-law distribution $\\mathrm{d} N/\\mathrm{d} M\\propto\nM^{-2}$ for the stellar IMF. We show that this problem can be alleviated by\nintroducing additional physics that provides a termination scale for the\ncascade.

As primary examples, we take two recent (and discrepant)\nmeasurements of the total mass within 50 kpc of the Galaxy and find they imply\nvery different mass profiles and stellar masses for the Galaxy. The\ndark-matter-only version of the Illustris simulation enables us to compute the\neffects of galaxy formation on such constraints on a halo-by-halo basis; on\nsmall scales, galaxy formation enhances the density relative to\ndark-matter-only runs, while the total mass density is approximately 20% lower\nat large Galactocentric distances.

In particular, this preferred axis is strongly aligned with\nthose in the CMB quadrupole and octopole, as well as that in the CMB kinematic\ndipole, which hints to their non-cosmological origin. In realistic\nobservations, the foreground residuals are inevitable, and should be properly\nmasked out in order to avoid possible misinterpretation of the results. In this\npaper, we extend our previous analyses to the masked Planck 2015 data.

Baryon content of the bright cluster sample Abstract: Traditionally, galaxy clusters have been expected to retain all the material\naccreted since their formation epoch. For this reason, their matter content\nshould be representative of the Universe as a whole, and thus their baryon\nfraction should be close to the Universal baryon fraction. We make use of the\nsample of the 100 brightest galaxy clusters discovered in the XXL Survey to\ninvestigate the fraction of baryons in the form of hot gas and stars in the\ncluster population. We measure the gas masses of the detected halos and use a\nmass--temperature relation directly calibrated using weak-lensing measurements\nfor a subset of XXL clusters to estimate the halo mass. We find that the\nweak-lensing calibrated gas fraction of XXL-100-GC clusters is substantially\nlower than was found in previous studies using hydrostatic masses. Our best-fit\nrelation between gas fraction and mass reads $f_{\\rm\ngas,500}=0.055_{-0.006}^{+0.007}\\left(M_{\\rm\n500}/10^{14}M_\\odot\\right)^{0.21_{-0.10}^{+0.11}}$. The baryon budget of galaxy\nclusters therefore falls short of the Universal baryon fraction by about a\nfactor of two at $r_{\\rm 500}$.

However,\nthe processes that couple jet power to the ambient medium and determine jet\nmorphology are poorly understood.

This leads\nto substantial uncertainties in redshifts and fluxes that are derived from the\nobservations with one specific NB. In this work we demonstrate that the\nuncertainty in measured line parameters can be sharply reduced by using\nrepeated observations of the same target field with filters that have slightly\ndifferent transmittance curves. Such data are routinely collected with some\nlarge field imaging cameras that use multiple detectors and a separate filter\nfor each of the detectors.

Wide-field near-IR surveys with HST are generally inefficient,\nas guide star acquisitions make it impractical to observe more than one\npointing per orbit. This limitation can be circumvented by guiding with gyros\nalone, which is possible as long as the telescope has three functional gyros.\nThe method presented here allows us to observe mosaics of eight independent\nWFC3-IR pointings in a single orbit by utilizing the fact that HST drifts by\nonly a very small amount in the 25 seconds between non-destructive reads of\nunguided exposures. By shifting the reads and treating them as independent\nexposures the full resolution of WFC3 can be restored.

Class 1 system\noscillations can be found at small, intermediate, or large radii but we focus\non a limited set of Class 1 systems that have oscillations in the central\nregions, usually at $\\log(r/r_{-2})\\lesssim -2$, where $r_{-2}$ is the largest\nradius where $d\\log(\\rho)/d\\log(r)=-2$. We show that the shape of their $N(E)$\ncan roughly predict the amplitude of oscillations. Class 2 systems which are a\nproduct of dynamical evolution, consist of observed and simulated galaxies and\nclusters, and pure dark matter halos. Oscillations in the density profile slope\nseem pervasive in the central regions of Class 2 systems. We argue that in\nthese systems, slope oscillations are an indication that a system is not fully\nrelaxed. We show that these oscillations can be reproduced by small\nmodifications to $N(E)$ of DARKexp. These affect a small fraction of systems'\nmass and are confined to $\\log(r/r_{-2})\\lesssim 0$.

We find that this system is a post\ncore passage, dissociative, binary merger, with the optical galaxy density\npeaks of each subcluster leading their associated X-ray emission peaks. This\nseparation occurs because the diffuse gas experiences ram pressure forces while\nthe effectively collisionless galaxies (and presumably their associated dark\nmatter halos) do not. This system contains double peaked diffuse radio\nemission, possibly a double radio relic with the relics lying along the merger\naxis and also leading the X-ray cores. We find evidence for a temperature peak\nassociated with the SW relic, likely created by the same merger shock that is\npowering the relic radio emission in this region. Thus, this system is a\nrelatively rare clean example of a dissociative binary merger, which can in\nprinciple be used to place constraints on the self-interaction cross-section of\ndark matter.

In one of the leading formation\nscenarios, a black hole of $\\sim100$ M$_{\\odot}$ results from the collapse of\nthe inner core of a supermassive star ($\\gtrsim 10^{4-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$), created\nby the rapid accumulation ($\\gtrsim 0.1 $ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) of pristine\ngas at the centre of newly formed galaxies at $z\\sim 15$.

To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon. Less massive quasi-stars could form but last\nfor only $\\lesssim 10^4$ years before the accretion luminosity unbinds the\nenvelope, suppressing the black hole growth. We speculate that this might\neventually lead to a dual black hole seed population: (i) massive ($>10^{4}$\nM$_{\\odot}$) seeds formed in the most massive ($> 10^{8}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and rare\nhaloes; (ii) lighter ($\\sim 10^{2}$ M$_{\\odot}$) seeds to be found in less\nmassive and therefore more common haloes. \n\n"}

For this purpose, we implement a specifically tailored\ncomponent-separation method, the so-called generalized needlet internal linear\ncombination (GNILC) method, which uses spatial information (the angular power\nspectra) to disentangle the Galactic dust emission and CIB anisotropies.

Stellar populations are the building blocks of galaxies including\nthe Milky Way. The majority, if not all extragalactic studies are entangled\nwith the use of stellar population models given the unresolved nature of their\nobservation. Extragalactic systems contain multiple stellar populations with\ncomplex star formation histories. However, their study is mainly based upon the\nprinciples of simple stellar populations (SSP). Hence, it is critical to\nexamine the validity of SSP models. AIMS. This work aims to empirically test\nthe validity of SSP models. This is done by comparing SSP models against\nobservations of spatially resolved young stellar population in the\ndetermination of its physical properties, i.e. age and metallicity. METHODS.\nIntegral field spectroscopy of a young stellar cluster in the Milky Way, NGC\n3603, is used to study the properties of the cluster both as a resolved and\nunresolved stellar population. The unresolved stellar population is analysed\nusing the H$\\alpha$ equivalent width as an age indicator, and the ratio of\nstrong emission lines to infer metallicity. In addition, spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fitting using STARLIGHT, is used to infer these properties\nfrom the integrated spectrum. Independently, the resolved stellar population is\nanalysed using the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for age and metallicity\ndetermination. As the SSP model represents the unresolved stellar population,\nthe derived age and metallicity are put to test whether they agree with those\nderived from resolved stars. RESULTS. The age and metallicity estimate of NGC\n3603 derived from integrated spectroscopy are confirmed to be within the range\nof those derived from the CMD of the resolved stellar population, including\nother estimates found in the literature.

We\nmeasure the local relation from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the\nintermediate redshift relation from the Smithsonian Hectospec Lensing Survey.\nBoth samples are highly complete (>85%) and we consistently measure the stellar\nmass and velocity dispersion for the two samples. The M-sigma relation and its\nscatter are independent of redshift with sigma ~ M^0.3 for M>10^10.3 M_solar.\nThe measured slope of the M-sigma relation is the same as the scaling between\nthe total halo mass and the dark matter halo velocity dispersion obtained by\nN-body simulations. This consistency suggests that massive quiescent galaxies\nare virialized systems where the central dark matter concentration is either a\nconstant or negligible fraction of the stellar mass.

The efficacy of delay-coordinate mapping has long been\nsupported by Takens' embedding theorem, which guarantees that delay-coordinate\nmaps use the time-series output to provide a reconstruction of the hidden state\nspace that is a one-to-one embedding of the system's attractor. While this\ntopological guarantee ensures that distinct points in the reconstruction\ncorrespond to distinct points in the original state space, it does not\ncharacterize the quality of this embedding or illuminate how the specific\nparameters affect the reconstruction. In this paper, we extend Takens' result\nby establishing conditions under which delay-coordinate mapping is guaranteed\nto provide a stable embedding of a system's attractor. Beyond only preserving\nthe attractor topology, a stable embedding preserves the attractor geometry by\nensuring that distances between points in the state space are approximately\npreserved. In particular, we find that delay-coordinate mapping stably embeds\nan attractor of a dynamical system if the stable rank of the system is large\nenough to be proportional to the dimension of the attractor. The stable rank\nreflects the relation between the sampling interval and the number of delays in\ndelay-coordinate mapping.

The magnetic pressure elevates most of the gas carrying the accretion\nflow at $R$ to large heights $z > 0.1 R$ and low densities, while leaving a\nthin dense layer containing most of the mass --- but contributing very little\naccretion --- around the equator. We show that such a disk model leads\nnaturally to the formation of a broad emission line region through thermal\ninstability. Extrapolating to larger radii, we demonstrate that local\ngravitational instability and associated star formation are strongly suppressed\ncompared to standard disk models for AGN, although star formation in the\nequatorial zone is predicted for sufficiently high mass supply rates. This new\nclass of accretion disk models thus appears capable of resolving two\nlongstanding puzzles in the theory of AGN fueling: the formation of broad\nemission line regions and the suppression of fragmentation thought to inhibit\naccretion at the required rates.

A number of\ncorrelations between the DRW model parameters, the signal decorrelation\ntimescale and amplitude, and the physical AGN parameters such as the black hole\nmass or luminosity have been reported. Aims: We are interested in whether it is\nplausible to correctly measure the DRW parameters from a typical ground-based\nsurvey, in particular how accurate the recovered DRW parameters are compared to\nthe input ones. Methods: By means of Monte Carlo simulations of AGN light\ncurves, we study the impact of the light curve length, the source magnitude,\ncadence, and additional light on the DRW model parameters. Results: The most\nsignificant finding is that currently existing surveys are going to return\nunconstrained DRW decorrelation timescales, because typical rest-frame data do\nnot probe long enough timescales or the white noise part of PSD for DRW. The\nexperiment length must be at least ten times longer than the true DRW\ntimescale, being presumably in the vicinity of one year, meaning a minimum\n10-years-long AGN light curves (rest-frame). The DRW timescales for\nsufficiently long light curves are typically weakly biased, and the exact bias\ndepends on the fitting method and used priors. The DRW amplitude is mostly\naffected by the photometric noise (so the source magnitude or the\nsignal-to-noise ratio), cadence, and the AGN host light. Conclusions: Because\nthe DRW parameters appear to be incorrectly determined from typically existing\ndata, the reported correlations of the DRW variability and physical AGN\nparameters from other works seem unlikely to be correct. In particular, the\nanti-correlation of the DRW timescale with redshift is a manifestation of the\nsurvey length being too short.

We report the discovery of a hot companion\nassociated with one of the blue straggler stars (BSSs) in the old open cluster,\nNGC188. Using fluxes measured in four filters in UVIT's Far-UV (FUV) channel,\nand two filters in the near-UV (NUV) channel, we have constructed the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) of the star WOCS-5885, after combining with flux\nmeasurements from GALEX, UIT, UVOT, SPITZER, WISE and several ground-based\nfacilities. The resulting SED spans a wavelength range of 0.15~${\\mu}$m to\n7.8~${\\mu}$m. This object is found to be one of the brightest FUV sources in\nthe cluster. An analysis of the SED reveals the presence of two components. The\ncooler component is found to have a temperature of 6,000$\\pm$150~K, confirming\nthat it is a BSS. Assuming it to be a main-sequence star, we estimate its mass\nto be $\\sim$ 1.1 - 1.2M$_\\odot$.

The near- infrared photometry (JK filters) was obtained\nby the European Southern Observatory (ESO) public survey \"VISTA near-infrared\nY; J;Ks survey of the Magellanic Clouds system\"(VMC). For each pulsator\nisoperiodic model sequences have been computed by adopting a nonlinear\nconvective hydrodynamical code in order to reproduce the multi- filter light\nand (when available) radial velocity curve amplitudes and morphological\ndetails. The inferred individual distances provide an intrinsic mean value for\nthe SMC distance modulus of 19.01 mag and a standard deviation of 0.08 mag, in\nagreement with the literature. Moreover the instrinsic masses and luminosities\nof the best fitting model show that all these pulsators are brighter than the\ncanonical evolutionary Mass- Luminosity relation (MLR), suggesting a\nsignificant efficiency of core overshooting and/or mass loss.

Recently, measures of dynamical complexity such as integrated\ninformation have been proposed. However, problems related to the normalization\nand Bell number of partitions associated to these measures make these\napproaches computationally infeasible for large-scale brain networks.

These model-independent `cosmic\nchronometers' can therefore be powerful discriminators for testing different\ncosmologies.

Using data\nfrom SDSS, we explore the evidence for such a feature in the density profiles\nof galaxy clusters and investigate the connection between this feature and a\npossible phase space boundary.

We find evidence of an abrupt change in the galaxy colors that\ncoincides with the location of the steepening of the density profile.

We present a photometric survey of PNe in the galaxy's\nextended halo to characterise its PN population, as well as the surrounding\nintragroup light (IGL) of the Subcluster B. PNe were identified based on their\nbright [OIII]5007 \\AA\\ emission and absence of a broad-band continuum. We\nidentify 738 PNe out to a radius of 155 kpc from M49's centre from which we\ndefine a complete sample of 624 PNe within a limiting magnitude of m_5007=28.8.\nComparing the PN number density to the broad-band stellar surface brightness\nprofile, we find a variation of the PN-specific frequency (alpha-parameter)\nwith radius. The outer halo beyond 60 kpc has a 3.2 times higher\nalpha-parameter compared to the main galaxy halo, which is likely due to\ncontribution from the surrounding blue IGL. We use the Planetary Nebulae\nLuminosity Function (PNLF) as an indicator of distance and stellar population.\nIts slope, which correlates empirically with galaxy type, varies within the\ninner halo. In the eastern quadrant of M49, the PNLF slope is shallower,\nindicating an additional localised, bright PN population following an accretion\nevent, likely that of the dwarf irregular galaxy VCC1249.

This situation arises when the mass of the scalar\nfield distribution is much smaller than the black hole mass, and following the\nanalogies with the hair in the literature we dubbed these long-lived field\nconfigurations wigs.

We seek the triggers as the probabilistically feasible solutions of an\nappropriately constrained optimization problem, where the function to be\nmaximized is a system observable exhibiting intermittent extreme bursts. The\nconstraints are imposed to ensure the physical admissibility of the optimal\nsolutions, i.e., significant probability for their occurrence under the natural\nflow of the dynamical system. We apply the method to a body-forced\nincompressible Navier--Stokes equation, known as the Kolmogorov flow.

We show, for the first time, that the \"Halpha excess\"\ngalaxies clearly have a bimodal distribution on the SFR-M* plane: they lie on\nthe main sequence of star formation (with log10(sSFR/yr^{-1})<-8.05) or in a\nstarburst cloud (with log10(sSFR/yr^{-1}) >-7.60). The latter contains ~15% of\nall the objects in our sample and accounts for >50% of the cosmic SFR density\nat z=3.9-4.9, for which we derive a robust lower limit of 0.066 Msun yr^{-1}\nMpc^{-3}. Finally, we identify an unusual >50sigma overdensity of z=3.9-4.9\ngalaxies within a 0.20 x 0.20 sq. arcmin region.

Abstract: Dark matter (DM) haloes forming near the thermal cut-off scale of the density\nperturbations are unique, since they are the smallest objects and form through\nmonolithic gravitational collapse, while larger haloes contrastingly have\nexperienced mergers. While standard cold dark matter (CDM) simulations readily\nproduce haloes that follow the universal Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density\nprofile with an inner slope, $\\rho \\propto r^{-\\alpha}$, with $\\alpha=1$,\nrecent simulations have found that when the free-streaming cut-off expected for\nthe CDM model is resolved, the resulting haloes follow nearly power-law density\nprofiles of $\\alpha\\sim1.5$. In this paper, we study the formation of density\ncusps in haloes using idealized $N$-body simulations of the collapse of\nproto-haloes. When the proto-halo profile is initially cored due to particle\nfree-streaming at high redshift, we universally find $\\sim r^{-1.5}$ profiles\nirrespective of the proto-halo profile slope outside the core and large-scale\nnon-spherical perturbations. Quite in contrast, when the proto-halo has a\npower-law profile, then we obtain profiles compatible with the NFW shape when\nthe density slope of the proto-halo patch is shallower than a critical value,\n$\\alpha_{\\rm ini} \\sim 0.3$, while the final slope can be steeper for\n$\\alpha_{\\rm ini}\\ga 0.3$. We further demonstrate that the $r^{-1.5}$ profiles\nare sensitive to small scale noise, which gradually drives them towards an\ninner slope of $-1$, where they become resilient to such perturbations. We\ndemonstrate that the $r^{-1.5}$ solutions are in hydrostatic equilibrium,\nlargely consistent with a simple analytic model, and provide arguments that\nangular momentum appears to determine the inner slope. \n\n"}

Then, by exploiting the spectroscopic sample we\nderived the stellar mass profiles of the clusters.\n  We got the luminosity profiles of 46 galaxy clusters, reaching $r_{200}$ in\n30 cases, and the stellar mass profiles of 42 of our objects. We successfully\nfitted all the integrated luminosity growth profiles with one or two embedded\nS\\'ersic components, deriving the main clusters parameters.\n  Finally, we checked the main scaling relation among the clusters parameters\nin comparison with those obtained for a selected sample of early-type galaxies\n(ETGs) of the same clusters.\n  We found that the nearby galaxy clusters are non-homologous structures like\nETGs and exhibit a color-magnitude (CM) red-sequence relation very similar to\nthat observed for galaxies in clusters. These properties are not expected in\nthe current cluster formation scenarios. In particular the existence of a CM\nrelation for clusters, shown here for the first time, suggests that the\nbaryonic structures grow and evolve in a similar way at all scales. \n\n"}

It has been suggested that\nPBHs of tens of solar masses could serve as dark matter candidates. Recent\nanalytical studies demonstrated that compact ultra-faint dwarf galaxies can\nserve as a sensitive test for the PBH dark matter hypothesis, since stars in\nsuch a halo-dominated system would be heated by the more massive PBHs, their\npresent-day distribution can provide strong constraints on PBH mass. In this\nstudy, we further explore this scenario with more detailed calculations, using\na combination of dynamical simulations and Bayesian inference methods. The\njoint evolution of stars and PBH dark matter is followed with a Fokker-Planck\ncode PhaseFlow. We run a large suite of such simulations for different dark\nmatter parameters, then use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to constrain\nthe PBH properties with observations of ultra-faint galaxies.

We explore the fraction of cool-core (CC) clusters in a large\nsample of $370$ clusters from IllustrisTNG, examining six common CC\ndefinitions. IllustrisTNG produces continuous CC criteria distributions, the\nextremes of which are classified as CC and non-cool-core (NCC), and the\ncriteria are increasingly correlated for more massive clusters. At $z=0$, the\nCC fractions for $2$ criteria are in reasonable agreement with the observed\nfractions but the other $4$ CC fractions are lower than observed. This result\nis partly driven by systematic differences between the simulated and observed\ngas fraction profiles. The simulated CC fractions with redshift show tentative\nagreement with the observed fractions, but linear fits demonstrate that the\nsimulated evolution is steeper than observed. The conversion of CCs to NCCs\nappears to begin later and act more rapidly in the simulations. Examining the\nfraction of CCs and NCCs defined as relaxed we find no evidence that CCs are\nmore relaxed, suggesting that mergers are not solely responsible for disrupting\nCCs. A comparison of the median thermodynamic profiles defined by different CC\ncriteria shows that the extent to which they evolve in the cluster core is\ndependent on the CC criteria.

Very long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI) enables high-resolution imaging on\nmilli-arcsecond (mas) and sub-mas scales, making it a powerful tool to explore\nthe inner jet structure, shedding light on the formation, acceleration and\ncollimation of AGN jets.

The image noise levels\nin our observations are typically 0.3 mJy beam$^{-1}$ and 1.5 mJy beam$^{-1}$\nat 43 and 86 GHz, respectively. Compared with the VLBI data observed at lower\nfrequencies from the literature, our observations with higher resolution (the\nhighest resolution up to 0.07 mas at 86 GHz and 0.18 mas at 43 GHz) and at\nhigher frequencies detected new jet components at sub-parsec scales, offering\nvaluable data for studies of the physical properties of innermost jets.

In this paper, we critically\nreview those constraints and find several caveats on the analysis. First of\nall, the constraints on the fraction $\\alpha$ of PBH in matter seem to be\ndriven by a very restrictive choice of priors on the cosmological parameters.\nIn particular, the degeneracy between $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$ and $\\alpha$ is ignored\nand thus, by fixing $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$, transferred the constraining power of SN\nmagnitudes to $\\alpha$. Furthermore, by considering more realistic physical\nsizes for the type-Ia supernovae, we find an effect on the SN lensing\nmagnification distribution that leads to significantly looser constraints.\nMoreover, considering a wide mass spectrum of PBH, such as a lognormal\ndistribution, further softens the constraints from SN lensing.

It is well known that a massive\nspherical component such as halo in a disk galaxy can make it bar stable. In\nthis study we explore the effect of another spherical component, the bulge, on\nbar formation in disk galaxies. In our models we vary both the bulge mass and\nconcentration.

Thus, we create a series of mock data sets of SEAMBHs, especially in\nthe high redshift region, to check their abilities to probe the cosmology. To\nfulfill the potential of the SEAMBHs on the cosmology, we apply the simulated\ndata to three projects.

We find\nthat the high redshift SEAMBHs can help to break the degeneracies of the\nbackground cosmological parameters constrained by {\\it Planck} and JLA, thus\ngiving much tighter constraints of the cosmological parameters. The second uses\nthe high redshift SEAMBHs as the complements of the low redshift JLA to\nconstrain the early expansion rate and the dark energy density evolution in the\ncold dark matter frame. Our results show that these high redshift SEAMBHs are\nvery powerful on constraining the early Hubble rate and the evolution of the\ndark energy density; thus they can give us more information about the expansion\nhistory of our Universe, which is also crucial for testing the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel in the high redshift region.

We\nshow that the bias is a multivariate function of halo properties that falls\ninto three regimes. For massive haloes, halo mass explains the majority of bias\nvariation. For early-forming haloes, bias depends sensitively on the recent\nmass accretion history.

While state-of-the art\nsimulations excel at reproducing galactic disk properties, many struggle to\ndrive strong galactic winds or to match the observed ionization structure of\nthe CGM using only thermal supernova feedback. To remedy this, recent studies\nhave invoked non-thermal cosmic ray (CR) stellar feedback prescriptions.\nHowever, numerical schemes of CR transport are still poorly constrained. We\nexplore how the choice of CR transport affects the multiphase structure of the\nsimulated CGM. We implement anisotropic CR physics in the astrophysical\nsimulation code, {\\sc Enzo} and simulate a suite of isolated disk galaxies with\nvarying prescriptions for CR transport: isotropic diffusion, anisotropic\ndiffusion, and streaming. We find that all three transport mechanisms result in\nstrong, metal-rich outflows but differ in the temperature and ionization\nstructure of their CGM. Isotropic diffusion results in a spatially uniform,\nwarm CGM that underpredicts the column densities of low-ions. Anisotropic\ndiffusion develops a reservoir of cool gas that extends further from the\ngalactic center, but disperses rapidly with distance. CR streaming projects\ncool gas out to radii of 200 kpc, supporting a truly multiphase medium. In\naddition, we find that streaming is less sensitive to changes in constant\nparameter values like the CR injection fraction, transport velocity, and\nresolution than diffusion.

J-PLUS sources exhibit two\ndistinct populations in the r-band magnitude vs. concentration plane,\ncorresponding to compact and extended sources. We modelled the two-population\ndistribution with a skewed Gaussian for compact objects and a log-normal\nfunction for the extended ones. The derived model and the number density prior\nbased on J-PLUS EDR data were used to estimate the Bayesian probability of a\nsource to be star or galaxy. This procedure was applied pointing-by-pointing to\naccount for varying observing conditions and sky position. Finally, we combined\nthe morphological information from g, r, and i broad bands in order to improve\nthe classification of low signal-to-noise sources. The derived probabilities\nare used to compute the pointing-by-pointing number counts of stars and\ngalaxies. The former increases as we approach to the Milky Way disk, and the\nlatter are similar across the probed area. The comparison with SDSS in the\ncommon regions is satisfactory up to r ~ 21, with consistent numbers of stars\nand galaxies, and consistent distributions in concentration and (g - i) colour\nspaces. We implement a morphological star/galaxy classifier based on PDF\nanalysis, providing meaningful probabilities for J-PLUS sources to one\nmagnitude deeper (r ~ 21) than a classical boolean classification.

The WL effect depends on the lensing potential (LP) caused by matter\nperturbations, the distribution of which at cosmological scales is given by the\nmatter power spectrum (MPS). Therefore, the WL effect on the CMB $B$ mode is\naffected by the MPS. Considering the effect of the ensemble average energy\ndensity of the PMF, which we call \"the background PMF,\" on the MPS, the\namplitude of MPS is suppressed in the wave number range of $k>0.01~h$\nMpc$^{-1}$.The MPS affects the LP and the WL effect in the CMB $B$ mode;\nhowever, the PMF can damp this effect. Previous studies of the CMB $B$ mode\nwith the PMF have only considered the vector and tensor modes. These modes\nboost the CMB $B$ mode in the multipole range of $\\ell > 1000$, whereas the\nbackground PMF damps the CMB $B$ mode owing to the WL effect in the entire\nmultipole range.

Following these processes is computationally\nchallenging, so many prescriptions model this feedback approximately,\naccounting for the local destruction of dense gas clouds around newly formed\nstars in lieu of a full radiative transfer calculation. In this work we examine\nhigh resolution simulations (1.8~pc) of an isolated dwarf galaxy with detailed\nstellar feedback tracked on a star-by-star basis. By following stellar ionizing\nradiation with an adaptive ray-tracing radiative transfer method, we test its\nimportance in regulating star formation and driving outflows in this galaxy. We\nfind that including ionizing radiation reduces the star formation rate (SFR) by\nover a factor of 5, and is necessary to produce the ISM conditions needed for\nsupernovae to drive significant outflows. We find that a localized\napproximation for radiation feedback is sufficient to regulate the SFR on short\ntimescales, but does not allow significant outflows. Short and long range\nradiation effects are both important in driving the evolution of our\nlow-metallicity, low-mass dwarf galaxy. Generalizing these results to more\nmassive galaxies would be a valuable avenue of future research. \n\n"}

We investigate the so-called multifractal spectrum and generalised\nfractal dimension of six Hi-GAL regions in the third Galactic quadrant. We\nmeasure systematic variations of the spectrum at increasing wavelength, which\ngenerally correspond to an increasing complexity of the image, and we observe\npeculiar behaviours of the investigated fields, strictly related to the\npresence of high-emission regions, which in turn are connected to star\nformation activity. The same analysis is applied to synthetic column density\nmaps, generated from numerical turbulent molecular cloud models and from\nfractal Brownian motion (fBm), allowing for the confrontation of the\nobservations with models with well controlled physical parameters. This\ncomparison shows that, in terms of multifractal descriptors of the structure,\nfBm images exhibit a very different, quite unrealistic behaviour when compared\nwith Hi-GAL observations, whereas the numerical simulations appear in some\ncases (depending on the specific model) more similar to the observations.\nFinally, the link between mono-fractal parameters (commonly found in the\nliterature) and multifractal indicators is investigated: the former appear to\nbe only partially connected with the latter, with the multifractal analysis\noffering a more extended and complete characterization of the cloud structure. \n\n"}

The ultralight scalar field dark matter,\nconsisting of extremely light bosons with $m \\sim 10^{-22}$ eV and often called\n\"fuzzy\" dark matter, provides intriguing solutions to some challenges at\nsub-Galactic scales for the standard cold dark matter model. As shown by\nKhmelnitsky and Rubakov, such a scalar field in the Galaxy would produce an\noscillating gravitational potential with nanohertz frequencies, resulting in\nperiodic variations in the times of arrival of radio pulses from pulsars. The\nParkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) has been monitoring 20 millisecond pulsars at\ntwo to three weeks intervals for more than a decade. In addition to the\ndetection of nanohertz gravitational waves, PPTA offers the opportunity for\ndirect searches for fuzzy dark matter in an astrophysically feasible range of\nmasses.

Accurate\nnumerical simulations are necessary to make advances in our understanding of\nthis rich physics. Because simulations can capture both the linear and\nnonlinear evolution of perturbations with a relatively wide range of sizes, it\nis important to thoroughly understand the stability of condensation and\nacoustic modes between the two extreme wavelength limits of isobaric and\nisochoric instability as identified by Field (1965). Partially motivated by a\nrecent suggestion that large non-isobaric clouds can `shatter' into tiny\ncloudlets, we revisit the linear theory to survey all possible regimes of\nthermal instability. We uncover seven regimes in total, one of which allows\nthree unstable condensation modes. Using the code Athena++, we determine the\nnumerical requirements to properly evolve small amplitude perturbations of the\nentropy mode into the nonlinear regime. Our 1D numerical simulations\ndemonstrate that for a typical AGN cooling function, the nonlinear evolution of\na single eigenmode in an isobarically unstable plasma involves increasingly\nlarger amplitude oscillations in cloud size, temperature and density as the\nwavelength increases. Such oscillations are the hallmark behavior of\nnon-isobaric multiphase gas dynamics and may be observable as correlations\nbetween changes in brightness and the associated periodic redshifts and\nblueshifts in systems that can be spatially resolved. Intriguingly, we discuss\nregimes and derive characteristic cloud sizes for which the saturation process\ngiving rise to these oscillations can be so energetic that the cloud may indeed\nbreak apart.

The most\nimportant RFB channels on galaxy scales are photo-ionization heating and\nsingle-scattering RP: in all galaxies, most ionizing/far-UV luminosity (~1/2 of\nlifetime-integrated bolometric) is absorbed. In dwarfs, the most important\neffect is photo-ionization heating from the UV background suppressing\naccretion. In MW-mass galaxies, meta-galactic backgrounds have negligible\neffects; but local photo-ionization and single-scattering RP contribute to\nregulating the galactic star formation efficiency and lowering central\ndensities. Without some RFB (or other 'rapid' FB), resolved GMCs convert\ntoo-efficiently into stars, making galaxies dominated by hyper-dense, bound\nstar clusters. This makes star formation more violent and 'bursty' when SNe\nexplode in these hyper-clustered objects: thus, including RFB 'smoothes' SFHs.\nThese conclusions are robust to RHD methods, but M1 produces somewhat stronger\neffects. Like in previous FIRE simulations, IR multiple-scattering is rare\n(negligible in dwarfs, ~10% of RP in massive galaxies): absorption occurs\nprimarily in 'normal' GMCs with A_v~1. \n\n"}

Unlike in the measure-theoretic case, where\nKolmogorov--Sinai entropy is the estimate, in the topological setup the task\nreaches beyond the classical theory of entropy.

The development of this theory was started (in different terminology) by\nthe Moscow topology group in early 1980s. It was motivated by the needs of\nsolid state physics, as a partial (nongeneric) case of Hamiltonian foliations\nof Fermi surfaces with multivalued Hamiltonian function. The unexpected\ndiscoveries of their topological properties that were made in 1980s and 1990s\nhave finally led to nontrivial physical conclusions along the lines of the\nso-called geometric strong magnetic field limit. A very fruitful new point of\nview comes from the reformulation of that problem in terms of quasiperiodic\nfunctions and an extension to higher dimensions made in 1999. One may say that,\nfor single crystal normal metals put in a magnetic field, the semiclassical\ntrajectories of electrons in the space of quasimomenta are exactly the level\nlines of the quasiperiodic function with three quasiperiods that is the\ndispersion relation restricted to a plane orthogonal to the magnetic field.\nGeneral studies of the topological properties of levels of quasiperiodic\nfunctions on the plane with any number of quasiperiods were started in 1999\nwhen certain ideas were formulated for the case of four quasiperiods. The last\nsection of this work contains a complete proof of these results. Some new\nphysical applications of the general problem were found recently. \n\n"}

The latters are discrete subgroups of the group of conformal\nautomorphisms of the Riemann sphere. This dictionary motivated many remarkable\nresults in both domains, starting from the famous Sullivan's no wandering\ndomain theorem in the theory of iterations of rational functions.\n  One of the principal objects used in the study of Kleinian groups is the\nhyperbolic 3- manifold associated to a Kleinian group, which is the quotient of\nits lifted action to the hyperbolic 3- space. M.Lyubich and Y.Minsky have\nsuggested to extend Sullivan's dictionary by providing an analogous\nconstruction for iterations of rational functions. Namely, they have\nconstructed a lamination by three-dimensional manifolds equipped with a\ncontinuous family with hyperbolic metrics on them (may be with singularities).\nThe action of the rational mapping on the sphere lifts naturally up to\nhomeomorphic action on the hyperbolic lamination that is isometric along the\nleaves. The action on the hyperbolic lamination admits a well-defined quotient\ncalled {\\it the quotient hyperbolic lamination}.\n  We study the arrangement of the horospheres in the quotient hyperbolic\nlamination. The main result says that if a rational function does not belong to\na small list of exceptions (powers, Chebyshev and Latt\\`es), then there are\nmany dense horospheres, i.e., the horospheric lamination is\ntopologically-transitive.
