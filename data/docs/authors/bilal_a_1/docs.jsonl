Through the realization of the equivalence principle, which is an\nintrinsic property in symplectic geometry known as the Darboux theorem or the\nMoser lemma, one can understand how diffeomorphism symmetry arises from\nnoncommutative U(1) gauge theory; thus, gravity can emerge from the\nnoncommutative electromagnetism, which is also an interacting theory.

From the general properties of this form of dynamics, the\nstate vector can be further decomposed in well-defined Fock components. In\norder to control the convergence of this expansion, we advocate the use of the\ncovariant formulation of light-front dynamics. In this formulation, the state\nvector is projected on an arbitrary light-front plane $\\omega \\cd x=0$ defined\nby a light-like four-vector $\\omega$. This enables us to control any violation\nof rotational invariance due to the truncation of the Fock expansion.

The present formalism turns out to be simpler than\nthe metric based one in many aspects. Simplifications result from the fact that\nthe conformal factor of the metric, a source of complications in the usual\napproach, does not propagate in the connection formulation even off-shell. This\nsimplifies both the linearized theory and the interactions. For comparison, in\nour approach the complete off-shell cubic GR interaction contains just 3 terms,\nwhich should be compared to at least a dozen terms in the metric formalism. We\nput the technology developed to use and compute the simplest graviton-graviton\nscattering amplitudes. For GR we reproduce the well-known result. For our\nother, distinct from GR, interacting theories of massless spin 2 particles we\nobtain non-zero answers for some parity-violating amplitudes. Thus, in the\nconvention that all particles are incoming, we find that the 4 minus, as well\nas the 3 minus 1 plus amplitudes are zero (as in GR), but the amplitudes with 4\ngravitons of positive helicity, as well as the 3 plus 1 minus amplitudes are\ndifferent from zero. This serves as a good illustration of the type of parity\nviolation present in these theories. We find that the parity-violating\namplitudes are important at high energies, and that a general parity-violating\nmember of our class of theories \"likes\" one helicity (negative in our\nconventions) more than the other in the sense that at high energies it tends to\nconvert all present gravitons into those of negative helicity. \n\n"}

{"id": "1308.0027", "contents": "Title: The abelian confinement mechanism revisited: new aspects of the\n  Georgi-Glashow model Abstract: The confinement problem remains one of the most difficult problems in\ntheoretical physics. An important step toward the solution of this problem is\nthe Polyakov's work on abelian confinement. The Georgi-Glashow model is a\nnatural testing ground for this mechanism which has been surprising us by its\nrichness and wide applicability. In this work, we shed light on two new aspects\nof this model in 2+1 D. First, we develop a many-body description of the\neffective degrees of freedom. Namely, we consider a non-relativistic gas of\nW-bosons in the background of monopole-instanton plasma. Many-body treatment is\na standard toolkit in condensed matter physics. However, we add a new twist by\nsupplying the monopole-instantons as external background field. Using this\nconstruction, we calculate the exact form of the potential between two electric\nprobes as a function of their separation. This potential is expressed in terms\nof the Meijer-G function which interpolates between logarithmic and linear\nbehavior at small and large distances, respectively. Second, we develop a\nsystematic approach to integrate out the effect of the W-bosons at finite\ntemperature in the range 0<T<M_W, where M_W is the W-boson mass, starting from\nthe full relativistic partition function of the Georgi-Glashow model. Using a\nheat kernel expansion that takes into account the non-trivial thermal holonomy,\nwe show that the partition function describes a three-dimensional two-component\nCoulomb gas. We repeat our analysis using the many-body description which\nyields the same result and provides a check on our formalism. At temperatures\nclose to the deconfinement temperature, the gas becomes essentially\ntwo-dimensional recovering the partition function of the dual sine-Gordon model\nthat was considered in a previous work. \n\n"}

The motivation for this work was to achieve a more balanced\ntreatment of the position and momentum variables (aka. holonomies and fluxes).\nIndeed, states in the AL Hilbert spaces describe discrete quantum excitations\non top of a vacuum which is an eigenstate of the flux variables (a\n`no-geometry' state): in such states, most holonomies are totally spread,\nmaking it difficult to approximate a smooth, classical 4-geometry. However,\ngoing beyond the AL sector does not fully resolve this difficulty: one uncovers\na deeper issue hindering the construction of states semi-classical with respect\nto a full set of observables. In the present article, we analyze this issue in\nthe case of real-valued holonomies (we will briefly comment on the heuristic\nimplications for other gauge groups, eg. $\\mathcal{SU}(2)$).

A Generalized Uncertainty\nPrinciple (GUP) that is consistent with the existence of such a maximum\nobservable length scale $l_{max}$ is $\\Delta x \\Delta p \\geq\n\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\;\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha \\Delta x^2}$ where $\\alpha =\nl_{max}^{-2}\\simeq (H_0/c)^2$ ($H_0$ is the Hubble parameter and $c$ is the\nspeed of light). In addition to the existence of a maximum measurable length\n$l_{max}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt \\alpha}$, this form of GUP implies also the existence\nof a minimum measurable momentum $p_{min}=\\frac{3 \\sqrt{3}}{4}\\hbar\n\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. Using appropriate representation of the position and momentum\nquantum operators we show that the spectrum of the one dimensional harmonic\noscillator becomes $\\bar{\\mathcal{E}}_n=2n+1+\\lambda_n \\bar{\\alpha}$ where\n$\\bar{\\mathcal{E}}_n\\equiv 2E_n/\\hbar \\omega$ is the dimensionless properly\nnormalized $n^{th}$ energy level, $\\bar{\\alpha}$ is a dimensionless parameter\nwith $\\bar{\\alpha}\\equiv \\alpha \\hbar/m \\omega$ and $\\lambda_n\\sim n^2$ for\n$n\\gg 1$ (we show the full form of $\\lambda_n$ in the text). For a typical\nvibrating diatomic molecule and $l_{max}=c/H_0$ we find $\\bar{\\alpha}\\sim\n10^{-77}$ and therefore for such a system, this effect is beyond reach of\ncurrent experiments. However, this effect could be more important in the early\nuniverse and could produce signatures in the primordial perturbation spectrum\ninduced by quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field. \n\n"}

Abstract: Understanding gravitational collapse requires understanding how $\\sim\n10^{58}$ nucleons can be destroyed in $\\sim 10^{-5}$ seconds. The recent\nproposal that the endpoint of gravitational collapse can be a \"dark energy\nstar\" implies that the mass-energy of the nucleons undergoing gravitational\ncollapse can be converted to vacuum energy when one gets near to conditions\nwhere classical general relativity predicts that a trapped surface would form.\nThe negative pressure associated with a large vacuum energy prevents an event\nhorizon from forming, thus resolving the long-standing puzzle as to why\ngravitational collapse always leads to an explosion. An indirect consequence is\nthat the reverse process - creation of matter from vacuum energy - should also\nbe possible. Indeed this process may be responsible for the \"big bang\".

It has been shown recently that the conventional $i\\epsilon$\nregularisation prescription for the correlation function leads to non-Lorentz\ninvariant results for the transition rate, and a different regularisation,\ninvolving spatial smearing of the field, has been advocated to replace it.

The solutions used in were however not obtained\nfrom solving exactly the LFD equations but by means of a perturbative\ncalculation with respect to the non relativistic wave function. Since, a\nconsequent effort has been made to obtain exact solutions of LFD equations. The\nfirst results concerning J=0 states in a scalar model have been published in\nnucl-th/9912050. The construction of $J \\ne 0$ states in LFD is complicated by\nthe two following facts. First, the generators of the spatial rotations contain\ninteraction and are thus difficult to handle. Second, one is always forced to\nwork in a truncated Fock space, and consequently, the Poincar\\'e group\ncommutation relations between the generators -- ensuring the correct properties\nof the state vector under rotation -- are in practice destroyed. In the\nstandard approach, with the light-front plane defined as $t+z=0$, this\nviolation of rotational invariance manifests by the fact that the energy\ndepends on the angular momentum projection on $z$-axis.\n  We present here a method to construct $J\\ne0$ states in the explicitly\ncovariant formulation of LFD and show how it leads to a restoration of\nrotational invariance. \n\n"}

It is then hoped that\nprogress in extracting phenomenological predictions from string theory -- such\nas correlations between gauge groups, matter representations, potential values\nof the cosmological constant, and so forth -- can be achieved through\nstatistical studies of these vacua. To date, most of the efforts in these\ndirections have focused on Type I vacua. In this note, we present the first\nresults of a statistical study of the heterotic landscape, focusing on more\nthan 10^5 explicit non-supersymmetric tachyon-free heterotic string vacua and\ntheir associated gauge groups and one-loop cosmological constants. Although\nthis study has several important limitations, we find a number of intriguing\nfeatures which may be relevant for the heterotic landscape as a whole. These\nfeatures include different probabilities and correlations for different\npossible gauge groups as functions of the number of orbifold twists. We also\nfind a vast degeneracy amongst non-supersymmetric string models, leading to a\nsevere reduction in the number of realizable values of the cosmological\nconstant as compared with naive expectations. Finally, we also find strong\ncorrelations between cosmological constants and gauge groups which suggest that\nheterotic string models with extremely small cosmological constants are\noverwhelmingly more likely to exhibit the Standard-Model gauge group at the\nstring scale than any of its grand-unified extensions.

This unfolded, by basic contributions of Kottler, Cartan, van\nDantzig, Schouten & Dorgelo, Toupin & Truesdell, and Post, to what one may call\n{\\em premetric classical electrodynamics.} This framework will be described\nshortly. An analysis is given of the physical dimensions involved in\nelectrodynamics and subsequently the question of units addressed. It will be\npointed out that these results are untouched by the generalization of classical\nto quantum electrodynamics (QED). We compare critically our results with those\nof {\\sl L.B. Okun} which he had presented at a recent conference. \n\n"}

IV Abstract: This note being devoted to some aspects of the inverse problem of\nrepresentation theory explicates the links between researches on the Sklyanin\nalgebras and the author's (based on the noncommutative geometry) approach to\nthe setting free of hidden symmetries in terms of \"the quantization of\nconstants\". Namely, the Racah-Wigner algebra for the Sklyanin algebra is\nconstructed. It may be considered as a result of the quantization of constants\nin the Racah-Wigner algebra for the Lie algebra $sl(2,C)$. The Racah-Wigner\nalgebra for the Sklyanin algebra is an example of the noncommutative weighted\nshift operator algebras (NWSO-algebras), which generalize the mho-algebras\nintroduced by the author earlier. If the Sklyanin algebra is interpreted as an\nalgebra of anomalous spins then the Racah-Wigner algebra for it may be regarded\nas an enlargement of the Sklyanin algebra by operators of the anomalous\nspin-spin interaction (of tensor type). \n\n"}

In one dimension, a new form of the general solution of the\nquantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation leading straightforwardly to the general form\nof the Schr\\\"odinger wave function is proposed.

It is demonstrated that the scattering probabilities of identical\nparticles can be expressed in terms of the basic numbers, which arise naturally\nand logically in this theory. A transcendental equation determining the\ndistribution function of anyons is obtained in terms of the statistics\nparameter, whose limiting values 0 and 1 correspond to Bosons and Fermions\nrespectively. The distribution function is determined as a power series\ninvolving the Boltzmann factor and the statistics parameter and we also express\nthe distribution function as an infinite continued fraction. The last form\nenables one to develop approximate forms for the distribution function, with\nthe first approximant agreeing with our earlier investigation. \n\n"}

We argue that, in deterministic\nhidden-variables theories, the choice of spacetime kinematics should be\ndictated by the properties of generic non-equilibrium states, which allow\nnonlocal signalling. Such signalling provides an operational definition of\nabsolute simultaneity, which may naturally be associated with a preferred\nfoliation of classical spacetime. The argument applies to any deterministic\nhidden-variables theory, and to both flat and curved spacetime backgrounds.
