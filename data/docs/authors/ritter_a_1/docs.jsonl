Asking that this be symplectic gives a\ncurvature inequality first considered by Reznikov. We study this inequality in\nthe case when the base has dimension four, with three main aims. Firstly, we\nuse this approach to construct symplectic six-manifolds with c_1=0 which are\nnever Kahler; e.g., we produce such manifolds with b_1=0=b_3 and also with\nc_2.omega <0, answering questions posed by Smith-Thomas-Yau. Examples come from\nRiemannian geometry, via the Levi-Civita connection on Lambda^+. The underlying\nsix-manifold is then the twistor space and often the symplectic structure tames\nthe Eells-Salamon twistor almost complex structure. Our second aim is to\nexploit this to deduce new results about minimal surfaces: if a certain\ncurvature inequality holds, it follows that the space of minimal surfaces (with\nfixed topological invariants) is compactifiable; the minimal surfaces must also\nsatisfy an adjunction inequality, unifying and generalising results of\nChen--Tian.

One method employs a direct fit to a modified\nblackbody SED; the other involves a comparison of flux ratios to an analytical\nprediction. Fitting fluxes near the SED peak produces inaccurate temperature\nand dust spectral index estimates due to the line of sight temperature (and\ndensity) variations. Longer wavelength fluxes in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the\nspectrum (>~ 600 micron for typical cores) may more accurately recover the\nspectral index, but both methods are very sensitive to noise. The temperature\nestimate approaches the density weighted temperature, or \"column temperature,\"\nof the source as short wavelength fluxes are excluded. An inverse temperature -\nspectral index correlation naturally results from SED fitting, due to the\ninaccurate isothermal assumption, as well as noise uncertainties. We show that\nabove some \"threshold\" temperature, the temperatures estimated through the flux\nratio method can be highly inaccurate. In general, observations with widely\nseparated wavelengths, and including shorter wavelengths, result in higher\nthreshold temperatures; such observations thus allow for more accurate\ntemperature estimates of sources with temperatures less than the threshold\ntemperature.

Cluster masses\n  derived from unresolved photometry Abstract: It is currently common to use spatially unresolved multi-filter broad-band\nphotometry to determine the masses of individual stellar clusters (and hence\nthe cluster mass function, CMF). I analyze the stochastic effects introduced by\nthe sampling of the stellar initial mass function (SIMF) in the derivation of\nthe individual masses and the CMF and I establish that such effects are the\nlargest contributor to the observational uncertainties. An analytical solution,\nvalid in the limit where uncertainties are small, is provided to establish the\nrange of cluster masses over which the CMF slope can be obtained with a given\naccuracy. The validity of the analytical solution is extended to higher mass\nuncertainties using Monte Carlo simulations and the Gamma approximation. The\nvalue of the Poisson mass is calculated for a large range of ages and a variety\nof filters for solar-metallicity clusters measured with single-filter\nphotometry. A method that uses the code CHORIZOS is presented to simultaneously\nderive masses, ages, and extinctions. The classical method of using unweighted\nUBV photometry to simultaneously establish ages and extinctions of stellar\nclusters is found to be unreliable for clusters older than approx. 30 Ma, even\nfor relatively large cluster masses. On the other hand, augmenting the filter\nset to include longer-wavelength filters and using weights for each filter\nincreases the range of masses and ages that can be accurately measured with\nunresolved photometry. Nevertheless, a relatively large range of masses and\nages is found to be dominated by SIMF sampling effects that render the observed\nmasses useless, even when using UBVRIJHK photometry.

In order to match observations, the required rotation rates are\n20-50% of the critical rotation, which are consistent with observed rotation\nrates of similar mass stars in the Galaxy.

We show analytically that\nthe dominant source of energy is often potential energy, released as gas in the\nouter disc attempts to circularize at smaller radii.

However,\nunlike in other models, each process is assumed to have an efficiency which\ndepends only on the host halo mass and redshift. This allows us to describe the\nvarious components of the model in a simple and transparent way. By allowing\nthe efficiencies to have any value for a given halo mass and redshift, we can\neasily encompass a large range of scenarios. To demonstrate this point, we\nexamine several different galaxy formation models, which are all consistent\nwith the observational data. Each model is characterized by a different unique\nfeature: cold accretion in low mass haloes, zero feedback, stars formed only in\nmerger-induced bursts, and shutdown of star-formation after mergers.

As a result, the surface temperature of the star can become\nsignificantly higher than it is in the normal state resulting from\nthermonuclear burning. We wonder whether high energy electrons and gamma-rays,\ninjected within the binary system, can efficiently interact with this enhanced\nradiation field. To decide this, we calculate the optical depths for the\ngamma-ray photons in the radiation field of such irradiated star as a function\nof the phase of the binary system. Based on these calculations, we conclude\nthat compact low mass X-ray binary systems may also become sources of high\nenergy gamma-rays since conditions for interaction of electrons and gamma-rays\nare quite similar to these ones observed within the high mass TeV gamma-ray\nbinaries such as LS 5039 and LSI 303 +61.

However, the\nphysical processes that initiate and govern the birth of massive stars remain\npoorly understood. Two widely discussed models are monolithic collapse of\nmolecular cloud cores and competitive accretion. To learn more about massive\nstar formation, we perform simulations of the collapse of rotating, massive,\ncloud cores including radiative heating by both non-ionizing and ionizing\nradiation using the FLASH adaptive mesh refinement code. These simulations show\nfragmentation from gravitational instability in the enormously dense accretion\nflows required to build up massive stars. Secondary stars form rapidly in these\nflows and accrete mass that would have otherwise been consumed by the massive\nstar in the center, in a process that we term fragmentation-induced starvation.\nThis explains why massive stars are usually found as members of high-order\nstellar systems that themselves belong to large clusters containing stars of\nall masses. The radiative heating does not prevent fragmentation, but does lead\nto a higher Jeans mass, resulting in fewer and more massive stars than would\nform without the heating. This mechanism reproduces the observed relation\nbetween the total stellar mass in the cluster and the mass of the largest star.\nIt predicts strong clumping and filamentary structure in the center of\ncollapsing cores, as has recently been observed. We speculate that a similar\nmechanism will act during primordial star formation. \n\n"}

We achieve this by utilising\nstellar tracks from the BaSTI database and implementing a different mass loss\nprescription for each SSP created, resulting in different HB morphologies. We\nfind that, for each metallicity, there is some HB morphology which maximises\nHbeta, making an underlying 14Gyr population look ~5-6Gyr old for the low and\nintermediate metallicity cases, and as young as 2Gyr for a solar metallicity\nSSP. We explore whether there are any spectral indices capable of breaking the\ndegeneracy between an old SSP with extended blue HB and a truly young or\nintermediate age SSP, and find that the CaII index of Rose(1984) and the\nstrength of the MgII doublet at 2800A are promising candidates, in combination\nwith Hbeta and other metallicity indicators such as Mgb and Fe5406. We also run\nMonte Carlo simulations to investigate the level of statistical fluctuations in\nthe spectra of typical stellar clusters. We find that fluctuations in spectral\nindices are significant even for average to large globular clusters, and that\nvarious spectral indices are affected in different ways, which has implications\nfor full-spectrum fitting methods. Hence we urge caution if these types of\nstellar clusters are to be used as empirical calibrating objects for various\naspects of SPS models. (Abridged) \n\n"}

We have detected candidates of [F II]\n4790A, [Kr III] 6826A, and [P II] 7875A lines and successfully estimated the\nabundances of these elements ([F/H]=+1.23, [Kr/H]=+0.26, [P/H]=+0.26) for the\nfirst time. We present a relation between C, F, P, and Kr abundances among PNe\nand C-rich stars. The detections of F and Kr support the idea that F and Kr\ntogether with C are synthesized in the same layer and brought to the surface by\nthe third dredge-up. We have estimated the N^2+ and O^2+ abundances using\noptical recombination lines (ORLs) and collisionally excited lines (CELs). The\ndiscrepancy between the abundance derived from the O ORL and that derived from\nthe O CEL is >1 dex. To investigate the status of the central star of the PN,\nnebula condition, and dust properties, we construct a theoretical SED model\nwith CLOUDY. By comparing the derived luminosity and temperature of the central\nstar with theoretical evolutionary tracks, we conclude that the initial mass of\nthe progenitor is likely to be ~1.5-2.0 Msun and the age is ~3000 yr after the\nAGB phase. The observed elemental abundances can be explained by a theoretical\nnucleosynthesis model with a star of initial mass 2.25 Msun, Z=0.008 and LMC\ncompositions. We have estimated the dust mass to be 2.9x10^-4 Msun (amorphous\ncarbon only) or 4.0x10^-4 Msun (amorphous carbon and PAH). Based on the\nassumption that most of the observed dust is formed during the last two thermal\npulses and the dust-to-gas mass ratio is 5.58x10^-3, the dust mass-loss rate\nand the total mass-loss rate are <3.1x10^-8 Msun / yr and <5.5x10^-6 Msun / yr,\nrespectively.

An accurate\nknowledge of the spectral resolution of these libraries is critical to avoid\npropagation errors and uncertain estimates of the intrinsic stellar velocity\ndispersion of galaxies. In this research note we re-assess the spectral\nresolution of the MILES stellar library and of the stellar population models\nbased on it. This exercise was performed, because of a recent controversy over\nthe exact MILES resolution. We perform our test through the comparison of MILES\nstellar spectra with three different sets of higher-resolution templates, one\nfully theoretical - the MARCS library - and two empirical ones, namely the\nIndo-U.S. and ELODIE v3.1 libraries. The theoretical template has a\nwell-defined very high (R=20000) resolution. Hence errors on this theoretical\nvalue do not affect our conclusions. Our approach based on the MARCS library\nwas crucial to constrain the values of the resolution also for the other two\nempirical templates. We find that the MILES resolution has previously been\nslightly overestimated. We derive a new spectral resolution of 2.54 A FWHM,\ninstead of the nominal 2.3 A. The reason for this difference is due to an\noverestimation of the resolution for the Indo-U.S. library that was previously\nused for estimates of the MILES resolution. For the Indo-U.S. we obtain a new\nvalue of 1.35 A FWHM. Most importantly, the results derived from the MARCS and\nELODIE libraries are in very good agreement. These results are important for\nusers of the MILES spectra library and for further development of stellar\npopulation models aimed to obtain accurate stellar kinematics in galaxies. \n\n"}

We use a large, cosmological, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation\nto investigate how this decline is related to the evolution of gas accretion\nand to outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that the drop\nin the star formation rate follows a corresponding decline in the global\ncold-mode accretion rate density onto haloes, but with a delay of order the gas\nconsumption time scale in the interstellar medium. Here we define cold-mode\n(hot-mode) accretion as gas that is accreted and whose temperature has never\nexceeded (did exceed) 10^5.5 K. In contrast to cold-mode accretion, which peaks\nat z~3, the hot mode continues to increase to z~1 and remains roughly constant\nthereafter. By the present time, the hot mode strongly dominates the global\naccretion rate onto haloes. Star formation does not track hot-mode halo\naccretion because most of the hot halo gas never accretes onto galaxies. AGN\nfeedback plays a crucial role by preferentially preventing gas that entered\nhaloes in the hot mode from accreting onto their central galaxies.\nConsequently, in the absence of AGN feedback, gas accreted in the hot mode\nwould become the dominant source of fuel for star formation and the drop off in\nthe cosmic star formation rate would be much less steep. \n\n"}

In this model,\nstar formation occurs in gravitationally bound protocluster clumps embedded in\nlarger giant molecular clouds with the protocluster clump mass function\nfollowing a power law function with a slope of -2. Metallicity dependent\nfeedback is generated by the winds of OB stars (M > 5 Msol) that form in the\nclumps. The quenching of star formation in clumps of decreasing metallicity\noccurs at later epochs due to weaker wind luminosities, thus resulting in\nhigher final star formation efficiencies (SFE_{exp}).

Methods. We present an\nimplementation of a map-making algorithm which allows the combined treatment of\ntemperature and polarisation data, and removal of instrumental effects, such as\ndetector time constants and finite sampling intervals, as well as the\ndeconvolution of arbitrarily complex beams from the maps.

Here we present the inner workings of a\nframework, based on machine-learning algorithms, that captures expert training\nand ground-truth knowledge about the variable and transient sky to automate 1)\nthe process of discovery on image differences and, 2) the generation of\npreliminary science-type classifications of discovered sources. Since follow-up\nresources for extracting novel science from fast-changing transients are\nprecious, self-calibrating classification probabilities must be couched in\nterms of efficiencies for discovery and purity of the samples generated. We\nestimate the purity and efficiency in identifying real sources with a two-epoch\nimage-difference discovery algorithm for the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF)\nsurvey. Once given a source discovery, using machine-learned classification\ntrained on PTF data, we distinguish between transients and variable stars with\na 3.8% overall error rate (with 1.7% errors for imaging within the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey footprint).

In particular, the Sun may have radially\nmigrated through the galactic disk by up to 5-6 kpc. This has important\nramifications for the structure of the Oort Cloud, as it means that the solar\nsystem may have experienced tidal and stellar perturbations that were\nsignificantly different from its current local galactic environment. To\ncharacterize the effects of solar migration within the Milky Way, we use direct\nnumerical simulations to model the formation of an Oort Cloud around stars that\nend up on solar-type orbits in a galactic-scale simulation of a Milky Way-like\ndisk formation. Surprisingly, our simulations indicate that Sedna's orbit may\nbelong to the classical Oort Cloud. Contrary to previous understanding, we show\nthat field star encounters play a pivotal role in setting the Oort Cloud's\nextreme inner edge, and due to their stochastic nature this inner edge\nsometimes extends to Sedna's orbit. The Sun's galactic migration heightens the\nchance of powerful stellar passages, and Sedna production occurs around ~20-30%\nof the solar-like stars we study. Considering the entire Oort Cloud, we find\nits median distance depends on the minimum galactocentric distance attained\nduring the Sun's orbital history. The inner edge also shows a similar\ndependence but with increased scatter due to the effects of powerful stellar\nencounters. Both of these Oort Cloud parameters can vary by an order of\nmagnitude and are usually overestimated by an Oort Cloud formation model that\nassumes a fixed galactic environment. In addition, the amount of material\ntrapped in outer Oort Cloud orbits can be extremely low and may present\ndifficulties for models of Oort Cloud formation and long-period comet\nproduction. \n\n"}

We show that various estimates for the\nGalactic SFR are consistent with one another once they have been normalized to\nthe same initial mass function (IMF) and massive star models, converging to 1.9\n+/- 0.4 M_sun/yr. However, standard SFR diagnostics are vulnerable to\nsystematics founded in the use of indirect observational tracers sensitive only\nto high-mass stars. We find that absolute SFRs measured using resolved\nlow/intermediate-mass stellar populations in Galactic H II regions are\nsystematically higher by factors of ~2-3 as compared with calibrations for SFRs\nmeasured from mid-IR and radio emission. We discuss some potential explanations\nfor this discrepancy and conclude that it could be allayed if (1) the power-law\nslope of the IMF for intermediate-mass (1.5 M_sun < m < 5 M_sun) stars were\nsteeper than the Salpeter slope, or (2) a correction factor was applied to the\nextragalactic 24 micron SFR calibrations to account for the duration of star\nformation in individual mid-IR-bright H II regions relative to the lifetimes of\nO stars.

We then assign\nstellar mass profile and velocity dispersion profile parameters to each system\nin the SEC using their observed correlations with M_star and sigma.\nSimultaneously, we solve for dark matter density profile of each halo using the\nspherical Jeans equation. The resulting dark matter density profiles deviate in\ngeneral from the dissipationless profile of NFW or Einasto and their mean inner\ndensity slope and concentration vary systematically with M_vir. Statistical\ntests of the distribution of profiles at fixed M_vir rule out the null\nhypothesis that it follows the distribution predicted by N-body simulations for\nM_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar. These dark matter profiles imply that dark\nmatter density is, on average, enhanced significantly in the inner region of\nhalos with M_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar supporting halo contraction. The\nmain characteristics of halo contraction are: (1) the mean dark matter density\nwithin the effective radius has increased by a factor varying systematically up\nto ~ 3-4 at M_vir = 10^{12} M_solar, and (2) the inner density slope has a mean\nof <alpha> ~ 1.3 with rho(r) ~ r^{-alpha} and a halo-to-halo rms scatter of\nrms(alpha) ~ 0.4-0.5 for 10^{12} M_solar ~< M_vir ~< 10^{13-14} M_solar steeper\nthan the NFW profile (alpha=1).

The targets may be isolated entities (e.g., dust\nparticles), but may also be 1-d or 2-d periodic arrays of \"target unit cells\",\nwhich can be used to study absorption, scattering, and electric fields around\narrays of nanostructures.\n  The DDA approximates the target by an array of polarizable points. The theory\nof the DDA and its implementation in DDSCAT is presented in Draine (1988) and\nDraine & Flatau (1994), and its extension to periodic structures in Draine &\nFlatau (2008). Efficient near-field calculations are enabled following Flatau &\nDraine (2012). DDSCAT 7.2 allows accurate calculations of electromagnetic\nscattering from targets with size parameters 2*pi*aeff/lambda < 25 provided the\nrefractive index m is not large compared to unity (|m-1| < 2). DDSCAT 7.2\nincludes support for MPI, OpenMP, and the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL).\n  DDSCAT 7.2 supports calculations for a variety of target geometries (e.g.,\nellipsoids, regular tetrahedra, rectangular solids, finite cylinders, hexagonal\nprisms, etc.).

Due to the changing luminosity of\nthe central source, light echoes propagate into the nebula. This remarkable\nphenomenon was the subject of Paper I.The origin and physical properties of the\nnebula are however uncertain: it may have been created through mass loss from\nthe star itself, or it could be the remnant of a pre-existing interstellar\ncloud. Our goal is to determine the 3D structure of the nebula, and estimate\nits mass. Knowing the geometrical shape of the nebula will also allow us to\nretrieve the distance of RS Pup in an unambiguous manner using a model of its\nlight echoes (in a forthcoming work). The scattering angle of the Cepheid light\nin the circumstellar nebula can be recovered from its degree of linear\npolarization. We thus observed the nebula surrounding RS Pup using the\npolarimetric imaging mode of the VLT/FORS instrument, and obtained a map of the\ndegree and position angle of linear polarization. From our FORS observations,\nwe derive a 3D map of the distribution of the dust, whose overall geometry is\nan irregular and thin layer. The nebula does not present a well-defined\nsymmetry. Using a simple model, we derive a total dust mass of M(dust) = 2.9\n+/- 0.9 Msun for the dust within 1.8 arcmin of the Cepheid. This translates\ninto a total mass of M(gas+dust) = 290 +/- 120 Msun, assuming a dust-to-gas\nratio of 1.0 +/- 0.3 %. The high mass of the dusty nebula excludes that it was\ncreated by mass-loss from the star. However, the thinness nebula is an\nindication that the Cepheid participated to its shaping, e.g. through its\nradiation pressure or stellar wind. RS Pup therefore appears as a regular\nlong-period Cepheid located in an exceptionally dense interstellar environment. \n\n"}

The abundances of SLRs in the gas\nof a star-forming galaxy are inversely proportional to the gas consumption\ntime. The rapid evolution of specific star formation rate (SSFR) of normal\ngalaxies implies they had mean SLR abundances ~3--10 times higher at z = 2.\nDuring the epoch of Solar system formation, the background SLR abundances of\nthe Galaxy were up to twice as high as at present, if SLR yields from massive\nstars do not depend on metallicity. If SLRs are homogenized in the gas of\ngalaxies, the high SSFRs of normal galaxies can partly explain the elevated\nabundance of SLRs like $^{60}$Fe and $^{26}$Al in the early Solar system.\nStarburst galaxies have much higher SSFRs still, and have enormous mean\nabundances of $^{26}$Al ($^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al ~ $10^{-3}$ for Solar metallicity\ngas). The main uncertainty is whether the SLRs are mixed with the star-forming\nmolecular gas: they could be trapped in hot gas and decay before entering the\ncolder phases, or be blown out by starburst winds.

We vary\nseveral initial parameters such as the initial half-mass radius of the cluster,\nthe initial binary fraction, and the degree of initial mass segregation. Two\ndifferent pairing methods are used to construct massive binaries for more\nrealistic initial conditions of massive binaries.

In the case of\nmassive clusters (>= 1000 Msun), no most-massive star escapes the cluster\nwithin 3 Myr regardless of the initial conditions if clusters have initial\nhalf-mass radii, r_0.5, >= 0.8 pc.

In this paper, we investigate variations of\nthe IMF within individual galaxies. For this purpose, we use strong lensing and\ngas kinematics to measure independently the normalisation of the IMF of the\nbulge and disk components of a sample of 5 massive spiral galaxies with\nsubstantial bulge components taken from the SWELLS survey. We find that the\nstellar mass of the bulges are tightly constrained by the lensing and kinematic\ndata.

{"id": "1209.4077", "contents": "Title: Does the dwarf galaxy system of the Milky Way originate from Andromeda? Abstract: The Local Group is often seen to be a quiescent environment without\nsignificant merger events. However an ancient major merger may have occurred in\nthe most massive galaxy. Numerical simulations have shown that tidal tails\nformed during gas-rich major mergers are long-lived and could be responsible\nfor old stellar streams and likely induce the formation of tidal dwarf galaxies\n(TDGs). Using several hydrodynamical simulations we have investigated the most\nprominent tidal tail formed during the first passage, which is gas-rich and\ncontains old and metal poor stars. We discovered several striking coincidences\nafter comparing its location and motion to those of the Milky Way (MW) and of\nthe Magellanic Clouds (MCs). First, the tidal tail is sweeping a relatively\nsmall volume in which the MW precisely lies. Because the geometry of the merger\nis somehow fixed by the anisotropic properties of the Giant Stream (GS), we\nevaluate the chance of the MW to be at such a rendez-vous with this gigantic\ntidal tail to be 5 %. Second, the velocity of the tidal tail matches the LMC\nproper motion, and reproduce quite well the geometrical and angular momentum\nproperties of the MW dwarfs, i.e. the so-called disk of satellites, better\ncalled Vast Polar Structure (VPOS). Third, the simulation of the tidal tail\nreveals one of the formed TDG with mass and location almost comparable to those\nof the LMC. Our present modeling is however too limited to study the detailed\ninteraction of gas-rich TDGs with the potential of the MW, and a complementary\nstudy is required to test whether the dwarf intrinsic properties can be\naccounted for by our scenario. Nevertheless this study suggests a causal link\nbetween an ancient, gas-rich major merger at the M31 location, and several\nenigma in the Local Group, the GS, the VPOS, and the presence of the MCs. \n\n"}

The metallicity of the gas can help distinguish\nbetween these models, and here we report on results that use 138 ks of archival\nChandra data and 92 ks of new XMM-Newton data to measure the temperature and\nmetallicity of the hot halo of the galaxy.

Various hypotheses have been proposed to overcome this problem,\nincluding the suggestion that ultra-wide binaries result from the dissolution\nof a star cluster - when a cluster star gravitationally captures another,\ndistant, cluster star. Recent observations have shown that very wide binaries\nare frequently members of triple systems and that close binaries often have a\ndistant third companion. Here we report Nbody simulations of the dynamical\nevolution of newborn triple systems still embedded in their nascent cloud cores\nthat match observations of very wide systems.

Cloud Destruction by Stellar Feedback Abstract: We present a numerical study of the evolution of molecular clouds, from their\nformation by converging flows in the warm ISM, to their destruction by the\nionizing feedback of the massive stars they form. We improve with respect to\nour previous simulations by including a different stellar-particle formation\nalgorithm, which allows them to have masses corresponding to single stars\nrather than to small clusters, and with a mass distribution following a\nnear-Salpeter stellar IMF. We also employ a simplified radiative-transfer\nalgorithm that allows the stellar particles to feed back on the medium at a\nrate that depends on their mass and the local density. Our results are as\nfollows: a) Contrary to the results from our previous study, where all stellar\nparticles injected energy at a rate corresponding to a star of ~ 10 Msun, the\ndense gas is now completely evacuated from 10-pc regions around the stars\nwithin 10-20 Myr, suggesting that this feat is accomplished essentially by the\nmost massive stars. b) At the scale of the whole numerical simulations, the\ndense gas mass is reduced by up to an order of magnitude, although star\nformation (SF) never shuts off completely, indicating that the feedback\nterminates SF locally, but new SF events continue to occur elesewhere in the\nclouds. c) The SF efficiency (SFE) is maintained globally at the ~ 10% level,\nalthough locally, the cloud with largest degree of focusing of its accretion\nflow reaches SFE ~ 30%. d) The virial parameter of the clouds approaches unity\nbefore the stellar feedback begins to dominate the dynamics, becoming much\nlarger once feedback dominates, suggesting that clouds become unbound as a\nconsequence of the stellar feedback. e) The erosion of the filaments that feed\nthe star-forming clumps produces chains of isolated dense blobs reminiscent of\nthose observed in the vicinity of the dark globule B68. \n\n"}

Focusing on the brightest high latitude\nsources, we use this comparison to derive limits on the dark matter\nannihilation cross section.

Models allow us to relate the integrated spectra (or\ncolours) of a system with the evolutionary status of the stars of which it is\ncomposed and hence to infer how the system has evolved from its formation to\nits present stage. On average, observational data follow model predictions, but\nwith some scatter, so that systems with the same physical parameters (age,\nmetallicity, total mass) produce a variety of integrated spectra. The fewer the\nstars in a system, the larger is the scatter. Such scatter is sometimes much\nlarger than the observational errors, reflecting its physical nature. This\nsituation has led to the development in recent years (especially since 2010) of\nMonte Carlo models of stellar populations. Some authors have proposed that such\nmodels are more realistic than state-of-the-art standard synthesis codes that\nproduce the mean of the distribution of Monte Carlo models.\n  In this review, I show that these two modelling strategies are actually\nequivalent, and that they are not in opposition to each other.

While lower luminosity AGN may be triggered by minor disturbances\nto the host galaxy, stronger disturbances are likely required to trigger\nluminous AGN. Major wet mergers of galaxies are ideal environments for AGN\ntriggering since they provide large gas supplies and galaxy scale torques.\nThere is however little observational evidence for a strong connection between\nAGN and major mergers. We analyse the morphological properties of AGN host\ngalaxies as a function of AGN and host galaxy luminosity and compare them to a\ncarefully matched sample of control galaxies. AGN are X-ray selected in the\nredshift range 0.5 < z < 0.8 and have luminosities 41 < log(L_X [erg/s]) <\n44.5.

We point out a degeneracy between the contributions to the\nobserved values due to extragalactic magnetic fields and observational noise\nand comment on the dangers of over-interpreting an estimate without taking into\naccount its uncertainty information. To overcome these difficulties, we develop\nan extended reconstruction algorithm based on the assumption that the\nobservational uncertainties are accurately described for a subset of the data,\nwhich can overcome the degeneracy with the extragalactic contributions. We\npresent a probabilistic derivation of the algorithm and demonstrate its\nperformance using a simulation, yielding a high quality reconstruction of the\nGalactic Faraday rotation foreground, a precise estimate of the typical\nextragalactic contribution, and a well-defined probabilistic description of the\nextragalactic contribution for each data point. We then apply this\nreconstruction technique to a catalog of Faraday rotation observations. We vary\nour assumptions about the data, showing that the dispersion of extragalactic\ncontributions to observed Faraday depths is most likely lower than 7 rad/m^2,\nin agreement with earlier results, and that the extragalactic contribution to\nan individual data point is poorly constrained by the data in most cases. \n\n"}

In contrast, MOND provides a unique and\npredictively successful description of galaxy dynamics, but is mute on the\nsubject of cosmology. Here I briefly review these contradictory world views,\nemphasizing the wealth of distinct, interlocking lines of evidence that went\ninto the development of LCDM while highlighting the practical impossibility\nthat it can provide a satisfactory explanation of the observed MOND\nphenomenology in galaxy dynamics. I also briefly review the baryon budget in\ngroups and clusters of galaxies where neither paradigm provides an entirely\nsatisfactory description of the data. Relatively little effort has been devoted\nto the formation of structure in MOND; I review some of what has been done. The\namplitude ratio of the first to second peak in the CMB power spectrum was\ncorrectly predicted a priori, but the third peak is more natural to LCDM. MOND\nanticipates that structure forms more quickly than in LCDM. This motivated the\nprediction that reionization would happen earlier in MOND than originally\nexpected in LCDM, as subsequently observed. This also provides a natural\nexplanation for massive, early clusters of galaxies and large, empty voids.\nHowever, it is far from obvious that the mass spectrum of galaxy clusters or\nthe power spectrum of galaxies can be explained in MOND, two things that LCDM\ndoes well. Critical outstanding issues are the development of an acceptable\nrelativistic parent theory for MOND, and the reality of the non-baryonic dark\nmatter of LCDM.

Abstract: The formation of very young massive clusters or \"starburst\" clusters is\ncurrently one of the most widely debated topic in astronomy. The classical\nnotion dictates that a star cluster is formed in-situ in a dense molecular gas\nclump followed by a substantial residual gas expulsion. On the other hand,\nbased on the observed morphologies of many young stellar associations, a\nhierarchical formation scenario is alternatively suggested. A very young (age\n$\\approx$ 1 Myr), massive ($>10^4M_\\odot$) star cluster like the Galactic NGC\n3603 young cluster (HD 97950) is an appropriate testbed for distinguishing\nbetween such \"monolithic\" and \"hierarchical\" formation scenarios. A recent\nstudy by Banerjee and Kroupa (2014) demonstrates that the monolithic scenario\nremarkably reproduces the HD 97950 cluster. In the present work, we explore the\npossibility of the formation of the above cluster via hierarchical assembly of\nsubclusters. These subclusters are initially distributed over a wide range of\nspatial volumes and have various modes of sub-clustering. Unlike the monolithic\nmodel that reproduces HD 97950 very well, the same is found to be prohibitive\nwith hierarchical assembly alone. Only those systems which assemble promptly\ninto a single cluster (in $\\lesssim1$ Myr) from a close separation (all within\n$\\lesssim2$ pc) could match the observed density profile of HD 97950 after\n$\\approx70$% gas dispersal. These results therefore suggest that NGC 3603 young\ncluster has formed essentially monolithically, i.e., either in-situ or via a\nprompt assembly, followed by a substantial residual gas expulsion. Both\nscenarios are consistent with the inferred young age and the small age spread\nof this cluster. Future observations of molecular cloud filaments with ALMA and\nproper motion measurements of young clusters with Gaia will provide more direct\ntests of such birth environments. [Abridged] \n\n"}

These capture advantages of both smoothed-particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) and adaptive mesh-refinement (AMR) schemes. Here, we extend\nthese to include ideal magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD). The MHD equations are\nsecond-order consistent and conservative. We augment these with a\ndivergence-cleaning scheme, which maintains div*B~0 to high accuracy. We\nimplement these in the code GIZMO, together with a state-of-the-art\nimplementation of SPH MHD. In every one of a large suite of test problems, the\nnew methods are competitive with moving-mesh and AMR schemes using constrained\ntransport (CT) to ensure div*B=0. They are able to correctly capture the growth\nand structure of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), MHD turbulence, and\nthe launching of magnetic jets, in some cases converging more rapidly than AMR\ncodes. Compared to SPH, the MFM/MFV methods exhibit proper convergence at fixed\nneighbor number, sharper shock capturing, and dramatically reduced noise, div*B\nerrors, and diffusion. Still, 'modern' SPH is able to handle most of our tests,\nat the cost of much larger kernels and 'by hand' adjustment of artificial\ndiffusion parameters.

As a result they converge more slowly on\nsome problems (involving smooth, slowly-moving flows) but more rapidly on\nothers (involving advection or rotation).

Average divergence error\nis an order of magnitude lower for all test cases considered, and allows for\nthe stable simulation of the gravitational collapse of magnetised molecular\ncloud cores. The effectiveness of the cleaning may be improved by explicitly\nincreasing the hyperbolic wave speed or by cycling the cleaning equations\nbetween timesteps. In the latter, it is possible to achieve DivB=0. Chapter 4\ndevelops a switch to reduce dissipation of the magnetic field from artificial\nresistivity. Compared to the existing switch in the literature, this leads to\nsharper shock profiles in shocktube tests, lower overall dissipation of\nmagnetic energy, and importantly, is able to capture magnetic shocks in the\nhighly super-Alfvenic regime. Chapter 5 compares these numerical methods\nagainst grid-based MHD methods (using the Flash code) in simulations of the\nsmall-scale dynamo amplification of a magnetic field in driven, isothermal,\nsupersonic turbulence.

Such\nsimulations resemble observations of filaments and fibres in nearby molecular\nclouds. The sub-filaments are dynamical features formed at the stagnation\npoints of the turbulent velocity field where shocks dissipate the turbulent\nenergy. They are a ubiquitous feature of the simulated clouds, which appear\nfrom the beginning of the simulation and are not formed by gradual\nfragmentation of larger filaments. Most of the sub-filaments are\ngravitationally sub-critical and do not fragment into cores, however, there is\nalso a significant fraction of supercritical sub-filaments which break up into\nstar-forming cores. The sub-filaments are coherent along their length, and the\nresidual velocities along their spine show that they are subsonically\ncontracting without any ordered rotation on scales of ~0.1 pc. Accretion flows\nalong the sub-filaments can feed material into star forming cores embedded\nwithin the network.

Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods.

Abstract: The classic question that how young massive star clusters attain their shapes\nand sizes, as we find them today, remains to be a challenge. Both observational\nand computational studies of star-forming massive molecular gas clouds infer\nthat massive cluster formation is primarily triggered along the small-scale\n($\\lesssim0.3$ pc) filamentary substructures within the clouds. The present\nstudy is intended to investigate the possible ways in which a\nfilament-like-compact, massive star cluster (effective radius 0.1-0.3 pc) can\nexpand $\\gtrsim10$ times, still remaining massive enough ($\\gtrsim10^4\nM_\\odot$), to become a young massive star cluster, as we observe today. To that\nend, model massive clusters (of initially $10^4 M_\\odot-10^5 M_\\odot$) are\nevolved using Sverre Aarseth's state-of-the-art N-body code NBODY7. All the\ncomputed clusters expand with time, whose sizes (effective radii) are compared\nwith those observed for young massive clusters, of age $\\lesssim100$ Myr, in\nthe Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. It is found that beginning from the\nabove compact sizes, a star cluster cannot expand by its own, i.e., due to\ntwo-body relaxation, stellar-evolutionary mass loss, dynamical heating by\nprimordial binaries and stellar-mass black holes, up to the observed sizes of\nyoung massive clusters; they always remain much more compact compared to the\nobserved ones. This calls for additional mechanisms that can boost the\nexpansion of a massive cluster after its assembly. Using further N-body\ncalculations, it is shown that a substantial residual gas expulsion, with\n$\\approx30$% star formation efficiency, can indeed swell the newborn embedded\ncluster adequately. The limitations of the present calculations and their\nconsequences are discussed. \n\n"}

We consider the case of surveys for high-redshift\nLyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs), which have traditionally been classified\nvia an inferred rest-frame equivalent width (EW) greater than 20 angstrom. Our\nBayesian method relies on known prior probabilities in measured emission-line\nluminosity functions and equivalent width distributions for the galaxy\npopulations, and returns the probability that an object in question is an LAE\ngiven the characteristics observed. This approach will be directly relevant for\nthe Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), which seeks to\nclassify ~10^6 emission-line galaxies into LAEs and low-redshift [O II]\nemitters. For a simulated HETDEX catalog with realistic measurement noise, our\nBayesian method recovers 86% of LAEs missed by the traditional EW > 20 angstrom\ncutoff over 2 < z < 3, outperforming the EW cut in both contamination and\nincompleteness. This is due to the method's ability to trade off between the\ntwo types of binary classification error by adjusting the stringency of the\nprobability requirement for classifying an observed object as an LAE. In our\nsimulations of HETDEX, this method reduces the uncertainty in cosmological\ndistance measurements by 14% with respect to the EW cut, equivalent to\nrecovering 29% more cosmological information. Rather than using binary object\nlabels, this method enables the use of classification probabilities in\nlarge-scale structure analyses. It can be applied to narrowband emission-line\nsurveys as well as upcoming large spectroscopic surveys including Euclid and\nWFIRST. \n\n"}

The\nclustering strength of quiescent galaxies exceeds that of star-forming\ngalaxies, implying that quiescent galaxies are preferentially located in more\nmassive halos. When using local density measurement, we find a clear positive\nquiescent fraction--density relation at $z < 1$, consistent with earlier\nresults. However, the quiescent fraction--density relation reverses its trend\nat intermediate redshifts ($1 < z < 1.5$) with marginal significance\n(<1.8$\\sigma$) and is found to be scale dependent (1.6$\\sigma$). The lower\nfraction of quiescent galaxies seen in large-scale dense environments, if\nconfirmed to be true, may be associated with the fact that the star formation\ncan be more easily sustained via cold stream accretion in `large-scale'\nhigh-density regions, preventing galaxies from permanent quenching. Finally, at\n$z > 1.5$, the quiescent fraction depends little on the local density, even\nthough clustering shows that quiescent galaxies are in more massive halos. We\nargue that at high redshift the typical halo size falls below $10^{13}$\n$M_{\\odot}$, where intrinsically the local density measurements are so varied\nthat they do not trace the halo mass.

Linguistic and neurocognitive studies recognize the phonological\nclasses at segmental level as the essential and invariant representations used\nin speech temporal organization. In the context of speech processing, a deep\nneural network (DNN) is an effective computational method to infer the\nprobability of individual phonological classes from a short segment of speech\nsignal. A vector of all phonological class probabilities is referred to as\nphonological posterior. There are only very few classes comprising a short term\nspeech signal; hence, the phonological posterior is a sparse vector. Although\nthe phonological posteriors are estimated at segmental level, we claim that\nthey convey supra-segmental information. Specifically, we demonstrate that\nphonological posteriors are indicative of syllabic and prosodic events.\nBuilding on findings from converging linguistic evidence on the gestural model\nof Articulatory Phonology as well as the neural basis of speech perception, we\nhypothesize that phonological posteriors convey properties of linguistic\nclasses at multiple time scales, and this information is embedded in their\nsupport (index) of active coefficients.

If NSBM are indeed solely responsible for the solar system r-\nprocess abundances, a galaxy like our own would require to host a few NSBM per\nmillion years, with each event ejecting, on average, about 5x10^{-2} M_sun of\nr-process material. Because the ejecta velocities in the tidal tail are\nsignificantly larger than in ordinary supernovae, NSBM deposit a comparable\namount of energy into the interstellar medium (ISM). In contrast to extensive\nefforts studying spherical models for supernova remnant evolution, calculations\nquantifying the impact of NSBM ejecta in the ISM have been lacking.

Using the\n15,746 TDSS-selected single-epoch spectra of photometrically variable objects\nin SEQUELS, we determine the demographics of our variability-selected sample,\nand investigate the unique spectral characteristics inherent in samples\nselected by variability. We show that variability-based selection of quasars\ncomplements color-based selection by selecting additional redder quasars, and\nmitigates redshift biases to produce a smooth quasar redshift distribution over\na wide range of redshifts. The resulting quasar sample contains systematically\nhigher fractions of blazars and broad absorption line quasars than from\ncolor-selected samples.

We study the origin of such outliers in a Lambda cold dark matter\ncontext using the EAGLE cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation. We find 15\n'M_BH(M_star)-outlier' galaxies, defined as having M_BH more than 1.5 dex above\nthe median M_BH(M_star) relation in the simulation, M_{BH,med}. All\nM_BH(M_star)-outliers are satellite galaxies, typically with M_star ~ 10^10\nM_sun and M_BH ~ 10^8 M_sun. They have all become outliers due to a combination\nof tidal stripping of their outer stellar component acting over several Gyr and\nearly formation times leading to rapid BH growth at high redshift, with the\nformer mechanism being most important for 67 per cent of these outliers. The\nsame mechanisms also cause the M_BH(M_star)-outlier satellites to be amongst\nthe most compact galaxies in the simulation, making them ideal candidates for\nultracompact dwarf galaxy progenitors.

Abstract: The confirmation of a globular cluster (GC) in the recently discovered\nultrafaint galaxy Eridanus II (Eri II) motivated us to examine the question\nposed in the title. After estimating the halo mass of Eri II using a published\nstellar mass - halo mass relation, the one GC in this galaxy supports extending\nthe relationship between the number of GCs hosted by a galaxy and the galaxy's\ntotal mass about two orders of magnitude in stellar mass below the previous\nlimit. For this empirically determined specific frequency of between 0.06 and\n0.39 globular clusters per 10$^9$ $M_\\odot$ of total mass, the surviving Milky\nWay (MW) subhalos with masses smaller than $10^{10} M_\\odot$ could host as many\nas 5 to 31 GCs, broadly consistent with the actual population of outer halo MW\nGCs, although matching the radial distribution in detail remains a challenge.\nUsing a subhalo mass function from published high resolution numerical\nsimulations and a Poissonian model for populating those halos with the\naforementioned empirically constrained frequency, we find that about 90$\\%$ of\nthese GCs lie in lower-mass subhalos than that of Eri II. From what we know\nabout the stellar mass-halo mass function, the subhalo mass function, and the\nmass-normalized GC specific frequency, we conclude that some of the MW's outer\nhalo GCs are likely to be hosted by undetected subhalos with extremely modest\nstellar populations. \n\n"}

In this paper, two approaches for incorporating external\nmetallicity information into color-magnitude diagram fitting techniques are\npresented. Overall, the joint fitting of metallicity and CMD information can\nincrease the precision on measured age-metallicity relationships and star\nformation rates by ~10% over CMD fitting alone. However, systematics in stellar\nisochrones and mismatches between spectroscopic and photometric metallicity\ndeterminations can reduce the accuracy of the recovered SFHs.

There are many ways to estimate or\nlearn the high-level coarse tokens, but we argue that a simple extraction\nprocedure is sufficient to capture a wealth of high-level discourse semantics.\nSuch procedure allows training the multiresolution recurrent neural network by\nmaximizing the exact joint log-likelihood over both sequences.

The method involves probabilistic cataloging, where samples are\ntaken from the posterior probability distribution of catalogs consistent with\nan observed photon count map. In order to validate our method we sample random\ncatalogs of the gamma-ray sky in the direction of the North Galactic Pole (NGP)\nby binning the data in energy and Point Spread Function (PSF) classes. Using\nthree energy bins spanning $0.3 - 1$, $1 - 3$ and $3 - 10$ GeV, we identify\n$270\\substack{+30 \\\\ -10}$ point sources inside a $40^\\circ \\times 40^\\circ$\nregion around the NGP above our point-source inclusion limit of $3 \\times\n10^{-11}$/cm$^2$/s/sr/GeV at the $1-3$ GeV energy bin. Modeling the flux\ndistribution as a power law, we infer the slope to be $-1.92\\substack{+0.07 \\\\\n-0.05}$ and estimate the contribution of point sources to the total emission as\n$18\\substack{+2 \\\\ -2}$\\%. These uncertainties in the flux distribution are\nfully marginalized over the number as well as the spatial and spectral\nproperties of the unresolved point sources. This marginalization allows a\nrobust test of whether the apparently isotropic emission in an image is due to\nunresolved point sources or of truly diffuse origin. \n\n"}

DR13 makes\npublicly available 1390 spatially resolved integral field unit observations of\nnearby galaxies from MaNGA, the first data released from this survey. It\nincludes new observations from eBOSS, completing SEQUELS. In addition to\ntargeting galaxies and quasars, SEQUELS also targeted variability-selected\nobjects from TDSS and X-ray selected objects from SPIDERS. DR13 includes new\nreductions of the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric\ncalibration and redshift classification. DR13 releases new reductions of the\nAPOGEE-1 data from SDSS-III, with abundances of elements not previously\nincluded and improved stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars.

Suitable sources must contain significant\ncorrelated flux density (50-100mJy) at frequencies around 110--190~MHz on\nscales of a few hundred mas. At least for the 200--300-km international\nbaselines, we find around 1 suitable calibrator source per square degree over a\nlarge part of the northern sky, in agreement with previous work. This should\nallow a randomly selected target to be successfully phase calibrated on the\ninternational baselines in over 50% of cases. Products of the survey include\ncalibrator source lists and fringe-rate and delay maps of wide areas --\ntypically a few degrees -- around each source. The density of sources with\nsignificant correlated flux declines noticeably with baseline length over the\nrange 200--600~km, with good calibrators on the longest baselines appearing\nonly at the rate of 0.5 per square degree. Coherence times decrease from 1--3\nminutes on 200-km baselines to about 1 minute on 600-km baselines, suggesting\nthat ionospheric phase variations contain components with scales of a few\nhundred kilometres.

Core creation is\nregarded as one of the most promising solutions to potential issues faced by\nthe lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmology on small scales. For example,\nthe reduced dynamical mass enclosed by cores can explain the low rotational\nvelocities measured for nearby dwarf galaxies, thus possibly lifting the\nseeming contradiction with the LambdaCDM expectations (the so-called \"too big\nto fail\" problem). Here we test core creation as a solution of cosmological\nissues by using a sample of dwarfs with measurements of their atomic hydrogen\n(HI) kinematics extending to large radii. Using the NIHAO hydrodynamical\nsimulation as an example, we show that core creation can successfully reproduce\nthe kinematics of dwarfs with small kinematic radii, R <~ 1.5 kpc. However, the\nagreement with observations becomes poor once galaxies with kinematic\nmeasurements extending beyond the core region, R ~ 1.5 - 4 kpc, are considered.\nThis result illustrates the importance of testing the predictions of\nhydrodynamical simulations that are relevant for cosmology against a broad\nrange of observational samples. We would like to stress that our result is\nvalid only under the following set of assumptions: i) that our sample of dwarfs\nwith HI kinematics is representative of the overall population of field dwarfs,\nii) that there are no severe measurement biases in the observational parameters\nof our HI dwarfs (e.g., related to inclination estimates), and iii) that the HI\nvelocity fields of dwarfs are regular enough to allow the recovery of the true\nenclosed dynamical mass. \n\n"}

The radially\ncooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and\npeanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a\nvertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,\nvelocity dispersion that dominates this evolution. Assuming that early stellar\ndiscs heat rapidly as they form, then both the in-plane and vertical random\nmotions correlate with stellar age and chemistry, leading to different density\ndistributions for metal-rich and metal-poor stars.

Low-mass galaxies generate\noutflows faster than their escape velocities with mass outflow rates up to\ntwenty times larger than their star formation rates. These outflows from\nlow-mass galaxies also have momenta larger than provided from supernovae alone,\nindicating that multiple momentum sources drive these outflows. Only 1-20\\% of\nthe supernovae energy is converted into kinetic energy, and this fraction\ndecreases with increasing stellar mass such that low-mass galaxies drive more\nefficient outflows.

The new\nspectral window probed by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) allows us to\nreconstruct the radio continuum emission from 150 MHz to 1.4 GHz to an\nunprecedented depth for a radio-selected sample of $1542$ galaxies in $\\sim 7~\n\\rm{deg}^2$ of the LOFAR Bo\\\"otes field. Using the extensive multi-wavelength\ndataset available in Bo\\\"otes and detailed modelling of the FIR to UV spectral\nenergy distribution (SED), we are able to separate the star-formation (N=758)\nand the AGN (N=784) dominated populations. We study the shape of the radio SEDs\nand their evolution across cosmic time and find significant differences in the\nspectral curvature between the SF galaxy and AGN populations. While the radio\nspectra of SF galaxies exhibit a weak but statistically significant flattening,\nAGN SEDs show a clear trend to become steeper towards lower frequencies. No\nevolution of the spectral curvature as a function of redshift is found for SF\ngalaxies or AGN. We investigate the redshift evolution of the infrared-radio\ncorrelation (IRC) for SF galaxies and find that the ratio of total infrared to\n1.4 GHz radio luminosities decreases with increasing redshift: $ q_{\\rm 1.4GHz}\n= (2.45 \\pm 0.04) \\times (1+z)^{-0.15 \\pm 0.03} $.

In\norder to apply an empirical completeness correction, existing works limit the\nsurvey depth to the shallower parts of the sky that hamper the maximum\npotential of a survey.

The competitive\naccretion theory of massive star formation posits that the most massive stars\nshould sit in deeper potential wells than lower-mass stars. This may be\nobservable in the relative surface density or spatial concentration of the most\nmassive stars compared to other, lower-mass stars. Massive stars in\ncool--collapse N-body models do end up in significantly deeper potentials, and\nare mass segregated. However, in models of warm (expanding) star-forming\nregions, whilst the massive stars do come to be in deeper potentials than\naverage stars, they are not mass segregated. In the purely hydrodynamical SPH\nsimulations, the massive stars do come to reside in deeper potentials, which is\ndue to their runaway growth. However, when photoionisation and stellar winds\nare implemented in the simulations, these feedback mechanisms regulate the mass\nof the stars and disrupt the inflow of gas into the clouds' potential wells.\nThis generally makes the potential wells shallower than in the control runs,\nand prevents the massive stars from occupying deeper potentials. This in turn\nresults in the most massive stars having a very similar spatial concentration\nand surface density distribution to lower-mass stars. Whilst massive stars do\nform via competitive accretion in our simulations, this rarely translates to a\ndifferent spatial distribution and so any lack of primordial mass segregation\nin an observed star-forming region does not preclude competitive accretion as a\nviable formation mechanism for massive stars. \n\n"}

However, how AGN jets heat and suppress cooling flows\nremains highly debated. Using an idealized simulation of a cool-core cluster,\nwe study the development of central cooling catastrophe and how a subsequent\npowerful AGN jet event averts cooling flows, with a focus on complex\ngasdynamical processes involved. We find that the jet drives a bow shock, which\nreverses cooling inflows and overheats inner cool core regions. The shocked gas\nmoves outward in a rarefaction wave, which rarefies the dense core and\nadiabatically transports a significant fraction of heated energy to outer\nregions. As the rarefaction wave propagates away, inflows resume in the cluster\ncore, but a trailing outflow is uplifted by the AGN bubble, preventing gas\naccumulation and catastrophic cooling in central regions. Inflows and trailing\noutflows constitute meridional circulations in the cluster core. At later\ntimes, trailing outflows fall back to the cluster centre, triggering central\ncooling catastrophe and potentially a new generation of AGN feedback. We thus\nenvisage a picture of cool cluster cores going through cycles of\ncooling-induced contraction and AGN-induced expansion. This picture naturally\npredicts an anti-correlation between the gas fraction (or X-ray luminosity) of\ncool cores and the central gas entropy, which may be tested by X-ray\nobservations. \n\n"}

For inside-out\ngrowing discs, today's thick-disc stars at R_0 are dominated by outwards\nmigrators. Whether outwards migrators are vertically hotter than non-migrators\ndepends on the radial gradient of the thick disc vertical velocity dispersion.\nThere is an effective upper boundary in angular momentum that thick disc stars\nborn in the centre of a galaxy can reach by migration, which explains the\nfading of the high-alpha sequence outside R_0.

A clue to the explosion\nmechanism may lie in the fact that all supernovae that accompany long-duration\ngamma-ray bursts belong to the SN Ic-BL class.

To address this limitation, we propose a\ntarget-side-attentive residual recurrent network for decoding, where attention\nover previous words contributes directly to the prediction of the next word.\nThe residual learning facilitates the flow of information from the distant past\nand is able to emphasize any of the previously translated words, hence it gains\naccess to a wider context. The proposed model outperforms a neural MT baseline\nas well as a memory and self-attention network on three language pairs. The\nanalysis of the attention learned by the decoder confirms that it emphasizes a\nwider context, and that it captures syntactic-like structures. \n\n"}

This may imply that\nmore massive stars produce other types of supernovae or they simply collapse to\nblack holes without giving rise to bright supernovae. This failed supernova\nhypothesis can lead to significantly inefficient oxygen production because\noxygen abundantly produced in inner layers of massive stars with zero-age main\nsequence masses around $20$-$30\\ M_\\odot$ might not be ejected into the\nsurrounding interstellar space. We first assume an unspecified population of\noxygen injection events related to massive stars and obtain a model-independent\nconstraint on how much oxygen should be released in a single event and how\nfrequently such events should happen.

Secondly, we investigate how the Mutual Information\nbased Transductive Feature Selection (MINT) algorithm can be used to perform\nfeature pre-selection. If one would like to provide only a small number of\ninput features to a machine learning classification algorithm, feature\npre-selection provides a method to determine which of the many possible input\nproperties should be selected. Third is the use of the tree-interpreter package\nto enable popular decision tree based ensemble methods to be opened,\nvisualized, and understood. This is done by additional analysis of the tree\nbased model, determining not only which features are important to the model,\nbut how important a feature is for a particular classification given its value.\nLastly, we use decision boundaries from the model to revise an already existing\nmethod of classification, essentially asking the tree based method where\ndecision boundaries are best placed and defining a new classification method.\n  We showcase these techniques by applying them to the problem of star-galaxy\nseparation using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (hereafter SDSS).

Smooth elliptical mass profiles were previously shown to be\ninadequate in reproducing the quad population. In this paper, we explore the\ndeviations from such smooth elliptical mass distributions. Unlike most other\nwork, we use a model-free approach based on the relative polar image angles of\nquads, and their position in 3D space with respect to the Fundamental Surface\nof Quads. The FSQ is defined by quads produced by elliptical lenses. We have\ngenerated thousands of quads from synthetic populations of lenses with\nsubstructure consistent with $\\Lambda$CDM simulations, and found that such\nperturbations are not sufficient to match the observed distribution of quads\nrelative to the FSQ. The result is unchanged even when subhalo masses are\nincreased by a factor of ten, and the most optimistic lensing selection bias is\napplied. We then produce quads from galaxies created using two components,\nrepresenting baryons and dark matter. The transition from the mass being\ndominated by baryons in inner radii to being dominated by dark matter in outer\nradii can carry with it asymmetries, which would affect relative image angles.\nWe run preliminary experiments using lenses with two elliptical mass components\nwith nonidentical axis ratios and position angles, perturbations from\nellipticity in the form of nonzero Fourier coefficients $a_4$ and $a_6$, and\nartificially offset ellipse centers as a proxy for asymmetry at image radii.

Despite this, slang\nhas been traditionally viewed as a form of non-standard language -- a form of\nlanguage that is not the focus of linguistic analysis and has largely been\nneglected. In this work, we use UrbanDictionary to conduct the first\nlarge-scale linguistic analysis of slang and its social aspects on the Internet\nto yield insights into this variety of language that is increasingly used all\nover the world online.\n  We begin by computationally analyzing the phonological, morphological and\nsyntactic properties of slang.

Consequently\nnon-negligible degradation of azimuthal spatial resolution is caused due to\nthis IBF. Meanwhile, it is necessary to collect primary ionized electrons to\nmaintain intrinsic performance of the MPGDs. The MPGD based TPC is currently\nplanned to be used as a central tracking detector of the International Large\nDetector (ILD), which is one of the detector concepts for the future\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC) project, and which requires fine azimuthal\nspatial resolution of less than 100 ${\\rm \\mu m}$ over the drift length of the\nTPC to attain high momentum resolution. Because of a unique beam structure of\nthe ILC, the IBF is a critical issue for the realization of the ILD-TPC.

We present a new family\nof biorthogonal potential-density pairs constructed using the Hankel transform\nof the Laguerre polynomials. The lowest-order density basis functions are\ndouble-power-law profiles cusped like $\\rho \\sim r^{-2 + 1/\\alpha}$ at small\nradii with asymptotic density fall-off like $\\rho \\sim r^{-3 -1/(2\\alpha)}$.\nHere, $\\alpha$ is a parameter satisfying $\\alpha \\ge 1/2$. The family therefore\nspans the range of inner density cusps found in numerical simulations, but has\nmuch shallower -- and hence more realistic -- outer slopes than the\ncorresponding members of the only previously-known family deduced by Zhao\n(1996) and exemplified by Hernquist & Ostriker (1992). When $\\alpha =1$, the\nlowest-order density profile has an inner density cusp of $\\rho \\sim r^{-1}$\nand an outer density slope of $\\rho \\sim r^{-3.5}$, similar to the famous\nNavarro, Frenk & White (1997) model. For this reason, we demonstrate that our\nnew expansion provides a more accurate representation of flattened NFW haloes\nthan the competing Hernquist-Ostriker expansion. We utilize our new expansion\nby analysing a suite of numerically-constructed haloes and providing the\ndistributions of the expansion coefficients. \n\n"}

This\nclassification is based on the specific star formation rate measured within a\nprojected distance of 1kpc from each SN location (LsSFR). This is an important\nrefinement compared to using the local star formation rate directly as it\nprovides a normalization for relative numbers of available SN progenitors and\nis more robust against extinction by dust. We find that the SNeIa in\npredominantly younger environments are DY=0.163\\pm0.029 mag (5.7 sigma) fainter\nthan those in predominantly older environments after conventional light-curve\nstandardization. This is the strongest standardized SN Ia brightness systematic\nconnected to host-galaxy environment measured to date. The well-established\nstep in standardized brightnesses between SNeIa in hosts with lower or higher\ntotal stellar masses is smaller at DM=0.119\\pm0.032 mag (4.5 sigma), for the\nsame set of SNeIa.

Thus,\napproximately 70% of the variance from the stellar mass step is due to an\nunderlying dependence on environment-based progenitor age. Standardization\nusing only the SNeIa in younger environments reduces the total dispersion from\n0.142\\pm0.008 mag to 0.120\\pm0.010 mag.

In contrast, we propose the\nuse of translated sentences as context that is always available regardless of\nthe domain.

We present an alternative\nexplanation, based on unveiled AGN activity, to the existence of such galaxies.\nIn fact, the presence of a weak AGN configures as a natural scenario in order\nto explain the observed spectral properties of such high-$z$ objects in terms\nof a continuum slope distribution rather than altered infrared excesses, due to\nthe different shape of the AGN continuum emission with respect to quiescent\ngalaxies. To this aim, we directly compare the infrared-to-ultraviolet\nproperties of high-redshift galaxies to those of known categories of AGN\n(quasars and Seyferts).

This finding\nalone suggests that comparisons between samples of NLSy1s and rest of\nbroad-line AGNs are most likely biased. NLSy1s can be properly contextualized\nby their location on the quasar main sequence originally defined by Sulentic et\nal 2000. At one end, NLSy1s encompass sources with strong FeII emission and\nassociated with high Eddington ratio that hold the promise of becoming useful\ndistance indicators; at the other end, at least some of them are sources with\nbroad profiles seen face-on. Any rigid FWHM limit gives rise to some physical\nambiguity, as the FWHM of low-ionization lines depends in a complex way on\nmass, Eddington ratio, orientation, and luminosity. In addition, if the scaling\nderived from luminosity and virial dynamics applies to the broad line regions,\nNLSy1s at luminosity higher than 1E47 erg/s become physically impossible.\nTherefore, in a broader context, a proper subdivision of two distinct classes\nof AGNs and quasars may be achieved by the distinction between Pop.

In a\nminihalo (MH) with mass $1.77\\times 10^{6} \\ {\\rm M}_{\\bigodot}$, a Pop III\nstar with mass $13 \\ {\\rm M}_{\\bigodot}$ forms at redshift $z=12.1$. After its\nSN explosion, the shocked gas falls back into the central MH internally\nenriching itself. The metallicity in the recollapsing region is $2.6\\times\n10^{-4} \\ {\\rm Z}_{\\bigodot}$ (${\\rm [Fe/H]} = -3.42$). The recollapsing cloud\nundergoes cooling by HD, CO, and OH molecules and heating along with H$_2$\nformation. Eventually by grain growth and dust cooling, knotty filaments appear\nin the central 100 au region with the help of turbulence driven by the SN,\nleading to the formation of low-mass EMP stars surviving until the present day. \n\n"}

The Pal 5 stream is one such system for which we have some of the\nbest data. However, Pal 5 orbits close to the center of the Milky Way and has\npassed through the Galactic disk many times, where its structure can be\nperturbed by baryonic structures such as the Galactic bar and giant molecular\nclouds (GMCs). In order to understand how these baryonic structures affect Pal\n5's density, we present a detailed study of the effects of the Galactic bar,\nspiral structure, GMCs, and globular clusters on the Pal 5 stream. We estimate\nthe effect of each perturber on the stream density by computing its power\nspectrum and comparing it to the power induced by a CDM-like population of dark\nmatter subhalos. We find that the bar and GMCs can each individually create\npower that is comparable to the observed power on large scales, leaving little\nroom for dark matter substructure, while spirals are subdominant on all scales.\nOn degree scales, the power induced by the bar is small, but GMCs create\nsmall-scale density variations that are similar in amplitude to the dark-matter\ninduced variations but otherwise indistinguishable from it. These results\ndemonstrate that Pal 5 is a poor system for constraining the dark matter\nsubstructure fraction and that observing streams further out in the halo will\nbe necessary to confidently detect dark matter subhalos. \n\n"}

We show that\nthe differentiation of blue star-forming and red quiescent galaxies using\nmorphological diagnostics can be achieved with similar efficacy to the use of\nkinematical diagnostics, but only if one is able to measure both the flattening\nand the triaxiality of the galaxy. Flattened oblate galaxies exhibit greater\nrotational support than their spheroidal counterparts, but there is significant\nscatter in the relationship between morphological and kinematical diagnostics,\nsuch that kinematically-similar galaxies can exhibit a broad range of\nmorphologies. The scatter in the relationship between the flattening and the\nratio of the rotation and dispersion velocities ($v/\\sigma$) correlates\nstrongly with the anisotropy of the stellar velocity dispersion: at fixed\n$v/\\sigma$, flatter galaxies exhibit greater dispersion in the plane defined by\nthe intermediate and major axes than along the minor axis, indicating that the\nmorphology of simulated galaxies is influenced significantly by the structure\nof their velocity dispersion. The simulations reveal that this anisotropy\ncorrelates with the intrinsic morphology of the galaxy's inner dark matter\nhalo, i.e. the halo's morphology that emerges in the absence of dissipative\nbaryonic physics. This implies the existence of a causal relationship between\nthe morphologies of galaxies and that of their host dark matter haloes. \n\n"}

Using SAMI morphological\nclassifications and Sersic indices, the misalignment fraction is 45+/-6% in\nearly-type galaxies, but only 5+/-1% in late-type galaxies. The distribution of\nposition angle offsets is used to test the physical drivers of this difference.\nSlower dynamical settling time of the gas in elliptical stellar mass\ndistributions accounts for a small increase in misalignment in early-type\ngalaxies.

GRAVITY reveals elongated\nexponential-like spatial profiles for the optical jets, suggestive of a heating\nmechanism acting throughout a long portion of the jet and naturally explained\nby photoionization by the collimated radiation. We also spatially resolve the\nmovement of the optical bullets for the first time, detecting extended jet\ncomponents corresponding to previous ejections. \\texttt{Cloudy} photoionization\nmodels explain both the spatial intensity profiles measured with GRAVITY and\nthe line ratios from XSHOOTER, and constrain the properties of the optical\nbullets and the ionizing radiation.

For\neach galaxy we derive, using CIGALE and the SED+LIR fitting technique, the\nslope of the dust attenuation curve and the strength of the UV bump, plus many\nother galaxy parameters. We find that the IRX-beta scatter is driven entirely\nby a wide range of attenuation curves - primarily their slopes. Once the slope\nand the UV bump are fixed, the scatter in the IRX-beta vanishes. The question\nof the IRX-beta scatter is the direct manifestation of a more fundamental\nquestion of the diversity of dust attenuation curves. The predominant role of\nthe attenuation curve is the consequence of a narrow range of intrinsic UV\nslopes of star-forming galaxies. Galaxies with different specific SFRs or\npopulation ages do not show strong trends in the IRX-beta diagram because their\nattenuation curves are, on average, similar. Similarly, there is no shift in\nthe IRX-beta locus between starbursts and normal star-forming galaxies, both\ntypes having, on average, steep attenuation curves.

We\nshow that the presence of the warm corona is an important element of the broad\nband spectrum which decreases the dependence of the relative Fe II emissivity\non the Eddington ratio, and allows to reproduce the rare cases of the\nparticularly strong Fe II emitters. Results are sensitive to the adopted cloud\ndistance, and strong Fe II emission can be obtain either by adopting strongly\nsuper-solar metallicity, or much shorter distance than traditionally obtained\nfrom reverberation mapping. We modeled in a similar way the UV plane defined by\nthe Mg II line and Fe II UV pseudo-continuum, but here our approach is less\nsuccessful, in general overproducing the Fe II strength. We found that the Fe\nII optical and UV emissivity depend in a different way on the turbulent\nvelocity and metallicity, and the best extension of the model in order to cover\nboth planes is to allow very large turbulent velocities in the Broad Line\nRegion clouds. \n\n"}

KISS15s shows long-duration optical continuum and\nemission line light curves, indicating that KISS15s is powered by a continuous\ninteraction between the expanding ejecta and dense circumstellar medium (CSM).\nThe H$\\alpha$ emission line profile can be decomposed into four Gaussians of\nnarrow, intermediate, blue-shifted intermediate, and broad velocity width\ncomponents, with a full width at half maximum of $\\lesssim 100$, $\\sim 2,000$,\nand $\\sim 14,000$ km s${}^{-1}$ for the narrow, intermediate, and broad\ncomponents, respectively.

We derived accurate stellar ages for the cluster NGC6530,\nassociated with the Lagoon Nebula to infer its SF history. We use the Gaia-ESO\nsurvey observations and Gaia DR2 data, to derive cluster membership and\nfundamental stellar parameters. We identified 652 confirmed and 9 probable\nmembers. The reddening inferred for members and non-members allows us to\ndistinguish MS stars and giants, in agreement with the distances inferred from\nGaia DR2 data. The foreground and background stars show a spatial pattern that\ntraces the 3D structure of the nebular dust component. We derive stellar ages\nfor 382 confirmed cluster members and we find that the gravity-sensitive gamma\nindex distribution for M stars is correlated with stellar age. For all members\nwith Teff<5500 K, the mean logarithmic age is 5.84 (units of years) with a\ndispersion of 0.36 dex. The age distribution of stars with accretion and/or\ndisk (CTTSe) is similar to that of stars without accretion and without disk\n(WTTSp). We interpret this dispersion as evidence of a real age spread since\nthe total uncertainties on age determinations, derived from Monte Carlo\nsimulations, are significantly smaller than the observed spread. This\nconclusion is supported by the evidence of a decreasing of the\ngravity-sensitive gamma index as a function of stellar ages. The presence of\nthe age spread is also supported by the spatial distribution and the kinematics\nof old and young members. In particular, members with accretion and/or disk,\nformed in the last 1 Myr, show evidence of subclustering around the cluster\ncenter, in the Hourglass Nebula and in the M8-E region, suggesting a possible\ntriggering of star formation events by the O-type star ionization fronts. \n\n"}
