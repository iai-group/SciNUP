We will mainly describe the algebraic structure, its natural morphisms\nand parameterizations. The theory of total positivity will play a particularly\nimportant role.\n  Then, we anticipate on the probabilistic part by exhibiting a canonical\nmeasure on geometric crystals. It uses as ingredients the superpotential for\nthe flag manifold and a measure invariant under the crystal actions. The image\nmeasure under the weight map plays the role of Duistermaat-Heckman measure. Its\nLaplace transform defines Whittaker functions, providing an interesting formula\nfor all Lie groups. Then it appears clearly that Whittaker functions are to\ngeometric crystals, what characters are to combinatorial crystals. The\nLittlewood-Richardson rule is also exposed.\n  Finally we present the probabilistic approach that allows to find the\ncanonical measure. It is based on the fundamental idea that the Wiener measure\nwill induce the adequate measure on the algebraic structures through the path\nmodel.\n  In the last chapter, we show how our geometric model degenerates to the\ncontinuous classical Littelmann path model and thus recover known results.

The second question is whether the unipotent\nradical of any normal supersubgroup H of G coincides with the intersection of H\nand G_u, where G_u is the unipotent radical of G. Both questions have\naffirmative answers in the category of algebraic groups (in the second case one\nhas to assume additionally that G and H are reduced whenever char K >0).\nSurprisingly, using the technique of Harish-Chandra superpairs and a complete\ndescription of an action of an algebraic supergroup on an abelian supergroups\nby supergroup automorphisms we found out rather simple counterexamples to both\nquestions. Besides, the second counterexample shows that the reductivity of G\ndoes not imply that G_{ev} has even finite unipotent radical.

For example, one might be interested\nin the clustering structure of a data graph near a prespecified \"seed set\" of\nnodes, or one might be interested in finding partitions in an image that are\nnear a prespecified \"ground truth\" set of pixels. Locally-biased problems of\nthis sort are particularly challenging for popular eigenvector-based machine\nlearning and data analysis tools. At root, the reason is that eigenvectors are\ninherently global quantities, thus limiting the applicability of\neigenvector-based methods in situations where one is interested in very local\nproperties of the data.\n  In this paper, we address this issue by providing a methodology to construct\nsemi-supervised eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian, and we illustrate how these\nlocally-biased eigenvectors can be used to perform locally-biased machine\nlearning. These semi-supervised eigenvectors capture\nsuccessively-orthogonalized directions of maximum variance, conditioned on\nbeing well-correlated with an input seed set of nodes that is assumed to be\nprovided in a semi-supervised manner. We show that these semi-supervised\neigenvectors can be computed quickly as the solution to a system of linear\nequations; and we also describe several variants of our basic method that have\nimproved scaling properties.

Here Xcan is the complement of an anticanonical\ndivisor in a Langlands dual quadric. The superpotential W is a regular function\non Xcan and is written in terms of coordinates which are naturally identified\nwith a cohomology basis of the original quadric. This superpotential is shown\nto extend the earlier Landau-Ginzburg model of Givental, and to be isomorphic\nto the Lie-theoretic mirror introduced by Rietsch. We also introduce a Laurent\npolynomial superpotential which is the restriction of W to a particular torus\nin Xcan. Together with results of Pech-Rietsch for odd quadrics, we obtain a\ncombinatorial model for the Laurent polynomial superpotential in terms of a\nquiver, in the vein of those introduced in the 1990's by Givental for type A\nfull flag varieties. These Laurent polynomial superpotentials form a single\nseries, despite the fact that our mirrors of even quadrics are defined on dual\nquadrics, while the mirror to an odd quadric is naturally defined on a\nprojective space. Finally, we express flat sections of the (dual) Dubrovin\nconnection in a natural way in terms of oscillating integrals associated to\n(Xcan,W) and compute explicitly a particular flat section. \n\n"}

Our first major result\nis a characterization of smoothing operators $A$ that in particular implies\nsmoothness of the maps $\\pi^A \\colon G \\to B(\\cH), g \\mapsto \\pi(g)A$. The\nconcept of a smoothing operator is particularly powerful for representations\n$(\\pi,\\cH)$ which are semibounded, i.e., there exists an element $x_0 \\in\\g$\nfor which all operators $i\\dd\\pi(x)$, $x \\in \\g$, from the derived\nrepresentation are uniformly bounded from above in some neighborhood of $x_0$.\nOur second main result asserts that this implies that $\\cH^\\infty$ coincides\nwith the space of smooth vectors for the one-parameter group $\\pi_{x_0}(t) =\n\\pi(\\exp tx_0)$. We then show that natural types of smoothing operators can be\nused to obtain host algebras and that, for every metrizable Lie group, the\nclass of semibounded representations can be covered completely by host\nalgebras.

We explore several combinatorial properties of $NC_A(n,d)$,\nincluding its Coxeter word basis, length function, and Hilbert-Poincare series,\nand show that the corresponding generalized Coxeter group is not a flat\ndeformation of $NC_A(n,d)$. These algebras yield symmetric semigroup module\ncategories that are necessarily not monoidal; we write down their Tannaka-Krein\nduality.\n  Further motivated by the Broue-Malle-Rouquier (BMR) freeness conjecture [J.\nreine angew. math. 1998], we define generalized nil-Coxeter algebras over all\ndiscrete real or complex reflection groups $W$, finite or infinite. We provide\na complete classification of all such algebras that are finite-dimensional.\nRemarkably, these turn out to be either the usual nil-Coxeter algebras, or the\nalgebras $NC_A(n,d)$.

These eigenvalues obey furthermore a variational\nprinciple that allows us to define naturally a multidimensional power spectrum.\nThe eigenmodes, as far as they are concerned, exhibit a data-adaptive character\nmanifested in their phase which allows us in turn to define a multidimensional\nphase spectrum.\n  The resulting data-adaptive harmonic (DAH) modes allow for reducing the\ndata-driven modeling effort to elemental models stacked per frequency, only\ncoupled at different frequencies by the same noise realization. In particular,\nthe DAH decomposition extracts time-dependent coefficients stacked by Fourier\nfrequency which can be efficiently modeled---provided the decay of temporal\ncorrelations is sufficiently well-resolved---within a class of multilayer\nstochastic models (MSMs) tailored here on stochastic Stuart-Landau oscillators.\n  Applications to the Lorenz 96 model and to a stochastic heat equation driven\nby a space-time white noise, are considered.

Krein Abstract: There are constructed linear Hamiltonian (dynamical) systems such that their\nno nonzero trajectory has usual asymptotical dichotomy property. In particular\nthere is solved (in the negative) one of the so-called M. G. Krein problem. In\nfact Definition: Let J be period-2 unitary operator and U be linear operator.\n  If U^*JU = UJU^* = J then U is said to be J-unitary.\n  KREIN Problem: given a J-unitary operator U, does there exist an U-invariant\nsubspace L, say, with r(U|L)\\leq1 ?\n  In the special case that the operator U^*U-I is compact this problem was\nsolved in the positive by M.G.Krein in 1964. We shall show that, by contrast,\nin the general case such a subspace L needs not exist. Moreover, there asserts\nTheorem: For every real c>0 there exists some J-unitary operator U such that\n(i) if L is some nonzero U-invariant subspace, then r(U|L)>c; (ii) if L' is\nsome nonzero U^{-1}-invariant subspace, then r(U^{-1}|L')>c;\n  This result applies both to the real space case and to the complex space\ncase. In addition, one can assume that U is linear symplectic automorphism. A\nsimilar result is obtained for the case of continuous 'dynamic' and for the\nquestion: does there exist a nonzero quasistable manifold? \n\n"}
{"id": "math/9909119", "contents": "Title: Some bijective correspondences involving domino tableaux Abstract: We define a number of new combinatorial operations on skew semistandard\ndomino tableaux, which together with constructions introduced earlier by C.\nCarre and B. Leclerc, define an elegant structure on the set of these tableaux,\nthat closely parallels the structure defined in [math.CO/9908099] for ordinary\nskew semistandard tableaux, that is related to the Littlewood-Richardson rule.\nThese operations are: (1) a bijection between semistandard domino tableaux and\ncertain pairs of ordinary tableaux of the same weight that together fill the\nsame shape; (2) a weight preserving transformation of domino tableaux to\nordinary tableaux of a related shape (the correspondence involves 2-quotients)\nwith the property that Yamanouchi domino tableaux correspond precisely to\nLittlewood-Richardson tableaux; (3) a correspondence between Yamanouchi domino\ntableaux of shape $\\lambda$ and weight $\\mu$ and Yamanouchi domino tableaux of\nshape $\\mu'$ and weight $\\lambda$, where $\\mu'$ is $\\mu$ scaled by a factor 2.\nThe property at the heart of the structure so defined is that operations (1)\nand (2) commute with the coplactic operations (implicitly) defined by Carre and\nLeclerc. (1) elucidates their bijection analogous to that of Robinson (a.k.a.\nthe Robinson-Schensted correspondence), while the operation of moving chains in\ndomino tableaux underlying (2) is very similar to jeu de taquin. \n\n"}

Fock space representations $V_p$ of $q(n+1)$ are defined by\nmeans of these creation and annihilation operators. These new representations\nare introduced as quotient modules of some induced module of $q(n+1)$. The\nrepresentations $V_p$ are not graded, but they possess a number of properties\nthat are of importance for physical applications. For $p$ a positive integer,\nthese representations $V_p$ are finite-dimensional, with a unique highest\nweight (of multiplicity 1). The Hermitian form that is consistent with the\nnatural adjoint operation on $q(n+1)$ is shown to be positive definite on\n$V_p$. For $q(2)$ these representations are ``dispin''.
