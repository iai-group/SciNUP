These results are consistent with the absence of the\noxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova\nejecta into the protoplanetary disk. Instead, the presence of Al-26 in the\noldest Solar System solids (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions or CAIs) and its\napparent uniform distribution with the inferred canonical Al-26/Al-27 ratio of\n(4.5-5)E-5 support the inheritance of Al-26 from the parent giant molecular\ncloud.

Systematics and uncertainties of the\n  mid-infrared spectral analysis methods Abstract: The spectral region around 10 micrometer, showing prominent dust emission\nbands, is commonly used to derive the chemical composition of protoplanetary\ndust. Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, but so\nfar, no comparative test has been performed to test their validity. We\ncalculated model spectra of disk models with different geometries and central\nsources, using a 2D radiative transfer code. These spectra were then fitted in\na blind test using four different spectral decomposition methods. We studied\nthe effect of disk structure (flared vs. flat), inclination angle, size of the\ninner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition. Our\nresults show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate\nsystematically from the real chemical composition. Out of the four tested\nspectral decomposition methods, our new two-layer temperature distribution\nmethod, differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show\nthe weakest systematic effects. The reason for the deviations of the results\ngiven by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e.g. single\naverage grain temperature or one component continuum).

In general, psi cannot be measured, but for transiting planets\none can measure the angle lambda between the sky projections of the two axes\nvia the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems. We find that the semi-major\naxis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the eccentricity\ndistribution is determined after the disk dissipation. We also find that there\nmay be an optimum disk mass which leads to the observed a-e distribution. Our\nsimulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in\nmean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's\nperturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed\nrate of MMRs.

We search for stable, self-consistent N-body orbits with the so\ncalled GAMP method that incorporates stability constraints into the\noptimization algorithm. Our searches reveal only small regions of stable\nmotions in the phase space of three-planet, coplanar configurations. Most\nlikely, if the planetary masses are in 10-Jupiter-mass range, they may be\nstable only if the planets are involved in two- or three-body mean motion\nresonances (MMRs).

Light curves with detectable\nplanetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from the\ncorresponding Paczy\\'{n}ski shapes. We find that the time scale of planetary\ndeviations in light curves increase (up to 3-4 days) as the source size\nincreases.

We argue that hot Jupiter\natmospheres, with possibly fast (sonic) wind speeds, may require a more\nstrongly coupled treatment, formally in the regime of radiation-hydrodynamics.\nTo lowest order in v/c, relativistic Doppler shifts distort line profiles along\noptical paths with finite wind velocity gradients. This leads to flow-dependent\ndeviations in the effective emission and absorption properties of the\natmospheric medium. Evaluating the overall impact of these distortions on the\nradiative structure of a dynamic atmosphere is non-trivial. We present\ntransmissivity and systematic equivalent width excess calculations which\nsuggest possibly important consequences for radiation transport in hot Jupiter\natmospheres. If winds are fast and bulk Doppler shifts are indeed important for\nthe global radiative balance, accurate modeling and reliable data\ninterpretation for hot Jupiter atmospheres may prove challenging: it would\ninvolve anisotropic and dynamic radiative transfer in a coupled\nradiation-hydrodynamical flow.

In this paper we use the different metallicity\ndependance of X-ray photoevaporation and planet formation to discriminate\nbetween these two processes.

The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and\ninclude grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the\nresistivity of the gas. The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri\nstars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar\nX-ray luminosity, but can be produced by varying these together with the disk\nmagnetic flux. The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling\nof grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence,\nthrough three effects: (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically\ninactive dead zone extending above two scale heights, while turbulence in the\nmagnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only\nabout one scale height. (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically\nin waves driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the\nlaminar rates, so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk\natmosphere becomes dust-depleted. (3) With sufficient depletion, the dead zone\nis thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The MHD results also\nshow that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of dust into the\natmosphere. The photosphere height changes by up to one-third over a few\norbits, while the extinction along lines of sight grazing the disk surface\nvaries by factors of two over times down to 0.1 orbit.

Under the assumption of\nmaximally efficient radiative ablation, we derive two fundamental constraints\nthat the solid bodies must satisfy in order that their evaporation during the\nplanetary nebula phase should generate a high enough gas phase metallicity. A\nlocal constraint implies that the bodies must be larger than tens of meters,\nwhile a global constraint implies that the total mass of the solid body\nreservoir must exceed a few hundredths of a solar mass.

New Spitzer\n  observations at 3.6 microns Abstract: We present a new primary transit observation of the hot-jupiter HD189733b,\nobtained at 3.6 microns with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the\nSpitzer Space Telescope. Previous measurements at 3.6 microns suffered from\nstrong systematics and conclusions could hardly be obtained with confidence on\nthe water detection by comparison of the 3.6 and 5.8 microns observations. We\nuse a high S/N Spitzer photometric transit light curve to improve the precision\nof the near infrared radius of the planet at 3.6 microns. The observation has\nbeen performed using high-cadence time series integrated in the subarray mode.\nWe are able to derive accurate system parameters, including planet-to-star\nradius ratio, impact parameter, scale of the system, and central time of the\ntransit from the fits of the transit light curve. We compare the results with\ntransmission spectroscopic models and with results from previous observations\nat the same wavelength. We obtained the following system parameters:\nR_p/R_\\star=0.15566+0.00011-0.00024, b=0.661+0.0053-0.0050, and\na/R_\\star=8.925+0.0490-0.0523 at 3.6 microns. These measurements are three\ntimes more accurate than previous studies at this wavelength because they\nbenefit from greater observational efficiency and less statistic and systematic\nerrors. Nonetheless, we find that the radius ratio has to be corrected for\nstellar activity and present a method to do so using ground-based long-duration\nphotometric follow-up in the V-band. The resulting planet-to-star radius ratio\ncorrected for the stellar variability is in agreement with the previous\nmeasurement obtained in the same bandpass (Desert et al. 2009). We also discuss\nthat water vapour could not be evidenced by comparison of the planetary radius\nmeasured at 3.6 and 5.8 microns, because the radius measured at 3.6 microns is\naffected by absorption by other species, possibly Rayleigh scattering by haze. \n\n"}

Current models suggest that this is the first transiting\nrocky planet found outside the solar system. Given that the planet orbits a\nsolar-like star at a distance of on ly 4.5 R*, it is expected that material\nreleased from its surface may then form an exosphere. AIMS: We constrai n the\nproperties of the exosphere by observing the planet in- and out-of-transit.\nDetecting of the exosphere of CoRoT-7b would for the first time allow to study\nthe material originating in the surface of a rocky extrasolar planet. We scan\nthe entire optical spectrum for any lines originating from the planet, focusing\nparticularly on spectral lines such as those detected in Mercury, and Io in our\nsolar system. METHODS: Since lines originating in the exosphere are expected to\nbe narrow, we observed CoRoT-7b at high resolution with UVES on the VLT. By\nsubtracting the two spectra from each other, we search for emission and\nabsorption lines originating in the exosph ere of CoRoT-7b.

This variable grain population results in a 'wingnut'\nmorphology to the dust density distribution.

About one third of the active region flux\ncancels at the internal polarity inversion line in the 2.5~days leading up to\nthe eruption. In this period, the coronal structure evolves from a weakly to a\nhighly sheared arcade and then to a sigmoid that crosses the inversion line in\nthe inverse direction. These properties suggest that a flux rope has formed\nprior to the eruption. The amount of cancellation implies that up to 60% of the\nactive region flux could be in the body of the flux rope. We point out that\nonly part of the cancellation contributes to the flux in the rope if the arcade\nis only weakly sheared, as in the first part of the evolution. This reduces the\nestimated flux in the rope to $\\sim\\!30%$ or less of the active region flux. We\nsuggest that the remaining discrepancy between our estimate and the limiting\nvalue of $\\sim\\!10%$ of the active region flux, obtained previously by the flux\nrope insertion method, results from the incomplete coherence of the flux rope,\ndue to nonuniform cancellation along the polarity inversion line. A hot linear\nfeature is observed in the active region which rises as part of the eruption\nand then likely traces out field lines close to the axis of the flux rope. The\nflux cancellation and changing magnetic connections at one end of this feature\nsuggest that the flux rope reaches coherence by reconnection shortly before and\nearly in the impulsive phase of the associated flare.

The present\ninvestigation exploits the analogy between the neo-Darwinian genetic evolution\nmechanism governing the first phase, and the memetic evolution mechanism\ngoverning the second phase. From the outset of the latter until very recently\n-- about the year 2000 -- the growth of the global population N was roughly\ngoverned by an equation of the form dN/Ndt= N/T*, in which T* is a coefficient\nintroduced (in 1960) by von Foerster, who evaluated it empirically as about two\nhundred thousand million years.

Given the mass loss rates estimated\nfrom current observations --- and from theoretical arguments --- magnetic\nfields will dominate the flow provided that field strength near the planet is\ngreater than $\\sim1$ gauss, comparable to the surface fields of the Sun and\nJupiter. The problem can be separated into an inner regime, near the planet,\nwhere the outflow is launched, and an outer regime where the flow follows\n(primarily) stellar field lines and interacts with the stellar wind. This paper\nconcentrates on the flow in the inner regime.

In all cases, the time span\nof observations must increase for TTVs to provide strong constraints on planet\nmasses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multiple\ntransiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits).

All the previous studies on the core-accretion\nmodel assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly. In fact,\nthe envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals\nbecause icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via\nstrong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope.

We show that, as long as n > 3 (as is\nusually assumed), a more critical parameter than n is the maximum wavelength in\nthe turbulent velocity field, {\\lambda}_MAX. This is because {\\lambda}_MAX\ncarries most of the turbulent energy, and thereby influences both the amount\nand the spatial coherence of the angular momentum in the core. We show that the\nformation of dense filaments during collapse depends critically on\n{\\lambda}_MAX, and we explain this finding using a force balance analysis. We\nalso show that the core only has a high probability of fragmenting if\n{\\lambda}_MAX > 0.5 R_CORE (where R_CORE is the core radius); that the dominant\nmode of fragmentation involves the formation and break-up of filaments; and\nthat, although small protostellar disks (with radius R_DISK <= 20 AU) form\nroutinely, more extended disks are rare. In turbulent, low-mass cores of the\ntype we simulate here, the formation of large, fragmenting protostellar disks\nis suppressed by early fragmentation in the filaments. \n\n"}

The cold, dusty\nclumps surrounding RCW 120 are arranged in an almost spherical shell and\nharbour many young stellar objects. By performing high-resolution,\nthree-dimensional SPH simulations of HII regions expanding into fractal\nmolecular clouds, we investigate whether the formation of massive clumps in\ndense, swept-up shells necessarily requires the C&C mechanism. In a second\nstep, we use RADMC-3D to compute the synthetic dust continuum emission from our\nsimulations, in order to compare them with observations of RCW 120 made with\nAPEX-LABOCA at 870 micron. We show that a distribution of clumps similar to the\none seen in RCW 120 can readily be explained by a non-uniform initial molecular\ncloud structure. Hence, a shell-like configuration of massive clumps does not\nimply that the C&C mechanism is at work. Rather, we find a hybrid form of\ntriggering, which combines elements of C&C and Radiatively Driven Implosion\n(RDI). In addition, we investigate the reliability of deriving clump masses\nfrom their 870 micron emission. We find that for clumps with more than 100\nM_sun the observational estimates are accurate to within a factor of two and\nthat, even at these long wavelengths, it is important to account for the\nradiative heating from triggered, embedded protostars. \n\n"}

However, the\nmajority of solar-type stars form in binary systems, so the impact of binary\ncompanions on protoplanetary disks is an important element in our understanding\nof planet formation. We have compiled a combined multiplicity/disk census of\nTaurus-Auriga, plus a restricted sample of close binaries in other regions, in\norder to explore the role of multiplicity in disk evolution. Our results imply\nthat the tidal influence of a close (<40 AU) binary companion significantly\nhastens the process of protoplanetary disk dispersal, as ~2/3 of all close\nbinaries promptly disperse their disks within <1 Myr after formation. However,\nprompt disk dispersal only occurs for a small fraction of wide binaries and\nsingle stars, with ~80%-90% retaining their disks for at least ~2--3 Myr (but\nrarely for more than ~5 Myr). Our new constraints on the disk clearing\ntimescale have significant implications for giant planet formation; most single\nstars have 3--5 Myr within which to form giant planets, whereas most close\nbinary systems would have to form giant planets within <1 Myr. If core\naccretion is the primary mode for giant planet formation, then gas giants in\nclose binaries should be rare. Conversely, since almost all single stars have a\nsimilar period of time within which to form gas giants, their relative rarity\nin RV surveys indicates either that the giant planet formation timescale is\nvery well-matched to the disk dispersal timescale or that features beyond the\ndisk lifetime set the likelihood of giant planet formation. \n\n"}

This\nis consistent with recent theoretical works, which indicate that the tidal Q of\nplanet-hosting stars can indeed be much larger than the values inferred from\nstellar binaries. On the other hand, recent measurements of Rossiter-McLaughlin\neffects in transiting hot Jupiter systems not only reveal that many such\nsystems have misaligned stellar spin with respect to the orbital axis, but also\nshow that systems with cooler host stars tend to have aligned spin and orbital\naxes. Winn et al. suggested that this obliquity - temperature correlation may\nbe explained by efficient damping of stellar obliquity due to tidal dissipation\nin the star. This explanation, however, is in apparent contradiction with the\nsurvival of these short-period hot Jupiters. We show that in the solar-type\nparent stars of close-in exoplanetary systems, the effective tidal Q governing\nthe damping of stellar obliquity can be much smaller than that governing\norbital decay. This is because for misaligned systems, the tidal potential\ncontains a Fourier component with frequency equal to the stellar spin frequency\n(in the rotating frame of the star). This component can excite inertial waves\nin the convective envelope of the star, and the dissipation of inertial waves\nthen leads to a spin-orbit alignment torque, but not orbital decay. By\ncontrast, for aligned systems, such inertial wave excitation is forbidden since\nthe tidal forcing frequency is much larger than the stellar spin frequency. We\nderive a general effective tidal evolution theory for misaligned binaries,\ntaking account of different tidal responses and dissipation rates for different\ntidal forcing components. \n\n"}

From\nthe amplitude of the beaming modulation we derived a mass of 10 +/- 2 M_Jup for\nthe secondary, suggesting that KOI-13.01 was a massive planet, with one of the\nlargest known radii. We also found in the data a periodicity of unknown origin\nwith a period of 1.0595 d and a peak-to-peak modulation of ~60 ppm.

Typically, such points are\nembedded into low-acceleration bubbles where modified gravity theories a` la\nMOND predict significant deviations from Newton's laws. As has been pointed out\nrecently, the Earth-Sun bubble may be visited by the LISA Pathfinder spacecraft\nin the near future, providing a unique occasion to put these theories to a\ndirect test.

The reconnection process is made\nasymmetric along the inflow direction by allowing the initial upstream magnetic\nfield strengths and densities to differ, and along the outflow direction by\nplacing the initial perturbation near a conducting wall boundary that\nrepresents the photosphere. When the upstream magnetic fields are asymmetric,\nthe post-flare loop structure is distorted into a characteristic skewed candle\nflame shape. The simulations can thus be used to provide constraints on the\nreconnection asymmetry in post-flare loops. More hard X-ray emission is\nexpected to occur at the footpoint on the weak magnetic field side because\nenergetic particles are more likely to escape the magnetic mirror there than at\nthe strong magnetic field footpoint. The footpoint on the weak magnetic field\nside is predicted to move more quickly because of the requirement in two\ndimensions that equal amounts of flux must be reconnected from each upstream\nregion.

The\napproximately 10-Earth-mass solid core responsible for the attraction of the\ngaseous envelope has to form before gas dissipation in the protoplanetary disc\nis completed within 1-10 million years. Building up the core by collisions\nbetween km-sized planetesimals fails to meet this time-scale constraint,\nespecially at wide stellar separations. Nonetheless, gas-giant planets are\ndetected by direct imaging at wide orbital distances. In this paper, we\nnumerically study the growth of cores by the accretion of cm-sized pebbles\nloosely coupled to the gas. We measure the accretion rate onto seed masses\nranging from a large planetesimal to a fully grown 10-Earth-mass core and test\ndifferent particle sizes. The numerical results are in good agreement with our\nanalytic expressions, indicating the existence of two accretion regimes, one\nset by the azimuthal and radial particle drift for the lower seed masses and\nthe other, for higher masses, by the velocity at the edge of the Hill sphere.\nIn the former, the optimally accreted particle size increases with core mass,\nwhile in the latter the optimal size is centimeters, independent of core mass.\nWe discuss the implications for rapid core growth of gas-giant and ice-giant\ncores. We conclude that pebble accretion can resolve the long-standing core\naccretion time-scale conflict. This requires a near-unity dust-to-gas ratio in\nthe midplane, particle growth to mm and cm and the formation of massive\nplanetesimals or low radial pressure support. The core growth time-scale is\nshortened by a factor 30-1,000 at 5 AU and by a factor 100-10,000 at 50 AU,\ncompared to the gravitationally focused accretion of, respectively,\nlow-scale-height planetesimal fragments or standard km-sized planetesimals. \n\n"}

Their orbital evolution depends on the physical mechanisms that\ncause tidal dissipation, and these are still not well understood. We refine the\ntheory of the equilibrium tide in fluid bodies that are partly or entirely\nconvective, to predict the dynamical evolution of the systems. In particular,\nwe examine the validity of modeling the tidal dissipation by the quality factor\nQ, as is commonly done. We consider here the simplest case where the considered\nstar or planet rotates uniformly, all spins are aligned, and the companion is\nreduced to a point-mass. The first manifestation of the tide is to distort the\nshape of the star or planet adiabatically along the line of centers. This\ngenerates the divergence-free velocity field of the adiabatic equilibrium tide\nwhich is decoupled from the dynamical tide. The tidal kinetic energy is\ndissipated into heat through turbulent friction, which is modeled here as an\neddy-viscosity acting on the adiabatic tidal flow. This dissipation induces a\nsecond velocity field, the dissipative equilibrium tide, which is in quadrature\nwith the exciting potential; it is responsible for the imaginary part of the\ndisturbing function, which is implemented in the dynamical evolution equations,\nfrom which one derives characteristic evolution times. The rate at which the\nsystem evolves depends on the physical properties of tidal dissipation, and\nspecifically on how the eddy viscosity varies with tidal frequency and on the\nthickness of the convective envelope for the fluid equilibrium tide. At low\nfrequency, this tide retards by a constant time delay, whereas it lags by a\nconstant angle when the tidal frequency exceeds the convective turnover rate. \n\n"}

Our self-consistent approach allow\nus to analyze in detail the dynamo feedback loop. The dynamos we obtain are\ntypically dominated by an axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field and an axial\ndipole component. We show that the ability of the outer shear layer to produce\na strong toroidal field depends critically on the presence of a conducting\nouter wall, which shields the fluid from the vacuum outside. The generation of\nthe axisymmetric poloidal field, on the other hand, occurs in the equatorial\nbelt and does not depend on the wall properties. \n\n"}

Recent\nexperiments have shown that such flows may excite Coriolis restored inertial\nmodes. The present work aims to better understand the properties of the\nobserved modes and the nature of their excitation. Using numerical solutions\ndescribing forced inertial modes of a uniformly rotating fluid inside a\nspherical shell, we first identify the observed oscillations of the Couette\nflow with non-axisymmetric, retrograde, equatorially anti-symmetric inertial\nmodes, confirming first attempts using a full sphere model. Although the model\nhas no differential rotation, identification is possible because a large\nfraction of the fluid in a spherical Couette flow rotates rigidly. From the\nobserved sequence of the excited modes appearing when the inner sphere is\nslowed down by step, we identify a critical Rossby number associated with a\ngiven mode and below which it is excited. The matching between this critical\nnumber and the one derived from the phase velocity of the numerically computed\nmodes shows that these modes are excited by an instability likely driven by the\ncritical layer that develops in the shear layer staying along the tangent\ncylinder of the inner sphere. \n\n"}

The planets invoked in that work were\nsignificantly more massive than Jupiter, and moved on orbits that were mutually\ncrossing - an architecture which suggests that mutual encounters and strong\ngravitational interactions are almost guaranteed. In this work, we perform a\nhighly detailed analysis of the proposed HW Vir planetary system. First, we\nconsider the dynamical stability of the system as proposed in the discovery\nwork. Through a mapping process involving 91,125 individual simulations, we\nfind that the system is so unstable that the planets proposed simply cannot\nexist, due to mean lifetimes of less than a thousand years across the whole\nparameter space. We then present a detailed re-analysis of the observational\ndata on HW Vir, deriving a new orbital solution that provides a very good fit\nto the observational data. Our new analysis yields a system with planets more\nwidely spaced, and of lower mass, than that proposed in the discovery work, and\nyields a significantly greater (and more realistic) estimate of the uncertainty\nin the orbit of the outermost body. Despite this, a detailed dynamical analysis\nof this new solution similarly reveals that it also requires the planets to\nmove on orbits that are simply not dynamically feasible. Our results imply that\nsome mechanism other than the influence of planetary companions must be the\nprincipal cause of the observed eclipse timing variations for HW Vir. If the\nsys- tem does host exoplanets, they must move on orbits differing greatly from\nthose previously proposed. Our results illustrate the critical importance of\nperforming dynamical analyses as a part of the discovery process for\nmultiple-planet exoplanetary systems. \n\n"}

We\nnumerically investigate how the coupled effect of collisions and radiation\npressure can affect the formation and survival of radial and azimutal\nstructures in a disc perturbed by a planet. We consider two set-ups: a planet\nembedded within an extended disc and a planet exterior to an inner debris ring.\nWe use the DyCoSS code of Thebault(2012) and derive synthetic images of the\nsystem in scattered light. The planet's mass and orbit, as well as the disc's\ncollisional activity are explored as free parameters.\n  We find that collisions always significantly damp planet-induced structures.\nFor the case of an embedded planet, the planet's signature, mostly a density\ngap around its radial position, should remain detectable in head-on images if\nM_planet > M_Saturn. If the system is seen edge-on, however, inferring the\npresence of the planet is much more difficult, although some planet-induced\nsignatures might be observable under favourable conditions.\n  For the inner-ring/external-planet case, planetary perturbations cannot\nprevent collision-produced small fragments from populating the regions beyond\nthe ring: The radial luminosity profile exterior to the ring is close to the\none it should have in the absence of the planet. However, a Jovian planet on a\ncircular orbit leaves precessing azimutal structures that can be used to\nindirectly infer its presence.

We used about 500 days of high-precision,\nhigh-duty-cycle optical photometry collected by Kepler to study the rotation of\nthe star and the evolution of its photospheric active regions. Methods. We\napplied a maximum-entropy light curve inversion technique to model the flux\nrotational modulation induced by active regions that consist of dark spots and\nbright solar-like faculae with a fixed area ratio. Their configuration was\nvaried after a fixed time interval to take their evolution into account.

Our modelling approach reproduces the light variations of Kepler-17\nwith a standard deviation of the residuals comparable with the precision of\nKepler photometry. We find several active longitudes where individual active\nregions appear, evolve, and decay with lifetimes comparable to those observed\nin the Sun, although the star has a spotted area ~10-15 times larger than the\nSun at the maximum of the 11-yr cycle.

{"id": "1210.4009", "contents": "Title: Planet formation models: the interplay with the planetesimal disc Abstract: According to the sequential accretion model, giant planet formation is based\nfirst on the formation of a solid core which, when massive enough, can\ngravitationally bind gas from the nebula to form the envelope. In order to\ntrigger the accretion of gas, the core has to grow up to several Earth masses\nbefore the gas component of the protoplanetary disc dissipates. We compute the\nformation of planets, considering the oligarchic regime for the growth of the\nsolid core. Embryos growing in the disc stir their neighbour planetesimals,\nexciting their relative velocities, which makes accretion more difficult. We\ncompute the excitation state of planetesimals, as a result of stirring by\nforming planets, and gas-solid interactions. We find that the formation of\ngiant planets is favoured by the accretion of small planetesimals, as their\nrandom velocities are more easily damped by the gas drag of the nebula.\nMoreover, the capture radius of a protoplanet with a (tiny) envelope is also\nlarger for small planetesimals. However, planets migrate as a result of\ndisc-planet angular momentum exchange, with important consequences for their\nsurvival: due to the slow growth of a protoplanet in the oligarchic regime,\nrapid inward type I migration has important implications on intermediate mass\nplanets that have not started yet their runaway accretion phase of gas. Most of\nthese planets are lost in the central star. Surviving planets have either\nmasses below 10 ME or above several Jupiter masses. To form giant planets\nbefore the dissipation of the disc, small planetesimals (~ 0.1 km) have to be\nthe major contributors of the solid accretion process. However, the combination\nof oligarchic growth and fast inward migration leads to the absence of\nintermediate mass planets. Other processes must therefore be at work in order\nto explain the population of extrasolar planets presently known. \n\n"}

At a typical observing wavelength, this\ndelay can vary by tens of microseconds on five-year time scales, far in excess\nof signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays, such as that induced by a\ngravitational-wave background. Measurement of these delay variations is not\nonly crucial for the detection of such signals, but also provides an\nunparallelled measurement of the turbulent interstellar plasma at au scales. In\nthis paper we demonstrate that without consideration of wavelength- independent\nred-noise, 'simple' algorithms to correct for interstellar dispersion can\nattenuate signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays. We present a robust\nmethod for this correction, which we validate through simulations, and apply it\nto observations from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. Correction for dispersion\nvariations comes at a cost of increased band-limited white noise. We discuss\nscheduling to minimise this additional noise, and factors, such as\nscintillation, that can exacerbate the problem. Comparison with scintillation\nmeasurements confirms previous results that the spectral exponent of electron\ndensity variations in the interstellar medium often appears steeper than\nexpected. We also find a discrete change in dispersion measure of PSR\nJ1603-7202 of ~2x10^{-3} cm^{-3}pc for about 250 days.

Taking a distance to the cloud of 415 pc rather than 259 pc, the\ndistribution of ages is shifted to lower values, in the 1-3 Myr range, with a\ntail up to 10 Myr. The mass distribution spans 0.2-1.2 Msun, with median mass\nof 0.7 Msun. The distribution of fractional disk luminosities in Serpens\nresembles that of the young Taurus Molecular Cloud, with most disks consistent\nwith optically thick, passively irradiated disks in a variety of disk\ngeometries (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.1). In contrast, the distributions for the older\nUpper Scorpius and Eta Chamaeleontis clusters are dominated by optically thin\nlower luminosity disks (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.02). This evolution in fractional disk\nluminosities is concurrent with that of disk fractions. The actively accreting\nand non-accreting stars (based on Ha data) in Serpens show very similar\ndistributions in fractional disk luminosities, differing only in the brighter\ntail dominated by strongly accreting stars. In contrast with a sample of Herbig\nAe/Be stars, the T Tauri stars in Serpens do not have a clear separation in\nfractional disk luminosities for different disk geometries: both flared and\nflat disks present wider, overlapping distributions. This result is consistent\nwith previous suggestions of a faster evolution for disks around Herbig Ae/Be\nstars. Furthermore, the results for the mineralogy of the dust in the disk\nsurface do not show any correlation to either stellar and disk characteristics\nor mean cluster age in the 1-10 Myr range probed here. A possible explanation\nfor the lack of correlation is that the processes affecting the dust within\ndisks have short timescales, happening repeatedly, making it difficult to\ndistinguish long lasting evolutionary effects.

It has been noted that white dwarfs (WDs) have long-lived habitable\nzones and that a large fraction of WDs may host planets. We point out that\nduring a transit of an Earth-mass planet across a WD, the planet's atmospheric\ntransmission spectrum obtains a much higher contrast over the stellar\nbackground compared to a main-sequence host, because of the small surface area\nof the WD.

Here, we study the underlying dynamical mechanisms which\ncan incite planetary escape in two-planet post-main sequence systems. Stellar\nmass loss alone is unlikely to be rapid and high enough to eject planets at\ntypically-observed separations. However, the combination of mass loss and\nplanet-planet interactions can prompt a shift from stable to chaotic regions of\nphase space. Consequently, when mass loss ceases, the unstable configuration\nmay cause escape.

Here we take a\nstep back from GJ 1214b to investigate the role that planetary mass,\ncomposition, and temperature play in impacting the transmission spectra of\nthese low-mass low-density (LMLD) planets. Under the assumption that these\nplanets accrete modest hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and planetesimals, we use\npopulation synthesis models to show that predicted metal enrichments of the\nH/He envelope are high, with metal mass fraction Z_env values commonly 0.6 to\n0.9, or ~100 to 400+ times solar. The high mean molecular weight of such\natmospheres (\\mu ~ 5-12) would naturally help to flatten the transmission\nspectrum of most LMLD planets. The high metal abundance would also provide\nsignificant condensible material for cloud formation. It is known that the H/He\nabundance in Uranus and Neptune decreases with depth, and we show that\natmospheric evaporation of LMLD planets could expose atmospheric layers with\ngradually higher Z_env.

We focus on\nthe effect of luminosity bursts, similar in magnitude to FUors and EXors, on\nthe gas-phase abundance of CO and CO_2 in the protostellar disk and infalling\nenvelope. The evolution of a young protostar and its environment is followed\nbased on hydrodynamical models using the thin-disk approximation, coupled with\na stellar evolution code and phase transformations of CO and CO_2. The\naccretion and associated luminosity bursts in our model are caused by disk\ngravitational fragmentation followed by quick migration of the fragments onto\nthe forming protostar. We found that bursts with luminosity on the order of\n100-200 L_sun can evaporate CO ices in part of the envelope. The typical\nfreeze-out time of the gas-phase CO onto dust grains in the envelope (a few\nkyr) is much longer than the burst duration (100-200 yr). This results in an\nincreased abundance of the gas-phase CO in the envelope long after the system\nhas returned into a quiescent stage. In contrast, luminosity bursts can\nevaporate CO_2 ices only in the disk, where the freeze-out time of the\ngas-phase CO_2 is comparable to the burst duration. We thus confirm that\nluminosity bursts can leave long-lasting traces in the abundance of gas-phase\nCO in the infalling envelope, enabling the detection of recent bursts as\nsuggested by previous semi-analytical studies. \n\n"}

The explanation in vogue borrows from the\nvortex literature by suggesting that these asymmetries are the result of dust\ntrapping in giant vortices, excited via Rossby wave instability (RWI) at\nplanetary gap edges. Due to the drag force, dust trapped in vortices will\naccumulate in the center, and diffusion is needed to maintain a steady state\nover the lifetime of the disk. While previous work derived semi-analytical\nmodels of the process, in this paper we provide analytical steady-state\nsolutions. Exact solutions exist for certain vortex models.

Lagrangian particles have been implemented into\nmagnetohydrodynamic code Athena with cylindrical coordinates. We find two\ndistinct outcomes depending on the mass of the embedded planet. In the presence\nof a low mass planet ($8 M_{\\oplus}$), two narrow gaps start to open in the gas\non each side of the planet where the density waves shock. These shallow gaps\ncan dramatically affect particle drift speed and cause significant, roughly\naxisymmetric dust depletion. On the other hand, a more massive planet ($>0.1\nM_{J}$) carves out a deeper gap with sharp edges, which are unstable to the\nvortex formation. Particles with a wide range of sizes ($0.02<\\Omega t_{s}<20$)\nare trapped and settle to the midplane in the vortex, with the strongest\nconcentration for particles with $\\Omega t_{s}\\sim 1$.

The images were obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys\nonboard the Hubble Space Telescope and are located at projected distances of\n0.5-2 degrees from the SMC center, probing the main body and the wing of the\ngalaxy. We derived the star-formation histories (SFH) of the four fields using\ntwo independent procedures to fit synthetic CMDs to the data. We compare the\nSFHs derived here with our earlier results for the SMC bar to create a deep\npencil-beam survey of the global history of the central SMC. We find in all the\nsix fields observed with HST a slow star formation pace from 13 to 5-7 Gyr ago,\nfollowed by a ~ 2-3 times higher activity. This is remarkable because dynamical\nmodels do not predict a strong influence of either the LMC or the Milky Way\n(MW) at that time. The level of the intermediate-age SFR enhancement\nsystematically increases towards the center, resulting in a gradient in the\nmean age of the population, with the bar fields being systematically younger\nthan the outer ones. Star formation over the most recent 500 Myr is strongly\nconcentrated in the bar, the only exception being the area of the SMC wing.

Large companions and debris disks reported interior to ~10au, and\nexterior to ~100au indicate massive protoplanetary disc in the past.

These\nmodels allow us to determine the surface density at which thermal sweeping will\ntake over the disc's evolution and to evaluate this critical surface density as\na function of X-ray luminosity, stellar mass and inner hole radius. We find\nthat this critical surface density scales linearly with X-ray luminosity,\nincreases with inner hole radius and decreases with stellar mass and we develop\nan analytic model that reproduces these results.\n  This surface density criterion is then used to determine the evolutionary\nstate of protoplanetary discs at the point that they become unstable to\ndestruction by thermal sweeping.

Systems are stable on\nthe MS if the planets are separated by more than ~9 Hill radii. Most systems\nsurviving the MS will remain stable until the WD phase, although planets\nscattered onto small pericentres in unstable systems can be swallowed by the\nexpanding stellar envelope when the star ascends the giant branches. Mass loss\nat the end of the asymptotic giant branch triggers delayed instability in many\nsystems, leading to instabilities typically occurring at WD cooling ages of a\nfew 100 Myr. This instability occurs both in systems that survived the star's\nprevious evolution unscathed, and in systems that previously underwent\nscattering instabilities. The outcome of such instability around WDs is\noverwhelmingly the ejection of one of the planets from the system, with several\ntimes more ejections occurring during the WD phase than during the MS.\nFurthermore, few planets are scattered close to the WD, just outside the Roche\nlimit, where they can be tidally circularised. Hence, we predict that planets\nin WD systems rarely dynamically evolve to become \"hot Jupiters\". Nor does it\nappear that the observed frequency of metal pollution in WD atmospheres can be\nentirely explained by planetesimals being destabilised following instability in\nsystems of multiple giant planets, although further work incorporating low-mass\nplanets and planetesimals is needed. \n\n"}

We find that this\ncycle significantly decreases column densities of water ice at r < 30 AU, where\ndust temperatures are too high to reform water ice effectively. The radial\nextent of such region depends on the desorption energy of atomic hydrogen. Our\nmodel indicates that water ice could be deficient even outside the sublimation\nradius.

Collapse to planetesimal through super-Earth\nmasses is possible. The key condition is that grain density fluctuations reach\nlarge amplitudes on large scales, where gravitational instability proceeds most\neasily (collapse of small grains is strongly suppressed by turbulent\nvorticity). We show this leads to a new criterion for 'pebble-pile' formation\nin terms of the dimensionless particle stopping time (tau_stop > f(Q,Z,alpha)).\nIn a MMSN, this requires grains larger than a=(50,1,0.1)cm at r=(1,30,100)au.\nAt small radii, it would depend on the existence of large boulders.

Wind\n  Solutions at the Inner Disk Abstract: The gas dynamics of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is largely controlled by\nnon-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects including Ohmic resistivity, the\nHall effect and ambipolar diffusion. Among these the role of the Hall effect is\nthe least explored and most poorly understood. We have included all three\nnon-ideal MHD effects in a self-consistent manner to investigate the role of\nthe Hall effect on PPD gas dynamics using local shearing-box simulations. In\nthis first paper, we focus on the inner region of PPDs, where previous studies\nexcluding the Hall effect have revealed that the inner disk up to ~10 AU is\nlargely laminar, with accretion driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind. We confirm\nthis basic picture and show that the Hall effect introduces modest\nmodifications to the wind solutions, depending on the polarity of the\nlarge-scale poloidal magnetic field B_0 threading the disk. When B_0.Omega>0,\nthe horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified toward the disk interior,\nleading to a stronger disk wind (by ~50% or less in terms of the wind-driven\naccretion rate). The enhanced horizontal field also leads to much stronger\nlarge-scale Maxwell stress (magnetic braking) that contributes to a\nconsiderable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate. When B_0.Omega<0, the\nhorizontal magnetic field is reduced, leading to a weaker disk wind (by ~20%)\nand negligible magnetic braking. Moreover, we find that when B_0.Omega>0, the\nlaminar region extends farther to ~15 AU before the magneto-rotational\ninstability sets in, while for B_0.Omega<0, the laminar region extends only to\n~3-5 AU for a typical PPD accretion rates. Scaling relations for the wind\nproperties, especially the wind-driven accretion rate, are provided for aligned\nand anti-aligned field geometries. Issues with the symmetry of the wind\nsolutions and grain abundance are also discussed. \n\n"}

Planetesimals are scattered progressively inward by a system of 5-7\nplanets from 30-60 AU to very close-in. In successful simulations the outermost\nplanets are typically Neptune-mass.

Very few\nstudies explored the stellar evolution of triple systems, and in particular the\nmass loss phase of the evolving stellar components. Here we study the dynamical\nsecular evolution of hierarchical triple systems undergoing mass loss. We use\nthe secular evolution equations and include the effects of mass-loss and\nmass-transfer, as well as general relativistic effects. We present various\nevolutionary channels taking place in such evolving triples, and discuss both\nthe effects of mass-loss and mass-transfer in the inner binary system, as well\nas the effects of mass-loss/transfer from an outer third companion. We discuss\nseveral distinct types/regimes of triple secular evolution, where the specific\nbehavior of a triple system can sensitively depend on its hierarchy and the\nrelative importance of classical and general relativistic effects. We show that\nthe orbital changes due to mass-loss and/or mass-transfer processes can\neffectively transfer a triple system from one dynamical regime to another. In\nparticular, mass loss/transfer can both induce and quench high amplitude\n(Lidov-Kozai) variations in the eccentricity and inclination of the inner\nbinaries of evolving triples. They can also change the system dynamics from an\norderly periodic behavior to a chaotic one, and vice versa. \n\n"}

However, these large-scale fields may also be\ncontrolled by tides, as previously suggested for the star $\\tau$-boo, Mars or\nthe Early Moon. By simulating a small local patch of a rotating fluid,\n\\cite{Barker2014} have recently shown that tides can drive small-scale dynamos\nby exciting a hydrodynamic instability, the so-called elliptical (or tidal)\ninstability. By performing global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a rotating\nspherical fluid body, we investigate if this instability can also drive the\nobserved large-scale magnetic fields. We are thus interested by the dynamo\nthreshold and the generated magnetic field in order to test if such a mechanism\nis relevant for planets and stars. Rather than solving the problem in a\ngeometry deformed by tides, we consider a spherical fluid body and add a body\nforce to mimic the tidal deformation in the bulk of the fluid. This allows us\nto use an efficient spectral code to solve the magnetohydrodynamic problem. We\nfirst compare the hydrodynamic results with theoretical asymptotic results, and\nnumerical results obtained in a truely deformed ellipsoid, which confirms the\npresence of the elliptical instability. We then perform magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations, and investigate the dynamo capability of the flow. Kinematic and\nself-consistent dynamos are finally simulated, showing that the elliptical\ninstability is capable of generating dipole dominated large-scale magnetic\nfield in global simulations of a fluid rotating sphere. \n\n"}

Here we show that for large\ngrains (size >0.1 micron, containing most grain mass) in sufficiently large\nmolecular clouds (radii >1-10 pc, masses >10^4 M_sun), this scale becomes\nlarger than the characteristic sizes of pre-stellar cores (the sonic length),\nso large fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio are imprinted on cores. As a\nresult, star clusters and protostellar disks formed in large clouds should\nexhibit significant abundance spreads in the elements preferentially found in\nlarge grains. This naturally predicts populations of carbon-enhanced stars,\ncertain highly unusual stellar populations observed in nearby open clusters,\nand may explain the 'UV upturn' in early-type galaxies. It will also\ndramatically change planet formation in the resulting protostellar disks, by\npreferentially 'seeding' disks with an enhancement in large carbonaceous or\nsilicate grains. The relevant threshold for this behavior scales simply with\ncloud densities and temperatures, making straightforward predictions for\nclusters in starbursts and high-redshift galaxies. Because of the selective\nsorting by size, this process is not necessarily visible in extinction mapping.\nWe also predict the shape of the abundance distribution -- when these\nfluctuations occur, a small fraction of the cores may actually be seeded with\nabundances ~100 times the mean, such that they are almost 'totally metal'\n(Z~1)! Assuming the cores collapse, these totally metal stars would be rare (1\nin 10^4 in clusters where this occurs), but represent a fundamentally new\nstellar evolution channel. \n\n"}

The mass of the four planets can be\nestimated from either the beaming or the ellipsoidal amplitude, given the mass\nand radius of their parent stars. For KOI-13, HAT-P-7, and Kepler-76 we find\nthat the beaming-based planetary mass estimate is larger than the mass\nestimated from the ellipsoidal amplitude, consistent with previous studies.\nThis apparent discrepancy may be explained by equatorial superrotation of the\nplanet atmosphere, which induces an angle shift of the planet\nreflection/emission phase modulation, as was suggested for Kepler-76 in the\nfirst paper of this series. We propose a modified BEER model that supports\nsuperrotation, assuming either a Lambertian or geometric reflection/emission\nphase function, and provides a photometry-consistent estimate of the planetary\nmass. Our analysis shows that for Kepler-76 and HAT-P-7, the Lambertian\nsuperrotation BEER model is highly preferable over an unshifted null model,\nwhile for KOI-13 it is preferable only at a 1.4 sigma level. For TrES-2 we do\nnot find such preference. For all four systems the Lambertian superrotation\nmodel mass estimates are in excellent agreement with the planetary masses\nderived from, or constrained by, radial velocity measurements. This makes the\nLambertian superrotation BEER model a viable tool for estimating the masses of\nhot Jupiters from photometry alone.

Some mechanisms can significantly\nshorten this lifetime, allowing a few stars to start spinning up much earlier\nthan other stars.

Since all parameters\nthat are responsible for the rotational evolution, with the exception of\nenvironment properties and initial stellar rotation, are similar for all\ncomponents, we expect that significant differences among the rotation periods\ncan only arise from differences in the disc lifetimes. A photometric timeseries\nallowed us to measure the rotation periods of each component, while\nhigh-resolution spectra provided us with the fundamental parameters, $v\\sin{i}$\nand chromospheric line fluxes. The rotation periods of the components differ\nsignificantly, and the component B, which has a closer companion C, rotates\nfaster than the more distant and isolated component A.

Overall, the\nbasic picture is analogous to the conventional layered accretion scenario\napplied to the outer disk. In addition, we find that the vertical magnetic flux\nis strongly concentrated into thin, azimuthally extended shells in most of our\nsimulations beyond 15AU.

In\nthis work, we study the formation of mean motion resonance (MMR) systems,\nparticularly for the planetary configurations near 3:2 and 2:1 MMRs, and we\nconcentrate on the interplay between the resonant configuration and the\ncombination of stellar accretion rate, stellar magnetic field, speed of\nmigration and additional planets. We perform more than 1000 runs by assuming a\nsystem with a solar-like star and three surrounding planets. From the\nstatistical results, we find that under the formation scenario, the proportions\nnear 1.5 and 2.0 can reach 14.5% and 26.0%, respectively. In addition, $\\dot\nM=0.1\\times 10^{-8} ~M_\\odot ~{\\rm yr^{-1}}$ is propitious toward the formation\nof 3:2 resonance, whereas $\\dot M=2\\times 10^{-8} ~M_\\odot ~{\\rm yr^{-1}}$\ncontributes to the formation of 2:1 resonance.

The YORP effect, which arises from radiation pressure, accelerates\nthe spin rate of asymmetric asteroids, which can eventually shear themselves\napart. This pressure is maintained and enhanced around dying stars because the\noutward push of an asteroid due to stellar mass loss is insignificant compared\nto the resulting stellar luminosity increase. Consequently, giant star\nradiation will destroy nearly all bodies with radii in the range 100 m - 10 km\nthat survive their parent star's main sequence lifetime within a distance of\nabout 7 au; smaller bodies are spun apart to their strongest, competent\ncomponents.

Comet 96P/Machholz 1 is currently locked in a Kozai resonance with\nJupiter such that the value of its argument of perihelion is always close to 0\ndegrees at its shortest possible perihelion (highest eccentricity and lowest\ninclination) and about 180 degrees near its shortest aphelion (longest\nperihelion distance, lowest eccentricity and highest inclination). If this\nobject is a dynamical analogue (albeit limited) of the known ETNOs, this\nimplies that massive perturbers must keep them confined in orbital parameter\nspace.

Tidal downsizing may reduce both the\nobject mass and semimajor axis. However, most studies of tidal downsizing end\nwhen the protostellar disc disperses, while the system is embedded in its\nparent star-forming region. To compare disc fragment descendants with exoplanet\nand brown dwarf observations, the subsequent dynamical evolution must be\nexplored.\n  We carry out N-Body integrations of fragment-fragment scattering in\nmulti-object star systems, and star systems embedded in substructured clusters.\nIn both cases, we use initial conditions generated by population synthesis\nmodels of tidal downsizing.\n  The scattering simulations produce a wide range of eccentricities. The\nejection rate is around 25%. The ejecta mass distribution is similar to that\nfor all objects, with a velocity dispersion consistent with those produced by\nfull hydrodynamic simulations. The semimajor axis distribution after scattering\nextends to parsec scales.\n  In the cluster simulations, 13% of objects are ejected from their planetary\nsystem, and around 10% experience significant orbit modification. A small\nnumber of objects are recaptured on high eccentricity, high inclination orbits.\nThe velocity distribution of ejecta is similar to that produced by\nfragment-fragment scattering.\n  If fragment-fragment scattering and cluster stripping act together, then disc\nfragmentation should be efficient at producing free-floating substellar\nobjects, and hence characterising the free-floating planet population will\nprovide strong constraints on the frequency of disc fragmentation. \n\n"}

The Photoeccentric Effect for Planets of Various\n  Sizes Abstract: It is well-known that the light curve of a transiting planet contains\ninformation about the planet's orbital period and size relative to the host\nstar. More recently, it has been demonstrated that a tight constraint on an\nindividual planet's eccentricity can sometimes be derived from the light curve\nvia the \"photoeccentric effect,\" the effect of a planet's eccentricity on the\nshape and duration of its light curve. This has only been studied for large\nplanets and high signal-to-noise scenarios, raising the question of how well it\ncan be measured for smaller planets or low signal-to-noise cases. We explore\nthe limits of the photoeccentric effect over a wide range of planet parameters.\nThe method hinges upon measuring $g$ directly from the light curve, where $g$\nis the ratio of the planet's speed (projected on the plane of the sky) during\ntransit to the speed expected for a circular orbit. We find that when the\nsignal-to-noise in the measurement of $g$ is $< 10$, the ability to measure\neccentricity with the photoeccentric effect decreases. We develop a \"rule of\nthumb\" that for per-point relative photometric uncertainties $\\sigma = \\{\n10^{-3}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-5} \\}$, the critical values of planet-star radius ratio\nare $R_p / R_\\star \\approx \\{ 0.1, 0.05, 0.03 \\}$ for Kepler-like 30-minute\nintegration times.

The origin of these close-in\nsuper-Earths and mini-Neptunes is a major unanswered question in planet\nformation. Unlike Earth, whose atmosphere contains $<10^{-6}$ its total mass, a\nlarge fraction of close-in planets have significant gaseous envelopes,\ncontaining $1 -10\\%$ or more of their total mass. It has been proposed that\nthese close-in planets formed in situ either by delivery of $50-100M_{\\oplus}$\nof rocky material to the inner disc, or in a disc enhanced relative to the\nMMSN. In both cases, final assembly of the planets occurs by giant impacts\n(GIs). Here we test the viability of these scenarios. We show that atmospheres\naccreted by isolation masses are small ($10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ the core mass) and\nthat atmospheric mass-loss during GIs is significant, with typical post-GI\natmospheres that are $8 \\times 10^{-4}$ the core mass. Such values are\nconsistent with terrestrial planet atmospheres but more than an order of\nmagnitude below atmospheric masses of $1-10\\%$ inferred for many close-in\nexoplanets. In the most optimistic scenario with no core luminosity, post-GI\nenvelope accretion from a depleted gas disc yields atmospheric masses that are\nseveral per cent the core mass. If the gravitational potential energy due to\nthe last mass doubling of the planet by GIs is released over the disc\ndissipation time-scale as core luminosity, then envelope masses are reduced by\nabout an order of magnitude. Finally we show that radial drift time-scales due\nto gas drag for many isolation masses are shorter than typical disc lifetimes.\nGiven these challenges, we conclude that most observed close-in planets with\nenvelopes larger than several per cent likely formed at larger separations from\ntheir host stars. \n\n"}

These bodies have a resonant\nrotation. Most of the natural satellites rotate synchronously, showing the same\nhemisphere to their parent planet (1:1 spin-orbit resonance). The case of\nMercury is unique since its spin rate is exactly 1.5 its mean motion (3:2\nspin-orbit resonance). These two configurations are dynamical equilibria,\nreached after damping of the initial rotation of the relevant bodies. Thus, the\nrotation quantities are a signature of the interior, in particular of a\nputative global ocean. This manuscript divides into 3 parts. The first part is\ndevoted to the synchronous resonance. It presents different models of rotation\nfrom a fully rigid body to a one with a global subsurfacic ocean.

We collect these easily evaluated\nconstraints into a workflow that can help guide the design and interpretation\nof new observational campaigns and numerical simulations of gap opening in such\nsystems. We argue that the locations of resonances should be significantly\nshifted in massive disks like HL Tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in the\nexact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty in\nthe dynamical state and stability in such disks. This presents an important\nbarrier to using systems like HL Tau as a proxy for the initial conditions\nfollowing planet formation. An important observational avenue to breaking this\ndegeneracy is to search for eccentric gaps, which could implicate resonantly\ninteracting planets. Unfortunately, massive disks like HL Tau should induce\nswift pericenter precession that would smear out any such eccentric features of\nplanetary origin. This motivates pushing toward more typical, less massive\ndisks.

We\nprove through averaging that the potential secular eccentricity and inclination\nexcitation due to Yarkovsky drift can exceed that from Poynting-Robertson drag\nand radiation pressure by at least three orders of magnitude, possibly flinging\nasteroids which survive YORP spin-up into a widely dispersed cloud around the\nresulting white dwarf.

This gas envelope, if more massive\nthan a few percent of the core (with a mass below $10 M_\\oplus$), has a cooling\ntime that is much longer than the time-scale on which the planet exits the\ndisk. As such, it could not have contracted significantly from its original\nsize, of order the Bondi radius. So a newly exposed proto-planet would be\nlosing mass via a Parker wind that is catalyzed by the stellar continuum\nradiation. This represents an intermediate stage of mass-loss, occurring soon\nafter the disc has dispersed, but before the EUV/X-ray driven photoevaporation\nbecomes relevant. The surface mass-loss induces a mass movement within the\nenvelope that advects internal heat outward. As a result, the planet atmosphere\nrapidly cools down and contracts, until it has reached a radius of order $0.1$\nBondi radius, at which time the mass-loss effectively shuts down. Within a\nmillion years after the disk disperses, we find a planet that has only about\nten percent of its original envelope, and a Kelvin-Helmholtz time that is much\nlonger than its actual age.

Tidal dissipation in stellar\nconvective envelopes is a key actor that shapes the orbital architecture of\nshort-period systems. Our objective is to understand and evaluate how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of low-mass stars (from M to F types)\ndepends on their mass, evolutionary stage and rotation. Using a simplified\ntwo-layer assumption, we compute analytically the frequency-averaged tidal\ndissipation in their convective envelope. This dissipation is due to the\nconversion into heat of the kinetic energy of tidal non wave-like/equilibrium\nflow and inertial waves because of the viscous friction applied by turbulent\nconvection. Using grids of stellar models allows us to study the variation of\nthe dissipation as a function of stellar mass and age on the Pre-Main-Sequence\nand on the Main-Sequence for stars with masses spanning from $0.4$ to\n$1.4M_{\\odot}$.

In\ncombination with previous ALMA observations from Cycle 0 at 689GHz, we compare\nthe visibility profiles at the two frequencies and calculate the spectral index\n($\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}$). The observations of SR21 show a clear shift in the\nvisibility nulls, indicating radial variations of the inner edge of the cavity\nat the two wavelengths. Notable radial variations of the spectral index are\nalso detected for SR21 with values of $\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}{\\sim}3.8-4.2$ in the\ninner region ($r<35$ AU) and $\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}{\\sim}2.6-3.0$ outside. An\naxisymmetric ring (which we call the ring model) or a ring with the addition of\nan azimuthal Gaussian profile, for mimicking a vortex structure (which we call\nthe vortex model), is assumed for fitting the disk morphology. For SR21, the\nring model better fits the emission at 336GHz, conversely the vortex model\nbetter fits the 689GHz emission. For HD135344B, neither a significant shift in\nthe null of the visibilities nor radial variations of $\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}$ are\ndetected. Furthermore, for HD135344B, the vortex model fits both frequencies\nbetter than the ring model. However, the azimuthal extent of the vortex\nincreases with wavelength, contrary to model predictions for particle trapping\nby anticyclonic vortices. For both disks, the azimuthal variations of\n$\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}$ remain uncertain to confirm azimuthal trapping. The\ncomparison of the current data with a generic model of dust evolution that\nincludes planet-disk interaction suggests that particles in the outer disk of\nSR21 have grown to millimetre sizes and have accumulated in a radial pressure\nbump, whereas with the current resolution there is not clear evidence of radial\ntrapping in HD135344B, although it cannot be excluded either. \n\n"}

These candidates often require significant follow-up observations for\nvalidation, so prioritizing planets for habitability from transit data has\nbecome an important aspect of the search for life in the universe. We propose a\nmethod to compare transiting planets for their potential to support life based\non transit data, stellar properties and previously reported limits on planetary\nemitted flux. For a planet in radiative equilibrium, the emitted flux increases\nwith eccentricity, but decreases with albedo. As these parameters are often\nunconstrained, there is an \"eccentricity-albedo degeneracy\" for the\nhabitability of transiting exoplanets. Our method mitigates this degeneracy,\nincludes a penalty for large-radius planets, uses terrestrial mass-radius\nrelationships, and, when available, constraints on eccentricity to compute a\nnumber we call the \"habitability index for transiting exoplanets\" that\nrepresents the relative probability that an exoplanet could support liquid\nsurface water.

In primarily neutral regions, dust grains move as aerodynamic particles,\nnot necessarily with the gas. We therefore directly simulate, for the first\ntime, the behavior of aerodynamic grains in highly supersonic,\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence typical of MCs. We show that, under these\nconditions, grains with sizes a >0.01 micron exhibit dramatic (exceeding factor\n~1000) fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratio (implying large small-scale\nvariations in abundances, dust cooling rates, and dynamics). The dust can form\nhighly filamentary structures (which would be observed in both dust emission\nand extinction), which can be much thinner than the characteristic width of gas\nfilaments. Sometimes, the dust and gas filaments are not even in the same\nlocation. The 'clumping factor' of the dust (critical for dust\ngrowth/coagulation/shattering) can reach ~100, for grains in the ideal size\nrange. The dust clustering is maximized around scales ~0.2pc*(a/micron)*(100\ncm^-3/n_gas), and is 'averaged out' on larger scales. However, because the\ndensity varies widely in supersonic turbulence, the dynamic range of scales\n(and interesting grain sizes) for these fluctuations is much broader than in\nthe subsonic case. Our results are applicable to MCs of essentially all sizes\nand densities, but we note how Lorentz forces and other physics (neglected\nhere) may change them in some regimes.

We obtain the collision efficiency factor as the ratio of the\nnumerically-obtained collisional cross section to the planetesimal surface\narea, from which we obtain the growth timescales. Integrations are conducted in\nthe potential flow limit (steady, inviscid) and in the Stokes flow regime\n(steady, viscid). Only particles of stopping time $t_s \\ll t_X$ where\n$t_X\\approx10^3$ s experience aerodynamic deflection. Even in that case, the\nplanetesimal's gravity always ensures positive collision factors. The maximum\ngrowth timescale occurs typically at around $R\\approx100 \\ \\mathrm{km}$, but is\nless for colder disks, corresponding to interactions shifting to the Safronov\nfocusing regime. For particles $t_s \\gg t_X$ pebble accretion commences only\nafter this phase and is characterized by a steep drop in growth timescales.\nConsequently, at distances beyond ~10 AU sweepup growth timescales are always\nlonger than $10$ Myr, while in the inner disk (~<3 AU) the viability of the\nsweepup scenario is determined by the outcome of pebble-planetesimal collisions\nin the geometric regime.

Here, I provide a light curve of 1338 Johnson B-band\nmagnitudes from 1890 to 1989 taken from archival photographic plates at\nHarvard. KIC8462852 displays a secular dimming at an average rate of\n0.164+-0.013 magnitudes per century. From the early-1890s to the late-1980s,\nKIC8462852 faded by 0.193+-0.030 mag. The decline is not an artifact because\nnearby check stars have closely flat light curves. This century-long dimming is\nunprecedented for any F-type main sequence star. Thus the Harvard light curve\nprovides the first confirmation (past the several dips seen in the Kepler light\ncurve alone) that KIC8462852 has anything unusual. The century-long dimming and\nthe day-long dips are both just extreme ends of a spectrum of timescales for\nunique dimming events. By Ockham's Razor, two such unique and similar effects\nare very likely produced by one physical mechanism. This one mechanism does not\nappear as any isolated catastrophic event in the last century, but rather must\nbe some ongoing process with continuous effects. Within the context of\ndust-occultation models, the century-long dimming trend requires 10^4 to 10^7\ntimes as much dust as for the deepest Kepler dip. Within the context of the\ncomet-family idea, the century-long dimming trend requires an estimated 648,000\ngiant comets (each with 200 km diameter) all orchestrated to pass in front of\nthe star within the last century. \n\n"}

We present HARPS\nobservations of sunlight scattered off the bright asteroid 4/Vesta, from which\nwe deduced the Sun's activity-driven RV variations. In parallel, the HMI\ninstrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory provided us with simultaneous\nhigh spatial resolution magnetograms, Dopplergrams, and continuum images of the\nSun in the Fe I 6173A line.

The rms velocity amplitudes of these\ncontributions are 2.40 m/s and 0.41 m/s, respectively, which confirms that the\ninhibition of convection is the dominant source of activity-induced RV\nvariations at play, in accordance with previous studies.

Detection of such flash ionisation events will open\ninvestigations into the ionisation state and atmospheric dynamics.

We show that the majority of the observed Jupiter\npairs (twenty out of twenty-four) will be dynamically unstable if the inner\nplanet was placed at >~1AU distance from the stellar host. This finding is at\nodds with formation theories that invoke the migration of such planets from\nsemi-major axes >~1AU due to secular dynamical processes (e.g., secular chaos,\nLidov-Kozai oscillations) coupled with tidal dissipation. In fact, the results\nof N-body integrations show that the evolution of dynamically unstable systems\ndoes not lead to tidal migration but rather to planet ejections and collisions\nwith the host star.

It is widely believed that these planets formed near the\nwater-ice line of the protoplanetary disk, and subsequently migrated into much\nsmaller orbits. Most of the proposed migration mechanisms can be classified\neither as disk-driven migration, or as excitation of a very high eccentricity\nfollowed by tidal circularization. In the latter scenario, the giant planet\nthat is destined to become a hot Jupiter spends billions of years on a\nhighly-eccentric orbit, with apastron near the water-ice line. Eventually,\ntidal dissipation at periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbit. If this is\ncorrect, then it should be especially rare for hot Jupiters to be accompanied\nby another giant planet interior to the water-ice line. Using the current\nsample of giant planets discovered with the Doppler technique, we find that hot\nJupiters with P_orb < 10 days are no more or less likely to have exterior\nJupiter-mass companions than longer-period giant planets with P_orb >= 10 days.\nThis result holds for exterior companions both inside and outside of the\napproximate location of the water-ice line.

Therefore,\nin order to explain the observed large polarization of several L-dwarfs,\nrotation-induced oblateness or horizontally inhomogeneous cloud distribution in\nthe atmosphere is invoked. On the other hand, when an extra-solar planet of\nEarth-size or larger transits the brown dwarf along the line of sight, the\nasymmetry induced during the transit gives rise to a net non-zero, time\ndependent polarization. Employing atmospheric models for a range of effective\ntemperature and surface gravity appropriate for T- and L-dwarfs, I derive the\ntime dependent polarization profiles of these objects during transit phase and\nestimate the peak amplitude of polarization that occurs during the inner\ncontact points of the transit ingress/egress phase. It is found that peak\npolarization in the range of 0.2-1.0 % at I- and J-band may arise of cloudy L\ndwarfs occulted by Earth-size or larger exoplanets. Such an amount of\npolarization is higher than that can be produced by rotation-induced oblateness\nof even the rapidly rotating L-dwarfs. Hence, I suggest that time resolved\nimaging polarization should be a potential technique to detect transiting\nexoplanets around L-dwarfs. \n\n"}

Recent works\nshowed that this feature is caused by the interaction of the family with the\n$s-s_C$ nodal secular resonance with Ceres, that spreads the inclination of\nasteroids near its separatrix.

Almost simultaneous photometric\nobservations were carried out within the APACHE and EXORAP programs to\ncharacterize the stellar activity and to distinguish from the periodic signals\nthose due to activity and to the presence of planetary companions.

The analysis of spectral indices based on Ca II H & K and Halpha lines\ndemonstrates that the periods of 30.7 and 42.5 days are due to chromospheric\ninhomogeneities modulated by stellar rotation and differential rotation.

The results show that the\nvolatile prestellar fingerprint is modified by the chemistry en route into the\ndisc.

These gas atmospheres are thought to have\noriginated from the protoplanetary disk in which the planets were embedded\nduring their first few Myr. The accretion rate of gas from the surrounding\nnebula is determined by the ability of the gas to cool and radiate away its\ngravitational energy. Here we demonstrate that heat from the tidal interaction\nbetween the star and the young (and therefore inflated) planet can inhibit the\ngas cooling and accretion. Quantitatively, we find that the growth of\nsuper-Earth atmospheres halts for planets with periods of about 10 days,\nprovided that their initial eccentricities are of the order of 0.2. Thus, tidal\nheating provides a robust and simple mechanism that can simultaneously explain\nwhy these planets did not become gas giants and account for the deficit of\nlow-density planets closer to the star, where the tides are even stronger.

One possible origin for these asymmetries is dust\ntrapping in vortices formed at the edges of dead zones. We carry out\nhigh-resolution, two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of this scenario,\nincluding the effects of dust feedback. We find that, although feedback weakens\nthe vortices and slows down the process of dust accumulation, the dust\ndistribution in the disk can nonetheless remain asymmetric for many thousands\nof orbits. We show that even after $10^4$ orbits, or $2.5$ Myr when scaled to\nthe parameters of Oph IRS 48 (a significant fraction of its age), the dust is\nnot dispersed into an axisymmetric ring, in contrast to the case of a vortex\nformed by a planet. This is because accumulation of mass at the dead zone edge\nconstantly replenishes the vortex, preventing it from being fully destroyed. We\nproduce synthetic dust emission images using our simulation results. We find\nthat multiple small clumps of dust may be distributed azimuthally. These\nclumps, if not resolved from one another, appear as a single large feature. A\ndefining characteristic of a disk with a dead zone edge is that an asymmetric\nfeature is accompanied by a ring of dust located about twice as far from the\ncentral star. \n\n"}

Subsequent analysis showed that at ~1.5\nEarth radii there is a transition from a population of predominantly rocky\nsuper-Earths to non-rocky sub-Neptunes, which must have substantial volatile\nenvelopes. Determining the origin of these highly irradiated rocky planets will\nbe critical to our understanding of low-mass planet formation and the frequency\nof potentially habitable Earth-like planets. These short-period rocky\nsuper-Earths could simply be the stripped cores of sub-Neptunes, which have\nlost their envelopes due to atmospheric photo-evaporation or other processes,\nor they might instead be a separate population of inherently rocky planets,\nwhich never had significant envelopes. Using models of atmospheric\nphoto-evaporation, we show that if most bare rocky planets are the evaporated\ncores of sub-Neptunes then the transition radius should decrease as surveys\npush to longer orbital periods, since on wider orbits only planets with smaller\nless massive cores can be stripped.

In addition to the\ntransits of a planet in front of its star and the eclipses of the planet by its\nstar, researchers have reported flux variations at the orbital frequency and\nits harmonics: planetary reflection and/or emission and Doppler beaming of\nstarlight produce one peak per orbit, while ellipsoidal variations of a tidally\ndistorted star and/or planet produce two maxima per orbit. Researchers have\nalso reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital\nfrequency, sometimes much greater than the predictions of tidal theory. The\nreflected phase variations of a homogeneous planet contains power at even\norbital harmonics-important for studies of ellipsoidal variations-but cannot\ncontain odd orbital harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be\nproduced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet\nwith a North-South (N-S) asymmetric map. Either of these scenarios entail\nweather: short-period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and hence N-S\nsymmetric stellar forcing.

The results show a remarkable decline in the amplitude of\nthe rotational light curve and in the absolute magnitude. This suggests that\nthe angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight has changed\nnoticeably during the last 16 years as Bienor orbits the Sun. From the light\ncurve amplitude data we are able to determine the orientation of the rotation\naxis of Bienor ($\\beta_p=50\\pm3^{\\circ}$, $\\lambda_p=35\\pm8^{\\circ}$). We are\nalso able to constrain the $b/a$ axial ratio of a triaxial Jacobi ellipsoidal\nbody (with semi-axis $a>b>c$).

Abstract: High contrast imaging instruments such as GPI and SPHERE are discovering gap\nstructures in protoplanetary disks at an ever faster pace. Some of these gaps\nmay be opened by planets forming in the disks. In order to constrain planet\nformation models using disk observations, it is crucial to find a robust way to\nquantitatively back out the properties of the gap-opening planets, in\nparticular their masses, from the observed gap properties, such as their depths\nand widths. Combing 2D and 3D hydrodynamics simulations with 3D radiative\ntransfer simulations, we investigate the morphology of planet-opened gaps in\nnear-infrared scattered light images. Quantitatively, we obtain correlations\nthat directly link intrinsic gap depths and widths in the gas surface density\nto observed depths and widths in images of disks at modest inclinations under\nfinite angular resolution. Subsequently, the properties of the surface density\ngaps enable us to derive the disk scale height at the location of the gap $h$,\nand to constrain the quantity $M_{\\rm p}^2/\\alpha$, where $M_{\\rm p}$ is the\nmass of the gap-opening planet and $\\alpha$ characterizes the viscosity in the\ngap.

Detection of such substructures in combination with detailed modeling can\nhint at the presence of perturbing planetary bodies, or reveal other mechanisms\nacting to replenish gas and dust reservoirs and forming structures such as\nspirals or rings.

Our numerical hydrodynamic simulations confirm previous\nanalytical results on the dependence of the warp structure on the viscosity and\nthe initial misalignment between the binary and the disc. To study the\nobservational signatures of warps we calculate images in the continuum at\nnear-infrared and sub-millimetre wavelengths and in the pure rotational\ntransition of CO in the sub-millimetre. Warped circumbinary discs show surface\nbrightness asymmetry in near-infrared scattered light images as well as in\noptically thick gas lines at sub-millimetre wavelengths. The asymmetry is\ncaused by self-shadowing of the disc by the inner warped regions, thus the\nstrength of the asymmetry depends on the strength of the warp.

Transits of this object would have depths of >0.1% and are\ndefinitively ruled out.

This paper motivates\nfinding both types of three-body system by calculating analytic and numerical\nprobabilities for all transit configurations, accounting for any mutual\ninclination and orbital precession.

MASCARA\nconsists of one northern station on La Palma, Canary Islands (fully operational\nsince February 2015), one southern station at La Silla Observatory, Chile\n(operational from early 2017), and a data centre at Leiden Observatory in the\nNetherlands.

Algorithms like the Trend Filtering\nAlgorithm (TFA) use simultaneously-observed stars to remove systematic effects,\nand binning is used to reduce high-frequency random noise. We present TFAW, a\nwavelet-based modified version of TFA. TFAW aims to increase the periodic\nsignal detection and to return a detrended and denoised signal without\nmodifying its intrinsic characteristics. We modify TFA's frequency analysis\nstep adding a Stationary Wavelet Transform filter to perform an initial noise\nand outlier removal and increase the detection of variable signals. A wavelet\nfilter is added to TFA's signal reconstruction to perform an adaptive\ncharacterization of the noise- and trend-free signal and the noise contribution\nat each iteration while preserving astrophysical signals. We carried out tests\nover simulated sinusoidal and transit-like signals to assess the effectiveness\nof the method and applied TFAW to real light curves from TFRM. We also studied\nTFAW's application to simulated multiperiodic signals, improving their\ncharacterization. TFAW improves the signal detection rate by increasing the\nsignal detection efficiency (SDE) up to a factor ~2.5x for low SNR light\ncurves. For simulated transits, the transit detection rate improves by a factor\n~2-5x in the low-SNR regime compared to TFA.

The comet is suggested\nto have approached Jupiter to 0.005 AU on -2251 November 7, in general\nconformity with Marsden's (1999) proposal of a Jovian encounter nearly 4300 yr\nago. The variations of sizable nongravitational effects with heliocentric\ndistance correlate with the evolution of outgassing, asymmetric relative to\nperihelion. The future orbital period will shorten to ~1000 yr because of\norbital-cascade resonance effects. We find that the sublimation curves of\nparent molecules are fitted with the type of a law used for the\nnongravitational acceleration, determine their orbit-integrated mass loss, and\nconclude that the share of water ice was at most 57%, and possibly less than\n50%, of the total outgassed mass.

An evolutionary classification of disks was\nproposed based on their IR spectral energy distribution, with the Group I\nsources showing a prominent cold component ascribed to an earlier stage of\nevolution than Group II.

A first attempt of disk taxonomy is now\npossible thanks to the increasing number of high-resolution images of Herbig\nAe/Be stars becoming available.

The stars are surrounded by a\ndebris disk which displays a ring-like morphology and strong asymmetries at\nmultiple scales. We aim at studying the likelihood of a scenario where the\nplanet formed closer to the stars in the disk, underwent inward disk-induced\nmigration, and got scattered away by the binary star before being stabilized by\na close encounter (fly-by). We performed semi-analytical calculations and\nnumerical simulations (Swift_HJS package) to model the interactions between the\nplanet and the two stars. We accounted for the migration as a simple force. We\nstudied the LCC kinematics to set constraints on the local density of stars,\nand therefore on the fly-by likelihood. We performed N-body simulations to\ndetermine the effects of the planet trajectories (ejection and secular effects)\nonto the disk morphology. The combination of the migration and mean-motion\nresonances with the binary star (often 1:6) can eject the planet. Nonetheless,\nwe estimate that the fly-by hypothesis decreases the scenario probability to\nless than $10^{-7}$ for a derived local density of stars of 0.11\nstars/pc$^{3}$. We show that the concomitant effect of the planet and stars\ntrajectories induce spiral-features in the disk which may correspond to the\nobserved asymmetries. Moreover, the present disk shape suggests that the planet\nis on an eccentric orbit. The scenario we explored is a natural hypothesis if\nthe planet formed within a disk.

Traditionally, super-stellar elemental abundances in giant\nplanets were thought to be possible due to accretion of metal-rich solids. Such\nenrichments are accompanied by oxygen-rich compositions (i.e. C/O below the\ndisc's value, assumed to be solar, C/O=0.54). Without solid accretion the\nplanets are expected to have sub-solar metallicity, but high C/O ratios. This\narises because the solids are dominated by oxygen-rich species, e.g. H$_2$O and\nCO$_2$, which freeze out in the disk earlier than CO, leaving the gas metal\npoor but carbon-rich. Here we demonstrate that super-solar metallicities can be\nachieved by gas accretion alone when growth and radial drift of pebbles are\nconsidered in protoplanetary discs. Through this mechanism planets may\nsimultaneously acquire super-solar metallicities and super-solar C/O ratios.\nThis happens because the pebbles transport volatile species inward as they\nmigrate through the disc, enriching the gas at snow lines where the volatiles\nsublimate. Furthermore, the planet's composition can be used to constrain where\nit formed. Since high C/H and C/O ratios cannot be created by accreting solids,\nit may be possible to distinguish between formation via pebble accretion and\nplanetesimal accretion by the level of solid enrichment. Finally, we expect\nthat Jupiter's C/O ratio should be near or above solar if its enhanced carbon\nabundance came through accreting metal rich gas. Thus Juno's measurement of\nJupiter's C/O ratio should determine whether Jupiter accreted its metals from\ncarbon rich gas or oxygen rich solids. \n\n"}

We quantify how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of rotating low-mass stars evolves from\nthe pre-main sequence up to the red-giant branch depending on the initial\nstellar mass.

In addition, we generalize the\nwork of Bolmont & Mathis (2016) by following the orbital evolution of close-in\nplanets using the new tidal dissipation predictions for advanced phases of\nstellar evolution. On the PMS the evolution of tidal dissipation is controlled\nby the evolution of the internal structure of the contracting star. On the MS\nit is strongly driven by the variation of surface rotation that is impacted by\nmagnetized stellar winds braking.

Such an ``evaporation-valley' had been predicted by numerical models\npreviously.

The timescale falls for envelopes\nlighter than this because the planet's radius remains largely constant for\ntenuous envelopes. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the\nplanet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation,\ntherefore, herds planets into either bare cores ~1.3 Rearth, or those with\ndouble the core's radius (~2.6 Rearth). This process mostly occurs during the\nfirst 100 Myrs when the stars' high energy flux are high and nearly constant.\nThe observed radius distribution further requires that the Kepler planets are\nclustered around 3 Mearth in mass, are born with H/He envelopes more than a few\npercent in mass, and that their cores are similar to the Earth in composition.\nSuch envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks,\nwhile the core composition indicates formation inside the ice-line. Lastly, the\nphotoevaporation model fails to account for bare planets beyond ~30-60 days, if\nthese planets are abundant, they may point to a significant second channel for\nplanet formation, resembling the Solar-System terrestrial planets. \n\n"}

Various atomic and\nmolecular species, such as Na, CO, H2O have been already detected. Molecular\nspecies have been observed only in the near-infrared while atomic species have\nbeen observed in the visible. In particular, the detection and abundance\ndetermination of water vapor bring important constraints to the planet\nformation process. We search for water vapor in the atmosphere of the exoplanet\nHD189733b using a high-resolution transmission spectrum in the visible obtained\nwith HARPS. We use Molecfit to correct for telluric absorption features. Then\nwe compute the high-resolution transmission spectrum of the planet using 3\ntransit datasets. We finally search for water vapor absorption using a\ncross-correlation technique that combines the signal of 800 individual lines.\nTelluric features are corrected to the noise level. We place a 5-sigma upper\nlimit of 100 ppm on the strength of the 6500 A water vapor band. The 1-sigma\nprecision of 20 ppm on the transmission spectrum demonstrates that space-like\nsensitivity can be achieved from the ground. This approach opens new\nperspectives to detect various atomic and molecular species with future\ninstruments such as ESPRESSO at the VLT. Extrapolating from our results, we\nshow that only 1 transit with ESPRESSO would be sufficient to detect water\nvapor on HD189733b-like hot Jupiter with a cloud-free atmosphere. Upcoming\nnear-IR spectrographs will be even more efficient and sensitive to a wider\nrange of molecular species. Moreover, the detection of the same molecular\nspecies in different bands (e.g. visible and IR) is key to constrain the\nstructure and composition of the atmosphere, such as the presence of Rayleigh\nscattering or aerosols. \n\n"}

We find that\nthe population-wide imprints like the location of the \"evaporation valley\" in\nthe distance-radius plane and the corresponding bimodal radius distribution\nclearly differ depending on the bulk composition of the cores. Comparison with\nthe observed position of the valley (Fulton et al. 2017) suggests that close-in\nlow-mass Kepler planets have a predominately Earth-like rocky composition.\nCombined with the excess of period ratios outside of MMR, this suggests that\nlow-mass Kepler planets formed inside of the water iceline, but still\nundergoing orbital migration. The core radius becomes visible for planets\nlosing all primordial H/He. For planets in this \"triangle of evaporation\" in\nthe distance-radius plane, the degeneracy in compositions is reduced. In the\nobserved diagram, we identify a trend to more volatile-rich compositions with\nincreasing radius (R/R_Earth<1.6 rocky; 1.6-3.0 ices and/or H/He; >3: H/He).\nThe mass-density diagram contains important information about formation and\nevolution.

We present a mechanism\nthat causes such a spin-orbit misalignment for a protoplanetary disc due to its\nmovement through an ambient medium. Our physical explanation of the mechanism\nis based on the theoretical solutions to the Stark problem. We test this idea\nby performing self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations and simplified\ngravitational $N$-body simulations. The $N$-body model reduces the mechanism to\nthe relevant physical processes. The hydrodynamical simulations show the\nmechanism in its full extent, including gas-dynamical and viscous processes in\nthe disc which are not included in the theoretical framework. We find that a\nprotoplanetary disc embedded in a flow changes its orientation as its angular\nmomentum vector tends to align parallel to the relative velocity vector. Due to\nthe force exerted by the flow, orbits in the disc become eccentric, which\nproduces a net torque and consequentially changes the orbital inclination. The\ntilting of the disc causes it to contract. Apart from becoming lopsided, the\ngaseous disc also forms a spiral arm even if the inclination does not change\nsubstantially. The process is most effective at high velocities and\nobservational signatures are therefore mostly expected in massive star-forming\nregions and around winds or supernova ejecta.

Here we investigate,\nfirstly, whether there is a correlation between the size of starspots - assumed\nto be related to the amplitude of the sinusoid - and their decay timescale and,\nsecondly, whether any such correlation depends on the stellar effective\ntemperature. To determine this, we computed the autocorrelation functions of\nthe light curves of samples of stars from Kepler and fitted them with apodised\nperiodic functions. The light curve amplitudes, representing spot size were\nmeasured from the root-mean-squared scatter of the normalised light curves. We\nused a Monte Carlo Markov Chain to measure the periods and decay timescales of\nthe light curves. The results show a correlation between the decay time of\nstarspots and their inferred size. The decay time also depends strongly on the\ntemperature of the star. Cooler stars have spots that last much longer, in\nparticular for stars with longer rotational periods. This is consistent with\ncurrent theories of diffusive mechanisms causing starspot decay.

The pebble accretion theory is built upon the orbit\ntheory of dust particles in a laminar protoplanetary disk (PPD). For\nsufficiently large core mass (in the \"Hill regime\"), essentially all particles\nof appropriate sizes entering the Hill sphere can be captured. However, the\nouter regions of PPDs are expected to be weakly turbulent due to the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI), where turbulent stirring of particle\norbits may affect the efficiency of pebble accretion. We conduct shearing-box\nsimulations of pebble accretion with different levels of MRI turbulence\n(strongly turbulent assuming ideal magnetohydrodynamics, weakly turbulent in\nthe presence of ambipolar diffusion, and laminar) and different core masses to\ntest the efficiency of pebble accretion at a microphysical level. We find that\naccretion remains efficient for marginally coupled particles (dimensionless\nstopping time tau_s ~ 0.1 - 1) even in the presence of strong MRI turbulence.\nThough more dust particles are brought toward the core by the turbulence, this\neffect is largely canceled by a reduction in accretion probability.

First, we observe that\nthe inflation of planets below about $M=0.5 \\;\\rm{M}_\\rm{J}$ appears very\ndifferent than their higher mass counterparts, perhaps as the result of mass\nloss or an inefficient heating mechanism.

Phase curves of the\nplanets in thermal emission provide clues to this question, because a\nsubstantial atmosphere would transport heat more efficiently than a bare-rock\nsurface. Analyzing phase curve photometric data around secondary eclipse has\npreviously been used to study energy transport in the atmospheres of hot\nJupiters. Here we use phase curve, Spitzer time-series photometry to study the\nthermal emission properties of the super-Earth exoplanet 55 Cancri e. We\nutilize a semi-analytical framework to fit a physical model to the infrared\nphotometric data at 4.5 micron. The model uses parameters of planetary\nproperties including Bond albedo, heat redistribution efficiency (i.e., ratio\nbetween radiative timescale and advective timescale of the atmosphere), and\natmospheric greenhouse factor. The phase curve of 55 Cancri e is dominated by\nthermal emission with an eastward-shifted hot spot. We determine the heat\nredistribution efficiency to be ~1.47, which implies that the advective\ntimescale is on the same order as the radiative timescale. This requirement\ncannot be met by the bare-rock planet scenario because heat transport by\ncurrents of molten lava would be too slow. The phase curve thus favors the\nscenario with a substantial atmosphere. Our constraints on the heat\nredistribution efficiency translate to an atmospheric pressure of ~1.4 bar.

As part of this analysis, we develop a new variant of pixel level\ndecorrelation that is effective at removing intrapixel sensitivity variations\nfor long observations (>10 hours) where the position of the star can vary by a\nsignificant fraction of a pixel. Using this algorithm, we measure eclipse\ndepths, phase amplitudes, and phase offsets for both planets at 3.6 $\\mu m$ and\n4.5 $\\mu m$. We use a simple toy model to show that WASP-33b's phase offset,\nalbedo, and heat recirculation efficiency are largely similar to those of other\nhot Jupiters despite its very high irradiation. On the other hand, our fits for\nHD 149026b prefer a very high albedo and an unusually high recirculation\nefficiency. We also compare our results to predictions from general circulation\nmodels, and find that while neither are a good match to the data, the\ndiscrepancies for HD 149026b are especially large.

We then place these two planets in a broader context\nby exploring relationships between the temperatures, albedos, heat transport\nefficiencies, and phase offsets of all planets with published thermal phase\ncurves. We find a striking relationship between phase offset and irradiation\ntemperature--the former drops with increasing temperature until around 3400 K,\nand rises thereafter.

Several\nrecent studies have shown that a planet with a mass of about 10 Earth masses on\na distant eccentric orbit with perihelion far beyond the Kuiper belt could\ncreate and maintain this clustering. The evolutionary path resulting in an\norbit such as the one suggested for Planet Nine is nevertheless not easily\nexplained. Here we investigate whether a planet scattered away from the\ngiant-planet region could be lifted to an orbit similar to the one suggested\nfor Planet Nine through dynamical friction with a cold, distant planetesimal\nbelt. Recent simulations of planetesimal formation via the streaming\ninstability suggest that planetesimals can readily form beyond 100au. We\nexplore this circularisation by dynamical friction with a set of numerical\nsimulations.

If these discs are prone to\nfragmentation, then they are able to rapidly form objects that are initially of\nseveral Jupiter masses and larger. The fate of these disc fragments (and the\nfate of planetary bodies formed afterwards via core accretion) depends\nsensitively not only on the fragment's interaction with the disc, but with its\nneighbouring fragments.\n  We return to and revise our population synthesis model of self-gravitating\ndisc fragmentation and tidal downsizing. Amongst other improvements, the model\nnow directly incorporates fragment-fragment interactions while the disc is\nstill present. We find that fragment-fragment scattering dominates the orbital\nevolution, even when we enforce rapid migration and inefficient gap formation.\n  Compared to our previous model, we see a small increase in the number of\nterrestrial-type objects being formed, although their survival under tidal\nevolution is at best unclear.

However, most BHs in merging BHBs have masses <40 Msun.\nWe find merging BHBs with mass ratios in the 0.1 - 1.0 range, even if mass\nratios >0.6 are more likely.

There is also growing evidence that disk winds drive accretion in such\ndisks. We show through 2D (axisymmetric) simulations that rings and gaps\ndevelop naturally in magnetically coupled disk-wind systems on the scale of\ntens of au, where ambipolar diffusion (AD) is the dominant non-ideal MHD\neffect. In simulations where the magnetic field and matter are moderately\ncoupled, the disk remains relatively laminar with the radial electric current\nsteepened by AD into a thin layer near the midplane. The toroidal magnetic\nfield sharply reverses polarity in this layer, generating a large magnetic\ntorque that drives fast accretion, which drags the poloidal field into a highly\npinched radial configuration. The reconnection of this pinched field creates\nmagnetic loops where the net poloidal magnetic flux (and thus the accretion\nrate) is reduced, yielding dense rings. Neighbouring regions with stronger\npoloidal magnetic fields accrete faster, forming gaps. In better magnetically\ncoupled simulations, the so-called `avalanche accretion streams' develop\ncontinuously near the disk surface, rendering the disk-wind system more\nchaotic. Nevertheless, prominent rings and gaps are still produced, at least in\npart, by reconnection, which again enables the segregation of the poloidal\nfield and the disk material similar to the more diffusive disks. However, the\nreconnection is now driven by the non-linear growth of MRI channel flows. The\nformation of rings and gaps in rapidly accreting yet laminar disks has\ninteresting implications for dust settling and trapping, grain growth, and\nplanet formation. \n\n"}

Among the\nspiral-triggering mechanisms proposed, only one establishes a causal link\nbetween shadows and spirals so far. In fact, provided the presence of shadows\nin the disc, the combined effect of temperature gradient and differential disc\nrotation, creates strong azimuthal pressure gradients. After several thousand\nyears, grand-design spirals develop in the gas phase. Previous works have only\nconsidered static shadows caused by an inclined inner disc. However, in some\ncases, the inner regions of circumbinary discs can break and precess. Thus, it\nis more realistic to consider moving shadow patterns in the disc. In this\nconfiguration, the intersection between the inner and the outer discs defines\nthe line of nodes at which the shadows are cast. Here, we consider moving\nshadows and study the resulting circumbinary disc structure. We find that only\nstatic and prograde shadows trigger spirals, in contrast to retrograde ones.\nInterestingly, if a region of the disc corotates with the shadow, a planet-like\nsignature develops at the co-rotation position.

The observed variability of asymmetric,\ndouble-peaked emission line profiles in about half of such systems could be\ninterpreted as the signature of precession of an eccentric gaseous debris disk.\nThe variability timescales --- from decades down to $1.4$ yr (recently inferred\nfor the debris disk around HE 1349--2305) --- are in rough agreement with the\nrate of general relativistic (GR) precession in the test particle limit.\nHowever, it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can drive such a\nfast, coherent precession of a radially extended (out to $1 R_\\odot$) gaseous\ndisk mediated by internal stresses (pressure). Here we use the linear theory of\neccentricity evolution in hydrodynamic disks to determine several key\nproperties of eccentric modes in gaseous debris disks around WDs. We find a\ncritical dependence of both the precession period and radial eccentricity\ndistribution of the modes on the inner disk radius, $r_\\mathrm{in}$.

One of the observable\ntests for migration theories is the current value of the angle between the\nstellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane, called the obliquity. After the\nmain migration mechanism has ended, the obliquity and the semi-major axis keep\non evolving due to the combined effects of tides and magnetic braking. The\nobserved correlation between effective temperature and measured projected\nobliquity in known short-period systems has been taken as evidence of such\nmechanisms being at play. Our aim is to produce an improved model for the tidal\nevolution of the obliquity, including all the components of the dynamical tide\nfor circular misaligned systems. This model takes into account the strong\nvariations in structure and rotation of stars during their evolution, and their\nconsequences for the efficiency of tidal dissipation. We use an analytical\nformulation for the frequency-averaged dissipation in convective layers for\neach mode, depending only on global stellar parameters and rotation. For\ntypical hot-Jupiters orbital configurations, the obliquity is generally damped\non a much shorter timescale than the semi-major axis. The final outcome of\ntidal evolution is also very sensitive to the initial conditions, with\nJupiter-mass planets being either quickly destroyed or brought on more distant\norbit, depending on the initial ratio of planetary orbital momentum to stellar\nspin momentum. However we find that everything else being the same, the\nevolution of the obliquity around low-mass stars with a thin convective zone is\nnot slower than around those with a thicker convective zone. On the contrary,\nwe find that more massive stars, remaining faster rotator throughout their\nmain-sequence, produce more efficient dissipation. \n\n"}

We find that\nthe protoplanet initially migrates inwards rapidly, until it opens up a gap in\nthe disc.

Outward migration occurs when the\nprotoplanet resides within a gap with gravitationally unstable edges, as a high\nfraction of the accreted gas is high angular momentum gas from outside the\nprotoplanet's orbit. The effect of radiative heating from the protoplanet is\ncritical in determining the direction of the migration and the eccentricity of\nthe protoplanet. Gap opening is facilitated by efficient cooling that may not\nbe captured by the commonly used beta-cooling approximation. The protoplanet\ninitially accretes at a high rate (1e-3Mj/yr), and its accretion luminosity\ncould be a few tenths of the host star's luminosity, making the protoplanet\neasily observable (albeit only for a short time).

These planets,\nknown as ultra-short-period (USP) planets, are unlikely to have attained their\norbits in situ. Instead, they must have migrated in. Here we propose that these\nplanets reach their current orbits by high-eccentricity migration. In a\nscaled-down version of the dynamics that may have been experienced by their\nhigh mass analog, the hot Jupiters, these planets reach high eccentricities via\nchaotic secular interactions with their companion planets and then undergo\norbital circularization due to dissipation of tides raised on the planet. This\nproposal is motivated by the following observations: planetary systems observed\nby Kepler often contain several super-Earths with non-negligible eccentricities\nand inclinations, and possibly extending beyond AU distances; while only a\nsmall fraction of USP planets have known transiting companions, and none\nclosely spaced, we argue that most of them should have companions at periods of\n~10-50 days. The outer sibling planets, through secular chaos, can remove\nangular momentum from the inner most planet, originally at periods of ~5-10\ndays. When the latter reaches an eccentricity higher than 0.8, it is tidally\ncaptured by the central star and becomes an USP planet. This scenario naturally\nexplains the observation that most USP planets have significantly more distant\ntransiting companions compared to their counterparts at slightly longer periods\n(1-3 days), a feature un-accounted for in other proposed scenarios. Our model\nalso predicts that USP planets should have: (i) spin-orbit angles, and\ninclinations relative to outer planets, in the range of ~10-50 degrees; (ii)\nseveral outer planetary companions extending to beyond AU distances, both of\nwhich may be tested by TESS and its follow-up observations. \n\n"}

All of these characteristics are consistent\nwith models of self-scattering of submillimeter-wave emission from an optically\nthin inclined disk. The distribution of the polarization position angles across\nthe disk reveals that while the average orientation is along the minor axis,\nthe polarization orientations show a significant spread in angles; this can\nalso be explained by models of pure scattering.

The\nformula depends on the binary fraction; the mass function of the secondary\nstars; and the true occurrence of planets around primaries, secondaries, and\nsingle stars.

Most of them have weaker than expected spectral features\nin the $1.1-1.7\\mu m$ bandpass probed by HST/WFC3 but stronger spectral\nfeatures at longer wavelengths probed by Spitzer. This led previous authors to\npuzzling conclusions about the thermal structures and chemical abundances of\nthese planets. Using the SPARC/MITgcm, we investigate how thermal dissociation,\nionization, H$^-$ opacity and clouds shape the thermal structures and spectral\nproperties of ultra hot Jupiters with a special focus on WASP-121b. We expand\nour findings to the whole population of ultra hot Jupiters through analytical\nquantification of the thermal dissociation and its influence on the strength of\nspectral features.\n  We predict that most molecules are thermally dissociated and alkalies are\nionized in the dayside photospheres of ultra hot Jupiters. This includes\nH$_{\\rm 2}$O, TiO, VO, and H$_{\\rm 2}$ but not CO, which has a stronger\nmolecular bond. The vertical molecular gradient created by the dissociation\nsignificantly weakens the spectral features from water while the $4.5\\mu m$ CO\nfeature remain unchanged. The water band in the HST/WFC3 bandpass is further\nweakened by H$^-$ continuum opacity. Molecules are expected to recombine before\nreaching the limb, leading to order of magnitude variations of the chemical\ncomposition and cloud coverage between the limb and the dayside. Overall,\nmolecular dissociation provides a qualitative understanding of the lack of\nstrong spectral feature of water in the $1-2\\mu m$ bandpass observed in most\nultra hot Jupiters. Quantitatively, however, our model does not provide a\nsatisfactory match to the WASP-121b emission spectrum. Together with WASP-33b\nand Kepler-33Ab, they seem the outliers among the population of ultra hot\nJupiters in need of a more thorough understanding. \n\n"}

We attempt to\ndefinitively discriminate the nature of the RV variations for the young active\nK5 star BD+20 1790, for which visible (VIS) RV measurements show divergent\nresults on the existence of a substellar companion. Methods. We compare VIS\ndata with high precision RVs in the near infrared (NIR) range by using the\nGIANO - B and IGRINS spectrographs. In addition, we present for the first time\nsimultaneous VIS-NIR observations obtained with GIARPS (GIANO - B and HARPS -\nN) at Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). Orbital RVs are achromatic, so the RV\namplitude does not change at different wavelengths, while stellar activity\ninduces wavelength-dependent RV variations, which are significantly reduced in\nthe NIR range with respect to the VIS. Results. The NIR radial velocity\nmeasurements from GIANO - B and IGRINS show an average amplitude of about one\nquarter with respect to previously published VIS data, as expected when the RV\njitter is due to stellar activity. Coeval multi-band photometry surprisingly\nshows larger amplitudes in the NIR range, explainable with a mixture of cool\nand hot spots in the same active region. Conclusions. In this work, the claimed\nmassive planet around BD+20 1790 is ruled out by our data.

Previously, we measured stellar radii to 11%\nprecision using high-resolution spectroscopy; by adding Gaia astrometry, the\nerrors are now 2%.

With a catalog of ~1000 planets with precise properties, we probed\nin fine detail the gap in the planet size distribution that separates two\nclasses of small planets, rocky super-Earths and gas-dominated sub-Neptunes.\nOur previous study and others suggested that the gap may be observationally\nunder-resolved and inherently flat-bottomed, with a band of forbidden planet\nsizes. Analysis based on our new catalog refutes this; the gap is partially\nfilled in. Two other important factors that sculpt the distribution are a\nplanet's orbital distance and its host star mass, both of which are related to\na planet's X-ray/UV irradiation history.

We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations of single giant planets, and predict the emergent intensity field\nwith radiative transfer. Pressure gradients at planet-carved gaps, spiral wakes\nand vortices bear strong kinematic counterparts.

Technological advances could soon make an exomoon\ndiscovery with Kepler or the upcoming CHEOPS and PLATO space missions possible.\nExomoon climates might be substantially different from exoplanet climates\nbecause the day-night cycles on moons are determined by the moon's synchronous\nrotation with its host planet. Moreover, planetary illumination at the top of\nthe moon's atmosphere and tidal heating at the moon's surface can be\nsubstantial, which can affect the redistribution of energy on exomoons.

Assuming that the disc's accretion onto\nthe star is the main process that clears the disc, the atmosphere of the star\nwill show abundance reductions caused by the material accreted by the forming\nplanet(s). If planets are only forming around one star of a binary system, the\nplanet formation process can result in abundance differences in wide binary\nstars, if their natal protoplanetary discs do not interact during planet\nformation. Abundance differences in the atmospheres of wide binaries hosting\ngiant planets have already been observed and linked to the formation location\nof giant planets.

Perhaps the most\nchallenging property to measure is stellar age. Once on the main sequence, M\ndwarfs change imperceptibly in their temperature and luminosity, necessitating\nnovel statistical techniques for estimating their ages. In this paper, we infer\nages for known eccentric-planet-hosting M dwarfs using a combination of\nkinematics and $\\alpha$-element-enrichment, both shown to correlate with age\nfor Sun-like FGK stars. We calibrate our method on FGK stars in a Bayesian\ncontext. To measure $\\alpha$-enrichment, we use publicly-available spectra from\nthe CARMENES exoplanet survey and a recently developed [Ti/Fe] calibration\nutilizing individual Ti I and Fe I absorption lines in $Y$ band. Tidal effects\nare expected to circularize the orbits of short-period planets on short\ntimescales; however, we find a number of mildly eccentric, close-in planets\norbiting old ($\\sim$8 Gyr) stars. For these systems, we use our ages to\nconstrain the tidal dissipation parameter of the planets, $Q_\\mathrm{p}$. For\ntwo mini-Neptune planets, GJ 176b and GJ 536b, we find they have $Q_\\mathrm{p}$\nvalues more similar to the ice giants than the terrestrial planets in our Solar\nSystem.

Our primary findings\nare that the solid core masses of planets are higher around higher metallicity\nstars and that these more massive cores were able to accrete larger gas\nenvelopes. Furthermore, investigating the recently reported result that planets\nwith radii in the range (2-6Rearth) are more common at short periods around\nhigher metallicity stars in detail, we find that the average host star\nmetallicity of H/He atmosphere-hosting planets increases smoothly inside an\norbital period of ~20 days. We interpret the location of the metallicity\nincrease within the context of atmospheric photoevaporation: higher metallicity\nstars are likely to host planets with higher atmospheric metallicity, which\nincreases the cooling in the photoevaporative outflow, lowering the mass-loss\nrates. Therefore, planets with higher metallicity atmospheres are able to\nresist photoevaporation at shorter orbital periods.

These observations raise critical\nquestions about the fundamental nature of the circulation, its time\nvariability, and the overall relationship to the circulation on Jupiter and\nSaturn. Jupiter and Saturn themselves exhibit numerous robust zonal (east-west)\njet streams at the cloud level; moreover, both planets exhibit long-term\nstratospheric oscillations involving perturbations of zonal wind and\ntemperature that propagate downward over time on timescales of ~4 years\n(Jupiter) and ~15 years (Saturn). These oscillations, dubbed the Quasi\nQuadrennial Oscillation (QQO) for Jupiter and the Semi-Annual Oscillation (SAO)\non Saturn, are thought to be analogous to the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO)\non Earth, which is driven by upward propagation of equatorial waves from the\ntroposphere. To investigate these issues, we here present global,\nthree-dimensional, high-resolution numerical simulations of the flow in the\nstratified atmosphere--overlying the convective interior--of brown dwarfs and\nJupiter-like planets. The effect of interior convection is parameterized by\ninducing small-scale, randomly varying perturbations in the\nradiative-convective boundary at the base of the model.

These exospheres are formed by surface\nparticles that have been sputtered by the wind of the host star. The stellar\nwind properties are derived from magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which are\ndriven by observationally-derived stellar magnetic field maps, and constrained\nby Ly-alpha observations of wind mass-loss rates, making this one of the most\nwell constrained model of winds of low-mass stars. The proximity of the planets\nto their host star implies a high flux of incident stellar wind particles, thus\nthe sputtering process is sufficiently effective to build up relatively dense,\nrefractory-rich exospheres. The sputtering releases refractory elements from\nthe entire dayside surfaces of the planets, with elements such as O and Mg\ncreating an extended neutral exosphere with densities larger than 10/cm3,\nextending to several planetary radii.

For that sub-sample,\nwe derive temperatures ranging from $2,870$ to $4,187$ K, radii of $0.09-0.83$\n$R_{\\odot}$, luminosities of $-2.67<log L/L_{\\odot}<-0.67$ and [Fe/H]\nmetallicities between $-0.49$ and $0.83$ dex.

We report 33 exoplanet candidates with orbital\nperiods ranging from 0.19 to 21.16 days, and median radii and equilibrium\ntemperatures of 2.3 $R_{\\oplus}$ and 986 K, respectively. Using planet\nmass-radius relationships from the literature, we identify 7 exoplanets as\npotentially rocky, although we conclude that probably none reside in the\nhabitable zone of their parent stars. \n\n"}

The origin of such\nstructures is in debate. Recently, we documented how one super-Earth planet can\nopen multiple (up to five) dust gaps in a disk with low viscosity\n($\\alpha\\lesssim10^{-4}$). In this paper, we examine how the positions, depths,\nand total number of gaps opened by one planet depend on input parameters, and\napply our results to real systems. Gap locations (equivalently, spacings) are\nthe easiest metric to use when making comparisons between theory and\nobservations, as positions can be robustly measured. We fit the locations of\ngaps empirically as functions of planet mass and disk aspect ratio. We find\nthat the locations of the double gaps in HL Tau and TW Hya, and of all three\ngaps in HD 163296, are consistent with being opened by a sub-Saturn mass\nplanet. This scenario predicts the locations of other gaps in HL Tau and TW\nHya, some of which appear consistent with current observations. We also show\nhow the Rossby wave instability may develop at the edges of several gaps and\nresult in multiple dusty vortices, all caused by one planet. A planet as low in\nmass as Mars may produce multiple dust gaps in the terrestrial planet forming\nregion. \n\n"}

Such a state defies available proposals for\nlarge eccentricities. We argue that it is instead uniquely produced by a\ndecaying protoplanetary disk. When the disk was massive, its precessional\neffect on the planets forced the two apses to center around an anti-aligned\nstate. And as the disk is gradually eroded, the pair of planets are\nadiabatically transported to a new state where most of the eccentricity (or\nrather, the angular momentum deficit) is transferred to the inner planet, and\nthe two apses are largely anti-aligned. During this transport, any initial\nmutual inclination may be reduced or enhanced; either may be compatible with\nthe current constraints. So a primordial disk can drive up planet\neccentricities both in resonant planet pairs (as has been shown for GJ 876) and\nin secularly interacting, non-resonant pairs.

We\nare motivated by recent reports of resolved dark lanes (`hamburgers') and\n(sub)mm spectral indices systematically below the ISM value for optically thin\ndust $\\alpha_{\\rm ISM} =3.7$. We explore several model grids, scaling disk mass\nand varying inclination angle $i$ and observing frequency $\\nu$ from the VLA Ka\nband ($\\sim 37$ GHz) to ALMA Band 8 ($\\sim 405$ GHz).

Here\nwe extend these 2D simulations to three dimensions (3D) and find that rings and\ngaps are still formed in the presence of a moderately strong ambipolar\ndiffusion. The rings and gaps form from the same basic mechanism that was\nidentified in the 2D simulations, namely, the redistribution of the poloidal\nmagnetic flux relative to the disk material as a result of the reconnection of\na sharply pinched poloidal magnetic field lines. Thus, the less dense gaps are\nmore strongly magnetized with a large poloidal magnetic field compared to the\nless magnetized (dense) rings. The rings and gaps start out rather smoothly in\n3D simulations that have axisymmetric initial conditions. Non-axisymmetric\nvariations arise spontaneously at later times, but they do not grow to such an\nextent as to disrupt the rings and gaps. These disk substructures persist to\nthe end of the simulations, lasting up to 3000 orbital periods at the inner\nedge of the simulated disk. The longevity of the perturbed yet still coherent\nrings make them attractive sites for trapping large grains that would otherwise\nbe lost to rapid radial migration due to gas drag. As the ambipolar diffusivity\ndecreases, both the disk and the wind become increasingly turbulent, driven by\nthe magnetorotational instability, with tightly-wound spiral arms becoming more\nprominent in the disk. \n\n"}

In this study we use the ROCKE-3D dynamic-ocean\ngeneral circulation model to study the effects of slow rotations and increased\ninsolations on the 'fractional habitability' and silicate weathering rate of an\nEarth-like world. Defining the fractional habitability f_h to be the percentage\nof a planet's surface which falls in the 0 <= T <= 100 C temperature regime, we\nfind a moderate increase in f_h with a 10% and 20% increase in insolation and a\npossible maximum in f_h at sidereal day-lengths between 8 and 32 times that of\nthe modern Earth. By tracking precipitation and run-off we further determine\nthat there is a rotational regime centered on a 4-day period in which the\nsilicate weathering rate is maximized and is particularly strongly peaked at\nhigher overall insolations. Because of weathering's integral role in the\nlong-term carbonate-silicate cycle, we suggest that climate stability may be\nstrongly affected by the anticipated rotational evolution of temperate\nterrestrial-type worlds, and should be considered a major factor in their\nstudy.

The anomalous abundance in $^{26}$Al may have originated from the\naccreted material in the wind of a massive $\\apgt 20$\\,$M_\\odot$ Wolf-Rayet\nstar, but the star could also have been a member of the parental star-cluster\ninstead of an interloper or an older generation that enriched the proto-solar\nnebula. The protoplanetary disk at that time was already truncated around the\nKuiper-cliff (at $45$ au) by encounters with another cluster members before it\nwas enriched by the wind of the nearby Wolf-Rayet star. The supernova explosion\nof a nearby star, possibly but not necessarily the exploding Wolf-Rayet star,\nheated the disk to $\\apgt 1500$K, melting small dust grains and causing the\nencapsulation and preservation of $^{26}$Al into vitreous droplets. This\nsupernova, and possibly several others, caused a further abrasion of the disk\nand led to its observed tilt of $5.6\\pm1.2^\\circ$ with respect to the Sun's\nequatorial plane.

We address this question by studying\nsystems formed by a solar-like star and a close-in planet. We focus on the\nstellar wind spinning down the star along its main sequence phase and tidal\ninteraction causing orbital evolution of the systems. Despite recent\nsignificant advances in these fields, all current models use parametric\ndescriptions to study at least one of these effects. Our objective is to\nintroduce simultaneously ab-initio prescriptions of the tidal and braking\ntorques, so as to improve our understanding of the underlying physics. We\ndevelop a 1D numerical model of coplanar circular star-planet systems taking\ninto account stellar structural changes, wind braking and tidal interaction and\nimplement it in a code called ESPEM. We follow the secular evolution of the\nstellar rotation assuming a bi-layer internal structure, and of the semi-major\naxis of the orbit. After comparing our predictions to recent observations and\nmodels, we perform tests to emphasize the contribution of ab-initio\nprescriptions. Our secular model of stellar wind braking reproduces well the\nrecent observations of stellar rotation in open clusters. Our results show that\na planet can affect the rotation of its host star and that the resulting\nspin-up or spin-down depends on the orbital semi-major axis and on the joint\ninfluence of magnetic and tidal effects. The ab-initio prescription for tidal\ndissipation that we used predicts fast outward migration of massive planet\norbiting fast-rotating young stars. Finally, we provide the reader with a\ncriterion based on the system's characteristics that allows us to assess\nwhether or not the planet will undergo orbital decay due to tidal interaction. \n\n"}

It opens up the exciting possibility of detecting and\ncharacterizing magnetic fields and grain growth in disks around young stellar\nobjects. However, to use polarization for probing the disk properties, its\nproduction mechanism must be ascertained first. To date, the conventional\nmechanism involving magnetically aligned grains fails to explain the\npolarization patterns detected in most disks. This is especially true for the\ninclined disk of HL Tau in ALMA Band 3 (wavelength $\\sim 3$ mm), which has an\nelliptical polarization pattern. The elliptical pattern was taken as evidence\nfor polarized emission by dust grains aligned with their long axes\nperpendicular the direction of the radiative flux. We show that the radiatively\naligned grains produce a circular, rather than elliptical, polarization pattern\neven in inclined disks such as HL Tau. An elliptical polarization pattern can\nbe produced if the grains are aligned aerodynamically by the difference in\nrotation speed between the dust and gas through the Gold mechanism. However, a\nstrong azimuthal variation in polarized intensity is expected for both the\nradiative and aerodynamic alignment, but not observed in the HL Tau disk in\nALMA Band 3.

The performances of the proposed method are compared\nto the commonly employed Normal density using both simulations and real\nobservations, with different levels of activity and signal-to-noise ratio. When\nconsidering real observations, the correlation between the RV and the asymmetry\nof the CCF and between the RV and the width of the CCF are stronger when using\nthe parameters estimated with the SN density rather than the ones obtained with\nthe commonly employed Normal density. Using the proposed SN approach, the\nuncertainties estimated on the RV defined as the median of the SN are on\naverage 10% smaller than the uncertainties calculated on the mean of the\nNormal. The uncertainties estimated on the asymmetry parameter of the SN are on\naverage 15% smaller than the uncertainties measured on the Bisector Inverse\nSlope Span (BIS SPAN), which is the commonly used parameter to evaluate the\nasymmetry of the CCF.

We\npresent the resulting gas structures, including the relationship between the\nplanet mass and 1) the gaseous gap depth/width, and 2) the sub/super-Keplerian\nmotion across the gap. We then compute dust continuum intensity maps at the\nfrequency of the DSHARP observations. We provide the relationship between the\nplanet mass and 1) the depth/width of the gaps at millimeter intensity maps, 2)\nthe gap edge ellipticity and asymmetry, and 3) the position of secondary gaps\ninduced by the planet. With these relationships, we lay out the procedure to\nconstrain the planet mass using gap properties, and study the potential planets\nin the DSHARP disks. We highlight the excellent agreement between observations\nand simulations for AS 209 and the detectability of the young Solar System\nanalog. Finally, under the assumption that the detected gaps are induced by\nyoung planets, we characterize the young planet population in the planet\nmass-semimajor axis diagram. We find that the occurrence rate for $>$ 5 $M_J$\nplanets beyond 5-10 au is consistent with direct imaging constraints. Disk\nsubstructures allow us probe a wide-orbit planet population (Neptune to Jupiter\nmass planets beyond 10 au) that is not accessible to other planet searching\ntechniques. \n\n"}

AS 209 hosts one\nof the most unusual disks from the DSHARP sample, the first high angular\nresolution ALMA survey of disks (Andrews et al. 2018), as nearly all of the\nemission can be explained with concentric Gaussian rings. In particular, the\ndust emission consists of a series of narrow and closely spaced rings in the\ninner $\\sim$60 au, two well-separated bright rings in the outer disk, centered\nat 74 and 120 au, and at least two fainter emission features at 90 and 130 au.\nWe model the visibilities with a parametric representation of the radial\nsurface brightness profile, consisting of a central core and 7 concentric\nGaussian rings. Recent hydro-dynamical simulations of low viscosity disks show\nthat super-Earth planets can produce the multiple gaps seen in AS 209\nmillimeter continuum emission.

We explore the possibility that material surrounding a massive\nprotoplanet could explain the rim discontinuity after also considering effects\nof shadowing by an inner disk. Analysis of archival Hubble Space Telescope data\nsuggests the disk is rotating counterclockwise as expected from the spiral arm\nstructure and revealed a new low-mass companion at 6.45\" separation. We include\nan appendix which sets out clear definitions of Q, U, Qphi, Uphi, correcting\nsome confusion and errors in the literature. \n\n"}

However, directly\ncoupling gas dynamics with time-dependent chemistry is prohibitively\ncomputationally expensive when using comprehensive chemical reaction networks.\nIn this paper, we evaluate the utility of a species-based network reduction\nmethod in different disk environments to produce small chemical networks that\nreproduce the abundances of major species found in large gas-phase chemistry\nnetworks. We find that the method works very well in disk midplane and surfaces\nregions, where approximately 20-30 gas phase species, connected by $\\sim$50-60\ngas phase reactions, are sufficient to reproduce the targeted ionization\nfraction and chemical abundances. Most species of the reduced networks,\nincluding major carriers of oxygen, carbon and nitrogen, also have similar\nabundances in the reduced and complete network models. Our results may serve as\nan initial effort for future hydrodynamic/magnetohydrodynamic simulations of\nPPDs incorporating time-dependent chemistry in appropriate regions.

{"id": "1901.05006", "contents": "Title: Formation of Hot Jupiters through Secular Chaos and Dynamical Tides Abstract: The population of giant planets on short-period orbits can potentially be\nexplained by some flavours of high-eccentricity migration. In this paper we\ninvestigate one such mechanism involving \"secular chaos\", in which secular\ninteractions between at least three giant planets push the inner planet to a\nhighly eccentric orbit, followed by tidal circularization and orbital decay. In\naddition to the equilibrium tidal friction, we incorporate dissipation due to\ndynamical tides that are excited inside the giant planet. Using the method of\nGaussian rings to account for planet-planet interactions, we explore the\nconditions for extreme eccentricity excitation via secular chaos and the\nproperties of hot Jupiters formed in this migration channel. Our calculations\nshow that once the inner planet reaches a sufficiently large eccentricity,\ndynamical tides quickly dissipate the orbital energy, producing an eccentric\nwarm Jupiter, which then decays in semi-major axis through equilibrium tides to\nbecome a hot Jupiter. Dynamical tides help the planet avoid tidal disruption,\nincreasing the chance of forming a hot Jupiter, although not all planets\nsurvive the process. We find that the final orbital periods generally lie in\nthe range of 2-3 days, somewhat shorter than those of the observed hot Jupiter\npopulation. We couple the planet migration to the stellar spin evolution to\npredict the final spin-orbit misalignments. The distribution of the\nmisalignment angles we obtain shows a lack of retrograde orbits compared to\nobservations. Our results suggest that high-eccentricity migration via secular\nchaos can only account for a fraction of the observed hot Jupiter population. \n\n"}

The process of protoplanetary disc formation can result in\ninitial misalignments, where the disc orbital plane is different to the stellar\nequator in single star systems, or to the binary orbital plane in systems with\ntwo stars. A quirk of the dynamics means that initially misaligned\n`circumbinary' discs -- those that surround two stars -- are predicted to\nevolve to one of two possible stable configurations, one where the disc and\nbinary orbital planes are coplanar, and one where they are perpendicular (a\n`polar' configuration). Prior work has found coplanar circumbinary discs, but\nno polar examples were known until now. Here we report the first discovery of a\nprotoplanetary circumbinary disc in the polar configuration, supporting the\npredictions that such discs should exist. The disc shows some characteristics\nthat are similar to discs around single stars, and that are attributed to dust\ngrowth.

{"id": "1901.05190", "contents": "Title: Local simulations of MRI turbulence with meshless methods Abstract: The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is one of the most important\nprocesses in sufficiently ionized astrophysical disks. Grid-based simulations,\nespecially those using the local shearing box approximation, provide a powerful\ntool to study the ensuing nonlinear turbulence. On the other hand, while\nmeshless methods have been widely used in both cosmology, galactic dynamics,\nand planet formation they have not been fully deployed on the MRI problem. We\npresent local unstratified and vertically stratified MRI simulations with two\nmeshless MHD schemes: a recent implementation of SPH MHD (Price2012), and a MFM\nMHD scheme with a constrained gradient divergence cleaning scheme, as\nimplemented in the GIZMO code \\citep{Hopkins2017}. Concerning variants of the\nSPH hydro force formulation we consider both the \"vanilla\" SPH and the PSPH\nvariant included in GIZMO. We find, as expected, that the numerical noise\ninherent in these schemes affects turbulence significantly. A high order\nkernel, free of the pairing instability, is necessary. Both schemes can\nadequately simulate MRI turbulence in unstratified shearing boxes with net\nvertical flux. The turbulence, however, dies out in zero-net-flux unstratified\nboxes, probably due to excessive and numerical dissipation. In zero-net-flux\nvertically stratified simulations, MFM can reproduce the MRI dynamo and its\ncharacteristic butterfly diagram for several tens of orbits before ultimately\ndecaying. In contrast, extremely strong toroidal fields, as opposed to\nsustained turbulence, develop in equivalent simulations using SPH MHD. This\nunphysical state in SPH MHD is likely caused by a combination of excessive\nartificial viscosity, numerical resistivity, and the relatively large residual\nerrors in the divergence of the magnetic field remaining even after cleaning\nprocedures are applied. \n\n"}

Here, we\ndescribe a prebiotically plausible environment that draws on the strengths of\nboth scenarios: surface hydrothermal vents. We show how key feedstock molecules\nfor prebiotic chemistry can be produced in abundance in shallow and surficial\nhydrothermal systems. We calculate the chemistry of volcanic gases feeding\nthese vents over a range of pressures and basalt C/N/O contents. If\nultra-reducing carbon-rich nitrogen-rich gases interact with subsurface water\nat a volcanic vent they result in 1 mM to 1 M concentrations of diacetylene,\nacetylene, cyanoacetylene, hydrogen cyanide, bisulfite, hydrogen sulfide and\nsoluble iron in vent water. One key feedstock molecule, cyanamide, is not\nformed in significant quantities within this scenario, suggesting that it may\nneed to be delivered exogenously, or formed from hydrogen cyanide either via\norganometallic compounds, or by some as yet-unknown chemical synthesis. Given\nthe likely ubiquity of surface hydrothermal vents on young, hot, terrestrial\nplanets, these results identify a prebiotically plausible local geochemical\nenvironment, which is also amenable to future lab-based simulation. \n\n"}

The most\nadvanced spectrometers are approaching a precision of $\\sim 10$ cm/s that\nimplies the need to identify and correct for all possible sources of RV\noscillations intrinsic to the star down to this level and possibly beyond. The\nrecent discovery of global-scale equatorial Rossby waves in the Sun, also\ncalled r modes, prompted us to investigate their possible signature in stellar\nRV measurements. R modes are toroidal modes of oscillation whose restoring\nforce is the Coriolis force and propagate in the retrograde direction in a\nframe that corotates with the star. The solar r modes with azimuthal orders $3\n\\leq m \\lesssim 15$ were identified unambiguously because of their dispersion\nrelation and their long e-folding lifetimes of hundreds of days. Here we\nsimulate the RV oscillations produced by sectoral r modes with $2 \\leq m \\leq\n5$ assuming a stellar rotation period of 25.54 days and a maximum amplitude of\nthe surface velocity of each mode of 2 m/s. This amplitude is representative of\nthe solar measurements, except for the $m=2$ mode which has not yet been\nobserved. Sectoral r modes with azimuthal orders $m=2$ and $3$ would produce RV\noscillations with amplitudes of 76.4 and 19.6 cm/s and periods of 19.16 and\n10.22 days, respectively, for a star with an inclination of the rotation axis\n$i=60^{\\circ}$. Therefore, they may produce rather sharp peaks in the Fourier\nspectrum of the radial velocity time series that could lead to spurious\nplanetary detections. Sectoral r~modes may represent a source of confusion in\nthe case of slowly rotating inactive stars that are preferential targets for RV\nplanet search. The main limitation of the present investigation is the lack of\nobservational constraint on the amplitude of the $m=2$ mode on the Sun. \n\n"}

The existence of this unique solution is very useful for current\nplanet transit surveys for several reasons. First, there is an analytic\nsolution that allows a quick parameter estimate, in particular of Rp. Second,\nthe stellar density can be uniquely derived from the transit light curve alone.\nThe stellar density can be used to immediately rule out a giant star (and hence\na much larger than planetary companion) and can also be used to put an upper\nlimit on the stellar and planet radius even considering slightly evolved stars.\nThird, the presence of an additional fully blended star that contaminates an\neclipsing system to mimic a planet transit can be largely ruled out from the\ntransit light curve given a spectral type for the central star. Fourth, the\nperiod can be estimated from a single-transit light curve and a measured\nspectral type. All of these applications can be used to select the best planet\ntransit candidates for mass determination by radial velocity follow-up.
