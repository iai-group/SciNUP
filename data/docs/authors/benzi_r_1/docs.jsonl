Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\ntypes. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional\nunderstandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some\nreal problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the\nunsynchronizable state. \n\n"}

This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either\nfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a\nformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude\nLANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow. \n\n"}

Normal diffusion is then treated (i)\nthrough formalizing the random walk model and deriving a classical diffusion\nequation, (ii) by using Fick's law that leads again to the same diffusion\nequation, and (iii) by using a stochastic differential equation for the\nparticle dynamics (the Langevin equation), which allows to determine the mean\nsquare displacement of particles. (iv) We discuss normal diffusion from the\npoint of view of probability theory, applying the Central Limit Theorem to the\nrandom walk problem, and (v) we introduce the more general Fokker-Planck\nequation for diffusion that includes also advection. We turn then to anomalous\ndiffusion, discussing first its formal characteristics, and proceeding to\nContinuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) as a model for anomalous diffusion. It is\nshown how CTRW can be treated formally, the importance of probability\ndistributions of the Levy type is explained, and we discuss the relation of\nCTRW to fractional diffusion equations and show how the latter can be derived\nfrom the CTRW equations. Last, we demonstrate how a general diffusion equation\ncan be derived for Hamiltonian systems, and we conclude this tutorial with a\nfew recent applications of the above theories in laboratory and astrophysical\nplasmas. \n\n"}

The\nclassification is based on the far-field patterns of the solutions which\nconsist of a finite number of line-solitons. Each soliton solution is then\ndefined by a point of the totally non-negative Grassmann variety which can be\nparametrized by a unique derangement of the symmetric group of permutations.\nOur study also includes certain numerical stability problems of those soliton\nsolutions. Numerical simulations of the initial value problems indicate that\ncertain class of initial waves asymptotically approach to these exact solutions\nof the KP equation. We then discuss an application of our theory to the Mach\nreflection problem in shallow water.

We also generalize to include\nrotation, complicated equations of state, collapsing/expanding backgrounds,\nmagnetic fields, intermittency, & non-normal statistics. We derive how\nfragmentation is suppressed with 'stiffer' equations of state or different\ndriving mechanisms. Suppression appears at an 'effective sonic scale' where\nMach(R,rho)~1. Gas becomes stable below this scale for polytropic gamma>4/3,\nbut fragmentation still occurs on larger scales. The scale-free nature of\nturbulence and gravity generically drives mass spectra and correlation\nfunctions towards universal shapes, with weak dependence on many properties of\nthe media.

We focus on the temperature dependence of the DNP for zero\nenergy-detuning (i.e. equal electrostatic energy of one electron in each dot\nand a singlet in the right dot).

This is studied in\ntwo cases: (i) Close to the crossing of the three triplet energy levels near\nB=0, where spin-blockade is lifted due to the inhomogeneity of the effective\nmagnetic field from the nuclei.

The study is carried out under the\nOberbeck-Boussinesq approximation, and in the limit of small Reynolds and small\nP\\'eclet numbers. The force acting on the particle is obtained by using matched\nasymptotic expansions in which the small parameter is given by a/l where a is\nthe particle radius and l is the stratification length defined by Ardekani &\nStocker (2010), which depends on the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, on the fluid\nkinematic viscosity and on the thermal or the concentration diffusivity\n(depending on the case considered). The matching procedure used here, which is\nbased on series expansions of generalized functions, slightly differs from that\ngenerally used in similar problems. In addition to the classical Stokes drag,\nit is found the particle experiences a memory force given by two convolution\nproducts, one of which involves, as usual, the particle acceleration and the\nother one, the particle velocity. Owing to the stratification, the transient\nbehaviour of this memory force, in response to an abrupt motion, consists of an\ninitial fast decrease followed by a damped oscillation with an\nangular-frequency corresponding to the Brunt-Vaisala frequency.

In many applications, the suspended particles stick (or in the case\nof liquid droplets, coalesce) upon collision, and it is the frequency of first\ncontact which is of interest. If a pair of 'ghost' particles undergoes multiple\ncollisions, the GCA may overestimate the true collision rate. Here, using fully\nresolved Direct Numerical Simulations of turbulent flows at moderate Reynolds\nnumber (R_\\lambda = 130), we investigate the prevalence and properties of\nmultiple collisions. We demonstrate that the GCA leads to a systematic\noverestimate of the collision rate, which is of the order of 15% when the\nparticle inertia is small, and slowly decreases when inertia increases.

However, traditional sensitivity\nanalysis methods break down when applied to long-time averaged quantities in\nturbulent fluid flow fields, specifically those obtained using high-fidelity\nturbulence simulations. This is because of a number of dynamical properties of\nturbulent and chaotic fluid flows, most importantly high sensitivity of the\ninitial value problem, popularly known as the \"butterfly effect\".\n  The recently developed least squares shadowing (LSS) method avoids the issues\nencountered by traditional sensitivity analysis methods by approximating the\n\"shadow trajectory\" in phase space, avoiding the high sensitivity of the\ninitial value problem.

In a flat space, such energy growth is due to an inverse\ncascade, which builds a constant part of the velocity autocorrelation function\nproportional to time and expanding in scales, while the moments of the velocity\ndifference saturate during a time depending on the distance. For the curved\nspace, we analyze the long-time long-distance scaling limit, that lives in a\ndegenerate conical geometry, and find that the energy-containing mode linearly\ngrowing with time is not constant in space. The shape of the velocity\ncorrelation function indicates that the energy builds up in vortical rings of\narbitrary diameter but of width comparable to the curvature radius of the\nhyperbolic plane. The energy current across scales does not increase linearly\nwith the scale, as in a flat space, but reaches a maximum around the curvature\nradius.

In the\nhot mode, with or without turbulence, the pressure-dominated flow forms a\ngeometrically thick rotational barrier, suppressing the accretion rate to ~1/3\nof the Bondi rate. When radiative cooling is dominant, the gas loses pressure\nsupport and quickly circularizes in a cold thin disk. In the more common state\nof a turbulent and heated atmosphere, CCA drives the dynamics if the gas\nvelocity dispersion exceeds the rotational velocity, i.e., turbulent Taylor\nnumber < 1. Extended multiphase filaments condense out of the hot phase via\nthermal instability and rain toward the black hole, boosting the accretion rate\nup to 100 times the Bondi rate. Initially, turbulence broadens the angular\nmomentum distribution of the hot gas, allowing the cold phase to condense with\nprograde or retrograde motion. Subsequent chaotic collisions between the cold\nfilaments, clouds, and a clumpy variable torus promote the cancellation of\nangular momentum, leading to high accretion rates. The simulated sub-Eddington\naccretion rates cover the range inferred from AGN cavity observations. CCA\npredicts inner flat X-ray temperature and $r^{-1}$ density profiles, as\nrecently discovered in M 87 and NGC 3115. The synthetic H{\\alpha} images\nreproduce the main features of cold gas observations in massive ellipticals, as\nthe line fluxes and the filaments versus disk morphology. Such dichotomy is key\nfor the long-term AGN feedback cycle. As gas cools, filamentary CCA develops\nand boosts AGN heating; the cold mode is thus reduced and the rotating disk\nremains the sole cold structure. Its consumption leaves the atmosphere in hot\nmode with suppressed accretion and feedback, reloading the cycle. \n\n"}

Our refinement leads to a new analytical solution for\nthe dynamic kurtosis of narrowband directional waves described with a Gaussian\ntype spectrum. For multidirectional or short-crested seas initially homogenous\nand Gaussian, in a focusing (defocusing) regime dynamic kurtosis grows\ninitially, attaining a positive maximum (negative minimum) at the intrinsic\ntime scale \\[\n\\tau_{c}=\\nu^{2}\\omega_{0}t_{c}=1/\\sqrt{3R},\\qquad\\mathrm{or}\\qquad\nt_{c}/T_{0}\\approx0.13/\\nu\\sigma_{\\theta}, \\] where $\\omega_{0}=2\\pi/T_{0}$\ndenotes the dominant angular frequency.

A first step towards that larger goal is to\ndevelop information measures for individual output processes, including\ninformation generation (entropy rate), stored information (statistical\ncomplexity), predictable information (excess entropy), and active information\naccumulation (bound information rate). We calculate these for spike trains\ngenerated by a variety of noise-driven integrate-and-fire neurons as a function\nof time resolution and for alternating renewal processes. We show that their\ntime-resolution dependence reveals coarse-grained structural properties of\ninterspike interval statistics; e.g., $\\tau$-entropy rates that diverge less\nquickly than the firing rate indicate interspike interval correlations. We also\nfind evidence that the excess entropy and regularized statistical complexity of\ndifferent types of integrate-and-fire neurons are universal in the\ncontinuous-time limit in the sense that they do not depend on mechanism\ndetails.

The propagation velocity of the cyclone, i.e. the difference\nbetween its movement velocity and the mean velocity of the surrounding air\n(steering flow), determines the water vapor budget. Water vapor available to\nthe hurricane through its movement makes the hurricane self-sufficient at about\n700 km from the hurricane center obviating the need to concentrate moisture\nfrom greater distances.

In this\ninvestigation of high-$Ra$ porous media convection in a minimal flow unit, two\nreduced modeling strategies are proposed that exploit these specific flow\ncharacteristics. Both approaches utilize the idea of decomposition since the\nflow exhibits different dynamics in different regions of the domain:\nsmall-scale cellular motions generally are localized within the thermal and\nvorticity boundary layers near the upper and lower walls, while in the\ninterior, the flow exhibits persistent large-scale structures and only a few\nlow (horizontal) wavenumber Fourier modes are active. Accordingly, in the first\nstrategy, the domain is decomposed into two near-wall regions and one interior\nregion. Our results confirm that suppressing the interior high-wavenumber modes\nhas negligible impact on the essential structural features and transport\nproperties of the flow. In the second strategy, a hybrid reduced model is\nconstructed by using Galerkin projection onto a fully \\emph{a priori}\neigenbasis drawn from energy stability and upper bound theory, thereby\nextending the model reduction strategy developed by Chini \\emph{et al.}\n(\\emph{Physica~D}, vol. 240, 2011, pp. 241--248) to large $Ra$.

Previous studies show that swirl can increase shear layer growth\nrates and, in the case of confining walls, reduce flow separation.

To address\nthis, we develop a simplified model that approximates the axial flow profile as\na linear shear layer separating uniform-velocity core and annular streams.

However, the models presented so far in the\nliterature are limited in a number of regards, and more insights are required\nfrom either laboratory experiments or fieldwork for these models to be\nvalidated and improved. Unfortunately, performing detailed measurements of wave\npropagation in grease ice, either on the field or in the laboratory, is\nchallenging. As a consequence, laboratory data are relatively scarce, and often\nconsist of only a couple of wave elevation measurements along the length of the\nwave tank. We present combined measurements of wave elevation using an array of\nultrasonic probes, and water kinematics using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV),\nin a small-scale wave tank experiment. Experiments are performed over a wider\nfrequency range than what has been previously investigated. The wave elevation\nmeasurements are used to compute the wave number and exponential damping\ncoefficient. By contrast with a previous study in grease ice, we find that the\nwave number is consistent with the mass loading model, i.e. it increases\ncompared with the open water case. Wave attenuation is compared with a series\nof one-layer models, and we show that they satisfactorily describe the viscous\ndamping that is taking place. PIV data are also consistent with exponential\nwave amplitude attenuation, and a POD analysis reveals the existence of mean\nflows under the ice that are a consequence of the displacement and packing of\nthe ice induced by the gradient in the wave-induced stress. Finally, we show\nthat the dynamics of grease ice can generate eddy structures that inject eddy\nviscosity in the water under the grease ice, which would lead to enhanced\nmixing and participating in energy dissipation. \n\n"}

Varying the flow speed can give rise to a range of dynamics\nincluding limit cycle behaviour and chaotic motion of the cantilevered sheet.\nRecently, the \"inverted flag\" configuration - a cantilevered elastic sheet\naligned with the flow impinging on its free edge - has been observed to produce\nlarge-amplitude flapping over a finite band of flow speeds. This flapping\nphenomenon has been found to be a vortex-induced vibration, and only occurs at\nsufficiently large Reynolds numbers. In all cases studied, the inverted flag\nhas been formed from a cantilevered sheet of rectangular morphology, i.e. the\nplanform of its elastic sheet is a rectangle. Here, we investigate the effect\nof the inverted flag's morphology on its resulting stability and dynamics. We\nchoose a trapezoidal planform which is explored using experiment and an\nanalytical theory for the divergence instability of an inverted flag of\narbitrary morphology. Strikingly, for this planform we observe that the flow\nspeed range over which flapping occurs scales approximately with the flow speed\nat which the divergence instability occurs. This provides a means by which to\npredict and control flapping. In a biological setting, leaves in a wind can\nalso align themselves in an inverted flag configuration.

This is explained by investigating the\nnear-wall turbulence of highly elastic walls, where the strong asymmetry in the\nmagnitude of wall-normal velocity fluctuations (favouring the positive), is\nfound to push the particles towards the channel centre.

The first pole may be considered stable if we neglect the\ninner dissipation, but becomes unstable if the dissipation is taken into\naccount. This happens because the bodies dissipate energy when they rotate\nabout any axis different from principal. In the case of an oblate symmetrical\nbody, the angular velocity describes a circular cone about the vector of\n(conserved) angular momentum. In the course of relaxation, the angle of this\ncone decreases, so that both the angular velocity and the maximal-inertia axis\nof the body align along the angular momentum. The generic case of an asymmetric\nbody is far more involved. Even the symmetrical prolate body exhibits a\nsophisticated behaviour, because an infinitesimally small deviation of the\nbody's shape from a rotational symmetry (i.e., a small difference between the\nlargest and second largest moments of inertia) yields libration: the precession\ntrajectory is not a circle but an ellipse.

In the opaque barrier limit (small tunnelling rates with large\nlead widths, such that Drude conductance remains finite), the weak-localization\ngoes to zero linearly with the tunnelling rate, while the Fano factor of the\nshot-noise remains finite but becomes independent of the Ehrenfest time.

The perturbation theory\ntells that a perturbed energy eigenstate can be divided into a perturbative\npart and a non-perturbative part with the perturbative part expressed as a\nperturbation expansion. Numerically it is found that such a division is\nimportant in understanding many properties of both eigenstates and the\nso-called local spectral density of states (LDOS).

A relationship between the average shape of eigenstates\nand that of LDOS can be explained.

In a small grain with\nquantized electron states, referred to as a quantum dot, the magnitude of the\nconductance peak is directly related to the magnitude of the wavefunction near\nthe contacts to the dot. Since dots are generally irregular in shape, the\ndynamics of the electrons is chaotic, and the characteristics of Coulomb\nblockade peaks reflects those of wavefunctions in chaotic systems.

The first part of the paper\nconcerns the applications of methods used in classical differential geometry to\nstudy the chaotic dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. Starting from the identity\nbetween the trajectories of a dynamical system and the geodesics in its\nconfiguration space, a geometric theory of chaotic dynamics can be developed,\nwhich sheds new light on the origin of chaos in Hamiltonian systems. In fact,\nit appears that chaos can be induced not only by negative curvatures, as was\noriginally surmised, but also by positive curvatures, provided the curvatures\nare fluctuating along the geodesics. In the case of a system with a large\nnumber of degrees of freedom it is possible to give an analytical estimate of\nthe largest Lyapunov exponent by means of a geometric model independent of the\ndynamics. In the second part of the paper the phenomenon of phase transitions\nis addressed and it is here that topology comes into play. In fact, when a\nsystem undergoes a phase transition, the fluctuations of the\nconfiguration-space curvature exhibit a singular behavior at the phase\ntransition point, which can be qualitatively reproduced using geometric models.\nIn these models the origin of the singular behavior of the curvature\nfluctuations appears to be caused by a topological transition in configuration\nspace.
