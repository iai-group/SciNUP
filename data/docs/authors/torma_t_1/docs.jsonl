The new fields of the dark matter sector have no hadronic charges and\ncouple only to leptons. Our model can not only give rise to the observed\nneutrino mass hierarchy, but can also generate the baryon number asymmetry via\nnon-thermal leptogenesis. The breaking of the new U(1)' symmetry produces\ncosmic strings. The dark matter particles are produced non-thermally from\ncosmic string loop decay which allows one to obtain sufficiently large\nannihilation cross sections to explain the observed cosmic ray positron and\nelectron fluxes recently measured by the PAMELA, ATIC, PPB-BETS, Fermi-LAT, and\nHESS experiments while maintaining the required overall dark matter energy\ndensity.

The two-loop bubble diagram contains a linear infrared\ndivergence. Even if regulated with a non-zero photon mass M of order of the\nDebye mass, this infrared sensitivity implies that the two-loop self-energy\ncontributes terms to the fermion dispersion relation that are comparable to or\neven larger than the next-to-leading-order (NLO) contributions at one-loop.\nAdditional evidence for the necessity of a systematic restructuring of the loop\nexpansion comes from the explicit gauge parameter dependence of the fermion\ndamping rate at both one and two-loops. The leading terms in the high\ntemperature expansion of the two-loop self-energy for all topologies arise from\nan explicit hard-soft factorization pattern, in which one of the loop integrals\nis hard, nested inside a second loop integral which is soft. There are no\nhard-hard contributions to the two-loop Sigma at leading order at high T.\nProvided the same factorization pattern holds for arbitrary ell loops, the NLO\nhigh temperature contributions to the electron self-energy come from ell-1 hard\nloops factorized with one soft loop integral.

In this paper, we perform a detailed study of these models in the light\nof the latest cosmological data, which serves to illustrate the\nphenomenological viability of the new dark energy paradigm as a serious\nalternative to the traditional scalar field approaches.

The main ingredient of this formalism is the dynamical formation of\nbound-states with vanishing mass, which give rise to effective vertices\ncontaining massless poles; these latter vertices, in turn, trigger the\nSchwinger mechanism, and allow for the gauge-invariant generation of an\neffective gluon mass. This particular approach has the conceptual advantage of\nrelating the gluon mass directly to quantities that are intrinsic to the\nbound-state formation itself, such as the \"transition amplitude\" and the\ncorresponding \"bound-state wave-function\". As a result, the dynamical evolution\nof the gluon mass is largely determined by a Bethe-Salpeter equation that\ncontrols the dynamics of the relevant wave-function, rather than the\nSchwinger-Dyson equation of the gluon propagator, as happens in the standard\ntreatment.

The\ninterference contribution to the new physics signal, currently not fully taken\ninto account by experimental collaborations in Z'-searches and in the\ninterpretation of the results, can be substantial.

The\ntemperature-dependent scaling functions of the excess free energy and the\nthermodynamic Casimir force are computed in the large-$n$ limit for\ntemperatures $T$ at, above, and below the bulk critical temperature $T_{\\rm\nc}$.

In any concrete implementation of PGM,\nthe SUSY-breaking field is therefore required to carry nonzero charge under\nsome global or local symmetry. As we point out in this note, a prime candidate\nfor such a symmetry might be B-L, the Abelian gauge symmetry associated with\nthe difference between baryon number B and lepton number L. The F-term of the\nSUSY-breaking field then not only breaks SUSY, but also B-L, which relates the\nrespective spontaneous breaking of SUSY and B-L at a fundamental level.

They Bose-Einstein condense into a superfluid phase in the\ncentral regions of galaxy halos. The superfluid phonon excitations in turn\ncouple to baryons and mediate an additional long-range force. For a suitable\nchoice of the superfluid equation of state, this force can mimic Milgrom's law.\nIn this paper we develop in detail some of the main phenomenological\nconsequences of such a formalism, by revisiting the expected dark matter halo\nprofile in the presence of an extended baryon distribution. In particular, we\nshow how rotation curves of both high and low surface brightness galaxies can\nbe reproduced, with a slightly rising rotation curve at large radii in massive\nhigh surface brightness galaxies, thus subtly different from Milgrom's law.

Hence, in this framework dubbed the \"neutrino\noption\", the tree-level scalar potential is assumed to vanish at high energies.\nSuch a scenario therefore lends itself particularly well to be embedded in a\nclassically scale-invariant theory. In this paper we perform a survey of models\nfeaturing conformal symmetry at the high scale.

Abstract: For a broad range of parameter values, braneworld models display a remarkable\nproperty which we call cosmic mimicry. Cosmic mimicry is characterized by the\nfact that, at low redshifts, the Hubble parameter in the braneworld model is\nvirtually indistinguishable from that in the LCDM cosmology. An important point\nto note is that the \\Omega_m parameters in the braneworld model and in the LCDM\ncosmology can nevertheless be quite different. Thus, at high redshifts (early\ntimes), the braneworld asymptotically expands like a matter-dominated universe\nwith the value of \\Omega_m inferred from the observations of the local matter\ndensity. At low redshifts (late times), the braneworld model behaves almost\nexactly like the LCDM model but with a renormalized value of the cosmological\ndensity parameter \\Omega_m^{LCDM}. The redshift which characterizes cosmic\nmimicry is related to the parameters in the higher-dimensional braneworld\nLagrangian. Cosmic mimicry is a natural consequence of the scale-dependence of\ngravity in braneworld models. The change in the value of the cosmological\ndensity parameter is shown to be related to the spatial dependence of the\neffective gravitational constant in braneworld theory. A subclass of mimicry\nmodels lead to an older age of the universe and also predict a redshift of\nreionization which is lower than z_{reion} \\simeq 17 in the LCDM cosmology.\nThese models might therefore provide a background cosmology which is in better\nagreement both with the observed quasar abundance at z \\gsim 4 and with the\nlarge optical depth to reionization measured by the Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe. \n\n"}

I give an update on results\nfor light quark masses, the kaon B-parameter, and the decay constants and\nB-parameters of heavy-light mesons. Most of these are known in the quenched\napproximation to $\\sim 10%$ accuracy or better, and preliminary estimates of\nquenching errors are of comparable size. One exception is the light quark\nmasses, for which the quenching errors appear to be larger.

The\n  Nambu--Jona-Lasinio Model Abstract: An investigation of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking on the light front is\nmade in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with one flavor and N colors. Analysis of\nthe model suffers from extraordinary complexity due to the existence of a\n\"fermionic constraint,\" i.e., a constraint equation for the bad spinor\ncomponent. However, to solve this constraint is of special importance. In\nclassical theory, we can exactly solve it and then explicitly check the\nproperty of ``light-front chiral transformation.'' In quantum theory, we\nintroduce a bilocal formulation to solve the fermionic constraint by the 1/N\nexpansion. Systematic 1/N expansion of the fermion bilocal operator is realized\nby the boson expansion method.

We obtain the low-energy effective action which\nexhibits the invariance under the so called \\tau-symmetry.

One type of those vacuum solutions gives rise to the\ndomain wall formation with consequent trapping of light massive fermions and\nHiggs-like bosons as well as massless sterile scalars, the so-called branons.\nThe induced relations between low-energy couplings for Yukawa and scalar field\ninteractions allow to make certain predictions for light particle masses and\ncouplings themselves, which might provide a signature of the higher dimensional\norigin of particle physics at future experiments.

We show that kink\nconfigurations employing Higgs fields in the 45 (the adjoint representation) of\nO(10) break up into three classes: those that at finite distances from the wall\nrespect a U(5) subgroup of SO(10), and two others that respect the smaller\nsubgroups U(3) x U(2) and U(4) x U(1). These smaller subgroups arise from the\nclash of symmetries mechanism: they are the intersections of two differently\nembedded U(5) subgroups of SO(10), the latter being the symmetries respected in\nasymptotia on opposite sides of the domain wall. The existence of the SO(10) ->\nU(3) x U(2) = SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) x U(1)' = G_{SM} x U(1)' class advances the\nsearch for a realistic brane world model wherein some of the required symmetry\nbreaking is achieved via the clash of symmetries rather than the conventional\nmechanism. At the centres of the walls, the unbroken symmetries are enhanced.\nIn the U(3) x U(2) case, the symmetry is O(6) x U(2), which is closely related\nto the Pati-Salam-like SU(4) x SU(2) x U(1) group. If our universe is a brane\nlocated at the centre of such a wall, then we see the O(10) symmetry as being\nstrongly broken to SU(4) x SU(2) x U(1). Interestingly, if the brane-world\ndegrees of freedom enjoy a slight leakage off the wall, then an additional\nsymmetry breakdown to U(3) x U(2) = G_{SM} x U(1)' is effectively induced on\nthe brane. This provides a possible framework within which to address at least\npart of a gauge hierarchy problem: O(10) is strongly broken to SU(4) x SU(2) x\nU(1), then more weakly to G_{SM} x U(1)' depending on the amount of leakage off\nthe brane.

Though non-linear, they\ninvolve highest rank correlations linearly. They are underdetermined in many\ncases. Additional linear equations for gluon correlations, associated to\nsymmetries of action and measure are found. Loop equations aren't differential\nequations as they involve left annihilation, which doesn't satisfy the Leibnitz\nrule with concatenation. But left annihilation is a derivation of the\ncommutative shuffle product. Moreover shuffle and concatenation combine to\ndefine a bialgebra. Motivated by deformation quantization, we expand\nconcatenation around shuffle in powers of q, whose physical value is 1. At\nzeroth order the loop equations become quadratic PDEs in the shuffle algebra.\nIf the variation of the action is linear in iterated commutators of left\nannihilations, these quadratic PDEs linearize by passage to shuffle reciprocal\nof correlations. Remarkably, this is true for regularized versions of the\nYang-Mills, Chern-Simons and Gaussian actions. But the linear equations are\nunderdetermined just as the loop equations were. For any particular solution,\nthe shuffle reciprocal is explicitly inverted to get the zeroth order gluon\ncorrelations. To go beyond zeroth order, we find a Poisson bracket on the\nshuffle algebra and associative q-products interpolating between shuffle and\nconcatenation. This method, and a complementary one of deforming annihilation\nrather than product are shown to give over and underestimates for correlations\nof a gaussian matrix model. \n\n"}

We provide a contemporary perspective,\ncouched primarily in terms of the Dyson-Schwinger equations but also making\ncomparisons with other approaches and models. Our discourse provides a\npractitioners' guide to features of the Dyson-Schwinger equations [such as\nconfinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking] and canvasses\nphenomenological applications to light meson and baryon properties in cold,\nsparse QCD.

{"id": "quant-ph/9806067", "contents": "Title: Building a frame and gauge free formulation of quantum mechanics Abstract: The wave function of quantum mechanics is not a boost invariant and gauge\ninvariant quantity. Correspondingly, reference frame dependence and gauge\ndependence are inherited to most of the elements of the usual formulation of\nquantum mechanics (including operators, states and events). If a frame\ndependent and gauge dependent formalism is called, in short, a relative\nformalism, then the aim of the paper is to establish an absolute, i.e., frame\nand gauge free, reformulation of quantum mechanics. To fulfil this aim, we\ndevelop absolute quantities and the corresponding equations instead of the wave\nfunction and the Schr\\\"odinger equation. The absolute quantities have a more\ndirect physical interpretation than the wave function has, and the\ncorresponding equations express explicitly the independent physical aspects of\nthe system which are contained in the Schr\\\"odinger equation in a mixed and\nmore hidden form. Based on the absolute quantities and equations, events,\nstates and physical quantities are introduced also in an absolute way. The\nformalism makes it possible to obtain some sharper versions of the uncertainty\nrelation and to extend the validity of Ehrenfest's theorem. The absolute\nformulation allows wide extensions of quantum mechanics. To give examples, we\ndiscuss two known nonlinear extensions and, in close detail, a dissipative\nsystem. An argument is provided that the absolute formalism may lead to an\nexplanation of the Aharonov-Bohm effect purely in terms of the electromagnetic\nfield strength tensor.
