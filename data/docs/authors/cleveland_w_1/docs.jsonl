We show that if such screening occurrs via the chameleon mechanism\nsuch as in f(R), it is possible to have order one violation of the equivalence\nprinciple, despite the absence of explicit violation in the microscopic action.\nNamely, extended objects such as galaxies or constituents thereof do not all\nfall at the same rate. The chameleon mechanism can screen the scalar charge for\nlarge objects but not for small ones (large/small is defined by the\ngravitational potential and controlled by the scalar coupling). This leads to\norder one fluctuations in the inertial to gravitational mass ratio. In Jordan\nframe, it is no longer true that all objects move on geodesics. In contrast, if\nthe scalar screening occurrs via strong coupling, such as in the DGP braneworld\nmodel, equivalence principle violation occurrs at a much reduced level. We\npropose several observational tests of the chameleon mechanism: 1. small\ngalaxies should fall faster than large galaxies, even when dynamical friction\nis negligible; 2. voids defined by small galaxies would be larger compared to\nstandard expectations; 3. stars and diffuse gas in small galaxies should have\ndifferent velocities, even on the same orbits; 4. lensing and dynamical mass\nestimates should agree for large galaxies but disagree for small ones.

Binary black hole merger effects on\n  accretion disks Abstract: The merger process of a binary black hole system can have a strong impact on\na circumbinary disk. In the present work we study the effect of both central\nmass reduction (due to the energy loss through gravitational waves) and a\npossible black hole recoil (due to asymmetric emission of gravitational\nradiation). For the mass reduction case and recoil directed along the disk's\nangular momentum, oscillations are induced in the disk which then modulate the\ninternal energy and bremsstrahlung luminosities. On the other hand, when the\nrecoil direction has a component orthogonal to the disk's angular momentum, the\ndisk's dynamics are strongly impacted, giving rise to relativistic shocks. The\nshock heating leaves its signature in our proxies for radiation, the total\ninternal energy and bremsstrahlung luminosity. Interestingly, for cases where\nthe kick velocity is below the smallest orbital velocity in the disk (a likely\nscenario in real AGN), we observe a common, characteristic pattern in the\ninternal energy of the disk. Variations in kick velocity simply provide a phase\noffset in the characteristic pattern implying that observations of such a\nsignature could yield a measure of the kick velocity through electromagnetic\nsignals alone. \n\n"}

In our approach, we evolve the canonical\nmomentum and the canonical energy per baryon and thus circumvent some of the\nproblems that have plagued earlier formulations of relativistic SPH. We further\nuse a much improved artificial viscosity prescription which uses the extreme\nlocal eigenvalues of the Euler equations and triggers selectively on a) shocks\nand b) velocity noise. The shock trigger accurately monitors the relative\ndensity slope and uses it to fine-tune the amount of artificial viscosity that\nis applied. This procedure substantially sharpens shock fronts while still\navoiding post-shock noise. If not triggered, the viscosity parameter of each\nparticle decays to zero. None of these viscosity triggers is specific to\nspecial relativity, both could also be applied in Newtonian SPH.

Its main features are a hard X-ray flash (~20 keV)\nlasting ~0.01 s with a total radiated energy of ~10^{40} ergs, followed by a\ncooling tail. This creates a distinct feature in the visual light curve, which\nis separate from the nickel decay. This cooling tail has a maximum absolute\nvisual magnitude of M_V = -9 to -10 at approximately 1 day, which depends most\nsensitively on the white dwarf radius at the time of the DDT.

We show that if the primordial\nbinary fraction is small, close encounters dominate the production rate of\ncoalescing compact systems. We find that the two dominant channels are the\ninteraction of field NSs with dynamically formed binaries, and two-body\nencounters. We then estimate the redshift distribution and host galaxy\ndemographics of SGRB progenitors, and find that GCs can provide a significant\ncontribution to the overall observed rate.\n  We have carried out hydrodynamical modeling of evolution of close stellar\nencounters with WD/NS/BH, and show that there is no problem in accounting for\nthe energy budget of a typical SGRB.

A plausible scenario is\nthat this emission is the afterglow synchrotron emission produced by electrons\naccelerated in the forward shocks. In this scenario, the electrons that produce\nsynchrotron high-energy emission also undergo inverse-Compton (IC) loss and the\nIC scattering with the synchrotron photons should be in the Klein-Nishina\nregime. Here we study effects of the Klein-Nishina scattering on the\nhigh-energy synchrotron afterglow emission.

This may reveal the geometry of the explosion and its\nconnection to the equatorial ring and the outer rings around SN 1987A. We have\nused integral field spectroscopy to image the supernova ejecta and the\nequatorial ring in the emission lines of [Si I]+[Fe II] and He I.

The inner ejecta are spatially resolved in a North-South direction and\nare clearly asymmetric. We argue that the bulk of the ejecta is situated in the\nsame plane as defined by the equatorial ring and does not form a bipolar\nstructure as has been suggested. The exact shape of the ejecta is modelled and\nwe find that an elongated triaxial ellipsoid fits the observations best.

Black-Hole Images Abstract: According to the no-hair theorem, all astrophysical black holes are fully\ndescribed by their masses and spins. This theorem can be tested observationally\nby measuring (at least) three different multipole moments of the spacetimes of\nblack holes. In this paper, we analyze images of black holes within a framework\nthat allows us to calculate observables in the electromagnetic spectrum as a\nfunction of the mass, spin, and, independently, the quadrupole moment of a\nblack hole. We show that a deviation of the quadrupole moment from the expected\nKerr value leads to images of black holes that are either prolate or oblate\ndepending on the sign and magnitude of the deviation. In addition, there is a\nring-like structure around the black-hole shadow with a diameter of about 10\nblack-hole masses that is substantially brighter than the image of the\nunderlying accretion flow and that is independent of the astrophysical details\nof accretion flow models. We show that the shape of this ring depends directly\non the mass, spin, and quadrupole moment of the black hole and can be used for\nan independent measurement of all three parameters. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that this ring is highly circular for a Kerr black hole with a spin\na<0.9M, independent of the observer's inclination, but becomes elliptical and\nasymmetric if the no-hair theorem is violated.

Nuclear reactions in cosmic sites re-arrange\nthe basic constituents of atomic nuclei (neutrons and protons) among the\ndifferent configurations which are allowed by Nature, thus producing\nradioactive isotopes as a by-product. Throughout cosmic history, such reactions\noccur in different sites, and lead to rearrangements of the relative abundances\nof cosmic nuclei, a process called cosmic chemical evolution, which can be\nstudied through the observations of radioactivity. The special role of\nradioactivity in such studies is contributed by the intrinsic decay of such\nmaterial after it has been produced in cosmic sites.

To mitigate this and\nprovide a first reasonable coverage of the space of parameters, we have\ndeveloped a method for estimating the mass of the remnant torus from black\nhole-neutron star mergers. The toy model makes use of an improved relativistic\naffine model to describe the tidal deformations of an extended tri-axial\nellipsoid orbiting around a Kerr black hole and measures the mass of the\nremnant torus by considering which of the fluid particles composing the star\nare on bound orbits at the time of the tidal disruption.

In the last few years of such\ninspirals, the total phase is in the millions of radians and details of the\nwaveforms are sensitive to small perturbations.

We suggest that synchrotron\nemission of 10 - 100 TeV electrons and positrons (e+/-) can contribute to this\nemission, because starbursts have strong magnetic fields. We consider three\nsources of e+/- at these energies: (1) primary electrons directly accelerated\nby supernova remnants; (2) pionic secondary e+/- created by inelastic\ncollisions between CR protons and gas nuclei in the dense ISMs of starbursts;\n(3) pair e+/- produced between the interactions between 10 - 100 TeV gamma-rays\nand the intense far-infrared (FIR) radiation fields of starbursts. We create\none-zone steady-state models of the CR population in the Galactic Center (R <=\n112 pc), NGC 253, M82, and Arp 220's nuclei, assuming a power law injection\nspectrum for electrons and protons. We compare these models to extant radio and\nGeV and TeV gamma-ray data for these starbursts, and calculate the diffuse\nsynchrotron X-ray and Inverse Compton (IC) luminosities of these starbursts. If\nthe primary electron spectrum extends to ~PeV energies and has a\nproton/electron injection ratio similar to the Galactic value, we find that\nsynchrotron contributes 2 - 20% of their unresolved, diffuse hard X-ray\nemission. Inverse Compton emission is likewise a minority of the unresolved\nX-ray emission in these starbursts, from 0.1% in the Galactic Center to 10% in\nArp 220's nuclei. We also model generic starbursts, including submillimeter\ngalaxies, in the context of the FIR--X-ray relation, finding that up to 2% in\nthe densest starbursts with our fiducial assumptions.

The tolerable agreement with Monte Carlos based\non LO DGLAP evolution indicates that there is no qualitative difference between\n`hard' and `soft' interactions; and that a perturbative QCD approach may be\nextended into the soft domain. However, in order to describe the data, these\nMonte Carlos need an additional infrared cutoff k_min with a value k_min ~ 2-3\nGeV which is not small, and which increases with collider energy. Here we\nexplain the physical origin of the large k_min. Using an alternative model\nwhich matches the `soft' high-energy hadron interactions smoothly on to\nperturbative QCD at small x, we demonstrate that this effective cutoff k_min is\nactually due to the strong absorption of low k_t partons. The model embodies\nthe main features of the BFKL approach, including the diffusion in transverse\nmomenta, lnk_t, and an intercept consistent with resummed next-to-leading log\ncorrections.

Finding the origin of this variability would constrain the still\nlargely unknown properties of this extraordinary object. Since it exhibits an\nintensity-hardness behavior characteristic of black-hole X-ray transients, we\nhave analyzed the variability of HLX-1 in the framework of the disk instability\nmodel that explains outbursts of such systems.

Possible\nalternatives include the instability in a radiation-pressure dominated disk but\nwe argue that a more likely explanation is a modulated mass-transfer due to\ntidal stripping of a star on an eccentric orbit around the intermediate-mass\nblack hole. We consider an evolutionary scenario leading to the creation of\nsuch a system and estimate the probability of its observation.

When $M_{crit}$ is higher than the maximum mass achieved by the WD,\nthe WD must spin down before it can explode. This introduces a delay between\nthe time at which the WD has completed its epoch of mass gain and the time of\nthe explosion. Matter ejected from the binary during mass transfer therefore\nhas a chance to become diffuse, and the explosion occurs in a medium with a\ndensity similar to that of typical regions of the interstellar medium. Also,\neither by the end of the WD's mass increase or else by the time of explosion,\nthe donor may exhaust its stellar envelope and become a WD. This alters,\ngenerally diminishing, explosion signatures related to the donor star.\nNevertheless, the spin-up/spin-down model is highly predictive.

I:\n  Bondi-Hoyle accretion Abstract: We present a new code for performing general-relativistic\nradiation-hydrodynamics simulations of accretion flows onto black holes. The\nradiation field is treated in the optically-thick approximation, with the\nopacity contributed by Thomson scattering and thermal bremsstrahlung. Our\nanalysis is concentrated on a detailed numerical investigation of hot\ntwo-dimensional, Bondi-Hoyle accretion flows with various Mach numbers. We find\nsignificant differences with respect to purely hydrodynamical evolutions. In\nparticular, once the system relaxes to a radiation-pressure dominated regime,\nthe accretion rates become about two orders of magnitude smaller than in the\npurely hydrodynamical case, remaining however super-Eddington as are the\nluminosities. Furthermore, when increasing the Mach number of the inflowing\ngas, the accretion rates become smaller because of the smaller cross section of\nthe black hole, but the luminosities increase as a result a stronger emission\nin the shocked regions. Overall, our approach provides the first\nself-consistent calculation of the Bondi-Hoyle luminosity, most of which is\nemitted within r~100 M from the black hole, with typical values L/L_Edd ~ 1-7,\nand corresponding energy efficiencies eta_BH ~ 0.09-0.5. The possibility of\ncomputing luminosities self-consistently has also allowed us to compare with\nthe bremsstrahlung luminosity often used in modelling the electromagnetic\ncounterparts to supermassive black-hole binaries, to find that in the\noptically-thick regime these more crude estimates are about 20 times larger\nthan our radiation-hydrodynamics results. \n\n"}

Some of these systems\nare, or may be, high-mass binaries harboring young nonaccreting pulsars, in\nwhich the stellar and the pulsar winds collide, generating a powerful outflow\nthat should terminate at some point in the ambient medium. This work studies\nthe evolution and termination, as well as the related radiation, of the\nshocked-wind flow generated in high-mass binaries hosting powerful pulsars. A\ncharacterization, based on previous numerical work, is given for the\nstellar/pulsar wind interaction. Then, an analytical study of the further\nevolution of the shocked flow and its dynamical impact on the surrounding\nmedium is carried out. Finally, the expected nonthermal emission from the flow\ntermination shock, likely the dominant emitting region, is calculated. The\nshocked wind structure, initially strongly asymmetric, becomes a\nquasi-spherical, supersonically expanding bubble, with its energy coming from\nthe pulsar and mass from the stellar wind. This bubble eventually interacts\nwith the environment on ~pc scales, producing a reverse and, sometimes, a\nforward shock. Nonthermal leptonic radiation can be efficient in the reverse\nshock. Radio emission is expected to be faint, whereas X-rays can easily reach\ndetectable fluxes. Under very low magnetic fields and large nonthermal\nluminosities, gamma rays may also be significant. We conclude that the\ncomplexity of the stellar/pulsar wind interaction is likely to be smoothed out\noutside the binary system, where the wind-mixed flow accelerates and eventually\nterminates in a strong reverse shock. This shock may be behind the extended\nX-rays observed in some binary systems.

An intriguing situation arises when blazars are observed with the\nCherenkov Telescopes H.E.S.S., MAGIC, CANGAROO III and VERITAS. The\nextragalactic background light (EBL) produced by galaxies during cosmic\nevolution gives rise to a source dimming which becomes important in the VHE\nband.

In addition, whereas previous analysis were limited\nto the small-coupling regime, this paper considers arbitrarily large coupling\nstrengths. It is found that the CS modification leads to two effects on the\ngravitomagnetic sector of the metric: (i) Near the surface of a star or the\nhorizon of a black hole, the magnitude of the gravitomagnetic potential is\ndecreased and frame-dragging effects are reduced in comparison to GR. (ii) In\nthe case of a star, the angular momentum J, as measured by distant observers,\nis enhanced in CS gravity as compared to standard GR.

In this paper, a\nconnection between the gamma-ray and optical variability of 3C345 and\nproperties of its parsec-scale radio emission is investigated. Methods: The\nFermi-LAT data of 3C345, covering an energy range of 0.1-300 GeV, were combined\nwith 32 Very Long Baseline Array observations of the object made at 43.2 GHz in\nthe period of January 2008 - March 2010. Results: The VLBA data reveal\nmorphology and kinematics of the flow on scales of up to ~5 milliarcseconds\n(mas; deprojected linear distances of 380 parsecs). The brightness temperature,\nT_b(r), measured along the jet first decreases with distance proportional to\nr^-(0.95 +/-0.69) and later exhibits a break at ~0.3 mas, with T_b(r)\nproportional to r^-(4.11 +/-0.85) at larger separations. Variations of the\ngamma-ray, optical and parsec-scale radio emission show a similar long-term\ntrend persistent during the entire VLBA monitoring period. The gamma-ray and\noptical variations on shorter time scales are related to structural changes in\nthe jet on scales of ~0.3 mas (~23 parsecs, deprojected), with the gamma-ray\nand optical flares possibly related to the evolution of four distinct\nsuperluminal components identified in the flow.

At the same time, this result disproved the\nmodel of a single black hole system with accretion disk oscillations, as well\nas several toy models of binaries without relativistic precession.

This implies that X-ray variability can be\nused as an accurate tool to measure MBH and this method is more accurate than\nthe ones based on single epoch optical spectra. The excess variance vs.\naccretion rate dependence is weaker than expected based on the PSD break\nfrequency scaling, suggesting that both the PSD high frequency break and the\nnormalisation depend on accretion rate in such a way that they almost\ncompletely counterbalance each other.

Abstract: To investigate the missing compact star of Supernova 1987A, we analyzed both\nthe cooling and the heating processes of a possible compact star based on the\nupper limit of observational X-ray luminosity. From the cooling process we\nfound that a solid quark-cluster star, which has a stiffer equation of state\nthan that of conventional liquid quark star, has a heat capacity much smaller\nthan a neutron star. It can cool down quickly, which can naturally explain the\nnon-detection of a point source (neutron star or quark star) in X-ray band. On\nthe other hand, we consider the heating process from magnetospheric activity\nand possible accretion, and obtain some constraints to the parameters of a\npossible pulsar. We conclude that a solid quark-cluster star can be fine with\nthe observational limit in a large and acceptable parameter space. A pulsar\nwith a short period and a strong magnetic field (or with a long period and a\nweak field) would has luminosity higher than the luminosity limit if the\noptical depth is not large enough to hide the compact star.

However,\ncosmologically distant low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) have remained a challenge to\nidentify due to significant contribution from the host galaxy. We identify\nlong-term X-ray variability (~month-years, observed frame) in 20 of 92 CDF-S\ngalaxies spanning redshifts z~0.08-1.02 that do not meet other AGN selection\ncriteria. We show that the observed variability cannot be explained by X-ray\nbinary populations or ultraluminous X-ray sources, so the variability is most\nlikely caused by accretion onto a supermassive black hole. The variable\ngalaxies are not heavily obscured in general, with a stacked effective\npower-law photon index of Gamma_stack~1.93+/-0.13, and are therefore likely\nLLAGN.

While the two SNe\nhave many important similarities, the differences are quite telling: compared\nto SN2006jc, SN2011hw has weaker HeI and CaII lines and relatively stronger H\nlines, its light curve has a higher luminosity and slower decline rate, and\nemission lines associated with the progenitor's CSM are narrower.

Gamma rays are not deflected by magnetic fields, have a luminosity up\nto ~1/3 that of the injected cosmic rays, and can easily penetrate column\ndepths of ~100 g/cm^2 before being attenuated by gamma-Z pair production. The\nionization rates of GRDRs, <~10^-16 s^-1, are much smaller than in cosmic ray\ndominated regions, but in the most extreme starbursts, they may still reach\nvalues comparable to those in Milky Way molecular clouds.

Stellar-mass black holes in the \"low/hard\" state are an\nexcellent laboratory in which to study disk-jet connections, but few\ncoordinated observations are made using spectrometers that can incisively probe\nthe inner disk. We report on a series of 20 Suzaku observations of Cygnus X-1\nmade in the jet-producing low/hard state. Contemporaneous radio monitoring was\ndone using the Arcminute MicroKelvin Array radio telescope. Two important and\nsimple results are obtained: (1) the jet (as traced by radio flux) does not\nappear to be modulated by changes in the inner radius of the accretion disk;\nand (2) the jet is sensitive to disk properties, including its flux,\ntemperature, and ionization. Some more complex results may reveal aspects of a\ncoupled disk-corona-jet system. A positive correlation between the reflected\nX-ray flux and radio flux may represent specific support for a plasma ejection\nmodel of the corona, wherein the base of a jet produces hard X-ray emission.\nWithin the framework of the plasma ejection model, the spectra suggest a jet\nbase with v/c ~ 0.3, or the escape velocity for a vertical height of z ~ 20\nGM/c^2 above the black hole.

In an intermediate regime, with a\nmass range that depends on the uncertain details of rotation and mass loss\nduring the star's life, a NS is initially formed which then experiences\nfallback accretion and collapse to a BH. The electromagnetic consequence of\nsuch an event is not clear. Depending on the progenitor's structure,\npossibilities range from a long gamma-ray burst to a Type II supernova (that\nmay or may not be jet-powered) to a collapse with a weak electromagnetic\nsignature. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide the exciting opportunity to peer\nthrough the envelope of a dying massive star and directly probe what is\noccurring inside. We explore whether fallback onto young NSs can be detected by\nground-based interferometers. When the incoming material has sufficient angular\nmomentum to form a disk, the accretion spins up the NS sufficiently to produce\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities and gravitational radiation at frequencies of\n~700-2400 Hz for ~30-3000 s until collapse to a BH occurs.

We find that a circular binary system with a\nmisaligned circumbinary disk normally produces a double peaked\nmass-accretion-rate variation per binary orbit.

At the\ntypical signal amplitudes expected by the Advanced Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-wave Observatory (signal-to-noise ratios between 10 and 20), we\nshow that it will in many cases be difficult to distinguish whether the\ncomponents are neutron stars or black holes.

According to this suggestion the SN progenitor\nsuffered a rapid expansion within months before explosion. The expansion was\ndriven by leakage of energy from the core where vigorous oxygen nuclear burning\ntakes place within a year prior to explosion. This expansion triggered mass\ntransfer onto the secondary star. Most of the extra energy of the outburst\ncomes from the accretion of ~0.1Mo onto the secondary star.

However, the ability to carry out effective\nmatched-filter based searches for these systems is limited by the lack of\nreliable waveforms. Here we consider binaries in which the intermediate-mass\nblack hole has mass in the range 24 - 200 solar masses with a stellar-mass\ncompanion having masses in the range 1.4 - 18.5 solar masses. In addition, we\nconstrain the mass ratios, q, of the binaries to be in the range 1/140 < q <\n1/10 and we restrict our study to the case of circular binaries with\nnon-spinning components. We investigate the relative contribution to the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the three different phases of the coalescence:\ninspiral, merger and ringdown.

We examine the influence of the X-rays from the\nwind-wind collision shocks on the radiative driving of the stellar winds using\nsteady state models that include a parameterized line force with X-ray\nionization dependence. Our primary result is that X-ray radiation from the\nshocks inhibits wind acceleration and can lead to a lower pre-shock velocity,\nand a correspondingly lower shocked plasma temperature, yet the intrinsic X-ray\nluminosity of the shocks, LX remains largely unaltered, with the exception of a\nmodest increase at small binary separations. Due to the feedback loop between\nthe ionizing X-rays from the shocks and the wind-driving, we term this scenario\nas self regulated shocks. This effect is found to greatly increase the range of\nbinary separations at which a wind-photosphere collision is likely to occur in\nsystems where the momenta of the two winds are significantly different.\nFurthermore, the excessive levels of X-ray ionization close to the shocks\ncompletely suppresses the line force, and we suggest that this may render\nradiative braking less effective. Comparisons of model results against\nobservations reveals reasonable agreement in terms of log(LX/Lbol). The\ninclusion of self regulated shocks improves the match for kT values in roughly\nequal wind momenta systems, but there is a systematic offset for systems with\nunequal wind momenta (if considered to be a wind-photosphere collision). \n\n"}

Favorable conditions for merger are initiated by the Kozai\nresonance in which the gravitational interaction with a third distant object,\ntypically another BH, induces quasi-periodic variations of the inner BH binary\neccentricity. In this paper we perform high precision N-body simulations of the\nlong term evolution of hierarchical BH triples and investigate the conditions\nthat lead to the merging of the BH binary and the way it might become an\nobservable source of GW radiation. We find that the secular orbit average\ntreatment, adopted in previous works, does not reliably describe the dynamics\nof these systems if the binary is orbited by the outer BH on a highly inclined\norbit at a moderate distance. During the high eccentricity phase of a Kozai\ncycle the torque due to the outer BH can drive the binary to extremely large\neccentricities in a fraction of the binary's orbital period. This occurs before\nrelativistic terms become important to the evolution and allows the binary GW\nsignal to reach large GW frequencies (>~10 Hz) at high eccentricities.

This problem was solved in a previous paper by constructing\na spectral representation of the equation of state whose stellar models match a\nprescribed set of macroscopic observables. This paper improves and extends that\nwork in two significant ways: i) The method is made more robust by accounting\nfor an unexpected feature of the enthalpy based representations of the\nequations of state used in this work. After making the appropriate\nmodifications, accurate initial guesses for the spectral parameters are no\nlonger needed so Monte-Carlo techniques can now be used to ensure the best fit\nto the observables. ii) The method is extended here to use masses and tidal\ndeformabilities (which will be measured by gravitational wave observations of\nneutron-star mergers) as the macroscopic observables instead of masses and\nradii. The accuracy and reliability of this extended and more robust spectral\nmethod is evaluated in this paper using mock data for observables from stars\nbased on 34 different theoretical models of the high density neutron-star\nequation of state. In qualitative agreement with earlier work, these tests\nsuggest the high density part of the neutron-star equation of state could be\ndetermined at the few-percent accuracy level using high quality measurements of\nthe masses and radii (or masses and tidal deformabilities) of just two or three\nneutron stars. \n\n"}

Depending on the BH to NS mass ratio, spin of\nthe BH, and equations of state of dense matter, BH-NS mergers can eject more\nmaterial than NS-NS mergers. In such cases, radioactively powered emission from\nthe BH-NS merger ejecta can be more luminous than that from NS-NS mergers.

The shock compresses the plasma and\naccelerates electrons to energies up to gamma(max) > 1E4 times their rest-mass\nenergy, with the value of gamma(max) determined by the direction of the\nmagnetic field relative to the shock front. The turbulence is approximated in a\ncomputer code as many cells, each with a uniform magnetic field whose direction\nis selected randomly. The density of high-energy electrons in the plasma\nchanges randomly with time in a manner consistent with the power spectral\ndensity of flux variations derived from observations of blazars. The variations\nin flux and polarization are therefore caused by continuous noise processes\nrather than by singular events such as explosive injection of energy at the\nbase of the jet.

The\nmechanism powering such events is thought to be linked to tapping of the\nangular momentum (spin) of the black hole, the rate of accretion through the\ndisc or some combination of the two. We can attempt to discriminate between\nthese possibilities by comparing proxies for jet power with spin estimates. Due\nto the small number of sources reaching Eddington rates and have therefore been\nsuggested to act as 'standard candles', there has been much recent debate as to\nwhether a significant correlation exists between jet power and spin. We perform\ncontinuum fitting to the high-quality, disc-dominated XMM-Newton spectra of the\nextragalactic microquasar discovered in M31. Assuming prograde spin, we find\nthat, for sensible constraints the spin is always very low (a < 0.15 at\n3-sigma). When combined with a proxy for jet power derived from the maximum 5\nGHz radio luminosity during a bright flaring event, we find that the source\nsits well above the previously reported, rising correlation that would indicate\nthat spin tapping is the dominant mechanism for powering the jets. The notable\nexceptions require the inclination to be improbably small or the jet to be very\nfast.

Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to be excellent laboratories for determining\nthe equation of state (EoS) of cold dense matter. Their strong gravity suggests\nthat they can also be used to constrain gravity models. The mass and radius\n(M-R) of a NS both depend on the choice of EoS and gravity, meaning that NSs\ncannot be simultaneously good laboratories for both of these questions. A\nmeasurement of M-R would constrain the less well known physics input. The\nassumption that M-R measurements can be used to constrain EoS-presumes general\nrelativity (GR) is the ultimate model of gravity in the classical regime. We\ncalculate the radial profile of compactness and curvature (square root of the\nfull contraction of the Weyl tensor) within a NS and determine the domain not\nprobed by the Solar System tests of GR. We find that, except for a tiny sphere\nof radius less than a millimeter at the center, the curvature is several orders\nof magnitude above the values present in Solar System tests. The compactness is\nbeyond the solar surface value for r>10 m, and increases by 5 orders of\nmagnitude towards the surface. With the density being only an order of\nmagnitude higher than that probed by nuclear scattering experiments, our\nresults suggest that the employment of GR as the theory of gravity describing\nthe hydrostatic equilibrium of NSs is a rather remarkable extrapolation from\nthe regime of tested validity, as opposed to that of EoS models. Our larger\nignorance of gravity within NSs suggests that a measurement of M-R constrains\ngravity rather than EoS, and given that EoS has yet to be determined by nucleon\nscattering experiments, M-R measurements cannot tightly constrain the gravity\nmodels either. Near the surface the curvature and compactness attain their\nlargest values, while EoS in this region is fairly well known. This renders the\ncrust as the best site to look for deviations from GR. \n\n"}

In this study, we use a non-periodic\ncomputational box, the jet flow is initially established across the\ncomputational grid, and a precessional perturbation at the inlet triggers\ngrowth of the kink instability. If the velocity shear radius is located inside\nthe characteristic radius of the helical magnetic field, a static\nnon-propagating current driven kink is excited as the perturbation propagates\ndown the jet. Temporal growth disrupts the initial flow across the\ncomputational grid not too far from the inlet.

It is the decay of quantum vacuum into\nparticle anti-particle pairs near the black hole surface. However, in a\nreference frame undergoing an uniform accelerated motion in an otherwise flat\nMinkowski space-time geometry, in the non-relativistic approximation, the\nparticle production near the event horizon of a black hole may be treated as a\nkind of Fowler-Nordheim field emission, which is the typical electron emission\nprocess from a metal surface under the action of an external electrostatic\nfield.

Here we discuss particle acceleration at the forward shock of SN and\ndiscuss the possibility that the escaping particle current may excite a\nnon-resonant instability that in turn leads to the formation of resonant modes\nconfining particles close to the shock and increasing the maximum energy. This\nmechanism works throughout the expansion of the SN explosion, from the ejecta\ndominated (ED) to the Sedov-Taylor (ST) phase. Because of their higher\nexplosion rate,we focus on type II SNae expanding in the slow, dense red\nsupergiant wind. When the explosion occurs in such winds, the transition\nbetween the ED and the ST phase is likely to take place within a few tens of\nyears. As a result, the spectrum of accelerated particles shows a break in the\nslope, at the maximum energy (Em) achieved at the beginning of the ST phase.\nAbove this energy, the spectrum becomes steeper but remains a power law than\ndeveloping an exponential cutoff. We show that for type II SNae typical\nparameters, proton Em can easily reach PeV energies, confirming that type II\nSNRs are the best candidate sources for CRs at the knee.

We demonstrate here that for some\nrealistic progenitors enshrouded in optically thick winds, such as possibly SN\n2008D, a CS forms deep inside the wind, soon after the RDS leaves the core, and\ntherefore significantly before SB. The RDS does not survive the transition from\nthe core to the thick wind when the wind close to the core is not sufficiently\ndense to compensate for the $r^{-2}$ dilution of photons due to shock\ncurvature.

It has been debated whether these form a new\ndistinct class of events or whether they are similar to long GRBs.

We argue that this can be\nthe case for the central engines of GRBs and we show that the duration of the\nburst depends on the magnetic flux accumulated on the event horizon of the\nblack hole. We thus estimate the surface magnetic field of a possible\nprogenitor star, and we conclude that an Ultra Long GRB may originate from a\nprogenitor star with a relatively low magnetic field. \n\n"}

Such a BH-torus system can be formed in compact binary\nmergers and is able to launch a relativistic jet, which can then produce the\nSGRB. This basic scenario, however, has recently been challenged by Swift\nsatellite observations, which have revealed long-lasting X-ray afterglows in\nassociation with a large fraction of SGRB events. The long durations of these\nafterglows (from minutes to several hours) cannot be explained by the\n$\\sim\\text{s}$ accretion timescale of the torus onto the BH, and, instead,\nsuggest a long-lived NS as the persistent source of radiation.

Interestingly, we\nfind that, in the limit of ideal magnetohydrodynamics, i.e., for infinite\nconductivity, and irrespective of the strength of the initial magnetization,\nthe decay of the fluid energy density $e$ with proper time $\\tau$ is the same\nas for the time-honored \"Bjorken flow\" without magnetic field. Furthermore,\nwhen the magnetic field is assumed to decay $\\sim \\tau^{-a}$, where $a$ is an\narbitrary number, two classes of analytic solutions can be found depending on\nwhether $a$ is larger or smaller than one. In summary, the analytic solutions\npresented here highlight that the Bjorken flow is far more general than\nformerly thought. These solutions can serve both to gain insight on the\ndynamics of heavy-ion collisions in the presence of strong magnetic fields and\nas testbeds for numerical codes. \n\n"}

At such\nhigh energies, the conventional neutrino flux is suppressed and the prompt\ncomponent from charm meson decays is expected to become the dominant background\nto astrophysical neutrinos. Charm production at high energies is however\ntheoretically uncertain, both since the charm mass is at the boundary of\napplicability of perturbative QCD, and also because the calculations are\nsensitive to the poorly-known gluon PDF at small-x. In this work we provide\ndetailed perturbative QCD predictions for charm and bottom production in the\nforward region, and validate them by comparing with recent data from the LHCb\nexperiment at 7 TeV.

This is especially invoked for Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies,\nwhere an extremely broad iron line seen in episodes of low X-ray flux can both\nbe explained by extremely strong relativistic effects as the source approaches\nthe black hole horizon.

Abstract: Nearby Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) have been proposed as a possible cause of mass\nextinctions on Earth. Due to the higher event rate of GRBs at higher redshifts,\nit has been speculated that life as we know it may not survive above a certain\nredshift (e.g. $z>0.5$). We examine the duty cycle of lethal (life-threatening)\nGRBs in the solar neighborhood, in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies\nand GRB host galaxies, with the dependence of the long GRB rate on star\nformation and metallicity properly taken into account. We find that the number\nof lethal GRBs attacking Earth within the past 500 Myr ($\\sim$ epoch of the\nOrdovician mass extinction) is $0.93$. The number of lethal GRBs hitting a\ncertain planet increases with redshift, thanks to the increasing star formation\nrate and decreasing metallicity in high-$z$ galaxies. Taking 1 per 500 Myr as a\nconservative duty cycle for life to survive, as evidenced by our existence, we\nfind that there are still a good fraction of SDSS galaxies beyond $z=0.5$ where\nthe GRB rate at half-mass radius is lower than this value.

In this manuscript, we assume that the shock revival is\ninitiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition\nfor spherically symmetric shock expansion, $v_s > 0$. One of the most useful\none-dimensional explosion conditions is the neutrino luminosity and\nmass-accretion rate ($L_{\\nu}-\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$) critical curve. Below this\ncurve, steady-state stalled solutions exist, but above this curve, there are no\nstalled solutions.

In this manuscript, we take one step closer to\nproving this supposition; we show that all steady solutions above this curve\nhave $v_s > 0$. Assuming that these steady $v_s > 0$ solutions correspond to\nexplosion, we present a new dimensionless integral condition for explosion,\n$\\Psi > 0$. $\\Psi$ roughly describes the balance between pressure and gravity,\nand we show that this parameter is equivalent to the $\\tau$ condition used to\ninfer the $L_{\\nu}-\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$ critical curve.

As a result the pressure not\nonly opposes gravity but also enhances it. The later role of pressure becomes\nmore pronounced with increasing compactness, $M/R$ where $M$ and $R$ are the\nmass and radius of the star, and sets a critical mass beyond which collapse is\ninevitable. This critical mass has no Newtonian analogue; it is conceptually\ndifferent than the Stoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit in Newtonian gravity which\nis attained asymptotically for ultra-relativistic fermions. For white dwarfs\nthe general relativistic critical mass is very close to the\nStoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit.

We consider a variety of disc states that include radiatively\ninefficient thick discs, radiatively efficient thin discs, and super-Eddington\naccretion discs. The magnetic field strength of the BZ jet is chosen as either\nfrom standard equipartition arguments or from magnetically arrested disc (MAD)\nsimulations.

Abstract: Future electromagnetic observations of black holes may allow us to test\nGeneral Relativity in the strong-field regime. Such tests, however, require\nknowledge of rotating black hole solutions in modified gravity theories, a\nclass of which does not admit the Kerr metric as a solution. Several rotating\nblack hole solutions in modified theories have only been found in the\nslow-rotation approximation (i.e. assuming the spin angular momentum is much\nsmaller than the mass squared). We here investigate whether the systematic\nerror due to the approximate nature of these black hole metrics is small enough\nrelative to the observational error to allow their use in electromagnetic\nobservations to constrain deviations from General Relativity. We address this\nby considering whether electromagnetic observables constructed from a\nslow-rotation approximation to the Kerr metric can fit observables constructed\nfrom the full Kerr metric with systematic errors smaller than current\nobservational errors. We focus on black hole shadow and continuum spectrum\nobservations, as these are the least influenced by accretion disk physics, with\ncurrent observational errors of about 10%.

Because the mass\nof ejecta from these channels could be quite different, their light curves are\nalso expected to be diverse. We evaluate the dynamic evolution of optical\ntransients powered by millisecond magnetars. We find that the magnetar with\nshort spin-down timescale converts its rotational energy mostly into the\nkinetic energy of the transient, while the energy of a magnetar with long\nspin-down timescale goes into radiation of the transient. This leads us to\nspeculate that hypernovae could be powered by magnetars with short spin-down\ntimescales. At late times the optical transients will gradually evolve into a\nnebular phase because of the photospheric recession.

We find that this system is a post\ncore passage, dissociative, binary merger, with the optical galaxy density\npeaks of each subcluster leading their associated X-ray emission peaks. This\nseparation occurs because the diffuse gas experiences ram pressure forces while\nthe effectively collisionless galaxies (and presumably their associated dark\nmatter halos) do not. This system contains double peaked diffuse radio\nemission, possibly a double radio relic with the relics lying along the merger\naxis and also leading the X-ray cores.

Motivated by this, I explore the interaction of FRBs with young\nsupernova remnants (SNRs), and I discuss the potential observational\nconsequences and constraints of such a scenario. As the SN ejecta plows into\nthe interstellar medium (ISM), a reverse shock is generated that passes back\nthrough the material and ionizes it. This leads to a dispersion measure (DM)\nassociated with the SNR as well as a time derivative for DM.

Its localization is consistent\nwith the direction to GW150914. We speculate about the possible scenario for\nthe formation of a gamma-ray burst accompanied by the gravitational-wave\nsignal. Our model invokes a tight binary system consisting of a massive star\nand a black hole which leads to the triggering of a collapse of the star's\nnucleus, the formation of a second black hole, and finally to the binary black\nhole merger.

We propose that the\ntransformation of NSCs into SMBHs occurs via runaway tidal captures, once NSCs\nexceed a certain critical central density and velocity dispersion. The\nbottleneck in this process, as with all collisional runaways, is growing the\nfirst e-fold in black hole mass. The growth of a stellar mass black hole past\nthis bottleneck occurs as tidally captured stars are consumed in repeated\nepisodes of mass transfer at pericenter. Tidal captures may turn off as a\ngrowth channel once the black hole reaches a mass ~100-1000 solar masses, but\ntidal disruption events will continue and appear capable of growing the seed\nSMBH to larger sizes. The runaway slows (becomes sub-exponential) once the seed\nSMBH consumes the core of its host NSC. While the bulk of the cosmic mass\ndensity in SMBHs is ultimately produced (via the Soltan-Paczynski argument) by\nepisodic gaseous accretion in very massive galaxies, the smallest SMBHs have\nprobably grown from strong tidal encounters with NSC stars.

However, in\nreality the accretion flow around black holes consists of fluid, in which the\npressure often plays an important role. Here we consider the influence of fluid\npressure on the location of marginally stable circular orbit around black\nholes. It is found that when the temperature of the fluid is so low that the\nthermal energy of a particle is much smaller than its rest energy, the location\nof marginally stable circular orbit is almost the same as that in the test\nparticle case.

Previous studies of this type\ntreated the NS core as a normal fluid and thus did not account for its expected\nsuperfluidity. The source of buoyancy that supports the g modes is\nfundamentally different in the two cases: in a normal fluid core the buoyancy\nis due to gradients in the proton-to-neutron fraction whereas in a superfluid\ncore it is due to gradients in the muon-to-electron fraction. The latter yields\na stronger stratification and a superfluid NS therefore has a denser spectrum\nof g modes with frequencies above 10 Hz. As a result, many more g modes undergo\nresonant tidal excitation as the binary sweeps through the bandwidth of GW\ndetectors such as LIGO. We find that roughly 10 times more orbital energy is\ntransferred into g mode oscillations if the NS has a superfluid core rather\nthan a normal fluid core. However, because this energy is transferred later in\nthe inspiral when the orbital decay is faster, the accumulated phase error in\nthe gravitational waveform is comparable for a superfluid and a normal fluid NS\n(about 0.001-0.01 rad).

The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has the largest field of\nview (FOV) for detecting GRBs as it views the entire unocculted sky, but as a\nnon-imaging instrument it relies on the relative count rates observed in each\nof its 14 detectors to localize transients.

In the standard picture, an EM outburst\nwill be produced when the binary \"decouples\" from the circum-binary disc and\nstarts \"squeezing\" the disc inside the secondary orbit, resulting in its quick\naccretion on to the primary black hole. Here we use analytical arguments and\nnumerical simulations to show that the disc within about $20~R_S$ of a SMBH\nsurvives the merger without being depleted.

Much of this may be caused\nby the requirement that the gravitational sphere of influence of the black hole\nmust be resolved for the black-hole mass to be reliably estimated. We revisit\nthis issue by using a comprehensive galaxy evolution semi-analytic model, which\nself-consistently evolves supermassive black holes from high-redshift seeds via\ngas accretion and mergers, and also includes AGN feedback. Once tuned to\nreproduce the (mean) correlation of black-hole mass with velocity dispersion,\nthe model is unable to also account for the correlation with stellar mass. This\nbehaviour is independent of the model's parameters, thus suggesting an internal\ninconsistency in the data. The predicted distributions, especially at the\nlow-mass end, are also much broader than observed. However, if selection\neffects are included, the model's predictions tend to align with the\nobservations. We also demonstrate that the correlations between the residuals\nof the local scaling relations are more effective than the scaling relations\nthemselves at constraining AGN feedback models. In fact, we find that our\nsemi-analytic model, while in apparent broad agreement with the scaling\nrelations when accounting for selection biases, yields very weak correlations\nbetween their residuals at fixed stellar mass, in stark contrast with\nobservations. This problem persists when changing the AGN feedback strength,\nand is also present in the $z\\sim 0$ outputs of the hydrodynamic cosmological\nsimulation Horizon-AGN, which includes state-of-the-art treatments of AGN\nfeedback.

This resonant tide can induce phase shift in the\ngravitational waveforms, and potentially provide a new window of studying NS\ninterior using gravitational waves. Previous works have considered tidal\nexcitations of pure g-modes (due to stable stratification of the star) and pure\ninertial modes (due to Coriolis force), with the rotational effect treated in\nan approximate manner. However, for realistic NSs, the buoyancy and rotational\neffects can be comparable, giving rise to mixed inertial-gravity modes. We\ndevelop a non-perturbative numerical spectral code to compute the frequencies\nand tidal coupling coefficients of these modes. We then calculate the phase\nshift in the gravitational waveform due to each resonance during binary\ninspiral. We adopt polytropic NS models with a parameterized stratification. We\nderive relevant scaling relations and survey how the phase shift depends on\nvarious properties of the NS. We find that for canonical NSs (with mass M =\n1.4M_sun and radius R = 10 km) and modest rotation rates (< 300 Hz), the\ngravitational wave phase shift due to a resonance is generally less than 0.01\nradian. But the phase shift is a strong function of R and M, and can reach a\nradian or more for low-mass NSs with larger radii (R > 15 km). Significant\nphase shift can also be produced when the combination of stratification and\nrotation gives rise to a very low frequency (< 20 Hz in the inertial frame)\nmodified g-mode.

In this paper we performed a systematic and homogeneous analysis\nof sufficiently bright X-ray flares from the SFXTs observed with XMM-Newton to\nprobe spectral variations on timescales as short as a few hundred of seconds.\nOur ultimate goal is to investigate if SFXT flares and outbursts are triggered\nby the presence of clumps and eventually reveal whether strongly or mildly\ndense clumps are required. For all sources, we employ a technique developed by\nour group, making use of an adaptive rebinned hardness ratio to optimally\nselect the time intervals for the spectral extraction. A total of twelve\nobservations performed in the direction of five SFXTs are reported. We show\nthat both strongly and mildly dense clumps can trigger these events. In the\nformer case, the local absorption column density may increase by a factor of\n>>3, while in the latter case, the increase is only by a factor of 2-3 (or\nlower). Overall, there seems to be no obvious correlation between the dynamic\nranges in the X-ray fluxes and absorption column densities in SFXTs, with an\nindication that lower densities are recorded at the highest fluxes. This can be\nexplained by the presence of accretion inhibition mechanism(s). We propose a\nclassification of the flares/outbursts from these sources to drive future\nobservational investigations. We suggest that the difference between the\nclasses of flares/outbursts is related to the fact that the mechanism(s)\ninhibiting accretion can be overcome more easily in some sources compared to\nothers. We also investigate the possibility that different stellar wind\nstructures, rather than clumps, could provide the means to temporarily overcome\nthe inhibition of accretion in SFXTs. \n\n"}

Accretion\ncould then be driven by large-scale magnetic fields via magnetic braking, but\nlarge-scale magnetic flux can build-up onto the black hole and within the disk\nleading to a magnetically-arrested disk (MAD). Such a MAD state is unstable to\nthe magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability, which itself leads to vigorous\nturbulence and the emergence of low-density highly-magnetized bubbles. This\ninstability was studied in a thin (ratio of half-height H to radius R, $H/R\n\\approx 0.1$) MAD simulation, where it has a more dramatic effect on the\ndynamics of the disk than for thicker disks. We find that the low-density\nbubbles created by the magnetic RT instability decrease the stress (leading to\nangular momentum transport) in the disk rather than increasing magnetic\ntorques. Indeed, we find that the dominant component of the stress is due to\nturbulent magnetic fields, despite the suppression of the axisymmetric MRI and\nthe dominant presence of large-scale magnetic fields.

In fact, the standard SHP,\nwhere the DM particle, $S$, only has renormalizable interactions with the\nHiggs, is non-operational due to strong constraints, specially from DM direct\ndetection limits. Thus we consider a most economical extension, called ESHP\n(for extended SHP), which simply consists in the addition of a second (heavier)\nscalar singlet in the dark sector. The second scalar can be integrated-out,\nleaving a standard SHP plus a dimension-6 operator. Essentially, this model has\nonly two relevant parameters (the DM mass and the coupling of the dim-6\noperator). DM annihilation occurs mainly into two Higgs bosons, $SS\\rightarrow\nhh$.

While true, it is shown in this paper that a LIGO interferometric\ndetector also undergoes frequent and {\\it discrete} quantum interactions with\nan incident gravitational wave, in such a way as to allow the exchange of\nenergy and momentum between the wave and the detector. This opens the door to\nanother way of finding gravitons. The most basic form of an interaction is the\nfirst order Fermi acceleration (deceleration) of a laser photon as it is\nreflected by a test mass mirror oscillating in the gravitational wave,\nresulting in a frequency blueshift (redshift) of the photon depending on\nwhether the mirror is advancing towards (receding from) the photon before the\nreflection. If e.g. a blueshift occurred, wave energy is absorbed and the\noscillation will be damped. It is suggested that such energy exchanging\ninteractions are responsible for the observed radiation reaction noise of LIGO\n(although the more common way of calculating the same amplitude for this noise\nis based on momentum considerations). Most importantly, in each interaction the\ndetector absorbs or emits wave energy in amounts far smaller than the standard\ngraviton energy $\\hbar\\omega$ where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the\ngravitational wave.

The case\n  of electron scattering Abstract: Bow shocks and related density enhancements produced by the winds of massive\nstars moving through the interstellar medium provide important information\nregarding the motions of the stars, the properties of their stellar winds, and\nthe characteristics of the local medium. Since bow shocks are aspherical\nstructures, light scattering within them produces a net polarization signal\neven if the region is spatially unresolved. Scattering opacity arising from\nfree electrons and dust leads to a distribution of polarized intensity across\nthe bow shock structure. That polarization encodes information about the shape,\ncomposition, opacity, density, and ionisation state of the material within the\nstructure.

Such a structure could have different origins, however, the only\nphysically motivated one, proposed so far, is the interaction of a relativistic\njet with the ejecta and the resulting cocoon. The jet could have been choked or\nsuccessful. In the latter case, it has produced a short GRB pointing elsewhere\n(this successful jet-cocoon system is sometimes called a \"structured jet\").\nAlthough circumstantial evidence disfavors a successful jet, the jet fate\ncannot be decisively determined from current observations.

Unfortunately, Boltzmann's equations of\nradiation transport remain too costly to be evolved directly in merger\nsimulations. Simulations rely instead on approximate transport algorithms with\nunquantified modeling errors. In this paper, we use for the first time a\ntime-dependent general relativistic Monte-Carlo (MC) algorithm to solve\nBoltzmann's equations and estimate important properties of the neutrino\ndistribution function ~10ms after a neutron star merger. We do not fully couple\nthe MC algorithm to the fluid evolution, but use a short evolution of the\nmerger remnant to critically assess errors in our approximate gray two-moment\ntransport scheme. We demonstrate that the analytical closure used by the moment\nscheme is highly inaccurate in the polar regions, but performs well elsewhere.\nWhile the average energy of polar neutrinos is reasonably well captured by the\ntwo-moment scheme, estimates for the neutrino energy become less accurate at\nlower latitudes. The two-moment formalism also overestimates the density of\nneutrinos in the polar regions by ~50%, and underestimates the neutrino\npair-annihilation rate at the poles by factors of 2-3. Although the latter is\nsignificantly more accurate than one might have expected before this study, our\nresults indicate that predictions for the properties of polar outflows and for\nthe creation of a baryon-free region at the poles are likely to be affected by\nerrors in the two-moment scheme, thus limiting our ability to reliably model\nkilonovae and gamma-ray bursts. \n\n"}

Information about the viewing angle of the binary\norbital plane is therefore crucial to the interpretation of both the GW and the\nEM data, and can potentially be extracted from either side.\n  In the first part of this study, we present a systematic analysis of how well\nthe viewing angle of binary neutron stars can be measured from the GW data.

At the time of their formation, the PBHs get attached\nto the strings and influence their evolution, leading to the formation of\nblack-hole-string networks and commonly to the suppression of loop production\nin a range of redshifts.

We also\nexplore the formation and dynamical impact of density cusps that arise in both\nsystems due to the presence of a massive, central black hole. The large N-body,\nself-gravitating systems we treat are \"weakly-collisional\": the mean free time\nbetween star or SIDM particle collisions is much longer than their\ncharacteristic crossing (dynamical) time scale, but shorter than the system\nlifetime. The fluid conduction model reliably tracks the \"gravothermal\ncatastrophe\" in star clusters and SIDM halos without black holes. For a star\ncluster with a massive, central black hole, this approximation reproduces the\nfamiliar Bahcall-Wolf quasistatic density cusp for the stars bound to the black\nhole and shows how the cusp halts the \"gravothermal catastrophe\" and causes the\ncluster to re-expand.

The flaring behavior is\nrecurrent for at least two sources. If the flare represents a short period of\naccretion onto an IMBH during the periastron passage of a donor star on an\neccentric (i.e., repeating) or parabolic (non-repeating) orbit, we argue that\nthe flare's rise time corresponds to the duration during which the donor's\ntidally stripped mass joins a residual disk at the pericenter. This duration is\nin turn equal to three other time scales: the duration of stripping, the sound\ncrossing time of the donor, and the circular orbit time at the pericenter\nradius. Only a white dwarf can have a sound crossing time as short as one\nminute. Therefore, the donor must be a white dwarf and it was stripped of\n~10^{-10} M_sun upon each passage at several to tens of Schwarzschild radii\nfrom the IMBH.

We use three sets of equations of state to study such effects from a\nmore general point of view: the Quark-Hadron Chiral Parity-Doublet (Q$\\chi$P)\nmodel for both hadronic and quark phases, and the Many-Body Forces (MBF) model\nconnected to either the MIT Bag model with vector interaction (MIT) or to the\nConstant-Sound-Speed (CSS) approximation for the quark phase, through a Maxwell\nconstruction.

Those deviations \"evolve\" smoothly in a plane\nnormal to the field-line direction as one moves that plane along the field\nline. Since the evolution can be described by a planar flow in the normal\nplane, we derive most of our results in the context of a toy model for planar\nfluid flow. We then generalize our results to include the effects of field-line\ncurvature. We show that the type of flow is determined by the two non-zero\neigenvalues of the gradient of the normalized magnetic field. The eigenvalue\ndifference quantifies the local rate of squeezing or coiling of neighboring\nfield lines, which we relate to standard notions of fluid vorticity and shear.\nThe resulting squeezing rate can be used in the detection of null points,\nhyperbolic flux tubes and current sheets. Once integrated along field lines,\nthat rate gives a squeeze factor, which is an approximation to the squashing\nfactor, which is usually employed in locating quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs),\nwhich are possible sites for magnetic reconnection. Unlike the squeeze factor,\nthe squashing factor can miss QSLs for which field lines are squeezed and then\nunsqueezed.

In the\nformer case, the merger rate density is dominated by the single-merger events,\nwhile in the latter two cases, the contribution of the multiple-merger events\non the merger rate density can not be ignored. The effects of the merger\nhistory on the merger rate density depend on the mass function. \n\n"}

Its core functionality comprises a range of Fourier analysis\ntechniques commonly used in spectral-timing analysis, as well as extensions for\nanalyzing pulsar data, simulating data sets, and statistical modeling. Its\nmodular build allows for easy extensions and incorporation of its methods into\ndata analysis workflows and pipelines. We aim for the library to be a platform\nfor the implementation of future spectral-timing techniques. Here, we describe\nthe overall vision and framework, core functionality, extensions, and\nconnections to high-level command-line and graphical interfaces. The code is\nwell-tested, with a test coverage of currently 95%, and is accompanied by\nextensive API documentation and a set of step-by-step tutorials. \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.08262", "contents": "Title: Bayesian Analysis on the X-ray Spectra of the Binary Neutron Star Merger\n  GW170817 Abstract: For the first time, we present a Bayesian time-resolved spectral study of the\nX-ray afterglow datasets of GW170817/GRB17017A observed by the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory. These include all 12 public datasets, from the earliest\nobservation taken at $\\rm t \\sim 9~d$ to the newest observation at $\\rm \\sim\n359~d$ post-merger. While our results are consistent with the other works using\nCash statistic within uncertainty, the Bayesian analysis we performed in this\nwork have yielded Gaussian-like parameter distributions. We also obtained the\nparameter uncertainties directly from their posterior probability\ndistributions. We are able to confirm that the power-law photon index has\nremained constant of $\\Gamma \\sim 1.6$ throughout the entire year-long\nobserving period, except for the first dataset observed at $\\rm t = 8.9~d$ when\n$\\Gamma =1.04\\pm0.44$ is marginally harder. We also found that the unabsorbed\nX-ray flux peaked at $\\rm t \\sim 155~d$, temporally consistent with the X-ray\nflare model suggested recently by Piro et al (2018). The X-ray flux has been\nfading since $\\sim160$ days after the merger and has returned to the level as\nfirst discovered after one year. Our result shows that the X-ray spectrum of\nGW170817/GRB170817A is well-described by a simple power-law originated from\nnon-thermal slow-cooling synchrotron radiation. \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.10731", "contents": "Title: Optical Variability of TeV Blazars on long time-scales Abstract: We present the results of photometric observations of three TeV blazars, 3C\n66A, S5 0954+658 and BL Lacertae, during the period 2013--2017. Our extensive\nobservations were performed in a total of 360 nights which produced $\\sim$6820\nimage frames in BVRI bands. We study flux and spectral variability of these\nblazars on these lengthy timescales. We also examine the optical Spectral\nEnergy Distributions of these blazars, which are crucial in understanding the\nemission mechanism of long-term variability in blazars. All three TeV blazars\nexhibited strong flux variability during our observations. The colour\nvariations are mildly chromatic on long timescales for two of them. The nature\nof the long-term variability of 3C 66A and S5 0954+658 is consistent with a\nmodel of a non-thermal variable component that has a continuous injection of\nrelativistic electrons with power law distributions around 4.3 and 4.6,\nrespectively. However, the long-term flux and colour variability of BL Lac\nsuggests that these can arise from modest changes in velocities or viewing\nangle toward the emission region, leading to variations in the Doppler boosting\nof the radiation by a factor ~1.2 over the period of these observations. \n\n"}
