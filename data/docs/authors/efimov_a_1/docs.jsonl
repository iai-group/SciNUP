{"id": "1010.6184", "contents": "Title: Regularizations of general singular integral operators Abstract: In the theory of singular integral operators significant effort is often\nrequired to rigorously define such an operator. This is due to the fact that\nthe kernels of such operators are not locally integrable on the diagonal, so\nthe integral formally defining the operator or its bilinear form is not well\ndefined (the integrand is not in L^1) even for nice functions. However, since\nthe kernel only has singularities on the diagonal, the bilinear form is well\ndefined say for bounded compactly supported functions with separated supports.\n  One of the standard ways to interpret the boundedness of a singular integral\noperators is to consider regularized kernels, where the cut-off function is\nzero in a neighborhood of the origin, so the corresponding regularized\noperators with kernel are well defined (at least on a dense set). Then one can\nask about uniform boundedness of the regularized operators. For the standard\nregularizations one usually considers truncated operators.\n  The main result of the paper is that for a wide class of singular integral\noperators (including the classical Calderon-Zygmund operators in\nnon-homogeneous two weight settings), the L^p boundedness of the bilinear form\non the compactly supported functions with separated supports (the so-called\nrestricted L^p boundedness) implies the uniform L^p-boundedness of regularized\noperators for any reasonable choice of a smooth cut-off of the kernel. If the\nkernel satisfies some additional assumptions (which are satisfied for classical\nsingular integral operators like Hilbert Transform, Cauchy Transform,\nAhlfors--Beurling Transform, Generalized Riesz Transforms), then the restricted\nL^p boundedness also implies the uniform L^p boundedness of the classical\ntruncated operators. \n\n"}

The data for this analysis were recorded by the CDF II\ndetector at the Tevatron collider. The variables studied are the transverse\nthrust and thrust minor, both defined in the plane perpendicular to the beam\ndirection. The observables are measured using energies from unclustered\ncalorimeter cells. In addition to studies of the differential distributions, we\npresent the dependence of event shape mean values on the leading jet transverse\nenergy. Data are compared with pythia Tune A and to resummed parton level\npredictions that were matched to fixed order results at NLO accuracy (NLO+NLL).\nPredictions from pythia Tune A agree fairly well with the data. However, the\nunderlying event contributes significantly to these observables, making it\ndifficult to make direct comparisons to the NLO+NLL predictions, which do not\naccount for the underlying event. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a\nnew observable, a weighted difference of the mean values of the thrust and\nthrust minor, which is less sensitive to the underlying event, allowing for a\ncomparison with NLO+NLL. Both pythia Tune A and the NLO+NLL calculations agree\nwell within the 20% theoretical uncertainty with the data for this observable,\nindicating that perturbative QCD successfully describes shapes of the hadronic\nfinal states. \n\n"}

Localizing an\narbitrary triangulated $C$ by a set $S$ of morphisms in the heart of a weight\nstructure $w$ for it one obtains a triangulated category endowed with a weight\nstructure $w'$. The heart of $w'$ is a certain idempotent completion of the\nnon-commutative localization of the heart of $w$ by $S$. The latter is the\nnatural categorical version of Cohn's localizations of rings i.e. the functor\nconnecting hearts is universal among all the additive functors that make the\nelements of $S$ invertible.

Moreover, the simple functoriality\nproperties of dimensions clarify celebrated identities and extend them to new\ncontexts.\n  We observe that it is advantageous to calculate dimensions, traces and their\nfunctoriality directly in the nonlinear geometric setting of correspondence\ncategories, where they are directly identified with (derived versions of) loop\nspaces, fixed point loci and loop maps, respectively.

{"id": "1405.7719", "contents": "Title: Theoretical Prediction and Impact of Fundamental Electric Dipole Moments Abstract: The predicted Standard Model (SM) electric dipole moments (EDMs) of electrons\nand quarks are tiny, providing an important window to observe new physics.\nTheories beyond the SM typically allow relatively large EDMs. The EDMs depend\non the relative phases of terms in the effective Lagrangian of the extended\ntheory, which are generally unknown. Underlying theories, such as\nstring/M-theories compactified to four dimensions, could predict the phases and\nthus EDMs in the resulting supersymmetric (SUSY) theory. Earlier one of us,\nwith collaborators, made such a prediction and found, unexpectedly, that the\nphases were predicted to be zero at tree level in the theory at the unification\nor string scale $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{16}$ GeV). Electroweak (EW) scale EDMs\nstill arise via running from the high scale, and depend only on the SM Yukawa\ncouplings that also give the CKM phase. Here we extend the earlier work by\nstudying the dependence of the low scale EDMs on the constrained but not fully\nknown fundamental Yukawa couplings. The dominant contribution is from two loop\ndiagrams and is not sensitive to the choice of Yukawa texture. The electron EDM\nshould not be found to be larger than about $ 5\\times 10^{-30} e$ cm, and the\nneutron EDM should not be larger than about $5\\times 10^{-29}e$ cm. These\nvalues are quite a bit smaller than the reported predictions from Split SUSY\nand typical effective theories, but much larger than the Standard Model\nprediction. Also, since models with random phases typically give much larger\nEDMs, it is a significant testable prediction of compactified M-theory that the\nEDMs should not be above these upper limits. The actual EDMs can be below the\nlimits, so once they are measured they could provide new insight into the\nfundamental Yukawa couplings of leptons and quarks.

For several types of DM-Standard Model couplings, a\nmeaningful interpretation of the results requires to go beyond effective field\ntheory, considering simplified models with light mediators. This is especially\nimportant in the case of loop-mediated interactions. In this paper we perform\nthe first simplified model study of the magnetic dipole interacting DM, by\nincluding the one-loop momentum-dependent form factors that mediate the\ncoupling -- given by the Dark Penguin -- in collider processes. We compute\nbounds from the monojet, monophoton, and diphoton searches at the $8$ and $14$\nTeV LHC, and compare the results to those of direct and indirect detection\nexperiments. Future searches at the $100$ TeV hadron collider and at the ILC\nare also addressed. We find that the optimal search strategy requires loose\ncuts on the missing transverse energy, to capture the enhancement of the form\nfactors near the threshold for on-shell production of the mediators. We\nconsider both minimal models and models where an additional state beyond the DM\nis accessible. In the latter case, under the assumption of anarchic flavor\nstructure in the dark sector, the LHC monophoton and diphoton searches will be\nable to set much stronger bounds than in the minimal scenario. A determination\nof the mass of the heavier dark fermion might be feasible using the $M_{T2}$\nvariable. In addition, if the Dark Penguin flavor structure is almost aligned\nwith that of the DM mass, a displaced signal from the decay of the heavier dark\nfermion into the DM and photon can be observed. This allows us to set\nconstraints on the mixings and couplings of the model from an existing search\nfor non-pointing photons. \n\n"}

One\ncan then measure the temperature of a probe that is weakly coupled to a\nbias-driven system. By tuning the probe temperature so that the expectation\nvalue of some observable of the system is minimally perturbed, one obtains a\nparameter that measures its degree of local statistical excitation, and hence\nits local heating. However, one anticipates that different observables may lead\nto different temperatures and thus different local heating expectations. We\npropose an experimentally realizable protocol to measure such local\ntemperatures and apply it to bias-driven quantum dots. By means of a highly\naccurate open quantum system approach, we show theoretically that the measured\ntemperature is quite insensitive both to the choice of observable and to the\nprobe-system coupling. In particular, even with observables that are distinct\nboth physically and in their degree of locality, such as the local magnetic\nsusceptibility of the quantum dot and the global spin-polarized current\nmeasured at the leads, the resulting local temperatures are quantitatively\nsimilar for quantum dots ranging from noninteracting to Kondo-correlated\nregimes, and are close to those obtained with the traditional \"local\nequilibrium\" definition. \n\n"}

We first provide a\nLorentz decomposition of the HLbL tensor performed according to the general\nrecipe by Bardeen, Tung, and Tarrach, generalizing and extending our previous\napproach, which was constructed in terms of a basis of helicity amplitudes.\nSuch a tensor decomposition has several advantages: the role of gauge\ninvariance and crossing symmetry becomes fully transparent; the scalar\ncoefficient functions are free of kinematic singularities and zeros, and thus\nfulfill a Mandelstam double-dispersive representation; and the explicit\nrelation for the HLbL contribution to $(g-2)_\\mu$ in terms of the coefficient\nfunctions simplifies substantially.

It can also be formulated as a compelling\ncomponent of dark matter. The haloscope, a leading axion detection scheme,\nrelies on the conversion of galactic halo axions into real photons inside a\nresonant cavity structure in the presence of a static magnetic field, where the\ngenerated photon frequency corresponds to the mass of the axion. For maximum\nsensitivity it is key that the central frequency of the cavity mode structure\ncoincides with the frequency of the generated photon. As the mass of the axion\nis unknown, it is necessary to perform searches over a wide range of\nfrequencies. Currently there are substantial regions of the promising\npre-inflationary low mass axion range without any viable proposals for\nexperimental searches. We show that 3D resonant LC circuits with separated\nmagnetic and electric fields, commonly known as re-entrant cavities, can be\nsensitive dark matter haloscopes in this region, with frequencies inherently\nlower than those achievable in the equivalent size of empty resonant cavity. We\ncalculate the sensitivity and accessible axion mass range of these experiments,\ndesigning geometries to exploit and maximize the separated magnetic and\nelectric coupling of the axion to the cavity mode. \n\n"}

A standard transition is recovered for short range correlations.\nFor disorder decaying slower than $1/r^{2}$, the Weyl semimetal is unstable to\nany weak disorder and no transition persists. In between, a new phase\ntransition occurs. This transition still separates a disordered metal from a\nsemi-metal, but with a new critical behavior that we analyze to two-loop order. \n\n"}

The high density of hits on a given particle track facilitates the task\nof pattern recognition in a high-occupancy environment and in addition provides\nparticle identification by measuring the specific energy loss for each track.\nFor these reasons, TPCs with Multiwire Proportional Chamber (MWPC)\namplification have been and are widely used in experiments recording heavy-ion\ncollisions. A significant drawback, however, is the large dead time of the\norder of 1 ms per event generated by the use of a gating grid, which is\nmandatory to prevent ions created in the amplification region from drifting\nback into the drift volume, where they would severely distort the drift path of\nsubsequent tracks. For experiments with higher event rates this concept of a\nconventional TPC operating with a triggered gating grid can therefore not be\napplied without a significant loss of data. A continuous readout of the signals\nis the more appropriate way of operation. This, however, constitutes a change\nof paradigm with considerable challenges to be met concerning the amplification\nregion, the design and bandwidth of the readout electronics, and the data\nhandling. A mandatory prerequisite for such an operation is a sufficiently good\nsuppression of the ion backflow from the avalanche region, which otherwise\nlimits the tracking and particle identification capabilities of such a\ndetector. Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM) are a promising candidate to combine\nexcellent spatial resolution with an intrinsic suppression of ions. In this\npaper we describe the design, construction and the commissioning of a large TPC\nwith GEM amplification and without gating grid (GEM-TPC). \n\n"}

The identification of such jets is challenging due to the lack\nof track and vertex information in the pseudorapidity range $|\\eta|>2.5$. This\npaper presents a novel strategy for forward pile-up jet tagging that exploits\njet shapes and topological jet correlations in pile-up interactions.\nMeasurements of the per-jet tagging efficiency are presented using a data set\nof 3.2 $fb^{-1}$ of proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13\nTeV collected with the ATLAS detector.

The MPGD based TPC is currently\nplanned to be used as a central tracking detector of the International Large\nDetector (ILD), which is one of the detector concepts for the future\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC) project, and which requires fine azimuthal\nspatial resolution of less than 100 ${\\rm \\mu m}$ over the drift length of the\nTPC to attain high momentum resolution.

This\ninvolves two components of independent interest.\n  The first is the notion of a rigid hamiltonian torus action. This natural\ncondition, for torus actions on a Kaehler manifold, was introduced locally in\npart I, but such actions turn out to be remarkably well behaved globally,\nleading to a fairly explicit classification: up to a blow-up, compact Kaehler\nmanifolds with a rigid hamiltonian torus action are bundles of toric Kaehler\nmanifolds.\n  The second idea is a special case of toric geometry, which we call\northotoric. We prove that orthotoric Kaehler manifolds are diffeomorphic to\ncomplex projective space, but we extend our analysis to orthotoric orbifolds,\nwhere the geometry is much richer. We thus obtain new examples of\nKaehler--Einstein 4-orbifolds.\n  Combining these two themes, we prove that compact Kaehler manifolds with\nhamiltonian 2-forms are covered by blow-downs of projective bundles over\nKaehler products, and we describe explicitly how the Kaehler metrics with a\nhamiltonian 2-form are parameterized. We explain how this provides a context\nfor constructing new examples of extremal Kaehler metrics - in particular a\nsubclass of such metrics which we call weakly Bochner-flat.\n  We also provide a self-contained treatment of the theory of compact toric\nKaehler manifolds, since we need it and find the existing literature\nincomplete. \n\n"}
