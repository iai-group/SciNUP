We perform a detailed error analysis of the scheme and find that the\nhighest accuracy is found if no inversion of the usually ill conditioned\nhopping matrix is involved. Even in this case however a transformation of the\nhopping matrix that decreases its condition number is needed in order to limit\nthe size of the imaginary part of the wave-vectors. This is done in two\ndifferent ways, either by applying a singular value decomposition and setting a\nlowest bound for the smallest singular value, or by adding a random matrix of\nsmall amplitude. By using the first scheme the size of the Hamiltonian matrix\nis reduced, making the computation considerably faster for large systems. For\nmost energies the method gives high accuracy, however in the presence of\nsurface states the error diverges due to the singularity in the self-energy. A\nsurface state is found at a particular energy if the set of solution\neigenvectors of the infinite system is linearly dependent.

To\nthis end our ab initio quantum transport program ALACANT which combines the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF) with density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations has been extended to describe spin-polarized systems.\nWe present calculations on nanocontacts made of Ni as a prototypical magnetic\nmaterial. We find that atomic disorder in the contact region strongly reduces\nthe a priori high spin-polarization of the conductance leading to rather\nmoderate values of the so-called ballistic magnetoresistance (BMR). On the\nother hand, we show that the adsorption of oxygen in the contact region could\nstrongly enhance the spin-polarization of the conduction electrons and thus BMR\nby eliminating the spin-unpolarized s-channel. Finally, we show that short\natomic Pt chains suspended between the tips of a nanocontact are magnetic in\ncontrast to bulk Pt.

Phase-sensitive quasiparticle\ninterference (QPI) imaging and low temperature spectroscopy have shown that the\npairing order parameter varies from nodal to nodeless s\\pm within a single\nfamily, FeTe1-xSex.

The joint effect\nof this Zeeman-like spin-orbit coupling and the intervalley electron-optical\nphonon scattering opens a spin relaxation channel, which manifests itself in\nlow-mobility samples with the electron mean free path being smaller than the\nripple size.

However, it is not yet clear whether\ndephasing can enhance transport in an interacting many-body system. Here, we\naddress this question by analyzing the transport properties of a boundary\ndriven spinless fermion chain with nearest-neighbor interactions subject to\nbulk dephasing. The many-body nonequilibrium stationary state is determined\nusing large-scale matrix product simulations of the corresponding quantum\nmaster equation. We find dephasing enhanced transport only in the strongly\ninteracting regime, where it is shown to induce incoherent transitions bridging\nthe gap between bound dark states and bands of mobile eigenstates. The generic\nnature of the transport enhancement is illustrated by a simple toy model, which\ncontains the basic elements required for its emergence. Surprisingly, the\neffect is significant even in the linear response regime of the full system,\nand it is predicted to exist for any large and finite chain. The response of\nthe system to dephasing also establishes a signature of an underlying\nnonequilibrium phase transition between regimes of transport degradation and\nenhancement. The existence of this transition is shown not to depend on the\nintegrability of the model considered. As a result, dephasing enhanced\ntransport is expected to persist in more realistic nonequilibrium strongly\ncorrelated systems. \n\n"}

Such scaling is consistent with the Kibble-Zurek\nmechanism (KZM).

Scaling of the dispersion of W and of the\nprobability of detection of non-zero W with C can be also studied for loops so\nsmall that non-zero windings are rare.

Our theory uses the operator sum representation\nformalism in order to incorporate the incoherent dynamics caused by the\nadditional, Markovian bath, which in self-assembled dots is the vacuum field\nresponsible for electron-hole optical recombination. The beauty of this\nformalism is that it reduces the complexity of the problem by encoding the\njoint dynamics of the external coherent and incoherent driving in an effective\ndynamical map that only acts on the electron spin subspace. This together with\nthe separation of timescales in the problem allows for a tractable and\nanalytically solvable formalism. The key role of entanglement between the\nelectron spin and the nuclear spins in the formation of dynamic nuclear\npolarization naturally follows from our solution. We demonstrate the theory in\ndetail for an optical pulsed experiment and present an in-depth discussion and\nphysical explanation of our results. \n\n"}

Here we discuss weak localization and\nantilocalization of massless Dirac fermions in topological insulators and\nmassive Dirac fermions in Weyl semimetal thin films taking into account both\nintrinsic and extrinsic spin-orbit interactions. The physics is governed by the\ncomplex interplay of the chiral spin texture, quasiparticle mass, and scalar\nand spin-orbit scattering. We demonstrate that terms linear in the extrinsic\nspin-orbit scattering are generally present in the Bloch and momentum\nrelaxation times in all topological materials, and the correction to the\ndiffusion constant is linear in the strength of the extrinsic spin-orbit. In\nTIs, which have zero quasiparticle mass, the terms linear in the impurity\nspin-orbit coupling lead to an observable density dependence in the weak\nantilocalization correction. They produce substantial qualitative modifications\nto the magnetoconductivity, differing greatly from the conventional HLN formula\ntraditionally used in experimental fits, which predicts a crossover from weak\nlocalization to antilocalization as a function of the extrinsic spin-orbit\nstrength.

We study\nuniversal dynamics after a cooling quench, focusing on situations where the\ntime evolution represents a pure rescaling of spatial correlations, with time\ndefining the scale parameter. The non-equilibrium initial condition set by the\nquench induces a redistribution of particles in momentum space. Depending on\nconservation laws, this can take the form of a wave-turbulent flux or of a more\ngeneral self-similar evolution, signaling the critically slowed approach to a\nnon-thermal fixed point. We identify such fixed points using a non-perturbative\nkinetic theory of collective scattering between highly occupied long-wavelength\nmodes. In contrast, a wave-turbulent flux, possible in the perturbative\nBoltzmann regime, builds up in a critically accelerated self-similar manner. A\nkey result is the simple analytical universal scaling form of the\nnon-perturbative many-body scattering matrix, for which we lay out the concrete\nconditions under which it applies.

This discreteness reflects the quantum\nmechanical nature of spin.

The impurity contribution to the uniform part of the entanglement\nentropy, S_{imp}, is defined and analyzed in detail in both the gapless, J_2 <=\nJ_2^c, as well as the dimerized phase, J_2>J_2^c, of the model. This quantum\nimpurity model is in the universality class of the single channel Kondo model\nand it is shown that in a quite universal way the presence of the impurity in\nthe gapless phase, J_2 <= J_2^c, gives rise to a large length scale, xi_K,\nassociated with the screening of the impurity, the size of the Kondo screening\ncloud. The universality of Kondo physics then implies scaling of the form\nS_{imp}(r/xi_K,r/R) for a system of size R. Numerical results are presented\nclearly demonstrating this scaling. At the critical point, J_2^c, an analytic\nFermi liquid picture is developed and analytic results are obtained both at T=0\nand T>0. In the dimerized phase an appealing picure of the entanglement is\ndeveloped in terms of a thin soliton (TS) ansatz and the notions of impurity\nvalence bonds (IVB) and single particle entanglement (SPE) are introduced. The\nTS-ansatz permits a variational calculation of the complete entanglement in the\ndimerized phase that appears to be exact in the thermodynamic limit at the\nMajumdar-Ghosh point, J_2=J_1/2, and surprisingly precise even close to the\ncritical point J_2^c. In appendices the relation between the finite temperature\nentanglement entropy, S(T), and the thermal entropy, S_{th}(T), is discussed\nand <S^z_r> and <S_r S_{r+1}> calculated at the MG-point using the TS-ansatz. \n\n"}

We clarify the nature of the fermionic\nquasiparticles, and discuss the physical properties of this gapless phase of\nquark matter. The appearance of two \"secondary\" spin-1 condensates in the\ngapless ground state is pointed out. The gluon screening properties are also\ndiscussed. It is found that finite temperature properties of the gapless color\nsuperconductor are rather unusual. One of the most striking results is that the\nratio of the critical temperature to the gap at zero temperature is not a\nuniversal number. Moreover, this ratio could become arbitrarily large at some\nvalues of the coupling constant. In addition, the value of the gap parameter is\nnot a monotonic function of temperature, although the phase transition is a\nsecond order phase transition. In an extreme case, in fact, a nonzero finite\ntemperature gap can appear even if its zero temperature value is vanishing. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-th/9908149", "contents": "Title: Casimir Effect: The Classical Limit Abstract: We analyze the high temperature (or classical) limit of the Casimir effect. A\nuseful quantity which arises naturally in our discussion is the ``relative\nCasimir energy\", which we define for a configuration of disjoint conducting\nboundaries of arbitrary shapes, as the difference of Casimir energies between\nthe given configuration and a configuration with the same boundaries infinitely\nfar apart. Using path integration techniques, we show that the relative Casimir\nenergy vanishes exponentially fast in temperature. This is consistent with a\nsimple physical argument based on Kirchhoff's law. As a result the ``relative\nCasimir entropy\", which we define in an obviously analogous manner, tends, in\nthe classical limit, to a finite asymptotic value which depends only on the\ngeometry of the boundaries. Thus the Casimir force between disjoint pieces of\nthe boundary, in the classical limit, is entropy driven and is governed by a\ndimensionless number characterizing the geometry of the cavity. Contributions\nto the Casimir thermodynamical quantities due to each individual connected\ncomponent of the boundary exhibit logarithmic deviations in temperature from\nthe behavior just described. These logarithmic deviations seem to arise due to\nour difficulty to separate the Casimir energy (and the other thermodynamical\nquantities) from the ``electromagnetic'' self-energy of each of the connected\ncomponents of the boundary in a well defined manner. Our approach to the\nCasimir effect is not to impose sharp boundary conditions on the fluctuating\nfield, but rather take into consideration its interaction with the plasma of\n``charge carriers'' in the boundary, with the plasma frequency playing the role\nof a physical UV cutoff. This also allows us to analyze deviations from a\nperfect conductor behavior. \n\n"}
