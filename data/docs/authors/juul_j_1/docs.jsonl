With so many different\nmodels of scale-free networks it is unclear what properties of scale-free\nnetworks are typical, and what properties are peculiarities of a particular\ngrowth or construction process.

The proposed model represents agents, arranged in a\nnetwork and provided with an individual behavior, that change opinion in\nfunction of those of their neighbors. In particular, agents can behave as\nconformists or as nonconformists. In the former case, agents change opinion in\naccordance with the majority of their social circle (i.e., their neighbors); in\nthe latter case, they do the opposite, i.e., they take the minority opinion.\nMoreover, we investigate the nonconformity both on a global and on a local\nperspective, i.e., in relation to the whole population and to the social circle\nof each nonconformist agent, respectively.

The most popular way of detecting communities\nalgorithmically is to optimize the quality function known as modularity. When\noptimizing modularity, one compares the actual connections in a (static or\ntime-dependent) network to the connections obtained from a random-graph\nensemble that acts as a null model. The communities are then the sets of nodes\nthat are connected to each other densely relative to what is expected from the\nnull model. Clearly, the process of community detection depends fundamentally\non the choice of null model, so it is important to develop and analyze novel\nnull models that take into account appropriate features of the system under\nstudy. In this paper, we investigate the effects of using null models that take\nincorporate spatial information, and we propose a novel null model based on the\nradiation model of population spread.

In these\nsystems, interactions generally occur after specific delays associated to\ntransport, transmission or integration of information. We investigate here the\nimpact of anti-conformism combined to delays in the emergent dynamics of large\npopulations of mainstreams and hipsters. To this purpose, we introduce a class\nof simple statistical systems of interacting agents composed of (i) mainstreams\nand anti-conformists in the presence of (ii) delays, possibly heterogeneous, in\nthe transmission of information. In this simple model, each agent can be in one\nof two states, and can change state in continuous time with a rate depending on\nthe state of others in the past. We express the thermodynamic limit of these\nsystems as the number of agents diverge, and investigate the solutions of the\nlimit equation, with a particular focus on synchronized oscillations induced by\ndelayed interactions. We show that when hipsters are too slow in detecting the\ntrends, they will consistently make the same choice, and realizing this too\nlate, they will switch, all together to another state where they remain alike.\nSimilar synchronizations arise when the impact of mainstreams on hipsters\nchoices (and reciprocally) dominate the impact of other hipsters choices, and\nwe show that these may emerge only when the randomness in the hipsters\ndecisions is sufficiently large. Beyond the choice of the best suit to wear\nthis winter, this study may have important implications in understanding\nsynchronization of nerve cells, investment strategies in finance, or emergent\ndynamics in social science, domains in which delays of communication and the\ngeometry of information accessibility are prominent. \n\n"}

We consider a temporal network with N nodes as a\nsequence of T layers that describe the network during different time windows,\nand we couple centrality matrices for the layers into a supra-centrality matrix\nof size NTxNT whose dominant eigenvector gives the centrality of each node i at\neach time t.

We use the symbolic transfer entropy\nanalysis of micro-blogging time series to extract directed networks of\ninfluence among geolocalized sub-units in social systems. This methodology\ncaptures the emergence of system-level dynamics close to the onset of socially\nrelevant collective phenomena. The framework is validated against a detailed\nempirical analysis of five case studies. In particular, we identify a change in\nthe characteristic time-scale of the information transfer that flags the onset\nof information-driven collective phenomena. Furthermore, our approach\nidentifies an order-disorder transition in the directed network of influence\nbetween social sub-units. In the absence of a clear exogenous driving, social\ncollective phenomena can be represented as endogenously-driven structural\ntransitions of the information transfer network. This study provides results\nthat can help define models and predictive algorithms for the analysis of\nsocietal events based on open source data. \n\n"}

Our\nselected prototype, the category Bmod of modules over the Boolean semifield B\nis the replacement for the category of abelian groups. We show that the\nsemi-additive category Bmod fulfills analogues of the axioms AB1 and AB2 for\nabelian categories. By introducing a precise comonad on Bmod we obtain the\nconceptually related Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore categories. The latter\ncategory Bmod^s is simply Bmod in the topos of sets endowed with an involution\nand as such it shares with Bmod most of its abstract categorical properties.\nThe three main results of the paper are the following.

Second, there is a far\nreaching analogy between Bmod^s and the category of operators in Hilbert space,\nand in particular results relating null kernel and injectivity for morphisms.\nThe third fundamental result is that, even for finite objects of Bmod^s the\nresulting homological algebra is non-trivial and gives rise to a computable Ext\nfunctor.

{"id": "1706.04252", "contents": "Title: Complex Contagions with Timers Abstract: A great deal of effort has gone into trying to model social influence ---\nincluding the spread of behavior, norms, and ideas --- on networks. Most models\nof social influence tend to assume that individuals react to changes in the\nstates of their neighbors without any time delay, but this is often not true in\nsocial contexts, where (for various reasons) different agents can have\ndifferent response times. To examine such situations, we introduce the idea of\na timer into threshold models of social influence. The presence of timers on\nnodes delays the adoption --- i.e., change of state --- of each agent, which in\nturn delays the adoptions of its neighbors. With a homogeneous-distributed\ntimer, in which all nodes exhibit the same amount of delay, adoption delays are\nalso homogeneous, so the adoption order of nodes remains the same. However,\nheterogeneously-distributed timers can change the adoption order of nodes and\nhence the \"adoption paths\" through which state changes spread in a network.\nUsing a threshold model of social contagions, we illustrate that heterogeneous\ntimers can either accelerate or decelerate the spread of adoptions compared to\nan analogous situation with homogeneous timers, and we investigate the\nrelationship of such acceleration or deceleration with respect to timer\ndistribution and network structure. We derive an analytical approximation for\nthe temporal evolution of the fraction of adopters by modifying a pair\napproximation of the Watts threshold model, and we find good agreement with\nnumerical computations.

For this purpose, we first prove algebraic results and develop\nanalytic tools, which we then combine to study branched zeta functions. The\nalgebraic aspects concern universal properties for locality algebraic\nstructures, some of which had been discussed in previous work; we \"branch/\nlift\" to trees operators acting on the decoration set of trees, and factorise\nbranched maps through words by means of universal properties for words which we\nprove in the locality setup. The analytic tools are multivariate meromorphic\ngerms of pseudodifferential symbols with linear poles which generalise the\nmeromorphic germs of functions with linear poles studied in previous work.\nMultivariate meromorphic germs of pseudodifferential symbols form a locality\nalgebra on which we build various locality maps in the framework of locality\nstructures. We first show that the finite part at infinity defines a locality\ncharacter from the latter symbol valued meromorphic germs to the scalar valued\nones. We further equip the locality algebra of germs of pseudodifferential\nsymbols with locality Rota-Baxter operators given by regularised sums and\nintegrals.

The\nability of diffusion for a node is related to its own degree.

AVMs display rich behavior, including a phase\ntransition from a fully-fragmented regime of \"echo-chambers\" to a regime of\npersistent disagreement governed by low-dimensional quasistable manifolds. Many\nextant methods for approximating the behavior of AVMs are either restricted in\nscope, expensive in computation, or inaccurate in predicting important\nstatistics. In this work, we develop a novel, second-order moment closure\napproximation method for binary-state rewire-to-random and rewire-to-same model\nvariants. We incorporate a small amount of noise via a random mutation term,\nwhich renders the system ergodic.

We use an analytic uniformisation to derive the fundamental\nnilpotent De Rham torsor of a single elliptic curve in terms of a double Jacobi\nform introduced by Kronecker. We then extend this result to any smooth family,\nrelatively to the base, i.e., to the moduli stack $M_{1,2}$ over $M_{1,1}$.\nEverything relies on explicit formulas that turn out to be algebraic for\nrational (families of) elliptic curves, and we conclude by providing the\ncorresponding natural $\\QM$ structure. \n\n"}

We prove that for a fixed h, the moments are given by\nrational functions of k, up to a well-known factor that already arises when\nh=0. We fully describe the denominator in those rational functions (this had\nalready been done by Hughes experimentally), and define the numerators through\nvarious formulas, mostly sums over partitions. We also use this to formulate\nconjectures on joint moments of the zeta function and its derivatives, or even\nthe same questions for the Hardy function, if we use a ``real'' version of\ncharacteristic polynomials. Our methods should easily be applicable to other\nsimilar problems, for instance with higher derivatives of characteristic\npolynomials.\n  NOTE: More data is available on the author's website or attached to the LaTeX\nsource of this arXiv submission. \n\n"}

{"id": "math/9901051", "contents": "Title: Scattering on the p-adic field and a trace formula Abstract: I apply the set-up of Lax-Phillips Scattering Theory to a non-archimedean\nlocal field. It is possible to choose the outgoing space and the incoming space\nto be Fourier transforms of each other. Key elements of the Lax-Phillips theory\nare seen to make sense and to have the expected interrelations: the scattering\nmatrix S, the projection K to the interacting space, the contraction semi-group\nZ and the time delay operator T. The scattering matrix is causal, its analytic\ncontinuation has the expected poles and zeros, and its phase derivative is the\n(non-negative) spectral function of T, which is also the restriction to the\ndiagonal of the kernel of K. The contraction semi-group Z is related to S (and\nT) through a trace formula. Introducing an odd-even grading on the interacting\nspace allows to express the Weil local explicit formula in terms of a\n``supertrace''. I also apply my methods to the evaluation of a trace considered\nby Connes. \n\n"}
