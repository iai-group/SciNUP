Based on\ntheoretical arguments and simulation results it has previously been suggested\nthat a large core radius -- or particularly a large ratio of the core radius to\nhalf-mass radius -- is a promising indicator for finding such a black hole in a\nstar cluster. In this study N-body models of 100000 stars with and without\nprimordial binaries are used to investigate the long-term structural evolution\nof star clusters. Importantly, the simulation data is analysed using the same\nprocesses by which structural parameters are extracted from observed star\nclusters. This gives a ratio of the core and half-mass (or half-light) radii\nthat is directly comparable to the Galactic globular cluster sample. As a\nresult, it is shown that the ratios observed for the bulk of this sample can be\nexplained without the need for an intermediate-mass black hole. Furthermore, it\nis possible that clusters with large core to half-light radius ratios harbour a\nblack-hole binary (comprised of stellar mass black holes) rather than a single\nmassive black hole.

Here we give an explicit demonstration for very\nrestricted metric forms of (Schwarzschild and Kerr) vacuum black holes. In the\nKerr-Schild coordinate expression for these spacetimes they have an explicit\nLorentz-invariant form. We consider {\\it boosted} versions with the black hole\nmoving through the coordinate system. Since these are stationary black hole\nspacetimes, the apparent horizons are two dimensional cross sections of their\nevent horizons, so we compute the areas of apparent horizons in the boosted\nspace with (boosted) $ t = constant $, and obtain the same result as in the\nunboosted case.

Even with these restrictions\nwe find that the results illuminate the physics of the horizon as a null\nsurface and provide a useful pedagogical tool.

There is\nalso evidence that CaII absorbers trace galaxies with more ongoing\nstar-formation than the average quasar absorber. Despite this, relatively\nlittle is known in detail about these unusual absorption systems. Here we\npresent the first high resolution spectroscopic study of 19 CaII quasar\nabsorbers, in the range 0.6<= z_abs<=1.2, with W3934>=0.2A. Their general\ndepletion patterns are similar to measurements in the warm halo phase of the\nMilky Way and Magellanic Clouds ISM. Dust depletions and alpha-enrichments\nprofiles of sub-samples of 7 and 3 absorbers, respectively, are measured using\na combination of Voigt profile fitting and apparent optical depth techniques.\nDeviations in [Cr/Zn]~0.3+-0.1dex and in [Si/Fe]>~0.8+-0.1dex are detected\nacross the profile of one absorber, which we attribute to differential dust\ndepletion. The remaining absorbers have <0.3dex (3sigma limit) variation in\n[Cr/Zn], much like the general DLA population, though the dustiest CaII\nabsorbers remain relatively unprobed in our sample. A limit on electron\ndensities in CaII absorbers, n_e<0.1cm^-3, is derived using the ratio of\nneutral and singly ionised species, assuming a MW-like radiation field. These\nelectron densities may imply hydrogen densities sufficient for the presence of\nmolecular hydrogen in the absorbers. The CaII absorber sample comprises a wide\nrange of velocity widths, v_90=50-470km/s, and velocity structures, thus a\nrange of physical models for their origin, from simple discs to galactic\noutflows and mergers, would be required to explain the observations. \n\n"}

In this sense the\n2D Ising model is said to be \"complete\". However, in order to obtain the above\nresult, the coupling strengths on the 2D lattice must assume complex values,\nand thus do not allow for a physical interpretation. Here we show how a\ncomplete model with real -and, hence, \"physical\"- couplings can be obtained if\nthe 3D Ising model is considered. We furthermore show how to map general\nq-state systems with possibly many-body interactions to the 2D Ising model with\ncomplex parameters, and give completeness results for these models with real\nparameters. We also demonstrate that the computational overhead in these\nconstructions is in all relevant cases polynomial.

We adopt a four-dimensional perspective in which the\nlocalized degrees of freedom on the brane are regarded as an open quantum\nsystem coupled to the large environment composed of the Anti-de Sitter ($AdS$)\nbulk gravitons. Due to the non-uniform expansion of the universe, the brane\ndegrees of freedom and the bulk degrees of freedom interact as they propagate\nforward in time, leading to an effective dissipation as well as a nonlocality\nfrom the four-dimensional point of view of an observer on the brane. Using both\nthe \"bare\" retarded propagator on the brane and the retarded propagator in the\nbulk, we compute the effective propagator on the brane for the \"dressed\" brane\nmodes by resumming the bulk backreaction effects at all order in the brane-bulk\ncoupling.

This generalizes the BCFW recursion relation\nfor tree amplitudes to all loop orders, and extends the Grassmannian duality\nfor leading singularities to the full amplitude. It also provides a new\nphysical picture for the meaning of loops, associated with canonical operations\nfor removing particles in a Yangian-invariant way. Loop amplitudes arise from\nthe \"entangled\" removal of pairs of particles, and are naturally presented as\nan integral over lines in momentum-twistor space. As expected from manifest\nYangian-invariance, the integrand is given as a sum over non-local terms,\nrather than the familiar decomposition in terms of local scalar integrals with\nrational coefficients. Knowing the integrands explicitly, it is straightforward\nto express them in local forms if desired; this turns out to be done most\nnaturally using a novel basis of chiral, tensor integrals written in\nmomentum-twistor space, each of which has unit leading singularities. As simple\nillustrative examples, we present a number of new multi-loop results written in\nlocal form, including the 6- and 7-point 2-loop NMHV amplitudes.

The absence of a\ncontemporaneous X-ray rebrightening and the evidence of a strong spectral\nevolution in the optical-NIR bands during the rise suggest two separate\ncomponents that dominate in the early and late-time lightcurves, respectively.\nThe steepness of the optical rise cannot be explained even in the framework of\nthe alternative scenarios proposed in the literature unless a late-time\nactivity of the central engine is assumed. \n\n"}

Optical spectra and g-band images were observed in 2005 using the\n2.4m telescope at MDM Observatory. Integrated emission-line flux variations\nwere measured for Ha, Hb, Hg, and for HeII4686, as well as g-band fluxes and\nthe optical AGN continuum at 5100A. The g-band fluxes and the AGN continuum\nvary simultaneously within the uncertainties, tau=(0.2+-1.1)days. We find that\nthe emission-line variations are delayed with respect to the variable g-band\ncontinuum by tau(Ha)=56.3(+2.4-6.6)days, tau(Hb)=44.3(+3.0_-3.3)days,\ntau(Hg)=58.1(+4.3-6.1)days, and tau(HeII4686)=22.3(+6.5-3.8)days. The blue and\nred peak in the double peaked line profiles, as well as the blue and red outer\nprofile wings, vary simultaneously within +-3 days. This provides strong\nsupport for gravitationally bound orbital motion of the dominant part of the\nline emitting gas. Combining the time delay of Ha and Hb and the separation of\nthe blue and red peak in the broad double-peaked profiles in their rms spectra,\nwe determine Mbh_vir=1.77(+0.29-0.31)x10^8Msol and using sigma_line of the rms\nspectra Mbh_vir=2.60(+0.23-0.31)x10^8Msol for the central black hole of\n3C390.3, respectively.

Our\narguments are based on nearly-resonant interactions of the R mode with pairs of\n\"daughter modes\". The amplitude of the R mode saturates at the lowest value for\nwhich parametric instability leads to significant excitation of a particular\npair of daughters. The lower bound on this limiting amplitude is proportional\nto the damping rate of the daughter modes that are excited parametrically.\nBased on this picture, we show that if modes damp because of dissipation in a\nvery thin boundary layer at the crust-core boundary then spin up to frequencies\nlarger than about 300 Hz does not occur. Within this conventional scenario the\nR mode saturates at an amplitude that is too large for angular momentum gain\nfrom accretion to overcome gravitational loss to gravitational radiation. We\nconclude that lower dissipation is required for spin up to frequencies much\nhigher than 300 Hz. We conjecture that if the transition from the fluid core to\nthe crystalline crust occurs over a distance much longer than 1 cm then a sharp\nviscous boundary layer fails to form. In this case, damping is due to shear\nviscosity dissipation integrated over the entire star; the rate is slower than\nif a viscous boundary layer forms. We use statistical arguments and scaling\nrelations to estimate the lowest parametric instability threshold from first\nprinciples. The resulting saturation amplitudes are low enough to permit spin\nup to higher frequencies. Further, we show that the requirement that the lowest\nparametric instability amplitude be small enough to allow continued spin up\nimposes an upper bound to the frequencies that may be attained via accretion\nthat may plausibly be about 750 Hz.

The origin of the macroeconomic\ndynamics is therefore found in the granularity induced by the wealth / capital\nof the wealthiest investors. - Economic cycles consist of a Schumpeter\n'creative destruction' pattern whereby the maxima are cusp-shaped while the\nminima are smooth. In between the cusps, the cycle consists of the sum of 2\n'crossing exponentials': one decaying and the other increasing.\n  This unification within the same theoretical framework of short term market\nfluctuations and long term economic cycles offers the perspective of a genuine\nconceptual synthesis between micro- and macroeconomics.

We investigate this scenario in depth using 42 relativistic\n2D simulations with multi-group neutrino transport to examine the effects of\nvelocity and density perturbations in the progenitor for different perturbation\ngeometries that obey fundamental physical constraints (like the anelastic\ncondition). As a framework for analysing our results, we introduce\nsemi-empirical scaling laws relating neutrino heating, average turbulent\nvelocities in the gain region, and the shock deformation in the saturation\nlimit of non-radial instabilities. The squared turbulent Mach number, <Ma^2>,\nreflects the violence of aspherical motions in the gain layer, and explosive\nrunaway occurs for <Ma^2>~0.3, corresponding to a reduction of the critical\nneutrino luminosity by ~25% compared to 1D.

The\nanisotropic mass flux and ram pressure deform the shock and thereby amplify\npost-shock turbulence. Large-scale (l=2,l=1) modes prove most conducive to\nshock revival, whereas small-scale perturbations require unrealistically high\nconvective Mach numbers.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which models sequence\ndynamics, has attracted increasing attention on visual interpretation. However,\nmost existing approaches generate a word locally with given previous words and\nthe visual content, while the relationship between sentence semantics and\nvisual content is not holistically exploited. As a result, the generated\nsentences may be contextually correct but the semantics (e.g., subjects, verbs\nor objects) are not true.\n  This paper presents a novel unified framework, named Long Short-Term Memory\nwith visual-semantic Embedding (LSTM-E), which can simultaneously explore the\nlearning of LSTM and visual-semantic embedding. The former aims to locally\nmaximize the probability of generating the next word given previous words and\nvisual content, while the latter is to create a visual-semantic embedding space\nfor enforcing the relationship between the semantics of the entire sentence and\nvisual content. Our proposed LSTM-E consists of three components: a 2-D and/or\n3-D deep convolutional neural networks for learning powerful video\nrepresentation, a deep RNN for generating sentences, and a joint embedding\nmodel for exploring the relationships between visual content and sentence\nsemantics.

We use the\nso-called replica trick to define two different generating functionals for\ncalculating correlators of the quantum fields averaged over a given\ndistribution of random potentials. The first generating functional is\nappropriate for calculating averaged (in-out) amplitudes and involves a single\nreplica of fields, but the replica limit is taken to an (unphysical) negative\none number of fields outside of the path integral.

From the vertex function we\nextract the effective quark-gluon coupling and show that it grows with\nincreasing magnetic field strength. The effect is due to a subtle competition\nbetween the color charge associated to gluons and the color charge associated\nto quarks, the former being larger than the latter. In contrast, at high\ntemperature the effective thermo-magnetic coupling results exclusively from the\ncontribution of the color charge associated to quarks. This produces a decrease\nof the coupling with increasing field strength. We interpret the results in\nterms of a geometrical effect whereby the magnetic field induces, on average, a\ncloser distance between the (electrically charged) quarks and antiquarks. At\nhigh temperature, since the effective coupling is proportional only to the\ncolor charge associated to quarks, such proximity with increasing field\nstrength makes the effective coupling decrease due to asymptotic freedom. In\nturn, this leads to a decreasing quark condensate. In contrast, at zero\ntemperature both the effective strong coupling and the quark condensate\nincrease with increasing magnetic field. This is due to the color charge\nassociated to gluons dominating over that associated to quarks, with both\nhaving the opposite sign. Thus, the gluons induce a kind of screening of the\nquark color charge, in spite of the quark-antiquark proximity. The implications\nof these results for the inverse magnetic catalysis phenomenon are discussed. \n\n"}

That said, it could nonetheless be helpful to\nbriefly elaborate. Starting from the observation that quantum physics\nunavoidably has to deal with high dimensional objects, basically two routes can\nbe taken: either try and reduce their study to that of lower dimensional ones,\nor try and understand what kind of universal properties might precisely emerge\nin this regime. We actually do not choose which of these two attitudes to\nfollow here, and rather oscillate between one and the other. In the first part\nof this manuscript, our aim is to reduce as much as possible the complexity of\ncertain quantum processes, while of course still preserving their essential\ncharacteristics. The two types of processes we are interested in are quantum\nchannels and quantum measurements. Oppositely, the second part of this\nmanuscript is specifically dedicated to the analysis of high dimensional\nquantum systems and some of their typical features.

Our\nselected prototype, the category Bmod of modules over the Boolean semifield B\nis the replacement for the category of abelian groups. We show that the\nsemi-additive category Bmod fulfills analogues of the axioms AB1 and AB2 for\nabelian categories. By introducing a precise comonad on Bmod we obtain the\nconceptually related Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore categories. The latter\ncategory Bmod^s is simply Bmod in the topos of sets endowed with an involution\nand as such it shares with Bmod most of its abstract categorical properties.\nThe three main results of the paper are the following. First, when endowed with\nthe natural ideal of null morphisms, the category Bmod^s is a semi-exact,\nhomological category in the sense of M. Grandis.

Through a study real Compton scattering, we explore\nthe constraints that the Majorana fermion's self-conjugate nature has on\ninduced moments. In terms of the Compton amplitude, we find no constraints if\nthe interactions are separately invariant under charge conjugation, parity, and\ntime reversal.

There is a trace map from algebraic\n$K$-theory to topological cyclic homology, and a theorem of\nDundas--Goodwillie--McCarthy asserts that this induces an equivalence of\nrelative theories for nilpotent immersions, which gives a way for computing\n$K$-theory in various situations. The construction of topological cyclic\nhomology is based on genuine equivariant homotopy theory, the use of explicit\npoint-set models, and the elaborate notion of a cyclotomic spectrum.\n  The goal of this paper is to revisit this theory using only\nhomotopy-invariant notions. In particular, we give a new construction of\ntopological cyclic homology. This is based on a new definition of the\n$\\infty$-category of cyclotomic spectra: We define a cyclotomic spectrum to be\na spectrum $X$ with $S^1$-action (in the most naive sense) together with\n$S^1$-equivariant maps $\\varphi_p: X\\to X^{tC_p}$ for all primes $p$.

The contributions of this paper are threefold. First,\nwe design strong yet flexible visual features that encode the appearance and\nspatial configuration for pairs of objects.

In the\nlimit of flavour number $N \\to 1/2$ it is equivalent to the Gross-Neveu model,\nwhich shows a parity-breaking discrete phase transition. The model was already\nstudied with different methods, including Dyson-Schwinger equations, functional\nrenormalisation group methods and lattice simulations. Most studies agree that\nthere is a phase transition from a symmetric phase to a spontaneously broken\nphase for a small number of fermion flavours, but no symmetry breaking for\nlarge $N$. But there is no consensus on the critical flavour number\n$N^\\text{cr}$ above which there is no phase transition anymore and on further\ndetails of the critical behaviour.

The theme is the study of categories via algebraic techniques,\nconsidering categories themselves as algebraic objects. This algebraic approach\nto category theory is central to noncommutative algebraic geometry, as realized\nby recent advances in the study of noncommutative motives.\n  We have success proving algebraic results in the general setting of symmetric\nmonoidal and semiring $\\infty$-categories, which categorify abelian groups and\nrings, respectively. For example, we prove that modules over the semiring\ncategory Fin of finite sets are cocartesian monoidal $\\infty$-categories, and\nmodules over Burn (the Burnside $\\infty$-category) are additive\n$\\infty$-categories.\n  As a consequence, we can regard Lawvere theories as cyclic\n$\\text{Fin}^\\text{op}$-modules, leading to algebraic foundations for the higher\ncategorical study of Lawvere theories. We prove that Lawvere theories function\nas a home for an algebraic Yoneda lemma.\n  Finally, we provide evidence for a formal duality between naive and genuine\nequivariant homotopy theory, in the form of a group-theoretic Eilenberg-Watts\nTheorem.

Despite\nthe plethora of benchmark studies, the accuracy of a quantum chemical method is\noften difficult to assess. Moreover, a significant improvement of a method's\naccuracy (e.g., through reparameterization or systematic model extension) is\nrarely possible.

We simulate images for an\nelongated-pupil telescope and for a circular-pupil telescope of equal aperture\narea and integration time, investigating specifically what is the maximal\ncontrast for finding faint companions around bright stars as a function of\nangular separation. We show that this design gives better contrast at lower\nseparation from a bright star.

Abstract: Galaxies are often used as tracers of the large scale structure (LSS) to\nmeasure the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) by cross-correlating the galaxy\nsurvey maps with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map. We use the Cosmic\nInfrared Background (CIB) as a tracer of the LSS to perform a theoretical\nCIB-CMB cross-correlation to measure the ISW for different Planck HFI\nfrequencies. We discuss the detectability of this ISW signal using a\nSignal-to-noise ratio analysis and find that the ISW detected this way can\nprovide us with the highest SNR for a single tracer ranging from 5 to 6.7\n(maximum being for 857 GHz) with the CIB and CMB maps extracted over the whole\nsky.

Equilibrium correlations in fluids provide an\nextensively studied paradigmatic case, in which their range is typically\nbounded by the correlation length. Out of equilibrium, conservation laws have\nbeen found to extend correlations beyond this length, leading, instead, to\nalgebraic decays. In this context, here we present a systematic study of the\ncorrelations and forces in fluids driven out of equilibrium simultaneously by\nquenching and shearing, both for non-conserved as well as for conserved\nLangevin-type dynamics. We identify which aspects of the correlations are due\nto shear, due to quenching, and due to simultaneously applying both, and how\nthese properties depend on the correlation length of the system and its\ncompressibility. Both shearing and quenching lead to long-ranged correlations,\nwhich, however, differ in their nature as well as in their prefactors, and\nwhich are mixed up by applying both perturbations. These correlations are\nemployed to compute non-equilibrium fluctuation-induced forces in the presence\nof shear, with or without quenching, thereby generalizing the framework set out\nby Dean and Gopinathan.

In our model, we assume\nthat the non-thermal radiation spectra observed in OVV quasars are produced by\nrelativistic electrons/positrons accelerated in thin shells which propagate\ndown the jet with relativistic speeds. We show that the Comptonization of the\nnear-IR flux is likely to dominate the radiative output of OVV quasars in the\nenergy range from tens of keV up to hundreds of MeV, where it exceeds that\nproduced by Comptonization of the UV radiation reprocessed and rescattered in\nthe Broad Emission Line region. The main reason for this lies in the fact that\nthe jet encounters the ambient IR radiation over a relatively large distance as\ncompared to the distance where the energy density of the broad emission line\nlight peaks.

Abstract: VLT spectra of 14 luminous compact galaxies (LCGs) reveal strong metallic\nabsorption line sytems as well as narrow and intense emission lines. Their gas\nextinction is found to be large (Av ~ 1.5 mag) leading to an upward revision of\ntheir star formation rate (SFR) to an average value of ~ 40 Mo/yr. Large\nextinction values are also supported by the large rate of detection in one\nfield observed by ISO. Gas metal abundances in LCGs have about half the solar\nvalue. We argue that LCGs are the progenitors of present-day spiral bulges.\nLCGs have masses and light concentrations similar to those of present-day\nbulges. As in present-day galactic bulges, LCG stars show a wide range of\nabundances. Thus, observing LCGs allows us to directly witness an important\nstage in the formation of a massive galaxy, the building of the bulge prior to\nthat of the disk. The gas needed to feed the observed star formation is likely\nto be falling in from the outskirts of the galaxy, being tidally pulled out\nfrom interacting companion galaxies. Some LCGs also show evidence for the\nbeginning of a disk formation. If the above scenario holds for most LCGs, we\nestimate that at least 20% of present-day spiral galaxies have formed the bulk\nof their stars at relatively recent epochs, during the last 8-9 Gyr, at\nredshifts less than ~ 1. Since they are heavily extincted, we predict their IR\nluminosities to be relatively large, around Lir = 10^11 Lsun, i.e. near or\nslightly below the luminosities of the galaxies detected by ISO in the same\nredshift range. Taking into account the integrated IR luminosity of the LCG\ngalaxy population can lead to a significant upward revision of the cosmic SFR\ndensity in the redshift range from 0.5 to 1. \n\n"}

Such models have received recent interest because the excess power in\nthe large-scale galaxy distribution is phenomenologically fit if the ``shape\nparameter\" Gamma=h Omega_0 is about 0.25. It has been argued that such models\nmay require early reionization to suppress small-scale anisotropies in order to\nbe consistent with experimental data. We find that if the cosmological constant\nlambda=0, the extent of this suppression is quite insensitive to Omega_0. Given\na sigma_8-normalization today, the loss of small-scale power associated with a\nlower Omega_0 is partially canceled by higher optical depth from longer\nlookback times and by structures forming at higher redshifts before the\nuniverse becomes curvature-dominated. The maximum angular scale on which\nfluctuations are suppressed decreases when Omega_0 is lowered, but this effect\nis also rather weak and unlikely to be measurable in the near future. For flat\nmodels, on the other hand, where lambda_0 = 1-Omega_0, the negative effects of\nlowering Omega_0 dominate, and early reionization is not likely to play a\nsignificant role if Omega_0<<1.

First, a space-time in which every causal curve can be\nextended into a closed causal curve is singularity free--a necessary property\nof a globally applicable physical theory.

Analogously to the B -> 3pi channel and\nthe extraction of 2alpha, the first three channels are shown to measure\ncos(2beta) in addition to sin(2beta), thus allowing to resolve the beta -> pi/2\n-beta ambiguity, while the DpiK_S final state leads to a measurement of\n2beta+gamma. The B0(t) -> D+D-pi0 channel via the interference between D**\norbitally excited resonances is taken as an example, although this\nCabibbo-suppressed decay suffers from irreducible penguin uncertainties. Then\ntwo penguin-free and Cabibbo-dominant modes are proposed: B0(t) -> D+D-K_S with\nthe D_s** resonances, and B0(t) -> D0_CP pi+pi- with the D** plus the rho.\nFinally, the B0(t) -> D+-pi-+K_S channel with the D_s** and K* resonances\nprovides a new clean method to measure the unusual angle 2beta+gamma.

{"id": "hep-th/0312117", "contents": "Title: Massive Gravity on a Brane Abstract: At present no theory of a massive graviton is known that is consistent with\nexperiments at both long and short distances. The problem is that consistency\nwith long distance experiments requires the graviton mass to be very small.\nSuch a small graviton mass however implies an ultraviolet cutoff for the theory\nat length scales far larger than the millimeter scale at which gravity has\nalready been measured. In this paper we attempt to construct a model which\navoids this problem. We consider a brane world setup in warped AdS spacetime\nand we investigate the consequences of writing a mass term for the graviton on\na the infrared brane where the local cutoff is of order a large (galactic)\ndistance scale. The advantage of this setup is that the low cutoff for physics\non the infrared brane does not significantly affect the predictivity of the\ntheory for observers localized on the ultraviolet brane. For such observers the\npredictions of this theory agree with general relativity at distances smaller\nthan the infrared scale but go over to those of a theory of massive gravity at\nlonger distances. A careful analysis of the graviton two-point function,\nhowever, reveals the presence of a ghost in the low energy spectrum. A mode\ndecomposition of the higher dimensional theory reveals that the ghost\ncorresponds to the radion field. We also investigate the theory with a brane\nlocalized mass for the graviton on the ultraviolet brane, and show that the\nphysics of this case is similar to that of a conventional four dimensional\ntheory with a massive graviton, but with one important difference: when the\ninfrared brane decouples and the would-be massive graviton gets heavier than\nthe regular Kaluza--Klein modes, it becomes unstable and it has a finite width\nto decay off the brane into the continuum of Kaluza-Klein states. \n\n"}
