Convection and the advective-acoustic cycle in the supernova\n  core Abstract: By 2D hydrodynamic simulations including a detailed equation of state and\nneutrino transport, we investigate the interplay between different non-radial\nhydrodynamic instabilities that play a role during the postbounce accretion\nphase of collapsing stellar cores. The convective mode of instability, which is\ndriven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by time\nvariations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the development\nof typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in the\npostshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth of\nsuch a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shocked\nflow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growth\nof the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shock\ninstability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can trigger\nconvective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of the\naverage shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamic\ninstabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through the\nneutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition in\nsupport of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting and\nmore compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because the\naccretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of the\nSASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and a\nvariety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for the\nadvective-acoustic cycle (AAC), in which perturbations are carried by the\naccretion flow from the shock to the neutron star and pressure waves close an\namplifying global feedback loop.

Thus, these neutrinos can\nbe a striking dark matter signature at neutrino telescopes looking towards the\nSun and/or the Earth. Here, we improve previous analyses on computing the\nneutrino yields from WIMP annihilations in several respects. We include\nneutrino oscillations in a full three-flavor framework as well as all effects\nfrom neutrino interactions on the way through the Sun (absorption, energy loss,\nand regeneration from tau decays).

We\nstudy two observational signatures related to the instability of trajectories.\nFirst, we find an additional power-law dependence of the tunneling probability\non the semiclassical parameter as compared to the standard case of potential\ntunneling. The second signature is substantial widening of the probability\ndistribution over final-state quantum numbers. These effects are studied using\nmodified semiclassical technique which incorporates stabilization of the\ntunneling trajectories. The technique is derived from first principles. We\nobtain expressions for the inclusive and exclusive tunneling probabilities in\nthe case of unstable semiclassical trajectories. We also investigate the \"phase\ntransition\" between the cases of stable and unstable trajectories across\ncertain \"critical\" value of energy. Finally, we derive the relation between the\nsemiclassical probabilities of tunneling from the low-lying and highly excited\ninitial states.

This has been\nachieved in one of two distinct ways: (1) by initializing the system in a\nquantum entangled state, and/or (2) by applying quantum communication channels.\nIn this paper, we explain why some of these prior claims are misleading, in the\nsense that they rely on changes to the model unrelated to quantum processing.\nOn the positive side, we consider the aforementioned quantum extensions when\napplied to Linial's well-established LOCAL model of distributed computing.\n  For both types of extensions, we put forward valid proof-of-concept examples\nof distributed problems whose round complexity is in fact reduced through\ngenuinely quantum effects, in contexts which do not depend on the anonymity of\nnodes.\n  Finally, we show that even the quantum variants of the LOCAL model have\nnon-trivial limitations, captured by a very simple (purely probabilistic)\nnotion which we call \"physical locality\" (PLOCAL).

Second, we give a quantum algorithm for evaluating span\nprograms with only a logarithmic query overhead on the witness size.\n  The first result is motivated by a quantum algorithm for evaluating composed\nspan programs. The algorithm is known to be optimal for evaluating a large\nclass of formulas. The allowed gates include all constant-size functions for\nwhich there is an optimal span program.

The neutrinos emitted from the remnant at the\ncenter, the protoneutron star (PNS), heat the material above the PNS surface.\nThis heat is partly converted into kinetic energy and the material accelerates\nto an outflow that is known as the neutrino driven wind. For the first time, we\nsimulate the collapse, bounce, explosion and the neutrino driven wind phases\nconsistently over more than 20 seconds. Our numerical model is based on\nspherically symmetric general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics using\nspectral three flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport. In simulations where no\nexplosions are obtained naturally, we model neutrino driven explosions for low\nand intermediate mass Fe-core progenitor stars by enhancing the charged current\nreaction rates. In the case of a special progenitor star, the O-Ne-Mg-core, the\nexplosion in spherical symmetry was obtained without enhanced opacities. The\npost explosion evolution is in qualitative agreement with static steady-state\nand parametrized dynamic models of the neutrino driven wind. On the other hand,\nwe find generally smaller neutrino luminosities and mean neutrino energies as\nwell as a different evolutionary behavior of the neutrino luminosities and mean\nneutrino energies. The neutrino driven wind is proton-rich for more than 10\nseconds and the contraction of the PNS differs from the assumptions made for\nthe conditions at the inner boundary in previous neutrino driven wind studies.\nDespite the moderately large entropies per baryon of about 100 and the fast\nexpansion timescale, the conditions found in our model are unlikely to favor... \n\n"}

This phase can be understood, either as emerging from the\nmeasurements, or preexisting to them; in the latter case, the originating\nstates could be phase states with unknown phases, so that an average over all\ntheir possible values is taken. Both points of view lead to a description of\nprobabilities of results of experiments in terms of a phase angle, which plays\nthe role of a classical variable. Nevertheless, in some situations, this\ndescription is not sufficient: another variable, which we call the \"quantum\nangle\", emerges from the theory. This article studies various manifestations of\nthe quantum angle. We first introduce the quantum angle by expressing two Fock\nstates crossing a beam splitter in terms of phase states, and relate the\nquantum angle to off-diagonal matrix elements in the phase representation. Then\nwe consider an experiment with two beam splitters, where two experimenters make\ndichotomic measurements with two interferometers and detectors that are far\napart; the results lead to violations of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt\ninequality (valid for local-realistic theories, including classical\ndescriptions of the phase). Finally, we discuss an experiment where particles\nfrom each of two sources are either deviated via a beam splitter to a side\ncollector or proceed to the point of interference. For a given interference\nresult, we find \"population oscillations\" in the distributions of the deviated\nparticles, which are entirely controlled by the quantum angle. Various versions\nof population oscillation experiments are discussed, with two or three\nindependent condensates. \n\n"}

As a specific example, we consider a model with gauged B - L_e - 2\nL_tau number that contains an extremely light new vector boson m_Z' < 10^-18 eV\nand extraordinarily weak coupling alpha' < 10^-52. In that case, differences\nbetween nu_mu to nu_tau and anti-nu_mu to anti-nu_tau oscillations can result\nfrom a long-range potential due to neutrons in the Earth and the Sun that\ndistinguishes nu_mu and nu_tau on Earth, with a potential difference of ~\n6*10^-14 eV, and changes sign for anti-neutrinos.

The choice\nof an authentication protocol must consider that quantum states are very\ndelicate and that the channel is subject to eavesdropping. However, even in\nface of the various existing definitions of quantum authentication protocols in\nthe literature, little is known about them in this perspective, and this lack\nof knowledge may unfavor comparisons and wise choices. In the attempt to\novercome this limitation, in the present work we aim at showing an approach to\nevaluate quantum authentication protocols based on the determination of their\nquantum communication complexity.

The\naverage matter density along the Tokai-to-Kamioka baseline is found to be 2.6\ng/cm^3, and that for the Tokai-to-Korea baseline is 2.85, 2.98, and 3.05 g/cm^3\nfor the baseline length of L = 1000, 1100, and 1200 km, respectively. The\nuncertainty of the average density is about 6%, which is determined by the\nuncertainty in the correlation between the accurately measured sound velocity\nand the matter density. The effect of the matter density distribution along the\nbaseline is studied by using the step function approximation and the Fourier\nanalysis.

Abstract: Following a simulation approach of recent publications we explore the\nviability of the neutrino-heating explosion mechanism in dependence on the\nspatial dimension. Our results disagree with previous findings. While we also\nobserve that two-dimensional (2D) models explode for lower driving neutrino\nluminosity than spherically symmetric (1D) models, we do not find that\nexplosions in 3D occur easier and earlier than in 2D. Moreover, we find that\nthe average entropy of matter in the gain layer hardly depends on the dimension\nand thus is no good diagnostic quantity for the readiness to explode. Instead,\nmass, integrated entropy, total neutrino-heating rate, and nonradial kinetic\nenergy in the gain layer are higher when models are closer to explosion.\nCoherent, large-scale mass motions as typically associated with the standing\naccretion-shock instability (SASI) are observed to be supportive for explosions\nbecause they drive strong shock expansion and thus enlarge the gain layer.\nWhile 2D models with better angular resolution explode clearly more easily, the\nopposite trend is seen in 3D. We interpret this as a consequence of the\nturbulent energy cascade, which transports energy from small to large spatial\nscales in 2D, thus fostering SASI activity. In contrast, the energy flow in 3D\nis in the opposite direction, feeding fragmentation and vortex motions on\nsmaller scales and thus making the 3D evolution with finer grid resolution more\nsimilar to 1D. More favorable conditions for explosions in 3D may therefore be\ntightly linked to efficient growth of low-order SASI modes including\nnonaxisymmetric ones. \n\n"}

Our formalism stems from an exact\nfactorization of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction of the clock plus system\ncomposite, where the clock and system factors play the role of marginal and\nconditional probability amplitudes, respectively. Application of the Variation\nPrinciple leads to a pair of exact coupled pseudoeigenvalue equations for these\namplitudes, whose solution requires an iterative self-consistent procedure. The\nequation for the conditional amplitude constitutes an effective \"equation of\nmotion\" for the quantum state of the system with respect to the clock\nvariables.

The model fit also implies that the age of the universe is\n13.772+/-0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H0 = 69.32+/-0.80 km/s/Mpc.\nInflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with Gaussian\nrandom phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar spectral index from\nunity reported earlier by WMAP now has high statistical significance (n_s =\n0.9608+/-0.0080); and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean, Omega_k =\n-0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038). Overall, the WMAP mission has resulted in a\nreduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for the\nstandard six-parameter LCDM model, based on CMB data alone. For a model\nincluding tensors, the allowed seven-parameter volume has been reduced by a\nfactor 117,000. Other cosmological observations are in accord with the CMB\npredictions, and the combined data reduces the cosmological parameter volume\neven further. With no significant anomalies and an adequate goodness-of-fit,\nthe inflationary flat LCDM model and its precise and accurate parameters rooted\nin WMAP data stands as the standard model of cosmology. \n\n"}

These reductions\ntranslate to smaller SFR estimates made from observed UV and Halpha\nluminosities. Using the UV and Halpha fluxes of a sample of ~300 local\ngalaxies, we derive a total (i.e., sky-coverage corrected) SFR within 11 Mpc of\n120-170 Msun/yr and 80-130 Msun/yr for the non-rotating and rotating\nestimators, respectively. Independently, the number of core-collapse supernovae\ndiscovered in the same volume requires a total SFR of 270^{+110}_{-80} Msun/yr,\nsuggesting a mild tension with the SFR estimates made with rotating\ncalibrations.

The flavor content of the signal evolves\ndue to both neutrino collective effects and matter effects which can lead to a\nhighly interesting interplay and distinctive spectral features. In this paper\nwe investigate the supernova neutrino flavor evolution in three different\nprogenitors and include collective flavor effects, the evolution of the\nMikheyev, Smirnov & Wolfenstein conversion due to the shock wave passage\nthrough the star, and the impact of turbulence. In the Oxygen-Neon-Magnesium\nsupernova we find that the impact of turbulence is both brief and slight during\na window of 1-2 seconds post bounce. Thus the spectral features of collective\nand shock effects in the neutrino signals from ONeMg supernovae may be almost\nturbulence free making them the easiest to interpret. For the more massive\nprogenitors we again find that small amplitude turbulence, up to 10%, leads to\na minimal modification of the signal, and the emerging neutrino spectra retain\nboth collective and MSW features. However, when larger amounts of turbulence is\nadded, 30% and 50%, the features of collective and shock wave effects in the\nhigh density resonance channel are almost completely obscured at late times.\nYet at the same time we find the other mixing channels - the low density\nresonance channel and the non-resonant channels - begin to develop turbulence\nsignatures. Large amplitude turbulent motions in the outer layers of more\nmassive, iron core-collapse supernovae may obscure the most obvious\nfingerprints of collective and shock wave effects in the neutrino signal but\ncannot remove them completely, and additionally bring about new features in the\nsignal. \n\n"}

We\npropose to use the proton linac of the European Spallation Source currently\nunder construction in Lund, Sweden to deliver, in parallel with the spallation\nneutron production, a very intense, cost effective and high performance\nneutrino beam.

Our proposal is to upgrade\nthe linac to 10 MW average power and 28 Hz, producing 14 pulses/s for neutron\nproduction and 14 pulses/s for neutrino production.

We then proceed to study\nlimitations on qLTCs. In our first main result we prove a surprising,\ninherently quantum, property of sLTCs: for small values of proximity, the\nbetter the small-set expansion of the interaction graph of the constraints, the\nless sound the qLTC becomes. This phenomenon, which can be attributed to\nmonogamy of entanglement, stands in sharp contrast to the classical setting.\nThe complementary, more intuitive, result also holds: an upper bound on the\nsoundness when the code is defined on poor small-set expanders (a bound which\nturns out to be far more difficult to show in the quantum case).

The progenitor is a nonrotating,\nzero-metallicity 9.6 Msun star with an iron core. While in spherical symmetry\noutward shock acceleration sets in later than 300 ms after bounce, a successful\nexplosion starts at ~130 ms postbounce in two dimensions (2D). The 3D model\nexplodes at about the same time but with faster shock expansion than in 2D and\na more quickly increasing and roughly 10 percent higher explosion energy of\n>10^50 erg. The more favorable explosion conditions in 3D are explained by\nlower temperatures and thus reduced neutrino emission in the cooling layer\nbelow the gain radius. This moves the gain radius inward and leads to a bigger\nmass in the gain layer, whose larger recombination energy boosts the explosion\nenergy in 3D. These differences are caused by less coherent, less massive, and\nless rapid convective downdrafts associated with postshock convection in 3D.\nThe less violent impact of these accretion downflows in the cooling layer\nproduces less shock heating and therefore diminishes energy losses by neutrino\nemission. We thus have, for the first time, identified a reduced mass accretion\nrate, lower infall velocities, and a smaller surface filling factor of\nconvective downdrafts as consequences of 3D postshock turbulence that\nfacilitate neutrino-driven explosions and strengthen them compared to the 2D\ncase. \n\n"}

A central part of the Higgs programme at an e+e- collider\nis the model-independent determination of the absolute Higgs couplings to\nfermions and to gauge bosons. Here the measurement of the e+e-->HZ\nHiggsstrahlung cross section, using the recoil mass technique, sets the\nabsolute scale for all Higgs coupling measurements. Previous studies have\nconsidered e+e- ->ZH with Z->l+l-, where l = electron or muon. In this paper it\nis shown for the first time that a near model-independent recoil mass technique\ncan be extended to the hadronic decays of the Z boson. Because the branching\nratio for Z->qq is approximately ten times greater than for Z->l+l-, this\nmethod is statistically more powerful than using the leptonic decays.

If the neutral gauge boson corresponding to this abelian\nsymmetry is ultra-light, then it will give rise to flavor-dependent long-range\nleptonic force, which can have significant impact on neutrino oscillations. For\nan instance, the electrons inside the Sun can generate a flavor-dependent\nlong-range potential at the Earth surface, which can suppress the $\\nu_{\\mu}\n\\to \\nu_e$ appearance probability in terrestrial experiments.

The defining feature of these representations is\nthat topological order is a consequence of the symmetry of the underlying\ntensors in terms of matrix product operators. In this paper, we present a\nsystematic study of those matrix product operators, and show how this relates\nentanglement properties of projected entangled-pair states to the formalism of\nfusion tensor categories. From the matrix product operators we construct a\nC*-algebra and find that topological sectors can be identified with the central\nidempotents of this algebra. This allows us to construct projected\nentangled-pair states containing an arbitrary number of anyons. Properties such\nas topological spin, the S matrix, fusion and braiding relations can readily be\nextracted from the idempotents. As the matrix product operator symmetries are\nacting purely on the virtual level of the tensor network, the ensuing Wilson\nloops are not fattened when perturbing the system, and this opens up the\npossibility of simulating topological theories away from renormalization group\nfixed points. We illustrate the general formalism for the special cases of\ndiscrete gauge theories and string-net models. \n\n"}

One of the important objectives of the COMPASS experiment is the\nexploration of transverse spin structure of the nucleon via study of spin\n(in)dependent azimuthal asymmetries with semi-inclusive deep inelastic\nscattering (SIDIS) processes and starting from 2014 also with Drell-Yan (DY)\nreactions.

Unexpected discoveries, such as the\ndiphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the\nconstruction of a photon collider.

In the ILC\ntechnical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough\nspace for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions,\nthe crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result\nfrom multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with\nthe opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector\nfield. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.\nIn this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as\nwell as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable\nreduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity.

We compute the effects\nof the S1 stream on WIMP and axion detectors as a function of the density of\nits unmeasured dark component. In WIMP detectors the S1 stream supplies more\nhigh energy nuclear recoils so will marginally improve DM detection prospects.\nWe find that even if S1 comprises less than 10% of the local density, multi-ton\nxenon WIMP detectors can distinguish the S1 stream from the bulk halo in the\nrelatively narrow mass range between 5 and 25 GeV. In directional WIMP\ndetectors such as CYGNUS, S1 increases DM detection prospects more\nsubstantially since it enhances the anisotropy of the WIMP signal.

We consider the\nuse of relaxations to the ground-state problem as a benchmark for the output of\nquantum optimisers.

We study the interplay of these competing tendencies by\nconsidering time evolution combining both unitary and projective dynamics. We\nbegin by constructing a toy model of Bell pair dynamics which demonstrates that\nmeasurements can keep a system in a state of low (i.e. area law) entanglement,\nin contrast with the volume law entanglement produced by generic pure unitary\ntime evolution. While the simplest Bell pair model has area law entanglement\nfor any measurement rate, as seen in certain non-interacting systems, we show\nthat more generic models of entanglement can feature an area-to-volume law\ntransition at a critical value of the measurement rate, in agreement with\nrecent numerical investigations. As a concrete example of these ideas, we\nanalytically investigate Clifford evolution in qubit systems which can exhibit\nan entanglement transition. We are able to identify stabilizer size\ndistributions characterizing the area law, volume law and critical 'fixed\npoints.' We also discuss Floquet random circuits, where the answers depend on\nthe order of limits - one order of limits yields area law entanglement for any\nnon-zero measurement rate, whereas a different order of limits allows for an\narea law - volume law transition. Finally, we provide a rigorous argument that\na system subjected to projective measurements can only exhibit a volume law\nentanglement entropy if it also features a subleading correction term, which\nprovides a universal signature of projective dynamics in the high-entanglement\nphase.

On D_I there are\nthree and on D_II four such potentials, respectively. We are able to evaluate\nthe path integral in most of the separating coordinate systems, leading to\nexpressions for the Green functions, the discrete and continuous\nwave-functions, and the discrete energy-spectra. In some cases, however, the\ndiscrete spectrum cannot be stated explicitly, because it is either determined\nby a transcendental equation involving parabolic cylinder functions (Darboux\nspace I), or by a higher order polynomial equation. The solutions on D_I in\nparticular show that superintegrable systems are not necessarily degenerate. We\ncan also show how the limiting cases of flat space (constant curvature zero)\nand the two-dimensional hyperboloid (constant negative curvature) emerge. \n\n"}

One of the only\nknown models for how such a measurement could be carried out efficiently is\nKuperberg's algorithm for the HSP in the dihedral group, in which quantum\nstates are adaptively combined and measured according to the decomposition of\ntensor products into irreducible representations. This ``quantum sieve'' starts\nwith coset states, and works its way down towards representations whose\nprobabilities differ depending on, for example, whether the hidden subgroup is\ntrivial or nontrivial.\n  In this paper we give strong evidence that no such approach can succeed for\nGraph Isomorphism. Specifically, we consider the natural reduction of Graph\nIsomorphism to the HSP over the the wreath product S_n \\wr Z_2. We show, modulo\na group-theoretic conjecture regarding the asymptotic characters of the\nsymmetric group, that no matter what rule we use to adaptively combine quantum\nstates, there is a constant b > 0 such that no algorithm in this family can\nsolve Graph Isomorphism in e^{b sqrt{n}} time. In particular, such algorithms\nare essentially no better than the best known classical algorithms, whose\nrunning time is e^{O(sqrt{n \\log n})}. \n\n"}

In quantum\nwalks, the qudit of walker is mixed according to the quantum coin at each time\nstep, when the walker hops to other sites. As special cases of the quantum\nwalks driven by high-dimensional quantum coins generally studied by Brun,\nCarteret, and Ambainis, we study the models obtained by choosing rotation as\nthe unitary transformation, whose matrix representations determine quantum\ncoins. We show that Wigner's $(2j+1)$-dimensional unitary representations of\nrotations with half-integers $j$'s are useful to analyze the probability laws\nof quantum walks. For any value of half-integer $j$, convergence of all moments\nof walker's pseudovelocity in the long-time limit is proved. It is generally\nshown for the present models that, if $(2j+1)$ is even, the probability measure\nof limit distribution is given by a superposition of $(2j+1)/2$ terms of scaled\nKonno's density functions, and if $(2j+1)$ is odd, it is a superposition of $j$\nterms of scaled Konno's density functions and a Dirac's delta function at the\norigin. For the two-, three-, and four-component models, the probability\ndensities of limit distributions are explicitly calculated and their dependence\non the parameters of quantum coins and on the initial qudit of walker is\ncompletely determined.

We find that quantum\nconditional entropies can be negative for entangled systems, which leads to a\nviolation of well-known bounds in Shannon information theory. Such a unified\ninformation-theoretic description of classical correlation and quantum\nentanglement clarifies the link between them: the latter can be viewed as\n``super-correlation'' which can induce classical correlation when considering a\ntripartite or larger system. Furthermore, negative entropy and the associated\nclarification of entanglement paves the way to a natural information-theoretic\ndescription of the measurement process.

The loss reflects the transmission\nquality: if the loss is zero, quantum information can be perfectly transmitted\nat a rate measured by the quantum source entropy. By using block coding based\non sequences of n entangled symbols, the average loss (defined as the overall\nloss of the joint n-symbol channel divided by n, when n tends to infinity) can\nbe made lower than the loss for a single use of the channel. In this context,\nwe examine several upper bounds on the rate at which quantum information can be\ntransmitted reliably via a noisy channel, that is, with an asymptotically\nvanishing average loss while the one-symbol loss of the channel is non-zero.\nThese bounds on the channel capacity rely on the entropic Singleton bound on\nquantum error-correcting codes [Phys.
