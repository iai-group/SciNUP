We introduce a model which accounts for this phenomenon as a\nconsequence of vortex pinning to impurities. Each pinned vortex embeds several\nimpurities in its core. The observations of recent experiments can be accounted\nfor by assuming that the scattering potentials of the impurities inside the\nvortex cores acquire an additional resonant or Andreev scattering component,\nboth of which induce gap sign preserving scattering events. \n\n"}

A microscopic phase separation between\nsuperconducting domains and magnetic domains is shown to take place in the\nunderdoped sample, indicating a local inhomogeneity in association with the\ndensity distribution of oxygen deficiencies. As a result, 1/T_1T in the normal\nstate of the superconducting domain decreases significantly upon cooling at\nboth the Fe and As sites regardless of the electron-doping level in\nLaFeAsO_{1-y}. On the basis of this result, we claim that $1/T_1T$ is not\nalways enhanced by antiferromagnetic fluctuations close to an antiferromagnetic\nphase in the underdoped superconducting sample.

Nevertheless, the density-averaged\nresponse remains a non-analytic function of q and omega at Lieb-1 mode in the\nlimit of weak trap confinement.

My strong interest in the above theorem is motivated by the fact\nthat it contradicts some of my isospectrality examples constructed on geodesic\nspheres and balls of certain harmonic manifolds.

In short, the above theorem has falsely been established by\nspectrally undetermined identities which can not be computed (determined) by\nthe spectra of local geodesic spheres. More complicated spectrally undetermined\nfunctions cause the problems also in case of local geodesic balls.

In this framework, strong correlation and anti-ferromagnetic\ninteraction between electrons, create RVB pairs and phonons provide the phase\ncoherence between these RVB pairs. Both of these are required in this approach\nto obtain the superconductivity. This approach resolves three limitations of\nthe U(1) slave boson method. We achieve a better estimation of $T_c$, we only\npredict $\\frac{h}{2ec}$ vortices and the linear $T$ coefficient of the\nsuperfluid is not sensitive to the doping. This formalism provides a framework\nthat connects Anderson's idea of preformed Cooper pairs and phonon based\ntheories. \n\n"}

If the metal is also a superconductor then, at low temperatures,\ndisorder can induce a dramatic transition from a superconducting into an\ninsulating state. An outstanding question is whether the route to insulating\nbehavior proceeds via the direct localization of Cooper pairs or,\nalternatively, by a two-step process in which the Cooper pairing is first\ndestroyed followed by the standard localization of single electrons. Here we\naddress this question by studying the local superconducting gap of a highly\ndisordered, amorphous, superconductor by means of scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy. Our measurements reveal that, in the vicinity of the\nsuperconductor-insulator transition, the coherence peaks in the one-particle\ndensity of states disappear while the superconducting gap remains intact\nindicating the presence of localized Cooper pairs. Our results provide the\nfirst direct evidence that the transition in our system is driven by Cooper\npair localization. \n\n"}

We performed monitoring of 42 blazars in the optical and\nnear-infrared bands from 2008 to 2010 using TRISPEC attached to the \"Kanata\"\n1.5-m telescope.

Thus, our observation\nunambiguously confirmed that the \"bluer-when-brighter\" trend is common in the\nemission from blazar jets. This trend was apparently generated by a variation\ncomponent with a constant and relatively blue color and an underlying red\ncomponent. Prominent short-term flares on time scales of days--weeks tended to\nexhibit a spectral hysteresis; their rising phases were bluer than their decay\nphases around the flare maxima. In contrast to the strong flux--color\ncorrelation, the correlation of the flux and polarization degree was relatively\nweak; only 10 objects showed significant positive correlations.

Despite this long history the\nunambiguous observation of Majorana fermions nevertheless remains an\noutstanding goal. This review article highlights recent advances in the\ncondensed matter search for Majorana that have led many in the field to believe\nthat this quest may soon bear fruit. We begin by introducing in some detail\nexotic `topological' one- and two-dimensional superconductors that support\nMajorana fermions at their boundaries and at vortices. We then turn to one of\nthe key insights that arose during the past few years; namely, that it is\npossible to `engineer' such exotic superconductors in the laboratory by forming\nappropriate heterostructures with ordinary s-wave superconductors. Numerous\nproposals of this type are discussed, based on diverse materials such as\ntopological insulators, conventional semiconductors, ferromagnetic metals, and\nmany others. The all-important question of how one experimentally detects\nMajorana fermions in these setups is then addressed. We focus on three classes\nof measurements that provide smoking-gun Majorana signatures: tunneling,\nJosephson effects, and interferometry. Finally, we discuss the most remarkable\nproperties of condensed matter Majorana fermions--the non-Abelian exchange\nstatistics that they generate and their associated potential for quantum\ncomputation. \n\n"}

It was previously shown that the model gives a good description of\nHERA data suggesting evidence for gluon saturation effects at small x. The\nmodel has also been applied to proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions and\nprovides the basis for the IP-Glasma model of initial conditions in heavy ion\ncollisions. Here we present a reanalysis of available data in electron-proton\ncollisions at small Bjorken-x, including the recently released combined data\nfrom the ZEUS and H1 collaborations.

This, combined\nwith the fact that the burst fluence is among the top 5% of what is observed\nfor other events, makes this event extremely energetic. We discuss the possible\nprogenitors that could explain the extreme duration properties of this burst as\nwell as its spectral properties. We present evidences that this burst belong to\na new, previously unidentified, class of GRBs. The most probable progenitor of\nthis new class is a low metalicity blue super-giant star. We show that\nselection effects could prevent the detection of other bursts at larger\nredshift and conclude that this kind of event is intrinsically rare in the\nlocal Universe. The afterglow presents similar features to other normal long\nGRBs and a late rebrightening in the optical wavelengths, as observed in other\nlong GRBs.

In an earlier paper, we have\npresented a Chandra data analysis of the coronae of 53 nearby highly-inclined\ndisc galaxies. Here we study the correlation of the X-ray measurements with\nother galaxy properties and compare the results with those obtained for\nelliptical galaxies. A good correlation is present between the coronal\nluminosity Lx and the SFR. But we find a better correlation between Lx and the\ntotal SN mechanical energy input rate (ESN), including the expected\ncontribution from core collapsed (CC) and Ia SNe. The X-ray radiation\nefficiency (eta=Lx/ESN) has a mean value of ~0.4% with an rms of ~0.5dex. eta\nfurther correlates with MTF/M* (MTF is the baryon mass measured from the\nrotation velocity and the Tully-Fisher relation, M* is the stellar mass\nmeasured from the K-band luminosity) and the CC SN rate surface density (FSN,\nin units of SN/yr/kpc^2), which can be characterized as: eta=0.41%MTF/M* and\neta=1.4%FSN^-0.3. These correlations reflect the roles played by the\ngravitational mass and energetic feedback concentrations in determining eta.\nThe characteristic temperature of the corona shows little dependence on the\ntotal or specific SFR, the cold gas content, or Lx. The coronae of disc\ngalaxies tend to be more X-ray luminous, hotter, and lower in Fe/O abundance\nratio than those of elliptical ones of similar masses. Early-type non-starburst\ndisc galaxies tend to be more Fe-rich, while starburst ones have a roughly\nconstant abundance ratio of Fe/O~0.36solar. Our results are consistent with the\ncoronal gas being mainly provided by stellar feedback in a mass range of\nM*~10^{8.7-11}Msun. In addition, processes such as charge exchange at cool/hot\ngas interfaces, as well as various environmental effects, are also needed to\nexplain the diversity of coronal properties. \n\n"}

Yet, in a number of materials, in particular the\nhigh-temperature superconductors and the layered organic superconductors, they\nfail. In these lecture notes for an international school, I emphasize that even\nthough the low energy properties of a phase of matter are generally emergent\nand entirely determined by the broken symmetry, there are many differences\nbetween a strongly correlated and a weakly correlated state of matter. For\nexample, spin waves are an emergent property for antiferromagnets, but for weak\ncorrelations the normal phase of a (Slater) antiferromagnet is metallic,\nwhereas it is insulating (Heisenberg) for strong correlations. As a function of\ninteraction strength, above the antiferromagnetic phase, the crossover between\na metal and a local moment paramagnetic insulator is described by the Mott\ntransition, whose mean-field theory down to T=0 is best formulated with\ndynamical mean-field theory. A similar situation occurs for superconductors:\ndespite similar emergent properties, there are many differences between both\nkinds of superconductors. Experimental evidence suggests that hole-doped\ncuprates are strongly correlated whereas the correlations are weaker in the\nelectron-doped case, especially near optimal doping. Evidence for a pseudogap\narising from antiferromagnetic fluctuations is strong in the latter case,\nwhereas in the hole-doped case the pseudogap temperature appears as a\nconsequence of Mott physics.

For this purpose, we construct the two possible tight-binding models\nwith finite SOI by referring the bandstructures given by different ARPES\ngroups. In addition, we extend the gap equation for multiorbital systems with\nfinite SOI, and calculate the gap functions by applying the orbital-spin\nfluctuation theory. On the basis of both SOI-induced band structures, main\ncharacteristics of the gap structure in LiFeAs are naturally reproduced only in\nthe presence of strong inter-orbital interactions between (xz/yz - xy)\norbitals. Thus, the experimental gap structure in LiFeAs is a strong evidence\nfor the orbital-fluctuation pairing mechanism. \n\n"}

The\ntheoretical modeling of such systems is a very difficult problem. In this work\nwe present a theoretical framework that is based on the rigged Hilbert space\nformulation. The few-body problem is solved by exact diagonalization using a\nbasis in which bound, resonant, and non-resonant scattering states are included\non an equal footing. Current experiments with ultracold atoms offer a\nfascinating opportunity to study universal properties of few-body systems with\na high degree of control over parameters such as the external trap geometry,\nthe number of particles, and even the interaction strength. In particular,\nparticles can be allowed to tunnel out of the trap by applying a magnetic-field\ngradient that effectively lowers the potential barrier. The result is a tunable\nopen quantum system that allows detailed studies of the tunneling mechanism. In\nthis Contribution we introduce our method and present results for the decay\nrate of two distinguishable fermions in a one-dimensional trap as a function of\nthe interaction strength.

Such BHs bifurcate\nfrom the vacuum Kerr solution and can be regarded as a horizon within a\nrotating boson star. In a recent letter, it was shown that KBHsSH can exhibit\nvery distinct shadows from the ones of their vacuum counterparts. The setup\ntherein, however, considered the light source to be a celestial sphere\nsufficiently far away from the BH. Here, we analyse KBHsSH surrounded by an\nemitting torus of matter, simulating a more realistic astrophysical\nenvironment, and study the corresponding lensing of light as seen by a very far\naway observer, to appropriately model ground-based observations of Sgr A*. We\nfind that the differences in imaging between KBHsSH and comparable vacuum Kerr\nBHs remain, albeit less dramatic than those observed for the corresponding\nshadows in the previous setup. In particular, we highlight two observables that\nmight allow differentiating KBHsSH and Kerr BHs.

Impurity-free La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 shows a spin gap of 4meV\nbelow Tc in the antiferromagnetic(AF) incommensurate spin excitation. In\nZn:y=0.004, the spin excitation shows a spin gap of 3meV below Tc. In\nZn:y=0.008 and Zn:y=0.011, however, the magnetic signals at 3meV decrease below\nTc and increase again at lower temperature, indicating an in-gap state. In\nZn:y=0.017, the low-energy spin state remains unchanged with decreasing\ntemperature, and elastic magnetic peaks appear below 20K then exponentially\nincrease. As for Ni:y=0.009 and Ni:y=0.018, the low-energy excitations below\n3meV and 2meV disappear below Tc.

Furthermore, as omega\nincreases, the magnetic peak width broadens and the peak position, i.e.\nincommensurability, shifts toward the magnetic zone center (pi pi). We\ninterpret the impurity effects as follows: Zn locally makes a\nnon-superconducting island exhibiting the in-gap state in the superconducting\nsea with the spin gap. Zn reduces the superconducting volume fraction, thus\nsuppressing Tc. On the other hand, Ni primarily affects the superconducting\nsea, and the spin excitations become more dispersive and broaden with\nincreasing energy, which is recognized as a consequence of the reduction of\nenergy scale of spin excitations.

In both Bi2212 and Tl2201 we infer a linear temperature\ndependence of the transport relaxation rate 1/tau and a small but finite\nzero-temperature intercept.

If Lambda_3 = Lambda^{conv}_3, the contribution of only\nphysical cut is deficient in the explanation of the ALEPH experiment. If\nLambda_3 = Lambda^{new}_3 the contribution of nonphysical cut is very small and\nonly the physical cut explains the ALEPH experiment. The new sum rules which\nfollow only from analytical properties of polarization operators are obtained.\nBasing on the sum rules obtained, it is shown that there is an essential\ndisagreement between QCD perturbation theory and the tau-lepton hadronic decay\nexperiment at conventional value Lambda_3.

From the existence and uniqueness of circle patterns\nin the sphere, we derive a strengthened version of Steinitz' theorem on the\ngeometric realizability of abstract polyhedra.\n  We derive the variational principles of Colin de Verdi\\`ere, Br\\\"agger, and\nRivin for circle packings and circle patterns from our variational principles.\nIn the case of Br\\\"agger's and Rivin's functionals. Leibon's functional for\nhyperbolic circle patterns cannot be derived directly from our functionals. But\nwe construct yet another functional from which both Leibon's and our\nfunctionals can be derived.\n  We present Java software to compute and visualize circle patterns. \n\n"}

{"id": "math/0408229", "contents": "Title: The ambient obstruction tensor and the conformal deformation complex Abstract: The (Fefferman-Graham) ambient obstruction tensor is a conformally invariant\nsymmetric trace-free 2-tensor on even-dimensional Riemannian and\npseudo-Riemannian manifolds. The conformal deformation complex is a\ndifferential complex related to infinitesimal deformations of conformal\nstructure. We construct a conformally invariant differential operator on\nalgebraic Weyl tensors that gives special curved analogues of certain operators\nrelated to the deformation complex and that, upon application to the Weyl\ncurvature, yields the obstruction tensor. This new definition of the\nobstruction tensor leads to simple direct proofs that the obstruction tensor is\ndivergence free and vanishes for a class of metrics which (strictly) includes\nthe class of conformally Einstein metrics. Our main constructions are based on\nthe ambient metric of Fefferman-Graham and its relation to the conformal\ntractor connection. We prove that the obstruction tensor is an obstruction to\nthe formal problem of obtaining a Ricci-flat ambient metric and that it may\nequivalently be viewed as the obstruction to finding an ambient metric with\ncurvature harmonic for a certain (ambient) form Laplacian. This leads to a new\nambient formula for the obstruction in terms of a power of this form Laplacian\nacting on the ambient curvature. This result leads us to construct Laplacian\ntype operators that generalise the conformal Laplacians of\nGraham-Jenne-Mason-Sparling. As background to these issues, we give an explicit\nconstruction of the deformation complex in dimensions n>3, construct two\nrelated (detour) complexes, and establish essential properties of the operators\nin these. \n\n"}
