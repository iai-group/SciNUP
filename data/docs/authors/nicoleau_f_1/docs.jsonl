In this paper we examine the\nvalidity of this perception by investigating whether such fluctuations can in\nreality depend on temperature.\n  Firstly, we describe fluctuations in the occupation numbers of the energy\nlevels for an isolated system, using previously unknown identities that we have\nderived for the purpose, which allow us to calculate the moments of the\noccupation numbers. Then we compute analytically the probability distribution\nof these fluctuations. We show that, for every system of fixed and finite $N$,\nfluctuations about the equilibrium distribution do, in fact, depend on the\ntemperature. Indeed, at higher temperatures the fluctuations can be so large\nthat the system does not fully converge on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution\nbut actually fluctuates around it. We term this state, where not one macrostate\nbut a region of macrostates closely fit the underlying distribution, a ``{\\it\nfluctuating equilibrium}''. Finally, we speculate on how this finding is\napplicable to networks, financial markets, and other thermodynamic-like\nsystems. \n\n"}

{"id": "0903.1465", "contents": "Title: A new cohomological formula for helicity in $\\R^{2k+1}$ reveals the\n  effect of a diffeomorphism on helicity Abstract: The helicity of a vector field is a measure of the average linking of pairs\nof integral curves of the field. Computed by a six-dimensional integral, it is\nwidely useful in the physics of fluids. For a divergence-free field tangent to\nthe boundary of a domain in 3-space, helicity is known to be invariant under\nvolume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the domain that are homotopic to the\nidentity. We give a new construction of helicity for closed $(k+1)$-forms on a\ndomain in $(2k+1)$-space that vanish when pulled back to the boundary of the\ndomain. Our construction expresses helicity in terms of a cohomology class\nrepresented by the form when pulled back to the compactified configuration\nspace of pairs of points in the domain. We show that our definition is\nequivalent to the standard one. We use our construction to give a new formula\nfor computing helicity by a four-dimensional integral. We provide a Biot-Savart\noperator that computes a primitive for such forms; utilizing it, we obtain\nanother formula for helicity. As a main result, we find a general formula for\nhow much the value of helicity changes when the form is pushed forward by a\ndiffeomorphism of the domain; it relies upon understanding the effect of the\ndiffeomorphism on the homology of the domain and the de Rham cohomology class\nrepresented by the form. Our formula allows us to classify the\nhelicity-preserving diffeomorphisms on a given domain, finding new\nhelicity-preserving diffeomorphisms on the two-holed solid torus, and proving\nthat there are no new helicity-preserving diffeomorphisms on the standard solid\ntorus.

We start with\noutlining a general troublesome feature of the main quantum theory instrument,\nthe perturbation expansion method. The striking issue is that perturbation\nseries in powers of $\\alpha \\ll 1$ is not a convergent series. The formal\nreason is an essential singularity of quantum amplitude (matrix element)\n$C(\\alpha)$ at the origin $\\alpha=0$. In many physically important cases one\nneeds some alternative means of theoretical analysis. In particular, this\nrefers to perturbative QCD (pQCD) in the low-energy domain.

The existence of superluminal relative velocities of receding test\nparticles, in a particular cosmological model, suggests itself as a possible\ncriterion for expansion of space in that model. In this point of view,\nsuperluminal velocities of distant receding galaxy clusters result from the\nexpansion of space between the observer and the clusters. However, there is a\nfundamental ambiguity that must be resolved before this approach can be\nmeaningful. The notion of relative velocity of a nonlocal object depends on the\nchoice of coordinates, and this ambiguity suggests the need for coordinate\nindependent definitions.

There are two obvious ways to generalize\nthis setting. First, our task need not be the determination of any possible\ninput state but only some input states, for instance pure states. Second, we\nmay have some prior information, or premise, which guarantees that the input\nstate belongs to some subset of states, for instance the set of states with\nrank less than half of the dimension of the Hilbert space. We investigate state\ndetermination under these two supplemental features, concentrating on the cases\nwhere the task and the premise are statements about the rank of the unknown\nstate. We characterize the structure of quantum observables (POVMs) that are\ncapable of fulfilling these type of determination tasks.

A theoretical\n  and empirical investigation of the driven case Abstract: The observation of apparent power-laws in neuronal systems has led to the\nsuggestion that the brain is at, or close to, a critical state and may be a\nself-organised critical system. Within the framework of self-organised\ncriticality a separation of timescales is thought to be crucial for the\nobservation of power-law dynamics and computational models are often\nconstructed with this property. However, this is not necessarily a\ncharacteristic of physiological neural networks - external input does not only\noccur when the network is at rest/a steady state. In this paper we study a\nsimple neuronal network model driven by a continuous external input (i.e.\\ the\nmodel does not have a separation of timescales) and analytically tuned to\noperate in the region of a critical state (it reaches the critical regime\nexactly in the absence of input - the case studied in the companion paper to\nthis article). The system displays avalanche dynamics in the form of cascades\nof neuronal firing separated by periods of silence. We observe partial\nscale-free behaviour in the distribution of avalanche size for low levels of\nexternal input. We analytically derive the distributions of waiting times and\ninvestigate their temporal behaviour in relation to different levels of\nexternal input, showing that the system's dynamics can exhibit partial\nlong-range temporal correlations. We further show that as the system approaches\nthe critical state by two alternative `routes', different markers of\ncriticality (partial scale-free behaviour and long-range temporal correlations)\nare displayed. This suggests that signatures of criticality exhibited by a\nparticular system in close proximity to a critical state are dependent on the\nregion in parameter space at which the system (currently) resides. \n\n"}

Infinite families of mirror pairs including various\nquivers of D and E-type and their affine extensions, star-shaped quivers, and\nquivers with symplectic gauge groups may be generated in this fashion.

We begin by discussing the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry\nof equi-geodesic surfaces $\\Sigma_{G,p_0}$ defined by $\\Omega(p,p_0)=constant$\nin a geodesically convex neighbourhood of an event $p_0$, and highlight some\nelementary identities relating the VVD with geometry of these surfaces.

We demonstrate that\nsupersymmetry imposes additional restrictions on the correlators of conserved\ncurrents as compared with the non-supersymmetric case studied by Osborn and\nPetkou in hep-th/9307010. It is shown that the three-point function of the\nsupercurrent is determined by a single functional form consistent with the\nconservation equation and all the symmetry properties. Similarly, the\nthree-point function of the flavour current multiplets is also determined by a\nsingle functional form in the N=1 and N=3 cases. The specific feature of the\nN=2 case is that two independent structures are allowed for the three-point\nfunction of flavour current multiplets, but only one of them contributes to the\nthree-point function of the conserved currents contained in these multiplets.\nSince the supergravity and super-Yang-Mills Ward identities are expected to\nrelate the coefficients of the two- and three-point functions under\nconsideration, the results obtained for 3D superconformal field theory are\nanalogous to those in 2D conformal field theory.\n  In addition, we present a new supertwistor construction for compactified\nMinkowski superspace.

Here we extend this construction by including\nmatter fields to build partition functions in both two and three space-time\ndimensions. The matter fields introduces new weights to the vertices and they\ncorrespond to Potts spin configurations described by an $\\mathcal{A}$-module\nwith an inner product. Performing this construction on a triangulated manifold\nwith a boundary we obtain the transfer matrices which are decomposed into a\nproduct of local operators acting on vertices, links and plaquettes. The vertex\nand plaquette operators are similar to the ones appearing in the quantum double\nmodels (QDM) of Kitaev. The link operator couples the gauge and the matter\nfields, and it reduces to the usual interaction terms in known models such as\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with matter fields. The transfer matrices lead to\nHamiltonians that are frustration-free and are exactly solvable. According to\nthe choice of the initial input, that of the gauge group and a matter module,\nwe obtain interesting models which have a new kind of ground state degeneracy\nthat depends on the number of equivalence classes in the matter module under\ngauge action. Some of the models have confined flux excitations in the bulk\nwhich become deconfined at the surface. These edge modes are protected by an\nenergy gap provided by the link operator.

A key example is\nthe tomography of multiple ions states, employed in the validation of state\npreparation in ion trap experiments \\cite{Haffner2005}. Since full tomography\nbecomes unfeasible even for a small number of ions, there is a need to\ninvestigate lower dimensional statistical models which capture prior\ninformation about the state, and to devise estimation methods tailored to such\nmodels. In this paper we propose several new methods aimed at the efficient\nestimation of low rank states in multiple ions tomography. All methods consist\nin first computing the least squares estimator, followed by its truncation to\nan appropriately chosen smaller rank. The latter is done by setting eigenvalues\nbelow a certain \"noise level\" to zero, while keeping the rest unchanged, or\nnormalising them appropriately. We show that (up to logarithmic factors in the\nspace dimension) the mean square error of the resulting estimators scales as\n$r\\cdot d/N$ where $r$ is the rank, $d=2^k$ is the dimension of the Hilbert\nspace, and $N$ is the number of quantum samples.

The spectrum consists of an ordered set of strictly positive\neigenvalues which naturally splits into non-overlapping, orbitally labelled\n$E_{(k,l)}$ series. For each orbital label $l=0,1,2,...$ the label $k =1,2,...$\nenumerates consecutive $l$-th series eigenvalues. Each of them is\n$2l+1$-degenerate.

They are also important for the conceptual understanding\nof quantum theory because projection operators also represent observation\nprocess on quantum system. In this paper we explore the algebra of quantum\nidempotents and show that they generate Iterant algebra (defined in the paper),\nLie algebra, Grassmann algebra and Clifford algebra which is very interesting\nbecause these later algebras were introduced for the geometry of spaces and\nhence are called geometric algebras.

Quantum coherence has recently\nbeen investigated rigorously within a resource-theoretic formalism. However,\nthe finer-grained notion of multilevel coherence, which explicitly takes into\naccount the number of superposed classical states, has remained relatively\nunexplored. A comprehensive analysis of multi-level coherence, which acts as\nthe single-party analogue to multi-partite entanglement, is essential for\nunderstanding natural quantum processes as well as for gauging the performance\nof quantum technologies. Here we develop the theoretical and experimental\ngroundwork for characterizing and quantifying multilevel coherence. We prove\nthat non-trivial levels of purity are required for multilevel coherence, as\nthere is a ball of states around the maximally mixed state that do not exhibit\nmultilevel coherence in any basis.

In agreement with recent theoretical findings of the authors, in the\nsituation in which the round-off errors are negligible with respect to the\nperturbations due to the discrete scheme used in the numerical experiments, the\nsplit-step Fourier method (SSFM), the numerical output is well-described by a\nsuitable genus 2 finite-gap solution of NLS. This solution can be written in\nterms of different elementary functions in different time regions and,\nultimately, it shows an exact recurrence of rogue waves described, at each\nappearance, by the Akhmediev breather. We discover a remarkable empirical\nformula connecting the recurrence time with the number of time steps used in\nthe SSFM and, via our recent theoretical findings, we establish that the SSFM\nopens up a vertical unstable gap whose length can be computed with high\naccuracy, and is proportional to the inverse of the square of the number of\ntime steps used in the SSFM.

Their wave-equations are established as a mere consequence of causal\nlocalization. - The bounded localized Dirac and Weyl wavefunctions are studied\nin detail. One finds that, at the speed of light, the carriers shrink in the\npast and expand in the future. For every direction in space there is a definite\ntime at which the change from shrinking to expanding occurs. A late changing\ntime characterizes those states, which shrink to a delta-strip if boosted in\nthe opposite direction. Using a density result for these late-change states one\nshows that all Dirac and Weyl wave-functions are subjected to Lorentz\ncontraction. The latter is discussed in some detail. - We tackle the question\nwhether a causal system induces a representation of a causal logic and thus\nprovides a localization in proper space-time regions rather than on spacelike\nhyperplanes.

The Clifford group is a central object in many subfields of\nquantum information, most prominently in the theory of fault-tolerance. The\nduality theory has a simple and clean description in terms of finite\ngeometries.

Particular attention is paid to the so-called star type I\nrepresentations (``unitary representations''), and to a simple class of\nrepresentations V(p), with p any positive integer. Then, the notion of Wigner\nQuantum Oscillators (WQOs) is recalled. In these quantum oscillator models, the\nunitary representations of gl(1|DN) are physical state spaces of the N-particle\nD-dimensional oscillator. So far, physical properties of gl(1|DN) WQOs were\ndescribed only in the so-called Fock spaces W(p), leading to interesting\nconcepts such as non-commutative coordinates and a discrete spatial structure.\nHere, we describe physical properties of WQOs for other unitary\nrepresentations, including certain representations V(p) of gl(1|DN).

If such a consistent quantization were to\nexist, it is reasonable to expect a ``Wightman reconstruction theorem,'' by\nwhich a Hilbert space and quantum field operators are recovered from n-point\nfunctions. However, the original version of the Wightman theorem is not\nequipped to deal with gauge fields or fields taking values in a noncommutative\nspace. This paper explores a generalization of the Wightman construction which\nallows the fundamental fields to take values in an arbitrary topological\n*-algebra. In particular, the construction applies to fields valued in a Lie\nalgebra representation, of the type required by Yang-Mills theory. This appears\nto be the correct framework for a generalized reconstruction theorem amenable\nto modern quantum theories such as gauge theories and matrix models. We obtain\nthe interesting result that a large class of quantum theories are expected to\narise as limits of matrix models, which may be related to the well-known\nconjecture of Kazakov.

This family of algebras includes the quantum groups, or at least\nthose that are based on simple (super) Lie or Kac-Moody algebras. Their\nclassification would encompass the so far incompleted classification of\nquantized (super) Kac-Moody algebras and of the (super) Kac-Moody algebras\nthemselves. These can be defined as singular limits of q-algebras, and it is\nevident that to deal with the q-algebras in their full generality is more\nrational than the examination of each singular limit separately. This is not\njust because quantization unifies algebras and superalgebras, but also because\nthe points \"q = 1\" and \"q = -1\" are the most singular points in parameter\nspace. In this paper one of two major hurdles in this classification program\nhas been overcome.

We compute Gaussian measures explicitely for two\nimportant families of nonsymmetric two--mode Gaussian states, namely the states\nof extremal (maximal and minimal) negativities at fixed global and local\npurities, introduced in [G.

Thus Gaussian measures and\nnegativities are definitely inequivalent on nonsymmetric two--mode Gaussian\nstates (even when restricted to extremal states), while they are completely\nequivalent on symmetric states, where moreover the Gaussian entanglement of\nformation coincides with the true one. However, the inequivalence between these\ntwo families of continuous-variable entanglement measures is somehow limited.\nIn fact we show rigorously that, at fixed negativities, the Gaussian\nentanglement measures are bounded from below, and we provide strong evidence\nthat they are also bounded from above. \n\n"}
