III:\n  Results for the 2002--2007 data-taking period Abstract: The Russian-American experiment SAGE began to measure the solar neutrino\ncapture rate with a target of gallium metal in Dec. 1989. Measurements have\ncontinued with only a few brief interruptions since that time. We give here the\nexperimental improvements in SAGE since its last published data summary in Dec.\n2001. Assuming the solar neutrino production rate was constant during the\nperiod of data collection, combined analysis of 168 extractions through Dec.\n2007 gives a capture rate of solar neutrinos with energy more than 233 keV of\n65.4 (+3.1)(-3.0) (stat) (+2.6)(-2.8) (syst) SNU. The weighted average of the\nresults of all three Ga solar neutrino experiments, SAGE, Gallex, and GNO, is\nnow 66.1 +/- 3.1 SNU, where statistical and systematic uncertainties have been\ncombined in quadrature. During the recent period of data collection a new test\nof SAGE was made with a reactor-produced 37Ar neutrino source. The ratio of\nobserved to calculated rates in this experiment, combined with the measured\nrates in the three prior 51Cr neutrino-source experiments with Ga, is 0.87 +/-\n0.05. A probable explanation for this low result is that the cross section for\nneutrino capture by the two lowest-lying excited states in 71Ge has been\noverestimated. If we assume these cross sections are zero, then the standard\nsolar model including neutrino oscillations predicts a total capture rate in Ga\nin the range of 63-66 SNU with an uncertainty of about 4%, in good agreement\nwith experiment. We derive the current value of the neutrino flux produced in\nthe Sun by the proton-proton fusion reaction to be (6.0 +/- 0.8) x\n10^(10)/(cm^2 s), which agrees well with the pp flux predicted by the standard\nsolar model.

If neutrino is its own\nantiparticle, the immediate consequence is lepton number violation through the\nneutrinoless double beta decay. However, colliders such as the LHC offer a hope\nof seeing directly the same phenomenon, and moreover the Majorana nature of new\nparticles needed to complete the Standard Model. I review here the salient\nfeatures of these phenomena, and then turn to grand unification as a way of\nprobing the scale of the relevant new physics. The minimal supersymmetric\nSO(10) theory basically eliminates the LHC physics, but leads naturally to the\nlarge atmospheric mixing angle and furthermore predicts $\\theta_{13} \\simeq\n10^\\circ$ without any additional symmetries, in agreement with new T2K and\nMINOS data. It also assures that the R-parity is exact and thus leads to the\nstable LSP as a natural Dark Matter candidate.

The Yukawa couplings of the triplet fermion and the\nleft-handed neutrinos with the doublet Higgs field produce the Dirac mass\nterms. Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light\nneutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses. We point out that it is also possible\nto have a quadruplet Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate\nthe seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet Higgs is\nconstrained to be small by electroweak precision data. Therefore the Yukawa\ncouplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those for a doublet. We also\nfind that unlike the usual Type III seesaw model where at least two copies of\nleptonic triplets are needed, with both doublet and quadruplet Higgs\nrepresentations, just one leptonic triplet is possible to have a\nphenomenologically acceptable model because light neutrino masses can receive\nsizable contributions at both tree and one loop levels. Large Yukawa couplings\nof the quadruplet can induce observable effects for lepton flavor violating\nprocesses $\\mu \\to e \\gamma$ and $\\mu - e$ conversion. Implications of the\nrecent $\\mu \\to e\\gamma$ limit from MEG and also limit on $\\mu - e $ conversion\non Au are also given.

A possible scenario for such physics is a 5D warped model of\nfermion masses and mixing, with Kaluza-Klein masses m_KK ~ 10 TeV, allowing it\nto avoid tension with stringent constraints, especially from flavor data.\nDiscovery of a Standard-Model-like Higgs boson, for which there are some hints\nat ~125 GeV at the LHC, would also require the KK masses to be at or above 10\nTeV. These warped models generically predict the appearance of a much lighter\nradion scalar.

General forms of TMD-factorization fail\nfor such processes because of a previously noted incompatibility between the\nrequirements for TMD-factorization and the Ward identities of non-Abelian gauge\ntheories. We first review the basic steps for factorizing the gluon\ndistribution and then show that a conflict between TMD-factorization and the\nnon-Abelian Ward identity arises already at the level of a single extra soft or\ncollinear gluon when the partonic subprocess involves a TMD gluon distribution.\nNext we show that the resulting TMD-factorization violating effects produce\nleading-power final state spin asymmetries that would be classified as\nsubleading in a generalized TMD-factorization framework. We argue that similar\nextra TMD-factorization breaking effects may be necessary to explain a range of\nopen phenomenological QCD puzzles.

The main parameters needed for the neutrinoless double\nbeta decay analysis are described. A background model was developed to describe\nthe observed energy spectrum. The model contains several contributions, that\nare expected on the basis of material screening or that are established by the\nobservation of characteristic structures in the energy spectrum. The model\npredicts a flat energy spectrum for the blinding window around Q_bb with a\nbackground index ranging from 17.6 to 23.8*10^{-3} counts/(keV kg yr). A part\nof the data not considered before has been used to test if the predictions of\nthe background model are consistent. The observed number of events in this\nenergy region is consistent with the background model. The background at Q-bb\nis dominated by close sources, mainly due to 42K, 214Bi, 228Th, 60Co and alpha\nemitting isotopes from the 226Ra decay chain. The individual fractions depend\non the assumed locations of the contaminants. It is shown, that after removal\nof the known gamma peaks, the energy spectrum can be fitted in an energy range\nof 200 kev around Q_bb with a constant background.

We consider couplings for this\nfield which give rise to observable effects including a nuclear electric dipole\nmoment, and axial nucleon and electron moments. These moments oscillate rapidly\nwith frequencies accessible in the laboratory, ~ kHz to GHz, given by the dark\nmatter mass. Thus, in contrast to WIMP detection, instead of searching for the\nhard scattering of a single dark matter particle, we are searching for the\ncoherent effects of the entire classical dark matter field. We calculate\ncurrent bounds on such time varying moments and consider a technique utilizing\nNMR methods to search for the induced spin precession.

We examine the constraints using the latest results from the 8 TeV run\nat the LHC. Both direct searches and Higgs precision physics are taken into\naccount.

A UV\nlaser instead can create straight ionization tracks in liquid argon, and allows\none to map the drift field along different paths in the TPC inner volume. Here\nwe present a UV laser feed-through design with a steerable UV mirror immersed\nin liquid argon that can point the laser beam at many locations through the\nTPC. The straight ionization paths are sensitive to drift field distortions, a\nfit of these distortion to the linear optical path allows to extract the drift\nfield, by using these laser tracks along the whole TPC volume one can obtain a\n3D drift field map. The UV laser feed-through assembly is a prototype of the\nsystem that will be used for the MicroBooNE experiment at the Fermi National\nAccelerator Laboratory (FNAL). \n\n"}

From the evolution of CCE\nwith fluence, it is possible to directly observe the effect of the radiation\ninduced defects to the ability of the detector to collect charge carriers\ngenerated by traversing minimum ionizing particles (mip). In this paper the\nnumerically simulated CCE and CCE loss between the strips of irradiated silicon\nstrip detectors are presented. The simulations based on Synopsys Sentaurus TCAD\nframework were performed before and after irradiation for fluences up to\n$1.5\\times10^{15}$ $\\textrm{n}_{\\textrm{eq}}$cm$^{-2}$ for the n-on-p sensors.\nA two level and non-uniform three level defect models were applied for the\nproton irradiation simulations and two level model for neutrons. The results\nare presented together with the measurements of strip detectors irradiated by\ndifferent particles and fluences and show considerable agreement for both CCE\nand its position dependency. \n\n"}

HPXe chambers are capable\nof imaging electron tracks, a feature that enhances the separation between\nsignal events (the two electrons emitted in the 0nbb decay of 136Xe) and\nbackground events, arising chiefly from single electrons of kinetic energy\ncompatible with the end-point of the 0nbb decay (Qbb ). Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction. Due to electron multiple scattering, this\nstrategy is not perfectly efficient on an event-by-event basis, but a\nstatistical estimator can be constructed which can be used to reject background\nevents by one order of magnitude at a moderate cost (approx. 30%) in signal\nefficiency.

We discuss some of\nthe challenges for this technology, for which balancing the goal of achieving\nthe best sensitivity with that of cost effective scale-up requires optimization\nover a large parameter space. Critical for this are the precision measurements\nof the fundamental properties of both electron and nuclear recoil tracks down\nto the lowest detectable energies. Such measurements are necessary to provide a\nbenchmark for background discrimination and directional sensitivity that could\nbe used for future optimization studies for directional dark matter\nexperiments. In this paper we describe a small, high resolution, high signal-\nto-noise GEM-based TPC with a 2D CCD readout designed for this goal. The\nperformance of the detector was characterized using alpha particles, X-rays,\ngamma-rays, and neutrons, enabling detailed measurements of electron and\nnuclear recoil tracks. Stable effective gas gains of greater than $1 \\times\n10^5$ were obtained in 100 Torr of pure CF$_4$ by a cascade of three standard\nCERN GEMs each with a 140 $\\mu$m pitch. The high signal-to-noise and\nsub-millimeter spatial resolution of the GEM amplification and CCD readout,\ntogether with low diffusion, allow for excellent background discrimination\nbetween electron and nuclear recoils down below $\\sim$10 keVee ($\\sim$23 keVr\nfluorine recoil).

We\nfill a large time projection chamber with a VUV scintillating gas, plus an\nunusually small admixture dopant gas with a low ionization threshhold (and a\nhigh ionization yield), akin to a highly-underquenched Penning mixture.\nScintillation photons travel far from a primary ionization site before\nconverting into photoionization electrons. Using standard TPC methods, we can\nseparately count both the primary ionization electrons (which occur along a\ndense track) and the scintillation-ionization electrons (which will occur over\na large spherical region) without the use of PMTs. The scheme is compatible\nwith very large detectors, in both two-phase and single-phase high pressure\nconfigurations.

In this spirit,\nwe investigate possible dark matter realizations in the context of the\n$U(1)_{B-L}$ model: (i) Dirac fermion with unbroken B-L; (ii) Dirac fermion\nwith broken B-L; (iii) scalar dark matter; (iv) two component dark matter.

Results are presented on the reconstruction of Michel\nelectrons produced by the decay at rest of cosmic-ray muons. Michel electrons\nare abundantly produced in the TPC, and given their well known energy spectrum\ncan be used to study MicroBooNE's detector response to low-energy electrons\n(electrons with energies up to ~50 MeV).

This thesis concentrates on the\nunderstanding of the LMR enhancement regarding its $M_{ee}$, $p_{T}$ and energy\ndependence. It studies dielectron production in Au+Au collisions at beam\nenergies of 19.6, 27, 39, and 62.4 GeV with sufficient statistics. In\nconjunction with the published STAR results at top RHIC energy, this thesis\npresents results on the first comprehensive energy-dependent study of\ndielectron production.\n  The comparison of $M_{ee}$- and $p_{T}$-spectra with cocktail simulations of\nhadronic sources reveals a sizeable and steadily increasing excess yield in the\nLMR at all beam energies. The scenario of broadened in-medium $\\rho$ spectral\nfunctions proves to not only serve well as dominating underlying source but\nalso to be universal in nature since it quantitatively and qualitatively\nexplains the LMR enhancements from SPS to top RHIC energies. It shows that most\nof the enhancement is governed by interactions of the $\\rho$ meson with thermal\nresonance excitations in the late(r)-stage hot and dense hadronic phase. This\nconclusion is supported by the energy-dependent measurement of integrated LMR\nexcess yields and enhancement factors. The former do not exhibit a strong\ndependence on beam energy as expected from the approximately constant total\nbaryon density above 20 GeV, and the latter show agreement with the CERES\nmeasurement at SPS energy. The consistency in excess yields and agreement with\nmodel calculations over the wide RHIC energy regime makes a strong case for LMR\nenhancements on the order of a factor 2-3. \n\n"}

Long duration\ngamma-ray burst (GRB) blast waves have been considered as potential\nacceleration sites of UHECRs. These CRs are expected to interact with GRB\nafterglow photons, which is synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons\nco-accelerated with CRs in the blast wave, and naturally produce UHE neutrinos.\nFluxes of these neutrinos are uncertain, however, and crucially depend on the\nobserved afterglow modeling. We have selected a sample of 23 long duration GRBs\nwithin redshift 0.5 for which adequate electromagnetic afterglow data are\navailable and which could produce high flux of UHE afterglow neutrinos, being\nnearby. We fit optical, X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray afterglow data with an adiabatic\nblast wave model in a constant density interstellar medium and in a wind\nenvironment where the density of the wind decreases as inverse square of the\nradius from the center of the GRB. The blast wave model parameters extracted\nfrom these fits are then used for calculating UHECR acceleration and $p\\gamma$\ninteractions to produce UHE neutrino fluxes from these GRBs. We have also\nexplored the detectability of these neutrinos by currently running and upcoming\nlarge area neutrino detectors, such as the Pierre Auger Observatory, IceCube\nGen-2 and KM3NeT observatories. We find that our realistic flux models from\nnearby GRBs will be unconstrained in foreseeable future. \n\n"}

Also the UCN\ntransparency of the bulk sD_2 material must be high because crystal\ninhomogeneities limit the mean free path for elastic scattering and reduce the\nextraction efficiency. Observations at the UCN sources at Paul Scherrer\nInstitute and at Los Alamos National Laboratory consistently show a decrease of\nthe UCN yield with time of operation after initial preparation or later\ntreatment (`conditioning') of the sD_2.

We present an exhaustive study of the charged-current and\nneutral-current neutrino and antineutrino pion production off nucleons, paying\na special attention to the angular distributions of the outgoing pion. We show,\nusing general arguments, that parity violation and time-reversal odd\ncorrelations in the weak differential cross sections are generated from the\ninterference between different contributions to the hadronic current that are\nnot relatively real. Next, we present a detailed comparison of three, state of\nthe art, microscopic models for electroweak pion production off nucleons, and\nwe also confront their predictions with polarized electron data, as a test of\nthe vector content of these models.

In particular, the polarized DiFFs can be\naccessed in electron-positron annihilation by measuring azimuthal correlations\nbetween two back-to-back pairs of hadrons in the center of mass system, where\nthe relevant structure functions can be expressed as convolutions of two\n(polarized) DiFFs. Here we explore the advantages of measuring the inclusive\nback-to-back production of a single hadron on one side against a hadron pair on\nthe opposite side of the detector in two jet events. The leading twist cross\nsection for this process contains convolutions of the corresponding single\nhadron FFs on one side and the DiFFs for the hadron pair on the other side,\nwhich furnishes several interesting new opportunities.

However, with this design\nthe majority of photons are lost in insensitive regions between photodetectors,\nwhile at the same time most photodetectors are outside the ring and remain\ndark. To fix both issues at once, we propose fixing retro-reflectors between\nall photodetectors. These devices will reflect uncollected photons back through\ntheir emission point onto photodetectors at the other side of the tank,\nproducing a secondary, delayed Cherenkov ring.

To\nmeet the physics goals, the vertex and tracking detectors require not only a\nspatial resolution of a few micrometers and a very low material budget, but\nalso timing capabilities with a precision of a few nanoseconds to allow\nsuppression of beam-induced backgrounds.\n  Different technologies using hybrid silicon detectors are explored for the\nvertex detectors, such as dedicated readout ASICs, small-pitch active edge\nsensors as well as capacitively coupled High-Voltage CMOS sensors.
