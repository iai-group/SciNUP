Flavour symmetry breaking entails non-ideal\nflavour content for these states.

It\nis confirmed that in the chiral limit the \\eta^\\prime mass is proportional to\nthe matrix element which connects this state to the vacuum via the topological\nsusceptibility. The implications of the mass formulae are illustrated using an\nelementary dynamical model, which includes an Ansatz for that part of the\nBethe-Salpeter kernel related to the non-Abelian anomaly.

We investigate the\ndependence of light scattering properties on wavelength, cluster size and\nporosity using these aggregate models. We find that while the shape of the\nphase function depends mainly on the size parameter of the aggregates, the\nlinear polarization depends on both the size parameter and the porosity of the\naggregates, with increasing degree of polarization as the porosity increases.\nContrary to previous studies, we argue that monomer size has negligible effects\non the light scattering properties of ballistic aggregates, as long as the\nconstituent monomer is smaller than the incident wavelength up to\n2*pi*a_0/lambda\\sim 1.6 where a_0 is the monomer radius.

However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems.

By using mock galaxy catalogues of the SDSS-DR4\nbuilt up from the Millennium Simulation, we explore how the way of building a\nCS might introduce biases which could affect the interpretation of results. We\nmake use of the fact that the physics of interactions is not included in the\nsemianalytic model, to infer that any difference between the mock control and\npair samples can be ascribed to selection biases. Thus, we find that galaxies\nin pairs artificially tend to be older and more bulge-dominated, and to have\nless cold gas and different metallicities than their isolated counterparts.\nAlso because of a biased selection, galaxies in pairs tend to live in higher\ndensity environments, and in haloes of larger masses. We find that imposing\nconstraints on redshift, stellar masses and local densities diminishes the\nselection biases by ~70%. Based on these findings, we suggest observers how to\nbuild an unique and unbiased CS in order to reveal the effect of galaxy\ninteractions. \n\n"}

Here, we estimate\nthe overall probabilities for lensing by substructures in a host halo closely\naligned to the line of sight to a background quasar. Under the assumption that\nthe quasar can be approximated as a point source, the optical depth for strong\ngravitational lensing by subhalos typically turns out to be very small (tau <\n0.01), contrary to previous claims. We therefore conclude that it is currently\nnot feasible to use this strategy to put the simulation predictions for the\ndark matter subhalo population to the test.

Depending on the\nproperties of the underlying galaxies, do black holes always form a close\nKeplerian binary? If a binary forms, does hardening proceed down to the domain\ncontrolled by gravitational wave back reaction? What is the role played by gas\nand/or stars in braking the black holes, and on which timescale does\ncoalescence occur? Can the black holes accrete on flight and shine during their\npathway to coalescence?

However, chiral three-nucleon\nforces (3NF) have been used only at N2LO, improving some miscroscopic\npredictions, but leaving also several issues, like the \"Ay puzzle'\" of\nnucleon-deuteron scattering, unresolved. Thus, the 3NF at N3LO is needed for\nessentially two reasons: For consistency with the 2NF, and to (hopefully)\nimprove some critical predictions of nuclear structure and reactions. However,\nthere are indications that the 3NF at N3LO (in the so-called Delta-less version\nof the theory) is rather weak and may not solve any of the outstanding\nproblems.

The amplitude of\nCMB convergence in a given direction measures the projected surface density of\nmatter. Measurements of QSO flux decrements trace the small-scale distribution\nof gas along a given line-of-sight. While the cross-correlation between these\ntwo measurements is small for a single line-of-sight, upcoming large surveys\nshould enable its detection. This paper presents analytical estimates for the\nsignal to noise (S/N) for measurements of the cross-correlation between the\nflux decrement and the convergence and for measurements of the\ncross-correlation between the variance in flux decrement and the convergence.\nFor the ongoing BOSS (SDSS III) and Planck surveys, we estimate an S/N of 30\nand 9.6 for these two correlations.

We analyze data from multiple existing\nCMB studies (WMAP5, ACBAR, CBI, BOOMERANG, and QUAD), recent measurement of H_0\n(SHOES), with about two times lower uncertainty (5%) than previous estimates,\nand recent treatments of BAO from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

In\nthis work we explore the possibility of quantization without subsidiary\nconditions. This implies that the theory would contain a third physical state.\nThe presence of such a new (temporal) electromagnetic mode on cosmological\nscales is shown to generate an effective cosmological constant which can\naccount for the accelerated expansion of the universe. This new polarization\nstate is completely decoupled from charged matter, but can be excited\ngravitationally. In fact, primordial electromagnetic quantum fluctuations\nproduced during electroweak scale inflation could naturally explain the\npresence of this mode and also the measured value of the cosmological constant.\nThe theory is compatible with all the local gravity tests, it is free from\nclassical or quantum instabilities and reduces to standard QED in the flat\nspace-time limit.

Yet we do not understand what drives the evolution of LCBGs, nor how\nthey will evolve. Based on single-dish HI observations, we know that they have\na diverse range of properties. LCBGs are HI-rich with M(HI)=10^{9-10.5} M(sun),\nhave moderate M(dyn)=10^{10-12} M(sun), and 80% have gas depletion timescales\nless than 3 Gyr. These properties are consistent with LCBGs evolving into\nlow-mass spirals or high mass dwarf ellipticals or dwarf irregulars. However,\nLCBGs do not follow the Tully-Fisher relation, nor can most evolve onto it,\nimplying that many LCBGs are not smoothly rotating, virialized systems.

The observed high-z LGRB\nrate shows significant excess over that estimated from the star formation\nhistory.

In the case\nthat LGRB rate is purely proportional to the star formation rate (SFR), our\nsimulations poorly reproduce the LGRB rate at z>4, although the simulated log\nN-log P distribution is in good agreement with the observed one.

The Ancient Star Forming disk\n  of NGC 404 Abstract: We present HST/WFPC2 observations across the disk of the nearby isolated\ndwarf S0 galaxy NGC 404, which hosts an extended gas disk. Our deepest field\nreaches the red clump and main-sequence stars with ages <500 Myr. Although we\ndetect trace amounts of star formation at times more recent than 10 Gyr for all\nfields, the proportion of red giant stars to asymptotic giants and main\nsequence stars suggests that the disk is dominated by an ancient (>10 Gyr)\npopulation. Detailed modeling of the color-magnitude diagram suggests that ~70%\nof the stellar mass in the NGC 404 disk formed by z~2 (10 Gyr ago) and at least\n~90% formed prior to z~1 (8 Gyr ago). These results indicate that the stellar\npopulations of the NGC 404 disk are on average significantly older than those\nof other nearby disk galaxies, suggesting that early and late type disks may\nhave different long-term evolutionary histories, not simply differences in\ntheir recent star formation rates. Comparisons of the spatial distribution of\nthe young stellar mass and FUV emission in GALEX images show that the brightest\nFUV regions contain the youngest stars, but that some young stars (<160 Myr)\nlie outside of these regions. FUV luminosity appears to be strongly affected by\nboth age and stellar mass within individual regions. Finally, we use our\nmeasurements to infer the relationship between the star formation rate and the\ngas density of the disk at previous epochs. We find that most of the history of\nthe NGC 404 disk is consistent with star formation that has decreased with the\ngas density according to the Schmidt law. However, 0.5-1 Gyr ago, the star\nformation rate was unusually low for the inferred gas density, consistent with\nthe possibility that there was a gas accretion event that reignited star\nformation ~0.5 Gyr ago. Such an event could explain why this S0 galaxy hosts an\nextended gas disk. \n\n"}

Compared\nto its twins, the Sun exhibits a deficiency of refractory elements (those with\ncondensation temperatures Tc>900K) relative to volatiles (Tc<900K). This\nfinding is speculated to be a signature of the planet formation that occurred\nmore efficiently around the Sun compared with the majority of solar twins.\nFurthermore, within this scenario, it seems more likely that the abundance\npatterns found are specifically related to the formation of terrestrial\nplanets. In this work we analyze abundance results from six large independent\nstellar abundance surveys to determine whether they confirm or reject this\nobservational finding. We show that the elemental abundances derived for solar\nanalogs in these six studies are consistent with the Tc trend suggested as a\nplanet formation signature. The same conclusion is reached when those results\nare averaged heterogeneously. We also investigate the dependency of the\nabundances with first ionization potential (FIP), which correlates well with\nTc. A trend with FIP would suggest a different origin for the abundance\npatterns found, but we show that the correlation with Tc is statistically more\nsignificant. We encourage similar investigations of metal-rich solar analogs\nand late F-type dwarf stars, for which the hypothesis of a planet formation\nsignature in the elemental abundances makes very specific predictions. Finally,\nwe examine a recent paper that claims that the abundance patterns of two stars\nhosting super-Earth like planets contradict the planet formation signature\nhypothesis. Instead, we find that the chemical compositions of these two stars\nare fully compatible with our hypothesis. \n\n"}

II.\n  Measuring the Size of the \"Frozen\" Zone Abstract: Coagulation of submicron-sized dust grains into porous aggregates is the\ninitial step of dust evolution in protoplanetary disks. Recently, it has been\npointed out that negative charging of dust in the weakly ionized disks could\nsignificantly slow down the coagulation process. In this paper, we apply the\ngrowth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (\"frozen\" zone)\nwhere the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage. For\nlow-turbulence disks, we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of\nthe disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star. The maximum mass of the\naggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer\nmasses at 100 AU. Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the\nfrozen zone, but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic\naggregates at later stages. We examine a possibility that complete freezeout of\ndust evolution in low-turbulence disks could be prevented by global transport\nof dust in the disks. Our simple estimation shows that global dust transport\ncan lead to the supply of macroscopic aggregates and the removal of frozen\naggregates on a timescale of 10^6 yr.

Spiral density wave launched by the planet shocks and the\nangular momentum carried by the wave is transferred to the background flow. The\nexchange of the angular momentum can affect the mass flux in the vicinity of\nthe planet to form an underdense region, or gap, around the planetary orbit.

The average iron abundance\nof NGC 1866 turns out to be [Fe/H]= -0.43+-0.01 dex (with a dispersion of 0.04\ndex), from the analysis of 14 cluster-member stars. Within our uncertainties,\nthe cluster stars are homogeneous, as far as chemical composition is concerned,\nindependent of the evolutionary status. The observed cluster stars do not show\nany sign of the light elements 'anti-correlation' present in all the Galactic\nglobular clusters so far studied, and also found in the old LMC stellar\nclusters. A similar lack of anti-correlations has been detected in the massive\nintermediate-age LMC clusters, indicating a different formation/evolution\nscenario for the LMC massive clusters younger than ~3 Gyr with respect to the\nold ones.

All the previous studies on the core-accretion\nmodel assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly. In fact,\nthe envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals\nbecause icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via\nstrong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope. In\nthis paper, we have demonstrated that envelope pollution in general lowers the\ncritical core masses and hastens gas accretion on to the protoplanet because of\nthe increase in the molecular weight and reduction of adiabatic temperature\ngradient. Widely- and highly-polluted envelopes allow smaller cores to form\nmassive envelopes before disc dissipation.

The opacities are calculated by applying the effective medium theory\nassuming that the dust aggregates are a mix of 0.1{\\mu}m silicate and graphite\ngrains and vacuum.

Orbits with arbitrary inclination to the stellar\nrotation axis are considered. We obtain results both from an analytic treatment\nand numerical one that are in satisfactory agreement. These results are applied\nto the initial phase of the tidal circularisation problem. We find that both\ntides induced in the star and planet can lead to a significant decrease of the\norbital semi-major axis for orbits having periastron distances smaller than 5-6\nstellar radii (corresponding to periods $\\sim 4-5$ days after the\ncircularisation has been completed) with tides in the star being much stronger\nfor retrograde orbits compared to prograde orbits. We use the simple Skumanich\nlaw for the stellar rotation with its rotational period equal to one month at\nthe age of 5Gyr. The strength of tidal interactions is characterised by\ncircularisation time scale, $t_{ev}$ defined as a time scale of evolution of\nthe planet's semi-major axis due to tides considered as a function of orbital\nperiod $P_{obs}$ after the process of tidal circularisation has been completed.\nWe find that the ratio of the initial circularisation time scales corresponding\nto prograde and retrograde orbits is of order 1.5-2 for a planet of one Jupiter\nmass and $P_{obs}\\sim $ four days.

Thus, the\neffect of stellar rotation may provide a bias in the formation of planetary\nsystems having planets on close orbits around their host stars, as a\nconsequence of planet-planet scattering, favouring systems with retrograde\norbits.

The\npitch angle, arm width, and spacing of the spiral pattern are entirely\ndetermined by the orbital distance $r_p$ and Mach number of the object. The\narm-interarm density contrast is proportional to the Bondi accretion radius,\ndecreasing as a function of distance with a power index of -1. The background\ndensity distribution is globally changed from initially uniform to centrally\nconcentrated. The vertical structure of the wake is manifested as circular arcs\nwith the center at the object location. The angular extent of the arcs is\ndetermined by the Mach number of the object motion.

In the regime where the disc does not fragment, we show that local\nthermal equilibrium continues to determine the stress - which can be\nrepresented as an effective viscous alpha - out to very long cooling times (at\nleast 240 dynamical times).

The cold, dusty\nclumps surrounding RCW 120 are arranged in an almost spherical shell and\nharbour many young stellar objects. By performing high-resolution,\nthree-dimensional SPH simulations of HII regions expanding into fractal\nmolecular clouds, we investigate whether the formation of massive clumps in\ndense, swept-up shells necessarily requires the C&C mechanism.

We model clusters initially\nin cool collapse, in virial equilibrium and expanding, and place a 1\nJupiter-mass planet at either 5au or 30au from their host stars, with zero\neccentricity. We find that after 10Myr 10% of planets initially orbiting at\n30au have been liberated from their parent star and form a population of\nfree-floating planets. A small number of these planets are captured by other\nstars. A further 10% have their orbital eccentricity significantly altered.

The\nfraction of liberated and disrupted planetary systems is highest for subvirial\nclusters, but virial and supervirial clusters also dynamically process\nplanetary systems, due to interactions in the substructure.

The helium core mass after hydrogen\nburning corresponds to 32 M_solar. Nucleosynthesis calculations have been\nperformed during the stellar evolution and the jetlike supernova explosion of a\ncollapsar model, where the weak s-, p-, and r-processes are taken into account.\nWe confirm that s-elements of 60 < A < 90 are highly overproduced relative to\nthe solar abundances in the hydrostatic nucleosynthesis. During oxygen burning,\np-elements of A > 90 are produced via photodisintegrations of seed s-elements.\nHowever, the produced p-elements are disintegrated in later stages except for\n^{180}Ta. In the explosive nucleosynthesis, elements of 90 < A < 160 are\nsignificantly overproduced relative to the solar values owing to the r-process.\nOnly heavy p-elements (N > 50) are overproduced via the p-process. Compared\nwith the previous study of r-process nucleosynthesis calculations in the\ncollapsar model of 40 M_solar by Fujimoto et al. 2007, 2008, our jet model\ncannot contribute to the third peak of the solar r-elements and intermediate\np-elements.

Our study is relevant to astrobiology as it addresses whether life\non Earth could have been transferred to other planetary systems in the solar\nsystem's birth cluster and whether life on Earth could have been transferred\nhere from beyond the solar system. In the solar system, the timescale over\nwhich solid material was delivered to the region from where it could be\ntransferred via this mechanism likely extended to several hundred million years\n(as indicated by the 3.8-4.0 Ga epoch of the Late Heavy Bombardment).

Their orbital evolution depends on the physical mechanisms that\ncause tidal dissipation, and these are still not well understood. We refine the\ntheory of the equilibrium tide in fluid bodies that are partly or entirely\nconvective, to predict the dynamical evolution of the systems. In particular,\nwe examine the validity of modeling the tidal dissipation by the quality factor\nQ, as is commonly done. We consider here the simplest case where the considered\nstar or planet rotates uniformly, all spins are aligned, and the companion is\nreduced to a point-mass. The first manifestation of the tide is to distort the\nshape of the star or planet adiabatically along the line of centers. This\ngenerates the divergence-free velocity field of the adiabatic equilibrium tide\nwhich is decoupled from the dynamical tide. The tidal kinetic energy is\ndissipated into heat through turbulent friction, which is modeled here as an\neddy-viscosity acting on the adiabatic tidal flow. This dissipation induces a\nsecond velocity field, the dissipative equilibrium tide, which is in quadrature\nwith the exciting potential; it is responsible for the imaginary part of the\ndisturbing function, which is implemented in the dynamical evolution equations,\nfrom which one derives characteristic evolution times. The rate at which the\nsystem evolves depends on the physical properties of tidal dissipation, and\nspecifically on how the eddy viscosity varies with tidal frequency and on the\nthickness of the convective envelope for the fluid equilibrium tide. At low\nfrequency, this tide retards by a constant time delay, whereas it lags by a\nconstant angle when the tidal frequency exceeds the convective turnover rate. \n\n"}

The present work aims to better understand the properties of the\nobserved modes and the nature of their excitation.

The planets invoked in that work were\nsignificantly more massive than Jupiter, and moved on orbits that were mutually\ncrossing - an architecture which suggests that mutual encounters and strong\ngravitational interactions are almost guaranteed. In this work, we perform a\nhighly detailed analysis of the proposed HW Vir planetary system. First, we\nconsider the dynamical stability of the system as proposed in the discovery\nwork. Through a mapping process involving 91,125 individual simulations, we\nfind that the system is so unstable that the planets proposed simply cannot\nexist, due to mean lifetimes of less than a thousand years across the whole\nparameter space. We then present a detailed re-analysis of the observational\ndata on HW Vir, deriving a new orbital solution that provides a very good fit\nto the observational data. Our new analysis yields a system with planets more\nwidely spaced, and of lower mass, than that proposed in the discovery work, and\nyields a significantly greater (and more realistic) estimate of the uncertainty\nin the orbit of the outermost body. Despite this, a detailed dynamical analysis\nof this new solution similarly reveals that it also requires the planets to\nmove on orbits that are simply not dynamically feasible. Our results imply that\nsome mechanism other than the influence of planetary companions must be the\nprincipal cause of the observed eclipse timing variations for HW Vir. If the\nsys- tem does host exoplanets, they must move on orbits differing greatly from\nthose previously proposed. Our results illustrate the critical importance of\nperforming dynamical analyses as a part of the discovery process for\nmultiple-planet exoplanetary systems. \n\n"}

The transition is studied using the Polyakov loop model, with\nthe initial field configuration (in the confining phase) covering a small\nneighborhood of the confining vacuum $l \\simeq 0$, as appropriate for $T <\nT_c$. Quench is implemented by evolving this initial configuration with the\neffective potential at a temperature $T > T_c$. We study the formation of Z(3)\ndomain structure and its evolution during the transition as $l$ rolls down in\ndifferent directions from the top of the central hill in the effective\npotential of $l$. When explicit Z(3) symmetry breaking effects (arising from\ndynamical quark effects) are small, then we find well defined Z(3) domains\nwhich coarsen in time. Remarkably, the magnitude plot of $l$ shows vacuum\nbubble like configurations arising during the quench. This first order\ntransition like behavior occurs even though there is no metastable vacuum\nseparated by a barrier from the true vacuum for the parameter values used. When\nthe initial field configuration everywhere rolls down roughly along the same\ndirection (as will happen with large explicit symmetry breaking) then we do not\nfind such bubble-like configurations. However, in this case we find huge\noscillations of $l$ with large length scales. We show that such large\noscillations can lead to large fluctuations in the evolution of flow\nanisotropies compared to the equilibrium transition case. \n\n"}

All of the\ncandidate clusters reported in this paper are presented for the first time.\nThose confirmed and candidate clusters with available near infrared photometry\ndisplay evidence for a red sequence galaxy population, determined either\nindividually or via a stacking analysis, whose colour is consistent with the\nexpectation of an old, coeval stellar population observed at the cluster\nredshift. We further note that the sample displays a large range of red\nfraction values indicating that the clusters may be at different stages of red\nsequence assembly.

Extremely precise Doppler spectroscopy is an indispensable tool to find\nand characterize earth-like planets; however, to find these planets around\nsolar-type stars, we need nearly one order of magnitude better radial velocity\n(RV) precision than the best current spectrographs provide. Recent developments\nin astrophotonics (Bland-Hawthorn & Horton 2006, Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2010)\nand adaptive optics (AO) enable single mode fiber (SMF) fed, high resolution\nspectrographs, which can realize the next step in precision. SMF feeds have\nintrinsic advantages over multimode fiber or slit coupled spectrographs: The\nintensity distribution at the fiber exit is extremely stable, and as a result\nthe line spread function of a well-designed spectrograph is fully decoupled\nfrom input coupling conditions, like guiding or seeing variations (Ihle et al.\n2010). Modal noise, a limiting factor in current multimode fiber fed\ninstruments (Baudrand & Walker 2001), can be eliminated by proper design, and\nthe diffraction limited input to the spectrograph allows for very compact\ninstrument designs, which provide excellent optomechanical stability.

It has been noted that white dwarfs (WDs) have long-lived habitable\nzones and that a large fraction of WDs may host planets. We point out that\nduring a transit of an Earth-mass planet across a WD, the planet's atmospheric\ntransmission spectrum obtains a much higher contrast over the stellar\nbackground compared to a main-sequence host, because of the small surface area\nof the WD. The most prominent bio-marker in the present-day terrestrial\natmosphere, molecular oxygen, is readily detectable in a WD transit via its\nA-band absorption at ~0.76 micron. A potentially life-sustaining Earth-like\nplanet transiting a WD can be found by assembling a suitable sample of ~500 WDs\nand then surveying them for transits using small telescopes.

II Abstract: In a previous paper we have shown that the function \\Gamma(M,\nEOS)=\\alpha\\beta_{GR}/\\Lambda^{0.9}(R) is constant (~ 0.4) for pre\nmain-sequence stars (PMS), white dwarfs (WD) and for some neutron star (NS)\nmodels, where \\alpha_{GR} and \\beta_{GR} are the form-factors of the\ngravitational potential energy and of the moment of inertia. To investigate the\nstructural evolution of another type of celestial bodies, we use the MESA code\nto extend these calculations to gaseous planets. We show that this function is\nconserved for all models during the whole planetary evolution and is\nindependent of the planet mass. We also analyse the cases for which this\nfunction is not conserved during some stellar evolutionary phases. For the PMS\nto the WD cooling sequences, we have found a connection between the strong\nvariations of \\Gamma(M, EOS) during the intermediary evolutionary phases and\nthe specific nuclear power. A threshold for the specific nuclear power was\ndetermined. Below this limit this function is invariant (~ 0.4) for these\nmodels, i.e., at the initial and final stages (PMS and WD). Concerning NS, we\nstudy the influence of the equation of state (EOS) on this function and refine\nthe exponent of the auxiliary function \\Lambda(R) to be ~ 0.8. It is shown that\nthe function \\Gamma(M, EOS) is also invariant (~ 0.4) and is independent of the\nEOS and of the stellar mass. Therefore, we confirm that regardless of the final\nproducts of the stellar evolution, NS or WD, they recover the initial value of\n\\Gamma(M, EOS) ~ 0.4 acquired at the PMS. Finally, we have introduced a\nmacroscopic stability \"criterion\" for neutron star models based on the\nproperties of the relativistic product \\alpha\\beta_{GR}. \n\n"}

However, formation models are not yet able to predict reliably S_i,\nmaking unjustified the use solely of traditional, 'hot-start' cooling tracks to\ninterpret direct imaging results and calling for an observational determination\nof initial entropies to guide formation scenarios. Using a grid of models in\nmass and entropy, we show how to place joint constraints on the mass and\ninitial entropy of an object from its observed luminosity and age. This\ngeneralises the usual estimate of only a lower bound on the real mass through\nhot-start tracks. Moreover, we demonstrate that with mass information, e.g.\nfrom dynamical stability analyses or radial velocity, tighter bounds can be set\non the initial entropy. We apply this procedure to 2M1207 b and find that its\ninitial entropy is at least 9.2 kB/baryon, assuming that it does not burn\ndeuterium. For the planets of the HR 8799 system, we infer that they must have\nformed with S_i > 9.2 kB/baryon, independent of uncertainties about the age of\nthe star. Finally, a similar analysis for beta Pic b reveals that it must have\nformed with S_i > 10.5 kB/baryon, using the radial-velocity mass upper limit.\nThese initial entropy values are respectively ca. 0.7, 0.5, and 1.5 kB/baryon\nhigher than the ones obtained from core accretion models by Marley et al.,\nthereby quantitatively ruling out the coldest starts for these objects and\nconstraining warm starts, especially for beta Pic b. \n\n"}

Consequently, MS-stable planets do not need to be closely-packed to\nexperience instability during the WD phase.

A significant fraction of\ncompact binaries are ejected from a globular cluster after core collapse. Among\nthe total number of ejected compact objects, 30 per cent of them are in\nbinaries.

Based on our reference assumptions,\nmerger rates of ejected BH-BH and NS-NS binaries per globular cluster are\nestimated to be 2.5 and 0.27 per Gyr, respectively. Assuming the spatial\ndensity of globular clusters to be 8.4 h^3 clusters Mpc^-3 and extrapolating\nthe merger rate estimates to the horizon distance of the advanced LIGO-Virgo\nnetwork, we expect the detection rates for BH-BH and NS-NS binaries with\ncluster origin are to be 15 and 0.024 yr^-1, respectively.

The phenomenology of such\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretors is particularly rich when an accretion\ndisc forms around the secondary. The outer radius of such discs is commonly\nestimated from the net angular momentum produced by a density variation of\nmaterial across the BHL or Bondi accretion cylinder, as the latter is tilted\nwith respect to the direction to the primary due to orbital motion. But this\napproach has ignored the fact that the wind experiences an outward driving\nforce that the secondary does not. In actuality, the accretion stream falls\ntoward a retarded point in the secondary's orbit as the secondary is pulled\ntoward the primary relative to the stream. The result is a finite separation or\n\"accretion stream impact parameter\" (ASIP) separating the secondary and stream.\nWhen the orbital radius a_o exceeds the BHL radius r_b, the ratio of outer disc\nradius estimated as the ASIP to the conventional estimate\na_o^{1/2}/r_b^{1/2}>1. We therefore predict that discs will form at larger\nradii from the secondary than traditional estimates. This agrees with the\nimportance of the ASIP emphasized by Huarte-Espinosa et al.

However, the nature of the mechanism responsible for the tidal\ndissipation in such systems remains uncertain. In this paper, we claim that the\nso-called elliptical instability may play a major role in these systems,\nexplaining some systematic features present in the observations. This\nhydrodynamic instability, arising in rotating flows with elliptical\nstreamlines, is suspected to be present in both planet and star of such\nsystems, which are elliptically deformed by tides. The presence and the\ninfluence of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies, such as stars or hot\nJupiters, are most of the time neglected. In this paper, using numerical\nsimulations and theoretical arguments, we consider several features associated\nto the elliptical instability in hot-Jupiter systems. In particular, the use of\nad hoc boundary conditions makes it possible to estimate the amplitude of the\nelliptical instability in gaseous bodies. We also consider the influence of\ncompressibility on the elliptical instability, and compare the results to the\nincompressible case. We demonstrate the ability for the elliptical instability\nto grow in the presence of differential rotation, with a possible synchronized\nlatitude, provided that the tidal deformation and/or the rotation rate of the\nfluid are large enough. Moreover, the amplitude of the instability for a\ncentrally-condensed mass of fluid is of the same order of magnitude as for an\nincompressible fluid for a given distance to the threshold of the instability.\nFinally, we show that the assumption of the elliptical instability being the\nmain tidal dissipation process in eccentric inflated hot Jupiters and\nmisaligned stars is consistent with current data. \n\n"}

This would allow separate\ndeterminations for giant and medium planets of the relationship between the\ninward rate of tidal migration of planets and the strength of the stellar tidal\ndissipation (as expressed by the tidal quality factor Q). We propose a \"Hot Big\nPlanets Survey\" to find new big planets to better determine the planet\noccurrence distribution at the shortest period. We call planets that Kepler\nwill be able to find as \"big\", for the purpose of comparing the distribution of\ngiant and medium planets (above and below 8 earth radii). The distribution of\nplanets from one field has been interpreted to show that the shortest period\ngiant planets are at the end of an ongoing flow of high eccentricity migration,\nlikely from scattering from further out.

The major bottleneck in such\ncomputations is the computation of lightcurves. However, for low-mass planets\nmost of these computations are wasteful, as most lightcurves do not contain\ndetectable planetary signatures. In this paper I develop a parameterization of\nthe binary microlens that is conducive to avoiding lightcurve computations. I\nempirically find analytic expressions describing the limits of the parameter\nspace that contain the vast majority of low-mass planet detections. Through a\nlarge scale simulation I measure the (in)completeness of the parameterization\nand the speed-up it is possible to achieve. For Earth-mass planets in a wide\nrange of orbits it is possible to speed up simulations by a factor of ${\\sim}\n30$-$125$ (depending on the survey's annual duty-cycle) at the cost of missing\n${\\sim} 1$ percent of detections (which is actually a smaller loss than for the\narbitrary parameter limits typically applied in microlensing simulations).

Traditionally, they are included in a\nmean-field description of atomic nuclei through the approximate\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer or Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov formalism. Purpose: We\npropose a new hybrid ''relativistic-mean-field-plus-pairing'' approach in which\npairing is treated exactly so the number of particles is conserved. To verify\nthe reliability of the formalism, we apply it to the study of both ground-state\nproperties and isoscalar monopole excitations of the Tin isotopes. Methods:\nAccurately-calibrated relativistic mean-field models supplemented by an exact\ntreatment of pairing correlations are used to compute ground-state observables\nalong the isotopic chain in Tin. In turn, ground-state densities are used as\ninput to the calculation of giant monopole resonances through a\nconstrained-relativistic approach. Results: We compute a variety of\nground-state observables sensitive to pairing correlations as well as the\nevolution of giant monopole energies along the isotopic chain in Tin. Whereas\nground-state properties are consistent with experiment, we find that pairing\ncorrelations have a minor effect on the giant monopole energies. Conclusions: A\nnew mean-field-plus-pairing approach is introduced to compute properties of\nopen-shell nuclei. The formalism provides an efficient and powerful alternative\nto the computation of both ground-state properties and monopole energies of\nopen-shell nuclei. We find ground-state properties to be well reproduced in\nthis approach.

Additional\nadvances include growing knowledge of the composition of atmospheres of\nextra-solar gas giants, which may be influenced by the variable phases of water\nin the protoplanetary disk. Further, the architecture of extra-solar systems\nleaves strong hints of dynamical interactions, which are important for the\ndelivery of water and subsequent evolution of planetary systems. We conclude\nwith an exploration of water on Earth and note that all of the processes and\nkey parameters identified here should also hold for exoplanetary systems. \n\n"}

These reactor neutrinos have served neutrino\nphysics research from the initial discovery of the neutrino to current\nprecision measurements of neutrino mixing angles. The prediction of the\nabsolute flux and energy spectrum of the emitted reactor neutrinos hinges upon\na series of seminal papers based on measurements performed in the 1970s and\n1980s. The steadily improving reactor neutrino measurement techniques and\nrecent re-considerations of the agreement between the predicted and observed\nreactor neutrino flux motivates revisiting the underlying beta spectra\nmeasurements. A method is proposed to use an accelerator proton beam delivered\nto an engineered target to yield a neutron field tailored to reproduce the\nneutron energy spectrum present in the core of an operating nuclear reactor.\nFoils of the primary reactor fissionable isotopes placed in this tailored\nneutron flux will ultimately emit beta particles from the resultant fission\nproducts. Measurement of these beta particles in a time projection chamber with\na perpendicular magnetic field provides a distinctive set of systematic\nconsiderations for comparison to the original seminal beta spectra\nmeasurements. Ancillary measurements such as gamma-ray emission and\npost-irradiation radiochemical analysis will further constrain the absolute\nnormalization of beta emissions per fission. The requirements for unfolding the\nbeta spectra measured with this method into a predicted reactor neutrino\nspectrum are explored. \n\n"}

We use dynamical simulations to show how Vega's hot dust can be created by\nlong-range gravitational scattering of planetesimals from its cold outer\nregions. Planetesimals are scattered progressively inward by a system of 5-7\nplanets from 30-60 AU to very close-in. In successful simulations the outermost\nplanets are typically Neptune-mass.

Its\nmetallicity is [Fe/H] = 0.054+/-0.005 dex and its microturbulence velocity is\n+0.02+/-0.01 km/s higher than solar. Our precise stellar parameters and\ndifferential isochrone analysis show that 18 Sco has a mass of 1.04+/-0.02M_Sun\nand that it is ~1.6 Gyr younger than the Sun. We use precise HARPS radial\nvelocities to search for planets, but none were detected. The chemical\nabundance pattern of 18 Sco displays a clear trend with condensation\ntemperature, showing thus higher abundances of refractories in 18 Sco than in\nthe Sun. Intriguingly, there are enhancements in the neutron-capture elements\nrelative to the Sun. Despite the small element-to-element abundance differences\namong nearby n-capture elements (~0.02 dex), we successfully reproduce the\nr-process pattern in the solar system. This is independent evidence for the\nuniversality of the r-process. Our results have important implications for\nchemical tagging in our Galaxy and nucleosynthesis in general. \n\n"}

Hydrodynamic simulations\nshow a transition from SL to AS rotation as the influence of rotation on\nconvection is reduced, but the opposite transition occurs at a different point\nin the parameter space. The system is bistable, i.e., SL and AS rotation\nprofiles can both be stable. We study the effect of a dynamo-generated magnetic\nfield on the large-scale flows, particularly on the possibility of bistable\nbehavior of differential rotation. We solve the hydromagnetic equations\nnumerically in a rotating spherical shell for a set of different radiative\nconductivities controlling the relative importance of convection. In agreement\nwith earlier findings, our models display SL rotation profiles when the\nrotational influence on convection is strong and a transition to AS when the\nrotational influence decreases. We find that dynamo-generated magnetic fields\nhelp to produce SL differential rotation compared to the hydrodynamic\nsimulations. We do not observe any bistable states of differential rotation.

Purpose: A relativistic energy density functional\n(EDF) is developed to address the complexity of such diverse nuclear systems.\nMoreover, a statistical perspective is adopted to describe the information\ncontent of various physical observables. Methods: We implement the model\noptimization by minimizing a suitably constructed chi-square objective function\nusing various properties of finite nuclei and neutron stars.

Results: A new model, FSUGold2, is\ncreated that can well reproduce the ground-state properties of finite nuclei,\ntheir monopole response, and that accounts for the maximum neutron star mass\nobserved up to date.

Coronal funnels play an important role in the formation and\npropagation of the nascent fast solar wind. Applying Gaussian fitting\nprocedures to the observed line profiles, Doppler velocity, intensity, line\nwidth (FWHM) and electron density have been estimated over CH and adjacent QS\nregion of a North Polar Coronal Hole (NPCH). The aim of this study is to\nidentify the coronal funnels based on spectral signatures. Excess width regions\n(excess FWHM above a threshold level) have been identified in QS and CH. The\nplasma flow inversion (average red-shifts changing to blue-shifts at a specific\nheight) in CH and excess width regions of QS take place at ~\n5.01$\\times$10$^{5}$ K. Furthermore, high density concentration in excess width\nregions of QS provides an indication that these regions are the footprints of\ncoronal funnels. We have also found that non-thermal velocities of CH are\nhigher in comparison to QS confirming that the CHs are the source regions of\nfast solar wind. Doppler and non-thermal velocities as recorded by different\ntemperature lines have been also compared with previously published results. As\nwe go from lower to upper solar atmosphere, down-flows are dominated in lower\natmosphere while coronal lines are dominated by up-flows with a maximum value\nof ~ 10-12 km s$^{-1}$ in QS. Non-thermal velocity increases first but after\nLog T$_{e}$ = 5.47 it decreases further in QS. This trend can be interpreted as\na signature of the dissipation of Alfv\\'en waves, while increasing trend as\nreported earlier may attribute to the signature of the growth of Alfv\\'en waves\nat lower heights. Predominance of occurrence of nano-flares around O {\\sc vi}\nformation temperature could also explain non-thermal velocity trend. \n\n"}

Using recent determinations of the rate of GRBs, their\nluminosity function and properties of their host galaxies, we estimate the\nprobability that a life-threatening (lethal) GRB would take place. Amongst the\ndifferent kinds of GRBs, long ones are most dangerous. There is a very good\nchance (but no certainty) that at least one lethal GRB took place during the\npast 5 Gyr close enough to Earth as to significantly damage life. There is a\n50% chance that such a lethal GRB took place during the last 500 Myr causing\none of the major mass extinction events. Assuming that a similar level of\nradiation would be lethal to life on other exoplanets hosting life, we explore\nthe potential effects of GRBs to life elsewhere in the Galaxy and the Universe.\nWe find that the probability of a lethal GRB is much larger in the inner Milky\nWay (95% within a radius of 4 kpc from the galactic center), making it\ninhospitable to life. Only at the outskirts of the Milky Way, at more than 10\nkpc from the galactic center, this probability drops below 50%. When\nconsidering the Universe as a whole, the safest environments for life (similar\nto the one on Earth) are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large\ngalaxies and life can exist in only ~ 10% of galaxies. Remarkably, a\ncosmological constant is essential for such systems to exist. Furthermore,\nbecause of both the higher GRB rate and galaxies being smaller, life as it\nexists on Earth could not take place at $z > 0.5$. Early life forms must have\nbeen much more resilient to radiation. \n\n"}

We hypothesize that the\nin-situ breakup of small bodies such as asteroids spun to fission during the\ngiant branch phases of stellar evolution provides an important contribution to\nthis debris. The YORP effect, which arises from radiation pressure, accelerates\nthe spin rate of asymmetric asteroids, which can eventually shear themselves\napart. This pressure is maintained and enhanced around dying stars because the\noutward push of an asteroid due to stellar mass loss is insignificant compared\nto the resulting stellar luminosity increase. Consequently, giant star\nradiation will destroy nearly all bodies with radii in the range 100 m - 10 km\nthat survive their parent star's main sequence lifetime within a distance of\nabout 7 au; smaller bodies are spun apart to their strongest, competent\ncomponents. This estimate is conservative, and would increase for highly\nasymmetric shapes or incorporation of the inward drag due to giant star stellar\nwind.

The wind contribution is uncertain because\nthe boundary between the wind and interstellar medium is difficult to observe.\nMid-infrared observations (e.g., of the H II region RCW 120) show arcs of dust\nemission around O stars, contained well within the H II region bubble. These\narcs could indicate the edge of an asymmetric stellar wind bubble, distorted by\ndensity gradients and/or stellar motion. We present two-dimensional,\nradiation-hydrodynamics simulations investigating the evolution of wind bubbles\nand H II regions around massive stars moving through a dense (n=3000 cm^{-3}),\nuniform medium with velocities ranging from 4 to 16 km/s. The H II region\nmorphology is strongly affected by stellar motion, as expected, but the wind\nbubble is also very aspherical from birth, even for the lowest space velocity\nconsidered. Wind bubbles do not fill their H II regions (we find filling\nfactors of 10-20%), at least for a main sequence star with mass M~30 Msun.\nFurthermore, even for supersonic velocities the wind bow shock does not\nsignificantly trap the ionization front. X-ray emission from the wind bubble is\nsoft, faint, and comes mainly from the turbulent mixing layer between the wind\nbubble and the H II region. The wind bubble radiates <1 per cent of its energy\nin X-rays; it loses most of its energy by turbulent mixing with cooler\nphotoionized gas. Comparison of the simulations with the H II region RCW 120\nshows that its dynamical age is <=0.4 Myr and that stellar motion <=4 km/s is\nallowed, implying that the ionizing source is unlikely to be a runaway star but\nmore likely formed in situ.

We found that the infall of matter\nfrom the external environment can significantly alter the disk properties as\ncompared to those seen in the isolated model. Depending on the magnitude and\ndirection of rotation of the external environment, a variety of disks can form\nincluding compact (<= 200 AU) ones shrinking in size due to infall of external\nmatter with low angular momentum, as well as extended disks forming due to\ninfall of external matter with high angular momentum.

The tilt\nangle between the circumbinary disk plane and the binary orbital plane is\nassumed to be very small. We find that there is a radius within/beyond which\nthe circumbinary disk is unstable to radiation-driven warping, depending on the\ndisk density and temperature gradient indices. This marginally stable warping\nradius is very sensitive to viscosity parameters, a fiducial disk radius and\nthe temperature measured there, the stellar luminosity, and the disk surface\ndensity at a radius where the disk changes from the optically thick to thin for\nthe irradiation from the central stars.

However, most studies of tidal downsizing end\nwhen the protostellar disc disperses, while the system is embedded in its\nparent star-forming region. To compare disc fragment descendants with exoplanet\nand brown dwarf observations, the subsequent dynamical evolution must be\nexplored.\n  We carry out N-Body integrations of fragment-fragment scattering in\nmulti-object star systems, and star systems embedded in substructured clusters.\nIn both cases, we use initial conditions generated by population synthesis\nmodels of tidal downsizing.\n  The scattering simulations produce a wide range of eccentricities.

We explored two cases: cluster dispersal\nthrough planetary gravity alone over 1 Gyr, and a 1 Gyr evolution due to both\ngravity and the Yarkovsky effect. We find that the dispersal of the cluster in\neccentricity is primarily due to dynamical chaos, while the inclinations and\nlibration amplitudes are primarily changed by the Yarkovsky effect. Current\ndistribution of the cluster members orbits are indicative of an initially tight\norbital grouping that was affected by a negative acceleration (i.e. one against\nthe orbital motion) consistent with the thermal Yarkovsky effect. We conclude\nthat the cluster is a genetic family formed either in a collision or through\nmultiple rotational fissions. The cluster's age is on the order of 1 Gyr, and\nits long-term orbital evolution is likely dominated by the seasonal, rather\nthan diurnal, Yarkovsky effect.

We present a new\norbital solution after removing the two main contributions to the stellar\njitter, one that varies with the photometric period and another that varies\nwith the synodic period of the star+planet system. We use a new method to\ndetermine these jitter components, considering them as a second and third\nsignals in the system. A discussion on possible magnetic\nstar-planet-interaction is included, based on the Bayesian analysis of the\nactivity indices.

In typical ($10 \\,\nM_\\odot \\lesssim M \\lesssim 20 \\, M_\\odot$) supernova progenitors, IGW may\nsubstantially spin down the core, leading to iron core rotation periods $P_{\\rm\nmin,Fe} \\gtrsim 30 \\, {\\rm s}$. Angular momentum (AM) conservation during the\nsupernova would entail minimum NS rotation periods of $P_{\\rm min,NS} \\gtrsim 3\n\\, {\\rm ms}$. In most cases, the combined effects of magnetic torques and IGW\nAM transport likely lead to substantially longer rotation periods. However, the\nstochastic influx of AM delivered by IGW during shell burning phases inevitably\nspin up a slowly rotating stellar core, leading to a maximum possible core\nrotation period.

In the flavor-space locked configuration, the electric and magnetic\nfields of each flavor are parallel and mutually orthogonal to other flavors,\nwith isotropic and homogeneous stress-energy.

The technique assumes the velocity map of an un-lensed,\nstably-rotating galaxy will be rotationally symmetric. Lensing distorts the\nvelocity map making it asymmetric. The degree of lensing can be inferred by\ndetermining the transformation required to restore axisymmetry. This technique\nis in contrast to traditional weak lensing methods, which require averaging an\nensemble of background galaxy ellipticity measurements, to obtain a single\nshear measurement.

Our aims are to provide constraints on the age of the planets in HD\n100546 and to explore the potential evidence for sequential planet formation in\ntransition disks such as HD 100546.\n  Methods. We compare the recent resolved continuum observations of the disk\naround HD 100546 with the results of dust evolution simulations using an\nanalytical prescription for the shapes of gaps carved by massive planets.\n  Results. An inner pressure bump must have been present since early in the\ndisk lifetime to have good agreement between the dust evolution models and the\ncontinuum observations of HD 100546. This pressure bump may have resulted from\nthe presence of a very massive planet ($\\sim20 M_{\\rm{Jup}}$), which formed\nearly in the inner disk ($r\\sim$10 AU). If only this single planet exists, the\ndisk is likely to be old, comparable to the stellar age ($\\sim$5-10 Myr).\nAnother possible explanation is an additional massive planet in the outer disk\n($r\\sim70$ AU): either a low-mass outer planet ($\\lesssim5 M_{\\rm{Jup}}$)\ninjected at early times, or a higher mass outer planet ($\\gtrsim15\nM_{\\rm{Jup}}$) formed very recently, traps the right amount of dust in pressure\nbumps to reproduce the observations. In the latter case, the disk could be much\nyounger ($\\sim3.0$ Myr).\n  Conclusions. In the case in which two massive companions are embedded in the\ndisk around HD 100546, as suggested in the literature, the outer companion\ncould be at least $\\gtrsim$2.5 Myr younger than the inner companion. \n\n"}

We have carried out three\ndimensional (3-D) hydrodynamical simulations to study spiral wakes/shocks\nexcited by young planets. We find that, in contrast with linear theory, the\npitch angle of spiral arms does depend on the planet mass, which can be\nexplained by the non-linear density wave theory. A secondary (or even a\ntertiary) spiral arm, especially for inner arms, is also excited by a massive\nplanet. With a more massive planet in the disk, the excited spiral arms have\nlarger pitch angle and the separation between the primary and secondary arms in\nthe azimuthal direction is also larger. We also find that although the arms in\nthe outer disk do not exhibit much vertical motion, the inner arms have\nsignificant vertical motion, which boosts the density perturbation at the disk\natmosphere.

For the time being there is a long-lasting controversy on how\nthese long-term variations, observed for more than 50 years in the inner\nheliosphere, are formed. It is widely believed that the 11-year variation is\ndue entirely to the toroidal branch of solar activity (the area and number of\nsunspots, the strength of the heliospheric magnetic field etc) because of the\ndiffusion, convection and adiabatic energy loss, while the much smaller 22-year\nvariation is caused by the particle drifts connected with the poloidal branch\nof solar activity (the high-latitude solar magnetic fields). At the same time,\nboth past and more recent numerical simulations indicate that the contribution\nof particle drifts could be significant for both 22- and 11-year variations in\nthe GCR intensities. However, even those who agree on the significant influence\nof drifts appear to have different perceptions on the mechanisms of this\ninfluence.

This concept, called as\ndensified pupil spectroscopy, allows us to perform high, stable\nspectrophotometry against telescope pointing jitter and deformation of the\nprimary mirror. This densified pupil spectrometer comprises the following three\nroles: division of a pupil into a number of sub-pupils, densification of each\nsub-pupil, and acquisition of the spectrum of each sub-pupil with a\nconventional spectrometer. Focusing on the fact that the divided and densified\nsub-pupil can be treated as a point source, we discovered that a simplified\nspectrometer allows us to acquire the spectra of the densified sub-pupils on\nthe detector plane-an optical conjugate with the primary mirror-by putting the\ndivided and densified sub-pupils on the entrance slit of the spectrometer. The\nacquired multiple spectra are not principally moved on the detector against\nlow-order aberrations such as the telescope pointing jitter and any deformation\nof the primary mirror. The reliability of the observation result is also\nincreased by statistically treating them. Our numerical calculations show that,\nbecause this method suppresses the instrumental systematic errors down to 10\nppm under telescopes with modest pointing accuracy, next-generation space\ntelescopes with more than 2.5m diameter potentially provide opportunities to\ncharacterize temperate super-Earths around nearby late-type stars through the\ntransmission spectroscopy and secondary eclipse. \n\n"}

The water snow line lies in the planet formation region at < 10\nAU, and so far its location has been estimated only indirectly from\nspatially-unresolved spectroscopy. This work presents a proof-of-concept method\nto directly image the water snow line in protoplanetary disks through its\nphysical and chemical imprint in the local dust properties. We adopt a physical\ndisk model that includes dust coagulation, fragmentation, drift, and a change\nin fragmentation velocities of a factor 10 between dry silicates and icy grains\nas found by laboratory work. We find that the presence of a water snow line\nleads to a sharp discontinuity in the radial profile of the dust emission\nspectral index {\\alpha}_mm, due to replenishment of small grains through\nfragmentation.

To carry out these studies, we implement and test a particle-mesh\nself-gravity module for the Athena code that enables the simulation of\naerodynamically coupled systems of gas and collisionless self-gravitating solid\nparticles. Upon employment of our algorithm to planetesimal formation\nsimulations, we find that (when a direct comparison is possible) the Athena\nsimulations yield predicted planetesimal properties that agree well with those\nfound in prior work using different numerical techniques. In particular, the\ngravitational collapse of streaming-initiated clumps leads to an initial\nplanetesimal mass function that is well-represented by a power-law, dN/dM ~\nM^{-p}, with p = 1.6 +/- 0.1, which equates to a differential size distribution\ndN/dR ~ R^{-q}, with q = 2.8 +/- 0.1.

We present HARPS\nobservations of sunlight scattered off the bright asteroid 4/Vesta, from which\nwe deduced the Sun's activity-driven RV variations. In parallel, the HMI\ninstrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory provided us with simultaneous\nhigh spatial resolution magnetograms, Dopplergrams, and continuum images of the\nSun in the Fe I 6173A line. We determine the RV modulation arising from the\nsuppression of granular blueshift in magnetised regions and the flux imbalance\ninduced by dark spots and bright faculae. The rms velocity amplitudes of these\ncontributions are 2.40 m/s and 0.41 m/s, respectively, which confirms that the\ninhibition of convection is the dominant source of activity-induced RV\nvariations at play, in accordance with previous studies. We find the Doppler\nimbalances of spot and plage regions to be only weakly anticorrelated.\nLightcurves can thus only give incomplete predictions of convective blueshift\nsuppression. We must instead seek proxies that track the plage coverage on the\nvisible stellar hemisphere directly. The chromospheric flux index R'_HK derived\nfrom the HARPS spectra performs poorly in this respect, possibly because of the\ndifferences in limb brightening/darkening in the chromosphere and photosphere.\nWe also find that the activity-driven RV variations of the Sun are strongly\ncorrelated with its full-disc magnetic flux density, which may become a useful\nproxy for activity-related RV noise. \n\n"}

Resonance locking arises\ndue to the internal structural evolution of the planet and typically produces\nan outward migration rate comparable to the age of the solar system. Resonance\nlocking predicts a similar migration timescale but a different effective tidal\nquality factor $Q$ governing the migration of each moon.

Thus, the coupled processes of orbital evolution and RLO likely shape\nthe observed distribution of close-in exoplanets and may even be responsible\nfor producing some of the short-period rocky planets.

We show that, although the detailed evolution may depend on several\nproperties of the planetary system, it is largely determined by the core mass\nof the overflowing gas giant.

We show that the geometric effect due to planetary\nobliquity and orbital inclination induce the frequency modulation of the\napparent diurnal periodicity. We construct a model of the frequency modulation\nand compare it with the instantaneous frequency extracted from the\npseudo-Wigner distribution of simulated light curves of a cloudless Earth. The\nmodel provides good agreement with the simulated modulation factor, even for\nthe light curve with Gaussian noise comparable to the signal. Notably, the\nshape of the instantaneous frequency is sensitive to the difference between the\nprograde, retrograde, and pole-on spin rotations.

The\ncentral star grows by accretion from the disk, and irradiation by the central\nstar heats up the disk and generates thermal wind, which results in the disk\ndispersal.

The problem\naddressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants\nbetween solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused\na proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar\nluminosity, solar effective temperature and solar mass parameter) in the\nliterature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the\ntime of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of\nconsistent values becomes increasingly important. To address this, an IAU\nWorking Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy formed in\n2011, uniting experts from the solar, stellar, planetary, exoplanetary and\nfundamental astronomy, as well as from general standards fields to converge on\noptimal values for nominal conversion constants. The effort resulted in the IAU\n2015 Resolution B3, passed at the IAU General Assembly by a large majority. The\nresolution recommends the use of nominal solar and planetary values, which are\nby definition exact and are expressed in SI units. These nominal values should\nbe understood as conversion factors only, not as the true solar/planetary\nproperties or current best estimates. Authors and journal editors are urged to\njoin in using the standard values set forth by this resolution in future work\nand publications to help minimize further confusion. \n\n"}

Our model proposes that atomic carbon\nand oxygen are created from the photodissociation of CO, which is itself\nreleased from volatile-rich bodies in the debris disc due to grain-grain\ncollisions or photodesorption. While the CO lasts less than one orbit, the\natomic gas evolves by viscous spreading resulting in an accretion disc inside\nthe parent belt and a decretion disc outside. The temperature, ionisation\nfraction and population levels of carbon and oxygen are followed with the\nphotodissociation region model Cloudy, which is coupled to a dynamical viscous\n$\\alpha$ model. We present new gas observations of $\\beta$ Pic, of C I observed\nwith APEX and O I observed with Herschel, and show that these along with\npublished C II and CO observations can all be explained with this new model.\nOur model requires a viscosity $\\alpha$ > 0.1, similar to that found in\nsufficiently ionised discs of other astronomical objects; we propose that the\nmagnetorotational instability is at play in this highly ionised and dilute\nmedium.

The collectivity depends on the details of\nthe shell structure around the Fermi levels, in particular the presence of the\norbitals that have the enhanced transition matrix elements of the non-axial\nquadrupole excitation. Quite recently, a sudden decrease in the excitation\nenergy of the $\\gamma$ vibration was observed at RIKEN RIBF for the\nneutron-rich Dy isotopes at $N=106$. Purpose: In the present work, by studying\nsystematically the microscopic structure of the $\\gamma$ vibration in the\nneutron-rich Dy isotopes with $N=98-114$, we try to understand the mechanism of\nthe observed softening. Methods: The low-frequency modes of excitation in the\nneutron-rich rare-earth nuclei are described based on nuclear\ndensity-functional theory. We employ the Skyrme energy-density functionals\n(EDF) in the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculation for the ground states and in\nthe Quasiparticle Random-Phase Approximation (QRPA) for the excitations.\nResults: The lowering of the excitation energy around $N=106$ is reproduced\nwell by employing the SkM* and SLy4 functionals.

The results show that the\nvolatile prestellar fingerprint is modified by the chemistry en route into the\ndisc.

We give an overview of the early\nevolution of disks, discuss the importance of the stellar high-energy radiation\nfor disk evolution and describe the general thermal and chemical structure of\ndisks. Finally we provide an overview of observational tracers of the gas\ncomponent and disk winds. \n\n"}

However, all studies of their gas content show\nthat their gas reservoir ought to be depleted in 0.5-2 Gyr. Thus, SFGs are\nthought to be fed by the continuous accretion of intergalactic gas in order to\nsustain their star-formation activity. However, direct observational evidence\nfor this accretion phenomenon has been elusive. Theoretically, the accreted gas\ncoming from the intergalactic medium is expected to orbit about the halo,\ndelivering not just fuel for star-formation but also angular momentum to the\ngalaxy. This accreting material is thus expected to form a gaseous structure\nthat should be co-rotating with the host once at $r<0.3\\;R_{\\rm vir}$ or\n$r<10-30$ kpc. Because of the rough alignment between the star-forming disk and\nthis extended gaseous structure, the accreting material can be most easily\ndetected with the combination of background quasars and integral field units\n(IFUs). In this chapter, accretion studies using this technique are reviewed. \n\n"}

The results show a remarkable decline in the amplitude of\nthe rotational light curve and in the absolute magnitude. This suggests that\nthe angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight has changed\nnoticeably during the last 16 years as Bienor orbits the Sun. From the light\ncurve amplitude data we are able to determine the orientation of the rotation\naxis of Bienor ($\\beta_p=50\\pm3^{\\circ}$, $\\lambda_p=35\\pm8^{\\circ}$). We are\nalso able to constrain the $b/a$ axial ratio of a triaxial Jacobi ellipsoidal\nbody (with semi-axis $a>b>c$). The best fit is for $b/a=0.45\\pm0.05$, which\ncorresponds to a density value of $594^{+47}_{-35}$ kg$\\,$m$^{-3}$ under the\nusual assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and given that Bienor's rotational\nperiod is 9.17 h.

In particular, we focus on the\ntidal response of a rotating fluid body to the obliquity tide, which may be\nimportant for the evolution of the spin-orbit angle but hardly affects the\norbital evolution. The obliquity tide also provides a torque for the mutual\nprecession of the spin and orbital axes around the total angular momentum\nvector, which has not yet been considered in previous studies on the tidal\ninteractions. In this paper, we first formulate a set of linearized equations\ndescribing the tidal response in spin-orbit misaligned systems, taking into\naccount the precessional motion. Numerical solutions in a homogeneous fluid and\nin a polytrope of index 1 show that dissipative inertial waves can be excited\non top of precession by the obliquity tide in the presence of a rigid core. The\ntidal quality factor associated with the obliquity tide $Q'_{210}$ can be\nseveral orders of magnitude smaller than those associated with other tidal\ncomponents if their frequencies fall outside the frequency range of inertial\nwaves. Therefore, it is possible that the spin-orbit misalignment undergoes\nmuch more rapid decay than the orbital decay in hot Jupiter systems owing to\nthe enhanced dissipation of the obliquity tide. \n\n"}

By extending and\ngeneralising the study of Jones et al (2012), we demonstrate that this\nparameter should be less than or of order unity for a wide range of\nevolutionary scenarios, rising above unity only during the final stages of\noutside in clearing by external photoevaporation. We use this result to assess\nthe reliability of disc mass estimates derived from CO isotopologues and submm\ncontinuum emission by examining the distribution of accretion efficiencies in\nregions which are not subject to external photoevaporation. We find that while\ndust based mass estimates produce results compatible with theoretical\nexpectations assuming canonical dust/gas ratio, the systematically lower CO\nbased estimates yield accretion efficiencies significantly above unity in\ncontrast with the theory. This finding provides additional evidence that CO\nbased disc masses are an under-estimate, in line with arguments that have been\nmade on the basis of chemical modelling of relatively small samples.

Here we present a\nstudy of a sample of stars in the Chamaeleon I star forming region carried out\nusing the VLT/X-Shooter spectrograph. The sample is nearly complete down to\nM~0.1Msun for the young stars still harboring a disk in this region. We derive\nthe stellar and accretion parameters using a self-consistent method to fit the\nbroad-band flux-calibrated medium resolution spectrum. The correlation between\nthe accretion luminosity to the stellar luminosity, and of the mass accretion\nrate to the stellar mass in the logarithmic plane yields slopes of 1.9 and 2.3,\nrespectively. These slopes and the accretion rates are consistent with previous\nresults in various star forming regions and with different theoretical\nframeworks. However, we find that a broken power-law fit, with a steeper slope\nfor stellar luminosity smaller than ~0.45 Lsun and for stellar masses smaller\nthan ~ 0.3 Msun, is slightly preferred according to different statistical\ntests, but the single power-law model is not excluded. The steeper relation for\nlower mass stars can be interpreted as a faster evolution in the past for\naccretion in disks around these objects, or as different accretion regimes in\ndifferent stellar mass ranges. Finally, we find two regions on the mass\naccretion versus stellar mass plane empty of objects. One at high mass\naccretion rates and low stellar masses, which is related to the steeper\ndependence of the two parameters we derived. The second one is just above the\nobservational limits imposed by chromospheric emission.

An envelope of scatterers like\nfree-electrons, atoms/molecules, or haze/clouds affects the Stokes-vector of\nradiation emitted by oblate bodies. Due to high rotation rates, BDs can be\nconsiderably oblate. We present a conics-based radiative transfer (RT) scheme\nfor computing the disc-resolved and disc-integrated polarized emission of an\noblate BD or extrasolar giant planet (EGP) bearing homogenous or patchy clouds.\nAssuming a uniform grey atmosphere, we theoretically examine the\nphotopolarimetric sensitivity to its scattering properties like cloud optical\nthickness and grain-size, concurrently with BD properties, like oblateness,\ninclination and effective temperature, which are all treated as free\nparameters. Additionally, we examine the potential effects of gravitational\ndarkening (GD), revealing that it could significantly amplify disc-integrated\npolarization. GD imparts a non-linear inverse temperature-dependence to the\nresulting polarization.\n  Photopolarimetric observations are sensitive to oblateness and inclination.\nThe degree-of-polarization (DoP) increases in response to both, making it\npotentially useful for assessing the spatial orientation of the BD. Under our\nmodel assumptions, increasing droplet size in optically thick clouds causes a\nblue-ward shift in near-infrared (NIR) colors of BDs --- interesting in view of\nthe observed J-K brightening in L/T transition. For large cloud grains,\npolarization decreases sharply, while transmitted intensity shows a steady\nincrease. BD polarization is thus a potential indicator not only of the\npresence of clouds but also provides information on cloud grain size. \n\n"}

The dependence of the\ntidal interactions on the structural and rotational evolution of the star is of\npeculiar importance and should be correctly treated. We quantify how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of rotating low-mass stars evolves from\nthe pre-main sequence up to the red-giant branch depending on the initial\nstellar mass. We investigate the consequences of this evolution on planetary\norbital evolution. We couple the tidal dissipation formalism described in\nMathis (2015) to the stellar evolution code STAREVOL and apply it to rotating\nstars with masses between 0.3 and 1.4 M$_\\odot$. In addition, we generalize the\nwork of Bolmont & Mathis (2016) by following the orbital evolution of close-in\nplanets using the new tidal dissipation predictions for advanced phases of\nstellar evolution. On the PMS the evolution of tidal dissipation is controlled\nby the evolution of the internal structure of the contracting star. On the MS\nit is strongly driven by the variation of surface rotation that is impacted by\nmagnetized stellar winds braking. The main effect of taking into account the\nrotational evolution of the stars is to lower the tidal dissipation strength by\nabout four orders of magnitude on the main-sequence, compared to a normalized\ndissipation rate that only takes into account structural changes. The evolution\nof the dissipation strongly depends on the evolution of the internal structure\nand rotation of the star.

Our physical explanation of the mechanism\nis based on the theoretical solutions to the Stark problem. We test this idea\nby performing self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations and simplified\ngravitational $N$-body simulations. The $N$-body model reduces the mechanism to\nthe relevant physical processes. The hydrodynamical simulations show the\nmechanism in its full extent, including gas-dynamical and viscous processes in\nthe disc which are not included in the theoretical framework. We find that a\nprotoplanetary disc embedded in a flow changes its orientation as its angular\nmomentum vector tends to align parallel to the relative velocity vector. Due to\nthe force exerted by the flow, orbits in the disc become eccentric, which\nproduces a net torque and consequentially changes the orbital inclination. The\ntilting of the disc causes it to contract. Apart from becoming lopsided, the\ngaseous disc also forms a spiral arm even if the inclination does not change\nsubstantially. The process is most effective at high velocities and\nobservational signatures are therefore mostly expected in massive star-forming\nregions and around winds or supernova ejecta. Our $N$-body model indicates that\nthe interaction with supernova ejecta is a viable explanation for the observed\nspin-orbit misalignment in our solar system. \n\n"}

Abstract: The formation of planets strongly depends on the total amount as well as on\nthe spatial distribution of solids in protoplanetary disks. Thanks to the\nimprovements in resolution and sensitivity provided by ALMA, measurements of\nthe surface density of mm-sized grains are now possible on large samples of\ndisks. Such measurements provide statistical constraints that can be used to\ninform our understanding of the initial conditions of planet formation. We\nanalyze spatially resolved observations of 36 protoplanetary disks in the Lupus\nstar forming complex from our ALMA survey at 890 micron, aiming to determine\nphysical properties such as the dust surface density, the disk mass and size\nand to provide a constraint on the temperature profile. We fit the observations\ndirectly in the uv-plane using a two-layer disk model that computes the 890\nmicron emission by solving the energy balance at each disk radius. For 22 out\nof 36 protoplanetary disks we derive robust estimates of their physical\nproperties. The sample covers stellar masses between ~0.1 and ~2 Solar masses,\nand we find no trend between the average disk temperatures and the stellar\nparameters. We find, instead, a correlation between the integrated sub-mm flux\n(a proxy for the disk mass) and the exponential cut-off radii (a proxy of the\ndisk size) of the Lupus disks. Comparing these results with observations at\nsimilar angular resolution of Taurus-Auriga/Ophiuchus disks found in literature\nand scaling them to the same distance, we observe that the Lupus disks are\ngenerally fainter and larger at a high level of statistical significance.\nConsidering the 1-2 Myr age difference between these regions, it is possible to\ntentatively explain the offset in the disk mass/disk size relation with viscous\nspreading, however with the current measurements other mechanisms cannot be\nruled out. \n\n"}

Most of the previous studies have focused on Sweet-Parker current\nsheets, which, however, are unattainable in typical astrophysical systems.\nHere, we derive a general set of scaling laws for the plasmoid instability in\nresistive and visco-resistive current sheets that evolve over time. Our method\nrelies on a principle of least time that enables us to determine the properties\nof the reconnecting current sheet (aspect ratio and elapsed time) and the\nplasmoid instability (growth rate, wavenumber, inner layer width) at the end of\nthe linear phase. After this phase the reconnecting current sheet is disrupted\nand fast reconnection can occur.

Here we investigate,\nfirstly, whether there is a correlation between the size of starspots - assumed\nto be related to the amplitude of the sinusoid - and their decay timescale and,\nsecondly, whether any such correlation depends on the stellar effective\ntemperature. To determine this, we computed the autocorrelation functions of\nthe light curves of samples of stars from Kepler and fitted them with apodised\nperiodic functions. The light curve amplitudes, representing spot size were\nmeasured from the root-mean-squared scatter of the normalised light curves.

This is consistent with\ncurrent theories of diffusive mechanisms causing starspot decay.

We investigate whether such structures are due to the\nmorphology of the disk itself or if they are instead an intrinsic feature of CN\nemission. With the intention of using CN as a diagnostic, we also address to\nwhich physical and chemical parameters CN is most sensitive. A set of disk\nmodels were run for different stellar spectra, masses, and physical structures\nvia the 2D thermochemical code DALI. An updated chemical network that accounts\nfor the most relevant CN reactions was adopted. Ring-shaped emission is found\nto be a common feature of all adopted models; the highest abundance is found in\nthe upper outer regions of the disk, and the column density peaks at 30-100 AU\nfor T Tauri stars with standard accretion rates. Higher mass disks generally\nshow brighter CN. Higher UV fields, such as those appropriate for T Tauri stars\nwith high accretion rates or for Herbig Ae stars or for higher disk flaring,\ngenerally result in brighter and larger rings. These trends are due to the main\nformation paths of CN, which all start with vibrationally excited H2*\nmolecules, that are produced through far ultraviolet (FUV) pumping of H2. The\nmodel results compare well with observed disk-integrated CN fluxes and the\nobserved location of the CN ring for the TW Hya disk. CN rings are produced\nnaturally in protoplanetary disks and do not require a specific underlying disk\nstructure such as a dust cavity or gap.

We aim to investigate effects of global gas flows on type I\nmigration and also examine planet formation. A simplified approach was taken to\naddress this issue, and N-body simulations with isolation-mass planets were\nalso performed. In previous studies, the effect of gas flow induced by\nturbulence-driven accretion has been taken into account for its desaturation\neffect of the corotation torque. If more rapid gas flows (e.g., wind-driven\naccretion) are considered, the desaturation effect can be modified. In\nMRI-inactive disks, in which the wind-driven accretion dominates the disk\nevolution, the gas flow at the midplane plays an important role. If this flow\nis fast, the corotation torque is efficiently desaturated.

A misaligned\npoloidal dipole axis with the toroidal field leads to more significant\ndisplacement of the dipole axis than the fully aligned case. Finally we discuss\nthe evolution of neutron stars with such magnetic fields on the $P-\\dot{P}$\ndiagram and the observational implications. We find that neutron stars spend a\nvery short time before they cross the Death-Line of the $P-\\dot{P}$ diagram,\ncompared to their characteristic ages. Moreover, the maximum intensity of their\nsurface magnetic field is substantially higher than the dipole component of the\nfield. We argue that SGR 0418+5729 could be an example of this type of\nbehaviour, having a weak dipole field, yet hosting a magnetic spot responsible\nfor its magnetar behaviour. The evolution on the pulse profile and braking\nindex of the Crab pulsar, which are attributed to an increase of its obliquity,\nare compatible with the anticipated drift of the magnetic axis. \n\n"}

Abstract: HD 100546 is one of the few known pre-main-sequence stars that may host a\nplanetary system in its disk. We analyze new VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL polarimetric\nimages of HD 100546 with filters in H$\\alpha$ and the adjacent continuum. We\nhave probed the disk gap and the surface layers of the outer disk, covering a\nregion < 500 mas (< 55 au at 109 pc) from the star, at an angular resolution of\n~ 20 mas. Our data show an asymmetry: the SE and NW regions of the outer disk\nare more polarized than the SW and NE. This can be explained from a\npreferential scattering angle close to 90$^o$, consistent with previous\npolarization images. The outer disk extends from 13 $\\pm$ 2 to 45 $\\pm$ 9 au,\nwith a position angle and inclination of 137 $\\pm$ 5$^o$ and 44 $\\pm$ 8$^o$.\nThe comparison with previous estimates suggests that the disk inclination could\nincrease with the stellocentric distance, although the different measurements\nare still consistent within the error bars. In addition, no direct signature of\nthe innermost candidate companion is detected from polarimetry, confirming\nrecent results based on intensity imagery. We set an upper limit to its mass\naccretion rate < 10$^{-8}$ M$_{\\odot}$/yr for a sub-stellar mass of\n15M$_{Jup}$.

It is tentatively suggested that the bar could be dust dragged by\ninfalling gas that radially flows from the outer disk. This could represent an\nexceptional case in which a small-scale radial inflow is observed in a single\nsystem.

If these discs are prone to\nfragmentation, then they are able to rapidly form objects that are initially of\nseveral Jupiter masses and larger. The fate of these disc fragments (and the\nfate of planetary bodies formed afterwards via core accretion) depends\nsensitively not only on the fragment's interaction with the disc, but with its\nneighbouring fragments.\n  We return to and revise our population synthesis model of self-gravitating\ndisc fragmentation and tidal downsizing. Amongst other improvements, the model\nnow directly incorporates fragment-fragment interactions while the disc is\nstill present. We find that fragment-fragment scattering dominates the orbital\nevolution, even when we enforce rapid migration and inefficient gap formation.\n  Compared to our previous model, we see a small increase in the number of\nterrestrial-type objects being formed, although their survival under tidal\nevolution is at best unclear.

Abstract: Context. Period variations have been detected in a number of eclipsing close\ncompact binary subdwarf B stars (sdBs) and these have often been interpreted as\ncaused by circumbinary massive planets or brown dwarfs. Various evolutionary\nscenarios have been proposed for these stars, but a definite mechanism remains\nto be established. Equally puzzling is the formation of these putative\ncircumbinary objects which must have formed either from the remaining post\ncommon envelope circumbinary disk or survived its evolution. Aims. In this\npaper we review the eclipse time variations (ETVs) exhibited by seven such\nsystems and explore if there is conclusive evidence that the ETVs observed over\nthe last two decades can reliably predict the presence of circumbinary bodies.\nMethods. We report 246 new observations of the seven sdB systems made between\n2013 September and 2017 July using a worldwide network of telescopes. We\ncombined our new data with previously published measurements to analyse the\nETVs of these systems. Results. Our data shows that period variations cannot be\nmodelled simply on the basis of circumbinary objects. This implies that more\ncomplex processes may be taking place in these systems. From eclipse time\nvariations, it has historically been suggested that five of the seven binary\nsystems reported herein had circumbinary objects. Based on our recent\nobservations and analysis only three systems remain serious contenders. We find\nagreement with other observers that at least a decade of observations is\nrequired to establish reliable ephemeris. With longer observational baselines\nit is quite conceivable that the data will support the circumbinary object\nhypothesis of these binary systems.

Caused by air temperature gradients at the level\nof the telescope spiders, these aberrations were recently diagnosed with\nsuccess on VLT/SPHERE, but so far no complete calibration has been performed to\novercome this issue. We propose closed-loop focal plane wavefront control based\non the asymmetric Fourier pupil wavefront sensor (APF-WFS) to calibrate these\naberrations and improve the image quality of exoplanet high-contrast\ninstruments in the presence of the IE. Assuming the archetypal four-quadrant\naperture geometry in 8m class telescopes, we describe these aberrations as a\nsum of the independent modes of piston, tip, and tilt that are distributed in\neach quadrant of the telescope pupil. We calibrate these modes with the APF-WFS\nbefore introducing our wavefront control for closed-loop operation. We perform\nnumerical simulations and then experimental tests on a real system using\nSubaru/SCExAO to validate our control loop in the laboratory and on-sky.\nClosed-loop operation with the APF-WFS enables the compensation for the IE in\nsimulations and in the laboratory for the small aberration regime.

Efficient radial transport of icy\ndust grains could significantly alter the composition of the gas in the inner\ndisk. Our aim is to model the gaseous CO$_2$ abundance in the inner disk and\nuse this to probe the efficiency of icy dust transport in a viscous disk.\nFeatures in the simulated CO$_2$ spectra are investigated for their dust flux\ntracing potential. We have developed a 1D viscous disk model that includes gas\nand grain motions as well as dust growth, sublimation and freeze-out and a\nparametrisation of the CO$_2$ chemistry. The thermo-chemical code DALI was used\nto model the mid-infrared spectrum of CO$_2$, as can be observed with\nJWST-MIRI. CO$_2$ ice sublimating at the iceline increases the gaseous CO$_2$\nabundance to levels equal to the CO$_2$ ice abundance of $\\sim 10^{-5}$, which\nis three orders of magnitude more than the gaseous CO$_2$ abundances of $\\sim\n10^{-8}$ observed by Spitzer. Grain growth and radial drift further increase\nthe gaseous CO$_2$ abundance. A CO$_2$ destruction rate of at least $10^{-11}$\ns$^{-1}$ is needed to reconcile model prediction with observations. This rate\nis at least two orders of magnitude higher than the fastest known chemical\ndestruction rate. A range of potential physical mechanisms to explain the low\nobserved CO$_2$ abundances are discussed. Transport processes in disks can have\nprofound effects on the abundances of species in the inner disk. The\ndiscrepancy between our model and observations either suggests frequent shocks\nin the inner 10 AU that destroy CO$_2$, or that the abundant midplane CO$_2$ is\nhidden from our view by an optically thick column of low abundance CO$_2$ in to\nthe disk surface XDR/PDR.

{"id": "1801.01474", "contents": "Title: Galactic Effects on Habitability Abstract: The galactic environment has been suspected to influence planetary\nhabitability in many ways. Very metal-poor regions of the Galaxy, or those\nlargely devoid of atoms more massive than H and He, are thought to be unable to\nform habitable planets. Moreover, if such planets do form, the young system is\nsubjected to close stellar passages while it resides in its stellar birth\ncluster. Various potential hazards remain after clusters disperse. For\ninstance, central galactic regions may present risks to habitability via nearby\nsupernovae, gamma ray bursts (GRBs), and frequent comet showers. In addition,\nplanets residing within very wide binary star systems are affected by the\nGalaxy, as local gravitational perturbations from the Galaxy can increase the\nbinary's eccentricity until it destabilizes the planets it hosts. Here we\nreview the most recent work on the main galactic influences over planetary\nhabitability. Although there must be some metallicity limit below which rocky\nplanets cannot form, recent exoplanet surveys show that they form around stars\nwith a very large range of metallicities. Once formed, the probability of star\nclusters destabilizing planetary systems only becomes high for rare, extremely\nlong-lived clusters. Regarding threats to habitability from supernovae, GRBs,\nand comet showers, many recent studies suggest that their hazards are more\nlimited than originally thought. Finally, denser regions of the Galaxy enhance\nthe threat that very wide binary companions pose to planetary habitability, but\nthe probability that a very wide binary star disrupts habitability will always\nbe substantially below 100% for any environment. While some Milky Way regions\nmust be more hospitable to habitable planets than others, it is difficult to\nstate that habitable planets are confined to any well-defined region of the\nGalaxy or that any other particular region of the Galaxy is uninhabitable. \n\n"}

Recent models\nhave questioned the similar evolutionary trend expected for the two\nfractionation mechanisms in N$_2$H$^+$, based on a classical scenario in which\nion-neutral reactions occurring in cold gas should have caused an enhancement\nof the abundance of N$_2$D$^+$, $^{15}$NNH$^+$, and N$^{15}$NH$^+$.

One of the observable\ntests for migration theories is the current value of the angle between the\nstellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane, called the obliquity. After the\nmain migration mechanism has ended, the obliquity and the semi-major axis keep\non evolving due to the combined effects of tides and magnetic braking. The\nobserved correlation between effective temperature and measured projected\nobliquity in known short-period systems has been taken as evidence of such\nmechanisms being at play. Our aim is to produce an improved model for the tidal\nevolution of the obliquity, including all the components of the dynamical tide\nfor circular misaligned systems. This model takes into account the strong\nvariations in structure and rotation of stars during their evolution, and their\nconsequences for the efficiency of tidal dissipation. We use an analytical\nformulation for the frequency-averaged dissipation in convective layers for\neach mode, depending only on global stellar parameters and rotation. For\ntypical hot-Jupiters orbital configurations, the obliquity is generally damped\non a much shorter timescale than the semi-major axis. The final outcome of\ntidal evolution is also very sensitive to the initial conditions, with\nJupiter-mass planets being either quickly destroyed or brought on more distant\norbit, depending on the initial ratio of planetary orbital momentum to stellar\nspin momentum. However we find that everything else being the same, the\nevolution of the obliquity around low-mass stars with a thin convective zone is\nnot slower than around those with a thicker convective zone. On the contrary,\nwe find that more massive stars, remaining faster rotator throughout their\nmain-sequence, produce more efficient dissipation. \n\n"}

We study how Jupiter-mass\nplanet-seeds (termed protoplanets) evolve in massive, but gravitationally\nstable (Q>1.5), discs using radiative hydrodynamic simulations. We find that\nthe protoplanet initially migrates inwards rapidly, until it opens up a gap in\nthe disc. Thereafter, it either continues to migrate inwards on a much longer\ntimescale or starts migrating outwards. Outward migration occurs when the\nprotoplanet resides within a gap with gravitationally unstable edges, as a high\nfraction of the accreted gas is high angular momentum gas from outside the\nprotoplanet's orbit. The effect of radiative heating from the protoplanet is\ncritical in determining the direction of the migration and the eccentricity of\nthe protoplanet. Gap opening is facilitated by efficient cooling that may not\nbe captured by the commonly used beta-cooling approximation. The protoplanet\ninitially accretes at a high rate (1e-3Mj/yr), and its accretion luminosity\ncould be a few tenths of the host star's luminosity, making the protoplanet\neasily observable (albeit only for a short time). Due to the high gas accretion\nrate, the protoplanet generally grows above the deuterium-burning mass-limit.\nProtoplanet radiative feedback reduces its mass growth so that its final mass\nis near the brown dwarf-planet boundary. The fate of a young planet-seed is\ndiverse and could vary from a gas giant planet on a circular orbit at a few AU\nfrom the central star to a brown dwarf on an eccentric, wide orbit. \n\n"}

We present theoretical and numerical studies on the outcome of\ncapture into first-order mean motion resonances (MMRs) using a parametrized\nplanet migration model that takes into account nonlinear eccentricity damping\ndue to planet-disk interaction. This parametrization is based on numerical\nhydrodynamical simulations and is more realistic than the simple linear\nparametrization widely used in previous analytic studies.

For the latter, the determination of the\ncharge radius involves an extrapolation of the experimental form factor to zero\nmomentum transfer.\n  Purpose: To estimate the proton radius by introducing a novel non-parametric\napproach to model the electric form factor of the proton.\n  Methods: Within a Bayesian paradigm, we develop a model flexible enough to\nfit the data without any parametric assumptions on the form factor. The\nBayesian estimation is guided by imposing only two physical constraints on the\nform factor: (a) its value at zero momentum transfer (normalization) and (b)\nits overall shape, assumed to be a monotonically decreasing function of the\nmomentum transfer. Variants of these assumptions are explored to assess the\nimpact of these constraints.\n  Results: So far our results are inconclusive in regard to the proton puzzle,\nas they depend on both, the assumed constrains and the range of experimental\ndata used. For example, if only low momentum-transfer data is used, adopting\nonly the normalization constraint provides a value compatible with the smaller\nmuonic result, while imposing only the shape constraint favors the larger\nelectronic value.\n  Conclusions: We have presented a novel technique to estimate the proton\nradius from electron scattering data based on a non-parametric Gaussian\nprocess.

I.\n  Validation of the method and application to mitigate stellar activity Abstract: Stellar activity is the main limitation to the detection of Earth-twins using\nthe RV technique. Despite many efforts in trying to mitigate the effect of\nstellar activity using empirical and statistical techniques, it seems that we\nare facing an obstacle that will be extremely difficult to overcome using\ncurrent techniques. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to derive\nprecise RVs considering the wealth of information present in high-resolution\nspectra. This new method consists in building a master spectrum from all\nobservations and measure the RVs of each spectral line in a spectrum relative\nto it. When analysing several spectra, the final product is the RVs of each\nline as a function of time. We demonstrate on three stars intensively observed\nwith HARPS that our new method gives RVs that are extremely similar to the ones\nderived from the HARPS data reduction software. Our new approach to derive RVs\ndemonstrates that the non-stability of daily HARPS wavelength solution induces\nnight-to-night RV offsets with an standard deviation of 0.4 m/s, and we propose\na solution to correct for this systematic. Finally, and this is probably the\nmost astrophysically relevant result of this paper, we demonstrate that some\nspectral lines are strongly affected by stellar activity while others are not.\nBy measuring the RVs on two carefully selected subsample of spectral lines, we\ndemonstrate that we can boost by a factor of 2 or mitigate by a factor of 1.6\nthe red noise induced by stellar activity in the 2010 RVs of Alpha Cen B. By\nmeasuring the RVs of each spectral line, we are able to reach the same RV\nprecision as other approved techniques. In addition, this new approach allows\nto demonstrate that each line is differently affected by stellar activity.\nPreliminary results show that studying in details the behaviour of each\nspectral line is probably the key to overcome stellar activity. \n\n"}

Observations by CoRoT and Kepler have\nshown that the mode amplitudes increase dramatically as the stars ascend the\nred giant branch, i.e., as the frequency of maximum power, $\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$,\ndecreases. Most studies nonetheless assume that the modes are well described by\nthe linearized fluid equations. We investigate to what extent the linear\napproximation is justified as a function of stellar mass $M$ and\n$\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$, focusing on dipole mixed modes with frequency near\n$\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$. A useful measure of a mode's nonlinearity is the product of\nits radial wavenumber and its radial displacement, $k_r \\xi_r$ (i.e., its\nshear). We show that $k_r \\xi_r \\propto \\nu_\\mathrm{max}^{-9/2}$, implying that\nthe nonlinearity of mixed modes increases significantly as a star evolves. The\nmodes are weakly nonlinear ($k_r \\xi_r > 10^{-3}$) for $\\nu_\\mathrm{max}\n\\lesssim 150 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{Hz}$ and strongly nonlinear ($k_r \\xi_r > 1$) for\n$\\nu_\\mathrm{max} \\lesssim 30 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{Hz}$, with only a mild dependence\non $M$ over the range we consider ($1.0 - 2.0 M_\\odot$). A weakly nonlinear\nmixed mode can excite secondary waves in the stellar core through the\nparametric instability, resulting in enhanced, but partial, damping of the\nmode. By contrast, a strongly nonlinear mode breaks as it propagates through\nthe core and is fully damped there. Evaluating the impact of nonlinear effects\non observables such as mode amplitudes and linewidths requires large mode\nnetwork simulations. We plan to carry out such calculations in the future and\ninvestigate whether nonlinear damping can explain why some red giants exhibit\ndipole modes with unusually small amplitudes, known as depressed modes. \n\n"}

The outburst strongly\naffects the entire disk, changing its thermal structure and radiation field.

Our main goal is to identify\ngas-phase molecular tracers of the outburst activity that could be observed\nafter the outburst with modern telescopes such as ALMA and NOEMA. We find that\nthe majority of molecules experience a considerable increase in the total disk\ngas-phase abundances due to the outburst, mainly due to the sublimation of\ntheir ices. Their return to the pre-outburst chemical state takes different\namounts of time, from nearly instantaneous to very long. Among the former ones\nwe identify CO, NH$_3$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_3$H$_4$, etc. Their abundance evolution\ntightly follows the luminosity curve.

Of particular importance in the previous\nanalysis was the finding that the length of the coronal HXR source increased\nwith energy in the 20 - 30 keV range. However, after allowing for the\npossibility that footpoint emission at the higher energies affects the inferred\nlength of the coronal HXR source, and using analysis techniques that suppress\nthe possible influence of such footpoint emission, we conclude that there is no\nlonger evidence that the length of the HXR coronal sources increase with\nincreasing energy.

Despite initial understandings of\natmospheric dynamics which is the major cause of the variability by previous\nstudies, the detailed mechanism of variability remains elusive, and we need to\nseek a natural, self-consistent mechanism.

We seek to characterize the CN emission from 94 Class II disks in the\nLupus star forming region, compare it to observations in other regions, and\ninterpret our observations with a grid of models.

Models constructed with the physico-chemical code DALI are\nused to study the integrated fluxes of the disks and resolved emission of CN in\ndisks without (dust) substructures. We find that CN N=3-2 is bright, and\ndetected in 38% of sources, but its disk-integrated flux is not strongly\ncorrelated to either $^{13}$CO or continuum flux.

These data contain\nvaluable information for the dual purposes of planet detection via the measured\nRVs and stellar characterization via the co-added spectra.

In both of these examples,\nprecision-limiting reliance on external information can be sidestepped using\nthe data directly. Here we propose a data-driven method to simultaneously\nextract precise RVs and infer the underlying stellar and telluric spectra using\na linear model (in the log of flux).

We present the\nfirst CO detection in a planetesimal belt around an M star, TWA 7. The\noptically thin CO (J=3-2) emission is co-located with previously identified\ndust emission from the belt, and the emission velocity structure is consistent\nwith Keplerian rotation around the central star. The detected CO is not well\nshielded against photodissociation, and must thus be continuously replenished\nby gas release from exocomets within the belt.

Taking these differences into account,\nwe find that CO generation through exocometary gas release naturally explains\nthe increasing CO detection rates with stellar luminosity, mostly because the\nCO production rate from the collisional cascade is directly proportional to\nstellar luminosity. More luminous stars will therefore on average host more\nmassive (and hence more easily detectable) exocometary CO disks, leading to the\nhigher detection rates observed.

On the other hand, while\nmeshless methods have been widely used in both cosmology, galactic dynamics,\nand planet formation they have not been fully deployed on the MRI problem. We\npresent local unstratified and vertically stratified MRI simulations with two\nmeshless MHD schemes: a recent implementation of SPH MHD (Price2012), and a MFM\nMHD scheme with a constrained gradient divergence cleaning scheme, as\nimplemented in the GIZMO code \\citep{Hopkins2017}. Concerning variants of the\nSPH hydro force formulation we consider both the \"vanilla\" SPH and the PSPH\nvariant included in GIZMO. We find, as expected, that the numerical noise\ninherent in these schemes affects turbulence significantly. A high order\nkernel, free of the pairing instability, is necessary. Both schemes can\nadequately simulate MRI turbulence in unstratified shearing boxes with net\nvertical flux. The turbulence, however, dies out in zero-net-flux unstratified\nboxes, probably due to excessive and numerical dissipation. In zero-net-flux\nvertically stratified simulations, MFM can reproduce the MRI dynamo and its\ncharacteristic butterfly diagram for several tens of orbits before ultimately\ndecaying.

We point out that during such\nfinite QGP lifetime the spectrum of emitted photons carries information on the\ninitial state. There is an inherent ambiguity in separating the virtual from\nthe observable photons during the transient evolution of the QGP. We propose a\nreal time formulation to extract the photon yield which includes the initial\nstage of formation of the QGP parametrized by an effective time scale of\nformation $\\Gamma^{-1}$.
