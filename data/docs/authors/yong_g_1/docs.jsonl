The model in\nits infinite-size limit exhibits shape-phase transitions between spherical,\ndeformed prolate, and deformed oblate forms of the ground state. Finite-size\nprecursors of such behavior are verified by robust variations of nuclear\nproperties (nuclear masses, excitation energies, transition probabilities for\nlow lying levels) across the chart of nuclides. Simultaneously, the model\nserves as a theoretical laboratory for studying diverse general features of\nQPTs in interacting many-body systems, which differ in many respects from\nlattice models of solid-state physics. We outline the most important fields of\nthe present interest: (a) The coexistence of first- and second-order phase\ntransitions supports studies related to the microscopic origin of the QPT\nphenomena. (b) The competing quantum phases are characterized by specific\ndynamical symmetries and novel symmetry related approaches are developed to\ndescribe also the transitional dynamical domains. (c) In some parameter\nregions, the QPT-like behavior can be ascribed also to individual excited\nstates, which is linked to the thermodynamic and classical descriptions of the\nsystem. (d) The model and its phase structure can be extended in many\ndirections: by separating proton and neutron excitations, considering\nodd-fermion degrees of freedom or different particle-hole configurations, by\nincluding other types of bosons, higher order interactions, and by imposing\nexternal rotation. All these aspects of IBM phase transitions are relevant in\nthe interpretation of experimental data and important for a fundamental\nunderstanding of the QPT phenomenon. \n\n"}

We fitted the extracted probabilities as a function of nuclear\ndensity and asymmetry and used the fit to estimate the fractions of the\noff-Fermi shell nucleons in the superdense nuclear matter relevant to neutron\nstars. Our results indicate that starting at three nuclear saturation densities\nthe protons with fractional densities 1/9 will populate mostly the high\nmomentum tail of the momentum distribution while only 2% of the neutrons will\ndo so. We discuss the implications of this condition for neutron stars and\nemphasize that it may be characteristic to any asymmetric two component Fermi\nsystem with suppressed central and enhanced short-range tensor interactions\nbetween the two components. \n\n"}

Through these processes, this work\nexplored the constituent structure of baryons and the mechanisms through which\nthe interactions between these constituents ultimately control the selected\nreactions. First, hard nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering was studied\nconsidering the quark exchange (QE) between the nucleons to be the dominant\nmechanism of interaction in the constituent picture. It was found that an\nangular asymmetry exhibited by proton-neutron (pn) elastic scattering data is\nexplained within this framework if a quark-diquark picture dominates the\nnucleon's structure instead of a more traditional SU(6) model. The latter\nyields an asymmetry around 90 deg center of mass scattering with a sign\nopposite to what is experimentally observed. The second process is the hard\nbreakup by a photon of a nucleon-nucleon system in light nuclei. Proton-proton\n(pp) and pn breakup in 3He, and double Delta-isobars production in deuteron\nbreakup were analyzed in the hard rescattering model (HRM), which in\nconjunction with the QE mechanism provides a QCD description of the reaction.\nCross sections for both channels in 3He photodisintegration were computed\nwithout the need of a fitting parameter. The results presented here for pp\nbreakup show excellent agreement with recent experimental data. In double\nDelta-isobars production in deuteron breakup, HRM angular distributions for the\ntwo double Delta channels were compared to the pn channel and to each other. An\nimportant prediction from this study is that the Delta++ Delta- channel\nconsistently dominates Delta+Delta0, which is in contrast with models that\nunlike the HRM consider a double Delta system in the initial state of the\ninteraction. For such models both channels should have the same strength. \n\n"}

We find that this effect is enough to spoil quark number scaling\nin elliptic flow. A lack of scaling in data therefore does not signal the\nabsence of partonic degrees of freedom and hadronization by coalescence. In a\ncoalescing partonic fluid, however, elliptic flow of anti-baryons should be the\ngreater than that of baryons, since antibaryons contain a greater admixture of\npartons from the highly flowing midrapidity region.

We establish a simple\nprescription for preparing equivalent RMF and SHF parametrizations starting\nfrom a minimal set of empirical constraints on symmetric nuclear matter,\nnuclear binding energy and charge radii, enforcing equivalence of their Lorenz\neffective masses, and then using the pure neutron matter (PNM) equation of\nstate (EoS) obtained from ab-initio calculations to optimize the pure isovector\nparameters in the RMF and SHF models. We find the resulting RMF and SHF\nparametrizations give broadly consistent predictions of the symmetry energy J\nand its slope parameter L at saturation density within a tight range of <~2 MeV\nand <~6 MeV respectively, but that clear model dependence shows up in the\npredictions of higher-order symmetry energy parameters, leading to important\ndifferences in (a) the slope of the correlation between J and L from the\nconfidence ellipse, (b) the isospin-dependent part of the incompressibility of\nnuclear matter K_tau, (c) the symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities,\nand (d) the predicted neutron star radii. The model dependence can lead to\nabout 1-2 km difference in predictions of the neutron star radius given\nidentical predicted values of J, L and symmetric nuclear matter (SNM)\nsaturation properties.

Since the\nstudy is mainly on the hadronization of partons at late time, the fluid picture\nis not used to trace the evolution of the system. The inclusive distributions\nat low $p_T$ are determined as the recombination products of thermal partons.\nThe $p_T$ dependencies of both pion and proton have a common exponential factor\napart from other dissimilar kinematic and resonance factors, because they are\ninherited from the same pool of thermal partons. Instead of the usual\ndescription based on hydrodynamics, the azimuthal anisotropy of the produced\nhadrons is explained as the consequence of the effects of minijets, either\nindirectly through the recombination of enhanced thermal partons in the\nvicinity of the trajectories of the semihard partons, or directly through\nthermal-shower recombination. Although our investigation is focussed on the\nsingle-particle distribution at midrapidity, we give reasons why a component in\nthat distribution can be identified with the ridge, which together with the\nsecond harmonic $v_2$ is due to the semihard partons created near the medium\nsurface that lead to calculable anisotropy in $\\phi$.

Traditionally, they are included in a\nmean-field description of atomic nuclei through the approximate\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer or Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov formalism. Purpose: We\npropose a new hybrid ''relativistic-mean-field-plus-pairing'' approach in which\npairing is treated exactly so the number of particles is conserved. To verify\nthe reliability of the formalism, we apply it to the study of both ground-state\nproperties and isoscalar monopole excitations of the Tin isotopes. Methods:\nAccurately-calibrated relativistic mean-field models supplemented by an exact\ntreatment of pairing correlations are used to compute ground-state observables\nalong the isotopic chain in Tin. In turn, ground-state densities are used as\ninput to the calculation of giant monopole resonances through a\nconstrained-relativistic approach. Results: We compute a variety of\nground-state observables sensitive to pairing correlations as well as the\nevolution of giant monopole energies along the isotopic chain in Tin. Whereas\nground-state properties are consistent with experiment, we find that pairing\ncorrelations have a minor effect on the giant monopole energies. Conclusions: A\nnew mean-field-plus-pairing approach is introduced to compute properties of\nopen-shell nuclei. The formalism provides an efficient and powerful alternative\nto the computation of both ground-state properties and monopole energies of\nopen-shell nuclei.

While the total nuclear symmetry energy at nuclear saturation\ndensity (\\rho_0) is relatively well determined, its value at supranuclear\ndensities is not. The latter can be better constrained by separately examining\nits kinetic and potential terms and their density dependencies. The kinetic\nterm of the symmetry energy, E_sym^kin(\\rho_0), equals the difference in the\nper-nucleon kinetic energy between pure neutron matter (PNM) and symmetric\nnuclear matter (SNM), often calculated using a simple Fermi gas model. However,\nexperiments show that tensor force induced short-range correlations (SRC)\nbetween proton-neutron pairs shift nucleons to high-momentum in SNM, but have\nalmost no effect in PNM. We present an approximate analytical expression for\nE_sym^kin(\\rho) of correlated nucleonic matter. In our model, E_sym^kin(\\rho_0)\n= -10 MeV, which differs significantly from +12.5 MeV for the widely-used free\nFermi gas model. This result is consistent with our analysis of recent data on\nthe free proton-to-neutron ratios measured in intermediate energy\nnucleus-nucleus collisions as well as with microscopic many-body calculations,\nand previous phenomenological extractions. We then use our calculated\nE_sym^kin(\\rho) in combination with the known total symmetry energy and its\ndensity dependence at saturation density to constrain the value and density\ndependence of the potential part and to extrapolate the total symmetry energy\nto supranuclear densities. \n\n"}

Purpose: A relativistic energy density functional\n(EDF) is developed to address the complexity of such diverse nuclear systems.\nMoreover, a statistical perspective is adopted to describe the information\ncontent of various physical observables. Methods: We implement the model\noptimization by minimizing a suitably constructed chi-square objective function\nusing various properties of finite nuclei and neutron stars. The minimization\nis then supplemented by a covariance analysis that includes both uncertainty\nestimates and correlation coefficients. Results: A new model, FSUGold2, is\ncreated that can well reproduce the ground-state properties of finite nuclei,\ntheir monopole response, and that accounts for the maximum neutron star mass\nobserved up to date.

On the other hand, model approximations\npredict that when a vector repulsion, parametrized by $G_V$, is present this\ncoefficient reaches a maximum just after $T_c$ and then deviates from the\nlattice predictions. Recently, this discrepancy has been used as a guide to\nconstrain the (presently unknown) value of $G_V$ within the framework of\neffective models at large-$N_c$ (LN). In the present investigation we show\nthat, due to finite $N_c$ effects, $c_2$ may also develop a maximum even when\n$G_V=0$ since a vector repulsive term can be dynamically generated by exchange\ntype of radiative corrections.

For a proper interpretation of\nthe data, final-state interactions (FSI) need to be theoretically controlled.\n  Purpose: Our goal is to quantify the role of FSI effects in exclusive\n$A(e,e'pN)$ reactions for four target nuclei representative for the whole mass\nregion. Our focus is on processes that are SRC driven. We investigate the role\nof FSI for two characteristic detector setups corresponding with a \"small\" and\n\"large\" coverage of the available phase space.\n  Results: The transparency $T^{pN}_{A}$, defined as the ratio of exclusive\n$(e,e'pN)$ cross sections on nuclei to those on \"free\" nucleon pairs, drops\nfrom $ 0.2-0.3 $ for $^{12}$C to $0.04-0.07$ for $^{208}$Pb.

Theoretical Framework Abstract: We develop a theoretical approach for nuclear spectral functions at high\nmissing momenta and removal energies based on the multi-nucleon short-range\ncorrelation~(SRC) model. The approach is based on the effective Feynman\ndiagrammatic method which allows to account for the relativistic effects\nimportant in the SRC domain. In addition to two-nucleon SRC with center of mass\nmotion we derive also the contribution of three-nucleon SRCs to the nuclear\nspectral functions. The latter is modeled based on the assumption that 3N SRCs\nare a product of two sequential short range NN interactions. This approach\nallowed us to express the 3N SRC part of the nuclear spectral function as a\nconvolution of two NN SRCs. Thus the knowledge of 2N SRCs allows us to model\nboth two- and three-nucleon SRC contributions to the spectral function. The\nderivations of the spectral functions are based on the two theoretical\nframeworks in evaluating covariant Feynman diagrams: In the first, referred as\nvirtual nucleon approximation, we reduce Feynman diagrams to the time ordered\nnoncovariant diagrams by evaluating nucleon spectators in the SRC at their\npositive energy poles, neglecting explicitly the contribution from vacuum\ndiagrams.

In this\npresentation for the IUPAP Young Scientist Prize 2016, I would like to\nintroduce the microscopic studies on nuclear spin-isospin properties in the\nframework of covariant density functional theory (DFT), by taking a few works\nthat I have been joining in as examples.

As a result of the short-range\ncorrelations, the single-nucleon momentum distribution develops a high-momentum\ntail above the Fermi surface. Because of the strongly isospin-dependent\nshort-range correlations, in neutron-rich matter a higher fraction of protons\nwill be depleted from its Fermi sea and populate above the Fermi surface\ncompared to neutrons. This isospin-dependent nucleon momentum distribution may\nhave effects on: (1) nucleon spectroscopic factors of rare isotopes, (2) the\nequation of state especially the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy,\n(3) the coexistence of a proton-skin in momentum space and a neutron-skin in\ncoordinate space (i.e., protons move much faster than neutrons near the surface\nof heavy nuclei).

Liquid argon time\nprojection chambers (LArTPCs) possess various advantages in measuring\nelectroweak neutrino-nucleus cross sections. Concurrent theoretical research is\nan evident necessity.

However, it cannot be trusted at low energies, e.g. well below\n$\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}} \\approx 50$ GeV for central Au+Au collisions, when\n$\\tau_0$ is smaller than the finite time it takes for the two nuclei to cross\neach other. Here I extend the Bjorken formula by including the finite time\nduration of the initial energy production. Analytical solutions for the formed\nenergy density in the central spacetime-rapidity region are derived for several\ntime profiles. Compared to the Bjorken formula at low energies, the maximum\nenergy density reached is much lower, increases much faster with the collision\nenergy, and is much less sensitive to the uncertainty of the formation time,\nwhile the energy density time evolution is much longer. Comparisons with\nresults from a multi-phase transport confirm the key features of these\nsolutions. The effect of the finite longitudinal width of the initial energy\nproduction, which is neglected in the analytical results, is investigated with\nthe transport model and shown to be small.

For the dominant transition to the\n$^{124}$Te ground state, we find half-lives $T^{2\\nu{\\rm\nECEC}}_{1/2}=(1.3-18)\\times 10^{22}$ y for the ET and $T^{2\\nu{\\rm ECEC}}_{1/2}\n= (0.43-2.9)\\times 10^{22}$ y for the shell model.

A model defect is usually a\nfunction of energy and describes the difference between the model prediction\nand the truth. Of course, neither the truth nor the model defect are\naccessible. A Gaussian process (GP) enables to define a probability\ndistribution on possible shapes of a model defect by referring to intuitively\nunderstandable concepts such as smoothness and the expected magnitude of the\ndefect. Standard specifications of GPs impose a typical length-scale and\namplitude valid for the whole energy range, which is often not justified, e.g.,\nwhen the model covers both the resonance and statistical range.

We study the sensitivity of this\nconclusion to different hydrodynamic assumptions on chemical and thermal\nfreezeout after the sQGP hadronizes. We show that if chemical freezeout occurs\nat the hadronization time, the differential elliptic flow for pions increase\nwith proper time in the late hadronic phase until thermal freezeout and leads\nto a discrepancy with the data. In contrast, if both chemical and thermal\nequilibrium are maintained past the hadronization, then the mean pT per pion\nincreases in a way that accidentally preserves v2(pT) from the sQGP phase in\nagreement with the data, but at the cost of the agreement with the hadronic\nyields. In order that all the data on hadronic ratios, radial flow, and\ndifferential elliptic flow be reproduced, the sQGP must expand with a minimal\nviscosity, \\eta_Q, that is however even greater than the viscosity, \\eta_H, of\nits hadronic corona.

The Lanczos procedure\ndetermines the nuclear response along a line q=0 in the (omega,q) plane, where\nomega and q are the energy and three-momentum transfered to the nucleus.\nHowever, generalizing such treatments from the allowed limit to general\nelectroweak response functions at arbitrary momentum transfers seems\nconsiderably more difficult: the response function must be determined over the\nentire (omega,q) plane for an operator O(q) that is not fixed, but depends\nexplicitly on q.

Second,\nearlier nonrelativistic calculations suggest an almost complete insensitivity\nof polarization observables to distortions effects.
