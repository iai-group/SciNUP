The aim is to gain a\nthorough understanding of the interplay between electrical conduction and\nmagnetism in atomic-size conductors and how it is affected by different aspects\nas e.g. the atomic structure and the chemical composition of the conductor. To\nthis end our ab initio quantum transport program ALACANT which combines the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF) with density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations has been extended to describe spin-polarized systems.\nWe present calculations on nanocontacts made of Ni as a prototypical magnetic\nmaterial. We find that atomic disorder in the contact region strongly reduces\nthe a priori high spin-polarization of the conductance leading to rather\nmoderate values of the so-called ballistic magnetoresistance (BMR). On the\nother hand, we show that the adsorption of oxygen in the contact region could\nstrongly enhance the spin-polarization of the conduction electrons and thus BMR\nby eliminating the spin-unpolarized s-channel. Finally, we show that short\natomic Pt chains suspended between the tips of a nanocontact are magnetic in\ncontrast to bulk Pt. However, this emergent nanoscale magnetism barely affects\nthe overall conductance of the nanocontact making it thus difficult to\ndemonstrate by simple conductance measurements.

However, little is known regarding the details\nof this process, its time scale, and whether molecules with and without thiol\nhydrogen atoms can coexist in molecular junctions. Here we explore\ntheoretically how inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) can shed light on\nthese issues. We present calculations of the geometries, low bias conductances\nand IETS of propanedithiol and propanedithiolate molecular junctions with gold\nelectrodes. We show that IETS can distinguish between junctions with molecules\nhaving no, one or two thiol hydrogen atoms.

Contrary to\nprevious studies, we consider varying length of the chain with fixed number of\nparticles. Number of possible energetically degenerate ground states strongly\ndepends on the overall length of the chain, or, in other terms, on average\nlength of the link between neighboring particles.

But the formalism he developed has found many uses\nas there are now a number of candidate spin-1/2 neutral particles that may be\ntruly neutral with no quantum number to distinguish them from their\nanti-particles. If such particles exist, they will influence many areas of\nnuclear and particle physics. Most notably the process of neutrinoless double\nbeta decay can only exist if neutrinos are massive Majorana particles. Hence,\nmany efforts to search for this process are underway. Majorana's influence\ndoesn't stop with particle physics, however, even though that was his original\nconsideration. The equations he derived also arise in solid state physics where\nthey describe electronic states in materials with superconducting order. Of\nspecial interest here is the class of solutions of the Majorana equation in one\nand two spatial dimensions at exactly zero energy. These Majorana zero modes\nare endowed with some remarkable physical properties that may lead to advances\nin quantum computing and, in fact, there is evidence that they have been\nexperimentally observed. This review first summarizes the basics of Majorana's\ntheory and its implications. It then provides an overview of the rich\nexperimental programs trying to find a fermion that is its own anti-particle in\nnuclear, particle, and solid state physics. \n\n"}

A drift-diffusion treatment of the\nanomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic magnetoresistance describes the spin\ncurrents that flow in directions perpendicular to the electric field. In\nsystems with two ferromagnetic layers separated by a spacer layer, an in-plane\nelectric field cause spin currents to be injected from one layer into the\nother, creating spin transfer torques.

In single wires the ballistic and diffusive regimes can be\ndistinguished by varying $E_F$ and studying the sign of the AB signal, which\ndepends periodically on $E_F$ in ballistic wires and randomly on $E_F$ in\ndiffusive wires.

In the\nHartree-Fock approximation, at small $U$ we obtain a surface ferromagnetic\nphase through a continuous quantum phase transition characterized by the\nsurface-mode divergence of the spin susceptibility, while the bulk states\nremain very robust against local interactions and remain non-ordered. At\nslightly increased interaction strength, the system quickly changes from a\nsurface ferromagnetic phase to a surface charge-ordered phase through a\nfirst-order transition. When Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling is applied to the\nsurface states, a canted ferromagnetic phase occurs at the surface for\nintermediate values of $U$. The quantum critical behavior of the surface\nferromagnetic transition is nontrivial in the sense that the surface spin order\nparameter couple to Fermi-surface excitations from both surface and bulk\nstates.

Three different mechanisms: a combination of inversion\nand time-reversal symmetry, mirror reflection symmetry, and non-symmorphic\nsymmetry, and their robustness under the effect of spin orbit coupling are\ndiscussed. We also present a new Weyl nodal line material, the Te-square net\ncompound KCu$_2$EuTe$_4$, which has several Weyl nodal lines including one\nextremely close to the Fermi level ($<$30 meV below E$_F$). Finally, we discuss\npotential experimental signatures for observing exotic properties of nodal line\nphysics. \n\n"}

In magnets, the internal magnetization allows\nHall conductivity in the absence of external magnetic field. This anomalous\nHall effect (AHE) has become an important tool to study quantum magnets.

A convenient way to\nestablish the nature and onset of the charge transfer and the corresponding\nfeatures in the I-V is to draw an energy level diagram for each spin species.\nStarting from such a level diagram, we argue that transport in the Tour-Reed\nswitching molecules, which consist of a central phenyl ring with a nitroamine\nredox center, involves the oxidation of a highest occupied molecular orbital\n(HOMO)-based level. \n\n"}

Due to strong electronic\ncorrelations in the wire, the effects of impurity backscattering, finite bias,\nfinite temperature, and finite length lead to characteristic non-monotonic\nparameter dependencies of the average current. We discuss oscillations of the\nnon-linear current voltage characteristics that arise due to reflections of\nplasmon modes at the impurity and quasi Andreev reflections at the contacts,\nand show how these oscillations are washed out by decoherence at finite\ntemperature. Furthermore, the finite frequency current noise is investigated in\ndetail.

The basic challenge addressed\nin our work is to calculate the decoherence of electrons interacting with a\nquantum-mechanical environment, while taking proper account of the Pauli\nprinciple. First, we review the usual influence functional approach valid for\ndecoherence of electrons due to classical noise, showing along the way how the\nquantitative accuracy can be improved by properly averaging over closed (rather\nthan unrestricted) random walks. We then use a heuristic approach to show how\nthe Pauli principle may be incorporated into a path-integral description of\ndecoherence in weak localization. This is accomplished by introducing an\neffective modification of the quantum noise spectrum, after which the\ncalculation proceeds in analogy to the case of classical noise. Using this\nsimple but efficient method, which is consistent with much more laborious\ndiagrammatic calculations, we demonstrate how the Pauli principle serves to\nsuppress the decohering effects of quantum fluctuations of the environment, and\nessentially confirm the classic result of Altshuler, Aronov and Khmelnitskii\nfor the energy-averaged decoherence rate, which vanishes at zero temperature.\nGoing beyond that, we employ our method to calculate explicitly the leading\nquantum corrections to the classical decoherence rates, and to provide a\ndetailed analysis of the energy-dependence of the decoherence rate. The basic\nidea of our approach is general enough to be applicable to decoherence of\ndegenerate Fermi systems in contexts other than weak localization as well. --\nPaper II will provide a more rigorous diagrammatic basis for our results, by\nrederiving them from a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the Cooperon. \n\n"}

Second, how the bulk QHE is related with the edge QHE for the\nentire spectrum including Dirac and ordinary behaviors. We find the following:\n  (i) The zero-mass Dirac QHE persists up to the van Hove singularities, at\nwhich the ordinary fermion behavior abruptly takes over. Here a technique\ndeveloped in the lattice gauge theory enabled us to calculate the behavior of\nthe topological number over the entire spectrum. This result indicates a\nrobustness of the topological quantum number, and should be observable if the\nchemical potential can be varied over a wide range in graphene. (ii) To see if\nthe honeycomb lattice is singular in producing the anomalous QHE, we have\nsystematically surveyed over square-honeycomb-$\\pi$-flux lattices, which is\nscanned by introducing a diagonal transfer $t'$. We find that the massless\nDirac QHE forms a critical line, that is, the presence of Dirac cones in the\nBrillouin zone is preserved by the inclusion of $t'$ and the Dirac region sits\nside by side with ordinary one persists all through the transformation.

{"id": "quant-ph/9912100", "contents": "Title: Quantum Computing, NP-complete Problems and Chaotic Dynamics Abstract: An approach to the solution of NP-complete problems based on quantum\ncomputing and chaotic dynamics is proposed. We consider the satisfiability\nproblem and argue that the problem, in principle, can be solved in polynomial\ntime if we combine the quantum computer with the chaotic dynamics amplifier\nbased on the logistic map. We discuss a possible implementation of such a\nchaotic quantum computation by using the atomic quantum computer with quantum\ngates described by the Hartree-Fock equations. In this case, in principle, one\ncan build not only standard linear quantum gates but also nonlinear gates and\nmoreover they obey to Fermi statistics. This new type of entaglement related\nwith Fermi statistics can be interesting also for quantum communication theory. \n\n"}
