The effect of\nobserving a survey volume along the light-cone must be considered in the regime\nwhere the mass function of galaxies varies exponentially with redshift. This\noccurs when the halos under consideration are rare, that is either when they\nare very massive or observed at high-redshift.

This finding holds as long as the\nlifetime of inverse Compton emitting electrons exceeds the age of the system.\nFor a typical $\\gamma^{-2}$ electron spectrum, the predicted flux depends\nmostly on the pulsar birth period, conversion efficiency of spindown power to\nrelativistic electrons and distance to the PWN, so that first order estimates\nof the birth period can be assessed from {\\it GLAST/LAT} observations of PWN.\nFor this purpose we derive an analytical expression.

We discuss the possibility and theoretical aspects\nof using Lyman alpha emission properties of long GRB host galaxies as a\nmetallicity indicator of high redshift GRB environments, where direct\nmetallicity measurements are not easy. We propose to use the fraction of\nLy-alpha emitters (LAEs) in long GRB host galaxies as a function of UV\nluminosity, which can be compared with star-formation-rate weighted LAE\nfraction of Lyman-break galaxies as the standard in the case of no metallicity\ndependence. There are two important effects of metallicity dependence of long\nGRB rate to change the LAE fraction of host galaxies. One is the enhancement of\nintrinsic Ly-alpha equivalent width (EW) by stronger ionizing UV luminosity of\nlow metallicity stellar population, and the other is extinction by interstellar\ndust to change the observable EW. Based on a latest theoretical model of LAEs\nthat reproduce observations, we argue that the latter is likely to work in the\nopposite direction to the former, i.e., to decrease LAE fraction if GRBs\npreferentially occur in low-metallicity environments, because of the clumpy\ninter-stellar medium effect. The high LAE fraction of GRB host galaxies\nindicated by observations is quantitatively be explained by the LAE model if\nGRBs occur when Z < 0.1Z_sun, although this result is still indicative because\nof the limited statistics and theoretical uncertainties. This result\ndemonstrates that the LAE statistics of GRB hosts may give us useful\ninformation in the future. \n\n"}

Here we show that stellar rotation in stars with masses between\n1.2-1.7 Msun can mimic the effect of a double or multiple population, whereas\nin actuality only a single population exists. The two main causes of the spread\nnear the turn-off are the effects of stellar rotation on the structure of the\nstar and the inclination angle of the star relative to the observer.

The entropy profiles are robustly measured at least out to\nR_1000 in all systems and out to R_500 in 13 systems. Compared to theoretical\nexpectations, the observed distributions show a radial and mass-dependent\nexcess entropy that is greater and extends to larger radii in lower mass\nsystems. At R_500, the mass dependence and entropy excess are both negligible\nwithin the uncertainties. Mirroring this behaviour, the scaling of gas entropy\nis shallower than self-similar in the inner regions, but steepens with radius,\nbecoming consistent with self-similar at R_500. The dispersion in scaled\nentropy in the inner regions is linked to the presence of cool cores and\ndynamical activity; at larger radii the dispersion decreases by a factor of two\nand the dichotomy between subsamples disappears. Parameterising the profiles\nwith a power law plus constant model, there are two peaks in central entropy\nK_0; however, we cannot distinguish between a bimodal or a left-skewed\ndistribution.

We show analytically that\nthe dominant source of energy is often potential energy, released as gas in the\nouter disc attempts to circularize at smaller radii.

Normal galaxies with low star-formation rates become radio-faint at high z,\nbecause Inverse Compton (IC) losses off the CMB cool CR electrons and positrons\nrapidly, suppressing their nonthermal radio emission. However, we find that\nthis effect occurs at higher redshifts than previously expected, because\nescape, bremsstrahlung, ionization, and starlight IC losses act to counter this\neffect and preserve the radio luminosity of galaxies. The radio dimming of\nstar-forming galaxies at high z is not just a simple competition between\nmagnetic field energy density and the CMB energy density; the CMB must also\ncompete with every other loss process. We predict relations for the critical\nredshift when radio emission is significantly suppressed compared to the z ~ 0\nFRC as a function of star-formation rate per unit area. Additionally, we\nprovide a quantitative explanation for the relative radio brightness of some\nhigh-z submillimeter galaxies.

Most observed dwarf\ngalaxies consists of a rotating stellar disc embedded in a massive DM halo with\na near constant-density core. Yet, models based on the CDM scenario invariably\nform galaxies with dense spheroidal stellar \"bulges\" and steep central DM\nprofiles, as low angular momentum baryons and DM sink to the center of galaxies\nthrough accretion and repeated mergers. Processes that decrease the central\ndensity of CDM halos have been identified, but have not yet reconciled theory\nwith observations of present day dwarfs. This failure is potentially\ncatastrophic for the CDM model, possibly requiring a different DM particle\ncandidate. This Letter presents new hydrodynamical simulations in a Lambda$CDM\nframework where analogues of dwarf galaxies, bulgeless and with a shallow\ncentral DM profile, are formed. This is achieved by resolving the inhomogeneous\ninterstellar medium, resulting in strong outflows from supernovae explosions\nwhich remove low angular momentum gas. This inhibits the formation of bulges\nand decreases the dark-matter density to less than half within the central\nkiloparsec. Realistic dwarf galaxies are thus shown to be a natural outcome of\ngalaxy formation in the CDM scenario. \n\n"}

The La luminosity in our simulations is\npowered by the release of gravitational energy as gas flows from the\nintergalactic medium into the halo potential wells. The UV background\ncontributes only <20% to the gas heating. The La emissivity is due primarily to\nelectron-impact excitation cooling radiation in gas ~2x10^4K. We calculate the\nLa emissivities assuming collisional ionisation equilibrium (CIE) at all gas\ntemperatures. The simulated streams are self-shielded against the UV\nbackground, so photoionisation and recombination contribute negligibly to the\nLa line formation. We produce theoretical maps of the La surface brightnesses,\nassuming that ~85% of the La photons are directly observable. We find that\ntypical haloes of mass Mv~10^12-13 Msun at z~3 emit as La blobs (LABs) with\nluminosities 10^43-44 erg/s. Most of the La comes from the extended narrow,\npartly clumpy, inflowing, cold streams that feed the growing galaxies. The\npredicted LAB morphology is therefore irregular, with dense clumps and\nelongated extensions. The linewidth is expected to range from 10^2 to more than\n10^3 km/s with a large variance. The typical La surface brightness profile is\nproportional to r^-1.2 where r is the distance from the halo centre. Our\nsimulated LABs are similar in luminosity, morphology and extent to the observed\nLABs, with distinct kinematic features. The predicted La luminosity function is\nconsistent with observations, and the predicted areas and linewidths roughly\nrecover the observed scaling relations. This mechanism for producing LABs\nappears inevitable in many high-z galaxies.

This widely used approximation assumes that the mass\nfunction can be expressed as a function of the matter density omega_m and the\nrms linear density fluctuation sigma only, with no explicit dependence on the\nproperties of dark energy or redshift. In order to test this hypothesis we run\na series of 15 high-resolution N-body simulations for different cosmological\nmodels. These consists of three LCDM cosmologies best fitting WMAP-1, 3 and 5\nyears data, and three toy-models characterized by a Ratra-Peebles quintessence\npotential with different slopes and amounts of dark energy density. These toy\nmodels have very different evolutionary histories at the background and linear\nlevel, but share the same sigma8 value. For each of these models we measure the\nmass function from catalogues of halos identified in the simulations using the\nFriend-of-Friend (FoF) algorithm. We find redshift dependent deviations from a\nuniversal behaviour, well above numerical uncertainties and of non-stochastic\norigin, which are correlated with the linear growth factor of the investigated\ncosmologies. Using the spherical collapse as guidance, we show that such\ndeviations are caused by the cosmology dependence of the non-linear collapse\nand virialization process.

We show that under the\nassumption of exact redshift information the intrinsic-shear alignment\ncontamination can be completely eliminated. To show how well the nulling\ntechnique performs on data with limited redshift information, we apply the\nnulling technique to three-point weak lensing statistics from a fictitious\nsurvey analogous to a typical future deep imaging survey, in which the\nthree-point intrinsic-shear alignment systematics is generated from a power-law\ntoy model.

That is, at the loop level, matter\nsources curvature through a gravitational coupling that is a non-local function\nof the covariant d'Alembertian. If the functional form of the resulting\nNewton's `constant' is such that it annihilates very long wavelength sources,\nbut reduces to $1/M^2_{pl}$ ($M_{pl}$ being the 4d Planck mass) for all sources\nwith cosmologically observable wavelengths, we would have a complimentary\nrealization of the degravitation paradigm-- a realization through which its\nnon-linear completion and the corresponding modified Bianchi identities are\nreadily understood.

Supernova remnants (SNRs) provide a laboratory for studying the\nevolution of dust grains, as they are one of the only environments in the\nuniverse where it is possible to observe grains being both created and\ndestroyed.

MOND effects are\nabsent in an exactly symmetric universe, apart from the appearance of a\ncosmological constant, Lambda~(a0/c)^2. MOND effects-local and cosmological-do\nenter when density inhomogeneities that differ in the two sectors appear and\ndevelop. MOND later takes its standard form in systems that are islands\ndominated by pure matter. I derive the nonrelativistic equations governing\nsmall-scale fluctuation growth. The equations split into two uncoupled systems,\none for the sum, the other for the difference, of the fluctuations in the two\nsectors. The former is governed strictly by Newtonian dynamics. The latter is\ngoverned by MOND dynamics, which entails stronger gravity, and nonlinearity\neven for the smallest of perturbations. These cause the difference to grow\nfaster than the sum, conducing to matter-twin-matter segregation. The\nnonlinearity also causes interaction between nested perturbations on different\nscales. Because matter and twin matter (TM) repel each other in the MOND\nregime, matter inhomogeneities grow not only by their own self gravity, but\nalso through shepherding by flanking TM overdensitie.

The Role of Truncation in the\n  Two-Dimensional Family of Early-Type Galaxy Star Formation Histories Abstract: In the three-dimensional parameter space defined by velocity dispersion,\neffective radius (R_e), and effective surface brightness (I_e), early-type\ngalaxies are observed to populate a two-dimensional fundamental plane (FP) with\nfinite thickness. In Paper III of this series, we showed that the thickness of\nthe FP is predominantly due to variations in the stellar mass surface density\n(Sigma_*) inside the effective radius R_e. These variations represent\ndifferences in the dark matter fraction inside R_e (or possibly differences in\nthe initial mass function) from galaxy to galaxy. This means that galaxies do\nnot wind up below the FP at lower surface brightness due to the passive fading\nof their stellar populations; they are structurally different. Here, we show\nthat these variations in Sigma_* at fixed dynamical mass (M_dyn) are linked to\ndifferences in the galaxy stellar populations, and therefore to differences in\ntheir star formation histories. We demonstrate that the ensemble of stellar\npopulation and Sigma_* variations through the FP thickness can be explained by\na model in which early-type galaxies at fixed M_dyn have their star formation\ntruncated at different times. The thickness of the FP can therefore be\ninterpreted as a sequence of truncation times. Galaxies below the FP have\nearlier truncation times for a given M_dyn, resulting in lower Sigma_*, older\nages, lower metallicities in both [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], and higher [Mg/Fe].

The\nkey ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on\nrelatively short timescales, to a point where the radius is comparable to or\nlarger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a\nconfiguration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to\nsubstantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral\ngrazings in an eccentric system could quickly escalate to a catastrophic\nencounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the\nphotosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, as a result of the primary\nstar increasing its own radius. This is motivated by the case of $\\eta$\nCarinae, where such a collision must have occured if conventional estimates of\nthe present-day orbit are correct, and where brief peaks in the light curve\ncoincide with periastron. Stellar collisions may explain brief recurring LBV\noutbursts like SN 2000ch and SN 2009ip, and perhaps outbursts from relatively\nlow-mass progenitor stars (collisons are not necessarily the exclusive domain\nof very luminous stars).

Such possibility is severely restricted by the constraints on\nanomalous isotopes of light elements that form positively charged heavy species\nwith ordinary electrons. The trouble is avoided, if stable particles $X^{--}$\nwith charge -2 are in excess over their antiparticles (with charge +2) and\nthere are no stable particles with charges +1 and -1. Then primordial helium,\nformed in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, captures all $X^{--}$ in neutral \"atoms\" of\nO-helium (OHe). Schrodinger equation for system of nucleus and OHe is\nconsidered and reduced to an equation of relative motion in a spherically\nsymmetrical potential, formed by the Yukawa tail of nuclear scalar isoscalar\nattraction potential, acting on He beyond the nucleus, and dipole Coulomb\nrepulsion between the nucleus and OHe at small distances between nuclear\nsurfaces of He and nucleus.

These data\nallow us to conclude, with some confidence, that the emission at 16 micron in\npassive ETGs is stellar in origin, consistent with previous work concluding\nthat the excess mid-infrared emission comes from the dusty envelopes around\nevolved AGB stars. There is little evidence for the mid-infrared emission of an\nunresolved central component, as might arise in the presence of a dusty torus\nassociated with a low-luminosity AGN. We nonetheless find that the 16 micron\nemission is more centrally peaked than the near-infrared emission, implying a\nradial stellar population gradient. By comparing with independent evidence from\nstudies at optical wavelengths, we conclude that a metallicity that falls with\nincreasing radius is the principal driver of the observed gradient. We also\nplot the mid-infrared colour-magnitude diagram and combine with similar work on\nthe Coma cluster to define the colour-magnitude relation for absolute K-band\nmagnitudes from -26 to -19.

Recent analysis of\ninfrared interferometry observations suggests that the ionised outflows ejected\nby the central engine are not aligned with the symmetry axis of the obscuring\ntorus. This conclusion was obtained by extrapolating the apparent orientation\nof the narrow line region to the inner parts of the ionisation cones.

Furthermore, X-ray\npolarimetry across a broad photon energy range may independently verify the\nmisalignment between the ionisation cones and the axis of the torus. To model\nthe expected polarisation percentage and position angle, we apply the radiative\ntransfer code STOKES.

The adiabatic contraction process to form the dark\nstar would result in a highly concentrated density profile of the host halo at\nthe same time, which may give enhanced indirect detection signals of dark\nmatter. In this work we investigate the extragalactic $\\gamma$-ray background\nfrom dark matter annihilation with such a dark star formation scenario, and\nemploy the isotropic $\\gamma$-ray data from Fermi-LAT to constrain the model\nparameters of dark matter. The results suffer from large uncertainties of both\nthe formation rate of the first generation stars and the subsequent evolution\neffects of the host halos of the dark stars. We find, in the most optimistic\ncase for $\\gamma$-ray production via dark matter annihilation, the expected\nextragalactic $\\gamma$-ray flux will be enhanced by 1-2 orders of magnitude. In\nsuch a case, the annihilation cross section of the supersymmetric dark matter\ncan be constrained to the thermal production level, and the leptonic dark\nmatter model which is proposed to explain the positron/electron excesses can be\nwell excluded.

The mass of the warm gas is 10% of the cold gas,\nbut dominates the luminosity of the CO ladder. The temperature of the warm gas\nis in excellent agreement with H2 rotational lines. At 1350 K, H2 dominates the\ncooling (~20 L_sun/M_sun) in the ISM compared to CO (~0.4 L_sun/M_sun). We\nfound that only a non-ionizing source such as the mechanical energy from\nsupernovae and stellar winds can excite the warm gas and satisfy the energy\nbudget of ~20 L_sun/M_sun. We detect a massive molecular outflow in Arp 220\nfrom the analysis of strong P-Cygni line profiles observed in OH+, H2O+, and\nH2O. The outflow has a mass > 10^{7} M_sun and is bound to the nuclei with\nvelocity < 250 km/s.

These stars are known to show\npronounced photometric variability, which can be used for a more detailed\ncharacterisation of these highly evolved stars. Owing to their well-studied\nparameters, these Local Group members are ideal candidates for comparative\nstudies.

We carried out\ntime-series photometry in the i-band of the two target galaxies with the Nordic\nOptical Telescope (NOT), covering a time span of \\approx2.5 years. These data\nwere then combined with single-epoch K-band photometry, also obtained with the\nNOT. Narrow-band photometry data from the literature was used to distinguish\nbetween O-rich and C-rich stars.

As an attempt to discriminate among several possible\nproduction scenarios, astrophysicists try to test the statistical isotropy of\nthe directions of arrival of these cosmic rays. At the highest energies, they\nare supposed to point toward their sources with good accuracy. However, the\nobservations are so rare that testing the distribution of such samples of\ndirectional data on the sphere is nontrivial. In this paper, we choose a\nnonparametric framework that makes weak hypotheses on the alternative\ndistributions and allows in turn to detect various and possibly unexpected\nforms of anisotropy. We explore two particular procedures. Both are derived\nfrom fitting the empirical distribution with wavelet expansions of densities.\nWe use the wavelet frame introduced by [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 38 (2006b) 574-594\n(electronic)], the so-called needlets. The expansions are truncated at scale\nindices no larger than some ${J^{\\star}}$, and the $L^p$ distances between\nthose estimates and the null density are computed. One family of tests (called\nMultiple) is based on the idea of testing the distance from the null for each\nchoice of $J=1,\\ldots,{J^{\\star}}$, whereas the so-called PlugIn approach is\nbased on the single full ${J^{\\star}}$ expansion, but with thresholded wavelet\ncoefficients. We describe the practical implementation of these two procedures\nand compare them to other methods in the literature. As alternatives to\nisotropy, we consider both very simple toy models and more realistic\nnonisotropic models based on Physics-inspired simulations.

We\nderive corresponding limits on the cosmic abundance of UCMHs at different\nepochs, and translate them into constraints on the primordial power spectrum.\nWe find the resulting constraints to be quite severe, especially at length\nscales much smaller than what can be directly probed by the cosmic microwave\nbackground or large-scale structure observations.

These putative discrepancies could\nall be alleviated if the stellar IMF is systematically weighted toward more\nhigh-mass star formation in rapidly star-forming galaxies. Here, we explore how\nthe IMF might vary under the central assumption that the turnover mass in the\nIMF, Mc, scales with the Jeans mass in giant molecular clouds (GMCs), M_J. We\nemploy hydrodynamic and radiative transfer simulations of galaxies to predict\nhow the typical GMC Jeans mass, and hence the IMF, varies with galaxy property.\nWe then study the impact of such an IMF on the star formation law, the SFR-M*\nrelation, submillimetre galaxies (SMGs), and the cosmic SFR density. Our main\nresults are: The H2 mass-weighted Jeans mass in a galaxy scales with the SFR\nwhen the SFR is greater a few M_sun/yr. SPS modeling shows that this results in\na nonlinear relation between SFR and Lbol, such that SFR Lbol^0.88. Using this\nmodel relation, the inferred SFR of local ULIRGs decreases by ~2, and that of\nhigh-z SMGs decreases by ~3-5.

Abstract: Direct collapse of supermassive stars (SMSs) is a possible pathway for\ngenerating supermassive black holes in the early universe. It is expected that\nan SMS could form via very rapid mass accretion with Mdot ~ 0.1 - 1 Msun/yr\nduring the gravitational collapse of an atomic-cooling primordial gas cloud. In\nthis paper we study how stars would evolve under such extreme rapid mass\naccretion, focusing on the early evolution until the stellar mass reaches 1000\nMsun. To this end we numerically calculate the detailed interior structure of\naccreting stars with primordial element abundances. Our results show that for\naccretion rates higher than 0.01 Msun/yr, stellar evolution is qualitatively\ndifferent from that expected at lower rates. While accreting at these high\nrates the star always has a radius exceeding 100 Rsun, which increases\nmonotonically with the stellar mass. The mass-radius relation for stellar\nmasses exceeding ~ 100 Msun follows the same track with R_* \\propto M_*^0.5 in\nall cases with accretion rates > 0.01 Msun/yr; at a stellar mass of 1000 Msun\nthe radius is about 7000 Rsun (~= 30 AU).

In particular,\nfor accretion rates exceeding Mdot > 0.1 Msun/yr, there is no significant\nhydrogen burning even after 1000 Msun have accreted onto the protostar. Such\n\"supergiant\" protostars have effective temperatures as low as Teff ~= 5000 K\nthroughout their evolution and because they hardly emit ionizing photons, they\ndo not create an HII region or significantly heat their immediate surroundings.\nThus, radiative feedback is unable to hinder the growth of rapidly accreting\nstars to masses in excess of 1000 Msun, as long as material is accreted at\nrates Mdot > 0.01 Msun/yr. \n\n"}

Far-infrared lensed galaxy\nsurveys (e.g. at 60um) strongly select for high-redshift galaxies with caustics\nclose to AGN, boosting the apparent bolometric contribution of AGN. The lens\nconfiguration of IRAS F10214+4724 is naturally explained in this context.\nConversely, submm/mm-wave surveys (e.g. 500-1400um) strongly select for\ncaustics close to knots of star formation boosting the latter's bolometric\nfraction. In general, estimates of bolometric fractions from spectral energy\ndistributions of strongly lensed infrared galaxies are so unreliable as to be\nuseless, unless a lens mass model is available to correct for differential\nmagnification. \n\n"}

The\ncorresponding perturbations are both scale invariant and special conformally\ninvariant. We exploit the operator product expansion technique of conformal\nfield theories to study the inflationary correlators enjoying the symmetries\npresent during the de Sitter epoch. The operator product expansion is\nparticularly powerful in characterizing inflationary correlation functions in\ntwo observationally interesting limits, the squeezed limit of the three-point\ncorrelator and the collapsed limit of the four-point correlator. Despite the\nfact that the shape of the four-point correlators is not fixed by the\nsymmetries of de Sitter, its exact shape can be found in the collapsed limit\nmaking use of the operator product expansion. By employing the fact that\nconformal invariance imposes the two-point cross-correlations of the light\nfields to vanish unless the fields have the same conformal weights, we are able\nto show that the Suyama-Yamaguchi inequality relating the coefficients $f_{\\rm\nNL}$ of the bispectrum in the squeezed limit and $\\tau_{\\rm NL}$ of the\ntrispectrum in the collapsed limit also holds when the light fields are\nintrinsically non-Gaussian.

The observation of a strong violation of the inequality will\nthen have profound implications for inflationary models as it will imply either\nthat multifield inflation cannot be responsible for generating the observed\nfluctuations independently of the details of the model or that some new\nnon-trivial degrees of freedom play a role during inflation. \n\n"}

We\ndetect Lya emission from 7 out of the 20 hosts, with the typical limiting\n3sigma line flux being 8E-18 erg/cm2/s, corresponding to a Lya luminosity of\n6E41 erg/s at z=3. The Lya luminosities for the 7 hosts in which we detect Lya\nemission are in the range (0.6-2.3)E42 erg/s corresponding to star-formation\nrates of 0.6-2.1 Msun/yr (not corrected for extinction). The rest-frame Lya\nequivalent widths (EWs) for the 7 hosts are in the range 9-40A. For 6 of the 13\nhosts for which Lya is not detected we place fairly strong 3sigma upper limits\non the EW (<20A), while for others the EW is either unconstrained or has a less\nconstraining upper limit. We find that the distribution of Lya EWs is\ninconsistent with being drawn from the Lya EW distribution of bright Lyman\nbreak galaxies at the 98.3% level, in the sense that the TOUGH hosts on average\nhave larger EWs than bright LBGs. We can exclude an early indication, based on\na smaller, heterogeneous sample of pre-Swift GRB hosts, that all GRB hosts are\nLya emitters. We find that the TOUGH hosts on average have lower EWs than the\npre-Swift GRB hosts, but the two samples are only inconsistent at the 92%\nlevel. The velocity centroid of the Lya line is redshifted by 200-700 km/s with\nrespect to the systemic velocity, similar to what is seen for LBGs, possibly\nindicating star-formation driven outflows from the host galaxies. There seems\nto be a trend between the Lya EW and the optical to X-ray spectral index of the\nafterglow (beta_OX), hinting that dust plays a role in the observed strength\nand even presence of Lya emission.

The process of disintegration\nculminated with an outburst on December 17.6 (T+1.6 d) and this delayed\nresponse is inconsistent with the rubble pile model. Probable cause was thermal\nstress from the heat pulse into the nucleus after perihelion, which could also\nproduce fragmentation of sungrazers far from the Sun. The spine tail was a\nsynchronic feature, made up of dust released at <30 m/s. Since the nucleus\nwould have been located on the synchrone, we computed the astrometric positions\nof the missing nucleus as the coordinates of the points of intersection of the\nspine tail's axis with lines of forced orbital-period variation, derived from\norbital solutions based on preperihelion astrometry from the ground. The\nresulting osculating orbital period was 698+/-2 years, which proves that C/2011\nW3 is the first major member of the predicted new, 21st-century cluster of\nbright Kreutz-system sungrazers. The spine tail's tip contained dust 1-2 mm in\ndiameter. The bizarre appearance of the dust tail in images taken hours after\nperihelion with coronagraphs on SOHO and STEREO is readily understood.

Recently, the $f(T)$ gravity has been invoked as an\nalternative approach for explaining the observed acceleration expansion of the\nUniverse. If gravity is described by a $f(T)$ theory instead of general\nrelativity, there are a number of issues that ought to be reexamined in the\nframework of $f(T)$ theories. In this work, to proceed further with the current\ninvestigation of the limits and potentialities of the $f(T)$ gravity theories,\nwe derive and discuss the bounds imposed by the energy conditions on a general\n$f(T)$ functional form. The null and strong energy conditions in the framework\nof $f(T)$ gravity are derived from first principles, namely the purely\ngeometric Raychaudhuri's equation along with the requirement that gravity is\nattractive. The weak and dominant energy conditions are then obtained in a\ndirect approach via an effective energy-momentum tensor for $f(T)$ gravity.\nAlthough similar, the energy condition inequalities are different from those of\ngeneral relativity (GR), but in the limit $f(T)=T$ the standard forms for the\nenergy conditions in GR are recovered.

Several mysteries cloud the interpretation\nof this event: (1) extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray\nlight curve during the first 10 days after the gamma-ray trigger; (2)\nunexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission months after\ntrigger; (3) no obvious evidence for jet precession, despite misalignment\ntypically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disk and BH;\n(4) recent abrupt shut-off in jet X-ray emission after 1.5 years. Here we show\nthat all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one\nassumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Phi threading the BH.\nInitially, Phi is weak relative to high fall-back mass accretion rate, Mdot,\nand the disk and jets precess about the BH axis = our line of sight. As Mdot\ndrops, Phi becomes dynamically important and leads to a magnetically-arrested\ndisk (MAD). MAD naturally aligns disk and jet axis along the BH spin axis, but\nonly after a violent rearrangement phase (jet wobbling). This explains the\nerratic light curve at early times and the lack of precession at later times.\nWe use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain BH and disrupted star\nproperties, finding that a solar-mass main sequence star disrupted by a\nrelatively low mass, M~10^5-10^6 Msun, BH is consistent with the data, while a\nWD disruption (though still possible) is disfavored. The magnetic flux required\nto power Swift J1644+57 is too large to be supplied by the star itself, but it\ncould be collected from a quiescent `fossil' accretion disk present in the\ngalactic nucleus prior to the TD. The presence (lack of) of such a fossil disk\ncould be a deciding factor in what TD events are accompanied by powerful\njets.[abridged] \n\n"}

The 1st of these encompasses the main sequence\n(MS) of SFGs, the 2nd one a rarer population of starbursts (SB). We show that\nthe sSFR-distribution of SBs can be regarded as the result of a physical\nprocess (plausibly merging) taking the mathematical form of a log-normal\nboosting kernel and enhancing star formation activity. We explore the utility\nof splitting the star-forming population into MS and SB galaxies - an approach\nwe term \"2-Star Formation Mode\" (2-SFM) framework - for understanding their\nmolecular gas properties. Variations of star formation efficiency (SFE) and gas\nfractions among SFGs take a simple, redshift-independent form, once these\nquantities are normalized to the value of an average MS galaxy. The change in\nSFE for galaxies undergoing a starburst event scales supra-linearly with the\nSFR-increase, as expected for mergers. This implies a continuous distribution\nof galaxies in the Schmidt-Kennicutt plane that separates more clearly into\nloci for SBs and normal galaxies than observed in SFR vs. M* space. SBs with\nthe largest deviations (>10-fold) from the MS, like many local ULIRGs, are not\naverage SBs, but even rarer events with progenitors having larger gas fractions\nthan typical MS galaxies. We statistically infer that the gas fractions of\ntypical SBs decrease by a factor of 2 to 3 with respect to their direct MS\nprogenitors, as expected to occur in short-term SFR-boosts during which\ninternal gas reservoirs are drained more quickly than gas is accreted from the\ncosmic web. We predict variations of the CO-to-H2 conversion factor in the\nSFR-M* plane and provide evidence that the higher sSFR of distant galaxies is a\ndirect consequence of larger gas fraction in these systems. \n\n"}

To\ncompare such models to observations, one must understand how to translate\nbetween surface densities observed averaging over large (~kpc) scales and\nsurface densities on the scale of individual clouds (~pc scale), which are\ntreated by models. We define a \"clumping factor\" that captures this translation\nas the ratio of the mass-weighted surface density, which is often the quantity\nof physical interest, to the area-weighted surface density, which is observed.\nWe use high spatial resolution (sub-kpc) maps of CO and HI emission from nearby\ngalaxies to measure the clumping factor of both atomic and molecular gas.

These data allowed us to analyse the\nlight curve of the object during its eruption, as well as the potential\nvariability of its progenitor. In the archives of several infrared surveys,\nnamely 2MASS, MSX, Spitzer, AKARI, WISE, and VVV, we found measurements of the\nobject, which allowed us to study the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the\nobject. We constructed a simple model of a star surrounded by a dusty envelope,\nwhich was used to interpret the observed SED.

We searched for possible high-energy counterparts to\nPTF11agg, but found no evidence for associated prompt emission. We therefore\nconsider three possible scenarios to account for a GRB-like afterglow without a\nhigh-energy counterpart: an \"untriggered\" GRB (lack of satellite coverage), an\n\"orphan\" afterglow (viewing-angle effects), and a \"dirty fireball\" (suppressed\nhigh-energy emission).

This offset in the spectrum will\nstrongly impact its use for precision cosmological study if left unmitigated.\nWe also propose here a method to calibrate this $\\phi I$ contamination through\nuse of a scaling relation that allows one to reduce the impact of $\\phi I$ by a\nfactor of 20 or more in all redshift bins, which would reduce its magnitude\ndown to detection limits in almost all cases.

The integrated HI intensity WHI and tau353 show a large\nscatter with a correlation coefficient of ~0.6 for a Td range from 16 K to 22\nK. We find, however, that WHI and tau353 show better correlation for smaller\nranges of Td every 0.5 K, generally with a correlation coefficient of 0.7-0.9.\nWe set up a hypothesis that the HI gas associated with the highest Td >= 21.5 K\nis optically thin, whereas the HI emission is generally optically thick for Td\nlower than 21.5 K. We have determined a relationship for the optically thin HI\ngas between atomic hydrogen column density and tau353, NHI (cm-2) = (1.5 x\n10^26) x tau353, under the assumption that the dust properties are uniform and\nwe have applied this to estimate NHI from tau353 for the whole cloud.

On the Relationship Between Disk Stability\n  and Star Formation Abstract: We study the relationship between the stability level of late-type galaxy\ndisks and their star-formation activity using integral-field gaseous and\nstellar kinematic data. Specifically, we compare the two-component (gas+stars)\nstability parameter from Romeo & Wiegert (Q_RW), incorporating stellar\nkinematic data for the first time, and the star-formation rate estimated from\n21cm continuum emission. We determine the stability level of each disk\nprobabilistically using a Bayesian analysis of our data and a simple dynamical\nmodel. Our method incorporates the shape of the stellar velocity ellipsoid\n(SVE) and yields robust SVE measurements for over 90% of our sample. Averaging\nover this subsample, we find a meridional shape of sigma_z/sigma_R =\n0.51^{+0.36}_{-0.25} for the SVE and, at 1.5 disk scale lengths, a stability\nparameter of Q_RW = 2.0 +/- 0.9. We also find that the disk-averaged\nstar-formation-rate surface density (Sigma-dot_e,*) is correlated with the\ndisk-averaged gas and stellar mass surface densities (Sigma_e,g and Sigma_e,*)\nand anti-correlated with Q_RW. We show that an anti-correlation between\nSigma-dot_e,* and Q_RW can be predicted using empirical scaling relations, such\nthat this outcome is consistent with well-established statistical properties of\nstar-forming galaxies. Interestingly, Sigma-dot_e,* is not correlated with the\ngas-only or star-only Toomre parameters, demonstrating the merit of calculating\na multi-component stability parameter when comparing to star-formation\nactivity.

We implement a new galaxy-wide stellar initial\nmass function (Top Heavy Integrated Galaxy Initial Mass Function, TH-IGIMF) in\nthe semi-analytic model SAG and evaluate its impact on the chemical evolution\nof galaxies. The SFR-dependence of the slope of the TH-IGIMF is found to be key\nto reproducing the correct [a/Fe]-stellar mass relation. Massive galaxies reach\nhigher [a/Fe] abundance ratios because they are characterized by more top-heavy\nIMFs as a result of their higher SFR. As a consequence of our analysis, the\nvalue of the minimum embedded star cluster mass and of the slope of the\nembedded cluster mass function, which are free parameters involved in the\nTH-IGIMF theory, are found to be as low as 5 solar masses and 2, respectively.\nA mild downsizing trend is present for galaxies generated assuming either a\nuniversal IMF or a variable TH-IGIMF. We find that, regardless of galaxy mass,\nolder galaxies (with formation redshifts > 2) are formed in shorter time-scales\n(< 2 Gyr), thus achieving larger [a/Fe] values. Hence, the time-scale of galaxy\nformation alone cannot explain the slope of the [a/Fe]-galaxy mass relation,\nbut is responsible for the big dispersion of [a/Fe] abundance ratios at fixed\nstellar mass.We further test the hyphothesis of a TH-IGIMF in elliptical\ngalaxies by looking into mass-to-light ratios, and luminosity functions.

Previous studies have\nshown that the presence of X-ray selected AGN in rich galaxy clusters is\nsuppressed. In the current study we investigate the occurrence of X-ray\nselected AGN in low and moderate X-ray luminosity galaxy clusters. Due to the\nwide contiguous XMM-LSS survey area we are able to extend the study to the\ncluster outskirts. We therefore determine the projected overdensity of X-ray\npoint-like sources out to 6r_{500} radius. To provide robust statistical\nresults we also use a stacking analysis of the cluster projected overdensities.\nWe investigate whether the observed X-ray overdensities are to be expected by\nestimating also the corresponding optical galaxy overdensities. We find a\npositive X-ray projected overdensity at the first radial bin, which is however\nof the same amplitude as that of optical galaxies. Therefore, no suppression of\nX-ray AGN activity with respect to the field is found, implying that the\nmechanisms responsible for the suppression are not so effective in lower\ndensity environments. After a drop to roughly the background level between 2\nand 3r_{500}, the X-ray overdensity exhibits a rise at larger radii,\nsignificantly larger than the corresponding optical overdensity. Finally, using\nredshift information of all optical counterparts, we derive the spatial\noverdensity profile of the clusters. We find that the agreement between X-ray\nand optical overdensities in the first radial bin is also suggested in the\n3-dimensional analysis. However, we argue that the X-ray overdensity \"bump\" at\nlarger radial distance is probably a result of flux boosting by gravitational\nlensing of background QSOs.

Here we show that for large\ngrains (size >0.1 micron, containing most grain mass) in sufficiently large\nmolecular clouds (radii >1-10 pc, masses >10^4 M_sun), this scale becomes\nlarger than the characteristic sizes of pre-stellar cores (the sonic length),\nso large fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio are imprinted on cores. As a\nresult, star clusters and protostellar disks formed in large clouds should\nexhibit significant abundance spreads in the elements preferentially found in\nlarge grains. This naturally predicts populations of carbon-enhanced stars,\ncertain highly unusual stellar populations observed in nearby open clusters,\nand may explain the 'UV upturn' in early-type galaxies. It will also\ndramatically change planet formation in the resulting protostellar disks, by\npreferentially 'seeding' disks with an enhancement in large carbonaceous or\nsilicate grains. The relevant threshold for this behavior scales simply with\ncloud densities and temperatures, making straightforward predictions for\nclusters in starbursts and high-redshift galaxies. Because of the selective\nsorting by size, this process is not necessarily visible in extinction mapping.\nWe also predict the shape of the abundance distribution -- when these\nfluctuations occur, a small fraction of the cores may actually be seeded with\nabundances ~100 times the mean, such that they are almost 'totally metal'\n(Z~1)!

Dust Properties and Insights into the Origin of the Submm Excess\n  Emission Abstract: The dust properties in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are studied\nusing the HERITAGE Herschel Key Project photometric data in five bands from 100\nto 500 micron. Three simple models of dust emission were fit to the\nobservations: a single temperature blackbody modified by a power- law\nemissivity (SMBB), a single temperature blackbody modified by a broken\npower-law emissivity (BEMBB), and two blackbodies with different temperatures,\nboth modified by the same power-law emissivity (TTMBB). Using these models we\ninvestigate the origin of the submm excess; defined as the submillimeter\n(submm) emission above that expected from SMBB models fit to observations < 200\nmicron. We find that the BEMBB model produces the lowest fit residuals with\npixel-averaged 500 micron submm excesses of 27% and 43% for the LMC and SMC,\nrespectively.

A recurring feature of\nthese outflows is their broad ionization distribution, including essentially\nall ionization levels (e.g., Fe^0+ to Fe^25+). This characteristic feature can\nbe quantified with the absorption measure distribution (AMD), defined as the\ndistribution of column density with ionization parameter |dN / dlog xi|.\nObserved AMDs extend over 0.1 < xi < 10^4 (cgs), and are remarkably similar in\ndifferent objects. Power-law fits (|dN /dlog xi| ~ N_1 xi^a) yield N_1 =\n3x10^{21} cm^-2 +- 0.4 dex and a = 0 -- 0.4. What is the source of this broad\nionization distribution, and what sets the small range of observed $N_1$ and\n$a$? A common interpretation is a multiphase outflow, with a wide range of gas\ndensities in a uniform gas pressure medium. However, the incident radiation\npressure leads to a gas pressure gradient in the photoionized gas, and\ntherefore to a broad range of ionization states within a single slab.

Thus, radiation pressure compression\n(RPC) of the photoionized gas provides a natural explanation for the observed\nAMD.

A proper treatment of heat transport is crucial especially in the\noutskirts of clusters and also in high density regions. It's connection to the\nlocal dynamical state of the cluster also might contribute to the observed\nbimodal distribution of cool core and non cool core clusters. Our new scheme\nsignificantly advances the modelling of thermal conduction in numerical\nsimulations and overall gives better results compared to observations. \n\n"}

Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), among the best candidates\nfor dark matter, can be their own antimatter and can annihilate inside the\nstar, thereby providing a heat source. Although dark matter constitutes only\n$\\lesssim 0.1\\%$ of the stellar mass, this amount is sufficient to power the\nstar for millions to billions of years. Thus, the first phase of stellar\nevolution in the history of the Universe may have been dark stars. We review\nhow dark stars come into existence, how they grow as long as dark matter fuel\npersists, and their stellar structure and evolution. The studies were done in\ntwo different ways, first assuming polytropic interiors and more recently using\nthe MESA stellar evolution code; the basic results are the same. Dark stars are\ngiant, puffy ($\\sim$ 10 AU) and cool (surface temperatures $\\sim$10,000 K)\nobjects. We follow the evolution of dark stars from their inception at $\\sim 1\nM_\\odot$ as they accrete mass from their surroundings to become supermassive\nstars, some even reaching masses $> 10^6 M_\\odot$ and luminosities $>10^{10}\nL_\\odot$, making them detectable with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.\nOnce the dark matter runs out and the dark star dies, it may collapse to a\nblack hole; thus dark stars may provide seeds for the supermassive black holes\nobserved throughout the Universe and at early times. Other sites for dark star\nformation may exist in the Universe today in regions of high dark matter\ndensity such as the centers of galaxies.

Because they form a relatively homogeneous\npopulation, with high stellar masses and red colors, they are expected to\noccupy halos in a relatively simple way. In this paper, we study how LRGs\noccupy massive halos via direct counts in clusters and we reveal several\nunexpected trends suggesting that the connection between LRGs and dark matter\nhalos may not be straightforward. Using the redMaPPer cluster catalog, we\nderive the central occupation of LRGs as a function richness, Ncen({\\lambda}).\nAssuming no correlation between cluster mass and central galaxy luminosity at\nfixed richness, we show that clusters contain a significantly lower fraction of\ncentral LRGs than predicted from the two-point correlation function. At halo\nmasses of 10^14.5 Msun, we find Ncen=0.73, compared to Ncen of 0.89 from\ncorrelation studies. Our central occupation function for LRGs converges to 0.95\nat large halo masses. A strong anti-correlation between central luminosity and\ncluster mass at fixed richness is required to reconcile our results with those\nbased on clustering studies.

{"id": "1509.07877", "contents": "Title: A Constrained-Gradient Method to Control Divergence Errors in Numerical\n  MHD Abstract: In numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a major challenge is maintaining\nzero magnetic field-divergence (div-B). Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are\nsufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using\nonly the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,\norder-of-magnitude errors. \n\n"}

This is the first source from the\nPlanck catalogue of high-z candidates that has been completely characterised\nwith follow-up observations from the optical to the sub-millimetre domain.\nHerschel/SPIRE observations at 250, 350 and 500 microns reveal the existence of\nfive sources producing a 500 microns emission excess that spatially corresponds\nto the candidate proto-clusters discovered by Planck.

We examine the\neffect of streaming velocities on the galaxy correlation function, including\nall leading-order contributions for the first time.

Since correlations in the streaming\nvelocity change rapidly at the BAO scale, this advection term can cause a\nsignificant shift in the observed BAO position. If streaming velocities impact\ntracer density at the 1% level, compared to the linear bias, the recovered BAO\nscale is shifted by approximately 0.5%.

We have performed\nhydrodynamic simulations of an asymptotic giant branch star interacting with\ncompanions with a range of masses in orbits with a range of initial\neccentricities and periastron separations.

Using a principle component analysis in\nparameter space, we find that the large Surprise between WMAP 9 and Planck 13\n(S = 17.6 bits, implying a deviation from consistency at 99.8% confidence) is\ndue to a shift along a direction that is dominated by the amplitude of the\npower spectrum.

The lower\nfraction of quiescent galaxies seen in large-scale dense environments, if\nconfirmed to be true, may be associated with the fact that the star formation\ncan be more easily sustained via cold stream accretion in `large-scale'\nhigh-density regions, preventing galaxies from permanent quenching.

The\nstellar template is derived iteratively from the science observations\nthemselves without a need for separate observations dedicated to retrieving it.\nDespite limitations from CSHELL's narrow wavelength range and instrumental\nsystematics, we are able to (1) obtain an RV precision of 35 m/s for the RV\nstandard star GJ 15 A over a time baseline of 817 days, reaching the photon\nnoise limit for our attained SNR, (2) achieve ~3 m/s RV precision for the M\ngiant SV Peg over a baseline of several days and confirm its long-term RV trend\ndue to stellar pulsations, as well as obtain nightly noise floors of ~2 - 6\nm/s, and (3) show that our data are consistent with the known masses, periods,\nand orbital eccentricities of the two most massive planets orbiting GJ 876.\nFuture applications of our pipeline to RV surveys using the next generation of\nNIR spectrographs, such as iSHELL, will enable the potential detection of\nSuper-Earths and Mini-Neptunes in the habitable zones of M dwarfs. \n\n"}

We study their high-energy signatures, focusing on\nthe role of pair-enriched bubbles produced by young magnetars, rapidly-rotating\nneutron stars, and magnetized white dwarfs. (i) First, we study the nebular\nproperties and the conditions allowing for escape of high-energy gamma-rays and\nradio waves, showing that their escape is possible for nebulae with ages of\n>10-100 yr. In the rapidly-rotating neutron star scenario, we find that radio\nemission from the quasi-steady nebula itself may be bright enough to be\ndetected especially at sub-mm frequencies, which is relevant as a possible\ncounterpart of pulsar-driven SNe and FRBs. (ii) Second, we consider the fate of\nbursting emission in the nebulae. We suggest that an impulsive burst may lead\nto a highly relativistic flow, which would interact with the nebula. If the\nshocked nebula is still relativistic, pre-existing non-thermal particles in the\nnebula can be significantly boosted by the forward shock, leading to\nshort-duration (maybe millisecond or longer) high-energy gamma-ray flashes.\nPossible dissipation at the reverse shock may also lead to gamma-ray emission.\n(iii) After such flares, interactions with the baryonic ejecta may lead to\nafterglow emission with a duration of days to weeks. In the magnetar scenario,\nthis burst-in-bubble model leads to the expectation that nearby (<10-100 Mpc)\nhigh-energy gamma-ray flashes may be detected by HAWC and CTA, and the\nsubsequent afterglow emission may be seen by radio telescopes such as VLA.

For a galaxy halo of given compactness\n($\\chi=2GM/Rc^2$), certain values for the dark matter entropy yield a dense\ncentral object lacking an event horizon.

Core creation is\nregarded as one of the most promising solutions to potential issues faced by\nthe lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmology on small scales. For example,\nthe reduced dynamical mass enclosed by cores can explain the low rotational\nvelocities measured for nearby dwarf galaxies, thus possibly lifting the\nseeming contradiction with the LambdaCDM expectations (the so-called \"too big\nto fail\" problem). Here we test core creation as a solution of cosmological\nissues by using a sample of dwarfs with measurements of their atomic hydrogen\n(HI) kinematics extending to large radii. Using the NIHAO hydrodynamical\nsimulation as an example, we show that core creation can successfully reproduce\nthe kinematics of dwarfs with small kinematic radii, R <~ 1.5 kpc.

The radially\ncooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and\npeanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a\nvertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,\nvelocity dispersion that dominates this evolution. Assuming that early stellar\ndiscs heat rapidly as they form, then both the in-plane and vertical random\nmotions correlate with stellar age and chemistry, leading to different density\ndistributions for metal-rich and metal-poor stars. We then use a\nhigh-resolution simulation, in which all stars form out of gas, to demonstrate\nthat this is what happens. When we apply these results to the Milky Way we show\nthat a very broad range of observed trends for ages, densities, kinematics and\nchemistries, that have been presented as evidence for contradictory paths to\nthe formation of the bulge, are in fact consistent with a bulge which formed\nfrom a continuum of disc stellar populations which were kinematically separated\nby the bar.

Here, we systematically examine the birth, evolution\nand collapse of accreting non-rotating supermassive stars under accretion rates\nof 0.01-10 solar masses per year, using the stellar evolution code KEPLER. Our\napproach includes post-Newtonian corrections to the stellar structure and an\nadaptive nuclear network, and can transition to following the hydrodynamic\nevolution of supermassive stars after they encounter the general relativistic\ninstability. We find that this instability triggers the collapse of the star at\nmasses of 150,000-330,000 solar masses for accretion rates of 0.1-10 solar\nmasses per year, and that the final mass of the star scales roughly\nlogarithmically with the rate. The structure of the star, and thus its\nstability against collapse, is sensitive to the treatment of convection, and\nthe heat content of the outer accreted envelope. Comparison with other codes\nsuggests differences here may lead to small deviations in the evolutionary\nstate of the star as a function of time, that worsen with accretion rate.

We can constrain the strength of the new gravitational\nterms through observations of inflationary imprints in the actual universe. In\nthis paper we analyze the effects on slow-roll models due to a Chern-Simons\nterm coupled to the inflaton field through a generic coupling function\n$f(\\phi)$. A well known result is the polarization of primordial gravitational\nwaves (PGW) into left and right eigenstates, as a consequence of parity\nbreaking. In such a scenario the modifications to the power spectrum of PGW are\nsuppressed under the conditions that allow to avoid the production of ghost\ngravitons at a certain energy scale, the so-called Chern-Simons mass $M_{CS}$.\nIn general it has been recently pointed out that there is very little hope to\nefficiently constrain chirality of PGW on the basis solely of two-point\nstatistics from future CMB data, even in the most optimistic cases. Thus we\nsearch if significant parity breaking signatures can arise at least in the\nbispectrum statistics. We find that the tensor-tensor-scalar bispectra $\\langle\n\\gamma \\gamma \\zeta \\rangle$ for each polarization state are the only ones that\nare not suppressed. Their amplitude, setting the level of parity breaking\nduring inflation, is proportional to the second derivative of the coupling\nfunction $f(\\phi)$ and they turn out to be maximum in the squeezed limit.

However, there have been few constraints on the\noccurrence rate of such radio flares or on the correlation with pre-main\nsequence X-ray flares, although such correlations are known for the Sun and\nnearby active stars.

We use previously published\nmeasurements of those properties, and our own measurements of arm and bar\ncontrasts for a large sample of galaxies, using $3.6 \\mathrm{\\mu m}$ images\nfrom the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G). Flocculent\ngalaxies are clearly distinguished from other spiral arm classes, especially by\ntheir lower stellar mass and surface density. Multi-armed and grand-design\ngalaxies are similar in most of their fundamental parameters, excluding some\nbar properties and the bulge-to-total ratio. Based on these results, we revisit\nthe sequence of spiral arm classes, and discuss classical bulges as a necessary\ncondition for standing spiral wave modes in grand-design galaxies. We find a\nstrong correlation between bulge-to-total ratio and bar contrast, and a weaker\ncorrelation between arm and bar contrasts.

Interestingly, the bar contrast, and its increase from\nflocculent to grand-design galaxies, is systematically more significant than\nthat of the arm contrast.

In particular, the accretion shock region, where the accreting\nmaterial is heated to temperatures of a few MK as it continues its inward bulk\nmotion, can be probed by X-ray spectroscopy. To attempt to detect for the first\ntime the motion of this X-ray-emitting post-shock material, we searched for a\nDoppler shift in the deep Chandra/HETGS observation of the CTTS TW Hya. This\ntest should unveil the nature of this X-ray emitting plasma component in CTTS,\nand constrain the accretion stream geometry. We searched for a Doppler shift in\nthe X-ray emission from TW Hya with two different methods, by measuring the\nposition of a selected sample of emission lines, and by fitting the whole TW\nHya X-ray spectrum, allowing the line-of-sight velocity to vary. We found that\nthe plasma at T~2-4 MK has a line-of-sight velocity of 38.3+/-5.1 km/s with\nrespect to the stellar photosphere. This result definitively confirms that this\nX-ray-emitting material originates in the post-shock region, at the base of the\naccretion stream, and not in coronal structures.

Evidence for\ndark energy, the new component that causes the acceleration, has since become\nextremely strong, owing to an impressive variety of increasingly precise\nmeasurements of the expansion history and the growth of structure in the\nuniverse.

In this\nreview, we briefly summarize the developments that led to the discovery of dark\nenergy. Next, we discuss the parametric descriptions of dark energy and the\ncosmological tests that allow us to better understand its nature. We then\nreview the cosmological probes of dark energy.

Abstract: We describe the general inflationary dynamics that can arise with a single,\ncanonically coupled field where the inflaton potential is a 4-th order\npolynomial. This scenario yields a wide range of combinations of the empirical\nspectral observables, $n_s$, $r$ and $\\alpha_s$. However, not all combinations\nare possible and next-generation cosmological experiments have the ability to\nrule out all inflationary scenarios based on this potential.

These can be used to determine the degree of\ntuning associated with different combinations of $n_s$, $r$ and $\\alpha_s$ and\nwill facilitate treatments of the inflationary model selection problem.\nFinally, we comment on the implications of these results for the naturalness of\nthe overall inflationary paradigm. We argue that ruling out all simple\npotentials would not necessarily imply that the inflationary paradigm itself\nwas unnatural, but that this eventuality would increase the importance of\nbuilding inflationary scenarios in the context of broader paradigms of\nultra-high energy physics. \n\n"}

We aim to study, in a quantitative way,\nthe impact of granulation on colours. We use the CIFIST grid of CO5BOLD\nhydrodynamical models to compute emerging fluxes. These in turn are used to\ncompute theoretical colours in the UBVRI,2MASS,Hipparcos,Gaia and SDSS systems.\nEvery CO5BOLD model has a corresponding one dimensional (1D) plane-parallel LHD\nmodel computed for the same atmospheric parameters, which we used to define a\n\"3D correction\" that can be applied to colours computed from fluxes computed\nfrom any 1D model atmosphere code. The 3D corrections on colours are generally\nsmall, of the order of a few hundredths of a magnitude, yet they are far from\nnegligible. We find that ignoring granulation effects can lead to\nunderestimation of Teff by up to 200K and overestimation of gravity by up to\n0.5dex, when using colours as diagnostics. We have identified a major\nshortcoming in how scattering is treated in the current version of the CIFIST\ngrid, which could lead to offsets of the order 0.01mag, especially for colours\ninvolving blue and UV bands.We have investigated the Gaia and Hipparcos\nphotometric systems and found that the (G-H_p),(BP-RP) diagram is immune to the\neffects of granulation.

We use a version of the catalogue containing $245\\,316$ stars with\nall phase space coordinates within a heliocentric distance of $\\sim 10$ kpc. We\ndevise a method to assess the significance of halo substructures based on their\nclustering in velocity space. The two most substantial structures are multiple\nwraps of a stream which has undergone considerable phase mixing (S1, with 94\nmembers) and a kinematically cold stream (S2, with 61 members). The member\nstars of S1 have a median position of ($X,Y,Z$) = ($8.12, -0.22, 2.75$) kpc and\na median metallicity of [Fe/H] $= -1.78$. The stars of S2 have median\ncoordinates ($X,Y,Z$) = ($8.66, 0.30, 0.77$) kpc and a median metallicity of\n[Fe/H] $= -1.91$. They lie in velocity space close to some of the stars in the\nstream reported by Helmi et al. (1999). By modelling, we estimate that both\nstructures had progenitors with virial masses $\\approx 10^{10} M_\\odot$ and\ninfall times $\\gtrsim 9$ Gyr ago. Using abundance matching, these correspond to\nstellar masses between $10^6$ and $10^7 M_\\odot$.

There is no evidence that the mean photometric and\nspectroscopic properties of SLSNe-I differ between low (z<1) and high redshift\n(z>1), but there is clear evidence of diversity in the spectrum at <2000A,\npossibly caused by the variations in temperature between events.

Smooth elliptical mass profiles were previously shown to be\ninadequate in reproducing the quad population. In this paper, we explore the\ndeviations from such smooth elliptical mass distributions. Unlike most other\nwork, we use a model-free approach based on the relative polar image angles of\nquads, and their position in 3D space with respect to the Fundamental Surface\nof Quads. The FSQ is defined by quads produced by elliptical lenses.

The result is unchanged even when subhalo masses are\nincreased by a factor of ten, and the most optimistic lensing selection bias is\napplied. We then produce quads from galaxies created using two components,\nrepresenting baryons and dark matter. The transition from the mass being\ndominated by baryons in inner radii to being dominated by dark matter in outer\nradii can carry with it asymmetries, which would affect relative image angles.\nWe run preliminary experiments using lenses with two elliptical mass components\nwith nonidentical axis ratios and position angles, perturbations from\nellipticity in the form of nonzero Fourier coefficients $a_4$ and $a_6$, and\nartificially offset ellipse centers as a proxy for asymmetry at image radii.

Many of these simulations use moment-based methods\nto track radiative transfer processes using explicit solvers and are therefore\nsubject to strict stability conditions regarding the speed of light, which\nimplies a great computational cost. It can be reduced by assuming a reduced\nspeed of light, and this approximation is now widely used to produce\nlarge-scale simulations of reionization. We introduce a new method for\nestimating and comparing the ionization front speeds based on maps of the\nreionization redshifts. We applied it to a set of cosmological simulations of\nthe reionization using a set of reduced speeds of light, and measured the\nevolution of the ionization front speeds during the reionization process. We\nfind that ionization fronts progress via a two-stage process, the first stage\nat low velocity as the fronts emerge from high density regions and a second\nlater stage just before the overlap, during which front speeds increase close\nto the speed of light. Using a set of small 8Mpc/h^3 simulations, we find that\na minimal velocity of 0.3c is able to model these two stages in this specific\ncontext without significant impact. Values as low as 0.05c can model the first\nlow velocity stage, but limit the acceleration at later times. Lower values\nmodify the distribution of front speeds at all times. Using larger 64Mpc/h^3\nvolumes that better account for distant sources, we find that reduced speed of\nlight has a greater impact on reionization times and front speeds in underdense\nregions that are reionized at late times. The same quantities measured in dense\nregions with slow fronts are less sensitive to c values. \n\n"}

In this work, we use weak lensing as the best\npossible proxy for cluster mass to calibrate the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect\nmeasurements from the APEX-SZ experiment. For a well-defined (ROSAT) X-ray\ncomplete cluster sample, we calibrate the integrated Comptonization parameter,\n$Y_{\\rm SZ}$, to the weak-lensing derived total cluster mass, $M_{500}$.

Here, we use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulation to study the mass dependence, evolution and origin of scatter in the\nSFR-M$_{\\rm star}$ relation. At $z=0$, we find that the scatter decreases\nslightly with stellar mass from 0.35 dex at M$_{\\rm star} \\approx 10^9$\nM$_{\\odot}$ to 0.30 dex at M$_{\\rm star} \\gtrsim 10^{10.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$. The\nscatter decreases from $z=0$ to $z=5$ by 0.05 dex at M$_{\\rm star} \\gtrsim\n10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and by 0.15 dex for lower masses. We show that the scatter\nat $z=0.1$ originates from a combination of fluctuations on short time-scales\n(ranging from 0.2-2 Gyr) that are presumably associated with self-regulation\nfrom cooling, star formation and outflows, but is dominated by long time-scale\n($\\sim 10$ Gyr) variations related to differences in halo formation times.\nShorter time-scale fluctuations are relatively more important for lower-mass\ngalaxies. At high masses, differences in black hole formation efficiency cause\nadditional scatter, but also diminish the scatter caused by different halo\nformation times. While individual galaxies cross the main sequence multiple\ntimes during their evolution, they fluctuate around tracks associated with\ntheir halo properties, i.e. galaxies above/below the main sequence at $z = 0.1$\ntend to have been above/below the main sequence for $\\gg1$ Gyr. \n\n"}

Using Principal Component\nAnalysis we identify the key axes of correlation between these physical\nquantities, for the full galaxy sample and split by satellite/central and\nlow/high halo mass. The first principal component of the z=0 EAGLE galaxy\npopulation is a positive correlation between M_halo, M* and SFR. This component\nis particularly dominant for central galaxies in low mass haloes. The second\nprincipal component, most significant in high mass haloes, is a negative\ncorrelation between M_halo and SFR, indicative of environmental quenching. For\ngalaxies above M*~10^10M_solar, however, the SFR is seen to decouple from the\nM_halo-M* correlation; this result is found to be independent of environment,\nsuggesting that mass quenching effects are also in operation.

We show that this assumption is incorrect when the energy is injected\nin the form of energetic (i.e. energy much greater than the background CMB\ntemperature) particles. We evolve the electromagnetic cascades, from the\ninjection of high energy particles, in the expanding Universe and follow the\nnon-thermal component of CMB spectral distortions resulting from the\ninteraction of the electromagnetic shower with the background photons,\nelectrons, and ions. The electromagnetic shower loses a substantial fraction of\nits energy to the CMB spectral distortions before the energy of the particles\nin the shower has degraded to low enough energies that they can thermalize with\nthe background plasma.

The three hottest known DAs (surface gravity log g $\\geq$\n7.0) have effective temperatures around Teff = 140,000 K, followed by only five\nobjects in the range 104,000 - 120,000 K.

One reason for\nthis discrepancy could be uncertainties in the temperature determination of hot\nDAs using Balmer-line spectroscopy. Recent investigations involving\nmetal-ionization balances in ultraviolet (UV) spectra indeed showed that the\ntemperatures of some DAs were underestimated, but the paucity of extremely hot\nDAs prevailed.

Using a set of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with adaptive mesh\nrefinement, we investigate how photons propagate and escape from turbulent\nclouds with different masses, star formation efficiencies (SFEs), and\nmetallicities, as well as with different models of stellar spectra and\nsupernova feedback. We find that the escape fractions in both LyC and Lya are\ngenerally increasing with time if the cloud is efficiently dispersed by\nradiation and supernova feedback. When the total SFE is low (1% of the cloud\nmass), 0.1-5% of LyC photons leave the metal-poor cloud, whereas the fractions\nincrease to 20-70% in clouds with a 10% SFE. LyC photons escape more\nefficiently if gas metallicity is lower, if the upper mass limit in the stellar\ninitial mass function is higher, if binary interactions are allowed in the\nevolution of stars, or if additional strong radiation pressure, such as Lya\npressure, is present. As a result, the number of escaping LyC photons can\neasily vary by a factor of $\\sim4$ on cloud scales.

We find that a\ntightFIR/Radio correlation is natural when the synchrotron mechanism dominates\nover the inverse Compton, and the electrons cooling time is shorter than the\nfading time of the supernova rate. Observations indicate that both these\nconditions are met in star forming galaxies. However since the radio non\nthermal emission is delayed, deviations are expected both in the early phases\nof a starburst, when the radio thermal component dominates, and in the\npost-starburst phase, when the bulk of the NT component originates from less\nmassive stars.

The broad\nband power spectrum can be fitted by one power law down to frequencies ~1e-7 Hz\nwith flattening afterwards. Such a flattening means that on time scales longer\nthan ~1e7 sec the source variability becomes uncorrelated. This naturally leads\nto the appearance of quasi-poissonian flares in the source light curve, which\nhave been regularly observed in radio and optical spectral bands. The radio\nflux power spectrum appears to have a second break at Fourier frequencies ~1e-5\nHz which can be caused by the smearing of the intrinsic radio variability on\ntimescale of the light-crossing time of the radio emitting region.

If the lens potential is\nsmooth on the scale of the separation between the two close images, then the\ndifference between their fluxes should approximately vanish, Rfold =\n(F1-F2)/(F1+F2) \\approx 0. Violations of this \"fold relation\" in observed\nlenses are thought to indicate the presence of structure on scales smaller than\nthe separation between the close images. We study the fold relation and find it\nto be more subtle and rich than was previously realized. The degree to which\nRfold can differ from zero for realistic smooth lenses depends not only on the\ndistance of the source from the caustic, but also on its location along the\ncaustic, and on the angular structure of the lens potential. Thus, it is\nimpossible to say from Rfold alone whether observed flux ratios are anomalous\nor not. Instead, we must consider the full distribution of Rfold values that\ncan be obtained from smooth potentials that reproduce the separation between\nthe two close images and the distance to the next nearest image.

The compact sizes (only a few pc) determined\nin recent high-resolution observations require that the obscuring matter be\nclumpy and located inside the region where the black-hole gravity dominates\nover the galactic bulge. This location is in line with the scenario depicting\nthe torus as the region of the clumpy wind coming off the accretion disk in\nwhich the clouds are dusty and optically thick. We study here the outflow\nscenario within the framework of hydromagnetic disk winds, incorporating the\ncloud properties determined from detailed modeling of the IR emission from\nclumpy tori. We find that torus clouds were likely detected in recent water\nmaser observations of NGC 3079.

Leo II clearly exhibits a lack of more\nmetal poor stars, in analogy to the classical G-dwarf problem, which may\nindicate a comparable `K-giant problem'.

Our HN yields based on the mixing-fallback model of explosions\nreproduce the observed abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars\n($-4< {\\rm [Fe/H]}< -3$), while those of very metal-poor (VMP) stars ($-3<{\\rm\n[Fe/H]} < -2$) are reproduced by the normal SN yields integrated over the\nSalpeter initial mass function. Moreover, the observed trends of abundance\nratios [X/Fe] against [Fe/H] with small dispersions for the EMP stars can be\nreproduced as a sequence resulting from the various combination of $M_{\\rm MS}$\nand $E$. This is because we adopt the empirical relation that a larger amount\nof Fe is ejected by more massive HNe. Our results imply that the observed\ntrends with small dispersions do not necessarily mean the rapid homogeneous\nmixing in the early galactic halo at [Fe/H] $< -3$, but can be reproduced by\nthe ``inhomogeneous'' chemical evolution model. In addition, we examine how the\nmodifications of the distributions of the electron mole fraction $Y_{\\rm e}$\nand the density in the presupernova models improve the agreement with\nobservations. In this connection, we discuss possible contributions of\nnucleosynthesis in the neutrino-driven wind and the accretion disk. \n\n"}

Parallax in a gravitational microlensing event observed\nonly from the Earth appears as a distortion of the lightcurve due to the motion\nof the Earth around the Sun. This distortion can be detected if the event\nduration is not much less than a year and if the projected velocity of the lens\nis not much larger than the orbital velocity of the Earth about the Sun. The\nevent presented here has a duration of 220 days and clearly shows the\ndistortion due to the Earth's motion. We find that the projected velocity of\nthe lens is 75+/-5 km/s at an angle of 28+/-4 deg from the direction of\nincreasing galactic longitude, as expected for a lens in the galactic disk.\n  A likelihood analysis yields estimates of the distance to and mass of the\nlens: D_{lens} = 1.7 (+1.1/-0.7) kpc and M = 1.3 (+1.3/-0.6) Msun, suggesting\nthat the lens is a remnant such as a white dwarf or neutron star.

The\nLF was computed on a near-infrared selected sample of galaxies which\nphotometry, complete down to the typical dwarf luminosity, is presented in a\ncompanion paper.

The shape of the\nComa LF in H band is quite similar to the one found in the B band and, with\nless confidence, to the R band LF as well. The similarity of the LF in the\noptical and H bands implies that in the central region of Coma there is no new\npopulation of galaxies which is too faint to be observed in the optical band\n(because dust enshrouded, for instance), down to the magnitudes of dwarfs. The\nexponential cut of the LF at the bright end is in good agreement with the one\nderived from shallower near-infrared samples of galaxies, both in clusters and\nin the field.

In\nthe first part of the paper, that expectation is confirmed by an estimate of\nthe finite temperature corrections and of the tunneling rate to the true\nvacuum, paying careful attention to the validity of the approximations that are\nused. The second part of the paper considers topological defects which may be\nproduced at the end of an era of thermal inflation.
