This agreement requires that the\ngalactic halo be of sufficient extent to maintain the galaxy at high curvature\nin the presence of the low-curvature cosmological background. If the galactic\nhalo and local environment in f(R) models do not have substantially deeper\npotentials than expected in LCDM, then cosmological field amplitudes |f_R| >\n10^{-6} will cause the galactic interior to evolve to low curvature during the\nacceleration epoch.

Though these equations have been studied in the classical\nmathematical literature, it appears that the physics community is largely\nunaware of the relevant formalism. Of particular importance is the fate of the\ninitial value problem. Under what circumstances do infinite order differential\nequations possess a well-defined initial value problem and how many initial\ndata are required? In this paper we study the initial value problem for\ninfinite order differential equations in the mathematical framework of the\nformal operator calculus, with analytic initial data. This formalism allows us\nto handle simultaneously a wide array of different nonlocal equations within a\nsingle framework and also admits a transparent physical interpretation.

After the\ndynamical generation of Dirac mass, two collective modes appear similar to the\ncase of ordinary NJL model, and the phase mode (phason), which corresponds to\nmajoron or pion at vanishing Majorana mass parameter(s), has an excitation\nmass. The mechanism of generation of phason as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson\nis examined by a mathematical manner, summarized into a theorem\n  (claims as the generalized Nambu-Goldstone theorem). The mass of phason is\nalso evaluated in a supersymmetric version of the NJL-type model, and phason\nmass takes the order of that of axion commonly accepted today. An\n$SU(2_{c})$-gauge model is constructed for the context of neutrino seesaw\nmechanism, and the Schwinger-Dyson equation of dynamical mass functions is\nexamined. Several physical implications such as decay modes of phason, a\nnon-linear sigma model for phason are given. It is proposed that the\nmethod/result of this paper can be applied to an understanding on the origin of\nthe Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. \n\n"}

Yet with this\nprogress, several unpalatable coincidences (perhaps even inconsistencies) have\nemerged along with the successful confirmation of expected features. One of\nthese is the observed equality of our gravitational horizon R_h(t_0) with the\ndistance ct_0 light has traveled since the big bang, in terms of the current\nage t_0 of the universe. This equality is very peculiar because it need not\nhave occurred at all and, if it did, should only have happened once (right now)\nin the context of LambdaCDM.

One such example is the signature of cosmic bubble\ncollisions which arise in models of eternal inflation. The most unambiguous way\nto test these scenarios is to evaluate the full posterior probability\ndistribution of the global parameters defining the theory; however, a direct\nevaluation is computationally impractical on large datasets, such as those\nobtained by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and Planck. A\nmethod to approximate the full posterior has been developed recently, which\nrequires as an input a set of candidate sources which are most likely to give\nthe largest contribution to the likelihood. In this article, we present an\nimproved algorithm for detecting candidate sources using optimal filters, and\napply it to detect candidate bubble collision signatures in WMAP 7-year\nobservations. We show both theoretically and through simulations that this\nalgorithm provides an enhancement in sensitivity over previous methods by a\nfactor of approximately two. Moreover, no other filter-based approach can\nprovide a superior enhancement of these signatures. Applying our algorithm to\nWMAP 7-year observations, we detect eight new candidate bubble collision\nsignatures for follow-up analysis. \n\n"}

The ideas\nfrom mathematics are resurgence theory, the trans-series framework, and\nBorel-Ecalle resummation. The ideas from QFT use continuity on R^1 x S^1_L,\ni.e, the absence of any phase transition as N \\to infinity, or rapid-crossovers\nfor finite-N, and the small-L weak coupling limit to render the semi-classical\nsector well-defined and calculable.

Perturbation theory possesses the\nIR-renormalon ambiguity that arises due to non-Borel summability of the\nlarge-orders perturbation series (of Gevrey-1 type), for which a microscopic\ncancellation mechanism was unknown.

Hence, the weak interactions\nemerge as the right handed chiral half of the space-time connection, which\nexplains the chirality of the weak interaction. This is possible, because, as\nshown by Plebanski, Ashtekar, and others, the other chiral half of the\nspace-time connection is enough to code the dynamics of the gravitational\ndegrees of freedom.\n  This unification is achieved within an extension of the Plebanski action\npreviously proposed by one of us. The theory has two phases.

The usual beta-function effects are\neasy to include, but by introducing spacetime-dependence of the various\nparameters of the theory one can efficiently incorporate renormalization\neffects of composite operators as well. An illustration of the power of these\nmethods was presented by Osborn in the early 90s, who used consistency\nconditions following from the Abelian nature of the Weyl group to rederive\nZamolodchikov's c-theorem in d=2 spacetime dimensions, and also to obtain a\nperturbative a-theorem in d=4.

These ambiguities are associated to choices of an integration\ncontour in the resummation of perturbation theory, along (singular) Stokes\ndirections in the complex Borel plane (rendering perturbative expansions\nnon-Borel summable along any Stokes line). More recently, it has been shown\nthat the proper framework to address these issues is that of resurgent analysis\nand transseries. In this context, the cancelation of all nonperturbative\nambiguities is shown to be a consequence of choosing the transseries median\nresummation as the appropriate family of unambiguous real solutions along the\ncoupling-constant real axis. While the median resummation is easily implemented\nfor one-parameter transseries, once one considers more general multi-parameter\ntransseries the procedure becomes highly dependent upon properly understanding\nStokes transitions in the complex Borel plane.

Traditionally, only stable NP saddle points\nare considered in QFT, and homotopy group considerations are used to classify\nthem. However, in many QFTs the relevant homotopy groups are trivial, and even\nwhen they are non-trivial they leave many NP saddle points undetected.\nResurgence provides a refined classification of NP-saddles, going beyond\nconventional topological considerations. To demonstrate some of these ideas, we\nstudy the $SU(N)$ principal chiral model (PCM), a two dimensional\nasymptotically free matrix field theory which has no instantons, because the\nrelevant homotopy group is trivial.

In this\npaper, we generalize the concept of butterfly velocity beyond the thermal case\nto a large class of other subspaces. Based on holographic duality, we consider\nthe code subspace of low energy excitations on a classical background geometry.\nUsing local reconstruction of bulk operators, we prove a general relation\nbetween the boundary butterfly velocities (of different operators) and the bulk\ncausal structure. Our result has implications in both directions of the\nbulk-boundary correspondence. Starting from a boundary theory with a given\nLieb-Robinson velocity, our result determines an upper bound of the bulk light\ncone starting from a given point. Starting from a bulk space-time geometry, the\nbutterfly velocity can be explicitly calculated for all operators that are the\nlocal reconstructions of bulk local operators.

We further prove that the butterfly velocity is equal to the\nspeed of light if the causal wedge of the boundary region coincides with its\nentanglement wedge.

As the name\nsuggests, the motivation was via the OS reconstruction theorem which allows to\nreconstruct the OS data from an OS measure satisfying (a subset of) the OS\naxioms, in particular reflection positivity. The guiding principle was to map\nthe usual Wilsonian path integral renormalisation flow onto a flow of the\ncorresponding OS data.\n  We showed that this induced flow on the OS data has an unwanted feature which\ndisqualifies the associated coarse grained Hamiltonians from being the\nprojections of a continuum Hamiltonian onto vectors in the coarse grained\nHilbert space.

Thus, albeit the classical\nbackground is 5-dimensional, the quantum theory (perturbatively) is\n4-dimensional. Our solution can be embedded in the supergravity context, where\nwe have completely localized supergravity on the corresponding solitonic brane,\nwhich is a BPS object preserving 1/2 of the original supersymmetries.
