In the discussion of\norientability, Hochschild homology is replaced by a twisted version which\navoids the dimension drop. The twisted Hochschild cycle representing an\norientation is related to the volume form of the distinguished covariant\ndifferential calculus. Integration over the volume form defines a twisted\ncyclic 2-cocycle which computes the q-winding numbers of quantum line bundles.\nSecond, a \"twisted\" Chern character from equivariant K0-theory to even twisted\ncyclic homology is introduced which gives rise to a Chern-Connes pairing\nbetween equivariant K0-theory and twisted cyclic cohomology. The Chern-Connes\npairing between the equivariant K0-group of the standard Podles sphere and the\ngenerators of twisted cyclic cohomology relative to the modular automorphism\nand its inverse are computed.

In particular we discuss the\ncase of SLE(kappa=6) describing the exploration path in critical percolation,\nand its relation with the question of operator content of the appropriate\nconformal field theory of zero central charge. In this case one encounters\nlogarithms in a probabilistically transparent way, through conditioning on a\ncrossing event. But we also observe that some quite natural SLE variants\nexhibit logarithmic behavior at all values of kappa, thus at all central\ncharges and not only at specific rational values. \n\n"}

The mathematical description of the orbit space\n$V/G$ depends on the integrity basis too: it is realized through polynomial\nequations and inequalities expressing rank and positive semi-definiteness\nconditions of the $P$-matrix, a real symmetric matrix determined by the\nintegrity basis. The choice of the basic set of $G$-invariant homogeneous\npolynomials forming an integrity basis is not unique, so it is not unique the\nmathematical description of the orbit space too. If $G$ is an irreducible\nfinite reflection group, Saito et al. in 1980 characterized some special basic\nsets of $G$-invariant homogeneous polynomials that they called {\\em flat}. They\nalso found explicitly the flat basic sets of invariant homogeneous polynomials\nof all the irreducible finite reflection groups except of the two largest\ngroups $E_7$ and $E_8$. In this paper the flat basic sets of invariant\nhomogeneous polynomials of $E_7$ and $E_8$ and the corresponding $P$-matrices\nare determined explicitly. Using the results here reported one is able to\ndetermine easily the $P$-matrices corresponding to any other integrity basis of\n$E_7$ or $E_8$. From the $P$-matrices one may then write down the equations and\ninequalities defining the orbit spaces of $E_7$ and $E_8$ relatively to a flat\nbasis or to any other integrity basis. The results here obtained may be\nemployed concretely to study analytically the symmetry breaking in all theories\nwhere the symmetry group is one of the finite reflection groups $E_7$ and $E_8$\nor one of the Lie groups $E_7$ and $E_8$ in their adjoint representations. \n\n"}

In a\nslightly different context (for a flow induced by an oscillating conservative\nbody force), the same equations had been derived earlier by Riley (2001). The\ngeneral theory is applied to two particular examples of steady streaming\ninduced by transverse vibrations of the walls in the form of standing and\ntravelling plane waves. In particular, in the case of waves travelling in the\nsame direction, the induced flow is plane-parallel and the Lagrangian velocity\nprofile can be computed analytically.

The extended Turaev-Viro TQFT provides a description\nof the excitations on top of the vacuum, which are essential to allow for a\nrepresentation of the holonomies and fluxes. These excitations agree with the\nones induced by massive and spinning particles, and therefore the framework\npresented here allows automatically for a description of the coupling of such\nmatter to (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a cosmological constant.

Within this framework, we\nprovide a quasi-particle description of these models, in which all states are\nexpressed solely in terms of the \\phi_{2,1}-modes. More precisely, we show that\nall the states can be written in terms of \\phi_{2,1}-type highest-weight states\nand their phi_{2,1}-descendants.

For the\nsimplest models (p=5,7), the full spectrum is explicitly reconstructed along\nthese lines. For $p$ odd, the commutation relations between the \\phi_{2,1}\nmodes take the form of infinite sums, i.e., of generalized commutation\nrelations akin to parafermionic models.

The latest, also called Carnot-Caratheodory or subriemannian\ndistance, is by definition the length of the shortest horizontal path between\npoints, that is to say the shortest path whose tangent vector is everywhere\nhorizontal with respect to the gauge connection. In noncommutative geometry all\nthe metric information is encoded within the Dirac operator D. In the classical\ncase, i.e. commutative, Connes's distance formula allows to extract from D the\ngeodesic distance on a riemannian spin manifold. In the case of a gauge theory\nwith a gauge field A, the geometry of the associated U(n)-vector bundle is\ndescribed by the covariant Dirac operator D+A.

It was expected that the noncommutative geometry\ndistance d defined by a covariant Dirac operator was intimately linked to the\nCarnot-Caratheodory distance dh defined by A.

We further show that both Lie algebras and\nquandles give solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation, and explain how\nconjugation plays a prominent role in the both the theories of Lie algebras and\nquandles. Inspired by these commonalities, we provide a novel, conceptual\npassage from Lie groups to Lie algebras using the language of quandles.\nMoreover, we propose relationships between higher Lie theory and\nhigher-dimensional braid theory.

The relation can be proved in both the relativistic and\nthe non-relativistic domain (in fact for any symmetry group including internal\nsymmetries) without quantum field theory, by the requirement that the exchange\ncan be implemented smoothly by a class of symmetry transformations that project\nin the phase space of the joint system. We discuss the interpretation of this\nrequirement, stressing the fact that any distinction of identical particles\ncomes solely from the choice of coordinates. We then examine our construction\nin the geometric and the coherent-state-path-integral quantisation schemes. In\nthe appendix we apply our results to exotic systems exhibiting continuous\n``spin'' and ``fractional statistics''. This gives novel and unusual forms of\nthe spin-statistics relation. \n\n"}

The first one is the most general quadratic\ncommutation relation. The corresponding nonzero minimal uncertainties in\nposition and momentum are determined and the effect on the energy spectrum and\neigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator in an electric field is studied. The\nsecond extension is a function-dependent generalization of the simplest\nquadratic commutation relation with only a nonzero minimal uncertainty in\nposition. Such an uncertainty now becomes dependent on the average position.\nWith each function-dependent commutation relation we associate a family of\npotentials whose spectrum can be exactly determined through supersymmetric\nquantum mechanical and shape invariance techniques. Some representations of the\ngeneralized Heisenberg algebras are proposed in terms of conventional position\nand momentum operators $x$, $p$. The resulting Hamiltonians contain a\ncontribution proportional to $p^4$ and their $p$-dependent terms may also be\nfunctions of $x$. The theory is illustrated by considering P\\\"oschl-Teller and\nMorse potentials. \n\n"}

For an analytic potential v, we show that\nthe resulting complex system admits a description in terms of the phase space\nR^4 equipped with an unconventional symplectic structure. This in turn allows\nfor the construction of an equivalent real description that is based on the\nconventional symplectic structure on R^4, and establishes the equivalence of\nthe complex extension of classical mechanics that is based on the\nabove-mentioned analytic continuation with the conventional classical\nmechanics. The equivalent real Hamiltonian turns out to be twice the real part\nof H, while the imaginary part of H plays the role of an independent integral\nof motion ensuring the integrability of the system. The equivalent real\ndescription proposed here is the classical analog of the equivalent Hermitian\ndescription of unitary quantum systems defined by complex, typically\nPT-symmetric, potentials. \n\n"}

In the D=3 and $\\beta=0$ case, the\nlatter reproduces Snyder algebra. The deformed Poincar\\'e transformations\nleaving the algebra invariant are identified. It is shown that there exists a\nnonzero minimal uncertainty in position (minimal length). The Dirac oscillator\nin a 1+1-dimensional space-time described by such an algebra is studied in the\ncase where $\\beta'=0$. Extending supersymmetric quantum mechanical and\nshape-invariance methods to energy-dependent Hamiltonians provides exact\nbound-state energies and wavefunctions. Physically acceptable states exist for\n$\\beta < 1/(m^2 c^2)$. A new interesting outcome is that, in contrast with the\nconventional Dirac oscillator, the energy spectrum is bounded. \n\n"}
