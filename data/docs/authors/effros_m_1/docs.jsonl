This paper considers the asymptotic\nbehavior of the SINR for a wide class of multidimensional signal models that\nincludes general multi-antenna as well as spread spectrum transmission models.\n  The expression of the deterministic approximation of the SINR in the large\ndimension regime is recalled and the SINR fluctuations around this\ndeterministic approximation are studied. These fluctuations are shown to\nconverge in distribution to the Gaussian law in the large dimension regime, and\ntheir variance is shown to decrease as the inverse of the signal dimension. \n\n"}

The transmitter nodes are assumed to send\npulse amplitude modulation (PAM) signals asynchronously, in which information\nsymbols are linearly modulated by a shaping waveform to be sent to the\ndestination. We consider two different cases with respect to the length of the\nshaping waveforms in the time domain. In the theoretical case where the shaping\nwaveforms with infinite time support are used, it is shown that asynchronism\ndoes not affect the DMT performance of the system and the same DMT as that of\nthe corresponding synchronous network is obtained for all the aforementioned\nprotocols. In the practical case where finite length shaping waveforms are\nused, it is shown that better diversity gains can be achieved at the expense of\nbandwidth expansion. In the decode-and-forward (DF) type protocols, the\nasynchronous network provides better diversity gains than those of the\ncorresponding synchronous network throughout the range of the multiplexing\ngain. In the amplify-and-forward (AF) type protocols, the asynchronous network\nprovides the same DMT as that of the corresponding synchronous counterpart\nunder the OAF protocol; however, a better diversity gain is achieved under the\nNAF protocol throughout the range of the multiplexing gain.

This paper considers the problem where\neach receiver knows its channels from all the transmitters and feeds back this\ninformation using a limited number of bits to all other terminals. In\nparticular, channel quantization over the composite Grassmann manifold is\nproposed and analyzed. It is shown, for $K$-user multiple-input,\nmultiple-output (MIMO) interference channels, that when the transmitters use an\ninterference alignment strategy as if the quantized channel estimates obtained\nvia this limited feedback are perfect, the full sum degrees of freedom of the\ninterference channel can be achieved as long as the feedback bit rate scales\nsufficiently fast with the signal-to-noise ratio.

Specifically, when the channel being simulated is\nnoiseless, this reduces to the zero-error capacity of the channel, assisted by\nthe various classes of non-signalling correlations.

The relay is\nassumed to operate over an orthogonal band with respect to the underlying IC,\nand the overall system is referred to as IC with an out-of-band relay (IC-OBR).\nThe system can be seen as operating over two parallel interference-limited\nchannels: The first is a standard Gaussian IC and the second is a Gaussian\nrelay channel characterized by two sources and destinations communicating\nthrough the relay without direct links. We refer to the second parallel channel\nas OBR Channel (OBRC). The main aim of this work is to identify conditions\nunder which optimal operation, in terms of the capacity region of the IC-OBR,\nentails either signal relaying and/or interference forwarding by the relay,\nwith either a separable or non-separable use of the two parallel channels, IC\nand OBRC. Here \"separable\" refers to transmission of independent information\nover the two constituent channels. For a basic model in which the OBRC consists\nof four orthogonal channels from sources to relay and from relay to\ndestinations (IC-OBR Type-I), a condition is identified under which signal\nrelaying and separable operation is optimal. When this condition is not\nsatisfied, various scenarios are identified in which interference forwarding\nand non-separable operation are necessary to achieve optimal performance. In\nthese scenarios, the system exploits the \"excess capacity\" on the OBRC via\ninterference forwarding to drive the IC-OBR system in specific interference\nregimes (strong or mixed). The analysis is then turned to a more complex\nIC-OBR, in which the OBRC consists of only two orthogonal channels, one from\nsources to relay and one from relay to destinations (IC-OBR Type-II). For this\nchannel, some capacity resuls are derived that parallel the conclusions for\nIC-OBR Type-I. \n\n"}

Hence, reducing the computational\ncomplexities of DFTs is of great significance, especially for long DFTs as\nincreasingly longer error control codes are chosen for digital communication\nand storage systems. Since DFTs involve both multiplications and additions over\nfinite fields and multiplications are much more complex than additions,\nrecently proposed cyclotomic fast Fourier transforms (CFFTs) are promising due\nto their low multiplicative complexity. Unfortunately, they have very high\nadditive complexity. Techniques such as common subexpression elimination (CSE)\ncan be used to reduce the additive complexity of CFFTs, but their effectiveness\nfor long DFTs is limited by their complexity. In this paper, we propose prime\nfactor cyclotomic Fourier transforms (PFCFTs), which use CFFTs as sub-DFTs via\nthe prime factor algorithm. When the length of DFTs is prime, our PFCFTs reduce\nto CFFTs. When the length has co-prime factors, since the sub-DFTs have much\nshorter lengths, this allows us to use CSE to significantly reduce their\nadditive complexity. In comparison to previously proposed fast Fourier\ntransforms, our PFCFTs achieve reduced overall complexity when the length of\nDFTs is at least 255, and the improvement significantly increases as the length\ngrows. This approach also enables us to propose efficient DFTs with very long\nlength (e.g., 4095-point), first efficient DFTs of such lengths in the\nliterature.

In the present work, a generalization of\nindex coding scheme, where transmitted symbols are subject to errors, is\nstudied. Error-correcting methods for such a scheme, and their parameters, are\ninvestigated. In particular, the following question is discussed: given the\nside information hypergraph of index coding scheme and the maximal number of\nerroneous symbols $\\delta$, what is the shortest length of a linear index code,\nsuch that every receiver is able to recover the required information? This\nquestion turns out to be a generalization of the problem of finding a\nshortest-length error-correcting code with a prescribed error-correcting\ncapability in the classical coding theory.

In this paper, we propose a\nnew stochastic-geometry model for a cellular network with multi-cell\ncooperation, which accounts for practical factors including the irregular\nlocations of base stations (BSs) and the resultant path-losses.

For a system with a large number of\ntransmitter-receiver pairs, computationally efficient alternatives are\nnecessary. The focus of this paper is hence on the design of such efficient\napproximation methods. In particular, by employing semidefinite relaxation\n(SDR) and first-order approximation techniques, we propose an efficient\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that provides high-quality\napproximate beamforming solutions via solving a sequence of convex\napproximation problems. The solution thus obtained is further shown to be a\nstationary point for the SDR of the original outage constrained beamforming\ndesign problem. {Furthermore}, we propose a distributed SCA algorithm where\neach transmitter optimizes its own beamformer using local CDI and information\nobtained from limited message exchange with the other transmitters. Our\nsimulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCA algorithm and its\ndistributed counterpart indeed converge, and near-optimal performance can be\nachieved for all the considered system utilities. \n\n"}

Recent work by\nAvestimehr et al. has approximated the capacity of this network up to an\nadditive gap. The communication scheme achieving this capacity approximation is\nbased on compress-and-forward, resulting in noise accumulation as the messages\ntraverse the network. As a consequence, the approximation gap increases\nlinearly with the network depth.\n  This paper develops a computation alignment strategy that can approach the\ncapacity of a class of layered, time-varying wireless relay networks up to an\napproximation gap that is independent of the network depth. This strategy is\nbased on the compute-and-forward framework, which enables relays to decode\ndeterministic functions of the transmitted messages. Alone, compute-and-forward\nis insufficient to approach the capacity as it incurs a penalty for\napproximating the wireless channel with complex-valued coefficients by a\nchannel with integer coefficients.

This task is\noften achieved by iteratively executing two operations: sparse coding and\ndictionary update. In the literature, there are two benchmark mechanisms to\nupdate a dictionary. The first approach, such as the MOD algorithm, is\ncharacterized by searching for the optimal codewords while fixing the sparse\ncoefficients.

We propose a novel\nframework that generalizes the aforementioned two methods. The unique feature\nof our approach is that one can update an arbitrary set of codewords and the\ncorresponding sparse coefficients simultaneously: when sparse coefficients are\nfixed, the underlying optimization problem is similar to that in the MOD\nalgorithm; when only one codeword is selected for update, it can be proved that\nthe proposed algorithm is equivalent to the K-SVD method; and more importantly,\nour method allows us to update all codewords and all sparse coefficients\nsimultaneously, hence the term simultaneous codeword optimization (SimCO).\nUnder the proposed framework, we design two algorithms, namely, primitive and\nregularized SimCO.

First, each transmitter is\nassumed to have a single antenna and serve a singe user in its user group where\neach user has receive antennas less than K. In this case, a K-transmitter\nsingle-input multiple-output (SIMO) interference channel (IC) is constituted\nafter user selection. Without help of multiuser diversity, K-1 interfering\nsignals cannot be perfectly removed at each user since the number of receive\nantennas is smaller than or equal to the number of interferers. Only with\nproper user selection, non-zero DoF per transmitter is achievable as the number\nof users increases.

The sufficient number of users for\nthe target DoF is derived. We also discuss how the optimal strategy of\nexploiting multiuser diversity can be realized by practical user selection\nschemes.

All nodes in the network are assumed to be oblivious to their\nforward channel gains; however, they have perfect information about their\nbackward channel gains. The focus of this paper is on simple, efficient, and\npractical relaying schemes to increase the expected-rate at the destination.\nFor this purpose, various combinations of relaying protocols and the broadcast\napproach (multi-layer coding) are proposed. For the decode-forward (DF)\nrelaying, the maximum finite-layer expected-rate as well as two upper-bounds on\nthe continuous-layer expected-rate are obtained. The main feature of the\nproposed DF scheme is that the layers being decoded at both relays are added\ncoherently at the destination although each relay has no information about the\nnumber of layers being successfully decoded by the other relay. It is proved\nthat the optimal coding scheme is transmitting uncorrelated signals via the\nrelays. Next, the maximum expected-rate of ON/OFF based amplify-forward (AF)\nrelaying is analytically derived. For further performance improvement, a hybrid\ndecode-amplify-forward (DAF) relaying strategy, adopting the broadcast approach\nat the source and relays, is proposed and its maximum throughput and maximum\nfinite-layer expected-rate are presented. Moreover, the maximum throughput and\nmaximum expected-rate in the compress-forward (CF) relaying adopting the\nbroadcast approach, using optimal quantizers and Wyner-Ziv compression at the\nrelays, are fully derived. All theoretical results are illustrated by numerical\nsimulations. As it turns out from the results, when the ratio of the relay\npower to the source power is high, the CF relaying outperforms DAF (and hence\noutperforms both DF and AF relaying); otherwise, DAF scheme is superior. \n\n"}

IFD constructs an\nensemble of non-parametric sub-grid field configurations from the combination\nof the data in computer memory, representing constraints on possible field\nconfigurations, and prior assumptions on the sub-grid field statistics. Each of\nthese field configurations can formally be evolved to a later moment since any\ndifferential operator of the dynamics can act on fields living in continuous\nspace. However, these virtually evolved fields need again a representation by\ndata in computer memory. The maximum entropy principle of information theory\nguides the construction of updated datasets via entropic matching, optimally\nrepresenting these field configurations at the later time. The field dynamics\nthereby become represented by a finite set of evolution equations for the data\nthat can be solved numerically. The sub-grid dynamics is treated within an\nauxiliary analytic consideration and the resulting scheme acts solely on the\ndata space. It should provide a more accurate description of the physical field\ndynamics than simulation schemes constructed ad-hoc, due to the more rigorous\naccounting of sub-grid physics and the space discretization process.\nAssimilation of measurement data into an IFD simulation is conceptually\nstraightforward since measurement and simulation data can just be merged. The\nIFD approach is illustrated using the example of a coarsely discretized\nrepresentation of a thermally excited classical Klein-Gordon field.

We show that if the MAC channel is modulo-additive,\nthen any error probability, and hence any error exponent, achievable by a\nlinear code for the corresponding single-user channel, is also achievable for\nthe MAC channel. Specifically, for an alphabet of prime cardinality, where\nlinear codes achieve the best known exponents in the single-user setting and\nthe optimal exponent above the critical rate, this performance carries over to\nthe MAC setting. At least at low rates, where expurgation is needed, our\napproach strictly improves performance over previous results, where expurgation\nwas used at most for one of the users. Even when the MAC channel is not\nadditive, it may be transformed into such a channel.

Specifically, we propose a message\npassing detection (MPD) algorithm which works with the real-valued matched\nfiltered received vector (whose signal term becomes ${\\bf H}^T{\\bf H}{\\bf x}$,\nwhere ${\\bf x}$ is the transmitted vector), and uses a Gaussian approximation\non the off-diagonal terms of the ${\\bf H}^T{\\bf H}$ matrix.

The CSI is estimated at the\nreceiver by training via a preamble, and fed back to the transmitter.

First, we consider the general scenario where the preamble length is\nallowed to vary dynamically.

OFDM\nsignaling can obviate the need for tight time synchronization among multiple\nsimultaneous transmissions in the uplink of PNC systems. However, OFDM PNC\nsystems are susceptible to phase drifts caused by residual carrier frequency\noffsets (CFOs). In the traditional OFDM system in which a receiver receives\nfrom only one transmitter, pilot tones are employed to aid phase tracking. In\nOFDM PNC systems, multiple transmitters transmit to a receiver, and these pilot\ntones must be shared among the multiple transmitters. This reduces the number\nof pilots that can be used by each transmitting node. Phase tracking in OFDM\nPNC is more challenging as a result. To overcome the degradation due to the\nreduced number of per-node pilots, this work supplements the pilots with the\nchannel information contained in the data. In particular, we propose to solve\nthe problems of phase tracking and channel decoding jointly.

Liang & Veeravalli (2004) showed that\nthe capacity of this discrete-time channel grows logarithmically with the SNR,\nwith a capacity pre-log equal to $1-{Q}/{N}$.

For initialization, it is assumed that an accurate knowledge of\nthe subspace in which $L_0$ lies is available. In recent works, Qiu et al\nproposed and analyzed a novel solution to this problem called recursive\nprojected compressed sensing or ReProCS. In this work, we relax one limiting\nassumption of Qiu et al's result. Their work required that the $L_t$'s be\nmutually independent over time. However this is not a practical assumption,\ne.g., in the video application, $L_t$ is the background image sequence and one\nwould expect it to be correlated over time. In this work we relax this and\nallow the $L_t$'s to follow an autoregressive model. We are able to show that\nunder mild assumptions and under a denseness assumption on the unestimated part\nof the changed subspace, with high probability (w.h.p.), ReProCS can exactly\nrecover the support set of $S_t$ at all times; the reconstruction errors of\nboth $S_t$ and $L_t$ are upper bounded by a time invariant and small value; and\nthe subspace recovery error decays to a small value within a finite delay of a\nsubspace change time. Because the last assumption depends on an algorithm\nestimate, this result cannot be interpreted as a correctness result but only a\nuseful step towards it. \n\n"}

In this paper, the UA communication techniques are\ndesigned and analyzed based on a geometric model. Specifically, the UA is\nmodeled as a continuous circular/spherical array enclosing target users and\nfree-space propagation is assumed. First, consider the estimation of multiuser\nUA channels induced by user locations. Given single pilot symbols, a novel\nchannel estimation scheme is proposed that decomposes training signals into\nFourier/Laplace series and thereby translates multiuser channel estimation into\npeak detection of a derive function of location. The process is shown to\nsuppress noise. Moreover, it is proved that estimation error due to\ninterference diminishes with the increasing minimum user-separation distance\nfollowing the power law, where the exponent is 1/3 and 1 for the circular and\nspherical UA, respectively. If orthogonal pilot sequences are used, channel\nestimation is found to be perfect. Next, consider channel-conjugate data\ntransmission that maximizes received signal power. The power of interference\nbetween two users is shown to decay with the increasing user-separation\ndistance sub-linearly and super-linearly for the circular and spherical UA,\nrespectively.

For example, in\ncompressed sensing with the standard (synthesis) sparsity prior and in matrix\ncompletion, the number of measurements needed is proportional (up to a\nlogarithmic factor) to the signal's manifold dimension.\n  Recently, a new natural low-dimensional signal model has been proposed: the\ncosparse analysis prior.

To improve the scalability of\nC-RAN networks, it is very important to take the fronthaul loading into\nconsideration in the signal detection, and it is very desirable to reduce the\nfronthaul loading in C-RAN systems.

The proposed algorithm allows the problem to be solved in\na distributed, asynchronous and incremental manner.

By exploiting channel reciprocity, a new two-phase channel\ntraining scheme is proposed to achieve the diversity and beamforming gains,\nrespectively. In the first phase, pilot signals are sent from the energy\nreceiver (ER) over a selected subset of the available frequency sub-bands,\nthrough which the ET determines a certain number of \"strongest\" sub-bands with\nlargest antenna sum-power gains and sends their indices to the ER.

Under the uplink\ncommunication setup, we propose a new \"spatial-compression-and-forward (SCF)\"\nscheme, where each RRH first performs a linear spatial filtering to denoise and\nmaximally compress its received signals from multiple users to a reduced number\nof dimensions, then conducts uniform scalar quantization over each of the\nresulting dimensions in parallel, and finally sends the total quantized bits to\nthe baseband unit (BBU) via a finite-rate fronthaul link for joint information\ndecoding. Under this scheme, we maximize the minimum\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of all users at the BBU by a\njoint resource allocation over the wireless transmission and fronthaul links.\nSpecifically, each RRH determines its own spatial filtering solution in a\ndistributed manner to reduce the signalling overhead with the BBU, while the\nBBU jointly optimizes the users' transmit power, the RRHs' fronthaul bits\nallocation, and the BBU's receive beamforming with fixed spatial filters at\nindividual RRHs.

Structured acquisition with blocks of\nmeasurements are easy to implement, and provide good reconstruction results in\npractice. However, very few results exist on the theoretical guarantees of CS\nreconstructions in this setting. In this paper, we derive new CS results for\nstructured acquisitions and signals satisfying a prior structured sparsity. The\nobtained results provide a recovery probability of sparse vectors that\nexplicitly depends on their support. Our results are thus support-dependent and\noffer the possibility for flexible assumptions on the sparsity structure.\nMoreover, the results are drawing-dependent, since we highlight an explicit\ndependency between the probability of reconstructing a sparse vector and the\nway of choosing the blocks of measurements. Numerical simulations show that the\nproposed theory is faithful to experimental observations. \n\n"}

By\ndefinition such a goal function, if universal, cannot be cast in\nprocessing-domain specific language (e.g. 'edge filtering', 'working memory').\nThus, to formulate such a principle, we have to use a domain-independent\nframework. Information theory offers such a framework. However, while the\nclassical framework of information theory focuses on the relation between one\ninput and one output (Shannon's mutual information), we argue that neural\ninformation processing crucially depends on the combination of\n\\textit{multiple} inputs to create the output of a processor.

To deal with the potentially\nexcessive interference originating from a plethora of geographically\ndistributed transmission sources, a pair of transmission protocols based on\ninterference alignment (IA) are conceived. The first, termed the full-IA,\navoids all intra-cell interference (ICI) and other-cell interference by finding\nthe perfect interference-nulling receive beamforming matrices (RxBFMs). The\nsecond protocol, termed partial-IA, only attempts to null the ICI. Employing\nthe RxBFMs computed by either of these protocols mathematically decomposes the\nchannel into a multiplicity of non-interfering multiple-input--single-output\nchannels, which we term as spatial multiplexing components (SMCs). The problem\nof finding the optimal SMCs as well as their power control variables for the\nESEM problem considered is formally defined and converted into a convex\noptimization form with carefully selected variable relaxations and\ntransformations. Thus, the optimal SMCs and power control variables can be\ndistributively computed using both the classic dual decomposition and\nsubgradient methods.

The basic\nidea of this work is to make use of the flexibility and scalability of the\nsystem such that more benefits can be gained by efficient resource management.\nThis motivates us to propose a flexible BS power consumption model, which can\ncontrol system resources, such as antennas, frequency carriers and transmit\npower allocation in an energy efficient manner rather than the \"on/off\" binary\nsleep mode for BSs. To denote these power-saving modes, we employ the group\nsparsity of the transmit power vector instead of the {0, 1} variables. Based on\nthis power model, a semi-dynamic green resource management mechanism is\nproposed, which can jointly solve a series of resource management problems,\nincluding BS association, frequency carriers (FCs) assignment, and the transmit\npower allocation, by group sparse power control based on the large scale fading\nvalues. In particular, the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based\nalgorithm is applied to solve a stationary solution to the original non-convex\nproblem.

However, densifying the network with a viral\ndeployment of SBSs can significantly increase energy consumption. To reduce the\nreliance on unsustainable energy sources, one can adopt self-powered SBSs that\nrely solely on energy harvesting. Due to the uncertainty of energy arrival and\nthe finite capacity of energy storage systems, self-powered SBSs must smartly\noptimize their ON and OFF schedule. In this paper, the problem of ON/OFF\nscheduling of self-powered SBSs is studied, in the presence of energy\nharvesting uncertainty with the goal of minimizing the operational costs\nconsisted of energy consumption and transmission delay of a network. For the\noriginal problem, we show an algorithm can solve the problem in the\nillustrative case. To reduce the complexity of the original problem, an\napproximation is proposed. To solve the approximated problem, a novel approach\nbased on the ski rental framework, a powerful online optimization tool, is\nproposed. Using this approach, each SBS can effectively decide on its ON/OFF\nschedule autonomously, without any prior information on future energy arrivals.\nBy using competitive analysis, a deterministic online algorithm (DOA) and a\nrandomized online algorithm (ROA) are developed. ROA is shown to achieve the\noptimal competitive ratio in the approximation problem.

The excess entropy of a stationary\nprocess is the summation of redundancies which relates to the rate of\nconvergence of the conditional entropy $H(X_n|X_{n-1},\\cdots, X_1)$ to the\nentropy rate. It is proved that the excess entropy is identical to the mutual\ninformation between the past and the future when the entropy $H(X_1)$ is\nfinite. We suggest the definition that a stationary process is long memory if\nthe excess entropy is infinite. Since the definition of excess entropy of a\nstationary process requires very weak moment condition on the distribution of\nthe process, it can be applied to processes whose distributions without bounded\nsecond moment.

In the\nproposed scheme, pilots are transmitted in partial overlap with data to\ndecrease the channel estimation overhead. The RS can detect the source data\nwith minimal destination pilot interference by exploiting the asymptotic\northogonality of massive MIMO channels. Then pilot-data interference can be\neffectively suppressed with assistance of the detected source data in the\ndestination channel estimation. Due to the transmission overlay, the effective\ndata period is extended, hence improving system throughput. Both theoretical\nand simulation results confirm that the proposed pilot-data overlay scheme\noutperforms the conventional separate pilot-data design in the limited\ncoherence time interval scenario. Moreover, asymptotic analyses at high and low\nSNR regions demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme regardless of\nthe coherence interval length. Because of simultaneous transmission, the proper\nallocation of source data transmission and relay data forwarding power can\nfurther improve the system performance.

This notion\nof ranking includes as special cases the identification of the top-k items and\nthe total ordering of the items. We first analyze a sequential ranking\nalgorithm that counts the number of comparisons won, and uses these counts to\ndecide whether to stop, or to compare another pair of items, chosen based on\nconfidence intervals specified by the data collected up to that point. We prove\nthat this algorithm succeeds in recovering the ranking using a number of\ncomparisons that is optimal up to logarithmic factors. This guarantee does not\nrequire any structural properties of the underlying pairwise probability\nmatrix, unlike a significant body of past work on pairwise ranking based on\nparametric models such as the Thurstone or Bradley-Terry-Luce models. It has\nbeen a long-standing open question as to whether or not imposing these\nparametric assumptions allows for improved ranking algorithms. For stochastic\ncomparison models, in which the pairwise probabilities are bounded away from\nzero, our second contribution is to resolve this issue by proving a lower bound\nfor parametric models. This shows, perhaps surprisingly, that these popular\nparametric modeling choices offer at most logarithmic gains for stochastic\ncomparisons. \n\n"}

Generally rate can be measured to the\ntransmission in the peak traffic times, i.e., this efficiency increases with\nthe decreasing of rate. In order to implement a coded caching scheme, each file\nin the library must be split in a certain number of packets. And this number\ndirectly reflects the complexity of a coded caching scheme, i.e., the\ncomplexity increases with the increasing of the packet number. However there\nexists a tradeoff between the rate and packet number. So it is meaningful to\ncharacterize this tradeoff and design the related Pareto-optimal coded caching\nschemes with respect to both parameters.\n  Recently, a new concept called placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed to\ncharacterize the coded caching scheme.

In parallel,\nthe huge degrees-of-freedom provided by the appealing massive Multiple-Input\nMultiple-Output (MIMO) necessitate the employment of inexpensive hardware,\nbeing more prone to hardware imperfections, in order to be a cost-efficient\ntechnology. Hence, in this work, we focus on a realistic massive Multiple-Input\nSingle-Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC) hampered by the inevitable hardware\nimpairments. We consider a general experimentally validated model of hardware\nimpairments, accounting for the presence of \\textit{multiplicative distortion}\ndue to phase noise, \\textit{additive distortion noise} and \\textit{thermal\nnoise amplification}. Under both scenarios with perfect and imperfect channel\nstate information at the transmitter (CSIT), we analyze the potential\nrobustness of RS to each separate hardware imperfection. We analytically assess\nthe sum-rate degradation due to hardware imperfections. Interestingly, in the\ncase of imperfect CSIT, we demonstrate that RS is a robust strategy for\nmultiuser MIMO in the presence of phase and amplified thermal noise, since its\nsum-rate does not saturate at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrary to\nconventional techniques. On the other hand, the additive impairments always\nlead to a sum-rate saturation at high SNR, even after the application of RS.\nHowever, RS still enhances the performance.

However, determining whether or not a particular\nsensor is evolved or designed to be accurate and efficient is difficult. This\narises partly from the functional constraints being at cross purposes and\npartly since quantifying the predictive performance of even in silico sensors\ncan require prohibitively long simulations. To circumvent these difficulties,\nwe develop expressions for the predictive accuracy and thermodynamic costs of\nthe broad class of conditionally Markovian sensors subject to unifilar hidden\nsemi-Markov (memoryful) environmental inputs. Predictive metrics include the\ninstantaneous memory and the mutual information between present sensor state\nand input future, while dissipative metrics include power consumption and the\nnonpredictive information rate. Success in deriving these formulae relies\nheavily on identifying the environment's causal states, the input's minimal\nsufficient statistics for prediction. Using these formulae, we study the\nsimplest nontrivial biological sensor model---that of a Hill molecule,\ncharacterized by the number of ligands that bind simultaneously, the sensor's\ncooperativity. When energetic rewards are proportional to total predictable\ninformation, the closest cooperativity that optimizes the total energy budget\ngenerally depends on the environment's past hysteretically. In this way, the\nsensor gains robustness to environmental fluctuations. Given the simplicity of\nthe Hill molecule, such hysteresis will likely be found in more complex\npredictive sensors as well. That is, adaptations that only locally optimize\nbiochemical parameters for prediction and dissipation can lead to sensors that\n\"remember\" the past environment. \n\n"}

This\narchitecture concatenates a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) with a\nstandard belief-propagation (BP) decoder. The standard BP decoder is used to\nestimate the coded bits, followed by a CNN to remove the estimation errors of\nthe BP decoder and obtain a more accurate estimation of the channel noise.\nIterating between BP and CNN will gradually improve the decoding SNR and hence\nresult in better decoding performance. To train a well-behaved CNN model, we\ndefine a new loss function which involves not only the accuracy of the noise\nestimation but also the normality test for the estimation errors, i.e., to\nmeasure how likely the estimation errors follow a Gaussian distribution. The\nintroduction of the normality test to the CNN training shapes the residual\nnoise distribution and further reduces the BER of the iterative decoding,\ncompared to using the standard quadratic loss function. We carry out extensive\nexperiments to analyze and verify the proposed framework. The iterative BP-CNN\ndecoder has better BER performance with lower complexity, is suitable for\nparallel implementation, does not rely on any specific channel model or\nencoding method, and is robust against training mismatches.

This\ntechnology allows secondary users to access currently idle spectral bands by\ndetecting and tracking the spectrum occupancy. The CR application revisits this\ntraditional task with specific and severe requirements in terms of spectrum\nsensing and detection performance, real-time processing, robustness to noise\nand more. Unfortunately, conventional methods do not satisfy these demands for\ntypical signals, that often have very high Nyquist rates.\n  Recently, several sampling methods have been proposed that exploit signals' a\npriori known structure to sample them below the Nyquist rate. Here, we review\nsome of these techniques and tie them to the task of spectrum sensing in the\ncontext of CR.

We consider the use of practical random linear network coding (RLNC)\nfor UAV multicasting, so that each GT is able to recover the file as long as it\nreceives a sufficiently large number of coded packets. However, the formulated\nUAV trajectory optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to be directly\nsolved.

That two such disparate discrete systems share important structural\nproperties suggests that yet other apparently unrelated discrete systems might\nshare the same properties, and certainly invites an explanation.\n  We demonstrate that this is inevitable for all discrete systems of components\nbuilt from tokens or symbols. Departing from existing work by embedding the\nConservation of Hartley-Shannon information (CoHSI) in a classical statistical\nmechanics framework, we identify two kinds of discrete system, heterogeneous\nand homogeneous. Heterogeneous systems contain components built from a unique\nalphabet of tokens and yield an implicit CoHSI distribution with a sharp\nunimodal peak asymptoting to a power-law. Homogeneous systems contain\ncomponents each built from just one kind of token unique to that component and\nyield a CoHSI distribution corresponding to Zipf's law.\n  This theory is applied to heterogeneous systems, (proteome, computer\nsoftware, music); homogeneous systems (language texts, abundance of the\nelements); and to systems in which both heterogeneous and homogeneous behaviour\nco-exist (word frequencies and word length frequencies in language texts).

We aim to characterize the capacity\nof this channel over a finite UAV communication period, subject to its maximum\nspeed constraint and an average transmit power constraint.

Abstract: We present nonasymptotic upper and lower bounds on the maximum coding rate\nachievable when transmitting short packets over a Rician memoryless\nblock-fading channel for a given requirement on the packet error probability.\nWe focus on the practically relevant scenario in which there is no \\emph{a\npriori} channel state information available at the transmitter and at the\nreceiver. An upper bound built upon the min-max converse is compared to two\nlower bounds: the first one relies on a noncoherent transmission strategy in\nwhich the fading channel is not estimated explicitly at the receiver; the\nsecond one employs pilot-assisted transmission (PAT) followed by\nmaximum-likelihood channel estimation and scaled mismatched nearest-neighbor\ndecoding at the receiver. Our bounds are tight enough to unveil the optimum\nnumber of diversity branches that a packet should span so that the energy per\nbit required to achieve a target packet error probability is minimized, for a\ngiven constraint on the code rate and the packet size. Furthermore, the bounds\nreveal that noncoherent transmission is more energy efficient than PAT, even\nwhen the number of pilot symbols and their power is optimized. For example, for\nthe case when a coded packet of $168$ symbols is transmitted using a channel\ncode of rate $0.48$ bits/channel use, over a block-fading channel with block\nsize equal to $8$ symbols, PAT requires an additional $1.2$ dB of energy per\ninformation bit to achieve a packet error probability of $10^{-3}$ compared to\na suitably designed noncoherent transmission scheme. Finally, we devise a PAT\nscheme based on punctured tail-biting quasi-cyclic codes and ordered statistics\ndecoding, whose performance are close ($1$ dB gap at $10^{-3}$ packet error\nprobability) to the ones predicted by our PAT lower bound. This shows that the\nPAT lower bound provides useful guidelines on the design of actual PAT schemes. \n\n"}

The encoding is performed\nin such a way that each client can retrieve its demanded message from its side\ninformation and the broadcast codeword. In general, in order to decode its\ndemanded message symbol, a receiver may have to observe the entire transmitted\ncodeword. Querying or downloading the codeword symbols might involve costs to a\nclient -- such as network utilization costs and storage requirements for the\nqueried symbols to perform decoding. In traditional index coding solutions,\nthis 'client aware' perspective is not considered during code design. As a\nresult, for these codes, the number of codeword symbols queried by a client per\ndecoded message symbol, which we refer to as 'locality', could be large. In\nthis paper, considering locality as a cost parameter, we view index coding as a\ntrade-off between the achievable broadcast rate (codeword length normalized by\nthe message length) and locality, where the objective is to minimize the\nbroadcast rate for a given value of locality and vice versa.

Using our\ngeneral framework, we provide a number of novel theoretical guarantees for\nhigh-dimensional self-exciting point processes that reflect the role played by\nthe underlying network structure and long-term memory. We also provide\nsimulations and real data examples to support our methodology and main results. \n\n"}

To\nenable multi-user transmissions, the base-station uses a cell-specific codebook\nof beamforming vectors over an initial beam alignment phase. Each user uses a\nuser-specific codebook of beamforming vectors to learn the top-P (where P >= 1)\nbeam pairs in terms of the observed SNR in a single-user setting. The top-P\nbeam indices along with their SNRs are fed back from each user and the\nbase-station leverages this information to generate beam weights for\nsimultaneous transmissions. A typical method to generate the beam weights is to\nuse only the best beam for each user and either steer energy along this beam,\nor to utilize this information to reduce multi-user interference. The other\nbeams are used as fall back options to address blockage or mobility. Such an\napproach completely discards information learned about the channel condition(s)\neven though each user feeds back this information. With this background, this\nwork develops an advanced directional precoding structure for simultaneous\ntransmissions at the cost of an additional marginal feedback overhead. This\nconstruction relies on three main innovations: 1) Additional feedback to allow\nthe base-station to reconstruct a rank-P approximation of the channel matrix\nbetween it and each user, 2) A zeroforcing structure that leverages this\ninformation to combat multi-user interference by remaining agnostic of the\nreceiver beam knowledge in the precoder design, and 3) A hybrid precoding\narchitecture that allows both amplitude and phase control at low-complexity and\ncost to allow the implementation of the zeroforcing structure. Numerical\nstudies show that the proposed scheme results in a significant sum rate\nperformance improvement over naive schemes even with a coarse initial beam\nalignment codebook. \n\n"}

Due to the large frequency\nseparation between Uplink (UL) and Downlink (DL), in FDD systems channel\nreciprocity does not hold. Hence, in order to provide DL channel state\ninformation to the Base Station (BS), closed-loop DL channel probing and\nChannel State Information (CSI) feedback is needed. In massive MIMO this incurs\ntypically a large training overhead. For example, in a typical configuration\nwith M = 200 BS antennas and fading coherence block of T = 200 symbols, the\nresulting rate penalty factor due to the DL training overhead, given by max{0,\n1 - M/T}, is close to 0. To reduce this overhead, we build upon the well-known\nfact that the Angular Scattering Function (ASF) of the user channels is\ninvariant over frequency intervals whose size is small with respect to the\ncarrier frequency (as in current FDD cellular standards). This allows to\nestimate the users' DL channel covariance matrix from UL pilots without\nadditional overhead. Based on this covariance information, we propose a novel\nsparsifying precoder in order to maximize the rank of the effective sparsified\nchannel matrix subject to the condition that each effective user channel has\nsparsity not larger than some desired DL pilot dimension T_{dl}, resulting in\nthe DL training overhead factor max{0, 1 - T_{dl} / T} and CSI feedback cost of\nT_{dl} pilot measurements. The optimization of the sparsifying precoder is\nformulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program, that can be efficiently solved.\nExtensive simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\napproach with respect to concurrent state-of-the-art schemes based on\ncompressed sensing or UL/DL dictionary learning. \n\n"}

While such a risk\nminimization strategy is very natural to learn binary output models, such as in\nclassification, its capacity to estimate a specific signal vector is largely\nunexplored. A major difficulty is that the hinge loss is just piecewise linear,\nso that its \"curvature energy\" is concentrated in a single point. This is\nsubstantially different from other popular loss functions considered in signal\nestimation, e.g., the square or logistic loss, which are at least locally\nstrongly convex.

Among\nthese GBSs, we denote available GBSs as the ones that do not serve any\nterrestrial users at the assigned resource block (RB) of the UAV, and occupied\nGBSs as the rest that are serving their respectively associated terrestrial\nusers in the same RB.

Based on the virtual\nchannel model, we present an architecture of reconfigurable mmWave MIMO with\nbeamspace hybrid analog-digital beamformers and reconfigurable antennas at both\nthe transmitter and the receiver. We show that employing reconfigurable\nantennas can provide throughput gain for the mmWave MIMO. We derive the\nexpression for the average throughput gain of using reconfigurable antennas in\nthe system, and further derive the expression for the outage throughput gain\nfor the scenarios where the channels are (quasi) static. Moreover, we propose a\nlow-complexity algorithm for reconfiguration state selection and beam\nselection. Our numerical results verify the derived expressions for the\nthroughput gains and demonstrate the near-optimal throughput performance of the\nproposed low-complexity algorithm. \n\n"}

The major\nresults are two innovative representations of the coverage probability, which\nmake the analysis of multi-antenna networks almost as tractable as the\nsingle-antenna case. One is expressed as an $\\ell_1$-induced norm of a Toeplitz\nmatrix, and the other is given in a finite sum form.

This measure quantifies the maximal gain of an adversary in\ninferring any (potentially random) function of a dataset from a release of the\ndata. The inferential capability of the adversary is, in turn, quantified by a\nclass of adversarial loss functions that we introduce as $\\alpha$-loss,\n$\\alpha\\in[1,\\infty]$. The choice of $\\alpha$ determines the specific\nadversarial action and ranges from refining a belief (about any function of the\ndata) for $\\alpha=1$ to guessing the most likely value for $\\alpha=\\infty$\nwhile refining the $\\alpha^{th}$ moment of the belief for $\\alpha$ in between.\nMaximal alpha-leakage then quantifies the adversarial gain under $\\alpha$-loss\nover all possible functions of the data. In particular, for the extremal values\nof $\\alpha=1$ and $\\alpha=\\infty$, maximal alpha-leakage simplifies to mutual\ninformation and maximal leakage, respectively. For $\\alpha\\in(1,\\infty)$ this\nmeasure is shown to be the Arimoto channel capacity of order $\\alpha$. We show\nthat maximal alpha-leakage satisfies data processing inequalities and a\nsub-additivity property thereby allowing for a weak composition result.\nBuilding upon these properties, we use maximal alpha-leakage as the privacy\nmeasure and study the problem of data publishing with privacy guarantees,\nwherein the utility of the released data is ensured via a hard distortion\nconstraint.

We show that under a hard distortion constraint, for\n$\\alpha>1$ the optimal mechanism is independent of $\\alpha$, and therefore, the\nresulting optimal tradeoff is the same for all values of $\\alpha>1$.

A natural\nextension is to the local recovery of a set of $t$ erased symbols. There have\nbeen several approaches proposed for the handling of multiple erasures. The\napproach considered here, is one of sequential recovery meaning that the $t$\nerased symbols are recovered in succession, each time contacting at most $r$\nother symbols for assistance in recovery. Under the constraint that each erased\nsymbol be recoverable by contacting at most $r$ other code symbols, this\napproach is the most general and hence offers maximum possible code rate. We\ncharacterize the maximum possible rate of an LRC with sequential recovery for\nany $r \\geq 3$ and $t$. We do this by first deriving an upper bound on code\nrate and then going on to construct a {\\em binary} code that achieves this\noptimal rate.

Furthermore in some cases we could also confirm the general\nexpectation that the approximation of order $k$, whose computational complexity\nis $O(N^{k+1})$ has an error that scales as $1/N^{k+1}$ with the size of the\nsystem. We discuss the relation between this approach and some recent\ndevelopments in the field. \n\n"}

Special attention is paid to the canonical\nrate-distortion function of a source word which returns the minimal Kolmogorov\ncomplexity of all distortion balls containing that word subject to a bound on\ntheir cardinality. This canonical rate-distortion function is related to the\nmore standard algorithmic rate-distortion function for the given distortion\nmeasure. Examples are given of list distortion, Hamming distortion, and\nEuclidean distortion. The algorithmic rate-distortion function can behave\ndifferently from Shannon's rate-distortion function. To this end, we show that\nthe canonical rate-distortion function can and does assume a wide class of\nshapes (unlike Shannon's); we relate low algorithmic mutual information to low\nKolmogorov complexity (and consequently suggest that certain aspects of the\nmutual information formulation of Shannon's rate-distortion function behave\ndifferently than would an analogous formulation using algorithmic mutual\ninformation); we explore the notion that low Kolmogorov complexity distortion\nballs containing a given word capture the interesting properties of that word\n(which is hard to formalize in Shannon's theory) and this suggests an approach\nto denoising; and, finally, we show that the different behavior of the\nrate-distortion curves of individual source words to some extent disappears\nafter averaging over the source words. \n\n"}

Specifically, it is assumed that there exists\na family of codes of length N and rate R=(1-\\epsilon)C (C is a capacity of a\nbinary symmetric channel), whose decoding probability decreases polynomially in\n1/N. It is shown that if the decoding probability decreases sufficiently fast,\nbut still only polynomially fast in 1/N, then there exists another such family\nof codes whose decoding error probability decreases exponentially fast in N.\nMoreover, if the decoding time complexity of the assumed family of codes is\npolynomial in N and 1/\\epsilon, then the decoding time complexity of the\npresented family is linear in N and polynomial in 1/\\epsilon. These codes are\ncompared to the recently presented codes of Barg and Zemor, ``Error Exponents\nof Expander Codes,'' IEEE Trans. Inform.

This paper proposes a method to\ncalculate the limit of the eigenvalue distribution of block matrices if the\nsize of the blocks tends to infinity. While it considers random matrices, it\ntakes an operator-valued free probability approach to achieve this goal. Using\nthis method, one derives a system of equations, which can be solved numerically\nto compute the desired eigenvalue distribution. The paper initially tackles the\nproblem for square block matrices, then extends the solution to rectangular\nblock matrices. Finally, it deals with Wishart type block matrices.
