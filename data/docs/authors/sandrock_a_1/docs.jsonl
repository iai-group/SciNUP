In this article, we study the performance of reactor and\nsuperbeam neutrino experiments in the presence of such non-standard\ninteractions (NSI). Due to interference between the standard and non-standard\namplitudes, sizeable effects are to be expected if the NSI parameters are close\nto their current upper limits. We derive approximate formulas for the relevant\noscillation probabilities including NSI, and show how the leading effects can\nbe understood intuitively even without any calculations. We will present a\nclassification of all possible NSI according to their impact on reactor and\nsuperbeam experiments, and it will turn out that these experiments are highly\ncomplementary in terms of their sensitivity to the non-standard parameters. The\nsecond part of the paper is devoted to detailed numerical simulations, which\nwill demonstrate how a standard oscillation fit of the mixing angle theta-13\nmay fail if experimental data is affected by NSI.

We investigate whether or not\nthese stars could have been as important in death as sources of energetic X-ray\nphotons as they were during their main sequence lives. Most massive stars are\nexpected to form in binaries, and an appreciable fraction of these (as much as\n~30%) will evolve into X-ray luminous (L_X~10^38 erg/s) high-mass X-ray\nbinaries (HMXBs).

PSR\nJ1741-2054, with period P=413ms, was detected in archival Parkes telescope data\nand subsequently has been detected at the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Its\nreceived flux varies greatly due to interstellar scintillation and it has a\nvery small dispersion measure of DM=4.7pc/cc, implying a distance of ~0.4kpc\nand possibly the smallest luminosity of any known radio pulsar. At this\ndistance, for isotropic emission, its gamma-ray luminosity above 0.1GeV\ncorresponds to 25% of the spin-down luminosity of dE/dt=9.4e33erg/s. The\ngamma-ray profile occupies 1/3 of pulse phase and has three closely-spaced\npeaks with the first peak lagging the radio pulse by delta=0.29P. We have also\nidentified a soft Swift source that is the likely X-ray counterpart. In many\nrespects PSR J1741-2054 resembles the Geminga pulsar. The second source, PSR\nJ2032+4127, was detected at the GBT. It has P=143ms, and its DM=115pc/cc\nsuggests a distance of ~3.6kpc, but we consider it likely that it is located\nwithin the Cyg OB2 stellar association at half that distance.

In this paper we revisit the question of\ngamma-ray light-curve formation in pulsars in order to ascertain the robustness\nof the \"two-pole caustic\" (TPC) and \"outer gap\" (OG) models based on the vacuum\nmagnetic field. We point out an inconsistency in the literature on the use of\nthe relativistic aberration formula, where in several works the vacuum field\nwas treated as known in the instantaneously corotating frame, rather than in\nthe laboratory frame. With the corrected formula, we find that the peaks in the\nlight curves predicted from the TPC model using the vacuum field are less\nsharp. The sharpness of the peaks in the OG model is less affected by this\nchange, but the range of magnetic inclination angles and viewing geometries\nresulting in double-peaked light curves is reduced. In a realistic\nmagnetosphere, the modification of field structure near the light cylinder due\nto plasma effects may change the shape of the polar cap and the location of the\nemission zones. We study the sensitivity of the light curves to different\nshapes of the polar cap for static and retarded vacuum dipole fields. In\nparticular, we consider polar caps traced by the last open field lines and\ncompare them to circular polar caps. We find that the TPC model is very\nsensitive to the shape of the polar cap, and a circular polar cap can lead to\nfour peaks of emission.

The most promising astrophysical\nscenarios involve cosmic ray sources that are clustered such that many fall\nwithin ~1 kpc of the Galactic Center. For example, we show that several hundred\nGalactic Center supernovae in the last million years plus a diffusion-hardened\nelectron spectrum may be consistent with present constraints on this emission.\nAlternatively, it could be due to a burst of activity probably associated with\nSagittarius A* occurring ~1 Myr ago and producing >10^51 erg in cosmic ray\nelectrons.

Conclusions:\nWhile in contrast to core-collapse supernovae neutrinos carry only a very small\nfraction of the energy produced in the thermonuclear supernova explosion, the\nSN Ia neutrino signal provides information that allows us to unambiguously\ndistinguish between different possible explosion scenarios. These studies will\nbecome feasible with the next generation of proposed neutrino observatories. \n\n"}

The emission site must be far from the\nhole and the jet relativistic, in order to avoid absorption of the photons. In\nextreme cases, rapid variability of the emission suggests that structures of\nlength-scale smaller than the gravitational radius of the central black hole\nare imprinted on the jet as it is launched, and modulate the radiation released\nafter it has been accelerated to high Lorentz factor. We propose a mechanism\nwhich can account for the acceleration of the jet, and for the rapid\nvariability of the radiation, based on the propagation characteristics of\nlarge-amplitude waves in charge-starved, polar jets. Using a two-fluid\n(electron-positron) description, we find the outflows exhibit a delayed\nacceleration phase, that starts at roughly 1pc, where the inertia associated\nwith the wave currents becomes important. The time-structure imprinted on the\njet at launch modulates photons produced by the accelerating jet provided the\npair multiplicity in the black-hole magnetosphere is sufficiently small,\nsuggesting that very rapid variability is confined to sources in which the\nelectromagnetic cascade in the black-hole magnetosphere is not prolific. \n\n"}

A\nsimple technique which allows to obtain high-quality photometric measurements\nwith 0.3-1 s time resolution using ordinary CCD is described in detail. Using\nthe test observations of nonvariable stars, we show that the atmospheric\nturbulence introduces no significant distortions into the measured light\ncurves. Therefore, the data obtained in this way are well suited for studying\nthe aperiodic variability of various objects.\n  The large amount of SS 433 optical light curve measurements obtained in this\nway allowed us to obtain the power spectra of its flux variability with a\nrecord sensitivity up to frequencies of ~0.5 Hz and to detect its break at\nfrequency =~2.4e-3 Hz. We suggest that this break in the power spectrum results\nfrom the smoothing of the optical flux variability due to a finite size of the\nemitting region.

To prevent the jets from penetrating through the\ncollapsing stellar core and escape with their energy, instead of forming the\nhot bubbles, the jets should be prevented from drilling a hole through the\nstar. This condition can be met if the jets' axis rapidly changes its\ndirection. This process of depositing jets' energy into the ambient medium is\ntermed the it penetrating jet feedback mechanism. The feedback exists in that\nthe neutron star (or a black hole) at the center of the core collapse supernova\nshuts off its own growth by exploding the star.

Due to the no-hair theorem,\nhowever, such spacetimes cannot be regular everywhere outside the event\nhorizons, if they are solutions to the Einstein field equations; they are often\ncharacterized by naked singularities or closed time-like loops in the regions\nof the spacetime that are accessible to an external observer. For observational\ntests of the no-hair theorem that involve phenomena in the vicinity of the\ncircular photon orbit or the innermost stable circular orbit around a black\nhole, these pathologies limit the applicability of the metrics only to compact\nobjects that do not spin rapidly.

Survey design and\n  catalogs Abstract: Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powerful tracers of star-forming\ngalaxies. We have defined a homogeneous subsample of 69 Swift GRB-selected\ngalaxies spanning a very wide redshift range. Special attention has been\ndevoted to making the sample optically unbiased through simple and well-defined\nselection criteria based on the high-energy properties of the bursts and their\npositions on the sky. Thanks to our extensive follow-up observations, this\nsample has now achieved a comparatively high degree of redshift completeness,\nand thus provides a legacy sample, useful for statistical studies of GRBs and\ntheir host galaxies. In this paper we present the survey design and summarize\nthe results of our observing program conducted at the ESO Very Large Telescope\n(VLT) aimed at obtaining the most basic properties of galaxies in this sample,\nincluding a catalog of R and Ks magnitudes and redshifts. We detect the host\ngalaxies for 80 % of the GRBs in the sample, although only 42 % have Ks-band\ndetections, which confirms that GRB-selected host galaxies are generally blue.\nThe sample is not uniformly blue, however, with two extremely red objects\ndetected. Moreover, galaxies hosting GRBs with no optical/NIR afterglows, whose\nidentification therefore relies on X-ray localizations, are significantly\nbrighter and redder than those with an optical/NIR afterglow. Our spectroscopic\ncampaign has resulted in 77 % now having redshift measurements, with a median\nredshift of 2.14 +- 0.18. TOUGH alone includes 17 detected z > 2 Swift GRB host\ngalaxies suitable for individual and statistical studies. Seven hosts have\ndetections of the Ly-alpha emission line and we can exclude an early indication\nthat Ly-alpha emission is ubiquitous among GRB hosts, but confirm that Ly-alpha\nis stronger in GRB-selected galaxies than in flux-limited samples of Lyman\nbreak galaxies. \n\n"}

For ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs), the mass transfer rate is\nexpected to be a strong function of orbital period, predicting persistent\nsources at short periods and transients at long periods. Aims. For 14 UCXBs\nincluding two candidates, we investigate the long-term variability and average\nluminosity with the purpose of learning how often a source can be expected to\nbe visible above a given luminosity, and we compare the derived luminosities\nwith the theoretical predictions. Methods. We use data from the RXTE All-Sky\nMonitor because of its long-term, unbiased observations. Many UCXBs are faint,\ni.e., they have a count rate at the noise level for most of the time. Still,\ninformation can be extracted from the data, either by using only reliable data\npoints or by combining the bright-end variability behavior with the\ntime-averaged luminosity. Results. Luminosity probability distributions show\nthe fraction of time that a source emits above a given luminosity. All UCXBs\nshow significant variability and relatively similar behavior, though the\ntime-averaged luminosity implies higher variability in systems with a period\nlonger than 40 min. Conclusions. There is no large difference in the\nstatistical luminosity behavior of what we usually call persistent and\ntransient sources. UCXBs with a period below ~30 min have a time-averaged\nbolometric luminosity that is in reasonable agreement with estimates based on\nthe theoretical mass transfer rate. Around 40 min the lower bound on the\ntime-averaged luminosity is similar to the luminosity based on the theoretical\nmass transfer rate, suggesting these sources are indeed faint when not\ndetected. Above 50 min some systems are much brighter than the theoretical mass\ntransfer rate predicts, unless these systems have helium burning donors or lose\nadditional angular momentum. \n\n"}

The jet points towards the latter\nlobe, which is difficult to explain in a standard way within the double-lobed\nradio source paradigm. Here, I propose to assume that the nucleus of J1211+743\nhas undergone a re-ignition of activity and its lobes, presumably both\noriginally of FR II type, represent an earlier active phase, while the jet\nrepresents the current one. The asymmetry of the lobes is a consequence of the\norientation of the source combined with an activity switch-off that occurred\nbetween two active periods. The relic lobe is on the near side with regard to\nthe observer, whereas the radiation from the far-side lobe arrives\nsignificantly later owing to its longer distance to the observer.

Based on these considerations and guided by the SEDs, we propose\na model in which turbulent plasma crosses a conical standing shock in the\nparsec-scale region of the jet. Here, the high-energy emission in the model is\nproduced by inverse Compton scattering of seed photons supplied by either\nnonthermal radiation from a Mach disk, thermal emission from hot dust, or (for\nX-rays) synchrotron radiation from plasma that crosses the standing shock. For\nthe two dates on which we fitted the model SED to the data, the model\ncorresponds very well to the observations at all bands except at X-ray\nenergies, where the spectrum is flatter than observed. \n\n"}

As an illustration of\nthe method we investigate massive vector (Proca) perturbations in the Kerr\nmetric, which do not appear to be separable in the standard Teukolsky\nformalism. Working in a perturbative scheme, we discuss two important effects\ninduced by rotation: a Zeeman-like shift of nonaxisymmetric quasinormal modes\nand bound states with different azimuthal number m, and the coupling between\naxial and polar modes with different multipolar index l. We explicitly compute\nthe perturbation equations up to second order in rotation, but in principle the\nmethod can be extended to any order. Working at first order in rotation we show\nthat polar and axial Proca modes can be computed by solving two decoupled sets\nof equations, and we derive a single master equation describing axial\nperturbations of spin s=0 and s=+-1. By extending the calculation to second\norder we can study the superradiant regime of Proca perturbations in a\nself-consistent way. For the first time we show that Proca fields around Kerr\nblack holes exhibit a superradiant instability, which is significantly stronger\nthan for massive scalar fields. Because of this instability, astrophysical\nobservations of spinning black holes provide the tightest upper limit on the\nmass of the photon: mv<4x10^-20 eV under our most conservative assumptions.\nSpin measurements for the largest black holes could reduce this bound to\nmv<10^-22 eV or lower. \n\n"}

Broad band spectral analysis Abstract: (Abridged) The simultaneous UV to X-rays/gamma rays data obtained during the\nmulti-wavelength XMM/INTEGRAL campaign on the Seyfert 1 Mrk 509 are used in\nthis paper and tested against physically motivated broad band models. Each\nobservation has been fitted with a realistic thermal comptonisation model for\nthe continuum emission. Prompted by the correlation between the UV and soft\nX-ray flux, we use a thermal comptonisation component for the soft X-ray\nexcess. The UV to X-rays/gamma-rays emission of Mrk 509 can be well fitted by\nthese components. The presence of a relatively hard high-energy spectrum points\nto the existence of a hot (kT~100 keV), optically-thin (tau~0.5) corona\nproducing the primary continuum. On the contrary, the soft X-ray component\nrequires a warm (kT~1 keV), optically-thick (tau~15) plasma. Estimates of the\namplification ratio for this warm plasma support a configuration close to the\n\"theoretical\" configuration of a slab corona above a passive disk. An\ninteresting consequence is the weak luminosity-dependence of its emission, a\npossible explanation of the roughly constant spectral shape of the soft X-ray\nexcess seen in AGNs. The temperature (~ 3 eV) and flux of the soft-photon field\nentering and cooling the warm plasma suggests that it covers the accretion disk\ndown to a transition radius $R_{tr}$ of 10-20 $R_g$. This plasma could be the\nwarm upper layer of the accretion disk. On the contrary the hot corona has a\nmore photon-starved geometry. The high temperature ($\\sim$ 100 eV) of the\nsoft-photon field entering and cooling it favors a localization of the hot\ncorona in the inner flow. This soft-photon field could be part of the\ncomptonised emission produced by the warm plasma. In this framework, the change\nin the geometry (i.e. $R_{tr}$) could explain most of the observed flux and\nspectral variability. \n\n"}

These AGN have highly variable X-ray light curves that contain\nfrequent, high peaks of emission. The averaged light curve of the peaks is\ndirectly measured from the time series, and it is shown that (i) peaks occur at\nthe same time, within the measurement uncertainties, at all X-ray energies, and\n(ii) there exists a substantial tail of excess emission at hard X-ray energies,\nwhich is delayed with respect to the time of the main peak, and is particularly\nprominent in Ark 564. Observation (i) rules out that the observed lags are\ncaused by Comptonization time delays and disfavors a simple model of\npropagating fluctuations on the accretion disk. Observation (ii) is consistent\nwith time lags caused by Compton-scattering reverberation from material a few\nthousand light-seconds from the primary X-ray source.

If the resulting\nsuper-Eddington accretion drives an outflow which thermalizes in the outgoing\nejecta, the supernova debris will be re-energized at a time when photons can\ndiffuse out efficiently. The resulting light curves are different and more\ndiverse than previous fallback supernova models which ignored the input of\naccretion power and produced short-lived, dim transients. The possible outcomes\nwhen fallback accretion power is significant include super-luminous (> 10^44\nergs / s) Type II events of both short and long durations, as well as luminous\nType I events from compact stars that may have experienced significant mass\nloss. Accretion power may unbind the remaining infalling material, causing a\nsudden decrease in the brightness of some long duration Type II events.

In these systems, the\ndominant tidal effects involve the excitation of gravity waves and their\ndissipation in the outer envelope of the star. We calculate the amplitude of\ntidally excited gravity waves in low-mass (0.3M_\\odot) helium-core (He) WDs as\na function of the tidal forcing frequency \\omega.

On average, F(\\omega) scales approximately as\n\\omega^6, and is several orders of magnitude smaller for He WDs than for CO\nWDs. We find that tidal torques can begin to synchronize the WD rotation when\nthe orbital period is less than about a hour, although a nearly constant\nasynchronization is maintained even at small periods.

Assuming a simple prescription for radiatively\ninefficient accretion at low Eddington ratios, we calculate the X-ray\nluminosity of these objects, and similarly estimate the radio luminosity from\nrelations found empirically for black holes accreting at low rates.

The extra\ncomponent is usually assumed to be due to absorbing gas lying within the host\ngalaxy of the GRB itself. There is an apparent correlation between the\nequivalent column density of hydrogen, N(H,intrinsic) (assuming it to be at the\nGRB redshift), and redshift, z, with the few z>6 GRBs showing the greatest\nintrinsic column densities. We investigate the N(H,intrinsic) - z relation\nusing a large sample of Swift GRBs, as well as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nquasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energy\ndistributions of the two highest redshift GRBs. Various possible sample biases\nand systematics that might produce such a correlation are considered, and we\nconclude that the correlation is very likely to be real. This may indicate\neither an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contribution\nfrom gas along the line-of-sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) or\nintervening absorbing clouds.

In some contexts, such the\nbreakout of a gamma-ray burst jet from a star, the outflow is heated to a high\ntemperature at a large optical depth. Eventually it becomes transparent and is\npushed to a higher Lorentz factor by a combination of the Lorentz force and\nradiation pressure. We obtain its profile, both inside and outside the fast\nmagnetosonic critical point, when the poloidal magnetic field is radial and\nmonopolar. Most of the energy flux is carried by the radiation field and the\ntoroidal magnetic field that is wound up close to the rapidly rotating engine.\nAlthough the entrained matter carries little energy, it couples the radiation\nfield to the magnetic field. Then the fast critical point is pushed inward from\ninfinity and, above a critical radiation intensity, the outflow is accelerated\nmainly by radiation pressure. We identify a distinct observational signature of\nthis hybrid outflow: a hardening of the radiation spectrum above the peak of\nthe seed photon distribution, driven by bulk Compton scattering. The\nnon-thermal spectrum -- obtained by a Monte Carlo method -- is most extended\nwhen the Lorentz force dominates the acceleration, and the seed photon beam is\nwider than the Lorentz cone of the MHD fluid. This effect is a generic feature\nof hot, magnetized outflows interacting with slower relativistic material. It\nmay explain why some GRB spectra appear to peak at photon energies above the\noriginal Amati et al. scaling. A companion paper addresses the case of jet\nbreakout, where diverging magnetic flux surfaces yield strong MHD acceleration\nover a wider range of Lorentz factor. \n\n"}

When a star is disrupted in a bound\norbit with moderate eccentricity instead of a parabolic orbit, the temporal\nbehavior of the resulting stellar debris changes qualitatively. The debris is\ninitially all bound, returning to pericenter in a short time ~ the original\nstellar orbital timescale. The resulting fallback rate can thus be much higher\nthan the Eddington rate. Furthermore if the star is disrupted close to the\nhole, in a regime where general relativity is important, the stellar and debris\norbits display general relativistic precession. Apsidal precession can make the\ndebris stream cross itself after several orbits, likely leading to fast debris\nenergy dissipation. If the star is disrupted in an inclined orbit around a\nspinning hole, nodal precession reduces the probability of self-intersection,\nand circularization may take many dynamical timescales, delaying the onset of\nflare activity. An examination of the particle dynamics suggests that\nquasi-periodic flares with short durations, produced when the center of the\ntidal stream passes pericenter, may occur in the early-time light curve. The\nlate-time light curve may still show power-law behavior which is generic to\ndisk accretion processes.

Both components vary in tandem, with each responsible for\nabout 50% of the total X-ray flux, implying that they are physically linked.

We compare lateral distributions of more than\n500 LOPES events with two recent and public Monte Carlo simulation codes, REAS\n3.11 and CoREAS (v 1.0). The absolute radio amplitudes predicted by REAS 3.11\nare in good agreement with the LOPES measurements. The amplitudes predicted by\nCoREAS are lower by a factor of two, and marginally compatible with the LOPES\nmeasurements within the systematic scale uncertainties. In contrast to any\nprevious versions of REAS, REAS 3.11 and CoREAS now reproduce the shape of the\nmeasured lateral distributions correctly. This reflects a remarkable progress\ncompared to the situation a few years ago, and it seems that the main processes\nfor the radio emission of air showers are now understood: The emission is\nmainly due to the geomagnetic deflection of the electrons and positrons in the\nshower.

The\nkey point is that the locus of emission of Hawking radiation is not the\nglobally defined event horizon. Rather the emission domain lies just outside a\ntimelike Marginal Outer Trapped Surface that is locally defined. The emission\ndomain is mainly located inside the event horizon. A spacelike singularity\nforms behind the event horizon, and most of the Hawking radiation ends up at\nthis singularity rather than at infinity. Whether any Hawking radiation reaches\ninfinity depends on the relation between the emission domain and the event\nhorizon. From the outside view, even if radiation is seen as always being\nemitted, the black hole never evaporates away, rather its mass and entropy\nasymptote to finite non-zero limits, and the event horizon always acts as a\nsink for matter and information.

Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to be excellent laboratories for determining\nthe equation of state (EoS) of cold dense matter. Their strong gravity suggests\nthat they can also be used to constrain gravity models. The mass and radius\n(M-R) of a NS both depend on the choice of EoS and gravity, meaning that NSs\ncannot be simultaneously good laboratories for both of these questions. A\nmeasurement of M-R would constrain the less well known physics input. The\nassumption that M-R measurements can be used to constrain EoS-presumes general\nrelativity (GR) is the ultimate model of gravity in the classical regime. We\ncalculate the radial profile of compactness and curvature (square root of the\nfull contraction of the Weyl tensor) within a NS and determine the domain not\nprobed by the Solar System tests of GR. We find that, except for a tiny sphere\nof radius less than a millimeter at the center, the curvature is several orders\nof magnitude above the values present in Solar System tests. The compactness is\nbeyond the solar surface value for r>10 m, and increases by 5 orders of\nmagnitude towards the surface. With the density being only an order of\nmagnitude higher than that probed by nuclear scattering experiments, our\nresults suggest that the employment of GR as the theory of gravity describing\nthe hydrostatic equilibrium of NSs is a rather remarkable extrapolation from\nthe regime of tested validity, as opposed to that of EoS models. Our larger\nignorance of gravity within NSs suggests that a measurement of M-R constrains\ngravity rather than EoS, and given that EoS has yet to be determined by nucleon\nscattering experiments, M-R measurements cannot tightly constrain the gravity\nmodels either. Near the surface the curvature and compactness attain their\nlargest values, while EoS in this region is fairly well known.

Assuming\nthat these emissions are caused by magnetic cycles similar to the sunspot\ncycle, we construct flux transport dynamo models of $1M_{\\odot}$ stars rotating\nwith different rotation periods. We first compute the differential rotation and\nthe meridional circulation inside these stars from a mean-field hydrodynamics\nmodel. Then these are substituted in our dynamo code to produce periodic\nsolutions. We find that the dimensionless amplitude $f_m$ of the toroidal flux\nthrough the star increases with decreasing rotation period. The observational\ndata can be matched if we assume the emissions to go as the power 3-4 of $f_m$.\nAssuming that the Babcock-Leighton mechanism saturates with increasing\nrotation, we can provide an explanation for the observed saturation of emission\nat low Rossby numbers.

Confirming the hadronic origin of the gamma-ray emission near\n100 MeV is then of the greatest importance. Our paper is focused on a global\nre-assessment of all available data and models of particle acceleration in W44,\nwith the goal of determining on a firm ground the hadronic and leptonic\ncontributions to the overall spectrum. We also present new gamma-ray and CO\nNANTEN2 data on W44, and compare them with recently published AGILE and Fermi\ndata. Our analysis strengthens previous studies and observations of the W44\ncomplex environment and provides new information for a more detailed modeling.\nIn particular, we determine that the average gas density of the regions\nemitting 100 MeV - 10 GeV gamma-rays is relatively high (n= 250 - 300 cm^-3).\nThe hadronic interpretation of the gamma-ray spectrum of W44 is viable, and\nsupported by strong evidence.

Background\nand contamination uncertainties present in the data of non-focusing\nobservatories result in lower sensitivity to IC emission and a greater chance\nof false detection. We present 266ks NuSTAR observations of the Bullet cluster,\ndetected from 3-30 keV. NuSTAR's unprecedented hard X-ray focusing capability\nlargely eliminates confusion between diffuse IC and point sources; however, at\nthe highest energies the background still dominates and must be well\nunderstood. To this end, we have developed a complete background model\nconstructed of physically inspired components constrained by extragalactic\nsurvey field observations, the specific parameters of which are derived locally\nfrom data in non-source regions of target observations.

In local regions near the\nheater the results are well described with the 1D code. The heater's region\nprojects onto the stellar surface forming a hot spot. There are two heat\npropagation regimes. In the first, conduction outflow regime (realized at heat\nrates $H_0 \\lesssim 10^{20}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ or temperatures\n$T_\\mathrm{h} \\lesssim 10^9$ K in the heater) the thermal surface emission of\nthe star depends on the heater's power and neutrino emission in the stellar\ncore. In the second, neutrino outflow regime ($H_0 \\gtrsim 10^{20}$ erg\ncm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ or $T_\\mathrm{h} \\gtrsim 10^9$ K) the surface thermal\nemission becomes independent of heater's power and the physics of the core.

Electrons from this region are depleted due to the wind and\nconsequently, energy transfer rate due to inverse Comptonization of low energy\nphotons are affected. Specifically, it becomes easier to cool this region and\nemerging spectrum is softened. Our main goal is to show spectral softening due\nto mass outflow in presence of Compton cooling. To achieve this, we modify\nRankine-Hugoniot relationships at the shock front when post-shock region\nsuffers mass loss due to winds and energy loss due to inverse Comptonization.\nWe solve two-temperature equations governing an accretion flow around a black\nhole which include Coulomb exchange between protons and electrons and other\nmajor radiative processes such as bremsstrahlung and thermal Comptonization. We\nthen compute emitted spectrum from this post-shock flow. We also show how\nlocation of standing shock which forms outer boundary of centrifugal barrier\nchanges with cooling. With an increase in disc accretion rate $(\\dot{m_d})$,\ncooling is enhanced and we find that the shock moves in towards the black hole.\nWith cooling, thermal pressure is reduced, and as a result, outflow rate is\ndecreased.

Generally, the empirical Band\nfunction is fit to the observed gamma-ray data and the fit parameters are used\nto infer which radiative mechanisms are at work in GRB outflows. In particular,\nthe distribution of the Band function's low-energy power law index, $\\alpha$,\nhas led to the so-called synchrotron \"line-of-death\" (LOD) which is a statement\nthat the distribution cannot be explained by the simplest of synchrotron models\nalone. As an alternatively fitting model, a combination of a blackbody in\naddition to the Band function is used, which in many cases provide a better or\nequally good fit. It has been suggested that such fits would be able to\nalleviate the LOD problem for synchrotron emission in GRBs. However, these\nconclusions rely on the Band function's ability to fit a synchrotron spectrum\nwithin the observed energy band. In order to investigate if this is the case,\nwe simulate synchrotron and synchrotron+blackbody spectra and fold them through\nthe instrumental response of the $Fermi$ Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM).

We selected and analysed a number of multi--peaked\nCGRO/BATSE GRBs and simulated similar time profiles, with the crucial\ndifference that we assumed exponentially distributed interpulse times, as is\nexpected for a memoryless stationary Poisson process.

This process then\nresults in an isotropic extragalactic gamma-ray emission contributing to the\nextragalactic gamma-ray background observed by the Fermi-LAT. Unfortunately\nthis emission has been difficult to constrain and thus presents an uncertain\nforeground to any attempts to extract potential dark matter signal. Recently,\nIceCube has detected high-energy isotropic neutrino flux which could be of an\nextragalactic origin. In general, neutrinos can be linked to gamma rays since\ncosmic-ray interactions produce neutral and charged pions where neutral pions\ndecay into gamma rays, while charged pions decay to give neutrinos. By assuming\nthat isotropic high-energy IceCube neutrinos are entirely produced by cosmic\nrays accelerated in accretion shocks during the process of structure formation,\nwe obtain the strongest constraint to the gamma-ray emission from large scale\nstructure formation (strong) shocks and find that they can make at best ~20% of\nthe extragalactic gamma-ray background, corresponding to neutrino flux with\nspectral index 2, or ~10% for spectral index 2.46. Since typical objects where\ncosmic rays are accelerated in accretion shocks are galaxy clusters, observed\nhigh-energy neutrino fluxes can then be used to determine the gamma-ray\nemission of a dominant cluster type and constrain acceleration efficiency, and\nthus probe the process of large scale structure formation. \n\n"}

Transverse\nmomentum spectra of baryons from RHIC ($\\sqrt(s)$=62 and 200 GeV) and from LHC\n($\\sqrt(s)$=0.9 and 7 TeV) have been considered. It is seen that the slope of\ndistributions at low $p_T$'s is changing with energy. The QGSM fit of these\nspectra gives the average transverse momenta which behave as $s^{0.06}$ that is\nsimilar to the previously observed behavior of $\\Lambda^0$ hyperon spectra. The\nchange in average transverse momenta that are slowly growing in VHE hadron\ninteractions at CR detectors cannot cause the \"knee\" in measured cosmic ray\nproton spectra. In addition, the available data on heavy quark hadron\nproduction from LHC-b at $\\sqrt{s}$=7 TeV were also studied. The preliminary\ndependence of hadron average transverse momenta on their masses at LHC energy\nis presented. The possible source of cosmic ray antiparticle-to-particle ratios\nthat are growing with energy was analyzed in the framework of QGSM, where the\ngrowing ratios are the result of local leading asymmetry between the production\nspectra of baryons and antibaryons in the kinematical region of proton target\nfragmentation.

The current experiments combine two different techniques, an array\nof surface detectors and fluorescence telescopes. The latter allow an almost\ncalorimetric measurement of the primary energy. Thus, hadron-initiated showers\ndetected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator\nfrom the surface array (usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance\nfrom the shower core S(r0)) with the primary energy. On the other hand, this\ncalibration is not feasible when searching for photon primaries since no high\nenergy photon has been unambiguously detected so far. Therefore, pure Monte\nCarlo parametrizations are used instead.\n  In this work, we present a new method to determine the primary energy of\nhadron-induced showers in a hybrid experiment based on a technique previously\ndeveloped for photon primaries. It consists on a set of calibration curves that\nrelate the surface energy estimator, S(r0), and the depth of maximum\ndevelopment of the shower, Xmax, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes.\nThen, the primary energy can be determined from pure surface information since\nS(r0) and the zenith angle of the incoming shower are only needed.

The early brightening can be observed when the observer is in the\ndirection of the hole created by the collision.

We find that 0.19% of\ncore-collapse supernova light curves can be observed with the collisional\nbrightening. Type Ibc supernova light curves are more likely to be brightened\nby the collision (0.53%) because of the high fraction of the progenitors being\nin binary systems and their proximity to the companion stars.

In contrast to\nindirect dark matter searches using positrons, antiprotons, or gamma-rays,\nwhich suffer from relatively high and uncertain astrophysical backgrounds,\nsearches with antideuterons benefit from very suppressed conventional\nbackgrounds, offering a potential breakthrough in unexplored phase space for\ndark matter.

The coalescence model of antideuteron production and the\ninfluence of antideuteron measurements at particle colliders are discussed.\nThis is followed by a review of the modeling of antideuteron propagation\nthrough the magnetic fields, plasma currents, and molecular material of our\nGalaxy, the solar system, the Earth's geomagnetic field, and the atmosphere.\nFinally, the three ongoing or planned experiments that are sensitive to\ncosmic-ray antideuterons, BESS, AMS-02, and GAPS, are detailed.

Abstract: We discuss the detection of gravitational-wave backgrounds in the context of\nBayesian inference and suggest a practical definition of what it means for a\nsignal to be considered stochastic---namely, that the Bayesian evidence favors\na stochastic signal model over a deterministic signal model. A signal can\nfurther be classified as Gaussian-stochastic if a Gaussian signal model is\nfavored. In our analysis we use Bayesian model selection to choose between\nseveral signal and noise models for simulated data consisting of uncorrelated\nGaussian detector noise plus a superposition of sinusoidal signals from an\nastrophysical population of gravitational-wave sources. For simplicity, we\nconsider co-located and co-aligned detectors with white detector noise, but the\nmethod can be extended to more realistic detector configurations and power\nspectra. The general trend we observe is that a deterministic model is favored\nfor small source numbers, a non-Gaussian stochastic model is preferred for\nintermediate source numbers, and a Gaussian stochastic model is preferred for\nlarge source numbers. However, there is very large variation between individual\nsignal realizations, leading to fuzzy boundaries between the three regimes.

We carefully assess for the\neffect of pile-up in our observations, where 4/19 observations have a pile-up\nfraction >10%, which we account for during spectral modeling with a convolution\nmodel. When fitted with a power-law model, the average photon index when the\nsource is at high luminosity (L_X>10^39 ergs s^-1) is Gamma=1.33+/-0.15.

An observer far from a star\nis most sensitive to the spherically-symmetric piece of this profile that\ndecays linearly with the inverse of the distance, the so-called scalar charge,\nwhich is related to the emission of dipolar radiation from compact binaries.\nThe presence of dipolar radiation has the potential to very strongly constrain\nextended theories of gravity. These facts may lead people to believe that\ngravitational theories with long-ranged scalar fields have already been\nconstrained strongly from binary pulsar observations. Here we challenge this\n\"lore\" by investigating the decoupling limit of Gauss-Bonnet gravity as an\nexample, in which the scalar field couples linearly to the Gauss-Bonnet density\nin the action. We prove a theorem that neutron stars in this theory cannot\npossess a scalar charge. Thus Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the strong binary\npulsar constraints on dipole radiation. We discuss the astrophysical systems\nyielding the best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity and related quadratic\ngravity theories. To achieve this we explicitly compute the scalar charge for\nslowly-rotating neutron stars in quadratic gravity theories. In generic case,\neither neutron star-binary or neutron star-black hole systems can be used to\nconstrain the theory, but Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the neutron star-binary\nconstraints. However, black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity do anchor scalar\ncharge. The best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity will thus come from black\nhole observations, for example via pulsar-black hole binaries.

Here it is shown that no single star of any mass\nand credible metallicity is likely to produce the observed GW signal.

It has also been proposed that the astrophysical\nneutrino signal comes from accelerators capable of producing cosmic rays of\nthese energies. Cosmic rays initiate cascades of secondary particles (air\nshowers) in the atmosphere and their masses are inferred from measurements of\nthe atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, Xmax, or the composition of shower\nparticles reaching the ground. Current measurements suffer from either low\nprecision, or a low duty cycle and a high energy threshold.

Within this framework, the heavier\nspecies is produced as a thermal relic in the early universe and decays to the\nlighter species over cosmological timescales. Consequently, the lighter species\nbecomes the DM which populates the universe today. We show that annihilation of\nthe lighter DM species with an enhanced cross-section, produced via such a\nnon-thermal mechanism, can explain the observed AMS-02 positron flux while\navoiding CMB constraints. The observed DM relic density can be correctly\nreproduced as well with simple s-wave annihilation cross-sections. We\ndemonstrate that the scenario is safe from CMB constraints on late-time energy\ndepositions during the cosmic \"dark ages\". Interestingly, structure formation\nconstraints force us to consider small mass splittings between the two dark\nmatter species. We explore possible cosmological and particle physics\nsignatures in a toy model that realizes this scenario. \n\n"}

Characteristics of the ejecta include large velocity gradients and\nthe presence of heavy $r$-process elements, which pose significant challenges\nto the accurate calculation of radiative opacities and radiation transport. For\nexample, these opacities include a dense forest of bound-bound features arising\nfrom near-neutral lanthanide and actinide elements.

The use of area-preserving line profiles produces\nfrequency-dependent opacities that are one to two orders of magnitude greater\nthan those obtained with the use of expansion opacities in the Sobolev\napproximation.

Therefore, we considered\nalso a short Suzaku observation, which caught NGC7582 in a Compton thick state.\nThis allows us to determine the underlying continuum and the amount of\nabsorption ($N_H \\sim~1.2\\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$). A wealth of emission lines\nare detected in the Chandra data, which allow us to map the structure of the\ncircum-nuclear emitters. The high resolution spectrum reveals that the soft\nX-ray emission originates in a hybrid gas, which is ionized in part by the\nstarforming activity and in part by the central AGN. The high resolution images\nconfirm that the emitting region is inhomogeneous and extends up to a few\nhundred pc from the nuclear source. The X-ray images are more extended in the\nlower energy lines (Ne and Mg) than in the higher energy lines (Si, Fe), where\nthe former are dominated by the collisionally ionised gas and the latter by the\nphotoionized AGN emission.

Recent studies propose a\nsuper-wind phase with a mass loss rate from 0.001 up to 1Msun/yr in the last\nmonths/years of the RSG life, although there is no observational constraint\nthat this external material is a steady-state outflow. Alternatively,\nobservations may be explained by the explosion of a RSG star inside its complex\natmosphere. Indeed, spatially resolved observations reveal that RSG stars have\nextended atmospheres, with the presence of downflows and upflows out to several\nRstar, even in a standard RSG like Betelgeuse. Mass loading in the region\nintermediate between star and wind can accommodate the 0.01Msun needed to\nexplain the observations of 2013fs.

Abstract: Long-duration, spectrally-soft Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are associated with\nType Ic Core Collapse (CC) Supernovae (SNe), and thus arise from the death of\nmassive stars. In the collapsar model, the jet launched by the central engine\nmust bore its way out of the progenitor star before it can produce a GRB. Most\nof these jets do not break out, and are instead \"choked\" inside the star, as\nthe central-engine activity time, $t_{\\rm e}$, is not long enough. Modelling\nthe long-soft GRB duration distribution assuming a power-law distribution for\ntheir central-engine activity times, $\\propto t_{\\rm e}^{-\\alpha}$ for $t_{\\rm\ne}>t_{\\rm b}$, we find a steep distribution ($\\alpha\\sim4$) and a typical GRB\njet breakout time of $t_{\\rm b}\\sim 60\\text{ s}$ in the star's frame. The\nlatter suggests the presence of a low-density, extended envelope surrounding\nthe progenitor star, similar to that previously inferred for low-luminosity\nGRBs.

Abstract: Elucidating the appropriate microscopic degrees of freedom within neutron\nstars remains an open question which impacts nuclear physics, particle physics\nand astrophysics.

In this paper a first\ncalculation of the role of the $d^*(2380)$ in neutron stars is performed, based\non a relativistic mean field description of the nucleonic degrees of freedom\nsupplemented by a free boson gas of $d^*(2380)$. The calculations indicate that\nthe $d^*(2380)$ would appear at densities around three times normal nuclear\nmatter saturation density, influencing the upper mass limit for a stable\nneutron star and the neutron and proton fractions. New possibilities for\nneutron star cooling mechanisms arising from the $d^*(2380)$ are also\npredicted. \n\n"}

Emission in the V and J bands\nrose more gradually than did the gamma-rays and soft X-rays, though all peaked\nat nearly the same time. Optical polarization measurements showed dramatic\nchanges during the flare, with a strong anti-correlation between optical flux\nand degree of polarization (which rose from ~ 3% to ~ 20%) during the declining\nphase of the flare.

We show that the\nfraction of systems reaching high eccentricities is enhanced relative to triple\nsystems, over a broader range of parameter space.

The\nsize of the dark-sector interaction cross sections must be sigma ~ 0.1-1 barn,\nmoderately larger than for Standard Model deuteron fusion, indicating a dark\nnuclear scale Lambda ~ O(100 MeV). Dark fusion firmly predicts constant sigma v\nbelow the characteristic velocities of galaxy clusters. Observations of the\ninner structure of galaxy groups with velocity dispersion of several hundred\nkilometer per second, of which a handful have been identified, could\ndifferentiate dark fusion from a dark photon model. \n\n"}

However, we find no correlation between the X-ray\nand UV flux over the available ~40 day monitoring, despite the presence of\nstrong X-ray variability and the variable part of the UV spectrum being\nconsistent with irradiation of a standard thin disc. This means either that the\nX-ray flux which irradiates the UV emitting outer disc does not correlate with\nthe X-ray flux in our line of sight and/or that another process drives the\nmajority of the UV variability. The former case may be due to changes in\ncoronal geometry, absorption or scattering between the corona and the disc. \n\n"}

The standard cure is to\nregularize by adding artificial diffusion. Besides introducing ad-hoc\nsmoothing, this has a significant negative impact on either computational cost\nor complexity and parallel scalings. We describe a new numerical algorithm for\nCR transport, with close parallels to two moment methods for radiative transfer\nunder the reduced speed of light approximation. It stably and robustly handles\nCR streaming without any artificial diffusion. It allows for both isotropic and\nfield-aligned CR streaming and diffusion, with arbitrary streaming and\ndiffusion coefficients. CR transport is handled explicitly, while source terms\nare handled implicitly. The overall time-step scales linearly with resolution\n(even when computing CR diffusion), and has a perfect parallel scaling. It is\ngiven by the standard Courant condition with respect to a constant maximum\nvelocity over the entire simulation domain. The computational cost is\ncomparable to that of solving the ideal MHD equation. We demonstrate the\naccuracy and stability of this new scheme with a wide variety of tests,\nincluding anisotropic streaming and diffusion tests, CR modified shocks, CR\ndriven blast waves, and CR transport in multi-phase media. The new algorithm\nopens doors to much more ambitious and hitherto intractable calculations of CR\nphysics in galaxies and galaxy clusters. It can also be applied to other\nphysical processes with similar mathematical structure, such as saturated,\nanisotropic heat conduction. \n\n"}

Possible\nloci of early-Universe $r$-process nucleosynthesis are the ejecta of either\nblack hole--neutron star or neutron star--neutron star binary mergers.

In one such\ntest that is currently employed for LIGO black-hole binary mergers, generic\ndeviations from relativity are represented by $N$ deformation parameters in a\ngeneralised waveform model; the Bayesian evidence for each of its $2^N$\ncombinatorial submodels is then combined into a posterior odds ratio for\nmodified gravity over relativity in a null-hypothesis test.

The outburst properties deduced from our\nsimulations suggest that, although the recurrent nova events observed in RS~Oph\nare due to a thermonuclear runaway at the white dwarf surface, these runaways\nare triggered by accretion disc instabilities. In quiescence, the disc builds\nup its mass and it is only during the disc-instability outburst that mass is\naccreted on to the white dwarf at rates comparable to or larger than the\nmass-transfer rate. For a mass-transfer rate in the range $10^{-8}$ to\n$10^{-7}~{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, the accretion rate and the mass accreted\nare sufficient to lead to a thermonuclear runaway during one of a series of a\nfew dwarf nova outbursts, barely visible in the optical, but easily detectable\nin X-rays.

We propose\nthat the formation of the dissipative structures in the jet is controlled by\nthe time variability of the accretion disc. We argue that the open magnetic\nfield lines through the black hole, which drive a strongly magnetized jet, may\nhave their polarity reversing over time-scales related to the growth of the\nmagneto-rotational dynamo in the disc. Consequently, the jet is characterized\nby an alternating toroidal field polarity along its propagation axis, i.e., it\nis a \"striped jet\". Magnetic reconnection in the current sheets that form\nbetween the stripes dissipates the alternating-field energy and thus powers\nfurther jet acceleration. Here, we consider a jet with a broad distribution of\nstripe widths $l>l_{\\rm min}$, above a dominant scale $l_{\\rm min}$. We find\nthat the bulk acceleration of the jet, driven by the annihilation of the\nstripes, is very gradual.

The quasi-simultaneous multi-frequency spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) is modelled with the conventional one-zone synchrotron\nself-Compton (SSC) model.

This is shown by comparing the\nneutrino emission properties of self-consistent, three-dimensional (3D) SN\nsimulations of a 15 M_sun progenitor without rotation as well as slow and fast\nrotation compatible with observational constraints. The explosion of the fast\nrotating model gives rise to long-lasting, massive polar accretion downflows\nwith stochastic time-variability, detectable e.g. by the IceCube Neutrino\nObservatory for any observer direction. While spectrograms of the neutrino\nevent rate of non-rotating SNe feature a well-known sharp peak due to SASI for\nobservers located in the proximity of the SASI plane, the corresponding\nspectrograms of rotating models show activity over a wide range of frequencies,\nmost notably above 200 Hz for rapid rotation. In addition, the Fourier power\nspectra of the event rate for rotating models exhibit a SASI peak with lower\npower than in non-rotating models.

We perform semi-analytical spectral fitting of the multi-wavelength\nemission to obtain estimates of the jet physical parameters, and find that the\nmulti-wavelength emission can be explained by either a proton synchrotron\nscenario or an electron inverse Compton scattering scenario. In the proton\nsynchrotron scenario, a strong magnetic field of $10-100$~G is required,\nimplying that the particle acceleration is likely driven by magnetic energy\ndissipation such as magnetic reconnection events. The inverse Compton scenario\nimplies a magnetic field of $0.1-1$~G. Thus the particle acceleration is likely\ndriven by the kinetic energy dissipation such as shocks. We also discuss the\nneutrino production in the context of single-zone and multi-zone models based\non the above two scenarios. We demonstrate that the variability and optical\npolarization signatures can be used to distinguish the two scenarios due to\ntheir drastically different magnetic field.

In the early Universe, decays of a long\nlived particle produce $B$ mesons and anti-mesons out of thermal equilibrium.\nThese mesons/anti-mesons then undergo CP violating oscillations before quickly\ndecaying into visible and dark sector particles.

In this\nscenario, the tail is formed when the group, initially moving to the\nsouth-west, reverses its radial velocity after crossing the apocenter, the ram\npressure ceases and the ram-pressure-displaced gas falls back toward the center\nof the group and overshoots it. Shortly after the apocenter passage, the\noptical galaxy, dark matter and gaseous core move in a north-east direction,\nwhile the displaced gas continues moving to the south-west. The \"sheath\" is\nexplained as being due to interaction of the re-infalling group with its own\ntail of stripped gas mixed with the Coma gas. In this scenario, the shock,\ndriven by the group before reaching the apocenter, has already detached from\nthe group and would be located close to the famous relic to the south-west of\nthe Coma cluster. \n\n"}

It is the main purpose of this\nwork to perform a detailed study of k2 which, for a given compactness\nparameter, encodes the entire sensitivity of the tidal polarizability to the\nEOS. In particular, we examine the role that the crustal component of the EOS\nplays in the determination of k2. A set of realistic models of the equation of\nstate that yield an accurate description of the properties of finite nuclei and\nsupport neutron stars of two solar masses is used. Given that the tidal\npolarizability scales as the fifth power of the compactness parameter, a\nuniversal relation exists among the tidal polarizability and the compactness\nparameter that is highly insensitive to the underlying EOS.

Therefore, the real black hole mass\naccretion rate in these sources may be significantly smaller than the Bondi\nvalue. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback may be responsible for decreasing\nblack hole accretion rate to values much smaller than Bondi rate.

Mergers,\nas well as stellar core-collapse events (type II SNe and long-duration GRBs)\nare accompanied by long-lived sub-relativistic components powered by\nradioactive decay of unstable elements produced in the explosion. It is\ntherefore interesting to explore whether short duration events also have ejecta\npowered by radioactivity (i.e. that are supernova-like).

Additionally, predictions from the SFH for\nsupernova type Ia rate densities tentatively suggests delay times of ~3 Gyr.

It is shown that within\ntheoretical uncertainties our previous (1994) dynamical/radiative parton\ndistributions are compatible with most recent data and still applicable within\nthe restricted accuracy margins of the presently available next-to-leading\norder calculations. Due to recent high precision measurements we also present\nan updated, more accurate, version of our (valence-like) dynamical input\ndistributions.

We show that for $\\Delta m^2 \\simeq (0.5 - 3) \\times\n10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ indicated by the Super-Kamiokande data and $\\sin^2 2\\theta_{13}\n\\aprle 0.2$, the oscillations of multi-GeV neutrinos in the subdominant\n$\\nu_{\\mu} \\leftrightarrow \\nu_e$ mode are enhanced by the MSW and parametric\nresonances. The parametric resonance, which occurs when the neutrinos cross the\ncore of the earth, dominates for $\\Delta m^2 \\simeq (1 - 2)\\times 10^{-3}$\neV$^2$, $\\sin^2 2\\theta_{13} \\aprle 0.06$. The resonance matter effects lead to\nan observable excess of the e-like events with a specific zenith angle\ndependence even for small $\\theta_{13}$.

We suppose that intense neutrino\nand antineutrino beams will become available in so-called neutrino factories.\nWe find that the most promising and statistically significant results can be\nobtained by studying nu_e ->nu_mu and \\bar{nu}_e-> \\bar{nu}_mu oscillations\nwhich lead to matter enhancements and suppressions of wrong sign muon rates. We\nshow the theta_13 ranges where matter effects could be observed as a function\nof the baseline. We discuss the scaling laws of rates, significances and\nsensitivities with the relevant mixing angles and experimental parameters. Our\nanalysis includes fluxes, event rates and statistical aspects so that the\nconclusions should be useful for the planning of experimental setups. We\ndiscuss the subleading Delta m^2_{21} effects in the case of the LMA MSW\nsolution of the solar problem, showing that they are small for L >= 7000 km.\nFor shorter baselines, Delta m^2_{21} effects can be relevant and their\ndependence on L offers a further handle for the determination of the\nCP-violation phase \\delta.
