But, as\nfar as rooted phylogenetic trees goes, these vectors can only separate\nnon-weighted binary trees, and therefore these dissimilarity measures are\nmetrics only on this class. In this paper we overcome this problem, by\nsplitting in a suitable way each path length between two taxa into two lengths.\nWe prove that the resulting splitted path lengths matrices single out arbitrary\nrooted phylogenetic trees with nested taxa and arcs weighted in the set of\npositive real numbers. This allows the definition of metrics on this general\nclass by comparing these matrices by means of metrics in spaces of real-valued\n$n\\times n$ matrices. We conclude this paper by establishing some basic facts\nabout the metrics for non-weighted phylogenetic trees defined in this way using\n$L^p$ metrics on these spaces of matrices. \n\n"}

Our experimental results from\ntwo-particle azimuthal correlations show a flattened away-side peak in central\nPb+Pb (Au+Au) collisions, only weakly depends on collision energy over the\nwhole investigated energy range - suggesting this effect originates from\nsources other than jet-medium interactions.

The first experiments on\nsearch for double beta decay in the late of 1940's and beginning of 1950's are\nconsidered. It is underlined that for the first time the 2$\\beta(2\\nu)$ decay\nhas been registered in geochemical experiment with $^{130}$Te in 1950. In\ndirect (counter) experiment this type of decay for the first time has been\nregistered in $^{82}$Se by Michael Moe's group in 1987. Now two neutrino double\nbeta decay has been recorded for 10 nuclei ($^{48}$Ca, $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se,\n$^{96}$Zr, $^{100}$Mo, $^{116}$Cd, $^{128}$Te, $^{130}$Te, $^{150}$Nd,\n$^{238}$U). In addition, the 2$\\beta(2\\nu)$ decay of $^{100}$Mo and $^{150}$Nd\nto the 0$^+_1$ excited state of the daughter nucleus has been observed and the\nECEC(2$\\nu$) process in $^{130}$Ba was observed too. As to neutrinoless double\nbeta decay (2$\\beta(0\\nu)$) this process has not yet been registered. In the\nreview results of the most sensitive experiments (Heidelberg-Moscow, IGEX,\nCUORICINO, NEMO-3) are discussed and conservative upper limits on effective\nMajorana neutrino mass and the coupling constant of the Majoron to the neutrino\nare established as $\\langle m_{\\nu} \\rangle < 0.75$ eV and $\\langle g_{ee}\n\\rangle < 1.9 \\cdot 10^{-4}$, respectively.\n  The next-generation experiments, where the mass of the isotopes being studied\nwill be as grand as 100 to 1000 kg, are discussed.

At present, perturbative QCD calculations of hard\nprobes in elementary nucleon-nucleon reactions can be consistently combined\nwith the effects of the nuclear medium up to $ {\\cal O}(\\alpha_s^3) $. While\nsuch accuracy is desirable but not necessary for leading particle tomography,\nit is absolutely essential for the new jet observables. With this motivation,\nwe present first results and predictions to $ {\\cal O}(\\alpha_s^3) $ for the\nrecent LHC lead-lead (Pb+Pb) run at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per\nnucleon-nucleon pair.

We\npoint to a suite of measurements that can help build a consistent picture of\nparton shower modification in heavy ion collisions at the LHC. \n\n"}

We prove that these functions also have to satisfy a flow on\nparameter (or moduli) space. Then we use Fourier analysis to provide computable\nconditions for stability and the moduli space flow. The final stability\nanalysis reduces to two discrete convolutions which can be interpreted to\nunderstand when the predator-prey system is stable and what factors enhance or\nprohibit stable oscillatory behaviour.

The emission of a keV\nsterile neutrino in a beta decay could show up as a small kink in the spectrum\nof the emitted beta particle. With this in view, we perform a careful\ncalculation of the Rhenium and Tritium beta spectra and estimate the size of\nthis perturbation by means of the dimensionless ratio R of the sterile neutrino\nto the active neutrino contributions. We comment on the possibility of\nsearching for sterile neutrino signatures in two experiments which are\ncurrently running at present, MARE and KATRIN, focused on the Rhenium 187 and\nTritium beta decays respectively. \n\n"}

LCT joins together a\nnumber of $NP$-complete cycle problems in graph theory. $NP$-completeness is\nthe kay factor insuring (by conjecture of Cook) the generation of endless\ndevelopments and great diversity around large cycles problems. Originated about\n60 years ago, the individuals (claims, propositions, lemmas, conjectures,\ntheorems, and so on) in LCT continually evolve and adapt to their environment\nby an iterative process from primitive beginnings to best possible theorems\nbased on inductive reasoning.

The first property is the approximate scaling\nrelation between proton and neutron high-momentum distributions weighted by\ntheir relative fractions in the nucleus. The second property is the inverse\nproportionality of the strength of the high-momentum distribution of protons\nand neutrons to the same relative fractions. Based on these two properties the\nhigh-momentum distribution function for asymmetric nuclei has been modeled and\ndemonstrated that it describes reasonably well the high-momentum\ncharacteristics of light nuclei. However, the most surprising result is\nobtained for neutron rich nuclei with large A, for which a substantial relative\nabundance of high-momentum protons as compared to neutrons is predicted. For\nexample, the model predicts that in Au the relative fraction of protons with\nmomenta above $k_{F} \\sim 260$~MeV/c is 50% more than that of neutrons.

It includes soft\nradiation from the primary hard partons, secondary multiple parton interactions\n(MPI), and factorization-violating effects. The invariant mass spectrum of the\nleading jet in $Z$+jet and $H$+jet events is directly sensitive to these\neffects, and we use a QCD factorization theorem to predict its dependence on\nthe jet radius $R$, jet $p_T$, jet rapidity, and partonic process for both the\nperturbative and nonperturbative components of primary soft radiation. We prove\nthat the nonperturbative contributions involve only odd powers of $R$, and the\nlinear $R$ term is universal for quark and gluon jets. The hadronization model\nin PYTHIA8 agrees well with these properties. The perturbative soft initial\nstate radiation (ISR) has a contribution that depends on the jet area in the\nsame way as the underlying event, but this degeneracy is broken by dependence\non the jet $p_T$. The size of this soft ISR contribution is proportional to the\ncolor state of the initial partons, yielding the same positive contribution for\n$gg\\to Hg$ and $gq\\to Zq$, but a negative interference contribution for $q\\bar\nq\\to Z g$.

Purpose: In this work,\nwe propose a theoretical framework to analyze properties of reaction products\nin TDHF calculations. Methods: TDHF calculation in three-dimensional Cartesian\ngrid representation combined with particle number projection method. Results:\nWe develop a theoretical framework to calculate expectation values of operators\nin the TDHF wave function after collision with the particle-number projection.\nTo show how our method works in practice, the method is applied to\n$^{24}$O+$^{16}$O collisions for two quantities, angular momentum and\nexcitation energy.

We sketch an approach to such computations, based upon a\nrainbow-ladder (RL) truncation of QCD's Dyson-Schwinger equations and\nexemplified via the pion's valence dressed-quark GPD, $H_\\pi^{\\rm v}(x,\\xi,t)$.\nOur analysis focuses primarily on $\\xi=0$, although we also capitalise on the\nsymmetry-preserving nature of the RL truncation by connecting $H_\\pi^{\\rm\nv}(x,\\xi=\\pm 1,t)$ with the pion's valence-quark parton distribution amplitude.\nWe explain that the impulse-approximation used hitherto to define the pion's\nvalence dressed-quark GPD is generally invalid owing to omission of\ncontributions from the gluons which bind dressed-quarks into the pion. A simple\ncorrection enables us to identify a practicable improvement to the\napproximation for $H_\\pi^{\\rm v}(x,0,t)$, expressed as the Radon transform of a\nsingle amplitude.

Such ropes are\nexpected to give more strange particles and baryons, which also has been\nsuggested as a signal for plasma formation. Overlapping strings can also be\nexpected in pp collisions, where usually no phase transition is expected. In\nparticular at the high LHC energies the expected density of strings is quite\nhigh.

Centrality classes are defined\nusing different event activity estimators, i.e. charged particle multiplicities\nmeasured in three disjunct pseudorapidity regions as well as the energy\nmeasured at beam rapidity (zero-degree). The procedures to determine the\ncentrality, quantified by the number of participants ($N_{\\rm part}$), or the\nnumber of nucleon-nucleon binary collisions ($N_{\\rm coll}$), are described. We\nshow that, in contrast to Pb-Pb collisions, in p-Pb collisions large\nmultiplicity fluctuations together with the small range of participants\navailable, generate a dynamical bias in centrality classes based on particle\nmultiplicity.

The existing background subtraction methods for these studies depend on\nseveral assumptions and independent measurements of the Fourier coefficients of\nthe combinatorial background.

To test the accuracy of these methods, a simple model is used to\nsimulate di-hadron and jet-hadron correlations with a combinatorial background\nsimilar to that observed in the data.

Also for neutral evolution, where species with\nexactly the same properties compete, variability in the growth rates plays a\ncrucial role.

On such a basis we perform analysis of\ncorrespondence of quantum properties of nuclei. We find: (1) Potential\n$V_{RMF}$ of the RMF theory for nucleons has the wave functions $f$ and $g$\nwith joint part $h$ coincident exactly with the nucleon wave function of DOS\nmodel with potential $V_{\\rm shell}$. But, a difference between $V_{RMF}$ and\n$V_{\\rm shell}$ is essential for any nucleus. (2) The nucleon wave functions\nand densities obtained by the DOS and RMF theories are essentially different.\nThe nucleon densities of the RMF theory contradict to knowledge about\ndistribution of the proton and neutron densities inside the nuclei obtained\nfrom experimental data. This indicates that $g$ and $f$ have no sense of the\nwave functions of quantum physics. But, $h$ provides proper description of\nquantum properties of nucleons inside the nucleus. (3) We calculate meson\nfunction $w^{0}$ and potential $V_{w}$ in RMF theory based on the found nucleon\ndensity. (4) $f$ and $g$ are not solutions of Dirac equation with $V_{w}$. If\nthe meson theory describes quantum properties of nucleus well, then a\ndifference between $V_{w}$ and $V_{RMF}$ should be as small as possible.

As a first example, we consider the jet\nfragmentation function, where a hadron $h$ is identified inside a fully\nreconstructed jet. We introduce a new semi-inclusive fragmenting jet function\n${\\mathcal G}^h_i(z= \\omega_J/\\omega,z_h=\\omega_h/\\omega_J,\\omega_J, R,\\mu)$,\nwhich depends on the jet radius $R$ and the large light-cone momenta of the\nparton `$i$' initiating the jet ($\\omega$), the jet ($\\omega_J$), and the\nhadron $h$ ($\\omega_h$). The jet fragmentation function can then be expressed\nas a semi-inclusive observable, in the spirit of actual experimental\nmeasurements, rather than as an exclusive one. We demonstrate the consistency\nof the effective field theory treatment and standard perturbative QCD\ncalculations of this observable at next-to-leading order (NLO). The\nrenormalization group (RG) equation for the semi-inclusive fragmenting jet\nfunction ${\\mathcal G}_i^h(z,z_h, \\omega_J, R,\\mu)$ are also derived and shown\nto follow exactly the usual timelike DGLAP evolution equations for\nfragmentation functions.

The small-angle capability of the new Super High Momentum Spectrometer\n(SHMS) in Hall C, coupled with its high momentum reach - up to the anticipated\n11-GeV beam energy in Hall C - and coincidence capability with the\nwell-understood High Momentum Spectrometer, will allow for probes of such\nhadron structure involving strangeness down to the smallest distance scales to\ndate. To cleanly select the kaons, a threshold aerogel Cerenkov detector has\nbeen constructed for the SHMS. The detector consists of an aerogel tray\nfollowed by a diffusion box.

Quite recently, a sudden decrease in the excitation\nenergy of the $\\gamma$ vibration was observed at RIKEN RIBF for the\nneutron-rich Dy isotopes at $N=106$.

Rupert Riedl, for\nexample, an early pioneer of evolutionary developmental biology, suggested that\nthe evolution of complex adaptations is facilitated by a developmental\norganization that is itself shaped by past selection to facilitate evolutionary\ninnovation. However, selection for characteristics that enable future\ninnovation seems paradoxical: natural selection cannot favor structures for\nbenefits they have not yet produced, and favoring characteristics for benefits\nthat have already been produced does not constitute future innovation. Here we\nresolve this paradox by exploiting a formal equivalence between the evolution\nof evolvability and learning systems. We use the conditions that enable simple\nlearning systems to generalize, i.e., to use past experience to improve\nperformance on previously unseen, future test cases, to demonstrate conditions\nwhere natural selection can systematically favor developmental organizations\nthat benefit future evolvability. Using numerical simulations of evolution on\nhighly epistatic fitness landscapes, we illustrate how the structure of evolved\ngene regulation networks can result in increased evolvability capable of\navoiding local fitness peaks and discovering higher fitness phenotypes. Our\nfindings support Riedl's intuition: Developmental organizations that \"mimic\"\nthe organization of constraints on phenotypes can be favored by short-term\nselection and also facilitate future innovation. Importantly, the conditions\nthat enable the evolution of such surprising evolvability follow from the same\nnon-mysterious conditions that permit generalization in learning systems. \n\n"}

As the number of weakened people\nincreases, they eventually can become infected in a short time period and a\npandemic outbreak occurs. The time required to reach such a pandemic outbreak\nallows for intervention and is often called golden time.

These factorization breaking effects arise from soft color\nexchanges between charm-anticharm pairs undergoing hadronization and comoving\npartons that are long-lived on time scales of quarkonium formation. We compute\nthe short distance pair production of heavy quarks in the Color Glass\nCondensate (CGC) effective field theory and employ an improved Color\nEvaporation model (ICEM) to describe their hadronization into quarkonium at\nlarge distances.

Existing models for collective motion typically fail\nto incorporate the discrete, stochastic, and internal-state-dependent aspects\nof behavior, while models focusing on individual animal behavior typically\nignore the spatial aspects of the problem.

We thus consider a functional\nobtained from the density matrix expansion of local nuclear potentials from\nchiral effective field theory. We propose a parametrization of this functional\ncarefully calibrated and validated on selected ground-state properties that is\nsuitable for large-scale calculations of nuclear properties. The first\ncomponent of this functional is a non-local functional of the density and\ncorresponds to the direct part (Hartree term) of the expectation value of local\nchiral potentials on a Slater determinant. A second component is a local\nfunctional of the density and is obtained by applying the density matrix\nexpansion to the exchange part (Fock term) of the expectation value of the\nlocal chiral potential. We apply the UNEDF2 optimization protocol to determine\nthe coupling constants of this energy functional. We obtain a set of\nmicroscopically-constrained functionals for local chiral potentials from\nleading-order up to next-to-next-to-leading order with and without three-body\nforces and contributions from $\\Delta$ excitations. These functionals are\nvalidated on the calculation of nuclear and neutron matter, nuclear mass\ntables, single-particle shell structure in closed-shell nuclei and the fission\nbarrier of $^{240}$Pu.

This assumption neglects important information\ncarried by inter-personal social ties such as genetic similarity, geographic\nproximity, and social closeness, which may crucially affect the outcome of\ninteractions. To model these situations, we present a framework of evolutionary\nmultiplayer games on graphs with edge diversity, where different types of edges\ndescribe diverse social ties. Strategic behaviors together with social ties\ndetermine the resulting payoffs of interactants.

The magnitude of the slope is expected to be sensitive to\nthe magnitude of the tilt and the charm quark drag coefficient in the medium.\nIt has also been predicted that the transient electromagnetic field generated\nat early time can induce a much larger directed flow for heavy quarks than for\nlight quarks. In these proceedings, we will report on the first measurement of\nthe directed flow for the $D^0$ and $\\bar{D}^0$ mesons as a function of\nrapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}$ = 200 GeV using high\nstatistics data collected with the Heavy Flavor Tracker in 2014 and 2016 RHIC\nruns. \n\n"}

This\nstraightforward mounting results in three important improvements: (1) it\ndecreases the amount of non-active materials needed to assemble the detector,\n(2) it substantially increases the light collection efficiency by minimizing\nthe light losses induced by the mounting structure, and (3) it enhances the\nthermal signal induced in the light detector thanks to the extremely weak\nthermal link to the thermal bath. We tested this new technique with a 16 cm$^2$\nGe light detector with thermistor readout sitting on the surface of a large\nTeO$_2$ bolometer. The light collection efficiency was increased by greater\nthan 50\\% compared to previously tested alternative mountings.

Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the parity doublet structure seen in the\nspectrum of highly excited baryons may be due to effective chiral symmetry\nrestoration for these states. We review the recent developments in this field.\nWe demonstrate with a simple quantum-mechanical example that it is a very\nnatural property of quantum systems that a symmetry breaking effect which is\nimportant for the low-lying spectrum of the system, can become unimportant for\nthe highly-lying states; the highly lying states reveal a multiplet structure\nof nearly degenerate states. Using the well established concepts of\nquark-hadron duality, asymptotic freedom in QCD and validity of the operator\nproduct expansion in QCD we show that the spectral densities obtained with the\nlocal currents that are connected to each other via chiral transformations,\nvery high in the spectrum must coincide. Hence effects of spontaneous breaking\nof chiral symmetry in QCD vacuum that are crucially important for the low-lying\nspectra, become irrelevant for the highly-lying states. Then to the extent that\nidentifiable hadronic resonances still exist in the continuum spectrum at high\nexcitations this implies that the highly excited hadrons must fall into\nmultiplets associated with the representations of the chiral group.

Such a\ntrigger strongly reduces the effective impact parameters as compared to minimum\nbias events. This happens because the transverse spatial distribution of hard\npartons (x >~ 10^{-2}) in the proton is considerably narrower than that of soft\npartons, whose collisions dominate the total cross section. In the central\ncollisions selected by the trigger, most of the partons with x >~ 10^{-2}\ninteract with a gluon field whose strength rapidly increases with energy. At\nLHC (and to some extent already at Tevatron) energies the strength of this\ninteraction approaches the unitarity ('black-body') limit. This leads to\nspecific modifications of the final state, such as a higher probability of\nmultijet events at small rapidities, a strong increase of the transverse\nmomenta and depletion of the longitudinal momenta at large rapidities, and the\nappearance of long-range correlations in rapidity between the forward/backward\nfragmentation regions.

The most\nimportant result so far is the observation of the suppression of high p$_T$\nhadrons in central Au-Au collisions followed by the subsequent null experiment\nwhere the same suppression was not seen in deuteron-Au collisions. The observed\nsuppression is a final state effect in which a large amount of energy is lost\nby the fast parton as it penetrates the medium. This observation, together with\nmeasurements of the elliptic flow, leads to the conclusion that the energy\ndensity reached is at least 10 times that of a normal nucleon.

We show that in the nonrelativistic limit both\n$J_a^\\mu$ and ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ tend to the probability current density for the\nlocalization of a nonrelativistic free particle in space, but that unlike\n$J_a^\\mu$ the current density ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ is neither covariant nor\nconserved. Because the total probability may be obtained by integrating either\nof these two current densities over the whole space, the conservation of the\ntotal probability may be viewed as a consequence of the local conservation of\n$J_a^\\mu$. The latter is a manifestation of a previously unnoticed global gauge\nsymmetry of the Klein-Gordon fields. The corresponding gauge group is U(1) if\nthe parameter $a$ is rational. It is the multiplicative group of positive real\nnumbers if $a$ is irrational. We also discuss an extension of our results to\nKlein-Gordon fields minimally coupled to an electromagnetic field. \n\n"}
