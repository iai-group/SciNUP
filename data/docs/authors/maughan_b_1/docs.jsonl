Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The third method, the 3-spot model,\nis a simplified physical model of Sun-like variability and the fourth is a\nsimple sliding boxcar filter. We apply a Monte Carlo approach by simulating a\nlarge number of 150-day light curves (as for CoRoT long runs) for different\nplanetary radii, orbital periods, epochs of the first transit and standard\ndeviations of the photon shot noise. Stellar variability is given by the Total\nSolar Irradiance variations as observed close to the maximum of solar cycle 23.\nAfter filtering solar variability, transits are searched for by means of the\nBLS algorithm.

We argue that in principle it would\nbe better to fit the foregrounds non-parametrically - allowing the data to\ndetermine their shape - rather than selecting some functional form in advance\nand then fitting its parameters. Non-parametric fits often suffer from other\nproblems, however. We discuss these before suggesting a non-parametric method,\nWp smoothing, which seems to avoid some of them. After outlining the principles\nof Wp smoothing we describe an algorithm used to implement it. We then apply Wp\nsmoothing to a synthetic data cube for the LOFAR EoR experiment. The\nperformance of Wp smoothing, measured by the extent to which it is able to\nrecover the variance of the cosmological signal and to which it avoids leakage\nof power from the foregrounds, is compared to that of a parametric fit, and to\nanother non-parametric method (smoothing splines). We find that Wp smoothing is\nsuperior to smoothing splines for our application, and is competitive with\nparametric methods even though in the latter case we may choose the functional\nform of the fit with advance knowledge of the simulated foregrounds. Finally,\nwe discuss how the quality of the fit is affected by the frequency resolution\nand range, by the characteristics of the cosmological signal and by edge\neffects. \n\n"}

{"id": "0906.0995", "contents": "Title: Photometric Redshift Estimation Using Spectral Connectivity Analysis Abstract: The development of fast and accurate methods of photometric redshift\nestimation is a vital step towards being able to fully utilize the data of\nnext-generation surveys within precision cosmology. In this paper we apply a\nspecific approach to spectral connectivity analysis (SCA; Lee & Wasserman 2009)\ncalled diffusion map. SCA is a class of non-linear techniques for transforming\nobserved data (e.g., photometric colours for each galaxy, where the data lie on\na complex subset of p-dimensional space) to a simpler, more natural coordinate\nsystem wherein we apply regression to make redshift predictions. As SCA relies\nupon eigen-decomposition, our training set size is limited to ~ 10,000\ngalaxies; we use the Nystrom extension to quickly estimate diffusion\ncoordinates for objects not in the training set. We apply our method to 350,738\nSDSS main sample galaxies, 29,816 SDSS luminous red galaxies, and 5,223\ngalaxies from DEEP2 with CFHTLS ugriz photometry. For all three datasets, we\nachieve prediction accuracies on par with previous analyses, and find that use\nof the Nystrom extension leads to a negligible loss of prediction accuracy\nrelative to that achieved with the training sets. As in some previous analyses\n(e.g., Collister & Lahav 2004, Ball et al. 2008), we observe that our\npredictions are generally too high (low) in the low (high) redshift regimes. We\ndemonstrate that this is a manifestation of attenuation bias, wherein\nmeasurement error (i.e., uncertainty in diffusion coordinates due to\nuncertainty in the measured fluxes/magnitudes) reduces the slope of the\nbest-fit regression line. Mitigation of this bias is necessary if we are to use\nphotometric redshift estimates produced by computationally efficient empirical\nmethods in precision cosmology. \n\n"}

The dependence of clustering on luminosity and\n  stellar mass at z=0.2-1 Abstract: We study the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and stellar mass\nat redshifts z ~ [0.2-1] using the first zCOSMOS 10K sample.\n  We measure the redshift-space correlation functions xi(rp,pi) and its\nprojection wp(rp) for sub-samples covering different luminosity, mass and\nredshift ranges. We quantify in detail the observational selection biases and\nwe check our covariance and error estimate techniques using ensembles of\nsemi-analytic mock catalogues. We finally compare our measurements to the\ncosmological model predictions from the mock surveys.\n  At odds with other measurements, we find a weak dependence of galaxy\nclustering on luminosity in all redshift bins explored. A mild dependence on\nstellar mass is instead observed. At z~0.7, wp(rp) shows strong excess power on\nlarge scales. We interpret this as produced by large-scale structure dominating\nthe survey volume and extending preferentially in direction perpendicular to\nthe line-of-sight. We do not see any significant evolution with redshift of the\namplitude of clustering for bright and/or massive galaxies.\n  The clustering measured in the zCOSMOS data at 0.5<z<1 for galaxies with\nlog(M/M_\\odot)>=10 is only marginally consistent with predictions from the mock\nsurveys. On scales larger than ~2 h^-1 Mpc, the observed clustering amplitude\nis compatible only with ~1% of the mocks. Thus, if the power spectrum of matter\nis LCDM with standard normalization and the bias has no unnatural\nscale-dependence, this result indicates that COSMOS has picked up a\nparticularly rare, ~2-3 sigma positive fluctuation in a volume of ~10^6 h^-1\nMpc^3.

We show that\nincompleteness is a concern for such compact galaxies, particularly for low\nredshifts (z < ~0.05) as a result of the SDSS spectroscopic target selection\nalgorithm. We have identified 63 massive red sequence galaxies at 0.066 < z <\n0.12 that are smaller than the median size-mass relation by a factor of 2 or\nmore. Consistent with expectations from the virial theorem, the median offset\nfrom the mass-velocity dispersion relation for these galaxies is 0.12 dex. We\ndo not find any galaxies with sizes and masses comparable to those observed at\nz ~ 2, implying a decrease in the comoving number density (at fixed size and\nmass) by a factor of > 5000. This result cannot be explained by incompleteness:\nat 0.066 < z <0.12, the SDSS spectroscopic sample should typically be ~75%\ncomplete for galaxies with the sizes and masses seen at high redshift, although\nfor the very smallest galaxies it may be as low as ~20%. To confirm that the\nabsence of such compact massive galaxies in SDSS is not a spectroscopic\nselection effect, we have also looked for such galaxies in the SDSS photometric\ncatalog, using photometric redshifts. While we do find signs of a bias against\nmassive, compact galaxies, this analysis suggests that the SDSS spectroscopic\nsample is missing at most a few objects in the regime we consider. Accepting\nthe high redshift results, it is clear that massive galaxies must undergo\nsignificant structural evolution over z<2 in order to match the population seen\nin the local universe.

We use ~100 simulations to\nsurvey a large parameter space of galaxy properties and subgrid models for the\nISM physics. We generate initial conditions for our simulations of galactic\nnuclei (<~300pc) using galaxy scale simulations, including both major mergers\nand isolated bar-(un)stable disk galaxies. For sufficiently gas-rich,\ndisk-dominated systems, a series of gravitational instabilities generates large\naccretion rates of up to 1-10 M_sun/yr onto the BH (at <<0.1pc); sufficient to\nfuel the most luminous quasars. The BH accretion rate is highly time variable,\ngiven fixed conditions at ~kpc. At >~10pc, our simulations resemble the 'bars\nwithin bars' model, but the gas exhibits diverse morphologies, including\nspirals, rings, clumps, and bars; their duty cycle is modest, complicating\nattempts to correlate BH accretion with nuclear morphology. At ~1-10pc, the\ngravitational potential becomes dominated by the BH and bar-like modes are no\nlonger present. However, the gas becomes unstable to a standing, eccentric disk\nor a single-armed spiral mode (m=1), driving the gas to sub-pc scales. Proper\ntreatment of this mode requires including star formation and the self-gravity\nof both the stars and gas.

The observed high-z LGRB\nrate shows significant excess over that estimated from the star formation\nhistory.

In the case\nthat LGRB rate is purely proportional to the star formation rate (SFR), our\nsimulations poorly reproduce the LGRB rate at z>4, although the simulated log\nN-log P distribution is in good agreement with the observed one. Assuming that\nthe excess of high-z GRB rate is due to the cosmic metallicity evolution or\nunknown LGRB rate increase parameterized as (1+z)^delta, we find that although\nthe two scenarios alone can improve the consistency between our simulations and\nobservations, incorporation of them gives much better consistency.

We sample the\nentire range in galaxy luminosity (Mv = -11 to -23 mag = 10^6 - 10^11 L_sol),\nenvironment, and morphology.

Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid. We also analyse halo vertical shapes and\nobserve that their vertical flattenings remain considerable, meaning that the\nhaloes become approximately oblate by the end of the simulations.

A key challenge for such models is to fit\nthe detailed spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We present a\ndetailed discussion of the small-scale CMB in an inhomogeneous universe,\nfocusing on spherically symmetric `void' models. We allow for the dynamical\neffects of radiation while analyzing the problem, in contrast to other work\nwhich inadvertently fine tunes its spatial profile.

Moreover, observations show that the UV luminosities and\nstellar masses grow from z=8 to 3, implying that the SFRs increase with time.\nWe compare the cosmologically averaged evolution in galaxies at 3 < z < 8 at\nconstant comoving number density, n = 2 x 10^-4 Mpc^-3. This allows us to study\nthe evolution of stellar mass and star formation in the galaxy predecessors and\ndescendants in ways not possible using galaxies selected at constant stellar\nmass or SFR, quantities that evolve strongly in time. We show that the average\nSFH of these galaxies increase smoothly from z=8 to 3 as SFR ~ t^alpha with\nalpha = 1.7 +/- 0.2. This conflicts with assumptions that the SFR is either\nconstant or declines exponentially in time. We show that the stellar mass\ngrowth in these galaxies is consistent with this derived SFH. This provides\nevidence that the slope of the high-mass end of the IMF is approximately\nSalpeter unless the duty cycle of star formation is much less than unity. We\nargue that these relations follow from gas accretion (either through accretion\nor delivered by mergers) coupled with galaxy disk growth under the assumption\nthat the SFR depends on the local gas surface density. This predicts that gas\nfractions decrease from z=8 to 3 on average as f_gas ~ (1+z)^0.9 for galaxies\nwith this number density. The implied galaxy gas accretion rates at z > 4 are\nas fast and may even exceed the SFR: this is the \"gas accretion epoch\". At z <\n4 the SFR overtakes the implied gas accretion rate, indicating a period where\ngalaxies consume gas faster than it is acquired. At z < 3, galaxies with this\nnumber density depart from these relations implying that star formation and gas\naccretion are slowed at later times. \n\n"}

We show that in the theory there can be no a priori classical\ncurvature, with all curvature having to result from quantization. In the\nconformal theory gravity requires no independent quantization of its own, with\nit being quantized solely by virtue of its being coupled to a quantized matter\nsource. Moreover, because it is this very coupling that fixes the strength of\nthe gravitational field commutators, the gravity sector zero-point energy\ndensity and pressure fluctuations are then able to identically cancel the\nzero-point fluctuations associated with the matter sector. In addition, we show\nthat when the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken, the zero-point\nstructure automatically readjusts so as to identically cancel the cosmological\nconstant term that dynamical mass generation induces.

Since the Hubble parameter in this cosmology reproduces the same\nLCDM expansion history, we study how upcoming weak lensing surveys, such as\nEuclid and DES (Dark Energy Survey), can confirm or rule out this class of\nmodels. We perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to determine the\nparameters of the model, using Type Ia Supernov\\ae, H(z) data, Gamma Ray Bursts\nand Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. We also fit the power spectrum of the\ntemperature anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background to obtain the\ncorrect normalisation for the density perturbation power spectrum. Then, we\ncompute the matter and the cosmic shear power spectra, both in the linear and\nnon-linear regimes. The latter is calculated with the two different approaches\nof Hu and Sawicki (2007) (HS) and Khoury and Wyman (2009) (KW). With the eDGP\nparameters coming from the Markov Chains, KW reproduces the LCDM matter power\nspectrum at both linear and non-linear scales and the LCDM and eDGP shear\nsignals are degenerate. This result does not hold with the HS prescription:\nEuclid can distinguish the eDGP model from LCDM because their expected power\nspectra roughly differ by the 3sigma uncertainty in the angular scale range\n700<l<3000; on the contrary, the two models differ at most by the 1sigma\nuncertainty over the range 500<l<3000 in the DES experiment and they are\nvirtually indistinguishable. \n\n"}

Specifically, the\nanalytic theory suggests that they are caustic waves in ensembles of stars\npursuing correlated epicyclic orbits after the disturbance. This theory is an\nextension of that developed by Struck and collaborators for colliding ring\ngalaxies.\n  The models suggest that this type of wave may persist for a couple of Gyr.,\nand galaxy interactions occur on comparable timescales, so waves produced by\nthe mechanism may be well represented in observed spirals.

The dominant source of noise in the power spectrum of the tracers is\ncaused by sampling variance on large scales (where the non-Gaussian signal is\nstrongest) and shot noise arising from their discrete nature.

Gas content is set by a competition between inflow into and gas\nconsumption within the ISM, the latter being governed by the SF law, while the\nformer is impacted by both wind recycling and preventive feedback. Stochastic\nvariations in the inflow rate move galaxies off the equilibrium M*-Z and\nZ*-fgas relations in a manner correlated with star formation rate, and the\nscatter is set by the timescale to re-equilibrate. The evolution of both\nrelations from z=3-0 is slow, as individual galaxies tend to evolve mostly\nalong the relations. Gas fractions at a given M* slowly decrease with time\nbecause the cosmic inflow rate diminishes faster than the consumption rate,\nwhile metallicities slowly increase as infalling gas becomes more enriched.\nObservations from z~3-0 are better matched by simulations employing\nmomentum-driven wind scalings rather than constant wind speeds, but all models\npredict too low gas fractions at low masses and too high metallicities at high\nM*.

We apply this method to infer the\nnumber of mergers during the evolution of MUSYC early-type galaxies (ETGs) from\nz~1 to the present-day. Methods: The method consists in using clustering\ninformation to infer the typical dark-matter halo mass of the hosts of the\nselected progenitor galaxies. Using LambdaCDM predictions, it is then possible\nto follow these haloes to a later time where the sample of descendants will be\nthat with the clustering of these descendant haloes. Results: This technique\nshows that ETGs at a given redshift evolve into brighter galaxies at lower\nredshifts (considering rest-frame, passively evolved optical luminosities).\nThis indicates that the stellar mass of these galaxies increases with time and\nthat, in principle, a stellar mass selection at different redshifts does not\nprovide samples of galaxies in a progenitor-descendant relationship.\nConclusions: The comparison between high redshift ETGs and their likely\ndescendants at z=0 points to a higher number density for the progenitors by a\nfactor 5.5+-4.0, implying the need for mergers to decrease their number density\nby today.

We designate this region as the star forming (SF) disk, in which metals\nare produced from supernova explosions (SNexp) while at the same time inflows\nare driven by SNexp-excited turbulent viscosity to accrete onto the SMBHs. In\nthis paper, an equation of metallicity governed by SNexp and radial advection\nis established to describe the metal distribution and evolution in the SF disk.\nWe find that the metal abundance is enriched at different rates at different\npositions in the disk, and that a metallicity gradient is set up that evolves\nfor steady-state AGNs. Metallicity as an integrated physical parameter can be\nused as a probe of the SF disk age during one episode of SMBH activity.

The proposals could potentially be\ntested with numerical simulations. Outgoing and ingoing particles free-falling\nin the parent Kerr geometry become highly focused along the principal outgoing\nand ingoing null directions as they approach the inner horizon, triggering the\nmass inflation instability. The original arguments of Barrabes, Israel &\nPoisson (1990) regarding inflation in rotating black holes are reviewed, and\nshown to be based on Raychauduri's equation applied along the outgoing and\ningoing null directions. It is argued that gravitational waves should behave in\nthe geometric optics limit, and consequently that the spacetime should be\nalmost shear-free. A full set of shear-free equations is derived. A specific\nline-element is proposed, which is argued should provide a satisfactory\napproximation during early inflation.

Dark matter is described by dust and dark energy with a scalar field\nwith potential V({\\phi}). In order to fix the scalar field potential we demand\nLie symmetry invariance of the field equations, which is a model-independent\nassumption. The requirement of an extra Lie symmetry selects the exponential\nscalar field potential. The further requirement that the analytic solution is\ninvariant under the point transformation generated by the Lie symmetry\neliminates dark matter and leads to a quintessence and a phantom cosmological\nmodel containing a perfect fluid and a scalar field. Next we assume that the\nLagrangian of the system admits an extra Noether symmetry.

We study\noptical/near-infrared (NIR) colour distributions of the GC systems in 14 E/S0\ngalaxies. We test whether the bimodal feature, generally present in optical\ncolour distributions, remains in the optical/NIR ones. The latter colour\ncombination is a better metallicity proxy than the former. We use KMM and GMM\ntests to quantify the probability that different colour distributions are\nbetter described by a bimodal, as opposed to a unimodal distribution. We find\nthat double-peaked colour distributions are more commonly seen in optical than\nin optical/NIR colours. For some of the galaxies where the optical (g-z)\ndistribution is clearly bimodal, the (g-K) and (z-K) distributions are better\ndescribed by a unimodal distribution. The two most cluster-rich galaxies in our\nsample, NGC4486 and NGC4649, show some interesting differences. The (g-K)\ndistribution of NGC4649 is better described by a bimodal distribution, while\nthis is true for the (g-K) distribution of NGC4486 GCs only if restricted to a\nbrighter sub-sample with small K-band errors (< 0.05 mag). Formally, the K-band\nphotometric errors cannot be responsible for blurring bimodal metallicity\ndistributions to unimodal (g-K) colour distributions. However, simulations\nincluding the extra scatter in the colour-colour diagrams (not fully accounted\nfor in the photometric errors) show that such scatter may contribute to the\ndisappearance of bimodality in (g-K) for the full NGC4486 sample.

Several\nrecent papers have used methods from machine learning and statistics to\nconstruct classifiers on databases of labeled, multi--epoch sources with the\nintention of using these classifiers to automatically infer the classes of\nunlabeled sources from new surveys. However, the same source observed with two\ndifferent synoptic surveys will generally yield different derived metrics\n(features) from the light curve. Since such features are used in classifiers,\nthis survey-dependent mismatch in feature space will typically lead to degraded\nclassifier performance. In this paper we show how and why feature distributions\nchange using OGLE and \\textit{Hipparcos} light curves.

Specifically, we determine how the mean color of galaxies\nvaries with one parameter when another is fixed.

Using deep YJKs\nimaging with the HAWK-I instrument on the VLT we identify a tight red sequence\nand construct its rest-frame i-band luminosity function (LF). There is a marked\ndeficit of faint red galaxies in the cluster that causes a turnover in the LF.\nWe compare the red sequence LF to that for clusters at z<0.8 correcting the\nluminosities for passive evolution. The shape of the cluster red sequence LF\ndoes not evolve between z=1.62 and z=0.6 but at z<0.6 the faint population\nbuilds up significantly. Meanwhile, between z=1.62 to 0.6 the inferred total\nlight on the red sequence grows by a factor of about 2 and the bright end of\nthe LF becomes more populated. We construct a simple model for red sequence\nevolution that grows the red sequence in total luminosity and matches the\nconstant LF shape at z>0.6.

At an early epoch when the\ndark matter density is negligible, as an obvious consequence, the density of\ndark radiation is also very small.

A Salpeter stellar initial mass function in the\n  bulges of massive spiral galaxies Abstract: Recent work has suggested that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is not\nuniversal, but rather is correlated with galaxy stellar mass, stellar velocity\ndispersion, or morphological type. In this paper, we investigate variations of\nthe IMF within individual galaxies. For this purpose, we use strong lensing and\ngas kinematics to measure independently the normalisation of the IMF of the\nbulge and disk components of a sample of 5 massive spiral galaxies with\nsubstantial bulge components taken from the SWELLS survey. We find that the\nstellar mass of the bulges are tightly constrained by the lensing and kinematic\ndata. A comparison with masses based on stellar population synthesis models\nfitted to optical and near infrared photometry favors a Salpeter-like\nnormalisation of the IMF. Conversely, the disk masses are less well constrained\ndue to degeneracies with the dark matter halo, but are consistent with Milky\nWay type IMFs in agreement with previous studies. The disks are submaximal at\n2.2 disk scale lengths, but due to the contribution of the bulges, the galaxies\nare baryon dominated at 2.2 disk scale lengths. Globally, our inferred IMF\nnormalisation is consistent with that found for early-type galaxies of\ncomparable stellar mass (> 10^11 M_sun).

We interpret short lived local\ndensity peaks, that appear and fade on approximately an orbital period, as\narising from positive interference between spiral density wave patterns. Stars\nnear such a peak can migrate over a significant distance in galactocentric\nradius during the peak lifetime, providing that the peak is sufficiently dense.\nUsing a Gaussian bar model for the potential perturbation associated with a\nnarrow transient spiral feature, estimates of the migration rate, angular\noffset between particle and spiral feature, and maximum eccentricity for\nmigrators roughly agrees with the values measured in our simulation.

Historically, galaxy formation models\nhave had difficulty explaining the observed number counts of SMGs. We combine a\nsemi-empirical model with 3-D hydrodynamical simulations and 3-D dust radiative\ntransfer to predict the number counts of unlensed SMGs. Because the stellar\nmass functions, gas and dust masses, and sizes of our galaxies are constrained\nto match observations, we can isolate uncertainties related to the dynamical\nevolution of galaxy mergers and the dust radiative transfer. The number counts\nand redshift distributions predicted by our model agree well with observations.\nIsolated disc galaxies dominate the faint (S_1.1 < ~1 mJy, or S_850 < ~2 mJy)\npopulation. The brighter sources are a mix of merger-induced starbursts and\ngalaxy-pair SMGs; the latter subpopulation accounts for ~30 - 50 per cent of\nall SMGs at all S_1.1 > ~0.5 mJy (S_850 > ~1 mJy). The mean redshifts are ~3.0\n- 3.5, depending on the flux cut, and the brightest sources tend to be at\nhigher redshifts. Because the galaxy-pair SMGs will be resolved into multiple\nfainter sources by ALMA, the bright ALMA counts should be as much as 2 times\nless than those observed using single-dish telescopes. The agreement between\nour model, which uses a Kroupa IMF, and observations suggests that the IMF in\nhigh-redshifts starbursts need not be top-heavy; if the IMF were top-heavy, our\nmodel would over-predict the number counts. We conclude that the difficulty\nsome models have reproducing the observed SMG counts is likely indicative of\nmore general problems -- such as an under-prediction of the abundance of\nmassive galaxies or a star formation rate--stellar mass relation normalisation\nlower than that observed -- rather than a problem specific to the SMG\npopulation. \n\n"}

Here we extend this framework by localizing the\nangular momentum of the linearized gravitational field, deriving a\ngravitational spin tensor which possesses similarly desirable properties. By\nexamining the local exchange of angular momentum (between matter and gravity)\nwe find that gravitational intrinsic spin is localized, separately from orbital\nangular momentum, in terms of a gravitational spin tensor. This spin tensor is\nthen uniquely determined by requiring that it obey two simple physically\nmotivated algebraic conditions. Firstly, the spin of an arbitrary\n(harmonic-gauge) gravitational plane wave is required to flow in the direction\nof propagation of the wave. Secondly, the spin tensor of any\ntransverse-traceless gravitational field is required to be traceless.

The flaring activity was observed during a 34.6-minute\nexposure, when the integral flux above 200 GeV reached $(3.4\\pm0.6) \\times\n10^{-6} \\;\\text{photons}\\;\\text{m}^{-2}\\text{s}^{-1}$, roughly 125% of the Crab\nNebula flux measured by VERITAS. The light curve indicates that the\nobservations missed the rising phase of the flare but covered a significant\nportion of the decaying phase. The exponential decay time was determined to be\n$13\\pm4$ minutes, making it one of the most rapid gamma-ray flares seen from a\nTeV blazar. The gamma-ray spectrum of BL Lacertae during the flare was soft,\nwith a photon index of $3.6\\pm 0.4$, which is in agreement with the measurement\nmade previously by MAGIC in a lower flaring state.

In the realistic scenario, where the hot gas is\ncooling, while heated and stirred on large scales, the accretion rate is\nboosted up to two orders of magnitude compared with the Bondi prediction. The\ncause is the nonlinear growth of thermal instabilities, leading to the\ncondensation of cold clouds and filaments when t_cool/t_ff < 10. Subsonic\nturbulence of just over 100 km/s (M > 0.2) induces the formation of thermal\ninstabilities, even in the absence of heating, while in the transonic regime\nturbulent dissipation inhibits their growth (t_turb/t_cool < 1). When heating\nrestores global thermodynamic balance, the formation of the multiphase medium\nis violent, and the mode of accretion is fully cold and chaotic. The recurrent\ncollisions and tidal forces between clouds, filaments and the central clumpy\ntorus promote angular momentum cancellation, hence boosting accretion. On\nsub-pc scales the clouds are channelled to the very centre via a funnel. A good\napproximation to the accretion rate is the cooling rate, which can be used as\nsubgrid model, physically reproducing the boost factor of 100 required by\ncosmological simulations, while accounting for fluctuations. Chaotic cold\naccretion may be common in many systems, such as hot galactic halos, groups,\nand clusters, generating high-velocity clouds and strong variations of the AGN\nluminosity and jet orientation. In this mode, the black hole can quickly react\nto the state of the entire host galaxy, leading to efficient self-regulated AGN\nfeedback and the symbiotic Magorrian relation. During phases of overheating,\nthe hot mode becomes the single channel of accretion (with a different cuspy\ntemperature profile), though strongly suppressed by turbulence. \n\n"}

The method is based on matching the observed overdensity in\nthe weighted number of galaxies to that found in mock catalogs with k_ext\nobtained by ray-tracing through structure formation simulations. We explore\nweighting schemes based on projected distance, mass, luminosity, and redshift.\nThis additional information reduces the uncertainty of k_ext from sigma_k $0.06\nto ~0.04 for very overdense lines of sight like that of the system B1608+656.\nFor more common lines of sight, sigma_k is reduced to ~<0.03, corresponding to\nan uncertainty of ~<3% on distance. This uncertainty has comparable effects on\ncosmological parameters to that arising from the mass model of the deflector\nand its immediate environment. Photometric redshifts based on g, r, i and K\nphotometries are sufficient to constrain k_ext almost as well as with\nspectroscopic redshifts.

In this model Planck data determine the\ncosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble\nconstant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density\nparameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement\nwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys.

The deviation of the scalar spectral\nindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes\nin the matter content of the Universe.

Over the\nstellar mass range probed by our data, 0.52 - 0.77 Msun, the IMF is best fit by\na power-law slope of alpha = 1.2^{+0.4}_{-0.5} for Hercules and alpha = 1.3 +/-\n0.8 for Leo IV.

Previous\nanalytical studies and 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations indicate that\nrelativistic reconnection is a viable mechanism to circumvent the above\ndifficulties. The reconnection electric field localized at X-points linearly\naccelerates particles with little radiative energy losses.

The focus of the workshop was on time domain radio astronomy and sky\nsurveys. For the time domain, the extent to which radio and visible wavelength\nobservations are required to understand several classes of transients was\nstressed, but there are also classes of radio transients for which no visible\nwavelength counterpart is yet known, providing an opportunity for discovery.\nFrom the LSST perspective, the LSST is expected to generate as many as 1\nmillion alerts nightly, which will require even more selective specification\nand identification of the classes and characteristics of transients that can\nwarrant follow up, at radio or any wavelength. The LSST will also conduct a\ndeep survey of the sky, producing a catalog expected to contain over 38 billion\nobjects in it. Deep radio wavelength sky surveys will also be conducted on a\ncomparable time scale, and radio and visible wavelength observations are part\nof the multi-wavelength approach needed to classify and understand these\nobjects. Radio wavelengths are valuable because they are unaffected by dust\nobscuration and, for galaxies, contain contributions both from star formation\nand from active galactic nuclei. The workshop touched on several other topics,\non which there was consensus including the placement of other LSST \"Deep\nDrilling Fields,\" inter-operability of software tools, and the challenge of\nfiltering and exploiting the LSST data stream.

Moreover, we observe an increase of the typical Sersic index and\nbulge-to-total ratio (with median B/T reaching 40-50%) among star-forming\ngalaxies above 10^11 Msun.

We use observations and simulations to demonstrate how LOS\ncontamination affects the column density probability distribution function\n(PDF). We apply a first-order approximation (removing a constant level) to the\nmolecular clouds of Auriga, Maddalena, Carina and NGC3603. In perfect agreement\nwith the simulations, we find that the PDFs become broader, the peak shifts to\nlower column densities, and the power-law tail of the PDF flattens after\ncorrection. All PDFs have a lognormal part for low column densities with a peak\nat Av~2, a deviation point (DP) from the lognormal at Av(DP)~4-5, and a\npower-law tail for higher column densities. Assuming a density distribution\nrho~r^-alpha, the slopes of the power-law tails correspond to alpha(PDF)=1.8,\n1.75, and 2.5 for Auriga, Carina, and NGC3603 (alpha~1.5-2 is consistent\ngravitational collapse).

We find that\nsignificantly large SZ-X-ray offsets (>100kpc) can be produced during the major\nmergers of galaxy clusters. The significantly large offsets are mainly caused\nby a `jump effect' occurred between the primary and secondary pericentric\npassages of the two merging clusters, during which the X-ray peak may jump to\nthe densest gas region located near the center of the small cluster, but the SZ\npeak remains near the center of the large one. Our simulations show that\nmerging systems with higher masses and larger initial relative velocities may\nresult in larger offset sizes and longer offset time durations; and only nearly\nhead-on mergers are likely to produce significantly large offsets. We further\ninvestigate the statistical distribution of the SZ-X-ray offset sizes and find\nthat (1) the number distribution of the offset sizes is bimodal with one peak\nlocated at low offsets ~0 and the other at large offsets ~350-450kpc/h, but the\nobjects with intermediate offsets are scarce; and (2) the probabilities of the\nclusters in the mass range higher than 2x10^{14}Msun/h that have offsets larger\nthan 20, 50, 200, 300, and 500kpc/h are 34.0%, 11.1%, 8.0%, 6.5%, and 2.0%\nrespectively at z=0.7. The probability is sensitive to the underlying pairwise\nvelocity distribution and the merger rate of clusters. Future observations on\nthe offsets for a large number of clusters may put strong constraints on the\ncosmic velocity fields on the cluster scale and the cluster merger rate.\n(Abridged) \n\n"}

We report\non a survey for X-ray cavities in 83 massive, high-redshift (0.4<z<1.2)\nclusters of galaxies selected by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signature in the\nSouth Pole Telescope data. Based on Chandra X-ray images, we find a total of 6\nclusters having symmetric pairs of surface brightness depressions consistent\nwith the picture of radio jets inflating X-ray cavities in the intracluster\nmedium. The majority of these detections are of relatively low significance and\nrequire deeper follow-up data in order to be confirmed. Further, due to the\nlimitations of Chandra at high redshift, this search misses small (<10 kpc),\nunresolved X-ray cavities at high (z>0.5) redshift. Despite these limitations,\nour results suggest that the power generated by AGN feedback in brightest\ncluster galaxies has remained unchanged for over half of the age of the\nUniverse (>7 Gyrs at z=0.8). On average, the detected X-ray cavities have\npowers of 0.8-5*10^45 erg/s, enthalpies of 3-6*10^59 erg, and radii of 17 kpc.\nIntegrating over 7 Gyrs, we find that the supermassive black holes in the\nbrightest cluster galaxies may have accreted 10^8 to several 10^9M_sun of\nmaterial to power these outflows. This level of accretion indicates that\nsignificant supermassive black hole growth may occur not only at early times,\nin the quasar era, but at late times as well. We also find that X-ray cavities\nat high-redshift may inject an excess heat of 0.1-1.0 keV per particle into the\nhot intracluster medium above and beyond the energy needed to offset cooling.\nThis value is similar to the energy needed to preheat clusters, break\nself-similarity, and explain the excess entropy in hot atmospheres. \n\n"}

We measure the\nquadrupole weak lensing signal from the elliptical halos of 70,000 SDSS\nLuminous Red Galaxies. We use a new estimator that nulls the spherical halo\nlensing signal, isolating the shear due to anisotropy in the dark matter\ndistribution. One of the two Cartesian components of our estimator is\ninsensitive to the primary systematic, a spurious alignment of lens and source\nellipticities, allowing us to make robust measurements of halo ellipticity.

The clumps should give the main contribution into the\nsignal of dark matter annihilation, provided that they have survived until the\npresent time.

Thus the minimum (and typical) grain size\n$s_\\text{min}$ is expected to be close to the radiation pressure blowout size\n$s_\\text{blow}$. Yet a recent analysis of a sample of Herschel-resolved debris\ndiscs showed the ratio $s_\\text{min}/s_\\text{blow}$ to systematically decrease\nwith the stellar luminosity from about ten for solar-type stars to nearly unity\nin the discs around the most luminous A-type stars. Here we explore this trend\nin more detail, checking how significant it is and seeking to find possible\nexplanations. We show that the trend is robust to variation of the composition\nand porosity of dust particles. For any assumed grain properties and stellar\nparameters, we suggest a recipe of how to estimate the \"true\" radius of a\nspatially unresolved debris disc, based solely on its spectral energy\ndistribution. The results of our collisional simulations are qualitatively\nconsistent with the trend, although additional effects may also be at work. In\nparticular, the lack of grains with small $s_\\text{min}/s_\\text{blow}$ for\nlower luminosity stars might be caused by the grain surface energy constraint\nthat should limit the size of the smallest collisional fragments. Also, a\nbetter agreement between the data and the collisional simulations is achieved\nwhen assuming debris discs of more luminous stars to have higher dynamical\nexcitation than those of less luminous primaries. This would imply that\nprotoplanetary discs of more massive young stars are more efficient in forming\nbig planetesimals or planets that act as stirrers in the debris discs at the\nsubsequent evolutionary stage. \n\n"}

Since the photodissociation rate of H_2^+ depends on its level\npopulation, we take full account of the vibrationally-resolved H_2^+ kinetics.\nWe find that in clouds under soft but intense radiation fields with spectral\ntemperature T_rad < 7000 K, the H_2^+ channel is the dominant H_2 formation\nprocess. On the other hand, for harder spectra with T_rad > 7000 K, the H^-\nchannel takes over H_2^+ in the production of molecular hydrogen. We calculate\nthe critical radiation intensity needed for supermassive star formation by\ndirect collapse and examine its dependence on the H_2^+ level population.

The halo bias of high redshift halos ($z \\geq 2$) is found to be\nstrongly non-linear and scale-dependent on quasi-linear scales that are larger\nthan their virial radii ($0.5-10$ Mpc/h).

The precision of such measurements will dramatically increase\nwith ongoing and future wide-field galaxy surveys. However, these are also\nincreasingly sensitive to observational and astrophysical contaminants. Here,\nwe study the statistical properties of three methods proposed for controlling\nsuch systematics -- template subtraction, basic mode projection, and extended\nmode projection -- all of which make use of externally supplied template maps,\ndesigned to characterise and capture the spatial variations of potential\nsystematic effects. Based on a detailed mathematical analysis, and in agreement\nwith simulations, we find that the template subtraction method in its original\nformulation returns biased estimates of the galaxy angular clustering. We\nderive closed-form expressions that should be used to correct results for this\nshortcoming. Turning to the basic mode projection algorithm, we prove it to be\nfree of any bias, whereas we conclude that results computed with extended mode\nprojection are biased. Within a simplified setup, we derive analytical\nexpressions for the bias and discuss the options for correcting it in more\nrealistic configurations.

As primary examples, we take two recent (and discrepant)\nmeasurements of the total mass within 50 kpc of the Galaxy and find they imply\nvery different mass profiles and stellar masses for the Galaxy. The\ndark-matter-only version of the Illustris simulation enables us to compute the\neffects of galaxy formation on such constraints on a halo-by-halo basis; on\nsmall scales, galaxy formation enhances the density relative to\ndark-matter-only runs, while the total mass density is approximately 20% lower\nat large Galactocentric distances.

The gravitons are produced by the\nfour cosmic transitions, mostly by the inflation-reheating one. We perform\nadiabatic regularization to remove vacuum divergences in three schemes: at\npresent, at the end of inflation, and at horizon-exit, to the 2-nd adiabatic\norder for the spectrum, and the 4-th order for energy density and pressure. In\nthe first scheme a cutoff is needed to remove graviton divergences. We find\nthat all three schemes yield the spectra of a similar profile, and the\nprimordial spectrum defined far outside horizon during inflation is practically\nunaffected. We also regularize the gauge-invariant perturbed inflaton and the\nscalar curvature perturbation by the last two schemes, and find that the scalar\nspectra, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the consistency relation remain\nunchanged. \n\n"}

Such solutions are often difficult to find in\nbeyond-general-relativity theories due to the inclusion of additional fields\nthat couple to the metric non-linearly and non-minimally. In this paper, we\nconsider rotating black hole solutions in one such theory, dynamical\nChern-Simons gravity, where the Einstein-Hilbert action is modified by the\nintroduction of a dynamical scalar field that couples to the metric through the\nPontryagin density. We treat dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as an effective\nfield theory and work in the decoupling limit, where corrections are treated as\nsmall perturbations from general relativity. We perturb about the\nmaximally-rotating Kerr solution, the so-called extremal limit, and develop\nmathematical insight into the analysis techniques needed to construct solutions\nfor generic spin. First we find closed-form, analytic expressions for the\nextremal scalar field, and then determine the trace of the metric perturbation,\ngiving both in terms of Legendre decompositions.

Here we present a three-dimensional model\nthat explains this relationship, in order to shed insight on the processes that\ncontrol heat redistribution in tidally-locked planetary atmospheres. This\nthree-dimensional model combines predictive analytic theory for the atmospheric\ncirculation and dayside-nightside temperature differences over a range of\nequilibrium temperature, atmospheric composition, and potential frictional drag\nstrengths with numerical solutions of the circulation that verify this analytic\ntheory. This analytic theory shows that the longitudinal propagation of waves\nmediates dayside-nightside temperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres,\nanalogous to the wave adjustment mechanism that regulates the thermal structure\nin Earth's tropics. These waves can be damped in hot Jupiter atmospheres by\neither radiative cooling or potential frictional drag. This frictional drag\nwould likely be caused by Lorentz forces in a partially ionized atmosphere\nthreaded by a background magnetic field, and would increase in strength with\nincreasing temperature. Additionally, the amplitude of radiative heating and\ncooling increases with increasing temperature, and hence both radiative\nheating/cooling and frictional drag damp waves more efficiently with increasing\nequilibrium temperature. Radiative heating and cooling play the largest role in\ncontrolling dayside-nightside temperature temperature differences in both our\nanalytic theory and numerical simulations, with frictional drag only important\nif it is stronger than the Coriolis force. As a result, dayside-nightside\ntemperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres increase with increasing\nstellar irradiation and decrease with increasing pressure. \n\n"}

We make\npredictions for future observations of lower-mass objects for both SZ and\ndiffuse X-ray measurements, finding that they are not just scaled-down versions\nof massive galaxies, but more strongly affected by galactic winds driven by\nstar formation. Low-mass haloes (<~10^11 Msun) retain a low fraction of their\nbaryons, which results in a strong suppression of the SZ signal. Our\nsimulations therefore predict a scaling with halo mass that is steeper than\nself-similar for haloes less massive than 10^13 Msun. For halo masses <~10^12\nMsun, L_X is time-variable and correlated primarily with the star formation\nrate (SFR).

Such line profiles have been found to arise from the bulk\nmotion of ionized gas clouds associated with galactic-scale outflows, merging\npairs of galaxies each harboring a supermassive black hole (SMBH), and/or\ngalactic-scale disk rotation.

We detect a density discontinuity NNE of this core which we\nspeculate is associated with a cold front. Our radio images reveal new details\nfor the complex radio relic and radio halo in this cluster. In addition, we\ndiscover several new filamentary radio sources with sizes of 100-300 kpc.

However, the axions can couple to the\ninflaton which leads to their production after inflation. Then, these axions\nremain in the expanding Universe contributing to the dark radiation component,\nwhich is severely bounded from present cosmological data. We place a general\nconstraint on the axion production rate and apply it to several variants of\nreasonable inflaton-to-axion couplings. The limit merely constrains the number\nof ultralight axions and the relative strength of inflaton-to-axion coupling.\nIt is valid in both large and small field inflationary models irrespectively of\nthe axion energy scales and masses. Thus, the limit is complementary to those\nassociated with the Universe overclosure and axion isocurvature fluctuations.\nIn particular, a hundred of axions is forbidden if inflaton universally couples\nto all the fields at reheating. In the case of gravitational sector being\nresponsible for the reheating of the Universe (which is a natural option in all\ninflationary models with modified gravity), the axion production can be\nefficient.

Pertaining structure formation in these models, it is well\nknown that inhomogeneities of the Klein-Gordon field are unstable above the\ncharacteristic De Broglie wavelength.

{"id": "1709.00423", "contents": "Title: The Delay Time Distribution of Tidal Disruption Flares Abstract: Recent observations suggest that stellar tidal disruption events (TDE) are\nstrongly overrepresented in rare, post-starburst galaxies. Several dynamical\nmechanisms have been proposed to elevate their TDE rates, ranging from central\nstellar overdensities to the presence of supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nbinaries. Another such mechanism, introduced here, is a radial velocity\nanisotropy in the nuclear star cluster produced during the starburst. These,\nand other, dynamical hypotheses can be disentangled by comparing observations\nto theoretical predictions for the TDE delay time distribution (DTD). We show\nthat SMBH binaries are a less plausible solution for the post-starburst\npreference, as they can only reproduce the observed DTD with extensive\nfine-tuning. The overdensity hypothesis produces a reasonable match to the\nobserved DTD (based on the limited data currently available), provided that the\ninitial stellar density profile created during the starburst, $\\rho(r)$, is\nexceptional in both steepness and normalization. In particular, explaining the\npost-starburst preference requires $\\rho \\propto r^{-\\gamma}$ with $\\gamma\n\\gtrsim 2.5$, i.e. much steeper than the classic Bahcall-Wolf equilibrium\nprofile of $\\gamma = 7/4$.

Radial anisotropies\nalso represent a promising explanation, provided that initial anisotropy\nparameters of $\\beta_0 \\approx 0.5$ are sustainable against the radial orbit\ninstability.

It seems\nthat the most researched dark matter annihilation model is not able to explain\nsuch a large amplitude, since the interactions between the particles produced\nby the dark matter annihilation and the particles that have been present in the\nUniverse could increase the baryonic temperature. Recently, C. Feng and G.\nHolder have suggested that the large amplitude in the global 21 cm spectrum\ncould be produced by considering the possible excess of the early radio\nradiation. In this paper, we propose that the dark matter annihilation still\nworks to explain the large amplitude observed by the EDGES experiment.

Most current predictions are based on the\nMaxwellian approximation which is not only theoretically inconsistent in\nbounded systems, but also not supported by cosmological simulations.

The electromagnetic shower loses a substantial fraction of\nits energy to the CMB spectral distortions before the energy of the particles\nin the shower has degraded to low enough energies that they can thermalize with\nthe background plasma.

The duration of the Roche lobe overflow\nphase is resolution dependent and would lengthen with increased resolution\nbeyond the $\\sim$20 years observed, while the inspiral phase and the\npost-common envelope separation are largely independent of resolution. Mass\ntransfer rates through the Lagrangian points drive the orbital evolution during\nthe Roche lobe overflow phase, as predicted analytically. The absolute mass\ntransfer rate is resolution dependent, but always within an order of magnitude\nof the analytical value. Similarly, the gravitational drag in the simulations\nis close to the analytical approximation. This gives us confidence that\nsimulations approximate reality.

Such a scenario is motivated by the longstanding $\\sim\n\\, 4 \\sigma$ discrepancy between the measured and predicted values of the\nmuon's anomalous magnetic moment, $(g-2)_\\mu$, as well as the tension between\nlate and early time determinations of the Hubble constant. If sufficiently\nlight, the $Z'$ population will decay to neutrinos, increasing the overall\nenergy density of radiation and altering the expansion history of the early\nuniverse. We identify two distinct regions of parameter space in this model in\nwhich the Hubble tension can be significantly relaxed. The first of these is\nthe previously identified region in which a $\\sim \\, 10-20$ MeV $Z'$ reaches\nequilibrium in the early universe and then decays, heating the neutrino\npopulation and delaying the process of neutrino decoupling.

The typical radii of $0.1-1$ kpc, velocities of\n$100-1000$ km s$^{-1}$ and resulting optical depths are consistent with\nobservations of warm absorbers.

All three galaxies have relatively\nlarge optical luminosities (log LB=10.35-10.67 solar) but have X-ray\nluminosities consistent with emission from discrete sources only. In\nconjunction with a Chandra observation of NGC 3585, we analyse the XMM data and\nshow that the three galaxies are dominated by discrete source emission, but do\npossess some X-ray emitting gas. The gas is at relatively low temperatures,\nkT=0.25-0.44 keV. All three galaxies show evidence of recent dynamical\ndisturbance and formation through mergers, including kinematically distinct\ncores, young stellar ages, and embedded stellar disks. This leads us to\nconclude that the galaxies formed relatively recently and have yet to build up\nlarge X-ray halos.

The effects we investigate here are usually not part\nof hydrodynamic simulations and so need to be estimated separately. The most\nimportant effect is that of high column density absorbers with damping wings,\nwhich add power on large scales. We compute their effect using the\nobservational constraints on their abundance as a function of column density.\nIgnoring their effect leads to an underestimation of the slope of the linear\ntheory power spectrum. The second effect we investigate is that of fluctuations\nin the ionizing radiation field. For this purpose we use a very large high\nresolution N-body simulation, which allows us to simulate both the fluctuations\nin the ionizing radiation and the small scale LyaF within the same simulation.\nWe find an enhancement of power on large scales for quasars and a suppression\nfor galaxies. The strength of the effect rapidly increases with increasing\nredshift, allowing it to be uniquely identified in cases where it is\nsignificant. We develop templates which can be used to search for this effect\nas a function of quasar lifetime, quasar luminosity function, and attenuation\nlength. Finally, we explore the effects of galactic winds using hydrodynamic\nsimulations.

While more work is needed to\nconclusively exclude all possible systematic errors, our results suggest that,\nin the context of data analysis procedures where parameters of the LyaF model\nare properly marginalized over, the flux power spectrum is a reliable tracer of\ncosmological information. \n\n"}

The reported observations of\nsuch emission give support to the idea that diffusive shock acceleration (DSA)\ncan amplify magnetic fields by large factors. Furthermore, the uncertain\ncharacter of the amplification process leaves open the possibility that ejecta\nfields, while large enough to support radio emission and DSA, may be much lower\nthan typical interstellar medium values.

Three\nphysically distinct regimes can be identified in the evolution of cluster\nturbulence and magnetic fields. Firstly, the fluctuation dynamo will produce\nmicrogauss-strong, random magnetic fields during cluster formation and major\nmergers. Turbulent velocity of about 300 km/s can be maintained at scales\n100-200 kpc. The magnetic field is intermittent, has a smaller scale of 20-30\nkpc and average strength of 2 microgauss. Secondly, when major mergers end,\nturbulent speed and magnetic field undergo a power-law decay, decreasing in\nstrength but increasing in scale by a factor of about two. Thirdly,\nsmaller-mass subclusters and cluster galaxies produce turbulent wakes, with\nturbulent speeds and magnetic field strengths similar to those quoted above.\nThe velocity scales are about 200 kpc and 10 kpc respectively, and the magnetic\nfield scale is about 6 times smaller. Although these wakes may fill only a\nsmall fraction of the cluster volume, their area covering factor can be close\nto unity. So one can potentially reconcile observations that indicate the\ncoexistence of turbulence with ordered filamentary gas structures, as in the\nPerseus cluster.

Abstract: [ABRIDGED] This is the third in a series of three papers exploring the\nconnection between the multiwavelength properties of AGN in nearby early-type\ngalaxies and the characteristics of their hosts. We selected 116 AGN candidates\nrequiring a radio flux of 1 mJy. We classified the objects with HST images into\n``core'' and ``power-law'' galaxies, on the basis of the nuclear slope of their\nbrightness profiles. We used HST and Chandra data to isolate their nuclear\nemission to study the multiwavelength behaviour of their nuclei. The properties\nof the nuclei hosted by the 29 core galaxies were presented in Paper II. Core\ngalaxies invariably host a radio-loud nucleus, with a median radio-loudness of\nLog R = 3.6 and an X-ray based radio loudness parameter of Log R,X = -1.3. Here\nwe discuss the properties of the nuclei of the 22 ``power-law'' galaxies. They\nshow a substantial excess of optical and X-ray emission with respect to core\ngalaxies at the same level of radio luminosity. Conversely, their\nradio-loudness parameters, Log R ~ 1.6 and Log R,X ~ -3.3, are similar to those\nmeasured in Seyfert galaxies. Thus the radio-loudness of AGN hosted by\nearly-type galaxies appears to be univocally related to the host's brightness\nprofile: radio-loud AGN are only hosted by core galaxies, while radio-quiet AGN\nare found only in power-law galaxies. The brightness profile is determined by\nthe galaxy's evolution, through its merger history; our results suggest that\nthe same process sets the AGN flavour. \n\n"}

The main objective of this paper\nis to show that the HESS results can be explained, under certain reasonable\nassumptions, by inverse Compton scenarios of gamma-ray production in the\nsystem. In this paper we study evolution of the energy spectra of relativistic\nelectrons under different assumptions about the acceleration and energy-loss\nrates of electrons, and the impact of these processes on the lightcurve of IC\ngamma-rays. We demonstrate that the observed TeV lightcurve can be explained\n(i) by adiabatic losses which dominate over the entire trajectory of the pulsar\nwith a significant increase towards the periastron, or (ii) by the sub-TeV\ncutoffs in the energy spectra of electrons due to the enhanced rate of Compton\nlosses close to the periastron. The Compton deceleration of the pulsar wind\ncontributes to the decrease of the nonthermal power released in the accelerated\nelectrons, and thus to the reduction of the IC and synchrotron components of\nradiation close to the periastron. Although this effect alone cannot explain\nthe observed lightcurves, the Comptonization of the pulsar wind leads to the\nformation of gamma-radiation with a line-type energy spectrum.

There is a clear excess of QSOs near the minor axis with respect to\nthe major axis of nearby edge-on spiral galaxies, significant at a level\n3.5-sigma up to angular distances of 3 deg.

While earlier applications of the Wiener filter\nhave focused on estimation, namely suppressing the noise in the measured\nquantities, we extend the method here to perform both prediction and dynamical\nreconstruction. The Wiener filter is used to predict the values of unmeasured\nquantities, such as the density field in un-sampled regions of space, or to\ndeconvolve blurred data. The method is developed, within the context of linear\ngravitational instability theory, to perform dynamical reconstruction of one\nfield which is dynamically related to some other observed field. This is the\ncase, for example, in the reconstruction of the real space galaxy distribution\nfrom its redshift distribution When the field to be reconstructed is a Gaussian\nrandom field, such as the primordial perturbation field predicted by the\ncanonical model of cosmology, the Wiener filter can be pushed to its fullest\npotential.

The UV spectrum is consistent with a compact,\nmoderately- reddened starburst providing about half the UV light. Spectroscopy\nof the Halpha /[NII] line blend has enabled us to distinguish emission from the\nnarrow-line region of the Seyfert-2 and a moderately-reddened emission line\nregion which we argue is associated with the starburst. Estimates of the star\nformation rate from the UV continuum flux and the Halpha flux are broadly\nconsistent. We can explain the unusual emission line properties of F10214+4724\nin terms of conventional models for nearby Seyfert-2 galaxies if lensing is\npreferentially magnifying the side of the inner narrow-line region between the\nAGN and the observer, and the other side is both less magnified and partially\nobscured by the torus.

A particle approaching the black hole can bounce on the horizon back,\ninto the outside world, which drastically reduces the absorption cross section\nin the infrared region. Another, though related phenomenon takes place for\nparticles inside the horizon. A locked inside particle has, in fact, an\nopportunity to escape into the outside world.
