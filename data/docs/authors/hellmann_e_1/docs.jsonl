They have prominently featured in many interesting constructions in\nalgebraic geometry and number theory. There are several more associated\nelliptic K3 surfaces, obtained through base change of the Inose surface; these\nhave been previously studied by Kuwata.

For a generic curve $C$ in an\nample linear system $\\vert \\mathcal{L} \\vert$ on a toric surface $X$, a\nvanishing cycle of $C$ is an isotopy class of simple closed curve that can be\ncontracted to a point along a degeneration of $C$ to a nodal curve in $\\vert\n\\mathcal{L} \\vert$. The obstructions that prevent a simple closed curve in $C$\nfrom being a vanishing cycle are encoded by the adjoint line bundle $K_X\n\\otimes \\mathcal{L}$. In this paper, we consider the linear systems carrying\nthe two simplest types of obstruction. Geometrically, these obstructions\nmanifest on $C$ respectively as an hyperelliptic involution and as a Spin\nstructure. In both cases, we determine all the vanishing cycles by\ninvestigating the associated monodromy maps, whose target space is the mapping\nclass group $MCG(C)$. We show that the image of the monodromy is the subgroup\nof $MCG(C)$ preserving respectively the hyperelliptic involution and the Spin\nstructure.

In\nthis article we study mod $p$ reductions of irreducible rigid connections and\nestablish results which confirm Simpson's prediction. In particular, for large\n$p$, we prove that $p$-curvatures of mod $p$ reductions of irreducible rigid\nflat connections are nilpotent, and building on this result, we construct an\n$F$-isocrystalline realization for {irreducible} rigid flat connections.
