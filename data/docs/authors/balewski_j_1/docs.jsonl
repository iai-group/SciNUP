In this short note we\npoint out the consequences of the most straightforward embedding of this simple\npicture within low-energy SUSY, in which G_Dark breaking at the GeV scale\narises naturally through radiative corrections, or Planck-suppressed operators.\nThe theory predicts major additions to SUSY signals at the LHC. A completely\ngeneric prediction is that G_Dark particles can be produced in cascade decays\nof MSSM superpartners, since these end with pairs of MSSM LSP's that in turn\ndecay into the true LSP and other particles in the dark sector. In turn, the\nlightest GeV-scale dark Higgses and gauge bosons eventually decay back into\nlight SM states, and dominantly into leptons.

These sources properly account for the dimuons produced in\nproton-nucleus collisions. In this paper, we show that dimuons are also\nproduced in excess in 158 A GeV In-In collisions.

Based on the\nlatest hydrodynamical simulations, heavy r-process elements cannot be\nsynthesized in the neutrino-driven winds that follow the supernova explosion.\nHowever, by artificially increasing the wind entropy, elements up to A=195 can\nbe made. In this way one can reproduce the typical behavior of high-entropy\nejecta where the r-process is expected to occur. We identify which nuclear\nphysics input is more important depending on the dynamical evolution of the\nejecta. When the evolution proceeds at high temperatures (hot r-process), an\n(n,g)-(g,n) equilibrium is reached. While at low temperature (cold r-process)\nthere is a competition between neutron captures and beta decays. In the first\nphase of the r-process, while enough neutrons are available, the most relevant\nnuclear physics input are the nuclear masses for the hot r-process and the\nneutron capture and beta-decay rates for the cold r-process.

Partons losing enough energy may not even\nmake it out of the medium as identifiable jets (although the momentum will be\nshared among whatever particles are emitted). \"Full\" jet reconstruction\nattempts to determine the partonic energy loss as well as possible changes in\njet shape. Heavy ion collisions typically produce many unrelated particles\nwithin the jet \"cone,\" and subtraction of this background introduces\nsignificant uncertainties. A variety of techniques using high-$p_t$ particles,\nassumed to be leading particles from jet fragmentation, look for disappearance\nof jets and attenuation of jets relative to the reaction plane, as well as\nmedium modifications such as Mach cones. Those techniques have considerable\nuncertainty due to subtraction of $v_2$. In this paper we discuss minimum-bias\njets observed at RHIC using two-particle correlations. We find that jets\nproduced in p-p collisions have interesting properties. Peripheral A-A\ncollisions look like p-p collision. As we select more central collisions the\nnumber of jets increases following binary collision scaling until at a\nsystem-dependent centrality the number of particles associated with jets\nincreases substantially above this scaling.

Reaching this sensitivity will require a background rate of <1 count\ntonne^-1 y^-1 in a 4-keV-wide spectral region of interest surrounding the Q\nvalue of the decay. We investigate the overburden required to reach this\nbackground goal in a tonne-scale experiment with a compact (copper and lead)\nshield based on Monte Carlo calculations of cosmic-ray background rates. We\nfind that, in light of the presently large uncertainties in these types of\ncalculations, a site with an underground depth >~5200 mwe is required for a\ntonne-scale experiment with a compact shield similar to the planned 40-kg\nMAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR. The required overburden is highly dependent on the\nchosen shielding configuration and could be relaxed significantly if, for\nexample, a liquid cryogen and water shield, or an active neutron shield were\nemployed. Operation of the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR and GERDA detectors will serve\nto reduce the uncertainties on cosmic-ray background rates and will impact the\nchoice of shielding style and location for a future tonne-scale experiment.\n  4/2013: The peer review process revealed that one of the veto rejection\nfactors (the factor-of-4 described on p12) needs to be better established.

We find that this effect is enough to spoil quark number scaling\nin elliptic flow. A lack of scaling in data therefore does not signal the\nabsence of partonic degrees of freedom and hadronization by coalescence. In a\ncoalescing partonic fluid, however, elliptic flow of anti-baryons should be the\ngreater than that of baryons, since antibaryons contain a greater admixture of\npartons from the highly flowing midrapidity region.

In a Pb run with a 2.76 TeV-per-nucleon beam, sqrt(s_NN) is as\nhigh as 72 GeV.

This effect is the well-known\nEfimov effect. These three-body states (Efimov states) are found to be\nuniversal for ultracold atomic gases and the lowest Efimov state crosses the\nthree-body break-up threshold when the s-wave two-body scattering length is $a\n\\approx -9.73 r_{\\rm vdW}$, $r_{\\rm vdW}$ being the van der Waals length. This\narticle focuses on a generalized version of this Efimov scenario, where two of\nthe atoms are about to form a two-body d-wave dimer, which leads to strong\nd-wave interactions. In a recent paper [B. Gao, Phys. Rev. A. {\\bf 62},\n050702(R) (2000)], Bo Gao has predicted that for broad resonances the d-wave\ndimer is always formed near $a \\approx 0.956 r_{\\rm vdW}$.

The three-body effective potential curves that are crucial for\nunderstanding the recombination dynamics are also calculated and analyzed. An\nimproved method to calculate the couplings, effective potential curves, and\nrecombination rate coefficients is presented. \n\n"}

The transition is studied using the Polyakov loop model, with\nthe initial field configuration (in the confining phase) covering a small\nneighborhood of the confining vacuum $l \\simeq 0$, as appropriate for $T <\nT_c$. Quench is implemented by evolving this initial configuration with the\neffective potential at a temperature $T > T_c$. We study the formation of Z(3)\ndomain structure and its evolution during the transition as $l$ rolls down in\ndifferent directions from the top of the central hill in the effective\npotential of $l$. When explicit Z(3) symmetry breaking effects (arising from\ndynamical quark effects) are small, then we find well defined Z(3) domains\nwhich coarsen in time. Remarkably, the magnitude plot of $l$ shows vacuum\nbubble like configurations arising during the quench. This first order\ntransition like behavior occurs even though there is no metastable vacuum\nseparated by a barrier from the true vacuum for the parameter values used. When\nthe initial field configuration everywhere rolls down roughly along the same\ndirection (as will happen with large explicit symmetry breaking) then we do not\nfind such bubble-like configurations. However, in this case we find huge\noscillations of $l$ with large length scales. We show that such large\noscillations can lead to large fluctuations in the evolution of flow\nanisotropies compared to the equilibrium transition case. \n\n"}

The evidence for various forms of $l$ dependence of OMPs is\nreviewed and the importance of implementing these forms is evaluated. Existing\narguments and evidence for $l$ dependence are reviewed and new arguments and\ncalculations are introduced. The relationship is examined between (i) $l$\ndependence, and, (ii) the undularity (waviness) of $l$-independent potentials\nthat are $S$-matrix equivalent to $l$-dependent potentials. Such undularity is\na property of the dynamic polarisation potential (DPP) generated by the\ncoupling to reaction channels, or by coupling to excited states of the target\nor projectile nuclei. Various examples, particularly involving weakly bound\nprojectile nuclei, are presented. Such undularity also occurs in\n$l$-independent potentials that have been found in model independent fits to\nprecise wide angular range elastic scattering angular distributions. Cases of\nsuch phenomenological undularity, for both light and heavy ions, are referenced\nand shown to be related to undulatory properties of the dynamic polarisation\npotentials (DPPs) arising from channel coupling. Other forms of $l$ dependence,\nthat could be standard options in direct reaction codes, are noted. Of\nparticular importance are $l$ dependencies arising from full\nantisymmetrization. The case is made that reaction-induced $l$ dependence is a\ngeneral property of nucleon-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions and\nrepresents a valid extension of the nuclear optical model. \n\n"}

The measurement of jet spectra in p-Pb collisions\nprovides an important way to quantify the effects of cold nuclear matter on jet\nproduction, fragmentation and hadronization.

All of these effects\nare expected to have a significant dependence on the size of the nuclear target\nand the impact parameter of the collision, also known as the collision\ncentrality. In this article, we detail a method for determining centrality\nclasses in p(d)+A collisions via cuts on the multiplicity at backward rapidity\n(i.e., the nucleus-going direction) and for determining systematic\nuncertainties in this procedure. For d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV we\nfind that the connection to geometry is confirmed by measuring the fraction of\nevents in which a neutron from the deuteron does not interact with the nucleus.\nAs an application, we consider the nuclear modification factors R_{p(d)+A}, for\nwhich there is a potential bias in the measured centrality dependent yields due\nto auto-correlations between the process of interest and the backward rapidity\nmultiplicity.

Assuming time-reversal invariance, this asymmetry is\nstrictly zero for one-photon exchange. A non-zero $A_y$ can arise from the\ninterference between the one- and two-photon exchange processes which is\nsensitive to the details of the sub-structure of the nucleon. An experiment\nrecently completed at Jefferson Lab yielded asymmetries with high statistical\nprecision at $Q^{2}=$ 0.13, 0.46 and 0.97 GeV$^{2}$. These measurements\ndemonstrate, for the first time, that the $^3$He asymmetry is clearly non-zero\nand negative with a statistical significance of (8-10)$\\sigma$. Using measured\nproton-to-$^{3}$He cross-section ratios and the effective polarization\napproximation, neutron asymmetries of $-$(1-3)% were obtained. The neutron\nasymmetry at high $Q^2$ is related to moments of the Generalized Parton\nDistributions (GPDs). Our measured neutron asymmetry at $Q^2=0.97$ GeV$^2$\nagrees well with a prediction based on two-photon exchange using a GPD model\nand thus provides a new, independent constraint on these distributions. \n\n"}

For a given centrality class, the initial fluctuation spectrum\nis sensitive to the method chosen for binning the events into centrality\nclasses. We show that sorting events by total initial entropy or by total final\nmultiplicity yields event classes with equivalent statistical fluctuation\nproperties, in spite of viscous entropy production during the fireball\nevolution. With this initial entropy-based centrality definition we generate\nseveral classes of ultra-central Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energies and evolve\nthe events using viscous hydrodynamics with non-zero shear but vanishing bulk\nviscosity. Comparing the predicted anisotropic flow coefficients for charged\nhadrons with CMS data we find that both the Monte Carlo Glauber (MC-Glb) and\nMonte Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) models produce initial fluctuation\nspectra that are incompatible with the measured final anisotropic flow power\nspectrum, for any choice of the specific shear viscosity. In spite of this\nfailure, we show that the hydrodynamic model can qualitatively explain, in\nterms of event-by-event fluctuations of the anisotropic flow coefficients and\nflow angles, the breaking of flow factorization for elliptic, triangular and\nquadrangular flow measured by the CMS experiment. For elliptic flow, this\nfactorization breaking is large in ultra-central collisions.

Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction. Due to electron multiple scattering, this\nstrategy is not perfectly efficient on an event-by-event basis, but a\nstatistical estimator can be constructed which can be used to reject background\nevents by one order of magnitude at a moderate cost (approx. 30%) in signal\nefficiency. Combining this estimator with the excellent energy resolution and\ntopological signature identification characteristic of the HPXe TPC, it is\npossible to reach a background rate of less than one count per ton-year of\nexposure. Such a low background rate is an essential feature of the next\ngeneration of 0nbb experiments, aiming to fully explore the inverse hierarchy\nof neutrino masses. \n\n"}

We focus on noise-induced Fano coherences among the\nexcited states induced by incoherent driving of the V-system initially in the\nground state. For suddenly turned-on incoherent driving, the time evolution of\nthe coherences is determined by the damping parameter\n$\\zeta=\\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma_1+\\gamma_2)/\\Delta_p$, where $\\gamma_i$ are the\nradiative decay rates of the excited levels $i=1,2$, and\n$\\Delta_p=\\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + (1-p^2)\\gamma_1\\gamma_2}$ depends on the\nexcited-state level splitting $\\Delta>0$ and the angle between the transition\ndipole moments in the energy basis. The coherences oscillate as a function of\ntime in the underdamped limit ($\\zeta\\gg1$), approach a long-lived quasi-steady\nstate in the overdamped limit ($\\zeta\\ll 1$), and display an intermediate\nbehavior at critical damping ($\\zeta= 1$).

They are\nexpected to be useful to produce neutron-rich unstable nuclei. Nuclear dynamics\nleading to these processes depends sensitively on nuclear properties such as\ndeformation and shell structure. Purpose: We elucidate reaction mechanisms of\nMNT and QF processes involving heavy deformed nuclei, making detailed\ncomparisons between microscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations\nand measurements for the $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction. Methods:\nThree-dimensional Skyrme-TDHF calculations are performed. Particle-number\nprojection method is used to evaluate MNT cross sections from the TDHF wave\nfunction after collision.

Appropriately configured\nleadership-class facilities can play a transformational role in enabling\nscientific discovery from these datasets. 4) A close integration of HPC\nsimulation and data analysis will aid greatly in interpreting results from HEP\nexperiments. Such an integration will minimize data movement and facilitate\ninterdependent workflows. 5) Long-range planning between HEP and ASCR will be\nrequired to meet HEP's research needs.

We also use a model where the electron excites\na nucleon to a Delta, which then deexcites by interacting with a second\nnucleon.\n  The pion production model results in two protons very similar to those of the\nhammer events. These distributions are insensitive to the momentum of the $np$\npair that absorbed the $\\pi$. The incident neutrino energy can be reconstructed\nfrom just the outgoing lepton. The Delta process results in two protons that\nare less similar to the observed events.\n  ArgoNeut hammer events can be described by a simple pion production and\nreabsorption model. These hammer events in MicroBooNE can be used to determine\nthe incident neutrino energy but not to learn about SRC. We suggest that this\nreaction channel could be used for neutrino oscillation experiments to\ncomplement other channels with higher statistics but different systematic\nuncertainties. \n\n"}

The quality of such an operation is generally limited by\nenvironmental and control noise. One of the prime techniques for suppressing\nnoise is by dynamical decoupling, where one actively applies pulses at a rate\nthat is faster than the typical time scale of the noise. However, for\nboson-mediated gates, current dynamical decoupling schemes require executing\nthe pulses only when the boson and the quantum systems are disentangled. This\nrestriction implies an increase of the gate time by a factor of $\\sqrt{N}$,\nwith $N$ being the number of pulses applied.

The review is focused\non mesons which are sufficiently long-lived to potentially form meson-nucleus\nquasi-bound states.

It was found that, when the strength of a kind of interaction increases\nand crosses over a critical value, a specific type of state-transition will\noccur and will cause a jump in the total energy. Due to the jump, the energy of\nthe lowest symmetric state becomes considerably higher. This leaves a\nparticular opportunity for the lowest asymmetric state to replace the symmetric\nstates as the ground state. It was further found that the critical values are\nrelated to the singularity of either the matrix or a sub-matrix of the CGP.\nThese critical values are not arising from the TFA but inherent in the CGP, and\nthey can be analytically expressed. Furthermore, a model (in which two kinds of\natoms separated from each other asymmetrically) has been proposed for the\nevaluation of the energy of the lowest asymmetric state. With this model the\nemergence of the asymmetric ground state is numerically confirmed under the\nTFA.

Abstract: We show that uncertainties in the values of the surface heavy element\nabundances of the Sun are the largest source of the theoretical uncertainty in\ncalculating the p-p, pep, 8B, 13N, 15O, and 17F solar neutrino fluxes. We\nevaluate for the first time the sensitivity (partial derivative) of each solar\nneutrino flux with respect to the surface abundance of each element. We then\ncalculate the uncertainties in each neutrino flux using `conservative\n(preferred)' and `optimistic' estimates for the uncertainties in the element\nabundances. The total conservative (optimistic) composition uncertainty in the\npredicted 8B neutrino flux is 11.6% (5.0%) when sensitivities to individual\nelement abundances are used. The traditional method that lumps all abundances\ninto a single quantity (total heavy element to hydrogen ratio, Z/X) yields a\nlarger uncertainty, 20%.

Within reggeon field theory,\neach color-excited nucleon is associated with the unitarity cut of the pomeron\nexchanged between the projectile and nucleus. In this communication we derive\nthe unitarity rules for the multiplicity of excited nucleons, alias cut\npomerons, alias topological cross sections, for typical hard dijet production\nprocesses. We demonstrate how the coupled-channel non-Abelian intranuclear\nevolution of color dipoles, inherent to pQCD, gives rise to the reggeon field\ntheory diagrams for final states in terms of the uncut, and two kinds of cut,\npomerons. Upon the proper identification of the uncut and cut pomeron\nexchanges, the topological cross sections for dijet production follow in a\nstraightforward way from the earlier derived nonlinear k_t - factorization\nquadratures for the inclusive dijet cross sections.

We believe QCD to be as\nfundamental and complete as QED, the theory of electromagnetic interactions,\nwhose predictions have been tested to more than ten decimal places. If it were\npossible to make calculations in QCD the same way we can in QED, we would have\nremoved one of the biggest obstacles in the way of understanding matter in the\nuniverse. Unfortunately, the properties of QCD make such calculations\nimpossible at present. Historically, there have been two approaches to this\nproblem. First, we work to improve our ability to solve QCD, with the most\nvisible effort being the field of Lattice QCD. Second, we make models of QCD\nthat attempt to incorporate what we believe to be the most important\nsymmetries, dynamics, or degrees of freedom, and then test these models against\nexperimental measurements sensitive to these assumptions. Even the earliest\nquark models of hadrons structure and the simplest bag models have had great\nsuccess, far beyond any reasonable expectation, indicating that these models\nhave isolated some of the key features of QCD.

The possible connection between the presence of a\nfluctuation peak and the occurrence of a phase transition or a critical\nphenomenon is critically analyzed. Many different phenomena can lead both to\nthe creation and to the suppression of a fluctuation peak. In particular, the\nrole of constraints due to conservation laws and to data sorting is shown to be\nessential. From the experimental point of view, a comparison of the available\nfragmentation data reveals that there is a good agreement between different\ndata sets of basic fluctuation observables, if the fragmenting source is of\ncomparable size. This compatibility suggests that the fragmentation process is\nlargely independent of the reaction mechanism (central versus peripheral\ncollisions, symmetric versus asymmetric systems, light ions versus heavy ion\ninduced reactions). Configurational energy fluctuations, that may give\nimportant information on the heat capacity of the fragmenting system at the\nfreeze out stage, are not fully compatible among different data sets and\nrequire further analysis to properly account for Coulomb effects and secondary\ndecays. Some basic theoretical questions, concerning the interplay between the\ndynamics of the collision and the fragmentation process, and the cluster\ndefinition in dense and hot media, are still open and are addressed at the end\nof the paper. A comparison with realistic models and/or a quantitative analysis\nof the fluctuation properties will be needed to clarify in the next future the\nnature of the transition observed from compound nucleus evaporation to\nmulti-fragment production. \n\n"}

Anisotropic\nflow is obtained from the zeroes in the complex plane of a generating function\nof azimuthal correlations, in close analogy with the theory of phase\ntransitions by Lee and Yang. Flow is first estimated globally, i.e., averaged\nover the phase space covered by the detector, and then differentially, as a\nfunction of transverse momentum and rapidity for identified particles. The\ncorresponding estimates are less biased by nonflow correlations than with any\nother method. The practical implementation of the method is rather\nstraightforward. Furthermore, it automatically takes into account most\ncorrections due to azimuthal anisotropies in the detector acceptance. The main\nlimitation of the method is statistical errors, which can be significantly\nlarger than with the ``standard'' method of flow analysis if the flow and/or\nthe event multiplicities are too small. In practice, we expect this to be the\nmost accurate method to analyze directed and elliptic flow in fixed-target\nheavy-ion collisions between 100 MeV and 10 GeV per nucleon (at the Darmstadt\nSIS synchrotron and the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron), and\nelliptic flow at ultrarelativistic energies (at the Brookhaven Relativistic\nHeavy Ion Collider, and the forthcoming Large Hadron Collider at CERN). \n\n"}

We study the sensitivity of this\nconclusion to different hydrodynamic assumptions on chemical and thermal\nfreezeout after the sQGP hadronizes. We show that if chemical freezeout occurs\nat the hadronization time, the differential elliptic flow for pions increase\nwith proper time in the late hadronic phase until thermal freezeout and leads\nto a discrepancy with the data. In contrast, if both chemical and thermal\nequilibrium are maintained past the hadronization, then the mean pT per pion\nincreases in a way that accidentally preserves v2(pT) from the sQGP phase in\nagreement with the data, but at the cost of the agreement with the hadronic\nyields.

In the simplest\ncase of only one molecular state, corresponding to either a Feshbach resonance\nor one-color photoassociation, the system displays Rabi oscillations and rapid\nadiabatic passage between a Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms and fermionic\nmolecules. For two-color photoassociation, the system admits stimulated Raman\nadiabatic passage (STIRAP) from a Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms to stable Fermi\nmolecules, even in the presence of particle-particle interactions. By tailoring\nthe STIRAP sequence it is possible to deliberately convert only a fraction of\nthe initial atoms, leaving a finite fraction of bosons behind to induce\natom-molecule Cooper pairing via density fluctuations; unfortunately, this\nenhancement is insufficient to achieve a superfluid transition with present\nultracold technology. We therefore propose the use of an association resonance\nthat converts atoms and diatomic molecules (dimers) into triatomic molecules\n(trimers), which leads to a crossover from a Bose-Einstein condensate of\ntrimers to atom-dimer Cooper pairs.

{"id": "quant-ph/0411145", "contents": "Title: Quantum Zeno effect by general measurements Abstract: It was predicted that frequently repeated measurements on an unstable quantum\nstate may alter the decay rate of the state. This is called the quantum Zeno\neffect (QZE) or the anti-Zeno effect (AZE), depending on whether the decay is\nsuppressed or enhanced. In conventional theories of the QZE and AZE, effects of\nmeasurements are simply described by the projection postulate, assuming that\neach measurement is an instantaneous and ideal one. However, real measurements\nare not instantaneous and ideal. For the QZE and AZE by such general\nmeasurements, interesting and surprising features have recently been revealed,\nwhich we review in this article. The results are based on the quantum\nmeasurement theory, which is also reviewed briefly. As a typical model, we\nconsider a continuous measurement of the decay of an excited atom by a\nphotodetector that detects a photon emitted from the atom upon decay. This\nmeasurement is an indirect negative-result one, for which the curiosity of the\nQZE and AZE is emphasized. It is shown that the form factor is renormalized as\na backaction of the measurement, through which the decay dynamics is modified.\nIn a special case of the flat response, where the detector responds to every\nphoton mode with an identical response time, results of the conventional\ntheories are reproduced qualitatively. However, drastic differences emerge in\ngeneral cases where the detector responds only to limited photon modes. For\nexample, against predictions of the conventional theories, the QZE or AZE may\ntake place even for states that exactly follow the exponential decay law.
