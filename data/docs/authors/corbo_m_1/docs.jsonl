The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S}$\ndecay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective\n$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct\nCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the\nlatter. (iii) For $B\\to K\\pi\\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonant\ncontributions in $K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\bar K^0\\pi^+\\pi^-$ modes, in agreement\nwith the Belle measurements but larger than the BaBar result. \n\n"}

Unlike the often studied Z' cases, in this framework, there are\nthree neutral gauge bosons due to the underlying SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_X\ngauge group in the bulk. Furthermore, couplings of these KK states to light\nquarks and leptons are suppressed, whereas those to top and bottom quarks are\nenhanced compared to the SM gauge couplings. Therefore, the production of light\nquark and lepton states is suppressed relative to other beyond the SM\nconstructions, and the fermionic decays of these states are dominated by the\ntop and bottom quarks, which are, though, overwhelmed by KK gluons dominantly\ndecaying into them.

Methods: We calculate the neutrino flux from $\\beta$\nprocesses using nuclear statistical equilibrium abundances convoluted with\napproximate neutrino spectra of the individual nuclei and the thermal neutrino\nspectrum (pair+plasma). Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation.

Here, we explore the prospect for corroboration of this\nsuggestion from 5 additional CMS&ATLAS search strategies targeting the\nproduction of light stops & gluinos at lower jet counts, which variously depend\non heavy flavor tagging and the inclusion or exclusion of associated leptons.\nThe current operating phase of the 7TeV LHC is highly conducive to the\nproduction of gluinos & light stops, given the supersymmetric particle mass\nhierarchy M_t_1<M_g<M_q that naturally evolves from the dynamics of the model\nnamed No-Scale FSU5 that we presently study. Moreover, some tension persists\nagainst the SM data-driven and MC generated background predictions in certain\nLHC searches of this variety. We demonstrate that the 1-sigma overlap of the\nallowed supersymmetric event production for these seven search methodologies\nroundly envelops the most favorable phenomenological subspace of FSU5, while\nhandily generating a 125GeV Higgs boson mass. In order to test the statistical\nsignificance of any correlations across the simulated FSU5 collider response in\nthese seven search strategies, we implement a multi-axis chi^2 fitting\nprocedure, yielding a best overall match in the vicinity of M1/2=610GeV,\ncorresponding to light stop & gluino masses of approximately 665GeV and 830GeV.\nConsequently, we suggest that FSU5 is a better global fit to the studied LHC\ndata than the SM alone, and moreover that its predictions appear to be\nmeaningfully correlated with observed low-statistics excesses across a wide\nvariety of specialized search strategies.

In events with associated production of invisible\nparticles and hadronic jets, the measurement of the imbalance in transverse\nmomentum of the final state particles is the major leverage to reject the\notherwise dominant source of backgrounds in hadron colliders, i.e. the generic\nproduction of many jets by QCD interactions.

We check the validity of this technique in data\nand Monte Carlo simulations in a broad range of topologies, starting from the\nsimplest, with two jets in the final state, to the ones with very large jet\nmultiplicities.

This raises the\nquestion of whether there are interesting deca-TeV models for which the LHC may\nfind direct clues. A possible scenario for such physics is a 5D warped model of\nfermion masses and mixing, with Kaluza-Klein masses m_KK ~ 10 TeV, allowing it\nto avoid tension with stringent constraints, especially from flavor data.\nDiscovery of a Standard-Model-like Higgs boson, for which there are some hints\nat ~125 GeV at the LHC, would also require the KK masses to be at or above 10\nTeV. These warped models generically predict the appearance of a much lighter\nradion scalar. We find that, in viable warped models of flavor, a radion with a\nmass of a few hundred GeV and an inverse coupling of order m_KK ~ 10 TeV could\ntypically be accessible to the LHC experiments -- with sqrt(s) = 14 TeV and 100\nfb^-1 of data. The above statements can be applied, mutatis mutandis, to 4D\ndual models, where conformal dynamics and a dilaton replace warping and the\nradion, respectively.

In such statistically limited searches,\ndatasets are often amassed over periods of several years, during which the\ntrigger characteristics evolve and system performance can vary significantly.\nReliable production cross-section measurements and upper limits must take into\naccount a detailed understanding of the effective trigger inefficiency for\nevery selected candidate event.

Specifically, it\nis concerned with the ability of such a detector to detect muons of the\nopposite sign to those stored (wrong-sign muons) while suppressing\ncontamination of the signal from the interactions of other neutrino species in\nthe beam. A new more realistic simulation and analysis, which improves the\nefficiency of this detector at low energies, has been developed using the GENIE\nneutrino event generator and the GEANT4 simulation toolkit.

For the first\nproblem where experimental data have already been observed, the classical\nstatistical analysis involves constructing confidence intervals for the\nparameter {\\Delta}m^2_{32}. These intervals are deduced from the parent\ndistribution of the estimation of {\\Delta}m^2_{32} based on experimental data.\nDue to existing experimental constraints on |{\\Delta}m^2_{32}|, the estimation\nof {\\Delta}m^2_{32} is better approximated by a Bernoulli distribution (a\nBinomial distribution with 1 trial) rather than a Gaussian distribution.\nTherefore, the Feldman-Cousins approach needs to be used instead of the\nGaussian approximation in constructing confidence intervals.

Abstract: After the discovery of the Higgs-like boson by the LHC 2012 it is the most\nimportant task to check whether this new particle is the Standard Model Higgs\nboson or something else. In this paper, we study whether the 125 GeV boson\ncould be the pseudo-Goldstone boson of Little Higgs models. We derive limits on\nthe parameter space of several Little Higgs models (simple group and product\ngroup models, with and without T-parity), both from the experimental data from\nATLAS and CMS about the different Higgs discovery channel and the electroweak\nprecision observables. We perform a fit of several Little Higgs models to all\nelectroweak parameters from measurements of SLC, LEP, Tevatron, and LHC.

We discuss the idea of using the\nMAC-E-Filter in a time-of-flight mode (MAC-E-TOF) in which the neutrino mass is\ndetermined by a measurement of the electron time-of-flight (TOF) spectrum that\ndepends on the neutrino mass. MAC-E-TOF spectroscopy here is a very sensitive\nmethod since the $\\beta$-electrons are slowed down to distinguishable\nvelocities by the MAC-E-Filter. Their velocity depends strongly on their\nsurplus energy above the electric retarding potential. Using MAC-E-TOF, a\nstatistical sensitivity gain is expected. Because a small number of\nretarding-potential settings is sufficient for a complete measurement, in\ncontrast to about 40 different retarding potentials used in the standard\nMAC-E-Filter mode, there is a gain in measurement time and hence statistical\npower.

Among the specific\nfeatures of the method are the simultaneous determination of up to 200,000\nalignment parameters with tracks, the measurement of individual sensor\ncurvature parameters, the control of systematic misalignment effects, and the\nimplementation of the whole procedure in a multi-processor environment for high\nexecution speed. Overall, the achieved statistical accuracy on the module\nalignment is found to be significantly better than 10 micrometers. \n\n"}

The spin\nmixing mechanism allows to extract D-wave observables from the CERN data.\nAnalysis of the full D-wave subsystem for transversity tau=u reveals rho^0(770)\nmixing in the amplitudes |D^U_u|^2 and |D^N_u|^2 and a violation of a cosine\ncondition by the amplitudes D^2U_u and D^2N_u. We determine spin mixing and\nS-matrix helicity amplitudes from which we calculate pipi phase-shifts\ndelta^0_S and delta_P below KKbar threshold. The spin mixing and the violation\nof the cosine condition arise from a non-standard pure dephasing interaction of\nthe produced final S-matrix state rho_f(S) with a quantum state rho(E) of a\nquantum environment to produce the observed state rho_f(O). Our analysis\ndetermines that the number of interacting degrees of freedom of the environment\nis M=4.

The top quark spin can be deduced by studying angular\ndistributions of the decay products. The Standard Model predicts the\ntop/anti-top quark ($t\\bar{t}$) pairs to have correlated spins. The degree is\nsensitive to the spin and the production mechanisms of the top quark. Measuring\nthe spin correlation allows to test the predictions.

Due to their heavy mass, charm quarks are expected to\nthermalize much more slowly than light flavor quarks. The charm quark flow is a\nunique tool to study the extent of thermalization of the bulk medium dominated\nby light quarks and gluons. At high $p_T$, D meson azimuthal anisotropy is\nsensitive to the path length dependence of charm quark energy loss in the\nmedium, which offers new insights into heavy quark energy loss mechanisms -\ngluon radiation vs. collisional processes. We present the STAR measurement of\nelliptic flow ($v_2$) of $D^0$ and $D^{\\pm}$ mesons in Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, for a wide transverse momentum range.

In this work, we assess\nin the light of current data and of expected experimental sensitivities, the\nprospects for the detection of a neutrino signal from dark matter annihilations\nin the Sun. To be as general as possible, equilibrium between the capture and\nthe annihilation rates in the Sun is not assumed in our analysis; instead, the\ndark matter scattering and annihilation cross sections are taken as free and\nindependent parameters.

In this paper, we consider collider signatures\nof heavy pseudo-Dirac neutrinos in the context of inverse seesaw scenario, with\na sizable mixing with the SM neutrinos under two different flavor structures,\nviz., Flavor Diagonal (FD) and Flavor Non-Diagonal (FND) scenarios. For the\nlatter scenario we use a general parametrization for the model parameters by\nintroducing an arbitrary orthogonal matrix and nonzero Dirac and Majorana\nphases.

We propagate the charm quarks and the D\nmesons following a previously applied Langevin dynamics. The evolution of the\nbackground medium is modeled in two different ways: (I) we use the UrQMD\nhydrodynamics + Boltzmann transport hybrid approach including a phase\ntransition to QGP and (II) with the coarse-graining approach employing also an\nequation of state with QGP. The latter approach has previously been used to\ndescribe di-lepton data at various energies very successfully. This comparison\nallows us to explore the effects of partial thermalization and viscous effects\non the charm propagation.

{"id": "1812.05111", "contents": "Title: Sorting out quenched jets Abstract: We introduce a new 'quantile' analysis strategy to study the modification of\njets as they traverse through a droplet of quark-gluon plasma. To date, most\njet modification studies have been based on comparing the jet properties\nmeasured in heavy-ion collisions to a proton-proton baseline at the same\nreconstructed jet transverse momentum ($p_T$). It is well known, however, that\nthe quenching of jets from their interaction with the medium leads to a\nmigration of jets from higher to lower $p_T$, making it challenging to directly\ninfer the degree and mechanism of jet energy loss. Our proposed quantile\nmatching procedure is inspired by (but not reliant on) the approximate\nmonotonicity of energy loss in the jet $p_T$. In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$). Furthermore, despite non-monotonic fluctuations in the energy\nloss, we use an event generator to validate the strong correlation between the\n$p_T$ of the parton that initiates a heavy-ion jet and the $p_T$ of the vacuum\njet which corresponds to it via the quantile procedure ($p_T^{\\rm quant}$). We\ndemonstrate that this strategy both provides a complementary way to study jet\nmodification and mitigates the effect of $p_T$ migration in heavy-ion\ncollisions. \n\n"}

For this data we find an upper limit\non the sum of active neutrino mass eigenstates of \\sum m_nu < 1.0 eV (95%\nconf.), but this limit is dependent on priors.

The\npolarizability measurement will provide an important new test of QCD chiral\ndynamics. The studies of quark-antiquark-gluon hybrid mesons would improve our\nunderstanding of these exotic mesons. COMPASS may improve previous Primakoff\npolarizability and Hybrid studies by two to three orders of magnitude.\n  Appendixes A (Pion and Kaon Polarizabilities at COMPASS) and B (Hybrid Meson\nStructure at COMPASS) of this contribution include evaluations submitted to the\nAPS DNP Town Meeting White Paper Committee. These summarize (1) the fundamental\nscientific issues addressed, (2) major achievements since the last DNP long\nrange plan, (3) the short and long term U.S. outlook, (4) comparison of U.S.\nand global effort, (5) other issues. \n\n"}

In particular, we refer to a high-luminosity (L ~ 3 x 10^34\ncm^-2 s^-1) machine, and use detailed simulation tools for a proposed detector.\nAmong the GMSB-model building options, we define a simple framework and outline\nits predictions at the LC, under the assumption that no SUSY signal is detected\nat LEP or Tevatron. Our focus is on the case where a neutralino (N1) is the\nnext-to-lightest SUSY particle (NLSP), for which we determine the relevant\nregions of the GMSB parameter space. Many observables are calculated and\ndiscussed, including production cross sections, NLSP decay widths, branching\nratios and distributions, for dominant and rare channels. We sketch how to\nextract the messenger and electroweak scale model parameters from a spectrum\nmeasured via, e.g. threshold-scanning techniques.
