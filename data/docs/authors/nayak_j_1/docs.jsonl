The empirical observation of constituent quark ``$n_q$'' scaling of\nelliptic flow is juxtaposed with the lack of such scaling behavior in\nhydrodynamic fluid calculations followed by Cooper-Frye freeze-out to hadrons.\nA ``quasi-particle transport'' time stage after viscous effects break down the\nhydrodynamic fluid stage, but prior to hadronization, is proposed to reconcile\nthese apparent contradictions.

Simultaneously, the model\nserves as a theoretical laboratory for studying diverse general features of\nQPTs in interacting many-body systems, which differ in many respects from\nlattice models of solid-state physics. We outline the most important fields of\nthe present interest: (a) The coexistence of first- and second-order phase\ntransitions supports studies related to the microscopic origin of the QPT\nphenomena.

We solve the eigenvalue problem of the\nPethick-Pitaevskii-type internal density matrix and find a fragmented\ncondensate. On the contrary the condensate Jacobi-type internal density matrix\ngives complete condensation into a single state. The internal one-particle\ndensity matrix is, therefore, shown to be different in general for different\nchoices of the internal coordinate system. We propose two physically motivated\ncriteria for the choice of the adequate coordinate systems which give us a\nunique answer for the internal one-particle density matrix. One criterion is\nthat in the infinite particle number limit ($N=\\infty$) the internal\none-particle density matrix should have the same eigenvalues and eigenfunctions\nas those of the corresponding ideal Bose-Einstein condensate in the laboratory\nframe. The other criterion is that the coordinate of the internal one-particle\ndensity matrix should be orthogonal to the remaining $(N - 2)$ internal\ncoordinates.

Since the anomalous\npeak exists in the dijet-mass region of 140 GeV with the p-pbar center-of-mass\nenergy sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, a relevant momentum fraction x of partons is roughly\n0.1. In this x region, recent HERMES semi-inclusive charged-lepton scattering\nexperiment indicated that the strange-quark distribution could be very\ndifferent from a conventional one, which has been used for many years, based on\nopposite-sign dimuon measurements in neutrino-induced deep inelastic\nscattering. We investigated effects of such variations in the strange-quark\ndistribution s(x) on the anomaly. We found that distributions of W+dijets and\nother process are affected by the strange-quark modifications in wide\ndijet-mass regions including the 140 GeV one. Since the CDF anomaly was\nobserved in the shoulder region of the dijet-mass distribution, a slight\nmodification of the distribution shape could explain at least partially the CDF\nexcess. Therefore, it is important to consider such effects within the standard\nmodel for judging whether the CDF anomaly indicates new physics beyond the\nstandard model.

This is\nachieved by integrating out in sequence the scales that characterize a NR bound\nstate and those that are typical of a thermal medium, in the possible\nhierarchies that are relevant for quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma. Within\nthis framework we show how the potential that governs the evolution of the\nquark-antiquark pair is derived from QCD in a modern and rigorous way, thereby\nbridging the gap between phenomenological potential models and QCD.

In particular, data from neutrino experiments with broad energy\ndistributions require complex theoretical models that are able to take all the\nrelevant channels into account as well as incorporate nuclear effects in both\ninitial and final-state interactions. Purpose: We investigate neutrino and\nantineutrino scattering on iron and carbon in the energy range from 1 to 30\nGeV, which is relevant to current and coming experiments (MINOS, NOvA, and\nMinerva). Method: The Giessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model,\nwhich implements all reaction channels relevant for neutrino energies under\nconsideration, is used for an investigation of neutrino-nucleus reactions.\nResults: Our calculations are compared with the recent NOMAD and MINOS data for\nthe integrated inclusive cross sections.

Conclusions: Nuclear effects in the\ninitial-state interactions may slightly change the inclusive nuclear cross\nsection as compared to the free nucleon ones. Final-state interactions\nnoticeably change the spectra of the outgoing hadrons.

Understanding the\nsensitivity of these observables to properties of the deconfined medium and to\nexperimental factors is vital if dijets are to be useful for QCD tomography.\nVNI/BMS provides a controllable test-bed with sufficient complexity to model\njet modification without confounding results with fluctuations from\nhydrodynamics and hadronization. Dijets are examined under the modification of:\nthe jet transport coefficient $\\hat{q}$; the path length of leading and\nsub-leading jets; jet cone angle and the jet-medium interaction mechanism. We\nfind that $A_j$ is very sensitive to the distance traveled by the secondary\njet, the jet shape is dominated by $\\hat{q}$ and the nature of the interaction\nmechanism. \n\n"}

For nanoflakes\nwith such reczag defective edges, emphasis is placed on topological aspects and\nconnections underlying the patterns dominating these spectra. The electronic\nspectra of trigonal graphene nanoflakes with reczag edge terminations exhibit\ncertain unique features, in addition to those that are well known to appear for\ngraphene dots with zigzag edge termination. These unique features include\nbreaking of the particle-hole symmetry, and they are associated with nonlinear\ndispersion of the energy as a function of momentum, which may be interpreted as\nnonrelativistic behavior. The general topological features shared with the\nzigzag flakes include the appearance of energy gaps at zero and low magnetic\nfields due to finite size, the formation of relativistic Landau levels at high\nmagnetic fields, and the presence between the Landau levels of edge states (the\nsocalled Halperin states) associated with the integer quantum Hall effect.\nTopological regimes, unique to the reczag nanoflakes, appear within a stripe of\nnegative energies E_b < E < 0, and along a separate feature forming a\nconstant-energy line outside this stripe. The lower bound (E_b) specifying the\nenergy stripe is independent of size. A main finding concerns the limited\napplicability of the continuous Dirac-Weyl equation, since the latter does not\nreproduce the special reczag features.

The photons produced in the QGP\ncontribute slightly less then 50% to the observed spectrum, but have small v2.\nWe find that the large direct photon v2 - comparable to that of hadrons - can\nbe attributed to the intermediate hadronic scattering channels not subtracted\nfrom the data when following the same extraction procedure for v2 as in the\nPHENIX experiment. On the other hand the v2 of direct photons - as evaluated by\nthe weighted average of direct photon channels - gives a lower signal. The\ndifference between the two extraction procedures for the direct photon v2 can\nbe attributed to different definitions for the yield ratio of direct photons to\nthe background photons.

The faithfulness of the estimated\nmomenta to the true momenta is then tested in observables sensitive to top\npolarization and t-tbar spin correlations. Our method thereby provides a novel\napproach towards the evaluation of these observables, and towards testing\nt-tbar production beyond the level of the total cross section. While our\ndiscussion is confined to t-tbar production as a benchmark, the method is\napplicable to any process whose decay topology allows to construct MT2. \n\n"}

The first set of questions come with the\nnon-relativistic theory based on the Navier-Stokes equations. Starting from\nsmooth initial conditions, the purpose is to understand if solutions of\nNavier-Stokes equations remain smooth with the time evolution. Existence for\njust a finite time would imply the evolution of finite time singularities,\nwhich would have a major influence on the development of turbulent phenomena.\nThe second set of questions come with the relativistic theory of hydrodynamics.\nThere is an accumulating evidence that this theory may be relevant for the\ndescription of the medium created in high energy heavy-ion collisions. However,\nthis is not clear that the fundamental hypotheses of hydrodynamics are valid in\nthis context. Also, the determination of initial conditions remains\nquestionable.

The origin of this fusion hindrance has not been well\nunderstood from a microscopic point of view. Purpose: Analyze the fusion\ndynamics in heavy systems by a microscopic reaction model and understand the\norigin of the fusion hindrance. Method: We employ the time-dependent\nHartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. We extract nucleus--nucleus potential and energy\ndissipation by the method combining TDHF dynamics of the entrance channel of\nfusion reactions with one-dimensional Newton equation including a dissipation\nterm. Then, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance using the properties\nof the extracted potential and energy dissipation. Results: Extracted\npotentials show monotonic increase as the relative distance of two nuclei\ndecreases, which induces the disappearance of an ordinary barrier structure of\nthe potential. This is different from those in light- and medium-mass systems\nand from density-constraint TDHF calculations. Extracted friction coefficients\nshow sizable energy dependence and universal value of their magnitude, which\nare rather similar to those in light- and medium-mass systems. Using these\nproperties, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance and find that\ncontribution of the increase in potential to the extra-push energy is larger\nthan that of the accumulated dissipation energy in most systems studied in this\narticle. Conclusions: By the analysis of the origin of the fusion hindrance, we\nconclude that, as the system becomes heavier, the dynamical increase in\npotential at small relative distances plays a more important role than the\ndissipation during the fusion reaction for understanding the origin of the\nfusion hindrance. \n\n"}

Describing the\nprocesses which involve such states requires the use of a statistical theory.\nElectron capture into these 'compound resonances' leads to electron-ion\nrecombination rates that are orders of magnitude greater than those of direct,\nradiative recombination, and cannot be described by standard theories of\ndielectronic recombination.

Theoretical Framework Abstract: We develop a theoretical approach for nuclear spectral functions at high\nmissing momenta and removal energies based on the multi-nucleon short-range\ncorrelation~(SRC) model. The approach is based on the effective Feynman\ndiagrammatic method which allows to account for the relativistic effects\nimportant in the SRC domain. In addition to two-nucleon SRC with center of mass\nmotion we derive also the contribution of three-nucleon SRCs to the nuclear\nspectral functions. The latter is modeled based on the assumption that 3N SRCs\nare a product of two sequential short range NN interactions. This approach\nallowed us to express the 3N SRC part of the nuclear spectral function as a\nconvolution of two NN SRCs. Thus the knowledge of 2N SRCs allows us to model\nboth two- and three-nucleon SRC contributions to the spectral function. The\nderivations of the spectral functions are based on the two theoretical\nframeworks in evaluating covariant Feynman diagrams: In the first, referred as\nvirtual nucleon approximation, we reduce Feynman diagrams to the time ordered\nnoncovariant diagrams by evaluating nucleon spectators in the SRC at their\npositive energy poles, neglecting explicitly the contribution from vacuum\ndiagrams.

The CGC\nformalism takes into account the dynamics of large gluon densities at small $x$\nand has been successfully applied to Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and\nparticle production in high energy hadronic and nuclear collisions in the small\n$x$ kinematic region. The effective degrees of of freedom in CGC are Wilson\nlines which enter in the effective quark (and gluon) propagators and re-sum\nmultiple soft scatterings from the small $x$ gluon field of the target. It is\nhowever known that the CGC effective theory breaks down when one probes the\nmoderately large $x$ (high $p_t$) kinematics where collinear factorization and\nDGLAP evolution of parton distribution functions should be the right framework.\nHere we propose a general framework which may allow one to eventually unify the\ntwo approaches and to calculate pQCD cross sections in both small and large\nBjorken $x$ regions. We take the first step towards this goal by deriving an\nexpression for the quark propagator in a background field which includes\nscatterings from both small and large $x$ modes of the gluon field of the\ntarget.

The microscopic origin of condensation and phase separations Abstract: Microcanonical Thermodynamics allows the application of Statistical Mechanics\non one hand to closed finite and even small systems and on the other to the\nlargest,self-gravitating ones. However, one has to reconsider the fundamental\nprinciples of Statistical Mechanics especially its key quantity, entropy.\nWhereas in conventional Thermostatistics the homogeneity and extensivity of the\nsystem and the concavity of its entropy S(E) are central conditions, these fail\nfor the systems considered here. E.g. at phase separation the entropy S(E) is\nnecessarily convex to make e^{S(E)-E/T} bimodal in E (the two coexisting\nphases). This is so even for normal macroscopic systems with short-range\ncoupling. As inhomogeneities and surface effects in particular cannot be scaled\naway,one has to be careful with the standard arguments of splitting a system\ninto two or bringing two systems into thermal contact. Not only the volume part\nof the entropy must be considered.

Moreover, it has recently been\nverified that for normal nuclear systems, it is possible to expand the\neffective Lagrangian systematically in powers of the meson fields (and their\nderivatives) and to truncate the expansion reliably after the first few orders.\nUsing a mean-field version of the energy functional, accurate quantitative\nresults are obtained for the bulk and single-particle properties of medium- and\nheavy-mass nuclei.

The extensive body of work at zero temperature and chemical potential\nis represented by a selection of contemporary studies that focus on solving the\nBethe-Salpeter equation, deriving an exact mass formula in QCD that describes\nlight and heavy pseudoscalar mesons simultaneously, and the calculation of the\nelectromagnetic pion form factor and the vector meson electroproduction cross\nsections. These applications emphasise the qualitative importance of the\nmomentum-dependent dressing of elementary Schwinger functions in QCD, which\nprovides a unifying connection between disparate phenomena. They provide a\nsolid foundation for an extension of the approach to nonzero temperature and\nchemical potential. The essential, formal elements of this application are\ndescribed and four contemporary studies employed to exemplify the method and\nits efficacy. They study the demarcation of the phase boundary for\ndeconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration, the calculation of bulk\nthermodynamic properties of the quark-gluon plasma and the response of pi- and\nrho-meson observables to T and mu. Along the way a continuum order parameter\nfor deconfinement is introduced, an anticorrelation between the response of\nmasses and decay constants to T and their response to mu elucidated, and a\n(T,mu)-mirroring of the slow approach of bulk thermodynamic quantities to their\nultrarelativistic limit highlighted. These effects too are tied to the\nmomentum-dependent dressing of the elementary Schwinger functions. \n\n"}
