{"id": "0704.1928", "contents": "Title: Highly turbulent solutions of LANS-alpha and their LES potential Abstract: We compute solutions of the Lagrangian-Averaged Navier-Stokes alpha-model\n(LANS) for significantly higher Reynolds numbers (up to Re 8300) than have\npreviously been accomplished. This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either\nfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a\nformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude\nLANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow. \n\n"}

We\ntherefore introduce a `2+epsilon' dimensional model of pipe flow which is a\nminimal 3-dimensionalisation of the axisymmetric case: only sinusoidal\nvariation in azimuth plus azimuthal shifts are retained, yet the same dynamics\nfamiliar from experiments are found.

The CH equation has been recently extended to a two-component\nintegrable system (CH2), which includes both velocity and density variables in\nthe dynamics.

In the focus of this paper\nlies a simplicial complex K_P which carries complete information about the\ncombinatorial type of P. In the case when P is simple, K_P is the same as dP*,\nwhere P* is a polar dual polytope. Using the canonical embedding of a polytope\nP into nonnegative orthant, we introduce a moment-angle space Z_P for a\npolytope P. It is known, that in the case when P is simple the space Z_P is\nhomeomorphic to the polyhedral product (D^2,S^1)^{K_P}. When P is not simple,\nwe prove that the space Z_P is homotopically equivalent to the space\n(D^2,S^1)^{K_P}. This allows to introduce bigraded Betti numbers for any convex\npolytope. A Stanley-Reisner ring of a polytope P can be defined as a\nStanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex K_P. All these considerations lead\nto a natural question: which simplicial complexes arise as K_P for some\npolytope P? We have proceeded in this direction by introducing a notion of a\npolytopic simplicial complex. It has the following property: link of each\nsimplex in a polytopic complex is either contractible, or retractible to a\nsubcomplex, homeomorphic to a sphere. The complex K_P is a polytopic simplicial\ncomplex for any polytope P. Links of so called face simplices in a polytopic\ncomplex are polytopic complexes as well. This fact is sufficient enough to\nconnect face polynomial of a simplicial complex K_P to the face polynomial of a\npolytope P, giving a series of inequalities on certain combinatorial\ncharacteristics of P. Two of these inequalities are equalities for each P and\nrepresent Euler-Poincare formula and one of Bayer-Billera relations for flag\nf-numbers.

Therefore\nunderstanding of properties and dynamics of this `basic' state is important for\ninvestigation of more complex phenomena, formation and development of observed\nphenomena in the photosphere and atmosphere. For characterization of the\nturbulent properties we compare kinetic energy spectra on granular and\nsub-granular scales obtained from infrared TiO observations with the New Solar\nTelescope (Big Bear Solar Observatory) and from 3D radiative MHD numerical\nsimulations ('SolarBox' code).

The canonical\nrepresentation of the frame matroid of a complete graph is also known as a\nDowling geometry, as it was first introduced by Dowling for finite groups.\n  In this paper, we extend these matroids in two ways. The first one is\nextending the rank function of each matroid, based on submodular functions over\nG. The resulting rank function generalizes that of the union of frame matroids\nor lift matroids.

An r-wall\nis obtained from a (2r x r)-grid by deleting every odd vertical edge in every\nodd row and every even vertical edge in every even row, then deleting the two\nresulting vertices of degree one, and finally subdividing edges arbitrarily.\nThe vertices of degree two that existed before the subdivision are called the\npegs of the r-wall. Let G be a graph with no K_t minor, and let W be an R-wall\nin G. We prove that there exist a subset A of V(G) of size at most 12288t^{24}\nand an r-subwall W' of W such that V(W') is disjoint from A and W' is a flat\nwall in G-A in the following sense.

A systematic procedure for deriving an equation\nfor surface elevation for a prescribed relation between the orders of the two\nexpansion parameters, the amplitude parameter $\\alpha$ and the long wavelength\n(or shallowness) parameter $\\beta$, is developed. Unlike the heuristic\napproaches found in the literature, when modifications are made in the equation\nfor surface elevation itself, the procedure starts from the consistently\ntruncated asymptotic expansions for unidirectional waves, a counterpart of the\nBoussinesq system of equations for the surface elevation and the bottom\nvelocity, from which the leading order and higher order equations for the\nsurface elevation can be obtained by iterations. The relations between the\norders of the two small parameters are taken in the form $\\beta=O(\\alpha^n)$\nand $\\alpha=O(\\beta^m)$ with $n$ and $m$ specified to some important particular\ncases. The analysis shows, in particular, that some evolution equations,\nproposed before as model equations in other physical contexts (like the Gardner\nequation, the modified KdV equation, and the so-called 5th-order KdV equation),\ncan emerge as the leading order equations in the asymptotic expansion for the\nunidirectional water waves, on equal footing with the KdV equation.

This makes analytic\npredictions for a range of quantities including: distributions of grain\ndensities, power spectra and correlation functions of fluctuations, and maximum\ngrain densities reached. We predict how these scale as a function of grain drag\ntime t_stop, spatial scale, grain-to-gas mass ratio, strength of turbulence\n(alpha), and detailed disk properties. We test these against numerical\nsimulations with various turbulence-driving mechanisms. The simulations agree\nwell with the predictions, spanning t_stop*Omega ~ 1e-4 - 10, alpha ~ 1e-10 -\n1e-2, and grain-to-gas mass ratio ~0-3.

The infinitesimal rigidity of body-bar frameworks can naturally be\nformulated in the language of the exterior (or Grassmann) algebra. Using this\nalgebraic formulation, we derive symmetry-adapted rigidity matrices to analyze\nthe infinitesimal rigidity of body-bar frameworks with Abelian point group\nsymmetries in an arbitrary dimension.

If a polytope P has symmetry, we can consider equivariant psd\nlifts, i.e. those psd lifts that respect the symmetry of P. One of the simplest\nfamilies of polytopes with interesting symmetries are regular polygons in the\nplane, which have played an important role in the study of linear programming\nlifts (or extended formulations). In this paper we study equivariant psd lifts\nof regular polygons. We first show that the standard Lasserre/sum-of-squares\nhierarchy for the regular N-gon requires exactly ceil(N/4) iterations and thus\nyields an equivariant psd lift of size linear in N. In contrast we show that\none can construct an equivariant psd lift of the regular 2^n-gon of size 2n-1,\nwhich is exponentially smaller than the psd lift of the sum-of-squares\nhierarchy. Our construction relies on finding a sparse sum-of-squares\ncertificate for the facet-defining inequalities of the regular 2^n-gon, i.e.,\none that only uses a small (logarithmic) number of monomials. Since any\nequivariant LP lift of the regular 2^n-gon must have size 2^n, this gives the\nfirst example of a polytope with an exponential gap between sizes of\nequivariant LP lifts and equivariant psd lifts. Finally we prove that our\nconstruction is essentially optimal by showing that any equivariant psd lift of\nthe regular N-gon must have size at least logarithmic in N. \n\n"}

Richardson empirically interpreted this super-diffusive\nregime in terms of a non-Fickian process with a scale dependent diffusion\ncoefficient (the celebrated Richardson's \"4/3rd\" law). However, the actual\nphysical mechanism at the origin of such a scale dependent diffusion\ncoefficient remains unclear. The present article proposes a simple physical\nphenomenology for the time evolution of the mean square relative separation in\nturbulent flows, based on a scale dependent ballistic scenario rather than a\nscale dependent diffusive. This phenomenology accurately retrieves most of the\nknown features of relative dispersion ; among others : (i) it is quantitatively\nconsistent with recent numerical simulations and experiments (both for the\nshort term Batchelor regime and the long term Richardson regime, and for all\ninitial separations at inertial scales), (ii) it gives a simple physical\nexplanation of the origin of the super diffusive t^3 Richardson regime which\nnaturally builts itself as an iterative process of elementary\nshort-term-scale-dependent ballistic steps, (iii) it shows that the Richardson\nconstant is directly related to the Kolmogorov constant (and eventually to a\nballistic persistence parameter) and (iv) in a further extension of the\nphenomenology, taking into account third order corrections, it robustly\ndescribes the temporal asymmetry between forward and backward dispersion, with\nan explicit connection to the cascade of energy flux across scales. \n\n"}

If G the boundary of a three dimensional graph H for example, we can\nrefine the interior until it is colourable with 4 colours. The later goal is\nachieved if all interior edge degrees are even. Using a refinement process\nwhich cuts the interior along surfaces we can adapt the degrees along the\nboundary of that surface. More efficient is a self-cobordism of G with itself\nwith a host graph discretizing the product of G with an interval. It follows\nfrom the fact that Euler curvature is zero everywhere for three dimensional\ngeometric graphs, that the odd degree edge set O is a cycle and so a boundary\nif H is simply connected. A reduction to minimal colouring would imply the four\ncolour theorem. The method is expected to give a reason \"why 4 colours suffice\"\nand suggests that every two dimensional geometric graph of arbitrary degree and\norientation can be coloured by 5 colours: since the projective plane can not be\na boundary of a 3-dimensional graph and because for higher genus surfaces, the\ninterior H is not simply connected, we need in general to embed a surface into\na 4-dimensional simply connected graph in order to colour it.

For every surface type,\nwe construct examples with chromatic number 3,4 or 5, where the construction of\nsurfaces with chromatic number 5 is based on a method of Fisk.

The scaling constant for\nthe mixed third-order structure function of velocity-scalar increment grew over\nSc, and the effect of compressibility made it smaller than the classical 4/3\nvalue. At small amplitudes, the PDF of scalar fluctuations collapsed to the\nGaussian distribution, whereas at large amplitudes it decayed more quickly than\nGaussian. At large scales, the PDF of scalar increment behaved similarly to\nthat of scalar fluctuation, while at small scales it resembled the PDF of\nscalar gradient. The scalar dissipation occurring at large magnitudes was found\nto grow with Sc. Due to low molecular diffusivity, for Sc >> 1, the scalar\nfield rolled up and got mixed sufficiently. However, for Sc << 1, the scalar\nfield lost the small-scale structures by high molecular diffusivity, and\nretained only the large-scale, cloudlike structures.

This indicated that in compressible turbulence the processes\nof advection and dissipation except that of scalar-dilatation coupling might\ndefer to the Kolmogorov picture.

We generalize both\nthe few-generator and the density models with probabilistic schemes that also\nallow variability in the size of tuples and non-uniform distributions on words\nof a given length.Our first results rely on a relatively mild prefix-heaviness\nhypothesis on the distributions, which states essentially that the probability\nof a word decreases exponentially fast as its length grows.

In the special case of the uniform distribution on\nwords of a given length, we give a phase transition theorem for the central\ntree property, a combinatorial property closely linked to the fact that a tuple\nfreely generates a subgroup.

From there, the \"easy\" direction of the\ncorrespondence is a simple forgetful operation which erases annotations on the\ndiagram of a linear lambda term to produce a rooted trivalent map.

Stochastic models for the Lagrangian\nevolution of velocity gradients in isotropic turbulence, with closure models\nfor the pressure Hesssian and viscous Laplacian, have been shown to reproduce\nimportant features such as non-Gaussian probability distributions, skewness and\nvorticity strain-rate alignments. The Recent Fluid Deformation (RFD) closure\nintroduced the idea of mapping an isotropic Lagrangian pressure Hessian as\nupstream initial condition using the fluid deformation tensor.

The isotropic distribution of the\nconcentration field is destabilized by motion of the drop which is itself made\nby Marangoni flow from concentration-dependent surface tension. This\nsymmetry-breaking self-propulsion is distinct from other self-propulsion\nmechanisms due to the intrinsic polarity such as squirmers and self-phoretic\nmotion; there is a bifurcation point below which the drop is stationary and\nabove which it moves spontaneously. When two drops moving along the same axis\nwith opposite direction, the interactions arise both from hydrodynamics and\nconcentration overlap.

The important similarities\ninclude basic equations, ideal quadratic invariants, cascades and the role of\nlinear elastic waves. Surface tension induces elasticity, and the balance\nbetween surface tension energy and turbulent kinetic energy determines a length\nscale (Hinze scale) of the system. The Hinze scale may be thought of as the\nscale of emergent critical balance between fluid straining and elastic\nrestoring forces. The scales between the Hinze scale and dissipation scale\nconstitute the elastic range of the 2D CHNS system. By direct numerical\nsimulation, we find that in the elastic range, the mean square concentration\nspectrum $H^\\psi_k$ of the 2D CHNS system exhibits the same power law ($-7/3$)\nas the mean square magnetic potential spectrum $H^A_k$ in the inverse cascade\nregime of 2D MHD.

Current results show that both the posterior mean velocity\nand the Reynolds stress anisotropy show better agreement with the experimental\ndata at the corner region near the trailing edge.

This \"Lagrangian fluctuation-dissipation relation\"\nequates the scalar dissipation for either passive or active scalars to the\nvariance of scalar inputs associated to initial scalar values and internal\nscalar sources, as those are sampled backward in time by the stochastic\nLagrangian trajectories. As an important application, we reconsider the\nphenomenon of \"Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity\" or persistent\nnon-determinism of Lagrangian particle trajectories in the limit of vanishing\nviscosity and diffusivity. Previous work on the Kraichnan (1968) model of\nturbulent scalar advection has shown that anomalous scalar dissipation is\nassociated in that model to Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity. There has\nbeen controversy, however, regarding the validity of this mechanism for scalars\nadvected by an actual turbulent flow. We here completely resolve this\ncontroversy by exploiting the fluctuation-dissipation relation. For either a\npassive or active scalar advected by any divergence-free velocity field,\nincluding solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, and away from\nwalls, we prove that anomalous scalar dissipation requires Lagrangian\nspontaneous stochasticity. For passive scalars we prove furthermore that\nspontaneous stochasticity yields anomalous dissipation for suitable initial\nscalar distributions, so that the two phenomena are there completely\nequivalent. These points are illustrated by numerical results from a database\nof homogeneous, isotropic turbulence, which provide both additional support to\nthe results and physical insight into the representation of diffusive effects\nby stochastic Lagrangian particle trajectories. \n\n"}

Furthermore,\ndirect numerical simulations are typically not able to reach the extreme\nparameters of these processes. For this reason, large-eddy simulations (LES),\nwhich only simulate large and intermediate scales directly, are employed. The\nsmallest, unresolved scales and the interactions between small and large scales\nare introduced by means of a subgrid-scale (SGS) model. We propose and verify a\nnew set of nonlinear SGS closures for future application as an SGS model in LES\nof compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We use 15 simulations (without\nexplicit SGS model) of forced, isotropic, homogeneous turbulence with varying\nsonic Mach number $\\mathrm{M_s} = 0.2$ to $20$ as reference data for the most\nextensive \\textit{a priori} tests performed so far in literature.

Although there exist different hypotheses, it\nis widely believed that the randomness is \"intrinsic\", which, however, remains\nas an open question to be verified. Simulating the modeled Rayleigh-Benard\nconvection system by means of the so-called clean numerical simulation (CNS)\nwith negligible numerical noises that are smaller even than thermal\nfluctuation, we verify that turbulence can be self-excited from the inherent\nthermal fluctuation, without any external disturbances, i.e. out of nothing.\nThis reveals a relationship between microscopic physical uncertainty and\nmacroscopic randomness.

Such scenario can\ngenerally be helpful to understand the various relevant phenomena.

The main advantage of this kind\nof approach is the easy implementation and stability enhancement by introducing\nmore middle stages. However, the nth-order time accuracy needs no less than n\nstages for the RK method, which is very time and memory consuming for a high\norder method. On the other hand, the multi-stage multi-derivative (MSMD) method\ncan be used to achieve the same order of time accuracy using less middle\nstages, once the time derivatives of the flux function is used.The gas kinetic\nscheme (GKS) provides such a time accurate evolution model. By combining the\nsecond-order or third-order GKS flux functions with the MSMD technique, a\nfamily of high order gas kinetic methods can be constructed. As an extension of\nthe previous 2-stage 4th-order GKS, the 5th-order schemes with 2 and 3 stages\nwill be developed in this paper.

The\nNavier-Stokes equations in the low-Mach number approximation are solved using a\nnovel algorithm based on an extended version of the velocity-vorticity\nformulation used by Kim et al. (1987) for incompressible flows. Four cases with\ndensity ratios $s=1, 2, 4$ and 8 are considered. The simulations are run with a\nPrandtl number of 0.7 and achieve a $Re_\\lambda$ up to 150 during the\nself-similar evolution of the mixing layer. It is found that the growth rate of\nthe mixing layer decreases with increasing density ratio, in agreement with\ntheoretical models of this phenomenon. Comparison with high-speed data shows\nthat the reduction of the growth rates with increasing the density ratio has a\nweak dependence with the Mach number. In addition, the shifting of the mixing\nlayer to the low-density stream has been characterized by analyzing one point\nstatistics within the self-similar interval. This shifting has been quantified,\nand related to the growth rate of the mixing layer under the assumption that\nthe shape of the mean velocity and density profiles do not change with the\ndensity ratio. This leads to a predictive model for the reduction of the growth\nrate of the momentum thickness, which agrees reasonably well with the available\ndata.

It follows, at least in principle, that the quantitative aspects\nof the hypothesis of local stationarity could be tested by a comparison of the\nasymptotic dimensionless dissipation rate for free decay with that for the\nstationary case.

The chiral Burgers equation is identical to the\ncomplex Burgers equation with imaginary viscosity and an additional analyticity\nrequirement that enforces chirality. We present several exact solutions of the\nchiral Burgers equation. For generic multiple pole initial conditions, the\nsystem evolves to the formation of singularities in a finite time similar to\nthe case of an ideal fluid without odd viscosity. We also obtain a periodic\nsolution to the chiral Burgers corresponding to the non-linear generalization\nof small amplitude linear waves. \n\n"}

For that purpose, the manuscript\nis organized with respect to three mechanisms identified in particle\nresuspension, namely: the incipient motion of particles (i.e. how particles are\nset in motion), their migration on the surface (i.e. rolling or sliding motion)\nand their re-entrainment in the flow (i.e. their motion in the near-wall region\nafter detachment).

In this article, we compare two techniques for\nsimulating two-phase flows that possess attractive qualities, but belong to the\ntwo distinct classes of diffuse interface (DI) and volume of fluid (VOF)\nmethods. Both of these methods allow for mass-conserving schemes that can\nnaturally capture large interfacial topology changes omnipresent in realistic\ntwo phase flows. The DI solver used in this work is based on a conservative and\nbounded phase field method, developed recently. Similar to level set methods,\nthis diffuse interface method takes advantage of the smoothness of the phase\nfield in computing curvature and surface tension forces. Geometric VOF methods\ntrack the fractional tagged volume in a cell. The specific geometric VOF scheme\nused here is a discretely conservative and bounded implementation that uses\ngeometric algorithms for unsplit advection and interface reconstruction, while\nemploying height functions for normal and curvature calculation.

The study of rainbow subgraphs goes back more than two\nhundred years to the work of Euler on Latin squares and has been the focus of\nextensive research ever since. Euler posed a problem equivalent to finding\nproperly $n$-edge-coloured complete bipartite graphs $K_{n,n}$ which can be\ndecomposed into rainbow perfect matchings. While there are proper\nedge-colourings of $K_{n,n}$ without even a single rainbow perfect matching,\nthe theme of this paper is to show that with some very weak additional\nconstraints one can find many disjoint rainbow perfect matchings. In\nparticular, we prove that if some fraction of the colour classes have at most\n$(1-o(1)) n$ edges then one can nearly-decompose the edges of $K_{n,n}$ into\nedge-disjoint perfect rainbow matchings.

The analysis is performed using a\nFloquet-Bloch code that allows to examine the stability of modes with arbitrary\nlarge scale separation. For thin layers the 3D perturbations become unstable\nwhen the layer thickness $H$ becomes larger than $H > c_1 (\\nu\n\\ell_{_U}/U)^{1/2}= c_1 \\ell_{_U} Re^{-1/2}$, where $U$ is the rms velocity of\nthe flown, $\\ell_{_U}$ is the correlation length scale of the flow, $\\nu$ the\nviscosity and $Re=\\ell_{_U} U/\\nu$ is the Reynolds number.

The latter gives rise to a non-constant pressure gradient\nin the flow-wise direction and, hence, to a nonlinear flow rate--pressure drop\nrelation (unlike the Hagen--Poiseuille law for a rigid tube). Many biofluids\nare non-Newtonian, and are well approximated by generalized Newtonian (say,\npower-law) rheological models. Consequently, we analyze the problem of steady\nlow Reynolds number flow of a generalized Newtonian fluid through a slender\nelastic tube by coupling fluid lubrication theory to a structural problem posed\nin terms of Donnell shell theory. A perturbative approach (in the slenderness\nparameter) yields analytical solutions for both the flow and the deformation.\nUsing matched asymptotics, we obtain a uniformly valid solution for the tube's\nradial displacement, which features both a boundary layer and a corner layer\ncaused by localized bending near the clamped ends.

However,\nthis approach may be prone to overfitting and sensitive to noise. To address\nthese challenges we instead seek a sparse representation of the data in a\nlibrary of examples. Sparse representation has been widely used for image\nrecognition and reconstruction, and it is well-suited to structured data with\nlimited, corrupt measurements. We explore sparse representation for flow\nreconstruction on a variety of fluid data sets with a wide range of complexity,\nincluding vortex shedding past a cylinder at low Reynolds number, a mixing\nlayer, and two geophysical flows. In addition, we compare several measurement\nstrategies and consider various types of noise and corruption over a range of\nintensities.

In this paper, we introduce cherry-picking\nnetworks, a class of networks that can be reduced by a sequence of two graph\noperations.

We give a complete\ndescription of the self-stresses on non-crossing frameworks whose reciprocals\nare non-crossing, in terms of: the types of faces (only pseudo-triangles and\npseudo-quadrangles are allowed); the sign patterns in the self-stress; and a\ngeometric condition on the stress vectors at some of the vertices.\n  As in other recent papers where the interplay of non-crossingness and\nrigidity of straight-line plane graphs is studied, pseudo-triangulations show\nup as objects of special interest. For example, it is known that all planar\nLaman circuits can be embedded as a pseudo-triangulation with one non-pointed\nvertex. We show that if such an embedding is sufficiently generic, then the\nreciprocal is non-crossing and again a pseudo-triangulation embedding of a\nplanar Laman circuit. For a singular (i.e., non-generic) pseudo-triangulation\nembedding of a planar Laman circuit, the reciprocal is still non-crossing and a\npseudo-triangulation, but its underlying graph may not be a Laman circuit.\nMoreover, all the pseudo-triangulations which admit a non-crossing reciprocal\narise as the reciprocals of such, possibly singular, stresses on\npseudo-triangulation embeddings of Laman circuits.\n  All self-stresses on a planar graph correspond to liftings to piece-wise\nlinear surfaces in 3-space. We prove characteristic geometric properties of the\nlifts of such non-crossing reciprocal pairs. \n\n"}

It had been amply demonstrated that these model\nequations reproduce the phenomenon, but the results of DNS were not analyzed so\nfar with the goal of interpreting the phenomenon. In order to construct a\nuseful framework for the understanding of drag reduction we initiate in this\npaper an investigation of the most important modes that are sustained in the\nviscoelastic and Newtonian turbulent flows respectively.

The waves, which have same phase speed with the concentrated\nvortex, have interactions with the vortex to trigger the instability. We call\nthis mechanism as \"concentrated vortex instability\". The physical explanation\nof shear instability is also sketched. Finally, some useful criteria are\nderived from the theorem. These results would intrigue future works to\ninvestigate the other hydrodynamic instabilities. \n\n"}

We show that statistical analysis of the bubble-probe\ncolliding-times series can give a robust method for investigation of clustering\nin the bulk regions of a turbulent flow where, due to the opacity of the flow,\nno imaging technique can be employed. We demonstrate that micro-bubbles (radius\nR_0 ~ 0.1 mm) in a developed turbulent flow, where the Kolmogorov length-scale\nis, eta ~ R_0, display preferential concentration in small scale structures\nwith a typical statistical signature ranging from the dissipative range,\nO(eta), up to the low inertial range, O(100 eta). A comparison with\nEulerian-Lagrangian numeri- cal simulations is also presented to further\nsupport our proposed way to characterize clustering from temporal time series\nat a fixed position. \n\n"}

{"id": "physics/0703196", "contents": "Title: Efficient form of the LANS-alpha turbulence model in a\n  primitive-equation ocean model Abstract: The Lagrangian-Averaged Navier-Stokes alpha (LANS-alpha) model is a\nturbulence parameterization that has been shown to capture some of the most\nimportant features of high resolution ocean modeling at lower resolution.\nSimulations using LANS-alpha in the POP primitive-equation ocean model resemble\ndoubled-resolution simulations of standard POP in statistics like kinetic\nenergy, eddy kinetic energy, and potential temperature fields. The\ncomputational cost of adding LANS-alpha is only 27% for our most efficient\nimplementation, as compared to a factor of 8-10 for a doubling of resolution.\n  The LANS-alpha model improves turbulence statistics with an additional\nnonlinear term and a smoothed advecting velocity. In this work we investigate\ndifferent kinds of smoothing techniques and their effect on the LANS-alpha\nmodel's results and efficiency. We show that we can substitute convolution\nfilters for full Hemlholtz inversions and produce similar results at a\nsignificantly lower expense.\n  When constructing filters for LANS-alpha in a primitive-equation ocean model\nthe filter weights must be chosen carefully, otherwise a pressure-velocity\ninstability will be excited. We show analytically that certain ranges of filter\nweights are unstable, and confirm this with numerical experiments. Our\nstability criterion also guarantees that the kinetic energy is well defined,\nand that the filtered velocity is smoother that the original velocity. \n\n"}

{"id": "physics/9902010", "contents": "Title: Experimental evidence of a phase transition to fully developed\n  turbulence in a wake flow Abstract: The transition to fully developed turbulence of a wake behind a circular\ncylinder is investigated with respect to its statistics. In particular, we\nevaluated the probability density functions of velocity increments on different\nlength scales $r$. Evidence is presented that the $r$-dependence of the\nvelocity increments can be taken as Markov processes in the far field, as well\nas, in the near field of the cylinder wake. With the estimation of the\ndeterministic part of these Markov processes, as a function of the distance\nfrom the cylinder, we are able to set the transition to fully developed\nturbulence in analogy with a phase transition. We propose that the appearing\norder parameter corresponds to the presence of large scale coherent structures\nclose to the cylinder. \n\n"}
