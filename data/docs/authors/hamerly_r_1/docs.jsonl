We study this process for a\npurely decohering interaction when the environment, E, is in a non-ideal (e.g.,\nmixed) initial state. In the case of good decoherence, that is, after the\npointer states have been unambiguously selected, the mutual information between\nthe system, S, and an environment fragment, F, is given solely by F's entropy\nincrease. This demonstrates that the environment's capacity for recording the\nstate of S is directly related to its ability to increase its entropy.\nEnvironments that remain nearly invariant under the interaction with S, either\nbecause they have a large initial entropy or a misaligned initial state,\ntherefore have a diminished ability to acquire information. To elucidate the\nconcept of good decoherence, we show that - when decoherence is not complete -\nthe deviation of the mutual information from F's entropy change is quantified\nby the quantum discord, i.e., the excess mutual information between S and F is\ninformation regarding the initial coherence between pointer states of S.

Such an additional scalar degree of freedom is called \"Galileon\". The\nbasic idea is inspired by the DGP braneworld, but one can construct a\nghost-free model that admits a self-accelerating solution. We perform a fully\nrelativistic analysis of linear perturbations in Galileon cosmology. Although\nthe Galileon model can mimic the background evolution of standard $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology, the behavior of perturbation is quite different. It is shown that\nthere exists a super-horizon growing mode in the metric and Galileon\nperturbations at early times, suggesting that the background is unstable. A\nfine-tuning of the initial condition for the Galileon fluctuation is thus\nrequired in order to promote a desirable evolution of perturbations at early\ntimes. Assuming the safe initial condition, we then compute the late-time\nevolution of perturbations and discuss observational implications in Galileon\ncosmology.

Here we present the design and detailed\ncharacterization of a new linear trap, microfabricated with scalable\ncomplementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) techniques, that is well-suited\nto this challenge. Forty-four individually controlled DC electrodes provide the\nmany degrees of freedom required to construct anharmonic potential wells,\nshuttle ions, merge and split ion chains, precisely tune secular mode\nfrequencies, and adjust the orientation of trap axes. Microfabricated\ncapacitors on DC electrodes suppress radio-frequency pickup and excess\nmicromotion, while a top-level ground layer simplifies modeling of electric\nfields and protects trap structures underneath. A localized aperture in the\nsubstrate provides access to the trapping region from an oven below, permitting\ndeterministic loading of particular isotopic/elemental sequences via\nspecies-selective photoionization. The shapes of the aperture and\nradio-frequency electrodes are optimized to minimize perturbation of the\ntrapping pseudopotential.

This provides a stringent connection\nbetween the quantum HJ equation and the Copenhagen interpretation. Together\nwith tunneling and the energy quantization theorem for confining potentials,\nformulated in the framework of quantum HJ equation, it leads to the main\nfeatures of the axioms of quantum mechanics from a unique geometrical\nprinciple. Similarly to the case of the classical HJ equation, this fixes its\nquantum analog by requiring that there exist point transformations, rather than\ncanonical ones, leading to the trivial hamiltonian. This is equivalent to a\nbasic cocycle condition on the states. Such a cocycle condition can be\nimplemented on compact spaces, so that continuous energy spectra are allowed\nonly as a limiting case. Remarkably, a compact space would also imply that the\nDirac and von Neumann formulations of quantum mechanics essentially coincide.\nWe suggest that there is a definition of time parameterisation leading to\ntrajectories in the context of the quantum HJ equation having the probabilistic\ninterpretation of the Copenhagen School. \n\n"}

Recently, substantial progress was achieved in enhancing the\ntime within which a solid-state qubit demonstrates coherent dynamics. This\nprogress is based mostly on a successful isolation of the qubits from external\ndecoherence sources obtained by clever engineering. Under these conditions, the\nmaterial-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial role. In most cases,\nquantum devices are affected by noise decreasing with frequency, f,\napproximately as 1/f. According to the present point of view, such noise is due\nto material- and device-specific microscopic degrees of freedom interacting\nwith quantum variables of the nanodevice. The simplest picture is that the\nenvironment that destroys the phase coherence of the device can be thought of\nas a system of two-state fluctuators, which experience random hops between\ntheir states. If the hopping times are distributed in a exponentially broad\ndomain, the resulting fluctuations have a spectrum close to 1/f in a large\nfrequency range. In this paper we review the current state of the theory of\ndecoherence due to degrees of freedom producing 1/f noise. We discuss basic\nmechanisms of such noises in various nanodevices and then review several models\ndescribing the interaction of the noise sources with quantum devices.

We also prove that certain symmetric\nchannels (related to photon number splitting) have positive weak locking\ncapacity in the presence of a vanishingly small pre-shared secret, whereas\ntheir private capacity is zero.\n  These findings are powerful illustrations of the difference between two\napparently natural notions of privacy in quantum systems, relevant also to\nquantum key distribution (QKD): the older, naive one based on accessible\ninformation, contrasting with the new, composable one embracing the quantum\nnature of the eavesdropper's information.\n  Assuming an additivity conjecture for constrained minimum output Renyi\nentropies, the techniques of the first part demonstrate a single-letter formula\nfor the weak locking capacity of complements to cq-channels, coinciding with a\ngeneral upper bound of Guha et al. for these channels. Furthermore, still\nassuming this additivity conjecture, this upper bound is given an operational\ninterpretation for general channels as the maximum weak locking capacity of the\nchannel activated by a suitable noiseless channel. \n\n"}

The process\napproach offers an emergentist, discrete, finite, quasi-non-local and\nquasi-non-contextual realist interpretation which appears to resolve many of\nthe paradoxes and is free of divergences. Nevertheless, it retains the\ncomputational power of NRQM and possesses an emergent probability structure\nwhich agrees with NRQM in the asymptotic quotient. The paper describes the\nprocess algebra, the process covering map for single systems and the\nconfiguration process covering map for multiple systems. It demonstrates the\nlink to NRQM through a toy model. Applications of the process algebra to\nvarious quantum mechanical situations - superpositions, two-slit experiments,\nentanglement, Schrodinger's cat - are presented along with an approach to the\nparadoxes and the issue of classicality. \n\n"}

We then explore\nthree interesting consequences of this fact. Firstly, since the pure states are\nuncorrelated from the environment, the statement forms a no-go result against\nthe most straightforward device-independent protocol for randomness or secure\nkey generation against general no-signaling adversaries. It also leads to the\ninteresting question whether all non-extremal boxes allow for non-local\ncorrelations with the adversary. Secondly, in addition to the fact that new\ninformation-theoretic principles (designed to pick out the set of quantum\ncorrelations from among all non signaling ones) can in consequence be tested on\narbitrary non-local vertices to check their validity, it also allows the\npossibility of excluding from the quantum set any box of no-signaling\ncorrelations that can be distilled to a non-local vertex. Finally, it also\nforms a sufficient condition to identify non-local games with no quantum\nwinning strategy, when one can show that the game has a single unique\nnon-signaling winning strategy.

In this paper we make some steps\ntowards this direction.\n  First, we reveal the lattice-theoretic structure of the partial separability\nclassification, introduced earlier [Sz. Szalay and Z. Kokenyesi, Phys. Rev. A\n86, 032341 (2012)]. It turns out that, mathematically, the structure of the\nentanglement classes is the up-set lattice of the structure of the different\nkinds of partial separability, which is the down-set lattice of the lattice of\nthe partitions of the subsystems. It turns also out that, physically, this\nstructure is related to the LOCC convertibility: If a state from a class can be\nmapped into another one, then that class can be found higher in the hierarchy.\n  Second, we introduce the notion of multipartite monotonicity, expressing that\na given set of entanglement monotones, while measuring the different kinds of\nentanglement, shows also the same hierarchical structure as the entanglement\nclasses. Then we construct such hierarchies of entanglement measures, and\npropose a physically well-motivated one, being the direct multipartite\ngeneralization of the entanglement of formation based on the entanglement\nentropy, motivated by the notion of statistical distinguishability. The\nmultipartite monotonicity shown by this set of measures motivates us to\nconsider the measures to be the different manifestations of some \"unified\"\nnotion of entanglement. \n\n"}

Coherent LQG\ncontrol is discussed in Chapters 3-4, where I demonstrate that coherent\nfeedback outperforms measurement-based feedback for certain linear\nquadratic-Gaussian (LQG) problems, and explain the discrepancy by the former's\nsimultaneous utilization of both light quadratures.

Here we extend this to a more general problem of estimating the length\nof an incoherently radiating extended (line) object. We find, as expected by\nthe Rayleigh criterion, the Fisher information (FI) per integrated photon\nvanishes in the limit of small length for ideal image plane direct detection.\nConversely, for a Hermite-Gaussian (HG) pre-detection mode sorter, this\nnormalized FI does not decrease with decreasing object length, similar to the\ntwo point object case. However, unlike in the two-object problem, the FI per\nphoton of both detection strategies gradually decreases as the object length\ngreatly exceeds the Rayleigh limit, due to the relative inefficiency of\ninformation provided by photons emanating from near the center of the object\nabout its length.

Even stranger, there is no `real' light needed to obtain the\neffects, it simply appears from the vacuum, creating `something from nothing'.\nSurprisingly, the setup required to create these materials has become\nmoderately straightforward.

Despite the broad relevance of such a scenario to\nmetallic systems, there have been limited investigations of the entanglement\nstructure of the resulting long-time states, in part, due to the fundamental\ndifficulty in solving realistic models for disordered, interacting electrons.\nWe investigate this problem by carefully analyzing two \"toy\" models for\ncoherent quantum transport of diffusive fermions: the celebrated\nthree-dimensional, noninteracting Anderson model and a class of random quantum\ncircuits acting on a chain of qubits, which exactly maps to a diffusive,\ninteracting fermion problem.

Recent studies in silicon photonics have documented\npromising characteristics for photon pair sources within the telecommunications\nband, including sub-milliwatt optical pump power, high spectral brightness, and\nhigh photon purity. However, most quantum systems suitable for local\noperations, such as storage and computation, support optical transitions in the\nvisible or short near-infrared bands. In comparison to telecommunications\nwavelengths, the significantly higher optical attenuation in silica at such\nwavelengths limits the length scale over which optical-fiber-based quantum\ncommunication between such local nodes can take place. One approach to connect\nsuch systems over fiber is through a photon pair source that can bridge the\nvisible and telecom bands, but an appropriate source, which should produce\nnarrow-band photon pairs with a high signal-to-noise ratio, has not yet been\ndeveloped in an integrated platform.

As a result, with\nnon-restricted templates it is possible to achieve sizeable signal-to-noise\nratios in cases where the dominant harmonic (which is the one at twice the\norbital phase) does not enter the detector's bandwidth. This will have\nimportant repercussions on the detection of binary inspirals involving\nintermediate-mass black holes. For sources at a distance of 100 Mpc, taking\ninto account the higher harmonics will double the mass reach of Advanced LIGO,\nand that of EGO gets tripled. Conservative estimates indicate that the\nrestricted waveforms underestimate detection rates for intermediate mass binary\ninspirals by at least a factor of twenty. \n\n"}

A numerical analysis indicates\nthat the identification of time with the Liouville mode results in an expanding\nuniverse with matter which exhibits an inflationary phase, and `graceful exit'\nfrom it, tending asymptotically to a flat-metric fixed point.This fixed point\nis characterized by a dilaton configuration which, depending on the initial\nconditions, either decreases linearly with the cosmic time, or is a finite\nconstant. This implies that, in contrast to the critical string case, the\nstring coupling remains bounded during the exit from the inflationary phase,\nand, thus, the pertinent dynamics can be reliably described in terms of a\ntree-level string effective action. The r\\^ole of matter in inducing such\nphenomena is emphasized. It is also interesting to note that the asymptotic\nvalue of the vacuum energy, which in the $\\sigma$-model framework is identified\nwith the `running' central charge deficit, depends crucially on the set of\ninitial conditions.
