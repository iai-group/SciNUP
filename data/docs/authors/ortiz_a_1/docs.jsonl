A longstanding\ninfrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable\nby adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order\nhigher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless\ncone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones.

The extremity of these shifts depends on the proximity of the\ninnermost stable circular orbit to the black hole, and that orbit is determined\nby the black hole spin parameter. Modeling relativistic spectral features,\nthen, gives a means of estimating black hole spin. We report on the results of\nfits made to archival X-ray spectra of stellar-mass black holes and black hole\ncandidates, selected for strong disk reflection features. Following recent\nwork, these spectra were fit with reflection models and disk continuum emission\nmodels (where required) in which black hole spin is a free parameter. Although\nour results must be regarded as preliminary, we find evidence for a broad range\nof black hole spin parameters in our sample.

For those sources with\nconstrained binary system parameters, we examine the distribution of spin\nparameters versus black hole mass, binary mass ratio, and orbital period.

The amplification of slow magnetosonic waves is analyzed in great\ndetails. A simple formula for the amplification coefficient is derived. The\nvelocity shear primarily affects the incompressible limit of slow magnetosonic\nwaves. The amplification is very strong for slow magnetosonic waves in the\nlong-wavelength limit.

Therefore, for example, given two bursts of identical peak luminosity\nnear the detection threshold, a dim soft burst will be preferentially detected\nover a dim hard burst. This detector bias can create or skew an apparent\ncorrelation where increasingly hard GRBs appear increasingly bright. Although\nsuch correlations may be obfuscated by a middle step where GRBs need to be\nbright enough to have their actual redshifts determined, it is found that the\nbias is generally pervasive.

We perform many\ndirect $N$-body simulations with various initial conditions and two different\nchoices of IMFs. One is a standard Kroupa IMF without any mass segregation. The\nother is a radially dependent IMF, as presently observed in the Arches. We find\nthat it is unlikely for the Arches to have attained the observed degree of mass\nsegregation at its current age starting from a standard non-segregated Kroupa\nIMF. We also study the possibility of a collisional runaway developing in the\nfirst $\\sim 2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ of dynamical evolution. We find that the evolution of\nthis cluster is dramatically different depending on the choice of IMF: if a\nprimordially mass segregated IMF is chosen, a collisional runaway should always\noccur between $2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ for a broad range of initial concentrations. In\ncontrast, for a standard Kroupa IMF no collisional runaway is predicted. We\nargue that if Arches was created with a mass segregated IMF similar to what is\nobserved today then at the current cluster age a very unusual, high-mass star\nshould be created. However, whether a collisional runaway leads to the\nformation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) depends strongly on the\nmass loss rate via winds from massive stars. Growth of stellar mass through\ncollisions can be quenched by strong wind mass loss. In that case, the\ninter-cluster as well as intra-cluster medium are expected to have a\nsignificant Helium enrichment which may be observed via Helium recombination\nlines.

The light and color curves display\nvariability in all of them. The light curves are complex and suggest multiple\nperiods, changing periods, and/or changing amplitudes, which are attributed to\npulsation. A dominant period has been determined for each and found to be in\nthe range of ~150 d for the coolest (G8) to 35-40 d for the warmest (F3). A\nclear, linear inverse relationship has been found in the sample between the\npulsation period and the effective temperature and also an inverse linear\nrelationship between the amplitude of light variation and the effective\ntemperature. These are consistent with the expectation for a pulsating post-AGB\nstar evolving toward higher temperature at constant luminosity. The published\nspectral energy distributions and mid-infrared images show these objects to\nhave cool (200 K), detached dust shells and published models imply that\nintensive mass loss ended a few thousand years ago. The detection of periods as\nlong as 150 d in these requires a revision in the published post-AGB evolution\nmodels that couple the pulsation period to the mass loss rate and that assume\nthat intensive mass loss ended when the pulsation period had decreased to 100\nd.

Using a simple jet absorption model, we seek to clarify the situation\nby exploring in detail how the calculated $v_2$ varies with choices of the\ncollision geometry as well as choices of the path length dependence and\nthermalization time $\\tau_0$ in the energy loss formula. Besides the change of\neccentricity due to distortion from gluon saturation or event-by-event\nfluctuation, we find that the $v_2$ is also sensitive to the centrality\ndependence of multiplicity and the relative size between the matter profile and\nthe jet profile. We find that the $v_2$ calculated for the naive quadratic path\nlength dependence of energy loss, even including eccentricity fluctuation and\nthe gluon saturation, is not enough to describe the experimental data at high\n$p_T$ ($\\sim$ 6 GeV/$c$) in Au+Au collisions.

For the rate and power expected\nin star forming regions, we previously (Carroll et al. 2009) demonstrated that\noutflows could drive supersonic turbulence at levels consistent with the\nscaling relations from Matzner 2007 although with a steeper velocity power\nspectrum than expected for an isotropically driven supersonic turbulent\ncascade. Here we perform higher resolution simulations and combine simulations\nof outflow driven turbulence with those of isotropically forced turbulence. We\nfind that the presence of outflows within an ambient isotropically driven\nturbulent environment produces a knee in the velocity power spectrum at the\noutflow scale and a steeper slope at sub-outflow scales than for a purely\nisotropically forced case.

With this, observations of the multiple star system\ncontaining the merger product(s) can be used to work backwards in order to\nconstrain the initial orbital energies of any single, binary or triple systems\nthat went into the encounter. The initial semi-major axes of the orbits provide\nan estimate for the collisional cross section and therefore the time-scale for\nthe encounter to occur in its host cluster.

Therefore, we\nobtain a new Standard Model prediction for the parity-violating asymmetry in\nthe kinematics of the Q-Weak experiment of $(0.0767\\pm0.0008\\pm0.0020_{\\gamma\nZ})$. The latter error leads to a relative uncertainty of 2.8% in the\ndetermination of the proton's weak charge, and is dominated by the uncertainty\nin the isospin structure of the inclusive cross section. We argue that future\nparity-violating inelastic $ep$ asymmetry measurements at low-to-moderate $Q^2$\nand $W^2$ could be exploited to reduce the uncertainty associated with the\ndispersion correction. Because the corresponding shift and error bar decrease\nmonotonically with decreasing beam energy, a determination of the proton's weak\ncharge with a lower-energy experiment or measurements of \"isotope ratios\" in\natomic parity-violation could provide a useful cross check on any implications\nfor physics beyond the Standard Model derived from the Q-Weak measurement. \n\n"}

Aspherical ejecta are produced by prescribing a latitudinal scaling or\nstretching of SN ejecta inputs obtained from 1-D non-LTE time-dependent\ncalculations. We study polarisation signatures as a function of inclination,\nshape factor, wavelength, line identity, post-explosion time. At early times,\ncancellation and optical-depth effects make the polarisation intrinsically low,\ncausing complicated sign reversals with inclination or continuum wavelength,\nand across line profiles. While the line polarisation is positive (negative)\nfor an oblate (prolate) morphology at the peak and in the red wing, the\ncontinuum polarisation may be of any sign. These complex polarisation\nvariations are produced not just by the asymmetric distribution of scatterers\nbut also of the flux. Our early-time signatures are in contradiction with\npredictions for a centrally illuminated aspherical nebula, although this\nbecomes a better approximation at nebular times. For a fixed asymmetry, our\nsynthetic continuum polarisation is generally low, may evolve non-monotonically\nduring the plateau phase, but it systematically rises as the ejecta become\noptically thin. Changes in polarization over time do not necessarily imply a\nchange in the asymmetry of the ejecta.

Through these processes, this work\nexplored the constituent structure of baryons and the mechanisms through which\nthe interactions between these constituents ultimately control the selected\nreactions. First, hard nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering was studied\nconsidering the quark exchange (QE) between the nucleons to be the dominant\nmechanism of interaction in the constituent picture. It was found that an\nangular asymmetry exhibited by proton-neutron (pn) elastic scattering data is\nexplained within this framework if a quark-diquark picture dominates the\nnucleon's structure instead of a more traditional SU(6) model. The latter\nyields an asymmetry around 90 deg center of mass scattering with a sign\nopposite to what is experimentally observed. The second process is the hard\nbreakup by a photon of a nucleon-nucleon system in light nuclei. Proton-proton\n(pp) and pn breakup in 3He, and double Delta-isobars production in deuteron\nbreakup were analyzed in the hard rescattering model (HRM), which in\nconjunction with the QE mechanism provides a QCD description of the reaction.\nCross sections for both channels in 3He photodisintegration were computed\nwithout the need of a fitting parameter. The results presented here for pp\nbreakup show excellent agreement with recent experimental data. In double\nDelta-isobars production in deuteron breakup, HRM angular distributions for the\ntwo double Delta channels were compared to the pn channel and to each other. An\nimportant prediction from this study is that the Delta++ Delta- channel\nconsistently dominates Delta+Delta0, which is in contrast with models that\nunlike the HRM consider a double Delta system in the initial state of the\ninteraction.

Computation\nof various magnetic parameters such as magnetic energy, gradient of twist of\nsunspot fields and any kind of extrapolations, heavily hinge on the force-free\napproximation of the photospheric sunspot magnetic fields. Thus it is important\nto inspect the force-freeness of sunspot fields. The force-freeness of sunspot\nmagnetic fields has been examined earlier by some researchers ending with\nincoherent results. Accurate photospheric vector field measurements with high\nspatial resolution are required to inspect the force-free nature of sunspots.\nWe use several such vector magnetograms obtained from the Solar Optical\nTelescope/Spectro-Polarimeter aboard the Hinode. Both necessary and sufficient\nconditions for force-freeness are examined by checking global and local nature\nof magnetic forces over sunspots. We find that the sunspot magnetic fields are\nnot much away from force-free configuration, although they are not completely\nforce-free on the photosphere.

Here we further explore this\nscenario to study the potential roles of shear viscosity and cosmic ray (CR)\ndiffusion on the morphology and CR distribution of the bubbles. We show that\neven a relatively low level of viscosity (\\mu_{visc} >~ 3 g cm^{-1} s^{-1}, or\n~0.1% - 1% of Braginskii viscosity in this context) could effectively suppress\nthe development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at the bubble surface,\nresulting in smooth bubble edges as observed. Furthermore, viscosity reduces\ncirculating motions within the bubbles, which would otherwise mix the\nCR-carrying jet backflow near bubble edges with the bubble interior. Thus\nviscosity naturally produces an edge-favored CR distribution, an important\ningredient to produce the observed flat gamma-ray surface brightness\ndistribution.

However, we show that by\nincorporating CR diffusion which is strongly suppressed across the bubble\nsurface (as inferred from sharp bubble edges) but is close to canonical values\nin the bubble interior, we obtain a reasonably flat gamma-ray intensity\nprofile.

In the absence of cold dark matter, the\nsupersymmetron field converges to a supersymmetric minimum with a vanishing\ncosmological constant. When cold dark matter is present, the supersymmetron\nevolves to a matter dependent minimum where its energy density does not vanish\nand could lead to the present acceleration of the Universe.

We find that this effect is enough to spoil quark number scaling\nin elliptic flow. A lack of scaling in data therefore does not signal the\nabsence of partonic degrees of freedom and hadronization by coalescence. In a\ncoalescing partonic fluid, however, elliptic flow of anti-baryons should be the\ngreater than that of baryons, since antibaryons contain a greater admixture of\npartons from the highly flowing midrapidity region.

Assuming that the polarization is purely due to the Goldreich-Kylafis\neffect, the linear polarization direction is defined by the magnetic field as\neven the small Zeeman splitting of CO and SiO dominates the molecular\ncollisional and spontaneous emission rates.

In this picture, the\nhard initial scatterings result in mainly longitudinal flux tubes, with\ntransversely moving pieces carrying the $p_{t}$ of the partons from hard\nscatterings. These flux tubes constitute eventually both bulk matter (which\nthermalizes and flows) and jets. We introduce a criterion based on parton\nenergy loss to decide whether a given string segment contributes to the bulk or\nleaves the matter to end up as a jet of hadrons. Essentially low $p_{t}$\nsegments from inside the volume will constitute the bulk, high $p_{t}$ segments\n(or segments very close to the surface) contribute to the jets. The latter ones\nappear after the usual flux tube breaking via q-qbar production (Schwinger\nmechanism). Interesting is the transition region: Intermediate $p_{t}$ segments\nproduced inside the matter close to the surface but having enough energy to\nescape, are supposed to pick up q-qbar pairs from the thermal matter rather\nthan creating them via the Schwinger mechanism. This represents a communication\nbetween jets and the flowing bulk matter (fluid-jet interaction).

Abstract: Can the standard cosmological model be questioned on the basis of a single\nobserved extreme galaxy cluster? Usually, the word extreme refers directly to\ncluster mass, which is not a direct observable and thus subject to substantial\nuncertainty. Hence, it is desirable to extend studies of extreme clusters to\ndirect observables, such as the Einstein radius (ER). We aim to evaluate the\noccurrence probability of the large observed ER of MACS J0717.5 within the\nstandard LCDM cosmology. In particular, we want to model the distribution\nfunction of the single largest ER in a given cosmological volume and to study\nwhich underlying assumptions and effects have the strongest impact on the\nresults. We obtain this distribution by a Monte Carlo approach, based on the\nsemi-analytic modelling of the halo population on the past lightcone. After\nsampling the distribution, we fit the results with the general extreme value\n(GEV) distribution which we use for the subsequent analysis. We find that the\ndistribution of the maximum ER is particularly sensitive to the precise choice\nof the halo mass function, lens triaxiality, the inner slope of the halo\ndensity profile and the mass-concentration relation. Using the distributions so\nobtained,we study the occurrence probability of the large ER of MACS J0717.5,\nfinding that this system is not in tension with LCDM. We also find that the GEV\ndistribution can be used to fit very accurately the sampled distributions and\nthat all of them can be described by a Frechet distribution. With a multitude\nof effects that strongly influence the distribution of the single largest ER,\nit is more than doubtful that the standard LCDM cosmology can be ruled out on\nthe basis of a single observation. If, despite the large uncertainties in the\nunderlying assumptions, one wanted to do so, a much larger ER (> 100 arcsec)\nthan that of MACS J0717.5 would have to be observed. \n\n"}

We show that turbulent\nsystems are always gravitationally unstable (in a probabilistic sense). The\nfragmentation mass spectra, size/mass relations, correlation functions, range\nof scales over which fragmentation occurs, & time-dependent rates of\nfragmentation are predictable. We show how this depends on bulk turbulent\nproperties (Mach numbers & power spectra). We also generalize to include\nrotation, complicated equations of state, collapsing/expanding backgrounds,\nmagnetic fields, intermittency, & non-normal statistics. We derive how\nfragmentation is suppressed with 'stiffer' equations of state or different\ndriving mechanisms. Suppression appears at an 'effective sonic scale' where\nMach(R,rho)~1. Gas becomes stable below this scale for polytropic gamma>4/3,\nbut fragmentation still occurs on larger scales.

The radius\nestimates from transit observations, coupled with spectroscopic determinations\nof mass, provide constraints on its interior composition. The composition of\nexoplanetary interiors and atmospheres are particularly sensitive to elemental\nC/O ratio, which to first order can be estimated from the host stars. Results\nfrom a recent spectroscopic study analyzing the 6300A [O I] line and two C I\nlines suggest that 55 Cnc has a carbon-rich composition (C/O=1.12+/-0.09).\nHowever oxygen abundances derived using the 6300A [O I] line are highly\nsensitive to a Ni I blend, particularly in metal-rich stars such as 55 Cnc\n([Fe/H]=0.34+/-0.18).

Abstract: Several gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) last much longer (~hours) in gamma-rays than\ntypical long GRBs (~ minutes), and recently it was proposed that these\n\"ultra-long GRBs\" may form a distinct population, probably with a different\n(e.g. blue supergiant) progenitor than typical GRBs. However, Swift\nobservations suggest that many GRBs have extended central engine activities\nmanifested as flares and internal plateaus in X-rays. We perform a\ncomprehensive study on a large sample of Swift GRBs with XRT observations to\ninvestigate GRB central engine activity duration and to determine whether\nultra-long GRBs are unusual events. We define burst duration t_burst based on\nboth gamma-ray and X-ray light curves rather than using gamma-ray observations\nalone. We find that t_burst can be reliably measured in 343 GRBs. Within this\n\"good\" sample, 21.9% GRBs have t_burst >=10^3 s and 11.5% GRBs have t_burst\n>=10^4 s. There is an apparent bimodal distribution of t_burst in this sample.\nHowever, when we consider an \"undetermined\" sample (304 GRBs) with t_burst\npossibly falling in the gap between GRB duration T_90 and the first X-ray\nobservational time, as well as a selection effect against t_burst falling into\nthe first Swift orbital \"dead zone\" due to observation constraints, the\nintrinsic underlying t_burst distribution is consistent with being a single\ncomponent distribution. We found that the existing evidence for a separate\nultra-long GRB population is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength\nobservations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion. We also discuss the\ntheoretical implications of our results. In particular, the central engine\nactivity duration of GRBs is generally much longer than the gamma-ray T90\nduration and it does not even correlate with T90. It would be premature to make\na direct connection between T90 and the size of the progenitor star. \n\n"}

We model the observed present day mass functions of the young\nGalactic Arches and Quintuplet star clusters using our rapid binary evolution\ncode.

This resolves the problem of an apparent age\nspread among the most luminous stars exceeding the expected duration of star\nformation in these clusters.

Overall, we\nfind good agreement between WL and X-ray masses, with different mass bias\nestimators all consistent with zero. Subdividing the sample, we find the\nhigh-mass subsample to show no significant mass bias while for the low-mass\nsubsample, there is a bias towards overestimated X-ray masses at the\n$\\sim\\!2\\sigma$ level for some mass proxies. The overall scatter in the\nmass-mass scaling relations is surprisingly low. Neither observation can be\ntraced back to the parameter settings in the WL analysis. We do not find\nevidence for a strong ($\\sim\\!40$ %) underestimate in the X-ray masses, as\nsuggested to reconcile Planck cluster counts and cosmological constraints. For\nhigh-mass clusters, our measurements are consistent with studies in the\nliterature. The mass dependent bias, significant at $\\sim\\!2\\sigma$, may hint\nat a physically different cluster population (less relaxed clusters with more\nsubstructure and mergers); or it may be due to small number statistics. \n\n"}

It follows that a curvaton-like\nmechanism for generating $\\zeta$ requires an alternative to slow roll such as\nk-inflation. Second, accepting slow-roll inflation, the excursion of the\ninflaton field is at least of order Planck scale.

The invariant mass spectrum of the\nleading jet in $Z$+jet and $H$+jet events is directly sensitive to these\neffects, and we use a QCD factorization theorem to predict its dependence on\nthe jet radius $R$, jet $p_T$, jet rapidity, and partonic process for both the\nperturbative and nonperturbative components of primary soft radiation. We prove\nthat the nonperturbative contributions involve only odd powers of $R$, and the\nlinear $R$ term is universal for quark and gluon jets. The hadronization model\nin PYTHIA8 agrees well with these properties. The perturbative soft initial\nstate radiation (ISR) has a contribution that depends on the jet area in the\nsame way as the underlying event, but this degeneracy is broken by dependence\non the jet $p_T$.

To this end, we assumed\ntwo simple electron density distributions along the LOS (a constant density and\nGaussian density profiles) for a plasma blob and synthesized the expected tB\nand pB for different distances $z$ of the blob from the plane of the sky (POS)\nand different projected altitudes $\\rho$. Reconstructed locations of the blob\nalong the LOS were thus compared with the real ones, allowing a precise\ndetermination of uncertainties in the method. Independently of the analytical\ndensity profile, when the blob is centered at a small distance from the POS\n(i.e. for limb CMEs) the distance from the POS starts to be significantly\noverestimated. Polarization ratio technique provides the LOS position of the\ncenter of mass of what we call folded density distribution, given by reflecting\nand summing in front of the POS the fraction of density profile located behind\nthat plane. On the other hand, when the blob is far from the POS, but with very\nsmall projected altitudes (i.e. for halo CMEs, $\\rho < 1.4$ R$_\\odot$), the\ninferred distance from that plane is significantly underestimated. Better\ndetermination of the real blob position along the LOS is given for intermediate\nlocations, and in particular when the blob is centered at an angle of\n$20^\\circ$ from the POS.

In addition, observations indicate that at least a significant\nfraction of BSs in these clusters was formed by the binary mass-transfer\nmechanism. The aim of our present investigation is to obtain and analyze a set\nof evolutionary models of cool, close detached binaries with a low metal\nabundance, which are characteristic of GC. We computed the evolution of 975\nmodels of initially detached, cool close binaries with different initial\nparameters. The models include mass exchange between components as well as mass\nand angular momentum loss due to the magnetized winds for very low-metallicity\nbinaries with Z = 0.001. The models are interpreted in the context of existing\ndata on contact binary and blue straggler members of GCs. The model parameters\nagree well with the observed positions of the GC contact binaries in the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram. Contact binaries in the lower part of the cluster\nmain sequence are absent because there are no binaries with initial orbital\nperiods shorter than 1.5 d. Contact binaries end their evolution as mergers\nthat appear in the BS region. Binary-formed BSs populate the whole observed BS\nregion in a GC, but a gap is visible between low-mass mergers that are\nconcentrated along the zero-age main sequence and binary BSs occupying the red\npart of the BS region. Very few binary mergers are expected to rotate rapidly\nand/or possess chemical peculiarities resulting from the exposure of the layers\nprocessed by CNO nuclear reactions. All other binary mergers are\nindistinguishable from the collisionally formed mergers. The results show that\nbinary-formed BSs may constitute at least a substantial fraction of all BSs in\na GC. \n\n"}

For ages younger than ~ 5 Gyr deltaT1 shows a strong correlation\nwith both age and metallicity. The deltaC index -defined as deltaT1 for the C\npassband- is also a combined measurement of age and metallicity.

Abstract: In this work, a study of the average transverse momentum (pt) as a function\nof the mid-rapidity charged hadron multiplicity (Nch) and hadron mass (m) in\np-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies is presented. For the events\nproducing low Nch, the average pt is found to scale with the reduced hadron\nmass, i.e., mass divided by the number of quark constituents (m/nq), this\nscaling also holds for inelastic pp collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. The\nscaling is broken in high multiplicity p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions, where, for\n<Nch/deta> < 60 the average pt is higher for baryons than that for mesons,\nthough they increase linearly with m/nq. This behavior is qualitatively well\nreproduced by Pythia 8, but not by hydro calculations, where an universal\nscaling with the hadron mass (and not with m/nq) is predicted for all the\nmultiplicity event classes.

These SRCs provide corrections to lepton- nucleus\ncross sections as computed in the impulse approximation (IA). Purpose: We want\nto investigate the influence of SRCs on the one-nucleon (1N) and two-nucleon\n(2N) knockout channel for muon-neutrino induced processes on a $^{12}$C target\nat energies relevant for contemporary measurements. Method: The model adopted\nin this work, corrects the impulse approximation for SRCs by shifting the com-\nplexity induced by the SRCs from the wave functions to the operators. Due to\nthe local character of the SRCs, it is argued that the expansion of these\noperators can be truncated at a low order. Results: The model is compared with\nelectron-scattering data, and two-particle two-hole responses are presented for\nneutrino scattering. The contributions from the vector and axial-vector parts\nof the nuclear current as well as the central, tensor and spin-isospin part of\nthe SRCs are studied. Conclusions: Nuclear SRCs affect the 1N knockout channel\nand give rise to 2N knockout. The exclusive neutrino-induced 2N knockout cross\nsection of SRC pairs is shown and the 2N knockout contribution to the QE signal\nis calculated.

The nature of both stars\nis uncertain, although we know from X-ray studies that there is a wind-wind\ncollision whose properties change with orbital phase.\n  Methods. Observations of Eta Car were carried out with the ESO VLTI and the\nAMBER instrument between approximately five and seven months before the August\n2014 periastron passage. Velocity-resolved aperture-synthesis images were\nreconstructed from the spectrally dispersed interferograms. Interferometric\nstudies can provide information on the binary orbit, the primary wind, and the\nwind collision.\n  Results. We present velocity-resolved aperture-synthesis images reconstructed\nin more than 100 different spectral channels distributed across the Br Gamma\n2.166 micrometer emission line. The intensity distribution of the images\nstrongly depends on wavelength. At wavelengths corresponding to radial\nvelocities of approximately -140 to -376 km/s measured relative to line center,\nthe intensity distribution has a fan-shaped structure.

[Results]. Our data indicate\nthe presence of a planet with a minimum mass of 26 Earth masses around the\nsolar twin HIP 68468. The planet is a super-Neptune, but unlike the distant\nNeptune in our solar system (30 AU), HIP 68468c is close-in, with a semi-major\naxis of 0.66 AU, similar to that of Venus. The data also suggest the presence\nof a super-Earth with a minimum mass of 2.9 Earth masses at 0.03 AU; if the\nplanet is confirmed, it will be the fifth least massive radial velocity planet\ndiscovery to date and the first super-Earth around a solar twin.

The star is enhanced in refractory elements when\ncompared to the Sun, and the refractory enrichment is even stronger after\ncorrections for Galactic chemical evolution. We determined a NLTE Li abundance\nof 1.52 dex, which is four times higher than what would be expected for the age\nof HIP 68468.

Numerical simulations were started at the pre-stellar phase and\nterminated at the end of the embedded phase when 90% of the initial core mass\nhad been accreted onto the forming protostar plus disk system. The disk\nformation and evolution was studied using numerical hydrodynamics simulations,\nwhile the formation and evolution of the central star was calculated using a\nstellar evolution code. Three scenarios for mass accretion from the disk onto\nthe star were considered: hybrid accretion in which a fraction of accreted\nenergy absorbed by the protostar depends on the accretion rate, hot accretion\nwherein a fraction of accreted energy is constant, and cold accretion wherein\nall accretion energy is radiated away. Our conclusions on the nature of VeLLOs\ndepend crucially on the character of protostellar accretion. In the hybrid\naccretion scenario, most VeLLOs (90.6%) are expected to be the first\nhydrostatic cores (FHSCs) and only a small fraction (9.4%) are true protostars.\nIn the hot accretion scenario, all VeLLOs are FHSCs due to overly high\nphotospheric luminosity of protostars. In the cold accretion scenario, on the\ncontrary, the majority of VeLLOs belong to the Class I phase of stellar\nevolution. The reason is that the stellar photospheric luminosity, which sets\nthe floor for the total internal luminosity of a young star, is lower in cold\naccretion, thus enabling more VeLLOs in the protostellar stage.

An evolutionary classification of disks was\nproposed based on their IR spectral energy distribution, with the Group I\nsources showing a prominent cold component ascribed to an earlier stage of\nevolution than Group II. Disk evolution can be constrained from the comparison\nof disks with different properties. A first attempt of disk taxonomy is now\npossible thanks to the increasing number of high-resolution images of Herbig\nAe/Be stars becoming available. Near-IR images of six Group II disks in\nscattered light were obtained with VLT/NACO in Polarimetric Differential\nImaging, which is the most efficient technique to image the light scattered by\nthe disk material close to the stars. We compare the stellar/disk properties of\nthis sample with those of well-studied Group I sources available from the\nliterature. Three Group II disks are detected. The brightness distribution in\nthe disk of HD163296 indicates the presence of a persistent ring-like structure\nwith a possible connection with the CO snowline. A rather compact (less than\n100 AU) disk is detected around HD142666 and AK Sco.

Group\nII are not evolved version of the Group I. Within the Group II disks, very\ndifferent geometries (both self-shadowed and compact) exist.

There is also a break close to the Eddington limit, above\nwhich the probability of an accretion event decreases steeply.

In addition, we generalize the\nwork of Bolmont & Mathis (2016) by following the orbital evolution of close-in\nplanets using the new tidal dissipation predictions for advanced phases of\nstellar evolution. On the PMS the evolution of tidal dissipation is controlled\nby the evolution of the internal structure of the contracting star. On the MS\nit is strongly driven by the variation of surface rotation that is impacted by\nmagnetized stellar winds braking. The main effect of taking into account the\nrotational evolution of the stars is to lower the tidal dissipation strength by\nabout four orders of magnitude on the main-sequence, compared to a normalized\ndissipation rate that only takes into account structural changes. The evolution\nof the dissipation strongly depends on the evolution of the internal structure\nand rotation of the star. From the pre-main sequence up to the tip of the\nred-giant branch, it varies by several orders of magnitude, with strong\nconsequences for the orbital evolution of close-in massive planets. These\neffects are the strongest during the pre-main sequence, implying that the\nplanets are mainly sensitive to the star's early history. \n\n"}

One possible solution is that the accretion process is episodic. FU\nOri-type stars (FUors) are thought to be the visible examples for objects in\nthe high accretion state.

After renormalizing background\nquantities (fixed by observations at some pivot scale), all that remains are\nlogarithmic runnings in correlation functions that are both Planck and slow\nroll suppressed. In this paper we show how a large number of hidden fields can\npartially compensate this suppression and generate a potentially observable\nrunning in the tensor two point function, consistently inferable courtesy of a\nlarge $N$ resummation. We detour to address certain subtleties regarding loop\ncorrections during inflation, extending the analysis of [1].

A similar\napproach which uses the characteristic properties of gravitational\nretro-lensing images can be followed to measure the charge of\nReissner-Nordstrom black hole.

Here, we develop and apply a\ndual-survey extraction technique to SCUBA and MAMBO images of the Lockman Hole.\nCut above 5sigma, our catalogue of SMGs is more robust than previous samples,\nwith a reduced likelihood of real, but faint SMGs (beneath and around the\nconfusion limit) entering via superposition with noise. The effective flux\nlimit of the survey is well matched to our deep 1.4-GHz image. The former is\nsensitive to luminous, dusty galaxies at extreme redshifts whilst the latter\nprobes the z<3 regime. A high fraction of our robust SMGs (~80%) have radio\ncounterparts which, given the ~10% contamination by spurious sources, suggests\nthat very distant SMGs (z>>3) are unlikely to make up more than ~10% of the\nbright SMG population. This implies that almost all of the bright SMG\npopulation is amenable to study via the deepest current radio imaging.

Their relative disk masses are comparable to those\nderived for coeval low-mass stars: most of them are in the ~<1-5% range, and\nthere is no clear change of relative disk mass with object mass from 0.015 to 3\nsolar masses.

Several techniques have been used to probe the mass\ndistributions of clusters, sometimes yielding results which are discrepant, or\nat odds with clusters formed in simulations - for example giving NFW\nconcentration parameters much higher than expected in the standard CDM model.\nIn addition, the velocity fields of some well studied galaxy clusters reveal\nthe presence of several structures close to the line-of-sight, often not\ndynamically bound to the cluster itself. We investigate what impact such\nneighbouring but unbound massive structures would have on the determination of\ncluster profiles using weak gravitational lensing. Depending on its\nconcentration and mass ratio to the primary halo, one secondary halo close to\nthe line-of-sight can cause the estimated NFW concentration parameter to be\nsignificantly higher than that of the primary halo, and also cause the\nestimated mass to be biased high. Although it is difficult to envisage how this\nmechanism alone could yield concentrations as high as reported for some\nclusters, multiple haloes close to the line-of-sight, such as in the case of\nAbell 1689, can substantially increase the concentration parameter estimate.\nTogether with the fact that clusters are triaxial, and that including baryonic\nphysics also leads to an increase in the concentration of a dark matter halo,\nthe tension between observations and the standard CDM model is eased.

We suggest this feature to be an\n`echo' of the secondary maximum. At the end of the outburst a similar local\noptical maximum occurs, which might be an `echo' of the tertiary maximum.

We show that kink\nconfigurations employing Higgs fields in the 45 (the adjoint representation) of\nO(10) break up into three classes: those that at finite distances from the wall\nrespect a U(5) subgroup of SO(10), and two others that respect the smaller\nsubgroups U(3) x U(2) and U(4) x U(1). These smaller subgroups arise from the\nclash of symmetries mechanism: they are the intersections of two differently\nembedded U(5) subgroups of SO(10), the latter being the symmetries respected in\nasymptotia on opposite sides of the domain wall. The existence of the SO(10) ->\nU(3) x U(2) = SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) x U(1)' = G_{SM} x U(1)' class advances the\nsearch for a realistic brane world model wherein some of the required symmetry\nbreaking is achieved via the clash of symmetries rather than the conventional\nmechanism. At the centres of the walls, the unbroken symmetries are enhanced.\nIn the U(3) x U(2) case, the symmetry is O(6) x U(2), which is closely related\nto the Pati-Salam-like SU(4) x SU(2) x U(1) group. If our universe is a brane\nlocated at the centre of such a wall, then we see the O(10) symmetry as being\nstrongly broken to SU(4) x SU(2) x U(1).

We also discuss evidence for a possible precursor\nstate to the QGP, i.e. the proposed Color Glass Condensate. \n\n"}

In the most central Au+Au collisions\nat the highest beam energy, evidence is found for the formation of a very high\nenergy density system whose description in terms of simple hadronic degrees of\nfreedom is inappropriate. Furthermore, the constituents of this novel system\nare found to undergo a significant level of interaction. The properties of\nparticle production at RHIC energies are shown to follow a number of simple\nscaling behaviors, some of which continue trends found at lower energies or in\nsimpler systems. As a function of centrality, the total number of charged\nparticles scales with the number of participating nucleons. When comparing\nAu+Au at different centralities, the dependence of the yield on the number of\nparticipants at higher pT (~4 GeV/c) is very similar to that at low transverse\nmomentum. The measured values of charged particle pseudorapidity density and\nelliptic flow were found to be independent of energy over a broad range of\npseudorapidities when effectively viewed in the rest frame of one of the\ncolliding nuclei, a property we describe as \"extended longitudinal scaling''.\nFinally, the centrality and energy dependences of several observables were\nfound to factorize to a surprising degree. \n\n"}
