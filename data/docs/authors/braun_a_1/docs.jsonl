We then focus on models in which the inflaton is the bosonic\ncomponent of a single (complex) chiral superfield and explain the generic\ndifficulties in designing small field models of modular inflation. We then show\nthat if the Kaehler potential (KP) of the inflaton is logarithmic as in\nperturbative string theories, then it is not possible to satisfy the slow-roll\nconditions for any superpotential. We find that if the corrections to the KP\nare large enough so it can be approximated by a canonical KP in the vicinity of\nthe extremum, then viable slow-roll inflation is possible. In this case,\nseveral parameters have to be tuned to a fraction of a percent. We give a\nprescription for designing successful small field supergravity models of\ninflation when the KP is canonical and calculate the slow-roll parameters from\nthe superpotential parameters. Our results strengthen the case for models in\nwhich the moduli slowly roll about a Planck distance from a relatively high\nscale extremum that is located in the vicinity of the central region of moduli\nspace units.

The former optical medium is deduced from the stereographic projection of\na virtual sphere and displays a heterogeneous refractive index n(r) which is\nproportional to the inverse of 1+r^2.

Related to this, what is the effective theory that\ndescribes the universe on large scales? In this paper we make progress in\naddressing these questions. We show that the effective theory for the\nlong-wavelength universe behaves as a viscous fluid coupled to gravity:\nintegrating out short-wavelength perturbations renormalizes the homogeneous\nbackground and introduces dissipative dynamics into the evolution of\nlong-wavelength perturbations. The effective fluid has small perturbations and\nis characterized by a few parameters like an equation of state, a sound speed\nand a viscosity parameter.

This class of solutions is\nasymptotically AdS in six and higher dimensions and yields a spacetime with\nlongitudinal magnetic field generated by a static brane. These solutions have\nno curvature singularity and no horizons but have a conic geometry with a\ndeficit angle.

The orientifold theory is\nmathematically described by the double cover the base of the elliptic\nfibration. Such orientifold theories are characterized by a transition from a\nsemi-stable singular fiber to an unstable one. In this paper, we describe the\nfirst example of a weak coupling limit in F-theory characterized by a\ntransition to a non-Kodaira (and non-ADE) fiber.

We illustrate this in detail for the\nwell-studied case of the O6 plane compactification on SU(2)xSU(2)/Z_2xZ_2. For\nthat example we uncover another novel structure in the tachyon spectrum: the dS\nsolutions have a singular, but supersymmetric, Minkowski limit, in which the\ntachyon exactly aligns with the sgoldstino. \n\n"}

The WMAP mission has resulted in a\nhighly constrained LCDM cosmological model with precise and accurate parameters\nin agreement with a host of other cosmological measurements.

The model fit also implies that the age of the universe is\n13.772+/-0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H0 = 69.32+/-0.80 km/s/Mpc.\nInflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with Gaussian\nrandom phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar spectral index from\nunity reported earlier by WMAP now has high statistical significance (n_s =\n0.9608+/-0.0080); and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean, Omega_k =\n-0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038). Overall, the WMAP mission has resulted in a\nreduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for the\nstandard six-parameter LCDM model, based on CMB data alone.

The three-dimensional minimally\nsupersymmetric effective action of M-theory on a general Spin(7) manifold with\nfluxes is determined and specialized to the aforementioned geometries.

However,\nphoton loss leads to dephasing during the gate, and any residual entanglement\nbetween the resonator and qubits after the gate leads to decoherence. Here we\nconsider how to shape the drive pulse to minimize these unwanted effects.\nFirst, we review how the gate's entangling and dephasing rates depend on the\nsystem parameters and validate closed-form solutions against direct numerical\nsolution of a master equation.

After imposing an exotic-free MSSM\nspectrum, anomaly cancellation (related to hypercharge flux GUT breaking in the\npresence of U(1) gauge symmetries), absence of dimension four and five proton\ndecay operators and other R-parity violating couplings, and the presence of at\nleast the third generation top Yukawa coupling, we generate the remaining quark\nand lepton Yukawa textures by a Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism. In this process we\nrequire that the dangerous couplings are forbidden at leading order, and when\nre-generated by singlet vevs, lie within the experimental bounds. We scan over\nall possible configurations, and show that only a small class of U(1) charge\nassignments and matter distributions satisfy all the requirements. The\nsolutions give rise to the exact MSSM spectrum with realistic quark and lepton\nYukawa textures, which are consistent with the CKM and PMNS mixing matrices. We\nalso discuss the geometric realization of these models, and provide pointers to\nthe class of elliptic fibrations with good phenomenological properties. \n\n"}

The interplay between statistical\nphysics of disordered systems and computer science has brought new light into\nthe realm of computational complexity theory, by introducing the notion of\nclustering of solutions, related to replica symmetry breaking. However, the\nclass of problems in which clustering has been studied often involve discrete\ndegrees of freedom: standard random CSPs are random K-SAT (aka disordered Ising\nmodels) or random coloring problems (aka disordered Potts models).

These standard\nprocedures, based on either the Hamiltonian or the path integral, however, do\nnot work in the case of a relativistic particle. As a result we do not have a\nsingle particle description of relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM). Instead,\nthe correct approach requires a transmutation of dynamical variables from the\nposition and momentum of a single particle to a field and its canonical\nmomentum. Particles, along with antiparticles, reappear in a very non-trivial\nmanner as the excitations of the field. The fact that one needs to adopt\ncompletely different languages to describe relativistic and non-relativistic\nfree particle implies that obtaining the NRQM limit of QFT is conceptually\nnon-trivial. I examine this limit in several approaches (like, for e.g.,\nHamiltonian dynamics, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian path integrals, field\ntheoretic description etc.) and identify the precise issues which arise when\none attempts to obtain the NRQM from QFT in each of these approaches. The\ndichotomy of description between NRQM and QFT does not originate just from the\nsquare root in the Hamiltonian or from the demand of Lorentz invariance, as it\nis sometimes claimed. The real difficulty has its origin in the necessary\nexistence of antiparticles to ensure a particular notion of relativistic\ncausality. Because of these conceptual issues, it turns out that one cannot, in\nfact, obtain some of the popular descriptions of NRQM by any sensible limiting\nprocedure applied to QFT. To obtain NRQM from QFT in a seamless manner, it is\nnecessary to work with NRQM expressed in a language closer to that of QFT.\n(Abridged) \n\n"}

A long-standing challenge is to understand SF on looplike\ntopological excitations which are spatially extended objects. In this work, we\nconstruct a powerful topological-field-theoretical framework approach for 3D\ntopological orders, which leads to a systematic characterization and\nclassification of SF. For systems with Abelian gauge groups ($G_g$) and Abelian\nsymmetry groups ($G_s$), we successfully establish equivalence classes that\nlead to a finite number of patterns of SF, although there are notoriously\ninfinite number of Lagrangian-descriptions of the system. We compute\ntopologically distinct types of fractional symmetry charges carried by\nparticles.

Memory connotes the ability to encode, access, and erase\nsignatures of past history in the state of a system. Once the system has\ncompletely relaxed to thermal equilibrium, it is no longer able to recall\naspects of its evolution. Memory of initial conditions or previous training\nprotocols will be lost. Thus many forms of memory are intrinsically tied to\nfar-from-equilibrium behavior and to transient response to a perturbation. This\ngeneral behavior arises in diverse contexts in condensed matter physics and\nmaterials: phase change memory, shape memory, echoes, memory effects in\nglasses, return-point memory in disordered magnets, as well as related contexts\nin computer science. Yet, as opposed to the situation in biology, there is\ncurrently no common categorization and description of the memory behavior that\nappears to be prevalent throughout condensed-matter systems. Here we focus on\nmaterial memories. We will describe the basic phenomenology of a few of the\nknown behaviors that can be understood as constituting a memory. We hope that\nthis will be a guide towards developing the unifying conceptual underpinnings\nfor a broad understanding of memory effects that appear in materials. \n\n"}

Notable examples\ninclude U(1) quantum spin liquid of the local moments and semimetallic\nnon-Fermi liquid of the conduction electrons. Here we investigate emergent\nquantum phases and their transitions driven by the Kondo lattice coupling\nbetween such highly entangled quantum ground states. Using the renormalization\ngroup method, it is shown that weak Kondo lattice coupling is irrelevant,\nleading to a fractionalized semimetal phase with decoupled local moments and\nconduction electrons. Upon increasing the Kondo lattice coupling, this phase is\nunstable to the formation of broken symmetry states.

Abstract: The effort to discover a quantum theory of gravity is motivated by the need\nto reconcile the incompatibility between quantum theory and general relativity.\nHere, we present an alternative approach by constructing a consistent theory of\nclassical gravity coupled to quantum field theory. The dynamics is linear in\nthe density matrix, completely positive and trace preserving, and reduces to\nEinstein's theory of general relativity in the classical limit. Consequently,\nthe dynamics doesn't suffer from the pathologies of the semiclassical theory\nbased on expectation values. The assumption that general relativity is\nclassical necessarily modifies the dynamical laws of quantum mechanics -- the\ntheory must be fundamentally stochastic in both the metric degrees of freedom\nand in the quantum matter fields. This allows it to evade several no-go\ntheorems purporting to forbid classical-quantum interactions. The measurement\npostulate of quantum mechanics is not needed -- the interaction of the quantum\ndegrees of freedom with classical space-time necessarily causes decoherence in\nthe quantum system. We first derive the general form of classical-quantum\ndynamics and consider realisations which have as its limit deterministic\nclassical Hamiltonian evolution. The formalism is then applied to quantum field\ntheory interacting with the classical space-time metric.

We have devised\nhigh-throughput filters which provide accurate two-color restframe $B$ and $V$\nlight curves of SN Ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-corrected\nluminosity distances in the range $0.25 < z < 0.55$. Sources of systematic\nerror from K-corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution are\ninvestigated, and their effects estimated. We present photometric and spectral\nobservations of SN 1995K, our program's first supernova, and use the data to\nobtain a precise measurement of the luminosity distance to the $z=0.479$ host\ngalaxy. This object, when combined with a nearby sample of SN, yields an\nestimate for the matter density of the Universe of $\\Omega_M =\n-0.2^{+1.0}_{-0.8}$ if $\\Omega_\\Lambda = 0$. For a spatially flat universe\ncomposed of normal matter and a cosmological constant, we find $\\Omega_M =\n0.4^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$, $\\Omega_\\Lambda = 0.6^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$. We demonstrate that\nwith a sample of $\\sim 30$ objects, we should be able to determine relative\nluminosity distances over the range $0 < z< 0.5$ with sufficient precision to\nmeasure $\\Omega_M$ with an uncertainty of $\\pm 0.2$. \n\n"}

The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia\nare, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density\n(Omega_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve\nfitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor\neternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e.,\nOmega_Lambda > 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 < 0).\nWith no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M > 0, the\nspectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q_0 <0 at the 2.8 sigma\nand 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda >0 at the 3.0 sigma and\n4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a\n``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection,\nOmega_Lambda>0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level.

Presently, none of these effects reconciles\nthe data with Omega_Lambda=0 and q_0 > 0. \n\n"}

In this context, the question whether thermodynamics and, in\nparticular, the concept of temperature can apply on the nanoscale is of central\ninterest. Here we consider a quantum system consisting of a regular chain of\nelementary subsystems with nearest neighbour interactions and assume that the\ntotal system is in a canonical state with temperature $T$. We analyse, under\nwhat condition the state factors into a product of canonical density matrices\nwith respect to groups of $n$ subsystems each, and when these groups have the\nsame temperature $T$. In quantum systems the minimal group size\n$n_{\\textrm{min}}$ depends on the temperature $T$, contrary to the classical\ncase.

A gyraton may be considered as a classical toy model\nfor a quantum wave packet of high-energy particles with spin.

The goal of this study is to understand the role of the gravitational\nspin-spin interaction in the process of mini-black-hole formation in particle\ncollisions. To simplify the problem we consider several gyraton models with\nspecial profiles of the energy and spin density distribution. For these models\nwe study the apparent horizon (AH) formation on the future edge of a spacetime\nregion before interaction. We demonstrate that the AH forms only if the energy\nduration and the spin are smaller than some critical values, while the length\nof the spin distribution should be at least of the order of the system\ngravitational radius.

{"id": "math/9809072", "contents": "Title: Special Lagrangian Fibrations II: Geometry Abstract: We continue the study of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow mirror symmetry\nconjecture. Roughly put, this states that if two Calabi-Yau manifolds X and Y\nare mirror partners, then X and Y have special Lagrangian torus fibrations\nwhich are dual to each other. Much work on this conjecture is necessarily of a\nspeculative nature, as in dimension 3 it is still a very difficult problem of\nhow to construct such fibrations. Nevertheless, assuming the existence of such\nfibrations there are many things one can prove. This paper covers a number of\nissues. First it applies results from the theory of completely integrable\nhamiltonian systems to understand some aspects of the geometry of such\nfibrations. From this, using reasonable regularity assumptions on the\nfibrations, one can understand how the cohomology of dual fibrations are\nrelated. We then study the question of how, given one such fibration, one would\nput a symplectic and complex structure on the dual fibrations, generalising\nwork of Hitchin. While this question cannot be answered at this stage, these\nresults should give insight into the nature of the problem. We sum up these\nideas in a refined version of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture.\n  Finally, to give evidence for this conjecture, we prove it explicitly for K3\nsurfaces. One finds a construction of mirror symmetry for K3 surfaces which\ndoes not require the use of Torelli theorems, and is much more differential\ngeometric in nature than previous constructions. \n\n"}
