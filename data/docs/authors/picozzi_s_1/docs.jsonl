In this paper we study the shape stability of the\nexpanding circular cavity against perturbations, in both the unbounded and the\nbounded growth regimes (for the latter the unperturbed theory predicts no\ncatastrophic failure). Since the unperturbed reference state is time dependent,\nthe linear stability theory cannot be cast into standard time-independent\neigenvalue analysis. The main results of our study are: (i) sufficiently small\nperturbations are stable, (ii) larger perturbations within the formal linear\ndecomposition may lead to an instability; this dependence on the magnitude of\nthe perturbations in the linear analysis is a result of the non-stationarity of\nthe growth, (iii) the stability of the circular cavity is particularly\nsensitive to perturbations in the effective disorder temperature; in this\ncontext we highlight the role of the rate sensitivity of the limiting value of\nthis effective temperature.

The superconducting barriers\nare assumed to be reflection-less so that an incident electron on the barrier\ncan either tunnel through it or Andreev reflect from it. In this structure,\nquantum charge pumping can be achieved (a) by modulating the amplitudes,\n$\\Delta_1$ and $\\Delta_2$ of the two superconducting gaps or alternatively, (b)\nby a periodic modulation of the order parameter phases, $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$\nof the superconducting barriers. In the former case, we show that the\nsuperconducting gap gives rise to a very sharp resonance in the transmission\nresulting in quantization of pumped charge, when the pumping contour encloses\nthe resonance. On the other hand, we find that quantization is hard to achieve\nin the latter case. We show that inclusion of weak electron-electron\ninteraction in the quantum wire leads to renormalisation group evolution of the\ntransmission amplitude towards the perfectly transmitting limit due to\nproximity effects. Hence as we approach the zero temperature limit, we get\ndestruction of quantized pumped charge. This is in sharp contrast to the case\nof charge pumping in a double barrier in a Luttinger liquid where quantized\ncharge pumping is actually achieved in the zero temperature limit.

The emphasis is on strongly\nnonlinear materials containing pores or rigid inclusions. Full-field numerical\nsimulations are carried out using a Fast-Fourier Transform algorithm [H.\nMoulinec, P. Suquet, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris II 318, 1417 (1994)], while the\ntheoretical results are obtained by means of the `second-order' nonlinear\nhomogenization method [P. Ponte Castaneda, J. Mech. Phys.

The effect of nonlinearity and inclusion concentration is investigated\nin the context of power-law (with strain-rate sensitivity m) behavior for the\nmatrix phase under in-plane shear loadings. Overall, the `second-order'\nestimates are found to be in good agreement with the numerical simulations,\nwith the best agreement for the rigidly reinforced materials.

More specifically, for small porosities and fixed\nnonlinearity m>0, the effective stress decreases linearly with increasing\nporosity. However, for ideally plastic behavior (m = 0), the dependence on\nporosity becomes non-analytic.

In particular, in the so-called\n`underdoped' region, the overall behavior of superconductivity deviates\n$qualitatively$ from the standard theoretical description pioneered by Bardeen,\nCooper and Schrieffer (BCS). Recently, the importance of phase fluctuation of\nthe superconducting order parameter has gained significant support from various\nexperiments. However, the microscopic mechanism responsible for the\nsurprisingly soft phase remains one of the most important unsolved puzzles.\nHere, opposite to the standard BCS starting point, we propose a simple,\nsolvable low-energy model in the strong coupling limit, which maps the\nsuperconductivity literally into a well-understood physics of superfluid in a\nspecial dilute bosonic system of local pairs of doped holes. In the\nprototypical material (La$_{1-\\delta}$Sr$_\\delta$)$_2$CuO$_4$, without use of\nany free parameter, a $d$-wave superconductivity is obtained for doping above\n$\\sim 5.2\\%$, below which unexpected incoherent $p$-wave pairs dominate.\nThroughout the whole underdoped region, very soft phases are found to originate\nfrom enormous mass enhancement of the pairs. Furthermore, a striking mass\ndivergence is predicted that dictates the occurrence of the observed quantum\ncritical point. Our model produces properties of the superfluid in good\nagreement with the experiments, and provides new insights into several current\npuzzles. Owing to its simplicity, this model offers a paradigm of great value\nin answering the long-standing challenges in underdoped cuprates. \n\n"}

It was further claimed that at large enough SOC, the stronger the\nSOC, the weaker the Uc because in general the effective SOC is enhanced with\nincreasing electron-electron interaction strength. Contrary to this\nexpectation, we find that, in orthorhombic perovskite oxides (Pbnm), the\nstronger the SOC, the bigger the Uc.

We further show that the same mechanism\nthat embodies the Luttinger theorem within the framework of the exact theory,\naccounts for a non-trivial dependence of the exact self-energy on \\lambda that\ncannot be captured within a non-self-consistent framework. We thus establish\nthat the extant calculations that purportedly prove deformation of the\ninteracting FS of the metallic GS of the single-band Hubbard Hamiltonian with\nrespect to its Hartree-Fock counterpart at the second order in the on-site\ninteraction energy U, are fundamentally deficient.

We observe\ntwo bulk 3D Dirac nodes that locate on the opposite sides of the bulk zone\ncenter point $\\Gamma$, which exhibit a Fermi surface Lifshitz transition and a\nsaddle point singularity. Furthermore, our data shows evidence for the possible\nexistence of theoretically predicted weak 2D nontrivial spin-orbit surface\nstate with helical spin polarization that are nestled between the two bulk\nDirac cones, consistent with the theoretically calculated (100)\nsurface-arc-modes.

It is an open question whether an analogous process is possible for\ntime reversal which is an anti-unitary symmetry.

In order to\ncompute the time-dependent response of the solid material to such a shear\ntransformation, with a proper account of elastic heterogeneity and shear wave\npropagation, we propose and implement a very simple Finite-Element (FE) -based\nmethod. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of a binary Lennard-Jones glass are\nused as a benchmark for comparison, and information about the microscopic\nviscosity and the local elastic constants is directly extracted from the MD\nsystem and used as input in FE. We find very good agreement between FE and MD\nregarding the temporal evolution of the disorder-averaged displacement field\ninduced by a shear transformation, which turns out to coincide with the\nresponse of a uniform elastic medium. However, fluctuations are relatively\nlarge, and their magnitude is satisfactorily captured by the FE simulations of\nan elastically heterogeneous system.

The proposed method thus paves\nthe way for models of the rheology of amorphous solids which are both\ncomputationally efficient and realistic, in that structural disorder and\ninertial effects are accounted for. \n\n"}

However, the conventional deformation potential model most\nwidely adopted to describe this transformation happens to have been\ninvestigated only up to 1 % uniaxially loaded strains.

At this scale,\nmoisture induced instabilities and out-of-plane deformations may occur. This\nwork focuses on several aspects of this issue.

On account of the SML and corresponding reduction in total spin\ncurrent available for spin-charge transduction in the Pt, we determine the Pt\nspin Hall conductivity ($\\sigma_\\mathrm{SH} = (2.36 \\pm 0.04)\\times10^6\n\\Omega^{-1} \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$) and bulk spin Hall angle\n($\\theta_\\mathrm{SH}=0.387 \\pm0.008$) to be larger than commonly-cited values.\nThese results suggest that Pt can be an extremely useful source of SOT if the\nFM/NM interface can be engineered to minimize SML.

To this end, disorder was introduced\ninto the system in a controlled way by exposing the single crystals to x-ray\nirradiation.

Measurements of the thermal expansion and resistance show that\nthe first-order character of the Mott transition prevails for low irradiation\ndoses achieved by irradiation times up to 100 h. For these crystals with a\nmoderate degree of disorder, we find a first-order transition line which ends\nin a second-order critical endpoint, akin to the pristine crystals. Compared to\nthe latter, however, we observe a significant reduction of both, the critical\npressure $p_c$ and the critical temperature $T_c$. This result is consistent\nwith the theoretically-predicted formation of a soft Coulomb gap in the\npresence of strong correlations and small disorder.

Depending on the concentration, the\npresence of these defects in LaAlO3 slab can suppress the surface conductivity.\nIn contrast, in insulating SrTiO3 slabs already very small concentrations of\noxygen vacancies or hydrogen dopant atoms induce a finite occupation of the\nconduction band.

A 2D Peierls-Nabarro\nfinite element (PN-FE) model for studying edge dislocation transmission across\nfully coherent and non-damaging phase boundaries was recently proposed. This\npaper brings a new dimension to the complexity by extending the PN-FE model\nwith a dedicated cohesive zone model for the phase boundary. With the proposed\nmodel, a natural interplay between dislocations, external boundaries and the\nphase boundary, including decohesion of that boundary, is provided. It allows\none to study the competition between dislocation transmission and phase\nboundary decohesion. Commonly, the interface potentials required for glide\nplane behaviour and phase boundary decohesion are established through atomistic\nsimulations. They are corresponding to the misfit energy intrinsic to a system\nof two bulks of atoms that are translated rigidly with respect to each other.\nIt is shown that the blind utilisation of these potentials in zero-thickness\ninterfaces (as used in the proposed model) may lead to a large quantitative\nerror.

In this paper, we present new diffuse scattering\nresults obtained on Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3 (PZN for short) and\n(1-x)Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3-xPbTiO3(PZN-xPT)single crystals (with x=4.5 and 9%),\naround various Bragg reflections and along three symmetry directions in the\n[100]-[011] zone. Diffuse scattering is observed around reflections with mixed\nindices, (100), (011) and (300), and along transverse and diagonal directions\nonly. No diffuse scattering is found in longitudinal scans. The diffuse\nscattering peaks can be fitted well with a Lorentzian function, from which a\ncorrelation length is extracted. The correlation length increases with\ndecreasing temperatures down to the transition at Tc, first following a\nCurie-Weiss law, then departing from it and becoming flat at very low\ntemperatures. These results are interpreted in terms of three temperature\nregions: 1) dynamic polarization fluctuations (i.e. with a finite lifetime) at\nhigh temperatures, 2) static polarization reorientations (condensation of polar\nnanoregions) that can still reorient as a unit (relaxor behavior) at\nintermediate temperatures and 3) orientational freezing of the polar\nnanoregions with random strain fields in pure PZN or a structural phase\ntransition in PZN-xPT at low temperatures. The addition of PT leads to a\nbroadening of the diffuse scattering along the diagonal ([111]) relative to the\ntransverse ([100]) direction, indicating a change in the orientation of the\npolar regions. Also, with the addition of PT, the polar nanoregions condense at\na higher temperature above Tc. \n\n"}

The dielectric response of the films was found to be strongly\ndominated by a power-law in frequency, typical of materials with localized\nhopping charge carriers, in contrast to the Debye-like response of the bulk\nmaterial.

Its cornerstone is a smooth free-energy functional, designed so that\nthe stable solutions connecting any two phases are completely free of the third\nphase. For the simplest choice of this functional, the equations of motion for\neach of the two solid-liquid interfaces can be mapped to the standard\nphase-field model of single-phase solidification, and all thin-interface\ncorrections to the dynamics of the solid-liquid interfaces can be eliminated.\nThis means that simulation results become independent of the thickness W of the\ndiffuse interfaces. As a consequence, accurate results can be obtained using\nvalues of W much larger than the physical interface thickness, which makes\nsimulations for realistic experimental parameters feasible. Convergence of the\nsimulation outcome with decreasing W is explicitly demonstrated. The results\nare also compared to a boundary-integral formulation of the corresponding\nfree-boundary problem. Excellent agreement is found, except in the immediate\nvicinity of bifurcation points, where differences arise. These differences\nreveal that, in contrast to the standard assumptions of the free-boundary\nproblem, out of equilibrium the diffuse trijunction region of the phase-field\nmodel can (i) slightly deviate from Young's law for the contact angles, and\n(ii) advance in a direction that forms a finite angle with the solid-solid\ninterface at each instant. While the deviation (i) extrapolates to zero in the\nlimit of vanishing interface thickness, the small angle in (ii) remains roughly\nconstant, which indicates that it might be a genuine physical effect, present\neven for an atomic-scale interface thickness. \n\n"}

It is shown that for low\ncollision energies possible nuclear reactions (including deuterium fusion) are\nstrongly boosted by the environment. The effect originates from a chain of\npreliminary three elastic collisions which transform the projectile-target\nexperiment into one with colliding beams. Firstly, the projectile-target pair\nof nuclei undergo elastic scattering in which the projectile shares its energy\nand momentum with the target nucleus. Then the projectile and target nuclei\ncollide with different heavy nuclei from the environment. These latter\ncollisions change the velocities of the target and projectile nuclei and set\nthem again on the collision course. Finally, the same pair of nuclei collide\ninelastically, this time giving rise to the nuclear reaction. The increased\nenergy of the target nucleus increases the relative velocity up to sqrt 2\ntimes, resulting in a drastic exponential increase of the probability to\npenetrate the Coulomb barrier and therefore sharply increasing the likelihood\nof the nuclear reaction. Applications to laser-induced fusion are discussed. \n\n"}

We discuss several\nconsequences of this result in the context of quantum information theory.\nFirst, we show that the information that leaks out to space-like separated\nregions is negligable, and that there is a finite speed at which correlations\nand entanglement can be distributed. Second, we discuss how these ideas can be\nused to prove lower bounds on the time it takes to convert states without\ntopological quantum order to states with that property. Finally, we show that\nthe rate at which entropy can be created in a block of spins scales like the\nboundary of that block. \n\n"}
