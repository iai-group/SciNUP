In particular, it must explain how\nan initial singularity is avoided, and also how the initial conditions for\nInflation were established.

Data from different surveys\nare used to study source spectra between 1.4 and 33GHz.

Its renormalization group trajectories emanating from a\nnon-Gaussian fixed point define asymptotically safe quantum field theories. A\npriori these theories are, somewhat unusually, given in terms of their\neffective rather than bare action. In this paper we construct a functional\nintegral representation of these theories. We fix a regularized measure and\nshow that every trajectory of effective average actions, depending on an IR\ncutoff only, induces an associated trajectory of bare actions which depend on a\nUV cutoff. Together with the regularized measure these bare actions give rise\nto a functional integral which reproduces the prescribed effective action when\nthe UV cutoff is removed. In this way we are able to reconstruct the underlying\nmicroscopic (\"classical\") system and identify its fundamental degrees of\nfreedom and interactions. The bare action of the Einstein-Hilbert truncation is\ncomputed and its flow is analyzed as an example.

Various models have been proposed\nto explain this evolution, which have different implications for galaxy, star,\nand BH formation. We compile observations of spheroid properties as a function\nof redshift and use them to test proposed models. Evolution in progenitor\ngas-richness with redshift gives rise to initial formation of smaller spheroids\nat high-z. These systems can then evolve in apparent or physical size via\nseveral channels: (1) equal-density 'dry' mergers, (2) later major or minor\n'dry' mergers with less-dense galaxies, (3) adiabatic expansion, (4) evolution\nin stellar populations & mass-to-light-ratio gradients, (5) age-dependent bias\nin stellar mass estimators, (6) observational fitting/selection effects. If any\none of these is tuned to explain observed size evolution, they make distinct\npredictions for evolution in other galaxy properties.

As expected, the potential depends on the space point and\nresults in a mass shift of all massive particles near a black hole.

By introducing\nquasi-local scalars defined as integral functions along the rays, we obtain a\ncomplete and covariant representation of the models, leading to an initial\nvalue parametrization in which all scalars can be given by scaling laws\ndepending on two metric scale factors and two basic initial value functions.\nConsidering regular \"open\" LTB models whose space slices allow for a diverging\n$\\ell$, we provide the conditions on the radial coordinate so that its\nasymptotic limit corresponds to the limit as $\\ell\\to\\infty$. The \"asymptotic\nstate\" is then defined as this limit, together with asymptotic series expansion\naround it, evaluated for all metric functions, covariant scalars (local and\nquasi-local) and their fluctuations.

They are based on ideas of Weyl,\nEddington and Einstein and, in particular, on Einstein's proposal to specify\nthe space - time geometry by use of the Hamilton principle. More specifically,\nthe connection coefficients are derived by varying a `geometric' Lagrangian\nthat is supposed to be an arbitrary function of the generalized (non-symmetric)\nRicci curvature tensor (and, possibly, of other fundamental tensors) expressed\nin terms of the connection coefficients regarded as independent variables. In\naddition to the standard Einstein gravity, such a theory predicts dark energy\n(the cosmological constant, in the first approximation), a neutral massive (or,\ntachyonic) vector field, and massive (or, tachyonic) scalar fields. These\nfields couple only to gravity and may generate dark matter and/or inflation.\nThe masses (real or imaginary) have geometric origin and one cannot avoid their\nappearance in any concrete model. Further details of the theory - such as the\nnature of the vector and scalar fields that can describe massive particles,\ntachyons, or even `phantoms' - depend on the concrete choice of the geometric\nLagrangian. In `natural' geometric theories, which are discussed here, dark\nenergy is also unavoidable. Main parameters - mass, cosmological constant,\npossible dimensionless constants - cannot be predicted, but, in the framework\nof modern `multiverse' ideology, this is rather a virtue than a drawback of the\ntheory. To better understand possible applications of the theory we discuss\nsome further extensions of the affine models and analyze in more detail\napproximate (`physical') Lagrangians that can be applied to cosmology of the\nearly Universe. \n\n"}

The infall-velocity distribution is given at\n(1-3)R_{200} of the main cluster (where R_{200} is similar to the virial\nradius), and thus it gives the distribution of realistic initial velocities of\nsubclusters just before collision. These velocities can be compared with the\ninitial velocities used by the non-cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of\n1E0657-56 in the literature.

The main source\nof opacity in these objects is dust grains. We investigate two problems\ninvolving the effect of opacity on the evolution of planets of 3, 5, and 7 M_J.\nFirst, we pick three different overall metallicities for the planet and simply\nscale the opacity accordingly. We show that higher metallicity results in\nslower contraction as a result of higher opacity. It is found that the\npre-collapse time scale is proportional to the metallicity. In this scenario,\nsurvival of giant planets formed by gravitational instability is predicted to\nbe more likely around low-metallicity stars, since they evolve to the point of\ncollapse to small size on shorter time scales. But metal-rich planets, as a\nresult of longer contraction times, have the best opportunity to capture\nplanetesimals and form heavy-element cores. Second, we investigate the effects\nof opacity reduction as a result of grain growth and settling, for the same\nthree planetary masses and for three different values of overall metallicity.\nWhen these processes are included, the pre-collapse time scale is found to be\nof order 1000 years for the three masses, significantly shorter than the time\nscale calculated without these effects. In this case the time scale is found to\nbe relatively insensitive to planetary mass and composition. However, the\neffects of planetary rotation and accretion of gas and dust, which could\nincrease the timescale, are not included in the calculation.

The Coma cluster is\none of the nearest truly massive galaxy clusters, and is host to a\ncorrespondingly large system of globular clusters (GCs). We use imaging from\nthe HST/ACS Coma Cluster Survey to present the first definitive detection of a\nlarge population of intracluster GCs (IGCs) that fills the Coma cluster core\nand is not associated with individual galaxies. The GC surface density profile\naround the central massive elliptical galaxy, NGC 4874, is dominated at large\nradii by a population of IGCs that extend to the limit of our data (R<520 kpc).\nWe estimate that there are 47000+/-1600 (random) +4000/-5000 (systematic) IGCs\nout to this radius, and that they make up ~70% of the central GC system, making\nthis the largest GC system in the nearby Universe. Even including the GC\nsystems of other cluster galaxies, IGCs still make up ~30-45% of the GCs in the\ncluster core. Observational limits from previous studies of the intracluster\nlight (ICL) suggest that the IGC population has a high specific frequency. If\nthe IGC population has a specific frequency similar to high-S_N dwarf galaxies,\nthen the ICL has a total stellar mass of ~10^12 M_sun within the cluster core.\nThe ICL makes up approximately half of the stellar luminosity and one-third of\nthe stellar mass of the central (NGC4874+ICL) system. The color distribution of\nthe IGC population is bimodal, with blue, metal-poor GCs outnumbering red,\nmetal-rich GCs by a ratio of 4:1.

In this work, we show by simple\nexamples that anomalous symmetries can often be implemented at the expense of\nworking with mixed states having non-zero entropies. In particular there is the\nresult on color breaking by non-abelian magnetic monopoles. This anomaly can be\nrectified by using impure states.

The third, although it is stable with respect to\nclassical perturbations, can collapse quantum mechanically, and therefore\ncannot have an eternal past. \n\n"}

{"id": "1302.1103", "contents": "Title: Exploring Cartan gravity with dynamical symmetry breaking Abstract: It has been known for some time that General Relativity can be regarded as a\nYang-Mills-type gauge theory in a symmetry broken phase. In this picture the\ngravity sector is described by an $SO(1,4)$ or $SO(2,3)$ gauge field\n$A^{a}_{\\phantom{a}b\\mu}$ and Higgs field $V^{a}$ which acts to break the\nsymmetry down to that of the Lorentz group $SO(1,3)$. This symmetry breaking\nmirrors that of electroweak theory. However, a notable difference is that while\nthe Higgs field $\\Phi$ of electroweak theory is taken as a genuine dynamical\nfield satisfying a Klein-Gordon equation, the gauge independent norm $V^2\\equiv\n\\eta_{ab}V^{a}V^{b}$ of the Higgs-type field $V^a$ is typically regarded as\nnon-dynamical. Instead, in many treatments $V^a$ does not appear explicitly in\nthe formalism or is required to satisfy $V^2 = \\mathrm{const.} \\neq 0$ by means\nof a Lagrangian constraint. As an alternative to this we propose a class of\npolynomial actions that treat both the gauge connection\n$A^{a}_{\\phantom{a}b\\mu}$ and Higgs field $V^a$ as genuine dynamical fields\nwith no ad-hoc constraints imposed. The resultant equations of motion consist\nof a set of first-order partial differential equations.

Consequences for\n  secondary star formation in the context of self-enrichment via fast rotating\n  massive stars Abstract: The self-enrichment scenario for globular clusters (GC) requires large\namounts of residual gas after the initial formation of the first stellar\ngeneration. Recently, Krause et al. (2012) found that supernovae may not be\nable to expel that gas, as required to explain their present day gas-free\nstate, and suggested that a sudden accretion on to the dark remnants, at a\nstage when type II supernovae have ceased, may plausibly lead to fast gas\nexpulsion. Here, we explore the consequences of these results for the\nself-enrichment scenario via fast rotating massive stars (FRMS). We analyse the\ninteraction of FRMS with the intra-cluster medium (ICM), in particular where,\nwhen and how the second generation of stars may form. From the results, we\ndevelop a timeline of the first approximately 40 Myr of GC evolution. The\nresults of Paper I imply three phases during which the ICM is in a\nfundamentally different state, namely the wind bubble phase (lasting 3.5 to 8.8\nMyr), the supernova phase (lasting 26.2 to 31.5 Myr), and the dark remnant\naccretion phase (lasting 0.1 to 4 Myr): (i) Quickly after the first generation\nmassive stars have formed, stellar wind bubbles compress the ICM into thin\nfilaments. No stars may form in the normal way during this phase, due to the\nhigh Lyman-Werner flux density. If the first generation massive stars have\nhowever equatorial ejections, as we proposed in the FRMS scenario, accretion\nmay resume in the shadow of the equatorial ejecta.

{"id": "1502.04702", "contents": "Title: Cosmological and Astrophysical Probes of Vacuum Energy Abstract: Vacuum energy changes during cosmological phase transitions and becomes\nrelatively important at epochs just before phase transitions. For a viable\ncosmology the vacuum energy just after a phase transition must be set by the\ncritical temperature of the next phase transition, which exposes the\ncosmological constant problem from a different angle. Here we propose to\nexperimentally test the properties of vacuum energy under circumstances\ndifferent from our current vacuum. One promising avenue is to consider the\neffect of high density phases of QCD in neutron stars. Such phases have\ndifferent vacuum expectation values and a different vacuum energy from the\nnormal phase, which can contribute an order one fraction to the mass of neutron\nstars. Precise observations of the mass of neutron stars can potentially yield\ninformation about the gravitational properties of vacuum energy, which can\nsignificantly affect their mass-radius relation. A more direct test of cosmic\nevolution of vacuum energy could be inferred from a precise observation of the\nprimordial gravitational wave spectrum at frequencies corresponding to phase\ntransitions. While traditional cosmology predicts steps in the spectrum\ndetermined by the number of degrees of freedom both for the QCD and electroweak\nphase transitions, an adjustment mechanism for vacuum energy could\nsignificantly change this. In addition, there might be other phase transitions\nwhere the effect of vacuum energy could show up as a peak in the spectrum. \n\n"}

Thus the fate of\nrapidly-accreting Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs in the single-degenerate\nchannel remains more mysterious then ever. In this paper, we clarify the nature\nof ignition in Chandrasekhar-mass single-degenerate SNe Ia by analytically\nderiving the existence of a characteristic length scale which establishes a\ntransition from central ignitions to buoyancy-driven ignitions. Using this\ncriterion, combined with data from three-dimensional simulations of convection\nand ignition, we demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of ignition events\nwithin Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs in the single-degenerate channel are\nbuoyancy-driven, and consequently lack a vigorous deflagration phase.

Since activity is driven by the sublimation of volatiles, this\nis a puzzling result because this area is less exposed to the Sun and is\ntherefore expected to be cooler on average (Sierks et al. 2015).\n  We used a thermophysical model that takes into account thermal inertia,\nglobal self-heating, and shadowing, to compute surface temperatures of the\ncomet. We found that, for every rotation in the August--December 2014 period,\nsome parts of the neck region undergo the fastest temperature variations of the\ncomet's surface precisely because they are shadowed by their surrounding\nterrains. Our work suggests that these fast temperature changes are correlated\nto the early activity of the comet, and we put forward the hypothesis that\nerosion related to thermal cracking is operating at a high rate on the neck\nregion due to these rapid temperature variations. This may explain why the neck\ncontains some ice --as opposed to most other parts of the surface (Capaccioni\net al. 2015)-- and why it is the main source of the comet's early activity\n(Sierks et al. 2015).\n  In a broader context, these results indicate that thermal cracking can\noperate faster on atmosphereless bodies with significant concavities than\nimplied by currently available estimates (Delbo' et al. 2014). \n\n"}

Present laboratory\nconstraints on exotic spin-dependent interactions with pseudoscalar and axial\ncouplings for exchange boson masses between meV and eV are very poor compared\nto constraints on spin-independent interactions in the same mass range arising\nfrom spin-0 and spin-1 boson exchange.

Hopkins & Lee (2016) directly simulated\nthe dynamics of neutral dust grains in super-sonic MHD turbulence, typical of\nGMCs, and showed that the dust-to-gas fluctuations can exceed factor ~1000 on\nsmall scales, with important implications for star formation, stellar\nabundances, and dust behavior and growth. However, even in primarily neutral\ngas in GMCs, dust grains are negatively charged and Lorentz forces are\nnon-negligible. Therefore, we extend our previous study by including the\neffects of Lorentz forces on charged grains (in addition to drag). For small\ncharged grains (sizes <0.1 micron), Lorentz forces suppress dust-to-gas ratio\nfluctuations, while for large grains (sizes >1 micron), Lorentz forces have\nessentially no effect, trends that are well explained with a simple theory of\ndust magnetization.

By extending and\ngeneralising the study of Jones et al (2012), we demonstrate that this\nparameter should be less than or of order unity for a wide range of\nevolutionary scenarios, rising above unity only during the final stages of\noutside in clearing by external photoevaporation.

The dependence of the\ntidal interactions on the structural and rotational evolution of the star is of\npeculiar importance and should be correctly treated. We quantify how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of rotating low-mass stars evolves from\nthe pre-main sequence up to the red-giant branch depending on the initial\nstellar mass. We investigate the consequences of this evolution on planetary\norbital evolution. We couple the tidal dissipation formalism described in\nMathis (2015) to the stellar evolution code STAREVOL and apply it to rotating\nstars with masses between 0.3 and 1.4 M$_\\odot$. In addition, we generalize the\nwork of Bolmont & Mathis (2016) by following the orbital evolution of close-in\nplanets using the new tidal dissipation predictions for advanced phases of\nstellar evolution. On the PMS the evolution of tidal dissipation is controlled\nby the evolution of the internal structure of the contracting star. On the MS\nit is strongly driven by the variation of surface rotation that is impacted by\nmagnetized stellar winds braking. The main effect of taking into account the\nrotational evolution of the stars is to lower the tidal dissipation strength by\nabout four orders of magnitude on the main-sequence, compared to a normalized\ndissipation rate that only takes into account structural changes. The evolution\nof the dissipation strongly depends on the evolution of the internal structure\nand rotation of the star.

We show that the\nrole of BMS charges can be played by an infinite set of symmetries that emerge\nfrom the space-time foam predicted by quantum gravity. Specifically, we focus\non Yang-Mills fields embedded in the gravity described by the Holst\nformulation, and argue that the Yang-Mills and gravitational self-duality\nconditions in space-time bubbles are related to a new infinite dimensional\nglobal symmetry, hidden in the Lagrangian. Such a symmetry is manifested by the\nKac-Moody algebra, with zero central charges. This implies the existence, in\nthe space-time foam, of an infinite number of different instantons that are\ninterconnected by the Kac-Moody symmetry. These modes puncture the horizons of\nthe building block of the space-time bubbles.

Abstract: The mass, accretion rate and formation time of dark matter haloes near\nproto-filaments (identified as saddle points of the potential) are analytically\npredicted using a conditional version of the excursion set approach in its\nso-called \"upcrossing\" approximation. The model predicts that at fixed mass,\nmass accretion rate and formation time vary with orientation and distance from\nthe saddle, demonstrating that assembly bias is indeed influenced by the tides\nimposed by the cosmic web. Starved, early forming haloes of smaller mass lie\npreferentially along the main axis of filaments, while more massive and younger\nhaloes are found closer to the nodes. Distinct gradients for distinct tracers\nsuch as typical mass and accretion rate occur because the saddle condition is\nanisotropic, and because the statistics of these observables depend on both the\nconditional means and their covariances.

Spinning dust is one variety of AME that\ncould be partially polarized and therefore relevant for ongoing and future\ncosmic microwave background polarization studies. The Planck satellite mission\nidentified candidate AME regions in approximately $1^\\circ$ patches that were\nfound to have spectra generally consistent with spinning dust grain models. The\nspectra for one of these regions, G107.2+5.2, was also consistent with\noptically thick free-free emission because of a lack of measurements between 2\nand 20 GHz. Follow-up observations were needed. Therefore, we used the C-band\nreceiver (4 to 8 GHz) and the VEGAS spectrometer at the Green Bank Telescope to\nconstrain the AME mechanism. For the study described in this paper, we produced\nthree band averaged maps at 4.575, 5.625, and 6.125 GHz and used aperture\nphotometry to measure the spectral flux density in the region relative to the\nbackground. We found if the spinning dust description is correct, then the\nspinning dust signal peaks at $30.9 \\pm 1.4$ GHz, and it explains the excess\nemission. The morphology and spectrum together suggest the spinning dust grains\nare concentrated near S140, which is a star forming region inside our chosen\nphotometry aperture.

Here we present a novel numerical approach to\nastrophyiscal MHD simulations aimed to resolve this small-scale dynamo in\nfuture cosmological simulations. As a first step, we implement a fifth order\nWENO scheme in the new code WOMBAT. We show that this scheme doubles the\neffective resolution of the simulation and is thus less expensive than common\nsecond order schemes. WOMBAT uses a novel approach to parallelization and load\nbalancing developed in collaboration with performance engineers at Cray Inc.\nThis will allow us scale simulation to the exaflop regime and achieve kpc\nresolution in future cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters. Here we\ndemonstrate the excellent scaling properties of the code and argue that\nresolved simulations of the cosmological small scale dynamo within the whole\nvirial radius are possible in the next years. \n\n"}

In this paper we explore the mechanical coupling between\nthe core r-modes and the elastic crust, using a toy model of a constant density\nneutron star with a constant shear modulus crust. We find that, at spin\nfrequencies in excess of ~50 Hz, the r-modes strongly penetrate the crust. This\nreduces the relative motion (slippage) between the crust and the core compared\nto the rigid crust limit. We therefore revise down, by as much as a factor of\n10^2-10^3, the damping rate computed by BU, significantly reducing the maximal\npossible spin frequency of neutron star with a solid crust. The dependence of\nthe crust-core slippage on the spin frequency is complicated, and is very\nsensitive to the physical thickness of the crust.

While the body\nnutates at some rate, the internal stresses and strains within the body\noscillate at frequencies both higher and lower than this rate.

We compare a number of properties of GRGs with the corresponding\nproperties of NSGs, and analyse the statistical trends and correlations of\nphysical parameters, homogeneously determined for the sources, with their\n`fundamental' parameters. Using the Pearson partial-correlation test on the\ncorrelation between two variables in the presence of one or two other\nvariables, we examine which correlation is the strongest. The analysis clearly\nshows that GRGs do not form a separate class of radio sources. They most likely\nevolve with time from smaller sources, however under specific circumstances.\nAnalysing properties of GRGs and NSGs together, we find that (i) the core\nprominence does not correlate with the total radio luminosity (as does the core\npower), but it anti-correlates with the surface brightness of the lobes of\nsources, (ii) the energy density (and possibly the internal pressure) in the\nlobes is independent of redshift for constant radio luminosity and size of the\nsources, (iii) the equipartition magnetic-field strength, transformed into\nconstant source luminosity and redshift, strongly correlates with the source\nsize. We argue that this B_{eq} - D correlation reflects a more fundamental\ncorrelation between B_{eq} and the source age, (iv) both the rotation and\ndepolarisation measures suggest Faraday screens local to the lobes of sources,\nhowever their geometry and the composition of intervening material cannot be\ndetermined from the global polarisation characteristics. \n\n"}

Our simulations use\nthe Orion adaptive mesh refinement code to follow the collapse from ~0.1 pc\nscales to ~10 AU scales, for durations that cover the main fragmentation phase,\nusing three-dimensional gravito-radiation hydrodynamics. We find that for a\nwide range of initial conditions radiation feedback from accreting protostars\ninhibits the formation of fragments, so that the vast majority of the collapsed\nmass accretes onto one or a few objects. Most of the fragmentation that does\noccur takes place in massive, self-shielding disks. These are driven to\ngravitational instability by rapid accretion, producing rapid mass and angular\nmomentum transport that allows most of the gas to accrete onto the central star\nrather than forming fragments. In contrast, a control run using the same\ninitial conditions but an isothermal equation of state produces much more\nfragmentation, both in and out of the disk. We conclude that massive cores with\nobserved properties are not likely to fragment into many stars, so that, at\nleast at high masses, the core mass function probably determines the stellar\ninitial mass function.

The shocks are assumed to be due to a variety of galactic sources on a\nrange of scales. An analytic result for the kinematic vorticity generated by a\nshock passing through a radially-stratified two-dimensional isobaric model\ncloud is derived, assuming that the Mach number is not so large that the cloud\nis disrupted, and neglecting the shock curvature and cloud distortion.\nTwo-dimensional lattic gas hydrodynamic simulations at modest Mach numbers were\nused to verify the analytic result. The induced internal velocities are\ninitially a significant fraction of the shock speed divided by the square root\nof the density contrast, accounting for both the observed linewidth amplitudes\nand the apparent cloud-to-cloud linewidth-density scaling. The linewidth-size\nrelation could then be interpreted in terms of the well-known power spectrum of\na system of shocks.

We then\ninvestigate whether this surface term has an effect on the dynamics of the\naction-extremizing field configurations. This question appears to be\nsurprisingly nontrivial in the case of the open FLRW geometry, since surface\nterms tend to grow as fast as volume terms in the infinite volume limit. We\nfind that surface terms can be important for the dynamics of the field at a\nclassical and at a quantum level, when there are supercurvature perturbations. \n\n"}

Our\nmain objective is to examine whether the phenomenon of parametric\namplification, known to be responsible for the strong amplification of\nprimordial perturbations in the expanding Universe, can efficiently operate\nduring gravitational collapse. Although the time-varying gravitational field\ninside the star can, in principle, support such a process, we nevertheless find\nthat the perturbing field escapes from the star too early for amplification to\nbecome significant.

Evidence for the\nexistence of M-theory is still only circumstantial---no complete\nbackground-independent formulation of the theory yet exists. Matrix theory was\nfirst developed as a regularized theory of a supersymmetric quantum membrane.\nMore recently, the theory appeared in a different guise as the discrete\nlight-cone quantization of M-theory in flat space. These two approaches to\nmatrix theory are described in detail and compared. It is shown that matrix\ntheory is a well-defined quantum theory which reduces to a supersymmetric\ntheory of gravity at low energies. Although the fundamental degrees of freedom\nof matrix theory are essentially pointlike, it is shown that higher-dimensional\nfluctuating objects (branes) arise through the nonabelian structure of the\nmatrix degrees of freedom. The problem of formulating matrix theory in a\ngeneral space-time background is discussed, and the connections between matrix\ntheory and other related models are reviewed. \n\n"}

The presence of\na fundamental scale suggests that local Lorentz invariance may be violated at\nsufficiently high energies. Motivated by this possibility, recently, different\nmodels that violate Lorentz invariance locally have been used to evaluate the\ntrans-Planckian corrections to the inflationary density perturbation spectrum.\nHowever, certain astrophysical observations seem to indicate that local Lorentz\ninvariance may be preserved to extremely high energies. In such a situation, to\nstudy the trans-Planckian effects, it becomes imperative to consider models\nthat preserve local Lorentz invariance even as they contain a fundamental\nscale.

To mimic\nthe possible trans-Planckian effects, among various models, modified dispersion\nrelations have been popular in the literature. In almost all the earlier\nanalyzes, unlike the canonical scalar field driven inflation, the\ntrans-Planckian effects are introduced to the scalar/tensor perturbation\nequations in an ad hoc manner -- without calculating the stress-tensor of the\ncosmological perturbations from the covariant Lagrangian. In this work, we\nperform the gauge-invariant cosmological perturbations for the single-scalar\nfield inflation with the Jacobson-Corley dispersion relation by computing the\nfluctuations of all the fields including the unit time-like vector field which\ndefines a preferred rest frame. We show that: (i) The non-linear effects\nintroduce corrections only to the perturbed energy density. The corrections to\nthe energy density vanish in the super-Hubble scales.

{"id": "hep-th/9802172", "contents": "Title: Entropy Defined, Entropy Increase and Decoherence Understood, and Some\n  Black-Hole Puzzles Solved Abstract: Statistical mechanics explains thermodynamics in terms of (quantum) mechanics\nby equating the entropy of a microstate of a closed system with the logarithm\nof the number of microstates in the macrostate to which it belongs, but the\nquestion `what is a macrostate?' has never been answered except in a vague,\nsubjective, way. However Hawking's discovery of black hole evaporation led to a\nformula for black hole entropy with no subjective element. In this letter, we\nargue from this result, together with the assumption that `black hole\nthermodynamics is just ordinary thermodynamics applied to black holes', that a\nmacrostate for a general (quantum gravitational) closed system is an\nequivalence class of matter-gravity microstates with the same expectation\nvalues for the matter degrees of freedom alone. Not only does this finally\nanswer the question `what is entropy?', but it also predicts the equality of\nthe thermodynamic entropy of a black hole with the matter and the gravity\nentropy-like quantities derived from the Euclidean path integral. Furthermore\nit gives us a clear glimpse of an ultimate synthesis of quantum theory and\ngravity in which we see that (a) gravity acts as a universal environment, thus\npredicting that, if the initial state of the universe is unentangled, its\nentropy must go on increasing forever, (b) the gravitational field has degrees\nof freedom, but no observables, thus enabling gravity to perform the trick of\nproviding an objective continual process of decoherence. All the above rests on\nthe validity of unitarity. The `information-loss puzzle' had raised doubts\nabout that. But we suggest a resolution for this puzzle. \n\n"}

The second\nproperty identifies harmonic families of standing wave modes as the harmonic\noscillators of Planck's theory, since a family can only bear energy equal to\nexactly one of E, 2E, 3E, etc These two properties further imply that the\nenergy expectation gets averaged only over an individual family, as the\nequilibrium energy <E(f)> steadily available at a given mode would have\ncontributions from its entire harmonic family.

Coarse graining in classical physics is made natural\nby our limited powers of observation and computation. But in the modern quantum\nmechanics of closed systems, some measure of coarse graining is inescapable\nbecause there are no non-trivial, probabilistic, fine-grained descriptions.\nThis essay explores the consequences of that fact. Quantum theory allows for\nvarious coarse-grained descriptions some of which are mutually incompatible.\nFor most purposes, however, we are interested in the small subset of\n``quasiclassical descriptions'' defined by ranges of values of averages over\nsmall volumes of densities of conserved quantities such as energy and momentum\nand approximately conserved quantities such as baryon number. The\nnear-conservation of these quasiclassical quantities results in approximate\ndecoherence, predictability, and local equilibrium, leading to closed sets of\nequations of motion. In any description, information is sacrificed through the\ncoarse graining that yields decoherence and gives rise to probabilities for\nhistories. In quasiclassical descriptions, further information is sacrificed in\nexhibiting the emergent regularities summarized by classical equations of\nmotion. An appropriate entropy measures the loss of information. For a\n``quasiclassical realm'' this is connected with the usual thermodynamic entropy\nas obtained from statistical mechanics. It was low for the initial state of our\nuniverse and has been increasing since. \n\n"}

Daseinisation and the\n  Liberation of Quantum Theory Abstract: This paper is the second in a series whose goal is to develop a fundamentally\nnew way of constructing theories of physics. The motivation comes from a desire\nto address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating quantum theories\nof space and time. Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of\nphysics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain\nformal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics arises when\nthe topos is the category of sets. Other types of theory employ a different\ntopos. In this paper, we study in depth the topos representation of the\npropositional language, PL(S), for the case of quantum theory. In doing so, we\nmake a direct link with, and clarify, the earlier work on applying topos theory\nto quantum physics. The key step is a process we term `daseinisation' by which\na projection operator is mapped to a sub-object of the spectral presheaf--the\ntopos quantum analogue of a classical state space. In the second part of the\npaper we change gear with the introduction of the more sophisticated local\nlanguage L(S). From this point forward, throughout the rest of the series of\npapers, our attention will be devoted almost entirely to this language. In the\npresent paper, we use L(S) to study `truth objects' in the topos. These are\nobjects in the topos that play the role of states: a necessary development as\nthe spectral presheaf has no global elements, and hence there are no\nmicrostates in the sense of classical physics. Truth objects therefore play a\ncrucial role in our formalism. \n\n"}
