As\nthe included space in a HOBET (as in the shell model) is defined by the\noscillator energy, both long-distance (low-momentum) and short-distance\n(high-momentum) degrees of freedom reside in the high-energy excluded space. A\nHOBET effective interaction is developed in which a short-range\ncontact-gradient expansion is combined with an exact summation of the relative\nkinetic energy. By this means the very strong coupling of the included (P) and\nexcluded (Q) spaces by the kinetic energy is removed. One finds that the\ninterplay of QT and QV is governed by a single parameter kappa, the ratio of an\nobservable, the binding energy |E|, to a parameter in the effective theory, the\noscillator energy. Once the functional dependence on kappa is identified, the\nremaining order-by-order subtraction of the short-range physics residing in Q\nbecomes systematic and rapidly converging. Numerical calculations are used to\ndemonstrate how well the resulting expansion reproduces the running of Heff\nfrom high scales to a typical shell-model scale of 8 hbar omega. At N3LO\nvarious global properties of Heff are reproduced to a typical accuracy of\n0.01%, or about 1 keV.\n  The state-dependence of the effective interaction has been a troubling\nproblem in nuclear physics, and is embodied in the energy dependence of\nHeff(|E|) in the Bloch-Horowitz formalism.

The model in\nits infinite-size limit exhibits shape-phase transitions between spherical,\ndeformed prolate, and deformed oblate forms of the ground state. Finite-size\nprecursors of such behavior are verified by robust variations of nuclear\nproperties (nuclear masses, excitation energies, transition probabilities for\nlow lying levels) across the chart of nuclides. Simultaneously, the model\nserves as a theoretical laboratory for studying diverse general features of\nQPTs in interacting many-body systems, which differ in many respects from\nlattice models of solid-state physics. We outline the most important fields of\nthe present interest: (a) The coexistence of first- and second-order phase\ntransitions supports studies related to the microscopic origin of the QPT\nphenomena. (b) The competing quantum phases are characterized by specific\ndynamical symmetries and novel symmetry related approaches are developed to\ndescribe also the transitional dynamical domains.

All these aspects of IBM phase transitions are relevant in\nthe interpretation of experimental data and important for a fundamental\nunderstanding of the QPT phenomenon. \n\n"}

Previous theoretical\npredictions of the ferromagnetic phase transition have been based on the\nperturbation theory, which treats the gas parameter as a small number. On the\nother hand, Belitz, Kirkpatrick, and Vojta (BKV) have argued that the phase\ntransition in clean itinerant ferromagnets is generically of first order at low\ntemperatures, due to the correlation effects that lead to a nonanalytic term in\nthe free energy. The second-order perturbation theory predicts a first-order\nphase transition at $(k_{\\rm F}a)_c=1.054$, consistent with the BKV argument.\nHowever, since the critical gas parameter is expected to be of order O(1),\nperturbative predictions may be unreliable. In this paper we study the\nnonperturbative effects on the ferromagnetic phase transition by summing the\nparticle-particle ladder diagrams to all orders in the gas parameter.

The\ngoal of this paper is to set up the foundations of a microscopic theory to\nstudy the static aspects of induced fission as a function of the excitation\nenergy of the incident neutron, from thermal to fast neutrons. To account for\nthe high excitation energy of the compound nucleus, we employ a statistical\napproach based on finite-temperature nuclear density functional theory with\nSkyrme energy densities, which we benchmark on the 239 Pu(n,f) reaction. We\ncompute the evolution of the least-energy fission pathway across\nmultidimensional potential energy surfaces with up to five collective variables\nas a function of the nuclear temperature, and predict the evolution of both the\ninner and outer fission barriers as a function of the excitation energy of the\ncompound nucleus.

As briefly discussed\nin [T. Duguet, G. Hagen, Phys. Rev. C {\\bf 85}, 034330 (2012)], the dependence\nof ESPEs on one-nucleon transfer probability matrices makes them purely\ntheoretical quantities that \"run\" with the non-observable resolution scale\n$\\lambda$ employed in the calculation. Given that ESPEs provide a way to\ninterpret the many-body problem in terms of simpler theoretical ingredients,\nthe goal is to specify the terms, i.e. the exact sense and conditions, in which\nthis interpretation can be conducted meaningfully. State-of-the-art\nmulti-reference in-medium similarity renormalization group and self-consistent\nGorkov Green's function many-body calculations are employed to corroborate the\nformal analysis.

Eventually, practitioners can refer to nuclear\nshells and spectroscopic factors in their analyses of nuclear phenomena if, and\nonly if, they use consistent structure and reaction theoretical schemes based\non a fixed resolution scale they have agreed on prior to performing their\nanalysis and comparisons. \n\n"}

Theoretical Framework Abstract: We develop a theoretical approach for nuclear spectral functions at high\nmissing momenta and removal energies based on the multi-nucleon short-range\ncorrelation~(SRC) model. The approach is based on the effective Feynman\ndiagrammatic method which allows to account for the relativistic effects\nimportant in the SRC domain. In addition to two-nucleon SRC with center of mass\nmotion we derive also the contribution of three-nucleon SRCs to the nuclear\nspectral functions. The latter is modeled based on the assumption that 3N SRCs\nare a product of two sequential short range NN interactions. This approach\nallowed us to express the 3N SRC part of the nuclear spectral function as a\nconvolution of two NN SRCs. Thus the knowledge of 2N SRCs allows us to model\nboth two- and three-nucleon SRC contributions to the spectral function.

Applications of some of\nthese forces have been conducted in nuclear few- and many-body systems---with a\ncertain degree of success.

Among them is the issue of a proper uncertainty\nquantification of predictions obtained when applying these forces in {\\it ab\ninitio} calculations of nuclear structure and reactions. A related problem is\nthe order by order convergence of the chiral expansion.

If this is the case, any charge-dependent hadron\ncorrelations can only result from the background. Nevertheless, in this paper\nwe point out that in high multiplicity pA collisions a correlation between the\nmagnetic field and the event plane can appear. This is because triggering on\nthe high hadron multiplicity amounts to selecting Fock components of the\nincident proton with a large number of partons that are expected to have a\ntransverse size much larger than the average proton size. We introduce the\neffect of the fluctuating proton size in the Monte Carlo Glauber model and\nevaluate the resulting correlation between the magnetic field and the\nsecond-order event plane in both pA and nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the situation is considerably\ndifferent in models that extend the Higgs sector by a real scalar singlet.\nBased on effective-theory arguments, the extra scalar is always allowed to\ncouple to the heavy neutrinos via singlet Yukawa terms. This opens up new RHN\ndecay channels leading to larger $CP$ violation as well as to a stronger\ndeparture from thermal equilibrium during leptogenesis. As a consequence, the\nbaryon asymmetry can be generated for a lightest RHN mass as low as 500 GeV and\nwithout the need for a highly degenerate RHN mass spectrum. In fact, the\nrequirement of successful leptogenesis via the Higgs portal coupling singles\nout an interesting parameter region that can be probed in on-going and future\nexperiments.

These calculations should be\ncorrected for diffraction. Moreover, they miss the Gribov's inelastic shadowing\nwhich makes nuclei more transparent (color transparency). The magnitude of this\neffect rises with energy and it may dramatically affect the normalization of\nthe RHIC data. We evaluate these corrections employing the light-cone dipole\nformalism and found a rather modest corrections for the current normalization\nof the d-Au data. The results of experiments insensitive to diffraction\n(PHENIX, PHOBOS) should be renormalized by about 20% down, while those which\ninclude diffraction (STAR), by only 10%. Such a correction completely\neliminates the Cronin enhancement in the PHENIX data for pions. The largest\ntheoretical uncertainty comes from the part of the inelastic shadowing which is\nrelated to diffractive gluon radiation, or gluon shadowing.

At high temperatures\n(above the critical temperature T_c) we use the sound velocity function\nobtained from the recent lattice simulations of QCD, whereas at low\ntemperatures we use the ideal hadron gas model.
