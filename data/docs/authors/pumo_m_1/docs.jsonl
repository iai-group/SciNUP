We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

To accomplish this, current models invoke heating\nfrom supernovae, and energy injection from active galactic nuclei. However,\nobservations of radio-loud active galactic nuclei suggest that their feedback\nis likely to not be as efficient as required, signaling the need for additional\nheating processes. We propose the self-annihilation of weakly interacting\nmassive particles that constitute dark matter as a steady source of heating. In\nthis paper, we explore the circumstances under which this process may provide\nthe required energy input. To do so, dark matter annihilations are incorporated\ninto a galaxy formation model within the Millennium cosmological simulation.\nEnergy input from self-annihilation can compensate for all the required gas\ncooling and reproduce the observed galaxy luminosity function only for what\nappear to be extreme values of the relevant key parameters. The key parameters\nare: the slope of the inner density profile of dark matter haloes and the outer\nspike radius. The inner density profile needs to be steepened to slopes of -1.5\nor more and the outer spike radius needs to extend to a few tens of parsecs on\ngalaxy scales and a kpc or so on cluster scales. If neutralinos or any thermal\nrelic WIMP with s-wave annihilation constitute dark matter, their\nself-annihilation is inevitable and could provide enough power to modulate\ngalaxy formation. Energy from self-annihilating WIMPs could be yet another\npiece of the feedback puzzle along with supernovae and active galactic nuclei. \n\n"}

However, the bulk of the Carina red giants are depleted in the [alpha/Fe]\nabundance ratios with respect to the Galactic halo at a given metallicity. One\nof our targets, with a [Fe/H] of -1.5 dex, is considerably depleted in almost\nall of the alpha-elements by ~0.5 dex compared to the solar values. Such a low\n[alpha/Fe] can be produced by stochastical fluctuations in terms of an\nincomplete mixing of single Type Ia and II SNe events into the ISM.

This suggests that Carina's SF history varies with\nposition within the galaxy, with incomplete mixing. Alternatively, the SF rate\nis so low that the high-mass stellar IMF is sparsely populated, as\nstatistically expected in low-mass star clusters, leading to real scatter in\nthe resultant mass-integrated yields.

We demonstrate how the area covered by the hotspot at the neutron\nstar surface is decreasing in the course of the outburst together with the\nreflection amplitude. These trends are in agreement with the natural scenario,\nwhere the disc inner edge is receding from the neutron star as the mass\naccretion rate drops. These findings are further supported by the variations of\nthe pulse profiles, which clearly show the presence of the secondary maximum at\nthe late stages of the outburst after October 29. This fact can be interpreted\nas the disc receding sufficiently far from the neutron star to open the view of\nthe lower magnetic pole.

The integrated mass-loss rate over all\nintermediate and high mass-loss rate carbon-rich AGB candidates in the LMC is\n8.5x10^-3 solar mass per year, up to 2.1x10^-2 solar mass per year. This number\ncould be increased up to 2.7x10^-2 solar mass per year, if oxygen-rich stars\nare included. This is overall consistent with theoretical expectations,\nconsidering the star formation rate when these low- and intermediate-mass stars\nwhere formed, and the initial mass functions.

Our calculations show that the highest mass black holes observed\nin the Galaxy M_bh = 15 Msun in the high metallicity environment (Z=Zsun=0.02)\ncan be explained with stellar models and the wind mass loss rates adopted here.\nTo reach this result we had to set Luminous Blue Variable mass loss rates at\nthe level of about 0.0001 Msun/yr and to employ metallicity dependent\nWolf-Rayet winds. With such winds, calibrated on Galactic black hole mass\nmeasurements, the maximum black hole mass obtained for moderate metallicity\n(Z=0.3 Zsun=0.006) is M_bh,max = 30 Msun.

We calculate the accretion luminosity of a system based on the\naccretion-rate which is assumed to be equal to the mass-supply rate at the\nradius of ~10^-2 pc. For the models with high temperature gas at large radii\n(~10 pc) and high luminosities, we find a strong correlation between the\nmass-outflow rate (Mdot_out) and the luminosity (L). The power law index (q)\ndescribing the Mdot_out-L relation is q=2.0(+/-0.1), which is very similar to\nthat for radiation-driven stellar and disc wind models. More surprisingly, for\nhigh density at large radii, we find steady state solutions with the accretion\nluminosity exceeding the Eddington limit. The super-Eddington accretion\nproceeds in the equatorial region and is possible because the radiation flux\nfrom the disc is significantly reduced in the equatorial direction due to the\ngeometrical foreshortening effect. In all models, an outflow is driven from an\ninflow with sub-Keplerian rotation.

We have compared our data to self-consistent\npassive-disk model spectra, for which the same quantities were derived. We\nconfirm the literature result that the difference in continuum emission between\ngroup I and II sources can largely be explained by a different amount of small\ndust grains. However, we report a strong correlation between the [30/13.5] and\n[13.5/7] flux ratios for Meeus group II sources.

Most of these\nclusters are confined to a narrow age range centred around 10 Myr because of\nobservational constraints. At this age the cluster light is dominated by\nluminous evolved stars, such as red supergiants, with initial masses of ~13-22\nMsun for which (primordial) binarity is high. In this study we investigate to\nwhat extent the observed excess velocity dispersion is the result of the\norbital motions of binaries.

In the community, some scientists have started doubting about the\nvalidity of the classical tools to analyze these very accurate light curves.\n  This work provides the asteroseismic community with answers to this question\nshowing that (1) it is physically possible for a star to excite at a time and\nwith the observed amplitudes such a large number of modes; and (2) that the\nkinetic energy accumulated in all those modes does not destroy the equilibrium\nof the star. Consequently, mathematical tools presently applied in the analyses\nof light curves can a priori be trusted.

Important nucleosynthesis processes\n(alpha-process, charged-particle reactions, r-process, and vp-process) occur or\nmight occur in this environment.

Compared\nto its twins, the Sun exhibits a deficiency of refractory elements (those with\ncondensation temperatures Tc>900K) relative to volatiles (Tc<900K). This\nfinding is speculated to be a signature of the planet formation that occurred\nmore efficiently around the Sun compared with the majority of solar twins.\nFurthermore, within this scenario, it seems more likely that the abundance\npatterns found are specifically related to the formation of terrestrial\nplanets. In this work we analyze abundance results from six large independent\nstellar abundance surveys to determine whether they confirm or reject this\nobservational finding. We show that the elemental abundances derived for solar\nanalogs in these six studies are consistent with the Tc trend suggested as a\nplanet formation signature. The same conclusion is reached when those results\nare averaged heterogeneously. We also investigate the dependency of the\nabundances with first ionization potential (FIP), which correlates well with\nTc.

Its domain of applicability, that is baryonic densities ranging from about\n$\\rho>10^8$ g $\\cdot$ cm$^{-3}$ to normal nuclear density, temperatures between\n1 and 20 MeV and proton fractions between 0.5 and 0, make it suitable for the\ndescription of baryonic matter produced in supernovae explosions and\nproto-neutron stars. The first finding is that, contrary to the common belief,\nthe crust-core transition is not first order, and for all subsaturation\ndensities matter can be viewed as a continuous fluid mixture between free\nnucleons and massive nuclei.

The\nkey ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on\nrelatively short timescales, to a point where the radius is comparable to or\nlarger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a\nconfiguration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to\nsubstantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral\ngrazings in an eccentric system could quickly escalate to a catastrophic\nencounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the\nphotosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, as a result of the primary\nstar increasing its own radius. This is motivated by the case of $\\eta$\nCarinae, where such a collision must have occured if conventional estimates of\nthe present-day orbit are correct, and where brief peaks in the light curve\ncoincide with periastron. Stellar collisions may explain brief recurring LBV\noutbursts like SN 2000ch and SN 2009ip, and perhaps outbursts from relatively\nlow-mass progenitor stars (collisons are not necessarily the exclusive domain\nof very luminous stars).

We find that despite starting with a strongly supercritical mass\nto flux ratio, the magnetic field has three effects. First, the field offers\nlocally support against gravitational collapse in the accretion flow,\nsubstantially reducing the amount of secondary fragmentation in comparison to\nthe gas dynamical case. Second, the field drains angular momentum from the\ncollapsing gas, further increasing the amount of material available for\naccretion by the central, massive, protostar, and thus increasing its final\nmass by about 50% from the purely gas dynamical case. Third, the field is wound\nup by the rotation of the flow, driving a tower flow.

The allowed parameter\nregion for SFXT is restricted in a relatively narrow window in $P_{\\rm{orb}} -\ne$ diagram. Binary systems with large eccentricities ($e \\ga 0.4$) and moderate\norbital periods ($P_{\\rm{orb}} \\sim 10$ d) are prone to show periodic X-ray\noutbursts which are characteristic for SFXT. We confirm that systems with a\nlong orbital period of more than 100 days cannot produce bright X-ray flares in\nthe simple clumpy wind scenario. \n\n"}

This process occurs much deeper than the conventional\nmatter-induced MSW effect and hence may have an impact on nucleosynthesis. In\nthis paper we explore the effects of collective neutrino oscillations on the\nr-process, using representative late-time neutrino spectra and outflow models.\nWe find that accurate modeling of the collective oscillations is essential for\nthis analysis. As an illustration, the often-used \"single-angle\" approximation\nmakes grossly inaccurate predictions for the yields in our setup. With the\nproper multiangle treatment, the effect of the oscillations is found to be less\ndramatic, but still significant. Since the oscillation patterns are sensitive\nto the details of the emitted fluxes and the sign of the neutrino mass\nhierarchy, so are the r-process yields. The magnitude of the effect also\ndepends sensitively on the astrophysical conditions - in particular on the\ninterplay between the time when nuclei begin to exist in significant numbers\nand the time when the collective oscillation begins. A more definitive\nunderstanding of the astrophysical conditions, and accurate modeling of the\ncollective oscillations for those conditions, is necessary. \n\n"}

Particularly strong is the global gravitational\ninstability, which arises when the disc mass is of order 0.1 of the mass of the\ncentral star and has a characteristic spatial scale much greater than the\ndisc's vertical scale-height. In this paper we use three-dimensional numerical\nhydrodynamics to study the development of gravitational instabilities in a disc\nwhich is embedded in a dense, gaseous envelope. We find that global\ngravitational instabilities are the dominant mode of angular momentum transport\nin the disc with infall, in contrast to otherwise identical isolated discs. The\naccretion torques created by low-order, global modes of the gravitational\ninstability in a disc subject to infall are larger by a factor of several than\nan isolated disc of the same mass. We show that this global gravitational\ninstability is driven by the strong vertical shear at the interface between the\ndisc and the envelope, and suggest that this process may be an important means\nof driving accretion on to young stars. \n\n"}

To find signs of newly formed dust, we\nanalyze all available mid-infrared (MIR) archival data from the Spitzer Space\nTelescope. We re-reduce and analyze data from IRAC, MIPS and IRS instruments\nobtained between +98 and +1381 days after explosion, generating light curves\nand spectra for each epoch. Observed spectral energy distributions are fitted\nwith both analytic and numerical models, using the radiative-transfer code\nMOCASSIN for the latter ones. We also use imaging polarimetric data obtained at\n+425 days by the Hubble Space Telescope. We present convincing evidence of dust\nformation in the ejecta of SN 2004dj from MIR light curves and spectra.\nSignificant MIR excess flux is detected in all bands between 3.6 and 24 um. In\nthe optical, a ~0.8% polarization is also detected at a 2-sigma level, which\nexceeds the interstellar polarization in that direction. Our analysis shows\nthat the freshly-formed dust around SN 2004dj can be modeled assuming a nearly\nspherical shell containing amorphous carbon grains, cooling from ~700 K to ~400\nK between +267 and +1246 days. Persistent excess flux has been found above 10\num, which is explained by a cold (~115 K) dust component. If this cold dust is\nof circumstellar origin, it is likely to be condensed in a cool, dense shell\nbetween the forward and reverse shocks.

Despite the\ngeneral agreement between their models and seismic and non-seismic constraints,\nthere are serious problems pertaining to their interior. The good agreement\nbetween the sound speed and base radius of the convective zone of the Sun and\nthe solar models is broken apart by a recent revision in solar chemical\ncomposition. For $\\alpha$ Cen A and B, however, it is not possible to fit\nmodels with the same age and chemical composition to all seismic and\nnon-seismic observational constraints. At the age deduced from seismic\nconstraints, the luminosity ratio ($L_{\\rm A}/L_{\\rm B}$) of the models is\nsignificantly lower than the ratio taken from the observed luminosities.\nEnhancement of opacity as a function of temperature is one way to restore the\nagreement between solar models and the Sun, but such an enhancement does not\nalter the situation for $\\alpha$ Cen A and B. The reason is that models of both\ncomponents are influenced in a similar manner and consequently the luminosity\nratio doesn't change much. In the present study, problems pertaining to the\ninterior of these three stars with a single expression for opacity enhancement\nare modelled. The opacity enhancement is expressed as a function of density,\nionization degree of heavy elements (oxygen), and temperature. According to\nthis expression, for improvement of the models the required opacity enhancement\nfor $\\alpha$ Cen A and B at $\\log(T)$= 6.5, for example, is about 7 and 22 per\ncent, respectively.

We use 21-cm observations of HI as a tracer\nof thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of Galactic dust\nemission and use the 143 GHz Planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmic\nmicrowave background anisotropies. Both of these cleaning processes are\nnecessary to avoid significant contamination of the CIB signal. We measure\ncorrelated CIB structure across frequencies. As expected, the correlation\ndecreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution of\nhigh-redshift galaxies to CIB anisotropies increases with wavelengths. We find\nno significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the CIB\nanisotropies and the CIB mean, with Delta I/I=15% from 217 to 857 GHz. In terms\nof clustering properties, the Planck data alone rule out the linear scale- and\nredshift-independent bias model.

Recent studies\nhave shown that magnetic braking is strong enough to suppress the formation of\nrotationally supported disks in the ideal MHD limit. Whether non-ideal MHD\neffects can enable disk formation remains unsettled. We carry out a first study\non how disk formation in magnetic clouds is modified by the Hall effect, the\nleast explored of the three non-ideal MHD effects in star formation (the other\ntwo being ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation). For illustrative\npurposes, we consider a simplified problem of a non-self-gravitating,\nmagnetized envelope collapsing onto a central protostar of fixed mass. We find\nthat the Hall effect can spin up the inner part of the collapsing flow to\nKeplerian speed, producing a rotationally supported disk. The disk is generated\nthrough a Hall-induced magnetic torque. Disk formation occurs even when the\nenvelope is initially non-rotating, provided that the Hall coefficient is large\nenough. When the magnetic field orientation is flipped, the direction of disk\nrotation is reversed as well. The implication is that the Hall effect can in\nprinciple produce both regularly rotating and counter-rotating disks around\nprotostars. We conclude that the Hall effect is an important factor to consider\nin studying the angular momentum evolution of magnetized star formation in\ngeneral and disk formation in particular. \n\n"}

We find no variations of the overall stellar population properties\namong the different samples of cluster early-type galaxies. However, when\ncomparing cluster versus field stellar population properties we find that, even\nif the (star formation weighted) ages are similar and depend only on galaxy\nmass, the ones in the field do employ longer timescales to assemble their final\nmass. We find that, approximately 1 Gyr after the onset of star formation, the\nmajority (75%) of cluster galaxies have already assembled most (> 80%) of their\nfinal mass, while, by the same time, fewer (35%) field ETGs have. Thus we\nconclude that while galaxy mass regulates the timing of galaxy formation, the\nenvironment regulates the timescale of their star formation histories. \n\n"}

We find\nthat at solar metallicity Type Ic SN progenitors travel shorter distances than\nthe progenitors of other SN types because they are typically more massive and\nthus have shorter lifetimes. Those of Type IIP SN can fly farthest about 48 pc\non average at solar metallicity.

Energetically soft, with semi-major axes exceeding the\ninitial size of their birth cluster, it is puzzling how these binaries are\ncreated and preserved. We provide an interpretation of the formation of these\nbinaries that explains the total number formed and their distribution of\nenergies. A population of weakly bound binaries can always be found in the\ncluster, in accordance with statistical detailed balance, limited at the soft\nend only by the current size of the cluster and whatever observational criteria\nare imposed. At any given time, the observed soft binary distribution is\npredominantly a snapshot of a transient population. However, there is a\nconstantly growing population of long-lived soft binaries that are removed from\nthe detailed balance cycle due to the changing density and velocity dispersion\nof an expanding cluster. The total number of wide binaries that form, and their\nenergy distribution, are insensitive to the cluster population; the number is\napproximately one per cluster. This suggests that a population composed of many\ndissolved small-N clusters will more efficiently populate the field with wide\nbinaries than that composed of dissolved large-N clusters.

The answer is vital for\nunderstanding neutron star formation in core collapse supernovae. Furthermore,\nthis system raises interesting issues about the nature of the progenitor binary\nand how it evolved during its mass exchanging X-ray phase. In this paper we\ndiscuss the progenitor evolution of PSR J1614-2230. We have performed detailed\nstellar evolution modelling of intermediate-mass X-ray binaries undergoing Case\nA Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) and applied an analytic parameterization for\ncalculating the outcome of either a common envelope evolution or the highly\nsuper-Eddington isotropic re-emission mode. We find two viable possibilities\nfor the formation of the PSR J1614-2230 system: either it contained a 2.2-2.6\nM_sun giant donor star and evolved through a common envelope and spiral-in\nphase or, more likely, it descended from a close binary system with a 4.0-5.0\nM_sun main sequence donor star via Case A RLO. We conclude that the neutron\nstar must have been born with a mass of ~1.95 M_sun or 1.7+-0.15 M_sun,\nrespectively - which significantly exceeds neutron star birth masses in\npreviously discovered radio pulsar systems.

Strong magnetic fields (~10^{15} G) and short spin periods\n(~1-10 ms) have an important influence on how the magnetar interacts with the\ninfalling material. At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high\naccretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is\ncommonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion\ncauses the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and\nproduce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a\nblack hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low\naccretion rates, the magnetar is in the \"propeller regime\" and avoids becoming\na black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the\nmagnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial\nprotoneutron star is spinning rapidly. Even when the magnetar survives, it\naccretes at least ~0.3 solar masses, so we expect magnetars born within these\ntypes of environments to be more massive than the 1.4 solar masses typically\nassociated with neutron stars. The propeller mechanism converts the ~10^{52}\nergs of spin energy in the magnetar into the kinetic energy of an outflow,\nwhich shock heats the outgoing supernova ejecta during the first ~10-30 s. For\na small ~5 solar mass hydrogen-poor envelope, this energy creates a brighter,\nfaster evolving supernova with high ejecta velocities ~(1-3)*10^4 km/s and may\nappear as a broad-lined Type Ib/c supernova.

These peculiar Na abundances are\nnot shared by stars in other environments often assumed to undergo a similar\nchemical evolution, such as in the field of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. These\nO and Na abundances match well the yields of the massive asymptotic giant\nbranch stars (AGB) in the same range of metallicity, suggesting that the stars\nat [Fe/H]>-1.3 in omega Cen are likely to have formed directly from the pure\nejecta of massive AGBs of the same metallicities. This is possible if the\nmassive AGBs of [Fe/H]>-1.3 in the progenitor system evolve when all the\npristine gas surrounding the cluster has been exhausted by the previous star\nformation events, or the proto--cluster interaction with the Galaxy caused the\nloss of a significant fraction of its mass, or of its dark matter halo, and the\nsupernova ejecta have been able to clear the gas out of the system. The absence\nof dilution in the metal richer populations lends further support to a scenario\nof the formation of second generation stars in cooling flows from massive AGB\nprogenitors. We suggest that the entire formation of omega Cen took place in a\nfew 10^8yr, and discuss the problem of a prompt formation of s--process\nelements. \n\n"}

In the\ncalculations of dust formation, we apply the nucleation and grain growth theory\nand consider the two cases with and without formation of CO and SiO molecules.\nThe results of the calculations show that for the sticking probability of\nalpha_j=1, C, silicate, Si, and FeS grains can condense at early times of\n~100--300 days after the explosion, whereas Fe and SiC grains cannot form\nsubstantially. Due to the low gas density in SNe Ia with no H-envelope, the\naverage radii of the newly formed grains are generally below 0.01 micron, being\nmuch smaller than those in Type II-P SNe. This supports our previous conclusion\nthat the radius of dust formed in the ejecta is smaller in SNe with less\nmassive envelopes. The total dust mass ranges from 3x10^{-4} M_sun to 0.2 M_sun\nfor alpha_j=0.1--1, depending on whether or not CO and SiO molecules are\nformed. We also estimate the optical depths and thermal emission by the newly\nformed dust and compare to the relevant observations of SNe Ia. We find that\nthe formation of C grains in SNe Ia is suppressed to be consistent with the\nobservational constraints. This implies that energetic photons and electrons\nheavily depress the formation efficiency of C grains or that the outermost C-O\nlayer of SNe Ia is almost fully burned. Finally, we perform the calculations of\ndust destruction in the SN remnants and find that dust grains formed in the\nejecta of SNe Ia are almost completely destroyed in the shocked gas before\nbeing injected into the interstellar medium.

Radial velocity monitoring of very cool dwarfs such as late M- and\nhot L-dwarfs has become a promising tool to search for rocky planets as well as\nto follow-up planetary candidates around dwarfs found by transit surveys. These\nstars are faint at optical wavelengths, as their spectral flux distribution\npeaks at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. For this reason, it is desirable to\nmeasure the radial velocities in this wavelength regime. However, in the NIR\nthere are only very few medium- and high-resolution spectrographs available\nwhich are mounted at large telescopes. In the near future, high-resolution\nspectrographs for the NIR will be built, which will allow us to search for\nrocky planets around cool M-dwarfs and L-dwarfs from radial velocities\nmonitoring.\n  Methods. Stellar atmosphere synthetic models for an M- and an L-dwarf with\ntemperatures of 2200 K and 1800 K, respectively, and a theoretical spectrum of\nthe Earth's transmission in the spectral range from 0.9 to 2.5 \\mum are used.\nWe simulate a series of Doppler-shifted spectra observed with different\nresolving powers and signal-to-noise ratios, and for different rotational\nbroadenings of the dwarf.

The main addition in this work is that for the CMB data\nset, we explicitly include the angular power spectra C_l for TT, TE and EE\nmodes in our analysis which seem to contain somewhat more information than\ntaking the electron scattering optical depth tau_{el} as a single data point.\nUsing Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, we find that all the quantities related\nto reionization can be severely constrained at z < 6 whereas a broad range of\nreionization histories at z > 6 are still permitted by the current data sets.\nWith currently available data from WMAP7, we constrain 0.080 < tau_{el} < 0.112\n(95% CL) and also conclude that reionization is 50% complete between 9.0 <\nz(Q_{HII} = 0.5) < 11.8 (95% CL) and is 99% complete between 5.8 < z(Q_{HII} =\n0.99) < 10.4 (95% CL).

We propose three main groups to describe the observed variety in\npulsating A-F type stars: gamma Dor, delta Sct, and hybrid stars. We assign 63%\nof our sample to one of the three groups, and identify the remaining part as\nrotationally modulated/active stars, binaries, stars of different spectral\ntype, or stars that show no clear periodic variability. 23% of the stars (171\nstars) are hybrid stars, which is a much larger fraction than what has been\nobserved before. We characterize for the first time a large number of A-F type\nstars (475 stars) in terms of number of detected frequencies, frequency range,\nand typical pulsation amplitudes. The majority of hybrid stars show frequencies\nwith all kinds of periodicities within the gamma Dor and delta Sct range, also\nbetween 5 and 10 c/d, which is a challenge for the current models.

In an edge-on system, the dust \"clumps\" periodically\npass in front of the star as the planet orbits, occulting and\nforward-scattering starlight. In this paper, we predict the shape and magnitude\nof the corresponding transit signal.

As pointed out by Lyne et al., the presence of these pulsars cannot\nbe explained by core-collapse supernovae, as is commonly assumed for their\ncounterparts in the Galactic disk. We apply a Bayesian analysis to the results\nfrom surveys for radio pulsars in globular clusters and find the number of\npotentially observable non-recycled radio pulsars present in all clusters to be\n< 3600. Accounting for beaming and retention considerations, the implied birth\nrate for any formation scenario for all 97 clusters is < 0.25 pulsars per\ncentury assuming a Maxwellian distribution of velocities with a dispersion of\n10 km s^{-1}. The implied birth rates for higher velocity dispersions are\nsubstantially higher than inferred for such pulsars in the Galactic disk. This\nsuggests that the velocity dispersion of young pulsars in globular clusters is\nsignificantly lower than those of disk pulsars. These numbers may be\nsubstantial overestimates due to the fact that the currently known sample of\nyoung pulsars is observed only in metal-rich clusters. We propose that young\npulsars may only be formed in globular clusters with metallicities with\nlog[Fe/H] > -0.6. In this case, the potentially observable population of such\nyoung pulsars is 447^{+1420}_{-399} (the error bars give the 95% confidence\ninterval) and their birth rate is 0.012^{+0.037}_{-0.010} pulsars per century.\nThe mostly likely creation scenario to explain these pulsars is the electron\ncapture supernova of a OMgNe white dwarf. \n\n"}

The observed X-ray flux (and polarization state)\nis fundamentally a convolution of the cross-section for the hard X-ray emission\nprocess(es) in question with the electron distribution function, which is in\nturn a function of energy, direction, spatial location and time. To address the\nproblems of particle propagation and acceleration one needs to infer as much\ninformation as possible on this electron distribution function, through a\ndeconvolution of this fundamental relationship. This review presents recent\nprogress toward this goal using spectroscopic, imaging and polarization\nmeasurements, primarily from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic\nImager (RHESSI). Previous conclusions regarding the energy, angular (pitch\nangle) and spatial distributions of energetic electrons in solar flares are\ncritically reviewed.

This situation\npersists despite the potential for the Milky Way to serve as the ultimate SFR\ncalibrator for external galaxies. We show that various estimates for the\nGalactic SFR are consistent with one another once they have been normalized to\nthe same initial mass function (IMF) and massive star models, converging to 1.9\n+/- 0.4 M_sun/yr. However, standard SFR diagnostics are vulnerable to\nsystematics founded in the use of indirect observational tracers sensitive only\nto high-mass stars. We find that absolute SFRs measured using resolved\nlow/intermediate-mass stellar populations in Galactic H II regions are\nsystematically higher by factors of ~2-3 as compared with calibrations for SFRs\nmeasured from mid-IR and radio emission. We discuss some potential explanations\nfor this discrepancy and conclude that it could be allayed if (1) the power-law\nslope of the IMF for intermediate-mass (1.5 M_sun < m < 5 M_sun) stars were\nsteeper than the Salpeter slope, or (2) a correction factor was applied to the\nextragalactic 24 micron SFR calibrations to account for the duration of star\nformation in individual mid-IR-bright H II regions relative to the lifetimes of\nO stars.

In the alternative dynamical ejection scenario, runaway\nstars are formed through gravitational interactions between stars and binaries\nin dense, compact clusters or cluster cores.

In particular, dust can overtake H_2 as the leading\ncoolant at very high densities. The aim of this work is to determine the\ninfluence of dust cooling on the fragmentation of very low metallicity gas. To\ninvestigate this, we make use of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations with\nsink particles to replace contracting protostars, and analyze the collapse and\nfurther fragmentation of star-forming clouds. We follow the thermodynamic\nresponse of the gas by solving the full thermal energy equation, and also track\nthe behavior of the dust temperature and the chemical evolution of the gas. We\nmodel four clouds with different metallicities (10^{-4}, 10^{-5}, 10^{-6}\nZ_Sol, and 0), and determine the properties of each cloud at the point at which\nit undergoes gravitational fragmentation. We find evidence for fragmentation in\nall four cases, and hence conclude that there is no critical metallicity below\nwhich fragmentation is impossible. Nevertheless, there is a clear change in the\nbehavior of the clouds at Z = 10^{-5} Z_Sol, caused by the fact that at this\nmetallicity, fragmentation takes longer to occur than accretion, leading to a\nflat mass function at lower metallicities. \n\n"}

The emission lines exhibit\nasymmetric blueshifted profiles, which implies that the receding hemisphere of\nthe SN is obscured by dust. The [O III] line, in particular, exhibits a\ncomplete suppression of its red wing. This could be the result of the expected\nwavelength dependence for dust extinction or a smaller radial distribution for\n[O III]. In the latter case, the red wing of [O III] could be absorbed by core\ndust, while both the blue and red wings are absorbed by dust within the cool\ndense shell between the forward and reverse shocks; this interpretation could\nexplain why late-time [O III] emission from SNe is often weaker than models\npredict.

The reason is that stellar winds have\nbeen found to be clumped, which results in the reduction of unclumped empirical\nmass-loss rates. Most stellar evolution models employ theoretical mass-loss\nrates which are already reduced by a moderate factor of ~2-3 compared to\nnon-corrected empirical rates. A key question is whether these reduced rates\nare of the correct order of magnitude, or if they should be reduced even\nfurther, which would mean that the alternative of eruptive mass loss becomes\nnecessary. Here we introduce the transition mass-loss rate (dM/dt)_trans\nbetween O and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Its novelty is that it is model\nindependent. All that is required is postulating the spectroscopic transition\npoint in a given data-set, and determining the stellar luminosity, which is far\nless model dependent than the mass-loss rate. The transition mass-loss rate is\nsubsequently used to calibrate stellar wind strength by its application to the\nOf/WNh stars in the Arches cluster. Good agreement is found with two\nalternative modelling/theoretical results, suggesting that the rates provided\nby current theoretical models are of the right order of magnitude in the\n~50Msun mass range. Our results do not confirm the specific need for eruptive\nmass loss as Luminous Blue Variables, and current stellar evolution modelling\nfor Galactic massive stars seems sound.

Because Fe (rather than O) abundance drives the late stage evolution of\nthe massive stars that are the progenitors of CCSNe, and because Fe enrichment\nlags O enrichment, we find a general conversion from O abundance to Fe\nabundance.

An essentially unavoidable consequence of\nmass loss during the explosion is that the companion must have an overextended\nenvelope after the explosion. While this has been noted previously, it has not\nbeen strongly emphasized as an inevitable consequence. We calculate the future\nevolution of the companion by injecting 2-6 10^47 ergs into the stellar\nevolution model of a 1 Msun donor star based on the post-explosion progenitors\nseen in simulations. We find that, due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz collapse of the\nenvelope, the companion must become significantly more luminous (10 - 10^3\nLsun) for a long period of time (10^3 - 10^4 years). The lack of such a\nluminous \"leftover\" star in the LMC supernova remnant SNR 0609-67.5 provides\nanother piece of evidence against the SD scenario.

This field exceeds the dipolar field $B_d$,\nresponsible for the braking of the pulsar rotation, by at least one order of\nmagnitude. Neither magnetospheric currents nor small scale field components\ngenerated during neutron star's birth can provide such field structures in old\npulsars. While the former are too weak to create $B_s \\gtrsim 5\\times\n10^{13}$G$\\;\\gg B_d$, the ohmic decay time of the latter is much shorter than\n$10^6$ years. We suggest that a large amount of magnetic energy is stored in a\ntoroidal field component that is confined in deeper layers of the crust, where\nthe ohmic decay time exceeds $10^7$ years. This toroidal field may be created\nby various processes acting early in a neutron star's life.

These magnetic spots can be\nlong-lived, thereby fulfilling the pre-conditions for the appearance of the\nradio pulsar activity. Such magnetic structures created by the Hall drift are\nnot static, and dynamical variations on the Hall time scale are expected in the\npolar cap region. \n\n"}

The comparison between our calculations and\nthe observations of SN 2009dc suggests that the exploding WD has a super-Ch\nmass of 2.2-2.4 solar masses, producing 1.2-1.4 solar masses of Ni-56, if the\nextinction by its host galaxy is negligible. If the extinction is significant,\nthe exploding WD is as massive as \\sim2.8 solar masses, and \\sim1.8 solar\nmasses of Ni-56 is necessary to account for the observations.

The light curve exhibits an abrupt\ntransition from a well-defined ~120 day plateau to a steep bolometric decline.\nLeading up to peak brightness, a hot emission-line spectrum exhibits signs of\ninteraction with circumstellar material (CSM), in the form of relatively narrow\nP-Cygni features of H I and He I superimposed on broad Lorentzian wings. For\nthe remainder of the plateau phase the spectrum exhibits strengthening P-Cygni\nprofiles of Fe II, Ca II, and H-alpha.

However, the\ntotal bolometric decline, including the IR luminosity, is consistent with Co-56\ndecay, and implies a low Ni-56 mass of ~0.01 M(Sun).

The most striking discovery\nin these data is that unlike previous reports, the spectrum exhibited Balmer\nlines with very broad P-Cygni profiles characteristic of normal Type II\nsupernovae (SNe II), in addition to narrow emission lines seen in SNe IIn and\nLBVs. Emission components have FWHM 8000 km/s, while the P-Cygni absorption\ncomponent has blue wings extending to -13,000 km/s. These velocities are\ntypical of SNe II, but have never been associated with emission lines from a\nnonterminal LBV-like eruption. Initially, the peak absolute magnitude seemed\nfainter than that of normal SNe. However, after a brief period of fading, the\nsource quickly brightened again to M_R=-17.5 mag over a couple days.

Recent hydrodynamic simulations of\naccretion of solar material onto white dwarfs without mixing always produce a\nthermonuclear runaway and steady burning does not occur. For a broad range in\nWD mass (0.4 Solar masses to 1.35 Solar Masses), the maximum ejected material\noccurs for the 1.25 Solar Mass sequences and then decreases as the white dwarf\nmass decreases. Therefore, the white dwarfs are growing in mass as a\nconsequence of the accretion of solar material and as long as there is no\nmixing of accreted material with core material. In contrast, a thermonuclear\nrunaway in the accreted hydrogen-rich layers on the low luminosity WDs in close\nbinary systems where mixing of core matter with accreted material has occurred\nis the outburst mechanism for Classical, Recurrent, and Symbiotic novae. The\ndifferences in characteristics of these systems is likely the WD mass and mass\naccretion rate. The high levels of enrichment of CN ejecta in elements ranging\nfrom carbon to sulfur confirm that there is dredge-up of matter from the core\nof the WD and enable them to contribute to the chemical enrichment of the\ninterstellar medium. Therefore, studies of CNe can lead to an improved\nunderstanding of Galactic nucleosynthesis, some sources of pre-solar grains,\nand the Extragalactic distance scale. The characteristics of the outburst\ndepend on the white dwarf mass, luminosity, mass accretion rate, and the\nchemical composition of both the accreting material and WD material. The\nproperties of the outburst also depends on when, how, and if the accreted\nlayers are mixed with the WD core and the mixing mechanism is still unknown. \n\n"}

We present high\ntime-resolution spectrophotometry of the eclipsing nova-like variables SW Sex\nand DW UMa, two of the founding members of the SW Sex class.

The emission-line light curves are consistent with the finding from X-ray\nand ultraviolet observations that we predominantly see the flared disc rim and\nthe unobscured back portion of the disc in these systems. In DW UMa, the HeII\n4686A emission line originates from close to the white dwarf and exhibits\nflaring. Such flares have been used to argue for magnetically-channelled\naccretion, as in the intermediate polars, but the lack of a clear periodicity\nin the flares argues for a simpler model in which we are viewing the central\nregions of the disc through the non-uniform upper edge of a flared disc rim.

It\nhas been seen as improbable that we would find planets in such a small final\nfraction of their lives. The favored solution has been that the tidal\ndissipation is much weaker than expected, which would mean that the final\ninfall would be a larger fraction of the planets' life. We find no reason to\nexclude the explanation that a small number of planets are continuously sent\nmigrating inwards such that these planets indeed are in the last fraction of\ntheir lives. Following the observation that the distribution of medium planets\ndisfavors tidal dissipation being significantly weaker than has been found from\nobservations of binary stars, we now show that the numbers of planets in such a\n\"flow\" of excess planets migrating inwards is low enough that even depletion of\nthe three-day pileup is a plausible source.

The resonant parametric instability is a well-known\nform of three-wave interaction in which a primary wave of frequency $\\omega_a$\nexcites a pair of secondary waves of frequency $\\omega_b+\\omega_c \\simeq\n\\omega_a$. Here we consider a nonresonant form of three-wave interaction in\nwhich a low-frequency primary wave excites a high-frequency p-mode and a\nlow-frequency g-mode such that $\\omega_b+\\omega_c >>\\omega_a$. We show that a\np-mode can couple so strongly to a g-mode of similar radial wavelength that\nthis type of interaction is unstable even if the primary wave amplitude is\nsmall. As an application, we analyze the stability of the tide in coalescing\nneutron star binaries to p-g mode coupling. We find that the equilibrium tide\nand dynamical tide are both p-g unstable at gravitational wave frequencies\nf_{gw} > 20 Hz and drive p-g pairs to significant energies on very short\ntimescales (much less than the orbital decay time). Resonant parametric\ncoupling to the tide is, by contrast, either stable or drives modes at a much\nsmaller rate. We do not solve for the saturation of the instability and\ntherefore cannot say precisely how it influences neutron star binaries.\nHowever, we show that if even a single daughter mode saturates near its wave\nbreaking amplitude, the p-g instability of the equilibrium tide: (i) induces\nsignificant orbital phase errors ($\\Delta \\phi$ > 1 radian) that accumulate\nprimarily at low frequencies (f_{gw} < 50 Hz) and (ii) heats the neutron star\ncore to T~10^{10} K. Since there are >100 unstable daughters, $\\Delta \\phi$ and\nT are potentially much larger than these values. Tides might therefore\nsignificantly influence the gravitational wave signal and electromagnetic\nemission from neutron star binaries at much larger orbital separations than\npreviously thought. \n\n"}

As very\nlittle is known about the optical properties of heavy r-process elements,\nprevious light curve models have adopted opacities similar to those of iron\ngroup elements. Here we report that the presence of heavier elements,\nparticularly the lanthanides, increase the ejecta opacity by several orders of\nmagnitude. We include these higher opacities in time dependent,\nmulti-wavelength radiative transport calculations to predict the broadband\nlight curves of one-dimensional models over a range of parameters (ejecta\nmasses from 0.001 to 0.1 solar masses and velocities from 0.1 to 0.3c). We find\nthat the higher opacities lead to much longer duration light curves which can\nlast a week or more. The emission is shifted toward the infrared bands due to\nstrong optical line blanketing, and the colors at later times are\nrepresentative of a blackbody near the recombination temperature of the\nlanthanides (T ~ 2500K). We further consider the case in which a second mass\noutflow, composed of 56Ni, is ejected from a disk wind, and show that the net\nresult is a distinctive two component spectral energy distribution, with a\nbright optical peak due to 56Ni and an infrared peak due to r-process ejecta.\nWe briefly consider the prospects for detection and identification of these\ntransients. \n\n"}

Identifying such events\nis an important goal of future transient surveys, offering new perspectives on\nthe origin of r-process nuclei and the astrophysical sources of gravitational\nwaves. Predictions of the transient light curves and spectra, however, have\nsuffered from the uncertain optical properties of heavy ions. Here we consider\nthe opacity of expanding r-process material and argue that it is dominated by\nline transitions from those ions with the most complex valence electron\nstructure, namely the lanthanides. For a few representative ions, we run atomic\nstructure models to calculate radiative data for tens of millions of lines. We\nfind that the resulting r-process opacities are orders of magnitude larger than\nthat of ordinary (e.g., iron-rich) supernova ejecta.

A single set of contemporaneous images is explored in\ndetail, along with prefatory consideration for time evolution using only the\n171 A data.

The AIA data show four stages of oxygen\nionization (O III - O VI) along with C IV, while XRT likely captured emission\nfrom O VII, a line typical of the corona.

The scenario takes\ninto account the interaction between superfluid inertial modes and the normal\n(quadrupole) $m=2$ $r$-mode, which can be driven unstable by\nChandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) mechanism. This interaction can only occur\nat some fixed \"resonance\" stellar temperatures; it leads to formation of the\n\"stability peaks\" which stabilize a star in the vicinity of these temperatures.\nWe demonstrate that a NS in LMXB spends a substantial fraction of time on the\nstability peak, that is, in the region of stellar temperatures and spin\nfrequencies, that has been previously thought to be CFS unstable with respect\nto excitation of $r$-modes. We also find that the spin frequencies of NSs are\nlimited by the CFS instability of normal (octupole) $m=3$ $r$-mode rather than\nby $m=2$ $r$-mode.

Among\npossible EM emission from the NS merger, emission powered by radioactive\nr-process nuclei is one of the best targets for follow-up observations.\nHowever, prediction so far does not take into account detailed r-process\nelement abundances in the ejecta. We perform radiative transfer simulations for\nthe NS merger ejecta including all the r-process elements from Ga to U for the\nfirst time. We show that the opacity in the NS merger ejecta is about kappa =\n10 cm^2 g^{-1}, which is higher than that of Fe-rich Type Ia supernova ejecta\nby a factor of ~ 100. As a result, the emission is fainter and longer than\npreviously expected. The spectra are almost featureless due to the high\nexpansion velocity and bound-bound transitions of many different r-process\nelements. We demonstrate that the emission is brighter for a higher mass ratio\nof two NSs and a softer equation of states adopted in the merger simulations.\nBecause of the red color of the emission, follow-up observations in red optical\nand near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths will be the most efficient. At 200 Mpc,\nexpected brightness of the emission is i = 22 - 25 AB mag, z = 21 - 23 AB mag,\nand 21 - 24 AB mag in NIR JHK bands.

The temperature and density in the\ncentre eventually reach high enough values where fusion reactions can ignite;\nthe protostar is born. This sequence of events entail many physical processes,\nof which radiative transfer is of paramount importance. Many simulations of\nprotostellar collapse make use of a grey treatment of radiative transfer\ncoupled to the hydrodynamics. However, interstellar gas and dust opacities\npresent large variations as a function of frequency. In this paper, we\nfollow-up on a previous paper on the collapse and formation of Larson's first\ncore using multigroup radiation hydrodynamics (Paper I) by extending the\ncalculations to the second phase of the collapse and the formation of Larson's\nsecond core. We have made the use of a non-ideal gas equation of state as well\nas an extensive set of spectral opacities in a spherically symmetric fully\nimplicit Godunov code to model all the phases of the collapse of a 0.1, 1 and\n10 solar mass cloud cores.

If the absence of pulsations is interpreted as evidence for the\nemitting surface area being the entire neutron star surface, the assumption of\nthe measured flux being due to a blackbody emission translates into a source\ndistance that is inconsistent with current estimates of the remnant's distance.\nAims: With the best available observational data, we extended the pulse period\nsearch down to a sub-millisecond time scale and used a carbon atmosphere model\nto describe the X-ray spectrum of the CCO and to estimate geometrical\nparameters of the neutron star. Methods: To search for pulsations we used data\nof an observation of the source with XMM-Newton performed in timing mode. For\nthe spectral analysis, we used earlier XMM-Newton observations performed in\nimaging mode, which permits a more accurate treatment of the background. The\ncarbon atmosphere models used to fit the CCO spectrum are computed assuming\nhydrostatic and radiative equilibria and take into account pressure ionization\nand the presence of spectral lines. Results: Our timing analysis did not reveal\nany pulsations with a pulsed fraction above ~8% down to 0.2 ms.

Very interestingly, the recently published Geneva models\nof single stars can reproduce the observed photometry of the progenitor\ncandidate and its mass-loss rate, confirming a recently proposed scenario. We\nfind that a single WR star with initial mass in the range 31-35 Msun fits the\nobserved photometry of the progenitor of iPTF13bvn. The progenitor likely has a\nluminosity of log (L/Lsun)~5.55, surface temperature ~45000 K, and mass of\n~10.9 Msun at the time of explosion. Our non-rotating 32 Msun model\noverestimates the derived radius of the progenitor, although this could likely\nbe reconciled with a fine-tuned model of a more massive (between 40 and 50\nMsun), hotter, and luminous progenitor.

Somewhat\nsurprisingly, the misaligned magnetic field is more efficient at tightening the\nbinary orbit compared to the aligned field. The main reason is that the\nmisalignment weakens the magnetically-driven outflow, which allows more\nmaterial to accrete onto the binary. Even though the specific angular momentum\nof this inner material is higher than in the aligned case, it is insufficient\nto compensate for the additional mass. A corollary of this result is that a\nweaker field is required to achieve the same degree of inward migration when\nthe field is tilted relative to the rotation axis. Large field misalignment\nalso helps to produce rotationally-supported circumbinary disks even for\nrelatively strong magnetic fields, by weakening the magnetically-dominated\nstructure close to the binary. Our result may provide an explanation for the\ncircumbinary disks detected in recent SMA and ALMA observations. \n\n"}

Models currently predict as\nmuch as 150 times the solar abundance of 33S in oxygen-neon nova ejecta.

Additionally, the total S elemental abundance\nwhich is affected by this reaction has been proposed as a thermometer to study\nthe peak temperatures of novae. Previously, the 33S(p,\\gamma)34Cl reaction rate\nhad only been studied directly down to resonance energies of 432 keV.

In this new version we extend the\nmodel to include an unbalanced phase of evolution to describe the pre-collapse\nevolution and the accompanying escape rate such that clusters in strong tidal\nfields can also be modelled. We also add a prescription for the evolution of\nthe core radius and density and a related cluster concentration parameter. The\nmodel simultaneously solves a series of first-order ordinary differential\nequations for the rate of change of the core radius, half-mass radius and the\nnumber of member stars N.

We estimate that the fraction of such\nultra-stripped to all SNe could be as high as 0.001-0.01. Finally, we argue\nthat the second explosion in some double neutron star systems (for example, the\ndouble pulsar PSR J0737-3039B) was likely associated with an ultra-stripped SN\nIc. \n\n"}

The goal is to shed light on\nthe possible observational features expected by core He-burning stars that\nbelong to two stellar populations with different original He content and ages.\n  Methods: The tool adopted was the stellar population synthesis.

The\nclustering of low-mass stars around the massive W-R binary gamma^2 Velorum was\none of the first GES targets. Aims: To empirically determine the radial\nvelocity (RV) precision of GES data, construct a kinematically unbiased sample\nof cluster members and characterise their dynamical state. Methods: Targets\nwere selected from colour-magnitude diagrams and intermediate resolution\nspectroscopy used to derive RVs and assess membership from the strength of the\nLi6708A line. The RV distribution was analysed using a maximum likelihood\ntechnique that accounts for unresolved binaries. Results: The GES RV precision\nis about 0.25km/s and sufficient to resolve velocity structure in the low-mass\npopulation around gamma^2 Vel. The structure is well fitted by two kinematic\ncomponents with roughly equal numbers of stars; the first has an intrinsic\ndispersion of 0.34+/-0.16km/s, consistent with virial equilibrium. The second\nhas a broader dispersion of 1.60+/-0.37km/s and is offset from the first by\n~2km/s. The first population is older by 1-2Myr based on a greater level of Li\ndepletion seen among its M-stars and is probably more centrally concentrated\naround gamma^2 Vel. Conclusions: We consider several formation scenarios,\nconcluding that the two kinematic components are a bound remnant of the\noriginal, denser cluster that formed gamma^2 Vel, and a dispersed population\nfrom the wider Vela OB2 association, of which gamma^2 Vel is the most massive\nmember. The apparent youth of gamma^2 Vel compared to the older (>=10Myr)\nlow-mass population surrounding it suggests a scenario where the massive binary\nformed in a clustered environment after the formation of the bulk of the\nlow-mass stars.[abridged] \n\n"}

The only available\nanalytical MHD solutions to describe disc-driven jets are those characterized\nby the symmetry of radial self-similarity. However, radially self-similar MHD\njet models, in general, have three geometrical shortcomings, (i) a singularity\nat the jet axis, (ii) the necessary assumption of axisymmetry, and (iii) the\nnon-existence of an intrinsic radial scale, i.e. the jets formally extend to\nradial infinity. Hence, numerical simulations are necessary to extend the\nanalytical solutions towards the axis, by solving the full three-dimensional\nequations of MHD and impose a termination radius at finite radial distance. We\nfocus here on studying the effects of relaxing the (ii) assumption of\naxisymmetry, i.e. of performing full 3D numerical simulations of a disc-wind\ncrossing all magnetohydrodynamic critical surfaces. We compare the results of\nthese runs with previous axisymmetric 2.5D simulations. The structure of the\nflow in all simulations shows strong similarities. The 3D runs reach a steady\nstate and stay close to axisymmetry for most of the physical quantities, except\nfor the poloidal magnetic field and the toroidal velocity which slightly\ndeviate from axisymmetry. The latter quantities show signs of instabilities,\nwhich, however, are confined to the region inside the fast magnetosonic\nseparatrix surface. The forces present in the flow, both of collimating and\naccelerating nature, are in good agreement in both the 2.5D and the 3D runs.

The normal\noutbursts within a supercycle showed a general trend that the rising rate to\nmaximum becomes slower as the next superoutburst approaches.

The most\ninteresting one is the so-called rho-state, whose light curve shows recurrent\nbursts. This paper presents a model based on Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations\ncontaining two variables: x, linked to the source photon luminosity L detected\nby the MECS, and y related to the mean photon energy. We aim at providing a\nsimple mathematical framework composed by non-linear differential equations\nuseful to predict the observed light curve and the energy lags for the\nrho-state and possibly other classes of the source. We studied the equilibrium\nstate and the stability conditions of this system that includes one external\nparameter, J, that can be considered a function of the disk accretion rate. Our\nwork is based on observations performed with the MECS on board BeppoSAX when\nthe source was in rho and nu mode, respectively. The evolution of the mean\ncount rate and photon energy were derived from a study of the trajectories in\nthe count rate - photon energy plane. Assuming J constant, we found a solution\nthat reproduces the x profile of the rho class bursts and, unexpectedly, we\nfound that y exhibited a time modulation similar to that of the mean energy.\nMoreover, assuming a slowly modulated J the solutions for x quite similar to\nthose observed in the nu class light curves is reproduced. According these\nresults, the outer mass accretion rate is probably responsible for the state\ntransitions, but within the rho-class it is constant. This finding makes\nstronger the heuristic meaning of the non-linear model and suggests a simple\nrelation between the variable x and y. However, how a system of dynamical\nequations can be derived from the complex mathematical apparatus of accretion\ndisks remains to be furtherly explored. \n\n"}

We use the adaptive mesh refinement code Enzo to simulate the\ncollapse of gas at high redshift, including a nine species chemical model of H,\nHe, and H$_2$. The direct collapse model requires that the gas cools\npredominantly via atomic hydrogen. To this end we simulate the effect of an\nanisotropic radiation source on the collapse of a halo at high redshift. The\nradiation source is placed at a distance of 3 kpc (physical) from the\ncollapsing object. The source is set to emit monochromatically in the center of\nthe Lyman-Werner (LW) band only at $12.8 \\ \\rm{eV}$. The LW radiation emitted\nfrom the high redshift source is followed self-consistently using ray tracing\ntechniques. We find that, due to self-shielding, a small amount of H$_2$ is\nable to form at the very center of the collapsing halo even under very strong\nLW radiation. Furthermore, we find that a radiation source, emitting $>\n10^{54}\\ (\\sim10^3\\ \\rm{J_{21}})$ photons per second is required to cause the\ncollapse of a clump of $\\rm{M \\sim 10^5}$ M$_{\\odot}$.

We find that the fastest\ngrowing linear MRI structures on both local and global domains can look very\ndifferent to the eigenmodes, invariably resembling waves shearing with the\nbackground flow (shear waves). In addition, such structures can grow many times\nfaster than the least stable eigenmode over long time periods, and be localized\nin a completely different region of space. These ideas lead -- for both\naxisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes -- to a natural connection between the\nglobal MRI and the local shearing box approximation. By illustrating that the\nfastest growing global structure is well described by the ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs) governing a single shear wave, we find that the shearing box\nis a very sensible approximation for the linear MRI, contrary to many previous\nclaims.

Some mechanisms can significantly\nshorten this lifetime, allowing a few stars to start spinning up much earlier\nthan other stars.

Since all parameters\nthat are responsible for the rotational evolution, with the exception of\nenvironment properties and initial stellar rotation, are similar for all\ncomponents, we expect that significant differences among the rotation periods\ncan only arise from differences in the disc lifetimes. A photometric timeseries\nallowed us to measure the rotation periods of each component, while\nhigh-resolution spectra provided us with the fundamental parameters, $v\\sin{i}$\nand chromospheric line fluxes. The rotation periods of the components differ\nsignificantly, and the component B, which has a closer companion C, rotates\nfaster than the more distant and isolated component A.

A large sample of red giant stars was observed with FORS2@VLT/ESO at\nR ~ 2,000. The method for derivation of stellar parameters is presented with\napplication to six reference clusters. We aim at deriving the stellar\nparameters effective temperature, gravity, metallicity and alpha-element\nenhancement, as well as radial velocity, for membership confirmation of\nindividual stars in each cluster. We analyse the spectra collected for the\nreference globular clusters NGC 6528, NGC 6553, M 71, NGC 6558, NGC 6426 and\nTerzan 8. They cover the full range of globular cluster metallicities, and are\nlocated in the bulge, disc and halo. Full spectrum fitting techniques are\napplied, by comparing each target spectrum with a stellar library in the\noptical region at 4560-5860 A. We employed the library of observed spectra\nMILES, and the synthetic library by Coelho et al. (2005). Validation of the\nmethod is achieved through recovery of the known atmospheric parameters for 49\nwell-studied stars that cover a wide range in the parameter space. We adopted\nas final stellar parameters (effective temperatures, gravities, metallicities)\nthe average of results using MILES and Coelho et al. libraries. We identified 4\nmember stars in NGC 6528, 13 in NGC 6553, 10 in M 71, 5 in NGC 6558, 5 in NGC\n6426 and 12 in Terzan 8.

The rate at\nwhich MRI-driven turbulence transports angular momentum is related to both the\nstrength of the amplitudes of the fluctuations on various scales and the degree\nof anisotropy of the underlying turbulence. This has motivated several studies\nof the distribution of turbulent power in spectral space. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the anisotropic nature of MRI-driven turbulence using a\npseudo-spectral code and introduce novel ways to robustly characterize the\nunderlying turbulence. We show that the general flow properties vary in a\nquasi-periodic way on timescales comparable to 10 inverse angular frequencies\nmotivating the temporal analysis of its anisotropy. We introduce a 3D tensor\ninvariant analysis to quantify and classify the evolution of the anisotropic\nturbulent flow. This analysis shows a continuous high level of anisotropy, with\nbrief sporadic transitions towards two- and three-component isotropic turbulent\nflow. This temporal-dependent anisotropy renders standard shell-average,\nespecially when used simultaneously with long temporal averages, inadequate for\ncharacterizing MRI-driven turbulence. We propose an alternative way to extract\nspectral information from the turbulent magnetized flow, whose anisotropic\ncharacter depends strongly on time. This consists of stacking 1D Fourier\nspectra along three orthogonal directions that exhibit maximum anisotropy in\nFourier space. The resulting averaged spectra show that the power along each of\nthe three independent directions differs by several orders of magnitude over\nmost scales, except the largest ones. Our results suggest that a\nfirst-principles theory to describe fully developed MRI-driven turbulence will\nlikely have to consider the anisotropic nature of the flow at a fundamental\nlevel. \n\n"}

Tidal downsizing may reduce both the\nobject mass and semimajor axis. However, most studies of tidal downsizing end\nwhen the protostellar disc disperses, while the system is embedded in its\nparent star-forming region. To compare disc fragment descendants with exoplanet\nand brown dwarf observations, the subsequent dynamical evolution must be\nexplored.\n  We carry out N-Body integrations of fragment-fragment scattering in\nmulti-object star systems, and star systems embedded in substructured clusters.\nIn both cases, we use initial conditions generated by population synthesis\nmodels of tidal downsizing.\n  The scattering simulations produce a wide range of eccentricities.

The measured image in a real optical instrument is usually\nrepresented by the convolution of an ideal image with a Point Spread Function\n(PSF). Additionally, the image acquisition process is also contaminated by\nother sources of noise (read-out, photon-counting). The problem of estimating\nboth the PSF and a denoised image is called blind deconvolution and is\nill-posed.\n  Aims: We propose a blind deconvolution scheme that relies on image\nregularization. Contrarily to most methods presented in the literature, our\nmethod does not assume a parametric model of the PSF and can thus be applied to\nany telescope.\n  Methods: Our scheme uses a wavelet analysis prior model on the image and weak\nassumptions on the PSF. We use observations from a celestial transit, where the\nocculting body can be assumed to be a black disk. These constraints allow us to\nretain meaningful solutions for the filter and the image, eliminating trivial,\ntranslated and interchanged solutions. Under an additive Gaussian noise\nassumption, they also enforce noise canceling and avoid reconstruction\nartifacts by promoting the whiteness of the residual between the blurred\nobservations and the cleaned data.\n  Results: Our method is applied to synthetic and experimental data. The PSF is\nestimated for the SECCHI/EUVI instrument using the 2007 Lunar transit, and for\nSDO/AIA using the 2012 Venus transit. Results show that the proposed\nnon-parametric blind deconvolution method is able to estimate the core of the\nPSF with a similar quality to parametric methods proposed in the literature.

The first core\ndevelops prior to the protostar formation in higher-metallicity clouds, whereas\nno (obvious) first core appears in lower-metallicity clouds. The first core\nevolves into a circumstellar disc with a spiral pattern, which effectively\ntransfers the angular momentum outwards and suppresses frequent fragmentation.\nIn lower-metallicity clouds, the higher mass accretion rate increases the disc\nsurface density within a very short time, rendering the disc unstable to\nself-gravity and inducing vigorous fragmentation. \n\n"}

It is caused by a spiral deformation, the pattern of which rotates\nslower with respect to the double-core structure in center of the remnant. This\nsecondary peak is typically well separated in frequency from the secondary peak\nproduced by a nonlinear interaction between a quadrupole and a quasi-radial\noscillation. The new mechanism allows for an explanation of low-frequency\nmodulations seen in a number of physical characteristics of the remnant, such\nas the central lapse function, the maximum density and the separation between\nthe two cores. We find empirical relations for both types of secondary peaks\nbetween their gravitational-wave frequency and the compactness of nonrotating\nindividual neutron stars, that exist for fixed total binary masses. These\nfindings are derived for equal-mass binaries without intrinsic neutron-star\nspin analyzing hydrodynamical simulations without magnetic field effects.

In\nparticular, we focus on systems that are well into the regimes where the\nStanding Accretion Shock Instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven convection\ndominate the dynamics, and characterize the difference between them.

In Tauris et al. (2013), it was demonstrated that\nhelium star companions to neutron stars (NSs) may experience mass transfer and\nevolve into naked ~1.5 M_sun metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass\nlimit. Here we present a systematic investigation of the progenitor evolution\nleading to ultra-stripped supernovae (SNe). In particular, we examine the\nbinary parameter space leading to electron-capture (EC SNe) and iron\ncore-collapse SNe (Fe CCSNe), respectively, and determine the amount of helium\nejected with applications to their observational classification as Type Ib or\nType Ic. We mainly evolve systems where the SN progenitors are helium star\ndonors of initial mass M_He = 2.5 - 3.5 M_sun in tight binaries with orbital\nperiods of P_orb = 0.06 - 2.0 days, and hosting an accreting NS, but we also\ndiscuss the evolution of wider systems and of both more massive and lighter -\nas well as single - helium stars. In some cases we are able to follow the\nevolution until the onset of silicon burning, just a few days prior to the SN\nexplosion. We find that ultra-stripped SNe are possible for both EC SNe and Fe\nCCSNe, and that the amount of helium ejected is correlated with P_orb - the\ntightest systems even having donors being stripped down to envelopes of less\nthan 0.01 M_sun. We estimate the rise time of ultra-stripped SNe to be in the\nrange 12 hr - 8 days, and light curve decay times between 1 and 50 days.\nUltra-stripped SNe may produce NSs in the mass range 1.10 - 1.80 M_sun and are\nhighly relevant for LIGO/VIRGO since most (possibly all) merging double NS\nsystems have evolved through this phase.

We demonstrate that\nthe underproduction of elements above and below the $r$-process peaks\ncharacteristic in the main or weak $r$-process events (like magnetohydrodynamic\njets or neutrino-driven winds in core-collapse supernovae) can be supplemented\nvia fission fragment distributions from the recycling of material in a\nneutron-rich environment such as that encountered in neutron star mergers.

We aim to find\nbinary-evolution mechanisms that can explain these eccentric long-period\norbits, and reproduce the currently observed period-eccentricity diagram. Three\ndifferent processes are considered; tidally-enhanced wind mass-loss,\nphase-dependent RLOF on eccentric orbits and the interaction between a\ncircumbinary disk and the binary. The binary module of the stellar-evolution\ncode MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) is extended to\ninclude the eccentricity-pumping processes. The effects of different input\nparameters on the final period and eccentricity of a binary-evolution model are\ntested with MESA. The end products of models with only tidally-enhanced wind\nmass-loss can indeed be eccentric, but these models need to lose too much mass,\nand invariably end up with a helium white dwarf that is too light to ignite\nhelium. Within the tested parameter space, no sdBs in eccentric systems are\nformed. Phase-dependent RLOF can reintroduce eccentricity during RLOF, and\ncould help to populate the short-period part of the period-eccentricity\ndiagram. When phase-dependent RLOF is combined with eccentricity pumping via a\ncircumbinary disk, the higher eccentricities can be reached as well. A\nremaining problem is that these models favour a distribution of higher\neccentricities at lower periods, while the observed systems show the opposite.\nThe models presented here are potentially capable of explaining the\nperiod-eccentricity distribution of long-period sdB binaries, but further\ntheoretical work on the physical mechanisms is necessary. \n\n"}

As a reference, we\nalso run simulations with local solar neighbourhood values of the ISRF and the\nCRF in order to better constrain the effects of the extreme conditions in the\nGC on the SFE.

This is due to the fact that, in\nself-accelerating models, the background gravitational coupling weakens at\nintermediate redshifts, over-compensating the effect of the attractive scalar\nforce. (2) At higher redshifts, the opposite happens; we identify a period of\nsuper-growth when the linear growth rate is larger than that predicted by\n$\\Lambda$CDM. (3) The gravitational slip parameter $\\eta$ - the ratio of the\nspace part of the metric perturbation to the time part - is bounded from above.\nFor Brans-Dicke-type theories $\\eta$ is at most unity.

Here we show that the stagnation surface, the separatrix between\nmaterial that falls back into the black hole and material that is accelerated\noutward forming the jet, is a natural site of pair formation and particle\nacceleration. This occurs via an inverse-Compton pair catastrophe driven by\nunscreened electric fields within the charge-starved region about the\nstagnation surface and substantially amplified by a post-gap cascade. For\ntypical estimates of the jet properties in M87, we find excellent quantitive\nagreement between the predicted relativistic lepton densities and those\nrequired by recent high-frequency radio observations of M87.

CP stars exhibiting this phenomenon are normally\nclassified as alpha2 Canum Venaticorum (ACV) variables. It is important to\nincrease the sample of known rotational periods among CP stars by discovering\nnew ACV variables. The ASAS-3 data were cross-correlated with the Catalogue of\nAp, HgMn, and Am stars in order to analyse the light curves of bona fide CP and\nrelated stars. The light curves were downloaded and cleaned of outliers and\ndata points with a flag indicating bad quality. Promising candidates showing a\nlarger scatter than observed for constant stars in the corresponding magnitude\nrange were searched for periodic signals using a standard Fourier technique. In\ntotal, we found 323 variables, from which 246 are reported here for the first\ntime, and 77 were probably wrongly classified before. The observed variability\npattern of most stars is in accordance with an ACV classification.

There seems to be a\npossible weak correlation between the rotational period and colour, in the\nsense that cooler magnetic CP stars rotate more slowly.

In this work, we study axisymmetric mean flows in rapidly\nand initially uniformly rotating massive stars driven by small amplitude\nnon-axisymmetric $\\kappa$-driven oscillations. We treat them as perturbations\nof second-order of the oscillation amplitudes and derive their governing\nequations as a set of coupled linear ordinary differential equations. This\nallows us to compute 2-D zonal and meridional mean flows driven by low\nfrequency $g$- and $r$-modes in slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars and $p$-modes in\n$\\beta$ Cephei stars. Oscillation-driven mean flows usually have large\namplitudes only in the surface layers. In addition, the kinetic energy of the\ninduced 2-D zonal rotational motions is much larger than that of the meridional\nmotions. In some cases, meridional flows have a complex radial and latitudinal\nstructure. For SPB stars, we find that there are low frequency retrograde\n$g$-modes and $r$-modes that drive mean flows with positive velocity components\nin the radial and azimuthal directions at the stellar surface. This suggests\nthat low frequency retrograde modes can transport angular momentum to the\nsurface layers, which may help to form a circumstellar gaseous disc.

Previous studies have suggested that planet-induced spiral arms cannot\nexplain some of these spiral patterns, due to the large pitch angle and high\ncontrast of the spiral arms in observations. We have carried out three\ndimensional (3-D) hydrodynamical simulations to study spiral wakes/shocks\nexcited by young planets. We find that, in contrast with linear theory, the\npitch angle of spiral arms does depend on the planet mass, which can be\nexplained by the non-linear density wave theory. A secondary (or even a\ntertiary) spiral arm, especially for inner arms, is also excited by a massive\nplanet. With a more massive planet in the disk, the excited spiral arms have\nlarger pitch angle and the separation between the primary and secondary arms in\nthe azimuthal direction is also larger. We also find that although the arms in\nthe outer disk do not exhibit much vertical motion, the inner arms have\nsignificant vertical motion, which boosts the density perturbation at the disk\natmosphere. Combining hydrodynamical models with Monte-Carlo radiative transfer\ncalculations, we find that the inner spiral arms are considerably more\nprominent in synthetic near-IR images using full 3-D hydrodynamical models than\nimages based on 2-D models assuming vertical hydrostatic equilibrium,\nindicating the need to model observations with full 3-D hydrodynamics.

This\ncharacteristic region coincides with that inferred for both optically thick and\nthin thermal infrared dust emission, as well as rovibrational CO emission. The\npresence of water in the dust-depleted region implies substantial columns of\nhydrogen (>10^{22} cm-2) as the water vapor would otherwise be destroyed by\nphotodissociation. Combined with the dust modeling, this column implies a\ngas/small-dust ratio in the optically thin dusty region of >1000. These results\ndemonstrate that DoAr 44 has maintained similar physical and chemical\nconditions to classical protoplanetary disks in its terrestrial-planet forming\nregions, in spite of having formed a large gap. \n\n"}

Robust detections of Zeeman\nsignatures at all observed epochs indicate a surface magnetic field, with\nlongitudinal magnetic field strengths varying between 1.0-3.2 G. Radial\nvelocity variations from night to night modulate on a similar timescale to the\nlongitudinal magnetic field measurements.

The full evolution is\nfollowed using an adaptive reaction network of up to 2000 nuclei. A novel\naspect of the survey is the use of a one-dimensional neutrino transport model\nfor the explosion. This explosion model has been calibrated to give the\nobserved energy for SN 1987A, using several standard progenitors, and for the\nCrab supernova using a 9.6 solar mass progenitor. As a result of using a\ncalibrated central engine, the final kinetic energy of the supernova is\nvariable and sensitive to the structure of the presupernova star.

Simple theories of isothermal fragmentation successfully\nreproduce the core mass function (CMF) which has a very similar shape to the\ninitial mass function (IMF) of stars. However, numerical simulations of\nisothermal turbulent fragmentation thus far have not succeeded in identifying a\nfragment mass scale that is independent of the simulation resolution. Moreover,\nthe fluid equations for magnetized, self-gravitating, isothermal turbulence are\nscale-free, and do not predict any characteristic mass. In this paper we show\nthat, although an isothermal self-gravitating flow does produce a CMF with a\nmass scale imposed by the initial conditions, this scale changes as the parent\ncloud evolves. In addition, the cores that form undergo further fragmentation\nand after sufficient time forget about their initial conditions, yielding a\nscale-free pure power-law distribution $\\mathrm{d} N/\\mathrm{d} M\\propto\nM^{-2}$ for the stellar IMF. We show that this problem can be alleviated by\nintroducing additional physics that provides a termination scale for the\ncascade. Our candidate for such physics is a simple model for stellar radiation\nfeedback. Radiative heating, powered by accretion onto forming stars, arrests\nthe fragmentation cascade and imposes a characteristic mass scale that is\nnearly independent of the time-evolution or initial conditions in the\nstar-forming cloud, and that agrees well with the peak of the observed IMF.

Abstract: A magnetic flux rope structure is believed to exist in most coronal mass\nejections (CMEs).

All models develop explosions, but depending on the progenitor\nstructure, they can be divided into two classes. With a steep density decline\nat the Si/Si-O interface, the arrival of this interface at the shock front\nleads to a sudden drop of the mass-accretion rate, triggering a rapid approach\nto explosion. With a more gradually decreasing accretion rate, it takes longer\nfor the neutrino heating to overcome the accretion ram pressure and explosions\nset in later. Early explosions are facilitated by high mass-accretion rates\nafter bounce and correspondingly high neutrino luminosities combined with a\npronounced drop of the accretion rate and ram pressure at the Si/Si-O\ninterface. Because of rapidly shrinking neutron star radii and receding shock\nfronts after the passage through their maxima, our models exhibit short\nadvection time scales, which favor the efficient growth of the standing\naccretion-shock instability.

The\n  mass-radius relation Abstract: Stars form predominantly in groups usually denoted as clusters or\nassociations. The observed stellar groups display a broad spectrum of masses,\nsizes and other properties, so it is often assumed that there is no underlying\nstructure in this diversity. Here we show that the assumption of an\nunstructured multitude of cluster or association types might be misleading.\nCurrent data compilations of clusters show correlations between cluster mass,\nsize, age, maximum stellar mass etc. In this first paper we take a closer look\nat the correlation of cluster mass and radius. We use literature data to\nexplore relations in cluster and molecular core properties in the solar\nneighborhood. We show that for embedded clusters in the solar neighborhood\nthere exists a clear correlation between cluster mass and half-mass radius of\nthe form $M_c = C R_c^{\\gamma}$ with gamma = 1.7 +/-0.2. This correlation holds\nfor infra red K band data as well as X-ray sources and for clusters containing\na hundred stars up to those consisting of a few tens of thousands of stars. The\ncorrelation is difficult to verify for clusters containing <30 stars due to\nlow-number statistics. Dense clumps of gas are the progenitors of the embedded\nclusters. We find a similar slope for the mass-size relation of dense, massive\nclumps as for the embedded star clusters. This might point at a direct\ntranslation from gas to stellar mass: however, it is difficult to relate size\nmeasurements for clusters (stars) to those for gas profiles. Taking into\naccount multiple paths for clump mass into cluster mass, we obtain an average\nstar-formation efficiency of 18%{+9.3}{-5.7} for the embedded clusters in the\nsolar neighborhood.

As part\nof our project to study the integral-shaped filament, we analyze the\nfragmentation properties of the northern OMC 1 filament. This filament is a\ndense structure previously identified by JCMT/SCUBA submillimeter continuum and\nVLA ammonia observations and shown to have fragmented into clumps. We observed\nOMC1 n with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 1.3mm and report on our analysis\nof the continuum data.

The masses of these sources are similar to those of the SMA\nprotostars in OMC3, but their typical sizes and densities are lower by a factor\nof ten. Only 8% of the new sources have infrared counterparts, yet there are\nfive associated CO molecular outflows. These sources are thus likely in the\nClass 0 evolutionary phase yet it cannot be excluded that some of the sources\nmight still be pre-stellar cores.

The gas surface density near the integral-shaped filament (ISF) is\nwell represented by a power law, Sigma(b)=72 Msun/pc^2(b/pc)^{-5/8} for our\nentire range, 0.05<b/pc<8.5, of distance from the filament ridge. Essentially\nall protostars lie on the ISF or other filament ridges, while almost all\npre-main-sequence stars do not. Combined with the fact that protostars move <1\nkms relative to the filaments while stars move several times faster, this\nimplies that protostellar accretion is terminated by a slingshot ejection from\nthe filaments. The ISF is the 3rd in a series of star bursts that are\nprogressively moving south, with separations of a few Myr in time and 3 pc in\nspace. This, combined with the filament's observed undulations (spatial and\nvelocity), suggests that repeated propagation of transverse waves thru the\nfilament is progressively digesting the material that formerly connected Orion\nA and B into stars in discrete episodes. We construct an axially symmetric gas\ndensity profile rho(r)=16 Msun/pc^3(r/pc)^{-13/8}. The model implies that the\nobserved magnetic fields are supercritical on scales of the observed\nundulations, suggesting that the filament's transverse waves are magnetically\ninduced. Because the magnetic fields are subcritical on scales of the filament\non larger scales, the system as a whole is relatively stable and long lived.\nProtostellar ejection occurs because the gas accelerates away from the\nprotostars, not the other way around. The model also implies that the ISF is\nkinematically young, which is consistent with other lines of evidence. The\nsouthern filament has a broken power law, which matches the ISF profile for\n2.5<b/pc<8.5, but is shallower closer in. It is also kinematically older than\nthe ISF. \n\n"}

We present here a study of the elemental abundance differences\nbetween WASP-94AB, a pair of stars that each host a hot Jupiter exoplanet. The\ntwo stars are very similar in spectral type (F8 and F9), and their ~2700 AU\nseparation suggests their protoplanetary disks were likely not influenced by\nstellar interactions, but WASP-94Ab's orbit -- misaligned with the host star\nspin axis and likely retrograde -- points towards a dynamically active\nformation mechanism, perhaps different than that of WASP-94Bb, which is not\nmisaligned and has nearly circular orbit. Based on our high-quality spectra and\nstrictly relative abundance analysis, we detect a depletion of volatiles\n(~-0.02 dex, on average) and enhancement of refractories (~0.01 dex) in\nWASP-94A relative to B (standard errors are ~0.005 dex).

Given that the related\ntransits are detectable with current and upcoming space-based transit surveys,\nwe suggest initiating an observational program to search for carbon planets\naround CEMP stars in hopes of shedding light on the question of how early\nplanetary systems may have formed after the Big Bang. \n\n"}

Lifetimes of\n  equal-mass small-N systems Abstract: What is the difference between a long-lived unstable (or quasi-stable)\nmultiple star system and a bona fide star cluster? In this paper, we present a\npossible framework to address this question, by studying the distributions of\ndisruption times for chaotic gravitational encounters as a function of the\nnumber of interacting particles. To this end, we perform a series of numerical\nscattering experiments with the \\texttt{FEWBODY} code, to calculate the\ndistributions of disruption times as a function of both the particle number N\nand the virial coefficient k. The subsequent distributions are fit with a\nphysically-motivated function, consisting of an initial exponential decay\nfollowed by a very slowly decreasing tail at long encounter times due to\nlong-lived quasi-stable encounters. We find three primary features\ncharacteristic of the calculated distributions of disruption times. These are:\n(1) the system half-life increases with increasing particle number, (2) the\nfraction of long-lived quasi-stable encounters increases with increasing\nparticle number and (3) both the system half-life and the fraction of\nquasi-stable encounters increase with decreasing virial coefficient. We discuss\nthe significance of our results for collisional dynamics, and consider the\nextrapolation of our results to larger-N systems. We suggest that this could\npotentially offer a clear and unambiguous distinction between star clusters and\n(unstable or quasi-stable) multiple star systems. Although we are limited by\nvery small-number statistics, our results tentatively suggest that (for our\nassumptions) this transition occurs at a critical particle number of order 100. \n\n"}

Here we present resolved\nALMA observations of 13CO 3-2, C18O 3-2, 13CO 6-5, and C18O 6-5 emission in TW\nHya, which allow us to derive radial gas temperature and gas surface density\nprofiles, as well as map the CO abundance as a function of radius. These\nobservations provide a measurement of the surface CO snowline at ~30 AU and\nshow evidence for an outer ring of CO emission centered at 53 AU, a feature\npreviously seen only in less abundant species. Further, the derived CO gas\ntemperature profile constrains the freeze-out temperature of CO in the warm\nmolecular layer to < 21 K. Combined with the previous detection of HD 1-0,\nthese data constrain the surface density of the warm H2 gas in the inner ~30\nAU.

Cooler (K, M) stars\ntypically yield ages that are systematically younger than warmer (A, F, G)\nstars by a factor of two. I explore the possibility that these age\ndiscrepancies are the result of magnetic inhibition of convection in cool young\nstars by using magnetic stellar evolution isochrones to determine the age of\nthe Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association. A median\nage of 10 Myr consistent across spectral types A through M is found, except for\na subset of F-type stars that appear significantly older. Agreement is shown\nfor ages derived from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and from the empirical\nmass-radius relationship defined by eclipsing multiple-star systems. Surface\nmagnetic field strengths required to produce agreement are of order 2.5 kG and\nare predicted from a priori estimates of equipartition values. A region in the\nHR diagram is identified that plausibly connects stars whose structures are\nweakly influenced by the presence of magnetic fields with those whose\nstructures are strongly influenced by magnetic fields. The models suggest this\nregion is characterized by stars with rapidly thinning outer convective\nenvelopes where the radiative core mass is greater than 75% of the total\nstellar mass. Furthermore, depletion of lithium predicted from magnetic models\nappears in better agreement with observed lithium equivalent widths than\npredictions from non-magnetic models.

Since these primordial\nperturbations lead to the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and\neventually to the inhomogeneities in the Large Scale Structure (LSS), they\nprovide a unique opportunity to probe issues which are fundamental to our\nunderstanding of quantum physics and gravitation. One such fundamental issue\nthat remains to be satisfactorily addressed is the transition of the primordial\nperturbations from their quantum origins to the LSS which can be characterized\ncompletely in terms of classical quantities. Classical bouncing universes\nprovide an alternative to the more conventional inflationary paradigm as they\ncan help overcome the horizon problem in a fashion very similar to inflation.\nWhile the problem of the quantum-to-classical transition of the primordial\nperturbations has been investigated extensively in the context of inflation, we\nfind that there has been a rather limited effort towards studying the issue in\nclassical bouncing universes. In this work, we analyze certain aspects of this\nproblem with the example of tensor perturbations produced in classical matter\nand near-matter bouncing universes. We investigate the issue mainly from two\nperspectives. Firstly, we approach the problem by examining the extent of\nsqueezing of a quantum state associated with the tensor perturbations with the\nhelp of the Wigner function. Secondly, we analyze the issue from the\nperspective of the quantum measurement problem. In particular, we study the\neffects of wave function collapse, using a phenomenological model known as\ncontinuous spontaneous localization, on the tensor power spectra.

Abstract: HH 111 is a Class I protostellar system at a distance of ~ 400 pc, with the\ncentral source VLA 1 associated with a rotating disk deeply embedded in a\nflattened envelope. Here we present the observations of this system at ~ 0.6\"\n(240 AU) resolution in C18O (J=2-1) and 230 GHz continuum obtained with Atacama\nLarge Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, and in SO obtained with Submillimeter\nArray. The observations show for the first time how a Keplerian rotating disk\ncan be formed inside a flattened envelope. The flattened envelope is detected\nin C18O, extending out to >~ 2400 AU from the VLA 1 source. It has a\ndifferential rotation, with the outer part (>~ 2000 AU) better described by a\nrotation that has constant specific angular momentum and the innermost part (<~\n160 AU) by a Keplerian rotation. The rotationally supported disk is therefore\nrelatively compact in this system, which is consistent with the dust continuum\nobservations. Most interestingly, if the flow is in steady state, there is a\nsubstantial drop in specific angular momentum in the envelope-disk transition\nregion from 2000 AU to 160 AU, by a factor of ~ 3. Such a decrease is not\nexpected outside a disk formed from simple hydrodynamic core collapse, but can\nhappen naturally if the core is significantly magnetized, because magnetic\nfields can be trapped in the transition region outside the disk by the ram\npressure of the protostellar accretion flow, which can lead to efficient\nmagnetic braking. In addition, SO shock emission is detected around the outer\nradius of the disk and could trace an accretion shock around the disk. \n\n"}

In terms of spectral morphology, we find that\nPS15si can be matched to a range of SN Ia spectral types, although SN\n1991T-like SNe Ia provides the most self-consistent match.

Most galaxies more massive than\n$3\\times10^{10} M_\\odot$ follow the red-sequence while less massive central\ngalaxies lie on the blue sequence.

In galaxies less massive than\n$3\\times10^{10} M_\\odot$, young stars and supernovae drive a high entropy\noutflow that is more buoyant that any diffuse corona. The outflow balances the\nrate of gas inflow, preventing high gas densities building up in the central\nregions. More massive galaxies, however, are surrounded by a hot corona.

We obtained time resolved r'-band polarimetry when\nthe source was in outburst, near-IR polarimetry when the source was near\nquiescence and multiple wave-band optical polarimetry later in quiescence. The\noptical to near-IR linear polarization spectrum can be described by\ninterstellar dust and an intrinsic variable component. The intrinsic optical\npolarization, detected during the rise of one of the brightest flares of the\noutburst, is variable, peaking at 4.5 per cent and decaying to 3.5 per cent. We\npresent several arguments that favour a synchrotron jet origin to this variable\npolarization, with the optical emission originating close to the jet base. The\npolarization flare occurs during the initial rise of a major radio flare event\nthat peaks later, and is consistent with a classically evolving synchrotron\nflare from an ejection event. We conclude that the optical polarization flare\nrepresents a jet launching event; the birth of a major ejection. For this event\nwe measure a rather stable polarization position angle of -9 degrees E of N,\nimplying that the magnetic field near the base of the jet is approximately\nperpendicular to the jet axis. This may be due to the compression of magnetic\nfield lines in shocks in the accelerated plasma, resulting in a partially\nordered transverse field that have now been seen during the 2015 outburst.

Abstract: [Abridged] Regions of low ionisation where the activity of the\nmagneto-rotational instability is suppressed, the so-called dead zones, have\nbeen suggested to explain gaps and asymmetries of transition disks. We\ninvestigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified\nprescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on\nthe disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create\nsignatures similar to those observed in transition disks. For the dust\nevolution, we included the transport, growth, and fragmentation of dust\nparticles. To compare with observations, we produced synthetic images in\nscattered optical light and in thermal emission at mm wavelengths. In all\nmodels with a dead zone, a bump in the gas surface density is produced that is\nable to efficiently trap large particles ($\\gtrsim 1$ mm) at the outer edge of\nthe dead zone. The gas bump reaches an amplitude of a factor of $\\sim5$, which\ncan be enhanced by the presence of an MHD wind that removes mass from the inner\ndisk. While our 1D simulations suggest that such a structure can be present\nonly for $\\sim$1 Myr, the structure may be maintained for a longer time when\nmore realistic 2D/3D simulations are performed. In the synthetic images,\ngap-like low-emission regions are seen at scattered light and in thermal\nemission at mm wavelengths, as previously predicted in the case of planet-disk\ninteraction. As a conclusion, main signatures of transition disks can be\nreproduced by assuming a dead zone in the disk, such as gap-like structure in\nscattered light and millimetre continuum emission, and a lower gas surface\ndensity within the dead zone. Previous studies showed that the Rossby wave\ninstability can also develop at the edge of such dead zones, forming vortices\nand also creating asymmetries. \n\n"}

Motivated by the evidence for powerful\nradiative shocks within nova outflows, we propose that dust formation occurs\nwithin the cool, dense shell behind these shocks. We incorporate a simple\nmolecular chemistry network and classical nucleation theory with a model for\nthe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas, in order to demonstrate the\nformation of both carbon and forsterite ($\\rm Mg_2SiO_4$) grains. The high\ndensities due to radiative shock compression ($n \\sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$)\nresult in CO saturation and rapid dust nucleation. Grains grow efficiently to\nlarge sizes $\\gtrsim 0.1\\mu$m, in agreement with IR observations of\ndust-producing novae, and with total dust masses sufficient to explain massive\nextinction events such as V705 Cas. As in dense stellar winds, dust formation\nis CO-regulated, with carbon-rich flows producing carbon-rich grains and\noxygen-rich flows primarily forming silicates. CO is destroyed by non-thermal\nparticles accelerated at the shock, allowing additional grain formation at late\ntimes, but the efficiency of this process appears to be low.

The radioactive decay of these unstable\nnuclei also powers a rapidly evolving, supernova-like transient known as a\n\"kilonova\". Kilonovae provide an approximately isotropic electromagnetic\ncounterpart to the GW signal, which also provides a unique and direct probe of\nan important, if not dominant, r-process site. This handbook reviews the\nhistory and physics of kilonovae, leading to the current paradigm of week-long\nemission with a spectral peak at near-infrared wavelengths. Using a simple\nlight curve model to illustrate the basic physics, I introduce potentially\nimportant variations on this canonical picture, including: ~day-long optical\n(\"blue\") emission from lanthanide-free components of the ejecta; ~hours-long\nprecursor UV/blue emission, powered by the decay of free neutrons in the\noutermost ejecta layers; and enhanced emission due to energy input from a\nlong-lived central engine, such as an accreting BH or millisecond magnetar. I\nassess the prospects of detecting kilonovae following future GW detections of\nNS-NS/BH-NS mergers in light of the recent follow-up campaign of the LIGO\nbinary BH-BH mergers. \n\n"}

At\nz=0.1018, it is one of the closest and the UV brightest such events, with 17.4\n(AB) magnitude in Swift UV band (1928A) at -11days pre-maximum. Assuming an\nexponential form, we derived the rise time of 33days and the peak bolometric\nluminosity of 3x10^{44}ergs^-1. At maximum light, the estimated photospheric\ntemperature and velocity are 17,000K and 14,000kms^-1 respectively. The\ninferred radiative and kinetic energy are roughly 1x10^{51} and 2x10^{52}erg.\nGaia16apd is extremely UV luminous, emitting 50% of its total luminosity at\n1000 - 2500A. Compared to the UV spectra (normalized at 3100A) of well studied\nSN1992A (Ia), SN2011fe(Ia), SN1999em (IIP) and SN1993J (IIb), it has orders of\nmagnitude more far-UV emission. This excess is interpreted primarily as a\nresult of weaker metal line blanketing due to much lower abundance of\niron-group elements in the outer ejecta. Because these elements originate\neither from the natal metallicity of the star, or have been newly produced, our\nobservation provides direct evidence that little of these freshly synthesized\nmaterial, including 56Ni, was mixed into the outer ejecta, and the progenitor\nmetallicity is likely sub-solar. This disfavors Pair-Instability Supernova\n(PISN) models with Helium core masses >=90Msun, where substantial 56Ni material\nis produced. Higher photospheric temperature of Gaia16apd than that of normal\nSNe may also contribute to the observed far-UV excess.

Using three different systematically generated sets of\nequations of state we explore the relationship between the moment of inertia of\nJ0737-3039A and the binding energy of the two low mass neutron stars.

We\nfind that, if either J0737-3039B or the J1756-2251 companion were formed in an\nECSN, no more than 0.06 solar masses could have been lost from the progenitor\ncore, more than four times the mass loss predicted by current supernova\nmodeling. A measurement of the moment of inertia of J0737-3039A to within 10%\naccuracy from pulsar timing, possible within a decade, can discriminate between\nformation scenarios such as ECSN or ultra-stripped FeCCSN and, given current\nconstraints on the predicted core mass loss, potentially rule them out.

Using 3D hydrodynamics and radiative transfer\nsimulations, we examine the morphology and contrast of planet-induced arms in\ndisks. We find a power-law relation for the face-on arm contrast ($\\delta_{\\rm\nmax}$) as a function of planet mass ($M_{\\rm p}$) and disk aspect ratio\n($h/r$): $\\delta_{\\rm max}\\approx((M_{\\rm p}/M_{\\rm J})/(h/r)^{1.38})^{0.22}$.\nWith current observational capability, at a 30 AU separation, the minimum\nplanet mass for driving detectable arms in a disk around a 1 Myr 1$M_\\odot$\nstar at 140 pc at low inclinations is around Saturn mass. For planets more\nmassive than Neptune masses, they typically drive multiple arms. Therefore in\nobserved disks with spirals, it is unlikely that each spiral arm originates\nfrom a different planet.

Hopkins & Lee (2016) directly simulated\nthe dynamics of neutral dust grains in super-sonic MHD turbulence, typical of\nGMCs, and showed that the dust-to-gas fluctuations can exceed factor ~1000 on\nsmall scales, with important implications for star formation, stellar\nabundances, and dust behavior and growth. However, even in primarily neutral\ngas in GMCs, dust grains are negatively charged and Lorentz forces are\nnon-negligible. Therefore, we extend our previous study by including the\neffects of Lorentz forces on charged grains (in addition to drag). For small\ncharged grains (sizes <0.1 micron), Lorentz forces suppress dust-to-gas ratio\nfluctuations, while for large grains (sizes >1 micron), Lorentz forces have\nessentially no effect, trends that are well explained with a simple theory of\ndust magnetization. In some special intermediate cases, Lorentz forces can\nenhance dust-gas segregation.

The Local Group dwarf galaxies would have similarly evolved with\nbuilding blocks of the Milky Way halo. However, how the chemo-dynamical\nevolution of the building blocks affects the abundance of r-process elements is\nnot yet clear. In this paper, we perform a series of simulations using dwarf\ngalaxy models with various dynamical times and total mass, which determine\nstar-formation histories. We find that galaxies with dynamical times longer\nthan 100 Myr have star formation rates less than $10^{-3} M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$\nand slowly enrich metals in their early phase. These galaxies can explain the\nobserved large scatters of r-process abundance in EMP stars in the Milky Way\nhalo regardless of their total mass. On the other hand, the first neutron star\nmerger appears at a higher metallicity in galaxies with a dynamical time\nshorter than typical neutron star merger times. The scatters of r-process\nelements mainly come from inhomogeneity of the metals in the interstellar\nmedium whereas the scatters of $\\alpha$-elements are mostly due to the\ndifference in the yield of each supernova.

A novel implementation of Super-Massive Black Hole (SMBH)\nformation and evolution is used, as in Tremmel et al.(2015, 2016), allowing to\nexplicitly follow SMBH dynamics at the center of galaxies. A high SIDM constant\ncross-section is chosen, $\\sigma$=10 $\\rm cm^2/gr$, to amplify differences from\nCDM models. Milky Way-like galaxies form a shallower DM density profile in SIDM\nthan they do in CDM, with differences already at 20 kpc scales. This\ndemonstrates that even for the most massive spirals the effect of SIDM\ndominates over the adiabatic contraction due to baryons. Strikingly, the\ndynamics of SMBHs differs in the SIDM and reference CDM case. SMBHs in massive\nspirals have sunk to the centre of their host galaxy in both the SIDM and CDM\nrun, while in less massive galaxies about 80$\\%$ of the SMBH population is\noff-centered in the SIDM case, as opposed to the CDM case in which $\\sim$90$\\%$\nof SMBHs have reached their host's centre.

The low\ncollisionality of the solar wind allows for non-thermal features to survive,\nwhich suggests the requirement of a kinetic plasma description. The\nleast-damped kinetic slow mode is associated with the ion-acoustic (IA) wave\nand a non-propagating (NP) mode.

This comparison shows major\ndiscrepancies in the predicted wave phase speeds from MHD and kinetic theory at\nmoderate to high $\\beta$.

We\nquantify the relative amplitude of fluctuations in the three lowest particle\nvelocity moments associated with IA and NP modes in the gyrokinetic limit and\ncompare these predictions with MHD results and in-situ observations of the\nsolar-wind turbulence.

Previous studies of such stars were either unable to\nresolve hydrodynamical timescales or considered stars in isolation, not in the\nextreme accretion flows in which they actually form. Therefore, they could not\nself-consistently predict their final masses at collapse, or those of the\nresulting supermassive black hole seeds, but rather invoked comparison to\nsimple polytropic models. Here, we systematically examine the birth, evolution\nand collapse of accreting non-rotating supermassive stars under accretion rates\nof 0.01-10 solar masses per year, using the stellar evolution code KEPLER. Our\napproach includes post-Newtonian corrections to the stellar structure and an\nadaptive nuclear network, and can transition to following the hydrodynamic\nevolution of supermassive stars after they encounter the general relativistic\ninstability. We find that this instability triggers the collapse of the star at\nmasses of 150,000-330,000 solar masses for accretion rates of 0.1-10 solar\nmasses per year, and that the final mass of the star scales roughly\nlogarithmically with the rate. The structure of the star, and thus its\nstability against collapse, is sensitive to the treatment of convection, and\nthe heat content of the outer accreted envelope. Comparison with other codes\nsuggests differences here may lead to small deviations in the evolutionary\nstate of the star as a function of time, that worsen with accretion rate. Since\nthe general relativistic instability leads to the immediate death of these\nstars, our models place an upper limit on the masses of the first quasars at\nbirth. \n\n"}

Aims. We look\nfor the reason for the spectral variability at high spatial resolution and at\nmultiple epochs. Methods. We study the temporal variability of the mid-infrared\ninterferometric signal, observed with the VLTI/MIDI instrument at six epochs\nbetween 2011 and 2014. We fit a geometric disk model to the observed\ninterferometric signal to obtain spatial information about the disk. We also\nmodel the mid-infrared spectra by template fitting to characterize the profile\nand time dependence of the silicate emission. We use physically motivated\nradiative transfer modeling to interpret the mid-infrared interferometric\nspectra. Results. The inner disk (r<1-3 au) spectra exhibit a 10 $\\mu$m\nabsorption feature related to amorphous silicate grains. The outer disk (r>1-3\nau) spectra show a crystalline silicate feature in emission, similar to the\nspectra of comet Hale-Bopp. The striking difference between the inner and outer\ndisk spectral feature is highly unusual among T Tauri stars. The mid-infrared\nvariability is dominated by the outer disk. The strength of the silicate\nfeature changed by more than a factor of two.

For the origin of the absorption we discuss four possible\nexplanations: a cold obscuring envelope, an accretion heated inner disk, a\ntemperature inversion on the disk surface and a misaligned inner geometry. The\nsilicate emission in the outer disk can be explained by dusty material high\nabove the disk plane, whose mass can change with time, possibly due to\nturbulence in the disk. \n\n"}

The broadband\n$XMM$-$Newton+NuSTAR$ spectrum of P13 is qualitatively similar to the rest of\nthe ULX sample with broadband coverage, suggesting that additional ULXs in the\nknown population may host neutron star accretors. Through time-averaged,\nphase-resolved and multi-epoch studies, we find that two non-pulsed thermal\nblackbody components with temperatures $\\sim$0.5 and $\\sim$1.5 keV are required\nto fit the data below 10 keV, in addition to a third continuum component which\nextends to higher energies and is associated with the pulsed emission from the\naccretion column.

In this\nscenario, stars with no/little abundance variations first form from a massive\nmolecular cloud (MC). After all of the remaining gas of the MC is expelled by\nnumerous supernovae, gas ejected from asymptotic giant branch stars can be\naccumulated in the central region of the GC to form a high-density\nintra-cluster medium (ICM). Merging of neutron stars then occurs to eject\nr-process elements, which can be efficiently trapped in and subsequently mixed\nwith the ICM. New stars formed from the ICM can have r-process abundances quite\ndifferent from those of earlier generations of stars within the GC. This\nscenario can explain both (i) why r-process elements can be trapped within GCs\nand (ii) why GCs with internal abundance spreads in r-process elements do not\nshow [Fe/H] spreads. Our model shows that (i) a large fraction of Eu-rich stars\ncan be seen in Na-enhanced stellar populations of GCs, as observed in M15, and\n(ii) why most of the Galactic GCs do not exhibit such internal abundance\nspreads.

It has been suggested recently that a\nHe-rich WD (a He WD or a hybrid HeCO WD) merges with a CO WD may produce an SN\nIa. This theory was based on the double-detonation model, in which the shock\ncompression in the CO core caused by the surface explosion of the He-rich shell\nmight lead to the explosion of the whole CO WD. However, so far, very few\nbinary population synthesis (BPS) studies have been made on the merger scenario\nof a CO WD and a He-rich WD in the context of SNe Ia. Aims: We aim to\nsystematically study the Galactic birthrates and delay-time distributions of\nSNe Ia based on the merger scenario of a CO WD and a He-rich WD. Methods: We\nperformed a series of Monte Carlo BPS simulations to investigate the properties\nof SNe Ia from the merging of a CO WD and a He-rich WD based on the Hurley\nrapid binary evolution code. We also considered the influence of different\nmetallicities on the final results. Results: From our simulations, we found\nthat no more than 15% of all SNe Ia stem from the merger scenario of a CO WD\nand a He-rich WD, and their delay times range from ~110 Myr to the Hubble time.\nThis scenario mainly contributes to SN Ia explosions with intermediate and long\ndelay times. The present work indicates that the merger scenario of a CO WD and\na He-rich WD can roughly reproduce the birthrates of SN 1991bg-like events, and\ncover the range of their delay times. We also found that SN Ia birthrates from\nthis scenario would be higher for the cases with low metallicities. \n\n"}

Ring-shaped emission is found\nto be a common feature of all adopted models; the highest abundance is found in\nthe upper outer regions of the disk, and the column density peaks at 30-100 AU\nfor T Tauri stars with standard accretion rates. Higher mass disks generally\nshow brighter CN. Higher UV fields, such as those appropriate for T Tauri stars\nwith high accretion rates or for Herbig Ae stars or for higher disk flaring,\ngenerally result in brighter and larger rings. These trends are due to the main\nformation paths of CN, which all start with vibrationally excited H2*\nmolecules, that are produced through far ultraviolet (FUV) pumping of H2. The\nmodel results compare well with observed disk-integrated CN fluxes and the\nobserved location of the CN ring for the TW Hya disk.

The mass range for ECSN from close binary systems is\nthought to be wider than the range for single stars, because of the effects of\nmass transfer on the helium core. Using the MESA stellar evolution code we\nexplored the parameter space of initial primary masses between 8 $M_\\odot$ and\n17 $M_\\odot$, using a large grid of models.

In\nthis monolithic formation scenario, low density OB associations are formed from\nthe expansion of gravitationally bound clusters following gas expulsion due to\nstellar feedback. $N$-body simulations of this process show that OB\nassociations formed this way retain signs of expansion and elevated radial\nanisotropy over tens of Myr. However, recent theoretical and observational\nstudies suggest that star formation is a hierarchical process, following the\nfractal nature of natal molecular clouds and allowing the formation of\nlarge-scale associations in-situ. We distinguish between these two scenarios by\ncharacterising the kinematics of OB associations using the Tycho-$Gaia$\nAstrometric Solution catalogue. To this end, we quantify four key kinematic\ndiagnostics: the number ratio of stars with positive radial velocities to those\nwith negative radial velocities, the median radial velocity, the median radial\nvelocity normalised by the tangential velocity, and the radial anisotropy\nparameter. Each quantity presents a useful diagnostic of whether the\nassociation was more compact in the past. We compare these diagnostics to\nmodels representing random motion and the expanding products of monolithic\ncluster formation. None of these diagnostics show evidence of expansion, either\nfrom a single cluster or multiple clusters, and the observed kinematics are\nbetter represented by a random velocity distribution. This result favours the\nhierarchical star formation model in which a minority of stars forms in bound\nclusters and large-scale, hierarchically-structured associations are formed\nin-situ. \n\n"}

Such evolution is thought to lead to the inspiral of the binary, the\nejection of the extended envelope and the formation of a remnant short-period\nbinary. However, detailed hydrodynamical models of CEE encounter major\ndifficulties. They show that following the inspiral most of the envelope is not\nejected; though it expands to larger separations, it remains bound to the\nbinary.

Pulsations in an AGB-star drives\nthe expansion of its envelope, allowing the material to cool down to low\ntemperatures thus enabling dust condensation. Radiation pressure on the dust\naccelerates it, and through its coupling to the gas it drives winds which\neventually completely erode the envelope.

The cross-correlation function (CCF) of the optical and near-IR\ndata reveals a strong, broad negative anti-correlation at negative lags, a\nbroad positive correlation at positive lags, with a strong, positive narrow\ncorrelation superimposed. The shape of the CCF resembles the CCF of black hole\nX-ray binaries but the time-scales are different. The features can be explained\nby reprocessing and a hot accretion flow close to the neutron star's\nmagnetospheric radius. The optical emission is dominated by the reprocessed\ncomponent, whereas the near-IR emission contains the emission from plasmoids in\nthe hot accretion flow and a reprocessed component. The rapid active-passive\nstate transition occurs when the hot accretion flow material is channelled onto\nthe neutron star and is expelled from its magnetosphere.

The accretion of clumpy material through the magnetic\nbarrier of the neutron star produces the observed near-IR/optical CCF and\nvariability. The dip at negative lags corresponds to the suppression of the\nnear-IR synchrotron component in the hot flow, whereas the broad positive\ncorrelation at positive lags is driven by the increased synchrotron emission of\nthe outflowing plasmoids.

We consider a weakly nonlinear\ncase governed by a quadratic nonlinearity, and also analyse the fully nonlinear\nequations of motion. We treat the prominence as a massive line current located\nabove the photosphere and interacting with the magnetised dipped environment\nvia the Lorentz force. In this concept the magnetic dip is produced by two\nexternal current sources located at the photosphere. Finite amplitude\nhorizontal and vertical oscillations are found to be strongly coupled between\neach other. The coupling is more efficient for larger amplitudes and smaller\nattack angles between the direction of the driver and the horizontal axis.\nSpatial structure of oscillations is represented by Lissajous-like curves with\nthe limit cycle of a hourglass shape, appearing in the resonant case, when the\nfrequency of the vertical mode is twice the horizontal mode frequency. A\nmetastable equilibrium of the prominence is revealed, which is stable for small\namplitude displacements, and becomes horizontally unstable, when the amplitude\nexceeds a threshold value. The maximum oscillation amplitudes are also\nanalytically derived and analysed. Typical oscillation periods are determined\nby the oscillation amplitude, prominence current, its mass and position above\nthe photosphere, and the parameters of the magnetic dip. The main new effects\nof the finite amplitude are the coupling of the horizontally and vertically\npolarised transverse oscillations (i.e. the lack of a simple, elliptically\npolarised regime) and the presence of metastable equilibria of prominences. \n\n"}

We use a heat conduction prescription based on the Kramers\nopacity law which allows the depth of the convection zone to dynamically adapt\nto changes in the physical characteristics such as rotation rate and magnetic\nfields. We find that the convective heat transport is strongly concentrated\ntoward the equatorial and polar regions in the cases without a substantial\nradiative layer below the convection zone. The presence of a stable layer below\nthe convection zone significantly reduces the anisotropy of radial enthalpy\ntransport. Furthermore, the dynamo solutions are sensitive to subtle changes in\nthe convection zone structure.

Up to\nnow, the process of how OB associations were formed remained a mystery. A\npossible process is self-regulating star formation driven by feedback from\nmassive stars. However, although a number of observational studies uncovered\nvarious signposts of feedback-driven star formation, the effectiveness of such\nfeedback has been questioned. Stellar and gas kinematics is a promising tool to\ncapture the relative motion of newborn stars and gas away from ionizing\nsources. We present high-resolution spectroscopy of stars and gas in the young\nopen cluster NGC 1893. Our findings show that newborn stars and the tadpole\nnebula Sim 130 are moving away from the central cluster containing two O-type\nstars, and that the timescale of sequential star formation is about 1 Myr\nwithin a 9 parsec distance. The newborn stars formed by feedback from massive\nstars account for at least 18 per cent of the total stellar population in the\ncluster, suggesting that this process can play an important role in the\nformation of OB associations.

The first is magnetocentrifugal acceleration (MCA), the\noverwhelmingly favored mechanism for the production of jets in most steady\naccreting systems. The second is the zero-torque inner boundary condition. The\nthird is that effective viscous dissipation is like real dissipation, leading\ndirectly to heating. All three assumptions fit nicely together in a manner that\nis simple, persuasive, and mutually-consistent. All, I argue, are incorrect.\nFor concreteness I focus on protostars. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in\naccretion is not a sink of energy, but a reservoir, capable of doing mechanical\nwork directly and therefore efficiently, rather than solely through ohmic\n(\"viscous\") heating. Advection of turbulence energy reduces the effective\nradiative efficiency, and may help solve the missing boundary-layer emission\nproblem. The angular momentum problem, whereby accretion spins up a protostar\nto breakup, is resolved by allowing direct viscous coupling to the protostar,\npermitting substantially greater energy to be deposited into the accretion flow\nthan otherwise possible. This goes not into heat, but into a turbulent,\ntangled, buoyant toroidal magnetic field. I argue that there is neither an\nangular momentum problem nor an efficiency problem that MCA is needed to solve.\nMoreover, the turbulent magnetic field has ample ability not just to collimate\nbut to accelerate gas, first radially inwards through tension forces and then\nvertically through pressure forces, without any MCA mechanism. I suggest then\nthat jets, particularly the most powerful and well-collimated protostellar\njets, are not magnetocentrifugally driven. \n\n"}

{"id": "1803.08042", "contents": "Title: Very Massive Stars: a metallicity-dependent upper-mass limit, slow\n  winds, and the self-enrichment of Globular Clusters Abstract: One of the key questions in Astrophysics concerns the issue of whether there\nexists an upper-mass limit to stars, and if so, what physical mechanism sets\nthis limit, which might also determine if the upper-mass limit is metallicity\n(Z) dependent. We argue that mass loss by radiation-driven winds mediated by\nline opacity is one of the prime candidates setting the upper-mass limit. We\npresent mass-loss predictions (dM/dt_wind) from Monte Carlo radiative transfer\nmodels for relatively cool (Teff = 15kK) inflated very massive stars (VMS) with\nlarge Eddington Gamma factors in the mass range 100-1000 Msun as a function of\nmetallicity down to 1/100 Z/Zsun. We employ a hydrodynamic version of our Monte\nCarlo method, allowing us to predict the rate of mass loss (dM/dt_wind) and the\nterminal wind velocity (vinf) simultaneously. Interestingly, we find wind\nterminal velocities (vinf) that are low (100-500 km/s) over a wide Z-range, and\nwe propose that the slow winds from VMS are an important source of\nself-enrichment in globular clusters. We also find mass-loss rates\n(dM/dt_wind), exceeding the typical mass-accretion rate (dM/dt_accr) of 0.001\nMsun/yr during massive-star formation. We express our mass-loss predictions as\na function of mass and Z, finding log dM/dt = -9.13 + 2.1 log(M/Msun) + 0.74\nlog(Z/Zsun) (Msun/yr). Even if stellar winds would not directly halt & reverse\nmass accretion during star formation, if the most massive stars form by stellar\nmergers stellar wind mass loss may dominate over the rate at which stellar\ngrowth takes place. We therefore argue that the upper-mass limit is effectively\nZ-dependent due to the nature of radiation-driven winds.

The post-peak optical light curves show a long,\nlinear decline with a steep slope of 2.5 mag/100 days (i.e., an exponential\ndecline in flux), through the end of observations at phase ~260 days. In\ncontrast, the light curves of hydrogen rich supernovae (SNe II-P/L) always show\nbreaks in their light curves at phase ~100 days, before settling onto Co56\nradioactive decay tails with a decline rate of about 1 mag/100 days. The\nspectra of ASASSN-15nx do not exhibit the narrow emission-line features\ncharacteristic of Type IIn SNe, which can have a wide variety of light-curve\nshapes usually attributed to strong interactions with a dense circumstellar\nmedium (CSM). ASASSN-15nx has a number of spectroscopic peculiarities,\nincluding a relatively weak and triangularly-shaped H-alpha emission profile\nwith no absorption component. The physical origin of these peculiarities is\nunclear, but the long and linear post-peak light curve without a break suggests\na single dominant powering mechanism. Decay of a large amount of Ni56 (M_Ni56 =\n1.6 +/- 0.2 M_sun) can power the light curve of ASASSN-15nx, and the steep\nlight-curve slope requires substantial gamma-ray escape from the ejecta, which\nis possible given a low-mass hydrogen envelope for the progenitor. Another\npossibility is strong CSM interactions powering the light curve, but the CSM\nneeds to be sculpted to produce the unique light-curve shape and to avoid\nproducing SN IIn-like narrow emission lines. \n\n"}

All of these characteristics are consistent\nwith models of self-scattering of submillimeter-wave emission from an optically\nthin inclined disk. The distribution of the polarization position angles across\nthe disk reveals that while the average orientation is along the minor axis,\nthe polarization orientations show a significant spread in angles; this can\nalso be explained by models of pure scattering.

The method is based on the neutrino-driven mechanism and follows\ncollapse, bounce and explosion. There are two crucial aspects of our model for\nnucleosynthesis predictions.

We apply\nthis to a family of thin exponential disks with different central surface\ndensities.

Newtonian\nmodels thus require putative very massive halos, whose inert nature implies\nthey would strongly stabilize the disk.\n  MOND also increases the stability of galactic disks, but in contradistinction\nto Newtonian gravity, this extra stability is limited to a factor of 2.

We find that the algorithm picks out a wide range of groups (1 -- 25)\nfor statistically identical initial conditions, and cannot distinguish between\nsubvirial and supervirial regions in that we obtain similar mode and median\nvalues for the number of groups it identifies. We find no correlation between\nthe number of groups identified initially and either the initial or subsequent\nspatial and kinematic tracers of the regions' evolution, such as the amount of\nspatial substructure, dynamical mass segregation, or velocity dispersion. We\ntherefore urge caution in using the Friends of Friends algorithm to quantify\nthe initial conditions of star formation. \n\n"}

This work identifies local\noverdense stellar structures at the 99.8\\% confidence level above random\nexpectation using the DBSCAN algorithm, and setting its free parameters based\non the one-point correlation function and the k-nearest neighbor statistics.\nNearly half of the entire stellar population in Taurus is found to be\nconcentrated in 20 dense, tiny and prolate regions called NESTs (for Nested\nElementary STructures). They are regularly spaced ($\\approx 2$ pc) and mainly\noriented along the gas filaments axes. Each NEST contains between 4 and 23\nstars. Inside NESTs, the surface density of stars may be as high as 2500\npc$^{-2}$. Nearly half (11) of these NESTs contain about 75\\% of the class 0/I\nobjects. The balance between Class I, II, and, III fraction within the NESTs\nsuggests that they may be ordered as an evolutionary temporal scheme. We have\ninferred that only 20\\% of stars in Taurus do not belong to any kind of stellar\ngroups. The mass of NESTs covers the same range as that of dense molecular\ncores. The distribution in size is bimodal peaking at 12.5 and 50 kAU and the\ndistribution of the number of YSOs in NESTs as a function of size exhibits two\nregimes. We propose that the NESTs in their two size regimes represent the\nspatial imprints of stellar distribution at birth as they may have emerged\nwithin few millions years from their natal cloud either from a single core or\nfrom a chain of cores.

However, previous afterglow modeling studies\nwere based on a simplified assumption that the acceleration efficiency is\nextremely high, i.e. all electrons in the shock are accelerated as a nonthermal\npopulation. This affects the estimate of the minimum electron energy and hence\n$\\nu_m$, the peak frequency of the afterglow spectrum. Here we present Bayesian\nfitting to the observed data with a more natural electron energy distribution,\nin which the acceleration efficiency is a free parameter. Interestingly, the\nmaximum likelihood solutions are found with radio flux below $\\nu_m$ in the\nearly phase, in contrast to previous studies that found the radio frequency\nalways above $\\nu_m$. Therefore the $\\nu_m$ passage through the radio band\ncould have been clearly detected for GW170817, if sufficient low-frequency\nradio data had been taken in early time.

The feature of these orbital parameters is used to constrain\nthe evolutionary processes of progenitor binaries and the supernova (SN) kicks\nof the second born NSs.

In\nparticular, the abundances of deuterated species are very sensitive to the\nphysical conditions in the environment where they form. Due to the low\ntemperatures in regions of star formation, these isotopologues are enhanced to\nsignificant levels, making detections of multiply-deuterated species possible.\nHowever, for complex organic species, only the multiply-deuterated variants of\nmethanol and methyl cyanide have been reported so far. The aim of this paper is\nto initiate the characterisation of multiply-deuterated variants of complex\norganic species with the first detection of doubly-deuterated methyl formate,\nCHD2OCHO. We use ALMA observations from the Protostellar Interferometric Line\nSurvey (PILS) of the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422, in the spectral range\nof 329.1 GHz to 362.9 GHz. We report the first detection of doubly-deuterated\nmethyl formate CHD2OCHO in the ISM. The D/H ratio of CHD2OCHO is found to be\n2-3 times higher than the D/H ratio of CH2DOCHO for both sources, similar to\nthe results for formaldehyde from the same dataset. The observations are\ncompared to a gas-grain chemical network coupled to a dynamical physical model,\ntracing the evolution of a molecular cloud until the end of the Class 0\nprotostellar stage. The overall D/H ratio enhancements found in the\nobservations are of the same order of magnitude as the predictions from the\nmodel for the early stages of Class 0 protostars. However, the higher D/H ratio\nof CHD2OCHO compared to the D/H ratio of CH2DOCHO is still not predicted by the\nmodel. This suggests that a mechanism is enhancing the D/H ratio of singly- and\ndoubly-deuterated methyl formate that is not in the model, e.g. mechanisms for\nH-D substitutions. \n\n"}

This study presents non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent radiative transfer simulations of\nvarious single carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet star explosions influenced by magnetars\nof diverse properties and covering from a few days to one or two years after\nexplosion. Nonthermal processes are treated; the magnetar-power deposition\nprofile is prescribed; dynamical effects are ignored. In this context, the main\ninfluence of the magnetar power is to boost the internal energy of the ejecta\non week-long time scales, enhancing the ejecta temperature and ionization,\nshifting the spectral energy distribution to the near-UV (even for the adopted\nsolar metallicity), creating blue optical colors. Varying the ejecta and\nmagnetar properties introduces various stretches and shifts to the light curve\n(rise time, peak or nebular luminosity, light curve width). At maximum, all\nmodels show the presence of OII and CII lines in the optical, and more rarely\nOIII and CIII lines. Non-thermal effects are found to be negligible during the\nhigh-brightness phase.

Since the evolution can be described by a planar flow in the normal\nplane, we derive most of our results in the context of a toy model for planar\nfluid flow. We then generalize our results to include the effects of field-line\ncurvature. We show that the type of flow is determined by the two non-zero\neigenvalues of the gradient of the normalized magnetic field. The eigenvalue\ndifference quantifies the local rate of squeezing or coiling of neighboring\nfield lines, which we relate to standard notions of fluid vorticity and shear.\nThe resulting squeezing rate can be used in the detection of null points,\nhyperbolic flux tubes and current sheets. Once integrated along field lines,\nthat rate gives a squeeze factor, which is an approximation to the squashing\nfactor, which is usually employed in locating quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs),\nwhich are possible sites for magnetic reconnection. Unlike the squeeze factor,\nthe squashing factor can miss QSLs for which field lines are squeezed and then\nunsqueezed.

We compare mass infall rates of tidal-disruption debris of a non-rotating\nand of a rotating star when they come close to the supermassive black hole.\nRemarkably the mass distribution of debris bound to the black hole as a\nfunction of specific energy shows clear difference between rotating and\nnon-rotating stars, even if the stellar rotation is far from the break-up\nlimit. The debris of a star whose initial spin is parallel to the orbital\nangular momentum has a mass distribution which extends to lower energy than\nthat of non-rotating star. The debris of a star with anti-parallel spin has a\nlarger energy compared with a non-rotating counterpart. As a result, debris\nfrom a star with anti-parallel spin is bound more loosely to the black hole and\nthe mass-infall rate rises later in time, while that of a star with a parallel\nspin is tightly bound and falls back to the black hole earlier. The different\nrising timescales of mass-infall rate may affect the early phase of flares due\nto the tidal disruptions.\n  In the Appendix we study the disruptions by using a uniform-density ellipsoid\nmodel which approximately takes into account the effect of strong gravity of\nthe black hole. We find the mass infall rate reaches its maximum earlier for\nstrong gravity cases because the debris is trapped in a deeper potential well\nof the black hole. \n\n"}

Another goal of our work was to\ncheck if the equinoctial precession predicted for a rigid Mars could have been\nsufficient to repel the orbits away from the equator. We show that for low\ninitial inclinations, the orbit inclination reckoned from the precessing\nequator of date is subject only to small variations.

Nevertheless, the analysis\nconfirms that an oblate planet can, indeed, afford large variations of the\nequinoctial precession over hundreds of millions of years, without repelling\nits near-equatorial satellites away from the equator of date: the satellite\ninclination oscillates but does not show a secular increase.

We find that this $c$ function runs in accordance with the\n$c$-theorem as the boundary universe evolves, this means that the number of\ndegrees of freedom is divergent at big bang and suggests the possible\nresolution of big bang singularity. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/9406016", "contents": "Title: As time goes by Abstract: A rather simple and non-technical exposition of our new approach to {\\em\nTime, Quantum Physics, Black-Hole dynamics}, and {\\em Cosmology}, based on\nnon-critical string theory, is provided. A new fundamental principle, the {\\em\nProcrustean Principle}, that catches the essence of our approach is postulated:\nthe low-energy world is {\\em unavoidably} an ``open\" system due to the\nspontaneous truncation of the {\\em delocalized, topological} string modes in\ncontinuous interaction with the low-lying-{\\em localized} string modes. The\norigin of space-time, the expansion of the Universe, the entropy increase and\naccompanied irreversibility of time, as well as the collapse of the\nwavefunction are all very neatly tied together. Possible observable\nconsequences include: quantum relaxation with time of the Universal,\nfundamental constants, like the velocity of light $c$ and the Planck constant\n$\\hbar$ decreasing towards their asymptotic values, and the cosmological\nconstant $\\Lambda_C$ diminishing towards zero; possible violation of {\\em CPT}\ninvariance in the $K^0-\\bar K^0$ system, possible apparent non-conservation of\nangular momentum, and possible loss of quantum coherence in SQUID-type\nexperiments. \n\n"}
