Our method takes advantage of the same\nelectron bunch to produce both an XFEL pulse and an ultrashort optical pulse\nwith the help of an optical radiator downstream of the x-ray undulator. Since\nboth pulses are produced by the same electron bunch, they are perfectly\nsynchronized. Application of cross-correlation techniques will allow to\ndetermine relative jitter between the optical pulse (and, thus, the XFEL pulse)\nand a pulse from an external pump-laser with femtosecond resolution. Technical\nrealization of the proposed timing scheme uses an optical replica synthesizer\n(ORS) setup to be installed after the final bunch-compression stage of the\nXFEL. The electron bunch is modulated in the ORS setup by an external optical\nlaser. Subsequently, it travels through the main undulator, and produces the\nXFEL pulse. Finally, a powerful optical pulse of coherent edge radiation is\ngenerated as the bunch passes through a long straight section and a separation\nmagnet downstream of the main undulator.

It turns out that a simple version of a lazy baker map gives an\nideal system in which classical sum rules, their corrections, and their\nfluctuations can be worked out analytically.

Several recent studies\nargue that the loss of summer sea ice does not involve an irreversible\nbifurcation, because it is highly reversible in models. However, a broader\ndefinition of a `tipping point' also includes other abrupt, non-linear changes\nthat are neither bifurcations nor necessarily irreversible. Examination of\nsatellite data for Arctic sea-ice area reveals an abrupt increase in the\namplitude of seasonal variability in 2007 that has persisted since then. We\nidentified this abrupt transition using recently developed methods that can\ndetect multi-modality in time-series data and sometimes forewarn of\nbifurcations. When removing the mean seasonal cycle (up to 2008) from the\nsatellite data, the residual sea-ice fluctuations switch from uni-modal to\nmulti-modal behaviour around 2007. We originally interpreted this as a\nbifurcation in which a new lower ice cover attractor appears in deseasonalised\nfluctuations and is sampled in every summer-autumn from 2007 onwards. However,\nthis interpretation is clearly sensitive to how the seasonal cycle is removed\nfrom the raw data, and to the presence of continental land masses restricting\nwinter-spring ice fluctuations. Furthermore, there was no robust early warning\nsignal of critical slowing down prior to the hypothesized bifurcation. Early\nwarning indicators do however show destabilization of the summer-autumn sea-ice\ncover since 2007. Thus, the bifurcation hypothesis lacks consistent support,\nbut there was an abrupt and persistent increase in the amplitude of the\nseasonal cycle of Arctic sea-ice cover in 2007, which we describe as a\n(non-bifurcation) `tipping point'. Our statistical methods detect this `tipping\npoint' and its time of onset. \n\n"}

In this\ncase it is desired to have a strong energy dependence of the direction of the\nextracted beam thus allowing to run multiple target stations simultaneously.\nSecond we consider a fast variable energy proton machine for cancer therapy\nthat should allow extraction (of the complete beam) at all energies in the\nrange of about 70 MeV to about 250 MeV into the same beam line. And third, we\nconsider a high intensity high energy machine, where the main design goals are\nextraction with low losses, low activation of components and high reliability.\n  The price that has to be paid for these advantages is an increase in size\nand/or in field strength compared to proton machines with standard extraction\nat the final energy. \n\n"}

Such contradictory\nobservations suggest that the stationary states be unstable. In this study we\ndevelop a new approach to investigate the stability property of traffic flow in\nthis and other networks. Based on the observation that kinematic waves\npropagate in a circular path when only one of the two intermediate links is\ncongested, we derive a one-dimensional, discrete Poincar\\'e map in the out-flux\nat a Poincar\\'e section. We then prove that the fixed points of the Poincar\\'e\nmap correspond to stationary flow-rates on the two links. With Lyapunov's first\nmethod, we demonstrate that the Poincar\\'e map can be finite-time stable,\nasymptotically stable, or unstable. When unstable, the map is found to have\nperiodical points of period two, but no chaotic solutions. Comparing the\nresults with those in existing studies, we conclude that the Poincar\\'e map can\nbe used to represent network-wide dynamics in the kinematic wave model. We\nfurther analyze the bifurcation in the stability of the Poincar\\'e map caused\nby varying route choice proportions. We further apply the Poincar\\'e map\napproach to analyzing traffic patterns in more general $(DM)^n$ and beltway\nnetworks, which are sufficient and necessary structures for network-induced\nunstable traffic and gridlock, respectively. This study demonstrates that the\nPoincar\\'e map approach can be efficiently applied to analyze traffic dynamics\nin any road networks with circular information propagation and provides new\ninsights into unstable traffic dynamics caused by interactions among network\nbottlenecks. \n\n"}

If the robot is damaged, it uses these intuitions to guide a\ntrial-and-error learning algorithm that conducts intelligent experiments to\nrapidly discover a compensatory behavior that works in spite of the damage.\nExperiments reveal successful adaptations for a legged robot injured in five\ndifferent ways, including damaged, broken, and missing legs, and for a robotic\narm with joints broken in 14 different ways. This new technique will enable\nmore robust, effective, autonomous robots, and suggests principles that animals\nmay use to adapt to injury. \n\n"}

The models proposed\nrecently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of\nencoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into\na fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation.

However, while neurophysiologists have long been able to record\nthe responses of neurons in awake, behaving animals, it is another matter\nentirely to say what a given neuron does. A key problem is that in many sensory\ndomains, the space of all possible stimuli that one might encounter is\neffectively infinite; in vision, for instance, natural scenes are\ncombinatorially complex, and an organism will only encounter a tiny fraction of\npossible stimuli. As a result, even describing the response properties of\nsensory neurons is difficult, and investigations of neuronal functions are\nalmost always critically limited by the number of stimuli that can be\nconsidered. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop, optimization-based\nexperimental framework for characterizing the response properties of sensory\nneurons, building on past efforts in closed-loop experimental methods, and\nleveraging recent advances in artificial neural networks to serve as as a\nproving ground for our techniques. Specifically, using deep convolutional\nneural networks, we asked whether modern black-box optimization techniques can\nbe used to interrogate the \"tuning landscape\" of an artificial neuron in a\ndeep, nonlinear system, without imposing significant constraints on the space\nof stimuli under consideration. We introduce a series of measures to quantify\nthe tuning landscapes, and show how these relate to the performances of the\nnetworks in an object recognition task. To the extent that deep convolutional\nneural networks increasingly serve as de facto working hypotheses for\nbiological vision, we argue that developing a unified approach for studying\nboth artificial and biological systems holds great potential to advance both\nfields together. \n\n"}

Many heuristics and strategies have been proposed in the\nliterature for estimating these values. Few, if any, of these methods were\ndeveloped with forecasting in mind, however, and their results are not optimal\nfor that purpose.

Once the\nnetwork operates in this configuration, it performs efficiently on a specific\napplication both in terms of (i) low prediction error and (ii) high short-term\nmemory capacity. Since the behavior of recurrent networks is strongly\ninfluenced by the particular input signal driving the dynamics, a universal,\napplication-independent method for determining the edge of criticality is still\nmissing. In this paper, we aim at addressing this issue by proposing a\ntheoretically motivated, unsupervised method based on Fisher information for\ndetermining the edge of criticality in recurrent neural networks. It is proven\nthat Fisher information is maximized for (finite-size) systems operating in\nsuch critical regions. However, Fisher information is notoriously difficult to\ncompute and either requires the probability density function or the conditional\ndependence of the system states with respect to the model parameters. The paper\ntakes advantage of a recently-developed non-parametric estimator of the Fisher\ninformation matrix and provides a method to determine the critical region of\necho state networks, a particular class of recurrent networks. The considered\ncontrol parameters, which indirectly affect the echo state network performance,\nare explored to identify those configurations lying on the edge of criticality\nand, as such, maximizing Fisher information and computational performance.\nExperimental results on benchmarks and real-world data demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. \n\n"}

In this paper, we present a\npossible framework to address this question, by studying the distributions of\ndisruption times for chaotic gravitational encounters as a function of the\nnumber of interacting particles. To this end, we perform a series of numerical\nscattering experiments with the \\texttt{FEWBODY} code, to calculate the\ndistributions of disruption times as a function of both the particle number N\nand the virial coefficient k. The subsequent distributions are fit with a\nphysically-motivated function, consisting of an initial exponential decay\nfollowed by a very slowly decreasing tail at long encounter times due to\nlong-lived quasi-stable encounters. We find three primary features\ncharacteristic of the calculated distributions of disruption times.

In this paper, we propose to view the generation of the\nglobal interaction between two texts as a recursive process: i.e. the\ninteraction of two texts at each position is a composition of the interactions\nbetween their prefixes as well as the word level interaction at the current\nposition.

By contrast, artificial neural networks\ntrained with backpropagation generally have fixed connection weights that do\nnot change once training is complete. While recent methods can endow neural\nnetworks with long-term memories, Hebbian plasticity is currently not amenable\nto gradient descent. Here we derive analytical expressions for activity\ngradients in neural networks with Hebbian plastic connections. Using these\nexpressions, we can use backpropagation to train not just the baseline weights\nof the connections, but also their plasticity. As a result, the networks \"learn\nhow to learn\" in order to solve the problem at hand: the trained networks\nautomatically perform fast learning of unpredictable environmental features\nduring their lifetime, expanding the range of solvable problems. We test the\nalgorithm on various on-line learning tasks, including pattern completion,\none-shot learning, and reversal learning. The algorithm successfully learns how\nto learn the relevant associations from one-shot instruction, and fine-tunes\nthe temporal dynamics of plasticity to allow for continual learning in response\nto changing environmental parameters.

Recent\nresearch in the area of deep-learning has demonstrated the power of learning\nfeatures directly from the data; and related research in recurrent neural\nnetworks has shown exemplary results in sequence-to-sequence problems such as\nneural machine translation and neural image caption generation. Motivated by\nthese approaches, we propose a novel method to predict the future motion of a\npedestrian given a short history of their, and their neighbours, past\nbehaviour. The novelty of the proposed method is the combined attention model\nwhich utilises both \"soft attention\" as well as \"hard-wired\" attention in order\nto map the trajectory information from the local neighbourhood to the future\npositions of the pedestrian of interest.

On-line planning\nwith look-ahead trees has proven successful in environments where transition\nmodels are known a priori. However, in complex environments where transition\nmodels need to be learned from data, the deficiencies of learned models have\nlimited their utility for planning. To address these challenges, we propose\nTreeQN, a differentiable, recursive, tree-structured model that serves as a\ndrop-in replacement for any value function network in deep RL with discrete\nactions. TreeQN dynamically constructs a tree by recursively applying a\ntransition model in a learned abstract state space and then aggregating\npredicted rewards and state-values using a tree backup to estimate Q-values.

In this\npaper, we propose a three-dimensional envelope instability model to study the\ninstability for a bunched beam in a periodic solenoid and radio-frequency (RF)\nfocusing channel and a periodic quadrupole and RF focusing channel. This study\nshows that when the transverse zero current phase advance is below $90$\ndegrees, the beam envelope can still become unstable if the longitudinal zero\ncurrent phase advance is beyond $90$ degrees. For the transverse zero current\nphase advance beyond $90$ degrees, the instability stopband width becomes\nlarger with the increase of the longitudinal focusing strength and even shows\ndifferent structure from the 2D case when the longitudinal zero current phase\nadvance is beyond $90$ degrees.

For\ncommon applications of neural networks, high order derivatives are not readily\navailable, so simpler cases are considered: training network to approximate\nanalytical function inside 2D and 5D domains and solving Poisson equation\ninside a 2D circle. For function approximation, the cost is a sum of squared\ndifferences between output and target as well as their derivatives with respect\nto the input. Differential equations are usually solved by putting a multilayer\nperceptron in place of unknown function and training its weights, so that\nequation holds within some margin of error.

Plasma wakefield\nacceleration, in which the electrons in a plasma are excited, leading to strong\nelectric fields, is one such promising novel acceleration technique. Pioneering\nexperiments have shown that an intense laser pulse or electron bunch traversing\na plasma, drives electric fields of 10s GV/m and above. These values are well\nbeyond those achieved in conventional RF accelerators which are limited to ~0.1\nGV/m. A limitation of laser pulses and electron bunches is their low stored\nenergy, which motivates the use of multiple stages to reach very high energies.\nThe use of proton bunches is compelling, as they have the potential to drive\nwakefields and accelerate electrons to high energy in a single accelerating\nstage. The long proton bunches currently available can be used, as they undergo\nself-modulation, a particle-plasma interaction which longitudinally splits the\nbunch into a series of high density microbunches, which then act resonantly to\ncreate large wakefields.

Pruning techniques\nand Winograd convolution are two typical methods to reduce the CNN computation.\nHowever, they cannot be directly combined because Winograd transformation fills\nin the sparsity resulting from pruning. Li et al. (2017) propose sparse\nWinograd convolution in which weights are directly pruned in the Winograd\ndomain, but this technique is not very practical because Winograd-domain\nretraining requires low learning rates and hence significantly longer training\ntime. Besides, Liu et al. (2018) move the ReLU function into the Winograd\ndomain, which can help increase the weight sparsity but requires changes in the\nnetwork structure. To achieve a high Winograd-domain weight sparsity without\nchanging network structures, we propose a new pruning method, spatial-Winograd\npruning. As the first step, spatial-domain weights are pruned in a structured\nway, which efficiently transfers the spatial-domain sparsity into the Winograd\ndomain and avoids Winograd-domain retraining.

High precision\nscanning of the lighter $h^0$ and the higher mass $H^0$ and $A^0$ is thus\npossible with a muon collider.
