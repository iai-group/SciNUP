Interest in this\nproblem stems from its relationship to the non-linear stability of the black\nhole spacetimes themselves as solutions to the Einstein equations, one of the\ncentral open problems of general relativity. After an introductory discussion\nof the Schwarzschild geometry and the black hole concept, the classical theorem\nof Kay and Wald on the boundedness of scalar waves on the exterior region of\nSchwarzschild is reviewed. The original proof is presented, followed by a new\nmore robust proof of a stronger boundedness statement. The problem of decay of\nscalar waves on Schwarzschild is then addressed, and a theorem proving\nquantitative decay is stated and its proof sketched. This decay statement is\ncarefully contrasted with the type of statements derived heuristically in the\nphysics literature for the asymptotic tails of individual spherical harmonics.\nFollowing this, our recent proof of the boundedness of solutions to the wave\nequation on axisymmetric stationary backgrounds (including slowly-rotating Kerr\nand Kerr-Newman) is reviewed and a new decay result for slowly-rotating Kerr\nspacetimes is stated and proved.

In a seemingly\nunrelated research direction, Dziuk [Lect Notes in Math, vol 1357 (1988)]\nanalyzed a class of nodal finite elements for the Laplace-Beltrami equation on\nsmooth 2-surfaces approximated by a piecewise-linear triangulation; Demlow\nlater extended this analysis [SIAM J Numer Anal, 47 (2009)] to 3-surfaces, as\nwell as to higher-order surface approximation. In this article, we bring these\nlines of research together, first developing a framework for the analysis of\nvariational crimes in abstract Hilbert complexes, and then applying this\nabstract framework to the setting of finite element exterior calculus on\nhypersurfaces. Our framework extends the work of Arnold, Falk, and Winther to\nproblems that violate their subcomplex assumption, allowing for the extension\nof finite element exterior calculus to approximate domains, most notably the\nHodge-de Rham complex on approximate manifolds. As an application of the\nlatter, we recover Dziuk's and Demlow's a priori estimates for 2- and\n3-surfaces, demonstrating that surface finite element methods can be analyzed\ncompletely within this abstract framework. Moreover, our results generalize\nthese earlier estimates dramatically, extending them from nodal finite elements\nfor Laplace-Beltrami to mixed finite elements for the Hodge Laplacian, and from\n2- and 3-dimensional hypersurfaces to those of arbitrary dimension. By\ndeveloping this analytical framework using a combination of general tools from\ndifferential geometry and functional analysis, we are led to a more geometric\nanalysis of surface finite element methods, whereby the main results become\nmore transparent. \n\n"}

{"id": "1010.6184", "contents": "Title: Regularizations of general singular integral operators Abstract: In the theory of singular integral operators significant effort is often\nrequired to rigorously define such an operator. This is due to the fact that\nthe kernels of such operators are not locally integrable on the diagonal, so\nthe integral formally defining the operator or its bilinear form is not well\ndefined (the integrand is not in L^1) even for nice functions. However, since\nthe kernel only has singularities on the diagonal, the bilinear form is well\ndefined say for bounded compactly supported functions with separated supports.\n  One of the standard ways to interpret the boundedness of a singular integral\noperators is to consider regularized kernels, where the cut-off function is\nzero in a neighborhood of the origin, so the corresponding regularized\noperators with kernel are well defined (at least on a dense set). Then one can\nask about uniform boundedness of the regularized operators. For the standard\nregularizations one usually considers truncated operators.\n  The main result of the paper is that for a wide class of singular integral\noperators (including the classical Calderon-Zygmund operators in\nnon-homogeneous two weight settings), the L^p boundedness of the bilinear form\non the compactly supported functions with separated supports (the so-called\nrestricted L^p boundedness) implies the uniform L^p-boundedness of regularized\noperators for any reasonable choice of a smooth cut-off of the kernel. If the\nkernel satisfies some additional assumptions (which are satisfied for classical\nsingular integral operators like Hilbert Transform, Cauchy Transform,\nAhlfors--Beurling Transform, Generalized Riesz Transforms), then the restricted\nL^p boundedness also implies the uniform L^p boundedness of the classical\ntruncated operators. \n\n"}

After\nreviewing some foundational material on canonical relations and this category,\nwe show that symplectic hopfoids provide a characterization of symplectic\ndouble groupoids in these terms. Then, we show how such structures may be used\nto produce examples of symplectic orbifolds, and conjecture that all symplectic\norbifolds arise via a similar construction. The symplectic structures on the\norbifolds produced arise naturally from the use of canonical relations. The\ncharacterization of symplectic double groupoids mentioned above is made\npossible by an observation which provides various ways of realizing the core of\na symplectic double groupoid as a symplectic quotient of the total space, and\nincludes as a special case a result of Zakrzewski concerning Hopf algebra\nobjects in the symplectic category.

When $Y$ is a symplectic manifold\n(resp. a Calabi-Yau manifold; a $7$-manifold with $G_2$-holonomy; a manifold\nwith an almost complex structure $J$), the corresponding notion of Lagrangian\nmaps (resp. special Lagrangian maps; associative maps, coassociative maps;\n$J$-holomorphic maps) are introduced. Indicative examples linking to symplectic\ngeometry and string theory are given.

The evolution of a\ndynamical system is geometrized by introducing a non-linear connection, which\nallows the construction of the KCC covariant derivative, and of the deviation\ncurvature tensor. In the KCC theory the properties of any dynamical system are\ndescribed in terms of five geometrical invariants, with the second one giving\nthe Jacobi stability of the system.

This core\ntrainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding\ndecoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture\nof the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional\nlayers in the VGG16 network. The role of the decoder network is to map the low\nresolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for\npixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which\nthe decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically,\nthe decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the\ncorresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the\nneed for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then\nconvolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps.

In this paper we investigate conditions under which\nevolving a smooth rotationally symmetric sphere by a linear combination of its\nradii of curvature yields a Hopf sphere. When the coefficients of the flow have\ncertain integer values, the fate of an initial sphere is entirely determined by\nthe local geometry of its isolated umbilic points. A surprising variety of\nbehaviours is uncovered: convergence to round spheres and non-round Hopf\nspheres, as well as divergence to infinity.\n  The critical quantity is the rate of vanishing of the astigmatism - the\ndifference of the radii of curvature - at the isolated umbilic points. It is\nproven that the size of this quantity versus the coefficient in the flow\nfunction determines the fate of the evolution.\n  The geometric setting for the equation is Radius of Curvature space, viewed\nas a pair of hyperbolic/AdS half-planes joined along their boundary, the\numbilic horizon. A rotationally symmetric sphere determines a parameterized\ncurve in this plane with end-points on the umbilic horizon. The slope of the\ncurve at the umbilic horizon is linked by the Codazzi-Mainardi equations to the\nrate of vanishing of astigmatism, and for generic initial conditions can be\nused to determine the outcome of the flow.\n  The slope can jump during the flow, and a number of examples are given:\ninstant jumps of the initial slope, as well as umbilic circles that contract to\npoints in finite time and 'pop' the slope. Finally, we present soliton-like\nsolutions: curves that evolve under linear flows by mutual hyperbolic/AdS\nisometries (dilation and translation) of Radius of Curvature space.
