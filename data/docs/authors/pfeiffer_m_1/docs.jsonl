The quadratic nonlinearity is\nassumed to come from poling of the polymer, which in this study is chosen to be\nthe cyclic olefin copolymer Topas. We found a very large phase mismatch between\nthe pump and the second-harmonic waves. Therefore the potential for cascaded\nquadratic second-harmonic generation is investigated in particular for soliton\ncompression of fs pulses. We found that excitation of temporal solitons from\ncascaded quadratic nonlinearities requires an effective quadratic nonlinearity\nof 5 pm/V or more. This might be reduced if a polymer with a low Kerr nonlinear\nrefractive index is used. We also found that the group-velocity mismatch could\nbe minimized if the design parameters of the microstructured fiber are chosen\nso the relative hole size is large and the hole pitch is on the order of the\npump wavelength. Almost all design-parameter combinations resulted in cascaded\neffects in the stationary regime, where efficient and clean soliton compression\ncan be found.

In\ncontrasting this behaviour with that produced by a momentum-dependent\ninteraction, one achieves comparisons which highlight that elastic scattering\nand resonance electroproduction experiments probe the infrared evolution of\nQCD's running masses; e.g., the existence, and location if so, of a zero in the\nratio of nucleon Sachs form factors are strongly influenced by the running of\nthe dressed-quark mass. In our description of baryons, diquark correlations are\nimportant.

We argue that the low energy relations representing the\nquantum anomalies of QCD are saturated by coherent low dimensional vacuum\nconfigurations as observed in Monte Carlo lattice studies. The thermal spectrum\nand approximate universality of the temperature with no dependence on energy of\ncolliding particles in this framework is due to the fact that the emission\nresults from the distortion of these low dimensional vacuum sheets rather than\nfrom the colliding particles themselves. The emergence of the long- range\ncorrelations of P odd domains (a feature which is apparently required for\nexplanation of the asymmetry observed at RHIC and LHC) is also a result of the\nsame distortion of the QCD vacuum configurations.

A primary objective is to generalize the Manakov\nequations, well known in the case of single-mode fibers. We first investigate a\nreference case where linear coupling among the spatial modes of the fiber is\nweak and after averaging over birefringence fluctuations, we obtain new Manakov\nequations for multimode fibers. Such an averaging reduces the number of\nintermodal nonlinear terms drastically since all four-wave-mixing terms average\nout. Cross-phase modulation terms still affect multimode transmission but their\neffectiveness is reduced. We then verify the accuracy of our new Manakov\nequations by transmitting multiple PDM-QPSK signals over different modes of a\nmultimode fiber and comparing the numerical results with those obtained by\nsolving the full stochastic equation. The agreement is excellent in all cases\nstudied. A great benefit of the new equations is to reduce the computation time\nby a factor of 10 or more. Another important feature observed is that\nbirefringence fluctuations improve system performance by reducing the impact of\nfiber nonlinearities. Finally multimode fibers with strong random coupling\namong all spatial modes are considered. Linear coupling is modeled using the\nrandom matrix theory approach. We derive new Manakov equations for multimode\nfibers in that regime and show that such fibers can perform better than\nsingle-modes fiber for large number of propagating spatial modes. \n\n"}

The correlations\nare measured over two units of pseudorapidity and full azimuthal angle in\ndifferent intervals of event multiplicity, and expressed as associated yield\nper trigger particle. Two long-range ridge-like structures, one on the near\nside and one on the away side, are observed when the per-trigger yield obtained\nin low-multiplicity events is subtracted from the one in high-multiplicity\nevents. The excess on the near-side is qualitatively similar to that recently\nreported by the CMS collaboration, while the excess on the away-side is\nreported for the first time. The two-ridge structure projected onto azimuthal\nangle is quantified with the second and third Fourier coefficients as well as\nby near-side and away-side yields and widths.

The effects of the electromagnetic\nfield-(pseudo)scalar axion field interaction and of the self-interaction of the\nelectromagnetic field mediated by virtual electron-positron pairs in the\neffective Lagrangian approach are included. First, we show that if the strong\nfield is circularly polarized, contrary to the leading-order nonlinear QED\neffects, the axion-photon interaction induces a chiral-like birefringence and a\ndichroism in the vacuum. The latter effect is explained by evoking the\nconservation of the total angular momentum along the common propagation\ndirection of probe and the strong wave, which allows for real axion production\nonly for probe and strong fields with the same helicity. Moreover, in the case\nof ultra-short strong pulses, it is shown that the absorption coefficients of\nprobe photons depend on the form of the pulse and, in particular, on the\ncarrier-envelope phase of the strong beam.

The coupled mode\ntheory model addresses the effect of two-photon absorption and free-carrier\nabsorption on parametric gain and oscillation thresholds, and ultimately on the\noptimum design for an OPO. The model goes beyond a typical free-space cavity\nconfiguration by incorporating a full modal analysis that admits distributed\nmodes with non-uniform field distribution, relevant to photonic microcavity\nsystems on chip. This leads to a generalization of the concept of nonlinear\nfigure of merit (NFOM) to a vector of coefficients.

One major challenge in FGVC is\nthe co-occurrence of two issues: 1) many subordinate classes are highly\ncorrelated and are difficult to distinguish, and 2) there exists the large\nintra-class variation (e.g., due to object pose). This paper proposes to\nexplicitly address the above two issues via distance metric learning (DML). DML\naddresses the first issue by learning an embedding so that data points from the\nsame class will be pulled together while those from different classes should be\npushed apart from each other; and it addresses the second issue by allowing the\nflexibility that only a portion of the neighbors (not all data points) from the\nsame class need to be pulled together. However, feature representation of an\nimage is often high dimensional, and DML is known to have difficulty in dealing\nwith high dimensional feature vectors since it would require $\\mathcal{O}(d^2)$\nfor storage and $\\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ for optimization. To this end, we proposed a\nmulti-stage metric learning framework that divides the large-scale high\ndimensional learning problem to a series of simple subproblems, achieving\n$\\mathcal{O}(d)$ computational complexity. The empirical study with FVGC\nbenchmark datasets verifies that our method is both effective and efficient\ncompared to the state-of-the-art FGVC approaches. \n\n"}

Large and regular glitches observed in the\nVela pulsar have originally constrained the fraction of the stellar moment of\ninertia that must reside in the solid crust to about 1.4%. However, crustal\nentrainment-which until very recently has been ignored-suggests that in order\nto account for the Vela glitches, the fraction of the moment of inertia\nresiding in the crust must increase to about 7%. This indicates that the\nrequired angular momentum reservoir may exceed that which is available in the\ncrust. We explore the possibility that uncertainties in the equation of state\nprovide enough flexibility for the construction of models that predict a large\ncrustal thickness and consequently a large crustal moment of inertia. Given\nthat analytic results suggest that the crustal moment of inertia is sensitive\nto the transition pressure at the crust-core interface, we tune the parameters\nof the model to maximize the transition pressure, while still providing an\nexcellent description of nuclear observables. In this manner we are able to\nobtain fractional moments of inertia as large as 7% for neutron stars with\nmasses below 1.6 solar masses. In particular, we find that if the neutron-skin\nthickness of 208Pb falls within the (0.20-0.26) fm range, large enough\ntransition pressures can be generated to explain the large Vela glitches\nwithout invoking an additional angular-momentum reservoir beyond that confined\nto the solid crust.

However, all current models of high-level human vision\noperate on hand annotated images in which the objects and actions have been\nassigned semantic tags by a human operator. No current models can account for\nhigh-level visual function directly in terms of low-level visual input (i.e.,\npixels). To overcome this fundamental limitation we sought to develop a new\nclass of models that can predict human brain activity directly from low-level\nvisual input (i.e., pixels). We explored two classes of models drawn from\ncomputer vision and machine learning. The first class of models was based on\nFisher Vectors (FV) and the second was based on Convolutional Neural Networks\n(ConvNets). We find that both classes of models accurately predict brain\nactivity in high-level visual areas, directly from pixels and without the need\nfor any semantic tags or hand annotation of images.

Among the different approaches to generate and manipulate\norbital angular momentum states of light, coupling between spin and orbital\nangular momentum allows a faster manipulation of orbital angular momentum\nstates because it depends on manipulating the polarisation state of light,\nwhich is simpler and generally faster than manipulating conventional orbital\nangular momentum generators. In this work, we design and fabricate an\nultra-thin spin-to-orbital angular momentum converter, based on plasmonic\nnano-antennas and operating in the visible wavelength range that is capable of\nconverting spin to an arbitrary value of OAM $\\ell$.

In particular, ultrafast twin- beam\ngeneration via pulsed parametric down-conversion (PDC) and four-wave mixing\n(FWM) is only possible in short crystals or fibres or in double-path schemes.\nHere we show that in high-gain PDC, one can overcome the destructive role of\nboth effects and even turn them into useful tools for shaping the emission.

Unlike\nwhen back-propagation is applied to a recurrent network, application to an FFN\namounts to multiplying the error gradient by a different random matrix at each\nlayer. We show that the successive application of correctly scaled random\nmatrices to an initial vector results in a random walk of the log of the norm\nof the resulting vectors, and we compute the scaling that makes this walk\nunbiased. The variance of the random walk grows only linearly with network\ndepth and is inversely proportional to the size of each layer.

However, the representations constructed by\ncontemporary generative models are usually point-wise deterministic mappings\nfrom the original feature space.

This core\ntrainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding\ndecoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture\nof the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional\nlayers in the VGG16 network. The role of the decoder network is to map the low\nresolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for\npixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which\nthe decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically,\nthe decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the\ncorresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the\nneed for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then\nconvolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps.

As a first example, we consider the jet\nfragmentation function, where a hadron $h$ is identified inside a fully\nreconstructed jet. We introduce a new semi-inclusive fragmenting jet function\n${\\mathcal G}^h_i(z= \\omega_J/\\omega,z_h=\\omega_h/\\omega_J,\\omega_J, R,\\mu)$,\nwhich depends on the jet radius $R$ and the large light-cone momenta of the\nparton `$i$' initiating the jet ($\\omega$), the jet ($\\omega_J$), and the\nhadron $h$ ($\\omega_h$). The jet fragmentation function can then be expressed\nas a semi-inclusive observable, in the spirit of actual experimental\nmeasurements, rather than as an exclusive one. We demonstrate the consistency\nof the effective field theory treatment and standard perturbative QCD\ncalculations of this observable at next-to-leading order (NLO). The\nrenormalization group (RG) equation for the semi-inclusive fragmenting jet\nfunction ${\\mathcal G}_i^h(z,z_h, \\omega_J, R,\\mu)$ are also derived and shown\nto follow exactly the usual timelike DGLAP evolution equations for\nfragmentation functions.

A key parameter of their dynamics is the\neffective-detuning of the pump laser to the thermally- and Kerr-shifted cavity\nresonance. Together with the free spectral range and dispersion, it governs the\nsoliton-pulse duration, as predicted by an approximate analytical solution of\nthe Lugiato-Lefever equation. Yet, a precise experimental verification of this\nrelation was lacking so far. Here, by measuring and controlling the\neffective-detuning, we establish a new way of stabilizing solitons in\nmicroresonators and demonstrate that the measured relation linking soliton\nwidth and detuning deviates by less than 1 % from the approximate expression,\nvalidating its excellent predictive power. Furthermore, a detuning-dependent\nenhancement of specific comb lines is revealed, due to linear couplings between\nmode-families. They cause deviations from the predicted comb power evolution,\nand induce a detuning-dependent soliton recoil that modifies the pulse\nrepetition-rate, explaining its unexpected dependence on laser-detuning.\nFinally, we observe that detuning-dependent mode-crossings can destabilize the\nsoliton, leading to an unpredicted soliton breathing regime (oscillations of\nthe pulse) that occurs in a normally-stable regime.

Soliton-based data\ntransmission schemes were investigated in the 1980s, promising to overcome the\nlimitations imposed by dispersion of optical fibers. These approaches, however,\nwere eventually abandoned in favor of wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)\nschemes that are easier to implement and offer improved scalability to higher\ndata rates. Here, we show that solitons may experience a comeback in optical\ncommunications, this time not as a competitor, but as a key element of\nmassively parallel WDM. Instead of encoding data on the soliton itself, we\nexploit continuously circulating dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS) in a\nmicroresonator. DKS are generated in an integrated silicon nitride\nmicroresonator by four-photon interactions mediated by Kerr nonlinearity,\nleading to low-noise, spectrally smooth and broadband optical frequency combs.\nIn our experiments, we use two interleaved soliton Kerr combs to transmit a\ndata stream of more than 50Tbit/s on a total of 179 individual optical carriers\nthat span the entire telecommunication C and L bands. Equally important, we\ndemonstrate coherent detection of a WDM data stream by using a pair of\nmicroresonator Kerr soliton combs - one as a multi-wavelength light source at\nthe transmitter, and another one as a corresponding local oscillator (LO) at\nthe receiver. This approach exploits the scalability advantages of\nmicroresonator soliton comb sources for massively parallel optical\ncommunications both at the transmitter and receiver side. Taken together, the\nresults prove the significant potential of these sources to replace arrays of\ncontinuous-wave lasers in high-speed communications. \n\n"}

Implications of p+Pb measurements of the chiral\n  magnetic effect in heavy ion collisions Abstract: The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a fundamental prediction of QCD, and\nvarious observables have been proposed in heavy ion collisions to access this\nphysics. Recently the CMS Collaboration \\cite{Khachatryan:2016got} has reported\nresults from p+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV on one such observable, the\nthree-point correlator. The results are strikingly similar to those measured at\nthe same particle multiplicity in Pb+Pb collisions, which have been attributed\nto the CME. This similarity, combined with two key assumptions about the\nmagnetic field in p+Pb collisions, presents a major challenge to the CME\npicture. These two assumptions as stated in the CMS paper are (1) that the\nmagnetic field in p+Pb collisions is smaller than that in Pb+Pb collisions and\n(2) that the magnetic field direction is uncorrelated with the flow angle. We\ntest these two postulates in the Monte Carlo Glauber framework and find that\nthe magnetic fields are not significantly smaller in central p+Pb collisions,\nhowever the magnetic field direction and the flow angle are indeed\nuncorrelated.

However,\nstably accessing such states is complicated by thermo-optic dispersion. For\nexample, in the Si3N4 platform, precisely dispersion-engineered structures can\nsupport broadband operation, but microsecond thermal time constants have\nnecessitated fast pump power or frequency control to stabilize the solitons. In\ncontrast, here we consider how broadband soliton states can be accessed with\nsimple pump laser frequency tuning, at a rate much slower than the thermal\ndynamics. We demonstrate octave-spanning soliton frequency combs in Si3N4\nmicroresonators, including the generation of a multi-soliton state with a pump\npower near 40 mW and a single-soliton state with a pump power near 120 mW. We\nalso develop a simplified two-step analysis to explain how these states are\naccessed in a thermally stable way without fast control of the pump laser, and\noutline the required thermal properties for such operation. Our model agrees\nwith experimental results as well as numerical simulations based on a\nLugiato-Lefever equation that incorporates thermo-optic dispersion. Moreover,\nit also explains an experimental observation that a member of an adjacent mode\nfamily on the red-detuned side of the pump mode can mitigate the thermal\nrequirements for accessing soliton states. \n\n"}

In this paper, we\ndevelop a systematic way to incorporate the decision maker's preference\ninformation into the decomposition-based evolutionary multi-objective\noptimization methods. Generally speaking, our basic idea is a non-uniform\nmapping scheme by which the originally uniformly distributed reference points\non a canonical simplex can be mapped to the new positions close to the\naspiration level vector specified by the decision maker. By these means, we are\nable to steer the search process towards the region of interest either directly\nor in an interactive manner and also handle a large number of objectives.

The recent\nobservation of Kerr frequency combs operating in the dissipative Kerr soliton\n(DKS) regime, along with dispersive wave formation, has provided the means for\nfully coherent, broadband Kerr frequency comb generation with engineered\nspectral envelope. Here, by carefully optimizing the photonic Damascene\nfabrication process, and dispersion engineering of $\\mathrm{Si_{3}N_{4}}$\nmicroresonators with $1\\,\\mathrm{THz}$ free spectral range, we achieve\nbandwidths exceeding one octave at low powers ($\\mathcal{O}(100\\,\\mathrm{mW})$)\nfor pump lasers residing in the telecom C-band ($1.55\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$), as\nwell as for the first time in the O-band ($1.3\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$). Equally\nimportant, we find that for THz repetition rate comb states, conventional\ncriteria applied to identify DKS comb states fail. Investigating the coherence\nof generated, octave-spanning Kerr comb states we unambiguously identify DKS\nstates using a response measurement. This allows to demonstrate octave-spanning\nDKS comb states at both pump laser wavelengths of $1.3\\mathrm{\\,\\mu m}$ and\n$1.55\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ including the broadest DKS state generated to date,\nspanning more than $200\\,\\mathrm{THz}$ of optical bandwidth.

A\ncompletely satisfactory explanation for their success remains elusive. Here, we\npresent a novel explanation for the benefits of skip connections in training\nvery deep networks. The difficulty of training deep networks is partly due to\nthe singularities caused by the non-identifiability of the model. Several such\nsingularities have been identified in previous works: (i) overlap singularities\ncaused by the permutation symmetry of nodes in a given layer, (ii) elimination\nsingularities corresponding to the elimination, i.e. consistent deactivation,\nof nodes, (iii) singularities generated by the linear dependence of the nodes.\nThese singularities cause degenerate manifolds in the loss landscape that slow\ndown learning. We argue that skip connections eliminate these singularities by\nbreaking the permutation symmetry of nodes, by reducing the possibility of node\nelimination and by making the nodes less linearly dependent. Moreover, for\ntypical initializations, skip connections move the network away from the\n\"ghosts\" of these singularities and sculpt the landscape around them to\nalleviate the learning slow-down.

It is\nthus desirable to learn off-policy without using the ratios. However, such an\nalgorithm does not exist for multi-step learning with function approximation.\nIn this paper, we introduce the first such algorithm based on\ntemporal-difference (TD) learning updates.

This paper contributes to a development of robust stochastic\nconfiguration networks (RSCNs) for resolving uncertain data regression\nproblems.

However,\ntraining DNNs requires massive amounts of data and is very computationally\nintensive.

We analyze the dynamics of SGD and\nshow that, indeed, direct computation of the solutions is possible in many\ncases. We show that a high performing setup used in DNNs introduces a\nseparation of time-scales in the training dynamics, allowing SGD to train\nlayers from the lowest (closest to input) to the highest. We then show that for\neach layer, the distribution of solutions found by SGD can be estimated using a\nclass-based principal component analysis (PCA) of the layer's input.

On a fundamental level,\nit enables the study of soliton physics in driven nonlinear cavities.\nMicroresonators are commonly multimode and, as a result, inter-mode\ninteractions inherently occur among mode families - a condition referred to as\n\"avoided mode crossings\". Avoided mode crossings can cause soliton decay, but\ncan also modify the soliton spectrum, leading to e.g. the formation of\ndispersive wave and inducing a spectral recoil. Yet, to date, the entailing\ntemporal soliton dynamics from inter-mode interactions has rarely been studied,\nbut is critical to understand regimes of soliton-stability. Here we report the\ndiscovery of an inter-mode breather soliton. Such breathing dynamics occurs\nwithin a laser detuning range where conventionally stationary dissipative\nsolitons are expected.

We prove\nthat non-trivial levels of purity are required for multilevel coherence, as\nthere is a ball of states around the maximally mixed state that do not exhibit\nmultilevel coherence in any basis. We provide a simple necessary and sufficient\nanalytical criterion to verify multilevel coherence, which leads to a complete\nclassification for three-level systems. We present the robustness of multilevel\ncoherence, a bona fide quantifier which we show to be numerically computable\nvia semidefinite programming and experimentally accessible via multilevel\ncoherence witnesses. We further verify and lower-bound the robustness of\nmultilevel coherence by performing a semi-device-independent phase\ndiscrimination task, implemented experimentally with four-level probes in a\nphotonic setup. Our results contribute to understanding the operational\nrelevance of genuine multilevel coherence, also by demonstrating the key role\nit plays in enhanced phase discrimination---a primitive for quantum\ncommunication and metrology---and suggest new ways to reliably test the quantum\nbehaviour of physical systems. \n\n"}

In this fashion, the intra-cavity photon\nnumber is increased and thereby the cooling rate is enhanced and the strong\ncoupling regime is achieved without resorting to increased driving laser power.\nThe underlying physics of the increased cooling efficiency in the here-proposed\nsystem of coupled cavities in the resolved sideband regime and that of the\nalready reported system of coupled cavities in the unresolved sideband regime\nare significantly different from each other. Since the spectral density of the\ndisplacement of the particle can no longer be accurately approximated by the\nconventional Lorentzian lineshape in the strong coupling regime, a double\nLorentzian lineshape is employed to accurately approximate the spectral density\nof the displacement of the particle and to provide analytical formulations for\nthe cooling rate.

The energy function is then modified so the\nmodel and data distributions match, with no guarantee on the number of steps\nrequired for the Markov chain to converge. Moreover, the detailed balance\ncondition is highly restrictive: energy based models corresponding to neural\nnetworks must have symmetric weights, unlike biological neural circuits. In\ncontrast, we develop a method for directly learning arbitrarily parameterized\ntransition operators capable of expressing non-equilibrium stationary\ndistributions that violate detailed balance, thereby enabling us to learn more\nbiologically plausible asymmetric neural networks and more general non-energy\nbased dynamical systems. The proposed training objective, which we derive via\nprincipled variational methods, encourages the transition operator to \"walk\nback\" in multi-step trajectories that start at data-points, as quickly as\npossible back to the original data points.

To find functional forms\nthat will allow for a robust extraction of the input radius for a wide variety\nof functional forms in order to have confidence in the extraction from upcoming\nlow $Q^2$ experimental data such as the Jefferson Lab PRad experiment, we\ncreate a general framework for inputting form-factor functions as well as\nvarious fitting functions. The input form factors are used to generate\npseudo-data with fluctuations intended to mimic the binning and random\nuncertainty of a given set of real data. All combinations of input functions\nand fit functions can then be tested repeatedly against regenerated\npseudo-data. Since the input radius is known, this allows us to find fit\nfunctions that are robust for radius extractions in an objective fashion.

A systematic study of the beam energy dependence is performed for Au+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =2.3 - 62.4$ GeV. The transition of the dynamical\norigin of the directed flow is observed. We find that the initial Glauber type\nnucleon-nucleon collisions generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons at midrapidity\ndue to the presence of spectator matter, and this negative nucleon $v_1$ is\nturned to be positive by the meson-baryon interactions at the beam energy\nregion of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} < 30$ GeV.

We do so by merging 2D\nvisual cues, 3D object dimensions, and ground plane constraints to produce\nboxes that are robust against small errors and incorrect predictions. First, we\ntrain a single-shot convolutional neural network (CNN) that produces multiple\nvisual and geometric cues of interest: 2D bounding boxes, 2D keypoints of\ninterest, coarse object orientations and object dimensions. Subsets of these\ncues are then used to poll probable ground planes from a pre-computed database\nof ground planes, to identify the \"best fit\" plane with highest consensus. Once\nidentified, the \"best fit\" plane provides enough constraints to successfully\nconstruct the desired 3D detection box, without directly predicting the 6DoF\npose of the object. The entire ground plane polling (GPP) procedure is\nconstructed as a non-parametrized layer of the CNN that outputs the desired\n\"best fit\" plane and the corresponding 3D keypoints, which together define the\nfinal 3D bounding box.

Among many possibilities, Mean Average Precision(mAP) has emerged as\nthe dominant performance metric for hashing-based retrieval. One glaring\nshortcoming of mAP is its inability in balancing retrieval accuracy and\nutilization of hash codes: pushing a system to attain higher mAP will\ninevitably lead to poorer utilization of the hash codes. Poor utilization of\nthe hash codes hinders good retrieval because of increased collision of samples\nin the hash space. This means that a model giving a higher mAP values does not\nnecessarily do a better job in retrieval.

The compression\nrates of 18x for ResNet18 and 17x for ResNet50, and 9x for MobileNet-v2 are\nobtained when SQuantizing both weights and activations within 1% and 2% loss in\naccuracy for ResNets and MobileNet-v2 respectively. An extension of these\ntechniques to object detection also demonstrates high accuracy on YOLO-v3.\nAdditionally, our method allows for fast single pass training, which is\nimportant for rapid prototyping and neural architecture search techniques.\nFinally extensive results from this simultaneous training approach allows us to\ndraw some useful insights into the relative merits of sparsity and\nquantization. \n\n"}

In this paper we introduce\na new skeleton-based representation for 3D action recognition in videos. The\nkey idea of the proposed representation is to transform 3D joint coordinates of\nthe human body carried in skeleton sequences into RGB images via a color\nencoding process. By normalizing the 3D joint coordinates and dividing each\nskeleton frame into five parts, where the joints are concatenated according to\nthe order of their physical connections, the color-coded representation is able\nto represent spatio-temporal evolutions of complex 3D motions, independently of\nthe length of each sequence.

The core module of a\nMANN is called a controller, which is usually implemented as a recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN) (e.g., LSTM) to enable the use of contextual information in\ncontrolling the other modules.

This lack of understanding is linked to a lack of learning\nalgorithms for recurrent networks of spiking neurons (RSNNs) that are both\nfunctionally powerful and can be implemented by known biological mechanisms.\nSince RSNNs are simultaneously a primary target for implementations of\nbrain-inspired circuits in neuromorphic hardware, this lack of algorithmic\ninsight also hinders technological progress in that area. The gold standard for\nlearning in recurrent neural networks in machine learning is back-propagation\nthrough time (BPTT), which implements stochastic gradient descent with regard\nto a given loss function. But BPTT is unrealistic from a biological\nperspective, since it requires a transmission of error signals backwards in\ntime and in space, i.e., from post- to presynaptic neurons. We show that an\nonline merging of locally available information during a computation with\nsuitable top-down learning signals in real-time provides highly capable\napproximations to BPTT. For tasks where information on errors arises only late\nduring a network computation, we enrich locally available information through\nfeedforward eligibility traces of synapses that can easily be computed in an\nonline manner. The resulting new generation of learning algorithms for\nrecurrent neural networks provides a new understanding of network learning in\nthe brain that can be tested experimentally. In addition, these algorithms\nprovide efficient methods for on-chip training of RSNNs in neuromorphic\nhardware. \n\n"}

By studying these fluctuations as a\nfunction of varying control parameters, it is possible to learn much about the\nphase diagram of QCD. As a timely example, we stress the methods by which\npresent experiments at the CERN SPS can locate the second-order critical\nendpoint of the first-order transition between quark-gluon plasma and hadron\nmatter. Those event-by-event signatures which are characteristic of freeze-out\nin the vicinity of the critical point will exhibit nonmonotonic dependence on\ncontrol parameters. We focus on observables constructed from the multiplicity\nand transverse momenta of charged pions. We first consider how the\nevent-by-event fluctuations of such observables are affected by Bose-Einstein\ncorrelations, by resonances which decay after freeze-out and by fluctuations in\nthe transverse flow velocity. We compare our thermodynamic predictions for such\nnoncritical event-by-event fluctuations with NA49 data, finding broad\nagreement. We then focus on effects due to thermal contact between the observed\npions and a heat bath with a given (possibly singular) specific heat, and due\nto the direct coupling between the critical fluctuations of the sigma field and\nthe observed pions. We also discuss the effect of the pions produced in the\ndecay of sigma particles just above threshold after freeze-out on the inclusive\npion spectrum and on multiplicity fluctuations.

In\ncontrast, such high $p_t$ jets are not suppressed in d+Au collisions suggesting\nthat the high $p_t$ suppression is not due to initial state effects in the\nultrarelativistic colliding nuclei. \n\n"}

Contrary to what is\nwidely assumed, the density of excited emitters and the intensity in an\nemission decay curve are not proportional, but the density is a time-integral\nof the intensity. The integral relation is crucial to correctly interpret\nnon-single-exponential decay. We derive the proper normalization for both a\ndiscrete, and a continuous distribution of rates, where every decay component\nis multiplied with its radiative decay rate. A central result of our paper is\nthe derivation of the emission decay curve in case that both radiative and\nnon-radiative decays are independently distributed. In this case, the\nwell-known emission quantum efficiency can not be expressed by a single number\nanymore, but it is also distributed. We derive a practical description of\nnon-single-exponential emission decay curves in terms of a single distribution\nof decay rates; the resulting distribution is identified as the distribution of\ntotal decay rates weighted with the radiative rates. We apply our analysis to\nrecent examples of colloidal quantum dot emission in suspensions and in\nphotonic crystals, and we find that this important class of emitters is well\ndescribed by a log-normal distribution of decay rates with a narrow and a broad\ndistribution, respectively. Finally, we briefly discuss the Kohlrausch\nstretched-exponential model, and find that its normalization is ill-defined for\nemitters with a realistic quantum efficiency of less than 100 %. \n\n"}
