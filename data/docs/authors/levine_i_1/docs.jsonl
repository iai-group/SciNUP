To further check against\npossible instrumental artifacts several upgrades to the PVLAS apparatus have\nbeen made during the last year. Two data taking runs, at the wavelength of 1064\nnm, have been performed in the new configuration with magnetic field strengths\nof 2.3 T and 5 T. The 2.3 T field value was chosen in order to avoid stray\nfields. The new observations do not show the presence of a rotation signal down\nto the levels of $1.2\\cdot 10^{-8}$ rad at 5 T and $1.0\\cdot 10^{-8}$ rad at\n2.3 T (at 95% c.l.) with 45000 passes in the magnetic field zone. In the same\nconditions no ellipticity signal was detected down to $1.4\\cdot 10^{-8}$ at 2.3\nT (at 95% c.l.), whereas at 5 T a signal is still present.

Measurements have\ncontinued with only a few brief interruptions since that time. We give here the\nexperimental improvements in SAGE since its last published data summary in Dec.\n2001. Assuming the solar neutrino production rate was constant during the\nperiod of data collection, combined analysis of 168 extractions through Dec.\n2007 gives a capture rate of solar neutrinos with energy more than 233 keV of\n65.4 (+3.1)(-3.0) (stat) (+2.6)(-2.8) (syst) SNU. The weighted average of the\nresults of all three Ga solar neutrino experiments, SAGE, Gallex, and GNO, is\nnow 66.1 +/- 3.1 SNU, where statistical and systematic uncertainties have been\ncombined in quadrature. During the recent period of data collection a new test\nof SAGE was made with a reactor-produced 37Ar neutrino source. The ratio of\nobserved to calculated rates in this experiment, combined with the measured\nrates in the three prior 51Cr neutrino-source experiments with Ga, is 0.87 +/-\n0.05. A probable explanation for this low result is that the cross section for\nneutrino capture by the two lowest-lying excited states in 71Ge has been\noverestimated.

To differentiate between these two possibilities,\nwe examine the similar B_s \\to \\rho^+ K^- decay with the same technique. It is\nfound that a large part of the uncertainties are canceled in the ratio B(B_s\n\\to \\rho^+ K^-)/B(B_s \\to \\pi^+ K^-). It is predicted to be 2.5 \\pm 0.2 in QCDF\nwhich is independent on the form factor. However if charming penguins are\nimportant, this ratio could be very different from the QCDF prediction.\nTherefore the ratio of these two branching ratios could be an interesting\nindicator of the role of charming penguins in charmless B decays. \n\n"}

The dark matter consists of at least two light states with mass ~few\nGeV and splittings ~5 keV. It is natural for the heavier states to be\ncosmologically long-lived and to make up an O(1) fraction of the dark matter.\nDirect detection rates are dominated by the exothermic reactions in which an\nexcited dark matter state down-scatters off of a nucleus, becoming a lower\nenergy state. In contrast to (endothermic) inelastic dark matter, the most\nsensitive experiments for exothermic dark matter are those with light nuclei\nand low threshold energies.

This review\nreminds the historical steps, from the pioneering Homestake detection, the\nGALLEX- SAGE captures of the first pp neutrinos and emphasizes the importance\nof the Superkamiokande and SNO detectors to demonstrate that the solar-emitted\nelectronic neutrinos are partially transformed into other neutrino flavors\nbefore reaching the Earth.

Two consequences of these models are: (i) a new kind of\nR-parity breaking interaction that protects proton stability but adds new\ncontributions to neutrinoless double beta decay and (ii) an upper bound on the\nextra gauge and parity symmetry breaking scale which is within the large hadron\ncollider (LHC) energy range.

Applying the\nPMC for the $t\\bar{t}$-pair hadroproduction at the NNLO level, we have found\nthat the total cross-sections $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$ at both the Tevatron and LHC\nremain almost unchanged when taking very disparate initial scales $\\mu^{\\rm\ninit}_R$ equal to $m_t$, $10\\,m_t$, $20\\,m_t$ and $\\sqrt{s}$, which is\nconsistent with renormalization group invariance. As an important new\napplication, we apply PMC scale-setting to study the top-quark forward-backward\nasymmetry. We observe that the more convergent perturbative series after PMC\nscale-setting leads to a more accurate top-quark forward-backward asymmetry.\nThe resulting PMC prediction on the asymmetry is also free from the initial\nrenormalization scale-dependence. Because the NLO PMC scale has a dip behavior\nfor the $(q\\bar{q})$-channel at small subprocess collision energies, the\nimportance of this channel to the asymmetry is increased.

{"id": "1210.2395", "contents": "Title: Spread Supersymmetry with Wino LSP: Gluino and Dark Matter Signals Abstract: The discovery of a Higgs boson near 125 GeV, together with the absence of LHC\nsignals for supersymmetry or direct detection signals of dark matter, motivate\nfurther study of a particular theory of split supersymmetry. In arguably the\ntheoretically simplest implementation of split, the superpartner spectrum is\nspread over several decades. The squarks and sleptons are heavier than the\ngravitino and Higgsinos by a factor M_Pl/M_*, where M_* is the mediation scale\nof supersymmetry breaking and is high, between unified and Planck scales. On\nthe other hand the gaugino masses are 1-loop smaller than the gravitino and\nHiggsino masses, arising from both anomaly mediation and a Higgsino loop. Wino\ndark matter arises from three sources: gravitino production by scattering at\nhigh temperatures, gravitino production from squark decays, and thermal\nfreeze-out. For reheating temperatures larger than the squark mass, these\nconspire to require that the squarks are lighter than about 10^4 TeV, while\ncollider limits on gaugino masses require squarks to be heavier than about 100\nTeV. Whether winos constitute all or just a fraction of the dark matter, a\nlarge fraction of the allowed parameter space has the gluino within reach of\nthe LHC with 0.1 mm < c\\tau_{\\~g} < 10 cm, leading to displaced vertices. In\naddition, events with cascades via \\~W^+- lead to disappearing charged tracks\nwith c\\tau_{\\~W^+-} \\sim 10 cm. The squarks and sleptons are predicted to be\njust heavy enough to solve the supersymmetric flavor and CP problems. Thus\ngluino decay modes may typically violate flavor and involve heavy quarks:\n[\\bar{t}(t,c,u)+\\bar{b}(b,s,d)] \\~W^0 and\n[\\bar{t}(b,s,d)+(\\bar{t},\\bar{c},\\bar{u})b] \\~W^+-.

The previously\npublished work is as follows.\n  The optimally natural Higgs-stop sector in the MSSM in light of the 2012\ndiscovery of a Higgs boson is derived, namely that of almost maximal mixing,\nwith the scalar top partners almost as light as can be. The discovery is also\ninterpreted numerically in the NMSSM, with greater emphasis placed on the\nvisibility of the Higgs boson at the observed mass, i.e. on signal strengths. I\ninvestigate the role played by the mediation scale of GMSB: this is found to be\nas a control of the extent to which Yukawa couplings de-tune flavour-blind\nrelations set by gauge couplings. Finally, issues relating to the discovery or\nexclusion of Susy at colliders are discussed. Bounds are derived for the masses\nof new particles from LHC searches for excesses of jets and missing energy\nwithout leptons, and compared to constraints arising from Higgs boson searches,\nfor models of GMSB and the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.

For a $\\bar{K}N (I=0)$ bound state without\ncouplings to other channels, we establish a relation between the radiative\ndecay width and the compositeness. Especially the radiative decay width of the\nbound state is proportional to the compositeness. Applying the formulation to\n$\\Lambda (1405)$, we observe that the decay to $\\Lambda \\gamma$ is dominated by\nthe $K^{-}p$ component inside $\\Lambda (1405)$, because in this decay $\\pi ^{+}\n\\Sigma ^{-}$ and $\\pi ^{-} \\Sigma ^{+}$ strongly cancel each other and the $\\pi\n\\Sigma$ component can contribute to the $\\Lambda \\gamma$ decay only through the\nslight isospin breaking.

This discrepancy could be the result of some new muon-specific\nforce with O(1-100) MeV force carrier---in this paper we concentrate on vector\nmediators. Such an explanation faces challenges from the constraints imposed by\nthe $g-2$ of the muon and electron as well as precision spectroscopy of muonic\natoms. In this work we complement the family of constraints by calculating the\ncontribution of hypothetical forces to the muonium hyperfine structure. We also\ncompute the two-loop contribution to the electron parity violating amplitude\ndue to a muon loop, which is sensitive to the muon axial-vector coupling.\nOverall, we find that the combination of low-energy constraints favors the mass\nof the mediator to be below 10 MeV, and that a certain degree of tuning is\nrequired between vector and axial-vector couplings of new vector particles to\nmuons in order to satisfy constraints from muon $g-2$.

We contrast predictions based on a linear pQCD and a highly non-linear\nhybrid-AdS holographic model of jet-energy loss.

A\nmeasurement of the elastic and inelastic signal will allow a single experiment\nto distinguish between a spin-independent and spin-dependent interaction. For\nthe first time, we characterise the inelastic signal for two-phase xenon\ndetectors in which dark matter inelastically scatters off the Xe-129 or Xe-131\nisotope.

We find that the expected\ncross-section fits well the observed number of excess events and that there is\ntension between the measured cross-section and the reported partial decay\nwidth. The tension is caused because for both VBF and AP the production\ncross-section and the decay width depend linearly on each other. We therefore\nexpect that if the new resonance is indeed the HCA, either its width should be\nsignificantly smaller than the reported width or the production cross-section\nshould be significantly higher than the reported one. \n\n"}

This enables a realistic comparison with experiment which allows\nus to identify and highlight basic features of measurable pion and kaon\nvalence-quark distributions. We find that whereas roughly two-thirds of the\npion's light-front momentum is carried by valence dressed-quarks at a\ncharacteristic hadronic scale, this fraction rises to 95% in the kaon; evolving\ndistributions with these features to a scale typical of available Drell-Yan\ndata produces a kaon-to-pion ratio of u-quark distributions that is in\nagreement with the single existing data set; and predict a u-quark distribution\nwithin the pion that agrees with a modern reappraisal of $\\pi N$ Drell-Yan\ndata.

As\ndeviations from the SM are generally small, we can expand the new physics\nparameters up to linear order and perform an analytical $\\chi^2$ fit to derive\nthe potential reach of the new physics scales.

In this paper, we\nconsider the possibility that a diphoton resonance is due to a composite\n(pseudo)scalar boson, whose constituents are either new hyperquarks Q or scalar\nhyperquarks tilde{Q} confined by a new hypercolor force at a confinement scale\nLambda_h. Assuming the mass m_Q (or m_{tilde Q}) >> Lambda_h, a diphoton\nresonance could be interpreted as either a Q bar{Q} state eta_Q with J^{PC} =\n0^{-+} or a tilde{Q} tilde{Q}^dagger state eta_{tilde Q} with J^{PC}=0^{++}.\nFor the Q bar{Q} scenario, there will be a spin-triplet partner psi_Q which is\nslightly heavier than eta_Q due to the hyperfine interactions mediated by\nhypercolor gluon exchange; while for the tilde{Q} tilde{Q}^dagger scenario, the\nspin-triplet partner chi_{tilde Q} arises from higher radial excitation with\nnonzero orbital angular momentum. We consider productions and decays of eta_Q,\neta_{tilde Q}, psi_Q, and chi_{tilde Q} at the LHC using the NRQCD\nfactorization approach.

This chamber is\ninstrumented with a CCD camera for near-IR bubble imaging, a solar-blind\nphotomultiplier tube to detect 175-nm xenon scintillation light, and a\npiezoelectric acoustic transducer to detect the ultrasonic emission from a\ngrowing bubble. The time of nucleation determined from the acoustic signal is\nused to correlate specific scintillation pulses with bubble-nucleating events.\nWe report on data from this chamber for thermodynamic \"Seitz\" thresholds from\n4.2 to 15.0 keV. The observed single- and multiple-bubble rates when exposed to\na $^{252}$Cf neutron source indicate that, for an 8.3-keV thermodynamic\nthreshold, the minimum nuclear recoil energy required to nucleate a bubble is\n$19\\pm6$ keV (1$\\sigma$ uncertainty). This is consistent with the observed\nscintillation spectrum for bubble-nucleating events. We see no evidence for\nbubble nucleation by gamma rays at any of the thresholds studied, setting a 90%\nC.L. upper limit of $6.3\\times10^{-7}$ bubbles per gamma interaction at a\n4.2-keV thermodynamic threshold.

We propose deep learning as a novel technique\nto analyze antihydrogen annihilation data, and compare its performance with a\ntraditional track and vertex reconstruction method. We report that the deep\nlearning approach yields significant improvement, tripling event coverage while\nsimultaneously improving performance by over 5% in terms of Area Under Curve\n(AUC). \n\n"}

In this case, the question becomes:\nwhat BSM theories are consistent with the unexpected resonance? One possibility\nwould be a spin-2 object called the colorphilic graviton--a spin-2\ncolor-singlet particle which couples exclusively to the quark and gluon\nstress-energy tensors. We assess the possibility of this state's discovery in\nthe dijet channel as an s-channel resonance, and report the regions of\nparameter space where colorphilic gravitons have not yet been excluded by\nLHC-13 data but still may be discovered in the dijet channel at LHC-14 for\nintegrated luminosities of 0.3, 1, and 3 ab$^{-1}$. We then delineate which of\nthose regions remain accessible to future collider searches, once one accounts\nfor applicability of the narrow-width approximation, detector mass resolution,\nand self-consistency according to tree-level partial-wave unitarity. We\ndiscover that--despite the strong constraints unitarity imposes on collider\nsearches--the colorphilic graviton remains potentially discoverable in the LHC\ndijet channel. A means of investigation would be to apply the color\ndiscriminant variable (CDV), a dimensionless combination of quantities\n(cross-section, decay width, and invariant mass) that can be quickly measured\nafter the discovery of a dijet resonance. Previous publications have\ndemonstrated the CDV's utility when applied to theories containing Z',\ncolorons, excited quarks, and diquarks. We extend this analysis to the\ncolorphilic graviton by applying the CDV to the appropriate region of parameter\nspace. We conclude that resolvable, discoverable dijet resonances consistent\nwith colorphilic gravitons span a narrower range of masses than those\nconsistent with leptophobic Z' models, and can be distinguished from those\noriginating from coloron, excited quark, and diquark models. \n\n"}

It consists of a 40$\\times$40 array of\nplastic scintillator bars used as a detection material. The bars are grouped in\n25 detector modules. The energy range sensitivity of POLAR is optimized to\nmatch with the prompt emission photons from the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).\nPolarization measurements of the prompt emission would probe source geometries,\nemission mechanisms and magnetic structures in GRB jets. The instrument can\nalso detect hard X-rays from solar flares and be used for precise measurement\nof their polarisation.

One involves aspects of the non-Abelian\ncharacter of Quantum Chromodynamics that are expressed in the strong running\ncoupling and generate tight, dynamical color-antitriplet quark-quark\ncorrelations in the scalar-isoscalar and pseudovector-isotriplet channels. This\nattraction is magnified by quark exchange associated with diquark breakup and\nreformation, which is required in order to ensure that each valence-quark\nparticipates in all diquark correlations to the complete extent allowed by its\nquantum numbers. Combining these effects, we arrive at a properly\nantisymmetrised Faddeev wave function for the nucleon and calculate, e.g. the\nflavor-separated versions of the Dirac and Pauli form factors and the proton's\nleading-twist parton distribution amplitude.

{"id": "1806.10962", "contents": "Title: Coherent scattering and macroscopic coherence: Implications for\n  neutrino, dark matter and axion detection Abstract: We study the question of whether coherent neutrino scattering can occur on\nmacroscopic scales, leading to a significant increase of the detection cross\nsection. We concentrate on radiative neutrino scattering on atomic electrons\n(or on free electrons in a conductor). Such processes can be coherent provided\nthat the net electron recoil momentum, i.e. the momentum transfer from the\nneutrino minus the momentum of the emitted photon, is sufficiently small. The\nradiative processes is an attractive possibility as the energy of the emitted\nphotons can be as large as the momentum transfer to the electron system and\ntherefore the problem of detecting extremely low energy recoils can be avoided.\nThe requirement of macroscopic coherence severely constrains the phase space\navailable for the scattered particle and the emitted photon. We show that in\nthe case of the scattering mediated by the usual weak neutral current and\ncharged current interactions this leads to a strong suppression of the\nelementary cross sections and therefore the requirement of macroscopic\ncoherence results in a reduction rather than an increase of the total detection\ncross section. However, for the $\\nu e$ scattering mediated by neutrino\nmagnetic or electric dipole moments coherence effects can actually increase the\ndetection rates. Effects of macroscopic coherence can also allow detection of\nneutrinos in 100 eV -- a few keV energy range, which is currently not\naccessible to the experiment. A similar coherent enhancement mechanism can work\nfor relativistic particles in the dark sector, but not for the conventionally\nconsidered non-relativistic dark matter. \n\n"}

In order to increase the energy or reduce the size of the\naccelerator, new acceleration schemes need to be developed. Plasma wakefield\nacceleration, in which the electrons in a plasma are excited, leading to strong\nelectric fields, is one such promising novel acceleration technique. Pioneering\nexperiments have shown that an intense laser pulse or electron bunch traversing\na plasma, drives electric fields of 10s GV/m and above. These values are well\nbeyond those achieved in conventional RF accelerators which are limited to ~0.1\nGV/m. A limitation of laser pulses and electron bunches is their low stored\nenergy, which motivates the use of multiple stages to reach very high energies.\nThe use of proton bunches is compelling, as they have the potential to drive\nwakefields and accelerate electrons to high energy in a single accelerating\nstage. The long proton bunches currently available can be used, as they undergo\nself-modulation, a particle-plasma interaction which longitudinally splits the\nbunch into a series of high density microbunches, which then act resonantly to\ncreate large wakefields. The AWAKE experiment at CERN uses intense bunches of\nprotons, each of energy 400 GeV, with a total bunch energy of 19 kJ, to drive a\nwakefield in a 10 m long plasma.

Abstract: In Higgs portal models of fermion dark matter, scalar couplings are\nunavoidably suppressed by strong bounds from direct detection experiments.

Small couplings and small mass\nsplittings lead to slow mediator decays, leaving signatures with displaced\nvertices or disappearing tracks at colliders. We perform a comprehensive\nanalysis of long-lived mediators at the LHC in the context of a minimal dark\nmatter model with a naturally small Higgs portal, also known as the wino-bino\nscenario in supersymmetry. Existing searches for disappearing charged tracks\nand displaced hard leptons already exclude tiny portal couplings that cannot be\nprobed by current direct and indirect detection experiments. For larger portal\ncouplings, we predict new signatures with displaced soft leptons, which are\naccessible with run-II data.

Abstract: Despite the fact that the solar neutrino flux is now well-understood in the\ncontext of matter-affected neutrino mixing, we find that it is not yet possible\nto set a strong and model-independent bound on solar neutrino decays. If\nneutrinos decay into truly invisible particles, the Earth-Sun baseline defines\na lifetime limit of $\\tau/m \\agt 10^{-4}$ s/eV. However, there are many\npossibilities which must be excluded before such a bound can be established.\nThere is an obvious degeneracy between the neutrino lifetime and the mixing\nparameters. More generally, one must also allow the possibility of active\ndaughter neutrinos and/or antineutrinos, which may partially conceal the\ncharacteristic features of decay. Many of the most exotic possibilities that\npresently complicate the extraction of a decay bound will be removed if the\nKamLAND reactor antineutrino experiment confirms the large-mixing angle\nsolution to the solar neutrino problem and measures the mixing parameters\nprecisely. Better experimental and theoretical constraints on the $^8$B\nneutrino flux will also play a key role, as will tighter bounds on absolute\nneutrino masses. Though the lifetime limit set by the solar flux is weak, it is\nstill the strongest direct limit on non-radiative neutrino decay.

The double distributions depend both on\nmodification of the t t-bar production and t(t-bar) --> b(b-bar) W decay\nvertices. However, the leptonic angular distribution turned out to be totally\ninsensitive to non-standard parts of Wtb vertex. Distributions of decay\nproducts for polarized top quark in its rest frame have been also calculated.\nIt has been found that the factorization of energy and angular dependence for\nthe double leptonic distribution noticed earlier for the Standard Model\nsurvives even if one allows for deviations from the V-A interactions, and the\nSM angular leptonic distribution turned out to be preserved by anomalous decay\nvertex. \n\n"}

The magnitude of the observed effects depends on how large the\ncorrelation length $\\xi$ becomes. Because the matter created in a heavy ion\ncollision cools through the critical region of the phase diagram in a finite\ntime, critical slowing down limits the growth of $\\xi$, preventing it from\nstaying in equilibrium. This is the fundamental nonequilibrium effect which\nmust be calculated in order to make quantitative predictions for experiment.

We argue that flow observables within systems with a non-negligible\nmean free path should acquire a \"dynamical\" fluctuation, due to the random\nnature of each collision between the system's degrees of freedom. Because of\nthis, $v_2$ fluctuations can be used to estimate the Knudsen number of the\nsystem produced at RHIC. To illustrate this quantitatively, we apply the UrQMD\nmodel, with scaled cross sections, to show that collisions at RHIC have a\nKnudsen number at least one order of magnitude above the expected value for an\ninteracting hadron gas. Furthermore, we argue that the Knudsen number is also\nbound from above by the $v_2$ fluctuation data, because too large a Knudsen\nnumber would break the observed scaling of $v_2$ fluctuations due to the onset\nof turbulent flow. We propose, therefore that $v_2$ fluctuation measurements,\ntogether with an understanding of the turbulent regime for relativistic\nhydrodynamics, will provide an upper as well as a lower limit for the Knudsen\nnumber. \n\n"}
