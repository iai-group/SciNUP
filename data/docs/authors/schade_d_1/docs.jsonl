Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie.

Many more such discoveries are\nanticipated in the coming years with radial velocity and transit searches. Here\nwe investigate the different mechanisms that could form \"hot Earths\" and their\nobservable predictions. Models include: 1) in situ accretion; 2) formation at\nlarger orbital distance followed by inward \"type 1\" migration; 3) formation\nfrom material being \"shepherded\" inward by a migrating gas giant planet; 4)\nformation from material being shepherded by moving secular resonances during\ndispersal of the protoplanetary disk; 5) tidal circularization of eccentric\nterrestrial planets with close-in perihelion distances; and 6)\nphoto-evaporative mass loss of a close-in giant planet. Models 1-4 have been\nvalidated in previous work. We show that tidal circularization can form hot\nEarths, but only for relatively massive planets (> 5 Earth masses) with very\nclose-in perihelion distances (< 0.025 AU), and even then the net inward\nmovement in orbital distance is at most only 0.1-0.15 AU. For planets of less\nthan about 70 Earth masses, photo-evaporation can remove the planet's envelope\nand leave behind the solid core on a Gyr timescale, but only for planets inside\n0.025-0.05 AU. Using two quantities that are observable by current and upcoming\nmissions, we show that these models each produce unique signatures, and can be\nobservationally distinguished. These observables are the planetary system\narchitecture (detectable with radial velocities, transits and transit-timing)\nand the bulk composition of transiting close-in terrestrial planets (measured\nby transits via the planet's radius). \n\n"}

Until\nvery recently, the Galactic population consisted of a relatively well studied\ndisk population, a somewhat studied smaller bulge population and a mostly\nunknown, but potentially large halo population. It has been argued that the\nhalo population may produce a signal that is much stronger (factor of ~5 in\nspectral amplitude) than the disk population. However, this surprising result\nwas not based on an actual calculation of a halo white dwarf population but was\nderived on (i) the assumption that one can extrapolate the halo population\nproperties from those of the disk population and (ii) the postulated\n(unrealistically) high number of white dwarfs in the halo. We perform the first\ncalculation of a halo white dwarf population using population synthesis models.\nOur comparison with the signal arising from double white dwarfs in the Galactic\ndisk+bulge clearly shows that it is impossible for the double white dwarf halo\nsignal to exceed that of the rest of the Galaxy. Using microlensing results to\ngive an upper limit on the content of white dwarfs in the halo (~30 % baryonic\nmass in white dwarfs), our predicted halo signal is a factor of 10 lower than\nthe disk+bulge signal. Even in the implausible case where all of the baryonic\nhalo mass is found in white dwarfs, the halo signal does not become comparable\nto that of the disk+bulge, and thus would still have a negligible effect on the\ndetection of other LISA sources. \n\n"}

By comparing the iron abundances [Fe/H]\nwith calcium triplet (CaT) metallicities we show that the empirical CaT\ntechnique yields good agreement with the high-resolution data for [Fe/H]>-2\ndex, but tends to deviate at lower metallicities. We identify two metal poor\nstars with iron abundances of -2.72 and -2.50 dex. These stars are found to\nhave enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios similar to those of stars in the Milky Way\nhalo. However, the bulk of the Carina red giants are depleted in the [alpha/Fe]\nabundance ratios with respect to the Galactic halo at a given metallicity. One\nof our targets, with a [Fe/H] of -1.5 dex, is considerably depleted in almost\nall of the alpha-elements by ~0.5 dex compared to the solar values. Such a low\n[alpha/Fe] can be produced by stochastical fluctuations in terms of an\nincomplete mixing of single Type Ia and II SNe events into the ISM. Our derived\nelement ratios are consistent with the episodic and extended SF in Carina known\nfrom its color-magnitude diagram. We find a considerable star-to-star scatter\nin the abundance ratios. This suggests that Carina's SF history varies with\nposition within the galaxy, with incomplete mixing. Alternatively, the SF rate\nis so low that the high-mass stellar IMF is sparsely populated, as\nstatistically expected in low-mass star clusters, leading to real scatter in\nthe resultant mass-integrated yields.

We demonstrate that rapid (\\Delta\nz< 0.1-0.2), strong (\\Delta T > 10^4 K) photo-heating is difficult to achieve\nacross the entire IGM unless quasar spectra are significantly harder than\nimplied by current observational constraints. Although filtering of intrinsic\nquasar radiation through dense regions in the IGM does increase the mean excess\nenergy per HeII photo-ionisation, it also weakens the radiation intensity and\nlowers the photo-ionisation rate, preventing rapid heating over time intervals\nshorter than the local photo-ionisation timescale. Moreover, the hard photons\nresponsible for the strongest heating are more likely to deposit their energy\ninside dense clumps. The abundance of such clumps is, however, uncertain and\nmodel-dependent, leading to a fairly large uncertainty in the photo-heating\nrates. Nevertheless, although some of the IGM may be exposed to a hardened and\nweakened ionising background for long periods, most of the IGM must instead be\nreionised by the more abundant, softer photons and with accordingly modest\nheating rates (\\Delta T < 10^4 K).

This is\nparticularly motivated by recent indications from HYMORS. Exploiting high\nresolution, numerical simulations, we demonstrate that for both high and low\nenergy jets, always at high Lorentz factor, a transition to a higher density\nenvironment can cause a significant fraction of the directed jet energy to be\nlost on reflection. This can explain how one-sided jet deceleration and a\ntransition to FR I type can occur in HYMORS, which start as FR II (and remain\nso on the other side). For that purpose, we implemented in the relativistic\nhydrodynamic grid-adaptive AMRVAC code, the Synge-type equation of state\nintroduced in the general polytropic case by Meliani et al. (2004). We present\nresults for 10 model computations, varying the inlet Lorentz factor from 10 to\n20, including uniform or decreasing density profiles, and allowing for\ncylindrical versus conical jet models.

We discuss problems\nof measuring mass-loss rates from weak winds and the potential of NIR-\nspectroscopy. Wind-clumping has severe implications for the interpretation of\nobservational diagnostics, as derived mass-loss rates can be overestimated by\nfactors of 2 to 10 if clumping is ignored, and we describe ongoing attempts to\nallow for more uniform results. We point out that independent arguments from\nstellar evolution favor a moderate reduction of present- day mass-loss rates.\nWe also consider larger scale wind structure, interpreted in terms of\nco-rotating interacting regions, and complete this review with a discussion of\nrecent progress on the X-ray line emission from massive stars, highlighting as\nto how far the analysis of such X-ray line emission can give further clues\nregarding an adequate description of wind clumping.

Irrespective of galaxy type, we confirm the\nincrease of the S_N-value above and below a galaxy magnitude of Mv = -20 mag.\nOver the full mass range, the S_L-value of early-type galaxies is, on average,\ntwice that of late-types. To investigate the observed trends we derive\ntheoretical predictions of GC system scaling parameters as a function of host\ngalaxy mass based on the models of Dekel & Birnboim (2006) in which\nstar-formation processes are regulated by stellar and supernova feedback below\na stellar mass of 3x10^10 M_sol, and by virial shocks above it. We find that\nthe analytical model describes remarkably well the shape of the GC system\nscaling parameter distributions with a universal specific GC formation\nefficiency, eta, which relates the total mass in GCs to the total galaxy halo\nmass. Early-type and late-type galaxies show a similar mean value of eta =\n5.5e-5, with an increasing scatter towards lower galaxy masses. This can be due\nto the enhanced stochastic nature of the star and star-cluster formation\nprocesses for such systems. Some massive galaxies have excess eta values\ncompared to what is expected from the mean model prediction for galaxies more\nluminous than Mv = -20 mag (Lv=10^10L_sol). This may be attributed to a very\nefficient early GC formation, less efficient production of field stars or\naccretion of predominantly low-mass/luminosity high-eta galaxies, or a mixture\nof all these effects.

In particular, clusters show\nstar-to-star abundance variations, and multiple sequences in their\ncolour-magnitude diagrams. These effects seem to be restricted to globular\nclusters, and are not found in open clusters or the field. In this paper, we\ncombine the two competing models for these multiple populations and include a\nconsideration of the effects of stellar collisions. Collisions are one of the\nfew phenomena which occur solely in dense stellar environments like\n(proto-)globular clusters. We find that runaway collisions between massive\nstars can produce material which has abundances comparable to the observed\nsecond generations, but that very little total mass is produced by this\nchannel. We then add the contributions of rapidly-rotating massive stars (under\nthe assumption that massive stars are spun up by collisions and interactions),\nand the contribution of asymptotic giant branch stars. We find that collisions\ncan help produce the extreme abundances which are seen in some clusters.\nHowever, the total amount of material produced in these generations is still\ntoo small (by at least a factor of 10) to match the observations. We conclude\nwith a discussion of the additional effects which probably need to be\nconsidered to solve this particular problem. \n\n"}

We interpret our measurements using halo\noccupation distribution (HOD) modeling assuming a Lambda-CDM cosmology. The\namplitude of w_p(r_p) grows slowly with luminosity for L < L_* and increases\nsharply at higher luminosities, with bias factor b(>L)=1.06+0.23(L/L_*)^{1.12}.\nAt fixed luminosity, redder galaxies have a stronger and steeper w_p(r_p), a\ntrend that runs steadily from the bluest galaxies to the reddest galaxies. The\nindividual luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations are\nstrikingly different. Blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of w_p(r_p)\nwith luminosity, at all scales. The large-scale clustering of red galaxies\nshows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at L > 4L_*, but the\nlowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 L_*) show very strong clustering on\nscales r_p < 2 Mpc/h.

We construct self-consistent models of nonspherical\nisothermal halos embedding a zero-thickness disk, by assuming that the halo\ndistribution function is a Maxwellian. The method developed here can be used to\nstudy other physically-based choices for the halo distribution function and the\ncase of a disk accompanied by a bulge. In a preliminary investigation we note\nthe existence of a fine tuning between the scalelengths R_{\\Omega} and h,\nrespectively characterizing the rise of the rotation curve and the luminosity\nprofile of the disk, which surprisingly applies to both high surface brightness\nand low surface brightness galaxies. This empirical correlation identifies a\nmuch stronger conspiracy than the one required by the smoothness and flatness\nof the rotation curve (disk-halo conspiracy). The self-consistent models are\ncharacterized by smooth and flat rotation curves for very different\ndisk-to-halo mass ratios, hence suggesting that conspiracy is not as dramatic\nas often imagined. For a typical rotation curve, with asymptotically flat\nrotation curve at V_{\\infty} (the precise value of which can also be treated as\na free parameter), and a typical density profile of the disk, self-consistent\nmodels are characterized by two dimensionless parameters, which correspond to\nthe dimensional scales (the disk mass-to-light ratio M/L and the halo central\ndensity) of standard disk-halo decompositions.

This gives a consistent description of the quenching\nmechanism in mean-field dynamo models. The main goal of this work is to explore\nthe effects of this quenching mechanism in solar-like geometry, and in\nparticular to investigate the role of magnetic helicity fluxes, specifically\ndiffusive and Vishniac-Cho (VC) fluxes, at large magnetic Reynolds numbers\n(Rm). For models with negative radial shear or positive latitudinal shear, the\nmagnetic alpha effect has predominantly negative (positive) sign in the\nnorthern (southern) hemisphere. In the absence of fluxes, we find that the\nmagnetic energy follows an Rm^-1 dependence, as found in previous works. This\ncatastrophic quenching is alleviated in models with diffusive magnetic helicity\nfluxes resulting in magnetic fields comparable to the equipartition value even\nfor Rm=10^7. On the other hand, models with a shear-driven Vishniac-Cho flux\nshow an increase of the amplitude of the magnetic field with respect to models\nwithout fluxes, but only for Rm<10^4. This is mainly a consequence of assuming\na vacuum outside the Sun which cannot support a significant VC flux across the\nboundary. However, in contrast with the diffusive flux, the VC flux modifies\nthe distribution of the magnetic field. In addition, if an ill-determined\nscaling factor in the expression for the VC flux is large enough, subcritical\ndynamo action is possible that is driven by the action of shear and the\ndivergence of current helicity flux. \n\n"}

Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation.

In four cases, the red wing\nof the line is more variable than the power-law continuum and extends down to\nenergies of ~ 5 keV.

In the\nearly main accretion phase, the disk size is limited to \\sim 10 AU because the\nangular momentum of the circumstellar disk is effectively transferred by both\nmagnetic braking and the protostellar outflow. In the later main accretion\nphase, however, the circumstellar disk grows rapidly and exceeds 100 AU by the\nend of the main accretion phase. This rapid growth of the circumstellar disk is\ncaused by the depletion of the infalling envelope, while magnetic braking is\neffective when the infalling envelope is more massive than the circumstellar\ndisk. The infalling envelope cannot brake the circumstellar disk when the\nlatter is more massive than the former. In addition, the protostellar outflow\nweakens and disappears in the later main accretion phase, because the outflow\nis powered by gas accretion onto the circumstellar disk. Although the\ncircumstellar disk formed in a magnetized cloud is considerably smaller than\nthat in an unmagnetized cloud, a circumstellar disk exceeding 100 AU can form\neven in a strongly magnetized cloud. \n\n"}

In some well-known analytic models, developed in the 1980s,\nthe B_phi profile was taken to be proportional to the relative angular velocity\nbetween the disc plasma and the neutron star, multiplied by a vertical dipolar\nfield. The present work stands in the line of improving those models,\nsuggesting a new profile for B.

Importantly,\nthese environments consist just of electrons and ions and the dissipated energy\nalways stays with the plasma.

I identify the key processes distinguishing HED\nreconnection: special-relativistic effects; radiative effects (radiative\ncooling, radiation pressure, and Compton resistivity); and, at the most extreme\nend, QED effects, including pair creation. I then discuss the main\nastrophysical applications --- situations with magnetar-strength fields\n(exceeding the quantum critical field of about 4 x 10^13 G): giant SGR flares\nand magnetically-powered central engines and jets of GRBs.

The solutions are characterized by the radial velocity, which\nplays a role of the self-similar parameter in our solutions. The shock Lorentz\nfactor gradually increases with radius. It can be approximately represented by\nthe power of radius with the power law index of 0.25.\n  We also carried out magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of\nmagnetic loops to study the stability and the generality of our analytical\nsolutions. We used the analytical solutions as the initial condition and the\ninner boundary conditions. We confirmed that our solutions are stable over the\nsimulation time and that numerical results nicely recover the analytical\nsolutions. We then carried out numerical simulations to study the generality of\nour solutions by changing the power law index \\delta of the ambient plasma\ndensity \\rho_0 \\propto r^{-\\delta}. We alter the power law index \\delta from\n3.5 in the analytical solutions. The analytical solutions are used as the\ninitial conditions inside the shock in all simulations.

These morphological disturbances\nare related to the ram-pressure stripping and tidal interaction that galaxies\nundergo in this dense cluster environment. To quantify the morphological\ntransformation of the HI disks, we compute the morphological parameters of CAS,\nGini, and M20 and our own GM for 51 galaxies in 48 HI column density maps from\nthe VIVA project. Some morphological phenomena can be identified in this space\nof relatively low resolution HI data. Truncation of the HI disk can be cleanly\nidentified via the Concentration parameter (C<1) and Concentration can also be\nused to identify HI deficient disks (1<C<5). Tidal interaction is typically\nidentified using combinations of these morphological parameters, applied to\n(optical) images of galaxies. We find that some selection criteria (Gini-M20,\nAsymmetry, and a modified Concentration-M20) are still applicable for the\ncoarse (~15\" FWHM) VIVA HI data. The phenomena of tidal tails can be reasonably\nwell identified using the Gini-M20 criterion (60% of galaxies with tails\nidentified but with as many contaminants).

Therefore, future searches for\ninteraction using HI morphologies should take ram-pressure into account as a\nmechanism to disturb HI disks enough to make them appear as gravitationally\ninteracting.

The 680 identified bona-fide PMS stars show a bimodal age distribution,\nwith two roughly equally numerous populations peaked respectively at ~1 Myr,\nand ~20 Myr. We use the age and other physical properties of these PMS stars to\nstudy how star formation has proceeded across time and space in NGC 346. We\nfind no correlation between the locations of young and old PMS stars, nor do we\nfind a correspondence between the positions of young PMS stars and those of\nmassive OB stars of similar age. Furthermore, the mass distribution of stars\nwith similar age shows large variations throughout the region. We conclude\nthat, while on a global scale it makes sense to talk about an initial mass\nfunction, this concept is not meaningful for individual star-forming regions.\nAn interesting implication of the separation between regions where massive\nstars and low-mass objects appear to form is that high-mass stars might not be\n\"perfect\" indicators of star formation and hence a large number of low-mass\nstars formed elsewhere might have so far remained unnoticed. For certain low\nsurface density galaxies this way of preferential low-mass star formation may\nbe the predominant mechanism, with the consequence that their total mass as\nderived from the luminosity may be severely underestimated and that their\nevolution is not correctly understood. \n\n"}

We begin with well-established\nproperties of the disk of the Milky Way, such as the stellar number density\ndistribution, the initial mass function, the star formation history, and the\nmetallicity gradient as a function of radial position and time. We vary some of\nthese properties, creating four models to test the sensitivity of our\nassumptions. To assess habitability on the Galactic scale, we model supernova\nrates, planet formation, and the time required for complex life to evolve. Our\nstudy improves on other literature on the GHZ by populating stars on an\nindividual basis and by modelling SNII and SNIa sterilizations by selecting\ntheir progenitors from within this preexisting stellar population. Furthermore,\nwe consider habitability on tidally locked and non-tidally locked planets\nseparately, and study habitability as a function of height above and below the\nGalactic midplane. In the model that most accurately reproduces the properties\nof the Galaxy, the results indicate that an individual SNIa is ~5.6 \\times more\nlethal than an individual SNII on average.

Abstract: The prospect of detecting the first galaxies by observing their impact on the\nintergalactic medium as they reionized it during the first billion years leads\nus to ask whether such indirect observations are capable of diagnosing which\ntypes of galaxies were most responsible for reionization. We attempt to answer\nthis by considering a set of large-scale radiative transfer simulations of\nreionization in sufficiently large volumes to make statistically meaningful\npredictions of observable signatures, while also directly resolving all\natomically-cooling halos down to 10^8 M_solar. We focus here on predictions of\nthe 21-cm background, to see if upcoming observations are capable of\ndistinguishing a universe ionized primarily by high-mass halos from one in\nwhich both high-mass and low-mass halos are responsible, and to see how these\nresults depend upon the uncertain source efficiencies. We find that 21-cm\nfluctuation power spectra observed by the first generation EoR/21-cm radio\ninterferometer arrays should be able to distinguish the case of reionization by\nhigh-mass halos alone from that by both high- and low-mass halos, together.\nSome reionization scenarios yield very similar power spectra and rms evolution\nand thus can only be discriminated by their different mean reionization history\nand 21-cm PDF distributions. We find that the skewness of the 21-cm PDF\ndistribution smoothed over LOFAR-like window shows a clear feature correlated\nwith the rise of the rms due to patchiness. Measurements of the mean\nphotoionization rates are sensitive to the average density of the regions being\nstudied and therefore could be strongly skewed in certain cases. (abridged) \n\n"}

This smooth ionization\ncomponent changes the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\ntemperature anisotropies.

For the\nconversion from the angular to the spatial correlation function we used the\nLimber integral equation and the luminosity-dependent density evolution model\nof the AGN X-ray luminosity function. We have found significant angular\ncorrelations with the power-law parameters gamma = 1.81 +/- 0.02, theta_0 =\n1.3\" +/- 0.2\" for the soft, and gamma = 2.00 +/- 0.04, theta_0 = 7.3\" +/- 1.0\"\nfor the hard bands. The amplitude of the correlation function w(theta) is\nhigher in the hard than in the soft band for f_x < 10^-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 and\nlower above this flux limit. We confirm that the clustering strength theta_0\ngrows with the flux limit of the sample, a trend which is also present in the\namplitude of the spatial correlation function, but only for the soft band. In\nthe hard band, it remains almost constant with r_0 = 10h^-1$ Mpc, irrespective\nof the flux limit. Our analysis of AGN subsamples with different hardness\nratios shows that the sources with a hard-spectrum are more clustered than\nsoft-spectrum ones. This result may be a hint that the two main types of AGN\npopulate different environments. Finally, we find that our clustering results\ncorrespond to an X-ray selected AGN bias factor of ~ 2.5 for the soft-band\nsources (at a median z = 1.1) and ~ 3.3 for the hard-band sources (at a median\nz = 1), which translates into a host dark matter halo mass of ~ 10^13 h^-1 M_o\nand ~ 10^13.7 h^-1 M_o for the soft and hard bands, respectively. \n\n"}

Abstract: While the existence of a starburst-AGN connection is undisputed, there is no\nconsensus on what the connection is. In this contribution, we begin by noting\nthat the mechanisms which drive gas inwards in disk galaxies are generally\ninefficient at removing angular momentum, leading to stalled inflows. Thus, a\ntiered series of such processes is required to bring gas to the smallest\nscales, each of which on its own may not correlate with the presence of an AGN.\nSimilarly, each may be associated with a starburst event, making it important\nto discriminate between 'circumnuclear' and 'nuclear' star formation. In this\ncontribution, we show that stellar feedback on scales of tens of parsecs plays\na critical role in first hindering and then helping accretion. We argue that it\nis only after the initial turbulent phases of a starburst that gas from slow\nstellar winds can accrete efficiently to smaller scales.

Since primordial\nfluctuations in the CMB on these scales are completely erased by Silk damping,\nthese distortions may provide the only way to shed light on otherwise\nunobservable aspects of inflationary physics.

Simple calculations suggest too low a slope and too\nhigh a scatter, and recent semi-analytic models and numerical galaxy\nsimulations typically fail to reproduce some aspects of the relation.\nFurthermore, the assumptions underlying one model are often inconsistent with\nthose behind another. This paper aims to develop a rigorous prediction for the\nBTFR in the context of LCDM, using only a priori expected effects and\nrelations, a minimum of theoretical assumptions, and no free parameters. The\nrobustness of the relation to changes in key galactic parameters will be\nexplored. I adopt a modular approach, taking each of the stand alone galaxy\nrelations necessary for constructing the BTFR from up-to-date numerical\nsimulations of dark halos. These relations -- and their expected scatter -- are\nused to describe model spirals with a range of masses, resulting in a band in\nthe space of the BTFR that represents the current best guess for the LCDM\nprediction. Consistent treatment of expected LCDM effects goes a large way\ntowards reconciling the naive slope-3 LCDM prediction with the data, especially\nin the range 10^9 M_sun < M_bar < 10^11 M_sun.

An\nanalytic model is also derived to understand what size particles can be\nfiltered by the gap edge. Finally, with our updated understanding of dust\nfiltration, we have computed Monte-Carlo radiative transfer models with\nvariable dust size distributions to generate the spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of disks with gaps. By comparing with transitional disk observations\n(e.g. GM Aur), we have found that dust filtration alone has difficulties to\ndeplete small particles sufficiently to explain the near-IR deficit of\ntransitional disks, except under some extreme circumstances. The scenario of\ngap opening by multiple planets studied previously suffers the same difficulty.\nOne possible solution is by invoking both dust filtration and dust growth in\nthe inner disk. In this scenario, a planet induced gap filters large dust\nparticles in the disk, and the remaining small dust particles passing to the\ninner disk can grow efficiently without replenishment from fragmentation of\nlarge grains.

Firstly, it is applied to the well\nknown period-period derivative diagram, where we find that the pulsar\ndistribution can be modeled with six Gaussian clusters, with two clusters for\nmillisecond pulsars (recycled pulsars) and the rest for normal pulsars. From\nthis distribution, we derive an empirical definition for millisecond pulsars as\n$\\frac{\\dot{P}}{10^{-17}} \\leq3.23(\\frac{P}{100 \\textrm{ms}})^{-2.34}$. The two\nmillisecond pulsar clusters may have different evolutionary origins, since the\ncompanion stars to these pulsars in the two clusters show different chemical\ncomposition. Four clusters are found for normal pulsars. Possible implications\nfor these clusters are also discussed. Our second example is to calculate the\nlikelihood of unidentified \\textit{Fermi} point sources being pulsars and rank\nthem accordingly. In the ranked point source list, the top 5% sources contain\n50% known pulsars, the top 50% contain 99% known pulsars, and no known active\ngalaxy (the other major population) appears in the top 6%. Such a ranked list\ncan be used to help the future follow-up observations for finding pulsars in\nunidentified \\textit{Fermi} point sources. \n\n"}

This result has important theoretical and observational\nimplications. However, because of technical difficulties, the radial dynamic\nrange in almost all previous simulations usually spans at most two orders of\nmagnitude. This small dynamical range, combined with the effects of boundary\nconditions, makes the simulation results suspectable. Especially, the radial\nprofiles of density and accretion rate may not be precise enough to be used to\ncompare with observations. In this paper we present a \"two-zone\" approach to\nexpand the radial dynamical range from two to four orders of magnitude. We\nconfirm previous results and find that from $r_s$ to $ 10^4r_s$ the radial\nprofiles of accretion rate and density can be well described by\n$\\dot{M}(r)\\propto r^s$ and $\\rho\\propto r^{-p}$.

In addition to the well-known terms that correspond to the\nGR precession of the inner and outer orbits, we find a new secular\npost-Newtonian interaction term that can affect the long-term evolution of the\ntriple. We explore the parameter space for highly inclined and eccentric\nsystems, where the Kozai-Lidov mechanism can produce large-amplitude\noscillations in the eccentricities. The standard lore, i.e., that General\nRelativity effects suppress eccentricity, is only consistent with the parts of\nphase space where the General Relativity timescales are several orders of\nmagnitude shorter than the secular Newtonian one. In other parts of phase\nspace, however, post-Newtonian corrections combined with the three body ones,\ncan excite eccentricities.

One is that only a small fraction of\naccretion flow available at the outer boundary can finally falls onto the black\nhole while most of them is lost in outflow. Another one is that electrons may\ndirectly receive a large fraction of the viscously dissipated energy in the\naccretion flow, i.e, $\\delta\\sim 0.1-0.5$. The radiative efficiency of hot\naccretion flow when these two progresses are taken into account has not been\nsystematically studied and is the subject of the present paper. We consider two\nregimes of hot accretion model. One is the advection dominated accretion flows\n(ADAFs) which lie on low accretion rate regime, $\\la 10\\alpha^2\\ledd/c^2$;\nanother being the luminous hot accretion flows (LHAFs) which lie above this\naccretion rate. For the latter, we assume that the accretion flow will has a\ntwo-phase structure above a certain accretion rate, and a simplification is\nadopted in our calculation of the dynamics. Our results indicate that the\nradiative efficiency of hot accretion flow increases with the accretion rate\nand is highly enhanced by the direct viscous heating to electrons compared to\nthe previous case of $\\delta\\ll 1$. When the accretion rate is high, the\nradiative efficiency of hot accretion flow is comparable to that of the\nstandard thin disk.

Here we introduce TAM waves, solutions of fixed total angular\nmomentum to the Helmholtz equation, for three-dimensional scalar, vector, and\ntensor fields. The vector TAM waves of given total angular momentum can be\ndecomposed further into a set of three basis functions of fixed orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM), a set of fixed helicity, or a basis consisting of a\nlongitudinal (L) and two transverse (E and B) TAM waves.

The properties of the\ndEs in Virgo show gradients within the cluster. dEs in the outer parts of the\nVirgo cluster are kinematically supported by rotation, while those in the\ncenter are supported by the random motions of their stars (i.e. pressure\nsupported). The rotationally supported dEs have disky isophotes and faint\nunderlying spiral/irregular substructures, they also show younger ages than\nthose pressure supported, which have boxy isophotes and are smooth and regular,\nwithout any substructure. We compare the position of these dEs with massive\nearly-type galaxies in the Faber-Jackson and Fundamental Plane relations, and\nwe find that, although there is no difference between the position of\nrotationally and pressure supported dEs, both deviate from the relations of\nmassive early-type galaxies in the direction of dwarf spheroidal systems\n(dSphs).

This scenario is\nattractive for the progenitor systems of present-day massive globular clusters\n(GCs) which likely had masses M \\gtrsim 10^7\\msun. In such clusters, supernovae\nand stellar winds cannot provide a plausible explanation for the sudden removal\nof the primordial gas reservoir that is required to explain their complex\nchemical enrichment history.\n  In order to consider different regimes in the gas accretion rate onto\nstellar-mass BHs, we consider both the Bondi-Hoyle and Eddington\napproximations. For either model, our results show that the gas can be\nsignificantly depleted within only a few tens of Myrs. This process will affect\nthe distribution of BH masses, and may accelerate the dynamical decoupling of\nthe BH population and, ultimately, their dynamical ejection. Moreover, the\ntimescales for gas depletion are sufficiently short that the accreting BHs\ncould significantly affect the chemistry of subsequent star formation episodes.\n  The gas depletion times and final mass in BHs are sensitive to the assumed\nmodel for the accretion rate, and to the initial mass of the most massive BH\nwhich, in turn, is determined by the upper mass cut-off of the stellar IMF. Our\nresults imply that the remnant accretion history can have an important bearing\non the observed present-day cluster mass-to-light ratio. In particular, we show\nthat an increase of the upper mass cut-off with decreasing metallicity could\ncontribute to the observed anti-correlation between the mass-to-light ratio and\nthe metallicity of GCs. \n\n"}

Low-efficiency star formation in early-type\n  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations Abstract: We study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolution\nhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type and\nspiral galaxies. Despite using a universal local law to form stars in the\nsimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spirals\non the large-scale Kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times less\nefficiently. This offset is in agreement with previous results on morphological\nquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded in\nearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. As\na result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach as\nhigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. Even if some molecular gas is\npresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantly\nreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. We also\nanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their CO\nand HI surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by their\nnon-stellar 8um emission. As predicted by the simulations, we find that the\nearly-type galaxies are offset from the Kennicutt relation compared to the\nspirals, with a twice lower efficiency. Finally, we validate our approach by\nperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. We run a\nsimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of NGC524, a\nlenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation rate\nin good agreement with the observations.

Furthermore, terrestrial planets in the habitable\nzones (HZs) around M-dwarfs can potentially be characterized in the near future\nand hence may be the first such planets to be studied. Recently Dressing &\nCharbonneau(2013) used Kepler data and calculated the frequency of terrestrial\nplanets in the HZ of cool stars to be 0.15^{+0.13}_{-0.06} per star for\nEarth-size planets (0.5-1.4 R_{Earth}). However, this estimate was derived\nusing the Kasting et al.(1993) HZ limits, which were not valid for stars with\neffective temperatures lower than 3700 K. Here we update their result using new\nHZ limits from Kopparapu et al.(2013) for stars with effective temperatures\nbetween 2600 K and 7200 K, which includes the cool M stars in the Kepler target\nlist. The new habitable zone boundaries increase the number of planet\ncandidates in the habitable zone. Assuming Earth-size planets as 0.5 - 1.4\nR_{Earth}, when we reanalyze their results, we obtain a terrestrial planet\nfrequency of 0.48^{+0.12}_{-0.24} and 0.53^{+0.08}_{-0.17} planets per M-dwarf\nstar for conservative and optimistic limits of the HZ boundaries, respectively.\nAssuming Earth-size planets as 0.5 - 2 R_{Earth}, the frequency increases to\n0.51^{+0.10}_{-0.20} per star for the conservative estimate and to\n0.61^{+0.07}_{-0.15} per star for the optimistic estimate.

The high-resolution H-band APOGEE spectra\nprovide the opportunity to measure physical stellar parameters such as\neffective temperatures and metallicities for many of these stars. At the\nculmination of this survey, we will have obtained multi-epoch spectra and RVs\nfor over 1400 stars spanning spectral types of M0-L0, providing the largest set\nof NIR M dwarf spectra at high resolution, and more than doubling the number of\nknown spectroscopic vsini values for M dwarfs. Furthermore, by modeling\ntelluric lines to correct for small instrumental radial velocity shifts, we\nhope to achieve a relative velocity precision floor of 50 m/s for bright M\ndwarfs.

We therefore claim\nthat at least one of the two VHE photons is securely associated with the\nblazar, making PKS 0426-380 the most distant VHE emitter known to date. The\nresults are in agreement with the most recent Fermi-LAT constraints on the\nExtragalactic Background Light (EBL) intensity, which imply a $z \\simeq 1$\nhorizon for $\\simeq$ 100 GeV photons. The LAT detection of the two VHE\ngamma-rays coincided roughly with flaring states of the source, although we did\nnot find an exact correspondence between the VHE photon arrival times and the\nflux maxima at lower gamma-ray energies. Modeling the gamma-ray continuum of\nPKS 0426-380 with daily bins revealed a significant spectral hardening around\nthe time of detection of the first VHE event (LAT photon index \\Gamma\\ $\\simeq$\n1.4) but on the other hand no pronounced spectral changes near the detection\ntime of the second one.

We find that many of these models\ncan reproduce the cluster's observed properties, although with a modest\npreference for substructured initial conditions. Our models produce the\nobserved radial trend in binary frequency through disruption of soft binaries\n(with semi-major axes, a > 3000 AU), on approximately a crossing time (~ 5.4\nMyr), preferentially in the cluster core. Mass segregation subsequently causes\nthe binaries to sink towards the core. After roughly one initial half-mass\nrelaxation time (t_rh(0) ~ 340 Myr) the radial binary frequency distribution\nbecomes bimodal, the innermost binaries having already segregated towards the\ncore, leaving a minimum in the radial binary frequency distribution that\nmarches outwards with time. After 4-6 t_rh(0), the rising distribution in the\nhalo disappears, leaving a radial distribution that rises only towards the\ncore. Thus, both a radial binary frequency distribution that falls towards the\ncore (as observed for NGC 1818) and one that rises towards the core (as for\nolder star clusters) can arise naturally from the same evolutionary sequence\nowing to binary disruption and mass segregation in rich star clusters. \n\n"}

One component exhibits a sawtooth-like\nvelocity waveform while the other is nearly sinusoidal. One method of\ngenerating such a hybrid is presented: a nonlinear model is developed for the\nfirst overtone mode, which, if excited to large amplitude, is found to drop\nstrongly in frequency and become highly non-sinusoidal. If the frequency drops\nsufficiently to become equal to the fundamental frequency, the two can become\nphase locked and form the desired hybrid.

The sinusoidal component may tend to stabilize the period of the\nhybrid which is found in real Blazhko data to be extremely stable.

Effects of\n  saturation, cooling and stellar irradiation Abstract: Context: Several recent studies have found that planet migration in adiabatic\ndiscs differs significantly from migration in isothermal discs. Depending on\nthe thermodynamic conditions, i.e., the effectiveness of radiative cooling, and\nthe radial surface density profile, planets migrate inward or outward. Clearly,\nthis will influence the semimajor axis - mass distribution of planets as\npredicted by population synthesis simulations. Aims: Our goal is to study the\nglobal effects of radiative cooling, viscous torque desaturation and gap\nopening as well as stellar irradiation on the tidal migration of a synthetic\nplanet population. Methods: We combine results from several analytical studies\nand 3D hydrodynamic simulations in a new semi-analytical migration model for\nthe application in our planet population synthesis calculations. Results: We\nfind a good agreement of our model with torques obtained in a 3D radiative\nhydrodynamic simulations. We find three convergence zones in a typical disc,\ntowards which planets migrate from the in- and outside, affecting strongly the\nmigration behavior of low-mass planets. Interestingly, this leads to slow type\nII like migration behavior for low-mass planets captured in those zones even\nwithout an ad hoc migration rate reduction factor or a yet to be defined\nhalting mechanism. This means that the new prescription of migration including\nnon-isothermal effects makes the preciously widely used artificial migration\nrate reduction factor obsolete.

This, together with the availability of new full evolutionary\nwhite dwarf models that are reliable at high luminosities, have opened the\npossibility of testing particle emission in the core of very hot white dwarfs,\nwhere neutrino processes are dominant. We use the available WDLFs from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey and the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey to constrain the value\nof the neutrino magnetic dipole moment ($\\mu_\\nu$). We constructed theoretical\nWDLFs for different values of $\\mu_\\nu$ and performed a $\\chi^2$-test to derive\nconstraints on the value of $\\mu_\\nu$. We also constructed a unified WDLF by\naveraging the SDSS and SSS and estimated the uncertainties by taking into\naccount the differences between the WDLF at each magnitude bin.

A larger set of\ncompletely independent WDLFs, as well as more detailed studies of the\ntheoretical WDLFs and their own uncertainties, is desirable to explore the\nsystematic uncertainties behind this constraint. \n\n"}

We demonstrate here that the\nunderlying hosts of BCDs are distinct from the broad continuum of typical dwarf\nirregular galaxies, and that it is unlikely that most dwarf irregular galaxies\ncan transform into a BCD or vice versa. Furthermore, we find that the starburst\nin a BCD only brightens it on average by ~0.8 mag (factor of two), in agreement\nwith other studies.

Abstract: The formation of the present configuration of three hot super-Earths in the\nplanet system HD 40307 is a challenge to dynamical astronomers. With the two\nsuccessive period ratios both near and slightly larger than 2, the system may\nhave evolved from pairwise 2:1 mean motion resonances (MMRs). In this paper, we\ninvestigate the evolutions of the period ratios of the three planets after the\nprimordial gas disk was depleted. Three routines are found to probably result\nin the current configuration under tidal dissipation with the center star, they\nare: (i) through apsidal alignment only; (ii) out of pairwise 2:1 MMRs, then\nthrough apsidal alignment; (iii) out of the 4:2:1 Laplace Resonance (LR) , then\nthrough apsidal alignment. All the three scenarios require the initial\neccentricities of planets $\\sim0.15$, which implies a planetary scattering\nhistory during and after the gas disk was depleted. All the three routines will\ngo through the apsidal alignment phase, and enter a state with near-zero\neccentricities finally. We also find some special characteristics for each\nroutine. If the system went through pairwise 2:1 MMRs at the beginning, the MMR\nof the outer two planets would be broken first to reach the current state. As\nfor routine (iii), the planets would be out of the Laplace Resonance at the\nplace where some high-order resonances are located. At the high-order\nresonances 17:8 or 32:15 of the planets c and d, the system will possibly enter\nthe current state as the final equilibrium. \n\n"}

Because of their extensive\nwavelength coverage, proximity, and nearly face-on geometry, the Magellanic\nClouds (MCs) provide a unique opportunity to study these processes in great\ndetail. In this paper we use the complete sample of supernova remnants (SNRs)\nin the MCs to calculate the lifetime and destruction efficiencies of silicate\nand carbon dust in these galaxies.

The significantly shorter\nlifetimes in the MCs, as compared to the Milky Way, are explained as the\ncombined effect of their lower total dust mass, and the fact that the\ndust-destroying isolated SNe in the MCs seem to be preferentially occurring in\nregions with higher than average dust-to-gas (D2G) mass ratios.

An attractive feature of such a\npossibility is that, it can reconcile dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) in\nterms of a single component, accommodated in the context of a polytropic-DM\nfluid. Accordingly, we explore the time evolution and the dynamical\ncharacteristics of a spatially-flat cosmological model, in which, in principle,\nthere is no DE at all. Instead, in this model, the DM itself possesses some\nsort of fluid-like properties, i.e., the fundamental units of the Universe\nmatter-energy content are the volume elements of a DM fluid, performing\npolytropic flows. In this case, the energy of this fluid's internal motions is\nalso taken into account as a source of the universal gravitational field. This\nform of energy can compensate for the extra energy needed to compromise spatial\nflatness, namely, to justify that, today, the total-energy density parameter is\nexactly unity. The polytropic cosmological model, depends on only one free\nparameter, the corresponding exponent, \\Gamma. What makes this model\nparticularly interesting, is that, for \\Gamma < 0.541, the (conventional)\npressure becomes negative enough, so that the Universe accelerates its\nexpansion at cosmological redshifts below a transition value. Several physical\nreasons impose further constraints on the value of \\Gamma, which, eventually,\nis settled down to the range -0.089 < \\Gamma < 0. Such a cosmological model\ndoes not suffer either from the age problem or from the coincidence problem. At\nthe same time, this model reproduces to high accuracy the distance measurements\nperformed with the aid of the supernovae Type Ia standard candles, and most\nnaturally interprets, not only when, but also, why the Universe transits from\ndeceleration to acceleration, thus arising as a mighty contestant for a DE\nmodel. \n\n"}

In this\npaper, we investigate interactions between the spectra of available assumptions\nregarding both conditionalization and typicality, and draw out the effects of\nthese interactions in a concrete setting; namely, on predictions of the total\nnumber of species that contribute significantly to dark matter. In particular,\nfor each conditionalization scheme studied, we analyze how correlations between\ndensities of different dark matter species affect the prediction, and explicate\nthe effects of assumptions regarding typicality.

Both components become too\nfaint to be used as a tracer in observations of high-redshift galaxies. In\nthose cases, the 158 $\\mu$m line of atomic carbon [CII] may be the only way to\nderive M_dyn. As the distribution and kinematics of the ISM tracer affects the\ndetermination of M_dyn, it is important to quantify the relative distributions\nof HI, CO and [CII]. HI and CO are well-characterised observationally, however,\nfor [CII] only very few measurements exist. Here we compare observations of CO,\nHI, and [CII] emission of a sample of nearby galaxies, drawn from the HERACLES,\nTHINGS and KINGFISH surveys. We find that within R_25, the average [CII]\nexponential radial profile is slightly shallower than that of the CO, but much\nsteeper than the HI distribution. This is also reflected in the integrated\nspectrum (\"global profile\"), where the [CII] spectrum looks more like that of\nthe CO than that of the HI. For one galaxy, a spectrally resolved comparison of\nintegrated spectra was possible; other comparisons were limited by the\nintrinsic line-widths of the galaxies and the coarse velocity resolution of the\n[CII] data. Using high-spectral-resolution SOFIA [CII] data of a number of star\nforming regions in two nearby galaxies, we find that their [CII] linewidths\nagree better with those of the CO than the HI. As the radial extent of a given\nISM tracer is a key input in deriving M_dyn from spatially unresolved data, we\nconclude that the relevant length-scale to use in determining M_dyn based on\n[CII] data, is that of the well-characterised CO distribution.

Velocity estimates within the intracluster medium (ICM) can be\nobtained via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, but its observation is\nchallenging both in term of sensitivity requirement and control of systematic\neffects, including the removal of contaminants. In this paper we report\nresolved observations, at 150 and 260 GHz, of the SZ effect toward the triple\nmerger MACS J0717.5+3745 (z=0.55), using data obtained with the NIKA camera at\nthe IRAM 30m telescope. Assuming that the SZ signal is the sum of a thermal\n(tSZ) and a kinetic (kSZ) component and by combining the two NIKA bands, we\nextract for the first time a resolved map of the kSZ signal in a cluster. The\nkSZ signal is dominated by a dipolar structure that peaks at -5.1 and +3.4\nsigma, corresponding to two subclusters moving respectively away and toward us\nand coincident with the cold dense X-ray core and a hot region undergoing a\nmajor merging event. We model the gas electron density and line-of-sight\nvelocity of MACS J0717.5+3745 as four subclusters.

Interestingly, the gamma-ray spectrum of the point-like source (HESS\nJ1745-290) in the Galactic Center shows a cutoff at ~10 TeV, implying a cutoff\naround 100 TeV in the cosmic-ray proton spectrum. Here we propose that the\ngamma-ray emission from the inner and the outer regions may be explained\nself-consistently by run-away protons from a single, yet fading accelerator. In\nthis model, gamma rays from the CMZ region are produced by protons injected in\nthe past, while gamma rays from the inner region are produced by protons\ninjected more recently. We suggest that the blast wave formed in a tidal\ndisruption event (TDE) caused by the supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) could\nserve as such a fading accelerator. With typical parameters of the TDE blast\nwave, gamma-ray spectra of both the CMZ region and HESS J1745-290 can be\nreproduced simultaneously. Meanwhile, we find that the cosmic-ray energy\ndensity profile in the CMZ region may also be reproduced in the fading\naccelerator model when appropriate combinations of the particle injection\nhistory and the diffusion coefficient of cosmic rays are adopted. \n\n"}

Physical properties derived from spectral energy\n  distributions Abstract: We characterise the physical nature of a 1.1 mm-selected, flux-limited, and\ninterferometrically followed up sample of SMGs in COSMOS. We used the MAGPHYS\ncode to fit the multiwavelength (UV-radio) SEDs of 16 of the target SMGs. We\nalso constructed the pure radio SEDs of our SMGs using three different radio\nbands (325 MHz, 1.4 GHz, and 3 GHz). Moreover, since two SMGs in our sample,\nAzTEC1 and AzTEC3, benefit from previous CO line observations, we studied their\nproperties in more detail. We found that 63% of our target SMGs lie above the\ngalaxy main-sequence by more than a factor of 3, and hence are starbursts. The\n3 GHz radio sizes we have previously measured for the target SMGs were compared\nwith the present stellar mass estimates, and we found that the z>3 SMGs are\nfairly consistent with the mass-size relationship of z~2 compact, quiescent\ngalaxies (cQGs). The median IR-radio correlation parameter is found to be\nq=2.27, which is lower than measured locally (median q=2.64). AzTEC1 is found\nto have a sub-Eddington SFR surface density (by a factor of 2.6), while AzTEC3\nappears to be an Eddington-limited starburster. The gas reservoir in these two\nhigh-z SMGs would be exhausted in only ~86 and 19 Myr at the current SFR,\nrespectively. A comparison of the MAGPHYS-based properties of our SMGs with\nthose of equally bright ALESS SMGs suggests that the two populations share\nfairly similar physical characteristics, including the q parameter. A hint of\nnegative correlation is found between the 3 GHz size and the level of\nstarburstiness, and hence cosmic-ray electrons in more compact starbursts might\nbe more susceptible to free-free absorption. Some of the derived low and high q\nvalues (compared to the local median) could be the result of a specific\nmerger/post-starburst phase of galaxy evolution. Overall, our results support\nthe scenario where z>3 SMGs evolve into today's giant ellipticals. \n\n"}

The mechanisms\nmaintaining the strong winds in the cloud region were found in the model\nresults to be a combination of zonal mean circulation, thermal tides and\ntransient waves.

At the HC strong coupling scale, the classical-scale\ninvariance assumed in the model is dynamically broken as well as the \"chiral\"\nsymmetry present in the HC sector. In addition to the composite Higgs, HC\nbaryons emerge to potentially be stable because of the unbroken HC baryon\nnumber symmetry. Hence the lightest HC baryon can be a DM candidate. Of\ninterest in the present scenario is that HC pions can be as heavy as the HC\nbaryon due to the possibly enhanced-explicit \"chiral\"-breaking effect triggered\nafter the BS mechanism, so the HC baryon pair cannot annihilate into HC pions.\nAs in the standard setup of freeze-in scenario, it is assumed that the DM was\nnever in the thermal equilibrium, which ends up with no thermal abundance. It\nis then the non-thermal BSP process that crucially comes into the game below\nthe HC scale: the HC baryon significantly couples to the standard-model Higgs\nvia the BS mechanism, and can non-thermally be produced from the thermal plasma\nbelow the HC scale, which turns out to allow the TeV mass scale for the\ncomposite baryonic DM, much smaller than the generic bound placed in the\nconventional thermal freeze-out scenario, to account for the observed relic\nabundance.

Moreover, these combinations of Lagrangians precisely appear when\nexpressing in our basis the constraints of the recently proposed Extended\nScalar-Tensor (EST) theories. These results allow us to classify the different\norbits of scalar-tensor theories invariant under particular disformal\ntransformations, namely the special disformal, kinetic disformal and disformal\nHorndeski orbits.

We study the chemical structure of NGC 1333 IRAS 4A in order to (i)\ninvestigate the influence of the outflows on the chemistry, (ii) constrain the\nage of our object, (iii) compare it with a typical high-mass protostellar\nenvelope. In our analysis we use JCMT line mapping and HIFI pointed spectra. To\nstudy the influence of the outflow on the degree of deuteration, we compare\nJCMT maps of HCO+ and DCO+ with non-LTE (RADEX) models in a region that\nspatially covers the outflow activity of IRAS 4A. To study the envelope\nchemistry, we derive empirical molecular abundance profiles for the observed\nspecies using the radiative transfer code (RATRAN) and adopting a 1D dust\ndensity/temperature profile from the literature. We compare our best-fit\nobserved abundance profiles with the predictions from the time dependent gas\ngrain chemical code (ALCHEMIC). The CO, HCN, HNC and CN abundance require an\nenhanced UV field which points towards an outflow cavity. The abundances (wrt\nH2) are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than those observed in the high mass\nprotostellar envelope (AFGL 2591), while they are found to be similar within\nfactors of a few with respect to CO.

In the model the gas is in vertical pressure and energy\nbalance. Star formation feedback injects energy and momentum, and\nnon-axisymmetric torques prevent the gas from becoming more than marginally\ngravitationally unstable. From these assumptions we derive the relationship\nbetween galaxies' bulk properties (gas surface density, stellar content, and\nrotation curve) and their star formation rates, gas velocity dispersions, and\nrates of radial inflow. We show that the turbulence in discs can be powered\nprimarily by star formation feedback, radial transport, or a combination of the\ntwo. In contrast to models that omit either radial transport or star formation\nfeedback, the predictions of this model yield excellent agreement with a wide\nrange of observations, including the star formation law measured in both\nspatially resolved and unresolved data, the correlation between galaxies' star\nformation rates and velocity dispersions, and observed rates of radial inflow.\nThe agreement holds across a wide range of galaxy mass and type, from local\ndwarfs to extreme starbursts to high-redshifts discs. We apply the model to\ngalaxies on the star-forming main sequence, and show that it predicts a\ntransition from mostly gravity-driven turbulence at high redshift to star\nformation-driven turbulence at low redshift. This transition, and the changes\nin mass transport rates that it produces, naturally explain why galaxy bulges\ntend to form at high redshift and discs at lower redshift, and why galaxies\ntend to quench inside-out. \n\n"}

These are dark matter halo\nabundance at high redshifts, satellite galaxy abundance in the Milky Way, and\nfluctuation in the 21-cm radiation background before the epoch of reionization.\nThe thermal inflation scenario leaves a characteristic signature on the matter\npower spectrum by boosting the amplitude at a specific wavenumber determined by\nthe number of e-foldings during thermal inflation ($N_{\\rm bc}$), and strongly\nsuppressing the amplitude for modes at smaller scales. For a reasonable range\nof parameter space, one of the consequences is the suppression of minihalo\nformation at high redshifts and that of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way.\nWhile this effect is substantial, it is degenerate with other cosmological or\nastrophysical effects.

In fact, the detection of such a\nrelic would bring us information from the pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)\nperiod, an epoch from which we have no data, and could even hint at\ninflationary physics. In this work, we assume that the expansion rate of the\nUniverse after inflationary is governed by the kinetic energy of a scalar field\n$\\phi$, in the so-called \"kination\" model. We assume that the $\\phi$ field\ndecays into both radiation and DM particles, which we take to be Weakly\nInteracting Massive Particles (WIMPs). The present abundance of WIMPs is then\nfixed during the kination period through either a thermal \"freeze-out\" or\n\"freeze-in\" mechanism, or through a non-thermal process governed by the decay\nof $\\phi$. We explore the parameter space of this theory with the requirement\nthat the present WIMP abundance provides the correct DM relic budget.

Current knowledge of the GMF is limited, as most experimental\nmeasurements track line-of-sight--integrated quantities that are used to obtain\nbest-fit parameters for global models including a large random component. The\nadvent, however, of the Gaia era, with measurements of $\\sim 10^9$ stellar\nparallaxes, in combination with upcoming large polarimetric surveys, make, for\nthe first time, a 3D measurement of the GMF possible in principle. Such\nmeasurements can then be used to attempt a reconstruction of the trajectories\nof individual UHECRs through the Galaxy, in order to correct for their\ndeflection.\n  Motivated by these developments, in the present work, we study the limits of\nsuch a correction, by examining how its effectiveness depends on the\nuncertainty of any such future magnetic field measurements.

Trained and tested on two sets of 500 simulated 1 deg x 1 deg MeerKAT\nimages with a total of 300,000 sources, DeepSource is essentially perfect in\nboth purity and completeness down to SNR = 4 and outperforms PyBDSF in all\nmetrics. For uniformly-weighted images it achieves a Purity x Completeness (PC)\nscore at SNR = 3 of 0.73, compared to 0.31 for the best PyBDSF model. For\nnatural-weighting we find a smaller improvement of ~40% in the PC score at SNR\n= 3. If instead we ask where either of the purity or completeness first drop to\n90%, we find that DeepSource reaches this value at SNR = 3.6 compared to the\n4.3 of PyBDSF (natural-weighting). A key advantage of DeepSource is that it can\nlearn to optimally trade off purity and completeness for any science case under\nconsideration.

Hotspots on the star are not responsible for the majority of\nobserved light variations. Instead, we found that the long periodic family of\n10.5-11.4 d (presumably) quasi-periods showing light variations up to 0.07 mag\nmay arise owing to the rotational revolution of disc inhomogeneities located\nbetween 16-20 solar radii. The same distance is obtained by assuming that these\nlight variations arise because of a purely Keplerian revolution of these\ninhomogeneities for a stellar mass of 0.7 solar mass. The short-periodic\n(3-1.38 d) small amplitude (0.01 mag) light variations show a clear sign of\nperiod shortening, similar to what was discovered in the first MOST\nobservations of FU Ori.

Results obtained for the long-periodic 10-11 d family of light\nvariations appear to be roughly in line with the colour-period relation, which\nassumes that longer periods are produced by more external and cooler parts of\nthe disc. Coordinated observations in a broad spectral range are still\nnecessary to fully understand the nature of the short-periodic 1-3 d family of\nlight variations and their period changes. \n\n"}

Although large\ncarbon-bearing molecules have been proposed as the carriers producing DIBs,\ntheir identity remains unknown. The sight line to the young massive\nstar-forming region M17 shows anomalous extinction in the sense that the\ntotal-to-selective extinction parameter differs significantly from the average\nGalactic value and may reach values $R_{V} > 4$. Given the high $R_V$ values,\nwe investigate whether the DIBs in sight lines towards young OB stars in M17\nshow a peculiar behaviour. We measure the properties of the most prominent DIBs\nin M17 and study these as a function of $E(B-V)$ and $R_{V}$. The DIB strengths\nin M17 concur with the observed relations between DIB equivalent width and\nreddening $E(B-V)$ in Galactic sight lines. For several DIBs we discover a\nlinear relation between the normalised DIB strength EW/$A_{V}$ and\n$R_{V}^{-1}$. These trends suggest two groups: (i) a group of ten moderately\nstrong DIBs that show a sensitivity to changes in $R_{V}$ that is modest and\nproportional to DIB strength, and (ii) a group of four very strong DIBs that\nreact sensitively and to a similar degree to changes in $R_{V}$, but in a way\nthat does not appear to depend on DIB strength.

We restrict\nour analysis to those EFT functions which do not modify the speed of\npropagation of gravitational waves.

Recent stellar evolution models indicate\nthat radiative burning of C13 between thermal pulses in low-mass AGB stars may\nindeed provide the needed neutrons. Some mixing between the proton-rich\nenvelope and the carbon-rich core may lead to the production of C13. However,\nthe responsible physical mechanism is not yet unambiguously identified. We\npresent stellar model calculations with overshoot and rotation. Overshoot, with\na time-dependent and exponentially decaying efficiency, leads to a partial\nmixture of protons and C12 during the third dredge-up. According to the\ndepth-dependent ratio of protons and C12, a small C13-pocket forms underneath a\nN14-rich layer. Overshoot does not allow for any mixing during the interpulse\nphase. Rotation introduces mixing driven by large angular velocity gradients\nwhich form at the envelope-core interface in AGB stars, in particular after a\nthermal pulse. This leads to partial mixing after a pulse, as in the case of\novershoot. However, rotation continues to mix the region of the C13-pocket with\na diffusion coefficient of log D ~ 2...3 [cm**2 / s]. This does not only spread\nthe C13-pocket, but also the more massive N14-rich layer, and finally leads to\nmixture of both layers. By the time when the temperature there has risen to\nabout 9*10E7K and neutron production sets in, the N14 abundance exceeds the C13\nabundance by a factor of 5...10. We analyze the role of N14 as a neutron poison\nby considering the recycling of neutrons via N14(n,p)C14 and\nC12(p,gamma)N13(beta+)C13 qualitatively.

In this paper we consider four proposed binary star progenitors of\nGRBs: double neutron star (NS-NS), black hole neutron star (BH-NS), black hole\nwhite dwarf (BH-WD) mergers and Helium star mergers (He-BH). Helium star\nmergers are a possible outcome of common envelope evolution of a compact object\nentering the envelope of a giant with a helium core.\n  Using population synthesis we calculate number of the binary progenitors and\nshow that BH-WD and Helium star mergers dominate population of the proposed\nbinary progenitors.

In order to explore the\norigin of these subluminous stars, we evolved a set of low-mass stars from the\nmain sequence through the helium-core flash to the HB for a wide range in the\nmass loss along the red-giant branch (RGB). Stars with the largest mass loss\nevolve off the RGB to high effective temperatures before igniting helium in\ntheir cores. Our results indicate that the subluminous EHB stars, as well as\nthe gap within the EHB of NGC 2808, can be explained if these stars undergo a\nlate helium-core flash on the white-dwarf cooling curve. Under these conditions\nthe flash convection will penetrate into the stellar envelope, thereby mixing\nmost, if not all, of the envelope hydrogen into the hot helium- burning\ninterior. This phenomenon is analogous to the \"born-again\" scenario for\nproducing hydrogen-deficient stars during a very late helium-shell flash.\n\"Flash mixing\" greatly enhances the envelope helium and carbon abundances and,\nas a result, leads to an abrupt increase in the HB effective temperature. We\nargue that the EHB gap in NGC 2808 is caused by this theoretically predicted\ndichotomy in the HB morphology. Using new helium- and carbon-rich stellar\natmospheres, we show that the flash-mixed stars have the same reduced UV flux\nas the subluminous EHB stars. Moreover, we demonstrate that models without\nflash mixing lie, at most, ~0.1 mag below the EHB and hence fail to explain the\nobservations. Flash mixing may also provide a new evolutionary channel for\nproducing the high gravity, He-rich sdO and sdB stars. \n\n"}

We extend previous discussions on the trispectrum and associated weak\nlensing reconstruction from CMB data by calculating non-Gaussian noise\ncontributions, beyond the previously discussed dominant Gaussian noise.\nNon-Gaussian noise contributions are generated by lensing itself and by the\ncorrelation between the lensing effect and other foreground secondary\nanisotropies in the CMB such as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. When the SZ\neffect is removed from temperature maps using its spectral dependence, we find\nthese additional non-Gaussian noise contributions to be an order of magnitude\nlower than the dominant Gaussian noise. If the noise-bias due to the dominant\nGaussian part of the temperature squared power spectrum is removed, then these\nadditional non-Gaussian contributions provide the limiting noise level for the\nlensing reconstruction. The temperature squared power spectrum allows a high\nsignal-to-noise extraction of the lensing deflections and a confusion-free\nseparation of the curl (or B-mode) polarization due to inflationary\ngravitational waves from that due to lensed gradient (or E-mode) polarization.\nThe small angular scale temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements\nprovide a novel approach to weak lensing studies, complementing the approach\nbased on galaxy ellipticities. \n\n"}

We discuss how to overcome the limitations imposed by the\nsubmillimetre atmosphere. Novel ways to improve line-of-sight opacity estimates\nare presented, resulting in tight relations between opacities at different\nwavelengths. The submillimetre camera SCUBA, mounted on the JCMT, is the first\nlarge-scale submillimetre array, and as such is ideal for combatting the\neffects of the atmosphere. For example, we find that the off-source pixels are\ncrucial for removing sky-noise. Benefitting from several years of SCUBA\noperation, a database of deep SCUBA observations has been constructed to better\nunderstand the nature of sky-noise and the effects of the atmosphere on\ninstrument sensitivity. This has revealed several results. Firstly, there is\nevidence for positive correlations between sky-noise and seeing and sky-noise\nand sky opacity. Furthermore, 850-micron and 450-micron sky-noise are clearly\ncorrelated, suggesting that 450-micron data may be used to correct 850-micron\nobservations for sky-noise. Perhaps most important of all: if off-source\nbolometers are used for sky-noise removal, there is no correlation between\ninstrument sensitivity and chop throw, for chop throws out to 180 arcsec.\nUnderstanding the effects of submillimetre seeing is also important, and we\nfind that the JCMT beam is not significantly broadened by seeing, nor is there\nan obvious correlation between seeing and pointing excursions. \n\n"}

Our model is based on\nthe assumptions that quasar emission is triggered by galaxy mergers, and that\nthe black hole mass is proportional to a power-law in the circular velocity v\nof the host galactic halo. We assume that quasars shine at their Eddington\nluminosity over a time proportional to the mass ratio between the small and\nfinal galaxies in the merger. This simple model fits the quasar luminosity\nfunction at z~2-3, reproduces the normalization and logarithmic slope (beta\n-2.58) at z~4.3, explains the space density of bright SDSS quasars at z~6.0,\nreproduces the black hole - halo mass relation for dormant black holes in the\nlocal universe, and matches the estimated duty cycle of quasar activity (~10^7\nyears) in Lyman-break galaxies at z~3.

The large scale and regular\nspacing of the filaments suggests that small-scale turbulence is of limited\nimportance, which could be consistent with driving on large scales by flows\nwhich produced the cloud. The small spatial dispersion of stars from gaseous\nfilaments indicates that the low-mass stars are generally born with small\nvelocity dispersions relative to their natal gas, of order the sound speed or\nless. The spatial distribution of the stars exhibits a mean separation of about\n0.25 pc, comparable to the estimated Jeans length in the densest gaseous\nfilaments, and is consistent with roughly uniform density along the filaments.\nThe efficiency of star formation in filaments is much higher than elsewhere,\nwith an associated higher frequency of protostars and accreting T Tauri stars.\nThe protostellar cores generally are aligned with the filaments, suggesting\nthat they are produced by gravitational fragmentation, resulting in initially\nquasi-prolate cores.

By treating the accretion shock as a hotspot on the stellar\nsurface we show that Lyman continuum photons are produced at a rate\napproximately three orders of magnitude lower than that produced by a\ncorresponding black body, and that a strong Lyman continuum is only emitted for\nhigh mass accretion rates. When our models are extended to include a column of\nmaterial accreting on to the hotspot we find that the accretion column is\nextremely optically thick to Lyman continuum photons. Further, we find that\nradiative recombination of hydrogen atoms within the column is not an efficient\nmeans of producing photons with energies greater than 13.6eV, and find that an\naccretion column of any conceivable height suppresses the emission of Lyman\ncontinuum photons to a level below or comparable to that expected from the\nstellar photosphere. The photospheric Lyman continuum is itself much too weak\nto affect disc evolution significantly, and we find that the Lyman continuum\nemitted by an accretion shock is similarly unable to influence disc evolution\nsignificantly. This result has important consequences for models which use\nphotoionisation as a mechanism to drive the dispersal of circumstellar discs,\nessentially proving that an additional source of Lyman continuum photons must\nexist if disc photoionisation is to be significant. \n\n"}

First, we find that a hydromagnetic (MHD)\ncoupling between the crust and the core strongly modifies the star's\nprecessional modes when $t_a\\le\\sim (T_s\\times T_p)^{1/2}$; here $t_a$ is the\nAlfven crossing timescale, and $T_s$ and $T_p$ are the star's spin and\nprecession periods, respectively. We argue that in a precessing pulsar PSR\nB1828-11 the restoring MHD stress prevents a free wobble of the crust relative\nto the non-precessing core. Instead, the crust and the proton-electron plasma\nin the core must precess in unison, and their combined ellipticity determines\nthe period of precession. Link has recently shown that the neutron superfluid\nvortices in the core of PSR B1828-11 cannot be pinned to the plasma; he has\nalso argued that this lack of pinning is expected if the proton Fermi liquid in\nthe core is type-I superconductor. In this case, the neutron superfluid is\ndynamically decoupled from the precessing motion. The pulsar's precession\ndecays due to the mutual friction between the neutron superfluid and the plasma\nin the core. The decay is expected to occur over tens to hundreds of precession\nperiods and may be measurable over a human lifetime. Such a measurement would\nprovide information about the strong n-p interaction in the neutron-star core.\nSecond, we consider the effect of gravitomagnetic coupling between the neutron\nsuperfluid in the core and the rest of the star and show that this coupling\nchanges the rate of precession by about 10%.

We have re-examined the EUVE data on this cluster in an attempt\nto obtain clues as to the origin of this emission. We find two important new\nresults. First, the ratio between the azimuthally averaged EUV excess emission\nand the ROSAT hard X-ray flux is constant as a function of distance from the\ncluster center outward. Second, a correlation analysis between the EUV excess\nemission and the X-ray emission shows that on a detailed level the EUV excess\nis spatially closely related to the X-ray emission. These findings contradict\nprevious suggestions as to the underlying source of the diffuse EUV emission in\nComa and provide important information in regards to the true source of this\nemission.

The parent cosmic\nray protons may have been produced by any of a number of sources, including\nsupernovae, active galaxies, galactic winds, and cluster formation shocks, but\nwe believe that the most likely source is cluster formation shocks.

Using our models of absorption line indices that account for variable\nabundance ratios, we derive the stellar population parameters of 124 early-type\ngalaxies in high and low density environments. We find that all three\nparameters age, metallicity, and alpha/Fe ratio are correlated with velocity\ndispersion. We further find evidence for an influence of the environment on the\nstellar population properties. Massive early-type galaxies in low-density\nenvironments appear on average ~2 Gyrs younger and slightly more metal-rich\nthan their counterparts in high density environments. No offsets in the\nalpha/Fe ratios, instead, are detected. We translate the derived ages and\nalpha/Fe ratios into star formation histories. We show that most star formation\nactivity in early-type galaxies is expected to have happened between redshifts\n3 and 5 in high density and between redshifts 1 and 2 in low density\nenvironments. We conclude that at least 50 per cent of the total stellar mass\ndensity must have already formed at z 1, in good agreement with observational\nestimates of the total stellar mass density as a function of redshift. Our\nresults suggest that significant mass growth in the early-type galaxy\npopulation below z 1 must be restricted to less massive objects, and a\nsignificant increase of the stellar mass density between redshifts 1 and 2\nshould be present caused mainly by the field galaxy population.

This is shown to be true irrespective of the\ngalaxy redshift distribution, provided that one uses the same galaxies for the\ntwo correlation functions. The method is applicable to all redshifts. Here, we\nfocus on z=3 DLAs and we demonstrate that the method robustly constrains the\nmean DLA halo mass using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) cosmological\nsimulations. If we use the bias formalism of Mo & White with the DLA and galaxy\nmass distributions of these simulations, we predict a bias ratio of 0.771.\nDirect measurement from the simulations of $w_{\\rm dg}/w_{\\rm gg}$ st yields a\nratio of 0.73+/-0.08, in excellent agreement with that prediction.\nEquivalently, inverting the measured correlation ratio to infer a mean DLA halo\nmass yields (log. averaging, in solar units) <log(M_DLA)> =11.13+/-013, in\nexcellent agreement with the true value in the simulations: 11.16. The cross-\ncorrelation method thus appears to yield a robust estimate of the average host\nhalo mass even though the DLAs and the galaxies occupy a broad mass spectrum of\nhalos, and massive halos contain multiple galaxies with DLAs. We show that the\ninferred mean DLA halo mass is independent of the galaxy sub-sample used, i.e.\nthe cross-correlation technique is also reliable.

When the mass accretion rate\nexceeds the critical rate, then the shape of the disk is geometrically thick\ndue to the enhanced radiation pressure. The model spectra of supercritical\naccretion flows strongly depend on the inclination angle. Because the outer\ndisk blocks the emission from the disk inner region for high inclination angle.\nWe also find that the spectral properties of low-inclination angle and low\naccretion-rate disks are very similar to those of high-inclination and high\naccretion rate disks.

The application of this distance indicator\nusually assumes that the cluster is spherically symmetric, the gas is\ndistributed according to the isothermal beta-model, and the X-ray temperature\nis an unbiased measure of the electron temperature. We test these assumptions\nwith galaxy clusters extracted from an extended set of cosmological\nN-body/hydrodynamical simulations of a LCDM concordance cosmology, which\ninclude the effect of radiative cooling, star formation and energy feedback\nfrom supernovae. We find that, due to the steep temperature gradients which are\npresent in the central regions of simulated clusters, the assumption of\nisothermal gas leads to a significant underestimate of D_A. This bias is\nefficiently corrected by using the polytropic version of the beta-model to\naccount for the presence of temperature gradients. In this case, once irregular\nclusters are removed, the correct value of D_A is recovered with a ~ 5 per cent\naccuracy on average, with a ~ 20 per cent intrinsic scatter due to cluster\nasphericity.

There are\ndifferent proposals for the explanation of this acceleration, such as the\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$, decaying vacuum energy, an evolving scalar\nfield (quintessence), phantom energy, etc. Most of these proposals require the\nexistence of exotic matter with negative pressure violating the strong energy\ncondition. On the other hand, there have appeared many models which offer\ndramatically different mechanisms for the current acceleration, in which dark\nenergy emerges from the gravity sector rather than from the matter sector. In\nthis paper, we compare the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model with the\nSahni-Shtanov brane-world models of dark energy by using the Akaike and\nBayesian information criteria. We show that new parameters in the brane model\nare not statistically significant in terms of the information criteria,\nalthough the best fit method gives an improved fit to the SNIa data, because of\nthe additional parameters.

Images taken at six different frequencies, from 2.3 to 43\nGHz, reveal a spiral-like trajectory, which is likely a sign of an intrinsic\nhelical geometry. A space-VLBI image, taken with the HALCA satellite at 5 GHz\nand having comparable resolution to our ground-based 15 GHz data, confirms that\nthe bend is a frequency-independent structure. VLBA monitoring data at 15 GHz,\ncovering eight years of observations, show knots in the jet clearly deviating\nfrom ballistic motion, which suggests that the bending may be caused by a\ngrowing helical Kelvin-Helmholtz normal mode. The jet appearance suggests a\nhelical wave at a frequency well below the \"resonant\" frequency of the jet,\nwhich indicates that the wave is driven by a periodic perturbation at the base\nof the jet.

Our results\nindicate that: (i) the observed increase of the SN rate per unit luminosity and\nunit mass from early to late galaxy types is accounted for by our models. Our\nexplanation of this effect is related to the fact that the latest Hubble types\nhave the highest star formation rate per unit mass; (ii) By adopting a Scalo\n(1986) initial mass function in spiral disks, we find that massive single stars\nending their lives as Wolf-Rayet objects are not sufficient to account for the\nobserved type Ib/c SN rate per unit mass.

Such an evaluation depends on the geometry of\nthe BLR. There are two major options for the BLR configuration: spherically\nsymmetric or ``flattened''. In the latter case the inclination to the line of\nsight becomes a relevant parameter. This paper is devoted to evaluate the bias\non the estimate of the Eddington ratio when a spherical geometry is assumed\n(more generally when inclination effects are ignored), while the actual\nconfiguration is ``flattened'', as some evidence suggests. This is done as a\nfunction of luminosity and redshift, on the basis of recent results which show\nthe existence of a correlation between the fraction of obscured AGN and these\ntwo parameters up to at least z=2.5. The assumed BLR velocity field is akin to\nthe ``generalized thick disk'' proposed by Collin et al. (2006). Assuming an\nisotropic orientation in the sky, the mean value of the bias is calculated as a\nfunction of luminosity and redshift. It is demonstrated that, on average, the\nEddington ratio obtained assuming a spherical geometry is underestimated for\nhigh luminosities, and overestimated for low luminosities.

We demonstrate that skewness in redshifted 21cm maps\nshould be substantial throughout the reionisation epoch and on all angular\nscales, owing to the effects of galaxy bias which leads to early reionisation\nin over-dense regions of the IGM. The variance (or power-spectrum) of 21cm\nfluctuations will exhibit a minimum in redshift part way through the\nreionisation process, when the global ionisation fraction is around 50%. This\nminimum is generic, and is due to the transition from 21cm intensity being\ndominated by over-dense too under-dense regions as reionisation progresses.

The CO detection rate is 12/43 or 28%. This is\nlower than previous studies of early-types but can probably be attributed to\ndifferent sample selection criteria. As expected, earlier type, more luminous\nand massive galaxies have a relatively lower molecular gas content. We find\nthat CO-rich galaxies tend to have higher H\\beta but lower Fe5015 and Mgb\nabsorption indices than CO-poor galaxies. Those trends appear primarily driven\nby the age of the stars, an hypothesis supported by the fact that the galaxies\nwith the strongest evidence of star formation are also the most CO-rich. In\nfact, the early-type galaxies from the current sample appear to extend the\nwell-known correlations between FIR luminosity, dust mass and molecular mass of\nother galaxy types.

It is\nassumed that metals are ejected out of disk galaxies during supernova\nexplosions and these metals enter the hot gas component. The fact that metals\nare more easily ejected from small galaxies leads to the establishment of a\nmass-metallicity relation for the disk systems. Big ellipticals are more metal\nrich because they are formed from the mergers of bigger disks. We use\nsemi-analytic techniques to follow the formation, evolution, and chemical\nenrichment of cluster ellipticals in a merging hierarchy of dark matter halos.\nThe inclusion of the new metallicity-dependent spectral synthesis models of\nBruzual & Charlot allow us to compute the colours, line indices and mass-to-\nlight ratios of these galaxies.

Abstract: The magnitude-redshift relation is one of the tools for a direct\nobservational approach to cosmology. The discovery of high redshift Type Ia\nsupernovae (SNIa) and their use as ``standard candles'' has resurrected\ninterest in this approach. Recently collected data have been used to address\nthe problem of measuring the cosmological parameters of the universe. Analysed\nin the framework of homogeneous models, they have yielded, as a primary result,\na strictly positive cosmological constant. However, a straight reading of the\npublished measurements, conducted with no a priori idea of which model would\nbest describe our universe at least up to redshifts $z\\sim 1$, does not exclude\nthe possibility of ruling out the Cosmological Principle - and cosmological\nconstant - hypotheses.

An exemple of an\ninhomogeneous model with zero cosmological constant reproducing the current\nobservations is given.

Since many observations of galaxy\nclustering will be done at high redshift, the time evolution of non-linear\nstochastic biasing would play a crucial role for the data analysis of the\nfuture sky surveys. In this paper, we develop the weakly non-linear analysis\nand attempt to clarify the non-linear feature of the stochastic biasing. We\ncompute the one-loop correction of the power spectrum for the total mass, the\ngalaxies and their cross correlation. Assuming the local functional form for\nthe initial galaxy distribution, we investigate the time evolution of the\nbiasing parameter and the correlation coefficient. On large scales, we first\nfind that the time evolution of the biasing parameter could deviate from the\nlinear prediction in presence of the initial skewness. However, the deviation\ncan be reduced when the initial stochasticity exists. Next, we focus on the\nquasi-linear scales, where the non-linear growth of the total mass becomes\nimportant.

The\neffective 4D Einstein equations for the scalar cosmological perturbations on\nthe brane are obtained by solving the perturbations in the bulk. Then the\nbehaviour of the corrections induced by the bulk gravitational field to the\nconventional 4D Einstein equation are determined. Two types of the corrections\nare found. First we investigate the corrections which become significant at\nscales below the AdS curvature scales and in the high energy universe with the\nenergy density larger than the tension of the brane. The evolution equation for\nthe perturbations on the brane is found and solved. Another type of the\ncorrections is induced on the brane if we consider the bulk perturbations which\ndo not contribute to the metric perturbations but do contribute to the matter\nperturbations. At low energies, they have imaginary mass $m^2=-(2/3) \\k^2$ in\nthe bulk where $\\k$ is the 3D comoving wave number of the perturbations. They\ndiverge at the horizon of the AdS spacetime. The induced density perturbations\nbehave as sound waves with sound velocity $1/\\sqrt{3}$ in the low energy\nuniverse. At large scales, they are homogeneous perturbations that depend only\non time and decay like radiation. They can be identified as the perturbations\nof the dark radiation. They produce isocurvature perturbations in the matter\ndominated era. Their effects can be observed as the shifts of the location and\nthe height of the acoustic peak in the CMB spectrum. \n\n"}

Abstract: To describe a massive graviton in 4D Minkowski space-time one introduces a\nquadratic term in the Lagrangian. This term, however, can lead to a\nreadjustment or instability of the background instead of describing a massive\ngraviton on flat space. We show that for all local Lorentz-invariant mass terms\nMinkowski space is unstable. We start with the Pauli-Fierz (PF) term that is\nthe only local mass term with no ghosts in the linearized approximation. We\nshow that nonlinear completions of the PF Lagrangian give rise to instability\nof Minkowski space. We continue with the mass terms that are not of a PF type.\nAlthough these models are known to have ghosts in the linearized\napproximations, nonlinear interactions can lead to background change due to\nwhich the ghosts are eliminated. In the latter case, however, the graviton\nperturbations on the new background are not massive. We argue that a consistent\ntheory of a massive graviton on flat space can be formulated in theories with\nextra dimensions.

{"id": "hep-th/0402047", "contents": "Title: Volume Stabilization and the Origin of the Inflaton Shift Symmetry in\n  String Theory Abstract: The main problem of inflation in string theory is finding the models with a\nflat potential, consistent with stabilization of the volume of the compactified\nspace. This can be achieved in the theories where the potential has (an\napproximate) shift symmetry in the inflaton direction. We will identify a class\nof models where the shift symmetry uniquely follows from the underlying\nmathematical structure of the theory. It is related to the symmetry properties\nof the corresponding coset space and the period matrix of special geometry,\nwhich shows how the gauge coupling depends on the volume and the position of\nthe branes. In particular, for type IIB string theory on K3xT^2/Z with D3 or D7\nmoduli belonging to vector multiplets, the shift symmetry is a part of\nSO(2,2+n) symmetry of the coset space [SU(1,1)/ U(1)]x[SO(2,2+n)/(SO(2)x\nSO(2+n)]. The absence of a prepotential, specific for the stringy version of\nsupergravity, plays a prominent role in this construction, which may provide a\nviable mechanism for the accelerated expansion and inflation in the early\nuniverse. \n\n"}

The variant of this widely-discussed notion\nconsidered here is suggested by the Brandenberger-Vafa picture for why we\nperceive three spatial dimensions. In this picture there may be at least two\nspecies of dark matter particles, with scalar ``charges'' such that the scalar\ninteraction attracts particles with like sign and repels unlike signs. The net\ncharge vanishes. Under this condition the evolution of the mass distribution in\nlinear perturbation theory is the same as in the LambdaCDM cosmology, and both\nmodels therefore can equally well pass the available cosmological tests. The\nphysics can be very different on small scales, however: if the scalar\ninteraction has the strength suggested by simple versions of the string\nscenario, nonlinear mass concentrations are unstable against separation into\ncharged halos with properties unlike the standard model prediction and possibly\nof observational interest. \n\n"}
