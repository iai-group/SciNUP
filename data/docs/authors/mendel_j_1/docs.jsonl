We re-address the issue of\nthe Galactic metallicity gradient and its time evolution by comparing the\nempirical gradients traced by a sample of 45 open clusters with a chemical\nevolution model of the Galaxy.

GCs beginning their\nformation have an initial metallicity determined by the pre-enrichment of their\nsurrounding protocloud, but can also undergo internal self-enrichment during\nformation. Stochastic variations in metallicity arise because of the finite\nnumbers of supernova. We construct an analytic formulation of the combined\neffects of pre-enrichment and self-enrichment and use Monte Carlo models to\nverify that the model accurately encapsulates the mean metallicity and\nmetallicity spread among real GCs. The predicted metallicity spread due to\nself-enrichment alone, a robust prediction of the model, is much smaller than\nthe observed spread among real GCs. This result rules out self-enrichment as a\nsignificant contributor to the metal content in most GCs, leaving\npre-enrichment as the viable alternative. Self-enrichment can, however, be\nimportant for clusters with masses well above 10^6 Msun, which are massive\nenough to hold in a significant fraction of their SN ejecta even without any\nexternal pressure confinement.

AGN luminosities were estimated in two ways, always taking care to\nminimise photometric biases due to host galaxy light contamination. Firstly, we\nmeasured broad-band B_J (blue) magnitudes of the objects over small apertures\nof the size of the seeing disk. Secondly, we extracted H alpha and H beta broad\nemission line luminosities from the spectra which should be entirely free of\nany starlight contribution. The resulting AGN luminosity function (AGNLF) is\nconsistent with a single power law, also when considering the effects of number\ndensity evolution within the narrow redshift range. We compared our AGNLF with\nthe H alpha luminosity function of lower luminosity Seyfert 1 galaxies by Hao\net al.

From the combination of HES and SDSS\nsamples we constructed a single local AGNLF spanning more than 4 orders of\nmagnitude in luminosity.

The\npresence of baryons produces the concentration of the DM halo with respect to\nits corresponding dissipationless run, but we found that this response does not\nonly depend on the amount of baryons gathered in the central region but also on\nthe way they have been assembled.

The temperature of the warm dust\nin M31 varies between 56 and 60 K and is highest in the spiral arms; the\ntemperature of the cold component is mostly 15-19 K and rises up to about 25 K\nat the centre of the galaxy. The intensity-weighted mean temperature of the\ndust decreases from T ~32 K at the centre to T ~20 K at R ~7 kpc and outwards.\nWe also calculate the intrinsic UBVRIL surface brightness distributions and the\nspatial luminosity distribution. The intrinsic dust extinction in the V-colour\nrises from 0.25 mag at the centre to 0.4-0.5 mag at R = 6-13 kpc and decreases\nsmoothly thereafter.

As a result, the surface temperature of the star can become\nsignificantly higher than it is in the normal state resulting from\nthermonuclear burning.

To decide this, we calculate the optical depths for the\ngamma-ray photons in the radiation field of such irradiated star as a function\nof the phase of the binary system.

We identify significant\nsystematic effects in this procedure that can artificially induce an additional\ndiffuse component with a morphology strikingly similar to the claimed gamma-ray\nhaze. To quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of the\nratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density,\nand of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models\nand simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM\ntemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by\napproximately 20%. Additionally, the synchrotron template tends to\nunder-estimate the IC emission at low energies (few GeV) and to over-estimate\nit at higher energies (tens of GeV) by potentially large factors that depend\ncrucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the Galaxy. The size of\nthe systematic effects we find are comparable to the size of the claimed \"Fermi\nhaze\" signal.

We find that the backreaction of\nsmall-scale non-linearities is very small, being suppressed by the large\nhierarchy between the scale of non-linearities and the horizon scale. The\neffective pressure of the fluid is always positive and much too small to\nsignificantly affect the background evolution. Moreover, we prove that\nvirialized scales decouple completely from the large-scale dynamics, at all\norders in the post-Newtonian expansion. We propose that our effective theory be\nused to formulate a well-defined and controlled alternative to conventional\nperturbation theory, and we discuss possible observational applications.\nFinally, our way of reformulating results in second-order perturbation theory\nin terms of a long-wavelength effective fluid provides the opportunity to\nunderstand non-linear effects in a simple and physically intuitive way. \n\n"}

For late-type galaxies V_opt ~ V_200 over\nthe velocity range V_opt=90-260 km/s, and is consistent with V_opt = V_maxh\n(the maximum circular velocity of NFW dark matter haloes in the concordance\nLCDM cosmology). However, for early-type galaxies V_opt \\ne V_200, with the\nexception of early-type galaxies with V_opt simeq 350 km/s. This is\ninconsistent with early-type galaxies being, in general, globally isothermal.\nFor low mass (V_opt < 250 km/s) early-types V_opt > V_maxh, indicating that\nbaryons have modified the potential well, while high mass (V_opt > 400 km/s)\nearly-types have V_opt < V_maxh. Folding in measurements of the black hole mass\n- velocity dispersion relation, our results imply that the supermassive black\nhole - halo mass relation has a logarithmic slope which varies from ~1.4 at\nhalo masses of ~10^{12} Msun/h to ~0.65 at halo masses of 10^{13.5} Msun/h. The\nvalues of V_opt/V_200 we infer for the Milky Way and M31 are lower than the\nvalues currently favored by direct observations and dynamical models.

The metals carried by the\noutflows are generated by two separate stellar populations: stars located near\nthe central AGN, and stars located in the greater galaxy. Using this algorithm,\nwe performed a series of 5 simulations of the propagation of AGN-driven\noutflows in a cosmological volume of size (128/h Mpc)^3 in a Lambda-CDM\nuniverse, and analyze the resulting metal enrichment of the IGM. We found that\nthe metallicity induced in the IGM is greatly dominated by AGNs having\nbolometric luminosity L > 10^9 L_sun, sources with 10^8 < L / L_sun < 10^9\nhaving a negligible contribution. Our simulations produced an average IGM\nmetallicity of [O/H] = -5 at z = 5.5, which then rises gradually, and remains\nrelatively flat at a value [O/H] = -2.8 between z = 2 and z = 0.

We use 21-cm observations of HI as a tracer\nof thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of Galactic dust\nemission and use the 143 GHz Planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmic\nmicrowave background anisotropies. Both of these cleaning processes are\nnecessary to avoid significant contamination of the CIB signal. We measure\ncorrelated CIB structure across frequencies. As expected, the correlation\ndecreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution of\nhigh-redshift galaxies to CIB anisotropies increases with wavelengths. We find\nno significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the CIB\nanisotropies and the CIB mean, with Delta I/I=15% from 217 to 857 GHz. In terms\nof clustering properties, the Planck data alone rule out the linear scale- and\nredshift-independent bias model. Non-linear corrections are significant.\nConsequently, we develop an alternative model that couples a dusty galaxy,\nparametric evolution model with a simple halo-model approach. It provides an\nexcellent fit to the measured anisotropy angular power spectra and suggests\nthat a different halo occupation distribution is required at each frequency,\nwhich is consistent with our expectation that each frequency is dominated by\ncontributions from different redshifts. In our best-fit model, half of the\nanisotropy power at l=2000 comes from redshifts z<0.8 at 857 GHz and z<1.5 at\n545 GHz, while about 90% come from redshifts z>2 at 353 and 217 GHz,\nrespectively. \n\n"}

In this paper, the first in a series, we present and test a novel\nnumerical implementation of stellar feedback resulting from momentum imparted\nto the ISM by radiation, supernovae, and stellar winds. We employ a realistic\ncooling function, and find that a large fraction of the gas cools to <100K, so\nthat the ISM becomes highly inhomogeneous. Despite this, our simulated galaxies\nreach an approximate steady state, in which gas gravitationally collapses to\nform giant molecular clouds (GMCs), dense clumps, and stars; subsequently,\nstellar feedback disperses the GMCs, repopulating the diffuse ISM. This\ncollapse and dispersal cycle is seen in models of SMC-like dwarfs, the\nMilky-Way, and z~2 clumpy disk analogues. The simulated global star formation\nefficiencies are consistent with the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.\nMoreover, the star formation rates are nearly independent of the numerically\nimposed high-density star formation efficiency, density threshold, and density\nscaling. This is a consequence of the fact that, in our simulations, star\nformation is regulated by stellar feedback limiting the amount of very dense\ngas available for forming stars. In contrast, in simulations without stellar\nfeedback, i.e. under the action of only gravity and gravitationally-induced\nturbulence, the ISM experiences runaway collapse to very high densities. In\nthese simulations without feedback, the global star formation rates exceed\nobserved galactic star formation rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude,\ndemonstrating that stellar feedback is crucial to the regulation of star\nformation in galaxies. \n\n"}

The great length of the stream, and the likelihood that it does\nnot significantly intersect the disk of M31, means that it is unusually well\nsuited for a measurement of stream gaps and clumps along its length as a test\nfor the predicted thousands of dark matter sub-halos. The main result of this\npaper is that the density of the stream varies between zero and about three\ntimes the mean along its length on scales of 2 to 20 kpc. The probability that\nthe variations are random fluctuations in the star density is less than 10^-5.\nAs a control sample we search for density variations at precisely the same\nlocation in stars with metallicity higher than the stream, [Fe/H]=[0, -0.5] and\nfind no variations above the expected shot noise.

This sets the final star formation efficiency, SFEf.\nModels are run with various metallicities in the range Z/Zsol=[0.1,2]. We find\nthat the SFEf decreases strongly with increasing metallicity.The\nSFEf-metallicity relation is well described by a decaying exponential whose\nexact parameters depend weakly on the value of the core formation efficiency.\nWe find that there is almost no dependence of the SFEf-metallicity relation on\nthe clump mass. This is due to the fact that an increase (decrease) in the\nclump mass leads to an increase (decrease) in the feedback from OB stars which\nis opposed by an increase (decrease) in the gravitational potential of the\nclump.

Fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range of\nbulge fractions as spiral galaxies.

After initially considering radio loudnesses derived using total\nradio luminosities, we repeat the investigation using core radio luminosities\nonly, applying a previously established mass correction for these core\nluminosities. In both cases, for Eddington ratios < 1 per cent, Fanaroff-Riley\ntype I and broad-line radio galaxies are on average more radio-loud than\nSeyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. However, the\ndistribution of radio loudnesses for the mass-corrected, core-only sample is\nmuch narrower than that of the clearly bimodal total radio loudness\ndistribution. The advantages and disadvantages of using core- or lobe-dominated\nradio luminosity as a measure of instantaneous jet power are discussed.

We propose a simple prescription to infer the angular\nbispectrum from the power spectrum of point sources considering independent\npopulations of sources, with or without clustering. We test the accuracy of our\nprediction using publicly available all-sky simulations of radio and IR sources\nand find very good agreement. We further characterise the configuration\ndependence and the frequency behaviour of the IR and radio bispectra. We show\nthat the IR angular bispectrum peaks for squeezed triangles and that the\nclustering of IR sources enhances the bispectrum values by several orders of\nmagnitude at scales l \\sim 100. At 150 GHz the bispectrum of IR sources starts\nto dominate that of radio sources on large angular scales, and it dominates\nover the whole multipole range at 350 GHz. Finally, we compute the bias on f_NL\ninduced by radio and IR sources. We show that the positive bias induced by\nradio sources is significantly reduced by masking the sources. We also show,\nfor the first time, that the form of the IR bispectrum mimics a primordial\n'local' bispectrum f_NL. The IR sources produce a negative bias which becomes\nimportant for Planck-like resolution and at high frequencies (Delta f_NL ~ -6\nat 277 GHz and Delta f_NL \\sim -60-70 at 350 GHz). Most of the signal being due\nto the clustering of faint IR sources, the bias Delta f_NL^IR is not reduced by\nmasking sources above a flux limit and may, in some cases, even be increased\ndue to the reduction of the shot-noise term. \n\n"}

Three main basic ingredients enter the\nproblem influencing the total dust budget and the mixture of the dust grains:\nthe types and amounts of dust injected by AGB stars and SNae and the\naccretion/destruction processes of dust in the ISM. They govern the relative\nabundances of the gas and dust in the ISM.

The best\ntheoretical recipes available nowadays in literature to estimate the amount of\ndust produced by SNae and AGB stars have been discussed and for SNae compared\nto the observations to get clues on the problem. The condensation efficiencies\nhave been analyzed in the context of a classical chemical model of dust\nformation and evolution in the Solar Neighbourhood and Galactic Disk.

As an attempt to discriminate among several possible\nproduction scenarios, astrophysicists try to test the statistical isotropy of\nthe directions of arrival of these cosmic rays. At the highest energies, they\nare supposed to point toward their sources with good accuracy. However, the\nobservations are so rare that testing the distribution of such samples of\ndirectional data on the sphere is nontrivial. In this paper, we choose a\nnonparametric framework that makes weak hypotheses on the alternative\ndistributions and allows in turn to detect various and possibly unexpected\nforms of anisotropy. We explore two particular procedures. Both are derived\nfrom fitting the empirical distribution with wavelet expansions of densities.\nWe use the wavelet frame introduced by [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 38 (2006b) 574-594\n(electronic)], the so-called needlets. The expansions are truncated at scale\nindices no larger than some ${J^{\\star}}$, and the $L^p$ distances between\nthose estimates and the null density are computed. One family of tests (called\nMultiple) is based on the idea of testing the distance from the null for each\nchoice of $J=1,\\ldots,{J^{\\star}}$, whereas the so-called PlugIn approach is\nbased on the single full ${J^{\\star}}$ expansion, but with thresholded wavelet\ncoefficients. We describe the practical implementation of these two procedures\nand compare them to other methods in the literature. As alternatives to\nisotropy, we consider both very simple toy models and more realistic\nnonisotropic models based on Physics-inspired simulations. The Monte Carlo\nstudy shows good performance of the Multiple test, even at moderate sample\nsize, for a wide sample of alternative hypotheses and for different choices of\nthe parameter ${J^{\\star}}$. On the 69 most energetic events published by the\nPierre Auger Collaboration, the needlet-based procedures suggest statistical\nevidence for anisotropy. Using several values for the parameters of the\nmethods, our procedures yield $p$-values below 1%, but with uncontrolled\nmultiplicity issues. The flexibility of this method and the possibility to\nmodify it to take into account a large variety of extensions of the problem\nmake it an interesting option for future investigation of the origin of\nultrahigh energy cosmic rays. \n\n"}

Abstract: We explore the minimal conditions which enable the formation of\nmetal-enriched solar and sub-solar mass stars. We find that in the absence of\ndust grains, gas fragmentation occurs at densities nH ~ [10^4-10^5]cm^{-3} when\nthe metallicity exceeds Z ~ 10^{-4} Zsun. The resulting fragmentation masses\nare > 10 Msun. The inclusion of Fe and Si cooling does not affect the thermal\nevolution as this is dominated by molecular cooling even for metallicities as\nlarge as Z = 10^{-2} Zsun. The presence of dust is the key driver for the\nformation of low-mass stars. We focus on three representative core-collapse\nsupernova (SN) progenitors, and consider the effects of reverse shocks of\nincreasing strength: these reduce the depletion factors, fdep =\nMdust/(Mdust+Mmet), alter the shape of the grain size distribution function and\nmodify the relative abundances of grain species and of metal species in the gas\nphase. We find that the lowest metallicity at which fragmentation occurs is\nZ=10^{-6} Zsun for gas pre-enriched by the explosion of a 20 Msun primordial SN\n(fdep > 0.22) and/or by a 35 Msun, Z=10^{-4} Zsun SN (fdep > 0.26); it is ~ 1\ndex larger, when the gas is pre-enriched by a Z = 10^{-4} Zsun, 20 Msun SN\n(fdep > 0.04). Cloud fragmentation depends on the depletion factor and it is\nsuppressed when the reverse shock leads to a too large destruction of dust\ngrains.

We proved that the\nelectromagnetic field contributes at highest order to the nonlinear memory\neffect of gravitational waves, enlarging the permanent displacement of test\nmasses. In experiments like LISA or LIGO which measure distances of test\nmasses, the Christodoulou memory will manifest itself as a permanent\ndisplacement of these objects. It has been suggested to detect the\nChristodoulou memory effect using radio telescopes investigating small changes\nin pulsar's pulse arrival times. The latter experiments are based on\npresent-day technology and measure changes in frequency. In the present paper,\nwe study the electromagnetic Christodoulou memory effect and compute it for\nbinary neutron star mergers. These are typical sources of gravitational\nradiation.

A key to the\nsuccess of the simulations is a significant contribution to the spheroid from\nstars that formed in situ.

In\nthe present study we show that this component was primarily formed in a\nproto-disc at high redshift and was subsequently liberated from the disc by\ndynamical heating associated with mass accretion. As a consequence of its\norigin, the in situ component of the spheroid has different kinematics (namely\nnet prograde rotation with respect to the disc) than that of the spheroid\ncomponent built from the disruption of satellites. In addition, the in situ\ncomponent has a flattened distribution, that is due in part to its rotation.

We vary four parameters: the gas polytropic\nindex Gamma, its temperature at large radii T_xi, the DM logarithmic slope at\nlarge radii zeta and its concentration c_vir. When comparing the model to the\nobserved mass-temperature (M-T) relation of local clusters, our results are\nindependent of both T_xi and c_vir. We thus obtain constraints on Gamma, by\nfixing the DM profile, and on zeta, by fixing the gas profile. For an NFW DM\nprofile, we find that 6/5<Gamma<13/10, which is consistent with numerical\nsimulations and observations of individual clusters. Taking 6/5<Gamma<13/10\nallows the DM profile to be slightly steeper than the NFW profile at large\nradii. Upon including local groups, we constrain the mass-dependence of Gamma\nand the value of T_xi. Interestingly, with Gamma=6/5 and zeta=-3, we reproduce\nthe observed steepening/breaking of the M-T relation at low M, if 10^6\nK<T_xi<10^7 K, consistent with simulations and observations of the warm-hot\nintergalactic medium.

Our main results are the following: (1) For a\ngiven star formation efficiency f*, a more extended period of active star\nformation tends to produce a galactic wind that reaches a larger extent. If f*\nis sufficiently large, the energy deposited by the stars completely expels the\nISM. Eventually, the ISM is being replenished by mass loss from supernovae and\nstellar winds. (2) For galaxies with masses above 10^11 Msun, the material\nejected in the IGM always falls back onto the galaxy. Hence lower-mass galaxies\nare the ones responsible for enriching the IGM. (3) Stellar winds play a minor\nrole in the dynamical evolution of the galactic wind, because their energy\ninput is small compared to supernovae.

We describe our program to find eclipsing massive binaries\nin the Magellanic Clouds using photometry of regions rich in massive stars, and\nour spectroscopic follow-up to obtain radial velocities and orbits. Our\nphotometric campaign identified 48 early-type periodic variables, of which only\n15 (31%) were found as part of the microlensing surveys. Spectroscopy is now\ncomplete for 17 of these systems, and in this paper we present analysis of the\nfirst two, LMC 172231 and ST2-28, simple detached systems of late-type O dwarfs\nof relatively modest masses. Our orbit analysis yields very precise masses (2%)\nand we use tomography to separate the components and determine effective\ntemperatures by model fitting, necessary for determining accurate (0.05-0.07\ndex) bolometric luminosities in combination with the light-curve analysis. Our\napproach allows more precise comparisons with evolutionary theory than\npreviously possible. To our considerable surprise, we find a small, but\nsignificant, systematic discrepancy: all of the stars are slightly\nunder-massive, by typically 11% (or over-luminous by 0.2 dex) compared to that\npredicted by the evolutionary models. We examine our approach for systematic\nproblems, but find no satisfactory explanation. The discrepancy is in the same\nsense as the long-discussed and elusive discrepancy between the masses measured\nfrom stellar atmosphere analysis with the stellar evolutionary models, and\nmight suggest that either increased rotation or convective overshooting is\nneeded in the models. Additional systems will be discussed in future papers of\nthis series, and will hopefully confirm or refute this trend. \n\n"}

The HST/WFPC2\ncolor-magnitude diagram (CMD) of Leo T is exquisitely deep, extending ~ 2\nmagnitudes below the oldest main sequence turnoff, permitting excellent\nconstraints on star formation at all ages. We use a maximum likelihood CMD\nfitting technique to measure the SFH of Leo T assuming three different sets of\nstellar evolution models: Padova (solar-scaled metallicity) and BaSTI (both\nsolar-scaled and alpha-enhanced metallicities). The resulting SFHs are\nremarkably consistent at all ages, indicating that our derived SFH is robust to\nthe choice of stellar evolution model. From the lifetime SFH of Leo T, we find\nthat 50% of the total stellar mass formed prior to z ~ 1 (7.6 Gyr ago).\nSubsequent to this epoch, the SFH of Leo T is roughly constant until the most\nrecent ~ 25 Myr, where the SFH shows an abrupt drop. This decrease could be due\nto a cessation of star formation or stellar initial mass function sampling\neffects, but we are unable to distinguish between the two scenarios. Overall,\nour measured SFH is consistent with previously derived SFHs of Leo T. However,\nthe HST-based solution provides improved age resolution and reduced\nuncertainties at all epochs.

It has been extensively observed with ground based\ntelescopes and within the WISH Guaranteed Time Herschel Key Program. We present\nnew observations of the C18O 3-2 and the HDO 3_{12}-2_{21} lines towards NGC\n7129 FIRS 2. Combining these observations with Herschel data and modeling their\nemissions, we constrain the C18O and HDO abundance profiles across the\nprotostellar envelope. In particular, we derive the abundance of C18O and HDO\nin the hot core. The intensities of the C18O lines are well reproduced assuming\nthat the C18O abundance decreases through the protostellar envelope from the\nouter edge towards the centre until the point where the gas and dust reach the\nCO evaporation temperature (~20-25 K) where the C18O is released back to the\ngas phase. Once the C18O is released to the gas phase, the modelled C18O\nabundance is found to be ~1.6x10^{-8}, which is a factor of 10 lower than the\nreference abundance. This result is supported by the non-detection of C18O 9-8,\nwhich proves that even in the hot core (T_k>100 K) the CO abundance must be 10\ntimes lower than the reference value. Several scenarios are discussed to\nexplain this C18O deficiency.

Both Type I\n(single exponential) and Type II (down-turning) observed disk\nsurface-brightness profiles can be explained by our findings. We relate these\nresults to the strong angular momentum outward transfer, resulting from torques\nand radial migration associated with multiple patterns, such as central bars\nand spiral waves of different multiplicity. We show that even for stars ending\nup on cold orbits, the changes in angular momentum exhibit complex structure as\na function of radius, unlike the expected effect of transient spirals alone.\nFocussing on one of our models, we find evidence for non-linear coupling among\nm=1, 2, 3 and 4 density waves, where m is the pattern multiplicity. We suggest\nthat the naturally occurring larger resonance widths at galactic radii beyond\nfour scale-lengths may have profound consequences on the formation and location\nof breaks in disk density profiles, provided spirals are present at such large\ndistances. We also consider the effect of gas inflow and show that when\nin-plane smooth gas accretion of ~5 M_sun/yr is included, the outer disks\nbecome more unstable, leading to a strong increase in the stellar velocity\ndispersion. This, in turn, causes the formation of a Type III (up-turning)\nprofile in the old stellar population. We propose that observations of Type III\nsurface brightness profiles, combined with an up-turn in the stellar velocity\ndispersions beyond the disk break, could be a signature of ongoing\ngas-accretion.

We analyze the rest-frame U-B color\ncorrelations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies in\nthe redshift range 0.5< z<0.8 from the DEEP2/AEGIS survey. We find that Sersic\nindex (n) has the smallest overlap region among all tested parameters and\nresembles a step-function with a threshold value of n=2.3. There exists,\nhowever, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high n\nvalues that seem to contradict this behavior. We hypothesize that their Sersic\nvalues may be distorted by bursts of star formation, AGNs, and/or poor fits,\nleading us to consider central surface stellar mass density as an alternative\nto Sersic index. Not only does it correct the outliers, it also forms a tight\nrelationship with color, suggesting that the innermost structure of galaxies is\nmost physically linked with quenching. Furthermore, at z~0.65, the majority of\nthe blue cloud galaxies cannot simply fade onto the red sequence since their\nGIM2D bulge masses are only half as large on average as the bulge masses of\nsimilar red sequence galaxies, thus demonstrating that stellar mass must\nabsolutely increase at the centers of galaxies as they quench.

We calculate the typical Jeans mass using\nhigh-resolution hydrodynamic simulations coupled with a fully radiative model\nfor the ISM, which yields a parameterisation of the IMF characteristic mass as\na function of galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We then calculate the star\nformation histories of galaxies utilising an equilibrium galaxy growth model\ncoupled with constraints on the star formation histories set by abundance\nmatching models. We find that at early times, energetic coupling between dust\nand gas drive warm conditions in the ISM, yielding bottom-light/top- heavy IMFs\nassociated with large ISM Jeans masses for massive star-forming galaxies. Owing\nto the remnants of massive stars that formed during the top-heavy phases at\nearly times, the resultant M/L_K(sigma) in massive galaxies at the present\nepoch is increased relative to the non- varying IMF case. At late times, lower\ncosmic ray fluxes allow for cooler ISM temperatures in massive galaxies, and\nhence newly formed clusters will exhibit bottom-heavy IMFs, further increasing\nM/L_K(sigma). Our central result is hence that a given massive galaxy may go\nthrough both top-heavy and bottom-heavy IMF phases during its lifetime, though\nthe bulk of the stars form during a top-heavy phase. Qualitatively, the\nvariations in M/L_K(sigma) with galaxy mass are in agreement with observations,\nhowever, our model may not be able to account for bottom-heavy mass functions\nas indicated by stellar absorption features. \n\n"}

For red galaxies there is no significant correlation between clustering\namplitude and either SFR or sSFR. Blue galaxies with high SFR or low sSFR are\nas clustered on large scales as red galaxies. We find that the clustering trend\nobserved with SFR can be explained mostly, but not entirely, by the correlation\nbetween stellar mass and clustering amplitude for blue galaxies. We also show\nthat galaxies above the star-forming \"main sequence\" are less clustered than\ngalaxies below the main sequence, at a given stellar mass.

We find that a circular binary system with a\nmisaligned circumbinary disk normally produces a double peaked\nmass-accretion-rate variation per binary orbit. This is because each black hole\npasses across the circumbinary disk plane and captures gas twice in one orbital\nperiod.

Ram pressure\n  dynamics Abstract: We use the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method combined with an\nn-body code to study the dynamics of the interaction between a gas-rich spiral\ngalaxy and intracluster or intragroup medium, often known as the ram pressure\nscenario. The advantage of this gas kinetic approach over traditional\nhydrodynamics is explicit treatment of the interface between the hot and cold,\ndense and rarefied media typical of astrophysical flows and the explicit\nconservation of energy and momentum and the interface. This approach yields\nsome new physical insight. Owing to the shock and backward wave that forms at\nthe point ICM--ISM contact, ICM gas is compressed, heated and slowed. The shock\nmorphology is Mach-disk-like. In the outer galaxy, the hot turbulent post-shock\ngas flows around the galaxy disk, while heating and ablating the initially cool\ndisk gas. The outer gas and angular momentum are lost to the flow. In the inner\ngalaxy, the hot gas pressurizes the neutral ISM gas causing a strong two-phase\ninstability. As a result, the momentum of the wind is no longer impulsively\ncommunicated to the cold gas as assumed in the Gunn-Gott (1972) formula, but\noozes through the porous disk, transferring its linear momentum to the disk en\nmasse. The escaping gas mixture has a net positive angular momentum and forms a\nslowly rotating sheath. The shear flow caused by the post-shock ICM flowing\nthrough the porous multiphase ISM creates a strong Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\nin the disk that results in Cartwheel-like ring and spoke morphology. \n\n"}

Compared to previous work, we improve the\ncalculation of the radiative force due to X-rays. More importantly, in addition\nto radiative pressure and radiative heating/cooling directly from the central\nAGN, in the momentum equation we also include the force due to the scattered\nand reprocessed photons. We find that the accretion flow properties change\nsignificantly due to this \"re-radiation\" effect. The inflow rate at the inner\nboundary is reduced, while the outflow rate at the outer boundary is enhanced\nby about one order of magnitude. This effect is more significant when the\ndensity at the outer boundary is higher. The properties of outflows such as\nvelocity, momentum and energy fluxes, and the ratio of outflow rate and the\naccretion rate, are calculated. We find that the efficiency of transferring the\nradiation power into the kinetic power of outflow is typically $10^{-3}$, far\nbelow the value of $\\sim 0.05$ which is assumed in some cosmological\nsimulations. The effect of the temperature of the gas at the outer boundary\n($T_0$) is investigated. When $T_0$ is high, the emitted luminosity of the\naccretion flow oscillates. This is because in this case the gas around the\nBondi radius can be more easily heated to be above the virial temperature due\nto its high internal energy. Another question we hope to address is the\nso-called \"sub-Eddington\" puzzle. Observationally, the luminosity of almost all\nAGNs are sub-Eddington, while theoretically the luminosity of an accretion flow\ncan easily be super-Eddington.

This arises from the\nsteepening of the effective potential as it interpolates between a flat\ninflationary plateau and the high barrier separating us from our parent vacuum.\nWe demonstrate that these two effects can be parametrically separated in\nangular scale.\n  Observationally, the steepening effect appears to be excluded at large l; but\nit remains consistent with the slight lack of power below l about 30 found by\nthe WMAP and Planck collaborations. We give two simple models which improve the\nfit to the Planck data; one with observable curvature and one without.

We\ncombine these measurements with observations at other energy bands: in high\nenergy (HE, E>100MeV) gamma rays from Fermi-LAT, in X-rays from RXTE, in the\noptical from the KVA telescope and in the radio at 43GHz, 37GHz and 15GHz from\nthe VLBA, Mets\\\"ahovi and OVRO radio telescopes and optical polarisation\nmeasurements from the KVA and Liverpool telescopes. During the MAGIC\nobservations (February to April 2011) 3C 279 was in a low state in optical,\nX-ray and gamma rays. The MAGIC observations did not yield a significant\ndetection. These upper limits are in agreement with the extrapolation of the HE\ngamma-ray spectrum, corrected for extragalactic background light absorption,\nfrom Fermi-LAT. The second part of the MAGIC observations in 2011 was triggered\nby a high activity state in the optical and gamma-ray bands. During the optical\noutburst the optical electric vector position angle rotatated of about 180\ndegrees. There was no simultaneous rotation of the 43GHz radio polarisation\nangle. No VHE gamma rays were detected by MAGIC, and the derived upper limits\nsuggest the presence of a spectral break or curvature between the Fermi-LAT and\nMAGIC bands. The combined upper limits are the strongest derived to date for\nthe source at VHE and below the level of the previously detected flux by a\nfactor 2. Radiation models that include synchrotron and inverse Compton\nemissions match the optical to gamma-ray data, assuming an emission component\ninside the broad line region (BLR) responsible for the high-energy emission and\none outside the BLR and the infrared torus causing optical and low-energy\nemission.

Since the beam is intrinsically narrow (~1 deg), the associated\nemission region must be small for the observed BEC to avoid smearing out by\nspatial convolution. We estimate whether the energy available in the stream is\nsufficient to produce such a bright feature in the averaged profile. The energy\nconsiderations become complicated by the angular constraints imposed by the\nwidth of the microbeam, and by the specific spectrum of the BEC which is found\nto have the spectral index xi ~ -0.9 in comparison to the index of xi ~ -2 for\nthe total profile. For typical parameters, the luminosity of the BEC is\ndetermined to be 4 10^{25} erg/s, whereas the maximum-possible\nbeam-size-limited power of the stream is L_max ~ 2 10^{29} erg/s. This implies\nthe minimum energy-conversion efficiency of eta ~ 2 10^{-4}. The BEC's\nluminosity does not exceed any absolute limits of energetics, in particular, it\nis smaller than the power of primary electron and/or secondary plasma stream.\nHowever, the implied efficiency of energy transfer into the radio band is\nextreme if the coherently emitting charge-separated plasma density is limited\nto the Goldreich-Julian value. This suggests that the bifurcated shape of the\nBEC has macroscopic origin, however, several uncertainties (eg. the dipole\ninclination and spectral shape) make this conclusion not firm. \n\n"}

Fainter ETGs\nare younger, of about 2 Gyr on average, and evolve for about 7-8 Gyr along the\nBC. The turn-off occurs at z ~ 0.3-0.4. Therefore these ETGs spend up to 3-5\nGyr crossing the GV; UGC 06324, the faintest ETG in the sample, still is in the\nGV. The mechanism driving their evolution is gravitational, due to merging\nand/or interaction. Our SPH simulations suggest that ETG members of these\ngroups evolved toward the RS before and during the group collapse phase.

For radio emission from a helical magnetic field,\nthe polarization as a function of the square of the wavelength becomes\nasymmetric with respect to zero. Mathematically speaking, the resulting\nemission occurs then either at observable or at unobservable (imaginary)\nwavelengths. We demonstrate that rotation measure (RM) synthesis allows for the\nreconstruction of the underlying Faraday dispersion function in the former\ncase, but not in the latter. The presence of positive magnetic helicity can\nthus be detected by observing positive RM in highly polarized regions in the\nsky and negative RM in weakly polarized regions.

The simultaneous presence of two\nmagnetic constituents with opposite signs of helicity is shown to possess\nsignatures that can be quantified through polarization peaks at specific\nwavelengths and the gradient of the phase of the Faraday dispersion function.\nSimilar polarization peaks can tentatively also be identified for the\nbi-helical magnetic fields that are generated self-consistently by a dynamo\nfrom helically forced turbulence, even though the magnetic energy spectrum is\nthen continuous.

However, as the Lyman break technique is extended to higher\nredshifts, it has become clear that the Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z~3 are\nmore massive, luminous, redder, more extended and at higher metallicities than\ntheir z~5 counterparts.

Generally, a static binary lens is considered to fit the observed\nlight curve and, when the orbital motion is taken into account, an\noversimplified model is usually employed. In this paper, we treat the\nbinary-lens motion in a realistic way and focus on simulated events that are\nfitted well by a Paczy\\'nski curve.

The iron abundance in NGC 4833 is homogeneous\nat better than 6%. On the other hand, the light elements involved in\nproton-capture reactions at high temperature show the large star-to-star\nvariations observed in almost all GCs studied so far. The Na-O anticorrelation\nin NGC 4833 is quite extended, as expected from the high temperatures reached\nby stars on the HB, and NGC 4833 contains a conspicuous fraction of stars with\nextreme [O/Na] ratios.

This situation occurs in single-dish HI\nobservations of the local universe, but also frequently in high-redshift\nobservations. M_dyn-measurements in high-redshift galaxies are commonly\nobtained through observations of the CO line, the most abundant tracer of the\nmolecular medium. Even though the CO linewidth can in most cases be determined\nwith reasonable accuracy, a measurement of the size of the emitting region is\ntypically challenging given current facilities. We show how the integrated\nspectra (`global profiles') of a variety of galaxy models depend on the spatial\ndistribution of the tracer gas as well as its velocity dispersion. We\ndemonstrate that the choice of tracer emission line significantly affects the\nshape of the global profiles. In particular, in the case of high (~50 kms-1)\nvelocity dispersions, compact tracers (such as CO) result in Gaussian-like\n(non-double-horned) profiles, as is indeed frequently seen in high-redshift\nobservations.

We confirm that the increased bulge prominence\namong quiescent galaxies, as reported previously based on rest-optical\nobservations, remains in place when considering the distributions of stellar\nmass. Moreover, we observe an increase of the typical Sersic index and\nbulge-to-total ratio (with median B/T reaching 40-50%) among star-forming\ngalaxies above 10^11 Msun.

We examine how the\nstellar ages and abundance patterns of galaxies evolve over time as a function\nof stellar mass from 10^{9.6}-10^{11.8} Msun.

Full spectrum stellar population synthesis modeling provides estimates\nof the age and the abundances of the elements Fe, Mg, C, N, and Ca. We find\nnegligible evolution in elemental abundances at fixed stellar mass over roughly\n7 Gyr of cosmic time. In addition, the increase in stellar ages with time for\nmassive galaxies is consistent with passive evolution since z = 0.7. Taken\ntogether, these results favor a scenario in which the inner ~ 0.3-3 R_e of\nmassive quiescent galaxies have been passively evolving over the last half of\ncosmic time. Interestingly, the derived stellar ages are considerably younger\nthan the age of the universe at all epochs, consistent with an equivalent\nsingle-burst star formation epoch of z < 1.5.

We use a mask that\nfocuses our analysis on the diffuse interstellar medium at intermediate\nGalactic latitudes. We determine the spectral indices of dust emission in\nintensity and polarization between 100 and 353 GHz, for each sky-patch. The\nmean values, $1.59\\pm0.02$ for polarization and $1.51\\pm0.01$ for intensity,\nfor a mean dust temperature of 19.6 K, are close, but significantly different\n($3.6\\,\\sigma$). We determine the mean spectral energy distribution (SED) of\nthe microwave emission, correlated with the 353 GHz dust templates, by\naveraging the results of the correlation over all sky-patches. We find that the\nmean SED increases for decreasing frequencies at $\\nu < 60$ GHz, for both\nintensity and polarization. The rise of the polarization SED towards low\nfrequencies may be accounted for by a synchrotron component correlated with\ndust, with no need for any polarization of the anomalous microwave emission. We\nuse a spectral model to separate the synchrotron and dust polarization and to\ncharacterize the spectral dependence of the dust polarization fraction. The\npolarization fraction ($p$) of the dust emission decreases by $(21\\pm6)$ % from\n353 to 70 GHz. The decrease of $p$ could indicate differences in polarization\nefficiency among components of interstellar dust (e.g., carbon versus silicate\ngrains).

This\nproblem has drawn renewed interest due to recent determinations of gas mass\nfractions beyond R200, which appear to be considerably larger than the cosmic\nmean, and because the clusters' total Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux receives a\nsignificant contribution from these regions. Here, we use a large suite of\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the clumpiness of density and\npressure and employ different variants of simulated physics, including\nradiative gas physics and thermal feedback by active galactic nuclei. We find\nthat density and pressure clumping closely trace each other as a function of\nradius, but the bias on density remains on average < 20% within the virial\nradius R200. At larger radius, clumping increases steeply due to the continuous\ninfall of coherent structures that have not yet passed the accretion shock.\nDensity and pressure clumping increase with cluster mass and redshift, which\nprobes on average dynamically younger objects that are still in the process of\nassembling. The angular power spectra of gas density and pressure show that the\nclumping signal is dominated by comparably large substructures with scales\n>R200/5, signaling the presence of gravitationally-driven \"super-clumping\".

The burst appears to be of\nthe same physical origin as the four purported extragalactic FRBs reported by\nThornton et al. (2013). This burst's arrival time precedes the Thornton et\nal.~bursts by ten years. We consider that this survey, and many other archival\nlow-latitude (|gb|<30deg) pulsar surveys, have been searched for FRBs but\nproduced fewer detections than the comparatively brief Thornton et al.~search.\nSuch a rate dependence on Galactic position could provide critical supporting\nevidence for an extragalactic origin for FRBs. To test this, we form an\nanalytic expression to account for Galactic position and survey setup in FRB\nrate predictions. Employing a sky temperature, scattering, and dispersion model\nof the Milky Way, we compute the expected number of FRBs if they are\nisotropically distributed on the sky w.r.t. Galactic position (i.e. local), and\nif they are of extragalactic origin. We demonstrate that the relative detection\nrates reject a local origin with a confidence of 99.96% (~3.6 sigma).

In\nthe present-day universe star-forming galaxies of all masses 1e9 - 1e11 Msol\nare predominantly thin, nearly oblate disks, in line with previous studies.

Comparisons with isochrones\nindicate that the brightest resolved stars in M32 have ages of a few Gyr, and\nare younger on average than AGB stars with the same intrinsic brightness in the\nouter disk of M31. Accounting for stellar variability is shown to be essential\nfor modelling AGB luminosity functions (LFs). Model LFs that assume the\nstar-forming history measured by Monachesi et al.

Consequently, the He$^{+}$\n1640 angstrom recombination line is expected to become much weaker. Supernova\nfeedback exhibits great variety due to the uncertainty in possible explosion\npathways. If at least one of the component stars dies as a hypernova about ten\ntimes more energetic than conventional core-collapse supernovae, the gas inside\nthe host minihalo is effectively blown out, chemically enriching the\nintergalactic medium (IGM) to an average metallicity of $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ solar\nmetallicity (Zsun), out to $\\sim 2$ kpc.

Eight radio source\nsamples are combined to produce a catalogue of 211 radio-loud AGN with\n0.5<z<1.0, which are spectroscopically classified into jet-mode and\nradiative-mode (radiatively-efficient) AGN classes. Comparing with large\nsamples of local radio-AGN from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the cosmic\nevolution of the radio luminosity function of each radio-AGN class is\nindependently derived. Radiative-mode radio-AGN show an order of magnitude\nincrease in space density out to z~1 at all luminosities, consistent with these\nAGN being fuelled by cold gas. In contrast, the space density of jet-mode\nradio-AGN decreases with increasing redshift at low radio luminosities (L_1.4 <\n1e24 W/Hz) but increases at higher radio luminosities. Simple models are\ndeveloped to explain the observed evolution. In the best-fitting models, the\ncharacteristic space density of jet-mode AGN declines with redshift in\naccordance with the declining space density of massive quiescent galaxies,\nwhich fuel them via cooling of gas in their hot haloes. A time delay of 1.5-2\nGyr may be present between the quenching of star formation and the onset of\njet-mode radio-AGN activity. The behaviour at higher radio luminosities can be\nexplained either by an increasing characteristic luminosity of jet-mode\nradio-AGN activity with redshift (roughly as (1+z) cubed) or if the jet-mode\nradio-AGN population also includes some contribution of cold-gas-fuelled\nsources seen at a time when their accretion rate was low.

We recover the sequence in\nassociation of different SN types to the star-forming regions by using several\nindicators of the ongoing and recent SF related to both the ionized gas and the\nstellar populations. While the total ongoing SF is on average the same for the\nthree SN types, SNe Ibc/IIb tend to happen closer to star-forming regions and\noccur in higher SF density locations compared to SNe II and SNe~Ia, the latter\nshowing the weakest correlation. SNe~Ia host galaxies have on average masses\nthat are $\\sim$0.3-0.8~dex higher than CC SNe hosts due to a larger fraction of\nold stellar populations in the SNe~Ia hosts. Using the recent SN~Ia delay-time\ndistribution and the SFHs of the galaxies, we show that the SN~Ia hosts in our\nsample should presently produce a factor 2 more SNe~Ia than the CC~SN hosts.\nSince both types are in hosts with similar SF rate and hence similar CC~SN\nrate, this can explain the mass difference between the SN~Ia and CC~SN hosts,\nand reinforce the finding that at least part of SNe~Ia should originate from\nvery old progenitors. Comparing the mean SFH of the eight least massive\ngalaxies to that of the massive SF SN~Ia hosts we find that the low-mass\ngalaxies formed their stars over more extended time than the massive SN~Ia\nhosts.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring.

In this paper, using turbulence dynamo models for high magnetic\nPrandtl number fluids, we find constraints on the seed magnetic fields. The\nhydrodynamic Reynolds number based on the Spitzer viscosity in the intracluster\nmedium (ICM) is believed to be less than $O(10^2)$, while the magnetic Reynolds\nnumber can be much larger than that.

All five objects were identified as super-Eddington\naccreting massive black holes (SEAMBHs). The highest measured accretion rates\nfor the objects in this campaign are $\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}\\gtrsim 200$, where\n$\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}= \\dot{M}_{\\bullet}/L_{\\rm Edd}c^{-2}$, $\\dot{M}_{\\bullet}$\nis the mass accretion rates, $L_{\\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity and $c$\nis the speed of light.

Thus, the relationship\nbetween broad-line region size ($R_{_{\\rm H\\beta}}$) and optical luminosity at\n5100\\AA, $R_{_{\\rm H\\beta}}-L_{5100}$, requires accretion rate as an additional\nparameter.

Both\ngalaxies are detected by both Chandra and NuSTAR, which together provide the\nfirst-ever spectra of these two galaxies spanning 0.3-30 keV. The X-ray\nemission from both galaxies is spatially resolved by Chandra; we find that hot\ngas dominates the E < 1-3 keV emission while ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs)\ndominate at E > 1-3 keV. The NuSTAR galaxy-wide spectra of both galaxies follow\nsteep power-law distributions with Gamma ~ 2.6 at E > 5-7 keV, similar to the\nspectra of bright individual ULXs and other galaxies that have been studied by\nNuSTAR. We find that both NGC 3256 and NGC 3310 have X-ray detected sources\ncoincident with nuclear regions; however, the steep NuSTAR spectra of both\ngalaxies restricts these sources to be either low luminosity AGN or non-AGN in\nnature (e.g., ULXs or crowded X-ray sources that reach L2-10 keV ~ 10^40 erg/s\ncannot be ruled out). Combining our constraints on the 0.3-30 keV spectra of\nNGC 3256 and NGC 3310 with equivalent measurements for nearby star-forming\ngalaxies M83 and NGC 253, we analyze the SFR-normalized spectra of these\nstarburst galaxies. The spectra of all four galaxies show sharply declining\npower-law slopes above 3-6 keV due to ULX populations. Our observations\ntherefore constrain the average spectra of luminous accreting binaries (i.e.,\nULXs). This result is similar to the super-Eddington accreting ULXs that have\nbeen studied individually in a targeted NuSTAR ULX program. We also find that\nNGC 3310 exhibits a factor of ~3-10 elevation of X-ray emission over the other\nstar-forming galaxies.

Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass\naccretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in\nthe disk. We calculate the snow line location from recent observations of mass\naccretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed\ndispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial\ndisk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow line\nlocations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass\naccretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow line\nlocations of 0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the one-sigma snow line location\namong solar mass stars of the same age ranges from 2 to 5 au. For more\nrealistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located\nup to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of\nN-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial\nplanets that formed in situ in the habitable zone.

We collect infrared (IR) to submillimetre (submm) data for both\nsamples and present the complete data set for the DGS sample. We model the\nobserved spectral energy distributions (SED) with a physically-motivated dust\nmodel to access the dust properties. Using a different SED model (modified\nblackbody), dust composition (amorphous carbon), or wavelength coverage at\nsubmm wavelengths results in differences in the dust mass estimate of a factor\ntwo to three, showing that this parameter is subject to non-negligible\nsystematic modelling uncertainties. For eight galaxies in our sample, we find a\nrather small excess at 500 microns (< 1.5 sigma). We find that the dust SED of\nlow-metallicity galaxies is broader and peaks at shorter wavelengths compared\nto more metal-rich systems, a sign of a clumpier medium in dwarf galaxies. The\nPAH mass fraction and the dust temperature distribution are found to be driven\nmostly by the specific star-formation rate, SSFR, with secondary effects from\nmetallicity. The correlations between metallicity and dust mass or total-IR\nluminosity are direct consequences of the stellar mass-metallicity relation.\nThe dust-to-stellar mass ratios of metal-rich sources follow the well-studied\ntrend of decreasing ratio for decreasing SSFR. The relation is more complex for\nhighly star-forming low-metallicity galaxies and depends on the chemical\nevolutionary stage of the source (i.e., gas-to-dust mass ratio). Dust growth\nprocesses in the ISM play a key role in the dust mass build-up with respect to\nthe stellar content at high SSFR and low metallicity. (abridged) \n\n"}

Such an approach includes\nphysically-motivated AGN lightcurves tested on independent datasets, which\ndescribe the evolution of the Eddington ratio and radiative efficiency from\nslim- to thin-disc conditions. We nicely reproduce the local estimates of the\nBH mass function, the AGN duty cycle as a function of mass and redshift, along\nwith the Eddington ratio function and the fraction of galaxies with given\nstellar mass hosting an AGN with given Eddington ratio. We exploit the same\napproach to reconstruct the observed stellar mass function at different\nredshift from the UV and far-IR luminosity functions associated to star\nformation in galaxies. These results imply that the buildup of stars and BHs in\ngalaxies occurs via in-situ processes, with dry mergers playing a marginal role\nat least for stellar masses < 3 10^11 M_sun and BH masses < 10^9 M_sun, where\nthe statistical data are more secure and less biased by systematic errors.

The resulting relationships constitute a testbed for galaxy\nevolution models, highlighting the complementary role of stellar and AGN\nfeedback in the star formation process. Finally, the clustering properties of\nBHs and galaxies are found to be in full agreement with current observations,\nso further validating our results from the continuity equation. \n\n"}

The models we adopt\nhere fully take into account velocity anisotropy of tracer stars confined\nwithin a flattened dark halo. Applying our models to the available kinematic\ndata of the 12 bright dSphs, we find that these galaxies associate with, in\ngeneral, elongated dark halos, even considering the effect of this velocity\nanisotropy of stars. We also find that the best-fit parameters, especially for\nthe shapes of dark halos and velocity anisotropy, are susceptible to both the\navailability of velocity data in the outer regions and the effect of the lack\nof sample stars in each spatial bin. Thus, to obtain more realistic limits on\ndark halo structures, we require photometric and kinematic data over much\nlarger areas in the dSphs than previously explored. The results obtained from\nthe currently available data suggest that the shapes of dark halos in the dSphs\nare more elongated than those of $\\Lambda$CDM subhalos. This mismatch needs to\nbe solved by theory including baryon components and the associated feedback to\ndark halos as well as by further observational limits in larger areas of dSphs.\nIt is also found that more diffuse dark halos may have undergone consecutive\nstar formation history, thereby implying that dark-halo structure plays an\nimportant role in star formation activity. \n\n"}

UCHVCs are sources with velocities and sizes\nconsistent with their being low-mass dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume, but\nwithout optical counterparts in existing catalogs.

{"id": "1509.07877", "contents": "Title: A Constrained-Gradient Method to Control Divergence Errors in Numerical\n  MHD Abstract: In numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a major challenge is maintaining\nzero magnetic field-divergence (div-B). Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are\nsufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using\nonly the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,\norder-of-magnitude errors. \n\n"}

A\ndetailed study of these rare sources provides new perspectives for\ninvestigating the AGN duty cycle, AGN-galaxy feedback, and accretion\nmechanisms. Large catalogues of radio sources provide statistical information\nabout the evolution of the radio-loud AGN population out to high redshifts.\nUsing wide-field imaging with the LOFAR telescope, we study both a well-known\nDDRG as well as a large number of radio sources in the field of view. We\npresent a high resolution image of the DDRG B1834+620 obtained at 144 MHz using\nLOFAR commissioning data. Our image covers about 100 square degrees and\ncontains over 1000 sources. The four components of the DDRG B1834+620 have been\nresolved for the first time at 144 MHz. Inner lobes were found to point towards\nthe direction of the outer lobes, unlike standard FR~II sources. Polarized\nemission was detected in the northern outer lobe. The high spatial resolution\nallows the identification of a large number of small double-lobed radio\nsources; roughly 10% of all sources in the field are doubles with a separation\nsmaller than 1 arcmin. The spectral fit of the four components is consistent\nwith a scenario in which the outer lobes are still active or the jets recently\nswitched off, while emission of the inner lobes is the result of a mix-up of\nnew and old jet activity. From the presence of the newly extended features in\nthe inner lobes of the DDRG, we can infer that the mechanism responsible for\ntheir formation is the bow shock that is driven by the newly launched jet. We\nfind that the density of the small doubles exceeds the density of FR-II sources\nwith similar properties at 1.4 GHz, but this difference becomes smaller for low\nflux densities. \n\n"}

Because the ISM is turbulent, a given\npatch of ISM exhibits sub-patches with a range of surface densities. The\nhigh-density patches are 'pushed' by feedback, thereby driving turbulence and\nself-regulating local star formation. Sufficiently low-density patches,\nhowever, are accelerated to above the escape velocity before the region can\nself-adjust and are thus vented as outflows. In the\nturbulent-pressure-supported regime, when the gas fraction is $\\gtrsim 0.3$,\nthe ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion to the circular velocity is\nsufficiently high that at any given time, of order half of the ISM has surface\ndensity less than the critical value and thus can be blown out on a dynamical\ntime. The resulting outflows have a mass-loading factor ($\\eta \\equiv M_{\\rm\nout}/M_{\\star}$) that is inversely proportional to the gas fraction times the\ncircular velocity. At low gas fractions, the star formation rate needed for\nlocal self-regulation, and corresponding turbulent Mach number, decline\nrapidly; the ISM is 'smoother', and it is actually more difficult to drive\nwinds with large mass-loading factors. Crucially, our model predicts that\nstellar-feedback-driven outflows should be suppressed at $z \\lesssim 1$ in\n$M_{\\star} \\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ galaxies. This mechanism allows massive\ngalaxies to exhibit violent outflows at high redshifts and then 'shut down'\nthose outflows at late times, thereby enabling the formation of a smooth,\nextended thin stellar disk. We provide simple fitting functions for $\\eta$ that\nshould be useful for sub-resolution and semi-analytic models. [abridged] \n\n"}

We study the cluster A209 by using the CLASH-VLT spectroscopic data\ncombined with Subaru photometry, yielding to 1916 cluster members down to a\nstellar mass of 10^{8.6} Msun.

The stellar mass function of the star-forming\ngalaxies does not depend on the environment, while the slope found for passive\ngalaxies becomes flatter in the densest region. The color distribution of the\nintra-cluster light is consistent with the color of passive members. The\nanalysis of the dynamical orbits shows that low-mass passive galaxies have\ntangential orbits, avoiding small pericenters around the BCG. The mass-size\nrelation of low-mass passive ETGs is flatter than that of high mass galaxies,\nand its slope is consistent with that of field star-forming galaxies. Low-mass\ngalaxies are also more compact within the scale radius of 0.65 Mpc. The ratio\nbetween stellar and number density profiles shows a mass segregation in the\ncenter. The comparative analysis of the stellar and total density profiles\nindicates that this effect is due to dynamical friction. Our results are\nconsistent with a scenario in which the \"environmental quenching\" of low-mass\ngalaxies is due to mechanisms such as harassment out to R200, starvation and\nram-pressure stripping at smaller radii, as supported by the analysis of the\nmass function, of the dynamical orbits and of the mass-size relation of passive\nearly-types in different regions.

Aside from\nheralding the onset of cosmic reionization, these first and second generation\nstars could have reasonably produced the ~5-20 solar-mass seeds that eventually\ngrew into z~6-7 quasars. But this process would have taken ~900 Myr, a timeline\nthat appears to be at odds with the predictions of LCDM without an anomalously\nhigh accretion rate, or some exotic creation of ~10^5 solar-mass seeds. There\nis no evidence of either of these happening in the local universe. In this\npaper, we show that a much simpler, more elegant solution to the supermassive\nblack hole anomaly is instead to view this process using the age-redshift\nrelation predicted by the R_h=ct Universe, an FRW cosmology with zero active\nmass.

To optimize an unavoidable\ntrade-off between angular resolution and precision of the SZ flux measurements,\nthe algorithm performs a multiscale analysis of the SZ maps as well as of other\nextended components, such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies\nand the Galactic thermal dust. The demixing of the SZ signal is tackled through\nkernel weighted likelihood maximizations.

Associated with\nthe $B-L$ gauge symmetry breaking by a VEV of the $B-L$ Higgs field, the seesaw\nmechanism for generating the neutrino mass is automatically implemented after\nthe electroweak symmetry breaking in the SM. In this model context, we\nintroduce a $Z_2$-parity and assign an odd parity for one right-handed neutrino\nwhile even parities for the other fields. Therefore, the dark matter candidate\nis identified as the right-handed Majorana neutrino with odd $Z_2$ parity,\nkeeping the minimality of the particle content intact. When the dark matter\nparticle communicates with the SM particles mainly through the $B-L$ gauge\nboson ($Z^\\prime_{BL}$ boson), its relic abundance is determined by only three\nfree parameters, the $B-L$ gauge coupling ($\\alpha_{BL}$), the $Z^\\prime_{BL}$\nboson mass ($m_{Z^\\prime}$) and the dark matter mass ($m_{DM}$).

Instead,\nintegral-field spectroscopic can efficiently recognize the shape, dynamics and\nstellar population of complete samples of early-type galaxies (ETGs). These\nstudies showed that the two main classes, the fast and slow rotators, can be\nseparated using stellar kinematics. We showed there is a dichotomy in the\ndynamics of the two classes.

This leads\nto substantial uncertainties in redshifts and fluxes that are derived from the\nobservations with one specific NB. In this work we demonstrate that the\nuncertainty in measured line parameters can be sharply reduced by using\nrepeated observations of the same target field with filters that have slightly\ndifferent transmittance curves.

Four different\nlatitudes were considered: $b=-4^\\circ$, $-6^\\circ$, $-8^\\circ$, and\n$-10^\\circ$, along the bulge minor axis as well as outside it, at\n$l=\\pm5^\\circ$ and $l=\\pm10^\\circ$. The bulge X-shaped structure comprises\nstars that formed in the disk at different locations. Stars formed in the outer\ndisk, beyond the end of the bar, which are part of the boxy peanut-bulge\nstructure may show peaks in the velocity distributions at positive and negative\nheliocentric radial velocities with high absolute values that can be larger\nthan 100 $\\rm km$ $\\rm s^{-1}$, depending on the observed direction. In some\ncases the structure of the velocity field is more complex and several peaks are\nobserved. Stars formed in the inner disk, the most numerous, contribute\npredominantly to the X-shaped structure and present different kinematic\ncharacteristics.

To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon.

For instance, if the Fermi-LAT Galactic centre GeV gamma-ray excess\nwas due to WIMP annihilation, its morphology would be incompatible with the\nStandard Halo Model that is usually used to interpret data from direct\ndetection experiments. In this article, we calculate exclusion limits from\ndirect detection experiments using self-consistent velocity distributions,\nderived from mass models of the Milky Way where the DM halo has a generalized\nNFW profile. We use two different methods to make the mass model compatible\nwith a DM interpretation of the Galactic centre gamma-ray excess. Firstly, we\nfix the inner slope of the DM density profile to the value that best fits the\nmorphology of the excess. Secondly, we allow the inner slope to vary and\ninclude the morphology of the excess in the data sets used to constrain the\ngravitational potential of the Milky Way. The resulting direct detection limits\ndiffer significantly from those derived using the Standard Halo Model, in\nparticular for light WIMPs, due to the differences in both the local DM density\nand velocity distribution. \n\n"}

Stars of the same age are thicker in the\nouter disk than in the inner disk (flaring). These lead to positive vertical\nage gradients and negative radial age gradients.

It has been shown that\ncurvature perturbations generated by the inflaton are identical in both frames,\nmeaning that observables such as the spectrum of cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) anisotropies are independent of whether matter fields---including those\nin the standard model of particle physics---minimally couple to the brane or\nthe bulk metric/frame. This is true despite the fact that the observables are\neventually measured by the matter fields and that the total action including\nthe matter fields is different in the two cases. In contrast, in curvaton\nscenarios, the observables depend on the frame to which the curvaton minimally\ncouples.

Usually, two limiting cases have been considered.\nOne is that the produced high energetic dark matter particles are quickly\nthermalized due to the elastic scattering with background radiations. The\ncorresponding relic abundance is determined by the thermally averaged\nannihilation cross-section at the reheating temperature.

We extend previous\nworks to include slow rotation and find a relation between the dimensionless\nmoment of intertia, ($\\bar{I}=Ic^2/G_{\\rm N} M^3$), and the compactness,\n$\\cal{C}=G_{\\rm N} M/Rc^2$ (an $\\bar{I}$-$\\cal{C}$ relation), independent of\nthe equation of state, that is reminiscent of but distinct from the general\nrelativity prediction. Several of our equations of state contain hyperons and\nfree quarks, allowing us to revisit the hyperon puzzle. We find that the\nmaximum mass of hyperon stars can be larger than $2M_\\odot$ for small values of\nthe beyond Horndeski parameter, thus providing a resolution of the hyperon\npuzzle based on modified gravity. Moreover, stable quark stars exist when\nhyperonic stars are unstable, which means that the phase transition from\nhyperon to quark stars is predicted just as in general relativity, albeit with\nlarger quark star masses. Two important and potentially observable consequences\nof some of the theories we consider are the existence of neutron stars in a\nrange of masses significantly higher than in GR, and $\\bar{I}$-$\\mathcal{C}$\nrelations that differ from their GR counterparts.

After the end of inflation,\nthe flat direction oscillates about the minimum of its potential, losing at\neach oscillation about 56% of its energy into bursts of gauge/gaugino and\nscalar quanta when crossing the origin. These particles then acquire a large\ninflaton VEV-induced mass and decay perturbatively into the MSSM quanta and\ngravitinos, transferring the inflaton energy very efficiently via instant\npreheating. Regarding thermalization, we show that the MSSM degrees of freedom\nthermalize very quickly, yet not immediately by virtue of the large vacuum\nexpectation value of the inflaton, which breaks the $SU(3)_C\\times U(1)_Y$\nsymmetry into a residual $U(1)$.

For models\nwith strong correlations between halo and stellar age, the conformity signal is\ntoo large to be consistent with the data.

However,\ntheir formation and merger rates are still highly uncertain. Recent upper\nlimits on the stochastic gravitational-wave background obtained by PTAs are\nstarting being in marginal tension with theoretical models for the pairing and\norbital evolution of these systems. This tension can be resolved by assuming\nthat these binaries are more eccentric or interact more strongly with the\nenvironment (gas and stars) than expected, or by accounting for possible\nselection biases in the construction of the theoretical models. However,\nanother (pessimistic) possibility is that these binaries do not merge at all,\nbut stall at large ($\\sim$ pc) separations.

We present a photometric survey of PNe in the galaxy's\nextended halo to characterise its PN population, as well as the surrounding\nintragroup light (IGL) of the Subcluster B.

It has recently been\nsuggested that the emergence of structure modifies the evolution of $a(t)$ via\nNewtonian (or `kinematic') backreaction and that this may avoid the need for\ndark energy. Here we point out that the conventional system of equations is\nexact in Newtonian gravity and there is no approximation in the use of the\nhomogeneous universe equation for $a(t)$. The recently proposed modification of\nRacz et al.\\ (2017) does not reduce to Newtonian gravity in the limit of low\nvelocities. We discuss the relation of this to the `generalised Friedmann\nequation' of Buchert and Ehlers.

Abstract: We study how the gas in a sample of galaxies (M* > 10e9 Msun) in clusters,\nobtained in a cosmological simulation, is affected by the interaction with the\nintra-cluster medium (ICM). The dynamical state of each elemental parcel of gas\nis studied using the total energy. At z ~ 2, the galaxies in the simulation are\nevenly distributed within clusters, moving later on towards more central\nlocations. In this process, gas from the ICM is accreted and mixed with the gas\nin the galactic halo. Simultaneously, the interaction with the environment\nremoves part of the gas. A characteristic stellar mass around M* ~ 10e10 Msun\nappears as a threshold marking two differentiated behaviours. Below this mass,\ngalaxies are located at the external part of clusters and have eccentric\norbits. The effect of the interaction with the environment is marginal.

In these massive systems, part of the gas, strongly\ncorrelated with the stellar mass of the galaxy, is removed. The amount of\nremoved gas is sub-dominant compared with the quantity of retained gas which is\ncontinuously influenced by the hot gas coming from the ICM. The analysis of\nindividual galaxies reveals the existence of a complex pattern of flows,\nturbulence and a constant fuelling of gas to the hot corona from the ICM that\ncould make the global effect of the interaction of galaxies with their\nenvironment to be substantially less dramatic than previously expected. \n\n"}

We investigate if a mock relic sample, obtained from zoomed\ngalaxy cluster simulations, is able to match the properties of relics measured\nin the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). We compile a list of all radio relics known\nto date and homogeneously measure their parameters in all NVSS images and apply\nthe same procedure to relics in our simulations. Number counts in the mock\nrelic sample increase more steeply towards lower relic flux densities,\nsuggesting an incompleteness of NVSS in this regime. Overall, we find that NVSS\nand mock samples show similar properties. However, large simulated relics tend\nto be somewhat smaller and closer to the cluster centre than observed ones.\nBesides this, the mock sample reproduces very well-known correlations for radio\nrelics, in particular those relating the radio luminosity with the largest\nlinear size and the X-ray luminosity. We show that these correlations are\nlargely governed by the sensitivity of the NVSS observations. Mock relics show\na similar orientation with respect to the direction to the cluster centre as\nthe NVSS sample. Moreover, we find that their maximum radio luminosity roughly\ncorrelates with cluster mass, although displaying a large scatter.

Second, we assess the contribution of warm-hot (10^5 - 10^6 K) gas to\nthe ICM as traced by O VI and broad Ly-alpha (BLA) absorption.

Here we use our new IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear\ncorrelation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies and\nhaloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic\neffects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the\ntotal matter power spectrum on scales up to k ~ 10 h/Mpc by 20%. The non-linear\ntwo-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over\na wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high\nredshift to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated\ngalaxies agrees well with SDSS at its mean redshift z ~ 0.1, both as a function\nof stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour, apart from a mild\nexcess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range 10^9-10^10\nMsun/h^2.

Using idealized simulations of single SN\nexplosions, we show that the FIRE-2 algorithm, independent of resolution,\nreproduces converged solutions in both energy and momentum.

Employing a suite of dust models encompassing a\nvariety of physical effects, we simulate observations of a future seven-band\nCMB experiment to assess the impact of these complexities on parametric\ncomponent separation. We identify configurations of frequency bands that\nminimize the `model errors' caused by fitting simple parametric models to more\ncomplex `true' foreground spectra, which bias the inferred CMB signal. We find\nthat: (a) fits employing a simple two parameter modified blackbody (MBB) dust\nmodel tend to produce significant bias in the recovered polarized CMB signal in\nthe presence of physically realistic dust foregrounds; (b) generalized MBB\nmodels with three additional parameters reduce this bias in most cases, but\nnon-negligible biases can remain, and can be hard to detect; and (c) line of\nsight effects, which give rise to frequency decorrelation, and the presence of\niron grains are the most problematic complexities in the dust emission for\nrecovering the true CMB signal.

In\nthis work, to understand what quantities of galaxies are responsible for\ncontrolling the escape fraction, we numerically evaluate the escape fraction by\nperforming ray-tracing calculation with simplified disc galaxy models.

It is also found that the halo mass dependence of\ndisc scale height determines whether the escape fraction increases or decreases\nwith halo mass. With a clumpy disc model, it turns out that the escape fraction\nincreases as the clump mass fraction increases because the density in the\ninter-clump region decreases. In addition, we find that clumpiness regulates\nthe escape fraction via two ways when the total clump mass dominates the total\ngas mass; the escape fraction is controlled by the covering factor of clumps if\nthe clumps are dense sufficient to block LyC photons, otherwise the clumpiness\nworks to reduce the escape fraction by increasing the total number of\nrecombination events in a galaxy. \n\n"}

This is the most precise distance to NGC4993\navailable to date. Combining our distance measurement with the corrected\nrecession velocity of NGC4993 implies a Hubble constant $H_0=71.9\\pm\n7.1~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}$. A comparison of our result to the GW-inferred value of\n$H_0$ indicates a binary orbital inclination of $i\\,{\\gtrsim}\\,137~\\deg$. The\nSBF technique can be applied to early-type host galaxies of BNS mergers to\n${\\sim\\,}100$ Mpc with HST and possibly as far as ${\\sim\\,}300$ Mpc with the\nJames Webb Space Telescope, thereby helping to break the inherent\ndistance-inclination degeneracy of the GW signals at distances where many\nfuture BNS mergers are likely to be detected. \n\n"}

NGC 7727 is relatively luminous ($M_V = -21.7$) and features two\nunequal tidal tails, various bluish arcs and star clusters, and two bright\nnuclei 480 pc apart in projection. These two nuclei have nearly identical\nredshifts, yet are strikingly different. The primary nucleus, hereafter\nNucleus_1, fits smoothly into the central luminosity profile of the galaxy and\nappears--at various wavelengths--\"red and dead.\" In contrast, Nucleus_2 is very\ncompact, has a tidal radius of 103 pc, and exhibits three signs of recent\nactivity: a post-starburst spectrum, an [O III]_5007 emission line, and a\ncentral X-ray point source. Its emission-line ratios place it among Seyfert\nnuclei. A comparison of Nucleus_2 ($M_V = -15.5$) with ultracompact dwarf\ngalaxies (UCDs) suggests that it may be the best case yet for a massive UCD\nhaving formed through tidal stripping of a gas-rich disk galaxy. Evidence for\nthis comes from its extended star-formation history, long blue tidal stream,\nand elevated dynamical-to-stellar-mass ratio.

The DAMOCLES Monte Carlo\nline radiative transfer code models the extent and shape of these dust-affected\nline profiles to determine the dust mass that has condensed, in addition to\nother properties of the dusty ejecta.

We use deep GMRT observations at 608 MHz to\nconstrain the spectral indices of these new radio sources, and of the emission\nthat was already studied in the literature at higher frequency.

This quantity, the effective spin\n$\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is conserved up to at least the second post-Newtonian\norder.

However,\neven quad images of extended sources are not able to fully characterize the\ncentral regions of the host galaxy. Most previous work has focused either on\nthe radial density profile of the lenses or localized substructure clumps.\nHere, we concentrate on the azimuthal mass asymmetries near the image circle.\nThe motivation for considering such mass inhomogeneities is that the transition\nbetween the central stellar dominated region and the outer dark matter\ndominated region, though well represented by a power law density profile, is\nunlikely to be featureless, and encodes information about the dynamical state\nand assembly history of galaxies. It also happens to roughly coincide with the\nEinstein radius. We ask if galaxies that have mass asymmetries beyond\nellipticity can be modeled with simpler lenses, i.e., can complex mass\ndistributions masquerade as simple elliptical+shear lenses? Our preliminary\nstudy indicates that for galaxies with elliptical stellar and dark matter\ndistributions, but with no mass asymmetry, and an extended source filling the\ndiamond caustic, an elliptical+shear lens model can reproduce the images well,\nthereby hiding the potential complexity of the actual mass distribution. For\ngalaxies with non-zero mass asymmetry, the answer depends on the size and\nbrightness distribution of the source, and its location within the diamond\ncaustic.

In the light of these developments, we evaluate the\nBayesian evidence against HZ in different data combinations and model\nextensions. Considering only the Planck temperature data, we find inconclusive\nevidence against HZ when including variations in the neutrino number $N_{\\rm\neff}$ and/or the Helium abundance $Y_{\\rm He}$. Adding the Planck polarization\ndata, on the other hand, yields strong evidence against HZ in the extensions we\nconsidered.

However, with the inclusion of\npolarisation, standard $\\Lambda$CDM is once again preferred, but the HZ model\nwith extra neutrinos is not strongly disfavored. The possibility of fully\nruling out the HZ spectrum is therefore ultimately connected with the solution\nto current tensions between cosmological datasets.

This model\nassumes that central galaxies are quenched by AGN feedback when hot halo gas\naccretes onto a supermassive black hole.

Strong AGN feedback\nterminates this short-lived phase by suppressing the fuel supply for star\nformation. Despite strong evolution of the halo mass - temperature relation,\nquenching occurs at a redshift-independent halo and stellar mass which\ncoincides with the mass where baryons have been converted into stars with\nmaximal efficiency.

An exciting claim has been made recently by\nSilk (2017): that early feedback by IMBHs in gas-rich dwarf galaxies at\n$z=5-8$, can potentially solve multiple dwarf galaxy problems within the\n$\\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter cosmology. We are performing Cosmological\nHydrodynamical Simulations of $(2 Mpc)^3$ volumes, starting from $z=100$, to\ntest the case for IMBHs in Dwarf Galaxies.

Whilst ULXs harboring black hole accretors (BH ULXs)\nare typically emitting isotropically, the majority of ULXs with neutron star\naccretors (NS ULXs) are found to be beamed. These findings confirm previous\nassertions that a significant fraction of ULXs are hidden from view due to a\nsubstantial misalignment of the emission beam and the line-of-sight. We find\nthe total number of NS ULXs in regions with constant star formation, solar\nmetallicity, and ages above ~1 Gyr to be higher than the BH ULXs, although\nobservationally both populations are comparable. For lower metallicities BH ULX\ndominate both the total and observed ULX populations. As far as burst\nstar-formation is concerned, young ULX populations are dominated by BH ULXs,\nbut this changes as the population ages and, post star-formation, NS ULXs\ndominate both the observed and total population of ULXs. We also compare our\nsimulation output to a previous analytical prediction for the relative ratio of\nBH to NS ULXs in idealized flux-limited observations and find broad agreement\nfor all but the lowest metallicities.

Their dark-matter haloes have ordinary spin parameters and\ncentrally dominant dark-matter cores. Their stellar components tend to have a\nprolate shape with a Sersic index n~1 but no significant rotation. Ram pressure\nremoves the gas from the group UDGs when they are at pericentre, quenching star\nformation in them and making them redder. This generates a\ncolour/star-formation-rate gradient with distance from the centre, as observed\nin clusters.

To this end, we present\nhigh-quality long-slit spectroscopy of the powerful double-nucleus radio galaxy\n3C 321. The data have good enough spatial resolution to be able to trace the\nvariation in emission-line properties on kpc scales. Continuum modelling and\nsubtraction enables the faint emission line fluxes to be measured in several\nregions across the emission line nebula. We plot diagnostic line-ratio diagrams\nand compare them with the predictions of various photoionization models,\nfinding that the data is best fit by models which assume a mixture of optically\nthin and thick clouds illuminated by a power-law continuum.\n  The emission line kinematics, line ratios and deduced physical conditions\nshow remarkably little variation across the source. We deduce a mean electron\ndensity of 400 +/- 120 cm-3 and a mean temperature of 11500 +/- 1500 K.\nAssuming a single population of optically thick line-emitting clouds, we\ncalculate a mean photoionization parameter of (1.1 +/- 0.5) x 10e-2 and hence a\nphotoionizing photon luminosity of Q ~ 10e55 -- 10e56 photon/s/sr. This\nindicates a central engine as luminous as that of the powerful quasar 3C 273,\nyet there is no evidence for such an energetically prolific central engine at\neither far-infrared or radio wavelengths.

This procedure results in models which resemble the\nobservations (redshifts and angular separations of galaxies surrounding\nclusters) quite well. We demonstrate, on simulated data, that it is possible to\nestimate correctly the parameters of the systematic velocity component,\nknowledge of which allows determination of the mass profile of a cluster. To\navoid systematic effects when analyzing real data, observations from a number\nof clusters should be combined. In the absence of sufficient data on other\nclusters we illustrate the method by applying it only to the Coma cluster.

To test this, we accurately\ndetermine the stellar and dark halo mass of NGC 4472 using hydrostatic\nequilibrium, then solve the standard time-dependent cooling flow equations to\nrecover the observed hot gas temperature and density distributions when evolved\nto the present time. This procedure fails: the computed gas density gradient is\ntoo steep, the total gas mass is too low, and the gas temperatures are much too\nlow. All variants on this basic procedure also fail: increasing the SNIa rate,\nusing the mass dropout assumption, arbitrarily adjusting uncertain\ncoefficients, etc. However, agreement is achieved if the galaxy is supplied\nwith additional, spatially-extended hot gas early in its evolution. This old\n``circumgalactic'' gas can be retained to the present time and may be related\nto cosmological ``secondary infall''. \n\n"}

On the other hand, the\nnon-detection of multiple images in the BATSE 4B catalog implies an upper limit\non the average redshift <z> of GRBs. Here, we calculate an upper limit to <z>,\nindependent of the physical model for GRBs, using a new statistical lensing\nmethod that removes distance ambiguities, and thus permits accurate computation\nof the lensing rate at high z. The upper limit on <z> depends directly on the\ncosmological parameters Omega and Lambda. If there are no multiple images among\nthe brightest 80% of the first 1802 bursts in the BATSE 4B catalog, then, at\nthe 95% confidence level, <z> is less than 2.2, 2.8, 4.3, or 5.3 for\n(Omega,Lambda) values of (0.3, 0.7), (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.0), or (1.0, 0.0),\nrespectively. The 68% upper limit to the average redshift is comparable to or\nless than the median redshift of GRBs in scenarios in which the GRB rate is\nproportional to the rate of star formation, for any cosmology. The uncertainty\nin the lensing rate --- arising from uncertainties in the cosmological\nparameters and in the number density and average velocity dispersion of\ngalaxies --- will be reduced significantly in the next few years by a new\ngeneration of experiments and surveys. Moreover, the continued increase in the\nnumber of GRBs observed by BATSE will greatly constrain their redshift\ndistribution. \n\n"}

These clusters lie at projected distances of 3-15\nkpc from the center and move with a velocity dispersion of 140+/-35 km/s in the\nline of sight. Seven of the clusters show strong Balmer absorption lines in\ntheir spectra [EW(H-beta)= 6-13 Angstrom], while the eighth lies in a giant HII\nregion and shows no detectable absorption features.\n  Based on comparisons with model-cluster spectra by Bruzual & Charlot (1996)\nand Bressan, Chiosi, & Tantalo (1996), six of the absorption-line clusters have\nages in the range of 400-600 Myr, indicating that they formed early on during\nthe recent merger. These clusters are globular clusters as judged by their\nsmall effective radii and ages corresponding to ~100 core crossing times. The\none emission-line object is <10 Myr old and may be a nascent globular cluster\nor an OB association.\n  The mean metallicities measured for three clusters are solar to within\n+/-0.15 dex, suggesting that the merger of two likely Sc galaxies in NGC 7252\nformed a globular-cluster system with a bimodal metallicity distribution. Since\nNGC 7252 itself shows the characteristics of a 0.5-1 Gyr old protoelliptical,\nits second-generation solar-metallicity globulars provide direct evidence that\ngiant ellipticals with bimodal globular-cluster systems can form through major\nmergers of gas-rich disk galaxies. \n\n"}

Thermodynamic Properties of Stellar Polytrope Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of stellar self-gravitating\nsystem arising from the Tsallis generalized entropy. In particular, physical\ninterpretation of the thermodynamic instability, as has been revealed by\nprevious paper(Taruya & Sakagami, cond-mat/0107494, Physica A 307, 185 (2002)),\nis discussed in detail based on the non-extensive thermostatistics. Examining\nthe Clausius relation in a quasi-static experiment, we obtain the standard\nresult of thermodynamic relation that the physical temperature of the\nequilibrium non-extensive system is identified with the inverse of the Lagrange\nmultiplier, $T_{phys}=1/\\beta$. Using this relation, the specific heat of total\nsystem is computed, and confirm the common feature of self-gravitating system\nthat the presence of negative specific heat leads to the thermodynamic\ninstability. In addition to the gravothermal instability discovered previously,\nthe specific heat shows the curious divergent behavior at the polytrope index\n$n>3$, suggesting another type of thermodynamic instability. Evaluating the\nsecond variation of free energy, we find that the marginal stability condition\nindicated from the specific heat can be exactly recovered from the second\nvariation of free energy. Thus, the stellar polytropic system is consistently\ncharacterized by the non-extensive thermostatistics as a plausible thermal\nequilibrium state. We also clarify the non-trivial scaling behavior appeared in\nspecific heat and address the origin of non-extensive nature in stellar\npolytrope. \n\n"}

Instead of an event horizon, the\nholographic solution has a real spherical boundary membrane, situated roughly\ntwo Planck distances outside of the object's gravitational radius. The interior\nmatter-state is singularity free. It consists out of string type matter, which\nis densely packed. Each string has a transverse extension of exactly one Planck\narea. This dense package of strings might be the reason, why the solution does\nnot collapse to a singularity. The local string tension is inverse proportional\nto the average string length. This purely classical result has its almost exact\ncorrespondence in a recent result in string theory. The holographic solution\nsuggest, that string theory is relevant also on cosmological scales. The large\nscale phenomena in the universe can be explained naturally in a string context.\nDue to the zero active gravitational mass-density of the strings the Hubble\nconstant in a string dominated universe is related to its age by H t = 1.
