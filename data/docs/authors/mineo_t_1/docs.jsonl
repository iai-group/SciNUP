The lack of any bright SN down to\nvery strict limits and the vanishing spectral lags are typical of short GRBs,\nstrikingly at odds with the long (102s) duration of this event. Here we present\nspectral and temporal analysis of the Swift observations. We show that the\nburst presents standard optical, UV and X-ray afterglows. An achromatic break\nis observed simultaneously in optical and X-rays, at a time consistent with the\nbreak in the R-band light curve measured by the VLT. The achromatic behaviour\nand the consistent post-break decay slopes make GRB 060614 one of the best\nexamples of a jet break for a Swift burst. The optical, UV and X-rays afterglow\nlight curves have also an earlier break at ~30 ks. In the optical, there is\nstrong spectral evolution around this break, suggesting the passage of a break\nfrequency through the optical/UV band. The very blue spectrum at early times\nand the trend in the light curves (rising at low frequencies, and decaying at\nhigher energies) suggest this may be the injection frequency. The early X-ray\nlight curve is well interpreted as the X-ray counterpart of the burst extended\nemission. Spectral analysis of BAT/XRT data in the 80s overlap time show that\nthe Ep of the burst has decreased to as low as 8keV at the beginning of the XRT\nobservation. The Ep continues to decrease through the XRT energy band and exits\nit at about 500s after the trigger. The average Ep of the burst is likely < 24\nkeV but larger than 8 keV.

This\nalso seems to be the case of Sagittarius A* in the Galactic Center, where the\nbroad-band radiation is produced, likely via the synchrotron self-Compton\nmechanism. It has been proposed that strong-field gravitational lensing\nmagnifies the flares. The effect of lensing is generally weak and requires a\nfine-tuned geometrical arrangement, which occurs with only a low probability.\nHowever, there are several aspects that make Sagittarius A* a promising target\nto reveal strong gravity effects. Unlike type II (obscured) active galaxies,\nchances are that a flare is detected at high inclination, which would be\nfavourable for lensing. Time delays can then significantly influence the\nobserved flare duration and the form of light-curve profiles. Here we discuss\nan idea that the impact of lensing amplification should be considerably\nenhanced when the shape of the flaring clump is appropriately elongated in the\nform of a spiral wave or a narrow filament, rather than a simple (circular)\nspot which we employed previously within the phenomenological `orbiting spot\nmodel'. By parameterizing the emission region in terms of the spiral shape and\ncontrast, we are able to extend the spot model to more complicated sources. In\nthe case of spirals, we notice a possibility that more photons reach a distant\nobserver at the same moment because of interplay between lensing and\nlight-travel time. The effect is not symmetrical with respect to leading versus\ntrailing spirals, so in principle the source geometry can be constrained. In\nspite of this, the spot model seems to provide entirely adequate framework to\nstudy the currently available data. \n\n"}

We focus on the\ntwo-point and three-point correlation functions, but these methods also apply\nto all higher-order correlation and response functions. We present the general\nformalism, which holds for the gravitational dynamics as well as for similar\nmodels, such as the Zeldovich dynamics, that obey similar hydrodynamical\nequations of motion with a quadratic nonlinearity. We give our explicit\nanalytical results up to one-loop order for the simpler Zeldovich dynamics. For\nthe gravitational dynamics, we compare our one-loop numerical results with\nnumerical simulations. We check that the standard perturbation theory is\nrecovered from the path integral by expanding over Feynman's diagrams. However,\nthe latter expansion is organized in a different fashion and it contains some\nUV divergences that cancel out as we sum all diagrams of a given order.\nResummation schemes modify the scaling of tree and one-loop diagrams, which\nexhibit the same scaling over the linear power spectrum (contrary to the\nstandard expansion).

For this method, it is necessary to know the inclination of the\nX-ray-producing inner region of the disk. Since the inner disk is expected to\nbe oriented perpendicular to the spin axis of the hole, the usual practice is\nto assume that the black hole spin is aligned with the orbital angular momentum\nvector of the binary, and to estimate the inclination of the latter from\nellipsoidal modulations in the light curve of the secondary star. We show that\nthe inclination of the disk can be inferred directly if we have both spectral\nand polarization information on the disk radiation. The predicted degree of\npolarization varies from 0% to 5% as the disk inclination changes from face-on\nto edge-on.

The AGN is clearly\ndetected at a level of about 2 x 10^{-17} W m^{-2} in the observed 0.3-10.0 keV\nband by Swift in a 50 ks observation in 2007 September. For the first time\nsince the ROSAT All-Sky Survey observation in 1990 it was possible to derive an\nX-ray photon distribution by adding together all Swift observations that have\nbeen performed so far (85.5 ks in total). This photon distribution is\nconsistent with an X-ray spectrum of an AGN with a partial covering absorber\nwith a column density in the order of ~ 1 x 10^{23} cm^{-2} and a covering\nfraction of about 90%. A comparison with the 2002 Chandra data suggests that\nWPVS 007 has become brighter by a factor of about 4.

We use a simplified approach for\nstudying formation of stars in collapsed haloes, and the resulting ionization\nof the inter-galactic medium (IGM). We consider a set of LCDM models allowed by\nobservations of CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies for this study.\nWe constrain parameters related to star formation with the help of\nobservations. We constrain subsets of these parameters independently by using\nthe observed metallicity of the inter-galactic medium at z ~ 5 and the\nrequirement that the Thomson scattering optical depth due to an ionized IGM as\ndetermined for the model from CMB observations be reproduced. We consider a\nrange of initial metalicities for star forming gas, and some variations of the\ninitial mass function of stars. We find that a \"normal\" initial mass function\n(IMF) may satisfy these two constraints with a raised efficiency of star\nformation as compared to that seen in the local universe.

Their\nexistence is considered to be a challenge for the LCDM cosmology, because\ngalaxy mergers isotropize stellar disks and trigger angular momentum transport\nin gas disks, thus fostering the formation of central stellar spheroids. Here,\nwe postulate that the formation of stellar spheroids from gasrich disks is\ncontrolled by two parameters that characterize galaxy mergers, the mass ratio\nof merging dark matter halos, and the virial velocity of the larger merging\nhalo. We utilize merger histories generated from realizations of the\ncosmological density field to calculate the fraction of dark matter halos that\nhave avoided spheroid formation, and compare the derived statistics with the\nspheroid occupation fractions in surveys of nearby galaxies.

But if such\nfeedback can drive a weak wind or outflow in the hot, diffuse ISM (a relatively\n'easy' task), then in the wake of such an outflow passing over a cold cloud, a\ncombination of instabilities will drive the cloud material to effectively\nexpand in the direction perpendicular to the outflow. Such expansion\ndramatically increases the effective cross section of the cloud material and\nmakes it more susceptible to ionization and momentum coupling from absorption\nof the incident quasar radiation field. Even a moderate effect of this nature\ncan dramatically alter the ability of clouds at large radii to be fully ionized\nand driven into a secondary outflow by radiation pressure. Since the amount of\nmomentum and volume which can be ionized by observed quasar radiation field is\nmore than sufficient to affect the entire cold gas supply once it has been\naltered in this manner (and the 'initial' feedback need only initiate a\nmoderate wind in the low-density hot gas), this reduces by an order of\nmagnitude the required energy budget for feedback to affect a host galaxy.\nInstead of ~5% of the radiated energy (~100% momentum) needed if the initial\nfeedback must directly heat or blow out the galactic gas, if only ~0.5% of the\nluminosity (~10% momentum) can couple to drive the initial hot outflow, this\nmechanism could be efficient.

This confirms that a stationary shock is an integral part of such an\naccretion disc in the Kerr metric. The equations describing the space gradient\nof the dynamical flow velocity of the accreting matter have been shown to be\nequivalent to a first order autonomous dynamical systems. Fixed point analysis\nensures that such flow must be multi-transonic for certain astrophysically\nrelevant initial boundary conditions. Contrary to the existing consensus in the\nliterature, the critical points and the sonic points are proved not to be\nisomorphic in general. Homoclinic orbits for the flow flow possessing multiple\ncritical points select the critical point with the higher entropy accretion\nrate, confirming that the entropy accretion rate is the degeneracy removing\nagent in the system. However, heteroclinic orbits are also observed for some\nspecial situation, where both the saddle type critical points of the flow\nconfiguration possesses identical entropy accretion rate. Topologies with\nheteroclinic orbits are thus the only allowed non removable degenerate\nsolutions for accretion flow with multiple critical points, and are shown to be\nstructurally unstable. Depending on suitable initial boundary conditions, a\nhomoclinic trajectory can be combined with a standard non homoclinic orbit\nthrough an energy preserving Rankine-Hugoniot type of stationary shock.

Fitting the observed disk rotational velocities and radii with a\nMo, Mao, White (1998) (MMW) model requires unusually large disk spin parameters\nlambda_d>0.1 and disk-to-dark halo mass fraction m_d=0.2, close to the cosmic\nbaryon fraction.

For the dispersion-dominated sample, radial\npressure gradients partly compensate the gravitational force, reducing the\nrotational velocities. Including this pressure effect in the MMW model,\ndispersion-dominated galaxies can be fitted well with spin parameters lf\nlambda_d=0.03-0.05 for high disk mass fractions of m_d=0.2 and with\nlambda_d=0.01-0.03 for m_d=0.05.

We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before).

However, mapping the data sets to the\nparticle-physics properties of dark matter is complicated not only by the\nconsiderable uncertainties in the dark-matter model, but by its poorly\nconstrained local distribution function (the \"astrophysics\" of dark matter). In\nthis Letter, I propose a shift in how to do direct-detection data analysis. I\nshow that by treating the astrophysical and particle physics uncertainties of\ndark matter on equal footing, and by incorporating a combination of data sets\ninto the analysis, one may recover both the particle physics and astrophysics\nof dark matter. Not only does such an approach yield more accurate estimates of\ndark-matter properties, but may illuminate how dark matter coevolves with\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

The intrinsic alignment of galaxies is\nexpected to severely bias parameter estimates if not taken into account. We\nexplore the potential of a joint analysis of tomographic galaxy ellipticity,\ngalaxy number density, and ellipticity-number density cross-correlations to\nsimultaneously constrain cosmology and self-calibrate unknown intrinsic\nalignment and galaxy bias contributions. We treat intrinsic alignments and\ngalaxy biasing as free functions of scale and redshift and marginalise over the\nresulting parameter sets. Constraints on cosmology are calculated by combining\nthe likelihoods from all two-point correlations between galaxy ellipticity and\ngalaxy number density. The information required for these calculations is\nalready available in a standard cosmic shear dataset. We include contributions\nto these functions from cosmic shear, intrinsic alignments, galaxy clustering\nand magnification effects. In a Fisher matrix analysis we compare our\nconstraints with those from cosmic shear alone in the absence of intrinsic\nalignments. For a potential future large area survey, such as Euclid, the extra\ninformation from the additional correlation functions can make up for the\nadditional free parameters in the intrinsic alignment and galaxy bias terms,\ndepending on the flexibility in the models. For example, the Dark Energy Task\nForce figure of merit is recovered even when more than 100 free parameters are\nmarginalised over. We find that the redshift quality requirements are similar\nto those calculated in the absence of intrinsic alignments. \n\n"}

The Fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particle\ndark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pair\nannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Local Group dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the cold\ndark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches for\ndark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matter\ndominated environments.

Despite extensive research on various components\nof the N66/NGC346 complex, few studies have so far focused on N66A, which is a\nspecial object in the whole complex and therefore deserves scrutiny. The study\nof this compact H II region and its fellow objects seems important in the\nframework of massive star formation in the Magellanic Clouds. This analysis is\nbased mainly on our optical ESO NTT observations, both imaging and\nspectroscopy, coupled with archive HST ACS data and Spitzer infrared images\n(IRAC 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 microns). We derive a number of physical\ncharacteristics of the compact H II region N66A. Moreover, we present the\nspectral classification of the main exciting star of N66A for the first time\nusing spectroscopy. Its spectral features indicate a main sequence massive star\nof type O8.

Arp's loop is commonly interpreted as a\ntail resulting from the tidal interaction between M81 and M82. However, since\nits discovery the nature of this feature has remained controversial. Aims: Our\nprimary purpose was to identify the sources of optical and infrared emission\nobserved in Arp's loop. Methods: The morphology of the Arp's loop has been\ninvestigated with deep wide-field optical images. We also measured its colors\nusing IRAS and Spitzer-MIPS infrared images and compared them with those of the\ndisk of M81 and Galactic dust cirrus that fills the area where M81 is located.\nResults: Optical images reveal that this peculiar object has a filamentary\nstructure characterized by many dust features overlapping M81's field. The\nratios of far-infrared fluxes and the estimated dust-to-gas ratios indicate the\ninfrared emission of Arp's loop is dominated by the contribution of cold dust\nthat is most likely from Galactic cirrus. Conclusions: The above results\nsuggest that the light observed at optical wavelengths is a combination of\nemission from i) a few recent star forming regions located close to M81, where\nboth bright UV complexes and peaks in the HI distribution are found, ii) the\nextended disk of M81 and iii) scattered light from the same Galactic cirrus\nthat is responsible for the bulk of the far infrared emission. \n\n"}

Consistent with the\npowerful, high-z giant radio galaxies we have studied previously, X-rays seem\nto be invariably found where the lobe plasma is oldest even where the radio\nemission has long since faded. The hotspot complexes seem to show structures\nresembling the double shock structure exhibited by the largest radio quasar\n4C74.26, with the X-ray shock again being offset closer to the nucleus than the\nradio synchrotron shock. In the current paper, the offsets between these shocks\nare even larger at 35kpc. Unusually for a classical double (FRII) radio source,\nthere is smooth low surface-brightness radio emission associated with the\nregions beyond the hotspots (further away from the nucleus than the hotspots\nthemselves), which seems to be symmetric for the ends of both jets.

Cosmic recombination proceeds far out of equilibrium\nbecause of a \"bottleneck\" at the $n=2$ level of hydrogen: atoms can only reach\nthe ground state via slow processes: two-photon decay or Lyman-$\\alpha$\nresonance escape. However, even a small primordial abundance of molecules could\nhave a large effect on the interline opacity in the recombination epoch and\nlead to an additional route for hydrogen recombination. Therefore, this paper\ncomputes the abundance of the H$_2$ molecule during the cosmic recombination\nepoch. Hydrogen molecules in the ground electronic levels X$^1\\Sigma^+_g$ can\neither form from the excited H$_2$ electronic levels B$^1\\Sigma^+_u$ and\nC$^1\\Pi_u$ or through the charged particles H$_2^+$, HeH$^+$ and H$^-$.

Since the energies of the\nX$^1\\Sigma^+_g$--B$^1\\Sigma^+_u$ (Lyman band) and X$^1\\Sigma^+_g$-C$^1\\Pi_u$\n(Werner band) transitions are near the Lyman-$\\alpha$ energy, the distortion of\nthe CMB spectrum caused by escaped H Lyman-line photons accelerates both the\nformation and the destruction of H$_2$ due to this channel relative to the\nthermal rates.

Furthermore, X-ray\npolarimetry across a broad photon energy range may independently verify the\nmisalignment between the ionisation cones and the axis of the torus. To model\nthe expected polarisation percentage and position angle, we apply the radiative\ntransfer code STOKES.

In the linear perturbation theory limit, the\nbias-modulation method of McDonald & Seljak allows one to distinguish the\nreal-space galaxy clustering from the peculiar velocity signal in each Fourier\nmode. The ratio of lensing signal to galaxy clustering in transverse modes\nyields the bias factor b of each galaxy subset (as per Pen 2004), hence\ncalibrating the conversion from galaxy real-space density to matter density in\nevery mode. In combination these techniques permit measure of the growth rate f\nin each Fourier mode. This yields a measure of the growth rate free of sample\nvariance, i.e. the uncertainty in f can be reduced without bound by increasing\nthe number of redshifts within a finite volume. In practice, the gain from the\nabsence of sample variance is bounded by the limited range of bias modulation\namong dark-matter halos. Nonetheless, the addition of background weak lensing\ndata to a redshift survey increases information on G and f by an amount\nequivalent to a 10-fold increase in the volume of a standard redshift-space\ndistortion measurement---if the lensing signal can be measured to sub-percent\naccuracy.

The spatial\nanalysis of this emission suggests that magnetic fields are amplified by one to\ntwo orders of magnitude in strong shocks. Detection of several remnants in TeV\ngamma rays implies a lower limit on the magnetic-field strength (or a\nmeasurement, if the emission process is inverse-Compton upscattering of cosmic\nmicrowave background photons). Upper limits to GeV emission similarly provide\nlower limits on magnetic-field strengths. In the historical shell remnants,\nlower limits on B range from 25 to 1000 microGauss. Two remnants show\nvariability of synchrotron X-ray emission with a timescale of years.

For these clusters, we measured total masses and\ncharacteristic radii on the basis of a rich optical spectroscopic data set, the\nphysical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) using XMM-Newton and ROSAT\nX-ray data, and total (galaxy) stellar masses utilizing the SDSS DR7 multi-band\nimaging. The observed (hot) gas-mass fractions are almost constant in this mass\nrange. We confirm that the stellar mass fraction decreases as the total mass\nincreases and shows (20+/-4)% scatter; in addition, we show that it decreases\nas the central entropy increases. The latter behavior supports a twofold\ninterpretation where heating from merging quenches the star-formation activity\nof galaxies in massive systems, and feedback from supernovae and/or radio\ngalaxies drives a significant amount of gas to the regions beyond r_{500} or,\nalternatively, a substantially large amount of intracluster light (ICL) is\nassociated with galaxies in nonrelaxed systems. Furthermore, less massive\nclusters are confirmed to host less gas per unit total mass; however, they\nexhibit higher mass fractions in metals, so that their ICM is more metal-rich.\nThis again supports the interpretation that in the potential wells of low-mass\nsystems the star-formation efficiency of galaxies was high or, alternatively,\nsome gas is missing from the hot phase of the ICM.

This 'heartbeat' state is characterized by a bright\nflare that recurs every ~50-100 seconds, but the profile and duration of the\nflares varies significantly from observation to observation. Based on a\ncomprehensive, phase-resolved study of heartbeats in the RXTE archive, we\ndemonstrate that very different X-ray lightcurves do not require origins in\ndifferent accretion processes. Indeed, our detailed comparison of the\nphase-resolved spectra of a double-peaked oscillation and a single-peaked\noscillation shows that different cycles can have basically similar X-ray\nspectral evolution.

Abstract: Direct collapse of supermassive stars (SMSs) is a possible pathway for\ngenerating supermassive black holes in the early universe. It is expected that\nan SMS could form via very rapid mass accretion with Mdot ~ 0.1 - 1 Msun/yr\nduring the gravitational collapse of an atomic-cooling primordial gas cloud. In\nthis paper we study how stars would evolve under such extreme rapid mass\naccretion, focusing on the early evolution until the stellar mass reaches 1000\nMsun. To this end we numerically calculate the detailed interior structure of\naccreting stars with primordial element abundances. Our results show that for\naccretion rates higher than 0.01 Msun/yr, stellar evolution is qualitatively\ndifferent from that expected at lower rates. While accreting at these high\nrates the star always has a radius exceeding 100 Rsun, which increases\nmonotonically with the stellar mass. The mass-radius relation for stellar\nmasses exceeding ~ 100 Msun follows the same track with R_* \\propto M_*^0.5 in\nall cases with accretion rates > 0.01 Msun/yr; at a stellar mass of 1000 Msun\nthe radius is about 7000 Rsun (~= 30 AU). With higher accretion rates the onset\nof hydrogen burning is shifted towards higher stellar masses. In particular,\nfor accretion rates exceeding Mdot > 0.1 Msun/yr, there is no significant\nhydrogen burning even after 1000 Msun have accreted onto the protostar. Such\n\"supergiant\" protostars have effective temperatures as low as Teff ~= 5000 K\nthroughout their evolution and because they hardly emit ionizing photons, they\ndo not create an HII region or significantly heat their immediate surroundings.\nThus, radiative feedback is unable to hinder the growth of rapidly accreting\nstars to masses in excess of 1000 Msun, as long as material is accreted at\nrates Mdot > 0.01 Msun/yr. \n\n"}

Evidence from\nboth observations and numerical models suggest that Xco varies smoothly with\nthe physical properties of galaxies, and that Xco can be parameterised simply\nas a function of both gas phase metallicity and observed CO surface brightness.\nWhen applying this functional form, we find fgas ~10-40 % in galaxies with\nM*=10^10-10^12 Msun at high-z.

For high but\nsub-critical eccentricities, all the stellar mass is accreted onto the black\nhole in a finite time, causing a significant deviation from the canonical\n$t^{-5/3}$ mass fallback rate. When a star is on a moderately eccentric orbit\nand its pericenter distance is deeply inside the tidal disruption radius, there\ncan be several orbit crossings of the debris streams due to relativistic\nprecession.

One method that has\nbeen proposed to account for these effects is to allow several additional\nparameters (that characterize dark matter halos) to vary and to fit lensing\ndata to these halo parameters concurrently with the standard set of\ncosmological parameters. We test this method. In particular, we use this\ntechnique to model convergence power spectrum predictions from a set of\ncosmological simulations. We estimate biases in dark energy equation of state\nparameters that would be incurred if one were to fit the spectra predicted by\nthe simulations either with no model for baryons, or with the proposed method.\nWe show that neglecting baryonic effect leads to biases in dark energy\nparameters that are several times the statistical errors for a survey like the\nDark Energy Survey. The proposed method to correct for baryonic effects renders\nthe residual biases in dark energy equation of state parameters smaller than\nthe statistical errors. These results suggest that this mitigation method may\nbe applied to analyze convergence spectra from a survey like the Dark Energy\nSurvey. For significantly larger surveys, such as will be carried out by the\nLarge Synoptic Survey Telescope, the biases introduced by baryonic effects are\nmuch more significant. We show that this mitigation technique significantly\nreduces the biases for such larger surveys, but that a more effective\nmitigation strategy will need to be developed in order ensure that the residual\nbiases in these surveys fall below the statistical errors. \n\n"}

In the literature, many attempts have\nbeen made to determine the equation-of-state parameter (EoS) of WDM. However,\nin most of the previous works, it is usually assumed that the EoS of dark\nmatter (DM) is constant (and usually the EoS of dark energy is also constant).\nObviously, this assumption is fairly restrictive. It is more natural to assume\na variable EoS for WDM (and dark energy). In the present work, we try to\nconstrain the EoS of variable WDM with the current cosmological observations.\nWe find that the best fits indicate WDM, while CDM is still consistent with the\ncurrent observational data. However, $\\Lambda$CDM is still better than WDM\nmodels from the viewpoint of goodness-of-fit. So, in order to distinguish WDM\nand CDM, the further observations on the small/galactic scale are required.

In this paper, we discuss the impact of the\nwarmer CMB on (sub-)millimeter observations of high-redshift galaxies. The CMB\naffects the observed (sub-)millimeter dust continuum and the line emission\n(e.g. carbon monoxide, CO) in two ways: (i) it provides an additional source of\n(both dust and gas) heating; and (ii) it is a non-negligible background against\nwhich the line and continuum emission are measured.

Our primary result is that X-ray radiation from the\nshocks inhibits wind acceleration and can lead to a lower pre-shock velocity,\nand a correspondingly lower shocked plasma temperature, yet the intrinsic X-ray\nluminosity of the shocks, LX remains largely unaltered, with the exception of a\nmodest increase at small binary separations. Due to the feedback loop between\nthe ionizing X-rays from the shocks and the wind-driving, we term this scenario\nas self regulated shocks. This effect is found to greatly increase the range of\nbinary separations at which a wind-photosphere collision is likely to occur in\nsystems where the momenta of the two winds are significantly different.\nFurthermore, the excessive levels of X-ray ionization close to the shocks\ncompletely suppresses the line force, and we suggest that this may render\nradiative braking less effective.

In this article, a Monte Carlo\nsimulation chain for acoustic neutrino detection devices in water is presented.\nIt is designed within the SeaTray/IceTray software framework. Its modular\narchitecture is highly flexible and makes it easy to adapt to different\nenvironmental conditions, detector geometries, and hardware. The simulation\nchain covers the generation of the acoustic pulse produced by a neutrino\ninteraction and the propagation to the sensors within the detector. In this\nphase of the development, ambient and transient noise models for the\nMediterranean Sea and simulations of the data acquisition hardware, similar to\nthe one used in ANTARES/AMADEUS, are implemented. A pre-selection scheme for\nneutrino-like signals based on matched filtering is employed, as it can be used\nfor on-line filtering. To simulate the whole processing chain for experimental\ndata, signal classification and acoustic source reconstruction algorithms are\nintegrated. In this contribution, an overview of the design and capabilities of\nthe simulation chain will be given, and some applications and preliminary\nstudies will be presented. \n\n"}

The flavor content of the signal evolves\ndue to both neutrino collective effects and matter effects which can lead to a\nhighly interesting interplay and distinctive spectral features. In this paper\nwe investigate the supernova neutrino flavor evolution in three different\nprogenitors and include collective flavor effects, the evolution of the\nMikheyev, Smirnov & Wolfenstein conversion due to the shock wave passage\nthrough the star, and the impact of turbulence. In the Oxygen-Neon-Magnesium\nsupernova we find that the impact of turbulence is both brief and slight during\na window of 1-2 seconds post bounce. Thus the spectral features of collective\nand shock effects in the neutrino signals from ONeMg supernovae may be almost\nturbulence free making them the easiest to interpret. For the more massive\nprogenitors we again find that small amplitude turbulence, up to 10%, leads to\na minimal modification of the signal, and the emerging neutrino spectra retain\nboth collective and MSW features. However, when larger amounts of turbulence is\nadded, 30% and 50%, the features of collective and shock wave effects in the\nhigh density resonance channel are almost completely obscured at late times.\nYet at the same time we find the other mixing channels - the low density\nresonance channel and the non-resonant channels - begin to develop turbulence\nsignatures. Large amplitude turbulent motions in the outer layers of more\nmassive, iron core-collapse supernovae may obscure the most obvious\nfingerprints of collective and shock wave effects in the neutrino signal but\ncannot remove them completely, and additionally bring about new features in the\nsignal. \n\n"}

We suggest that the clump forms as its\nparent cloud collapses more along the large scale B field. In this process, the\nnorthern part carries over most of the angular momentum, forming a fast\nrotating system, and pulls the B field into a toroidal configuration. In\ncontrast, the southern part is not significantly rotating and the B field\nremains in a poloidal configuration.

These\nchallenges urge rethinking of magnetar. Wind braking of magnetars is one of the\nalternative modelings. The release of magnetic energy may generate a particle\noutflow (i.e., particle wind), that results in both an anomalous X-ray\nluminosity and significantly high spindown rate. In this wind braking scenario,\nonly strong multipole field is necessary for a magnetar (a strong dipole field\nis no longer needed). Wind braking of magnetars may help us to understand their\nmultiwave radiation properties, including (1) Non-detection of magnetars in\nFermi-LAT observations, (2) The timing behaviors of low magnetic field\nmagnetars, (3) The nature of anti-glitches, (4) The criterion for magnetar's\nradio emission, etc. In the wind braking model of magentars, timing events of\nmagnetars should always be accompanied by radiative events. It is worth noting\nthat the wind engine should be the central point in the research since other\nefforts with any reasonable energy mechanism may also reproduce the results. \n\n"}

Several independent studies suggest\nthe presence of more than one stellar populations in the bulge, with different\norigins and a relative fraction changing across the bulge area. This is the\nfirst of a series of papers presenting the results of the Giraffe Inner Bulge\nSurvey, carried out at the ESO-VLT with the multifibre spectrograph FLAMES.\nSpectra of ~5000 red clump giants in 24 bulge fields have been obtained at\nresolution R=6500, in the infrared Calcium triplet wavelength region at 8500\n{\\AA}. They are used to derive radial velocities and metallicities, based on\nnew calibration specifically devised for this project. Radial velocities for\nanother ~1200 bulge red clump giants, obtained from similar archive data, have\nbeen added to the sample. Higher resolution spectra have been obtained for 450\nadditional stars at latitude b=-3.5, with the aim of investigating chemical\nabundance patterns variations with longitude, across the inner bulge. In total\nwe present here radial velocities for 6392 RC stars. We derive a radial\nvelocity, and velocity dispersion map of the Milky Way bulge, useful to be\ncompared with similar maps of external bulges, and to infer the expected\nvelocities and dispersion at any line of sight. The K-type giants kinematics is\nconsistent with the cylindrical rotation pattern of M-giants from the BRAVA\nsurvey. Our sample enables to extend this result to latitude b=-2, closer to\nthe Galactic plane than probed by previous surveys. Finally, we find strong\nevidence for a velocity dispersion peak at (0,-1) and (0,-2), possibly\nindicative of a high density peak in the central 250 pc of the bulge \n\n"}

Using high-resolution\nobservations of plage magnetic fields made with the Solar Optical Telescope\naboard the Hinode satellite, we investigate this idea by estimating the upward\ntransport of magnetic energy --- the vertical Poynting flux, S_z --- across the\nphotosphere in a plage region. To do so, we combine: (i) estimates of\nphotospheric horizontal velocities, v_h, determined by local correlation\ntracking applied to a sequence of line-of-sight magnetic field maps from the\nNarrowband Filter Imager, with (ii) a vector magnetic field measurement from\nthe SpectroPolarimeter. Plage fields are ideal observational targets for\nestimating energy injection by convection, because they are: (i) strong enough\nto be measured with relatively small uncertainties; (ii) not so strong that\nconvection is heavily suppressed (as within umbrae); and (iii) unipolar, so S_z\nin plage is not influenced by mixed-polarity processes (e.g., flux emergence)\nunrelated to heating in stable, active-region fields.

We find that the fastest\ngrowing linear MRI structures on both local and global domains can look very\ndifferent to the eigenmodes, invariably resembling waves shearing with the\nbackground flow (shear waves). In addition, such structures can grow many times\nfaster than the least stable eigenmode over long time periods, and be localized\nin a completely different region of space. These ideas lead -- for both\naxisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes -- to a natural connection between the\nglobal MRI and the local shearing box approximation. By illustrating that the\nfastest growing global structure is well described by the ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs) governing a single shear wave, we find that the shearing box\nis a very sensible approximation for the linear MRI, contrary to many previous\nclaims. Since the shear wave ODEs are most naturally understood using nonmodal\nanalysis techniques, we conclude by analyzing local MRI growth over finite\ntime-scales using these methods.

The high efficiency of bulge formation is in tension with\nobservations in the local universe of a large amount of bulge-less spiral\ngalaxies. In the present work, the formation of bulges in very gas-rich\ngalaxies, as those in the early universe, is studied in the Milgrom's MOdified\nNewtonian Dynamics (MOND), through multi-grid simulations of the non-linear\ngravity, including the gas dissipation, star formation and feedback.\n  Clumpy disks are rapidly formed, as in their Newtonian equivalent systems.\nHowever, the dynamical friction is not as efficient, in the absence of dark\nmatter halos, and the clumps have no time to coalesce into the center to form\nbulges, before they are eroded by stellar feedback and shear forces.

No published model with a single lens can account\nfor all of the observed characteristics of this complex system. Based on radio\nobservations, one expects time delayed variability to follow about 25 days\nafter a primary flare, with flux about a factor 1.5 less. Two large gamma-ray\nflares of PKS 1830-211 have been detected by the LAT in the considered period\nand no substantial evidence for such a delayed activity was found. This allows\nus to place a lower limit of about 6 on the gamma rays flux ratio between the\ntwo lensed images.

It is generally accepted that these jets are powered\nelectromagnetically, by the magnetised rotation of a central compact object.\nHowever, how they produce the observed emission and survive the propagation for\nmany orders of magnitude in distance without being disrupted by current-driven\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities is the subject of active debate. We carry out\ntime-dependent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic,\nPoynting flux dominated jets. The jets are launched self-consistently by the\nrotation of a strongly magnetised central compact object. This determines the\nnatural degree of azimuthal magnetic field winding, a crucial factor that\ncontrols jet stability. We find that the jets are susceptible to two types of\ninstability: (i) a global, external kink mode that grows on long time scales\nand causes the jets to bodily bend sideways. Whereas this mode does not cause\njet disruption over the simulated distances, it substantially reduces jet\npropagation speed. We show, via an analytic model, that the growth of the\nexternal kink mode depends on the slope of the ambient medium density profile.\nIn flat density distributions characteristic of galactic cores, an AGN jet may\nstall, whereas in stellar envelopes the external kink weakens as the jet\npropagates outward; (ii) a local, internal kink mode that grows over short time\nscales and causes small-angle magnetic reconnection and conversion of about\nhalf of jet electromagnetic energy flux into heat.

Abstract: The origin of the ultra-high-energy particles we receive on the Earth from\nthe outer space such as EeV cosmic rays and PeV neutrinos remains an enigma.\nAll mechanisms known to us currently make use of electromagnetic interaction to\naccelerate charged particles. In this paper we propose a mechanism exclusively\nbased on gravity rather than electromagnetic interaction. We show that it is\npossible to generate ultra-high-energy particles starting from particles with\nmoderate energies using the collisional Penrose process in an overspinning Kerr\nspacetime transcending the Kerr bound only by an infinitesimal amount, i.e.,\nwith the Kerr parameter $a=M(1+\\epsilon)$, where we take the limit $\\epsilon\n\\rightarrow 0^+$. We consider two massive particles starting from rest at\ninfinity that collide at $r=M$ with divergent center-of-mass energy and produce\ntwo massless particles. We show that massless particles produced in the\ncollision can escape to infinity with the ultra-high energies exploiting the\ncollisional Penrose process with the divergent efficiency $\\eta \\sim\n{1}/{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}} \\rightarrow \\infty$. Assuming the isotropic emission of\nmassless particles in the center-of-mass frame of the colliding particles, we\nshow that half of the particles created in the collisions escape to infinity\nwith the divergent energies. To a distant observer, ultra-high-energy particles\nappear to originate from a bright spot which is at the angular location $\\xi\n\\sim {2M}/{r_{obs}}$ with respect to the singularity on the side which is\nrotating towards the observer. We show that the anisotropy in emission in the\ncenter-of-mass frame, which is dictated by the differential cross-section of\nunderlying particle physics process, leaves a district signature on the\nspectrum of ultra-high-energy massless particles. Thus, it provides a unique\nprobe into fundamental particle physics. \n\n"}

Such solutions are often difficult to find in\nbeyond-general-relativity theories due to the inclusion of additional fields\nthat couple to the metric non-linearly and non-minimally. In this paper, we\nconsider rotating black hole solutions in one such theory, dynamical\nChern-Simons gravity, where the Einstein-Hilbert action is modified by the\nintroduction of a dynamical scalar field that couples to the metric through the\nPontryagin density. We treat dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as an effective\nfield theory and work in the decoupling limit, where corrections are treated as\nsmall perturbations from general relativity.

We have also applied an X-ray\nspectral stacking method to different sub-samples. We confirm the well-known\nIwasawa-Taniguchi effect in our luminosity-redshift sub-samples, and argue that\nsuch an effect is due to a decrease in the covering factor of a distant\nobscuring torus with increasing X-ray luminosity.

Extragalactic cosmic rays\nshould be isotropic, but galactic cosmic rays of this type should be seen\nmostly along the galactic plane, and there should be a shortage of events\ncoming from directions near the galactic anticenter. This is due to the fact\nthat, under the influence of the galactic magnetic field, the transition from\nballistic to diffusive behavior is well advanced, and this qualitative picture\npersists over the whole energy range. Guided by models of the galactic magnetic\nfield that indicate that the enhancement along the galactic plane should have a\nstandard deviation of about 20$^\\circ$ in galactic latitude, and the deficit in\nthe galactic anticenter direction should have a standard deviation of about\n50$^\\circ$ in galactic longitude, we use the data of the Telescope Array\nsurface detector in $10^{18.0}$ to $10^{18.5}$ eV energy range to search for\nthese effects.

Physical properties derived from spectral energy\n  distributions Abstract: We characterise the physical nature of a 1.1 mm-selected, flux-limited, and\ninterferometrically followed up sample of SMGs in COSMOS. We used the MAGPHYS\ncode to fit the multiwavelength (UV-radio) SEDs of 16 of the target SMGs. We\nalso constructed the pure radio SEDs of our SMGs using three different radio\nbands (325 MHz, 1.4 GHz, and 3 GHz). Moreover, since two SMGs in our sample,\nAzTEC1 and AzTEC3, benefit from previous CO line observations, we studied their\nproperties in more detail. We found that 63% of our target SMGs lie above the\ngalaxy main-sequence by more than a factor of 3, and hence are starbursts. The\n3 GHz radio sizes we have previously measured for the target SMGs were compared\nwith the present stellar mass estimates, and we found that the z>3 SMGs are\nfairly consistent with the mass-size relationship of z~2 compact, quiescent\ngalaxies (cQGs). The median IR-radio correlation parameter is found to be\nq=2.27, which is lower than measured locally (median q=2.64). AzTEC1 is found\nto have a sub-Eddington SFR surface density (by a factor of 2.6), while AzTEC3\nappears to be an Eddington-limited starburster. The gas reservoir in these two\nhigh-z SMGs would be exhausted in only ~86 and 19 Myr at the current SFR,\nrespectively. A comparison of the MAGPHYS-based properties of our SMGs with\nthose of equally bright ALESS SMGs suggests that the two populations share\nfairly similar physical characteristics, including the q parameter. A hint of\nnegative correlation is found between the 3 GHz size and the level of\nstarburstiness, and hence cosmic-ray electrons in more compact starbursts might\nbe more susceptible to free-free absorption. Some of the derived low and high q\nvalues (compared to the local median) could be the result of a specific\nmerger/post-starburst phase of galaxy evolution. Overall, our results support\nthe scenario where z>3 SMGs evolve into today's giant ellipticals. \n\n"}

However, the situation is less understood in\ninteracting theories, especially on time scales longer than the dynamical\nrelaxation time. Recently there have been claims that the quantum theory\ndeviates spectacularly from the classical theory on this time scale, even if\nthe occupancy numbers are extremely large. Furthermore, it is claimed that the\nquantum theory quickly thermalizes while the classical theory does not. The\nevidence for these claims comes from noticing a spectacular difference in the\ntime evolution of expectation values of quantum operators compared to the\nclassical micro-state evolution. If true, this would have dramatic consequences\nfor many important phenomena, including laboratory studies of interacting BECs,\ndark matter axions, preheating after inflation, etc. In this work we critically\nexamine these claims. We show that in fact the classical theory can describe\nthe quantum behavior in the high occupancy regime, even when interactions are\nlarge. The connection is that the expectation values of quantum operators in a\nsingle quantum micro-state are approximated by a corresponding classical\nensemble average over many classical micro-states. Furthermore, by the ergodic\ntheorem, a classical ensemble average of local fields with statistical\ntranslation invariance is the spatial average of a single micro-state. So the\ncorrelation functions of the quantum and classical field theories of a single\nmicro-state approximately agree at high occupancy, even in interacting systems.\nFurthermore, both quantum and classical field theories can thermalize, when\nappropriate coarse graining is introduced, with the classical case requiring a\ncutoff on low occupancy UV modes.

(2013) and to investigate the structure of the disk.\n  Methods: We image the disk around HD~97048 using ALMA at 0.85~mm and 2.94~mm,\nand ATCA (multiple frequencies) observations. Our observations also include the\n12CO J=1-0, 12CO J=3-2 and HCO+ J=4-3 emission lines.\n  Results: A central cavity in the disk around HD~97048 is resolved with a\n40-46 au radius. Additional radial structure present in the surface brightness\nprofile can be accounted for either by an opacity gap at ~90 au or by an extra\nemitting ring at ~150 au.

The 12CO emission can be traced down to $\\approx$ 10 au scales.\nNon-Keplerian kinematics are detected inside the cavity via the HCO+ J=4-3\nvelocity map.

Here we present a\nnovel approach to study the stability of hierarchical three-body systems at\narbitrary inclinations, which accounts not only for the instantaneous stability\nof such systems, but also for the secular stability and evolution through\nLidov-Kozai cycles and evection. We generalize the Hill-stability criteria to\narbitrarily inclined triple systems, explain the existence of quasi-stable\nregimes and characterize the inclination dependence of their stability.

In particular, we find\nthat the asymptotic radial evolution of the Lorentz factor is not strongly\nmodified whether radiation can stream through the reconnection layer or not. On\nthe other hand, we show that the width, density and temperature of the\nreconnection layer are strongly dependent on these assumptions.

This study presents a preliminary set of evolutionary models of\ncompact stellar clusters with initial masses ranging over\n$1.0\\times10^4M_\\odot-5.0\\times10^4M_\\odot$, and half-mass radius of 2 pc or 1\npc, that is typical for young massive and starburst clusters. They have\nmetallicities between $0.05Z_\\odot-Z_\\odot$. Including contemporary schemes for\nstellar wind and remnant-formation, such model clusters are evolved, for the\nfirst time, using the state-of-the-art direct N-body evolution program NBODY7,\nuntil their dissolution or at least for 10 Gyr. That way, a self-regulatory\nbehaviour in the effects of dynamical interactions among the BHs, especially\nwhile heating and expanding the cluster and self-depleting the BHs, is\ndemonstrated. The BBH mergers obtained here show a prominence in\ntriple-mediated mergers while being bound to the clusters, compared to those\noccurring among the BBHs that are dynamically ejected from the clusters. This\nis in contrast with earlier N-body computations and also with recent\nMonte-Carlo method based ones. A broader mass spectrum of BHs and ejection of\nBBHs generally of wider orbits and in lower numbers, for the cluster masses\nexplored here, might cause this which is yet to be fully understood. Among the\nBBH coalescences obtained here, there are ones that resemble the detected\nGW151226, LVT151012, and GW150914 events and also ones which are even more\nmassive. A preliminary estimate suggests few 10s - 100s of BBH coalescences per\nyear, originating due to dynamics in stellar clusters, that can be detected by\nthe LIGO at its design sensitivity. \n\n"}

This calibrated tau353-NH relationship shows that the amount\nof the HI gas can be underestimated to be ~60% if the optically-thin HI method\nis used.

In vegetation, these\nsignals are the direct result of the chirality of the supramolecular\naggregates. The circular polarization is thus directly influenced by the\ncomposition and architecture of the photosynthetic macrodomains, and is thereby\nlinked to photosynthetic functioning. Although ordinarily measured only on a\nmolecular level, we have developed a new spectropolarimetric instrument,\nTreePol, that allows for both laboratory and in-the-field measurements. Through\nspectral multiplexing, TreePol is capable of fast measurements with a\nsensitivity of $\\sim 1*10^{-4}$ and is therefore suitable of non-destructively\nprobing the molecular architecture of whole plant leaves.

The SDSS-Gaia proper motions have typical\nstatistical errors of 2 mas/yr down to r ~ 20 mag, and are robust to variations\nwith magnitude and colour. Armed with this exquisite set of halo proper\nmotions, we identify RR Lyrae, blue horizontal branch (BHB), and K giant stars\nin the halo, and measure their net rotation with respect to the Galactic disc.\nWe find evidence for a gently rotating prograde signal (< $V_\\phi$ > ~ 5-25\nkm/s) in the halo stars, which shows little variation with Galactocentric\nradius out to 50 kpc. The average rotation signal for the three populations is\n< $V_\\phi$ > = 14 +/- 2 +/- 10 (syst.) km/s.

The aim is to establish whether SAMs are able to show galactic\nconformity using different models and selection criteria. In all the models,\nwhen the selection of primary galaxies is based on an isolation criterion in\nreal space, the mean fraction of quenched galaxies around quenched primary\ngalaxies is higher than that around star-forming primary galaxies of the same\nstellar mass. The overall signal of conformity decreases when we remove\nsatellites selected as primary galaxies, but the effect is much stronger in\nGALFORM models compared with the L-GALAXIES model. We find this difference is\npartially explained by the fact that in GALFORM once a galaxy becomes a\nsatellite remains as such, whereas satellites can become centrals at a later\ntime in L-GALAXIES. The signal of conformity decreases down to 60% in the\nL-GALAXIES model after removing central galaxies that were ejected from their\nhost halo in the past. Galactic conformity is also influenced by primary\ngalaxies at fixed stellar mass that reside in dark matter haloes of different\nmasses. Finally, we explore a proxy of conformity between distinct haloes. In\nthis case the conformity is weak beyond ~ 3 Mpc/h (<3% in L-GALAXIES, <1-2% in\nGALFORM models).

Simultaneous observations of both period and decay rate\ntherefore reveal the eigenfrequency of the observed mode, and potentially\ninsight into the tubes' nonuniform internal structure.

Grids of 3D\n  corrections in the UBVRI, 2MASS, Hipparcos, Gaia, and SDSS systems Abstract: The atmospheres of cool stars are temporally and spatially inhomogeneous due\nto the effects of convection.The influence of this inhomogeneity, referred to\nas granulation, on colours has never been investigated over a large range of\neffective temperatures and gravities. We aim to study, in a quantitative way,\nthe impact of granulation on colours. We use the CIFIST grid of CO5BOLD\nhydrodynamical models to compute emerging fluxes. These in turn are used to\ncompute theoretical colours in the UBVRI,2MASS,Hipparcos,Gaia and SDSS systems.\nEvery CO5BOLD model has a corresponding one dimensional (1D) plane-parallel LHD\nmodel computed for the same atmospheric parameters, which we used to define a\n\"3D correction\" that can be applied to colours computed from fluxes computed\nfrom any 1D model atmosphere code. The 3D corrections on colours are generally\nsmall, of the order of a few hundredths of a magnitude, yet they are far from\nnegligible. We find that ignoring granulation effects can lead to\nunderestimation of Teff by up to 200K and overestimation of gravity by up to\n0.5dex, when using colours as diagnostics. We have identified a major\nshortcoming in how scattering is treated in the current version of the CIFIST\ngrid, which could lead to offsets of the order 0.01mag, especially for colours\ninvolving blue and UV bands.We have investigated the Gaia and Hipparcos\nphotometric systems and found that the (G-H_p),(BP-RP) diagram is immune to the\neffects of granulation. In addition, we point to the potential of the RVS\nphotometry as a metallicity diagnostic. Our investigation shows that the\neffects of granulation should not be neglected if one wants to use colours as\ndiagnostics of the stellar parameters of F,G,K stars. A limitation is that\nscattering is treated as true absorption in our current computations, thus our\n3D corrections are likely an upper limit to the true effect. (Abridged) \n\n"}

We also discover 1 lens identified through a\nquasar emission line in an SDSS galaxy spectrum.

Due to the copious radiative power of the nucleus, the effects of\nradiative feedback can be detected over the entire host galaxy and sometimes\nwell into the intergalactic space. In this paper we model the observed\nsize-luminosity relationship of the narrow-line regions (NLRs) of AGN. We model\nthe NLR as a collection of clouds in pressure equilibrium with the ionizing\nradiation, with each cloud producing line emission calculated by Cloudy. The\nsizes of the NLRs of powerful quasars are reproduced without any free\nparameters, as long as they contain massive ($10^5 - 10^7 M_\\odot$)\nionization-bounded clouds. At lower AGN luminosities the observed sizes are\nlarger than the model sizes, likely due to additional unmodeled sources of\nionization (e.g., star formation). We find that the observed saturation of\nsizes at $\\sim 10$ kpc which is observed at high AGN luminosities\n($L_\\text{ion} \\simeq 10^{46}$ erg/s) is naturally explained by optically thick\nclouds absorbing the ionizing radiation and preventing illumination beyond a\ncritical distance.

The errors are\nquantified through the numerical reversibility of small-$N$ spherical systems,\nand by comparing fixed-timestep runs with different stepsizes. The errors add\nrandomly, before exponential divergence sets in, with exponentiation rate\nvirtually independent of $N$, but scale saturating as $\\sim 1/\\sqrt{N}$, in\nline with theoretical estimates presented. In a third phase, the growth rate is\ninitially driven by multiplicative enhancement of errors, as in the exponential\nstage. It is then qualitatively different for the phase space variables and\nmean field conserved quantities (energy and momentum); for the former, the\nerrors grow systematically through phase mixing, for the latter they grow\ndiffusively. For energy, the $N$-variation of the `relaxation time' of error\ngrowth follows the $N$-scaling of two-body relaxation. This is also true for\nangular momentum in the fixed stepsize runs, although the associated error\nthreshold is higher and the relaxation time smaller. Due to shrinking\nsaturation scales, the information loss associated with the exponential\ninstability decreases with $N$ and the dynamical entropy vanishes at any finite\nresolution as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$. A distribution function depending on the\nintegrals of motion in the smooth potential is decreasingly affected. In this\nsense there is convergence to the collisionless limit, despite the persistence\nof exponential instability on infinitesimal scales.

Archival X-ray data from\n80 different observations of HR 1099 acquired with 12 different X-ray\nfacilities and covering almost four decades were used to determine X-ray fluxes\nin the energy range of 2-10 keV via spectral fitting and flux conversion.

This article presents the modeling of the\nazimuthal-to-radial axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid of galactic disks from\nstellar dispersion maps using integral field spectroscopy data of the CALIFA\nsurvey. The measured azimuthal anisotropy is shown to be not strongly dependent\non the assumed vertical-to-radial dispersion ratio of the ellipsoid. The\nanisotropy distribution shows a large diversity in the orbital structure of\ndisk galaxies from tangential to radial stellar orbits. Globally, the orbits\nare isotropic in inner disk regions and become more radial as a function of\nradius, although this picture tends to depend on galaxy morphology and\nluminosity. The Milky Way orbital anisotropy profile measured from the Second\nGaia Data Release is consistent with those of CALIFA galaxies. A new\ncorrelation is evidenced, linking the absolute magnitude or stellar mass of the\ndisks to the azimuthal anisotropy. More luminous disks have more radial orbits\nand less luminous disks have isotropic and somewhat tangential orbits. This\ncorrelation is consistent with the picture in galaxy evolution in which orbits\nbecome more radial as the mass grows and is redistributed as a function of\ntime. With the help of circular velocity curves, it is also shown that the\nepicycle theory fails to reproduce the diversity of the azimuthal anisotropy of\nstellar random motions, as it predicts only nearly radial orbits in the\npresence of flat curves. The origin of this conflict is yet to be identified.\nIt also questions the validity of the vertical-to-radial axis ratio of the\nvelocity ellipsoid derived by many studies in the framework of the epicyclic\napproximation. \n\n"}

Abstract: It is well established that the central deficit of dark matter (DM) observed\nin many dwarf galaxies disagrees with the cuspy DM haloes predicted in the\ncollision-less and cold DM (CDM) model. Plausible solutions to this problem are\nbased on an effective energy deposition into the central halo with an origin\nthat is either based on baryonic physics (e.g. supernova-driven gas blowouts;\nSNF) or on new DM physics (e.g. self-interacting DM, SIDM). We argue that the\nfundamental difference between the two is whether the process is impulsive or\nadiabatic, and explore novel ways to distinguishing them by looking at the\nresponse of stellar orbits. We perform idealised simulations of tracers\nembedded in a $1.48\\times 10^{10}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ spherical halo, and model the\ncreation of a $\\sim1$kpc DM matter core in SIDM with $\\sigma_T/m_{\\chi} =\n2\\,{\\rm cm}^2{\\rm g}^{-1}$ and through SNF by impulsively removing a mass\nequivalent to $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$ of the halo's potential energy.

If the orientation of the galaxy image is determined\neither by the angular momentum or the shape of the halo in which it forms, then\nthe image should be aligned preferentially with the component of the tidal\ngravitational field perpendicular to the line of sight. Long-range correlations\nin the tidal field will thus lead to long-range ellipticity-ellipticity\ncorrelations that mimic the shear correlations due to weak gravitational\nlensing. We calculate the ellipticity-ellipticity correlation expected if halo\nshapes determine the observed galaxy shape, and we discuss uncertainties (which\nare still considerable) in the predicted amplitude of this correlation.

Herein, we detail an implementation of the Mixture Model\ndensity estimation based on multi-resolutional KD-trees which makes this\nstatistical technique into a computationally tractable problem. We provide the\ntheoretical and experimental background for using a mixture model of Gaussians\nbased on the Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithm. Applying these analyses\nto simulated data sets we show that the EM algorithm - using the AIC penalized\nlikelihood to score the fit - out-performs the best kernel density estimate of\nthe distribution while requiring no ``fine--tuning'' of the input algorithm\nparameters.

Hence, we assume that a prompt explosion can occur and make a\nstudy of r-process nucleosynthesis in the supernova ejecta. To achieve a prompt\nexplosion we have performed a general relativistic hydrodynamic simulation of\nadiabatic collapse and bounce using a relativistic nuclear-matter equation of\nstate. The electron fraction $Y_e$ during the collapse was fixed at the\ninitial-model value. The size of the inner collapsing core was then large\nenough to enable a prompt explosion to occur. Adopting the calculated\ntrajectories of promptly ejected material, we explicitly computed the burst of\nneutronization due to electron captures on free protons in the photodissociated\nejecta after the passage of the shock. The thermal and compositional evolution\nof the resulting neutron-rich ejecta originating from near the surface of\nproto-neutron star was obtained. These were used in nuclear reaction network\ncalculations to evaluate the products of $r$-process nucleosynthesis. We find\nthat, unlike earlier studies, the amount of $r$-process material ejected per\nsupernova is quite consistent with observed galactic $r$-process abundances.\nFurthermore, the computed $r$-process abundances are in good agreement with\nSolar abundances of $r$-process elements for A$> 100$. This suggests that\nprompt supernovae are still a viable $r$-process site. Such events may be\nresponsible for the abundances of the heaviest $r$-process nuclei. \n\n"}

Our\nanalysis takes into account the rapid rotation of the star and the lift-up of\nthe burning ocean during the burst. We find a new regime for spreading of a\nnuclear burning front, where the flame is carried along a coherent shear flow\nacross the front. If turbulent viscosity is weak, the speed of flame\npropagation is ~20 km/s, while, if turbulent viscosity is dynamically\nimportant, the flame speed increases, and reaches the maximum value, ~300 km/s,\nwhen the eddy overturn frequency is comparable to the Coriolis parameter. We\nshow that, due to rotationally reduced gravity, the thermonuclear runaway is\nlikely to begin on the equator. The equatorial belt is ignited first, and the\nflame then propagates from the equator to the poles. Inhomogeneous cooling\n(equator first, poles second) drives strong zonal currents which may be\nunstable to formation of Jupiter-type vortices; we conjecture that these\nvortices are responsible for modulation of X-ray flux in the tails of some\nbursts. We consider the effect of strong zonal currents on the frequency of\nmodulation of the X-ray flux and show that the large values of the frequency\ndrifts observed in some bursts can be accounted for within our model combined\nwith the model of homogeneous radial expansion. Also, if inhomogeneities are\ntrapped in the forward zonal flows around the propagating burning front, chirps\nwith large frequency ranges (~25-500 Hz) may be detectable during the burst\nrise.

In order to explore the\norigin of these subluminous stars, we evolved a set of low-mass stars from the\nmain sequence through the helium-core flash to the HB for a wide range in the\nmass loss along the red-giant branch (RGB). Stars with the largest mass loss\nevolve off the RGB to high effective temperatures before igniting helium in\ntheir cores. Our results indicate that the subluminous EHB stars, as well as\nthe gap within the EHB of NGC 2808, can be explained if these stars undergo a\nlate helium-core flash on the white-dwarf cooling curve. Under these conditions\nthe flash convection will penetrate into the stellar envelope, thereby mixing\nmost, if not all, of the envelope hydrogen into the hot helium- burning\ninterior. This phenomenon is analogous to the \"born-again\" scenario for\nproducing hydrogen-deficient stars during a very late helium-shell flash.\n\"Flash mixing\" greatly enhances the envelope helium and carbon abundances and,\nas a result, leads to an abrupt increase in the HB effective temperature.

Various\nsearches based on different techniques explored the frequency of compact\nobjects over more than 15 orders of magnitude, so far mostly providing null\nresults in mass ranges different from the ones just mentioned. Combined, the\nlensing results offer some interesting limits on the cosmological frequency of\ncompact objects in the mass interval 10^{-3} <= M/M_odot <= 10^{15},\nunfortunately still with some gaps in between. In the near future, further\nstudies along these lines promise to fill the gaps and to push the limits\nfurther down, or they might even detect new object classes. \n\n"}

Out of about 600 pointed RXTE\nobservations, the source was found to exhibit such state transition only on 16\noccasions.

The X-ray light curve and\ncolor-color diagram of the source during these observations are found to be\ndifferent from any reported so far. The duration of these dips is found to be\nof the order of a few tens of seconds with a repetition time of a few hundred\nseconds. The transition between these dips and non-dips which differ in\nintensity by a factor of ~ 3.5, is observed to be very fast (~ a few seconds).\nIt is observed that the low-frequency narrow QPOs are absent in the power\ndensity spectrum (PDS) of the dip and non-dip regions of class $\\omega$ and the\nPDS is a power law in 0.1 - 10 Hz frequency range.

In our AGB model mixing persists during the entire\ninterpulse phase due to the steep angular velocity gradient at the\ncore-envelope interface. We follow the neutron production during the interpulse\nphase, and find a resulting maximum neutron exposure of tau_max =0.04 mbarn^-1,\nwhich is too small to produce any significant s-process. In parametric models,\nwe then investigate the combined effects of diffusive overshooting from the\nconvective envelope and rotationally induced mixing. Models with overshoot and\nweaker interpulse mixing - as perhaps expected from more slowly rotating stars\n- yield larger neutron exposures. We conclude that the incorporation of\nrotationally induce mixing processes has important consequences for the\nproduction of heavy elements in AGB stars.

We, especially, carefully solve the behavior of the\ninnermost part of the disk, since it produces significant number of photons\nduring the burst, and fit the theoretical spectra with the multi-color disk\nmodel. The fitting parameters are $\\Tin$ (the maximum disk temperature) and\n$\\Rin$ (the innermost radius of the disk). We find an abrupt, transient\nincrease in $\\Tin$ and a temporary decrease in $\\Rin$ during a burst, which are\nactually observed in GRS 1915+105. The precise behavior is subject to the\nviscosity prescription. We prescribe the radial-azimuthal component of\nviscosity stress tensor to be $T_{r \\phi}=-\\alpha \\Pi (p_{\\rm gas}/p)^{\\mu}$,\nwith $\\Pi$ being the height integrated pressure, $\\alpha$ and $\\mu$ being the\nparameter, and $p$ and $p_{\\rm gas}$ being the total pressure and gas pressure\non the equatorial plane, respectively.

Model with $\\mu=0.2$, on the other hand, gives the\nright amplitudes, but the changes of $\\Tin$ and $\\Rin$ are smaller. Although\nprecise matching is left as future work, we may conclude that the basic\nproperties of the bursts of GRS 1915+105 can be explained by our ``limit-cycle\noscillation'' model. It is then required that the spectral hardening factor at\nhigh luminosities should be about 3 at around the Eddington luminosity instead\nof less than 2 as is usually assumed. \n\n"}

The X-ray emission\nin all 3 regions is highly correlated to similar features observed in Halpha.\nSpectra of the filaments and bulge are well represented by a 0.4 keV MEKAL\nmodel with combined 0.3-2 keV intrinsic luminosity of 1.24x10^{40}erg/s,\nelectron densities ~ 0.02-0.04 cm^{-3}, cooling times of 400-700 Myr and X-ray\ngas mass <~ 3.7x10^8 Msolar.

Abstract: We investigate the large-scale structure of the local galaxy distribution\nusing the recently completed 2 Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). First, we\ndetermine the K-band number counts over the 4000 sq.deg. APM survey area where\nevidence for a large-scale `local hole' has previously been detected and\ncompare them to a homogeneous prediction. Considering a LCDM form for the\n2-point angular correlation function, the observed deficiency represents a 5\nsigma fluctuation in the galaxy distribution. We check the model normalisation\nusing faint K-band data compiled from the literature; the normalisation used in\nthis paper is in excellent agreement, and the observed counts over the APM\nsurvey area would require the model to be lowered by 3.8 sigma. However, the\nissue is complicated by the b>20 and b<-20 2MASS counts which lie below the\nbest-fit model normalisation. Second, since the K-band counts over the APM\nsurvey area continue to suggest the possible presence of excess clustering over\nthe LCDM prediction, we next probe the power at large scales by comparing the\n2MASS and LCDM mock galaxy angular power spectra. We find a 3 sigma excess in\nthe 2MASS catalogue over the LCDM prediction at large scales (l<30). However,\nthis excess is not enough to account for the low counts over the APM survey\narea. Finally, we apply a counts in cells analysis to the 2MASS data and mock\ncatalogues; on the assumption that the 2MASS catalogue at |b|>20 is\nrepresentative, we find excellent agreement between the biased LCDM mocks and\nthe 2MASS catalogue to 30 deg.

We\nsplit the population of galaxies in early types, late types, and intermediate\ntypes, based on their colour and specific star formation rate. At fixed\nluminosity, the early type fraction increases with increasing halo mass. Most\nimportantly, this mass dependence is smooth and persists over the entire mass\nrange probed, without any break or feature at any mass scale. We argue that the\nprevious claim of a characteristic feature on galaxy group scales is an\nartefact of the environment estimators used. At fixed halo mass, the luminosity\ndependence of the type fractions is surprisingly weak: galaxy type depends more\nstrongly on halo mass than on luminosity. We also find that the early type\nfraction decreases with increasing halo-centric radius. Contrary to previous\nstudies, we find that this radial dependence is also present in low mass\nhaloes. The properties of satellite galaxies are strongly correlated with those\nof their central galaxy. In particular, the early type fraction of satellites\nis significantly higher in a halo with an early type central galaxy than in a\nhalo of the same mass but with a late type central galaxy. This phenomenon,\nwhich we call `galactic conformity', is present in haloes of all masses and for\nsatellites of all luminosities.

This is the highest column density\never observed in a DLA, and is about five times larger than the strongest DLA\ndetected so far in any QSO spectrum. From the optical spectrum, we also find a\nvery large Zn column density, allowing us to infer an abundance of\n[Zn/H]=-1.0+/-0.4.

The X-ray light\ncurve displayed a steep early decay (t^-5) for ~200 s and several breaks.\nHowever, both the prompt hard X-ray/gamma-ray emission (observed by the BAT)\nand the first ~ 300 s of X-ray emission (observed by the XRT) can be explained\nby exponential decays, with similar decay constants. Extrapolating the BAT\nlight curve into the XRT band suggests the rapidly decaying, early X-ray\nemission was simply a continuation of the fading prompt emission; this strong\nsimilarity between the prompt gamma-ray and early X-ray emission may be related\nto the simple temporal and spectral character of this X-ray rich GRB. The\nprompt (BAT) spectrum was a steep down to 15 keV, and appeared to continue\nthrough the XRT bandpass, implying a low peak energy, inconsistent with the\nAmati relation.

When corrected from extragalactic absorption by the\ndiffuse infrared background (DIrB), the SSC one-zone models require very high\nLorentz factor (around 50) to avoid strong gamma-gamma absorption. However, the\nstatistics on beamed vs. unbeamed objects, as well as the luminosity contrast,\nfavors much lower Lorentz factor of the order of 3. In this paper, we show that\nfor the special case of Markarian 501, the need for very high Lorentz factor is\nunavoidable for all one-zone models where all photons are assumed to be\nproduced at the same location at the same time. Models assuming a double\nstructure with two different beaming patterns can partially solve the problem\nof luminosity contrast, but we point out that they are inconsistent with the\nstatistics on the number of detected TeV sources. The only way to solve the\nissue is to consider inhomogeneous models, where low energy and high energy\nphotons are not produced at the same place, allowing for much smaller Lorentz\nfactors.

We use high-resolution simulations of idealized cluster mergers to show\nthat they are due to sloshing of the cool gas in the central gravitational\npotential, which is easily set off by minor mergers and can persist for\ngigayears. The only necessary condition is a steep entropy profile, as observed\nin cooling flow clusters. Even if the infalling subcluster has no gas during\ncore passage, the gravitational disturbance sets the main mass peak (gas and\ndark matter together) in motion relative to the surrounding gas. A rapid change\nin the direction of motion causes a change in ram pressure, which pushes the\ncool gas away from the dark matter peak and triggers sloshing. For nonzero\nimpact parameters, the cool gas acquires angular momentum, resulting in a\ncharacteristic spiral pattern of cold fronts. There is little visible\ndisturbance outside the cool core in such a merger. If the subcluster retains\nits gas during core passage, the cool central gas of the main cluster is more\neasily decoupled from the dark matter peak. Subsequently, some of that gas, and\noften the cool gas from the subcluster, falls back to the center and starts\nsloshing. However, in such a merger, global disturbances are readily visible in\nX-rays for a long time. We conclude that cold fronts at the centers of relaxed\nclusters, often spiral or concentric-arc in shape, are probably caused by\nencounters with small subhalos stripped of all their gas at the early infall\nstages. \n\n"}

The QPO properties clearly\nindicate that these double peaks are the kHz QPOs known from low magnetic field\nneutron stars, and not black-hole high-frequency QPOs, confirming that Cir X-1\nis a neutron star. The kHz QPO peak separation varies over a wide range,\n\\~175-340 Hz, and increases with QPO frequency. This is contrary to what is\nseen in other sources but agrees with predictions of the relativistic\nprecession model and Alfven wave models; beat-frequency models require\nmodification to accommodate this. In other observations single kHz QPOs can be\nseen down to frequencies as low as ~12 Hz, as well as a strong low-frequency\n(LF) QPO between 1 and 30 Hz. The relations between the frequencies of the kHz\nQPOs and the LF QPO are in good agreement with those found previously in Z\nsources, confirming that Cir X-1 may be a peculiar Z source. We suggest that\nthe low frequencies of the kHz QPOs in Cir X-1 and to a lesser extent in\n(other) Z sources might be due to a relatively stronger radial inflow to the\nneutron star than in other kHz QPO sources. \n\n"}

Here I discuss the accretion activity\nexpected from the material that is launched into eccentric, but gravitationally\nbound orbits during a compact binary merger coalescence. From a simple\nanalytical model the time scales and accretion luminosities that result from\nfallback in the aftermath of a compact binary merger are derived.

We find that variations of galaxy properties with\nenvironment are almost entirely due to the dependence of morphology and\nluminosity on environment. Because galaxy properties depend not only on\nluminosity but also on morphology, it is clear that galaxy properties cannot be\ndetermined solely by dark halo mass. When morphology and luminosity are fixed,\nother physical properties, such as color, color-gradient, concentration, size,\nvelocity dispersion, and star formation rate, are nearly independent of local\ndensity. The only feature is the sharp decrease of late type fraction above the\ncritical luminosity of about M_r=-21.3 in the morphology versus luminosity\nrelation. Weak residual dependences on environment include that of the color of\nlate-types (bluer at lower density) and of the L-sigma relation of early-types\n(larger dispersion at higher density for bright galaxies). The early-type\nfraction is a monotonically increasing function of local density and\nluminosity. The morphology-density- luminosity relation should be a key\nconstraint on galaxy formation models.

GRB 041219a is\nthe most intense burst localised by INTEGRAL and is an ideal candidate for such\na study. Polarisation can be measured using multiple events scattered into\nadjacent detectors because the Compton scatter angle depends on the\npolarisation of the incoming photon. A search for linear polarisation in the\nmost intense pulse of duration 66 seconds and in the brightest 12 seconds of\nGRB 041219a was performed in the 100-350keV, 100-500keV and 100keV-1MeV energy\nranges. The multiple event data from the spectrometer was analysed and compared\nwith the predicted instrument response obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations\nusing the GEANT 4 INTEGRAL mass model. The chi^2 distribution between the real\nand simulated data as a function of the percentage polarisation and\npolarisation angle was calculated for all three energy ranges. The degree of\nlinear polarisation in the brightest pulse of duration 66s was found to be\n63+/-31% at an angle of 70+/-14 degrees in the 100-350keV energy range. The\ndegree of polarisation was also constrained in the brightest 12s of the GRB and\na polarisation fraction of 96+/-40% at an angle of 60+/-14 degrees was\ndetermined over the same energy range. However, despite extensive analysis and\nsimulations, a systematic effect that could mimic the weak polarisation signal\ncould not be definitively excluded. Our results over several energy ranges and\ntime intervals are consistent with a polarisation signal of about 60% at a low\nlevel of significance (2 sigma). We conclude that the procedure described here\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of using SPI as a polarimeter, and is a viable\nmethod of measuring polarisation levels in intense gamma--ray bursts. \n\n"}

In this paper we\nconsider the second and third moments of the redshifted 21cm intensity\ndistribution using a simple model that accounts for galaxy bias during the\nreionisation process. We demonstrate that skewness in redshifted 21cm maps\nshould be substantial throughout the reionisation epoch and on all angular\nscales, owing to the effects of galaxy bias which leads to early reionisation\nin over-dense regions of the IGM. The variance (or power-spectrum) of 21cm\nfluctuations will exhibit a minimum in redshift part way through the\nreionisation process, when the global ionisation fraction is around 50%. This\nminimum is generic, and is due to the transition from 21cm intensity being\ndominated by over-dense too under-dense regions as reionisation progresses. We\nshow that the details of the reionisation history, including the presence of\nradiative feedback are encoded in the evolution of the auto-correlation and\nskewness functions with redshift and mean IGM neutral fraction. We discuss the\ndetection of skewness by first generation instruments, and conclude that the\nMileura Widefield Array - Low Frequency Demonstrator will have sufficient\nsensitivity to detect skewness on a range of angular scales at redshifts near\nthe end of reionisation, while a subsequent instrument of 10 times the\ncollecting area could map out the evolution of skewness in detail. The\nobservation of a minimum in variance during the reionisation history, and the\ndetection of skewness would both provide important confirmation of the\ncosmological origin of redshifted 21cm intensity fluctuations. \n\n"}

A qualitative application of\n  MOND and Mannheim-Kazanas gravity Abstract: Binary galaxies are modeled as point-masses obeying the non-Newtonian MOND\nand Mannheim-Kazanas (MKG) theories of gravity. Random samples of such systems\nare generated by means of Monte Carlo simulations of binary orbits. Model pairs\nhave total masses and mass ratios similar to pairs in the cataloged sample used\nin the analysis. General features of synthetic samples are derived from a\ncomparison with observed data of galaxy pairs in $R \\times \\Delta\nV/(L_1+L_2)^{1/2} $ space.

{"id": "astro-ph/9609040", "contents": "Title: The Distribution of Dark Matter in a Ringed Galaxy Abstract: Outer rings are located at the greatest distance from the galaxy center of\nany feature resonant with a bar. Because of their large scale, their morphology\nis sensitive to the distribution of the dark matter in the galaxy. We introduce\nhere how study of these rings can constrain the mass-to-light ratio of the bar,\nand so the percentage of dark matter in the center of these galaxies. We\ncompare periodic orbits integrated in the ringed galaxy NGC 6782 near the outer\nLindblad resonance to the shape of the outer ring. The non-axisymmetric\ncomponent of the potential resulting from the bar is derived from a\nnear-infrared image of the galaxy. The axisymmetric component is derived\nassuming a flat rotation curve. We find that the pinched non-self-intersecting\nperiodic orbits are more elongated for higher bar mass-to-light ratios and\nfaster bars. The inferred mass-to-light ratio of the bar depends on the assumed\ninclination of the galaxy. With an assumed galaxy inclination of i=41 degrees,\nfor the orbits to be consistent with the observed ring morphology the\nmass-to-light ratio of the bar must be high, greater than 70% of a maximal disk\nvalue. For i=45 degrees, the mass-to-light ratio of the bar is $75\\pm 15%$ of\nthe maximal disk value. Since the velocity field of these rings can be used to\nconstrain the galaxy inclination as well as which periodic orbit is represented\nin the ring, further study will yield tighter constraints on the mass-to-light\nratio of the bar. If a near maximal disk value for the bar is required, then\neither there would be little dark matter within the bar, or the dark matter\ncontained in the disk of the galaxy would be non-axisymmetric and would rotate\nwith the bar. \n\n"}

{"id": "astro-ph/9612059", "contents": "Title: Mass models of the Milky Way Abstract: A parameterized model of the mass distribution within the Milky Way is fitted\nto the available observational constraints. The most important single parameter\nis the ratio of the scale length R_d* of the stellar disk to R0. The disk and\nbulge dominate v_c(R) at R<R0 only for R_d*/R0< 0.3. Since the only knowledge\nwe have of the halo derives from studies like the present one, we allow it to\ncontribute to the density at all radii. When allowed this freedom, however, the\nhalo causes changes in assumptions relating to R << R0 to affect profoundly the\nstructure of the best-fitting model at R >> R0. For example, changing the disk\nslightly from an exponential surface-density profile significantly changes the\nform of v_c(R) at R >> R0, where the disk makes a negligible contribution to\nv_c. Moreover, minor changes in the constraints can cause the halo to develop a\ndeep hole at its centre that is not physically plausible. These problems call\ninto question the proposition that flat rotation curves arise because galaxies\nhave physically distinct halos rather than outwards-increasing mass-to-light\nratios.\n  The mass distribution of the Galaxy and the relative importance of its\nvarious components will remain very uncertain until more observational data can\nbe used to constrain mass models.

Further optical observations were gathered\nthroughout most of 1994. The radio, millimeter, and near-infrared data show no\nstrong correlations with the higher energies. The optical light curves exhibit\nflickering of 0.2-0.3 mag on timescales of 1-2 days, superimposed on longer\ntimescale variations. Rapid variations of ~0.01 mag/min, which, if real, are\nthe fastest seen to date for any BL Lac object.

The density profile of the dark matter component can be fitted\nrather accurately by the simple formula originally proposed by Navarro, Frenk &\nWhite to describe the structure of clusters in a CDM universe with $\\Omega=1$.\nIn projection, the shape of the dark matter radial density profile and the\ncorresponding line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile are in very good\nagreement with the observed profiles for galaxies in the CNOC sample of\nclusters. The gas in our simulated clusters is less centrally concentrated than\nthe dark matter, and its radial density profile is well described by the\nfamiliar $\\beta$-model. The total mass and velocity dispersion of our clusters\ncan be accurately inferred (with $\\sim 15%$ uncertainty) from their X-ray\nemission-weighted temperature. We generalize Kaiser's scaling relations for\nscale-free universes and show that the clusters in our simulations generally\nfollow these relations.

The slope of the luminosity-temperature\nrelation implied by the scaling relations, and obeyed by the simulations, is in\ndisagreement with observations.

These effects naturally depend on the precise shape of the extinction\nlaw and on the redshift of the lens. By means of numerical Monte-Carlo\nsimulations, using a least-squares fitting method and assuming an extinction\nlaw similar to that observed in the Galaxy, we show how accurate photometric\nobservations of multiply imaged quasars obtained in several spectral bands\ncould lead to the estimate of the lens redshift, irrespective of the visibility\nof the deflector.

Based on the fact that the overall cycle times are very much longer\nthan the rise/fall time scales in GRS 1915, we rule out the geometry of ADAF or\na hot quasi-spherical region plus a cold outer disk for this source. We thus\nconcentrate on geometrically thin Shakura-Sunyaev type disks (Shakura & Sunyaev\n1973; hereafter SS73). We have devised a modified viscosity law that has a\nquasi-stable upper branch. Via numerical simulations, we show that the model\ndoes account for several gross observational features of GRS 1915+105. On the\nother hand, the rise/fall time scales are not short enough, and no rapid\noscillations on time scales $\\simlt$ 10 s emerge naturally from the model.\n  We then consider and numerically test a more elaborate model that includes\nthe cold disk, a corona, and plasma ejections from the inner disk region and\nshow that this model allows us to reproduce several additional observed\nfeatures of GRS 1915+105. We conclude that the most likely structure of the\naccretion flow in this source is that of a cold disk with a modified viscosity\nprescription, plus a corona that accounts for much of the X-ray emission, and\nunsteady plasma ejections that occur when the luminosity of the source is high. \n\n"}

The energy source is then the rotation of the black\nhole, and it is extracted electromagnetically via a Poynting flux, a mechanism\nfirst proposed by Blandford and Znajek (1997) for AGN. Accounting both for the\nmaximum rotation energy of the hole and for the efficiency of electromagnetic\nextraction, we find that a maximum of 9% of the rest mass of the hole can be\nconverted to a Poynting flow, i.e. the energy available to produce a gamma-ray\nburst is 1.6 X 10^{53}M/M_{sun}erg for a black hole of mass M. We show that the\nblack holes formed in a variety of gamma-rayburst scenarios probably contain\nthe required high angular momentum. To extract the energy from a black hole in\nthe required time \\lsim1000s a field of 10^{15}G near the black hole is needed.\nWe give an example of a disk-plus-field structure that both delivers the\nrequired field and makes the Poynting flux from the hole dominate that ofthe\ndisk. Thereby we demonstrate that the Poynting energy extracted need not be\ndominated by the disk, nor is limited to the binding energy of the disk. This\nmeans that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism remains a very good candidate for\npowering gamma-ray bursts. \n\n"}

Several alternative statistical procedures\nhave recently been suggested to relieve these problems. We apply a variant of\nthe object-weighted statistical method of Davis, Miller, & White (1997) to the\nLas Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS), which is the largest and deepest existing\nredshift survey that is nearly fully sampled. The derived one-dimensional\ndispersion on scales ~ 1 Mpc/h is quite low: sigma_1 = 126 +/- 10 km/s, with a\nmodest decrease at larger scales. The statistic is very stable; the six\nindependent slices of the LCRS all yield consistent results. We apply the same\nstatistical procedure to halos in numerical simulations of an open cosmological\nmodel and flat models with and without a cosmological constant.

Since cosmic rays have been\nobserved with energies above $10^{8}$ TeV, gravitational effects in the TeV\nenergy range can, in principle, be observed by ultrahigh energy cosmic ray\ndetectors. We consider the interaction of ultrahigh energy neutrinos in the\natmosphere and compare extensive air showers from TeV black hole formation and\nfragmentation with standard model processes. Departures from the standard model\npredictions arise in the interaction cross sections and in the multiplicity of\nsecondary particles. Large theoretical uncertainties in the black hole cross\nsection weaken attempts to constrain TeV gravity based solely on differences\nbetween predicted and observed event rates. The large multiplicity of\nsecondaries in black hole fragmentation enhances the detectability of TeV\ngravity effects. We simulate TeV black hole air showers using PYTHIA and AIRES,\nand find that black hole-induced air showers are quite distinct from standard\nmodel air showers. However, the limited amount of information registered by\nrealistic detectors together with large air shower fluctuations limit in\npractice the ability to distinguish TeV gravity events from standard model\nevents in a shower by shower case. We discuss possible strategies to optimize\nthe detectability of black hole events and propose a few unique signatures that\nmay allow future high statistics detectors to separate black hole from standard\nmodel events. \n\n"}

In the bosonic sector, the leading channel\nof particle production is the non-perturbative regime of parametric resonance,\npreheating, during which bosons are created exponentially fast. Pauli blocking\nprohibits the unbounded creation of fermions. For this reason, it has been\nsilently assumed that the creation of fermions can be treated with perturbation\ntheory for the decay of individual inflatons. We consider the production of\nfermions interacting with the coherently oscillating inflatons. We find that\nthe actual particle production occurs in a regime of the parametric excitation\nof fermions, leading to preheating of fermions. Fermion preheating differs\nsignificantly from the perturbative expectation. It turns out that the number\ndensity of fermions varies periodically with time. The total number of fermions\nquickly saturates to an average value within a broad range of momenta $\\propto\nq^{1/4}$, where $q$ is the usual resonance parameter. The resonant excitation\nof fermions may affect the transfer inflaton energy, estimations of the\nreheating temperature, and the abundance of superheavy fermions and gravitinos.\nBack in the bosonic sector, outside of the parametric resonance bands there is\nan additional effect of parametric excitation of bosons with bounded occupation\nnumber in the momentum range $\\propto q^{1/4}$. \n\n"}
