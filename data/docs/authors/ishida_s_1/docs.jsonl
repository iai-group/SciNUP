The spectrum\nof light axial-vector mesons is derived relying on the leading order\ninteraction of the Goldstone bosons with the vector mesons supplemented by a\nphenomenology for correction terms. The f_1(1282), b_1(1230), h_1(1386),\na_1(1230) and K_1(1272) mesons are recovered as molecular states.

Here we present a mechanism for suppressing\nthe NP effects to FCNC processes. We consider the possibility that the source\nof NP contributions to FCNC processes share the same flavor symmetry underlying\nthe SM source of FCNC processes which are the quark and lepton mass matrices.\nWe call this the principle of shared flavor symmetry. In the flavor symmetric\nlimit, the quark and lepton mixing matrices have fixed forms and there are no\nNP FCNC processes. In the flavor symmetric limit, we take the quark mixing\nmatrix to be the identity matrix and the lepton mixing matrix to be given by\ntri-bimaximal mixing.

However, N-body\nsimulations show that dark matter halos grow through a mixture of smooth\naccretion, violent encounters and fragmentations, and modeling halo collapse as\nspherical, or even as ellipsoidal, is a significant oversimplification. We\npropose that some of the physical complications inherent to a realistic\ndescription of halo formation can be included in the excursion set theory\nframework, at least at an effective level, by taking into account that the\ncritical value for collapse is not a fixed constant $\\delta_c$, as in the\nspherical collapse model, nor a fixed function of the variance $\\sigma$ of the\nsmoothed density field, as in the ellipsoidal collapse model, but rather is\nitself a stochastic variable, whose scatter reflects a number of complicated\naspects of the underlying dynamics.

This can be modeled by a\nsemiclassical expansion about a constant field for the vector potential, A_0,\nwhich is diagonal in color. We compute the shear viscosity in the semi-QGP by\nusing the Boltzmann equation in the presence of this background field. To\nleading, logarithmic order in weak coupling, the dominant diagrams are given by\nthe usual scattering processes of 2 -> 2 particles. For simplicity we also\nassume that both the number of colors and flavors are large. Near the critical\ntemperature T_c, where the expectation value of the Polyakov loop is small, the\noverall density of colored fields decreases according to their color\nrepresentation, with the density of quarks vanishes linearly with the loop, and\nthat of gluons, quadratically.

As we approach it from large doping, a standard\nFermi-liquid gradually turns into a bad non-Fermi liquid metal, a process which\nculminates in the pseudogap regime, in which the antinodal region in momentum\nspace acquires a gap before reaching a fully gapped Mott state.\n  Here we show that experiments for electron- and hole-doped BaFe2As2 support\nan analogous scenario.

Weakly and strongly\ncorrelated conduction electrons coexist in much of the phase diagram, a\ndifferentiation which increases with hole doping. We identify the reason for\nthis selective Mottness in a strong Hund's coupling, which decouples the\ndifferent orbitals. Each orbital then behaves as a single band Hubbard model,\nwhere the correlation degree only depends on how doped is each orbital from\nhalf-filling.

This form provides an excellent\nfit to the low $x$ HERA data, including the very low $Q^2$ regions, and can be\nextrapolated reliably to small $x$ using the natural variable $\\ln(1/x)$. We\nused our fit to derive quark distributions for values of $x$ down to\n$x=10^{-14}$.

Abstract: Recently there has been significant interest in the claim that dark matter\naxions gravitationally thermalize and form a Bose-Einstein condensate with\ncosmologically long-range correlation. This has potential consequences for\ngalactic scale observations. Here we critically examine this claim. We point\nout that there is an essential difference between the thermalization and\nformation of a condensate due to repulsive interactions, which can indeed drive\nlong-range order, and that due to attractive interactions, which can lead to\nlocalized Bose clumps (stars or solitons) that only exhibit short range\ncorrelation. While the difference between repulsion and attraction is not\npresent in the standard collisional Boltzmann equation, we argue that it is\nessential to the field theory dynamics, and we explain why the latter analysis\nis appropriate for a condensate. Since the axion is primarily governed by\nattractive interactions -- gravitation and scalar-scalar contact interactions\n-- we conclude that while a Bose-Einstein condensate is formed, the claim of\nlong-range correlation is unjustified. \n\n"}

One might even worry that in a de Sitter background, light species\nwill lead to a violation of the covariant entropy bound at large $N$. If so,\nrequiring the validity of the covariant entropy bound could limit the number of\nlight species and their couplings, which in turn could severely constrain\naxion-driven inflation. Here we show that there is no such problem when we\ncorrectly renormalize models with many light species, taking the {\\it physical}\nPlanck scale to be $M^2_{pl} \\gtrsim N {\\cal M}_{UV}^2$, where ${\\cal M}_{UV}$\nis the cutoff for the QFT coupled to semiclassical quantum gravity. The number\nof light species then cancels out of the gravitational entropy of de Sitter or\nnear-de Sitter backgrounds at leading order. Working in detail with $N$ scalar\nfields in de Sitter space, renormalized to one loop order, we show that the\ngravitational entropy automatically obeys the covariant entropy bound.\nFurthermore, while the axion decay constant is a strong coupling scale for the\naxion dynamics, we show that it is {\\it not} in general the cutoff of 4d\nsemiclassical gravity.

The\nfield theory that we consider is the effective theory of axion field arising\nfrom Type IIB string theory compactified to four dimensions. We compute the\nexpression for the power spectrum of vacuum fluctuation in three different\napproaches, namely (1) field operator expansion (FOE) technique with the\nquantum entangled state, (2) reduced density matrix (RDM) formalism with mixed\nquantum state and (3) the method of non-entangled state (NES). For massless\naxion field, in all these three formalism, we reproduce, at the leading order,\nthe exact scale-invariant power spectrum which is well known in the literature.\nWe observe that due to quantum entanglement, the sub-leading terms for these\nthee formalisms are different. Thus, such correction terms break the degeneracy\namong the analysis of the FOE, RDM and NES formalisms in the super-horizon\nlimit. On the other hand, for massive axion field, we get a slight deviation\nfrom scale invariance and exactly quantify the spectral tilt of the power\nspectrum in small scales. Apart from that, for massless and massive axion\nfield, we find distinguishable features of the power spectrum for the FOE, RDM,\nand NES on the large scales, which is the result of quantum entanglement. We\nalso find that such large-scale effects are comparable to or greater than the\ncurvature radius of the de Sitter space. Most importantly, in the near future,\nif experiments probe for early universe phenomena, one can detect such small\nquantum effects. In such a scenario, it is possible to test the implications of\nquantum entanglement in primordial cosmology. \n\n"}

Assuming that\nordinary matter scales canonically, we show that the continuity equation\nunivocally fixes the IR cutoff, provided a law of variation for either\nrho_Lambda or G_N is known. Previous considerations on holographic dark energy\ndisfavor the Hubble parameter as a candidate for the IR cutoff (for spatially\nflat universes), since in this case the ratio of dark energy to dark matter is\nnot allowed to vary, thus hindering a deceleration era of the universe for the\nredshifts z>=0.5. On the other hand, the future event horizon as a choice for\nthe IR cutoff is being favored in the literature, although the `coincidence\nproblem' usually cannot be addressed in that case. We extend considerations to\nspatially curved universes, and show that with the Hubble parameter as a choice\nfor the IR cutoff one always obtains a universe that never accelerates or a\nuniverse that accelerates all the time, thus making the transition from\ndeceleration to acceleration impossible. Next, we apply the IR cutoff\nconsistency procedure to a RG running CC model, in which the low-energy\nvariation of the CC is due to quantum effects of particle fields having masses\nnear the Planck scale. We show that bringing such a model in full accordance\nwith holography amounts to having such an IR cutoff which scales as a square\nroot of the Hubble parameter. We find that such a setup, in which the only\nundetermined input represents the true ground state of the vacuum, can give\nearly deceleration as well as late time acceleration. The possibility of\nfurther improvement of the model is also briefly indicated. \n\n"}

We consider the important problem of the calculation of nuclear matrix\nelements of neutrinoless double-beta decay and discuss the possibility to check\nthe results of different model calculations of the nuclear matrix elements\nthrough their comparison with the experimental data. We discuss the upper bound\nof the total mass of neutrinos that was obtained recently from the data of the\n2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey and other cosmological data and we discuss future\nprospects of the cosmological measurements of the total mass of neutrinos. We\ndiscuss also the possibility to obtain information on neutrino masses from the\nobservation of the ultra high-energy cosmic rays (beyond the GZK cutoff).\nFinally, we review the main aspects of the physics of core-collapse supernovae,\nthe limits on the absolute values of neutrino masses from the observation of\nSN1987A neutrinos and the future prospects of supernova neutrino detection. \n\n"}

In the particular\nframe of Ref.[30], a \"running CC\" at low energies may arise from generic\nquantum effects near the Planck scale, M_P, provided there is a smooth\ndecoupling of all massive particles below M_P.

In the case\nwhere the PMNS matrix is identical to the CKM matrix at the seesaw scale, with\na Dirac phase but no Majorana phase, the low energy Dirac phase is predicted to\nbe ($\\simeq 0.3^{\\circ}$) and leptonic CP-violation parameter $J_{CP} \\simeq (4\n- 8)\\times 10^{-5}$ and $\\theta_{13} = 3.5^{\\circ}$.

Our analysis is performed at leading-one-loop order\nin BChPT, predicting both the momentum and the quark-mass dependence for the\nthree (generalized) isovector and (generalized) isoscalar form factors, which\nare currently under investigation in lattice QCD analyses of baryon structure.\nWe also study the limit of vanishing four-momentum transfer where the\nGPD-moments reduce to the well known moments of Parton Distribution Functions\n(PDFs). For the isovector moment <x>_{u-d} our BChPT calculation predicts a new\nmechanism for chiral curvature, connecting the high values for this moment\ntypically found in lattice QCD studies for large quark masses with the smaller\nvalue known from phenomenology. Likewise, we analyze the quark-mass dependence\nof the isoscalar moments in the forward limit and extract the contribution of\nquarks to the total spin of the nucleon. We close with a first glance at the\nmomentum dependence of the isoscalar C-form factor of the nucleon. \n\n"}

Abstract: The renormalisation of NN scattering in theories with zero-range interactions\nis examined using a cut-off regularisation where the cut-off is taken to\ninfinity, dimensional regularisation (DR) with minimal subtraction, and DR with\npower-divergence subtraction. In the infinite cut-off limit power counting\nbreaks down: terms of different orders in the potential contribute to the\nscattering amplitude at the same order. Minimal subtraction does yield a\nsystematic expansion, but with a very limited range of validity for systems\nthat have unnaturally large scattering lengths. For a finite cut-off, the\nbehaviour of the couplings as the cut-off is lowered shows that a theory with a\nnatural scattering length approaches an IR fixed point. In the corresponding\neffective theory, loop corrections can be treated perturbatively. In contrast,\nif there is an IR fixed point for systems with an infinite scattering length it\nmust be a nonperturbative one, with no power counting. For such systems,\npower-divergence subtraction appears to yield a systematic expansion, but with\na different power counting from Weinberg's. However the scheme omits IR\ndivergent terms that would otherwise lead to nonperturbative behaviour and so\nthe interpretation of the fixed point remains unclear. \n\n"}
