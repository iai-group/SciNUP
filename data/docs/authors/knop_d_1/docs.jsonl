Each pool is then tested and defective items are\nidentified. A fundamental question involves minimizing the number of pools\nrequired to identify at most $d$ defective items. Motivated by applications in\nnetwork tomography, sensor networks and infection propagation, a variation of\ngroup testing problems on graphs is formulated. Unlike conventional group\ntesting problems, each group here must conform to the constraints imposed by a\ngraph. For instance, items can be associated with vertices and each pool is any\nset of nodes that must be path connected. In this paper, a test is associated\nwith a random walk. In this context, conventional group testing corresponds to\nthe special case of a complete graph on $n$ vertices.\n  For interesting classes of graphs a rather surprising result is obtained,\nnamely, that the number of tests required to identify $d$ defective items is\nsubstantially similar to what is required in conventional group testing\nproblems, where no such constraints on pooling is imposed. Specifically, if\nT(n) corresponds to the mixing time of the graph $G$, it is shown that with\n$m=O(d^2T^2(n)\\log(n/d))$ non-adaptive tests, one can identify the defective\nitems. Consequently, for the Erdos-Renyi random graph $G(n,p)$, as well as\nexpander graphs with constant spectral gap, it follows that $m=O(d^2\\log^3n)$\nnon-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify $d$ defective items.

To design a memetic algorithm one needs to make a host\nof decisions; selecting a population size is one of the most important among\nthem. Most algorithms in the literature fix the population size to a certain\nconstant value. This reduces the algorithm's quality since the optimal\npopulation size varies for different instances, local search procedures and\nrunning times. In this paper we propose an adjustable population size. It is\ncalculated as a function of the running time of the whole algorithm and the\naverage running time of the local search for the given instance. Note that in\nmany applications the running time of a heuristic should be limited and\ntherefore we use this limit as a parameter of the algorithm. The average\nrunning time of the local search procedure is obtained during the algorithm's\nrun. Some coefficients which are independent with respect to the instance or\nthe local search are to be tuned before the algorithm run; we provide a\nprocedure to find these coefficients. The proposed approach was used to develop\na memetic algorithm for the Multidimensional Assignment Problem (MAP or s-AP in\nthe case of s dimensions) which is an extension of the well-known assignment\nproblem.

Depending on the type of constraints that we allow in\nthe input, a CSP might be tractable, or computationally hard. In recent years,\ngeneral criteria have been discovered that imply that a CSP is polynomial-time\ntractable, or that it is NP-hard. Finite-domain CSPs have become a major common\nresearch focus of graph theory, artificial intelligence, and finite model\ntheory. It turned out that the key questions for complexity classification of\nCSPs are closely linked to central questions in universal algebra.\n  This thesis studies CSPs where the variables can take values from an infinite\ndomain. This generalization enhances dramatically the range of computational\nproblems that can be modeled as a CSP.

In this article,\nI will address fundamental aspects of this algorithmic-statistical disconnect,\nwith an eye to bridging the gap between these two very different approaches.

Exploring high girth even\n  degree expanders in linear time Abstract: We consider a modified random walk which uses unvisited edges whenever\npossible, and makes a simple random walk otherwise. We call such a walk an\nedge-process. We assume there is a rule A, which tells the walk which unvisited\nedge to use whenever there is a choice. In the simplest case, A is a uniform\nrandom choice over unvisited edges incident with the current walk position.\nHowever we do not exclude arbitrary choices of rule A. For example, the rule\ncould be determined on-line by an adversary, or could vary from vertex to\nvertex.\n  For even degree expander graphs, of bounded maximum degree, we have the\nfollowing result. Let G be an n vertex even degree expander graph, for which\nevery vertex is in at least one vertex induced cycle of length L. Any\nedge-process on G has cover time (n+ (n log n)/L). This result is independent\nof the rule A used to select the order of the unvisited edges, which can be\nchosen on-line by an adversary.\n  As an example, With high probability, random r-regular graphs, (r at least 4,\neven), are expanders for which L = Omega(log n). Thus, for almost all such\ngraphs, the vertex cover time of the edge-process is Theta(n). This improves\nthe vertex cover time of such graphs by a factor of log n, compared to the\nOmega(n log n) cover time of any weighted random walk. \n\n"}

The SHO-FA\nalgorithm is related to the Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables recently introduced\nby Goodrich et al., with two important distinctions - SHO-FA relies on linear\nmeasurements, and is robust to noise. The SHO-FA algorithm is the first to\nsimultaneously have the following properties: (a) it requires only O(k)\nmeasurements, (b) the bit-precision of each measurement and each arithmetic\noperation is O (log(n) + P) (here 2^{-P} is the desired relative error in the\nreconstruction of x), (c) the decoding complexity is O(k) arithmetic operations\nand encoding complexity is O(n) arithmetic operations, and (d) if the\nreconstruction goal is simply to recover a single component of x instead of all\nof x, with significant probability over A this can be done in constant time.\nAll constants above are independent of all problem parameters other than the\ndesired success probability.

However,\nwhile optimal schemes are now known for several basic problems, such optimality\nholds only for streams whose length is commensurate with the size of the data\nuniverse.

The literature lacks a general model\nencompassing these sorts of problems. We introduce such a model, called\n\"bandits with knapsacks\", that combines aspects of stochastic integer\nprogramming with online learning. A distinctive feature of our problem, in\ncomparison to the existing regret-minimization literature, is that the optimal\npolicy for a given latent distribution may significantly outperform the policy\nthat plays the optimal fixed arm. Consequently, achieving sublinear regret in\nthe bandits-with-knapsacks problem is significantly more challenging than in\nconventional bandit problems.\n  We present two algorithms whose reward is close to the information-theoretic\noptimum: one is based on a novel \"balanced exploration\" paradigm, while the\nother is a primal-dual algorithm that uses multiplicative updates.

The protocol is in the same style of the $1\\over e$-solution for the\nclassical secretary problem, but with multiple phases and adaptive criteria.\nOur protocol is very simple and efficient, and we show that several\ngeneralizations, such as the fractional $J$-choice $K$-best secretary problem\nand exclusive $Q$-queue $J$-choice $K$-best secretary problem, can be solved\noptimally by this protocol with slight modification and the latter one solves\nan open problem of Feldman and Tennenholtz [14].\n  In addition, we provide theoretical analysis for two typical cases, including\nthe 1-queue 1-choice $K$-best problem and the shared 2-queue 2-choice 2-best\nproblem. For the former, we prove a lower bound $1-O(\\frac{\\ln^2K}{K^2})$ of\nthe competitive ratio. For the latter, we show the optimal competitive ratio is\n$\\approx0.372$ while previously the best known result is 0.356 [14]. \n\n"}

A powerful and\nwidespread class of network analysis methods is based on algebraic graph\ntheory, i.e., representing graphs as square adjacency matrices. However, many\nnetworks are of a very specific form that clashes with that representation:\nThey are bipartite. That is, they consist of two node types, with each edge\nconnecting a node of one type with a node of the other type. Examples of\nbipartite networks (also called \\emph{two-mode networks}) are persons and the\nsocial groups they belong to, musical artists and the musical genres they play,\nand text documents and the words they contain. In fact, any type of feature\nthat can be represented by a categorical variable can be interpreted as a\nbipartite network.

The work is\nmotivated by the recent work on one scan 1-bit compressed sensing (sparse\nsignal recovery) using $\\alpha$-stable random projections, which requires\nestimating of the scale parameter at bits-level. Our technique can be naturally\napplied to data stream computations for estimating the $\\alpha$-th frequency\nmoment. In fact, the method applies to the general scale family of\ndistributions, not limited to $\\alpha$-stable distributions.\n  Due to the heavy-tailed nature of $\\alpha$-stable distributions, using\ntraditional estimators will potentially need many bits to store each\nmeasurement in order to ensure sufficient accuracy. Interestingly, our paper\ndemonstrates that, using a simple closed-form estimator with merely 1-bit\ninformation does not result in a significant loss of accuracy if the parameter\nis chosen appropriately. For example, when $\\alpha=0+$, 1, and 2, the\ncoefficients of the optimal estimation variances using full (i.e.,\ninfinite-bit) information are 1, 2, and 2, respectively.

Using 2 or more bits per measurements reduces the estimation variance\nand importantly, stabilizes the estimate so that the variance is not sensitive\nto parameters.

We seek an\nalgorithm that, given $\\mathbf{x}$ as input, accurately answers a sequence of\nadaptively chosen queries about the unknown distribution $\\mathbf{P}$. How many\nsamples $n$ must we draw from the distribution, as a function of the type of\nqueries, the number of queries, and the desired level of accuracy?\n  In this work we make two new contributions:\n  (i) We give upper bounds on the number of samples $n$ that are needed to\nanswer statistical queries.

It\nis known that a stable matching need not exist, so we consider MIN BP HRC, the\nproblem of finding a matching that admits the minimum number of blocking pairs\n(i.e., is \"as stable as possible\"). We show that this problem is NP-hard and\ndifficult to approximate even in the highly restricted case that each couple\nfinds only one hospital pair acceptable.

Consider an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$\nvertices, and define (for $s > 0$) $\\mu_s = \\frac{1}{n}\\cdot\\sum_{v \\in V}\nd^s_v$. Our aim is to estimate $\\mu_s$ within a multiplicative error of\n$(1+\\epsilon)$ (for a given approximation parameter $\\epsilon>0$) in sublinear\ntime. We consider the sparse graph model that allows access to: uniform random\nvertices, queries for the degree of any vertex, and queries for a neighbor of\nany vertex. For the case of $s=1$ (the average degree),\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ queries suffice for any constant $\\epsilon$ (Feige,\nSICOMP 06 and Goldreich-Ron, RSA 08). Gonen-Ron-Shavitt (SIDMA 11) extended\nthis result to all integral $s > 0$, by designing an algorithms that performs\n$\\widetilde{O}(n^{1-1/(s+1)})$ queries.\n  We design a new, significantly simpler algorithm for this problem. In the\nworst-case, it exactly matches the bounds of Gonen-Ron-Shavitt, and has a much\nsimpler proof. More importantly, the running time of this algorithm is\nconnected to the degeneracy of $G$. This is (essentially) the maximum density\nof an induced subgraph. For the family of graphs with degeneracy at most\n$\\alpha$, it has a query complexity of\n$\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{n^{1-1/s}}{\\mu^{1/s}_s} \\Big(\\alpha^{1/s} +\n\\min\\{\\alpha,\\mu^{1/s}_s\\}\\Big)\\right) =\n\\widetilde{O}(n^{1-1/s}\\alpha/\\mu^{1/s}_s)$. Thus, for the class of bounded\ndegeneracy graphs (which includes all minor closed families and preferential\nattachment graphs), we can estimate the average degree in $\\widetilde{O}(1)$\nqueries, and can estimate the variance of the degree distribution in\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ queries. This is a major improvement over the\nprevious worst-case bounds. Our key insight is in designing an estimator for\n$\\mu_s$ that has low variance when $G$ does not have large dense subgraphs. \n\n"}

In spite of decades of intensive research, the problem remains open.\nPerhaps a more basic question, which has also attracted much attention, is if\nthere exists any dynamically optimal BST algorithm. One such candidate is\nGREEDY which is a simple and intuitive BST algorithm [Lucas, Rutgers Tech.\nReport, 1988; Munro, ESA, 2000; Demaine, Harmon, Iacono, Kane and Patrascu,\nSODA, 2009]. [Demaine et al., SODA, 2009] showed a novel connection between a\ngeometric problem.\n  Since dynamic optimality conjecture in its most general form remains elusive\ndespite much effort, researchers have studied this problem on special\nsequences. Recently, [Chalermsook, Goswami, Kozma, Mehlhorn and Saranurak,\nFOCS, 2015] studied a type of sequences known as $k$-{\\em decomposable\nsequences} in this context, where $k$ parametrizes easiness of the sequence.\nUsing tools from forbidden submatrix theory, they showed that GREEDY takes\n$n2^{O(k^2)}$ time on this sequence and explicitly raised the question of\nimproving this bound.\n  In this paper, we show that GREEDY takes $O(n \\log{k})$ time on\n$k$-decomposable sequences. In contrast to the previous approach, ours is based\non first principles. One of the main ingredients of our result is a new\nconstruction of a lower bound certificate on the performance of any algorithm.\nThis certificate is constructed using the execution of GREEDY, and is more\nnuanced and possibly more flexible than the previous independent set\ncertificate of Demaine et al. This result, which is applicable to all\nsequences, may be of independent interest and may lead to further progress in\nanalyzing GREEDY on $k$-decomposable as well as general sequences. \n\n"}

The efficiency of the new algorithm\nrelies on two new theoretical contributions, of independent interest. The first\ncontribution focuses on sampling shortest paths, a subroutine used by most\nalgorithms that approximate betweenness centrality.

For this\nproblem, a 2-approximation is known based on a novel convex programming (J. ACM\n2001 by Skutella). It has been a long standing open problem if one can improve\nupon this 2-approximation (Open Problem 8 in J. of Sched. 1999 by Schuurman and\nWoeginger). We answer this question in the affirmative by giving a\n1.8786-approximation. We achieve this via a surprisingly simple linear\nprogramming, but a novel rounding algorithm and analysis.

Those who listen can only distinguish between silence and the presence\nof at least one beep. We refer to this model as $BL$ (beep or listen). Stronger\nmodels exist where the nodes can detect collision while they are beeping\n($B_{cd}L$), listening ($BL_{cd}$), or both ($B_{cd}L_{cd}$). Beeping models\nare weak in essence and even simple tasks are difficult or unfeasible within.\n  We present a set of generic building blocks (design patterns) which seem to\noccur frequently in the design of beeping algorithms. They include multi-slot\nphases: the fact of dividing the main loop into a number of specialised slots;\nexclusive beeps: having a single node beep at a time in a neighbourhood (within\none or two hops); adaptive probability: increasing or decreasing the\nprobability of beeping to produce more exclusive beeps; internal (resp.\nperipheral) collision detection: for detecting collision while beeping (resp.\nlistening).

There is an inherent tradeoff between the\nsparsity parameter $\\delta$ and the stretch function $f$ of the compression\nscheme, but the qualitative nature of this tradeoff has remained a persistent\nopen problem.\n  In this paper we show that the recent additive spanner lower bound of Abboud\nand Bodwin is just the first step in a hierarchy of lower bounds that fully\ncharacterize the asymptotic behavior of the optimal stretch function $f$ as a\nfunction of $\\delta \\in (0,1/3)$. Specifically, for any integer $k\\ge 2$, any\ncompression scheme with size $O(n^{1+\\frac{1}{2^k-1} - \\epsilon})$ has a\nsublinear additive stretch function $f$: $$f(d) = d +\n\\Omega(d^{1-\\frac{1}{k}}).$$ This lower bound matches Thorup and Zwick's (2006)\nconstruction of sublinear additive emulators.

In this paper we address this issue and obtain LP relaxations\nof quasi-polynomial size that are at least as strong as that given by the\nknapsack cover inequalities.\n  For the min-knapsack cover problem, our main result can be stated formally as\nfollows: for any $\\varepsilon >0$, there is a $(1/\\varepsilon)^{O(1)}n^{O(\\log\nn)}$-size LP relaxation with an integrality gap of at most $2+\\varepsilon$,\nwhere $n$ is the number of items. Prior to this work, there was no known\nrelaxation of subexponential size with a constant upper bound on the\nintegrality gap.\n  Our construction is inspired by a connection between extended formulations\nand monotone circuit complexity via Karchmer-Wigderson games. In particular,\nour LP is based on $O(\\log^2 n)$-depth monotone circuits with fan-in~$2$ for\nevaluating weighted threshold functions with $n$ inputs, as constructed by\nBeimel and Weinreb.

It has been an open question as\nto whether the seemingly simpler noncooperative, or temperature 1, model is\ncapable of such behaviour. Here we show that this is not the case, by showing\nthat there is no tile set in the noncooperative model that is intrinsically\nuniversal, nor one capable of time-bounded Turing machine simulation within a\nbounded region of the plane.\n  Although the noncooperative model intuitively seems to lack the complexity\nand power of the cooperative model it was not obvious how to prove this. One\nreason is that there have been few tools to analyse the structure of\ncomplicated paths in the plane. This paper provides a number of such tools. A\nsecond reason is that almost every obvious and small generalisation to the\nmodel (e.g. allowing error, 3D, non-square tiles, signals/wires on tiles, tiles\nthat repel each other, parallel synchronous growth) endows it with great\ncomputational, and sometimes simulation, power. Our main results show that all\nof these generalisations provably increase computational and/or simulation\npower. Our results hold for both deterministic and nondeterministic\nnoncooperative systems. Our first main result stands in stark contrast with the\nfact that for both the cooperative tile assembly model, and for 3D\nnoncooperative tile assembly, there are respective intrinsically universal\ntilesets.

(The case $q=1$ is known also as a mimicking\nnetwork). We provide new insights about the structure of minimum terminal cuts,\nleading to new results for cut sparsifiers of planar graphs. Our first\ncontribution identifies a subset of the minimum terminal cuts, which we call\nelementary, that generates all the others. Consequently, $H$ is a cut\nsparsifier if and only if it preserves all the elementary terminal cuts (up to\nthis factor $q$). This structural characterization lead to improved bounds on\nthe size of $H$. For example, it improve the bound of mimicking-network size\nfor planar graphs into a near-optimal one. Our second and main contribution is\nto refine the known bounds in terms of $\\gamma=\\gamma(G)$, which is defined as\nthe minimum number of faces that are incident to all the terminals in a planar\ngraph $G$.

In this paper, our interest is in computing maximum flows under this\nrobustness assumption. An important new feature of our model, distinguishing it\nfrom existing max robust flow models, is that no flow can get lost in the\nnetwork.\n  We also study a tightening of reroutable flows, called strictly reroutable\nflows, making more restrictive assumptions on the capacities available for\nrerouting. For both variants, we devise a reroutable-flow equivalent of an\ns-t-cut and show that the corresponding max flow/min cut gap is bounded by 2.\nIt turns out that a strictly reroutable flow of maximum value can be found\nusing a compact LP formulation, whereas the problem of finding a maximum\nreroutable flow is NP-hard, even when all capacities are in {1, 2}. However,\nthe tightening can be used to get a 2-approximation for reroutable flows. This\nratio is tight in general networks, but we show that in the case of unit\ncapacities, every reroutable flow can be transformed into a strictly reroutable\nflow of same value. While it is NP-hard to compute a maximal integral flow even\nfor unit capacities, we devise a surprisingly simple combinatorial algorithm\nthat finds a half-integral strictly reroutable flow of value 1, or certifies\nthat no such solutions exits.

When the number of events is large, however, NR\ncalculation is time consuming and how these pairs are organized are not yet\nexplored. In this paper, we designed a new approach to calculate clusters of NR\nevents efficiently. To begin with, R-tree is utilized to index crime events, a\nsingle event is represented by a vertex whereas edges are constructed by range\nquerying the vertex in R-tree, and a graph is formed. Cohesive subgraph\napproaches are applied to identify the event chains. k-clique, k-truss, k-core\nplus DBSCAN algorithms are implemented in sequence with respect to their varied\nrange of ability to find cohesive subgraphs. Real world crime data in Chicago,\nNew York and Washington DC are utilized to conduct experiments. The experiment\nconfirmed that near repeat is a solid effect in real big crime data by\nconducting Mapreduce empowered knox tests. The performance of 4 different\nalgorithms are validated, while the quality of the algorithms are gauged by the\ndistribution of number of cohesive subgraphs and their clustering coefficients.\nThe proposed framework is the first to process the real crime data of million\nrecord scale, and is the first to detect NR events with size of more than 2. \n\n"}

The model\nemploys an utility function as in the the MNL, and a dominance relation between\nproducts. When consumers are offered an assortmentS , they first discard all\ndominated products in S and then select one of the remaining products using the\nstandard MNL.

Abstract: Submodular functions are a broad class of set functions, which naturally\narise in diverse areas. Many algorithms have been suggested for the\nmaximization of these functions. Unfortunately, once the function deviates from\nsubmodularity, the known algorithms may perform arbitrarily poorly. Amending\nthis issue, by obtaining approximation results for set functions generalizing\nsubmodular functions, has been the focus of recent works.\n  One such class, known as weakly submodular functions, has received a lot of\nattention. A key result proved by Das and Kempe (2011) showed that the\napproximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for weakly submodular maximization\nsubject to a cardinality constraint degrades smoothly with the distance from\nsubmodularity. However, no results have been obtained for maximization subject\nto constraints beyond cardinality. In particular, it is not known whether the\ngreedy algorithm achieves any non-trivial approximation ratio for such\nconstraints.\n  In this paper, we prove that a randomized version of the greedy algorithm\n(previously used by Buchbinder et al. (2014) for a different problem) achieves\nan approximation ratio of $(1 + 1/\\gamma)^{-2}$ for the maximization of a\nweakly submodular function subject to a general matroid constraint, where\n$\\gamma$ is a parameter measuring the distance of the function from\nsubmodularity. Moreover, we also experimentally compare the performance of this\nversion of the greedy algorithm on real world problems against natural\nbenchmarks, and show that the algorithm we study performs well also in\npractice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm with a\nnon-trivial approximation guarantee for maximizing a weakly submodular function\nsubject to a constraint other than the simple cardinality constraint. In\nparticular, it is the first algorithm with such a guarantee for the important\nand broad class of matroid constraints. \n\n"}

Study of this problem was motivated as a non-linear\nversion of Dvoretzky theorem. Mendel and Naor 2007 devised the so called Ramsey\nPartitions to address this problem, and showed the algorithmic applications of\ntheir techniques to approximate distance oracles and ranking problems.\n  In this paper we study the natural extension of the metric Ramsey problem to\ngraphs, and introduce the notion of Ramsey Spanning Trees. We ask for the\nlargest subset $S\\subseteq V$ of a given graph $G=(V,E)$, such that there\nexists a spanning tree of $G$ that has small stretch for $S$. Applied\niteratively, this provides a small collection of spanning trees, such that each\nvertex has a tree providing low stretch paths to all other vertices. The union\nof these trees serves as a special type of spanner, a tree-padding spanner. We\nuse this spanner to devise the first compact stateless routing scheme with\n$O(1)$ routing decision time, and labels which are much shorter than in all\ncurrently existing schemes.\n  We first revisit the metric Ramsey problem, and provide a new deterministic\nconstruction.

The length of such route\nequals, in an edge-weighted tree, twice the total weight of all edges of the\ntree and this is asymptotically optimal over all exploration strategies. This\npaper considers a variant of such search strategies where the length of each\nroute is bounded by a positive integer $B$ (e.g. due to limited energy\nresources of the searcher). The objective is to cover all the edges of a tree\n$T$ using the minimum number of routes, each starting and ending at the root\nand each being of length at most $B$. To this end, we analyze the following\nnatural greedy tree traversal process that is based on decomposing a depth\nfirst search traversal into a sequence of limited length routes. Given any\narbitrary depth first search traversal $R$ of the tree $T$, we cover $R$ with\nroutes $R_1,\\ldots,R_l$, each of length at most $B$ such that: $R_i$ starts at\nthe root, reaches directly the farthest point of $R$ visited by $R_{i-1}$, then\n$R_i$ continues along the path $R$ as far as possible, and finally $R_i$\nreturns to the root. We call the above algorithm \\emph{piecemeal-DFS} and we\nprove that it achieves the asymptotically minimal number of routes $l$,\nregardless of the choice of $R$. Our analysis also shows that the total length\nof the traversal (and thus the traversal time) of piecemeal-DFS is\nasymptotically minimum over all energy-constrained exploration strategies.

In our model,\nagents arrive at nodes in an underlying metric space, where the metric distance\nbetween any buyer and seller captures the quality of the corresponding match.\nThe platform posts prices and wages at the nodes, and opens a set of facilities\nto route the agents to. The agents at any facility are assumed to be matched.\nThe platform ensures high match quality by imposing a distance constraint\nbetween a node and the facilities it is routed to. It ensures high service\navailability by ensuring flow to the facility is at least a pre-specified lower\nbound. Subject to these constraints, the goal of the platform is to maximize\nthe social surplus (or gains from trade) subject to weak budget balance, i.e.,\nprofit being non-negative.\n  We present an approximation algorithm for this problem that yields a $(1 +\n\\epsilon)$ approximation to surplus for any constant $\\epsilon > 0$, while\nrelaxing the match quality (i.e., maximum distance of any match) by a constant\nfactor.

The main contribution of this\npaper is a new characterization of the hyperbolicity of graphs. This\ncharacterization has algorithmic implications in the field of large-scale\nnetwork analysis.

A widely-followed strategy in 2048 maintains tiles that\nrepresent the move number in binary notation, and a similar strategy in the\nFibonacci number variant of the game (987) maintains the Zeckendorf\nrepresentation of the move number as a sum of the fewest possible Fibonacci\nnumbers; our analysis shows that the ability to follow these strategies is\nintimately connected with the fact that greedy change-making is optimal for\nbinary and Fibonacci coinage. For variants of 2048 using tile values for which\ngreedy change-making is suboptimal, it is the greedy strategy, not the optimal\nrepresentation as sums of tile values, that controls the length of the game. In\nparticular, the game will always terminate whenever the sequence of allowable\ntile values has arbitrarily large gaps between consecutive values. \n\n"}

It is conjectured that sampling is possible when the temperature of the\nmodel is in the uniqueness regime of the regular tree, but positive algorithmic\nresults have been for the most part elusive. In this paper, for all integers\n$q\\geq 3$ and $\\Delta\\geq 3$, we develop algorithms that produce samples within\nerror $o(1)$ from the $q$-state Potts model on random $\\Delta$-regular graphs,\nwhenever the temperature is in uniqueness, for both the ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic cases.\n  The algorithm for the antiferromagnetic Potts model is based on iteratively\nadding the edges of the graph and resampling a bichromatic class that contains\nthe endpoints of the newly added edge. Key to the algorithm is how to perform\nthe resampling step efficiently since bichromatic classes may induce\nlinear-sized components. To this end, we exploit the tree uniqueness to show\nthat the average growth of bichromatic components is typically small, which\nallows us to use correlation decay algorithms for the resampling step. While\nthe precise uniqueness threshold on the tree is not known for general values of\n$q$ and $\\Delta$ in the antiferromagnetic case, our algorithm works throughout\nuniqueness regardless of its value.\n  In the case of the ferromagnetic Potts model, we simplify the algorithm\nsignificantly by utilising the random-cluster representation of the model. In\nparticular, we show that a percolation-type algorithm succeeds in sampling from\nthe random-cluster model with parameters $p,q$ on random $\\Delta$-regular\ngraphs for all values of $q\\geq 1$ and $p<p_c(q,\\Delta)$, where $p_c(q,\\Delta)$\ncorresponds to a uniqueness threshold for the model on the $\\Delta$-regular\ntree. When restricted to integer values of $q$, this yields a simplified\nalgorithm for the ferromagnetic Potts model on random $\\Delta$-regular graphs. \n\n"}

The main feature of a finite dynamical system is its interaction\ngraph, which indicates which local functions depend on which variables; the\ninteraction graph is a qualitative representation of the interactions amongst\nentities on the network. As such, a major problem is to determine the effect of\nthe interaction graph on the dynamics of the FDS. In this paper, we are\ninterested in three main properties of an FDS: the number of images (the\nso-called rank), the number of periodic points (the so-called periodic rank)\nand the number of fixed points. In particular, we investigate the minimum,\naverage, and maximum number of images (or periodic points, or fixed points) of\nFDSs with a prescribed interaction graph and a given alphabet size; thus\nyielding nine quantities to study. The paper is split into two parts. The first\npart considers the minimum rank, for which we derive the first meaningful\nresults known so far. In particular, we show that the minimum rank decreases\nwith the alphabet size, thus yielding the definition of an absolute minimum\nrank. We obtain lower and upper bounds on this absolute minimum rank, and we\ngive classification results for graphs with very low (or highest) rank. The\nsecond part is a comprehensive survey of the results obtained on the nine\nquantities described above.

The Sylvester coloring conjecture\n($S_{10}$-conjecture) states that for any cubic graph $G$, $S_{10}\\prec G$. In\nthis paper, we introduce two new conjectures that are related to these\nconjectures. The first of them states that any cubic graph with a perfect\nmatching admits an $S_{12}$-coloring. The second one states that any cubic\ngraph $G$ whose edge-set can be covered with four perfect matchings, admits a\n$P_{12}$-coloring. We call these new conjectures $S_{12}$-conjecture and\n$P_{12}$-conjecture, respectively. Our first results justify the choice of\ngraphs in $S_{12}$-conjecture and $P_{12}$-conjecture. Next, we characterize\nthe edges of $P_{12}$ that may be fictive in a $P_{12}$-coloring of a cubic\ngraph $G$.

Even in a simple setting, e.g., when the costs come from\nthe metric on the line, adding two nodes to the input might change the optimal\nsolution completely. On the other hand, one expects that small changes in the\ninput should incur only small changes on the constructed solutions, measured as\nthe number of modified edges. We introduce a two-stage model where we study the\ntrade-off between quality and robustness of solutions. In the first stage we\nare given a set of nodes in a metric space and we must compute a perfect\nmatching. In the second stage $2k$ new nodes appear and we must adapt the\nsolution to a perfect matching for the new instance.\n  We say that an algorithm is $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-robust if the solutions\nconstructed in both stages are $\\alpha$-approximate with respect to min-cost\nperfect matchings, and if the number of edges deleted from the first stage\nmatching is at most $\\beta k$. Hence, $\\alpha$ measures the quality of the\nalgorithm and $\\beta$ its robustness. In this setting we aim to balance both\nmeasures by deriving algorithms for constant $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.

We show that this problem is NP-hard, and\nwe give an algorithm that computes an optimal tangle for $n$ wires and a given\nlist $L$ of swaps in $O((2|L|/n^2+1)^{n^2/2} \\cdot \\varphi^n \\cdot n)$ time,\nwhere $\\varphi \\approx 1.618$ is the golden ratio. We can treat lists where\nevery swap occurs at most once in $O(n!\\varphi^n)$ time. We implemented the\nalgorithm for the general case and compared it to an existing algorithm.\nFinally, we discuss feasibility for lists with a simple structure. \n\n"}

These problems are\ncharacterized by $O(n^3)$ constraints that enforce triangle inequalities on\ndistance variables associated with $n$ objects in a large dataset. Despite its\nusefulness, metric-constrained optimization is challenging in practice due to\nthe cubic number of constraints and the high-memory requirements of standard\noptimization software. Recent work has shown that iterative projection methods\nare able to solve metric-constrained optimization problems on a much larger\nscale than was previously possible, thanks to their comparatively low memory\nrequirement. However, the major limitation of projection methods is their slow\nconvergence rate. In this paper we present a parallel projection method for\nmetric-constrained optimization which allows us to speed up the convergence\nrate in practice. The key to our approach is a new parallel execution schedule\nthat allows us to perform projections at multiple metric constraints\nsimultaneously without any conflicts or locking of variables. We illustrate the\neffectiveness of this execution schedule by implementing and testing a parallel\nprojection method for solving the metric-constrained linear programming\nrelaxation of correlation clustering. We show numerous experimental results on\nproblems involving up to 2.9 trillion constraints. \n\n"}

This has been an outstanding open question in TCS for over three decades,\never since the discovery of randomized NC matching algorithms [KUW85, MVV87].\nOver the last five years, the theoretical computer science community has\nlaunched a relentless attack on this question, leading to the discovery of\nseveral powerful ideas. We give what appears to be the culmination of this line\nof work: An NC algorithm for finding a minimum-weight perfect matching in a\ngeneral graph with polynomially bounded edge weights, provided it is given an\noracle for the decision problem. Consequently, for settling the main open\nproblem, it suffices to obtain an NC algorithm for the decision problem. We\nbelieve this new fact has qualitatively changed the nature of this open\nproblem.\n  All known efficient matching algorithms for general graphs follow one of two\napproaches: given by Edmonds [Edm65] and Lov\\'asz [Lov79]. Our oracle-based\nalgorithm follows a new approach and uses many of the ideas discovered in the\nlast five years.\n  The difficulty of obtaining an NC perfect matching algorithm led researchers\nto study matching vis-a-vis clever relaxations of the class NC. In this vein,\nrecently Goldwasser and Grossman [GG15] gave a pseudo-deterministic RNC\nalgorithm for finding a perfect matching in a bipartite graph, i.e., an RNC\nalgorithm with the additional requirement that on the same graph, it should\nreturn the same (i.e., unique) perfect matching for almost all choices of\nrandom bits.

This structure has recently arisen in the\nstudy of three-dimensional graph drawings. This paper presents the beginnings\nof a theory of track layouts. First we determine the maximum number of edges in\na $(k,t)$-track layout, and show how to colour the edges given fixed linear\norderings of the vertex colour classes. We then describe methods for the\nmanipulation of track layouts. For example, we show how to decrease the number\nof edge colours in a track layout at the expense of increasing the number of\ntracks, and vice versa. We then study the relationship between track layouts\nand other models of graph layout, namely stack and queue layouts, and geometric\nthickness. One of our principle results is that the queue-number and\ntrack-number of a graph are tied, in the sense that one is bounded by a\nfunction of the other. As corollaries we prove that acyclic chromatic number is\nbounded by both queue-number and stack-number. Finally we consider track\nlayouts of planar graphs. While it is an open problem whether planar graphs\nhave bounded track-number, we prove bounds on the track-number of outerplanar\ngraphs, and give the best known lower bound on the track-number of planar\ngraphs. \n\n"}

{"id": "cs/0602079", "contents": "Title: SISO APP Searches in Lattices with Tanner Graphs Abstract: An efficient, low-complexity, soft-output detector for general lattices is\npresented, based on their Tanner graph (TG) representations. Closest-point\nsearches in lattices can be performed as non-binary belief propagation on\nassociated TGs; soft-information output is naturally generated in the process;\nthe algorithm requires no backtrack (cf. classic sphere decoding), and extracts\nextrinsic information. A lattice's coding gain enables equivalence relations\nbetween lattice points, which can be thereby partitioned in cosets. Total and\nextrinsic a posteriori probabilities at the detector's output further enable\nthe use of soft detection information in iterative schemes. The algorithm is\nillustrated via two scenarios that transmit a 32-point, uncoded\nsuper-orthogonal (SO) constellation for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\nchannels, carved from an 8-dimensional non-orthogonal lattice (a direct sum of\ntwo 4-dimensional checkerboard lattice): it achieves maximum likelihood\nperformance in quasistatic fading; and, performs close to interference-free\ntransmission, and identically to list sphere decoding, in independent fading\nwith coordinate interleaving and iterative equalization and detection.
