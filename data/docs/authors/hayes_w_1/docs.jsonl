Here we investigate, within one specific\nscenario, the fate of such a zero-temperature transition upon coupling of the\nelectronic to lattice degrees of freedom. We study a Kondo-Heisenberg model\nwith volume-dependent Kondo coupling -- this model displays both Kondo volume\ncollapse and Kondo-breakdown transitions, as well as Lifshitz transitions\nassociated with a change of the Fermi-surface topology. Within a large-N\ntreatment, we find that the Lifshitz transition tends to merge with the Kondo\nvolume collapse and hence becomes first order, whereas the Kondo breakdown\ntransition remains of second order except for very soft lattices. Interesting\nphysics emerges at the zero-temperature endpoint of the Kondo volume collapse:\nFor electrons in two space dimensions, this endpoint is located at the Lifshitz\nline for a large range of parameters, thus two continuous quantum phase\ntransitions coincide without fine tuning.

Predictions\non the dynamics of superconductors following a sudden quench of the pairing\ninteraction have been made based on the effective BCS Hamiltonian; however,\ntheir experimental verification requires the preparation of a suitable excited\nstate of the Hubbard model along a twofold constraint: (i) a sufficiently\nnonadiabatic ramping scheme is essential to excite the nonequilibrium dynamics,\nand (ii) overheating beyond the critical temperature of superconductivity must\nbe avoided. For commonly discussed interaction ramps there is no clear\nseparation of the corresponding energy scales. Here we show that the matching\nof both conditions is simplified by the intrinsic relaxation behavior of\nultracold fermionic systems: For the particular example of a linear ramp we\nexamine the transient regime of prethermalization [M.

Thus\nultracold fermions prove robust to heating which simplifies the observation of\nnonequilibrium BCS dynamics in optical lattices. \n\n"}

By\nRashba-like systems we refer to the Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit coupled\nphases; spin-split systems have spin-up and spin-down Fermi surfaces shifted\nrelative to each other. Both systems break parity but preserve time-reversal\nsymmetry. They belong to a class of symmetry-breaking ground states that\nsatisfy: (i) electron crystal momentum is a good quantum number (ii) these\nstates have no net magnetic moment and (iii) their distribution of `polarized\nspin' in momentum space breaks the lattice symmetry. In this class, the\nrelevant Coulomb matrix elements are found to be nearest-neighbor exchange $J$,\npair-hopping $J'$ and nearest-neighbor repulsion $V$. These ground states lower\ntheir energy most effectively through $J$, hence we name them Class $J$ states.\nThe competing effects of $V-J'$ on the direct and exchange energies determine\nthe relative stability of Class $J$ states. We show that the spin-split and\nRashba-like phases are the most favored ground states within Class $J$ because\nthey have the minimum anisotropy in `polarized spin'.

Two different measures of\nthe impurity contribution to the entanglement have been proposed: the\nimpurity-entanglement-entropy S_{imp} and the negativity N. The first, S_{imp},\nis based on a subtractive procedure where the entanglement-entropy in the\nabsence of the impurity is subtracted from results with the impurity present.\nThe other, N, is the negativity of a part of the system separated from the\nimpurity and the impurity itself. In this paper we compare the two measures and\ndiscuss similarities and differences between them. In the $J-J_2-\\delta$ model\nit is possible to perform very precise variational calculations close to the\nMajumdar-Ghosh-point (J_2 = J / 2 and \\delta = 0) where the system is gapped\nwith a two-fold degenerate dimerized ground-state.

They\nare the most luminous objects detected so far within ~ 100 Mpc, the horizon\ndistance of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), so they are considered to\nbe candidate sources of UHECRs. It was recently argued that the energy\nproduction rate in UHECRs is much larger than that in gamma-ray photons of long\nGRBs measured by the Fermi satellite, which, if true, would challenge the view\nthat GRBs can be the sources of UHECRs. We here suggest that many of the low\nluminosity GRBs, due to their low luminosity, can not trigger the current GRB\ndetectors and hence their contribution to the local gamma-ray energy production\nrate is missing. We find that the real local energy production rate by\nlow-luminosity GRBs, taking into account the missing part, which constitutes a\ndominant fraction of the total amount, could be sufficient to account for the\nflux of UHECRs.

As with the $Z_2$ form of L. de'Medici et al. (Phys. Rev. B 72, 205124\n(2005)), this approach represents a physical electron operator as the product\nof a slave spin and an auxiliary fermion operator. For non-degenerate\nmulti-orbital models, our U(1) approach is advantageous in that it captures the\nnon-interacting limit at the mean-field level. For systems with either a single\norbital or degenerate multiple orbitals, the U(1) and $Z_2$ slave-spin\napproachs yield the same results in the slave-spin-condensed phase. In general,\nthe U(1) slave-spin approach contains a U(1) gauge redundancy, and properly\ndescribes a Mott insulating phase. We apply the U(1) slave-spin approach to\nstudy the metal-to-insulator transition in a five-orbital model for parent iron\npnictides. We demonstrate a Mott transition as a function of the interactions\nin this model. The nature of the Mott insulating state is influenced by the\ninterplay between the Hund's rule coupling and crystal field splittings.

Here, we make\nthe connection between Abelian as well as non-Abelian FQH states and FCIs more\nprecise. Using a gauge-fixed version of Qi's Wannier basis representation of a\nChern band, we demonstrate that the interpolation between several FCI states,\nobtained by short-range lattice interactions in a spin-orbit-coupled kagome\nlattice model, and the corresponding continuum FQH states is smooth: the gap\nremains approximately constant and extrapolates to a finite value in the\nthermodynamic limit, while the low-lying part of the orbital entanglement\nspectrum remains qualitatively unaltered. The orbital entanglement spectra also\nprovide a first glimpse of the edge physics of FCIs via the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence. Corroborating these results, we find that the squared overlaps\nbetween the FCI and FQH ground states are as large as 98.7% for the 8-electron\nLaughlin state at $\\nu=1/3$ (consistent with an earlier study) and 97.8% for\nthe 10-electron Moore-Read state at $\\nu=1/2$.

This result\nleads us to an apparent paradox: we consider a geometry in which a disk-like\nregion made up of a topological insulator is surrounded by an annular strip of\na fractionalized insulator, which is in turn surrounded by the vacuum. If we\ngap both boundaries of the strip, we naively obtain an example of a gapped\ninterface between a topological insulator and the vacuum that does not break\nany symmetries -- an impossibility. The resolution of this paradox is that this\nsystem spontaneously breaks time reversal symmetry in an unusual way, which we\ncall \\emph{weak symmetry breaking}.

However, recent work\ndemonstrates that correlated magnetic fields from Schumann resonances can\nproduce correlated strain noise over global distances, potentially limiting the\nsensitivity of stochastic background searches with advanced detectors. In this\npaper, we estimate the correlated noise budget for the worldwide Advanced LIGO\nnetwork and conclude that correlated noise may affect upcoming measurements. We\ninvestigate the possibility of a Wiener filtering scheme to subtract correlated\nnoise from Advanced LIGO searches, and estimate the required specifications. We\nalso consider the possibility that residual correlated noise remains following\nsubtraction, and we devise an optimal strategy for measuring astronomical\nparameters in the presence of correlated noise. Using this new formalism, we\nestimate the loss of sensitivity for a broadband, isotropic stochastic\nbackground search using 1 yr of LIGO data at design sensitivity.

Exhaustive classifications of\nspin liquids have been carried out in several systems, particularly in the\npresence of full SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry. Real magnetic compounds,\nhowever, generically break SU(2) spin symmetry as a result of spin-orbit\ncoupling - which in many materials provides an `order one' effect. We\ngeneralize previous works by using the projective symmetry group method to\nclassify $Z_2$ spin liquids on the square lattice when SU(2) spin symmetry is\nmaximally lifted. We find that, counterintuitively, the lifting of spin\nsymmetry actually results in vastly more spin liquid phases compared to\nSU(2)-invariant systems.

The\nline profiles reveal the presence of two distinct components centered on the\nstar velocity, a broad component extending up to ~10 km/s and a narrow\ncomponent indicating an expansion velocity of ~2 km/s.

The angular aperture of the bipolar\noutflow is ~45 deg with respect to the star axis, which makes an angle of ~13\ndeg with the line of sight.

In particular, we focus on the role of the\nmomentum-dependence of the two-particle interaction V(q). Usually, V(q) is\nassumed to be a constant and integrals are regularized in the ultraviolet `by\nhand' employing an ad hoc procedure. As the momentum dependence of the\ninteraction is irrelevant in the renormalization group sense this does not\naffect the universal low-energy properties of the model, e.g. exponents of\npower laws, if all energy scales are sent to zero. If, however, the momentum k\nis fixed away from the Fermi momentum k_F, with |k-k_F| setting a nonvanishing\nenergy scale, the details of V(q) start to matter.

In a Landau Fermi\nLiquid, the single-impurity Kondo effect is the screening of an impurity spin\nat low temperature $T$. The two-impurity Kondo model then describes the\ncompetition between the Kondo interaction and the Heisenberg interaction\nbetween two impurity spins, also called the RKKY interaction. For spin-$1/2$\nimpurities, that competition leads to a quantum phase transition from a\nKondo-screened phase to a phase in which the two impurity spins screen one\nanother. Our holographic model is based on a $(1+1)$-dimensional CFT\ndescription of the two-impurity Kondo model, reliable for two impurities with\nnegligible separation in space. We consider only impurity spins in a totally\nanti-symmetric representation of an $SU(N)$ spin symmetry. We employ a\nlarge-$N$ limit, in which both Kondo and RKKY couplings are double-trace, and\nboth Kondo and inter-impurity screening appear as condensation of single-trace\noperators at the impurities' location. We perform the holographic\nrenormalization of our model, which allows us to identify the Kondo and RKKY\ncouplings as boundary conditions on fields in AdS. We numerically compute the\nphase diagram of our model in the plane of RKKY coupling versus $T$, finding\nevidence for a quantum phase transition from a trivial phase, with neither\nKondo nor inter-impurity screening, to a non-trivial phase, with both Kondo and\nanti-ferromagnetic inter-impurity screening.

In\none example, the lattice geometry confines the dimension-1 particles to small\nloops, which allows the fractons to be fully mobile charges, and the resulting\nphase is equivalent to (3+1)-dimensional toric code.

These invariants\nmust also have observable consequences in the bulk of the system, akin to the\nquantized bulk Hall conductivity in the quantum Hall effect, but such\nconsequences are made elusive by the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)$ symmetry in\nthe superconductor. Here we focus on 2+1 dimensional spin-less $p$-wave\nsuperconductors and show that emergent gravity serves as a natural bulk probe\nfor their topological invariant. This emergent gravity is due to the same\nattractive interaction between fermions that leads to superconductivity, and is\ntherefore built into topological superconductors. The bulk response of a\ntopological superconductor to the emergent gravitational field is encoded in a\ngravitational Chern-Simons term, and is related to the existence of robust\nboundary modes via energy-momentum conservation, or gravitational anomaly\ninflow.

A good starting point in understanding the physics\nis a continuum model (CM) proposed by Lopes dos Santos et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n99, 256802 (2007)] and Bistritzer et al. [PNAS 108, 12233 (2011)] for TBG at\nsmall twist angles, which successfully predicts the bandwidth reduction of the\nmiddle two bands of TBG near the first magic angle $\\theta_0=1.05^\\circ$. In\nthis paper, we analyze the symmetries of the CM and investigate the low energy\nflat band structure in the entire moir\\'e Brillouin zone near $\\theta_0$.\nInstead of observing flat bands at only one \"magic\" angle, we notice that the\nbands remain almost flat within a small range around $\\theta_0$, where multiple\ntopological transitions occur. The topological transitions are caused by the\ncreation and annihilation of Dirac nodes at either $\\text{K}$,\n$\\text{K}^\\prime$, or $\\Gamma$ points, or along the high symmetry lines in the\nmoir\\'e Brillouin zone. We trace the evolution of the nodes and find that there\nare several processes transporting them from $\\Gamma$ to $\\text{K}$ and\n$\\text{K}^\\prime$. At the $\\Gamma$ point, the lowest energy levels of the CM\nare doubly degenerate for some range of twisting angle around $\\theta_0$,\nsuggesting that the physics is not described by any two band model.

We study the interplay of these competing tendencies by\nconsidering time evolution combining both unitary and projective dynamics. We\nbegin by constructing a toy model of Bell pair dynamics which demonstrates that\nmeasurements can keep a system in a state of low (i.e. area law) entanglement,\nin contrast with the volume law entanglement produced by generic pure unitary\ntime evolution. While the simplest Bell pair model has area law entanglement\nfor any measurement rate, as seen in certain non-interacting systems, we show\nthat more generic models of entanglement can feature an area-to-volume law\ntransition at a critical value of the measurement rate, in agreement with\nrecent numerical investigations. As a concrete example of these ideas, we\nanalytically investigate Clifford evolution in qubit systems which can exhibit\nan entanglement transition. We are able to identify stabilizer size\ndistributions characterizing the area law, volume law and critical 'fixed\npoints.' We also discuss Floquet random circuits, where the answers depend on\nthe order of limits - one order of limits yields area law entanglement for any\nnon-zero measurement rate, whereas a different order of limits allows for an\narea law - volume law transition. Finally, we provide a rigorous argument that\na system subjected to projective measurements can only exhibit a volume law\nentanglement entropy if it also features a subleading correction term, which\nprovides a universal signature of projective dynamics in the high-entanglement\nphase.

Accordingly the conformal transformations'\nissue is discussed by invoking the assumed invariance of the laws of physics --\nin particular the laws of gravity -- under conformal transformations of the\nmetric. It is shown that Brans-Dicke and scalar-tensor theories are not\nwell-suited to address physical equivalence of the conformal frames since the\ncorresponding laws of gravity are not invariant under the conformal\ntransformations or Weyl rescalings. The search for conformal symmetry leads us\nto explore the physical consequences of Weyl-invariant theories of gravity,\nthat represent a natural arena where to discuss on physical equivalence of the\nconformally related representations. We show that conformal invariance of the\naction of a (supposedly conformal invariant) theory and of the derived motion\nequations is not enough to ensure actual Weyl invariance.

The density\nhistograms (PDFs) of these runs exhibit either bimodal shapes or a single peak\nat low densities plus a slope change at high densities. Final static situations\nmay be established, but the equilibrium is very fragile: small density\nfluctuations in the warm phase require large variations in the density of the\ncold phase, probably inducing shocks into the clouds. This result suggests that\nsuch configurations are highly unlikely. Simulations including turbulent\nforcing show that large- scale forcing is incapable of erasing the signature of\nthe TI in the density PDFs, but small-scale, stellar-like forcing causes\nerasure of the signature of the instability. However, these simulations do not\nreach stationary regimes, TI driving an ever-increasing star formation rate.\nSimulations including magnetic fields, self-gravity and the Coriolis force show\nno significant difference between the PDFs of stable and unstable cases, and\nreach stationary regimes, suggesting that the combination of the stellar\nforcing and the extra effective pressure provided by the magnetic field and the\nCoriolis force overwhelm TI as a density-structure generator in the ISM.

Some real galaxies have\ndiffuse cores and predict bright core images (magnification mu>~0.1), but more\ncommon are galaxies that predict faint core images (mu<~0.001). Thus, stellar\nmass distributions alone are probably concentrated enough to explain the lack\nof observed core images, and may require observational sensitivity to improve\nby an order of magnitude before detections of core images become common.\nTwo-image lenses will tend to have brighter core images than four-image lenses,\nso they will be the better targets for finding core images and exploiting these\ntools for studying the central mass distributions of distant galaxies. \n\n"}

The scaling approach has assumed that\nhighly nonlinear structures obey `stable clustering' and are frozen in proper\ncoordinates. Our results show that, when transformed under the self-similarity\nscaling, the scale-free spectra define a nonlinear locus that is clearly\nshallower than would be required under stable clustering. Furthermore, the\nsmall-scale nonlinear power increases as both the power-spectrum index n and\nthe density parameter Omega decrease, and this evolution is not well accounted\nfor by the previous scaling formulae.

We demonstrate that the quantity which is\nordering is sublattice parity, referring to the geometric property of a\nbipartite lattice that it can be subdivided in two sublattices in two different\nways. Re-interpreting standard results of one dimensional physics, we\ndemonstrate that the same order is responsible for the phenomenon of\nspin-charge separation in strongly interacting one dimensional electron\nsystems. In fact, the stripe phases can be seen from this perspective as the\nprecise generalization of the Luttinger liquid to higher dimensions. Most of\nthis paper is devoted to a detailed exposition of the mean-field theory of\nsublattice parity order in 2+1 dimensions. Although the quantum-dynamics of the\nspin- and charge degrees of freedom is fully taken into account, a perfect\nsublattice parity order is imposed. Due to novel order-out-of-disorder physics,\nthe sublattice parity order gives rise to full stripe order at long wavelength.\nThis adds further credibility to the notion that stripes find their origin in\nthe microscopic quantum fluctuations and it suggests a novel viewpoint on the\nrelationship between stripes and high Tc superconductivity. \n\n"}

In photoemission\nthis is seen as a coherent quasiparticle peak emerging from an incoherent\nbackground, in optics as violation of the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule\nindicating effective mass reduction of superconducting carriers. We propose\nthat this is a manifestation of the fundamental electron-hole asymmetry of\ncondensed matter described by the theory of hole superconductivity. The theory\nasserts that electrons in nearly empty bands and holes in nearly full bands are\nfundamentally different : the former yield high conductivity and normal metals,\nthe latter yield low normal state conductivity and high temperature\nsuperconductivity. This is because the normal state transport of electrons is\ncoherent and that of holes is incoherent. We explain how this asymmetry arises\nfrom the Coulomb interaction between electrons in atoms and the nature of\natomic orbitals, and propose a simple Hamiltonian to describe it. A $universal$\nmechanism for superconductivity follows from this physics, whereby dressed hole\ncarriers undress by pairing, turning (partially) into electrons and becoming\nmore mobile in the superconducting state. \n\n"}

The most important example is the transition of the S = 1/2 square\nlattice antiferromagnet between the Neel state (which breaks spin rotation\ninvariance) and the paramagnetic valence bond solid (which preserves spin\nrotation invariance but breaks lattice symmetries). We show that these two\nstates are separated by a second order quantum phase transition. The critical\ntheory is not expressed in terms of the order parameters characterizing either\nstate (as would be the case in Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory) but involves\nfractionalized degrees of freedom and an emergent, topological, global\nconservation law.

In the heavy electron state, this\nsea of spinless fermions is completely filled and the electron Fermi surface\nexpands by one electron per unit cell to compensate the positively charged\nbackground, forming a ``large'' Fermi surface. Arbitrarily weak magnetism\ncauses the spinless Fermi sea to annihilate with part of the Fermi sea of the\nconduction electrons, leading to a small Fermi surface. Our results thus enable\nus to show that the Fermi surface volume contracts from a large, to a small\nvolume at a quantum critical point. However, the sum rules also permit the\npossible formation of a new phase, sandwiched between the antiferromagnet and\nthe heavy electron phase, where the charged spinless fermions develop a true\nFermi surface. \n\n"}

The approach is based on a class of\nKerr-Schild metrics representing minimal deformations of the Kerr-Newman\nsolution, and allows us to give a common treatment for (charged and uncharged)\nrotating and nonrotating black holes. It is shown that the requirement of\nsmoothness of the source constraints the structure of the core region in many\nrespects: in particular, for Schwarzschild holes a de Sitter core can be\nselected, which is surrounded by a smooth shell giving a leading contribution\nto the total mass of the source. In the rotating, noncharged case the source\nhas a similar structure, taking the form of a (anisotropic and rotating) de\nSitter-like core surrounded by a rotating elliptic shell. The Kerr singular\nring is regularized by anisotropic matter rotating in the equatorial plane, so\nthat the negative sheet of the Kerr geometry is absent. In the charged case the\nsources take the form of ``bags'', which can have de Sitter or anti de Sitter\ninteriors and a smooth domain wall boundary, with a tangential stress providing\ncharge confinement. The ADM and Tolman relations are used to calculate the\ntotal mass of the sources. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-ph/0006027", "contents": "Title: Unbroken versus broken mirror world: a tale of two vacua Abstract: If the Lagrangian of nature respects parity invariance then there are two\ndistinct possibilities: either parity is unbroken by the vacuum or it is\nspontaneously broken. We examine the two simplest phenomenologically consistent\ngauge models which have unbroken and spontaneously broken parity symmetries,\nrespectively. These two models have a Lagrangian of the same form, but a\ndifferent parameter range is chosen in the Higgs potential. They both predict\nthe existence of dark matter and can explain the MACHO events. However, the\nmodels predict quite different neutrino physics. Although both have light\nmirror (effectively sterile) neutrinos, the ordinary-mirror neutrino mixing\nangles are unobservably tiny in the broken parity case. The minimal broken\nparity model therefore cannot simultaneously explain the solar, atmospheric and\nLSND data. By contrast, the unbroken parity version can explain all of the\nneutrino anomalies. Furthermore, we argue that the unbroken case provides the\nmost natural explanation of the neutrino physics anomalies (irrespective of\nwhether evidence from the LSND experiment is included) because of its\ncharacteristic maximal mixing prediction. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-th/0201127", "contents": "Title: Strong Brane Gravity and the Radion at Low Energies Abstract: For the 2-brane Randall-Sundrum model, we calculate the bulk geometry for\nstrong gravity, in the low matter density regime, for slowly varying matter\nsources. This is relevant for astrophysical or cosmological applications. The\nwarped compactification means the radion can not be written as a homogeneous\nmode in the orbifold coordinate, and we introduce it by extending the\ncoordinate patch approach of the linear theory to the non-linear case. The\nnegative tension brane is taken to be in vacuum. For conformally invariant\nmatter on the positive tension brane, we solve the bulk geometry as a\nderivative expansion, formally summing the `Kaluza-Klein' contributions to all\norders. For general matter we compute the Einstein equations to leading order,\nfinding a scalar-tensor theory with $\\omega(\\Psi) \\propto \\Psi / (1 - \\Psi)$,\nand geometrically interpret the radion. We comment that this radion scalar may\nbecome large in the context of strong gravity with low density matter.\nEquations of state allowing $(\\rho - 3 P)$ to be negative, can exhibit behavior\nwhere the matter decreases the distance between the 2 branes, which we\nillustrate numerically for static star solutions using an incompressible fluid.\nFor increasing stellar density, the branes become close before the upper mass\nlimit, but after violation of the dominant energy condition. This raises the\ninteresting question of whether astrophysically reasonable matter, and initial\ndata, could cause branes to collide at low energy, such as in dynamical\ncollapse. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0311203", "contents": "Title: Spin chains and string theory Abstract: Recently, an impressive agreement was found between anomalous dimensions of\ncertain operators in N=4 SYM and rotating strings with two angular momenta in\nthe bulk of AdS5xS5. A one-loop field theory computation, which involves\nsolving a Heisenberg chain by means of the Bethe ansatz agrees with the large\nangular momentum limit of a rotating string. We point out that the Heisenberg\nchain can be equally well solved by using a sigma model approach. Moreover we\nalso show that a certain limit, akin to the BMN limit, leads exactly to the\nsame sigma model for a string rotating with large angular momentum. The\nagreement is then at the level of the action. As an upshot we propose that the\nrotating string should be identified with a coherent, semi-classical state\nbuilt out of the eigenstates of the spin chain. The agreement is then complete.\nFor example we show that the mean value of the spin <S> gives, precisely, the\nposition of the string in the bulk. This suggests a more precise formulation of\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence in the large-N limit and also indicates a way to\nobtain string theory duals of other gauge theories. \n\n"}

In this proceeding, we study the Planck scale\neffects on the primordial spectrum in the power-law inflation using a model\nwhich preserves local Lorentz invariance.
