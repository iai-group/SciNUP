It\nrelies on the method developed by Ren\\'e Garnier and published in 1928 in a\npaper which seems today to be totally forgotten. Garnier's approach is more\ngeometrical and constructive than the variational one, and it provides minimal\ndisks without branch point. However, it is sometimes really complicated, and\neven obscure or incomplete. Following Garnier's initial ideas, we propose a new\nproof, which intends not only to be complete, but also simpler and moderner\nthan his one. This work mainly relies on a systematic use of Fuchsian systems\nand on the relation that we establish between the reality of such systems and\ntheir monodromy. Garnier's method is based on the following fact: using the\nspinor Weierstrass representation for minimal surfaces, we can associate a real\nFuchsian second-order equation, defined on the Riemann sphere, with each\nminimal disk with a polygonal boundary curve. The monodromy of the equation is\ndetermined by the oriented directions of the edges of the boundary. To solve\nthe Plateau problem, we are thus led to solve a Riemann-Hilbert problem.

A\ngeneral steady spiral solution of incompressible inviscid axisymmetric flow was\nobtained analytically by applying separation of variables to the 3D Euler\nequations. The solution, depending on 3 parameters, describes the spiral path\nof the fluid material element on the Bernoulli surface, whereas some new exact\nsolutions were obtained to be bounded within the whole region. The first one is\na continued typhoon-like vortex solution, where there are two intrinsic length\nscales. One is the radius of maximum circular velocity $r_m$, the other is the\nradius of the vortex kernel $r_k=\\sqrt{2}r_m$. The second one is a multi-planar\nsolution, periodically in $z$-coordinate. Within each layer, the solution is a\numbrella vortex similar to the first one. The third one is also a multi-planar\nsolution in $z$-coordinate.

Freidlin-Wentzell\ntheory provides a general formulation of large-deviations scaling for\nnon-equilibrium stochastic processes, through a representation in terms of a\nHamiltonian dynamical system.

A repulsion of the critical zeros of these L-functions\naway from the center of the critical strip was observed numerically by S. J.\nMiller in 2006; such behaviour deviates qualitatively from the conjectural\nlimiting distribution of the zeros (for large conductors this distribution is\nexpected to approach the one-level density of eigenvalues of orthogonal\nmatrices after appropriate rescaling).Our purpose here is to provide a random\nmatrix model for Miller's surprising discovery. We consider the family of even\nquadratic twists of a given elliptic curve. The main ingredient in our model is\na calculation of the eigenvalue distribution of random orthogonal matrices\nwhose characteristic polynomials are larger than some given value at the\nsymmetry point in the spectra. We call this sub-ensemble of SO(2N) the excised\northogonal ensemble. The sieving-off of matrices with small values of the\ncharacteristic polynomial is akin to the discretization of the central values\nof L-functions implied by the formula of Waldspurger and Kohnen-Zagier.The\ncut-off scale appropriate to modeling elliptic curve L-functions is\nexponentially small relative to the matrix size N. The one-level density of the\nexcised ensemble can be expressed in terms of that of the well-known Jacobi\nensemble, enabling the former to be explicitly calculated. It exhibits an\nexponentially small (on the scale of the mean spacing) hard gap determined by\nthe cut-off value, followed by soft repulsion on a much larger scale. Neither\nof these features is present in the one-level density of SO(2N). When N tends\nto infinity we recover the limiting orthogonal behaviour. Our results agree\nqualitatively with Miller's discrepancy. Choosing the cut-off appropriately\ngives a model in good quantitative agreement with the number-theoretical data. \n\n"}

But it is claimed that spinors as such cannot be represented\nin coordinates in a curved space-time. What general covariance means for\ntheories with fermions is thus unclear. In fact both commonplaces are wrong.\nThough it is not widely known, Ogievetsky and Polubarinov (OP) constructed\nspinors in coordinates in 1965, helping to spawn nonlinear group\nrepresentations. Locally, these spinors resemble the orthonormal basis or\n\"tetrad\" formalism in the symmetric gauge, but they are conceptually\nself-sufficient. The tetrad formalism is de-Ockhamized, with 6 extra fields and\n6 compensating gauge symmetries. OP spinors, as developed nonperturbatively by\nBilyalov, admit any coordinates at a point, but \"time\" must be listed first:\nthe product of the metric components and the matrix diag(-1,1,1,1) must have no\nnegative eigenvalues to yield a real symmetric square root function of the\nmetric. Thus the admissible coordinates depend on the types and values of the\nfields. Apart from coordinate order and spinorial two-valuedness, OP spinors\nform, with the metric, a nonlinear geometric object, with Lie and covariant\nderivatives. Such spinors avoid a spurious absolute object in the\nAnderson-Friedman analysis of substantive general covariance. They also permit\nthe gauge-invariant localization of the infinite-component gravitational energy\nin GR. Density-weighted spinors exploit the conformal invariance of the\nmassless Dirac equation to show that the volume element is absent. Thus instead\nof a matrix with 16 components, one can use weighted OP spinors coupled to the\n9-component symmetric unimodular square root of the conformal metric density.\nThe surprising mildness of the restrictions on coordinates for the\nSchwarzschild solution is exhibited.

This dispersion is associated with the continuous\nspectrum of the underlying differential operator and the absence of discrete\neigenvalues.

In this paper we study weak, localized perturbations\nof one-dimensional periodic Schr\\\"odinger operators. Such perturbations give\nrise to such defect modes, and are associated with the emergence of discrete\neigenvalues from the continuous spectrum. Since these isolated eigenvalues are\nlocated near a spectral band edge, there is strong scale-separation between the\nmedium period and the localization length of the defect mode.

The excess currents (due to steric effects)\nassociated with these two steady state solutions are derived and expressed as\ntwo distinct formulas.

We follow the approach of Bleher and\nKuijlaars to reformulate the model in terms of orthogonal polynomials with\nrespect to a Hermitian form. This reformulation was shown to capture the\nessential features of the normal matrix model in the subcritical regime, namely\nthat the zeros of the polynomials tend to a number of segments (the motherbody)\ninside a domain (the droplet) that attracts the eigenvalues in the normal\nmatrix model.\n  In the present paper we analyze the supercritical regime and we find that the\nlarge $n$ behavior is described by the evolution of a spectral curve satisfying\nthe Boutroux condition. The Boutroux condition determines a system of contours\n$\\Sigma_1$, consisting of the motherbody and whiskers sticking out of the\ndomain. We find a second critical behavior at which the original motherbody\nshrinks to a point at the origin and only the whiskers remain.\n  In the regime before the second criticality we also give strong asymptotics\nof the orthogonal polynomials by means of a steepest descent analysis of a $3\n\\times 3$ matrix valued Riemann-Hilbert problem.

Abstract: The hypothesis on complete integrability of equations describing the\npotential motion of incompressible ideal fluid with free surface in 2-D space\nin presence and absence of gravity was formulated by Dyachenko and Zakharov in\n1994 [1]. Later on, the same authors found that these equations have indefinite\nnumber of additional motion constants [2] that was an argument in support of\nthe integrability hypothesis.

The white noise analysis and the Hida\noperators as the creation and annihilation operators for free fields are used.\nThe whole Bogoliubov method is unchanged. Causal axioms of such QFT make sense\non any globally causal space-times. Perturbative QFT with Hida operators is\nanalysed on the flat Minkowski space-time and on the static Einstein Universe\n(EU). On the flat Minkowski space-time this allowed us to go a step further in\nthe analysis of the adiabatic limit problem, the existence of which has a much\nwider scope than in the theory based on Wightman's operator valued\ndistributions. The natural condition of existence of the adiabatic limit (as\ngeneralized integral kernel operators of white noise calculus) for higher-order\ncontributions to the interacting fields, together with the remaining\nassumptions of causal QFT (including the natural invariance conditions, e.g.\ngauge invariance), allowed us to reduce the freedom in choice of\nrenormalization and imposed nontrivial conditions on the masses of elementary\nparticles.

The fundamental issue of whether one or both of the\nsteady weak/strong shocks are physically admissible has been vigorously debated\nover the past eight decades and has not yet been settled definitively. On the\nother hand, the Prandtl-Meyer reflection configurations are core configurations\nin the structure of global entropy solutions of the 2-D Riemann problem, while\nthe Riemann solutions themselves are local building blocks and determine local\nstructures, global attractors, and large-time asymptotic states of general\nentropy solutions. In this sense, we have to understand the reflection\nconfigurations to understand fully the global entropy solutions of 2-D\nhyperbolic systems of conservation laws, including the admissibility issue for\nthe entropy solutions. In this monograph, we address this longstanding open\nissue and present our analysis to establish the stability theorem for the\nsteady weak shock solutions as the long-time asymptotics of the Prandtl-Meyer\nreflection configurations for unsteady potential flow for all the physical\nparameters up to the detachment angle.

Following Korotkin we solve the\nRiemann-Hilbert problem in terms of the Szego kernel of certain Riemann\nsurfaces branched over the given 2m+2 points.

We distinguish between the minimum uncertainty\nentropy of pure states, and the excess statistical entropy of mixtures. \n\n"}
