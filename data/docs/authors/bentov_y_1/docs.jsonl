This paradigmatic\nmodel arises in many contexts, and describes the (particle-hole symmetric)\nsuperfluid--Mott insulator quantum phase transition in the Bose--Hubbard model.\nThe application of a magnetic field opens up a wide range of physical\nobservables, and we present a detailed overview of the charge and thermal\ntransport and thermodynamic response. We combine several different approaches\nincluding the epsilon expansion and associated Quantum Boltzmann Equation\n(QBE), entropy drift, and arguments based on Lorentz invariance. The results\ndiffer markedly from the zero field case, and we include an extended discussion\nof the finite thermal conductivity which emerges in the presence of a magnetic\nfield. We derive an integral equation that governs its response and explore the\ncrossover upon changing the magnetic field. This equation may be interpreted as\na projection equation in the low field limit, and clearly highlights the\nimportant role of collision invariants (or zero modes) in the hydrodynamic\nregime. Using an epsilon expansion around three-dimensions, our analytic and\nnumerical results interpolate between our previously published value and the\nexact limit of two-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. \n\n"}

We propose a mechanism to partially or completely\ncancel this hierarchy in the light neutrino mass matrix in the seesaw context.\nThe two main ingredients of the cancellation mechanism are the existence of\nthree fermionic gauge singlets and of a discrete flavor symmetry G_f which is\nbroken at a higher scale than SO(10). Two realizations of the cancellation\nmechanism are presented. The realization based on the Frobenius group T7 = Z7 x\nZ3 leads to a partial cancellation of the hierarchy and relates maximal 2-3\nlepton mixing with the geometric hierarchy of the up-quark masses. In the\nrealization with the group Sigma(81) the cancellation is complete and\ntri-bimaximal lepton mixing is reproduced at the lowest order.

Starting from the\nbound-state Hamiltonian equation of motion in QCD, we derive relativistic\nlight-front wave equations in terms of an invariant impact variable zeta which\nmeasures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron\nat equal light-front time. These equations of motion in physical space-time are\nequivalent to the equations of motion which describe the propagation of spin-J\nmodes in anti--de Sitter (AdS) space. Its eigenvalues give the hadronic\nspectrum, and its eigenmodes represent the probability distributions of the\nhadronic constituents at a given scale.

One minimal theory that realizes such a scenario is the\nAtomic Dark Matter model, in which two fermions oppositely charged under a new\nU(1) dark force are initially coupled to a thermal bath of \"dark photons\" but\neventually recombine into neutral atom-like bound states and begin forming\ngravitationally-bound structures.

Within the \"canonical\"\neffective-potential approach these are, for instance: the need to handle\ninfinite series of nested commutators of derivatives of field-dependent mass\nmatrices, the need to cope with spurious IR divergences emerging in the\nconsistent leading-order approximation and, in particular, the need to account\nfor the fine interplay between the renormalization effects in the one- and\ntwo-point Green's functions which, indeed, is essential for the proper stable\nvacuum identification and, thus, for the correct interpretation of the results.\nIn this note we illustrate some of these issues in the realm of the minimal\nabelian Higgs model and two of its simplest extensions including extra heavy\nscalars in the spectrum in attempt to exemplify the key aspects of the usual\n\"hierarchy problem\" lore in a very specific and simple setting.

The coupling to this impurity is not\nscale invariant, and the physics involves a crossover between weak and strong\ncoupling regimes. While the impurity contribution to the entanglement has been\ncomputed numerically in the past, little is known analytically about it, since\nin particular the methods of conformal invariance cannot be applied because of\nthe presence of a crossover length. We show in this paper that the small\ncoupling expansion of the entanglement entropy in this problem is quite\ngenerally plagued by strong infrared divergences, implying a non-perturbative\ndependence on the coupling. The large coupling expansion turns out to be better\nbehaved, thanks to powerful results from the boundary CFT formulation and, in\nsome cases, the underlying integrability of the problem. However, it is clear\nthat this expansion does not capture well the crossover physics. In the\nintegrable case -- which includes problems such as an XXZ chain with a modified\nlink, the interacting resonant level model or the anisotropic Kondo model -- a\nnon perturbative approach is in principle possible using form-factors. We adapt\nin this paper the ideas of [1,2] to the gapless case and show that, in the\nrather simple case of the resonant level model, and after some additional\nrenormalizations, the form factors approach yields remarkably accurate results\nfor the entanglement all the way from short to large distances.

It was previously\nbelieved that the surface of an ETI must be gapless unless one of these\nsymmetries is broken. A well-known symmetry-preserving, gapless surface\ntermination of an ETI supports an odd number of Dirac cones. In this paper we\ndeduce a symmetry-respecting, gapped surface termination of an ETI, which\ncarries an intrinsic 2d topological order, Moore-Read x anti-semion. The\nMoore-Read sector supports non-Abelian charge 1/4 anyons, while the Abelian,\nanti-semion sector is electrically neutral. Time-reversal symmetry is\nimplemented in this surface phase in a highly non-trivial way. Moreover, it is\nimpossible to realize this phase strictly in 2d, simultaneously preserving its\nimplementation of both the particle number and time-reversal symmetries. A 1d\nedge on the ETI surface between the topologically-ordered phase and the\ntopologically trivial time-reversal-broken phase with a Hall conductivity\nsigma_H = 1/2, carries a right-moving neutral Majorana mode, a right-moving\nbosonic charge mode and a left-moving bosonic neutral mode.

In this work we\ndemonstrate that such a phenomenon, known as non-local convertibility, is due\nto the edge state (de)construction occurring in the system. To this end, we\nemploy the example of the Ising chain, displaying an order-disorder quantum\nphase transitions. Employing both analytical and numerical methods, we compute\nentanglement entropies for various system bipartitions (A|B) and consider\nground states with and without Majorana edge states.

When relating\nthe black-hole electric charges to the baryon-chemical potentials it was found\nthat the phenomenologically-deduced parameters from various particle ratios in\nthe statistical thermal models agree well with the ones determined from the\nthermal radiation from charged black-hole. Accordingly, the resulting freezeout\nconditions, such as $s/T^3=7$ and $<E>/<N>=1~$GeV, are confirmed at finite\nchemical potentials, as well. Furthermore, the problematic of strangeness\nproduction in elementary collisions can be interpreted by thermal particle\nproduction from the Hawking-Unruh radiation. Consequently, the freezeout\ntemperature depends on the quark masses. This leads to a deviation from full\nequilibrium and thus a suppression of the strangeness production in the\nelementary collisions. But in nucleus-nucleus collisions, an average\ntemperature should be introduced in order to dilute the quark masses. This\nnearly removes the strangeness suppression.

We assume that the fundamental degrees\nof freedom are scalars transforming under some representation of $SO(5)$ and\nsubject to some unspecified strong interactions. The holographic description\npresented here is inspired by previous studies performed in the context of QCD\nand it allows for the consideration of spin one and spin zero resonances. The\nresulting spectrum leads in a natural way to a variety of resonances. Namely,\nthose transforming under the unbroken $SO(4)$ subgroup exhibit an exact\ndegeneracy between the two Regge trajectories of vector and scalar channels,\nwhile the resonances with quantum numbers in the $SO(5)/ SO(4)$ coset lie on a\ntrajectory of (heavier) spin one states and a non-degenerated one of scalar\nresonances where the four lowest lying ones are massless.

Here we extend this approach to systems with locally conserved\nquantities (e.g., energy).

We show that in general a spectral structure with a\nnarrow width appears in two scenarios: I) \"Spectrum broadening\" for the\ncontinuous sources with a delta-function-like injection spectrum.

In this scenario, the width of the excess constrains both the power\nindex and the distance of the source. Possible such sources are pulsar wind\nnebulae (PWNe) and supernova remnants (SNRs).

We focus on\nmodels of trans-Planckian physics which lead to a modulated primordial\nspectrum. Rather than looking at a generic modulated spectrum, our calculations\nare based on a specific model, and are intended as a case study for the sort of\nconstraints one could hope to apply on a well-motivated model of\ntrans-Planckian physics. We present results for three different approaches -- a\ngrid search in a subset of the overall parameter space, a Fisher matrix\nestimate of the likely error ellipses, and a Monte Carlo Markov Chain fit to a\nsimulated CMB sky. As was seen in previous analyses, the likelihood space has\nmultiple peaks, and we show that their distribution can be reproduced via a\nsimple semi-analytic argument. All three methods lead to broadly similar\nresults. We vary 10 cosmological parameters (including two related to the\ntrans-Planckian terms) and show that the amplitude of the tensor perturbations\nis directly correlated with the detectability of any trans-Planckian\nmodulation.

We construct\nthe Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) effective potentials at finite temperature\nfor two types of pairing ansatz, namely the Color-Flavor locking (CFL) state\nand the two flavor superconducting (2SC) state. Strong coupling effects at low\ndensities, such as the off-Fermi surface and antiquarks contribution to the\npairing gap due to the large effective coupling, make the gap, critical\ntemperature and those ratio deviate from those weak coupling values.\nNevertheless, the ratio of the physical quantity for the CFL and that for the\n2SC does not differ so much from the weak coupling value, as long as the\npairing interaction is taken to be the same for the both cases. As a\nconsequence, the CFL state always dominates over 2SC state and the critical\ntemperatures to quark-gluon plasma (QGP) from both states coincides in the\nchiral limit. The energy gain in the CFL state relative to the 2SC state gets\nsmaller towards the critical line dividing (mu, T) plane into the QGP and CFL\nphases, and thus small perturbations can remove the degeneracy of these\ncritical lines. As one of such perturbations, the effect of the strange quark\nmass m_s on the quark-pairing is examined. In particular, using a simple\nkinematical criterion, we discuss the behaviour of the ``color-flavor unlocking\nline'' on which the CFL phase turns into the 2SC phase, against the variation\nof m_s. \n\n"}

Among these, the front form, being the basis for\nlight-cone quantization, is my main focus. I explain a few of its peculiar\nfeatures such as boost and Galilei invariance or separation of relative and\ncenter-of-mass motion. Combining light-cone dynamics and field quantization\nresults in light-cone quantum field theory. As the latter represents a\nfirst-order system, quantization is somewhat nonstandard. I address this issue\nusing Schwinger's quantum action principle, the method of Faddeev and Jackiw,\nand the functional Schroedinger picture. A finite-volume formulation,\ndiscretized light-cone quantization, is analysed in detail. I point out some\nproblems with causality, which are absent in infinite volume. Finally, the\ntriviality of the light-cone vacuum is established.

An example -- supported by Weinberg's successful prediction of the\ncosmological constant -- is the potentially vast landscape of vacua in string\ntheory, where the existence of galaxies and atoms is promoted to a vacuum\nselection criterion. Then, low energy SUSY becomes unnecessary, and\nsupersymmetry -- if present in the fundamental theory -- can be broken near the\nunification scale. All the scalars of the supersymmetric standard model become\nultraheavy, except for a single finely tuned Higgs. Yet, the fermions of the\nsupersymmetric standard model can remain light, protected by chiral symmetry,\nand account for the successful unification of gauge couplings. This framework\nremoves all the difficulties of the SSM: the absence of a light Higgs and\nsparticles, dimension five proton decay, SUSY flavor and CP problems, and the\ncosmological gravitino and moduli problems.
