These\nstudies allow us to specify the range of applications of TDHF in one hand, and,\non the other hand, its intrinsic limitations: absence of tunneling below the\nCoulomb barrier, missing dissipative effects and/or quantum fluctuations.\nTime-dependent mean-field theories should be improved to properly account for\nthese effects.

For individual heavy quarks, we\nfocus on elastic interactions for which the large quark mass enables a Brownian\nmotion treatment. This opens a unique access to thermalization mechanisms for\nheavy quarks at low momentum, and thus to their transport coefficients in the\nquark-gluon fluid. Different approaches to evaluate heavy-quark diffusion are\ndiscussed and compared, including perturbative QCD, effective potential models\nutilizing input from lattice QCD and string-theoretic estimates in conformal\nfield theories. Applications to heavy-quark observables in heavy-ion collisions\nare realized via relativistic Langevin simulations, where we illustrate the\nimportant role of a realistic medium evolution to quantitatively extract the\nheavy-quark diffusion constant. In the heavy quarkonium sector, we briefly\nreview the current status in potential-model based interpretations of\ncorrelation functions computed in lattice QCD, followed by an evaluation of\nquarkonium dissociation reactions in the QGP.

Although many developments remain to be done, the\npossibility to directly use QCD to describe nuclear system is a major challenge\nthat is within reach. In this introduction to the 2009 International\nJoliot-Curie School (EJC2009), new trends in the strong nuclear interaction are\nsummarized starting from quarks and ending with finite or infinite nuclear\nsystems.

Recent advances in the theory of nuclear\nforces, thanks to chiral perturbation and effective field theories, have led to\na new generation of strong nuclear interaction particularly suited to low\nenergy nuclear physics.

Recent achievements in ab initio theories\nthat directly start from the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction and their key\nrole to understand the three-body force are illustrated.

This is suggested by recent work on the phenomenology of flux\ncompactified type IIB string theory. The essential features of this scenario\nare that the gaugino masses are of the anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking (AMSB)\nform, while scalar and trilinear soft SUSY breaking terms are highly\nsuppressed. Renormalization group effects yield an allowable sparticle mass\nspectrum, while at the same time avoiding charged LSPs; the latter are common\nin models with negligible soft scalar masses, such as no-scale or gaugino\nmediation models. Since scalar and trilinear soft terms are highly suppressed,\nthe SUSY induced flavor and CP-violating processes are also suppressed. The\nlightest SUSY particle is the neutral wino, while the heaviest is the gluino.\nIn this model, there should be a strong multi-jet +etmiss signal from squark\npair production at the LHC.

The dependence of the\nhydrodynamic evolution on the choices of\n  $\\sigma$ and $t_{start}$ is explored by means of a Gaussian emulator.\n  To generate particle yields and elliptic flow that are compatible with\nexperimental data the initial state parameters are constrained to be $\\sigma=1$\nfm and $t_{\\rm start}=0.5$ fm. In addition, the influence of changes in the\nequation of state is studied and the results of our event-by-event calculations\nare compared to a calculation with averaged initial conditions. We conclude\nthat even though the initial state parameters can be constrained by yields and\nelliptic flow, the granularity needs to be constrained by other correlation and\nfluctuation observables. \n\n"}

The first experiments on\nsearch for double beta decay in the late of 1940's and beginning of 1950's are\nconsidered. It is underlined that for the first time the 2$\\beta(2\\nu)$ decay\nhas been registered in geochemical experiment with $^{130}$Te in 1950. In\ndirect (counter) experiment this type of decay for the first time has been\nregistered in $^{82}$Se by Michael Moe's group in 1987. Now two neutrino double\nbeta decay has been recorded for 10 nuclei ($^{48}$Ca, $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se,\n$^{96}$Zr, $^{100}$Mo, $^{116}$Cd, $^{128}$Te, $^{130}$Te, $^{150}$Nd,\n$^{238}$U). In addition, the 2$\\beta(2\\nu)$ decay of $^{100}$Mo and $^{150}$Nd\nto the 0$^+_1$ excited state of the daughter nucleus has been observed and the\nECEC(2$\\nu$) process in $^{130}$Ba was observed too. As to neutrinoless double\nbeta decay (2$\\beta(0\\nu)$) this process has not yet been registered. In the\nreview results of the most sensitive experiments (Heidelberg-Moscow, IGEX,\nCUORICINO, NEMO-3) are discussed and conservative upper limits on effective\nMajorana neutrino mass and the coupling constant of the Majoron to the neutrino\nare established as $\\langle m_{\\nu} \\rangle < 0.75$ eV and $\\langle g_{ee}\n\\rangle < 1.9 \\cdot 10^{-4}$, respectively.\n  The next-generation experiments, where the mass of the isotopes being studied\nwill be as grand as 100 to 1000 kg, are discussed. These experiments will have\nstarted within a few years. In all probability, they will make it possible to\nreach the sensitivity to the neutrino mass at a level of 0.01 to 0.1 eV. \n\n"}

In particular, we\nexplore the theoretical uncertainties associated with modeling contributions of\nhadronic intermediate states. Taking into account constraints from low- and\nhigh-energy, parity-conserving electroproduction measurements, choosing\ndifferent models for contributions from the non-resonant processes, and\nperforming the corresponding flavor rotations to obtain the electroweak\namplitude, we arrive at an estimate of the uncertainty in the total\ncontribution to the parity-violating asymmetry. At the kinematics of the Q-Weak\nexperiment, we obtain a correction to the asymmetry equivalent to a shift in\nthe proton weak charge of $(0.0054\\pm0.0020)$. This should be compared to the\nvalue of the proton's weak charge of $\\qwp=0.0713\\pm0.0008$ that includes SM\ncontributions at tree level and one-loop radiative corrections. Therefore, we\nobtain a new Standard Model prediction for the parity-violating asymmetry in\nthe kinematics of the Q-Weak experiment of $(0.0767\\pm0.0008\\pm0.0020_{\\gamma\nZ})$. The latter error leads to a relative uncertainty of 2.8% in the\ndetermination of the proton's weak charge, and is dominated by the uncertainty\nin the isospin structure of the inclusive cross section. We argue that future\nparity-violating inelastic $ep$ asymmetry measurements at low-to-moderate $Q^2$\nand $W^2$ could be exploited to reduce the uncertainty associated with the\ndispersion correction. Because the corresponding shift and error bar decrease\nmonotonically with decreasing beam energy, a determination of the proton's weak\ncharge with a lower-energy experiment or measurements of \"isotope ratios\" in\natomic parity-violation could provide a useful cross check on any implications\nfor physics beyond the Standard Model derived from the Q-Weak measurement. \n\n"}

We express the contribution from multiple parton scattering and\ninduced gluon radiation to the DY dilepton spectra in terms of nuclear modified\neffective beam quark distribution functions. The modification depends on the\nquark transport parameter in nuclear medium. This is similar to the final-state\nmultiple parton scattering in deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) off large\nnuclei and leads to the suppression of the Drell-Yan cross section in $p+A$\nrelative to $p+p$ collisions. With the value of quark transport parameter\ndetermined from the nuclear modification of single-inclusive DIS hadron spectra\nas measured by the HERMES experiment, we calculate DY spectra in $p+A$\ncollisions and find the nuclear suppression due to beam parton energy loss\nnegligible at the Fermilab energy $E_{\\rm lab}$=800 GeV in the kinematic region\nas covered by the E866 experiment.

With a realistic equation of state, Glauber model\ninitial conditions and a small specific shear viscosity eta/s = 0.08, the\ndifferential charged hadron elliptic flow v_2^{ch}(p_T,sqrt(s)) is found to\nexhibit a very broad maximum as a function of sqrt(s) around top RHIC energy,\nrendering it almost independent of collision energy for 39 < sqrt(s) < 2760 A\nGeV. Compared to ideal fluid dynamical simulations, this \"saturation\" of\nelliptic flow is shifted to higher collision energies by shear viscous effects.\nFor color-glass motivated MC-KLN initial conditions, which require a larger\nshear viscosity eta/s = 0.2 to reproduce the measured elliptic flow, a similar\n\"saturation\" is not observed up to LHC energies, except for very low p_T. We\nemphasize that this \"saturation\" of the elliptic flow is not associated with\nthe QCD phase transition, but arises from the interplay between radial and\nelliptic flow which shifts with sqrt(s) depending on the fluid's viscosity and\nleads to a subtle cancellation between increasing contributions from light and\ndecreasing contributions from heavy particles to v_2 in the sqrt(s) range where\nv_2^{ch}(p_T,sqrt(s)) at fixed p_T is maximal.

In this paper, we evaluate the modifications of these CPC-MSSM\nresults when CP-violating (CPV) phases are turned on explicitly, leading to the\nCP-violating MSSM (CPV-MSSM). We investigate the role of the CPV phases in\n(some of) the soft Supersymmetry (SUSY) terms on both the mass of the lightest\nHiggs boson $h_1$, and the rates for the processes $gg \\rightarrow h_1\n\\rightarrow \\gamma \\gamma$, $gg \\rightarrow h_1 \\rightarrow ZZ^*\\rightarrow\n4l$, $gg \\rightarrow h_1 \\rightarrow WW^*\\rightarrow l \\nu l \\nu$, $pp\n\\rightarrow V h_1 \\rightarrow V b\\bar b$ and $pp \\rightarrow V h_1 \\rightarrow\nV \\tau^+\\tau^-$, ($V \\equiv W^\\pm, Z$) at the LHC, considering the impact of\nthe flavor constraints as well as the constraints coming from the Electric\nDipole Moment (EDM) measurements. We find that the imaginary part of the top\nand bottom Yukawa couplings can take very small but non-zero values even after\nsatisfying the recent updates from LHC. Our study shows that the CPV-MSSM\nprovides an equally potential solution (like its CP-conserving (CPC)\ncounterpart) to the recent LHC Higgs data. Improvement in different Higgs\ncoupling measurements is necessary in order to test the possibility of probing\nthe small dependence on these CPV phases in the Higgs sector of the MSSM. \n\n"}

To more accurately extract information on the\nsymmetry energy and its density slope at normal density from neutron-nucleus\nscattering data, going beyond the well-known Lane potential, we include\nconsistently the second order terms in isospin asymmetry in both the optical\nmodel potential and the symmetry energy decomposition.

Moreover, we discuss effects of the $U_{sym,1}$ and $U_{sym,2}$ on\ndetermining the density dependence of the symmetry energy, and we find that the\navailable neutron-nucleus scattering data favor a softer density dependence of\nthe symmetry energy at normal density with a negligible contribution from the\n$U_{sym,2}$. \n\n"}

The objective is to\nprovide a modern account of the nuclear EDF formalism that is at variance with\ntraditional presentations that rely, at one point or another, on a {\\it\nHamiltonian-based} picture. The latter is not general enough to encompass what\nthe nuclear EDF method represents as of today. Specifically, the traditional\nHamiltonian-based picture does not allow one to grasp the difficulties\nassociated with the fact that currently available parametrizations of the\nenergy kernel $E[g',g]$ at play in the method do not derive from a genuine\nHamilton operator, would the latter be effective. The method is formulated from\nthe outset through the most general multi-reference, i.e. beyond mean-field,\nimplementation such that the single-reference, i.e. \"mean-field\", derives as a\nparticular case.

This paper explores the correlations among harmonic flow\ncoefficients $v_n$ and their phases $\\Phi_n$, and the rapidity fluctuation of\n$v_n$. The study is carried out usin Pb+Pb events generated by the AMPT model\nwith fixed impact parameter. The overall ellipticity/triangularity of events is\nvaried by selecting on the eccentricities $\\epsilon_n$ or the magnitudes of the\nflow vector $q_n$ for n=2 and 3, respectively. The responses of the $v_n$, the\nevent-plane correlations, and the rapidity fluctuations, to the change in\n$\\epsilon_n$ and $q_n$ are then systematized. Strong positive correlations are\nobserved among all even harmonics $v_2, v_4$, and $v_6$ (all increase with\n$q_2$), between $v_2$ and $v_5$ (both increase with $q_2$) and between $v_3$\nand $v_5$ (both increase with $q_3$), consistent with the effects of nonlinear\ncollective response. In contrast, an anti-correlation is observed between $v_2$\nand $v_3$ similar to that seen between $\\epsilon_2$ and $\\epsilon_3$. These\ncorrelation patterns are found to be independent of whether selecting on $q_n$\nor $\\epsilon_n$, validating the ability of $q_n$ in selecting the initial\ngeometry.

In addition, these modes of excitation appear to be\nsensitive to the uncertain density dependence of the symmetry energy. We study\nthe emergence, evolution, and nature of both the soft and giant isoscalar\nmonopole modes as a function of neutron excess in three unstable Nickel\nisotopes: 56Ni, 68Ni, and 78Ni. The distribution of isoscalar monopole strength\nis computed in a relativistic random-phase approximation using several\naccurately calibrated effective interactions. In particular, a non-spectral\nGreen's function approach is adopted that allows for an exact treatment of the\ncontinuum without any reliance on discretization. The discretization of the\ncontinuum is neither required nor admitted. In the case of 56Ni, the lack of\nlow-energy strength results in a direct correlation between the centroid energy\nof the giant monopole resonance and the incompressibility coefficient of\nsymmetric nuclear matter. In contrast, the large neutron excess in both 68Ni\nand 78Ni generates a significant, yet relatively featureless, amount of\nlow-energy strength that is driven by transitions into the continuum. Moreover,\nthe evolution of monopole strength with neutron excess displays sensitivity to\nthe density dependence of the symmetry energy.

The main goal of this paper is to explore\nthe emergence, evolution, and origin of low energy monopole strength along the\neven-even calcium isotopes: from 40Ca to 60Ca. The distribution of isoscalar\nmonopole strength is computed in a relativistic random phase approximation\n(RPA) using three effective interactions that have been calibrated to the\nproperties of finite nuclei and neutron stars. A non-spectral approach is\nadopted that allows for an exact treatment of the continuum without any\nreliance on discretization. For the stable calcium isotopes, no evidence of\nlow-energy monopole strength is observed, even as the 1f7/2 neutron orbital is\nbeing filled and the neutron-skin thickness progressively grows. Further, in\ncontrast to experimental findings, a mild softening of the monopole response\nwith increasing mass number is predicted. Beyond 48Ca, a significant amount of\nlow-energy monopole strength emerges as soon as the weak-binding neutron\norbitals (2p and 1f5/2) become populated. The emergence and evolution of\nlow-energy strength is identified with transitions from these weakly-bound\nstates into the continuum.

This can lead to observable charge separation along the\ndirection of the strong magnetic field produced by spectator protons in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions, a phenomenon called the chiral magnetic\neffect (CME). A major background source for CME measurements using the\ncharge-dependent azimuthal correlator ($\\Delta\\gamma$) is the intrinsic\nparticle correlations (such as resonance decays) coupled with the azimuthal\nelliptical anisotropy ($v_{2}$). In heavy-ion collisions, the magnetic field\ndirection and event plane angle are correlated, thus the CME and the\n$v_{2}$-induced background are entangled. In this report, we present two\nstudies from STAR to shed further lights on the background issue. (1) The\n$\\Delta\\gamma$ should be all background in small system p+Au and d+Au\ncollisions, because the event plane angles are dominated by geometry\nfluctuations uncorrelated to the magnetic field direction. However, significant\n$\\Delta\\gamma$ is observed, comparable to the peripheral Au+Au data, suggesting\na background dominance in the latter, and likely also in the mid-central Au+Au\ncollisions where the multiplicity and $v_{2}$ scaled correlator is similar.

Naively, in pA\ncollisions one expects no correlation between the orientation of event plane as\nreconstructed from the azimuthal distribution of produced hadrons and the\norientation of magnetic field. If this is the case, any charge-dependent hadron\ncorrelations can only result from the background. Nevertheless, in this paper\nwe point out that in high multiplicity pA collisions a correlation between the\nmagnetic field and the event plane can appear. This is because triggering on\nthe high hadron multiplicity amounts to selecting Fock components of the\nincident proton with a large number of partons that are expected to have a\ntransverse size much larger than the average proton size. We introduce the\neffect of the fluctuating proton size in the Monte Carlo Glauber model and\nevaluate the resulting correlation between the magnetic field and the\nsecond-order event plane in both pA and nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions. The\nfluctuating proton size is found to result in a significant correlation between\nmagnetic field and the event plane in pA collisions, even though the magnitude\nof the correlation is still much smaller than in AA collisions.

A systematic study of the beam energy dependence is performed for Au+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =2.3 - 62.4$ GeV. The transition of the dynamical\norigin of the directed flow is observed. We find that the initial Glauber type\nnucleon-nucleon collisions generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons at midrapidity\ndue to the presence of spectator matter, and this negative nucleon $v_1$ is\nturned to be positive by the meson-baryon interactions at the beam energy\nregion of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} < 30$ GeV. In contrast, above 30 GeV there is no\nspectator shadowing at midrapidity, and initial nucleon-nucleon collisions do\nnot generate directed flow, but subsequent rescatterings among produced\nparticles generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons. It is demonstrated that\nnegative pion-directed flows are mostly generated by the interaction with the\nspectator matter. It is also shown that the squeeze-out effect is largely\nsuppressed in the case of softening, which leads to the enhancement of elliptic\nflow around $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5-7$ GeV. The elliptic flow at midrapidity above 10\nGeV is not influenced by the squeeze-out due to spectator matter, while its\neffect is seen at the forward rapidity range of $y/y_\\mathrm{c.m.}>0.5$, which\ndecreases as beam energy increases. \n\n"}

The\nfirst step, however, is to understand the pion production reactions at the free\nnucleon level. We present an exhaustive study of the charged-current and\nneutral-current neutrino and antineutrino pion production off nucleons, paying\na special attention to the angular distributions of the outgoing pion. We show,\nusing general arguments, that parity violation and time-reversal odd\ncorrelations in the weak differential cross sections are generated from the\ninterference between different contributions to the hadronic current that are\nnot relatively real. Next, we present a detailed comparison of three, state of\nthe art, microscopic models for electroweak pion production off nucleons, and\nwe also confront their predictions with polarized electron data, as a test of\nthe vector content of these models. We also illustrate the importance of\ncarrying out a comprehensive test at the level of outgoing pion angular\ndistributions, going beyond comparisons done for partially integrated cross\nsections, where model differences cancel to a certain extent. Finally, we\nobserve that all charged and neutral current distributions show sizable\nanisotropies, and identify channels for which parity violating effects are\nclearly visible. Based on the above results, we conclude that the use of\nisotropic distributions for the pions in the center of mass of the final\npion-nucleon system, as assumed by some of the Monte Carlo event generators,\nneeds to be improved by incorporating the findings of microscopic calculations. \n\n"}

The\nmodel predicts two states with nucleon quantum numbers which have tentatively\nbeen identified with the N*(1440) and the N*(1710). This paper examines the\nviability of this model by focusing on the decay width of the nucleon members\nof the multiplet. An inequality relating the partial widths of these nucleon\nstates in the N+nucleon channel to the width of the theta+ is derived for this\nmodel under the assuming ideal mixing and that the only significant exact SU(3)\nsymmetry violations are the result of ideal mixing, threshold effects and the\nmasses of pseudo-Goldstone bosons. This inequality is badly violated if the\nstates in the multiplet are the N*(1440) and the N*(1710) and if the recent\nbounds extracted for the theta+ width are reliable.

Hence it\nis important to examine in details uncertainties (and values) of inputs to the\nSSM.

We find that for\nthe case in which charm quark momenta are unchanged from the pQCD production\ncalculation, both the rapidity and transverse momentum spectra of the formed\nJ/Psi are substantially narrower than would be anticipated in scenarios which\ndo not include the in-medium formation. In particular, the average transverse\nmomentum of the J/Psi will exhibit a non-monotonic behavior in the progression\nfrom p-p to p-A to A-A interactions. \n\n"}

The energy region (Tlab=500\nMeV and Tlab=800 MeV) is selected so that the impulse approximation may be\nsafely assumed. Therefore, only free nucleon-nucleon scattering data are used\nas input for the optical potential. Further, the optical potential includes\nproton and neutron ground-state densities that are generated from\naccurately-calibrated models. Even so, these models yield a wide range of\nvalues (from 0.13 fm to 0.28 fm) for the poorly known neutron skin thickness in\n208Pb. An excellent description of the experimental cross section is obtained\nwith all neutron densities. We have invoked analytic insights developed within\nthe eikonal approximation to understand the insensitivity of the differential\ncross section to the various neutron densities. As the diffractive oscillations\nof the cross sections are controlled by the matter radius of the nucleus, the\nlarge spread in the neutron skin among the various models gets diluted into a\nmere 1.5% difference in the matter radius. This renders ineffective the elastic\nreaction as a precision tool for the measurement of neutron radii. \n\n"}

First applications to medium-mass atomic nuclei Abstract: A new analysis method to investigate halos in finite many-fermion systems is\ndesigned, as existing characterization methods are proven to be\nincomplete/inaccurate. A decomposition of the internal wave-function of the\n{$N$-body} system in terms of overlap functions allows a model-independent\nanalysis of medium-range and asymptotic properties of the internal one-body\ndensity. The existence of a spatially decorrelated region in the density\nprofile is related to the existence of three typical energy scales in the\nexcitation spectrum of the {$(N-1)$-body} system. A series of model-independent\nmeasures, taking the internal density as the only input, are introduced.
