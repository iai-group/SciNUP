Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach. We also briefly discuss how the SZ and\nX-ray cluster data can be combined to resolve the helium abundance dependence\nfor the d_a(z) cosmological test. \n\n"}

We outline a model-independent approach, and we study the specific\ncases of (1) direct detection with low-background 1 ton noble-gas detectors and\n(2) a 0.5 TeV center of mass energy electron-positron linear collider. We also\nanalyze the case of indirect detection via two gamma-ray lines, which would\nprovide a verification of such a discovery, although multiple gamma-ray lines\ncan in principle originate from the annihilation of a single dark matter\nparticle. For each search \"channel\", we outline a few assumptions to relate the\nvery small set of parameters we consider (defining the masses of the two WIMPs\nand their relative abundance in the overall dark matter density) with the\nrelevant detection rates.

We investigate the total MF and the\ncontribution of ETGs and LTGs, defined by different criteria (SED, morphology\nor star formation). We unveil a galaxy bimodality in the global MF, better\nrepresented by 2 Schechter functions dominated by ETGs and LTGs, respectively.\nFor the global population we confirm that low-mass galaxies number density\nincreases later and faster than for massive galaxies. We find that the MF\nevolution at intermediate-low values of Mstar (logM<10.6) is mostly explained\nby the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formation\nactivities. The low residual evolution is consistent with ~0.16 merger per\ngalaxy per Gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major). We find that ETGs increase\nin number density with cosmic time faster for decreasing Mstar, with a median\n\"building redshift\" increasing with mass, in contrast with hierarchical models.\nFor LTGs we find that the number density of blue or spiral galaxies remains\nalmost constant from z~1. Instead, the most extreme population of active star\nforming galaxies is rapidly decreasing in number density. We suggest a\ntransformation from blue active spirals of intermediate mass into blue\nquiescent and successively (1-2 Gyr after) into red passive types. The complete\nmorphological transformation into red spheroidals, required longer time-scales\nor follows after 1-2 Gyr.

We consider primordial binaries, dynamically formed\nbinaries (through tidal two-body and three-body exchange interactions) and\ndirect impacts of compact objects (WD/NS/BH). We show that if the primordial\nbinary fraction is small, close encounters dominate the production rate of\ncoalescing compact systems. We find that the two dominant channels are the\ninteraction of field NSs with dynamically formed binaries, and two-body\nencounters. We then estimate the redshift distribution and host galaxy\ndemographics of SGRB progenitors, and find that GCs can provide a significant\ncontribution to the overall observed rate.\n  We have carried out hydrodynamical modeling of evolution of close stellar\nencounters with WD/NS/BH, and show that there is no problem in accounting for\nthe energy budget of a typical SGRB. The particulars of each encounter are\nvariable and lead to interesting diversity: the encounter characteristics are\ndependent on the impact parameter, in contrast to the merger scenario; the\nnature of the compact star itself can produce very different outcomes; the\npresence of tidal tails in which material falls back onto the central object at\nlater times is a robust feature of these calculations, with the mass involved\nbeing larger than for binary mergers.

However, recent numerical simulations suggested\nthat the transition to this regime is accompanied by a sudden \"burst\" of\nacceleration.

This type of acceleration, the rarefaction\nacceleration, is specific to relativistic jets because their energy budget can\nstill be dominated by magnetic energy even in highly super-fast magnetosonic\nregime. Just like the collimation acceleration of externally confined\nmagnetized jets, it is connected with the geometry of magnetic flux sufaces.

For this purpose, we develop a semi-analytical model for the\ntime-dependent radiative output from internal shocks arising from colliding\nrelativistic shells in a blazar jet. The emission through synchrotron and\nsynchrotron-self Compton (SSC) radiation as well as Comptonization of an\nisotropic external radiation field are taken into account. We evaluate the\ndiscrete correlation function (DCF) of the model light curves in order to\nevaluate features of photon-energy dependent time lags and the quality of the\ncorrelation, represented by the peak value of the DCF. The almost completely\nanalytic nature of our approach allows us to study in detail the influence of\nvarious model parameters on the resulting spectral and timing features. This\npaper focuses on a range of parameters in which the gamma-ray production is\ndominated by Comptonization of external radiation, most likely appropriate for\ngamma-ray bright flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) or low-frequency peaked BL\nLac objects (LBLs).

We explore the\nrole for the ignition process of two different issues: firstly, the ignition is\nstudied in WD models coming from different accretion histories. Secondly, we\nestimate how a different reaction rate for C-burning can affect the ignition.\nTwo-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of temperature perturbations in the\nWD core (\"bubbles\") are performed with the FLASH code. In order to evaluate the\nimpact of the C-burning reaction rate on the WD model, the evolution code\nFLASH_THE_TORTOISE from Lesaffre et al. (2006) is used. In different WD models\na key role is played by the different gravitational acceleration in the\nprogenitor's core. As a consequence, the ignition is disfavored at a large\ndistance from the WD center in models with a larger central density, resulting\nfrom the evolution of initially more massive progenitors. Changes in the C\nreaction rate at T < 5e8 K slightly influence the ignition density in the WD\ncore, while the ignition temperature is almost unaffected.

First, we use a\nseries of unstratified simulations to calibrate physical dissipation as a\nfunction of resolution and background field strength; the effect of the\nmagnetic Prandtl number, Pm = viscosity/resistivity, on the turbulence is\ncaptured by ~32 grid zones per disk scale height, H. In agreement with previous\nresults, our stratified disk calculations are characterized by a subthermal,\npredominately toroidal magnetic field that produces MRI-driven turbulence for\n|z| < 2 H. Above |z| = 2 H, magnetic pressure dominates and the field is\nbuoyantly unstable. Large scale radial and toroidal fields are also generated\nnear the mid-plane and subsequently rise through the disk.

This paper describes the source extraction methods used to\ncreate the corresponding Science Demonstration Phase catalogue, which contains\n6876 sources, selected at 250 microns, within ~14 sq. degrees.

One of the\nappealing models is the late internal dissipation model, where X-ray emission\nduring the shallow-decay phase is attributed to internal dissipation, analogous\nto the prompt gamma-ray emission. We discuss possible scenarios of the late\nprompt emission, such as late internal shocks, magnetic reconnection, and\nphotospheric dissipation. We also consider the consequences of late dissipation\nand a two-component (early and late) jet model for the high-energy (GeV-TeV)\nemission. We study not only synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission from the\nearly and late jets but also external inverse-Compton (EIC) emission, which is\nnaturally predicted in the late dissipation model. For the latter, we perform\nnumerical calculations taking into account the equal-arrival-time surface of\nEIC photons and show that the EIC component typically has a peak at ~1-100 GeV\nwhich may dominate over the SSC components.

Concerning nonlinear models, the number of\ndegrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of\nreduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of\nreduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain.\nThis uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for\ndifferentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation\nprocedure.

It is timely to\nreinvestigate how it is calculated and to assess the various uncertainties\nwhich are likely to affect the accuracy of the predictions. The Galactic\ngamma-ray diffuse emission is mostly produced above a few GeV by the\ninteractions of cosmic ray primaries impinging on the interstellar material.\nThe theoretical error on that component is derived by exploring various\npotential sources of uncertainty. Particular attention is paid to cosmic ray\npropagation. Nuclear cross sections, the proton and helium fluxes at the Earth,\nthe Galactic radial profile of supernova remnants and the hydrogen distribution\ncan also severely affect the signal. The propagation of cosmic ray species\nthroughout the Galaxy is described in the framework of a semi-analytic two-zone\ndiffusion/convection model. This allows to convert the constraints set by the\nboron-to-carbon data into a theoretical uncertainty on the diffuse emission.\nNew deconvolutions of the HI and CO sky maps are also used to get the hydrogen\ndistribution within the Galaxy. The thickness of the cosmic ray diffusive halo\nis found to have a significant effect on the Galactic gamma-ray diffuse\nemission while the interplay between diffusion and convection has little\ninfluence on the signal.

The system is well sampled in radio, X-rays, and TeV\ngamma-rays, and shows orbital-phase-dependent variability in all observed\nfrequencies. Here we report on the discovery of >100 MeV gamma-rays from PSR\nB1259-63/LS 2883 through the 2010 pariastron passage. Using data collected with\nthe Large Area Telescope aboard Fermi from 33 days before pariastron to 75 days\nafter pariastron, PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 is detected at a significance of 13.6\nstandard deviations. The gamma-ray light curve is highly variable over the\nabove period, with changing photon index that correlates with gamma-ray flux.\nIn particular, two major flares that occur after the pariastron passage were\nobserved. The onset of gamma-ray emission occurs close to, but not at the same\norbital phases as, the two disk passages that occur ~1 month before and ~1\nmonth after the pariastron passage. The fact that the GeV orbital light curve\nis different from that of the X-ray and TeV light curves strongly suggests that\nGeV gamma-ray emission originates from a different component.

XDINSs), which are characterised by pure blackbody spectra\n(kT~40-100 eV), long X-ray pulsations (P=3-12 s), and appear to be endowed with\nrelatively high magnetic fields, (B~10d13-14 G). RBS 1774 is one of the few\nXDINSs with a candidate optical counterpart, which we discovered with the VLT.\nWe performed deep observations of RBS 1774 in the R band with the VLT to\ndisentangle a non-thermal power-law spectrum from a Rayleigh-Jeans, whose\ncontributions are expected to be very much different in the red part of the\nspectrum. We did not detect the RBS 1774 candidate counterpart down to a 3\nsigma limiting magnitude of R~27. The constraint on its colour, (B-R)<0.6,\nrules out that it is a background object, positionally coincident with the\nX-ray source. Our R-band upper limit is consistent with the extrapolation of\nthe B-band flux (assuming a 3 sigma uncertainty) for a set of power-laws F_nu\n~nu^alpha with spectral indeces alpha<0.07. If the optical spectrum of RBS 1774\nwere non-thermal, its power-law slope would be very much unlike those of all\nisolated neutron stars with non-thermal optical emission, suggesting that it is\nmost likely thermal. For instance, a Rayleigh-Jeans with temperature T_O = 11\neV, for an optically emitting radius r_O=15 km and a source distance d=150 pc,\nwould be consistent with the optical measurements. The implied low distance is\ncompatible with the 0.04 X-ray pulsed fraction if either the star spin axis is\nnearly aligned with the magnetic axis or with the line of sight, or it is\nslightly misaligned with respect to both the magnetic axis and the line of\nsight by 5-10 degrees \n\n"}

While galactic supernovae can be\nresolved with this technique, the supernova neutrino emission spectrum remains\nunconstrained and thus presents a limited potential for the topics related to\nsupernova core collapse models.\n  The paper elaborates analytically on the capabilities of IceCube to detect\nsupernovae through the analysis of hits in the detector correlated in space and\ntime. These arise from supernova neutrinos interacting in the instrumented\ndetector volume along single strings. Although the effective detection volume\nfor such coincidental hits is much smaller ($\\gtrsim 35\\,$kton, about the scale\nof SuperK), a wealth of information is obtained due to the comparatively low\ncoincidental noise rate. We demonstrate that a neutrino flux from a core\ncollapse supernova will produce a signature enabling the resolution of rough\nspectral features and, in the case of a strong signal, providing indication on\nits location.\n  We further discuss the enhanced potential of a rather modest detector\nextension, a denser array in the center of IceCube, within our one dimensional\nanalytic calculation framework.

Previous work on correcting the biases and estimating the variances\nfor these quantities typically includes restrictive assumptions about the\nsampling of the interferogram and/or about the relative importance of Poisson\nand Gaussian noise sources. Until now it has been difficult to accurately\ncompensate for systematic biases in data which violates these assumptions.

In this paper, we\npresent the first study of the persistent X-ray source Cygnus\\;X-1 that takes\ninto account of all available observational constraints. Our analysis accounts\nfor three evolutionary phases: orbital evolution and motion through the\nGalactic potential after the formation of black hole (BH), and binary orbital\ndynamics at the time of core collapse. We find that the mass of the BH\nimmediate progenitor is $15.0 - 20.0$ M$_\\sun$, and at the time of core\ncollapse, the BH has potentially received a small kick velocity of $\\le 77$ km\ns$^{-1}$ at 95% confidence. If the BH progenitor mass is less than $\\sim 17$\nM$_\\sun$, a non zero natal kick velocity is required to explain the currently\nobserved properties of Cygnus\\;X-1.

These phenomena bring the star to\nevolve in the quite different (opposite) ways and should be taken into account\nat once, as the gravitational compression is considered. Under the above\ntransition, which is expected to occur within any supermassive neutron star\n(NS), the hadronic-phase (HPh) vacuum - a coherent state of gluon- and chiral\n$q\\bar q$-condensates - turns, first near the star center, into the \"empty\"\n(perturbation) subhadronic-phase (SHPh) one and, thus, pre-existing (very high)\nvacuum pressure falls there down rather abruptly; as a result, the \"cold\" star\nstarts collapsing almost freely into the new vacuum. If the stellar mass is\nsufficiently large, then this implosion is shown to result in an enormous\nheating within the star central domain (up to a temperature about 100-200 MeV\nor, maybe, even higher), what makes the pressure from within to grow up,\npredominantly due to degeneracy breaking and multiple $q\\bar q$-pair\nproduction.

Abstract: We estimate the contribution to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB)\nfrom both intrinsic and cascade emissions produced by blazars using a simple\nsemi- analysis method for two models of the blazar gamma-ray luminosity\nfunction (GLF). For the cascade emission, we consider two possible\ncontributions: one is due to that the flux of the cascade emission is lower\nthan the Fermi LAT sensitivity (case I), which is independent on the\nextragalactic magnetic field (EGMF), another is due to the fact that the flux\nof the cascade emission is larger than the Fermi LAT sensitivity but the\nemission angle is larger than LAT point-spread-function (PSF) angle (case II),\nwhich depends on the EGMF. Our results indicate that (1) blazar contribution to\nthe EGRB is dominant although it depends on the GLF model and the EGMF; (2) the\nEGMF plays an important role in estimating the contribution from the cascade\nemission produced by blazars, the contribution from the cascade emission will\nsignificantly alter the EGRB spectrum when the strength of the EGMF is large\nenough (say BEGMF > 10-12 G); and (3) since the cascade emission in case II\nreaches a saturation when the strength of the EGMF is ? 10-11 G, it is very\npossible that the contribution from the cascade emission produced by blazars\ncan be considered as another method to probe the upper limit of the strength of\nthe EGMF. \n\n"}

In semi-analytic work on both problems it has been\nuseful to presume large scale symmetries, necessarily resulting in mean field\ntheories. MHD turbulence makes the underlying systems locally asymmetric and\nnonlinear. Synergy between theory and simulations should aim for the\ndevelopment of practical mean field models that capture essential physics and\ncan be used for observational modeling. Mean field dynamo (MFD) theory and\nalpha-viscosity accretion theory exemplify such ongoing pursuits. 21st century\nMFD theory has more nonlinear predictive power compared to 20th century MFD\ntheory, whereas accretion theory is still in a 20th century state. In fact,\ninsights from MFD theory are applicable to accretion theory and the two are\nartificially separated pieces of what should be a single theory. I discuss\npieces of progress that provide clues toward a unified theory. A key concept is\nthat large scale magnetic fields can be sustained via local or global magnetic\nhelicity fluxes or via relaxation of small scale magnetic fluctuations, without\nthe kinetic helicity driver of 20th century textbooks. These concepts may help\nexplain the formation of large scale fields that supply non-local angular\nmomentum transport via coronae and jets in a unified theory of accretion and\ndynamos.

The reason is in the divergent\nnature of amplification factors near fold caustics increasingly sensitive to\nsmall spatial size details. Higher-order disc images produced by strong light\nbending around the black hole may affect the amplification curves, making a\ncontribution of up to several percent near maximum amplification. In accordance\nwith theoretical predictions, some of the observed high-amplification events\npossess fine structure. Here we consider three putative caustic crossing\nevents, one by SBS1520+530 and two events for individual images of the\nEinstein's cross (QSO J2237+0305). Using relativistic disc models allows to\nimprove the fits, but the required inclinations are high, about 70deg or\nlarger. Such high inclinations apparently contradict the absence of any strong\nabsorption that is likely to arise if a disc is observed edge-on through a dust\ntorus. Still, the high inclinations are required only for the central parts of\nthe disc, that allows the disc itself to be initially tilted by 60-90deg with\nrespect to the black hole and aligned toward the black hole equatorial plane\nnear the last stable orbit radius. For SBS1520+530, an alternative explanation\nfor the observed amplification curve is a superposition of two subsequent fold\ncaustic crossings. While relativistic disc models favour black hole masses\n~10^10 solar (several times higher than the virial estimates) or small\nEddington ratios, this model is consistent with the observed distribution of\ngalaxies over peculiar velocities only if the black hole mass is about 3 10^8\nsolar. \n\n"}

Abstract: Recently, tentative evidence for an excess of gamma rays at energies around\n130 GeV has been reported from analyses of data from the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (LAT). The excess is potentially of great interest, as it could be\nassociated with the pair-annihilation of Galactic dark matter and the\nsubsequent production of monochromatic or internal bremsstrahlung gamma rays.\nThe 130 GeV excess appears when an optimized selection of the target region of\ninterest is employed, a procedure that depends upon the assumed dark matter\ndensity profile. For the profiles producing an appreciable signal, these target\nregions vastly overlap with the region corresponding to the so-called \"Fermi\nbubbles\". We argue that the tentative evidence for a line feature is likely due\nto hard photons in the Fermi bubbles regions, where the gamma-ray spectrum\ncontains a spectral break in the energy range of interest (100-150 GeV).\nAlthough the origin of this broken power-law is unclear, it is probably related\nto standard astrophysical processes and not to dark matter annihilation.

The normalized temperature profiles\n(normalized by the mean temperature T500) are found to be generally\nself-similar. The sample was subdivided in 5 cool-core (CC) and 7 non cool-core\n(NCC) clusters, by introducing a pseudo-entropy ratio\nsigma=(T_IN/T_OUT)X(EM_IN/EM_OUT)^-1/3 and defining the objects with sigma<0.6\nas CC clusters and those with sigma>=0.6 as NCC clusters. The profiles of CC\nand NCC clusters differ mainly in the central regions, with the latters\nexhibiting a marginally flatter central profile. A significant dependence of\nthe temperature profiles on the pseudo-entropy ratio sigma is detected by\nfitting a function of both r and sigma, showing an indication that the outer\npart of the profiles becomes steeper for higher values of sigma (i.e.\ntransitioning towards the NCC clusters). No significant evidence of redshift\nevolution could be found within the redshift range sampled by our clusters\n(0.4<z<0.9). A comparison of our high-z sample with intermediate clusters at\n0.1<z<0.3, showed how both the CC and NCC clusters temperature profiles have\nexperienced some sort of evolution. This can be due by the fact that higher z\nclusters are at less advanced stage of their formation and did not have enough\ntime to create a relaxed structure, characterized by a central temperature dip\nin CC clusters and by flatter profiles in NCC clusters. This is the first time\nthat a systematic study of the temperature profiles of galaxy clusters at z>0.4\nhas been attempted, as we were able to define the closest possible relation to\na Universal law for the temperature profiles of galaxy clusters at 0.1<z<0.9,\nshowing a dependence on both the state of relaxation of the clusters and the\nredshift. \n\n"}

This data set comprises 5337\nhours of observations recorded by an array of 84 polarized coherent receivers\nwith a total array sensitivity of 87 uK sqrt(s). Four low-foreground fields\nwere observed, covering a total of ~1000 square degrees with an effective\nangular resolution of 12.8', allowing for constraints on primordial\ngravitational waves and high-signal-to-noise measurements of the E-modes across\nthree acoustic peaks. The data reduction was performed using two independent\nanalysis pipelines, one based on a pseudo-Cl (PCL) cross-correlation approach,\nand the other on a maximum-likelihood (ML) approach. All data selection\ncriteria and filters were modified until a predefined set of null tests had\nbeen satisfied before inspecting any non-null power spectrum. The results\nderived by the two pipelines are in good agreement. We characterize the EE, EB\nand BB power spectra between l=25 and 975 and find that the EE spectrum is\nconsistent with LCDM, while the BB power spectrum is consistent with zero.\nBased on these measurements, we constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio to\nr=1.1+0.9-0.8 (r<2.8 at 95% C.L.) as derived by the ML pipeline, and\nr=1.2+0.9-0.8 (r<2.7 at 95% C.L.) as derived by the PCL pipeline.

We used verification\nbinaries, which are known as the guaranteed sources for eLISA and will test the\nfunctioning of the instrument. We find that of the seven parameters that\ncharacterise such a binary, only a few are correlated.

Muon\nenergy has traditionally been determined by measuring the specific energy loss\n(dE/dx) along the muon's path and relating the dE/dx to the muon energy.\nBecause high-energy muons (E_mu > 1 TeV) lose energy randomly, the spread in\ndE/dx values is quite large, leading to a typical energy resolution of 0.29 in\nlog10(E_mu) for a muon observed over a 1 km path length in the IceCube\ndetector. In this paper, we present an improved method that uses a truncated\nmean and other techniques to determine the muon energy. The muon track is\ndivided into separate segments with individual dE/dx values. The elimination of\nsegments with the highest dE/dx results in an overall dE/dx that is more\nclosely correlated to the muon energy. This method results in an energy\nresolution of 0.22 in log10(E_mu), which gives a 26% improvement.

As a by-product, we generate an integral theorem stating that\n\"the angular average of the potential of any circular sector along its tangent\ncircle is 2/PI times the value at the corner\".

The physical\nparameters of the model - proton injection rate, electron-to-proton ratio and\ndownstream magnetic field strength - are determined through a fit of the result\nto the observed spatially-integrated synchrotron emission properties. The only\nremaining unknown astronomical parameter, the circumstellar gas number density,\nis determined by a normalization of the amplitude of the gamma-ray flux to the\nobserved amplitude. The bipolar morphology of both nonthermal X-ray and\ngamma-ray emissions is explained by the preferential injection of suprathermal\nnuclei and subsequent magnetic field amplification in the quasi-parallel\nregions of the outer supernova shock. The above parameters provide an improved\nfit to all existing nonthermal emission data, including the TeV emission\nspectrum recently detected by H.E.S.S., with the circumstellar hydrogen gas\nnumber density $N_H\\approx 0.06 cm^{-3}$ close to values derived from\nobservations of thermal X-rays.

Notably, we extend past results by\nincluding important hadronization effects. Showering and hadronization produces\na high multiplicity of photons from the decays of hadrons, whose rate is not\nsuppressed by the fine structure constant. Notably, proton remnants that do not\nparticipate in hard scattering, can produce a large rate of photons in the\nforward direction. These effects significantly enhance the photon rate and\nalter the energy and angular distributions compared to previous results which\nused only parton level calculations.

{"id": "1210.3095", "contents": "Title: Outlook for detection of GW inspirals by GRB-triggered searches in the\n  Advanced detector era Abstract: Short, hard gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to originate from the\ncoalescence of two neutron stars (NSs) or a NS and a black hole (BH). If this\nscenario is correct, then short GRBs will be accompanied by the emission of\nstrong gravitational waves (GWs), detectable by GW observatories such as LIGO,\nVirgo, KAGRA, and LIGO-India. As compared with blind, all-sky, all-time GW\nsearches, externally triggered searches for GW counterparts to short GRBs have\nthe advantages of both significantly reduced detection threshold due to known\ntime and sky location and enhanced GW amplitude because of face-on orientation.\nBased on the distribution of signal-to-noise ratios in candidate compact binary\ncoalescence events in the most recent joint LIGO-Virgo data, our analytic\nestimates, and our Monte Carlo simulations, we find an effective sensitive\nvolume for GRB-triggered searches that is about 2 times greater than for an\nall-sky, all-time search. For NS-NS systems, a jet angle of 20 degrees, a\ngamma-ray satellite field of view of 10% of the sky, and priors with generally\nprecessing spin, this doubles the number of NS-NS short-GRB and NS-BH short-GRB\nassociations, to ~3-4% of all detections of NS-NSs and NS-BHs. We also\ninvestigate the power of tests for statistical excesses in lists of\nsubthreshold events, and show that these are unlikely to reveal a subthreshold\npopulation until finding GW associations to short GRBs is already routine.\nFinally, we provide useful formulas for calculating the prior distribution of\nGW amplitudes from a compact binary coalescence, for a given GW detector\nnetwork and given sky location. \n\n"}

Their particular strength lies in the multi-TeV to ultra high\nenergy range (E > 30 TeV), where large effective areas, yet small light\nsensitive areas per detector station are needed. To exploit this potential to\nfull extent, a large station spacing is required to achieve a large effective\narea at a reasonable effort. In such a detector, the low number of signals per\nevent, the absence of imaging information, and the poor signal to noise ratio\nof Cherenkov light to night sky brightness pose considerable challenges for the\nevent reconstruction, especially the gamma hadron separation. The event\nreconstruction presented in this paper has been developed for the wide-angle\ndetector HiSCORE, but the concepts may be applied more generically. It is\ntested on simulated data in the 10 TeV to 5 PeV energy range. For the tests, a\nregular grid of 22 x 22 detector stations with a spacing of 150 m is assumed,\ncovering an area of 10 km^2. The angular resolution of individual events is\nfound to be about 0.3 degree near the energy threshold, improving to below 0.1\ndegree at higher energies. The relative energy resolution is 20% at the\nthreshold and improves to 10% at higher energies. Several parameters for gamma\nhadron separation are described. With a combination of these parameters, 80% to\n90% of the hadronic background can be suppressed, while about 60% of the\ngamma-ray events are retained. The point source sensitivity to gamma-ray\nsources is estimated, with conservative assumptions, to be about 8 x 10^(-13)\nerg / s / cm^2 at 100 TeV gamma-ray for a 10 km^2 array. With more optimistic\nassumptions, and a 100 km^2 array, a sensitivity of about 1 x 10^(-13) erg / s\n/ cm^2 can be achieved (at 100 TeV). \n\n"}

The window function is the representation of\nthis beam in the harmonic domain which is required to recover an unbiased\nmeasurement of the CMB angular power spectrum. The HFI is a scanning instrument\nand its effective beams are the convolution of: (a) the optical response of the\ntelescope and feeds;(b)the processing of the time-ordered data and\ndeconvolution of the bolometric and electronic time response; and (c) the\nmerging of several surveys to produce maps. The time response functions are\nmeasured using observations of Jupiter and Saturn and by minimizing survey\ndifference residuals. The scanning beam is the post-deconvolution angular\nresponse of the instrument, and is characterized with observations of Mars. The\nmain beam solid angles are determined to better than 0.5% at each HFI frequency\nband. Observations of Jupiter and Saturn limit near sidelobes (within 5deg) to\nabout 0.1% of the total solid angle.

This hypothesis is\nmotivated by two characteristics found generically in simulations of binaries\nembedded in prograde accretion discs: (i) the formation of a central,\nlow-density cavity around the binary, and (ii) the leakage of gas into this\ncavity, occurring once per orbit via discrete streams on nearly radial\ntrajectories. The first feature would reduce the emergent optical/UV flux of\nthe system relative to active galactic nuclei powered by single SMBHs, while\nthe second can trigger quasiperiodic fluctuations in luminosity. I argue that\nthe quasiperiodic accretion signature may be much more dramatic than previously\nthought, because the infalling gas streams can strongly shock-heat via\nself-collision and tidal compression, thereby enhancing viscous accretion. Any\noptically thick gas that is circularized about either SMBH can accrete before\nthe next pair of streams is deposited, fueling transient, luminous flares that\nrecur every orbit. Due to the diminished flux in between accretion episodes,\nsuch cavity-accretion flares could plausibly be mistaken for the tidal\ndisruptions of stars in quiescent nuclei. The flares could be distinguished\nfrom tidal disruption events if their quasiperiodic recurrence is observed, or\nif they are produced by very massive SMBHs that cannot disrupt solar-type\nstars. They may be discovered serendipitously in surveys such as LSST or\neROSITA. I present a heuristic toy model as a proof of concept for the\nproduction of cavity-accretion flares, and generate mock light curves and\nspecta.

This paper shows that several properties of the Crab are best\nsuited to Type IIn-P explosions (Type IIn spectra with plateau light curves).\nThese events probably arise from relatively low-energy (1e50 erg) explosions\nwith low 56Ni yield resulting from electron-capture SNe (ecSNe), but their high\nluminosity and Type IIn spectra are dominated by shock interaction with CSM.\nAfter about 120 days, nearly all of the mass in the CSM and ejecta ends up in a\nslow dense shell. In the scenario proposed here for SN1054, this thin shell is\naccelerated by the growing pulsar wind nebula, producing the complex network of\nfilaments seen today.

IceCube, for example, observes about 50,000 well-reconstructed single\natmospheric neutrino events/year, with energies above 100 GeV. Although the\nneutrino detection probability is small, current detectors are large enough so\nthat it is possible to detect two neutrinos from the same cosmic-ray\ninteraction. In this paper, we calculate the expected rate of double-neutrino\ninteractions from a single cosmic-ray air shower. The rate is small, about 0.07\nevents/year for a 1 km$^3$ detector like IceCube, with only a small dependence\non the assumed cosmic-ray composition and hadronic interaction model. For a\nlarger detector, like the proposed KM3Net, the rate is about 0.8 events/year, a\nrate that should be easily observable. These double neutrino interactions are\nthe major irreducible background to searches of pairs of particles produced in\nsupersymmetric neutrino or cosmic-ray air-shower interactions.

This is generally\nderived employing a collisional MHD model. However, in the ICM the ion mean\nfree path between collisions is of the order of the dynamical scales, thus\nrequiring a collisionless MHD description. Unlike collisional MHD simulations,\nour study uses an anisotropic plasma pressure with respect to the direction of\nthe local magnetic field, which brings the plasma within a parameter space\nwhere collisionless instabilities should take place. Within the adopted model\nthese instabilities are contained at bay through the relaxation term of the\npressure anisotropy which simulates the feedback of the mirror and firehose\ninstabilities. This relaxation acts to get the plasma distribution function\nconsistent with the empirical studies of collisionless plasmas. Our 3D\nnumerical simulations of forced transonic turbulence motivated by modeling of\nthe turbulent ICM are performed for different initial values of the magnetic\nfield intensity, and different relaxation rates of the pressure anisotropy. We\nfound that in the high beta plasma regime corresponding to the ICM conditions,\na fast anisotropy relaxation rate gives results which are similar to the\ncollisional-MHD model as far as the statistical properties of the turbulence\nare concerned. Also, the amplification of seed magnetic fields due to the\nturbulent dynamo action is similar to the collisional-MHD model. Our\nsimulations that do not employ the anisotropy relaxation deviate significantly\nfrom the collisional-MHD results, and show more power at the small-scale\nfluctuations of both density and velocity representing the results of the\ninstabilities. For these simulations the large scale fluctuations in the\nmagnetic field are mostly suppressed and the turbulent dynamo fails in\namplifying seed magnetic fields. \n\n"}

We\nobtain a large class of exact solutions, which are in general time-dependent\nand non-axisymmetric. These solutions include waves that, surprisingly,\npropagate without scattering on the curvature of the black hole's background.\nThey may be understood as generalizations to Robinson's solutions to vacuum\nelectrodynamics associated with a shear-free congruence of null geodesics. When\nstationary and axisymmetric, our solutions reduce to those of Menon and Dermer,\nthe only previously known solutions in Kerr. In Kerr, all of our solutions have\nnull electromagnetic fields ($\\vec{E} \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0$ and $E^2=B^2$).\nHowever, in Schwarzschild or flat spacetime there is freedom to add a magnetic\nmonopole field, making the solutions magnetically dominated ($B^2>E^2$).

Collisions between these clumps reduce their angular\nmomentum, and as a result some of the clumps are set on a plunging trajectory.\nConstraints can be imposed on the nature of past accretion events based on the\ncurrently observed X-ray reflection from the molecular clouds. We discuss\naccretion of clouds in the context of enhanced activity of Sgr A* during the\npast few hundred years. We put forward a scenario according to which gas clouds\nbring material close to the horizon of the black hole on <~0.1 parsec scale. We\nhave modelled the source intrinsic luminosity assuming that multiple events\noccur at various moments in time. These events are characterized by the amount\nof accreted material and the distribution of angular momentum. We parameterized\nthe activity in the form of a sequence of discrete events, followed the viscous\nevolution, and calculated the luminosity of the system from the time-dependent\naccretion rate across the inner boundary. Accreting clumps settle near a\ncircularization radius, spread there during the viscous time, and subsequently\nfeed the black hole over a certain period. A significant enhancement (by factor\nof ten) of the luminosity is only expected if the viscous timescale of the\ninflow is very short.

Second, in selecting between a set of competing models\nthe necessary estimation of the Bayesian evidence for each is, by definition, a\n(possibly high-dimensional) integration over the entire parameter space; again\nthis can be a daunting computational task, although new Monte Carlo (MC)\nintegration algorithms offer solutions of ever increasing efficiency.

Even though one\nmight expect a background composed of a high-redshift cosmological population\nof sources to be fairly isotropic, deviations from isotropy may be indicative\nof local GW hotspots or some form of continuous anisotropy in the\nangular-distribution of GW-power. A GWB induces time-of-arrival deviations in\npulsar signals which are correlated between separated pulsars.

Especially from directions\nclose to the Galactic Plane, the expected gamma-ray spectrum is altered via two\neffects: directly, by the photons emitted in the bremsstrahlung process on the\ninterstellar gas by energetic electrons which are among the DM annihilation\nbyproducts; indirectly, by the modification of the same electron spectrum, due\nto the additional energy loss process in the diffusion-loss equation (e.g. the\nresulting inverse Compton emission is altered). We quantify the importance of\nthe bremsstrahlung emission in the GeV energy range, showing that it is the\ndominant component of the gamma-ray spectrum for some cases.

This includes limits upon the\nspectrum and anisotropy of the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB),\nredshift distribution of nearby Fermi active galactic nuclei (AGN), and the\nconstruction of a log(N)-log(S) relation. Based upon these, it has been argued\nthat the evolution of the gamma-ray bright blazar population must be much less\ndramatic than that of other AGN. However, critical to such claims is the\nassumption that inverse Compton cascades reprocess emission above a TeV into\nthe Fermi energy range, substantially enhancing the strength of the observed\nlimits.

After\nsaturation of the MRI, in many cases the disk maintains a steady vertical\nstructure for many thermal times. However, in every case in which the box size\nin the horizontal directions is at least one pressure scale height,\nfluctuations associated with MRI turbulence and dynamo action in the disk\neventually trigger a thermal runaway which causes the disk to either expand or\ncontract until the calculation must be terminated. During runaway, the\ndependence of the heating and cooling rates on total pressure satisfy the\nsimplest criterion for classical thermal instability. We identify several\nphysical reasons why the thermal runaway observed in our simulations differ\nfrom the standard alpha disk model, for example the advection of radiation\ncontributes a non-negligible fraction to the vertical energy flux at the\nlargest radiation pressure, most of the dissipation does not happen in the disk\nmid-plane, and the change of dissipation scale height with mid-plane pressure\nis slower than the change of density scale height.

When\nsupermassive black holes are active, the activity provides a probe of the state\nof the black hole system. The spin of a hole can be estimated when the black\nhole mass and beam power of the source are known for sources with powerful\noutflows. Seventy-five sources for which both the black hole mass and beam\npower could be obtained are identified and used to obtain estimates of black\nhole spins. The 75 supermassive black holes studied include 52 FRII radio\ngalaxies and 23 FRII radio loud quasars with redshifts ranging from about zero\nto two. The new values are combined with those obtained previously for 19 FRII\nradio galaxies, 7 FRII radio loud quasars, and 29 radio sources associated with\nCD galaxies to form samples of 71 FRII radio galaxies, 30 FRII quasars, and a\ntotal sample of 130 spin values; all of the sources are associated with massive\nelliptical galaxies. The new values obtained are similar to those obtained\nearlier at similar redshift, and range from about 0.1 to 1 for FRII sources.\nThe overall results are consistent with those obtained previously: the spins\ntend to decrease with decreasing redshift for the FRII sources studied. There\nis a hint that the range of values of black hole spin at a given redshift is\nlarger for FRII quasars than for FRII radio galaxies. There is no indication of\na strong correlation between supermassive black hole mass and spin for the\nsupermassive black holes studied here.

For the time domain, the extent to which radio and visible wavelength\nobservations are required to understand several classes of transients was\nstressed, but there are also classes of radio transients for which no visible\nwavelength counterpart is yet known, providing an opportunity for discovery.\nFrom the LSST perspective, the LSST is expected to generate as many as 1\nmillion alerts nightly, which will require even more selective specification\nand identification of the classes and characteristics of transients that can\nwarrant follow up, at radio or any wavelength. The LSST will also conduct a\ndeep survey of the sky, producing a catalog expected to contain over 38 billion\nobjects in it.

The\nmechanism powering such events is thought to be linked to tapping of the\nangular momentum (spin) of the black hole, the rate of accretion through the\ndisc or some combination of the two. We can attempt to discriminate between\nthese possibilities by comparing proxies for jet power with spin estimates. Due\nto the small number of sources reaching Eddington rates and have therefore been\nsuggested to act as 'standard candles', there has been much recent debate as to\nwhether a significant correlation exists between jet power and spin. We perform\ncontinuum fitting to the high-quality, disc-dominated XMM-Newton spectra of the\nextragalactic microquasar discovered in M31. Assuming prograde spin, we find\nthat, for sensible constraints the spin is always very low (a < 0.15 at\n3-sigma). When combined with a proxy for jet power derived from the maximum 5\nGHz radio luminosity during a bright flaring event, we find that the source\nsits well above the previously reported, rising correlation that would indicate\nthat spin tapping is the dominant mechanism for powering the jets. The notable\nexceptions require the inclination to be improbably small or the jet to be very\nfast. We investigate whether this could be a by-product of selecting\nprograde-only spin, finding that the data statistically favour a substantially\nretrograde spin for the same constraints (a < -0.17 at 3-sigma). Although\ntheoretically improbable, this remarkable finding could be confirmation that\nretrograde spin can power such jets via spin-tapping, as has been suggested for\ncertain radio quasars. In either case this work demonstrates the value of\nstudying local extragalactic microquasars as a means to better understand the\nphysics of jet launching. \n\n"}

MAGIC observed FSRQ PKS 1510-089 in February-April 2012 during a high\nactivity state in the high energy (HE, E>100 MeV) gamma-ray band observed by\nAGILE and Fermi. MAGIC observations result in the detection of a source with\nsignificance of 6.0 sigma. In agreement with the previous VHE observations of\nthe source, we find no statistically significant variability during the MAGIC\nobservations in daily, weekly or monthly time scales. The other two known VHE\nFSRQs have shown daily scale to sub-hour variability.\n  We study the multifrequency behaviour of the source at the epoch of MAGIC\nobservation, collecting quasi-simultaneous data at radio and optical (GASP-WEBT\nand F-Gamma collaborations, REM, Steward, Perkins, Liverpool, OVRO and VLBA\ntelescopes), X-ray (Swift satellite) and HE gamma-ray frequencies. The\ngamma-ray SED combining AGILE, Fermi and MAGIC data joins smoothly and shows no\nhint of a break. The multifrequency light curves suggest a common origin for\nthe millimeter radio and HE gamma-ray emission and the HE gamma-ray flaring\nstarts when the new component is ejected from the 43GHz VLBA core. The\nquasi-simultaneous multifrequency SED is modelled with a one-zone inverse\nCompton model. We study two different origins of the seed photons for the\ninverse Compton scattering, namely the infra-red torus and a slow sheath\nsurrounding the jet around the VLBA core. Both models fit the data well.\nHowever, the fast HE gamma-ray variability requires that within the modelled\nlarge emitting region, there must exist more compact regions. We suggest that\nthese observed signatures would be most naturally explained by a turbulent\nplasma flowing at a relativistic speed down the jet and crossing a standing\nconical shock. \n\n"}

We\npresent a picture in which the population of AGN can be divided into two\ndistinct populations. The Radiative-Mode AGN are associated with black holes\nthat produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of ~1% of\nthe Eddington Limit. They are primarily associated with less massive black\nholes growing in high-density pseudo-bulges at a rate sufficient to produce the\ntotal mass budget in these black holes in ~10 Gyr. The circum-nuclear\nenvironment contains high density cold gas and associated star-formation. Major\nmergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular\nprocesses appear dominant. Stellar feedback will be generic in these objects\nand strong AGN feedback is seen only in the most powerful AGN. In Jet-Mode AGN\nthe bulk of energetic output takes the form of collimated outflows (jets).\nThese AGN are associated with the more massive black holes in more massive\n(classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies.

We\nintroduce the method of a linear search grid to analyse GRB events with large\nsky localisation uncertainties such as the localisations provided by the Fermi\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM).

In this work we take a\ncompletely different approach and study the propagation of charged particles in\nthe heliosphere assuming only the presence of the regular magnetic field, and\ncompletely neglecting the random component. Assuming that the field is purely\nmagnetic in the wind frame, one can deduce the existence of a large scale\nelectric field, that results in important energy losses for charged particles\nthat traverse the heliosphere and reach the Earth. The energy loss (Delta E)\ndue to the large scale regular electric field depends on the particle electric\ncharge, is proportional to the absolute value of the electric charge, and to a\ngood approximation is independent from the particle energy and direction. We\nspeculate that this deterministic energy loss is an important, or perhaps even\nthe leading contribution to the solar modulation effects. \n\n"}

The array consists of 5 telescopes in a square layout with one central\ntelescope, known as the Pevatron eXplorer or PeX. PeX is a PeV (10^{15} eV)\ncosmic ray explorer that aims to study and discover gamma-ray sources in the 1\nto 500 TeV range. The initial PeX design has been influenced by the HEGRA\nCT-System and H.E.S.S. configurations. One important feature of multi-TeV air\nshowers is their ability to trigger telescopes at large core distance (>400m).\nPeX will utilise large core distance events to improve the performance and\nillustrate the viability of a sparse array for multi-TeV gamma-ray astronomy.\n  One important aspect of the thesis (Chapter 6) was the investigation of a new\ntime-based image cleaning method. The arrival time between photons in two\nadjacent pixels in the camera is used to apply an extra cut which helps\nmitigate night sky background. To illustrate the robustness of the time\ncleaning cut, various level of night sky background have been considered. These\nlevels include: off-Galactic plane, on-Galactic plane and towards the Galactic\ncentre. The most important result is that PeX performance with a time cleaning\ncut improves results when a high level of night sky background is present. For\na Galactic centre level of night sky background there is a factor of 1.5\nimprovement in angular resolution, effective area and quality factor when a\ntime cleaning cut is applied compared to using no time cleaning cut. \n\n"}

The interaction\nwith the radiation field is assumed to be Thomson-like, i.e., the particles\nabsorb and re-emit radiation, thus suffering for a friction-like drag force.\nSuch an additional force is responsible for the Poynting-Robertson effect,\nwhich is well established in the framework of Newtonian gravity and has been\nrecently extended to the general theory of relativity. The balance between\ngravitational attraction, centrifugal force and radiation drag leads to the\noccurrence of equilibrium circular orbits which are attractors for the\nsurrounding matter for every fixed value of the interaction strength. The\npresence of the quadrupolar structure of the source introduces a further degree\nof freedom: there exists a whole family of equilibrium orbits parametrized by\nthe quadrupole parameter, generalizing previous works.

We briefly discuss the data\nand search algorithm used to find this event in the first year of DES\noperations, and outline the spectroscopic data obtained from the European\nSouthern Observatory (ESO) Very Large Telescope to confirm its redshift (z =\n0.663 +/- 0.001 based on the host-galaxy emission lines) and likely spectral\ntype (type I). Using this redshift, we find M_U_peak = -21.05 +0.10 -0.09 for\nthe peak, rest-frame U-band absolute magnitude, and find DES13S2cmm to be\nlocated in a faint, low metallicity (sub-solar), low stellar-mass host galaxy\n(log(M/M_sun) = 9.3 +/- 0.3); consistent with what is seen for other SLSNe-I.\nWe compare the bolometric light curve of DES13S2cmm to fourteen similarly\nwell-observed SLSNe-I in the literature and find it possesses one of the\nslowest declining tails (beyond +30 days rest frame past peak), and is the\nfaintest at peak. Moreover, we find the bolometric light curves of all SLSNe-I\nstudied herein possess a dispersion of only 0.2-0.3 magnitudes between +25 and\n+30 days after peak (rest frame) depending on redshift range studied; this\ncould be important for 'standardising' such supernovae, as is done with the\nmore common type Ia.

The binaries that manage to lose\nmost of their angular momentum can coalesce to form a single remnant. In the\nlast stages of this process, the holes undergo an extremely loud phase of\ngravitational wave emission, possibly detectable by current and future probes.\nThe theoretical effort towards obtaining a coherent physical picture of the\nbinary path down to coalescence is still underway. In this paper, for the first\ntime, we take advantage of observational studies of active galactic nuclei\nevolution to constrain the efficiency of gas-driven binary decay. Under\nconservative assumptions we find that gas accretion toward the nuclear black\nholes can efficiently lead binaries of any mass forming at high redshift (> 2)\nto coalescence within the current time. The observed \"downsizing\" trend of the\naccreting black hole luminosity function further implies that the gas inflow is\nsufficient to drive light black holes down to coalescence, even if they bind in\nbinaries at lower redshifts, down to z~0.5 for binaries of ~10 million solar\nmasses, and z~0.2 for binaries of ~1 million solar masses.

A\ndetailed study of several calorimetric detectors suggests that a mismatch\nbetween the sensor and signal bandwidths is the primary reason for suppressed\nsensitivity. With this understanding, we propose a detector design in which a\nthin-film Au pad is directly deposited onto a massive absorber that is then\nthermally linked to a separately fabricated TES chip via an Au wirebond,\nproviding large electron-phonon coupling (i.e. high signal bandwidth), ease of\nfabrication, and cosmogenic background suppression.

We use the MultiNest sampling\nalgorithm with 1.2 x 10^9 points to sample the pMSSM10 parameter space. A\ndedicated study shows that the sensitivities to strongly-interacting SUSY\nmasses of ATLAS and CMS searches for jets, leptons + MET signals depend only\nweakly on many of the other pMSSM10 parameters. With the aid of the Atom and\nScorpion codes, we also implement the LHC searches for EW-interacting\nsparticles and light stops, so as to confront the pMSSM10 parameter space with\nall relevant SUSY searches.

The current experiments combine two different techniques, an array\nof surface detectors and fluorescence telescopes. The latter allow an almost\ncalorimetric measurement of the primary energy. Thus, hadron-initiated showers\ndetected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator\nfrom the surface array (usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance\nfrom the shower core S(r0)) with the primary energy. On the other hand, this\ncalibration is not feasible when searching for photon primaries since no high\nenergy photon has been unambiguously detected so far. Therefore, pure Monte\nCarlo parametrizations are used instead.\n  In this work, we present a new method to determine the primary energy of\nhadron-induced showers in a hybrid experiment based on a technique previously\ndeveloped for photon primaries. It consists on a set of calibration curves that\nrelate the surface energy estimator, S(r0), and the depth of maximum\ndevelopment of the shower, Xmax, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes.\nThen, the primary energy can be determined from pure surface information since\nS(r0) and the zenith angle of the incoming shower are only needed. Considering\na mixed sample of ultra-high energy proton and iron primaries and taking into\naccount the reconstruction uncertainties and shower to shower fluctuations, we\ndemonstrate that the primary energy may be determined with a systematic\nuncertainty below 1% and resolution around 16% in the energy range from\n10^{18.5} to 10^{19.6} eV.

The objective of the present study is to directly compare\nthe analysis of strong gravitational lens systems using different lens model\nsoftware and similarly parameterized models to understand the differences and\nlimitations of the resulting models.

All four lens systems were modeled with PixeLens, Lenstool, glafic,\nand Lensmodel. The input data and parameterization of each lens model was\nsimilar for the four model programs used to highlight differences in the output\nresults. The calculation of the Einstein radius and enclosed mass for each lens\nmodel was comparable. The results were more dissimilar if the masses of more\nthan one lens potential were free-parameters.

The progenitor is a tight binary composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) core\nand a neutron star (NS) companion, a subclass of the newly proposed\n\"ultra-stripped\" binaries. The CO-NS short-period orbit causes the NS to\naccrete appriciable matter from the SN ejecta when the CO core collapses,\nultimately causing it to collapse to a black hole (BH) and producing a GRB.\nThese tight binaries evolve through the SN explosion very differently than\ncompact binaries studied in population synthesis calculations. First, the\nhypercritical accretion onto the NS companion alters both the mass and momentum\nof the binary. Second, because the explosion timescale is on par with the\norbital period, the mass ejection can not be assumed to be instantaneous. This\ndramatically affects the post-SN fate of the binary. Finally, the bow shock\ncreated as the accreting NS plows through the SN ejecta transfers angular\nmomentum, braking the orbit. These systems remain bound even if a large\nfraction of the binary mass is lost in the explosion (well above the canonical\n50\\% limit), and even large kicks are unlikely to unbind the system. Indeed,\nBdHNe produce a new family of NS-BH binaries unaccounted for in current\npopulation synthesis analyses and, although they may be rare, the fact that\nnearly 100\\% remain bound implies they may play an important role in the\ncompact merger rate, important for gravitational waves (GWs) that, in turn, can\nproduce a new class of ultrashort GRBs. \n\n"}

We investigate the evolution of three\ndifferent initial disk models with a range of initial black hole spin\nmagnitudes and tilt angles. For all the disk-to-black hole mass ratios\nconsidered (0.044-0.16) we observe significant black hole precession and\nnutation during the evolution. This indicates that for such mass ratios,\nneglecting the self-gravity of the disks by evolving them in a fixed background\nblack hole spacetime is not justified. We find that the two more massive models\nare unstable against the Papaloizou-Pringle (PP) instability and that those\nPP-unstable models remain unstable for all initial spins and tilt angles\nconsidered, showing that the development of the instability is a very robust\nfeature of such PP-unstable disks. Our lightest model, which is the most\nastrophysically favorable outcome of mergers of binary compact objects, is\nstable. The tilt between the black hole spin and the disk is strongly modulated\nduring the growth of the PP instability, causing a partial global realignment\nof black hole spin and disk angular momentum in the most massive model with\nconstant specific angular momentum l. For the model with non-constant l-profile\nwe observe a long-lived m=1 non-axisymmetric structure which shows strong\noscillations of the tilt angle in the inner regions of the disk. This effect\nmight be connected to the development of Kozai-Lidov oscillations. Our\nsimulations also confirm earlier findings that the development of the PP\ninstability causes the long-term emission of large amplitude gravitational\nwaves, predominantly for the l=m=2 multipole mode. The imprint of the BH\nprecession on the gravitational waves from tilted BH-torus systems remains an\ninteresting open issue that would require significantly longer simulations than\nthose presented in this work. \n\n"}

Abstract: We study the complex structure of the Bullet cluster radio halo to determine\nthe Dark Matter (DM) contribution to the emission observed in the different\nsubhalos corresponding to the DM and baryonic dominated regions. We use\ndifferent non-thermal models to study the different regions, and we compare our\nresults with the available observations in the radio, X-ray and gamma-ray\nbands, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect data.

In this scenario there are however some open\nissues, like the difficulty to explain the observed flux at 8.8 GHz, the high\nvalue of the required annihilation cross section, and the lack of observed\nemission coming from the minor DM subhalo.

In some cases the\nburning ashes may rise from the burning depths up to the NS photosphere by\nconvection, leading to the appearance of the metal absorption edges in the\nspectra, which then force the emergent X-ray burst spectra to shift toward\nlower energies. These effects may have a substantial impact on the color\ncorrection factor $f_c$ and the dilution factor $w$, the parameters of the\ndiluted blackbody model $F_E \\approx w B_E(f_c T_{eff})$ that is commonly used\nto describe the emergent spectra from NSs. The aim of this paper is to quantify\nhow much the metal enrichment can change these factors. We have developed a new\nNS atmosphere modeling code, which has a few important improvements compared to\nour previous code required by inclusion of the metals. The opacities and the\ninternal partition functions (used in the ionization fraction calculations) are\nnow taken into account for all atomic species.

This\nstrategy has the beneficial property of reducing the number of telescope\npointings by a factor 10 to 100 compared with tiling the entire error box.\nAdditional galaxy count reduction will come from a GW rapid distance estimate\nwhich will restrict the radial slice in search volume.

Events can be analysed either monoscopically (i.e. using\nonly information of CT5) or stereoscopically (requiring at least two triggered\ntelescopes per event). To achieve a good performance, a sophisticated event\nreconstruction and analysis framework is indispensable.

Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are\nsufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using\nonly the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,\norder-of-magnitude errors. \n\n"}

We find that gaps in the\nlight curve appear when material misses the accretion radius on its first\nreturn to pericentre. Subsequent recurrences can be decomposed into\n\"continuous\" and \"delayed\" components, which exhibit different behaviour. We\nfind that this potential can substantially alter the locations of stream\nself-intersections. When debris is confined to the plane, we find that close\nencounters with the secondary BH leave noticeable signatures on the fallback\nrate and can result in significant accretion onto the secondary BH. Tight,\nequal-mass MBHBs accrete equally, periodically trading the infalling stream. \n\n"}

Observations reveal a point-like source\naligned with elongated diffuse emission. The X-ray spectra are best-fitted by\nabsorbed power laws with photon indices ~1.7 for the point-like and ~2.0 for\nthe extended one. Both sources show nonthermal radio-continuum counterparts\nthat might indicate a physical association. From the available data, we did not\ndetect variability on the point-like source in several timescales. Two possible\nscenarios are analyzed: first, based on HI line absorption, assuming a Galactic\norigin, we infer a distance upper bound of <2 kpc, which poses a constraint on\nthe height over the Galactic plane of <200 pc and on the linear size of the\nsystem of <2.3 pc. In this case, the X-ray luminosities are >10^32 erg/s and\n>7.5 x 10^32 erg/s, for the point-like and extended sources, respectively;\nsecond, an extra-Galactic nature is discussed, where the point-like source\nmight be the core of a radio galaxy and the extended source its lobe. In this\ncase, we compare derived fluxes, spectral indices, and spatial correlation with\nthose typical from the radio galaxy population, showing the feasibility of this\nalternative astrophysical scenario. From the available observational evidence,\nwe suggest that the most promising scenario to explain the nature of these\nsources is a system consisting of a one-sided radio galaxy, where the\npoint-like source is an active galactic nucleus and the extended source\ncorresponds to the emission from its lobe.

In this\nwork, we calculate the electron neutrino/anti-neutrino spectra of NDAFs by\nfully taking into account the general relativistic effects, and investigate the\neffects of viewing angle, BH spin, and mass accretion rate on the results. We\nshow that even though a typical NDAF has a neutrino luminosity lower than that\nof a typical supernova (SN), it can reach $10^{50}-10^{51}~{\\rm erg~s^{-1}}$\npeaking at $\\sim 10$ MeV, making them potentially detectable with the upcoming\nsensitive MeV neutrino detectors if they are close enough to Earth. Based on\nthe observed GRB event rate in the local universe and requiring that at least 3\nneutrinos are detected to claim a detection, we estimate a detection rate up to\n$\\sim$ (0.10-0.25) per century for GRB-related NDAFs by the Hyper-Kamiokande\n(Hyper-K) detector if one neglects neutrino oscillation.

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a\nVery Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) network with a goal of imaging nearby\nsupermassive black holes (in particular Sgr A* and M87) with angular resolution\nsufficient to observe strong gravity effects near the event horizon. General\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations show that radio emission\nfrom Sgr A* exhibits vari- ability on timescales of minutes, much shorter than\nthe duration of a typical VLBI imaging experiment, which usually takes several\nhours. A changing source structure during the observations, however, violates\none of the basic assumptions needed for aperture synthesis in radio\ninterferometry imaging to work.

Spectroscopic observations, especially in the\nX-ray band, show that such accretion disk winds may be common in local AGN and\nquasars. However, their origin and characteristics are still not fully\nunderstood. Detailed theoretical models and simulations focused on radiation,\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) or a combination of these two processes to\ninvestigate the possible acceleration mechanisms and the dynamics of these\nwinds.

As the bound gas becomes virialized with the\nbinary, the luminosity of the system increases slowly at approximately constant\nphotosphere radius, causing the temperature to rise. Subsequent evolution\ndepends on the efficiency of radiative cooling. If the bound atmosphere is able\nto cool efficiently, as quantified by radiative diffusion time being shorter\nthan the advection time (t_diff/t_adv < 1), then the virialized gas collapses\nto an excretion disk, while for t_diff/t_adv > 1 an isotropic wind is formed.\nBetween these two extremes, an inflated envelope transports the heat generated\nnear the binary to the surface by meridional flows.

Astrophysics is no exception since an overwhelming amount of\nmultivariate data has appeared in the last twenty years or so. In particular,\nthe diversification of galaxies throughout the evolution of the Universe quite\nnaturally invokes phylogenetic approaches. We have demonstrated that Maximum\nParsimony brings useful astrophysical results, and we now proceed toward the\nanalyses of large datasets for galaxies. In this talk I present how we solve\nthe major difficulties for this goal: the choice of the parameters, their\ndiscretization, and the analysis of a high number of objects with an\nunsupervised NP-hard classification technique like cladistics. 1. Introduction\nHow do the galaxy form, and when? How did the galaxy evolve and transform\nthemselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to\npresent-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout\nthe Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between\nthese, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract\nsome digestible information from the complexity of these systems. This is\nclassification. One century ago, galaxies were discovered by Hubble. From\nimages obtained in the visible range of wavelengths, he synthetised his\nobservations through the usual process: classification. With only one parameter\n(the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four\ncategories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the\nfamous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these\nclasses, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been\nrefined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global\nclassification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by\nHubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used\nto represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the\nHubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012). Its success is impressive and can\nbe understood by its simplicity, even its beauty, and by the many correlations\nfound between the morphology of galaxies and their other properties. And one\nmust admit that there is no alternative up to now, even though both the Hubble\nclassification and diagram have been recognised to be unsatisfactory. Among the\nmost obvious flaws of this classification, one must mention its monovariate,\nqualitative, subjective and old-fashioned nature, as well as the difficulty to\ncharacterise the morphology of distant galaxies. The first two most significant\nmultivariate studies were by Watanabe et al. (1985) and Whitmore (1984). Since\nthe year 2005, the number of studies attempting to go beyond the Hubble\nclassification has increased largely. Why, despite of this, the Hubble\nclassification and its sequence are still alive and no alternative have yet\nemerged (Sandage, 2005)? My feeling is that the results of the multivariate\nanalyses are not easily integrated into a one-century old practice of modeling\nthe observations. In addition, extragalactic objects like galaxies, stellar\nclusters or stars do evolve. Astronomy now provides data on very distant\nobjects, raising the question of the relationships between those and our\npresent day nearby galaxies. Clearly, this is a phylogenetic problem.\nAstrocladistics 1 aims at exploring the use of phylogenetic tools in\nastrophysics (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2006a,b). We have proved that Maximum\nParsimony (or cladistics) can be applied in astrophysics and provides a new\nexploration tool of the data (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2009, 2012, Cardone \\&\nFraix-Burnet, 2013).

We use\ncoevolved populations of MBH and galaxies from hydrodynamic, cosmological\nsimulations ('Illustris') to calculate a predicted GWB.

We focus on three main classes of systematics: (i) experimental\nsystematic errors in the observed shear; (ii) signal contamination by intrinsic\nalignments; and (iii) systematic effects due to an incorrect modelling of\nnon-linear scales. First, we show that a comprehensive, multi-wavelength\nanalysis provides a self-calibration method for experimental systematic\neffects, only implying <50% increment on the errors on cosmological parameters.\nWe also illustrate how the cross-correlation between radio and optical/near-IR\nsurveys alone is able to remove residual systematics with variance as large as\n0.00001, i.e. the same order of magnitude of the cosmological signal. This also\nopens the possibility of using such a cross-correlation as a means to detect\nunknown experimental systematics. Secondly, we demonstrate that, thanks to\npolarisation information, radio weak lensing surveys will be able to mitigate\ncontamination by intrinsic alignments, in a way similar but fully complementary\nto available self-calibration methods based on position-shear correlations.\nLastly, we illustrate how radio weak lensing experiments, reaching higher\nredshifts than those accessible to optical surveys, will probe dark energy and\nthe growth of cosmic structures in regimes less contaminated by non-linearities\nin the matter perturbations.

Abstract: In Keplerian accretion disks, turbulence and magnetic fields may be jointly\nexcited through a subcritical dynamo process involving the magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI). High-resolution simulations exhibit a tendency towards\nstatistical self-organization of MRI dynamo turbulence into large-scale cyclic\ndynamics. Understanding the physical origin of these structures, and whether\nthey can be sustained and transport angular momentum efficiently in\nastrophysical conditions, represents a significant theoretical challenge. The\ndiscovery of simple periodic nonlinear MRI dynamo solutions has recently proven\nuseful in this respect, and has notably served to highlight the role of\nturbulent magnetic diffusion in the seeming decay of the dynamics at low\nmagnetic Prandtl number Pm (magnetic diffusivity larger than viscosity), a\ncommon regime in accretion disks. The connection between these simple\nstructures and the statistical organization reported in turbulent simulations\nremained elusive, though. Here, we report the numerical discovery in moderate\naspect ratio Keplerian shearing boxes of new periodic, incompressible,\nthree-dimensional nonlinear MRI dynamo solutions with a larger dynamical\ncomplexity reminiscent of such simulations. These \"chimera\" cycles are\ncharacterized by multiple MRI-unstable dynamical stages, but their basic\nphysical principles of self-sustainment are nevertheless identical to those of\nsimpler cycles found in azimuthally elongated boxes. In particular, we find\nthat they are not sustained at low Pm either due to subcritical turbulent\nmagnetic diffusion. These solutions offer a new perspective into the transition\nfrom laminar to turbulent instability-driven dynamos, and may prove useful to\ndevise improved statistical models of turbulent accretion disk dynamos. \n\n"}

GW emission in the\npre-explosion phase strongly depends on whether the post-shock flow is\ndominated by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or convection and\ndiffers considerably from 2D models. SASI activity produces a strong signal\ncomponent below 250 Hz through asymmetric mass motions in the gain layer and a\nnon-resonant coupling to the proto-neutron star (PNS). Both convection- and\nSASI-dominated models show GW emission above 250 Hz, but with considerably\nlower amplitudes than in 2D. This is due to a different excitation mechanism\nfor high-frequency l=2 motions in the PNS surface, which are predominantly\nexcited by PNS convection in 3D. Resonant excitation of high-frequency surface\ng-modes in 3D by mass motions in the gain layer is suppressed compared to 2D\nbecause of smaller downflow velocities and a lack of high-frequency variability\nin the downflows. In the exploding 20 Msun model, shock revival results in\nenhanced low-frequency emission due to a change of the preferred scale of the\nconvective eddies in the PNS convection zone. Estimates of the expected excess\npower in two frequency bands suggests that second-generation detectors will\nonly be able to detect very nearby events, but that third-generation detectors\ncould distinguish SASI- and convection-dominated models at distances of ~10\nkpc. \n\n"}

For gamma rays with\nenergy E > 300 TeV the attenuation is mostly due to the photons of the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background Radiation (CMBR).

Our study of\nphase resolved energy spectra of these oscillations in 4U 1636-53 shows that\nthe oscillations are not caused by variations in the blackbody temperature of\nthe neutron star, but reveals a correlation between the change of the count\nrate during the mHz QPO pulse and the spatial extend of a region emitting\nblackbody emission. The maximum size of the emission area\n$R^2_{\\mathrm{BB}}=216.7^{+93.2}_{-86.4}$km$^2$, provides the direct evidence\nthat the oscillations originate from a variable surface area constrained on the\nNS and are therefore not related to instabilities in the accretion disk.

The false positive rate was 1.0% at\nthe true positive rate of 90% in the magnitude range of 22.0--25.0 mag for the\nformer data. For the latter run, we successfully detected and reported ten\ncandidates of supernovae within the same day as the observation. From these\nruns, we learned the following lessons: (1) the training using artificial\nobjects is effective in filtering out false candidates, especially for faint\nobjects, and (2) combination of ML by majority voting is advantageous. \n\n"}

Such acceleration\ncan produce the non-thermal particles that emit the broadband continuum\nradiation that is detected from extragalactic jets. An important recent\ndevelopment for blazar science is the ability of Fermi-LAT spectroscopy to pin\ndown the shape of the distribution of the underlying non-thermal particle\npopulation. This paper highlights how multi-wavelength spectra spanning optical\nto X-ray to gamma-ray bands can be used to probe diffusive acceleration in\nrelativistic, oblique, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks in blazar jets.\nDiagnostics on the MHD turbulence near such shocks are obtained using thermal\nand non-thermal particle distributions resulting from detailed Monte Carlo\nsimulations of DSA. These probes are afforded by the characteristic property\nthat the synchrotron $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ peak energy does not appear in the gamma-ray\nband above 100 MeV. We investigate self-consistently the radiative synchrotron\nand inverse Compton signatures of the simulated particle distributions.\nImportant constraints on the diffusive mean free paths of electrons, and the\nlevel of electromagnetic field turbulence are identified for three different\ncase study blazars, Mrk 501, BL Lacertae and AO 0235+164. The X-ray excess of\nAO 0235+164 in a flare state can be modelled as the signature of bulk Compton\nscattering of external radiation fields, thereby tightly constraining the\nenergy-dependence of the diffusion coefficient for electrons. The concomitant\ninterpretations that turbulence levels decline with remoteness from jet shocks,\nand the probable significant role for non-gyroresonant diffusion, are posited. \n\n"}

Previous studies of this type\ntreated the NS core as a normal fluid and thus did not account for its expected\nsuperfluidity. The source of buoyancy that supports the g modes is\nfundamentally different in the two cases: in a normal fluid core the buoyancy\nis due to gradients in the proton-to-neutron fraction whereas in a superfluid\ncore it is due to gradients in the muon-to-electron fraction. The latter yields\na stronger stratification and a superfluid NS therefore has a denser spectrum\nof g modes with frequencies above 10 Hz. As a result, many more g modes undergo\nresonant tidal excitation as the binary sweeps through the bandwidth of GW\ndetectors such as LIGO. We find that roughly 10 times more orbital energy is\ntransferred into g mode oscillations if the NS has a superfluid core rather\nthan a normal fluid core. However, because this energy is transferred later in\nthe inspiral when the orbital decay is faster, the accumulated phase error in\nthe gravitational waveform is comparable for a superfluid and a normal fluid NS\n(about 0.001-0.01 rad).

The CRs push the cloud\nupward, imparting it with momentum.

The reconstruction task is challenging as human faces\nvary extensively when considering expressions, poses, textures, and intrinsic\ngeometries. While many approaches tackle this complexity by using additional\ndata to reconstruct the face of a single subject, extracting facial surface\nfrom a single image remains a difficult problem. As a result, single-image\nbased methods can usually provide only a rough estimate of the facial geometry.\nIn contrast, we propose to leverage the power of convolutional neural networks\nto produce a highly detailed face reconstruction from a single image. For this\npurpose, we introduce an end-to-end CNN framework which derives the shape in a\ncoarse-to-fine fashion. The proposed architecture is composed of two main\nblocks, a network that recovers the coarse facial geometry (CoarseNet),\nfollowed by a CNN that refines the facial features of that geometry (FineNet).\nThe proposed networks are connected by a novel layer which renders a depth\nimage given a mesh in 3D. Unlike object recognition and detection problems,\nthere are no suitable datasets for training CNNs to perform face geometry\nreconstruction. Therefore, our training regime begins with a supervised phase,\nbased on synthetic images, followed by an unsupervised phase that uses only\nunconstrained facial images.

Because the extended halos survive longer than the relatively fragile\ntidal features, they trace more ancient mergers. We use images reaching surface\nbrightness limits as low as 28.5-29 mag.arcsec-2 (g-band) to obtain light and\ncolor profiles up to 5-10 effective radii of a sample of nearby early-type\ngalaxies. They were acquired with MegaCam as part of the CFHT MATLAS large\nprogramme. These profiles may be compared to those produced by simulations of\ngalaxy formation and evolution, once corrected for instrumental effects. Indeed\nthey can be heavily contaminated by the scattered light caused by internal\nreflections within the instrument. In particular, the nucleus of galaxies\ngenerates artificial flux in the outer halo, which has to be precisely\nsubtracted. We present a deconvolution technique to remove the artificial halos\nthat makes use of very large kernels. The technique based on PyOperators is\nmore time efficient than the model-convolution methods also used for that\npurpose.

However, recognizing faces with partial occlusion is still challenging\nfor existing face recognizers which is heavily desired in real-world\napplications concerning surveillance and security. Although much research\neffort has been devoted to developing face de-occlusion methods, most of them\ncan only work well under constrained conditions, such as all the faces are from\na pre-defined closed set. In this paper, we propose a robust LSTM-Autoencoders\n(RLA) model to effectively restore partially occluded faces even in the wild.\nThe RLA model consists of two LSTM components, which aims at occlusion-robust\nface encoding and recurrent occlusion removal respectively. The first one,\nnamed multi-scale spatial LSTM encoder, reads facial patches of various scales\nsequentially to output a latent representation, and occlusion-robustness is\nachieved owing to the fact that the influence of occlusion is only upon some of\nthe patches. Receiving the representation learned by the encoder, the LSTM\ndecoder with a dual channel architecture reconstructs the overall face and\ndetects occlusion simultaneously, and by feat of LSTM, the decoder breaks down\nthe task of face de-occlusion into restoring the occluded part step by step.\nMoreover, to minimize identify information loss and guarantee face recognition\naccuracy over recovered faces, we introduce an identity-preserving adversarial\ntraining scheme to further improve RLA. Extensive experiments on both synthetic\nand real datasets of faces with occlusion clearly demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our proposed RLA in removing different types of facial occlusion at various\nlocations. The proposed method also provides significantly larger performance\ngain than other de-occlusion methods in promoting recognition performance over\npartially-occluded faces. \n\n"}

On the contrary,\nthree-dimensional (3D) clumpy structures naturally reproduce the loop.

Abstract: Elemental abundances of stars are the result of the complex enrichment\nhistory of their galaxy. Interpretation of observed abundances requires\nflexible modeling tools to explore and quantify the information about Galactic\nchemical evolution (GCE) stored in such data. Here we present Chempy, a newly\ndeveloped code for GCE modeling, representing a parametrized open one-zone\nmodel within a Bayesian framework. A Chempy model is specified by a set of 5-10\nparameters that describe the effective galaxy evolution along with the stellar\nand star-formation physics: e.g. the star-formation history, the feedback\nefficiency, the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the incidence of\nsupernova type Ia (SN Ia). Unlike established approaches, Chempy can sample the\nposterior probability distribution in the full model parameter space and test\ndata-model matches for different nucleosynthetic yield sets. We extend Chempy\nto a multi-zone scheme. As an illustrative application, we show that\ninteresting parameter constraints result from only the ages and elemental\nabundances of Sun, Arcturus and the present-day interstellar medium (ISM). For\nthe first time, we use such information to infer IMF parameter via GCE\nmodeling, where we properly marginalize over nuisance parameters and account\nfor different yield sets. We find that of the IMF $11.6_{-1.6}^{+2.1}$ %\nexplodes as core-collapse SN, compatible with Salpeter 1955. We also constrain\nthe incidence of SN Ia per 10^3 Msun to 0.5-1.4. At the same time, this Chempy\napplication shows persistent discrepancies between predicted and observed\nabundances for some elements, irrespective of the chosen yield set. These\ncannot be remedied by any variations of Chempy's parameters and could be an\nindication for missing nucleosynthetic channels. Chempy should be a powerful\ntool to confront predictions from stellar nucleosynthesis with far more complex\nabundance data sets. \n\n"}

{"id": "1709.00423", "contents": "Title: The Delay Time Distribution of Tidal Disruption Flares Abstract: Recent observations suggest that stellar tidal disruption events (TDE) are\nstrongly overrepresented in rare, post-starburst galaxies. Several dynamical\nmechanisms have been proposed to elevate their TDE rates, ranging from central\nstellar overdensities to the presence of supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nbinaries. Another such mechanism, introduced here, is a radial velocity\nanisotropy in the nuclear star cluster produced during the starburst. These,\nand other, dynamical hypotheses can be disentangled by comparing observations\nto theoretical predictions for the TDE delay time distribution (DTD). We show\nthat SMBH binaries are a less plausible solution for the post-starburst\npreference, as they can only reproduce the observed DTD with extensive\nfine-tuning. The overdensity hypothesis produces a reasonable match to the\nobserved DTD (based on the limited data currently available), provided that the\ninitial stellar density profile created during the starburst, $\\rho(r)$, is\nexceptional in both steepness and normalization. In particular, explaining the\npost-starburst preference requires $\\rho \\propto r^{-\\gamma}$ with $\\gamma\n\\gtrsim 2.5$, i.e. much steeper than the classic Bahcall-Wolf equilibrium\nprofile of $\\gamma = 7/4$.

Radial anisotropies\nalso represent a promising explanation, provided that initial anisotropy\nparameters of $\\beta_0 \\approx 0.5$ are sustainable against the radial orbit\ninstability.

Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from coalescing binary neutron stars\nrepresents another milestone in gravitational-wave astronomy. However, since\nLIGO is currently not as sensitive to the merger/ringdown part of the waveform,\nthe possibility that such signals are produced by a black hole-neutron star\nbinary can not be easily ruled out without appealing to assumptions about the\nunderlying compact object populations. We review a few astrophysical channels\nthat might produce black holes below 3 $M_{\\odot}$ (roughly the upper bound on\nthe maximum mass of a neutron star), as well as existing constraints for these\nchannels. We show that, due to the uncertainty in the neutron star equation of\nstate, it is difficult to distinguish gravitational waves from a binary neutron\nstar system, from those of a black hole-neutron star system with the same\ncomponent masses, assuming Advanced LIGO sensitivity. This degeneracy can be\nbroken by accumulating statistics from many events to better constrain the\nequation of state, or by third-generation detectors with higher sensitivity to\nthe late spiral to post-merger signal. We also discuss the possible differences\nin electromagnetic counterparts between binary neutron star and low mass black\nhole-neutron star mergers, arguing that it will be challenging to definitively\ndistinguish the two without better understanding of the underlying\nastrophysical processes. \n\n"}

We\nhave probed the disk gap and the surface layers of the outer disk, covering a\nregion < 500 mas (< 55 au at 109 pc) from the star, at an angular resolution of\n~ 20 mas. Our data show an asymmetry: the SE and NW regions of the outer disk\nare more polarized than the SW and NE. This can be explained from a\npreferential scattering angle close to 90$^o$, consistent with previous\npolarization images. The outer disk extends from 13 $\\pm$ 2 to 45 $\\pm$ 9 au,\nwith a position angle and inclination of 137 $\\pm$ 5$^o$ and 44 $\\pm$ 8$^o$.\nThe comparison with previous estimates suggests that the disk inclination could\nincrease with the stellocentric distance, although the different measurements\nare still consistent within the error bars. In addition, no direct signature of\nthe innermost candidate companion is detected from polarimetry, confirming\nrecent results based on intensity imagery.

Since bow shocks are aspherical\nstructures, light scattering within them produces a net polarization signal\neven if the region is spatially unresolved. Scattering opacity arising from\nfree electrons and dust leads to a distribution of polarized intensity across\nthe bow shock structure.

However, further localizations are required\nto determine the nature of FRBs, the sources powering them, and the possibility\nof multiple populations. Here we investigate the use of associated persistent\nradio sources to establish FRB counterparts, taking into account the\nlocalization area and the persistent source flux density. Due to the lower\nareal number density of radio sources compared to faint optical sources, robust\nassociations can be achieved for less precise localizations as compared to\ndirect optical host galaxy associations. For generally larger localizations\nwhich preclude robust associations, the number of candidate hosts can be\nreduced based on the ratio of radio-to-optical brightness. We find that\nconfident associations with $\\sim 0.01-$1 mJy sources, comparable to the\nluminosity of the persistent source associated with FRB 121102 over the\nredshift range $z \\approx 0.1 - 1$, require FRB localizations of $\\lesssim\n20''$.

This\ndiversity might be related to the details of the super-Eddington accretion and\nemission physics relevant to TDE disks. In this Letter, we utilize novel\nthree-dimensional general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics\nsimulations to study the super-Eddington compact disk phase expected in TDEs.\nConsistent with previous studies, geometrically thick disks, wide-angle\noptically-thick fast outflows and relativistic jets are produced.

Approximately after half of the\nlight curves, the correlation between the broad emission lines and the\nlag-corrected ultraviolet continua becomes weak. This anomalous behavior is\naccompanied by an increase of soft X-ray emission. We propose a simple model to\nunderstand this anomalous behavior, i.e., the corona might fall down, thereby\nincreasing the covering fraction of the inner disk. Therefore, X-ray and\nextreme ultraviolet emission suffer from spectral variations. The ultraviolet\ncontinua variations are driven by both X-ray and extreme ultraviolet\nvariations. Consequently, the spectral variability induced by the falling\ncorona would dilute the correlation between the broad emission lines and the\nultraviolet continua. Our model can explain many additional observational\nfacts, including the dependence of the anomalous behavior on velocity and\nionization energy. We also show that the time lag and correlation between the\nX-ray and the ultraviolet variations change as NGC 5548 displays the anomalous\nbehavior. The time lag is dramatically longer than the expectation from disk\nreprocessing if the anomalous behavior is properly excluded. During the\nanomalous state, the time lag approaches the light-travel timescale of disk\nreprocessing albeit with a much weaker correlation. We speculate that the time\nlag in the normal state is caused by reprocessing of the broad line region gas.\nAs NGC 5548 enters the abnormal state, the contribution of the broad line\nregion gas is smaller; the time lag reflects disk reprocessing.

In the first case, mainly the energetics of the events is consistent\nwith the proposed progenitor models, while the duration, time variability, as\nwell as the afterglow emission may shed some light on the detailed properties\nof the collapsing massive stars. In the latter case, the recent discovery of\nthe binary neutron star (NS-NS) merger in the gravitational wave observation\nmade by LIGO (GW170817), and the detection of associated electromagnetic\ncounterparts, for the first time gave a direct proof of the NS-NS merger being\na progenitor of a short GRB.\n  In general, all GRBs are believed to be powered by accretion through a\nrotationally supported torus, or by fast rotation of a compact object. For long\nones, the rotation of the progenitor star is a key property in order to support\naccretion over relatively long activity periods, and also to sustain the\nrotation of the black hole itself. The latter is responsible for ejection of\nthe relativistic jets, which are powered due to the extraction of the BH\nrotational energy, mitigated by the accretion torus and magnetic fields.

Given an image in the source domain, the goal is to\nlearn the conditional distribution of corresponding images in the target\ndomain, without seeing any pairs of corresponding images. While this\nconditional distribution is inherently multimodal, existing approaches make an\noverly simplified assumption, modeling it as a deterministic one-to-one\nmapping. As a result, they fail to generate diverse outputs from a given source\ndomain image. To address this limitation, we propose a Multimodal Unsupervised\nImage-to-image Translation (MUNIT) framework. We assume that the image\nrepresentation can be decomposed into a content code that is domain-invariant,\nand a style code that captures domain-specific properties. To translate an\nimage to another domain, we recombine its content code with a random style code\nsampled from the style space of the target domain.

Extensive experiments with\ncomparisons to the state-of-the-art approaches further demonstrates the\nadvantage of the proposed framework.

As the sensitivities and\nbandwidths of the detectors improve and new detectors join the network, many\nmore sources are expected to be detected. The goal will not only be to find as\nmany sources as possible in the data but to understand the dynamics of the\nsources much more precisely. Standard searches are currently restricted to a\nsmaller parameter space which assumes aligned spins. Construction of a larger\nand denser parameter space, and optimising the resultant increase in false\nalarms, pose a serious computational challenge.

This is especially true of the\npopulations of the Outer Solar System -- objects at the orbit of Neptune $r >\n30$AU and beyond. In this whitepaper, we propose a minimal change to the LSST\ncadence that can greatly enhance LSST's ability to discover faint distant Solar\nSystem objects across the entire wide-fast-deep (WFD) survey area.\nSpecifically, we propose that the WFD cadence be constrained so as to deliver\nleast one sequence of $\\gtrsim 10$ visits per year taken in a $\\sim 10$ day\nperiod in any combination of $g, r$, and $i$ bands. Combined with advanced\nshift-and-stack algorithms (Whidden et al. 2019) this modification would enable\na nearly complete census of the outer Solar System to $\\sim 25.5$ magnitude,\nyielding $4-8$x more KBO discoveries than with single-epoch baseline, and\nenabling rapid identification and follow-up of unusual distant Solar System\nobjects in $\\gtrsim 5$x greater volume of space. These increases would enhance\nthe science cases discussed in Schwamb et al. (2018) whitepaper, including\nprobing Neptune's past migration history as well as discovering hypothesized\nplanet(s) beyond the orbit of Neptune (or at least placing significant\nconstraints on their existence). \n\n"}

The\ncomplex astrophysics involved in core-collapse supernovae pose a significant\nchallenge to modeling such phenomena. The Supernova Model Evidence Extractor\n(SMEE) attempts to capture the main features of gravitational wave signals from\ncore-collapse supernovae by using numerical relativity waveforms to create\napproximate models. These models can then be used to perform Bayesian model\nselection to determine if the targeted astrophysical feature is present in the\ngravitational wave signal. In this paper, we extend SMEE's model selection\ncapabilities to include features in the gravitational wave signal that are\nassociated with g-modes and the standing accretion shock instability. For the\nfirst time, we test SMEE's performance using simulated data for planned future\ndetectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and LIGO Voyager.\nFurther to this, we show how the performance of SMEE is improved by creating\nmodels from the spectrograms of supernova waveforms instead of their timeseries\nwaveforms that contain stochastic features. In third generation detector\nconfigurations, we find that about 50% of neutrino-driven simulations were\ndetectable at 100 kpc, and 10% at 275 kpc. The explosion mechanism was\ncorrectly determined for all detected signals. \n\n"}
{"id": "1901.11033", "contents": "Title: Metric Gaussian Variational Inference Abstract: Solving Bayesian inference problems approximately with variational approaches\ncan provide fast and accurate results. Capturing correlation within the\napproximation requires an explicit parametrization. This intrinsically limits\nthis approach to either moderately dimensional problems, or requiring the\nstrongly simplifying mean-field approach. We propose Metric Gaussian\nVariational Inference (MGVI) as a method that goes beyond mean-field. Here\ncorrelations between all model parameters are taken into account, while still\nscaling linearly in computational time and memory. With this method we achieve\nhigher accuracy and in many cases a significant speedup compared to traditional\nmethods. MGVI is an iterative method that performs a series of Gaussian\napproximations to the posterior. We alternate between approximating the\ncovariance with the inverse Fisher information metric evaluated at an\nintermediate mean estimate and optimizing the KL-divergence for the given\ncovariance with respect to the mean. This procedure is iterated until the\nuncertainty estimate is self-consistent with the mean parameter. We achieve\nlinear scaling by avoiding to store the covariance explicitly at any time.\nInstead we draw samples from the approximating distribution relying on an\nimplicit representation and numerical schemes to approximately solve linear\nequations. Those samples are used to approximate the KL-divergence and its\ngradient. The usage of natural gradient descent allows for rapid convergence.\nFormulating the Bayesian model in standardized coordinates makes MGVI\napplicable to any inference problem with continuous parameters. We demonstrate\nthe high accuracy of MGVI by comparing it to HMC and its fast convergence\nrelative to other established methods in several examples. We investigate\nreal-data applications, as well as synthetic examples of varying size and\ncomplexity and up to a million model parameters. \n\n"}
{"id": "astro-ph/9709113", "contents": "Title: A Complexity-Brightness Correlation in Gamma Ray Bursts Abstract: We observe strong correlations between the temporal properties of gamma ray\nbursts (GRBs) and their apparent peak brightness. The strongest effect (with a\nsignificance level of 10^{-6}) is the difference between the brightness\ndistributions of simple bursts (dominated by a single smooth pulse) and complex\nbursts (consisting of overlapping pulses). The latter has a break at a peak\nflux of 1.5 ph/cm^2/s, while the distribution of simple bursts is smooth down\nto the BATSE threshold. We also observe brightness dependent variations in the\nshape of the average peak aligned time profile (ATP) of GRBs. The decaying\nslope of the ATP shows time dilation when comparing bright and dim bursts while\nthe rising slope hardly changes. Both slopes of the ATP are deformed for weak\nbursts as compared to strong bursts. The interpretation of these effects is\nsimple: a complex burst where a number of independent pulses overlap in time\nappears intrinsically stronger than a simple burst. Then the BATSE sample of\ncomplex bursts covers larger redshifts where some cosmological factor causes\nthe break in the peak brightness distribution. This break could correspond to\nthe peak in the star formation rate that was recently shown to occur at a\nredshift of z~1.5. \n\n"}

I then consider\ncosmic superstrings, including the `fundamental' F-strings and also D-strings\nand strings arising from wrapped branes. I discuss the conditions under which\nthese will exist and be observable, and ways in which different kinds of string\nmight be distinguished. We will see that each of these issues is\nmodel-dependent, but that some of the simplest models of inflation in string\ntheory do lead to cosmic superstrings.
