Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbs\nmeasure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force\nand diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.\n  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify\nthis transition?

The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap\nbetween local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume.

Consider the process with the initial configuration where\neach particle is labeled by its position. It is known that in this case a.s.\neach particle has an asymptotic speed which is distributed uniformly on [-1,1].\nWe study the joint distribution of these speeds: the TASEP speed process. We\nprove that the TASEP speed process is stationary with respect to the multi-type\nTASEP dynamics. Consequently, every ergodic stationary measure is given as a\nprojection of the speed process measure. This generalizes previous descriptions\nrestricted to finitely many classes. By combining this result with known\nstationary measures for TASEPs with finitely many types, we compute several\nmarginals of the speed process, including the joint density of two and three\nconsecutive speeds.

Although\nthe original historical motivation was the study of the stability properties of\nthe Hill equation (which applies to many problems in physics and engineering),\nother questions that arise in systems at resonance, crystallography,\nisoperimetric problems, Rayleigh type quotients, etc. lead to the study of\n$L_p$ Lyapunov inequalities ($1\\leq p\\leq \\infty$) for differential equations.\nIn this work we review some recent results on these kinds of questions which\ncan be formulated as optimal control problems. In the case of Ordinary\nDifferential Equations, we consider periodic and antiperiodic boundary\nconditions at higher eigenvalues and by using a more accurate version of the\nSturm separation theory, an explicit optimal result is obtained. Then, we\nestablish Lyapunov inequalities for systems of equations.

In many instances, processes involving chemical attraction take place\nin fluids. One of the most studied PDE models of chemotaxis is given by\nKeller-Segel equation, which describes a population density of bacteria or mold\nwhich attract chemically to substance they secrete. Solution of Keller-Segel\nequation can exhibit dramatic collapsing behavior, where the density\nconcentrates positive mass in a measure zero region. A natural question is\nwhether presence of fluid flow can affect singularity formation by mixing the\ndensity thus making concentration harder to achieve.\n  In this paper, we consider parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel equation in two\nand three dimensions with additional advection term modeling ambient fluid\nflow. We prove that for any initial data, there exist incompressible fluid\nflows such that the solution to the equation stays globally regular. On the\nother hand, it is well known that when the fluid flow is absent, there exist\ninitial data leading to finite time blow up. Thus presence of fluid can prevent\nthe singularity formation.\n  We discuss two classes of flows that have the explosion arresting property.\nBoth classes are known as very efficient mixers.

First, the main results on the\nconstruction of the weak solutions and on their asymptotic behavior are\nreviewed and structured so that all the cases can be treated in one concise\nway. Most of the open problems are linked with the case of a vanishing velocity\nfield at infinity and this will be the main subject of the remainder of this\nstudy. The linearization of the Navier-Stokes around the zero solution leads to\nthe Stokes equations which are ill-posed in two dimensions. It is the\nwell-known Stokes paradox which states that if the net force is nonzero, the\nsolution of the Stokes equations will grow at infinity. By studying the link\nbetween the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, it is proven that even if the\nnet force vanishes, the velocity and pressure fields of the Navier-Stokes\nequations cannot be asymptotic to those of the Stokes equations. However, the\nvelocity field can be in some cases asymptotic to two exact solutions of the\nStokes equations which also solve the Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, a\nformal asymptotic expansion at infinity for the solutions of the\ntwo-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations having a nonzero net force is\nestablished based physical arguments.

Then, the fame of the method, which could be seen as a\ncompromise between Finite Elements (the center of the method being a weak\nformulation) and Finite Volumes (the basis functions are defined cell-wise, the\ncells being the elements of the primal mesh) increased and slowly investigated\nsuccessfully all the domains of Partial Differential Equations numerical\nintegration. In particular, one can cite the ground papers for the common\ntreatment of convection-diffusion equations [4, 3] or the treatment of pure\nelliptic equations [2, 17]. For more information on the history of\nDiscontinuous Galerkin method, please refer to section 1.1 of [15]. Today, DG\nmethods are widely used in all kind of manners and have applications in almost\nall fields of applied mathematics. (TODO: cite applications and\nstructured/unstructured meshes, steady/unsteady, etc...). The methods is now\nmature enough to deserve entire text books, among which I cite a reference book\non Nodal DG Methods by Henthaven and Warburton [15] with the ground basis of DG\nintegration, numerical analysis of its linear behavior and generalization to\nmultiple dimensions. Lately, since 2010, thanks to a ground work of Zhang and\nShu [26, 27, 25, 28, 29], Discontinuous Galerkin methods are eventually able to\ncombine high order accuracy and certain preservation of convex constraints,\nsuch as the positivity of a given quantity, for example. These new steps\nforward are very promising since it brings us very close to the \"Ultimate\nConservative Scheme\", [23, 1]. \n\n"}

We address the question of symmetry breaking: are the\noptimal functions radially symmetric, or not ? Our intuition comes from a\nweighted fast diffusion (WFD) flow: if symmetry holds, then an explicit entropy\n- entropy production inequality which governs the intermediate asymptotics is\nindeed equivalent to (CKN), and the self-similar profiles are optimal for\n(CKN). We establish an explicit symmetry breaking condition by proving the\nlinear instability of the radial optimal functions for (CKN). Symmetry breaking\nin (CKN) also has consequences on entropy - entropy production inequalities and\non the intermediate asymptotics for (WFD). Even when no symmetry holds in\n(CKN), asymptotic rates of convergence of the solutions to (WFD) are determined\nby a weighted Hardy-Poincar{\\'e} inequality which is interpreted as a\nlinearized entropy - entropy production inequality.

In this paper, we give a thorough mathematical treatment of\nthe linear wave equation on both two and three charge supersymmetric microstate\ngeometries, finding a number of surprising results. In both cases we prove that\nsolutions to the wave equation have uniformly bounded local energy, despite the\nfact that three charge microstates possess an ergoregion; these geometries\ntherefore avoid Friedman's \"ergosphere instability\". In fact, in the three\ncharge case we are able to construct solutions to the wave equation with local\nenergy that neither grows nor decays, although this data must have nontrivial\ndependence on the Kaluza-Klein coordinate.

We consider here the rate of growth\nof the classical and fractional enstrophy in the fractional Burgers equation in\nthe subcritical and supercritical regimes. Since solutions to this equation\nexhibit, respectively, globally well-posed behavior and finite-time blow-up in\nthese two regimes, this makes it a useful model to study the maximum\ninstantaneous growth of enstrophy possible in these two distinct situations.\nFirst, we obtain estimates on the rates of growth and then show that these\nestimates are sharp up to numerical prefactors. This is done by numerically\nsolving suitably defined constrained maximization problems and then\ndemonstrating that for different values of the fractional dissipation exponent\nthe obtained maximizers saturate the upper bounds in the estimates as the\nenstrophy increases. We conclude that the power-law dependence of the enstrophy\nrate of growth on the fractional dissipation exponent has the same global form\nin the subcritical, critical and parts of the supercritical regime. This\nindicates that the maximum enstrophy rate of growth changes smoothly as global\nwell-posedness is lost when the fractional dissipation exponent attains\nsupercritical values.

The numerical study of this conjecture in the\nsimpler setting of the spherically symmetric Einstein--scalar field system was\ninitiated by Bizon and Rostworowski, followed by a vast number of numerical and\nheuristic works by several authors.\n  In this paper, we provide the first rigorous proof of the AdS instability\nconjecture in the simplest possible setting, namely for the spherically\nsymmetric Einstein--massless Vlasov system, in the case when the Vlasov field\nis moreover supported only on radial geodesics. This system is equivalent to\nthe Einstein--null dust system, allowing for both ingoing and outgoing dust. In\norder to overcome the break down of this system occuring once the null dust\nreaches the centre $r=0$, we place an inner mirror at $r=r_{0}>0$ and study the\nevolution of this system on the exterior domain $\\{r\\ge r_{0}\\}$.

The solution of the water waves system is obtained as an\ninfinite sum of solutions to linear problems at each epsilon^k level, and\ntruncation of this series leads to our two asymptotic models, that we call the\nquadratic and cubic h-models.\n  Using the growth rate of the Catalan numbers (from number theory), we prove\nwell-posedness of the h-models in spaces of analytic functions, and prove error\nbounds for solutions of the h-models compared against solutions of the water\nwaves system.

Abstract: Contrary to widespread perception, there is ever since 1994 a unified,\ngeneral type independent theory for the existence of solutions for very large\nclasses of nonlinear systems of PDEs. This solution method is based on the\nDedekind order completion of suitable spaces of piece-wise smooth functions on\nthe Euclidean domains of definition of the respective PDEs. The method can also\ndeal with associated initial and/or boundary value problems. The solutions\nobtained can be assimilated with usual measurable functions or even with\nHausdorff continuous functions on the respective Euclidean domains. It is\nimportant to note that the use of the order completion method does not require\nany monotonicity condition on the nonlinear systems of PDEs involved. One of\nthe major advantages of the order completion method is that it eliminates the\nalgebra based dichotomy \"linear versus nonlinear\" PDEs, treating both cases\nwith equal ease. Furthermore, the order completion method does not introduce\nthe dichotomy \"monotonous versus non-monotonous\" PDEs.

These lattice models have a natural parametrization of their\nrandom curves given by the length of the curve. This parametrization (with\nsuitable scaling) should provide a natural parametrization for the curves in\nthe scaling limit. We conjecture that this parametrization is also given by a\ntype of fractal variation along the curve, and present Monte Carlo simulations\nto support this conjecture. Then we show by simulations that if this fractal\nvariation is used to parametrize the SLE, then the parametrized curves have the\nsame distribution as the curves in the scaling limit of the lattice models with\ntheir natural parametrization. \n\n"}

{"id": "math/9909181", "contents": "Title: On the invariant spectrum of $S^1$-invariant metrics on $S^2$ Abstract: A theorem of J. Hersch (1970) states that for any smooth metric on $S^2$,\nwith total area equal to $4\\pi$, the first nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplace\noperator acting on functions is less than or equal to 2 (this being the value\nfor the standard round metric). For metrics invariant under the standard\n$S^1$-action on $S^2$, one can restrict the Laplace operator to the subspace of\n$S^1$-invariant functions and consider its spectrum there. The corresponding\neigenvalues will be called invariant eigenvalues, and the purpose of this paper\nis to analyse its possible values.\n  We first show that there is no general analogue of Hersch's theorem, by\nexhibiting explicit families of $S^1$-invariant metrics with total area $4\\pi$\nwhere the first invariant eigenvalue ranges through any value between 0 and\n$\\infty$. We then restrict ourselves to $S^1$-invariant metrics that can be\nembedded in ${\\bf R}^3$ as surfaces of revolution. For this subclass we are\nable to provide optimal upper bounds for all invariant eigenvalues. As a\nconsequence, we obtain an analogue of Hersch's theorem with an optimal upper\nbound (greater than 2 and geometrically interesting). This subclass of metrics\non $S^2$ includes all $S^1$-invariant metrics with non-negative Gauss\ncurvature.\n  One of the key ideas in the proofs of these results comes from symplectic\ngeometry, and amounts to the use of the moment map of the $S^1$-action as a\ncoordinate function on $S^2$. \n\n"}
