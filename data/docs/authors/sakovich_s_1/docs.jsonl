The ultimate precision of such measurements could be limited\nby uncertainties in the disk geometry. Using a time-dependent linear theory\nmodel, we study the evolution of a thin initially eccentric disk under\nconditions appropriate to sub-pc scales in Active Galactic Nuclei. The\nevolution is controlled by a combination of differential precession driven by\nthe disk potential and propagating eccentricity waves that are damped by\nviscosity. A simple estimate yields a circularization timescale of\napproximately 10 Myr at 0.1 pc. Numerical solutions for the eccentricity\nevolution confirm that damping commences on this timescale, but show that the\nsubsequent decay rate of the eccentricity depends upon the uncertain strength\nof viscous damping of eccentricity. If eccentricity waves are important further\ndecay of the eccentricity can be slow, with full circularization requiring up\nto 50 Myr for disks at radii of 0.1 pc to 0.2 pc. Observationally, this implies\nthat it is plausible that enough time has elapsed for the eccentricity of\nmasing disks to have been substantially damped, but that it may not be\njustified to assume vanishing eccentricity. We predict that during the damping\nphase the pericenter of the eccentric orbits describes a moderately tightly\nwound spiral with radius. \n\n"}

By\nrandomly varying orientations of these regions, we sample the underlying CMB\nfield in a new manner, that offers a richer exploration of the data content,\nand avoids possible biasing due to a single choice of sky division.

Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of\nAbell 2626 focused on the X-ray and radio interactions. Within the region of\nthe radio mini-halo (~70 kpc), there are substructures which are probably\nproduced by the central radio source and the cooling core. We find that there\nis no obvious correlation between the radio bars and the X-ray image. The\nmorphology of Abell 2626 is more complex than that of the standard X-ray radio\nbubbles seen in other cool core clusters. Thus, Abell 2626 provides a challenge\nto models for the cooling flow -- radio source interaction. We identified two\nsoft X-ray (0.3--2 keV) peaks with the two central cD nuclei; one of them has\nan associated hard X-ray (2--10 keV) point source. We suggest that the two\nsymmetric radio bars can be explained by two precessing jets ejected from an\nAGN.

The conventional approaches use\nthe upper kinematical endpoints of the individual distributions m_{jll},\nm_{jl(lo)} and m_{jl(hi)}, all three of which suffer from parameter space\nregion ambiguities and may lead to multiple solutions for the SUSY mass\nspectrum. In contrast, we do not use m_{jll}, m_{jl(lo)} and m_{jl(hi)}, and\ninstead propose a new set of (infinitely many) variables whose upper kinematic\nendpoints exhibit reduced sensitivity to the parameter space region. We then\noutline an alternative, much simplified procedure for obtaining the SUSY mass\nspectrum. In particular, we show that the four endpoints observed in the three\ndistributions m^2_{ll}, m^2_{jln} U m^2_{jlf} and m^2_{jln}+m^2_{jlf} are\nsufficient to completely pin down the squark mass and the two neutralino\nmasses, leaving only a discrete 2-fold ambiguity for the slepton mass.

By modeling the azimuthal averages of\nthe spectral energy distributions with a complete library of star formation\n(SF) histories, we derived the stellar mass surface density distributions and\nthe SF rate averaged over three different timescales: the recent 0.1 Gyr, 1 Gyr\nand a Hubble time. We find that, for \\sim 80% (27 galaxies) of our sample\ngalaxies, radial profiles (at least in the outer part) at shorter wavelengths\nhave shorter disk scale lengths than those at longer wavelengths. This\nindicates that the star-forming disk has been shrinking. In addition, the\nradial distributions of the stellar mass surface density are well described as\npiece-wise exponential profiles, and \\sim 80% of the galaxies have steeper mass\nprofiles in the outer disk than in the inner region. The steep radial decline\nof SF rate in the outer parts compared to that in the inner disks gives a\nnatural explanation for the down-bending stellar mass surface density profiles.\nWithin the inner disks, our sample galaxies on average have constant ratios of\nrecent SF rate to stellar mass with radius. Nevertheless, \\sim 35% (12\ngalaxies, among which 7 have baryonic mass < 10^8 M\\odot) of the sample exhibit\nnegative slopes across the observed disk, which is in contrast with the\n\"inside-out\" disk growth scenario suggested for luminous spiral galaxies.

Our most\nsignificant finding is that the details of initial force balance have a\npronounced effect on the resulting flow morphology. Models in which the initial\nmagnetic field is force-free deform, but do not become disrupted. Systems that\nachieve initial equilibrium by balancing pressure gradients and/or rotation\nagainst magnetic forces, however, tend to shred, mix, and develop turbulence.\nIn all cases, the linear growth of current-driven instabilities is\nwell-represented by analytic models.

Probable cause was thermal\nstress from the heat pulse into the nucleus after perihelion, which could also\nproduce fragmentation of sungrazers far from the Sun. The spine tail was a\nsynchronic feature, made up of dust released at <30 m/s. Since the nucleus\nwould have been located on the synchrone, we computed the astrometric positions\nof the missing nucleus as the coordinates of the points of intersection of the\nspine tail's axis with lines of forced orbital-period variation, derived from\norbital solutions based on preperihelion astrometry from the ground. The\nresulting osculating orbital period was 698+/-2 years, which proves that C/2011\nW3 is the first major member of the predicted new, 21st-century cluster of\nbright Kreutz-system sungrazers. The spine tail's tip contained dust 1-2 mm in\ndiameter. The bizarre appearance of the dust tail in images taken hours after\nperihelion with coronagraphs on SOHO and STEREO is readily understood.

Most analyses of these\ndistortions focus on the signatures of hitchhiking due to hard or soft\nselective sweeps at a single genetic locus. However, in linked regions of\nrapidly adapting genomes, multiple beneficial mutations at different loci can\nsegregate simultaneously within the population, an effect known as clonal\ninterference. This leads to a subtle interplay between hitchhiking and\ninterference effects, which leads to a unique signature of rapid adaptation on\ngenetic variation both at the selected sites and at linked neutral loci. Here,\nwe introduce an effective coalescent theory (a \"fitness-class coalescent\") that\ndescribes how positive selection at many perfectly linked sites alters the\nstructure of genealogies. We use this theory to calculate several simple\nstatistics describing genetic variation within a rapidly adapting population,\nand to implement efficient backwards-time coalescent simulations which can be\nused to predict how clonal interference alters the expected patterns of\nmolecular evolution. \n\n"}

This is an unfavorable scenario for secrecy performance as the\nsystem is interference-limited. In the literature, assuming that the receiver\noperates in half duplex (HD) mode, the aforementioned problem has been\naddressed via use of cooperating nodes who act as jammers to confound the\neavesdropper. This paper investigates an alternative solution, which assumes\nthe availability of a full duplex (FD) receiver. In particular, while receiving\ndata, the receiver transmits jamming noise to degrade the eavesdropper channel.\nThe proposed self-protection scheme eliminates the need for external helpers\nand provides system robustness. For the case in which global channel state\ninformation is available, we aim to design the optimal jamming covariance\nmatrix that maximizes the secrecy rate and mitigates loop interference\nassociated with the FD operation.

In this paper,\nwe investigate the structure and gravitational stability of the protostellar\ndisks in the full metallicity range between zero and the solar value. Using the\nmass-accretion rates evaluated from the thermal evolution in the preceding\ncollapse phase of the pre-stellar cores, we calculate disk structures and their\nevolution in the framework of the standard steady disks. Overall, with higher\nmetallicity, more efficient cooling results in the lower accretion rate and\nlower temperature inside the disk: at zero metallicity, the accretion rate is ~\n1e-3Msun/yr and the disk temperature is ~ 1000 K, while at solar metallicity, ~\n1e-6Msun/yr and 10 K. Despite the large difference in these values, the zero-\nand solar-metallicity disks have similar stability properties: the Toomre\nparameter for the gravitational stability, which can be written using the ratio\nof temperatures in the disk and in the envelope as Q ~ (T_disk/T_env)^3/2, is >\n1, i.e., marginally stable. At intermediate metallicities of 1e-5--1e-3Zsun,\nhowever, the disks are found to be strongly unstable with Q ~ 0.1--1 since dust\ncooling, which is effective only in the disks due to their high density (> 1e10\ncm^-3), makes the temperature in the disks lower than that in the envelopes.\nThis indicates that masses of the individual stars formed as a result of the\nprotostellar disk fragmentation can be significantly smaller than their parent\ncore in this metallicity range. The typical stellar mass in this case would be\na few Msun, which is consistent with the observationally suggested mass-scale\nof extremely metal-poor stars. \n\n"}

The most\ninteresting one is the so-called rho-state, whose light curve shows recurrent\nbursts. This paper presents a model based on Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations\ncontaining two variables: x, linked to the source photon luminosity L detected\nby the MECS, and y related to the mean photon energy. We aim at providing a\nsimple mathematical framework composed by non-linear differential equations\nuseful to predict the observed light curve and the energy lags for the\nrho-state and possibly other classes of the source. We studied the equilibrium\nstate and the stability conditions of this system that includes one external\nparameter, J, that can be considered a function of the disk accretion rate. Our\nwork is based on observations performed with the MECS on board BeppoSAX when\nthe source was in rho and nu mode, respectively. The evolution of the mean\ncount rate and photon energy were derived from a study of the trajectories in\nthe count rate - photon energy plane. Assuming J constant, we found a solution\nthat reproduces the x profile of the rho class bursts and, unexpectedly, we\nfound that y exhibited a time modulation similar to that of the mean energy.\nMoreover, assuming a slowly modulated J the solutions for x quite similar to\nthose observed in the nu class light curves is reproduced.

This finding makes\nstronger the heuristic meaning of the non-linear model and suggests a simple\nrelation between the variable x and y.

We perform 2D gas\nhydrodynamical simulations of disks with one and two giant planets which may\nopen deep or partial gaps. A gas ring forms in between two planets such that\nthe surface mass density is higher than on either side of it. This ring is a\nregion of pressure maximum where we expect large grains, which are marginally\ncoupled to the gas and would otherwise be subject to radial drift, to collect.\nSuch a pressure maximum also occurs at the outermost gap edge in a disk with\none or more planets.

Consequently, these particles\nare expected to stay in ring structure(s) longer than the gas.

Besides finite\nsurvey-volume effects and flux-limits, our optimal estimation scheme\nincorporates several of the key tenets of galaxy formation: galaxies form and\nreside exclusively in dark matter haloes; a given dark matter halo may host\nseveral galaxies of various luminosities; galaxies inherit part of their\nlarge-scale bias from their host halo. Under these broad assumptions, we prove\nthat the optimal weights \"do not\" explicitly depend on galaxy luminosity, other\nthan through defining the maximum survey volume and effective galaxy density at\na given position.

These have a conservation law which enforces\ntheir production and decay in pairs and hence requires that the leading\ncoupling to quarks is quadratically through a dimension 5 operator. One way to\nrealize these hypotheses is if the SU(3) color gauge invariance is enhanced to\nSL(3, C), while at the same time promoting the internal metric, which picks out\nwhat is a unitary transformation, to a dynamical degree of freedom. This theory\nwas first proposed by Cahill[3], Dell[4], Kim and Zee[5], and Julia and\nLuciani[6].

Since the majority of\nthe mass density is in the form of dark matter that cannot be directly\nobserved, to do cosmology with large-scale structure one must use observable\n(baryonic) quantities that trace the underlying matter distribution in a\n(hopefully) predictable way. However, recent numerical studies have\ndemonstrated that the mapping between observable and total mass, as well as the\ntotal mass itself, are sensitive to unresolved feedback processes associated\nwith galaxy formation, motivating explicit calibration of the feedback\nefficiencies. Here we construct a new suite of large-volume cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations (called BAHAMAS, for BAryons and HAloes of MAssive\nSystems) where subgrid models of stellar and Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)\nfeedback have been calibrated to reproduce the present-day galaxy stellar mass\nfunction and the hot gas mass fractions of groups and clusters in order to\nensure the effects of feedback on the overall matter distribution are broadly\ncorrect.

The field is currently undergoing a\nrevolution fuelled by increasing numbers of genetic variants demonstrated to be\nassociated with exposures in genome-wide association studies, and the public\navailability of summarized data on genetic associations with exposures and\noutcomes from large consortia. A Mendelian randomization analysis with many\ngenetic variants can be performed relatively simply using summarized data.\nHowever, a causal interpretation is only assured if each genetic variant\nsatisfies the assumptions of an instrumental variable. To provide some\nprotection against failure of these assumptions, robust methods for\ninstrumental variable analysis have been proposed. Here, we develop three\nextensions to instrumental variable methods using: i) robust regression, ii)\nthe penalization of weights from candidate instruments with heterogeneous\ncausal estimates, and iii) L1 penalization. Results from a wide variety of\nrobust methods, including the recently-proposed MR-Egger and median-based\nmethods, are compared in an extensive simulation study. We demonstrate that two\nmethods, robust regression in an inverse-variance weighted method and a simple\nmedian of the causal estimates from the individual variants, have considerably\nimproved Type 1 error rates compared with conventional methods in a wide\nvariety of scenarios when up to 30% of the genetic variants are invalid\ninstruments. While the MR-Egger method gives unbiased estimates when its\nassumptions are satisfied, these estimates are less efficient than those from\nother methods and are highly sensitive to violations of the assumptions.\nMethods that make different assumptions should be used routinely to assess the\nrobustness of findings from applied Mendelian randomization investigations with\nmultiple genetic variants. \n\n"}

This paper offers a simple, practical construction of simultaneous\nconfidence bands for quantile and quantile effect functions of possibly\ndiscrete random variables. It is based on a natural transformation of\nsimultaneous confidence bands for distribution functions, which are readily\navailable for many problems. The construction is generic and does not depend on\nthe nature of the underlying problem.

Most existing work on visual similarity assumes that\nimages are similar because they contain the same object instance or category.\nHowever, the reason why images are similar is much more complex. For example,\nfrom the perspective of category, a black dog image is similar to a white dog\nimage. However, in terms of color, a black dog image is more similar to a black\nhorse image than the white dog image. This example serves to illustrate that\nvisual similarity is ambiguous but can be made precise when given an explicit\ncontextual perspective. Based on this observation, we propose the concept of\ncontextual visual similarity. To be concrete, we examine the concept of\ncontextual visual similarity in the application domain of image search. Instead\nof providing only a single image for image similarity search (\\eg, Google image\nsearch), we require three images.

Such tests are complementary to optical and gravitational wave\nmerger signatures, which have uncertainties dominated by the poorly constrained\ngravastar crust. We motivate our analysis directly from the action principle,\nand show that a population of gravastars must induce a time-dependent dark\nenergy (DE). The possibility of such a contribution has been overlooked due to\na subtlety in the de facto definition of the isotropic and homogeneous stress.\nConservation of stress-energy directly relates the time evolution of this DE\ncontribution to the measured BH comoving mass function and a gravastar\npopulation crust parameter $\\eta$. We show that a population of gravastars\nformed between redshift $8 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 20$ readily produces the\npresent-day DE density over a large range of $\\eta$, providing a natural\nresolution to the coincidence problem.

Since the formation of such compact remnants releases\nover hundred times more energy in neutrinos than the SN in the explosion,\nneutrinos can be the decisive agents for powering the SN outburst. According to\nthe standard paradigm of the neutrino-driven mechanism, the energy transfer by\nthe intense neutrino flux to the medium behind the stagnating core-bounce\nshock, assisted by violent hydrodynamic mass motions (sometimes subsumed by the\nterm \"turbulence\"), revives the outward shock motion and thus initiates the SN\nblast. Because of the weak coupling of neutrinos in the region of this energy\ndeposition, detailed, multidimensional hydrodynamic models including neutrino\ntransport and a wide variety of physics are needed to assess the viability of\nthe mechanism. Owing to advanced numerical codes and increasing supercomputer\npower, considerable progress has been achieved in our understanding of the\nphysical processes that have to act in concert for the success of\nneutrino-driven explosions.

We combine luminosity-selected galaxies (`high-luminosity\nsample') with galaxies selected in other ways (`low-luminosity sample') to\ncover a range in stellar mass that spans almost five orders of magnitude: 7.0 <\nlog M* < 11.5. We find that the logarithmic power-law slope and normalisation\nof the TFR are independent of redshift out to z~3. The scatter in the TFR is\n<0.5 dex such that the gas velocity dispersion can be used as a proxy for the\nstellar mass of a galaxy independently of its redshift. At z>3 the scatter\nincreases and the existence of a correlation is not obvious. The\nhigh-luminosity sample exhibits a flatter slope of 1.5$\\pm$0.2 at z<3 compared\nto the low-luminosity sample slope of 2.9$\\pm$0.3, suggesting a turnover in the\nTFR.

In order to estimate\nthe template, one often minimizes the variance when the influence of the\ntransformations have been removed (computation of the Fr{\\'e}chet mean in the\nquotient space). The consistency bias is defined as the distance (possibly\nzero) between the orbit of the template and the orbit of one element which\nminimizes the variance. In the first part, we restrict ourselves to isometric\ngroup action, in this case the Hilbertian distance is invariant under the group\naction. We establish an asymptotic behavior of the consistency bias which is\nlinear with respect to the noise level. As a result the inconsistency is\nunavoidable as soon as the noise is enough. In practice, template estimation\nwith a finite sample is often done with an algorithm called \"max-max\".

We propose\na novel deep learning framework for speech separation that addresses both of\nthese issues.

If Nf>Nc, the vacuum is not gapped and the\nlow-energy theory contains both the vacuum massless excitations and the string\nzero-modes. The question we address in this work is whether the vacuum and the\nstring moduli decouple at low energies, allowing a description of the\nlow-energy dynamics in terms of a two-dimensional theory on the string\nworldsheet. We find a simple condition controlling the bulk-string coupling: If\nthere exist two flavors such that the product of their U(1) charge difference\nwith the magnetic flux carried by the string configuration is not an integer\nmultiple of 2\\pi, the string has zero-modes that decay slower than 1/r, where r\nis the radial distance from the string core. These modes are coupled to the\nvacuum massless excitations even at low energies. If, however, all such\nproducts are integer multiples of 2\\pi, long-range modes of this type do not\nexist and the string moduli decouple from the bulk at low energies.

In addition to a derivation of the\nbulk-string decoupling criterion using classical analysis of the string\nzero-modes, we provide a non-perturbative derivation of the criterion, which\nuses supersymmetric localization techniques. \n\n"}

We\nshow how for close enough separations (20-30 AU for average X-ray luminosities)\nthe tidal torque of the companion changes the qualitative behaviour of disc\ndispersal from inside out to outside in. Fewer transition discs created by\nphotoevaporation are thus expected in binaries. We also demonstrate that in\nclose binaries the reduction in viscous time leads to accelerated disc clearing\naround both components, consistent with $\\textit{unresolved}$ observations.\nWhen looking at the $\\textit{differential}$ disc evolution around the two\ncomponents, in close binaries discs around the secondary clear first due to the\nshorter viscous timescale associated with the smaller outer radius.

We show that for the motion of\nelementary particles in vacuum metrics the DWB equation can be reduced to the\ncovariant form of the LD equation which we use here. Generically, the LD\nequation is plagued by runaway solutions, so we discuss computational ways to\navoid this problem in constructing numerical solutions.

In order to address these challenges, in this paper, the problem\nof joint 4C in big data MEC is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal\nis to maximize the bandwidth saving while minimizing delay, subject to the\nlocal computation capability of user devices, computation deadline, and MEC\nresource constraints.

(1) Our design is fundamentally\ndifferent from previous pure patch-based and image-based segmentation methods.\nWe observe that during delineation, the physician repeatedly check the\ninside-outside intensity changing to determine the boundary, which indicates\nthat comparison in an inside-outside manner is extremely important. Thus, we\ninnovatively model our segmentation task as learning the representation of the\nbi-directional sequential patches, starting from (or ending in) the given\ncentral point of the object.

In particular, we investigate codes\ngiven by 2D symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases that appear naturally on\nthe boundary of 3D symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases.

The dynamics\nof the given system are firstly modeled using differential equations and then\nLaplace transform is applied to convert these differential equations to their\nequivalent algebraic equations. These equations can further be simplified to\neither obtain the transfer function of the system or to find out the solution\nof the differential equations in frequency domain. Next, the uniqueness of the\nLaplace transform provides the solution of these differential equations in the\ntime domain. The traditional Laplace transform based analysis techniques, i.e.,\npaper-and-pencil proofs and computer simulation methods are error-prone due to\ntheir inherent limitations and thus are not suitable for the analysis of the\nsystems. Higher-order-logic theorem proving can overcome these limitations of\nthese techniques and can ascertain accurate analysis of the systems.

Many previous works achieve decoupling with the\naid of a random unitary. It is known that random unitaries can be replaced by\nrandom circuits of size O(n\\log n) and depth poly(\\log n), or unitary 2-designs\nbased on Clifford circuits of similar size and depth.

The last decade has seen the rise of Bayesian hierarchical models\nin ecology. Consequently, popular tools, such as the AIC, become largely\ninapplicable and other tools are not universally applicable. We focus on a\nclass of competing Bayesian spatially explicit capture recapture (SECR) models\nand first apply some of the recommended Bayesian model selection tools: (1)\nBayes Factor - using (a) Gelfand-Dey (b) harmonic mean methods, (2) DIC, (3)\nWAIC and (4) the posterior predictive loss function. In all, we evaluate 25\nvariants of model selection tools in our study. We evaluate these model\nselection tools from the standpoint of model selection and parameter estimation\nby contrasting the choice recommended by a tool with a `true' model. In all, we\ngenerate 120 simulated data sets using the true model and assess the frequency\nwith which the true model is selected and how well the tool estimates N\n(population size). We find that when information content is low, no particular\ntool can be recommended to help realise, simultaneously, both the goals of\nmodel selection and parameter estimation. In such scenarios, we recommend that\npractitioners utilise our application of Bayes Factor for parameter estimation\nand recommend the posterior predictive loss approach for model selection when\ninformation content is low. When both the objectives are taken together, we\nrecommend the use of our applications of Bayes Factor for Bayesian SECR models.\nOur study reveals that although new model selection tools are emerging (eg:\nWAIC) in the applied statistics literature, an uncritical absorption of these\nnew tools (i.e. without assessing their efficacies for the problem at hand)\ninto ecological practice may mislead inferences. \n\n"}

In the near-infrared some\nof these flares were reported as showing intrinsic quasi-periodicities. The\nflux peaks associated with the quasi-periodic behavior were found to be highly\npolarized. Aims: The aim of this work is to present new evidence to support\nprevious findings of the properties of the polarized radiation from SgrA* and\nto again provide strong support for the quasi-periodicity of ~18+-3 min\nreported earlier. Methods: Observations were carried out at the European\nSouthern Observatory's Very Large Telescope on Paranal, Chile. We used the\nNAOS/CONICA adaptive optics/near-infrared camera instrument. By fitting the\npolarimetric lightcurves with a hot-spot model, we addressed the question of\nwhether the data are consistent with this model. To fit the observed data we\nused a general relativistic ray-tracing code in combination with a simple\nhot-spot/ring model. Results: We report on new polarization measurements of a\nK-band flare from the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center. The data\nprovide very strong support for a quasi-periodicity of 15.5+-2 min. The mean\npolarization of the flare is consistent with the direction of the electric\nfield vector that was reported in previous observations. The data can be\nmodeled successfully with a combined blob/ring model. The inclination i of the\nblob orbit must be i > 20 deg on a 3sigma level, and the dimensionless spin\nparameter of the black hole is derived to be a > 0.5. \n\n"}

A correction for foreground\nextinction leads to an intrinsic intensity that could be as much as twice this\nvalue. Assuming T ~ 3 x 10^5 K, we conclude that the electron density, n_e, is\n0.01-0.02 /cm^3, the thermal pressure, p/k, is 7000-10,000 K/cm^3, and that the\nhot gas is spread over a length of 50-70 pc, implying a small filling factor\nfor O VI-rich gas. ROSAT observations of emission at 1/4 keV in the same\ndirection indicate that the X-rays are weaker by a factor of 1.1 to 4.7,\ndepending on the foreground extinction. Simulated supernova remnants evolving\nin low density gas have similar O VI to X-ray ratios when the remnant plasma is\napproaching collisional ioinizational equilibrium and the physical structures\nare approaching dynamical ``middle age''. Alternatively, the plasma can be\ndescribed by a temperature power-law.

We\nfind that: 1) NLS1s have less massive black hole masses than BLS1s; 2) HBLRS2s\nhave the same mass distribution of the black holes with BLS1s; 3) the absorbed\nnon-HBLR S2s have less massive black holes than HBLR S2s; 4) unabsorbed\nnon-HBLR S2s have the most massive black holes. We thus have a queue of black\nhole masses from small to large: narrow to broad line Seyfert galaxies,\nproviding new evidence for the evolutionary sequence of Seyfert galaxies. We\nfind that the opening angles of the torus in NLS1s and absorbed non-HBLR S2s\nare significantly smaller than that in BLS1s and HBLR S2s. The growth of the\nblack holes and increases of the opening angles of the tori determine the\nvarious appearances of Seyfert galaxies.

Seyfert galaxies are tending\nto finally evolve to unabsorbed non-HBLR Seyfert 2 galaxies, in which the black\nholes are accreting with low accretion rates and both the broad line region and\ndusty torus disappear. \n\n"}

The specific matching procedure used here\nclosely follows the calculation in gr-qc/0503011, and is performed in the so\ncalled buffer zone where both the post-Newtonian and the perturbed\nSchwarzschild approximations hold. The result is that both metrics agree in the\nbuffer zone, up to the errors in the approximations. However, since isotropic\ncoordinates are very similar to ADMTT coordinates, matching yields better\nresults than in the previous calculation, where harmonic coordinates were used\nfor the post-Newtonian 4-metric. In particular, not only does matching improve\nin the buffer zone, but due to the similarity between ADMTT and isotropic\ncoordinates the two metrics are also close to each other near the black hole\nhorizons.

This postulate corresponds to what we have called the\nMultiple Point Principle, namely that there be many ``vacuum'' states with the\nsame energy density. We further assume that 6 top quarks and 6 anti-top quarks\ncan bind by Higgs exchange so strongly as to become tachyonic and form a\ncondensate. This gives rise to the possibility of having a phase transition\nbetween vacua with and without such a condensate. The two vacua distinguished\nby such a condensate will have the same cosmological constant provided the top\nYukawa coupling is about $1.1 \\pm 0.2$, in good correspondence with the\nexperimental value. The further requirement that this value of the Yukawa\ncoupling, at the weak scale, be compatible with the existence of a third\nvacuum, with a Higgs field expectation value of the order of the fundamental\nscale, enforces a hierarchical scale ratio between the fundamental and weak\nscales of order $10^{16}$ -- $10^{20}$. \n\n"}

For such boundary\nconditions classically there always exists a unique hot AdS solution and two or\nno Schwarzschild-AdS black-hole solutions depending on whether or not the\ntemperature of the cavity-wall is above a minimum value, the latter being a\nfunction of the radius of the cavity. Assuming the standard area-law of\nblack-hole entropy, it was known that larger and smaller holes have positive\nand negative specific heats and hence are locally thermodynamically stable and\nunstable respectively. In this paper we present the first derivation of this by\nshowing that the standard area law of black-hole entropy holds in the\nsemi-classical approximation of the Euclidean path integral for such boundary\nconditions. We further show that for wall-temperatures above a critical value a\nphase transition takes hot AdS to the larger Schwarzschild-AdS within the\ncavity.

Our work addresses the problem of constructing quantum circuits to\nimplement an arbitrary given quantum computation, in the special case of two\nqubits. We pursue circuits without ancilla qubits and as small a number of\nelementary quantum gates as possible. Our lower bound for worst-case optimal\ntwo-qubit circuits calls for at least 17 gates: 15 one-qubit rotations and 2\nCNOTs. To this end, we constructively prove a worst-case upper bound of 23\nelementary gates, of which at most 4 (CNOT) entail multi-qubit interactions.\nOur analysis shows that synthesis algorithms suggested in previous work,\nalthough more general, entail much larger quantum circuits than ours in the\nspecial case of two qubits.

Unlike most earlier studies where the bath is assumed to be fixed,\nwe study the coherent evolution of the combined qubit-EMF system, thus allowing\nfor the back-action from the bath on the qubit and the qubit on the bath in a\nself-consistent manner. In this way we can see the development of quantum\ncorrelations and entanglement between the system and its environment, and how\nthat affects the decoherence and relaxation of the system. We find\nnon-exponential decay for both the diagonal and non-diagonal matrix elements of\nthe qubit's reduced density matrix in the pointer basis. From the diagonal\nelements we see the qubit relaxes to thermal equilibrium with the bath. From\nthe non-diagonal elements, we see the decoherence rate beginning at the usually\npredicted thermal rate, but changing to the zero temperature decoherence rate\nas the qubit and bath become entangled. These two rates are comparable, as was\nshown before in the zero temperature case [C. Anastopoulos and B. L. Hu, Phys.\nRev. A {\\bf 62} (2000) 033821].
