We begin\nin this paper with a derivation of the self-force on a compact object moving in\nthe background spacetime of a supermassive black hole. The EFT approach\nutilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are the\nsize of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the background\nspacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as an\neffective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. Ultraviolet\ndivergences are regularized using Hadamard's {\\it partie finie} to isolate the\nnon-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part. The latter is\nconstructed from a momentum space representation for the graviton retarded\npropagator and is evaluated using dimensional regularization in which only\nlogarithmic divergences are relevant for renormalizing the parameters of the\ntheory. As a first important application of this framework we explicitly derive\nthe first order self-force given by Mino, Sasaki, Tanaka, Quinn and Wald. Going\nbeyond the point particle approximation, to account for the finite size of the\nobject, we demonstrate that for extreme mass ratio inspirals the motion of a\ncompact object is affected by tidally induced moments at $O(\\epsilon^4)$, in\nthe form of an Effacement Principle. The relatively large radius-to-mass ratio\nof a white dwarf star allows for these effects to be enhanced until the white\ndwarf becomes tidally disrupted, a potentially $O(\\epsilon^2)$ process, or\nplunges into the supermassive black hole. This work provides a new foundation\nfor further exploration of higher order self force corrections, gravitational\nradiation and spinning compact objects. \n\n"}

Our distillation circuit is based on a family of concatenated quantum\ncodes that possess a transversal Hadamard operation, enabling each of these\ncodes to distill the eigenstate of the Hadamard operator. A crucial result of\nthis design is that low-fidelity magic states can be consumed to purify other\nhigh-fidelity magic states to even higher fidelity, which we call \"multilevel\ndistillation.\" When distilling in the asymptotic regime of infidelity $\\epsilon\n\\rightarrow 0$ for each input magic state, the number of input magic states\nconsumed on average to yield an output state with infidelity\n$O(\\epsilon^{2^r})$ approaches $2^r+1$, which comes close to saturating the\nconjectured bound in [Phys.

Vacuum and non-vacuum solutions for\n  massive gravity Abstract: Massive gravity is a theory which has a tremendous amount of freedom to\ndescribe different cosmologies; but at the same time the various solutions one\nencounters must fulfill some rather nontrivial constraints. Most of the freedom\ncomes not from the Lagrangian, which contains only a small number of free\nparameters (typically 3 depending on counting conventions), but from the fact\nthat one is in principle free to choose the background reference metric almost\narbitrarily --- which effectively introduces a non-denumerable infinity of free\nparameters. In the current paper we stress that although changing the reference\nmetric would lead to a different cosmological model, this does not mean that\nthe dynamics of the universe can be entirely divorced from its matter content.\nThat is, while the choice of reference metric certainly influences the\nevolution of the physically observable foreground metric, the effect of matter\ncannot be neglected. Nevertheless, the relation between matter and geometry can\nbe significantly changed in some specific models; effectively since the\ngraviton would be able to curve the spacetime by itself, without the need of\nmatter.

We give independent\nestimates of the dust polarization signal in the BICEP2 region using four\ndifferent approaches. While these approaches are consistent with each other,\nthe expected amplitude of the dust polarization power spectrum remains\nuncertain by about a factor of three. The lower end of the prediction leaves\nroom for a primordial contribution, but at the higher end the dust in\ncombination with the standard CMB lensing signal could account for the BICEP2\nobservations, without requiring the existence of primordial gravitational\nwaves.

The Monte Carlo simulation is performed at $\\beta=7.99,\n30.5,$ and $120$ on $62^2, 128^2,$ and $256^2$ at the quenched level. In the\nmomentum space, the transverse component of the diagonal gluon propagator shows\nsuppression with increasing $\\beta$ in the infrared region and the dressing\nfunction at $\\beta=120$ has a maximum at $p^2 \\simeq 4$GeV, while the\ntransverse component of the off-diagonal gluon propagator does not show the\n$\\beta$-dependence and the dressing function does not have a maximum.

The Wilsonian construction is generalised by promoting the\ncut-off to a functional of these collective variables. We impose three criteria\nto determine the coarse-graining. The first criterion is that the effective\nWard identities for local conservation of energy, momentum, etc. should\npreserve their standard forms, but in new scale-dependent background metric and\nsources which are functionals of the effective single trace operators. The\nsecond criterion is that the scale-evolution equations of the operators in the\nactual background metric should be state-independent, implying that the\ncollective variables should not explicitly appear in them. The final criterion\nis that the endpoint of the scale-evolution of the RG flow can be transformed\nto a fixed point corresponding to familiar non-relativistic equations with a\nfinite number of parameters, such as incompressible non-relativistic\nNavier-Stokes, under a certain universal rescaling of the scale and of the time\ncoordinate.

It was shown recently that for gyros\nattached to static observers, their precession frequency became arbitrarily\nlarge in the limit of approach to the ergosurface. For gyros attached to\nstationary observers that move with non-zero angular velocity $\\Omega$, this\ndivergence at the ergosurface can be avoided. Specifically, for such gyros, the\nprecession frequencies diverge on the event horizon of a BH, but are finite and\nregular for NS everywhere except at the singularity itself. Therefore a genuine\ndetection of the event horizon becomes possible in this case. We also show that\nfor a near-extremal NS ($1<a_* < 1.1$), characteristic features appear in the\nradial profiles of the precession frequency, using which we can further\ndistinguish a near-extremal NS from a BH, or even from NS with larger angular\nmomentum. We then investigate the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession or nodal plane\nprecession frequency of the accretion disk around a BH and NS to show that\nclear distinctions exist for these configurations in terms of radial variation\nfeatures. The LT precession in equatorial circular orbits increases with\napproach to a BH, whereas for NS it increases, attains a peak and then\ndecreases. Interestingly, for $a_*=1.089$, it decreases until it vanishes at a\ncertain radius, and acquires negative values for $a_* > 1.089$ for a certain\nrange of $r$. For $1<a_*<1.089$, a peak appears, but the LT frequency remains\npositive definite. There are important differences in accretion disk LT\nfrequencies for BH and NS and since LT frequencies are intimately related to\nobserved QPOs, these features might allow us to determine whether a given\nrotating compact astrophysical object is BH or NS. \n\n"}

For a\nspatially flat FRW universe filled with pressureless dark matter and DBI dark\nenergy, we first obtain the evolutionary behaviors of the background\nquantities. Our results show that in our DBI model, the universe starts from a\nmatter dominated epoch and approaches to the de Sitter universe at late times,\nas expected. Also the DBI potential behaves like the power law one\n$V(\\phi)\\propto \\phi^n$.\n  In addition, we use the Pseudo-Newtonian formalism to obtain the growth\nfactor of dark matter perturbations in the linear regime. We conclude that for\nsmaller $c_s$ (or $f_0$), the growth factor of dark matter is smaller for\nclustering DBI model compared to the homogeneous one. In the following, in the\nnon-linear regime based on the spherical collapse model, we obtain the linear\noverdensity $\\delta_c(z_c)$, the virial overdensity $\\Delta_{\\rm vir}(z_c)$,\noverdensity at the turn around $\\zeta(z_c)$ and the rate of expansion of\ncollapsed region $h_{\\rm ta}(z)$.

This suggests that a\nnon-trivial version of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) may also apply to\ngauge symmetries that are discrete, despite there being no associated massless\nfield, therefore pushing the conjecture beyond the slogan that `gravity is the\nweakest force'.

As being a\npositive test of our proposal, we consider the problem of calculating weight\nmultiplicities for affine Lie algebras and hence our discussions are based on\nexplicit computations of Weyl-Kac character formula.

{"id": "quant-ph/9611025", "contents": "Title: Fault Tolerant Quantum Computation with Constant Error Abstract: Recently Shor showed how to perform fault tolerant quantum computation when\nthe error probability is logarithmically small. We improve this bound and\ndescribe fault tolerant quantum computation when the error probability is\nsmaller than some constant threshold. The cost is polylogarithmic in time and\nspace, and no measurements are used during the quantum computation. The result\nholds also for quantum circuits which operate on nearest neighbors only. To\nachieve this noise resistance, we use concatenated quantum error correcting\ncodes. The scheme presented is general, and works with all quantum codes that\nsatisfy some restrictions, namely that the code is ``proper''.\n  We present two explicit classes of proper quantum codes. The first example of\nproper quantum codes generalizes classical secret sharing with polynomials. The\nsecond uses a known class of quantum codes and converts it to a proper code.\nThis class is defined over a field with p elements, so the elementary quantum\nparticle is not a qubit but a ``qupit''. With our codes, the threshold is about\n10^(-6). Hopefully, this paper motivates a search for proper quantum codes with\nhigher thresholds, at which point quantum computation becomes practical. \n\n"}

I Abstract: We consider the Bennett-Brassard cryptographic scheme, which uses two\nconjugate quantum bases. An eavesdropper who attempts to obtain information on\nqubits sent in one of the bases causes a disturbance to qubits sent in the\nother basis. We derive an upper bound to the accessible information in one\nbasis, for a given error rate in the conjugate basis. Independently fixing the\nerror rate in the conjugate bases, we show that both bounds can be attained\nsimultaneously by an optimal eavesdropping probe, consisting of two qubits. The\nqubits' interaction and their subsequent measurement are described explicitly.\nThese results are combined to give an expression for the optimal information an\neavesdropper can obtain for a given average disturbance when her interaction\nand measurements are performed signal by signal. Finally, the relation between\nquantum cryptography and violations of Bell's inequalities is discussed. \n\n"}
