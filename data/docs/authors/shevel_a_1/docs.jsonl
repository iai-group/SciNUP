Our experimental results from\ntwo-particle azimuthal correlations show a flattened away-side peak in central\nPb+Pb (Au+Au) collisions, only weakly depends on collision energy over the\nwhole investigated energy range - suggesting this effect originates from\nsources other than jet-medium interactions. This hypothesis is reinforced by\ngood agreement with UrQMD regardless of whether jet production was enabled in\nthe model or not. On the other hand, the amplitude of the near-side peak in\ncentral Pb+Pb (Au+Au) collisions drops visibly with decreasing collision\nenergy, flattening out around sqrt(sNN) = 8.8 GeV and turning into a depletion\nbelow that energy - possibly an effect related to the onset of deconfinement.\nFinally, hints of the ridge structure can be observed in pseudorapidity-azimuth\ncorrelation functions from central Pb+Pb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 17.3 GeV. \n\n"}

We study the formation\nof $Z(3)$ walls and associated strings in the initial transition from the\nconfining (hadronic) phase to the deconfining (QGP) phase via the so called\nKibble mechanism. Essential physics of the Kibble mechanism is contained in a\nsort of domain structure arising after any phase transition which represents\nrandom variation of the order parameter at distances beyond the typical\ncorrelation length.

Based on the\nlatest hydrodynamical simulations, heavy r-process elements cannot be\nsynthesized in the neutrino-driven winds that follow the supernova explosion.\nHowever, by artificially increasing the wind entropy, elements up to A=195 can\nbe made. In this way one can reproduce the typical behavior of high-entropy\nejecta where the r-process is expected to occur. We identify which nuclear\nphysics input is more important depending on the dynamical evolution of the\nejecta. When the evolution proceeds at high temperatures (hot r-process), an\n(n,g)-(g,n) equilibrium is reached. While at low temperature (cold r-process)\nthere is a competition between neutron captures and beta decays. In the first\nphase of the r-process, while enough neutrons are available, the most relevant\nnuclear physics input are the nuclear masses for the hot r-process and the\nneutron capture and beta-decay rates for the cold r-process. At the end of this\nphase, the abundances follow a steady beta flow for the hot r-process and a\nsteady flow of neutron captures and beta decays for the cold r-process. After\nneutrons are almost exhausted, matter decays to stability and our results show\nthat in both cases neutron captures are key for determining the final\nabundances, the position of the r-process peaks, and the formation of the\nrare-earth peak.

Since the anomalous\npeak exists in the dijet-mass region of 140 GeV with the p-pbar center-of-mass\nenergy sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, a relevant momentum fraction x of partons is roughly\n0.1. In this x region, recent HERMES semi-inclusive charged-lepton scattering\nexperiment indicated that the strange-quark distribution could be very\ndifferent from a conventional one, which has been used for many years, based on\nopposite-sign dimuon measurements in neutrino-induced deep inelastic\nscattering. We investigated effects of such variations in the strange-quark\ndistribution s(x) on the anomaly. We found that distributions of W+dijets and\nother process are affected by the strange-quark modifications in wide\ndijet-mass regions including the 140 GeV one.

This provides an integrated luminosity of 0.5 fb-1 per year on\na typical 1cm-long target. Such an extraction mode does not alter the\nperformance of the collider experiments at the LHC. With such a high\nluminosity, one can analyse quarkonium production in great details in pp, pd\nand pA collisions at sqrt(sNN)~115 GeV and at sqrt(sNN)~72 GeV in PbA\ncollisions. In a typical pp (pA) run, the obtained quarkonium yields per unit\nof rapidity are 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than those expected at RHIC and\nabout respectively 10 (70) times larger than for ALICE. In PbA, they are\ncomparable. By instrumenting the target-rapidity region, the large negative-xF\ndomain can be accessed for the first time, greatly extending previous\nmeasurements by Hera-B and E866. Such analyses should help resolving the\nquarkonium-production controversies and clear the way for gluon PDF extraction\nvia quarkonium studies. The nuclear target-species versatility provides a\nunique opportunity to study nuclear matter and the features of the hot and\ndense matter formed in PbA collisions. A polarised proton target allows the\nstudy of transverse-spin asymmetries in J/psi and Upsilon production, providing\naccess to the gluon and charm Sivers functions. \n\n"}

The experiment features high\nstatistics and better than 1 MeV resolution in the invariant mass thus allowing\nsearches for narrow resonances with the coupling to the pi p channel as low as\n5%.

The reaction is identified by a magnetless spectrometer based on wire\ndrift chambers with a hexagonal structure.

We work under the\nassumption that the spatial dependence can be formulated as a power series of\nthe nuclear thickness functions $T_A$. To reproduce the $A$-dependence over the\nentire $x$ range we need terms up to $[T_A]^4$.

The first property is the approximate scaling\nrelation between proton and neutron high-momentum distributions weighted by\ntheir relative fractions in the nucleus. The second property is the inverse\nproportionality of the strength of the high-momentum distribution of protons\nand neutrons to the same relative fractions. Based on these two properties the\nhigh-momentum distribution function for asymmetric nuclei has been modeled and\ndemonstrated that it describes reasonably well the high-momentum\ncharacteristics of light nuclei. However, the most surprising result is\nobtained for neutron rich nuclei with large A, for which a substantial relative\nabundance of high-momentum protons as compared to neutrons is predicted.

We argue that these models can be divided into two\nphenomenologically distinct classes: \"Hotspot+flow\" driven correlations, where\ninitial state correlations created by structures local in configuration space\nare collimated by transverse flow, and models where the azimuthal correlation\nis created through local partonic interactions in a high gluon density initial\nstate.\n  We further argue that the key to distinguish these two scenarios is to\nexperimentally examine the role flow plays in the ridge.

In this sense, particle-identified correlations\nare particularly promising way of testing the assumptions at the base of either\nof the two models above.\n  The successful fit of the pA ridge by hydrodynamic models \\cite{us},\ntherefore, suggests that the ridge is primarily a \"final state effect\"\ngenerated by radial expansion, although its scaling across system sizes is\nnon-trivial to reconcile with hydrodynamic expectations.

In ALICE, jets have\nbeen measured in pp, p-Pb, and Pb-Pb collisions at several collision energies.\nWhile analyses of Pb-Pb events unveil properties of the hot and dense medium\nformed in heavy-ion collisions, pp and p-Pb collisions can shed light on\nhadronization and cold nuclear matter effects in jet production.

As briefly discussed\nin [T. Duguet, G. Hagen, Phys. Rev.

Given that ESPEs provide a way to\ninterpret the many-body problem in terms of simpler theoretical ingredients,\nthe goal is to specify the terms, i.e. the exact sense and conditions, in which\nthis interpretation can be conducted meaningfully. State-of-the-art\nmulti-reference in-medium similarity renormalization group and self-consistent\nGorkov Green's function many-body calculations are employed to corroborate the\nformal analysis.

HPXe chambers are capable\nof imaging electron tracks, a feature that enhances the separation between\nsignal events (the two electrons emitted in the 0nbb decay of 136Xe) and\nbackground events, arising chiefly from single electrons of kinetic energy\ncompatible with the end-point of the 0nbb decay (Qbb ). Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction.

In this work, by\nfitting the experimental data of a number of finite nuclei together with a few\nadditional constraints on nuclear matter using the simulated annealing method,\nwe construct three Skyrme interaction parameter sets, namely, eMSL07, eMSL08\nand eMSL09, based on an extended Skyrme interaction which includes additional\nmomentum and density dependent two-body forces to effectively simulate the\nmomentum dependence of the three-body force. The three new interactions can\nreasonably describe the ground-state properties and the isoscalar giant\nmonopole resonance energies of various spherical nuclei used in the fit as well\nas the ground-state properties of many other spherical nuclei, nicely conform\nto the current knowledge on the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter,\neliminate the notorious unphysical instabilities of symmetric nuclear matter\nand pure neutron matter up to a very high density of $1.2$ fm$^{-3}$, and\nsimultaneously support heavier neutron stars with mass larger than two times\nsolar mass. One important difference of the three new interactions is about the\nprediction of the symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities, and these new\ninteractions are thus potentially useful for the determination of the largely\nuncertain high-density symmetry energy in future.

They also appear in\nobservables describing the semi-inclusive production of two hadrons in\ndeep-inelastic scattering of leptons off nucleons or in hadron-hadron\ncollisions. When a target nucleon is transversely polarized, a specific\nchiral-odd di-hadron fragmentation function can be used as the analyzer of the\nnet density of transversely polarized quarks in a transversely polarized\nnucleon, the so-called transversity distribution. The latter can be extracted\nthrough suitable single-spin asymmetries in the framework of collinear\nfactorization, thus in a much simpler framework with respect to the traditional\none in single-hadron fragmentation.

These\npairs form a valley in the $T-\\mu_B$ plane along a line of nearly constant\nentropy per baryon, $S/A$, which increases nearly linearly with bombarding\nenergy $E_{\\rm lab}$. The entropy per baryon values extracted from the data at\nthe different energies are a robust observable: it is almost independent of the\ndetails of the modeling of the eigenvolume interactions and of the specific\n$T-\\mu_B$ values obtained.

At LHC and top RHIC\nenergies, QCD matter is studied at very high temperatures and nearly vanishing\nnet-baryon densities. There is evidence that a Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) was\ncreated at experiments at RHIC and LHC. The transition from the QGP back to the\nhadron gas is found to be a smooth cross over. For larger net-baryon densities\nand lower temperatures, it is expected that the QCD phase diagram exhibits a\nrich structure, such as a first-order phase transition between hadronic and\npartonic matter which terminates in a critical point, or exotic phases like\nquarkyonic matter. The discovery of these landmarks would be a breakthrough in\nour understanding of the strong interaction and is therefore in the focus of\nvarious high-energy heavy-ion research programs. The Compressed Baryonic Matter\n(CBM) experiment at FAIR will play a unique role in the exploration of the QCD\nphase diagram in the region of high net-baryon densities, because it is\ndesigned to run at unprecedented interaction rates. High-rate operation is the\nkey prerequisite for high-precision measurements of multi-differential\nobservables and of rare diagnostic probes which are sensitive to the dense\nphase of the nuclear fireball.

The distribution of isoscalar\nmonopole strength is computed in a relativistic random phase approximation\n(RPA) using three effective interactions that have been calibrated to the\nproperties of finite nuclei and neutron stars. A non-spectral approach is\nadopted that allows for an exact treatment of the continuum without any\nreliance on discretization. For the stable calcium isotopes, no evidence of\nlow-energy monopole strength is observed, even as the 1f7/2 neutron orbital is\nbeing filled and the neutron-skin thickness progressively grows.

Since the adopted model provides the excitation energy distribution\nof these primordial fragments, it allows one to calculate the temperatures of\ndifferent isotope families and infer on the sensitivity to their isospin\ncomposition.

However, uncertainties in transport models (or model\ndependence) partly affect the reliability of the extracted result. In the\npresent work, by using the recently measured data of rapidity-dependent flows,\nwe constrain the incompressibility of nuclear matter and analyse the impact of\nmodel uncertainties on the obtained value. The method is based on the newly\nupdated version of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD)\nmodel in which the Skyrme potential energy-density functional is introduced.\nThree different Skyrme interactions which give different incompressibilities\nvarying from $K_0$=201 to 271 MeV are adopted.

The elliptic flow $v_2$ as a function of\nrapidity $y_0$ can be well described by a quadratic fit $v_2=v_{20} +\nv_{22}\\cdot y_0^2 $. It is found that the quantity $v_{2n}$ defined by\n$v_{2n}=|v_{20}|+|v_{22}|$ is quite sensitive to the incompressibility $K_0$\nand the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section, but not sensitive to the slope\nparameter $L$ of the nuclear symmetry energy.

Current efficiency correction methods are based on the assumption\nthat the tracking efficiency is strictly binomial. An unfolding technique is\nused to account for multiplicity dependent detector responses and efficiency\nvariations. A large sample of AMPT events will be used to check the validity of\nthe unfolding technique. The comparison of the various correction approaches\nshould provide important guidance towards a reliable experimental determination\nof the multiplicity cumulants. \n\n"}

In this\nproceeding we discuss the use of quark and gluon jets as independent probes,\nand how their classification allows us to uncover regions of QCD phase space\nsensitive to medium dynamics. We introduce the telescoping deconstruction (TD)\nframework to capture complete jet information and show that TD observables\nreveal fundamental properties of quark and gluon jets and their modifications\nin the medium. We draw connections to soft-drop subjet distributions and\nilluminate medium-induced jet modifications using Lund diagrams. The\nclassification is also studied using a physics-motivated, multivariate analysis\nof jet substructure observables. Moreover, we apply image-recognition\ntechniques by training a deep convolutional neural network on jet images to\nbenchmark classification performances. We find that the quark gluon\ndiscrimination performance worsens in \\textsc{Jewel}-simulated heavy ion\ncollisions due to significant soft radiation affecting soft jet substructures.\nThis work suggests a systematic framework for jet studies and facilitates\ndirect comparisons between theoretical calculations and measurements in heavy\nion collisions. \n\n"}

Therefore, they constitute ideal probes for characterising the\nQuark--Gluon Plasma (QGP) medium and for the study of its transport properties.\nIn particular, heavy quarks interact with the partonic constituents of the\nplasma, losing energy, and are expected to be sensitive to the medium\ncollective motion induced by its hydrodynamical evolution. In pp collisions,\nthe measurement of heavy-flavour hadron production provides a reference for\nheavy-ion studies, and allows also testing perturbative QCD calculations in a\nwide range of collision energies. Similar studies in p--Pb collisions help in\ndisentangling cold nuclear matter effects from modifications induced by the\npresence of a QGP medium, and are also useful to investigate the possible\nexistence of collective phenomena also in this system.

In contrast to the usual S-matrix\ncalculations, the real time approach is valid for a QGP that formed and reached\nLTE a short time after a collision and of finite lifetime ($\\sim 10-20\n\\mathrm{fm}/c$ as expected at RHIC or LHC). We point out that during such\nfinite QGP lifetime the spectrum of emitted photons carries information on the\ninitial state. There is an inherent ambiguity in separating the virtual from\nthe observable photons during the transient evolution of the QGP. We propose a\nreal time formulation to extract the photon yield which includes the initial\nstage of formation of the QGP parametrized by an effective time scale of\nformation $\\Gamma^{-1}$. This formulation coincides with the S-matrix approach\nin the infinite lifetime limit. It allows to separate the virtual cloud as well\nas the observable photons emitted during the pre- equilibrium stage from the\nyield during the QGP lifetime. We find that the lowest order contribution\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_{em})$ which does \\emph{not} contribute to the S-matrix\napproach, is of the same order of or larger than the S-matrix contribution\nduring the lifetime of the QGP for a typical formation time $\\sim 1\n\\mathrm{fm}/c$. The yield for momenta $\\gtrsim 3 \\mathrm{Gev}/c$ features a\npower law fall-off $\\sim T^3 \\Gamma^2/k^{5}$ and is larger than that obtained\nwith the S-matrix for momenta $\\geq 4 \\mathrm{Gev}/c$. We provide a\ncomprehensive numerical comparison between the real time and S-matrix yields\nand study the dynamics of the build-up of the photon cloud and the different\ncontributions to the radiative energy loss. The reliability of the current\nestimates on photon emission is discussed. \n\n"}

An inequality relating the partial widths of these nucleon\nstates in the N+nucleon channel to the width of the theta+ is derived for this\nmodel under the assuming ideal mixing and that the only significant exact SU(3)\nsymmetry violations are the result of ideal mixing, threshold effects and the\nmasses of pseudo-Goldstone bosons. This inequality is badly violated if the\nstates in the multiplet are the N*(1440) and the N*(1710) and if the recent\nbounds extracted for the theta+ width are reliable.

The shape of the momentum distribution\nchanges between peripheral and central collisions. Simultaneous analysis of all\nthe p_T spectra indicates radial collective expansion, consistent with\npredictions of hydrodynamic models. Hydrodynamic analysis of the spectra shows\nthat the expansion velocity increases with collision centrality and collision\nenergy. This expansion boosts the particle momenta, causing the yield from soft\nprocesses to exceed that for hard to large transverse momentum, perhaps as\nlarge as 3 GeV/c. \n\n"}

Abstract: The centrality dependence of (multi-)strange hadron abundances is studied for\nPb(158 AGeV)Pb reactions and compared to p(158 GeV)Pb collisions. The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity. For Omega's, the predicted enhancement can be as\nlarge as one order of magnitude. Comparisons of Pb-Pb data to proton induced\nasymmetric (p-A) collisions are hampered due to the predicted strong asymmetry\nin the various rapidity distributions of the different (strange) particle\nspecies. In p-Pb collisions, strangeness is locally (in rapidity) not\nconserved.

The signal\nshould be observable even if multiple domains of D$\\chi$C form provided the\naverage number of pions per domain is significantly larger than unity. The\nvariance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used\neven if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On\nthe other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral\npions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic\nregions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.\nHere we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts\nin the data.
