The second paradox is a clear\nsignature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments, but no\nevidence as yet of the corresponding hole pockets of approximately double the\nfrequency of the electron pocket. This hole pockets should be present if the\nFermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave, assuming\nthat Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number\nof charge carriers holds. Here we provide possible resolutions of these\napparent paradoxes from the commensurate $d$-density wave theory.

This scaling behavior is numerically\nchecked by DMRG simulations of the one-dimensional (1D) Hubbard model. In\nparticular, the particle density and its correlations show crossovers among\ndifferent regimes: for strongly repulsive interactions they approach those of a\nspinless Fermi gas, for weak interactions those of a free Fermi gas, and for\nstrongly attractive interactions they match those of a gas of hard-core bosonic\nmolecules.\n  The large-N behavior of systems at fixed N/l corresponds to a 1D trap\nthermodynamic limit.

We find that the life time of the\nwinding number in imaginary time diverges as a power of the system length $L$.\nThe energy can be computed within this time (i.e., it converges toward a\n\"quasi-eigenvalue\" before the winding number decays) and agrees for large $L$\nwith the domain-wall energy computed in an open lattice with boundary\nmodifications enforcing a domain wall. Constructing a simplified two-state\nmodel and using the imaginary-time behavior from the simulations as input, we\nfind that the real-time decay rate out of the initial winding sector is\nexponentially small in $L$.

In this paper, we\nmake a contribution to this issue by investigating superfluid density response\nfunction in celebrated Kondo-Heisenberg model. To be specific, we derive\ncorresponding formalism from an effective fermionic large-N mean-field pairing\nHamiltonian, whose pairing interaction is assumed to originate from effective\nlocal antiferromagnetic exchange interaction.

Furthermore, it was recently shown that if the one-clean qubit model is\nclassically efficiently simulated, the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the\nsecond level. A disadvantage of the one-clean qubit model is, however, that the\nclean qubit is too clean: for example, in realistic NMR experiments,\npolarizations are not enough high to have the perfectly pure qubit. In this\npaper, we consider a more realistic one-clean qubit model, where the clean\nqubit is not clean, but depolarized. We first show that, for any polarization,\na multiplicative-error calculation of the output probability distribution of\nthe model is possible in a classical polynomial time if we take an\nappropriately large multiplicative error. The result is in a strong contrast to\nthat of the ideal one-clean qubit model where the classical efficient\nmultiplicative-error calculation (or even the sampling) with the same amount of\nerror causes the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. We next show that, for\nany polarization lower-bounded by an inverse polynomial, a classical efficient\nsampling (in terms of a sufficiently small multiplicative error or an\nexponentially-small additive error) of the output probability distribution of\nthe model is impossible unless BQP is contained in the second level of the\npolynomial hierarchy, which suggests the hardness of the classical efficient\nsimulation of the one non-clean qubit model. \n\n"}

First, we\nreformulate the fracton phenomenon in terms of an emergent center of mass\nquantum number, and we show how an effective attraction arises from the\nprinciples of locality and conservation of center of mass. This interaction\nbetween fractons is always attractive and can be recast in geometric language,\nwith a geodesic-like formulation, thereby satisfying the expected properties of\na gravitational force. This force will generically be short-ranged, but we\ndiscuss how the power-law behavior of Newtonian gravity can arise under certain\nconditions. We then show that, while an isolated fracton is immobile, fractons\nare endowed with finite inertia by the presence of a large-scale distribution\nof other fractons, in a concrete manifestation of Mach's principle. Our\nformalism provides suggestive hints that matter plays a fundamental role, not\nonly in perturbing, but in creating the background space in which it\npropagates. \n\n"}

We obtain our results in a random quantum circuit model that is\nconstrained to have a conservation law. We find that a generic spreading\noperator consists of two parts: (i) a conserved part which comprises the weight\nof the spreading operator on the local conserved densities, whose dynamics is\ndescribed by diffusive charge spreading. This conserved part also acts as a\nsource that steadily emits a flux of (ii) non-conserved operators. This\nemission leads to dissipation in the operator hydrodynamics, with the\ndissipative process being the conversion of operator weight from local\nconserved operators to nonconserved, at a rate set by the local diffusion\ncurrent. The emitted nonconserved parts then spread ballistically at a\nbutterfly speed, thus becoming highly nonlocal and hence essentially\nnon-observable, thereby acting as the \"reservoir\" that facilitates the\ndissipation.

Due to the divergent density of states of the surface Majorana\nflat bands, the surface order parameter and the surface impurity play essential\nroles in determining the surface properties. In this work, we studied the\neffect of the surface order parameter and the surface impurity on the surface\nMajorana flat bands of half-Heusler superconductors based on the Luttinger\nmodel. To be specific, we consider the topological nodal-line superconducting\nphase induced by the singlet-quintet pairing mixing, classify all the possible\ntranslationally invariant order parameters for the surface states according to\nirreducible representations of $C_{3v}$ point group, and demonstrate that any\nenergetically favorable order parameter needs to break time-reversal symmetry.\nWe further discuss the energy splitting in the energy spectrum of surface\nMajorana flat bands induced by different order parameters and non-magnetic or\nmagnetic impurities.

In\nthis paper, we closely examine the conditions for realizing a robust chiral\n$p-$wave order in this system, rather than conventional $s$-wave\nsuperconductivity. Further, within the $p$-wave superconducting phase, we\nidentify parameter regimes where impurity bound (Shiba) states depend crucially\non the existence of the chiral $p-$wave order, and distinguish them from other\nregimes where the chiral $p-$wave order does exist but the impurity-induced\nsubgap bound states cannot be used as evidence for it.

The\ncuprates seems to exhibit statistics, dimensionality and phase transitions in\nnovel ways. The nature of excitations [i.e. quasiparticle or collective] must\nbe understood. The Hubbard model captures some of the behaviour of the phase\ntransitions in these materials. On the other hand the phases such as stripes in\nthese materials bear relationship to quantum group or string-like solutions.\nOne thus expects that the relevant solutions of Hubbard model may thus be\nwritten in terms of stringy solutions. In short this approach may lead to the\nnon-perturbative formualtion of Hubbard and other condensed matter\nHamiltonians. The question arises that how a 1-d based symmetry such as quantum\ngroups can be relevant in describing a 3-d [spatial dimensions] system such as\ncuprates. The answer lies in the key observation that strings which are 1-d\nobjects can be used to describe physics in $d$ dimensions.

As the pair potential grows through the\nsuperconducting transition, each degenerate Landau level in the normal state\nsplits into quasiparticle bands in the magnetic Brillouin zone. This brings\nLandau-level broadening, which in turn leads to the extra dHvA oscillation\ndamping in the vortex state. We perform extensive numerical calculations for\nthree-dimensional systems with various gap structures. It is thereby shown that\n(i) this Landau-level broadening is directly connected with the average gap at\nH=0 along each Fermi-surface orbit perpendicular to the field H; (ii) the extra\ndHvA oscillation attenuation is caused by the broadening around each extremal\norbit.

The first\nmodel involves coherent interlayer transport and makes use of results of\nsemi-classical or Bloch-Boltzmann transport theory. The second model involves\nweakly incoherent interlayer transport where the electron is scattered many\ntimes within a layer before tunneling into the next layer. The results are\nrelevant to the interpretation of experiments on angular-dependent\nmagnetoresistance oscillations (AMRO) in quasi-one- and quasi-two-dimensional\nmetals. We find that the dependence of the magnetoresistance on the direction\nof the magnetic field is identical for both models except when the field is\nalmost parallel to the layers. An important implication of this result is that\na three-dimensional Fermi surface is not necessary for the observation of the\nYamaji and Danner oscillations seen in quasi-two- and quasi-one-dimensional\nmetals, respectively. A universal expression is given for the dependence of the\nresistance at AMRO maxima and minima on the magnetic field and scattering time\n(and thus the temperature).

We extend our analysis to\nthe doublet scalar fields and show that the symmetry is broken from G_{doublet}\n= U(1) x SU(2) x SU(2)_f x P to H_{doublet} = SU(2)' x P. Finally we obtain the\nexact vacuum of the model with the multiplet (q_1, q_2,..., q_{2j+1}) = (j,\nj,..., j) and show that the symmetry is broken from G_{multiplet} = U(1) x\nSU(2) x SU(2j+1)_f x CP to H_{multiplet} = SU(2)' x CP'. Our results caution\nthat a careful analysis of dynamics of the topological defects is required for\nconstruction of a reliable model that possesses such a defect structure. \n\n"}

Charge condensation is\nshown to appear so as to complement the fermion anti-fermion condensate, which\nbreaks the flavor U(2N) symmetry and causes fermion mass generation. The\nsolutions to the Schwinger-Dyson gap equation show that the fermion self-energy\ncontributes to the induction of a finite fermion density and/or fermion mass.\nThe magnetization can be supported by charge condensation for theories with the\nChern-Simons coefficient $\\kappa=N e^2/2 \\pi$, and $\\kappa=N e^2/4 \\pi$, under\nthe Gauss law constraint. For $\\kappa=N e^2/4 \\pi$, both the magnetic field and\nthe fermion mass are simultaneously generated in the half-filled ground state,\nwhich breaks the U(2N) symmetry as well as the Lorentz symmetry. \n\n"}
