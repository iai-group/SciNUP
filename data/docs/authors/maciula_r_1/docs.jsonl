We demonstrate this approach by examining the recent\nclaim of 0912.0552 regarding the possible DM origin of the 2.5 keV line in\nChandra observations of the Milky Way satellite known as Willman 1. Our\nconservative strategy is to adopt a relatively large dark mass for Willman 1\nand relatively small dark masses for the comparison objects. We analyze\narchival observations by XMM-Newton of M31 and Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy\n(dSph) and Chandra observations of Sculptor dSph. By performing a conservative\nanalysis of X-ray spectra, we show the absence of a DM decay line with\nparameters consistent with those of 0912.0552. For M31, the observations of the\nregions between 10 and 20 kpc from the center, where the uncertainties in the\nDM distribution are minimal, make a strong exclusion at the level above\n10sigma. The minimal estimate for the amount of DM in the central 40 kpc of M31\nis provided by the model of 0912.4133, assuming the stellar disk's mass to\nlight ratio ~8 and almost constant DM density within a core of 28 kpc. Even in\nthis case one gets an exclusion at 5.7sigma from central region of M31 whereas\nmodeling all processed data from M31 and Fornax produces more than 14sigma\nexclusion. Therefore, despite possible systematic uncertainties, we exclude the\npossibility that the spectral feature at ~2.5 keV found in 0912.0552 is a DM\ndecay line. We conclude, however, that the search for DM decay line, although\ndemanding prolonged observations of well-studied dSphs, M31 outskirts and other\nsimilar objects, is rather promising, as the nature of a possible signal can be\nchecked. An (expected) non-observation of a DM decay signal in the planned\nobservations of Willman 1 should not discourage further dedicated observations. \n\n"}

In the two body Dirac equations formulated in\nconstraint dynamics, the short-distance attraction for these states for point\nparticles leads to a quasipotential that behaves near the origin as\n-\\alpha^2/r^2. Both 1S0 and 3P0 states admit two types of eigenstates with\ndrastically different behaviors for the radial wave function u=r\\psi. One type\nof states, with u growing as r^{1+\\sqrt(1-4*\\alpha^2)/2} at small r, will be\ncalled usual states. The other type of states with u growing as\nr^{(1-\\sqrt(1-4*\\alpha^2))/2} will be called peculiar states. Both of the usual\nand peculiar eigenstates have admissible behaviors at short distances. The\nusual bound 1S0 states possess attributes the same as those one usually\nencounters in QED and QCD. In contrast, the peculiar bound 1S0 states, yet to\nbe observed, have distinctly different bound state properties and scattering\nphase shifts. For the 3P0 states, the usual solutions lead to the standard\nbound state energies and no resonance, but resonances have been found for the\npeculiar states whose energies depend on the description of the internal\nstructure of the charges, the mass of the constituent, and the coupling\nconstant. The existence of both usual and peculiar eigenstates in the same\nsystem leads to the non-self-adjoint property of the mass operator and two\nnon-orthogonal complete sets. The mass operator can be made self-adjoint with a\nsingle complete set of admissible states by introducing a new peculiarity\nquantum number and an enlarged Hilbert space. \n\n"}

Special attention is paid to the concept of the Pomeron trajectory\nintroduced for description of total, elastic and diffractive cross sections at\nhigh energies and to the emergence of the dynamics of multi-Pomeron\ninteractions.The role of large longitudinal distances and color coherent\nphenomena for the understanding of inelastic diffraction in hadron-hadron\nscattering and deep inelastic scattering is emphasized. The connection of these\nphenomena to the cancellation of the contribution of the Glauber approximation\nin hadron-nucleus collisions and to the understanding of the Gribov-Glauber\napproximation is explained. The presence of different scales in perturbative\nQCD due to masses of heavy quarks has led to the emergence of numerous new\nphenomena including non-universality of the slopes of Regge trajectories made\nof light and heavy quarks and non-universal energy dependence of elastic cross\nsections. The application of the perturbative QCD techniques allowed us to\ncalculate from the first principles the interaction of small transverse size\ncolor singlets with hadrons leading to the development of the quantitative\ntheory of hard exclusive reactions and to the successful prediction of many\nregularities in hard large mass diffraction.

Due to the\nNambu-Goldstone boson's nature, the TD can be as light as the LHC boson that\nhas been discovered at around 125 GeV. We discuss the size of the TD mass and\nthe coupling properties relevant to the LHC study. It turns out that the TD\ncouplings to the standard model (SM) particles take the same form as those of\nthe SM Higgs boson, except the essentially distinguishable two ingredients: i)\nthe overall coupling strengths set by the decay constant related to the\nspontaneous breaking of the scale invariance, which is in general not equal to\nthe electroweak scale; ii) the couplings to photons and gluons which can\ninclude extra contributions from technifermion loops and hence can be enhanced\ncompared to the SM Higgs case. To be concrete, we take the one-family\ntechnicolor model to explore the TD LHC phenomenology at 125 GeV. It is shown\nthat the TD gives the signal consistent with the currently reported LHC data,\nnotably can explain the excess in the diphoton channel, due to the extra\ncontributions to digluon and diphoton couplings coming from the one-family\ntechnifermion loops. \n\n"}

We ascribed this difference to a\nnon-unitary interaction of the produced final state rho_f(S) with a universal\nquantum environment in the Universe.

It is usually thought that a specified order of azimuthal cumulant,\nfor the most part, linearly produces flow harmonic of the same order. In this\nwork, we carry out a systematic study on the connection between cumulants and\nflow harmonics using a hydrodynamic code called NeXSPheRIO.

This\ncovariant basis provides an inventory of all the possible interaction terms for\ngauge and non-gauge theories of fields for these representations.

These stable particles are typically a\nsubdominant DM component, but because they are produced with a large Lorentz\nboost in this process, they can be detected in large volume terrestrial\nexperiments via neutral-current-like interactions with electrons or nuclei.\nThis novel DM signal thus combines the production mechanism associated with\nindirect detection experiments (i.e. galactic DM annihilation) with the\ndetection mechanism associated with direct detection experiments (i.e. DM\nscattering off terrestrial targets). Such processes are generically present in\nmulti-component DM scenarios or those with non-minimal DM stabilization\nsymmetries. As a proof of concept, we present a model of two-component thermal\nrelic DM, where the dominant heavy DM species has no tree-level interactions\nwith the standard model and thus largely evades direct and indirect DM bounds.\nInstead, its thermal relic abundance is set by annihilation into a subdominant\nlighter DM species, and the latter can be detected in the boosted channel via\nthe same annihilation process occurring today. Especially for dark sector\nmasses in the 10 MeV-10 GeV range, the most promising signals are electron\nscattering events pointing toward the galactic center. These can be detected in\nexperiments designed for neutrino physics or proton decay, in particular\nSuper-K and its upgrade Hyper-K, as well as the PINGU/MICA extensions of\nIceCube.

However, finding consistent scenarios for\ninflationary magnetogenesis is a challenging theoretical problem. The\nrequirements to avoid an excessive production of electromagnetic energy, and to\navoid entering a strong coupling regime characterized by large values for the\nelectromagnetic coupling constant, typically allow one to generate only a tiny\namplitude of magnetic field during inflation.

Such couplings give additional freedom to control the\ntime-dependence of the electromagnetic coupling constant during inflation. This\nfact allows us to find conditions to avoid the strong coupling problems that\naffect many of the existing models of magnetogenesis.

In this work, we consider\nscenarios where thermal dark matter annihilates via scalar mediators that are\ncolored and/or electrically charged. We show how partial wave unitarity places\nupper bounds on the masses and couplings on both the dark matter and mediators.\nTo do this, we employ effective field theories with dark matter as well as\nthree flavors of sleptons or squarks with minimum flavor violation. For Dirac\n(Majorana) dark matter that annihilates via mediators charged as left-handed\nsleptons, we find an upper bound around 45 TeV (7 TeV) for both the mediator\nand dark matter masses, respectively. These bounds vary as the square root of\nthe number of colors times the number of flavors involved. Therefore the bounds\ndiminish by root two for right handed selectrons. The bounds increase by root\nthree and root six for right and left handed squarks, respectively. Finally,\nbecause of the interest in natural models, we also focus on an effective field\ntheory with only stops.

The K-pi+\ns-wave amplitude from our analysis is reasonably consistent with those\nextracted from the E791 model independent partial-wave analysis; the hadronic\nrescattering and the coupling to the rho(770) bar K0 channel play a major role\nhere. We also find that the dressed D+ decay vertices have phases, induced by\nthe strong rescatterings, that strongly depend on the momenta of the final\npseudoscalar mesons. Although the conventional isobar-type analyses have\nassumed the phases to be constant, this common assumption is not supported by\nour more microscopic viewpoint. \n\n"}

At low baryon density, n_B < ~\n2n_s (n_s: nuclear saturation density), we utilize purely hadronic equations of\nstate that are constrained by empirical observations at density n_B ~ n_s and\nneutron star radii. At high density, n_B > ~ 5n_s, we use the percolated quark\nmatter equations of state which must be very stiff to pass the two-solar mass\nconstraints. The intermediate domain at 2 < n_B/n_s < 5 is described as neither\npurely hadronic nor percolated quark matter, and the equations of state are\ninferred by interpolating hadronic and percolated quark matter equations of\nstate. Possible forms of the interpolation are severely restricted by the\ncondition on the (square of) speed of sound, 0 < c_s^2 < 1. The characteristics\nof the 3-window equation of state are compared with those of conventional\nhybrid and self-bound quark matters.

As shown in recent\nworks using the light-front perturbation theory, solutions to these recursions\nnaturally collapse into gauge invariant and gauge-dependent components, at\nleast for some helicity configurations. In this work, we show that such\nstructure is helicity independent and emerges from analytic properties of\nmatrix elements of Wilson line operators, where the slope of the straight gauge\npath is shifted in a certain complex direction. This is similar to the\nprocedure leading to the Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW) recursion, however\nwe apply a complex shift to the Wilson line slope instead of the external\nmomenta. While in the original BCFW procedure the boundary integrals over the\ncomplex shift vanish for certain deformations, here they are non-zero and are\nequal to the off-shell amplitudes. The main result can thus be summarized as\nfollows: we derive a decomposition of a helicity-fixed off-shell current into\ngauge invariant component given by a matrix element of a straight Wilson line\nplus a reminder given by a sum of products of gauge invariant and gauge\ndependent quantities.

In this paper, we consider models with a $750$ GeV\nscalar and vector-like particles, which couple each other through Yukawa\ncouplings.

We also study the $pp\\rightarrow l_i^+ \\nu \\gamma$\nprocess, which is dominant for low $m_N$ masses if tensorial one-loop generated\nnew physics contributions are present. This channel could be observed at the\nLHC with the aid of non-pointing photons observables and cuts on the\ndisplacement between the prompt lepton and the photon. \n\n"}

The SM matter and Higgs fields propagate from\nthe UV brane down to this intermediate brane only, while gauge and gravity\nfields propagate in the entire bulk. Such a configuration renders the lightest\ngauge Kaluza-Klein (KK) states within LHC reach, simultaneously satisfying\nflavor and CP constraints. In addition, the usual leading decay modes of the\nlightest KK gauge bosons into top and Higgs bosons are suppressed. This effect\npermits erstwhile subdominant channels to become significant. These include\nflavor-universal decays to SM fermions and Higgs bosons, and a novel channel -\ndecay to a radion and a SM gauge boson, followed by radion decay to a pair of\nSM gauge bosons.

This requires to give a precise and gauge-invariant meaning to\nthe underlying physics. This is complicated by the fact that concepts like the\nHiggs vacuum expectation value or the separation between confinement and the\nBEH effect loose their meaning beyond perturbation theory. This is addressed by\ncarefully constructing the corresponding theory space and the quantum phase\ndiagram. The physical spectrum needs then to be also given in terms of\ngauge-invariant, i. e. composite, states. Using gauge-invariant perturbation\ntheory, as developed by Froehlich, Morchio, and Strocchi, it is possible to\nrederive conventional perturbation theory. This derivation explicitly shows why\nthe description of the standard model in terms of the unphysical,\ngauge-dependent, elementary states of the Higgs and W-bosons and Z-boson, but\nalso of the elementary fermions, is adequate and successful.

Abstract: We provide a complete answer to the following question: what are the flavour\ngroups and representations providing, in the symmetric limit, an approximate\ndescription of lepton masses and mixings? We assume that neutrinos masses are\ndescribed by the Weinberg operator. We show that the pattern of lepton masses\nand mixings only depends on the dimension, type (real, pseudoreal, complex),\nand equivalence of the irreducible components of the flavour representation,\nand we find only six viable cases. In all cases the neutrinos are either\nanarchical or have an inverted hierarchical spectrum. In the context of SU(5)\nunification, only the anarchical option is allowed. Therefore, if the hint of a\nnormal hierarchical spectrum were confirmed, we would conclude (under the above\nassumption) that symmetry breaking effects must play a primary role in the\nunderstanding of neutrino flavour observables. In order to obtain the above\nresults, we develop a simple algorithm to determine the form of the lepton\nmasses and mixings directly from the structure of the decomposition of the\nflavour representation in irreducible components, without the need to specify\nthe form of the lepton mass matrices. \n\n"}

In particular, the polarized DiFFs can be\naccessed in electron-positron annihilation by measuring azimuthal correlations\nbetween two back-to-back pairs of hadrons in the center of mass system, where\nthe relevant structure functions can be expressed as convolutions of two\n(polarized) DiFFs. Here we explore the advantages of measuring the inclusive\nback-to-back production of a single hadron on one side against a hadron pair on\nthe opposite side of the detector in two jet events. The leading twist cross\nsection for this process contains convolutions of the corresponding single\nhadron FFs on one side and the DiFFs for the hadron pair on the other side,\nwhich furnishes several interesting new opportunities. A measurement of the\nunpolarized cross section with a number of different types of observed hadrons\nwill help in untangling the quark flavor dependence of the unpolarized DiFFs,\nwhen the results are analyzed together with the inclusive measurements of\ndihadron pairs, such as those recently performed by the $\\texttt{BELLE}$\ncollaboration.

We\nshow that constraints imposed by chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking\ndetermine the structure of low-energy effective partition functions for the\nDirac spectrum. We thus derive exact results for the low-lying eigenvalues of\nthe QCD Dirac operator. We argue that the statistical properties of these\neigenvalues are universal and can be described by a random matrix theory with\nthe global symmetries of the QCD partition function. The total number of such\neigenvalues increases with the square root of the Euclidean four-volume.

The construction depends on a generalization of the\nBanks-Casher theorem. It exploits the fact that {\\it all} dynamics sensitive to\nspontaneous chiral symmetry breaking observables in correlation functions arise\nfrom fermion modes of zero virtuality (in the infinite volume limit), while\nsuch modes make {\\it no} contribution to any of the dynamics which preserves\nchiral symmetry.

In such theories it is difficult to treat\nsquarks and sleptons as the light fields in the inflationary period. In the\ngeneric supergravity theories all flat directions, including moduli, are\ngetting curvature of order the Hubble constant. However, for the\ngauge-nonsinglet flat directions radiative contribution to the curvature\n(induced by renormalizable gauge interactions) may be dominant. \n\n"}
