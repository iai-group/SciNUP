We show that for a broad class of\nderived stacks, called perfect stacks, algebraic and geometric operations on\ntheir categories of sheaves are compatible. We identify the category of sheaves\non a fiber product with the tensor product of the categories of sheaves on the\nfactors. We also identify the category of sheaves on a fiber product with\nfunctors between the categories of sheaves on the factors (thus realizing\nfunctors as integral transforms, generalizing a theorem of Toen for ordinary\nschemes). As a first application, for a perfect stack X, consider QC(X) with\nits usual monoidal tensor product. Then our main results imply the equivalence\nof the Drinfeld center (or Hochschild cohomology category) of QC(X), the trace\n(or Hochschild homology category) of QC(X) and the category of sheaves on the\nloop space of X.

Also, we introduce an efficient\nway to compute arithmetically well-behaved functions on jacobians, a method to\nexpand cuspforms in quasi-linear time, and a trick making the computation of\nthe image of a Frobenius element by a modular Galois representation more\neffective.

Indeed, on page\n78/79 of this book, Macaulay is saying the following: \" A polynomial ideal\n$\\mathfrak{a} \\subset k[{\\chi}\\_1$,..., ${\\chi}\\_n]=k[\\chi]$ is of the {\\it\nprincipal class} and thus {\\it unmixed} if it has rank $r$ and is generated by\n$r$ polynomials. Having in mind this definition, a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nwith associated prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = rad(\\mathfrak{q})$ is such that any\nideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\\mathfrak{a} \\subset\n\\mathfrak{q}$ determines a primary ideal of greater {\\it multiplicity} over\n$k$. In particular, we have $dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/({\\chi}\\_1$,...,${\\chi}\\_n)^2)=n+1$\nbecause, passing to a system of PD equations for one unknown $y$, the\nparametric jets are \\{${y,y\\_1, ...,y\\_n}$\\} but any ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of\nthe principal class with $\\mathfrak{a}\\subset ({\\chi}\\_1,{\\^a},{\\chi}\\_n)^2$ is\ncontained into a {\\it simple} ideal, that is a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nsuch that $rad(\\mathfrak{q})=\\mathfrak{m}\\in max(k[\\chi])$ is a maximal and\nthus prime ideal with $dim\\_k(M)=dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/\\mathfrak{q})=2^n$ at least.\nAccordingly, any primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$ may not be a member of the\nprimary decomposition of an unmixed ideal $\\mathfrak{a} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{q}$\nof the principal class. Otherwise, $\\mathfrak{q}$ is said to be of the {\\it\nprincipal noetherian class} \". Our aim is to explain this result in a modern\nlanguage and to illustrate it by providing a similar example for $n=4$. The\nimportance of such an example is that it allows for the first time to exhibit\nsymbols which are $2,3,4$-acyclic without being involutive. Another interest of\nthis example is that it has properties quite similar to the ones held by the\nsystem of conformal Killing equations which are still not known. For this\nreason, we have put all the examples at the end of the paper and each one is\npresented in a rather independent way though a few among them are quite tricky.\nMeanwhile, the second purpose is to prove that the methods developped by\nMacaulay in order to study {\\it unmixed polynomial ideals} are only particular\nexamples of new formal differential geometric techniques that have been\nintroduced recently in order to study {\\it pure differential modules}. However\nthese procedures are based on the formal theory of systems of ordinary\ndifferential (OD) or partial differential (PD) equations, in particular on a\nsystematic use of the Spencer operator, and are still not acknowledged by the\nalgebraic community. \n\n"}

This is the supergravity counterpart of the\nfamiliar concept of twisting supersymmetric field theories. In this paper, we\ngive conjectural descriptions of type IIA and IIB supergravity in $10$\ndimensions. Our conjectural descriptions are in terms of the closed-string\nfield theories associated to certain topological string theories, and we\nconjecture that these topological string theories are twists of the physical\nstring theories. For type IIB, the results of arXiv:1505.6703 show that our\ncandidate twisted supergravity theory admits a unique quantization in\nperturbation theory. This is despite the fact that the theories, like the\noriginal physical theories, are non-renormalizable. Although we do not prove\nour conjectures, we amass considerable evidence.

We define a\nkernel for a 2D TQFT and use an algebraic definition for a topological\nrecursion to define how to twist a standard topological recursion by a 2D TQFT.\nThe A-model side enumerative problem consists of counting cell graphs where in\naddition vertices are decorated by elements in a Frobenius algebra, and which\nare a twisted version of the generalized Catalan numbers of\nDumitrescu-Mulase-Safnuk-Sorkin. We show that the function which counts these\ndecorated graphs satisfies a twisted version of the same type of recursion of\nCatalan numbers with respect to the edge-contraction axioms of\nDumitrescu-Mulase. The path we follow to pass from the A-model side to the\nremodelled B-model side is to use a discrete Laplace transform based on the\nideas of the group of Mulase. We show that a twisted version by a 2D TQFT of\nthe Eynard-Orantin differentials satisfies a twisted generalization of the\ntopological recursion formula. We shall illustrate these results with a toy\nmodel for the theory arising from the orbifold cohomology of the classifying\nspace of a finite group. In this example, the graphs are drawn on an orbifold\npunctured Riemann surface and defined out of the moduli space of stable\nmorphisms from twisted curves to the classifying space of a finite group. In\nparticular we show that the cotangent class intersection numbers on this moduli\nspace satisfy a twisted Eynard-Orantin topological recursion and we derive an\norbifold DVV equation as a consequence of it.

Such curves, together with\nreal Riemann surfaces, form the real locus of the moduli space $\\mathcal M_g$.\nThis paper deals with the classification of pseudoreal curves according to the\nstructure of their automorphism group. We follow two different approaches\nexisting in the literature: one coming from number theory, dealing more\ngenerally with fields of moduli of projective curves, and the other from\ncomplex geometry, through the theory of NEC groups. Using the first approach,\nwe prove that the automorphism group of a pseudoreal Riemann surface $X$ is\nabelian if $X/Z({\\rm Aut}(X))$ has genus zero, where $Z({\\rm Aut}(X))$ is the\ncenter of ${\\rm Aut}(X)$. This includes the case of $p$-gonal Riemann surfaces,\nalready known by results of Huggins and Kontogeorgis. By means of the second\napproach and of elementary properties of group extensions, we show that $X$ is\nnot pseudoreal if the center of $G={\\rm Aut}(X)$ is trivial and either ${\\rm\nOut}(G)$ contains no involutions or ${\\rm Inn}(G)$ has a group complement in\n${\\rm Aut}(G)$.

This\ninvolves two components of independent interest.\n  The first is the notion of a rigid hamiltonian torus action. This natural\ncondition, for torus actions on a Kaehler manifold, was introduced locally in\npart I, but such actions turn out to be remarkably well behaved globally,\nleading to a fairly explicit classification: up to a blow-up, compact Kaehler\nmanifolds with a rigid hamiltonian torus action are bundles of toric Kaehler\nmanifolds.\n  The second idea is a special case of toric geometry, which we call\northotoric. We prove that orthotoric Kaehler manifolds are diffeomorphic to\ncomplex projective space, but we extend our analysis to orthotoric orbifolds,\nwhere the geometry is much richer. We thus obtain new examples of\nKaehler--Einstein 4-orbifolds.\n  Combining these two themes, we prove that compact Kaehler manifolds with\nhamiltonian 2-forms are covered by blow-downs of projective bundles over\nKaehler products, and we describe explicitly how the Kaehler metrics with a\nhamiltonian 2-form are parameterized. We explain how this provides a context\nfor constructing new examples of extremal Kaehler metrics - in particular a\nsubclass of such metrics which we call weakly Bochner-flat.\n  We also provide a self-contained treatment of the theory of compact toric\nKaehler manifolds, since we need it and find the existing literature\nincomplete. \n\n"}

The idea is then to consider the whole family of locally defined\nsheaves of WKB operators as the deformation-quantization of $X$.
