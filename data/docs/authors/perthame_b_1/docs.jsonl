An approximate solution to the\ninpainting problem is obtained by numerically approximating the steady state\nsolution of the 2D NSE vorticity transport equation, and simultaneously solving\nthe Poisson problem between the vorticity and stream function, in the region to\nbe inpainted. This elegant approach allows one to produce an approximate\nsolution to the image inpainting problem by using techniques from computational\nfluid dynamics. Recently, the three-dimensional (3D) Navier-Stokes-Voight (NSV)\nmodel of viscoelastic fluid, was suggested by Cao et. al. as an inviscid\nregularization to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSE).

The focus is put\nhere on stability with respect to perturbations of the same period as the wave,\nfor KdV-like systems of one-dimensional Hamiltonian PDEs. Stability criteria\nare derived and investigated first in a general abstract framework, and then\napplied to three basic examples that are very closely related, and ubiquitous\nin mathematical physics, namely, a quasilinear version of the generalized\nKorteweg--de Vries equation (qKdV), and the Euler--Korteweg system in both\nEulerian coordinates (EKE) and in mass Lagrangian coordinates (EKL). Those\ncriteria consist of a necessary condition for spectral stability, and of a\nsufficient condition for orbital stability. Both are expressed in terms of a\nsingle function, the abbreviated action integral along the orbits of waves in\nthe phase plane, which is the counterpart of the solitary waves moment of\ninstability introduced by Boussinesq. Regarding solitary waves, the celebrated\nGrillakis--Shatah--Strauss stability criteria amount to looking for the sign of\nthe second derivative of the moment of instability with respect to the wave\nspeed.

Indeed, on page\n78/79 of this book, Macaulay is saying the following: \" A polynomial ideal\n$\\mathfrak{a} \\subset k[{\\chi}\\_1$,..., ${\\chi}\\_n]=k[\\chi]$ is of the {\\it\nprincipal class} and thus {\\it unmixed} if it has rank $r$ and is generated by\n$r$ polynomials. Having in mind this definition, a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nwith associated prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = rad(\\mathfrak{q})$ is such that any\nideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\\mathfrak{a} \\subset\n\\mathfrak{q}$ determines a primary ideal of greater {\\it multiplicity} over\n$k$. In particular, we have $dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/({\\chi}\\_1$,...,${\\chi}\\_n)^2)=n+1$\nbecause, passing to a system of PD equations for one unknown $y$, the\nparametric jets are \\{${y,y\\_1, ...,y\\_n}$\\} but any ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of\nthe principal class with $\\mathfrak{a}\\subset ({\\chi}\\_1,{\\^a},{\\chi}\\_n)^2$ is\ncontained into a {\\it simple} ideal, that is a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nsuch that $rad(\\mathfrak{q})=\\mathfrak{m}\\in max(k[\\chi])$ is a maximal and\nthus prime ideal with $dim\\_k(M)=dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/\\mathfrak{q})=2^n$ at least.\nAccordingly, any primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$ may not be a member of the\nprimary decomposition of an unmixed ideal $\\mathfrak{a} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{q}$\nof the principal class. Otherwise, $\\mathfrak{q}$ is said to be of the {\\it\nprincipal noetherian class} \". Our aim is to explain this result in a modern\nlanguage and to illustrate it by providing a similar example for $n=4$. The\nimportance of such an example is that it allows for the first time to exhibit\nsymbols which are $2,3,4$-acyclic without being involutive. Another interest of\nthis example is that it has properties quite similar to the ones held by the\nsystem of conformal Killing equations which are still not known. For this\nreason, we have put all the examples at the end of the paper and each one is\npresented in a rather independent way though a few among them are quite tricky.\nMeanwhile, the second purpose is to prove that the methods developped by\nMacaulay in order to study {\\it unmixed polynomial ideals} are only particular\nexamples of new formal differential geometric techniques that have been\nintroduced recently in order to study {\\it pure differential modules}. However\nthese procedures are based on the formal theory of systems of ordinary\ndifferential (OD) or partial differential (PD) equations, in particular on a\nsystematic use of the Spencer operator, and are still not acknowledged by the\nalgebraic community. \n\n"}

The sharpness means the lower and upper bounds for the operators are\nconsistent with the behavior of the linearized operators. Moreover, we make\nclear the difference between the bounds for the original operators and those\nfor the linearized ones.\n  According to the Bobylev's formula, we introduce two types of dyadic\ndecompositions performed in both phase and frequency spaces to make full use of\nthe interaction and the cancellation. It allows us to see clearly which part of\nthe operator behaves like a Laplace type operator and which part is dominated\nby the anisotropic structure.

This approach is exactly\nanalogous to the strategy appearing in the aforementioned work on linearized\ngravity. We achieve inverse polynomial decay estimates by a streamlined version\nof the physical space $r^p$ method of Dafermos and Rodnianski. Furthermore, we\nare also able to prove decay for all the components of the Maxwell system. The\ntransformation that we use is a physical space version of a fixed-frequency\ntransformation which appeared in the work of Chandrasekhar. The present note is\na version of the author's master thesis and also serves the \"pedagogical\"\npurpose to be as complete as possible in the presentation. \n\n"}

Also, a classical mathematical feature is that\n(fractional) parabolic equations possess smoothing effects, in contrast with\nthe case of hyperbolic equations, which typically exhibit shocks and\ndiscontinuities. In this paper, we show how a simple toy-model of a highly\nramified structure, somehow inspired by that of the Purkinje cells, may produce\na fractional diffusion via the superposition of travelling waves that solve a\nhyperbolic equation. This could suggest that the high ramification of the\nPurkinje cells might have provided an evolutionary advantage of \"smoothing\" the\ntransmission of signals and avoiding shock propagations (at the price of\nslowing a bit such transmission).

Despite several decades of research on this ubiquitous and\nfundamental phenomenon there is yet no agreed-upon answer to this question.\nRecently, it was realized that all stochastic and deterministic differential\nequations, describing all natural and engineered dynamical systems, possess a\ntopological supersymmetry. It was then suggested that its spontaneous breakdown\ncould be interpreted as the stochastic generalization of deterministic chaos.\nThis conclusion stems from the fact that such phenomenon encompasses features\nthat are traditionally associated with chaotic dynamics such as\nnon-integrability, positive topological entropy, sensitivity to initial\nconditions, and the Poincare-Bendixson theorem. Here, we strengthen and\ncomplete this picture by showing that the hallmarks of set-theoretic chaos --\ntopological transitivity/mixing and dense periodic orbits -- can also be\nattributed to the spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry. We also\ndemonstrate that these features, which highlight the noisy character of chaotic\ndynamics, do not actually admit a stochastic generalization. We therefore\nconclude that spontaneous topological symmetry breaking can be considered as\nthe most general definition of continuous-time dynamical chaos. Contrary to the\ncommon perception and semantics of the word \"chaos\", this phenomenon should\nthen be truly interpreted as the low-symmetry, or ordered phase of the\ndynamical systems that manifest it.

When the solution space is a Banach space $B$ endowed with a quadratic\nnorm $\\|\\cdot\\|$, the optimal measure (mixed strategy) for such games (e.g. the\nadversarial recovery of $u\\in B$, given partial measurements $[\\phi_i, u]$ with\n$\\phi_i\\in B^*$, using relative error in $\\|\\cdot\\|$-norm as a loss) is a\ncentered Gaussian field $\\xi$ solely determined by the norm $\\|\\cdot\\|$, whose\nconditioning (on measurements) produces optimal bets.

We make the observation that cross field design for\ntwo-dimensional quad meshing is related to the well-known Ginzburg-Landau\nproblem from mathematical physics. This yields a variety of theoretical tools\nfor efficiently computing boundary-aligned quad meshes, with provable\nguarantees on the resulting mesh, such as the number of mesh defects and bounds\non the defect locations. The procedure for generating the quad mesh is to (i)\nfind a complex-valued \"representation\" field that minimizes the Ginzburg-Landau\nenergy subject to a boundary constraint, (ii) convert the representation field\ninto a boundary-aligned, smooth cross field, (iii) use separatrices of the\ncross field to partition the domain into four sided regions, and (iv) mesh each\nof these four-sided regions using standard techniques.

It is also shown that, for physically\nrealistic parameters, the standard 1D Area Averaged PNP model for ion flow\nthrough a pore is a very poor approximation to the (real) two-dimensional\nsolution to the PNP equations. This leads us to propose that the Quasi-1D PNP\nmodel derived here, whose computational cost is significantly less than\ntwo-dimensional solution of the PNP equations, should replace the use of the 1D\nArea Averaged PNP equations as a tool to investigate ion and current flows in\nion pores. \n\n"}

Our main results apply to any spacetime satisfying the null\nenergy condition and containing a compact Cauchy horizon with surface gravity\nthat can be normalised to a non-zero constant. Examples include the Misner\nspacetime and the Taub-NUT spacetime. We prove an energy estimate close to the\nCauchy horizon for wave equations acting on sections of vector bundles. Using\nthis estimate we prove that if a linear wave equation can be solved up to any\norder at the Cauchy horizon, then there exists a unique solution on the\nglobally hyperbolic region. As a consequence, we prove several existence and\nuniqueness results for linear and non-linear wave equations without assuming\nanalyticity or symmetry of the spacetime and without assuming that the\ngenerators close. We overcome in particular the essential remaining difficulty\nin proving that vacuum spacetimes with a compact Cauchy horizon with constant\nnon-zero surface gravity necessarily admits a Killing vector field.

{"id": "1806.10430", "contents": "Title: Deterministics descriptions of the turbulence in the Navier-Stokes\n  equations Abstract: This PhD thesis is devoted to deterministic study of the turbulence in the\nNavier- Stokes equations. The thesis is divided in four independent\nchapters.The first chapter involves a rigorous discussion about the energy's\ndissipation law, proposed by theory of the turbulence K41, in the deterministic\nsetting of the homogeneous and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, with a\nstationary external force (the force only depends of the spatial variable) and\non the whole space R3. The energy's dissipation law, also called the\nKolmogorov's dissipation law, characterizes the energy's dissipation rate (in\nthe form of heat) of a turbulent fluid and this law was developed by A.N.\nKolmogorov in 1941. However, its deduction (which uses mainly tools of\nstatistics) is not fully understood until our days and then an active research\narea consists in studying this law in the rigorous framework of the\nNavier-Stokes equations which describe in a mathematical way the fluids motion\nand in particular the movement of turbulent fluids. In this setting, the\npurpose of this chapter is to highlight the fact that if we consider the\nNavier-Stokes equations on R3 then certain physical quantities, necessary for\nthe study of the Kolmogorov's dissipation law, have no a rigorous definition\nand then to give a sense to these quantities we suggest to consider the\nNavier-Stokes equations with an additional damping term. In the framework of\nthese damped equations, we obtain some estimates for the energy's dissipation\nrate according to the Kolmogorov's dissipation law.In the second chapter we are\ninterested in study the stationary solutions of the damped Navier- Stokes\nintroduced in the previous chapter. These stationary solutions are a particular\ntype of solutions which do not depend of the temporal variable and their study\nis motivated by the fact that we always consider the Navier-Stokes equations\nwith a stationary external force. In this chapter we study two properties of\nthe stationary solutions : the first property concerns the stability of these\nsolutions where we prove that if we have a control on the external force then\nall non stationary solution (with depends of both spatial and temporal\nvariables) converges toward a stationary solution. The second property concerns\nthe decay in spatial variable of the stationary solutions. These properties of\nstationary solutions are a consequence of the damping term introduced in the\nNavier-Stokes equations.In the third chapter we still study the stationary\nsolutions of Navier-Stokes equations but now we consider the classical\nequations (without any additional damping term). The purpose of this chapter is\nto study an other problem related to the deterministic description of the\nturbulence : the frequency decay of the stationary solutions. Indeed, according\nto the K41 theory, if the fluid is in a laminar setting then the stationary\nsolutions of the Navier-Stokes equations must exhibit a exponential frequency\ndecay which starts at lows frequencies. But, if the fluid is in a turbulent\nsetting then this exponential frequency decay must be observed only at highs\nfrequencies. In this chapter, using some Fourier analysis tools, we give a\nprecise description of this exponential frequency decay in the laminar and in\nthe turbulent setting.In the fourth and last chapter we return to the\nstationary solutions of the classical Navier-Stokes equations and we study the\nuniqueness of these solutions in the particular case without any external\nforce. Following some ideas of G. Seregin, we study the uniqueness of these\nsolutions first in the framework of Lebesgue spaces of and then in the a\ngeneral framework of Morrey spaces. \n\n"}

Our\nmethod also provides equaly fast approximations of the derivatives of the\nsolution, which is a challenge for many other methods. Our approach is based on\na computable series expansion in terms of a \"small\" parameter. As an example,\nwe treat in detail the important case of the SABR PDE for $\\beta = 1$, namely\n$\\partial_{\\tau}u = \\sigma^2 \\big [ \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial^2_xu - \\partial_xu) +\n\\nu \\rho \\partial_x\\partial_\\sigma u + \\frac{1}{2} \\nu^2 \\partial^2_\\sigma u \\,\n\\big ] + \\kappa (\\theta - \\sigma) \\partial_\\sigma$, by choosing $\\nu$ as small\nparameter.

Truncating this expansion leads to\ncomputable approximations of $u$ that are in \"closed form,\" and hence can be\nevaluated very quickly. Most of the other related methods use the \"time\" $\\tau$\nas a small parameter. The advantage of our method is that it leads to shorter\nand hence easier to determine and to generalize formulas.
