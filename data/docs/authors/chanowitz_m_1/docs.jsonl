The simplest model\nrelies on two scalar fields, whose entropy perturbation leads to a\nscale-invariant spectrum of density fluctuations. The ekpyrotic solution has a\ntachyonic instability along the entropy field direction which, a priori,\nappears to require fine-tuning of the initial conditions. In this paper, we\nshow that these can be achieved naturally by adding a small positive mass term\nfor the tachyonic field and coupling to light fermions. Then, for a wide range\nof initial conditions, the tachyonic field gets stabilized with the appropriate\nvalues well before the onset of the ekpyrotic phase. Furthermore, we show that\nekpyrotic theory is successful in solving the flatness, horizon and homogeneity\nproblems of standard big bang cosmology. Motivated by the analysis of the\ntachyonic instability, we propose a simplification of the model in terms of new\nfield variables. Instead of requiring two exponential potentials, one for each\nscalar field, it suffices to consider a single nearly exponential potential for\none of the fields and a tachyonic mass term along the orthogonal direction in\nfield space. All other terms in the potential are essentially arbitrary. This\ngreatly widens the class of ekpyrotic potentials and allows substantial freedom\nin determining the spectral index and possible non-Gaussianity.

One\nis the \\mu-/B \\mu-problem and the second is the cosmological one. The former\nstems from the fact that the B parameter tends to be comparable with the\ngravitino mass, which is two order of magnitude larger than the other soft\nmasses. The latter problem is caused by the decay of the modulus whose\nbranching ratio into the gravitino pair is sizable. In this paper, we propose a\nmodel of mirage mediation, in which Peccei-Quinn symmetry is incorporated. In\nthis axionic mirage mediation, it is shown that the PQ symmetry breaking scale\nis dynamically determined around 10^{10-12} GeV due to the supersymmetry\nbreaking effects, and the \\mu-problem can be solved naturally. Furthermore, in\nour model, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is the axino, that is the\nsuperpartner of the axion. The overabundance of the LSPs due to decays of\nmodulus/gravitino, which is the most serious cosmological difficulty in the\nmirage mediation, can be avoided if the axino is sufficiently light. The\nnext-LSPs (NLSPs) produced by the gravitino decay eventually decay into the\naxino LSPs, yielding the dominant component of the axinos remaining today. It\nis shown that the axino with the mass of O(100) MeV is naturally realized,\nwhich can constitute the dark matter of the Universe, with the free-streaming\nlength of the order of 0.1 Mpc. The saxion, the real scalar component of the\naxion supermultiplet, can also be cosmologically harmless due to the dilution\nof the modulus decay.

The decoherence parameters as well as their energy\ndependence are chosen in such a way that the damping affects only oscillations\nwith the large (atmospheric) $\\Delta m^2$ and rapidly decreases with the\nneutrino energy. This allows us to reconcile the positive LSND signal with\nMiniBooNE and other null-result experiments. The standard explanations of\nsolar, atmospheric, KamLAND and MINOS data are not affected. No new particles,\nand in particular, no sterile neutrinos are needed. The LSND signal is\ncontrolled by the 1-3 mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ and, depending on the degree\nof damping, yields $0.0014 < \\sin^2\\theta_{13} < 0.034$ at $3\\sigma$.

We analyze the uniqueness of the solutions for the mass\nspectrum in terms of the measured endpoints in the observable invariant mass\ndistributions. We provide simple analytical inversion formulas for the masses\nin terms of the measured endpoints. We show that in a sizable portion of the\nSUSY mass parameter space the solutions always suffer from a two-fold\nambiguity, due to the fact that the original relations between the masses and\nthe endpoints are piecewise-defined functions. The ambiguity persists even in\nthe ideal case of a perfect detector and infinite statistics. We delineate the\ncorresponding dangerous regions of parameter space and identify the sets of\n\"twin\" mass spectra. In order to resolve the ambiguity, we propose a\ngeneralization of the endpoint method, from single-variable distributions to\ntwo-variable distributions.

We initially\nassume T-invariance by taking the up and down-quark 4x4 mass matrix to be real.\nFollowing Friedberg and Lee (FL), we then impose a \"hidden\" symmetry on the\nunobserved (\"hidden\") up and down-quark SU(2) states. The hidden symmetry for\nfour generations ensures the existence of two zero-mass eigenstates, which we\ntake to be the (u,c) and (d,s) states in the up and down-quark sectors,\nrespectively. Then, we simultaneously break T-invariance and the hidden\nsymmetry by introducing two phase factors in each sector. This breaking\nmechanism generates the small quark masses m_u, m_c and m_d, m_s which, along\nwith the orientation of the hidden symmetry, determine the size of CP-violation\nin the SM4. For illustration we choose a specific physical picture for the\nhidden symmetry and the breaking mechanism that reproduces the observed quark\nmasses, mixing angles and CP-violation, and at the same time allows us to\nfurther obtain very interesting relations/predictions for the mixing angles of\nt and t'. For example, with this choice we get V_{td} ~ (V_{cb}/V_{cd} -\nV_{ts}/V_{us}) + O(\\lambda^2) and V_{t'b} ~ V_{t'd}x(V_{cb}/V_{cd}), V_{tb'} ~\nV_{t'd}x(V_{ts}/V_{us}), implying that V_{t'd} > V_{t'b},V_{tb'}.

Such a manifestation of the SM4 is of particular interest as it may\nsuggest that the Higgs is a composite state, predominantly of the 4th\ngeneration heavy quarks. Motivated by the above, we show that the three-prong\ncomposite solution to the SM4 can have interesting new implications for Higgs\nphenomenology. For example, the Higgs can decay to a single heavy 4th\ngeneration quark via the 3-body decays (through an off-shell t' or b') H ->\nt'(bar) t'* -> t'(bar) b W+ and H -> b'(bar) b'* -> b'(bar) t W-. These flavor\ndiagonal decays can be dramatically enhanced at the LHC (by several orders of\nmagnitudes) due to the large width effects of the resonating heavy Higgs in the\nprocesses gg -> H -> t'(bar) t'* -> t'(bar) b W+ and gg -> H -> b'(bar) b'* ->\nb'(bar) t W-, thus yielding a viable signal above the corresponding continuum\nQCD production rates. In addition, the Higgs can decay to a single t' and b' in\nthe loop-generated flavor changing (FC) channels H -> b' b(bar), t' t(bar).\nThese FC decays are essentially \"GIM-free\" and can, therefore, have branching\nratios as large as 10^{-4} - 10^{-3}. \n\n"}

Moreover we improve our\ntreatment of the QCD corrections compared to our previous analysis. We also\ntake leptonic contributions into account, but we neglect the mixing among\nleptons. As a result we find that typically small mixing with the fourth family\nis favored, but still some sizeable deviations from the SM3 results are not yet\nexcluded. The minimal possible value of $V_{tb}$ is 0.93. Also very large\nCP-violating effects in $B_s$ mixing seem to be impossible within an extension\nof the SM3 that consists of an additional fermion family alone. We find a\ndelicate interplay of electroweak and flavor observables, which strongly\nsuggests that a separate treatment of the two sectors is not feasible. In\nparticular we show that the inclusion of the full CKM dependence of the $S$ and\n$T$ parameters in principle allows the existence of a degenerate fourth\ngeneration of quarks. \n\n"}

Observation of spectral splits in a future galactic\nsupernova signal is expected to throw light on the mass hierarchy pattern of\nthe neutrinos. However, since the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB)\ncomprises of a superposition of neutrino fluxes from all past supernovae, and\nsince different supernovae are expected to have slightly different initial\nfluxes, it is pertinent to check if the hierarchy dependent signature of\ncollective oscillations can survive this averaging of the flux spectra.

This\nnew particle should be a weak multiplet in order to have additional\ncontributions to the oblique parameters. If it is a color singlet, we find that\na heavy Higgs with an intermediate mass of 200 - 300 GeV can decay into the new\nstates, suppressing the branching ratios for the standard model modes, and thus\nhiding a heavy Higgs at the LHC. If the new particle is also charged under QCD,\nthe Higgs production cross section from gluon fusion can be reduced\nsignificantly due to the new colored particle one-loop contribution. Current\ncollider constraints on the new particles allow for viable parameter space to\nexist in order to hide a heavy Higgs boson.

We find a qualitatively\ndifferent behavior for d=3,4 w.r.t. d=2. In particular, considering any\n(sufficiently regular) gluon propagator D(p^2) and the one-loop-corrected ghost\npropagator G(p^2), we prove in the 2d case that sigma(p^2) blows up in the\ninfrared limit p -> 0 as -D(0)\\ln(p^2). Thus, for d=2, the no-pole condition\n\\sigma(p^2) < 1 (for p^2 > 0) can be satisfied only if D(0) = 0. On the\ncontrary, in d=3 and 4, sigma(p^2) is finite also if D(0) > 0. The same results\nare obtained by evaluating G(p^2) explicitly at one loop, using fitting forms\nfor D(p^2) that describe well the numerical data of D(p^2) in d=2,3,4 in the\nSU(2) case. These evaluations also show that, if one considers the coupling\nconstant g^2 as a free parameter, G(p^2) admits a one-parameter family of\nbehaviors (labelled by g^2), in agreement with Boucaud et al. In this case the\ncondition sigma(0) <= 1 implies g^2 <= g^2_c, where g^2_c is a 'critical'\nvalue. Moreover, a free-like G(p^2) in the infrared limit is obtained for any\nvalue of g^2 < g^2_c, while for g^2 = g^2_c one finds an infrared-enhanced\nG(p^2). Finally, we analyze the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) for sigma(p^2)\nand show that, for infrared-finite ghost-gluon vertices, one can bound\nsigma(p^2). Using these bounds we find again that only in the d=2 case does one\nneed to impose D(0) = 0 in order to satisfy the no-pole condition. The d=2\nresult is also supported by an analysis of the DSE using a spectral\nrepresentation for G(p^2). Thus, if the no-pole condition is imposed, solving\nthe d=2 DSE cannot lead to a massive behavior for D(p^2). These results apply\nto any Gribov copy inside the so-called first Gribov horizon, i.e. the 2d\nresult D(0) = 0 is not affected by Gribov noise.

While the gamma-ray results have been used to test the thermal\nDark Matter hypothesis and constrain the Dark Matter annihilation cross section\ninto Standard Model (SM) particles, the anti-proton flux measured by the PAMELA\nexperiment remains relatively unexploited.

Abstract: We consider the possibility that the new particle that has been observed at\n125 GeV is not the Standard Model (SM) Higgs, but instead the dilaton\nassociated with an approximate conformal symmetry that has been spontaneously\nbroken. We focus on dilatons that arise from theories of technicolor, or from\ntheories of the Higgs as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB), that involve\nstrong conformal dynamics in the ultraviolet. In the pNGB case, we are\nconsidering a framework where the Higgs particle is significantly heavier than\nthe dilaton and has therefore not yet been observed. In each of the technicolor\nand pNGB scenarios, we study both the case when the SM fermions and gauge\nbosons are elementary, and the case when they are composites of the strongly\ninteracting sector. Our analysis incorporates conformal symmetry violating\neffects, which are necessarily present since the dilaton is not massless, and\nis directly applicable to a broad class of models that stabilize the weak scale\nand involve strong conformal dynamics. Since the AdS/CFT correspondence relates\nthe radion in Randall-Sundrum (RS) models to the dilaton, our results also\napply to RS models with the SM fields localized on the infrared brane, or in\nthe bulk.

However due to the Z-Z' mixing\nalso corresponding contributions from Z boson are present that are usually\nneglected.

We express the cross\nsections through the double (triple, ...) generalized parton distributions\n(GPDs). In the mean field approximation for the double GPDs the answer is\nexpressed through the integral over two gluon form factor which was measured in\nthe exclusive DIS vector meson production.We explain under what conditions the\nderived expressions correspond to an intuitive picture of hard interactions in\nthe impact parameter representation. The mean field approximation in which\ncorrelations of the partons are neglected fail to explain the data, while pQCD\ninduced correlation enhance large $p_\\perp$ and $ 0.001 < x < 0.1$ typically\nenhance the cross section by a factor of 1.5 -- 2 explaining the current data.\nWe argue that in the small x kinematics ($10^{-4} \\le x \\le 10^{-3}$) where\neffects of perturbative correlations diminish, the nonperturbative mechanism\nkicks in and generates positive correlations comparable in magnitude with the\nperturbative ones. We explain how our technique can be used for calculations of\nMPI in the proton - nucleus scattering.

Furthermore, assuming\nthe Standard Model, single top-quark production can be used to determine\ntop-quark related couplings. For precise determinations of parameters like the\nelectroweak gauge couplings or the mass of the top quark, efficient, unbiased,\nand theoretically unambiguous analysis methods are needed. Within this context,\nthe Matrix Element Method (MEM) has been established in hadron collider\nanalyses due to its possibility to top out at utilising the information\navailable in experimental data. However, so far it has mostly been applied in\nBorn approximation only. We discuss the extension to next-to-leading order\n(NLO) accuracy. As a necessary prerequisite we introduce an efficient method to\ncalculate NLO QCD weights for jet events. As proof of concept and\nrepresentative example we use the MEM at NLO to reproduce the top-quark mass in\na toy experiment where we treat single top-quark events generated at NLO\naccuracy as pseudo-data. This is the first application of the MEM at NLO\naccuracy to the hadronic production of jets originating from coloured final\nstate partons.

Including N2LO PT corrections in the chiral limit and NLO SU3 PT\ncorrections, which we have estimated by assuming the factorization of the\nfour-quark spectral functions, we improve previous LO results for the XYZ-like\nmasses and decay constants from QCD spectral sum rules. Systematic errors are\nestimated from a geometric growth of the higher order PT corrections and from\nsome partially known d=8 non-perturbative contributions. Our optimal results,\nbased on stability criteria, are summarized in Tables 18 to 21 and compared\nwith some LO results in Table 22. In most channels, the SU3 corrections on the\nmeson masses are tiny: < 10% (resp. <3%) for the c (resp. b)-quark channel but\ncan be large for the couplings (< 20%). Within the lowest dimension currents,\nmost of the 0^{++} and 1^{++} states are below the physical thresholds while\nour predictions cannot discriminate a molecule from a four-quark state.

Recent experimental searches for this DiFF via\nazimuthal asymmetries in back-to-back hadron pair production in $e^+e^-$\nannihilation by the ${\\tt BELLE}$ Collaboration did not yield a signal.

In this\nnew approach the azimuthal asymmetry is weighted by the virtual photon's\ntransverse momentum square multiplying sine and cosine functions of difference\nof azimuthal angles of relative and total momentum for each pair. The\nintegration over the virtual photon's transverse momentum has the effect of\nseparating the convolution between the helicity-dependent DiFFs in the quark\nand antiquark jets and results in a nonzero collinear expression containing\nFourier moments of helicity-dependent DiFFs.

Next, we present a detailed comparison of three, state of\nthe art, microscopic models for electroweak pion production off nucleons, and\nwe also confront their predictions with polarized electron data, as a test of\nthe vector content of these models.

Importantly, it contains a multitude of Higgs\ntriple self-couplings, unlike the SM, which only has one. These interactions\nare key to understanding the phenomenology of the 2HDM, as they uniquely\ndetermine the form of the potential. Several studies analysing the prospects of\nmeasuring these couplings at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have found them to\nbe quite low generally. However, such studies have largely concentrated on\nHiggs pair-production induced by gluon-gluon scattering, either via direct\nannihilation or followed by their splitting into $b$-(anti)quark pairs, which\nin turn annihilate leaving behind spectator $b$-(anti)quarks. Both of these\nchannels are therefore governed by QCD dynamics.

In this paper, using deconstruction, we analyze the form of the\ncorrections to the electroweak interactions in a large class of these models,\nallowing for arbitrary 5-D geometry, position-dependent gauge coupling, and\nbrane kinetic energy terms. We show that many models considered in the\nliterature, including those most likely to be phenomenologically viable, are in\nthis class. By analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the correlation function of\ngauge currents at high momentum, we extract the exact form of the relevant\ncorrelation functions at tree-level and compute the corrections to precision\nelectroweak observables in terms of the spectrum of heavy vector bosons.

Following the same\nstrategy already applied to the decay K0 -> pi- l nu, the SU(3)-breaking\ncorrections to the vector form factor at zero-momentum transfer, f1(0), are\ndetermined with great statistical accuracy in the regime of the simulated quark\nmasses, which correspond to pion masses above ~ 0.7 GeV. Besides f1(0) also the\naxial to vector ratio g1(0) / f1(0), which is relevant for the extraction of\nthe CKM matrix element Vus, is determined with significant accuracy. Due to the\nheavy masses involved, a polynomial extrapolation, which does not include the\neffects of meson loops, is performed down to the physical quark masses,\nobtaining f1(0) = -0.948 +/- 0.029 and g1(0) / f1(0) = -0.287 +/- 0.052, where\nthe uncertainties do not include the quenching effect. Adding a recent\nnext-to-leading order determination of chiral loops, calculated within the\nHeavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory in the approximation of neglecting the\ndecuplet contribution, we obtain f1(0) = -0.988 +/- 0.029(lattice) +/-\n0.040(HBChPT). Our findings indicate that SU(3)-breaking corrections are\nmoderate on both f1(0) and g1(0). They also favor the experimental scenario in\nwhich the weak electricity form factor, g2(0), is large and positive, and\ncorrespondingly the value of |g1(0) / f1(0)| is reduced with respect to the one\nobtained with the conventional assumption g2(q**2) = 0 based on exact SU(3)\nsymmetry. \n\n"}

The most suitable way to\nconsistently incorporate the mixing, the time evolution and the decays of\nkaons, is to describe the neutral kaon system as a system with a non-Hermitean\nHamiltonian. In this framework, the physical (decaying) incoming and outgoing\nstates are distinct and belong to dual spaces. Moreover, since they are\neigenstates of the full Hamiltonian, they never oscillate. This is directly\nmanifest in the orthogonality conditions of the physical states, which entirely\ndetermine the evolution of the kaon system. Along these lines we conclude:\nCPLEAR studies K0-bar{K0} oscillations, a process where initial and final\nstates can be reversed, the CPLEAR asymmetry being an effect directly related\nto the definition of time-reversal. Conclusively, CPLEAR provides a direct\nmeasurement of T-violation without any assumption either on unitarity or on\nCPT-invariance. The KTeV experiment studies in particular the process KL -> pi+\npi- e+ e- where they measure a T-odd effect. However, using unitarity together\nwith estimates of the final state interactions, it should be possible to\ndetermine whether this effect can be identified with a genuine T-reversal\nviolation. \n\n"}
