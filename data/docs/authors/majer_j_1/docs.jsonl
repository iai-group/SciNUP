However, this\nimage is not always sufficient: when all particles are measured, quantum\nmechanics predicts probabilities that are sometimes in contradiction with it,\nas illustrated by quantum violations of local realism. In this letter, we show\nthat interferometers can be used to demonstrate a large variety of violations\nwith an arbitrarily large number of particles. With two independent\ncondensates, we find violations of the BCHSH inequalities, as well as new\nN-body Hardy impossibilities. With three condensates, we obtain new GHZ\n(Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger) type contradictions. \n\n"}

The weights in the superposition are optimized in a learning\nprocess that strives to minimize the training error as well as the number of\nweak classifiers used. No efficient solution to this problem is known. To bring\nit into a format that allows the application of adiabatic quantum computing\n(AQC), we first show that the bit-precision with which the weights need to be\nrepresented only grows logarithmically with the ratio of the number of training\nexamples to the number of weak classifiers. This allows to effectively\nformulate the training process as a binary optimization problem.

Here we define a\nRenyi squashed entanglement and a Renyi quantum discord based on a Renyi\nconditional quantum mutual information and investigate these quantities in\ndetail. Taking as a conjecture that the Renyi conditional quantum mutual\ninformation is monotone with respect to local operations on both systems $A$\nand $B$, we prove that the Renyi squashed entanglement and the Renyi quantum\ndiscord satisfy many of the properties of the respective original von Neumann\nentropy based quantities.

An intriguing feature of quantum interference arises in a three\nslit experiment. In this set-up, the interference pattern can be written in\nterms of the two and one slit patterns obtained by blocking some of the slits.\nThis is in stark contrast with the standard two slit experiment, where the\ninterference pattern is irreducible. This was first noted by Rafael Sorkin, who\nasked why quantum theory only exhibits irreducible interference in the two slit\nexperiment. One approach to this problem is to compare the predictions of\nquantum theory to those of operationally-defined `foil' theories, in the hope\nof determining whether theories exhibiting higher-order interference suffer\nfrom pathological--or at least undesirable--features. In this paper two\nproposed extensions of quantum theory are considered: the theory of Density\nCubes proposed by Dakic et al., which has been shown to exhibit irreducible\ninterference in the three slit set-up, and the Quartic Quantum Theory of\nZyczkowski. The theory of Density Cubes will be shown to provide an advantage\nover quantum theory in a certain computational task and to posses a\nwell-defined mechanism which leads to the emergence of quantum theory. Despite\nthis, the axioms used to define Density Cubes will be shown to be insufficient\nto uniquely characterise the theory. In comparison, Quartic Quantum Theory is\nwell-defined and we show that it exhibits irreducible interference to all\norders. This feature of the theory is argued not to be a genuine phenomenon,\nbut to arise from an ambiguity in the current definition of higher-order\ninterference. To understand why quantum theory has limited interference\ntherefore, a new operational definition of higher-order interference is needed. \n\n"}

In a recent\ncritical assessment Maroney and Timpson (2017) identified three different\ncategories of macroscopic realism, and argued that only the simplest category\ncould be ruled out by Leggett-Garg inequality violations.

Several verification\nprotocols for graph states have been proposed, but none of these are\nparticularly resource efficient: multiple copies are required to extract a\nsingle state that is guaranteed to be close to the ideal one. The best protocol\ncurrently known requires $O(n^{15})$ copies of the state, where $n$ is the size\nof the graph state. In this paper, we construct a significantly more\nresource-efficient verification protocol for graph states that only requires\n$O(n^5\\log{n})$ copies. The key idea is to employ Serfling's bound, which is a\nprobability inequality in classical statistics. Utilizing Serfling's bound also\nenables us to generalize our protocol for qudit and continuous-variable graph\nstates.

However, there are\nmany indications that one dimensional spin systems are simpler than their\nhigher-dimensional counterparts: for example, they cannot have thermal phase\ntransitions or topological order, and there exist highly-effective numerical\nalgorithms such as DMRG - and even provably polynomial-time ones - for gapped\n1D systems, exploiting the fact that such systems obey an entropy area-law.\nFurthermore, the spectral gap undecidability construction crucially relied on\naperiodic tilings, which are not possible in 1D.\n  So does the spectral gap problem become decidable in 1D?

We find that the\ndeviation with respect to the noiseless case is significantly reduced when\nbang-bang pulses are applied, being scaled down approximately by the ratio of\nthe bang-bang period and the typical flipping time of the bistable fluctuation.\nOur analysis gives not only the effect of bang-bang control on the variance of\nthese deviations, but also their entire distribution. As a result, we expect\nthat bang-bang control works as a high-pass filter on the spectrum of noise\nsources.

The time-dependent\noccupation probabilities p_i(t) are assumed to obey the nonlinear rate\nequations tau dp_i/dt=-p_i ln p_i+ alpha(t)p_i-beta(t)e_ip_i where alpha(t) and\nbeta(t) are functionals of the p_i(t)'s that maintain invariant the mean energy\nE=sum_i e_ip_i(t) and the normalization condition 1=sum_i p_i(t). The entropy\nS(t)=-k sum_i p_i(t) ln p_i(t) is a non-decreasing function of time until the\ninitially nonzero occupation probabilities reach a Boltzmann-like canonical\ndistribution over the occupied energy eigenstates. Initially zero occupation\nprobabilities, instead, remain zero at all times.

The motivation for such a scheme comes from the well-known\nfact that due to the noise in a quantum measurement, the resulting outcome\ndistribution is given by a POM and cannot, in general, be described in terms of\na traditional observable, a selfadjoint operator. Accordingly, we notice that\nthe noiseless measurements are the ones which are determined by a selfadjoint\noperator. The POM $E^f$ in our quantization is defined through its moment\noperators, which are required to be of the form $\\Gamma(f^k)$, $k\\in \\N$, with\n$\\Gamma$ a fixed map from classical variables to Hilbert space operators. In\nparticular, we consider the quantization of classical \\emph{questions}, that\nis, functions $f:\\R^2\\to\\R$ taking only values 0 and 1.
