Consequently, the massive field grows exponentially over time and is\nunstable. Former analytical estimations of the timescale associated with the\ninstability were restricted to the regimes $M\\mu>>1$ and $M\\mu<<1$, where $M$\nand $\\mu$ are the masses of the black hole and the field, respectively.

Here quantum mechanical amplitudes are assigned to trajectories within the\ncausal set. By summing these over all trajectories between two spacetime events\nwe obtain a causal set particle propagator. With a suitable choice of\namplitudes this is shown to agree (in an appropriate sense) with the retarded\npropagator for the Klein-Gordon equation in Minkowski spacetime.\n  This causal set propagator is then used to define a causal set analogue of\nthe Pauli-Jordan function that appears in continuum quantum field theories. A\nquantum scalar field is then modelled by an algebra of operators which satisfy\nthree simple conditions (including a bosonic commutation rule).

Here, we improve our previous calculation by keeping track\nof the time of emission of the Hawking particles and their back-reaction on the\nBH.

Due to its design, contamination from eclipsing\nbinaries, variable stars, and other transiting planets results in a significant\nnumber of these signals being false positives. This directly affects the\ndetermination of the occurrence rate of Earth-like planets in our Galaxy, as\nwell as other planet population statistics. In order to detect as many of these\nfalse positives as possible, we perform ephemeris matching among all transiting\nplanet, eclipsing binary, and variable star sources. We find that 685 Kepler\nObjects of Interest - 12% of all those analyzed - are false positives as a\nresult of contamination, due to 409 unique parent sources. Of these, 118 have\nnot previously been identified by other methods.

The\ntheory is established based on spinnic and scaling gauge symmetries by treating\nthe gravitational force on the same footing as the electroweak and strong\nforces. A bi-frame space-time is initiated to describe the laws of nature. One\nframe space-time is a globally flat coordinate Minkowski space-time that acts\nas an inertial reference frame for the motions of fields, the other is a\nlocally flat non-coordinate Gravifield space-time that functions as an\ninteraction representation frame for the degrees of freedom of fields. The\nGravifield is sided on both the globally flat coordinate space-time and locally\nflat non-coordinate space-time and characterizes the gravitational force.\nInstead of the principle of general coordinate invariance in Einstein theory of\ngeneral relativity, some underlying principles with the postulates of\ncoordinate independence and gauge invariance are motivated to establish the\ntheory of quantum gravity. When transmuting the Gravifield basis into the\ncoordinate basis in Minkowski space-time, it enables us to obtain equations of\nmotion for all quantum fields and derive basic conservation laws for all\nsymmetries. When the spinnic and scaling gauge symmetries are broken down to a\nbackground structure that possesses the global Lorentz and scaling symmetries,\nwe arrive at a Lorentz invariant and conformally flat background Gravifield\nspace-time that is characterized by a cosmic vector with a non-zero\ncosmological mass scale.

In this paper, we study a sample of giant transiting exoplanets\ndetected by the Kepler telescope with orbital periods up to 400 days.

Based on a sample of confirmed or likely planets, we\nthen derive the occurrence rates of giant planets in different ranges of\norbital periods.

We recover, for the first time in the Kepler data, the\ndifferent populations of giant planets reported by radial velocity surveys.\nComparing these rates with other yields, we find that the occurrence rate of\ngiant planets is lower only for hot jupiters but not for the longer period\nplanets.

We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide\nillustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion\nof the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1\nconsists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,\nparallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars\nin common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric\ndata set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources.

The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr.

The proposal is based on the Jacobson formalism,\nwhere the Einstein field equations are viewed as thermodynamical relations, and\nso the quantum fluctuations are generated from the thermal fluctuations. It is\nwell known that all approaches to quantum gravity generate logarithmic\ncorrections to the entropy of a black hole and the coefficient of this term\nvaries according to the different approaches to the quantum gravity.

This extends Jacobson's recent derivation of the\nEinstein equation using entanglement to include general higher derivative\ncorrections. The corrections are naturally associated with the subleading\ndivergences in the entanglement entropy, which take the form of a Wald entropy\nevaluated on the entangling surface. Variations of this Wald entropy are\nrelated to the field equations through an identity for causal diamonds in\nmaximally symmetric spacetimes, which we derive for arbitrary higher derivative\ntheories.

We assume that these interactions satisfy the\nfollowing three conditions: (i) the relaxation time of DM particles is\ncomparable to the dynamical time in disk galaxies; (ii) DM exchanges energy\nwith baryons due to elastic collisions; (iii) the product between the baryon-DM\ncross section and the typical energy exchanged in a collision is inversely\nproportional to the DM number density. We present an example of a particle\nphysics model that gives a DM-baryon cross section with the desired density and\nvelocity dependence. Direct detection constraints require our DM particles to\nbe either very light ($m << m_b$) or very heavy ($m >> m_b$), corresponding\nrespectively to heating and cooling of DM by baryons.

The\nlaws of quantum mechanics dictate that the wave function evolves unitarily, but\nthis unitary evolution is only manifest when considering the global description\nof the wave function; it is not implemented by time evolution on a single\nsemiclassical branch.

While we\nexpect the physics to be invariant under such redefinitions, it is not obvious\nhow this invariance actually comes about. We study the relation between these\ntwo, normal and inverted, representations of an oscillator in detail both in\nHeisenberg and Schr\\\"{o}dinger pictures to clarify several conceptual and\ntechnical issues. The situation becomes more involved when the oscillator is\ncoupled to another (semi)classical degree of freedom $C(t)$ and we want to\nstudy the back-reaction of the quantum system $q(t)$ on $C(t)$, in the\nsemi-classical approximation. We provide a simple prescription for the\nback-reaction based on energy conservation and study that the dynamics of the\nfull system in both normal and the inverted oscillator representation. The\nphysics again remains invariant but there are some extra subtleties which we\nclarify. The implications of these results for quantum field theory in\ncosmological backgrounds are discussed briefly in an appendix. \n\n"}

We compute this multivariate probability\ndistribution for various classes of single-field slow-roll models, exploring\nits dependence on the characteristic inflationary energy scales, the shape of\nthe potential V and and the choice of measure underlying the calculation. We\nfind that unless the characteristic scale Delta-phi on which V varies happens\nto be near the Planck scale, the only aspect of V that matters observationally\nis the statistical distribution of its peaks and troughs. For all energy scales\nand plausible measures considered, we obtain the predictions Omega_tot ~\n1+-0.00001, w=-1 and rho_Lambda in the observed ballpark but uncomfortably\nhigh.

We stress that we do not\nclaim to have a satisfactory answer to this question, rather our intention is\nto ignite a discussion by displaying the problems that have to be solved when\ncarrying out such a program. In the present paper we propose a scheme that one\nmight follow in order to arrive at such a limit. We discuss the technical and\nconceptual problems that arise in doing so and how they can be solved in\nprinciple. As to be expected, completely new issues arise due to the fact that\nQGR is a background independent theory. For instance, fundamentally the notion\nof a photon involves not only the Maxwell quantum field but also the metric\noperator - in a sense, there is no photon vacuum state but a \"photon vacuum\noperator\"!

We show\nexplicitly that these three approaches lead to the same prediction in the limit\nof large squeezing (i.e. when the squeezing parameter $|r_k|\\to \\infty$): each\ntwo-modes quantum state (k, -k) of these perturbations is equivalent to a\nclassical perturbation that has a stochastic amplitude, obeying a non-gaussian\nstatistics which depends on the initial state, and that belongs to the\nquasi-isotropic mode (i.e. it possesses a fixed phase). The Wigner function is\nnot everywhere positive for any finite $r_k$, hence its interpretation as a\nclassical distribution function in phase space is impossible without some\ncoarse graining procedure.

We\nagree that a set of initial parameters (such as the initial homogeneity scale,\nthe initial entropy) larger than those determined by the initial horizon scale,\nH^{-1}, would be somewhat unnatural to start with. However, in the pre-big bang\nscenario, the initial parameters are all bounded by the size of the initial\nhorizon.

The first\nis a general structure theorem for spacetimes obeying a certain convexity\ncondition near infinity, analogous to the structure theorems of Cheeger and\nGromoll for manifolds of non-negative Ricci curvature. For spacetimes with\nRicci-flat conformal boundary, the convexity condition is associated with\nnegative mass. The second theorem is a uniqueness theorem for the negative mass\nAdS soliton spacetime. This result lends support to the new positive mass\nconjecture due to Horowitz and Myers which states that the unique lowest mass\nsolution which asymptotes to the AdS soliton is the soliton itself.

{"id": "hep-th/0303258", "contents": "Title: Problems on Foundations of General Relativity Abstract: It was generally believed that, in general relativity, the fundamental laws\nof nature should be invariant or covariant under a general coordinate\ntransformation. In general relativity, the equivalence principle tells us the\nexistence of a local inertial coordinate system and the fundamental laws in the\nlocal inertial coordinate system which are the same as those in inertial\nreference system. Then, after a general coordinate transformation, the\nfundamental laws of nature in arbitrary coordinate system or in arbitrary\ncurved space-time can be obtained. However, through a simple example, we find\nthat, under a general coordinate transformation, basic physical equations in\ngeneral relativity do not transform covariantly, especially they do not\npreserve their forms under the transformation from a local inertial coordinate\nsystem to a curved space-time. The origination of the violation of the general\ncovariance is then studied, and a general theory on general coordinate\ntransformations is developed. Because of the the existence of the\nnon-homogeneous term, the fundamental laws of nature in arbitrary curved\nspace-time can not be expressed by space-time metric, physical observable and\ntheir derivatives. In other words, basic physical equations obtained from the\nequivalence principle and the principle of general covariance are different\nfrom those in general relativity. Both the equivalence principle and the\nprinciple of general covariance can not be treated as foundations of general\nrelativity. So, what are the foundations of General Relativity? Such kind of\nessential problems on General Relativity can be avoided in the physical picture\nof gravity. Quantum gauge theory of gravity, which is founded in the physics\npicture of gravity, does not have such kind of fundamental problems. \n\n"}

To\ninvestigate whether this cancellation happens dynamically, and within the\ncontext of a realistic cosmology, we study a codimension-two braneworld with\nspherical extra dimensions compactified by magnetic flux. Assuming Einstein\ngravity, we show that when the brane contains matter with an arbitrary equation\nof state, the 4D metric components are not regular at the brane, unless the\nbrane has nonzero thickness.

The basic idea is that brane solutions wrapped around extra\ndimensions, which is allowed by string theory, will resist expansion due to\ntheir winding mode. The momentum modes in principle work in the opposite way.\nIt is this interplay that leads to dynamical stabilization. We use the idea of\ndemocratic wrapping \\cite{art5}-\\cite{art6}, where in a given decimation of\nextra dimensions, all possible winding cases are considered. To simplify the\nstudy further we assumed a symmetric decimation in which the total number of\nextra dimensions is taken to be $Np$ where N can be called the order of the\ndecimation. We also assumed that extra dimensions all have the topology of\ntori. We show that with these rather conservative assumptions, there exists\nsolutions to the field equations in which the extra dimensions are stabilized\nand that the conditions do not depend on $p$. This fact means that there exists\nat least one solution to the asymmetric decimation case. If we denote the\nnumber of observed space dimensions (excluding time) by $m$, the condition for\nstabilization is $m\\geq 3$ for pure Einstein gravity and $m\\leq 3$ for dilaton\ngravity massaged by string theory parameters. \n\n"}

Abstract: The rules of quantum mechanics require a time coordinate for their\nformulation. However, a notion of time is in general possible only when a\nclassical spacetime geometry exists. Such a geometry is itself produced by\nclassical matter sources. Thus it could be said that the currently known\nformulation of quantum mechanics pre-assumes the presence of classical matter\nfields. A more fundamental formulation of quantum mechanics should exist, which\navoids having to use a notion of time. In this paper we discuss as to how such\na fundamental formulation could be constructed for single particle,\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics. We argue that there is an underlying\nnon-linear theory of quantum gravity, to which both standard quantum mechanics\nand classical general relativity are approximations. The timeless formulation\nof quantum mechanics follows from the underlying theory when the mass of the\nparticle is much smaller than Planck mass. On the other hand, when the\nparticle's mass is much larger than Planck mass, spacetime emerges and the\nunderlying theory should reduce to classical mechanics and general relativity.\nWe also suggest that noncommutative differential geometry is a possible\ncandidate for describing this underlying theory. \n\n"}
