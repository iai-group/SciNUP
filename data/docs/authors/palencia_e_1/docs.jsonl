The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S}$\ndecay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective\n$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct\nCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the\nlatter. (iii) For $B\\to K\\pi\\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonant\ncontributions in $K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\bar K^0\\pi^+\\pi^-$ modes, in agreement\nwith the Belle measurements but larger than the BaBar result. \n\n"}

Unlike the often studied Z' cases, in this framework, there are\nthree neutral gauge bosons due to the underlying SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x U(1)_X\ngauge group in the bulk. Furthermore, couplings of these KK states to light\nquarks and leptons are suppressed, whereas those to top and bottom quarks are\nenhanced compared to the SM gauge couplings. Therefore, the production of light\nquark and lepton states is suppressed relative to other beyond the SM\nconstructions, and the fermionic decays of these states are dominated by the\ntop and bottom quarks, which are, though, overwhelmed by KK gluons dominantly\ndecaying into them.

Since the\nlight-neutrino mass must be less than an eV or so, the mixing would be very\nsmall, even for a heavy-neutrino mass of order a few hundred GeV.

We show that,\nin addition to the well-known W helicity fractions, for polarised top decays it\nis worth to define and study the transverse and normal W polarisation\nfractions, that is, the W polarisation along two directions orthogonal to its\nmomentum. In particular, a rather simple forward-backward asymmetry in the\nnormal direction is found to be very sensitive to complex phases in one of the\nWtb anomalous couplings. This asymmetry, which indicates a normal W\npolarisation, can be generated for example by a P-odd, T-odd transition\nelectric dipole moment. We also investigate the angular distribution of decay\nproducts in the top quark rest frame, calculating the spin analysing powers for\na general Wtb vertex. Finally we show that, using a combined fit to top decay\nobservables and the tW cross section, at LHC it will be possible to obtain\nmodel-independent measurements of all the (complex) Wtb couplings as well as\nthe single top polarisation.

The transverse energies of dijets in opposite hemispheres is\nobserved to become systematically more unbalanced with increasing event\ncentrality leading to a large number of events which contain highly asymmetric\ndijets. This is the first observation of an enhancement of events with such\nlarge dijet asymmetries, not observed in proton-proton collisions, and which\nmay point to an interpretation in terms of strong jet energy loss in a hot,\ndense medium. \n\n"}

Such\ntheories are well motivated and their gluinos typically have a O(50%) branching\nratio to charged Winos. Observing the track of a long lived charged Wino\nproduced from gluino decay could give a clear identification of a gluino event.\nCharged Wino NLSPs produced in colliders can be long-lived enough to leave a\nreconstructable high pT charged track before decaying into a soft pion (or a\nsoft lepton) and the LSP, a signature with low SM background. By supplementing\nthe canonical gluino search strategy with a search for these stiff chargino\ntracks, our results suggest it will be possible to find gluinos with\nsignificantly less luminosity. In addition, we describe a procedure for\nobtaining a kinematic measurement of the gluino mass using the three momenta of\nthe reconstructed chargino tracks.

The nonlocal\neffects, generated by the four-quark and penguin operators combined with the\nelectromagnetic interaction, are calculated at $q^2<0$, far below the hadronic\nthresholds. For hard-gluon contributions we employ the QCD factorization\napproach. The soft-gluon nonfactorizable contributions are estimated from QCD\nlight-cone sum rules. The result of the calculation is matched to the hadronic\ndispersion relation in the variable $q^2$, which is then continued to the\nkinematical region of the decay. The overall effect of nonlocal contributions\nin $B\\to K\\ell^+\\ell^-$ at large hadronic recoil is moderate.

For that result to hold\nwe assumed that the mother is unpolarized and has a generic boost distribution\nin the laboratory frame. In this work we discuss how this observation can be\napplied for determination of masses of new particles, without requiring a full\nreconstruction of their decay chains or information about the rest of the\nevent. We focus on a two-step cascade decay of a massive particle that has one\ninvisible particle in the final state: C -> Bb -> Aab, where C, B and A are new\nparticles of which A is invisible and a, b are visible particles. Combining the\nmeasurements of the peaks of energy distributions of a and b with that of the\nedge in their invariant mass distribution, we demonstrate that it is in\nprinciple possible to determine separately all three masses of the new\nparticles, in particular, without using any measurement of missing transverse\nmomentum. Furthermore, we show how the use of the peaks in an inclusive energy\ndistribution is generically less affected by combinatorial issues as compared\nto other mass measurement strategies. For some simplified, yet interesting,\nscenarios we find that these combinatorial issues are absent altogether. As an\nexample of this general strategy, we study SUSY models where gluino decays to\nan invisible lightest neutralino via an on-shell bottom squark. Taking into\naccount the dominant backgrounds, we show how the mass of the bottom squark,\nthe gluino and (for some class of spectra) that of the neutralino can be\ndetermined using this technique. \n\n"}

In order to quantify these constraints, as well as to assess\nthe compatibility with available nuclear data from fixed target experiments and\nfrom RHIC, the traditional strategy is to perform a global fit of nuclear PDFs.\nThis procedure is however time consuming and technically challenging, and\nmoreover can only be performed by the PDF fitters themselves.

One usually think that it is extremely\nimportant for the measurement of triple Higgs coupling at the high luminosity\nLHC. In this paper, we propose to search for the extra Higgs boson (denoted as\n$S$) utilizing pair production of the SM-like Higgs boson ($H$) which was\ndiscovered in July, 2012.The pair production of $H$ can be huge due to the\nresonant production of heavy scalar $S$, namely $PP \\rightarrow S \\rightarrow\nHH$. The couplings of $H$ with weak gauge boson are similar to ones in the SM\nand it implies that the couplings between $S$ and gauge bosons are likely\nsuppressed. Provided that $S$ is heavy enough, the decay into weak gauge bosons\nmay not be the dominant modes. Instead $S$ can decay into a pair of $H$ and\noffer the promising channel to discover it. In this paper, we studied the 5\npromising decay modes of $H$, i.e. $b\\bar{b}$, $WW^*$, $ZZ^*$, $\\gamma\\gamma$\nand $\\tau^+\\tau^-$, and simulated the signals and backgrounds for the 15\ncombination modes for $HH$ at the LHC with $\\sqrt{s}= 14$ TeV and integrated\nluminosity $\\mathcal{L}=1000fb^{-1}$.

In this paper, we\nconsider one simple DM model where the DM candidate is a complex scalar and\ninteracts with the SM particles via exchange of the Higgs particle and an extra\nquark, named bottom partner. The extra quark carries the same quantum number as\nthe right-handed down-type quarks and has Yukawa couplings with the DM\ncandidate and the right-handed down-type quarks. The Yukawa interactions are\nnot only relevant to the thermal relic density of the DM, but also contribute\nto the flavor physics, such as the $\\Delta F=2$ processes. In addition, the\nflavor alignment of the Yukawa couplings is related to the decay modes of the\nextra quark.

This implies a\nrepulsive Casimir force that gives the string a \"zero point length\".

In this work we extend\nthis strategy to the parameter region around the $W$ corridor by considering\nthe one lepton final state.

The mass distributions exhibit narrow and wide\nbumps at several locations in the 100 - 300 GeV range, between the masses of\nthe daughter particles $A$ and the parent particle $S$, depending on the jet\nsubstructure selection. This striking observation introduces several caveats\nwhen interpreting and comparing experimental results, for the case of\nnon-standard signatures. The possibility that a single boosted particle\ndecaying hadronically produces multiple bumps, at quite different jet masses,\nand depending on the event selection, brings the game of anomaly chasing to the\nnext level. \n\n"}

With a minimal extension of the Higgs sector, the three RHNs acquire\ntheir Majorana masses associated with U(1)$_X$ symmetry breaking. While\n$N_R^{1,2}$ have Yukawa coupling with the SM lepton doublets and play an\nessential role for the 'minimal seesaw' mechanism, $N_R$ is isolated from the\nSM particles due to its U(1)$_X$ charge and hence it is a natural candidate for\nthe dark matter (DM) without invoking additional symmetries. In this model\ncontext, we investigate the $Z^\\prime$-portal RHN DM scenario, where the RHN DM\ncommunicates with the SM particles through the U(1)$_X$ gauge boson ($Z^\\prime$\nboson). We identify a narrow parameter space by combining the constraints from\nthe observed DM relic abundance, the results of the search for a $Z^\\prime$\nboson resonance at the Large Hadron Collider Run-2, and the gauge coupling\nperturbativity up to the Planck/Grand Unification scale. For a special choice\nof U(1)$_X$ charges for the SM fields allows us to extend the model to\nSU(5)$\\times$U(1)$_X$ grand unification. In this scenario, the model parameter\nspace is more severely constrained, which will be explored at future high\nenergy collider experiments. \n\n"}

The\nelectromagnetic showers generated in the stack of 1 radiation length tungsten\nabsorber plates are sampled by 608 silicon detectors with 38,912 radial pads of\n2.5mm width.The fine segmentation of the detector, combined with the precise\nknowledge of its physical dimensions, allows the trajectories of incoming 45GeV\nelectrons or photons to be determined with a total systematic error of less\nthan 7microns. We have quantified all significant sources of systematic\nexperimental error in the luminosity determination by direct physical\nmeasurement. All measured properites of the luminosity event sample are found\nto be in agreement with current theoretical expectations. The total systematic\nmeasurement uncertainty is 3.4x10^-4, significantly below the theoretical error\nof 5.4x10^-4 currently assigned to the QED calculation of the Bhabha\nacceptance, and contributes negligibly to the total uncertainty in the OPAL\nmeasurement of Gamma{invisible}/Gamma{l+l-}, a quantity of basic physical\ninterest which depends crucially on the luminosity measurement. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-ph/9908280", "contents": "Title: A New Analysis of Charge Symmetry Violation in Parton Distributions Abstract: To date, the strongest indication of charge symmetry violation in parton\ndistributions has been obtained by comparing the $F_2$ structure functions from\nCCFR neutrino data and NMC muon data. We show that in order to make precise\ntests of charge symmetry with the neutrino data, two conditions must be\nsatisfied. First, the nuclear shadowing calculations must be made explicitly\nfor neutrinos, not simply taken from muon data on nuclei. Second, the\ncontribution of strange and charm quarks should be calculated explicitly using\nnext-to-leading order [NLO] QCD, and the ``slow rescaling'' charm threshold\ncorrection should not be applied to the neutrino data. When these criteria are\nsatisfied, the comparison is consistent with charge symmetry within the\nexperimental errors and the present uncertainty in the strange quark\ndistribution of the nucleon. \n\n"}
