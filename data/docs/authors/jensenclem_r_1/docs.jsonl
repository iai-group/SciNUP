Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach. We also briefly discuss how the SZ and\nX-ray cluster data can be combined to resolve the helium abundance dependence\nfor the d_a(z) cosmological test. \n\n"}

These results are consistent with the absence of the\noxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova\nejecta into the protoplanetary disk. Instead, the presence of Al-26 in the\noldest Solar System solids (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions or CAIs) and its\napparent uniform distribution with the inferred canonical Al-26/Al-27 ratio of\n(4.5-5)E-5 support the inheritance of Al-26 from the parent giant molecular\ncloud.

In general, psi cannot be measured, but for transiting planets\none can measure the angle lambda between the sky projections of the two axes\nvia the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.

These latter effects introduce colored noise in the\nphotometric time series that can lead to a complete miss of the signal. By\nusing a large number of available photometric time series of a given field, TFA\nutilizes the fact that the same types of systematics appear in several/many\ntime series of the same field.

According to seismic tomography, the hottest area is\nthe mantle under the central Pacific Ocean. Combined with geomagnetic data, it\nis derived that the magnetic and heat convection centers deviate from the\ngeographic center to the Pacific direction for 400 km. Therefore, U and Th may\nbe more concentrated in a position close to the equator in the lower outer core\nunder the central Pacific Ocean, and have formed a large U, Th-rich center\nthere. Another small U, Th-rich center may be located in a position close to\nthe equator in the lower outer core under Africa, which is directly opposite of\nthe large U, Th-rich center past the solid inner core.

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems. We find that the semi-major\naxis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the eccentricity\ndistribution is determined after the disk dissipation. We also find that there\nmay be an optimum disk mass which leads to the observed a-e distribution. Our\nsimulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in\nmean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's\nperturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed\nrate of MMRs.

However, a one sigma increase in mass (5.6 M_E) and\ndecrease in size (1.59 R_E) are compatible with an Earth-like composition (33%\niron, 67% silicates). Alternatively, it is possible that CoRoT-7b contains a\nsignificant amount of volatiles. An equally good fit to the data is found for a\nvapor envelope equal to 3% (and up to 10%) by mass above an Earth-like nucleus.\nBecause of its intense irradiation and small size, the planet cannot possess an\nenvelope of H and He of more than 1/10,000 of its total mass.

A bolometric interferometer will have to take\nadvantage of the wide spectral detection band of its bolometers in order to be\ncompetitive with imaging experiments. A crucial concern is that interferometers\nare presumed to be importantly affected by a spoiling effect known as bandwidth\nsmearing. In this paper, we investigate how the bandwidth modifies the work\nprinciple of a bolometric interferometer and how it affects its sensitivity to\nthe CMB angular power spectra. We obtain analytical expressions for the\nbroadband visibilities measured by broadband heterodyne and bolometric\ninterferometers.

The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and\ninclude grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the\nresistivity of the gas. The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri\nstars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar\nX-ray luminosity, but can be produced by varying these together with the disk\nmagnetic flux. The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling\nof grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence,\nthrough three effects: (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically\ninactive dead zone extending above two scale heights, while turbulence in the\nmagnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only\nabout one scale height. (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically\nin waves driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the\nlaminar rates, so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk\natmosphere becomes dust-depleted. (3) With sufficient depletion, the dead zone\nis thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The MHD results also\nshow that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of dust into the\natmosphere. The photosphere height changes by up to one-third over a few\norbits, while the extinction along lines of sight grazing the disk surface\nvaries by factors of two over times down to 0.1 orbit.

Both problems may be resolved by allowing the ice\ngiants to migrate outward after their formation in solid-rich feeding zones\nwith planetesimal surface densities well above the minimum-mass solar nebula.\nWe present new simulations of the formation of Uranus and Neptune in the\nsolid-rich disk of Dodson-Robinson et al.

Using 5,000 long duration\nN-body simulations, we follow the evolution of three planets surrounded by a 50\nEarth mass primordial planetesimal disk. For large planet masses (above that of\nSaturn) the influence of the disk is modest, and we recover the observed\neccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets (observed primarily at smaller\nradii). We explain the observed mass dependence of the eccentricity by invoking\nstrong correlations between planet masses in the same system.

The\nsame analysis also shows that the stellar content of clusters and groups\ndisplays an intrinsic spread at a given cluster mass, i.e. clusters are not\nsimilar each other in the amount of stars they contain, not even at a fixed\ncluster mass. The stellar mass fraction depends on halo mass with (logarithmic)\nslope -0.55+/-0.08 and with 0.15+/-0.02 dex of intrinsic scatter at a fixed\ncluster mass. The intrinsic scatter at a fixed cluster mass we determine for\ngas mass fractions is smaller, 0.06+/-0.01 dex. The intrinsic scatter in both\nthe stellar and gas mass fractions is a distinctive signature that the regions\nfrom which clusters and groups collected matter, a few tens of Mpc, are yet not\nrepresentative, in terms of gas and baryon content, of the mean matter content\nof the Universe.

In particular, two of the\nzones form an annulus at intermediate radial distances within which small\nparticles reside. Particle capture by vortices occurs on a dynamical time scale\nnear and at the boundaries of this annulus. As the disc ages and the particles\ngrow via coagulation, the size of the annulus shrinks.

I.\n  Classifying the Evolution of Size Distribution Abstract: Collisional growth of submicron-sized dust grains into macroscopic aggregates\nis the first step of planet formation in protoplanetary disks. These grains are\nexpected to carry nonzero negative charges in the weakly ionized disks, but its\neffect on their collisional growth has not been fully understood so far. In\nthis paper, we investigate how the charging affects the evolution of the dust\nsize distribution properly taking into account the charging mechanism in a\nweakly ionized gas as well as porosity evolution through low-energy collisions.\nTo clarify the role of the size distribution, we divide our analysis into two\nsteps. First, we analyze the collisional growth of charged aggregates assuming\na monodisperse (i.e., narrow) size distribution. We show that the monodisperse\ngrowth stalls due to the electrostatic repulsion when a certain condition is\nmet, as is already expected in the previous work. Second, we numerically\nsimulate dust coagulation using Smoluchowski's method to see how the outcome\nchanges when the size distribution is allowed to freely evolve. We find that,\nunder certain conditions, the dust undergoes bimodal growth where only a\nlimited number of aggregates continue to grow carrying the major part of the\ndust mass in the system. This occurs because remaining small aggregates\nefficiently sweep up free electrons to prevent the larger aggregates from being\nstrongly charged. We obtain a set of simple criteria that allows us to predict\nhow the size distribution evolves for a given condition. In Paper II\n(arXiv:1009.3101), we apply these criteria to dust growth in protoplanetary\ndisks. \n\n"}

The\nradial gradients (in a dimensionless logarithmic form) of density and\ntemperature are assumed to be constant near the planet. We find that the torque\nis roughly equally sensitive to the surface density and temperature radial\ngradients. Both gradients contribute to inward migration when they are\nnegative. Our results indicate that two-dimensional calculations with a\nsmoothed planet potential, used to account for the effects of the third\ndimension, do not accurately determine the effects of density and temperature\ngradients on the three-dimensional torque. The results suggest that\nsubstantially slowing or stopping planet migration by means of changes in disk\nopacity or shadowing is difficult and appears unlikely for a disk that is\nlocally isothermal.

We suggest that the resulting\nearly ingress is caused by a bow shock ahead of the planetary orbital motion.\nIn this Letter we investigate the conditions that might lead to the formation\nof such a bow shock. We consider two scenarios: (1) the stellar magnetic field\nis strong enough to confine the hot coronal plasma out to the planetary orbit\nand (2) the stellar magnetic field is unable to confine the plasma, which\nescapes in a wind. In both cases, a shock capable of compressing plasma to the\nobserved densities will form around the planet for plasma temperatures T < (4 -\n5) x 10^6 K. In the confined case, the shock always forms directly ahead of the\nplanet, but in the wind case the shock orientation depends on the wind speed\nand hence on the plasma temperature. For higher wind temperatures, the shock\nforms closer to the line of centers between the planet and the star. We\nconclude that shock formation leading to an observable early UV ingress is\nlikely to be a common feature of transiting systems and may prove to be a\nuseful tool in setting limits on planetary magnetic field strengths Bp.

Orbiting a quiet M-star, it receives considerably less mass-loss\ndriving X-ray and UV radiation than CoRoT-7b, so that the interior may be quite\ndissimilar in composition, including the possibility of a large fraction of\nwater. We model the interior of GJ 1214b assuming a two-layer (envelope+rock\ncore) structure where the envelope material is either H/He, pure water, or a\nmixture of H/He and H2O. Within this framework we perform models of the thermal\nevolution and contraction of the planet. We discuss possible compositions that\nare consistent with Mp=6.55 ME, Rp=2.678 RE, an age tau=3-10 Gyr, and the\nirradiation level of the atmosphere. These conditions require that if water\nexists in the interior, it must remain in a fluid state, with important\nconsequences for magnetic field generation. These conditions also require the\natmosphere to have a deep isothermal region extending down to 80-800 bar,\ndepending on composition.

Such asymmetry led us to suggest\nthat the early ingress in the UV light curve of WASP-12b, compared to the\noptical observations, is caused by a shock around the planet, and that shocks\nshould be a common feature in transiting systems. Here, we classify all the\ntransiting systems known to date according to their potential for producing\nshocks that could cause observable light curve asymmetries. We found that 36/92\nof known transiting systems would lie above a reasonable detection threshold\nand that the most promising candidates to present shocks are: WASP-19b,\nWASP-4b, WASP-18b, CoRoT-7b, HAT-P-7b, CoRoT-1b, TrES-3, and WASP-5b. For\nprograde planets orbiting outside the co-rotation radius of fast rotating\nstars, the shock position, instead of being ahead of the planetary motion as in\nWASP-12b, trails the planet. In this case, we predict that the light curve of\nthe planet should present a late-egress asymmetry. We show that CoRoT-11b is a\npotential candidate to host such a behind shock and show a late egress. If\nobserved, these asymmetries can provide constraints on planetary magnetic\nfields. For instance, for a planet that has a magnetic field intensity similar\nto Jupiter's field (~ 14 G) orbiting a star whose magnetic field is between 1\nand 100G, the stand-off distance between the shock and the planet, which we\ntake to be the size of the planet's magnetosphere, ranges from 1 to 40\nplanetary radii. \n\n"}

Without some stopping mechanism, the tidal, resonant\ninteraction between planets and their gaseous disc generally causes the planets\nto migrate inward so efficiently that they plunge into the host star within the\ngaseous disc lifetime ($\\sim $ 1-3 Myrs). We investigate planetary migration by\nanalytically calculating the migration rate and time within self-consistently\ncomputed, radiatively heated discs around M stars in which the effects of dust\nsettling are included. We show that dust settling lowers the disc temperature\nand raises the gas density in the mid-plane. This inescapable evolution of disc\nstructure speeds up type I planetary migration for lower mass bodies by up to a\nfactor of about 2. We also examine the effects of dust settling on the\ngap-opening mass and type II migration, and find that the gap-opening mass is\nreduced by a factor of 2 and type II migration becomes slower by a factor of 2.\nWhile dust settling can somewhat alleviate the problem of planetary migration\nfor more massive planets, the more rapid migration of low mass planets and\nplanetary cores requires a robust slowing mechanism. \n\n"}

Recent observations have shown\nthat a number of these planets have highly inclined, sometimes retrograde\norbits about their parent stars, prompting much speculation as to their origin.\nIt is known that migration alone cannot account for the observed population of\nthese misaligned hot Jupiters, which suggests that dynamical processes after\nthe gas disc dissipates play a substantial role in yielding the observed\ninclination and eccentricity distributions. One particularly promising\ncandidate is planet-planet scattering, which is not very well understood in the\nnon-linear regime of tides. Through three-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations of multi-orbit encounters, we show that planets that are scattered\ninto an orbit about their parent stars with closest approach distance being\nless than approximately three times the tidal radius are either destroyed or\ncompletely ejected from the system. We find that as few as 5 and as many as 18\nof the currently known hot Jupiters have a maximum initial apastron for\nscattering that lies well within the ice line, implying that these planets must\nhave migrated either before or after the scattering event that brought them to\ntheir current positions. If stellar tides are unimportant $(Q_\\ast \\gtrsim\n10^7)$, disk migration is required to explain the existence of the hot Jupiters\npresent in these systems. Additionally, we find that the disruption and/or\nejection of Jupiter-mass planets deposits a Sun's worth of angular momentum\nonto the host star.

In particular, we investigate the case when\ndissipative forces affect the planetary semi-major axes and the planets move\ninward/outward the central star, in a process known as planet migration. To\nperform this investigation, we introduce fundamental concepts of conservative\nand dissipative dynamics of the three-body problem. Based on these concepts, we\ndevelop a qualitative model of the secular evolution of the migrating planetary\npair. Our approach is based on analysis of the energy and the orbital angular\nmomentum exchange between the two-planet system and an external medium; thus no\nspecific kind of dissipative forces is invoked. We show that, under assumption\nthat dissipation is weak and slow, the evolutionary routes of the migrating\nplanets are traced by the Mode I and Mode II stationary solutions of the\nconservative secular problem. The ultimate convergence and the evolution of the\nsystem along one of these secular modes of motion is determined uniquely by the\ncondition that the dissipation rate is sufficiently smaller than the proper\nsecular frequency of the system.

They are optically-thin to their own radiation\nand cool inefficiently. The optically-thick interior in contrast is heated only\nweakly, by re-emission from the atmosphere. The interior is colder than a\nclassical viscous model, and isothermal.\n  The magnetic fields support an extended atmosphere that absorbs the starlight\n1.5 times higher than the hydrostatic viscous model.

All the previous studies on the core-accretion\nmodel assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly. In fact,\nthe envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals\nbecause icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via\nstrong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope.

Here we show that the\nsubset of accreting transitional disks with wide, optically thin inner holes of\n15 AU or more can only be sculpted by multiple planets orbiting inside each\nhole. Multiplanet systems provide two key ingredients for explaining the\norigins of transitional disks. First, multiple planets can clear wide inner\nholes where single planets open only narrow gaps. Second, the confined,\nnon-axisymmetric accretion flows produced by multiple planets provide a way for\nan arbitrary amount of mass transfer to occur through an apparently optically\nthin hole without over-producing infrared excess flux. Rather than assuming the\ngas and dust in the hole are evenly and axisymmetrically distributed, one can\nconstruct an inner hole with apparently optically thin infrared fluxes by\ncovering a macroscopic fraction of the hole's surface area with locally\noptically thick tidal tails.

Using linear\nperturbation theory, we analyze the observable properties of the gravitational\nwake due to the object circularly moving in a static homogeneous gaseous\nmedium, in order to derive the Bondi accretion radius $r_B$, the orbital\ndistance $r_p$, and the Mach number of the object. Supersonic motion, producing\na wake of spiral-onion shell structure, exhibits a single-armed Archimedes\nspiral and two-centered circular arcs with respect to the line of sight. The\npitch angle, arm width, and spacing of the spiral pattern are entirely\ndetermined by the orbital distance $r_p$ and Mach number of the object. The\narm-interarm density contrast is proportional to the Bondi accretion radius,\ndecreasing as a function of distance with a power index of -1. The background\ndensity distribution is globally changed from initially uniform to centrally\nconcentrated. The vertical structure of the wake is manifested as circular arcs\nwith the center at the object location. The angular extent of the arcs is\ndetermined by the Mach number of the object motion. Diagnostic probes of\nnonlinear wakes such as a detached bow shock, an absence of the definite inner\narm boundary, the presence of turbulent low density eddies, and elongated\nshapes of arcs are explained in the extension of the linear analysis. The\ndensity enhancement at the center is always $r_B/r_p$ independent of the\nnonlinearity, suggesting that massive objects can substantially modify the\nbackground distribution. These detailed understanding of the wake\ncharacteristics will provide an interpretative framework for both further\ntheoretical works under more complicated situations and future observations to\ndetect the gravitational wakes of hidden objects. \n\n"}

Standard practice is to quantify the initial turbulent\nvelocity field in a core in terms of the amount of turbulent energy (or some\nequivalent) and the exponent in the power spectrum (n \\equiv -d log Pk /d log\nk).

This is because {\\lambda}_MAX\ncarries most of the turbulent energy, and thereby influences both the amount\nand the spatial coherence of the angular momentum in the core.

The cold, dusty\nclumps surrounding RCW 120 are arranged in an almost spherical shell and\nharbour many young stellar objects. By performing high-resolution,\nthree-dimensional SPH simulations of HII regions expanding into fractal\nmolecular clouds, we investigate whether the formation of massive clumps in\ndense, swept-up shells necessarily requires the C&C mechanism. In a second\nstep, we use RADMC-3D to compute the synthetic dust continuum emission from our\nsimulations, in order to compare them with observations of RCW 120 made with\nAPEX-LABOCA at 870 micron. We show that a distribution of clumps similar to the\none seen in RCW 120 can readily be explained by a non-uniform initial molecular\ncloud structure. Hence, a shell-like configuration of massive clumps does not\nimply that the C&C mechanism is at work. Rather, we find a hybrid form of\ntriggering, which combines elements of C&C and Radiatively Driven Implosion\n(RDI). In addition, we investigate the reliability of deriving clump masses\nfrom their 870 micron emission. We find that for clumps with more than 100\nM_sun the observational estimates are accurate to within a factor of two and\nthat, even at these long wavelengths, it is important to account for the\nradiative heating from triggered, embedded protostars. \n\n"}

This\nis consistent with recent theoretical works, which indicate that the tidal Q of\nplanet-hosting stars can indeed be much larger than the values inferred from\nstellar binaries. On the other hand, recent measurements of Rossiter-McLaughlin\neffects in transiting hot Jupiter systems not only reveal that many such\nsystems have misaligned stellar spin with respect to the orbital axis, but also\nshow that systems with cooler host stars tend to have aligned spin and orbital\naxes. Winn et al. suggested that this obliquity - temperature correlation may\nbe explained by efficient damping of stellar obliquity due to tidal dissipation\nin the star. This explanation, however, is in apparent contradiction with the\nsurvival of these short-period hot Jupiters. We show that in the solar-type\nparent stars of close-in exoplanetary systems, the effective tidal Q governing\nthe damping of stellar obliquity can be much smaller than that governing\norbital decay. This is because for misaligned systems, the tidal potential\ncontains a Fourier component with frequency equal to the stellar spin frequency\n(in the rotating frame of the star). This component can excite inertial waves\nin the convective envelope of the star, and the dissipation of inertial waves\nthen leads to a spin-orbit alignment torque, but not orbital decay. By\ncontrast, for aligned systems, such inertial wave excitation is forbidden since\nthe tidal forcing frequency is much larger than the stellar spin frequency. We\nderive a general effective tidal evolution theory for misaligned binaries,\ntaking account of different tidal responses and dissipation rates for different\ntidal forcing components. \n\n"}

Radial-velocity\nmeasurements, taken with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the OHP, and Kepler\nphotometry (Q1 and Q2 data) were used to derive the orbital, stellar and\nplanetary parameters. KOI-135b and KOI-204b orbit their parent stars in 3.02\nand 3.25 days, respectively. They have approximately the same radius,\nRp=1.20+/-0.06 R_jup and 1.24+/-0.07 R_jup, but different masses Mp=3.23+/-0.19\nM_jup and 1.02+/-0.07 M_jup.

Our SOPHIE spectra of Kepler-17b, used both to measure the\nradial-velocity variations and determine the atmospheric parameters of the host\nstar, allow us to refine the characterisation of the planetary system. In\nparticular we found the radial-velocity semi-amplitude and the stellar mass to\nbe respectively slightly smaller and larger than Desert et al.

In quiescence the emission shows a forest of H2O lines,\nhighly excited OH lines, and the Q branches of the organics C2H2, HCN, and CO2,\nsimilar to the emission observed toward several T Tauri systems.

The first model\nis a ring of polar orbits that move in a plane perpendicular to the binary\npericenter direction. We favour this interpretation because it includes the\neffect of secular perturbations and the disk can survive for Gyr timescales.\nThe second model is a misaligned ring.

Theoretical studies encounter difficulties in\nexplaining their formation and origin. Here we propose a novel scenario for the\nproduction of planetary systems at such orbits, through the dynamical recapture\nof free floating planets (FFPs) in dispersing stellar clusters. This process is\na natural extension of the recently suggested scenario for the formation of\nwide stellar binaries. We use N-body simulations of dispersing clusters with\n10-1000 stars and comparable numbers of FFPs to study this process. We find\nthat planets are captured into wide orbits in the typical range ~100-10^6 AU,\nand have a wide range of eccentricities (thermal distribution). Typically, 3-6\nx (f_FFP/1) % of all stars capture a planetary companion with such properties\n(where f_FFP is the number of FFP per star). The planetary capture efficiency\nis comparable to that of capture-formed stellar-binaries, and shows a similar\ndependence on the cluster size and structure. It is almost independent of the\nspecific planetary mass; planets as well as sub-stellar companions of any mass\ncan be captured. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster size,\nand for a given cluster size the it increases with the host/primary mass. More\nthan one planet can be captured around the same host and planets can be\ncaptured into binary systems. Planets can also be captured into pre-existing\nplanetary and into orbits around black holes and massive white dwarfs, if these\nformed early enough before the cluster dispersal. In particular, stellar black\nholes have a high capture efficiency (>50 % and 5-10 x (f_FFP/1) % for capture\nof stars and planetary companions, respectively) due to their large mass.\nFinally, although rare, two FFPs or brown dwarfs can become bound and form a\nFFP-binary system with no stellar host. \n\n"}

We apply a\nporosity model based on recent N-body simulations of aggregate collisions,\nwhich allows us to study the porosity change upon collision for a wide range of\nimpact energies. As a first step, we neglect collisional fragmentation and\ninstead focus on dust evolution outside the snow line, where the fragmentation\nhas been suggested to be less significant than inside the snow line because of\na high sticking efficiency of icy particles. We show that dust particles can\nevolve into highly porous aggregates (with internal densities of much less than\n0.1 g/cm^3) even if collisional compression is taken into account. We also show\nthat the high porosity triggers significant acceleration in collisional growth.\nThis acceleration is a natural consequence of particles' aerodynamical property\nat low Knudsen numbers, i.e., at particle radii larger than the mean free path\nof the gas molecules. Thanks to this rapid growth, the highly porous aggregates\nare found to overcome the radial drift barrier at orbital radii less than 10 AU\n(assuming the minimum-mass solar nebula model).

We show that there exists an upper limit to the\nmagnetic interaction torque and energy dissipation rate in such model.

We construct the evolutionary tracks of growing\nplanets at planet traps in evolving protoplanetary disks and show that they\nprovide a good physical understanding of how these observational properties\narise. The fundamental feature of our model is that inhomogeneities in\nprotoplanetary disks give rise to multiple (up to 3) trapping sites for rapid\n(type I) planetary migration of planetary cores. The viscous evolution of disks\nresults in the slow radial movement of the traps and their cores from large to\nsmall orbital periods.

Hydrodynamical calculations in two and three dimensions are\nused to quantify the migration rates and analyze the conditions under which the\noutward migration mechanism may operate. The planets are taken to be fully\nformed after 1e6 and before 3e6 years. The orbital evolution of the planets in\nan evolving disk is then calculated until the disk's gas is completely\ndissipated. Orbital locking in the 3:2 mean motion resonance may lead to\noutward migration under appropriate conditions of disk viscosity and\ntemperature. However, resonance locking does not necessarily result in outward\nmigration. This is the case, for example, if convergent migration leads to\nlocking in the 2:1 mean motion resonance, as post-formation disk conditions\nseem to suggest. Accretion of gas on the planets may deactivate the outward\nmigration mechanism by raising the mass ratio M2/M1 and/or by reducing the\naccretion rate toward the star, hence depleting the inner disk.

The present work aims to better understand the properties of the\nobserved modes and the nature of their excitation. Using numerical solutions\ndescribing forced inertial modes of a uniformly rotating fluid inside a\nspherical shell, we first identify the observed oscillations of the Couette\nflow with non-axisymmetric, retrograde, equatorially anti-symmetric inertial\nmodes, confirming first attempts using a full sphere model. Although the model\nhas no differential rotation, identification is possible because a large\nfraction of the fluid in a spherical Couette flow rotates rigidly. From the\nobserved sequence of the excited modes appearing when the inner sphere is\nslowed down by step, we identify a critical Rossby number associated with a\ngiven mode and below which it is excited.

Our disk model has a cavity\n65 AU in radius, which is heavily depleted of sub-micron-sized dust grains, and\na small residual inner disk which produces a weak but still optically thick NIR\nexcess in the SED. To explain the contrast of the cavity edge in the Subaru\nimage, a factor of ~1000 depletion for the sub-micron-sized dust inside the\ncavity is required.

This system raises important\nquestions on the evolution of atmospheres for close-in exoplanets, and the\ndependence with planetary mass and irradiation. These questions can be\naddressed by Lyman-alpha transit observations of the extended hydrogen\nplanetary atmospheres, complemented by contemporaneous measurements of the\nstellar X-ray flux.

These simultaneous\nobservations cover two transits of 55 Cnc e and two inferior conjunctions of 55\nCnc b. They reveal the star as a bright Lyman-alpha target and a variable X-ray\nsource. While no significant signal is detected during the transits of 55 Cnc\ne, we detect a surprising Lyman-alpha absorption of 7.5 +/- 1.8% (4.2 sigma) at\ninferior conjunctions of 55 Cnc b.

This star is highly interesting as a\nyoung solar analogue. Aims. We used about 500 days of high-precision,\nhigh-duty-cycle optical photometry collected by Kepler to study the rotation of\nthe star and the evolution of its photospheric active regions. Methods. We\napplied a maximum-entropy light curve inversion technique to model the flux\nrotational modulation induced by active regions that consist of dark spots and\nbright solar-like faculae with a fixed area ratio. Their configuration was\nvaried after a fixed time interval to take their evolution into account. Active\nregions were used as tracers to study stellar differential rotation, and\nplanetary occultations were used to constrain the latitude of some spots.\nResults. Our modelling approach reproduces the light variations of Kepler-17\nwith a standard deviation of the residuals comparable with the precision of\nKepler photometry. We find several active longitudes where individual active\nregions appear, evolve, and decay with lifetimes comparable to those observed\nin the Sun, although the star has a spotted area ~10-15 times larger than the\nSun at the maximum of the 11-yr cycle.

In the Milky Way,\nclusters with more than 2000 stars only form in two types - starburst clusters\nand leaky clusters - each following a unique temporal development in the\nmass-radius plane. The aim is here to determine the encounter probability in\nthe range relevant to solar system formation for starburst or leaky cluster\nenvironments as a function of cluster age. N-body methods are used to\ninvestigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions\nbetween cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs. Using\nthe now available knowledge of the cluster density at a given cluster age it is\ndemonstrated that in starburst clusters the central densities over the first\n5Myr are so high (initially > 10^5 Msun pc^{-3}) that hardly any discs with\nsolar system building potential would survive this phase. This makes a\nstarburst clusters an unlikely environment for the formation of our solar\nsystem. Instead it is highly probable that the solar system formed in a leaky\ncluster (often classified as OB association). It is demonstrated that an\nencounter determining the characteristic properties existing in our solar\nsystems most likely happened very early on (< 2Myr) in its formation history\nand that after 5Myr the likelihood of a solar-type star experiencing such an\nencounter in a leaky cluster is negligible even if it was still part of the\nbound remnant. This explains why the solar system could develop and maintain\nits high circularity later in its development. \n\n"}

Terrestrial microlens parallax can\nbe measured whenever a microlensing event differs substantially as observed\nfrom two or more well-separated sites.

This observational fact has cast significant doubts on the\nimportance of disk-driven migration as a mechanism for production of hot\nJupiters, thereby reestablishing the origins of close-in planetary orbits as an\nopen question.

Transit observations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b\nrule out a cloud-free H2-dominated atmosphere, but are not able to determine\nwhether the lack of deep spectral features is due to high-altitude clouds or\nthe presence of a high mean molecular mass atmosphere. Here, we demonstrate\nthat one can unambiguously distinguish between cloudy mini-Neptunes and\nvolatile-dominated worlds based on the differences in the wing steepness and\nrelative depths of water absorption features in moderate-resolution NIR\ntransmission spectra (R~100). In a numerical retrieval study, we show for GJ\n1214b that an unambiguous distinction between a cloudy H2-dominated atmosphere\nand cloud-free H2 atmosphere will be possible if the uncertainties in the\nspectral transit depth measurements can be reduced by a factor of ~3 compared\nto the published HST WFC3 and VLT transit observations. We argue that the\nrequired precision for the distinction may be achievable with currently\navailable instrumentation by stacking 10-15 transit observations. We provide a\nscaling law that scales our quantitative results to other transiting\nsuper-Earths and Neptunes such as HD 97658b, 55 Cnc e, and GJ 436b. The\nanalysis is performed using an improved version of our Bayesian atmospheric\nretrieval framework. The new framework not only constrains the gas composition\nand cloud/haze parameters, but also determines our confidence in having\ndetected molecules and cloud/haze species through Bayesian model comparison.\nUsing the Bayesian tool, we demonstrate quantitatively that the subtle transit\ndepth variation in the Berta et al. (2012) data is not sufficient to claim the\ndetection of water absorption. \n\n"}

Here we demonstrate that the scattering effects at lower\nradio frequencies are less than previously thought, and that the bursts could\nbe detectable at redshifts out to about $z=0.5$ in surveys below 1 GHz. Using a\nsource model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometric\nluminosities $\\sim 8 \\times 10^{44}$ ergs/s uniformly distributed per unit\ncomoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density as\na function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found by\nThornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate and\nredshift probed by a given survey. The non-detection of any such events in\nArecibo 1.4 GHz survey data by Deneva et al., and the Allen Telescope Array\nsurvey by Simeon et al. is consistent with our model. Ongoing surveys in the\n1--2 GHz band should result in further discoveries.

The explanation in vogue borrows from the\nvortex literature by suggesting that these asymmetries are the result of dust\ntrapping in giant vortices, excited via Rossby wave instability (RWI) at\nplanetary gap edges. Due to the drag force, dust trapped in vortices will\naccumulate in the center, and diffusion is needed to maintain a steady state\nover the lifetime of the disk. While previous work derived semi-analytical\nmodels of the process, in this paper we provide analytical steady-state\nsolutions. Exact solutions exist for certain vortex models. The solution is\ndetermined by the vortex rotation profile, the gas scale height, the vortex\naspect ratio, and the ratio of dust diffusion to gas-dust friction. In\nprinciple, all these quantities can be derived from observations, which would\ngive validation of the model, also giving constrains on the strength of the\nturbulence inside the vortex core.

These outflows are often modelled to be isotropic, but this\nassumption is not realistic for fast rotators, bipolar jets and supernovae.\nHere we derive the general equations of motion for the time evolution of a\nsingle planet, brown dwarf, comet or asteroid perturbed by anisotropic mass\nloss in terms of a complete set of planetary orbital elements, the ejecta\nvelocity, and the parent star's co-latitude and longitude. We restrict our\napplication of these equations to 1) rapidly rotating giant stars, and 2)\narbitrarily-directed jet outflows. We conclude that the isotropic mass-loss\nassumption can safely be used to model planetary motion during giant branch\nphases of stellar evolution within distances of hundreds of au. In fact,\nlatitudinal mass loss variations anisotropically affect planetary motion only\nif the mass loss is asymmetric about the stellar equator.

We assume a free-fall velocity profile\nand, having found the best fit, vary the radii over which infall takes place.\nIn the well-studied Class 0 protostar NGC1333-IRAS4A we find that infall takes\nplace over the whole envelope to which our observations are sensitive (r>~1000\nAU). For 4 sources infall takes place on core to envelope scales (i.e.\n~10000-3000 AU). In 2 sources the inverse P-Cygni profiles seen in the\nground-state lines are more likely due to larger-scale motions or foreground\nclouds. Models including a simple consideration of the chemistry are consistent\nwith the observations, while using step abundance profiles are not. The\nnon-detection of excited water in the inner envelope in 6/7 protostars is\nfurther evidence that water must be heavily depleted from the gas-phase at\nthese radii. Infall in four of the sources is supersonic and infall in all\nsources must take place at the outer edge of the envelope, which may be\nevidence that collapse is global or outside-in rather than inside-out.

Within the context of this picture, significant\norbital obliquities characteristic of a substantial fraction of such planets\ncan be attributed to external torques that perturb the disks out of alignment\nwith the spin axes of their host stars. Therefore, the acquisition of orbital\nobliquity exhibits sensitive dependence on the physics of disk-star\ninteractions. Here, we analyze the primordial excitation of spin-orbit\nmisalignment of Sun-like stars, in light of disk-star angular momentum\ntransfer. We begin by calculating the stellar pre-main sequence rotational\nevolution, accounting for spin-up due to gravitational contraction and\naccretion as well as spin-down due to magnetic star-disk coupling. We devote\nparticular attention to angular momentum transfer by accretion, and show that\nwhile generally subdominant to gravitational contraction, this process is\nlargely controlled by the morphology of the stellar magnetic field (i.e.\nspecific angular momentum accreted by stars with octupole-dominated surface\nfields is smaller than that accreted by dipole-dominated stars by an order of\nmagnitude). Subsequently, we examine the secular spin-axis dynamics of\ndisk-bearing stars, accounting for the time-evolution of stellar and disk\nproperties and demonstrate that misalignments are preferentially excited in\nsystems where stellar rotation is not overwhelmingly rapid. Moreover, we show\nthat the excitation of spin-orbit misalignment occurs impulsively, through an\nencounter with a resonance between the stellar precession frequency and the\ndisk-torquing frequency.

Systems are stable on\nthe MS if the planets are separated by more than ~9 Hill radii. Most systems\nsurviving the MS will remain stable until the WD phase, although planets\nscattered onto small pericentres in unstable systems can be swallowed by the\nexpanding stellar envelope when the star ascends the giant branches. Mass loss\nat the end of the asymptotic giant branch triggers delayed instability in many\nsystems, leading to instabilities typically occurring at WD cooling ages of a\nfew 100 Myr. This instability occurs both in systems that survived the star's\nprevious evolution unscathed, and in systems that previously underwent\nscattering instabilities. The outcome of such instability around WDs is\noverwhelmingly the ejection of one of the planets from the system, with several\ntimes more ejections occurring during the WD phase than during the MS.\nFurthermore, few planets are scattered close to the WD, just outside the Roche\nlimit, where they can be tidally circularised.

We employ a kinematic mean-field model for\npoloidal field transport and focus on steady states where inward advection of a\nfield balances with outward diffusion due to effective resistivities. We\nanalytically derive the steady-state radial distribution of poloidal fields in\nhighly conducting accretion disks. The analytic solution reveals an upper limit\non the strength of large-scale vertical fields attainable in steady states. Any\nexcess poloidal field will be diffused away within a finite time, and we\ndemonstrate this with time-dependent numerical calculations of the mean-field\nequations. We apply this upper limit to large-scale vertical fields threading\nprotoplanetary disks. We find that the maximum attainable strength is about 0.1\nG at 1 AU, and about 1 mG at 10 AU from the central star. When combined with\nrecent magnetic accretion models, the maximum field strength translates into\nthe maximum steady-state accretion rate of $\\sim 10^{-7} M_\\odot {\\rm\nyr}^{-1}$, in agreement with observations.

The actual value depends on\nseveral factors: the location in the protoplanetary disk, atmospheric opacity,\nand the accretion rate of solids. Motivated by ongoing direct imaging searches\nfor giant planets, this study investigates core mass requirements in the outer\ndisk. To determine the fastest allowed rates of gas accretion, we consider\nsolid cores that no longer accrete planetesimals, as this would heat the\ngaseous envelope. Our spherical, two-layer atmospheric cooling model includes\nan inner convective region and an outer radiative zone that matches onto the\ndisk.

By fitting a disk profile to the entire population\nof Kepler planet candidates, Chiang & Laughlin (2013) constructed a\n\"minimum-mass extrasolar nebula\" with surface density profile Sigma r^-1.6.\nHere we use multiple-planet systems to show that it is inconsistent to assume a\nuniversal disk profile. Systems with 3-6 low-mass planets (or planet\ncandidates) produce a diversity of minimum-mass disks with surface density\nprofiles ranging from Sigma r^-3.2 to Sigma r^0.5 (5th-95th percentile). By\nsimulating the transit detection of populations of synthetic planetary systems\ndesigned to match the properties of observed super-Earth systems, we show that\na universal disk profile is statistically excluded at high confidence. Rather,\nthe underlying distribution of minimum-mass disks is characterized by a broad\nrange of surface density slopes. Models of gaseous disks can only explain a\nnarrow range of slopes (roughly between r^0 and r^-1.5). Yet accretion of\nterrestrial planets in a gas-free environment preserves the initial radial\ndistribution of building blocks. The known systems of hot super-Earths must\ntherefore not represent the structure of their parent gas disks and can not\nhave predominantly formed in situ. We instead interpret the diversity of disk\nslopes as the imprint of a process that re-arranged the solids relative to the\ngas in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks.

Anisotropic expansion will produce a\nshearing velocity field, causing objects to stream toward directions of faster\nexpansion and away from directions of slower expansion. This work tests the\nbasic cosmological assumption of isotropic expansion and thus the isotropy of\ndark energy. The simplest anisotropy will manifest as a quadrupolar curl-free\nproper motion vector field. We derive this theoretical signature using a\ntri-axial expanding metric with a flat geometry (Bianchi I model), generalizing\nand correcting previous work. We then employ the best current data, the Titov &\nLambert (2013) proper motion catalog of 429 objects, to measure the isotropy of\nuniversal expansion.

This\nprocess can produce systems of planets in co-orbital (Trojan or 1:1) resonance,\nin which two planets share the same orbit, usually separated by 60 degrees.\nCo-orbital systems are detectable among the planetary systems found by the\nKepler mission either directly or by transit timing variations. However, no\nco-orbital systems have been found within the thousands of Kepler planets and\ncandidates. Here we study the orbital evolution of co-orbital planets embedded\nin a protoplanetary disk using a grid-based hydrodynamics code. We show that\npairs of similar-mass planets in co-orbital resonance are disrupted during\nlarge-scale orbital migration. Destabilization occurs when one or both planets\nis near the critical mass needed to open a gap in the gaseous disk. A confined\ngap is opened that spans the 60 degree azimuthal separation between planets.\nThis alters the torques imparted by the disk on each planet -- pushing the\nleading planet outward and the trailing planet inward -- and disrupts the\nresonance. The mechanism applies to systems in which the two planets' masses\ndiffer by a factor of two or less. In a simple flared disk model the critical\nmass for gap opening varies from a few Earth masses at the inner edge of the\ndisk to 1 Saturn-mass at 5 AU. A pair of co-orbital planets with masses in this\nrange that migrates will enter a region where the planets are at the\ngap-opening limit. At that point the resonance is disrupted.

Here we show that for large\ngrains (size >0.1 micron, containing most grain mass) in sufficiently large\nmolecular clouds (radii >1-10 pc, masses >10^4 M_sun), this scale becomes\nlarger than the characteristic sizes of pre-stellar cores (the sonic length),\nso large fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio are imprinted on cores. As a\nresult, star clusters and protostellar disks formed in large clouds should\nexhibit significant abundance spreads in the elements preferentially found in\nlarge grains. This naturally predicts populations of carbon-enhanced stars,\ncertain highly unusual stellar populations observed in nearby open clusters,\nand may explain the 'UV upturn' in early-type galaxies. It will also\ndramatically change planet formation in the resulting protostellar disks, by\npreferentially 'seeding' disks with an enhancement in large carbonaceous or\nsilicate grains. The relevant threshold for this behavior scales simply with\ncloud densities and temperatures, making straightforward predictions for\nclusters in starbursts and high-redshift galaxies.

We use asteroseismology to model\nthe star from the extracted frequencies using two different approaches to the\nmodelling where either the MESA or the GARSTEC stellar evolution codes are\nadopted.

We\nfind evidence that the improvement in photometric precision depends on each\ntarget's position in the Kepler field of view, with worst precision near the\nedges of the field. Overall, this technique restores the median attainable\nphotometric precision to within a factor of two of the original Kepler\nphotometric precision for targets ranging from 10$^{th}$ to 15$^{th}$ magnitude\nin the Kepler bandpass, peaking with a median precision within 35% that of\nKepler for stars between 12$^{th}$ and 13$^{th}$ magnitude in the Kepler\nbandpass. \n\n"}

Though\ncounterintuitive, this assertion follows directly from stellar tidal\ninteraction theory and the evolution of lower mass stars. There is strong\nevidence that chromospheric activity of rapidly rotating young stars may be\nhigh enough to cause mass loss from atmospheres of potentially habitable\nplanets. The removal of atmospheric water is most critical. Tidal breaking in\nbinaries could help reduce magnetic dynamo action and thereby chromospheric\nactivity in favor of life. We call this the Binary Habitability Mechanism\n(BHM), that we suggest allows for water retention at levels comparable to or\nbetter than Earth. We discuss novel advantages that life may exploit, in these\ncases, and suggest that life may even thrive on some circumbinary planets. We\nfind that while many binaries do not benefit from BHM, high quality niches do\nexist for various combinations of stars between 0.55 and 1.0 solar masses. For\na given pair of stellar masses, BHM operates only for certain combinations of\nperiod and eccentricity. Binaries having a solar-type primary seem to be quite\nwell suited niches having wide and distant habitable zones with plentiful water\nand sufficient light for photosynthetic life. We speculate that, as a direct\nresult of BHM, conditions may be suitable for life on several planets and\npossibly even moons of giant planets orbiting some binaries.

Our\napproach is to use the full kinetics model to survey the parameter space with\neffective temperatures between 500 K and 1100 K. In all of these worlds\nequilibrium chemistry favors CH4 over CO in the parts of the atmosphere that\ncan be seen from Earth, but in most disequilibrium favors CO. The small surface\ngravity of a planet strongly discriminates against CH4 when compared to an\notherwise comparable brown dwarf. If vertical mixing is like Jupiter's, the\ntransition from methane to CO occurs at 500 K in a planet. Sluggish vertical\nmixing can raise this to 600 K; but clouds or more vigorous vertical mixing\ncould lower this to 400 K. The comparable thresholds in brown dwarfs are\n$1100\\pm100$ K. Ammonia is also sensitive to gravity, but unlike CH4/CO, the\nNH3/N2 ratio is insensitive to mixing, which makes NH3 a potential proxy for\ngravity. HCN may become interesting in high gravity brown dwarfs with very\nstrong vertical mixing. Detailed analysis of the CO-CH4 reaction network\nreveals that the bottleneck to CO hydrogenation goes through methanol, in\npartial agreement with previous work.

The orbit of a\nplanet around a binary stellar system poses several dynamic constraints. The\neffects that radiation from the host stars may have on the planet atmospheres\nmust be considered. Because of the configuration of a close binary system,\nthese stars have a high rotation rate, which causes a permanent state of high\nstellar activity and copious XUV radiation. The accumulated effects are\nstronger than for exoplanets around single stars, and cause a faster\nevaporation of their atmospheres. We evaluate the effects that stellar\nradiation has on the evaporation of exoplanets around binary systems and on the\nsurvival of these planets. We considered the XUV spectral range to account for\nthe photons that are easily absorbed by a planet atmosphere that is mainly\ncomposed of hydrogen. A more complex atmospheric composition is expected to\nabsorb this radiation more efficiently. We used direct X-ray observations to\nevaluate the energy in the X-rays range and coronal models to calculate the\n(nondetectable) EUV part of the spectrum. The simulations show that exoplanets\nin a close orbit will suffer strong photoevaporation that may cause a total\nloss of atmosphere in a short time. A binary system of two solar-like stars\nwill be highly efficient in evaporating the atmosphere of the planet. These\nsystems will be difficult to find, even if they are dynamically stable. Still,\nplanets may orbit around binary systems of low mass stars for wider orbits.\nCurrently known circumbinary planets are not substantially affected by thermal\nphotoevaporation processes, unless Kepler-47 b has an inflated atmosphere. The\ndistribution of the orbital periods of circumbinary planets is shifted to much\nlonger periods than the average of Kepler planets, which supports a scenario of\nstrong photoevaporation in close-in circumbinary planets. \n\n"}

We study the impact of the presence of planets on the lithium abundance\nof host stars and evaluate the previous claim that planet hosts exhibit lithium\ndepletion when compared to their non-host counterparts.\n  Methods. Using previously published lithium abundances, we remove the\nconfounding effect of the different fundamental stellar parameters by applying\na multivariable regression on our dataset. In doing so, we explicitly make an\nassumption made implicitly by different authors: that lithium abundance depends\nlinearly on fundamental stellar parameters. Using a moderator variable to\ndistinguish stars with planets from those without, we evaluate the existence of\nan offset in lithium abundances between the two groups. We perform this\nanalysis first for stars that present a clear lithium detection exclusively and\ninclude in a second analysis upper lithium measurements.\n  Results. Our analysis shows that under the above-mentioned assumption of\nlinearity, a statistically significant negative offset in lithium abundance\nbetween planet hosts and non-hosts is recovered. We concluded that an inflation\non the lithium uncertainty estimations by a factor of larger than 5 is required\nto render the measured offset compatible with zero at less than 3-4 {\\sigma}\nand make it non-significant. We demonstrated that the offset as delivered by\nour method depends on the different nature of the stars in the two samples. We\ndid so by showing that the offset is reduced down to zero if the planet-host\nstars are replaced by comparison stars. Moreover, the measured depletion is\nstill significant when one imposes different constraints on the dataset, such\nas a limit in planetary mass or constrain the host temperature to around solar\nvalue.

All three\nnon-ideal MHD effects, Ohmic resistivity, the Hall effect and ambipolar\ndiffusion are included in a self-consistent manner based on equilibrium\nchemistry. We focus on regions toward outer disk radii, from 5-60AU, where\nOhmic resistivity tends to become negligible, ambipolar diffusion dominates\nover an extended region across disk height, and the Hall effect largely\ncontrols the dynamics near the disk midplane. We find that around R=5AU, the\nsystem launches a laminar/weakly turbulent magnetocentrifugal wind when the net\nvertical field Bz is not too weak, as expected. Moreover, the wind is able to\nachieve and maintain a configuration with reflection symmetry at disk midplane.\nThe case with anti-aligned field polarity (Omega. Bz<0) is more susceptible to\nthe MRI when Bz drops, leading to an outflow oscillating in radial directions\nand very inefficient angular momentum transport. At the outer disk around and\nbeyond R=30AU, the system shows vigorous MRI turbulence in the surface layer\ndue to far-UV ionization, which efficiently drives disk accretion. The Hall\neffect affects the stability of the midplane region to the MRI, leading to\nstrong/weak Maxwell stress for aligned/anti-aligned field polarities.\nNevertheless, the midplane region is only very weakly turbulent. Overall, the\nbasic picture is analogous to the conventional layered accretion scenario\napplied to the outer disk. In addition, we find that the vertical magnetic flux\nis strongly concentrated into thin, azimuthally extended shells in most of our\nsimulations beyond 15AU. This is a generic phenomenon unrelated to the Hall\neffect, and leads to enhanced zonal flow. Observational and theoretical\nimplications, as well as future prospects are briefly discussed. \n\n"}

The YORP effect, which arises from radiation pressure, accelerates\nthe spin rate of asymmetric asteroids, which can eventually shear themselves\napart. This pressure is maintained and enhanced around dying stars because the\noutward push of an asteroid due to stellar mass loss is insignificant compared\nto the resulting stellar luminosity increase. Consequently, giant star\nradiation will destroy nearly all bodies with radii in the range 100 m - 10 km\nthat survive their parent star's main sequence lifetime within a distance of\nabout 7 au; smaller bodies are spun apart to their strongest, competent\ncomponents.

Stars with\nlow-gravity planets have on average a lower chromospheric flux. We propose that\nthis correlation is due to the absorption by circumstellar matter that comes\nfrom the evaporation of the planets. Planets with a lower gravity have a\ngreater mass-loss rate which leads to a higher column density of circumstellar\nabsorption and this in turn explains the lower level of chromospheric emission\nobserved in their host stars. We estimated the required column density and\nfound that planetary evaporation can account for it. We derived a theoretical\nrelationship between the chromospheric emission as measured in the core of the\nCa II H&K lines and the planet gravity. We applied this relationship to a\nsample of transiting systems for which both the stellar Ca II H&K emission and\nthe planetary surface gravity are known and found a good agreement, given the\nvarious sources of uncertainties and the intrinsic variability of the stellar\nemissions and planetary evaporation rates.

A possible channel for producing such\nmisaligned hot Jupiters involves Lidov-Kozai oscillations of the planet's\norbital eccentricity and inclination driven by a distant binary companion. In a\nrecent work (Storch, Anderson & Lai 2014), we have shown that a proto-hot\nJupiter undergoing Lidov-Kozai oscillations can induce complex, and often\nchaotic, evolution of the spin axis of its host star. Here we explore the\norigin of the chaotic spin behavior and its various features in an idealized\nnon-dissipative system where the secular oscillations of the planet's orbit are\nstrictly periodic. Using Hamiltonian perturbation theory, we identify a set of\nsecular spin-orbit resonances in the system, and show that overlaps of these\nresonances are responsible for the onset of wide-spread chaos in the evolution\nof stellar spin axis. The degree of chaos in the system depends on the\nadiabaticity parameter $\\epsilon$, proportional to the ratio of the Lidov-Kozai\nnodal precession rate and the stellar spin precession rate, and thus depends on\nthe planet mass, semi-major axis and the stellar rotation rate. For systems\nwith zero initial spin-orbit misalignment, our theory explains the occurrence\n(as a function of $\\epsilon$) of \"periodic islands\" in the middle of a \"chaotic\nocean\" of spin evolution, and the occurrence of restricted chaos in middle of\nregular/periodic spin evolution. Finally, we discuss a novel \"adiabatic\nresonance advection\" phenomenon, in which the spin-orbit misalignment, trapped\nin a resonance, gradually evolves as the adiabaticity parameter slowly changes.\nThis phenomenon can occur for certain parameter regimes when tidal decay of the\nplanetary orbit is included. \n\n"}

We identified 156 planet candidates, including\none object that was not previously identified as a Kepler Object of Interest.\nWe inspected all publicly available follow-up images, observing notes, and\ncentroid analyses, and corrected for the likelihood of false positives.

We\nintroduce a new approach to simulate the gravitational evolution of cold\ncollisionless fluids by solving the Vlasov-Poisson equations in terms of\nadaptively refineable \"Lagrangian phase space elements\". These geometrical\nelements are piecewise smooth maps between Lagrangian space and Eulerian phase\nspace and approximate the continuum structure of the distribution function.\nThey allow for dynamical adaptive splitting to accurately follow the evolution\neven in regions of very strong mixing. We discuss in detail various one-, two-\nand three-dimensional test problems to demonstrate the performance of our\nmethod.

The\nbest example of this to date is the planet-metallicity correlation. Other\nproposed correlations are thus far less robust, in part due to uncertainty in\nthe chemical history of stars pre- and post-planet formation. Binary host stars\nof similar type present an opportunity to isolate the effects of planets on\nhost star abundances. Here we present a differential elemental abundance\nanalysis of the XO-2 stellar binary, in which both G9 stars host giant planets,\none of which is transiting. Building on our previous work, we report 16\nelemental abundances and compare the $\\Delta$(XO-2N-XO-S) values to elemental\ncondensation temperatures. The $\\Delta$(N-S) values and slopes with\ncondensation temperature resulting from four different pairs of stellar\nparameters are compared to explore the effects of changing the relative\ntemperature and gravity of the stars.

Furthermore, this probability rapidly approaches zero at increasing\norbital period. Therefore transit surveys have been predominantly limited to\nthe inner parts of exoplanetary systems. Here we demonstrate how circumbinary\nplanets allow us to beat these unfavourable odds. By incorporating the geometry\nand the three-body dynamics of circumbinary systems, we analytically derive the\nprobability of transitability, a configuration where the binary and planet\norbits overlap on the sky. We later show that this is equivalent to the transit\nprobability, but at an unspecified point in time. This probability, at its\nminimum, is always higher than for single star cases. In addition, it is an\nincreasing function with mutual inclination. By applying our analytical\ndevelopment to eclipsing binaries, we deduce that transits are highly probable,\nand in some case guaranteed. For example, a circumbinary planet revolving at 1\nAU around a 0.3 AU eclipsing binary is certain to eventually transit - a 100%\nprobability - if its mutual inclination is greater than 0.6 deg. We show that\nthe transit probability is generally only a weak function of the planet's\norbital period; circumbinary planets may be used as practical tools for probing\nthe outer regions of exoplanetary systems to search for and detect warm to cold\ntransiting planets. \n\n"}

Yet the connection between\nhost star metallicity and the properties of small planets is only just\nbeginning to be investigated. It has recently been argued that the metallicity\ndistribution of stars with exoplanet candidates identified by Kepler provides\nevidence for three distinct clusters of exoplanets, distinguished by planet\nradius boundaries at 1.7 R_Earth and 3.9 R_Earth. This would suggest that there\nare three distinct planet formation pathways for super-Earths, mini-Neptunes,\nand giant planets. However, as I show through three independent analyses, there\nis actually no evidence for the proposed radius boundary at 1.7 R_Earth. On the\nother hand, a more rigorous calculation demonstrates that a single, continuous\nrelationship between planet radius and metallicity is a better fit to the data.\nThe planet radius and metallicity data therefore provides no evidence for\ndistinct categories of small planets. This suggests that the planet formation\nprocess in a typical protoplanetary disk produces a continuum of planet sizes\nbetween 1 R_Earth and 4 R_Earth. As a result, the currently available planet\nradius and metallicity data for solar-metallicity F and G stars give no reason\nto expect that the amount of solid material in a protoplanetary disk determines\nwhether super-Earths or mini-Neptunes are formed. \n\n"}

We consider the hypothesis that these\ngaps are carved by planets, and present a general framework for understanding\nthe dynamical stability of such systems over typical disk lifetimes, providing\nestimates for the maximum planetary masses. We collect these easily evaluated\nconstraints into a workflow that can help guide the design and interpretation\nof new observational campaigns and numerical simulations of gap opening in such\nsystems. We argue that the locations of resonances should be significantly\nshifted in massive disks like HL Tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in the\nexact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty in\nthe dynamical state and stability in such disks. This presents an important\nbarrier to using systems like HL Tau as a proxy for the initial conditions\nfollowing planet formation. An important observational avenue to breaking this\ndegeneracy is to search for eccentric gaps, which could implicate resonantly\ninteracting planets. Unfortunately, massive disks like HL Tau should induce\nswift pericenter precession that would smear out any such eccentric features of\nplanetary origin. This motivates pushing toward more typical, less massive\ndisks. For a nominal non-resonant model of the HL Tau system with five planets,\nwe find a maximum mass for the outer three bodies of approximately 2 Neptune\nmasses.

However, great progress in this area has been\nmade in recent years due to the data collected by the present generation of\nground based detectors like the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array.\nIn particular, it is believed that the study of the composition of the cosmic\nrays as a function of energy can play a fundamental role for the understanding\nof the origin of the cosmic rays. The observatories belonging to this\ngeneration are composed of arrays of surface detectors and fluorescence\ntelescopes. The duty cycle of the fluorescence telescopes is ~10 % in contrast\nwith the ~100 % of the surface detectors. Therefore, the energy calibration of\nthe events observed by the surface detectors is performed by using a\ncalibration curve obtained from a set of high quality events observed in\ncoincidence by both types of detectors. The advantage of this method is that\nthe reconstructed energy of the events observed by the surface detectors\nbecomes almost independent of simulations of the showers because just a small\npart of the reconstructed energy, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes,\ncomes from simulations. However, the calibration curve obtained in this way\ndepends on the composition of the cosmic rays, which can introduce biases in\ncomposition analyses when parameters with a strong dependence on primary energy\nare considered. In this work we develop an analytical method to study these\neffects.

Analytical perturbation theory predicts the\nexistence of nested circumbinary orbits that are generalizations of circular\npaths around a single star. These orbits have forced eccentric motion aligned\nwith the binary as well as higher frequency oscillations, yet they do not\ncross, even in the presence of massive disks and perturbations from large\nplanets. For this reason, dissipative gas and planetesimals can settle onto\nthese \"most circular\" orbits, facilitating the growth of protoplanets. Outside\na region close to the binary where orbits are generally unstable, circumbinary\nplanets form in much the same way as their cousins around a single star. Here,\nwe review the theory and confirm its predictions with a suite of representative\nsimulations. We then consider the circumbinary planets discovered with NASA's\nKepler satellite. These Neptune- and Jupiter-size planets, or their\nplanetesimal precursors, may have migrated inward to reach their observed\norbits, since their current positions are outside of unstable zones caused by\noverlapping resonances. In situ formation without migration seems less likely,\nonly because the surface density of the protoplanetary disks must be\nimplausibly high. Otherwise, the circumbinary environment is friendly to planet\nformation, and we expect that many Earth-like \"Tatooines\" will join the growing\ncensus of circumbinary planets. \n\n"}

Mech. Dyn. Astron. vol. 116, 109, 2013) to the study of the rotation of\nstars hosting massive close-in planets. The stars have nearly the same tidal\nrelaxation factors as gaseous planets and the evolution of their rotation is\nsimilar to that of close-in hot Jupiters: they tidally evolve towards a\nstationary solution. However, stellar rotation may also be affected by stellar\nwind braking. Thus, while the rotation of a quiet host star evolves towards a\nstationary attractor with a frequency ($1+6e^2$) times the orbital mean-motion\nof the companion, the continuous loss of angular momentum in an active star\ndisplaces the stationary solution towards slower values: Active host stars with\nbig close-in companions tend to have rotational periods larger than the orbital\nperiods of their companions.

In this\npaper we present the predictions of the disc fragmentation model regarding the\nproperties of the discs around such low-mass objects. We find that the discs\naround objects that have formed by fragmentation in discs hosted by Sun-like\nstars (referred to as 'parent' discs and 'parent' stars) are more massive than\nexpected from the ${M}_{\\rm disc}-M_*$ relation (which is derived for stars\nwith masses $M_*>0.2 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$). Accordingly, the accretion rates onto\nthese objects are also higher than expected from the $\\dot{M}_*-M_*$ relation.\nMoreover there is no significant correlation between the mass of the brown\ndwarf or planet with the mass of its disc nor with the accretion rate from the\ndisc onto it. The discs around objects that form by disc fragmentation have\nlarger than expected masses as they accrete gas from the disc of their parent\nstar during the first few kyr after they form. The amount of gas that they\naccrete and therefore their mass depend on how they move in their parent disc\nand how they interact with it. Observations of disc masses and accretion rates\nonto very low-mass objects are consistent with the predictions of the disc\nfragmentation model. Future observations (e.g. by ALMA) of disc masses and\naccretion rates onto substellar objects that have even lower masses (young\nplanets and young, low-mass brown dwarfs), where the scaling relations\npredicted by the disc fragmentation model diverge significantly from the\ncorresponding relations established for higher-mass stars, will test the\npredictions of this model. \n\n"}

Radiometer analysis can\nbe performed in different bases, e.g., isotropic, pixel or spherical harmonic.\nEach of these analyses possesses a common temporal symmetry which we exploit\nhere to fold the whole dataset for every detector pair, typically a few hundred\nto a thousand days of data, to only one sidereal day, without any compromise in\nprecision.

This gas envelope, if more massive\nthan a few percent of the core (with a mass below $10 M_\\oplus$), has a cooling\ntime that is much longer than the time-scale on which the planet exits the\ndisk. As such, it could not have contracted significantly from its original\nsize, of order the Bondi radius. So a newly exposed proto-planet would be\nlosing mass via a Parker wind that is catalyzed by the stellar continuum\nradiation. This represents an intermediate stage of mass-loss, occurring soon\nafter the disc has dispersed, but before the EUV/X-ray driven photoevaporation\nbecomes relevant. The surface mass-loss induces a mass movement within the\nenvelope that advects internal heat outward. As a result, the planet atmosphere\nrapidly cools down and contracts, until it has reached a radius of order $0.1$\nBondi radius, at which time the mass-loss effectively shuts down. Within a\nmillion years after the disk disperses, we find a planet that has only about\nten percent of its original envelope, and a Kelvin-Helmholtz time that is much\nlonger than its actual age.

From the multitude of\nexisting deconvolution algorithms several are already used in astronomy, but in\nthe special case of $\\gamma$-ray astronomy most of these algorithms are\nchallenged due to the high noise level within the measured data.\n  One promising algorithm for the application to $\\gamma$-ray data is the\nMaximum Entropy Algorithm.

The PMTs in their cameras are\ndesigned to operate under moonlight, but they are limited to Moon phases below\n93% (300 Moon hours per year), as they can get damaged if the amount of light\nthey receive is too high. As a result, they cannot be used in the three to five\nnights around full Moon. We have selected commercial inexpensive UV-pass\nfilters rejecting light above a wavelength of 420 nm, where the moonlight\nintensity is stronger. We mounted them on light-weight frames that can be\neasily installed on the telescope cameras. Test observations have been\nperformed during the last nine months, from which a moonlight transmission of\nabout 20% and a Cherenkov light transmission of about 45% are estimated.

We propose new standard dust opacities for disk\nmodels, we present a simplified treatment of PAHs sufficient to reproduce the\nPAH emission features, and we suggest using a simple treatment of dust\nsettling. We roughly adjust parameters to obtain a model that predicts typical\nClass II T Tauri star continuum and line observations. We systematically study\nthe impact of each model parameter (disk mass, disk extension and shape, dust\nsettling, dust size and opacity, gas/dust ratio, etc.) on all continuum and\nline observables, in particular on the SED, mm-slope, continuum visibilities,\nand emission lines including [OI] 63um, high-J CO lines, (sub-)mm CO\nisotopologue lines, and CO fundamental ro-vibrational lines. We find that\nevolved dust properties (large grains) often needed to fit the SED, have\nimportant consequences for disk chemistry and heating/cooling balance, leading\nto stronger emission lines in general. Strong dust settling and missing disk\nflaring have similar effects on continuum observations, but opposite effects on\nfar-IR gas emission lines. PAH molecules can shield the gas from stellar UV\nradiation because of their strong absorption and negligible scattering\nopacities. The observable millimetre-slope of the SED can become significantly\nmore gentle in the case of cold disk midplanes, which we find regularly in our\nT Tauri models. We propose to use line observations of robust chemical tracers\nof the gas, such as O, CO, and H2, as additional constraints to determine some\nkey properties of the disks, such as disk shape and mass, opacities, and the\ndust/gas ratio, by simultaneously fitting continuum and line observations. \n\n"}

As\na consequence, particles fragment at lower collision velocities than in regions\nbeyond the snow line. This effect allows small particles to be maintained for\nup to a few Myrs within the first astronomical unit. These particles are\nclosely coupled to the gas and do not drift significantly with respect to the\ngas. For lower mass planets (1$M_{\\rm{Jup}}$), the pre-transition appearance\ncan be maintained even longer because dust still trickles through the gap\ncreated by the planet, moves invisibly and quickly in the form of relatively\nlarge grains through the gap, and becomes visible again as it fragments and\ngets slowed down inside of the snow line.

In\nthese systems, some of the open field lines do not allow the flow to pass\nsmoothly through the sonic point, so that steady-state solutions do not exist\nin general. This paper focuses on this type of magnetic field configuration,\nwhere the resulting flow becomes manifestly time-dependent. We consider the\ncase of both steady heating and time-variable heating, and find the time scales\nfor the corresponding time variations of the outflow. Because the flow cannot\npass through the sonic transition, it remains subsonic and leads to so-called\nbreeze solutions. One manifestation of the time variability is that the flow\nsamples a collection of different breeze solutions over time, and the mass\noutflow rate varies in quasi-periodic fashion. Because the flow is subsonic,\ninformation can propagate inward from the outer boundary, which determines, in\npart, the time scale of the flow variability. This work finds the relationship\nbetween the outer boundary scale and the time scale of flow variations. In\npractice, the location of the outer boundary is set by the extent of the sphere\nof influence of the planet.

By combining the new\nHerschel spectra with archival Spitzer-IRS spectroscopy, we retrieve a\nparameterized radial surface water vapor distribution from 0.1-100 AU using\ntwo-dimensional dust and line radiative transfer modeling. The surface water\ndistribution is modeled with a step model comprising of a constant inner and\nouter relative water abundance and a critical radius at which the surface water\nabundance is allowed to change. We find that the four disks have critical radii\nof $\\sim 3-11$ AU, at which the surface water abundance decreases by at least 5\norders of magnitude. The measured values for the critical radius are\nconsistently smaller than the location of the surface snow line, as predicted\nby the observed spectral energy distribution. This suggests that the sharp\ndrop-off of the surface water abundance is not solely due to the local\ngas-solid balance, but may also be driven by the de-activation of gas-phase\nchemical pathways to water below 300 K.

For slowly rotating stars the\ncentre-to-limb convective variation dominated the residuals (with amplitudes of\n10s of cm/s to ~1 m/s); however, for faster rotating stars the dominant\nresidual signature was due a non-Gaussian intrinsic profile (with amplitudes\nfrom 0.5-9 m/s).

A phased and distributed implementation is pursued which maximises the\naccess to regional funds, the availability of human resources and the\nsynergetic opportunities for the earth and sea sciences community. Three\nsuitable deep-sea sites are identified, namely off-shore Toulon (France), Capo\nPassero (Italy) and Pylos (Greece). The infrastructure will consist of three\nso-called building blocks.

Each building block thus constitutes a 3-dimensional\narray of photo sensors that can be used to detect the Cherenkov light produced\nby relativistic particles emerging from neutrino interactions. Two building\nblocks will be configured to fully explore the IceCube signal with different\nmethodology, improved resolution and complementary field of view, including the\nGalactic plane.

In the gravitational microlensing, we have\ntwo images with negative and positive parities. The negative-parity image is a\nfainter image and is produced at a closer angular separation with respect to\nthe lens star. In the case of a red-giant lens star and large impact parameter\nof lensing, this image can be eclipsed by the lens star. The result would be\ndimming the flux receiving from the combination of the source and the lens\nstars and the light curve resembles to an eclipsing binary system. In this\nwork, we introduce this phenomenon and propose an observational procedure for\ndetecting this eclipse. The follow-up microlensing telescopes with lucky\nimaging camera or space-based telescopes can produce high resolution images\nfrom the events with reddish sources and confirm the possibility of blending\ndue to the lens star.

We confirm that Pr0211b has a nearly circular orbit ($e =\n0.02 \\pm 0.01$), with an improvement of a factor two with respect to the\nprevious determination of its eccentricity, and estimate that Pr0211c has a\nmass $M_p\\sin i = 7.9 \\pm 0.2 M_J$, a period $P>$3500 days and a very eccentric\norbit ($e>$0.60).

We show that the majority of the observed Jupiter\npairs (twenty out of twenty-four) will be dynamically unstable if the inner\nplanet was placed at >~1AU distance from the stellar host. This finding is at\nodds with formation theories that invoke the migration of such planets from\nsemi-major axes >~1AU due to secular dynamical processes (e.g., secular chaos,\nLidov-Kozai oscillations) coupled with tidal dissipation. In fact, the results\nof N-body integrations show that the evolution of dynamically unstable systems\ndoes not lead to tidal migration but rather to planet ejections and collisions\nwith the host star. This and other arguments lead us to suggest that most of\nthe observed planets with a companion could not have been transported from\nfurther out through secular migration processes.

It is widely believed that these planets formed near the\nwater-ice line of the protoplanetary disk, and subsequently migrated into much\nsmaller orbits. Most of the proposed migration mechanisms can be classified\neither as disk-driven migration, or as excitation of a very high eccentricity\nfollowed by tidal circularization. In the latter scenario, the giant planet\nthat is destined to become a hot Jupiter spends billions of years on a\nhighly-eccentric orbit, with apastron near the water-ice line. Eventually,\ntidal dissipation at periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbit. If this is\ncorrect, then it should be especially rare for hot Jupiters to be accompanied\nby another giant planet interior to the water-ice line.

We employ 3 point spread function (PSF) subtraction methods to\nreduce the stellar glare and instrumental artifacts to confirm that there is a\nroughly 2:1 brightness asymmetry between the NW and SE extension. This specific\nfeature makes HD 111520 the most extreme examples of asymmetric debris disks\nobserved in scattered light among similar highly inclined systems, such as HD\n15115 and HD 106906. We further identify a tentative localized brightness\nenhancement and scale height enhancement associated with the disk at ~40 AU\naway from the star on the SE extension. We also find that the fractional\npolarization rises from 10 to 40% from 0.5\" to 0.8\" from the star. The\ncombination of large brightness asymmetry and symmetric polarization fraction\nleads us to believe that an azimuthal dust density variation is causing the\nobserved asymmetry. \n\n"}

In this article, we\ninvestigate the classification of stars into spectral types using only the\nshape of their diffraction pattern in a single broad-band image. We propose a\nsupervised machine learning approach to this endeavour, based on principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, followed by artificial\nneural networks (ANNs) estimating the spectral type. Our analysis is performed\nwith image simulations mimicking the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced\nCamera for Surveys (ACS) in the F606W and F814W bands, as well as the Euclid\nVIS imager. We first demonstrate this classification in a simple context,\nassuming perfect knowledge of the point spread function (PSF) model and the\npossibility of accurately generating mock training data for the machine\nlearning. We then analyse its performance in a fully data-driven situation, in\nwhich the training would be performed with a limited subset of bright stars\nfrom a survey, and an unknown PSF with spatial variations across the detector.\nWe use simulations of main-sequence stars with flat distributions in spectral\ntype and in signal-to-noise ratio, and classify these stars into 13 spectral\nsubclasses, from O5 to M5. Under these conditions, the algorithm achieves a\nhigh success rate both for Euclid and HST images, with typical errors of half a\nspectral class. Although more detailed simulations would be needed to assess\nthe performance of the algorithm on a specific survey, this shows that stellar\nclassification from single-band images is well possible. \n\n"}

Since the physics and geometry\nbehind the transit light curve and the Rossiter- McLaughlin effect\n(spectroscopic transit) are the same, the Rossiter-McLaughlin observations are\nexpected to be affected by the occultation of stellar active regions in a\nsimilar way.

Application of\nthis technique found a variation of radius with wavelength which was far too\nstrong to be explained by scattering processes in the planetary atmosphere. A\nfaint nearby star was subsequently detected, whose contamination of the transit\nlight curves might explain this anomaly. We present a reanalysis of published\ndata in order to characterise the faint star and assess its effect on the\nmeasured transmission spectrum. The faint star has a mass of 0.72 +/- 0.08 Msun\nand is almost certainly gravitationally bound to the planetary system. We find\nthat its effect on the measured physical properties of the planet and host star\nis small, amounting to a planetary radius larger by 0.6 sigma and planetary\ndensity smaller by 0.8 sigma. Its influence on the measured transmission\nspectrum is much greater: the spectrum now has a minimum around 760 nm and\nopacity rises to both bluer and redder wavelengths. It is a poor match to\ntheoretical spectra and the spectral slope remains too strong for Rayleigh\nscattering. The existence of the faint nearby star cannot therefore explain the\nmeasured spectral properties of this hot and inflated planet. We advocate\nfurther observations of the system, both with high spatial resolution in order\nto improve the measured properties of the faint star, and with higher spectral\nresolution to confirm the anomalous transmission spectrum of the planet. \n\n"}

We also determine each\nstar's mass using our newly determined radius and the stellar density, itself a\nvirtually model independent quantity from previously published transit\nanalyses. These stellar radii and masses are in turn used to redetermine the\ntransiting planet radii and masses, again using only direct observables. The\nmedian uncertainties on the stellar radii and masses are ~8% and ~30%,\nrespectively, and the resulting uncertainties on the planet radii and masses\nare ~9% and ~22%, respectively. These accuracies are generally larger than\npreviously published model-dependent precisions of ~5% and ~6% on the planet\nradii and masses, respectively, but the newly determined values are purely\nempirical.

Prior\nto Juno mission data arrival, we present Jupiter optimized calculations\nexploring the effect of different model parameters in the determination of\nJupiter's core and heavy element's mass. We perform comparisons between\nequations of state published recently. The interior model of Jupiter is\ncalculated from the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium, mass and energy\nconservation, and energy transport. The mass of the core and heavy elements is\nadjusted to match Jupiter's observational constrains radius and gravitational\nmoments.

The location of the region where\nHelium rain occurs as well as its timescale are important to determine the\ndistribution of heavy elements and helium in the interior of Jupiter.

We find that exoplanets with\norbital periods less than 10 days are preferentially found around metal-rich\nstars ([Fe/H]~ 0.15 +- 0.05 dex). The occurrence rates of these hot exoplanets\nincreases to ~30% for super-solar metallicity stars from ~10% for stars with a\nsub-solar metallicity. Cooler exoplanets, that resides at longer orbital\nperiods and constitute the bulk of the exoplanet population with an occurrence\nrate of >~ 90%, have host-star metallicities consistent with solar.

One possible origin for these asymmetries is dust\ntrapping in vortices formed at the edges of dead zones. We carry out\nhigh-resolution, two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of this scenario,\nincluding the effects of dust feedback. We find that, although feedback weakens\nthe vortices and slows down the process of dust accumulation, the dust\ndistribution in the disk can nonetheless remain asymmetric for many thousands\nof orbits. We show that even after $10^4$ orbits, or $2.5$ Myr when scaled to\nthe parameters of Oph IRS 48 (a significant fraction of its age), the dust is\nnot dispersed into an axisymmetric ring, in contrast to the case of a vortex\nformed by a planet. This is because accumulation of mass at the dead zone edge\nconstantly replenishes the vortex, preventing it from being fully destroyed. We\nproduce synthetic dust emission images using our simulation results. We find\nthat multiple small clumps of dust may be distributed azimuthally. These\nclumps, if not resolved from one another, appear as a single large feature.

Abstract: [Abridged] Regions of low ionisation where the activity of the\nmagneto-rotational instability is suppressed, the so-called dead zones, have\nbeen suggested to explain gaps and asymmetries of transition disks. We\ninvestigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified\nprescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on\nthe disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create\nsignatures similar to those observed in transition disks. For the dust\nevolution, we included the transport, growth, and fragmentation of dust\nparticles. To compare with observations, we produced synthetic images in\nscattered optical light and in thermal emission at mm wavelengths. In all\nmodels with a dead zone, a bump in the gas surface density is produced that is\nable to efficiently trap large particles ($\\gtrsim 1$ mm) at the outer edge of\nthe dead zone. The gas bump reaches an amplitude of a factor of $\\sim5$, which\ncan be enhanced by the presence of an MHD wind that removes mass from the inner\ndisk. While our 1D simulations suggest that such a structure can be present\nonly for $\\sim$1 Myr, the structure may be maintained for a longer time when\nmore realistic 2D/3D simulations are performed. In the synthetic images,\ngap-like low-emission regions are seen at scattered light and in thermal\nemission at mm wavelengths, as previously predicted in the case of planet-disk\ninteraction. As a conclusion, main signatures of transition disks can be\nreproduced by assuming a dead zone in the disk, such as gap-like structure in\nscattered light and millimetre continuum emission, and a lower gas surface\ndensity within the dead zone. Previous studies showed that the Rossby wave\ninstability can also develop at the edge of such dead zones, forming vortices\nand also creating asymmetries. \n\n"}

The high pebble accretion\nrates allow planetary cores to start their growth beyond 10 AU and subsequently\nmigrate to cold (>~ 1 AU), warm (~0.1 AU- 1AU) or hot (<~ 0.1 AU) orbits. In\nthis work we investigate how the formation of giant planets via pebble\naccretion influences their atmospheric chemical compositions. We find that\nunder the standard pebble accretion scenario, where the core is isolated from\nthe envelope, the resulting metallicities (O/H and C/H ratios) are sub-solar,\nwhile the C/O ratios are super-solar. Planets that migrate through the disk to\nbecome hot Jupiters accrete substantial amounts of water vapour, but still\nacquire slightly sub-solar O/H and super-solar C/O of 0.7-0.8. The metallicity\ncan be substantially sub-solar (~0.2-0.5x solar) and the C/O can even approach\n1.0 if the planet accretes its envelope mostly beyond the CO2 ice line, i.e.\ncold Jupiters or hot Jupiters that form far out and migrate in by scattering.\nAllowing for core erosion yields significantly super-solar metallicities and\nsolar or sub-solar C/O, which can also be achieved by other means, e.g.\nphoto-evaporation and late-stage planetesimal accretion. \n\n"}

Abstract: Recently, high angular resolution imaging instruments such as SPHERE and GPI\nhave discovered many spiral-arm-like features in near-infrared scattered light\nimages of protoplanetary disks. Theory and simulations have suggested that\nthese arms are most likely excited by planets forming in the disks; however, a\nquantitative relation between the arm-to-disk brightness contrast and planet\nmass is still missing. Using 3D hydrodynamics and radiative transfer\nsimulations, we examine the morphology and contrast of planet-induced arms in\ndisks. We find a power-law relation for the face-on arm contrast ($\\delta_{\\rm\nmax}$) as a function of planet mass ($M_{\\rm p}$) and disk aspect ratio\n($h/r$): $\\delta_{\\rm max}\\approx((M_{\\rm p}/M_{\\rm J})/(h/r)^{1.38})^{0.22}$.\nWith current observational capability, at a 30 AU separation, the minimum\nplanet mass for driving detectable arms in a disk around a 1 Myr 1$M_\\odot$\nstar at 140 pc at low inclinations is around Saturn mass. For planets more\nmassive than Neptune masses, they typically drive multiple arms. Therefore in\nobserved disks with spirals, it is unlikely that each spiral arm originates\nfrom a different planet.

We consider a variant of\nthis model in which the companion is a giant planet with an orbital radius of a\nfew au. Guided by the results of published numerical simulations, we model the\ndynamical evolution of this system by dividing the disk into inner and outer\nparts---separated at the location of the planet---that behave as distinct,\nrigid disks. We show that the planet misaligns the inner disk even as the\norientation of the outer disk remains unchanged. In addition to the\noscillations induced by the precessional motion, whose amplitude is larger the\nsmaller the initial inner-disk-to-planet mass ratio, the spin--orbit angle also\nexhibits a secular growth in this case---driven by ongoing mass depletion from\nthe disk---that becomes significant when the inner disk's angular momentum\ndrops below that of the planet.

We find that for relative\nvelocities between the stellar and ISM lines smaller than 30-40 km/s and for\nISM CaII column densities logN$_{\\rm CaII}$>12, the ISM absorption has a\nsignificant influence on activity measurements. Direct measurements and three\ndimensional maps of the Galactic ISM absorption indicate that an ISM CaII\ncolumn density of logN$_{\\rm CaII}$=12 is typically reached by a distance of\nabout 100 pc along most sight lines.

This is why search\nalgorithms able to take into account a possible small mismatch between the\ngravitational waves frequency and the frequency inferred from electromagnetic\nobservations have been developed. In this paper we present an improved pipeline\nto perform such narrow-band searches for continuous gravitational waves from\nneutron stars, about three orders of magnitude faster than previous\nimplementations. The algorithm that we have developed is based on the {\\it\n5-vectors} framework and is able to perform a fully coherent search over a\nfrequency band of width $\\mathcal{O}$(Hertz) and for hundreds of spin-down\nvalues running a few hours on a standard workstation. This new algorithm opens\nthe possibility of long coherence time searches for objects which rotational\nparameters are highly uncertain. \n\n"}

We present a novel idea for detecting planets bound to such mass\ntransfer binaries: we propose that the X-ray light curves of these binaries be\ninspected for signatures of transiting planets. X-ray transits may be the only\nway to detect planets around some systems, while providing a complementary\napproach to optical and/or radio observations in others. Any planets associated\nwith X-ray binaries must be in stable orbits. We consider the range of\nallowable separations and find that orbital periods can be hours or longer,\nwhile transit durations extend upward from about a minute for Earth-radius\nplanets in very close orbits, to hours for Jupiter-radius planets in wider\norbits. The search for planets around mass transfer binaries could begin at\nonce with existing X-ray observations of these systems. If and when a planet is\ndetected around an X-ray binary, the size and mass of the planet may be readily\nmeasured, and it may also be possible to study the transmission and absorption\nof X-rays through its atmosphere.

We show that many tidal\nmodels provide thermal feedback, producing interior radiative zones and leading\nto enhanced g-mode dissipation with a wide spectrum of resonances.

We here present the detection of CO J=2-1 emission co-located with\ndust emission from the cometary belt in the 440 Myr-old Fomalhaut system.\nThrough spectro-spatial filtering, we achieve a 5.4$\\sigma$ detection and\ndetermine that the ring's sky-projected rotation axis matches that of the star.\nThe CO mass derived ($0.65-42 \\times10^{-7}$ M$_{\\oplus}$) is the lowest of any\ncircumstellar disk detected to date, and must be of exocometary origin. Using a\nsteady state model, we estimate the CO+CO$_2$ mass fraction of exocomets around\nFomalhaut to be between 4.6-76%, consistent with Solar System comets and the\ntwo other belts known to host exocometary gas. This is the first indication of\na similarity in cometary compositions across planetary systems that may be\nlinked to their formation scenario and is consistent with direct ISM\ninheritance. In addition, we find tentative evidence that $(49\\pm 27)$% of the\ndetected flux originates from a region near the eccentric belt's pericentre. If\nconfirmed, the latter may be explained through a recent impact event or CO\npericentre glow due to exocometary release within a steady state collisional\ncascade.

This problem thus far has largely been addressed only by\nconsidering two objects: the star and the planet itself. However, many systems\nhave been found to harbor multiple planets, with some in or very near to\nmean-motion resonances. The presence of a planetary companion near a\nmean-motion resonance can induce oscillatory variations in the mean-motion of\nthe planet, which we demonstrate can have significant effects on the spin-state\nof an otherwise synchronously rotating planet. In particular, we find that a\nplanetary companion near a mean-motion resonance can excite the spin states of\nplanets in the habitable zone of small, cool stars, pushing otherwise\nsynchronously rotating planets into higher amplitude librations of the spin\nstate, or even complete circulation resulting in effective stellar days with\nfull surface coverage on the order of years or decades. This increase in\nilluminated area can have potentially dramatic influences on climate, and thus\non habitability. We also find that the resultant spin state can be very\nsensitive to initial conditions due to the chaotic nature of the spin state at\nearly times within certain regimes. We apply our model to two hypothetical\nplanetary systems inspired by the K00255 and TRAPPIST-1 systems, which both\nhave Earth-sized planets in mean-motion resonances orbiting cool stars. \n\n"}

From the PMS to the RGB at solar\n  metallicity Abstract: Star-planet interactions must be taken into account in stellar models to\nunderstand the dynamical evolution of close-in planets. The dependence of the\ntidal interactions on the structural and rotational evolution of the star is of\npeculiar importance and should be correctly treated. We quantify how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of rotating low-mass stars evolves from\nthe pre-main sequence up to the red-giant branch depending on the initial\nstellar mass. We investigate the consequences of this evolution on planetary\norbital evolution. We couple the tidal dissipation formalism described in\nMathis (2015) to the stellar evolution code STAREVOL and apply it to rotating\nstars with masses between 0.3 and 1.4 M$_\\odot$. In addition, we generalize the\nwork of Bolmont & Mathis (2016) by following the orbital evolution of close-in\nplanets using the new tidal dissipation predictions for advanced phases of\nstellar evolution. On the PMS the evolution of tidal dissipation is controlled\nby the evolution of the internal structure of the contracting star. On the MS\nit is strongly driven by the variation of surface rotation that is impacted by\nmagnetized stellar winds braking. The main effect of taking into account the\nrotational evolution of the stars is to lower the tidal dissipation strength by\nabout four orders of magnitude on the main-sequence, compared to a normalized\ndissipation rate that only takes into account structural changes. The evolution\nof the dissipation strongly depends on the evolution of the internal structure\nand rotation of the star. From the pre-main sequence up to the tip of the\nred-giant branch, it varies by several orders of magnitude, with strong\nconsequences for the orbital evolution of close-in massive planets. These\neffects are the strongest during the pre-main sequence, implying that the\nplanets are mainly sensitive to the star's early history. \n\n"}

However, recent numerical simulations suggest\nthat the disk may evolve to a configuration perpendicular to the binary orbit\n(\"polar alignment\") if the binary is eccentric and the initial disk-binary\ninclination is sufficiently large. We carry out a theoretical study on the\nlong-term evolution of inclined disks around eccentric binaries, calculating\nthe disk warp profile and dissipative torque acting on the disk. For disks with\naspect ratio $H/r$ larger than the viscosity parameter $\\alpha$, bending wave\npropagation effectively makes the disk precess as a quasi-rigid body, while\nviscosity acts on the disk warp and twist to drive secular evolution of the\ndisk-binary inclination. We derive a simple analytic criterion (in terms of the\nbinary eccentricity and initial disk orientation) for the disk to evolve toward\npolar alignment with the eccentric binary. When the disk has a non-negligible\nangular momentum compared to the binary, the final \"polar alignment\"\ninclination angle is reduced from $90^\\circ$.

Dust grains radially\ndrift due to gas--dust friction, and the gas is affected by the feedback from\ndust grains. We investigate the effects of the feedback from dust grains on the\nviscous evolution of the gas, taking into account the vertical dust settling.\nThe feedback from the grains pushes the gas outward. When the grains are small\nand the dust-to-gas mass ratio is much smaller than unity, the radial drift\nvelocity is reduced by the feedback effect but the gas still drifts inward.\nWhen the grains are sufficiently large or piled-up, the feedback is so\neffective that forces the gas flows outward. Although the dust feedback is\naffected by dust settling, we found that the 2D approximation reasonably\nreproduces the vertical averaged flux of gas and dust. We also performed the 2D\ntwo-fluid hydrodynamic simulations to examine the effect of the feedback from\nthe grains on the evolution of the gas disk. We show that when the feedback is\neffective, the gas flows outward and the gas density at the region within $\\sim\n10\\ \\mbox{AU}$ is significantly depleted. As a result, the dust-to-gas mass\nratio at the inner radii may significantly excess unity, providing the\nenvironment where planetesimals are easily formed via, e.g., streaming\ninstability.

The clouds are produced by avalanches:\nradial outflows of dust that gain exponentially more mass as they shatter\nbackground disk particles in collisional chain reactions. The avalanches are\ntriggered from a region a few AU across -- the \"avalanche zone\" -- located on\nAU Mic's primary \"birth\" ring, at a true distance of $\\sim$35 AU from the star\nbut at a projected distance more than a factor of 10 smaller: the avalanche\nzone sits directly along the line of sight to the star, on the side of the ring\nnearest Earth, launching clouds that disk rotation sends wholly to the\nsoutheast, as observed.

Both methods involve reducing the dimension of the original\ndata-vector ( e.g. 1000 elements ) to the number of cosmological parameters\nconsidered ( e.g. seven ) using the Karhunen-Lo\\`eve algorithm. In the first\ncase, we run MCMC sampling on the compressed data-vector in order to recover\nthe one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) posterior distributions. The\nsecond option, approximately 2000 times faster, works by orthogonalising the\nparameter space through diagonalisation of the Fisher information matrix before\nthe compression, obtaining the posterior distributions without the need of MCMC\nsampling. Using these methods for future spectroscopic redshift surveys like\nDESI, EUCLID and PFS would drastically reduce the number of simulations needed\nto compute accurate covariance matrices with minimal loss of constraining\npower.

We estimate the magnetic energy available in the interaction using\nanalytical models to provide an upper bound to the expected flare energy.

Here we introduce\nthe Spectral Approach to TTVs technique that allows expanding the TTVs catalog\ntowards lower TTV amplitude, shorter orbital period, and shallower transit\ndepth. In the Spectral Approach we assume that a sinusoidal TTV exists in the\ndata and then calculate the improvement to $\\chi^2$ this model allows over that\nof linear ephemeris model. This enables detection of TTVs even in cases where\nthe transits are too shallow so individual transits cannot be timed. The\nSpectral Approach is more sensitive due to the reduced number of free\nparameters in its model.

It works by detecting the velocity of a host star induced\nby the gravitational effect of an orbiting planet, specifically the velocity\nalong our line of sight, which is called the radial velocity of the star.\nLow-mass planets typically cause their host star to move with radial velocities\nof 1 m/s or less. By analyzing a time series of stellar spectra from a host\nstar, modern astronomical instruments can in theory detect such planets.\nHowever, in practice, intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., star spots,\nconvective motion, pulsations) affects the spectra and often mimics a radial\nvelocity signal. This signal contamination makes it difficult to reliably\ndetect low-mass planets. A principled approach to recovering planet radial\nvelocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed by Rajpaul et\nal. (2015). It uses a multivariate Gaussian process model to jointly capture\ntime series of the apparent radial velocity and multiple indicators of stellar\nactivity. We build on this work in two ways: (i) we propose using dimension\nreduction techniques to construct new high-information stellar activity\nindicators; and (ii) we extend the Rajpaul et al. (2015) model to a larger\nclass of models and use a power-based model comparison procedure to select the\nbest model. Despite significant interest in exoplanets, previous efforts have\nnot performed large-scale stellar activity model selection or attempted to\nevaluate models based on planet detection power. In the case of main sequence\nG2V stars, we find that our method substantially improves planet detection\npower compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches. \n\n"}

The system expands with period ratios increasing and mean\neccentricities decreasing with time. This evolution is largely driven by tides\nacting on the innermost planets which then influence the outer ones. In order\nthat deviations from commensurability become significant only on $Gy$ time\nscales or longer, we require that the tidal parameter associated with the\nplanets has to be such that $Q' > \\sim 10^{2-3}.$ At the same time, if we start\nwith two subsystems, with the inner three planets comprising the inner one,\n$Q'$ associated with the planets has to be on the order (and not significantly\nexceeding) $10^{2-3}$ for the two subsystems to interact and end up in the\nobserved configuration.

To account for 'Oumuamua's detection, simple\narguments suggest that ~1 Earth mass of planetesimals are ejected per Solar\nmass of Galactic stars. However, that value assumes mono-sized planetesimals.\nIf the planetesimal mass distribution is instead top-heavy the inferred mass in\ninterstellar planetesimals increases to an implausibly high value.

By studying the arrival times of the p-mode maxima and\nminima through the O-C method, in a previous article the presence of a planet\nwas inferred with an orbital period of 3.2 yr and a minimum mass of 3.2 M_Jup.\nHere we present an updated O-C analysis using a larger data set of 1066 hours\nof photometric time series (~2.5x larger in terms of the number of data\npoints), which covers the period between 1999 and 2012 (compared with 1999-2006\nof the previous analysis).

Since\n2009, the O-C trend of f1 changes, and the time derivative of the pulsation\nperiod (p_dot) passes from positive to negative; the reason of this change of\nregime is not clear and could be related to nonlinear interactions between\ndifferent pulsation modes. With the new data, the O-C diagram of the secondary\npulsation frequency (f2) continues to show two components (parabola and sine\nwave), like in the previous analysis. Various solutions are proposed to fit the\nO-C diagrams of f1 and f2, but in all of them, the sinusoidal components of f1\nand f2 differ or at least agree less well than before.

Sets of transit depths so far measured at different wavelengths\n(called transmission spectra) are somewhat diverse: Some show steep spectral\nslope features in the visible, some contain featureless spectra in the\nnear-infrared, some show distinct features from radiative absorption by gaseous\nspecies.

Our aim is to model the gaseous CO$_2$ abundance in the inner disk and\nuse this to probe the efficiency of icy dust transport in a viscous disk.\nFeatures in the simulated CO$_2$ spectra are investigated for their dust flux\ntracing potential. We have developed a 1D viscous disk model that includes gas\nand grain motions as well as dust growth, sublimation and freeze-out and a\nparametrisation of the CO$_2$ chemistry. The thermo-chemical code DALI was used\nto model the mid-infrared spectrum of CO$_2$, as can be observed with\nJWST-MIRI. CO$_2$ ice sublimating at the iceline increases the gaseous CO$_2$\nabundance to levels equal to the CO$_2$ ice abundance of $\\sim 10^{-5}$, which\nis three orders of magnitude more than the gaseous CO$_2$ abundances of $\\sim\n10^{-8}$ observed by Spitzer.

I show\nthat objects with M <~ 4 M_Jup orbit metal-rich solar-type dwarf stars, a\nproperty associated with core accretion. Objects with M >~ 10 M_Jup do not\nshare this property. This transition is coincident with a minimum in the\noccurrence rate of such objects, suggesting that the maximum mass of a\ncelestial body formed through core accretion like a planet is less than 10\nM_Jup. Consequently, objects with M >~ 10 M_Jup orbiting solar-type dwarf stars\nlikely formed through gravitational instability and should not be thought of as\nplanets.

The observed variability of asymmetric,\ndouble-peaked emission line profiles in about half of such systems could be\ninterpreted as the signature of precession of an eccentric gaseous debris disk.\nThe variability timescales --- from decades down to $1.4$ yr (recently inferred\nfor the debris disk around HE 1349--2305) --- are in rough agreement with the\nrate of general relativistic (GR) precession in the test particle limit.\nHowever, it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can drive such a\nfast, coherent precession of a radially extended (out to $1 R_\\odot$) gaseous\ndisk mediated by internal stresses (pressure). Here we use the linear theory of\neccentricity evolution in hydrodynamic disks to determine several key\nproperties of eccentric modes in gaseous debris disks around WDs. We find a\ncritical dependence of both the precession period and radial eccentricity\ndistribution of the modes on the inner disk radius, $r_\\mathrm{in}$.

Power spectra, show a decay of the spectral amplitude as\na function of multipole for \\ell<200, typical of the diffuse emission. Spectra\ncan be approximated by a power law C_{\\ell}\\propto\\ell^{alpha}, with alpha~-3,\nand characterized by a B-to-E ratio of ~0.5. We study the synchrotron SED in\npolarization by computing power spectra of the low frequency WMAP and Planck\nmaps. Results show that the SED, in the frequency range 2.3-33 GHz, is\ncompatible with a power law with beta_s=-3.22\\pm0.08. Combining S-PASS\npolarization maps with those coming from WMAP and Planck we derived a map of\nthe synchrotron spectral index at angular resolution of 2{\\deg} on about 30% of\nthe sky. The recovered distribution peaks at the value around -3.2. We also\nmeasure a significant spatial correlation between synchrotron and thermal dust\nsignals, as traced by the Planck 353 GHz channel. This correlation reaches\nabout 40% on the larger angular scales, decaying considerably at the degree\nscales. Finally, we use the S-PASS maps to assess the polarized synchrotron\ncontamination to CMB observations of the B-modes. Moreover, by combining S-PASS\ndata with Planck 353 GHz observations, we recover a map of the minimum level of\ntotal polarized foreground contamination to B-modes, finding that there is no\nregion of the sky, at any frequency, where this contamination lies below\nequivalent tenor-to-scalar ratio ~10^-3. This result confirms the importance of\nobserving both high and low frequency foregrounds in CMB B-mode measurements. \n\n"}

First are modes associated with attractors\nof characteristics that are made of thin shear layers closely following the\nperiodic orbit traced by the characteristic attractor. Second are modes made of\nshear layers that connect the critical latitude singularities of the two\nhemispheres of the inner boundary of the spherical shell.

As shown in Paper I, a dynamical corotation torque arises due to the\nflow-induced asymmetric distortion of the corotation region and the evolving\nvortensity contrast between the librating horseshoe material and background\ndisc flow. Using simulations of laminar torqued discs containing migrating\nplanets, we demonstrate the existence of the four distinct migration regimes\npredicted in Paper I.

A low-mass companion, HD 142527 B,\nwas also found orbiting the primary star at $\\sim$14 au. This study aims to\nbetter characterize this companion, which could help explain its impact on the\npeculiar geometry of the disk. We observed the source with VLT/SINFONI in\n$H$+$K$ band in pupil-tracking mode. Data were post-processed with several\nalgorithms based on angular differential imaging (ADI). HD 142527 B is\nconspicuously re-detected in most spectral channels, which enables us to\nextract the first medium-resolution spectrum of a low-mass companion within\n0.1'' from its central star.

We combine observations and\nchemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to\nphysical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived.

The upper limits range between $\\sim 10^{11}$\nand $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical\nmodel matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at $r \\sim\n50-100$ au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets.

Such obliquities may reveal clues about hot Jupiter\ndynamical histories. Common explanations for generating obliquities include\nhigh-eccentricity migration and primordial disk misalignment. This paper\ninvestigates another mechanism for producing stellar spin-orbit misalignments\nin systems hosting a close-in planet with an external, modestly inclined\ncompanion. Spin-orbit misalignment may be excited due to a secular resonance,\noccurring when the precession rate of the stellar spin axis (driven by the\ninner planet) becomes comparable to the nodal precession rate of the inner\nplanet (driven by the companion). Due to the spin-down of the host star via\nmagnetic braking, this resonance may be achieved during the star's\nmain-sequence lifetime for a wide range of planet masses and orbital\narchitectures. Obliquity excitation is accompanied by a decrease in mutual\ninclination between the inner planet and perturber, and can thus erase high\ninclinations. For hot Jupiters, the stellar spin axis is strongly coupled to\nthe orbital axis, and obliquity excitation by a giant planet companion requires\na strong perturber, usually located within 1-2 AU. For warm Jupiters, the spin\nand orbital axes are more weakly coupled, and the resonance may be achieved for\ndistant giant planet perturbers (at several to tens of AU). Since warm Jupiters\nhave a high occurrence rate of distant planetary companions with appropriate\nproperties for resonant obliquity excitation, stellar obliquities in warm\nJupiter systems may be common, particularly for warm Jupiters orbiting cool\nstars that have undergone significant spin-down. \n\n"}

For\nthe formation process of glycine on the grain surface, we obtained consistent\nresults with previous studies that glycine would be formed via the reactions of\nCOOH with CH$_2$NH$_2$. However, we will report three important findings\nregarding the chemical evolution and the detectability of interstellar glycine.\nFirst, with the experimentally obtained binding energy from the temperature\nprogrammed thermal desorption (TPD) experiment, a large proportion of glycine\nwas destroyed through the grain surface reactions with NH or CH$_3$O radicals\nbefore it fully evaporates. As a result, the formation process in the gas phase\nis more important than thermal evaporation from grains. If this is the case,\nNH$_2$OH and CH$_3$COOH rather than CH$_3$NH$_2$ and CH$_2$NH would be the\nessential precursors to the gas phase glycine. Secondly, since the gas phase\nglycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, early\nevolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the\nfuture glycine surveys. Thirdly, we suggest the possibility that the\nsuprathermal hydrogen atoms can strongly accelerate the formation of COOH\nradicals from CO$_2$, resulting in the dramatic increase of formation rate of\nglycine on grains. The efficiency of this process should be investigated in\ndetail by theoretical and experimental studies in the future. \n\n"}

These exospheres are formed by surface\nparticles that have been sputtered by the wind of the host star. The stellar\nwind properties are derived from magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which are\ndriven by observationally-derived stellar magnetic field maps, and constrained\nby Ly-alpha observations of wind mass-loss rates, making this one of the most\nwell constrained model of winds of low-mass stars. The proximity of the planets\nto their host star implies a high flux of incident stellar wind particles, thus\nthe sputtering process is sufficiently effective to build up relatively dense,\nrefractory-rich exospheres. The sputtering releases refractory elements from\nthe entire dayside surfaces of the planets, with elements such as O and Mg\ncreating an extended neutral exosphere with densities larger than 10/cm3,\nextending to several planetary radii.

However, within the exoplanet direct\nimaging community, non-detections have almost exclusively been defined using a\nfrequentist detection threshold (i.e. contrast curve) and associated\ncompleteness. This can lead to conceptual inconsistencies when included in a\nBayesian framework. A Bayesian upper limit is such that the true value of a\nparameter lies below this limit with a certain probability. The associated\nprobability is the integral of the posterior distribution with the upper limit\nas the upper bound. In summary, a frequentist upper limit is a statement about\nthe detectability of planets while a Bayesian upper limit is a statement about\nthe probability of a parameter to lie in an interval given the data. The latter\nis therefore better suited for rejecting hypotheses or theoretical models based\non their predictions. In this work we emphasize that Bayesian statistics and\nupper limits are more easily interpreted and typically more constraining than\nthe frequentist approach.

HIP 79124 B is detected at a separation of only 180 mas\nin a highly-correlated noise regime, and it falls in the spectral range M6 pm\n0.5 with Teff = 2840 pm 190 and 100 MJup. Previous studies of stellar\npopulations in Sco-Cen have highlighted a discrepancy in isochronal ages\nbetween the lower-mass and higher-mass populations. This could be explained\neither by an age spread in the region, or by conventional isochronal models\nfailing to reproduce the evolution of low-mass stars. The HIP 79124 system\nshould be coeval, and therefore it provides an ideal laboratory to test these\nscenarios. We place the three components in a color-magnitude diagram and find\nthat the models predict a younger age for the two low-mass companions (3 Myr)\nthan for the primary star (6 Myr). These results imply that the omission of\nmagnetic effects in conventional isochronal models inhibit them from\nreproducing early low-mass stellar evolution, which is further supported by the\nfact that new models that include such effects provide more consistent ages in\nthe HIP 79124 system. \n\n"}

The planet has a radius of just 2 R$_{\\rm\\oplus}$ and it transits\na nearby Sun-like star of naked-eye brightness, making it the ideal target for\natmospheric characterisation of a super-Earth. Here we analyse archival\n$\\textit{ROSAT}$ and $\\textit{Swift}$ observations of $\\pi$ Men in order to\ndetermine the X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet irradiation of the planetary\natmosphere and assess whether atmospheric escape is likely to be on-going. We\nfind that $\\pi$ Men has a similar level of X-ray emission to the Sun, with\n$L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm bol} = (4.84^{+0.92}_{-0.84})\\times10^{-7}$. However, due to\nits small orbital separation, the high-energy irradiation of the super-Earth is\naround 2000 times stronger than suffered by the Earth. We show that this is\nsufficient to drive atmospheric escape at a rate greater than that readily\ndetected from the warm Neptune GJ 436b. Furthermore, we estimate $\\pi$ Men to\nbe four times brighter at Ly $\\alpha$ than GJ 436. Given the small atmospheric\nscale heights of super-Earths, together with their potentially cloudy\natmospheres, and the consequent difficulty in measuring transmission spectra,\nwe conclude that ultraviolet absorption by material escaping $\\pi$ Men c\npresents the best opportunity currently to determine the atmospheric\ncomposition of a super-Earth. \n\n"}

It is the first optical\ninterferometer capable of observing sources as faint as magnitude 19 in K-band.\nThis is possible thanks to the fringe tracker which compensates the\ndifferential piston based on measurements of a brighter off-axis astronomical\nreference source. The goal of this paper is to consign the main developments\nmade in the context of the GRAVITY fringe tracker. This could serve as basis\nfor future fringe tracking systems. The paper therefore covers all aspects of\nthe fringe tracker, from hardware, to control software and on-sky observations.\nSpecial emphasis is placed on the interaction between the group delay\ncontroller and the phase delay controller. The group delay control loop is a\nsimple but robust integrator. The phase delay controller is a state-space\ncontrol loop based on an auto-regressive representation of the atmospheric and\nvibrational perturbations. A Kalman filter provides optimal determination of\nthe state of the system. The fringe tracker shows good tracking performance on\nsources with coherent K magnitudes of 11 on the UTs and 9.5 on the ATs. It can\ntrack fringes with an SNR level of 1.5 per DIT, limited by photon and\nbackground noises. On the ATs, during good seeing conditions, the optical path\ndelay residuals can be as low as 75 nm root mean square. On the UTs, the\nperformance is limited to around 250 nm because of structural vibrations. \n\n"}

The unWISE Catalog has two advantages over the existing WISE\ncatalog (AllWISE): first, it is based on significantly deeper imaging, and\nsecond, it features improved modeling of crowded regions. The deeper imaging\nused in the unWISE Catalog comes from the coaddition of all publicly available\n3$-$5 micron WISE imaging, including that from the ongoing NEOWISE-Reactivation\nmission, thereby increasing the total exposure time by a factor of 5 relative\nto AllWISE. At these depths, even at high Galactic latitudes many sources are\nblended with their neighbors; accordingly, the unWISE analysis simultaneously\nfits thousands of sources to obtain accurate photometry. Our new catalog\ndetects sources at 5-sigma roughly 0.7 magnitudes fainter than the AllWISE\ncatalog and more accurately models millions of faint sources in the Galactic\nplane, enabling a wealth of Galactic and extragalactic science. In particular,\nrelative to AllWISE, unWISE doubles the number of galaxies detected between\nredshifts 0 and 1 and triples the number between redshifts 1 and 2, cataloging\nmore than half a billion galaxies over the whole sky. \n\n"}

The science program of\nPAN is multi- and cross-disciplinary, covering cosmic ray physics, solar\nphysics, space weather and space travel.

The precise measurement and monitoring of the energetic particles is\nalso a unique contribution to space weather studies. PAN will map the flux and\ncomposition of penetrating particles, which cannot be shielded effectively,\nprecisely and continuously, providing valuable input for the assessment of the\nrelated health risk, and for the development of an adequate mitigation\nstrategy.

We\nfollowed this system up with adaptive-optic imaging and spectroscopy to derive\nstellar parameters, search for stellar companions, and determine a planet mass.\nFrom our 75 radial velocity measurements using HIRES on Keck I and HARPS-N on\nTelescopio Nazionale Galileo, we constrained the mass of EPIC 247418783b to M_p\n= 6.49 $\\pm$ 1.16 M_Earth.

With a\nbulk density of 8.84+2.50-2.03 g cm-3, the planet is consistent with an\nEarth-like rock/iron composition and no substantial gaseous envelope.

The process of protoplanetary disc formation can result in\ninitial misalignments, where the disc orbital plane is different to the stellar\nequator in single star systems, or to the binary orbital plane in systems with\ntwo stars. A quirk of the dynamics means that initially misaligned\n`circumbinary' discs -- those that surround two stars -- are predicted to\nevolve to one of two possible stable configurations, one where the disc and\nbinary orbital planes are coplanar, and one where they are perpendicular (a\n`polar' configuration). Prior work has found coplanar circumbinary discs, but\nno polar examples were known until now. Here we report the first discovery of a\nprotoplanetary circumbinary disc in the polar configuration, supporting the\npredictions that such discs should exist. The disc shows some characteristics\nthat are similar to discs around single stars, and that are attributed to dust\ngrowth. Thus, the first stages of planet formation appear able to proceed in\npolar circumbinary discs. \n\n"}

The\ncomplex astrophysics involved in core-collapse supernovae pose a significant\nchallenge to modeling such phenomena. The Supernova Model Evidence Extractor\n(SMEE) attempts to capture the main features of gravitational wave signals from\ncore-collapse supernovae by using numerical relativity waveforms to create\napproximate models. These models can then be used to perform Bayesian model\nselection to determine if the targeted astrophysical feature is present in the\ngravitational wave signal. In this paper, we extend SMEE's model selection\ncapabilities to include features in the gravitational wave signal that are\nassociated with g-modes and the standing accretion shock instability. For the\nfirst time, we test SMEE's performance using simulated data for planned future\ndetectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and LIGO Voyager.\nFurther to this, we show how the performance of SMEE is improved by creating\nmodels from the spectrograms of supernova waveforms instead of their timeseries\nwaveforms that contain stochastic features. In third generation detector\nconfigurations, we find that about 50% of neutrino-driven simulations were\ndetectable at 100 kpc, and 10% at 275 kpc. The explosion mechanism was\ncorrectly determined for all detected signals. \n\n"}

It is designed to easily facilitate and enhance existing Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods by restricting plausible regions and exploring\nparameter space efficiently. However, PRISM can additionally be used as a\nstandalone alternative to MCMC for model analysis, providing insight into the\nbehavior of complex scientific models.

{"id": "1901.10386", "contents": "Title: Clumpy dust rings around non-accreting young stars Abstract: We investigate four young, but non-accreting, very low mass stars in Orion,\nwhich show irregular eclipses by circumstellar dust. The eclipses are not\nrecurring periodically, are variable in depth, lack a flat bottom, and their\nduration is comparable to the typical timescale between eclipses. The dimming\nis associated with reddening consistent with dust extinction. Taken together\nthis implies the presence of rings around these four stars, with radii ranging\nfrom 0.01 to 40 AU, comprised of optically thin dust clouds. The stars also\nshow IR excess indicating the presence of evolved circumstellar disks, with\norders of magnitude more material than needed for the eclipses. However, the\nrings need to cover an opening angle of about 20 degrees to explain how common\nthese variable stars are in the coeval population in the same region, which is\nmore extended than a typical disk. Thus, we propose that the rings may not be\npart of the disks, but instead separate structures with larger scale heights.\nTo be sustained over years, the rings need to be replenished by dust from the\ndisk or gravitationally bound to an object (e.g., planets or planetesimals).\nThese four stars belong to a growing and diverse class of post-T Tauri stars\nwith dips or eclipses in their lightcurves. Dusty rings with scale heights\nexceeding those of disks may be a common phenomenon at stellar ages between 5\nand 10 Myr, in the transition from accretion disks to debris disks. These\nstructures could be caused by migrating planets and may be signposts for the\npresence of young planetary systems. \n\n"}
