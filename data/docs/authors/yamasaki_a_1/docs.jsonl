Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L. We explicitly establish the validity of this statement\nfor the case of N=4. The details of the relevant calculations being distinctly\ntransparent, one can readily convince oneself that our observation is valid for\narbitrary N. It follows that the issues raised by DPK, such as non-existence of\nthe Luttinger-Ward functional and \"breakdown of the elemental particle picture\nin strongly correlated electron matter\", are all inessential to the observed\nfailure of the LT. As regards the singularity of the self-energy \\Sigma(\\omega)\non the real \\omega-axis, observed by DPK, we demonstrate that this also is a\ndirect consequence of the non-uniqueness of the GS of the SU(N) model for 0 < n\n< N.

We present a generalization of this method to arbitrary finite\ntemperature by making use of the full density matrix [Weichselbaum et al. Phys.\nRev. Lett. {\\bf 99}, 076402 (2007)]. We show that all terms in the projected\ndensity matrix $\\rho^{i\\to f} = \\rho^{++} + \\rho^{--} + \\rho^{+-}+\\rho^{-+}$ in\nthe time-evolution of a local observable may be evaluated in closed form, with\n$\\rho^{+-}=\\rho^{-+}=0$. The expression for $\\rho^{--}$ is shown to be finite\nat finite temperature, becoming negligible only in the limit of vanishing\ntemperatures. We prove that this approach recovers the short-time limit for the\nexpectation value of a local observable exactly at arbitrary temperatures. In\ncontrast, the corresponding long-time limit is only recovered exactly in the\nlimit $\\Lambda\\rightarrow 1^{+}$. This limit is impractical within NRG. We\nsuggest how to overcome this problem by noting that the long-time limit becomes\nincreasingly more accurate on reducing the size of the quantum quench.

The formalism for this is provided, generalizing the td-NRG to\nmultiple quantum quenches, periodic switching, and general pulses.

How superconductivity emerges\nfrom the magnetic state and what is the mechanism of the superconducting\npairing are two important issues which need to be resolved. In the present\nwork, the suppression of magnetism and the occurrence of superconductivity in\nCrAs as a function of pressure ($p$) were studied by means of muon spin\nrotation. The magnetism remains bulk up to $p\\simeq3.5$~kbar while its volume\nfraction gradually decreases with increasing pressure until it vanishes at\n$p\\simeq$7~kbar. At 3.5 kbar superconductivity abruptly appears with its\nmaximum $T_c \\simeq 1.2$~K which decreases upon increasing the pressure. In the\nintermediate pressure region ($3.5\\lesssim p\\lesssim 7$~kbar) the\nsuperconducting and the magnetic volume fractions are spatially phase separated\nand compete for phase volume.

Here we report high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved\nphotoemission measurements on ZrTe5. The electronic property of ZrTe5 is\ndominated by two branches of nearly-linear-dispersion bands at the Brillouin\nzone center. These two bands are separated by an energy gap that decreases with\ndecreasing temperature but persists down to the lowest temperature we measured\n(~2 K). The overall electronic structure exhibits a dramatic temperature\ndependence; it evolves from a p-type semimetal with a hole-like Fermi pocket at\nhigh temperature, to a semiconductor around ~135 K where its resistivity\nexhibits a peak, to an n-type semimetal with an electron-like Fermi pocket at\nlow temperature. These results indicate a clear electronic evidence of the\ntemperature-induced Lifshitz transition in ZrTe5. They provide a natural\nunderstanding on the underlying origin of the resistivity anomaly at ~135 K and\nits associated reversal of the charge carrier type. Our observations also\nprovide key information on deciphering the topological nature of ZrTe5 and\npossible temperature-induced topological phase transition. \n\n"}

For\nexample, the low-energy theory of the two-dimensional (2D) toric code model\n(i.e. the deconfined phase of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory) is a $U(1)\\times\nU(1)$ Chern-Simons theory in which gauge charges (i.e., $e$ and $m$ particles)\nare deconfined and the gauge fields are gapped, while the confined phase is\ntopologically trivial. In this paper, we point out a new route to constructing\nexotic 3D gapped fermionic phases in a confining phase of a gauge theory.\nStarting from a parton construction with strongly fluctuating compact\n$U(1)\\times U(1)$ gauge fields, we construct gapped phases of interacting\nfermions by condensing two linearly independent bosonic composite particles\nconsisting of partons and $U(1)\\times U(1)$ magnetic monopoles.

We show that localization of large extended objects can be mapped\nto a lower-dimensional many-body localization problem. For example, motion of a\nstring involves propagation of point-like signals down its length to keep the\ndifferent segments in causal contact. For sufficiently strong disorder, all\nsuch internal modes will exhibit many-body localization, resulting in the\nlocalization of the entire string.

Understanding its electronic structure and related lattice properties\nis one of the central topics in condensed matter theory.

The\nmomentum-resolved spectral functions, total and $4f$ partial density of states,\noptical conductivities, self-energy functions, and atomic eigenstate histograms\nfor cerium's four allotropes under ambient pressure were calculated and\nanalyzed carefully. The calculated results demonstrate that the 4$f$ electrons\nin the $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, and $\\delta$ phases are all correlated with\nheavily remormalized electron masses.

In particular, we focus on the\nregularized and unregularized OTOCs, defined as $Tr[\\sqrt{\\rho} A(t)\n\\sqrt{\\rho} A^\\dagger(t)]$ and $Tr[\\rho A(t)A^\\dagger(t)]$ respectively (where\n$A(t)$ is the anti-commutator of fermion field operators and $\\rho$ is the\nthermal density matrix). The calculation of the rate of OTOCs' exponential\ngrowth is reminiscent to that of the dephasing rate in interacting metals, but\nhere it involves two replicas of the system (two \"worlds\"). The intra-world\ncontributions reproduce the dephasing (that would correspond to a decay of the\ncorrelator), while the inter-world terms provide a term of the opposite sign\nthat exceeds dephasing. Consequently, both regularized and unregularized OTOCs\ngrow exponentially in time, but surprisingly we find that the corresponding\nmany-body Lyapunov exponents are different.

By\ncontrast, for sufficiently strong coupling, corresponding to the black hole\nphase, level statistics are well described by random matrix theory. This\ntransition in level statistics coincides approximately with a previously\nreported Hawking-Page transition for weak coupling.

Likewise, this critical coupling also corresponds with the one at\nwhich the overlap between the ground state and the thermofield double state\n(TFD) is smallest. In the range of sizes we can reach by exact diagonalization,\nthe ground state is well approximated by the TFD state only in the strong\ncoupling limit.

In this region, the spectral\ndensity is separated into blobs centered around the eigenvalues of the spin\noperator.

Although the\nformal expansion is exact-assuming that the model under the study is\nperturbative-only if diagrams to all orders are included, it is shown that for\nlarge-on-site-Coulomb-repulsion-U systems weak-coupling expansions to a few\norders may already converge. We show that the screened interaction for the\nlarge-U system can be vanishingly small at a certain intermediate electron\nfilling; and it is found that our approximation for the imaginary part of the\none-particle self energy agrees well with the QMC results in the low energy\nscales at this particular filling. But, the usefulness of the approximation is\nhindered by the fact that it has the incorrect filling dependence when the\nfilling deviates from this value. We also calculate the exact QMC Fermi\nsurfaces for the two-dimensional (2-D) Hubbard model for several fillings. Our\nresults near half filling show extreme violation of the concepts of the band\ntheory; in fact, instead of growing, Fermi surface vanishes when doped toward\nthe half-filled Mott-Hubbard insulator. Sufficiently away from half filling,\nnoninteracting-like Fermi surfaces are recovered. These results combined with\nthe Luttinger theorem might show that diagrammatic expansions for the\nnearly-half-filled Hubbard model are unlikely to be possible; however, the\nnonperturbative part of the solution seems to be less important as the filling\ngradually moves away from one half. Results for the 2-D one-band Hubbard model\nfor several hole dopings are presented. Implications of this study for the\nhigh-temperature superconductors are also discussed. \n\n"}

Such behavior is of general form and takes place in\nboth three dimensional systems and two dimensional ones. We demonstrate that a\nsystem which has undergone FCQPT and lies close to the critical point $x_{FC}$\ncan be driven back into the normal Fermi liquid by applying a small magnetic\nfield $B$. As the field $B$ is reduced, the system is tuned back to the\ncritical point and the effective mass diverges as $M^*\\propto\n1/\\sqrt{B-B_{FC}}$ where $B_{FC}$ is the maximum field at which FCQPT takes\nplace.

We clarify that they offer\ncomplementary methods of treating the screening and should serve for different\npurposes. In the GW method, the renormalization of bare on-site Coulomb\ninteractions between 3d electrons occurs mainly through the screening by the\nsame 3d electrons, treated in the random phase approximation (RPA). The basic\ndifference of the constraint-LDA method is that it deals with the neutral\nprocesses, where the Coulomb interactions are additionally screened by the\n``excited'' electron, since it continues to stay in the system. This is the\nmain channel of screening by the itinerant ($4sp$) electrons, which is\nespecially strong in the case of transition metals and missing in the GW\napproach, although the details of this screening may be affected by additional\napproximations, which typically supplement these two methods. The major\ndrawback of the conventional constraint-LDA method is that it does not allow to\ntreat the energy-dependence of $U$. We propose a promising approximation based\non the combination of these two methods. First, we take into account the\nscreening of Coulomb interactions in the 3d-electron-line bands located near\nthe Fermi level by the states from the subspace being orthogonal to these\nbands, using the constraint-LDA methods.

The ground state is correctly\npredicted to be an A-type antiferromagnetic structure, and the calculated\nJahn-Teller distortion agrees also well with experiment. Concerning the orbital\nordering, we find that even for a highly ionic compound such as KCuF3, the\norbital-order parameter is significantly reduced with respect to its nominal\nvalue due to Cu(3d)--F(2p) hybridization.

However,\nphysics which emerges in the low-energy corner does not depend on the\ncomplicated details of the system and is relatively simple. It is determined by\nthe nodes in the fermionic spectrum, which are protected by topology in\nmomentum space (in some cases, in combination with the vacuum symmetry). Close\nto the nodes the behavior of the system becomes universal; and the universality\nclasses are determined by the toplogical invariants in momentum space.
