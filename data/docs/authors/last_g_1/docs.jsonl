The spatial aspect originates from\nthe random locations of the network nodes in the Euclidean plane. The time\naspect stems from the random transmission policy followed by each network node\nand from the time variations of the wireless channel characteristics. The\ncombination of these random space and time aspects leads to fluctuations of the\nSINR experienced by the wireless channels, which in turn determine the\nprogression of packets in space and time in such a network. This paper studies\noptimal paths in such wireless networks in terms of first passage percolation\non this random graph.

It is used widely in practice, for example, for power\nallocation to sub-carriers in multi-user OFDM systems such as WiMax. The\nclassic water-filling algorithm is deterministic and requires perfect knowledge\nof the channel gain to noise ratios. In this paper we consider how to do power\nallocation over stochastically time-varying (i.i.d.) channels with unknown gain\nto noise ratio distributions. We adopt an online learning framework based on\nstochastic multi-armed bandits. We consider two variations of the problem, one\nin which the goal is to find a power allocation to maximize $\\sum\\limits_i\n\\mathbb{E}[\\log(1 + SNR_i)]$, and another in which the goal is to find a power\nallocation to maximize $\\sum\\limits_i \\log(1 + \\mathbb{E}[SNR_i])$.

We show that CWF1 obtains a regret (defined as the cumulative gap\nover time between the sum-rate obtained by a distribution-aware genie and this\npolicy) that grows polynomially in the number of channels and logarithmically\nin time, implying that it asymptotically achieves the optimal time-averaged\nrate that can be obtained when the gain distributions are known. For the second\nproblem, we present an algorithm called CWF2, which is, to our knowledge, the\nfirst algorithm in the literature on stochastic multi-armed bandits to exploit\nnon-linear dependencies between the arms. We prove that the number of times\nCWF2 picks the incorrect power allocation is bounded by a function that is\npolynomial in the number of channels and logarithmic in time, implying that its\nfrequency of incorrect allocation tends to zero. \n\n"}

The proof is based on a coupling argument that traces\nthe space-time cones containing the infection clusters generated by single\ninfections and uses that the random walk eventually gets trapped inside the\nunion of these cones. For the case where the local drifts of the random walk\nare smaller than the speed at which infection clusters grow, the random walk\neventually gets trapped inside a single cone.

We start from a single-colony $C^\\Lambda$-process, which arises as the\ncontinuum-mass limit of a $\\Lambda$-Cannings individual-based population model,\nwhere $\\Lambda$ is a finite non-negative measure that describes the offspring\nmechanism. After that we introduce a system of hierarchically interacting\n$C^\\Lambda$-processes, where the interaction comes from migration and\nreshuffling-resampling based on measures $(\\Lambda_k)_{k}$ both acting in\n$k$-blocks of the hierarchical group. We refer to this system as the\n$C_N^{c,\\Lambda}$-process. The dual process of the $C_N^{c,\\Lambda}$-process is\na spatial coalescent with multi-level block coalescence.\n  For the above system we carry out a full renormalisation analysis in the\nhierarchical mean-field limit $N\\to\\infty$. Our main result is that, in the\nlimit as $N\\to\\infty$, on each scale $k\\in\\mathbb{N}_0$ the $k$-block averages\nof the $C_N^{c,\\Lambda}$-process converge to a random process that is a\nsuperposition of a $C^{\\Lambda_k}$-process and a Fleming-Viot process, the\nlatter with a volatility $d_k$ and with a drift of strength $c_k$ towards the\nlimiting $(k+1)$-block average. It turns out that $d_k$ is a function of $c_l$\nand $\\Lambda_l$ for all $0\\leq l<k$. Thus, it is through the volatility that\nthe renormalisation manifests itself.\n  We discuss the implications of the scaling of $d_k$ for the behaviour on\nlarge space-time scales of the $C_N^{c,\\Lambda}$-process.

It subdivides into\nessentially three parts.\n  In a first rather algebraic part, we construct a path model for geometric\ncrystals in the sense of Berenstein and Kazhdan, for complex semi-simple Lie\ngroups. We will mainly describe the algebraic structure, its natural morphisms\nand parameterizations. The theory of total positivity will play a particularly\nimportant role.\n  Then, we anticipate on the probabilistic part by exhibiting a canonical\nmeasure on geometric crystals. It uses as ingredients the superpotential for\nthe flag manifold and a measure invariant under the crystal actions. The image\nmeasure under the weight map plays the role of Duistermaat-Heckman measure. Its\nLaplace transform defines Whittaker functions, providing an interesting formula\nfor all Lie groups. Then it appears clearly that Whittaker functions are to\ngeometric crystals, what characters are to combinatorial crystals. The\nLittlewood-Richardson rule is also exposed.\n  Finally we present the probabilistic approach that allows to find the\ncanonical measure. It is based on the fundamental idea that the Wiener measure\nwill induce the adequate measure on the algebraic structures through the path\nmodel.\n  In the last chapter, we show how our geometric model degenerates to the\ncontinuous classical Littelmann path model and thus recover known results. For\nexample, the canonical measure on a geometric crystal of highest weight\ndegenerates into a uniform measure on a polytope, and recovers the\nparameterizations of continuous crystals. \n\n"}

The problem of finding\nnon-block-factor finitely dependent processes dates back to 1965. The first\npublished example appeared in 1993, and we provide arguably the first natural\nexamples. More precisely, Schramm proved in 2008 that no stationary 1-dependent\n3-coloring of the integers exists, and conjectured that no stationary\nk-dependent q-coloring exists for any k and q. We disprove this by constructing\na 1-dependent 4-coloring and a 2-dependent 3-coloring, thus resolving the\nquestion for all k and q.\n  Our construction is canonical and natural, yet very different from all\nprevious schemes.

This \"Lagrangian fluctuation-dissipation relation\"\nequates the scalar dissipation for either passive or active scalars to the\nvariance of scalar inputs associated to initial scalar values and internal\nscalar sources, as those are sampled backward in time by the stochastic\nLagrangian trajectories. As an important application, we reconsider the\nphenomenon of \"Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity\" or persistent\nnon-determinism of Lagrangian particle trajectories in the limit of vanishing\nviscosity and diffusivity. Previous work on the Kraichnan (1968) model of\nturbulent scalar advection has shown that anomalous scalar dissipation is\nassociated in that model to Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity. There has\nbeen controversy, however, regarding the validity of this mechanism for scalars\nadvected by an actual turbulent flow. We here completely resolve this\ncontroversy by exploiting the fluctuation-dissipation relation. For either a\npassive or active scalar advected by any divergence-free velocity field,\nincluding solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, and away from\nwalls, we prove that anomalous scalar dissipation requires Lagrangian\nspontaneous stochasticity. For passive scalars we prove furthermore that\nspontaneous stochasticity yields anomalous dissipation for suitable initial\nscalar distributions, so that the two phenomena are there completely\nequivalent. These points are illustrated by numerical results from a database\nof homogeneous, isotropic turbulence, which provide both additional support to\nthe results and physical insight into the representation of diffusive effects\nby stochastic Lagrangian particle trajectories. \n\n"}

It is well-known that if the parties have predetermined roles, then the\nstrategy where one of them waits at one vertex, while the other visits all $n$\nvertices in random order is optimal, taking at most $n$ steps and averaging\nabout $n/2$. Anderson and Weber considered the symmetric rendezvous problem,\nwhere both parties must use the same randomized strategy. They analyzed\nstrategies where the parties repeatedly play the optimal asymmetric strategy,\ndetermining their role independently each time by a biased coin-flip. By tuning\nthe bias, Anderson and Weber achieved an expected meeting time of about $0.829\nn$, which they conjectured to be asymptotically optimal.\n  We change perspective slightly: instead of minimizing the expected meeting\ntime, we seek to maximize the probability of meeting within a specified time\n$T$. The Anderson-Weber strategy, which fails with constant probability when\n$T= \\Theta(n)$, is not asymptotically optimal for large $T$ in this setting.\nSpecifically, we exhibit a symmetric strategy that succeeds with probability\n$1-o(1)$ in $T=4n$ steps. This is tight: for any $\\alpha < 4$, any symmetric\nstrategy with $T = \\alpha n$ fails with constant probability. Our strategy uses\na new combinatorial object that we dub a \"rendezvous code,\" which may be of\nindependent interest.\n  When $T \\le n$, we show that the probability of meeting within $T$ steps is\nindeed asymptotically maximized by the Anderson-Weber strategy.

Inspired by a recent\nwork of Mukherjee and Varadhan on large deviations of the occupation measure of\nBrownian motion, we define a suitable topology on the space of partitioned\nsubprobability measures and prove that this topology is compact. Then using a\nvariant of the cavity method from the theory of spin glasses, we show that any\nlimit law of a sequence of endpoint distributions must satisfy a fixed point\nequation on this abstract space, and that the limiting free energy of the model\ncan be expressed as the solution of a variational problem over the set of fixed\npoints. As a first application of the theory, we prove that in an environment\nwith finite exponential moment, the endpoint distribution is asymptotically\npurely atomic if and only if the system is in the low temperature phase. The\nanalogous result for a heavy-tailed environment was proved by Vargas in 2007.\nAs a second application, we prove a subsequential version of the longstanding\nconjecture that in the low temperature phase, the endpoint distribution is\nasymptotically localized in a region of stochastically bounded diameter. All\nour results hold in arbitrary dimensions, and make no use of integrability. \n\n"}

In this paper we consider an\napproach to species tree reconstruction that addresses both these hurdles.\nSpecifically, we propose an algorithm for phylogeny reconstruction under the\nmultispecies coalescent model with a standard model of site substitution. The\nmultispecies coalescent is commonly used to model gene tree discordance due to\nincomplete lineage sorting, a well-studied population-genetic effect.\n  In previous work, an information-theoretic trade-off was derived in this\ncontext between the number of loci, $m$, needed for an accurate reconstruction\nand the length of the locus sequences, $k$. It was shown that to reconstruct an\ninternal branch of length $f$, one needs $m$ to be of the order of $1/[f^{2}\n\\sqrt{k}]$. That previous result was obtained under the molecular clock\nassumption, i.e., under the assumption that mutation rates (as well as\npopulation sizes) are constant across the species phylogeny.\n  Here we generalize this result beyond the restrictive molecular clock\nassumption, and obtain a new reconstruction algorithm that has the same data\nrequirement (up to log factors).

This phenomenon has received considerable attention in recent years,\ndue to its appearance in random matrix theory, the theory of Coulomb gases and\nzeros of random analytic functions. However, most of the published results are\nin dimensions one and two. This paper gives the first proof of hyperuniformity\nin a Coulomb type system in dimension three, known as the hierarchical Coulomb\ngas. This is a simplified version of the actual 3D Coulomb gas. The interaction\npotential in this model, inspired by Dyson's hierarchical model of the Ising\nferromagnet, has a hierarchical structure and is locally an approximation of\nthe Coulomb potential. Hyperuniformity is proved at both macroscopic and\nmicroscopic scales, with upper and lower bounds for the order of fluctuations\nthat match up to logarithmic factors. The fluctuations have cube-root behavior,\nin agreement with a well-known prediction for the 3D Coulomb gas. For\ncompleteness, analogous results are also proved for the 2D hierarchical Coulomb\ngas and the 1D hierarchical log gas. \n\n"}

The FPF is a controlled interacting\nparticle system where the control law is designed to solve the nonlinear\nfiltering problem. For the linear Gaussian case, certain simplifications arise\nwhereby the linear FPF reduces to one form of the ensemble Kalman filter. For\nthis and for the more general nonlinear non-Gaussian case, it has been an open\nproblem to relate the convergence and error properties of the finite-N\nalgorithm to the mean-field limit (where the exactness results have been\nobtained). In this paper, the equations for empirical mean and covariance are\nderived for the finite-N linear FPF. Remarkably, for a certain deterministic\nform of FPF, the equations for mean and variance are identical to the Kalman\nfilter. This allows strong conclusions on convergence and error properties\nbased on the classical filter stability theory for the Kalman filter.

We call such overlaps\nmulti-samplable. The correction to the Hamiltonian in the TAP representation\narises in our analysis as the free energy of a certain model on an overlap\ndependent band. For the largest multi-samplable overlap it coincides with the\nOnsager reaction term from physics. For smaller multi-samplable overlaps the\nformula we obtain is new. We also derive the corresponding TAP equation for\ncritical points. We prove all the above without appealing to the celebrated\nParisi formula or the ultrametricity property.\n  We prove that any overlap value in the support of the Parisi measure is\nmulti-samplable. For generic models, we further show that the set of\nmulti-samplable overlaps coincides with a certain set that arises in the\ncharacterization for the Parisi measure by Talagrand. The ultrametric tree of\npure states can be embedded in the interior of the sphere in a natural way. For\nthis embedding, we show that the points on the tree uniformly maximize the free\nenergies we define. From this we conclude that the Hamiltonian at each point on\nthe tree is approximately maximal over the sphere of same radius, and that\npoints on the tree approximately solve the TAP equations for critical points. \n\n"}

Non-asymptotic analysis in the $L^2$ Wasserstein distance\nof sampling algorithms based on Euler discretisations of SDEs has been recently\ndeveloped by several authors for log-concave probability distributions. In this\nwork we replace the log-concavity assumption with a log-concavity at infinity\ncondition. We provide novel $L^2$ convergence rates for Euler schemes,\nexpressed explicitly in terms of problem parameters. From there we derive\nnon-asymptotic bounds on the distance between the laws induced by Euler schemes\nand the invariant laws of SDEs, both for schemes with standard and with\nrandomised (inaccurate) drifts. We also obtain bounds for the hierarchy of\ndiscretisation, which enables us to deploy a multi-level Monte Carlo estimator.\nOur proof relies on a novel construction of a coupling for the Markov chains\nthat can be used to control both the $L^1$ and $L^2$ Wasserstein distances\nsimultaneously. Finally, we provide a weak convergence analysis that covers\nboth the standard and the randomised (inaccurate) drift case.

One prevalent example of this is sampling posteriors in\nparametric distributions, such as latent-variable generative models. However\nsampling (even very approximately) can be #P-hard.\n  Classical results going back to Bakry and \\'Emery (1985) on sampling focus on\nlog-concave distributions, and show a natural Markov chain called Langevin\ndiffusion mixes in polynomial time. However, all log-concave distributions are\nuni-modal, while in practice it is very common for the distribution of interest\nto have multiple modes. In this case, Langevin diffusion suffers from torpid\nmixing.\n  We address this problem by combining Langevin diffusion with simulated\ntempering. The result is a Markov chain that mixes more rapidly by\ntransitioning between different temperatures of the distribution. We analyze\nthis Markov chain for a mixture of (strongly) log-concave distributions of the\nsame shape. In particular, our technique applies to the canonical multi-modal\ndistribution: a mixture of gaussians (of equal variance).

Instead, empirical\nstudies rely on traceroutes to build what are essentially single-source,\nall-destinations, shortest-path trees. These trees only sample a fraction of\nthe network's edges, and a recent paper by Lakhina et al. found empirically\nthat the resuting sample is intrinsically biased. For instance, the observed\ndegree distribution under traceroute sampling exhibits a power law even when\nthe underlying degree distribution is Poisson.\n  In this paper, we study the bias of traceroute sampling systematically, and,\nfor a very general class of underlying degree distributions, calculate the\nlikely observed distributions explicitly. To do this, we use a continuous-time\nrealization of the process of exposing the BFS tree of a random graph with a\ngiven degree distribution, calculate the expected degree distribution of the\ntree, and show that it is sharply concentrated. As example applications of our\nmachinery, we show how traceroute sampling finds power-law degree distributions\nin both delta-regular and Poisson-distributed random graphs.

It is partially\nasymmetric in the sense that the probability of hopping left is q times the\nprobability of hopping right. Additionally, particles may enter from the left\nwith probability alpha and exit from the right with probability beta.\n  It has been observed that the (unique) stationary distribution of the PASEP\nhas remarkable connections to combinatorics -- see for example the papers of\nDerrida, Duchi and Schaeffer, and Corteel. Most recently we proved that in fact\nthe (normalized) probability of being in a particular state of the PASEP can be\nviewed as a certain weight generating function for permutation tableaux of a\nfixed shape.

However,\nour proof relied on the matrix ansatz of Derrida et al, and hence did not give\nan intuitive explanation of why one should expect the steady state distribution\nof the PASEP to involve such nice combinatorics.\n  In this paper we define a Markov chain -- which we call the PT chain -- on\nthe set of permutation tableaux which projects to the PASEP in a very strong\nsense.
