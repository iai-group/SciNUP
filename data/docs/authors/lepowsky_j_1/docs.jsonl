It is shown that as a consequence of these\naxioms, the N=2 vertex superalgebra is naturally a representation of the Lie\nalgebra isomorphic to the three-dimensional algebra of superderivations with\nbasis consisting of the usual conformal operator and the two N=2 superconformal\noperators. The notion of N=2 Neveu-Schwarz vertex operator superalgebra with\ntwo odd formal variables is introduced, and consequences of this notion are\nderived. Various other formulations of the notion of N=2 (Neveu-Schwarz) vertex\n(operator) superalgebra appearing in the mathematics and physics literature are\ndiscussed, and several mistakes in the literature are noted and corrected. The\nnotion of ``N=2 (Neveu-Schwarz) vertex (operator) superalgebra with one odd\nformal variable\" is formulated. It is shown that this formulation naturally\narises from alternate notions of N=1 superconformality and the continuous\ndeformation of an N=1 (Neveu-Schwarz) vertex (operator) superalgebra with one\nodd formal variable.

More precisely, starting from explicit formulae for characters of\nmodules over the singlet vertex operator algebra, which can be expressed in\nterms of false theta functions and their derivatives, we first deform these\ncharacters by using a complex parameter {\\epsilon}. We then apply modular\ntrans- formation properties of regularised partial theta functions to study\nasymptotic behaviour of regularised characters of irreducible modules and\ncompute their regularised quantum dimensions.

{"id": "cond-mat/0701259", "contents": "Title: Enlarged symmetry algebras of spin chains, loop models, and S-matrices Abstract: The symmetry algebras of certain families of quantum spin chains are\nconsidered in detail. The simplest examples possess m states per site (m\\geq2),\nwith nearest-neighbor interactions with U(m) symmetry, under which the sites\ntransform alternately along the chain in the fundamental m and its conjugate\nrepresentation \\bar{m}. We find that these spin chains, even with {\\em\narbitrary} coefficients of these interactions, have a symmetry algebra A_m much\nlarger than U(m), which implies that the energy eigenstates fall into sectors\nthat for open chains (i.e., free boundary conditions) can be labeled by j=0, 1,\n>..., L, for the 2L-site chain, such that the degeneracies of all eigenvalues\nin the jth sector are generically the same and increase rapidly with j. For\nlarge j, these degeneracies are much larger than those that would be expected\nfrom the U(m) symmetry alone. The enlarged symmetry algebra A_m(2L) consists of\noperators that commute in this space of states with the Temperley-Lieb algebra\nthat is generated by the set of nearest-neighbor interaction terms; A_m(2L) is\nnot a Yangian. There are similar results for supersymmetric chains with\ngl(m+n|n) symmetry of nearest-neighbor interactions, and a richer\nrepresentation structure for closed chains (i.e., periodic boundary\nconditions). The symmetries also apply to the loop models that can be obtained\nfrom the spin chains in a spacetime or transfer matrix picture. In the loop\nlanguage, the symmetries arise because the loops cannot cross. We further\ndefine tensor products of representations (for the open chains) by joining\nchains end to end. The fusion rules for decomposing the tensor product of\nrepresentations labeled j_1 and j_2 take the same form as the Clebsch-Gordan\nseries for SU(2). This and other structures turn the symmetry algebra \\cA_m\ninto a ribbon Hopf algebra, and we show that this is ``Morita equivalent'' to\nthe quantum group U_q(sl_2) for m=q+q^{-1}.

The following two steps each involve a\nnew, highly non-trivial, construction. The first construction, essentially\ncombinatorial, defines a differential graded Lie algebra structure on the\nsimplicial chain complex of the associahedra. The second construction, of a\nmore algebraic nature, is the definition of map of differential graded Lie\nalgebras from the complex defined above to the algebra of derivations on the\nbar resolution. Using the existence of this map and the acyclicity of the\nassociahedra we can define a so-called homotopy comodule structure on the bar\nresolution of a general Drinfeld algebra. This in turn allows us to define the\ndesired cohomology theory in terms of a complex which consists, roughly\nspeaking, of the bimodule and bicomodule maps from the bar resolution to the\nmodified cobar resolution.

We apply this method to equations\nfor N-particle states corresponding to the N-th tensor power of an abstract\nHamiltonian algebra of observables. In particular, we show for the case of\nmultiparticle Schr\\\"{o}dinger-like equations that the property of N-particle\nwave function to be approximately equal at large N to the product of\none-particle wave functions does not conserve under time evolution, while the\nsame property for the correlation functions of the finite order is known to\nconserve(such hypothesis being the quantum analog of the chaos conservation\nhypothesis put forward by M.Kac in 1956 was proved by the analysis of the\nBBGKY-like hierarchy of equations). In order to find a leading asymptotics for\nthe N-particle wave function, one should use not only the solution to the well-\nknown Hartree equation being derivable from the BBGKY approach but also the\nsolution to another (Riccati-type) equation presented in this paper. We also\nconsider another interesting case when one adds to the N-particle system under\nconsideration one more particle interacting with the system with the\ncoefficient of the interaction potential of order O(1).It happens that in this\ncase one should investigate not a single Hartree-like equation but a set of\nsuch equations, and the chaos will not conserve even for the correlators. \n\n"}

It is\nformed by a particular superposition of canonical coherent states. In the\nsimplest case, these superpositions are eigenfunctions of the annihilation\noperator $A=P(d/dx+x)/\\sqrt2$, where $P$ is the parity operator. Such $A$\narises naturally in the $q\\to -1$ limit for a symmetry operator of a specific\nself-similar potential obeying the $q$-Weyl algebra, $AA^\\dagger-q^2A^\\dagger\nA=1$. Coherent states for this and other reflectionless potentials whose\ndiscrete spectra consist of $N$ geometric series are analyzed. In the harmonic\noscillator limit the surviving part of these states takes the form of\northonormal superpositions of $N$ canonical coherent states\n$|\\epsilon^k\\alpha\\rangle$, $k=0, 1, \\dots, N-1$, where $\\epsilon$ is a\nprimitive $N$th root of unity, $\\epsilon^N=1$. A class of $q$-coherent states\nrelated to the bilateral $q$-hypergeometric series and Ramanujan type integrals\nis described. It includes a curious set of coherent states of the free\nnonrelativistic particle which is interpreted as a $q$-algebraic system without\ndiscrete spectrum. A special degenerate form of the symmetry algebras of\nself-similar potentials is found to provide a natural $q$-analog of the Floquet\ntheory. Some properties of the factorization method, which is used throughout\nthe paper, are discussed from the differential Galois theory point of view. \n\n"}

A general machinary is illustrated in a\ntypical isomonodromic problem, namely the Schlesinger equation, which is\nreformulated to include a small parameter $\\epsilon$. In the small-$\\epsilon$\nlimit, solutions of this isomonodromic problem are expected to behave as a\nslowly modulated finite-gap solution of an isospectral problem. The modulation\nis caused by slow deformations of the spectral curve of the finite-gap\nsolution. A modulation equation of this slow dynamics is derived by a heuristic\nmethod. An inverse period map of Seiberg-Witten type turns out to give general\nsolutions of this modulation equation. This construction of general solution\nalso reveals the existence of deformations of Seiberg-Witten type on the same\nmoduli space of spectral curves. A prepotential is also constructed in the same\nway as the prepotential of the Seiberg-Witten theory. \n\n"}
