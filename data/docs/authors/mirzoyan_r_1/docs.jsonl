We find that Advanced LIGO and EGO could detect\nintermediate-mass black holes of mass up to about 1000 solar masses out to a\nluminosity distance of a few Gpc. For typical multipolar energy distributions,\nwe show that the single-mode ringdown templates presently used for ringdown\nsearches in the LIGO data stream can produce a significant event loss (> 10%\nfor all detectors in a large interval of black hole masses) and very large\nparameter estimation errors on the black hole's mass and spin.

These external radiation fields control the amount\nof the inverse Compton radiation with respect to the synchrotron flux.\nTherefore the predicted spectral energy distribution (SED) will depend on where\nthe jet dissipates part of its energy to produce the observed radiation.

We investigate whether or not\nthese stars could have been as important in death as sources of energetic X-ray\nphotons as they were during their main sequence lives. Most massive stars are\nexpected to form in binaries, and an appreciable fraction of these (as much as\n~30%) will evolve into X-ray luminous (L_X~10^38 erg/s) high-mass X-ray\nbinaries (HMXBs). These sources would have made a contribution to the X-ray\nbackground at z>~6. Using Monte Carlo models of a globular cluster, we estimate\nthe total X-ray luminosity of a population of HMXBs. We compare and contrast\nthis with the total UV luminosity of the massive stars during their main\nsequence lives.

Abstract: We have observed the hard X-ray selected Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy SWIFT\nJ2127.4+5654 with Suzaku. We report the detection of a broad relativistic iron\nemission line from the inner accretion disc. By assuming that the inner edge of\nthe accretion disc corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit of the\nblack hole spacetime, the line profile enables us to measure a black hole spin\na= 0.6\\pm0.2. However, a non-rotating Schwarzschild spacetime is excluded at\njust above the 3 sigma level, while a maximally spinning Kerr black hole is\nexcluded at the ~5 sigma level. The intermediate spin we measure may indicate\nthat accretion-driven black hole growth in this source proceeds through\nshort-lived episodes with chaotic angular momentum alignment between the disc\nand the hole rather than via prolonged accretion. The measured steep emissivity\nindex (q~5) constrains the irradiating X-ray source to be very centrally\nconcentrated. Light bending may help focus the primary emission towards the\ninnermost accretion disc, thus steepening the irradiation profile. On the other\nhand, steep profiles can also be reached if magnetic extraction of the hole\nrotational energy is at work. If this is the case, the interplay between\naccretion (spinning up the black hole) and rotational energy extraction\n(spinning it down) forces the hole to reach an equilibrium spin value which,\nunder standard assumptions, is remarkably consistent with our measurement.\nRotational energy extraction would then be able to simultaneously account for\nthe intermediate spin and steep emissivity profile we infer from our spectral\nanalysis without the need to invoke chaotic accretion episodes.

At different scales\nalong the outflows, i.e. $\\sim 10-10^{10} R_{\\rm Sch}$ from the black hole, the\nlocal conditions can lead to the generation of non-thermal populations of\nparticles via, e.g., magnetic reconnection, magneto-centrifugal mechanisms,\ndiffusive processes, or the so-called converter mechanism. These non-thermal\npopulations of particles, interacting with dense matter, magnetic, and\nradiation fields, could yield radio-to-gamma-ray emission via synchrotron\nprocess, inverse Compton scattering, relativistic Bremsstrahlung, proton-proton\nand photo-hadron colissions, and even heavy nuclei photo-disintegration.

Analysis of the radii of curvature of electron trajectories in the\ninertial observer's frame (IOF) enables these two effects to be considered\ntogether. We demonstrate that for dipolar magnetic field lines on the TS there\nexists a `caustic phase' beyond which no emission can be observed. This phase\ncorresponds to the zero (or minimum) curvature of the IOF trajectories and\nmaximum bunching of the emission. The maximum gradient of polarisation angle\n(PA) in the S-shaped PA curve is also associated with the curvature minimum and\noccurs at exactly the same phase. The asymmetry of trajectory curvature with\nrespect to the dipole axis affects the curvature emissivity and the efficiency\nof pair production, suggesting a minimum at the caustic phase.

To this\nend, we present here the results of an observational campaign devoted to the\nstudy of the high-z GRB 090205. We carried out optical/NIR spectroscopy and\nimaging of GRB 090205 with the ESO-VLT starting from hours after the event up\nto several days later to detect the host galaxy. We compared the results\nobtained from our optical/NIR observations with the available Swift high-energy\ndata of this burst. Our observational campaign led to the detection of the\noptical afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 090205 and to the first measure of its\nredshift, z=4.65. Similar to other, recent high-z GRBs, GRB 090205 has a short\nduration in the rest-frame with T_{90,rf}=1.6 s, which suggests the possibility\nthat it might belong to the short GRBs class. The X-ray afterglow of GRB 090205\nshows a complex and interesting behaviour with a possible rebrightening at\n500-1000s from the trigger time and late flaring activity. Photometric\nobservations of the GRB 090205 host galaxy argue in favor of a starburst galaxy\nwith a stellar population younger than ~ 150 Myr. Moreover, the metallicity of\nZ > 0.27 Z_Sun derived from the GRB afterglow spectrum is among the highest\nderived from GRB afterglow measurement at high-z, suggesting that the burst\noccurred in a rather enriched envirorment.

We expect to be able to detect and analyze\nmany cycles of these slowly inspiraling systems. To that end, the use of very\nprecise theoretical waveform templates in the data analysis is required. To\nbuild them we need to have a deep understanding of the gravitational\nbackreaction mechanism responsible for the inspiral.

In this paper we extend a new time-domain\ntechnique for the computation of the self-force from the circular case to the\ncase of eccentric orbits around a non-rotating black hole.

It is\nfound that these theories can evade solar system tests of post-Newtonian\ngravity remarkably well.

The powerful imaging\ncapability of XMM-Newton was used to study the X-ray characteristics of the\nremnant at different energy ranges. The X-ray morphology and spectral\nproperties were analyzed.

We find a high column\ndensity of NH in the range 2.5-3.5x1022 cm-2, which supports a relatively\ndistant location (d $\\geq$ 9.7 kpc).

The most popular interpretation of the MSP is that\nthe smallest dark matter halos in the universe are extremely inefficient at\nforming stars. The question from that standpoint is to identify the feedback\nsource that makes small halos dark and to identify any obvious mass scale where\nthe truncation in the efficiency of galaxy formation occurs. Among the most\nexciting developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery\nof a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide\nfield, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite count\nin less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint galaxies that are\nless luminous that some star clusters. For the first time, there are empirical\nreasons to believe that there really are missing satellite galaxies in the\nLocal Group, lurking just beyond our ability to detect them, or simply\ninhabiting a region of the sky that has yet to have been surveyed.

Since it is impractical to apply second\nderivatives to observation data, we usually rely on spherical harmonic\ntransformation and inverse transformation, instead of using real-space\noperators.

We suggest that synchrotron\nemission of 10 - 100 TeV electrons and positrons (e+/-) can contribute to this\nemission, because starbursts have strong magnetic fields.

We compare these models to extant radio and\nGeV and TeV gamma-ray data for these starbursts, and calculate the diffuse\nsynchrotron X-ray and Inverse Compton (IC) luminosities of these starbursts. If\nthe primary electron spectrum extends to ~PeV energies and has a\nproton/electron injection ratio similar to the Galactic value, we find that\nsynchrotron contributes 2 - 20% of their unresolved, diffuse hard X-ray\nemission.

A\ngeneral problem is how to produce binaries with semi-major axes small enough to\nin significantly less than the Hubble time (t_H), and thus accommodate the\nobservation that these events closely follow episodes of star formation. I\nexplore the possibility that such systems are not binaries at all, but actually\ncoeval, or dynamical formed, triple systems. The tertiary induces Kozai\noscillations in the inner binary, driving it to high eccentricity, and reducing\nits gravitational wave (GW) merger timescale. This effect significantly\nincreases the allowed range of binary period P such that the merger time is\nt_merge < t_H. In principle, Chandrasekhar-mass binaries with P ~ 300 days can\nmerge in < t_H if they contain a prograde solar-mass tertiary at high enough\ninclination. For retrograde tertiaries, the maximum P such that t_merge < t_H\nis yet larger. In contrast, P < 0.3 days is required in the absence of a\ntertiary.

This so-called gamma-process requires sufficiently high\ntemperatures and occurs in pre-explosive or explosive O/Ne burning, depending\non the mass of the star. Although the gamma-process has been successful in\nproducing a large range of p-nuclei, two mass regions remain problematic, A<110\nand 150<A<165, where a number of p-nuclei are severely underproduced. The\norigin of the problems is yet to be identified. A large number of unstable\nnuclei with only theoretically predicted reaction rates are included in the\nreaction network and thus the nuclear input may involve uncertainties.\nDeficiencies in charged-particle optical potentials at gamma-process\ntemperatures have been found for nuclei at stability. On the other hand, the\ngamma-process conditions (temperature profiles, entropy of the O shell, seed\ncomposition) also sensitively depend on details of the stellar structure and\nevolution, as well as on the initial metallicity. Nevertheless, especially the\ndeficient low-mass p-nuclei may call for an additional production process or\nsite, such as production in (subChandrasekhar) type Ia supernovae.

In the\npresent work, we report new constraints on these issues, through the long term\nstudy of the radio and X-ray behaviour of the black hole candidate H1743-322.\nThis source is known to be one of the `outliers' of the universal radio/X-ray\ncorrelation, i.e. a group of accreting stellar-mass black holes displaying\nfainter radio emission for a given X-ray luminosity than expected from the\ncorrelation. Our study shows that the radio and X-ray emission of H1743-322 are\nstrongly correlated at high luminosity in the hard spectral state. However,\nthis correlation is unusually steep for a black hole X-ray binary: b ~ 1.4\n(with L_{Radio} \\propto L_{X}^{b}). Below a critical luminosity, the\ncorrelation becomes shallower until it rejoins the standard correlation with b\n~ 0.6. Based on these results, we first show that the steep correlation can be\nexplained if the inner accretion flow is radiatively efficient during the hard\nstate, in contrast to what is usually assumed for black hole X-ray binaries in\nthis spectral state. The transition between the steep and the standard\ncorrelation would therefore reflect a change from a radiatively efficient to a\nradiatively inefficient accretion flow.

We show that turbulent\nbraking in the Prandtl-Karman model with universally accepted coefficients for\nterrestrial conditions and laboratory experiments and a ladder of interacting\ngravity waves in a stratified quasi-exponential atmosphere at standard\nRichardson numbers lead to a spin-up of the massive zone that extends to the\nocean made up of a plasma with degenerate electrons. Turbulent braking in the\nocean at the boundary with the outer solid crust reduces the rotation velocity\nto the solid-body rotation velocity of the star. This situation should lead to\nstrong heating of deep atmospheric layers and to the switch-off of the\nexplosive helium burning mechanism.

Using\naxisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations with a self-consistent treatment of the\ndynamical cosmic ray (CR) - gas interaction, we show that the bubbles can be\ncreated with a recent active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet activity about 1 - 3\nMyr ago, which was active for a duration of ~ 0.1 - 0.5 Myr. The bipolar jets\nwere ejected into the Galactic halo along the rotation axis of the Galaxy. Near\nthe GC, the jets must be moderately light with a typical density contrast 0.001\n<~ \\eta <~ 0.1 relative to the ambient hot gas. The jets are energetically\ndominated by kinetic energy, and over-pressured with either CR or thermal\npressure which induces lateral jet expansion, creating fat CR bubbles as\nobserved. The sharp edges of the bubbles imply that CR diffusion across the\nbubble surface is strongly suppressed. The jet activity induces a strong shock,\nwhich heats and compresses the ambient gas in the Galactic halo, potentially\nexplaining the ROSAT X-ray shell features surrounding the bubbles.

Abstract: It is well-established observationally that the characteristic angular\nmomentum axis on small scales around AGN, traced by radio jets and the putative\ntorus, is not well-correlated with the large-scale angular momentum axis of the\nhost galaxy. In this paper, we show that such misalignments arise naturally in\nhigh-resolution simulations in which we follow angular momentum transport and\ninflows from galaxy to sub-pc scales near AGN, triggered either during galaxy\nmergers or by instabilities in isolated disks. Sudden misalignments can\nsometimes be caused by single massive clumps falling into the center slightly\noff-axis, but more generally, they arise even when the gas inflows are smooth\nand trace only global gravitational instabilities. When several nested,\nself-gravitating modes are present, the inner ones can precess and tumble in\nthe potential of the outer modes. Resonant angular momentum exchange can flip\nor re-align the spin of an inner mode on a short timescale, even without the\npresence of massive clumps. We therefore do not expect that AGN and their host\ngalaxies will be preferentially aligned, nor should the relative alignment be\nan indicator of the AGN fueling mechanism. We discuss implications of this\nconclusion for AGN feedback and BH spin evolution. The misalignments may mean\nthat even BHs accreting from smooth large-scale disks will not be spun up to\nmaximal rotation, and so have more modest radiative efficiencies and\ninefficient jet formation.

Within the framework of classical error models, the\ndependent variable relates to the independent variable according to the usual\nadditive model. The classes of linear models considered are regression lines in\nthe limit of uncorrelated errors in X and in Y. For homoscedastic data, the\nresults are taken from earlier attempts and rewritten using a more compact\nnotation.

We\nperform general relativistic simulations of binaries with a range of impact\nparameters, three different initial black hole spins (zero, aligned and\nanti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum), and neutron stars with three\ndifferent equations of state. We find a rich diversity across these parameters\nin the resulting gravitational wave signals and matter dynamics, which should\nalso be reflected in the consequent electromagnetic emission. Before tidal\ndisruption, the gravitational wave emission is significantly larger than\nperturbative predictions suggest for periapsis distances close to effective\ninnermost stable separations, exhibiting features reflecting the zoom-whirl\ndynamics of the orbit there. Guided by the simulations, we develop a simple\nmodel for the change in orbital parameters of the binary during close\nencounters. Depending upon the initial parameters of the system, we find that\nmass transfer during non-merging close encounters can range from essentially\nzero to a sizable fraction of the initial neutron star mass. The same holds for\nthe amount of material outside the black hole post-merger, and in some cases\nroughly half of this material is estimated to be unbound. We also see that\nnon-merging close encounters generically excite large oscillations in the\nneutron star that are qualitatively consistent with f-modes. \n\n"}

Modifications to this\ncorrelation function due to gravitational lensing by the large scale structure\n(LSS) surrounding us have been ignored in this context.

We vary four parameters: the gas polytropic\nindex Gamma, its temperature at large radii T_xi, the DM logarithmic slope at\nlarge radii zeta and its concentration c_vir. When comparing the model to the\nobserved mass-temperature (M-T) relation of local clusters, our results are\nindependent of both T_xi and c_vir. We thus obtain constraints on Gamma, by\nfixing the DM profile, and on zeta, by fixing the gas profile. For an NFW DM\nprofile, we find that 6/5<Gamma<13/10, which is consistent with numerical\nsimulations and observations of individual clusters. Taking 6/5<Gamma<13/10\nallows the DM profile to be slightly steeper than the NFW profile at large\nradii. Upon including local groups, we constrain the mass-dependence of Gamma\nand the value of T_xi. Interestingly, with Gamma=6/5 and zeta=-3, we reproduce\nthe observed steepening/breaking of the M-T relation at low M, if 10^6\nK<T_xi<10^7 K, consistent with simulations and observations of the warm-hot\nintergalactic medium. When extrapolated to high redshift z, the model with a\nconstant Gamma reproduces the expected self-similar behaviour. We also account\nfor the observed, non-self-similar relations provided by some high-z clusters,\nas they provide constraints on the evolution of Gamma. Comparing our model to\nthe observed luminosity-temperature relation, we discriminate between different\nM-c_vir relations: a weak dependence of c_vir on M is currently preferred by\ndata. This simple theoretical model accounts for much of the complexity of\nrecent, improved X-ray scaling relations, provided that we allow for a mild\ndependence of Gamma on M or for T_xi consistent with intercluster values.\n[abridged] \n\n"}

The entire sample consist of 161\nsources observed by XMM for more than 10 ks in pointed observations which is\nthe largest sample used so far to study AGN X-ray variability on time scales\nless than a day. We compute the excess variance for all AGN, on different\ntime-scales (10, 20, 40 and 80 ks) and in different energy bands (0.3-0.7,\n0.7-2 and 2-10 keV). We observe a highly significant and tight (~0.7 dex)\ncorrelation between excess variance and MBH. The subsample of reverberation\nmapped AGN shows an even smaller scatter (~0.45 dex) comparable to the one\ninduced by the MBH uncertainties. This implies that X-ray variability can be\nused as an accurate tool to measure MBH and this method is more accurate than\nthe ones based on single epoch optical spectra. The excess variance vs.\naccretion rate dependence is weaker than expected based on the PSD break\nfrequency scaling, suggesting that both the PSD high frequency break and the\nnormalisation depend on accretion rate in such a way that they almost\ncompletely counterbalance each other. A highly significant correlation between\nexcess variance and 2-10 keV spectral index is observed. Both the variability\nvs. LBol and FWHM_Hbeta correlations are consistent with being just by-products\nof the correlation with MBH. The soft and medium variability is very well\ncorrelated with the hard variability, suggesting that the additional soft\ncomponents (i.e. soft excess, warm absorber) add a minor contribution to the\ntotal variability. Once the variability is rescaled for MBH and mdot, no\nsignificant difference between narrow-line and broad-line Seyfert 1 is\nobserved.

Indeed, several black hole candidates deriving through\nmicrolensing observations have been reported in the literature.

The observed 0.5-2 keV band luminosity of\nthe diffuse X-ray emission within the D_25 ellipse is L_0.5-2keV = 2.7 x 10^39\nerg/s. The hot gas has a significantly broader distribution than the stellar\nlight, and shows strong hydrodynamic disturbances with a sharp surface\nbrightness edge to the northeast and a trailing tail. We identify the edge as a\ncold front and conclude that the distorted morphology of the hot gas is\nproduced by ram pressure as NGC4342 moves through external gas. From the\nthermal pressure ratios inside and outside the cold front, we estimate the\nvelocity of NGC4342 and find that it moves supersonically (M~2.6) towards the\nnortheast.

RX J0852.0-4622, also\nknown as Vela Junior, is one of the few (4) shell-type SNRs resolved at Very\nHigh Energies (VHE; E > 100 GeV). It is one of the largest known VHE sources (~\n1.0 deg radius) and its flux level is comparable to the flux level of the Crab\nNebula in the same energy band. These characteristics allow for a detailed\nanalysis, shedding further light on the high-energy processes taking place in\nthe remnant.

The reason is in the divergent\nnature of amplification factors near fold caustics increasingly sensitive to\nsmall spatial size details. Higher-order disc images produced by strong light\nbending around the black hole may affect the amplification curves, making a\ncontribution of up to several percent near maximum amplification. In accordance\nwith theoretical predictions, some of the observed high-amplification events\npossess fine structure. Here we consider three putative caustic crossing\nevents, one by SBS1520+530 and two events for individual images of the\nEinstein's cross (QSO J2237+0305). Using relativistic disc models allows to\nimprove the fits, but the required inclinations are high, about 70deg or\nlarger. Such high inclinations apparently contradict the absence of any strong\nabsorption that is likely to arise if a disc is observed edge-on through a dust\ntorus. Still, the high inclinations are required only for the central parts of\nthe disc, that allows the disc itself to be initially tilted by 60-90deg with\nrespect to the black hole and aligned toward the black hole equatorial plane\nnear the last stable orbit radius. For SBS1520+530, an alternative explanation\nfor the observed amplification curve is a superposition of two subsequent fold\ncaustic crossings. While relativistic disc models favour black hole masses\n~10^10 solar (several times higher than the virial estimates) or small\nEddington ratios, this model is consistent with the observed distribution of\ngalaxies over peculiar velocities only if the black hole mass is about 3 10^8\nsolar. \n\n"}

However, observations of well-studied young\nnebulae like the Crab Nebula, 3C 58, and G21.5--0.9 do not show the toroidal\nmagnetic field on a larger scale that might be expected in the MHD flow model;\nin addition, the radial variation of spectral index due to synchrotron losses\nis smoother than expected in the MHD flow model.

We obtain a \"phase diagram\" of the system as a function of binary\nparameters, showing regimes in which both the disk structure and migration have\na different character. Although massive binaries can create a central gap in\nthe disk at large radii, the tidal barrier of the secondary causes a\nsignificant pile-up of gas outside of its orbit, which can lead to the closing\nof the gap.

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM. The galaxies with more turbulent ISM, yet still\ncharacterised by very weak turbulence, can hold larger amounts of the ICM.\n[Abridged] \n\n"}

We find that the energy supply due to nuclear burning of\ninfalling material behind the shock can energize the shock expansion especially\nfor models that produce only marginal explosions in the absence of nuclear\nburning. These models are energized by nuclear energy deposition when the shock\nfront passes through the silicon-rich layer and/or later it touches the\noxygen-rich layer. Depending on the neutrino luminosity and its decay time, a\ndiagnostic energy of explosion increases up to a few times 10^50 erg for models\nwith nuclear burning compared to the corresponding models without. We point out\nthat these features are most remarkable for the Limongi-Chieffi progenitor in\nboth 1D and 2D, because the progenitor model possesses a massive oxygen layer\nwith its inner-edge radius being smallest among the employed progenitors, so\nthat the shock can touch the rich fuel on a shorter timescale after bounce. The\nenergy difference is generally smaller (~0.1-0.2 times 10^51 erg) in 2D than in\n1D (at most ~0.6 times 10^51 erg). This is because neutrino-driven convection\nand the shock instability in 2D models enhance the neutrino heating efficiency,\nwhich makes the contribution of nuclear burning relatively smaller compared to\n1D models.

Overall, we find that the outflows expel\nmetal-enriched gas away from galaxies, significantly quench star formation, and\nenrich the CGM.

For\nthe whole sample, I study the distributions of the peak flux, peak luminosity,\nduration, time asymmetry, average photon index and photon index scatter. I find\nthat: 1) flares produced by 3C 454.3 are longer and have more complex light\ncurves than those produced by other blazars; 2) flares shorter than 1.5 days in\nthe source frame tend to be time-asymmetric with the flux peak preceding the\nflare midpoint.

Using a new ray-tracing code for the\nKerr space-time, we find that the observed X-ray flux is strongly influenced by\nthe gravity field of the central black hole, even for observers at moderate\ninclination angles. We calculate inclination-dependent flux profiles of active\ngalactic nuclei in the optical and X-ray bands by combining the Kerr lensing\nand projection effects for future references.

Energetic\ncosmic neutrinos can interact inside the rock and produce leptons via a charged\ncurrent interaction. In the case of an incoming electron neutrino undergoing a\ncharged current interaction, the produced UHE electron will induce an\nunderground electromagnetic shower. At high energy (above 7.7 TeV in standard\nrock), such showers are subject to LPM (Landau, Pomeranchuk and Migdal)\nsuppression of the radiative processes cross sections (bremsstrahlung and pair\nproduction). The consequence of this suppression is that showers are elongated.\nThis effect will increase the detection probability of such events allowing\ndeeper showers to emerge with detectable energies. On the other hand, the\nphotonuclear processes which are usually neglected in electromagnetic showers\nwith respect to radiative processes, turn out to become dominant in the LPM\nregime and will reduce the shower length. In this work, we have performed a\ncomplete Monte Carlo study of an underground shower induced by UHE electrons by\ntaking into account both the LPM suppression and the photonuclear interaction.\nWe will discuss the effects of both of these processes on the shower length and\non the detectability of such events by ground arrays or fluorescence\ntelescopes.

This comes in addition to the unexpected proximity of the\nMagellanic Clouds (MCs) to the Milky Way (MW), and to another vast polar\nstructure (VPOS), which is almost perpendicular to our Galaxy disk. We find\nthat the VTDS plane is coinciding with several stellar, tidally-induced streams\nin the outskirts of M31, and, that its velocity distribution is consistent with\nthat of the Giant Stream (GS). This is suggestive of a common physical\nmechanism, likely linked to merger tidal interactions, knowing that a similar\nargument may apply to the VPOS at the MW location. Furthermore, the VTDS is\npointing towards the MW, being almost perpendicular to the MW disk, as the VPOS\nis.\n  We compare these properties to the modelling of M31 as an ancient, gas-rich\nmajor merger, which has been successfully used to predict the M31 substructures\nand the GS origin. We find that without fine tuning, the induced tidal tails\nare lying in the VTDS plane, providing a single and common origin for many\nstellar streams and for the vast stellar structures surrounding both the MW and\nM31. The model also reproduces quite accurately positions and velocities of the\nVTDS dSphs. Our conjecture leads to a novel interpretation of the Local Group\npast history, as a gigantic tidal tail due to the M31 ancient merger is\nexpected to send material towards the MW, including the MCs. Such a link\nbetween M31 and the MW is expected to be quite exceptional, though it may be in\nqualitative agreement with the reported rareness of MW-MCs systems in nearby\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

Several common\nradioisotopes in detector construction materials are found in long decay\nchains, notably those headed by 238U, 235U, and 232Th. Gamma radioassay using\nGe detectors identifies decay rates of a few of the radioisotopes in each\nchain, and typically assumes that the chain is in secular equilibrium. If the\nchains are out of equilibrium, detector background rates can be elevated\nsignificantly above expectation. In this work we quantify the increase in\nneutron and gamma production rates from an excess of various sub-chains of the\n238U decay chain. We find that the 226Ra sub-chain generates x10 higher neutron\nflux per decay than the 238U early sub-chain and 210Pb sub-chain, in materials\nwith high (alpha,n) neutron yields. Typical gamma screening results limit\npotential 238U early sub-chain activity to x20-60 higher than 226Ra sub-chain\nactivity. Monte Carlo simulation is used to quantify the contribution of the\nsub-chains of 238U to low-energy nuclear recoil (NR) and electron recoil (ER)\nbackgrounds in simplified one tonne liquid Ar and liquid Xe detectors. NR and\nER rates generated by 238U sub-chains in the Ar and Xe detectors are found\nafter comparable fiducial and multiple-scatter cuts. The Xe detector is found\nto have x12 higher signal-to-background for 100 GeV WIMPs over neutrons than\nthe Ar detector. ER backgrounds in both detectors are found to increase weakly\nfor excesses of 238U early sub-chain and 210Pb sub-chain relative to 226Ra\nsub-chain. Experiments in which backgrounds are NR-dominated are sensitive to\nundetected excesses of 238U early sub-chain and 210Pb sub-chain concentrations.\nExperiments with ER-dominated backgrounds are relatively insensitive to these\nexcesses. \n\n"}

PTF11qcj is also detected in X-rays with the Chandra\nobservatory, and in the infrared band with Spitzer. Our multi-wavelength\nanalysis probes the supernova interaction with circumstellar material.

Jet radio\nemission is expected from a sub-Eddington accreting IMBH in the low/hard (radio\nbright) state. In a search for such IMBH jet radio emission, we have observed\nwith the Very Large Array (VLA) at 5 GHz a sample of seven extreme ULXs whose\nX-ray properties indicate they are in the hard state. Assuming they remain in\nthis state, the non-detection of radio emission for six of the target sources\nallows us to constrain their black hole mass to the IMBH regime, thus ruling\nout a supermassive black hole nature. For the extreme ULX in the galaxy\nNGC\\,2276, we detect extended radio emission formed by two lobes of total flux\ndensity 1.43 $\\pm$ 0.22 mJy and size $\\sim$650 pc.

Two sources are confirmed to be\neclipsing: CX207 and CX794. CX207 shows a broad asymmetric Halpha profile\nblue-shifted by >300 km/s.

This could either be due to a true divergence in orbital\nperiod distributions of these two types of system, or to black hole LMXBs being\npreferentially hidden from view at short orbital periods. We explore the latter\npossibility, by investigating whether black hole LMXBs could be concealed by a\nswitch to radiatively inefficient accretion at low luminosities. The peak\nluminosity and the duration of X-ray binary outbursts are related to the disc\nradius and, hence, the orbital period. At short periods, where the peak\noutburst luminosity drops close to the threshold for radiatively inefficient\naccretion, black hole LMXBs have lower outburst luminosities, shorter outburst\ndurations and lower X-ray duty cycles than comparable neutron star systems.\nThese factors can combine to severely reduce the detection probability of short\nperiod black hole LMXBs relative to those containing neutron stars. We estimate\nthe outburst properties and orbital period distribution of black hole LMXBs\nusing two models of the transition to radiatively inefficient accretion: an\ninstantaneous drop in accretion efficiency (eta) to zero, at a fraction (f) of\nthe Eddington luminosity (L_Edd) and a power-law efficiency decrease, eta\n\\propto \\dot{M}^n, for L < f*L_Edd. We show that a population of black hole\nLMXBs at short orbital periods can only be hidden by a sharp drop in\nefficiency, either instantaneous or for n >= 3.

We assume\nthat the jets are intrinsically symmetrical, axisymmetric, decelerating,\nrelativistic outflows and we infer their inclination angles and the spatial\nvariations of their flow velocities, magnetic field structures and emissivities\nusing a common set of fitting functions. The inferred inclinations agree well\nwith independent indicators. The spreading rates increase rapidly, then\ndecrease, in a flaring region. The jets then recollimate to form conical outer\nregions at distance r0 from the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The flaring\nregions are homologous when scaled by r0. At ~0.1r0, the jets brighten abruptly\nat the onset of a high-emissivity region and we find an outflow speed of ~0.8c,\nwith a uniform transverse profile. Jet deceleration first becomes detectable at\n~0.2r0 and the outflow often becomes slower at its edges than it is on-axis.\nDeceleration continues until ~0.6r0, after which the outflow speed is usually\nconstant.

The only available\nanalytical MHD solutions to describe disc-driven jets are those characterized\nby the symmetry of radial self-similarity. However, radially self-similar MHD\njet models, in general, have three geometrical shortcomings, (i) a singularity\nat the jet axis, (ii) the necessary assumption of axisymmetry, and (iii) the\nnon-existence of an intrinsic radial scale, i.e. the jets formally extend to\nradial infinity. Hence, numerical simulations are necessary to extend the\nanalytical solutions towards the axis, by solving the full three-dimensional\nequations of MHD and impose a termination radius at finite radial distance. We\nfocus here on studying the effects of relaxing the (ii) assumption of\naxisymmetry, i.e. of performing full 3D numerical simulations of a disc-wind\ncrossing all magnetohydrodynamic critical surfaces. We compare the results of\nthese runs with previous axisymmetric 2.5D simulations. The structure of the\nflow in all simulations shows strong similarities. The 3D runs reach a steady\nstate and stay close to axisymmetry for most of the physical quantities, except\nfor the poloidal magnetic field and the toroidal velocity which slightly\ndeviate from axisymmetry.

With detailed calculations, we predict that the FRB\nsample size for producing one lensing event varies significantly for different\nFRB progenitor models. We argue that this fact can be used to distinguish\ndifferent FRB models and also discuss the practical possibility of using\nlensing observation in radio surveys to constrain FRB progenitors. \n\n"}

The most\ninteresting one is the so-called rho-state, whose light curve shows recurrent\nbursts. This paper presents a model based on Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations\ncontaining two variables: x, linked to the source photon luminosity L detected\nby the MECS, and y related to the mean photon energy. We aim at providing a\nsimple mathematical framework composed by non-linear differential equations\nuseful to predict the observed light curve and the energy lags for the\nrho-state and possibly other classes of the source. We studied the equilibrium\nstate and the stability conditions of this system that includes one external\nparameter, J, that can be considered a function of the disk accretion rate. Our\nwork is based on observations performed with the MECS on board BeppoSAX when\nthe source was in rho and nu mode, respectively. The evolution of the mean\ncount rate and photon energy were derived from a study of the trajectories in\nthe count rate - photon energy plane. Assuming J constant, we found a solution\nthat reproduces the x profile of the rho class bursts and, unexpectedly, we\nfound that y exhibited a time modulation similar to that of the mean energy.\nMoreover, assuming a slowly modulated J the solutions for x quite similar to\nthose observed in the nu class light curves is reproduced.

This finding makes\nstronger the heuristic meaning of the non-linear model and suggests a simple\nrelation between the variable x and y.

We show that these peculiar\nobservations can be explained independently of ongoing central engine activity\nif some sGRB progenitors are compact binaries hosting at least one pulsar. The\nPoynting flux emanating from the pulsar companion can excavate a bow-shock\ncavity surround- ing the binary.

It is also a tool to probe the\nstructure of the magnetic fields through which cosmic rays travel. As cosmic\nrays are mostly charged nuclei, their trajectories are deflected by the action\nof galactic magnetic field they propagate through before reaching the Earth\natmosphere, so that their detection carries directional information only up to\ndistances as large as their gyro-radius. If cosmic rays below\n$10^{15}{\\rm\\,eV}$ are considered and the local galactic magnetic field\n($\\sim3{\\rm\\,\\mu G}$) is accounted for, gyro-radii are so short that isotropy\nis expected. At most, a weak di-polar distribution may exist, reflecting the\ncontribution of the closest CR sources. However, a number of experiments\nobserved an energy-dependent \\emph{\"large scale\"} anisotropy in the sidereal\ntime frame with an amplitude of about 10$^{-4}$ - 10$^{-3}$, revealing the\nexistence of two distinct broad regions: an excess distributed around\n40$^{\\circ}$ to 90$^{\\circ}$ in Right Ascension (commonly referred to as\n\"tail.in\" excess) and a deficit (the \"loss cone\") around 150$^{\\circ}$ to\n240$^{\\circ}$ in Right Ascension.

However, various\nkinematic analyses can give different results and it is not obvious which are\nmost reliable. Using extensive sets of mock data of various sizes (mimicking\n'ultra-faint' and 'classical' dSphs) and an MCMC engine, here we investigate\nbiases, uncertainties, and limitations of analyses based on parametric\nsolutions to the spherical Jeans equation. For a variety of functional forms\nfor the tracer and DM density profiles, as well as the orbital anisotropy\nprofile, we examine reliability of estimates for the astrophysical J- and\nD-factors for annihilation and decay, respectively. For large (N > 1000)\nstellar-kinematic samples typical of 'classical' dSphs, errors tend to be\ndominated by systematics, which can be reduced through the use of sufficiently\ngeneral and flexible functional forms. For small (N < 100) samples typical of\n'ultrafaints', statistical uncertainties tend to dominate systematic errors and\nflexible models are less necessary. We define an optimal strategy that would\nmitigate sensitivity to priors and other aspects of analyses based on the\nspherical Jeans equation.

The origin of the broad\n  ionization distribution in AGN outflows Abstract: The winds of ionized gas driven by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can be\nstudied through absorption lines in their X-ray spectra. A recurring feature of\nthese outflows is their broad ionization distribution, including essentially\nall ionization levels (e.g., Fe^0+ to Fe^25+). This characteristic feature can\nbe quantified with the absorption measure distribution (AMD), defined as the\ndistribution of column density with ionization parameter |dN / dlog xi|.\nObserved AMDs extend over 0.1 < xi < 10^4 (cgs), and are remarkably similar in\ndifferent objects. Power-law fits (|dN /dlog xi| ~ N_1 xi^a) yield N_1 =\n3x10^{21} cm^-2 +- 0.4 dex and a = 0 -- 0.4. What is the source of this broad\nionization distribution, and what sets the small range of observed $N_1$ and\n$a$? A common interpretation is a multiphase outflow, with a wide range of gas\ndensities in a uniform gas pressure medium. However, the incident radiation\npressure leads to a gas pressure gradient in the photoionized gas, and\ntherefore to a broad range of ionization states within a single slab. We show\nthat this compression of the gas by the radiation pressure leads to an AMD with\n|dN / dlog xi| = 8x10^21 xi^0.03 cm^-2, remarkably similar to that observed.\nThe calculated values of $N_1$ and $a$ depend weakly on the gas metallicity,\nthe ionizing spectral slope, the distance from the nucleus, the ambient\ndensity, and the total absorber column. Thus, radiation pressure compression\n(RPC) of the photoionized gas provides a natural explanation for the observed\nAMD. RPC predicts that the gas pressure increases with decreasing ionization,\nwhich can be used to test the validity of RPC in ionized AGN outflows. \n\n"}

We invoke the quiescent disk solution of\nSunyaev and Shakura for the description of the disk in the propeller stage and\nfind the inner radius of the disk to be inside the light cylinder radius. We\nperform a high resolution X-ray analysis with XMM-Newton and find a narrow\nabsorption feature at 0.57 keV which can be interpreted as K$_{\\alpha}$ line of\nHe-like oxygen (OVII).

If the cloud level is high enough or the atmospheric transmission of\nthe cloud is high, then high energy showers (with TeV energies) can still\nproduce enough Cherenkov photons allowing detection by telescopes with large\nsizes and cameras with large field of view (FOV). In this paper we study the\npossibility of observations of showers, induced by high energy particles in the\natmosphere, in the presence of clouds which are completely or partially opaque\nfor Cherenkov radiation. We show how the image parameters of the Cherenkov\nlight distribution on the telescope camera are influenced for different opacity\nand altitude of the cloud. By applying the Monte Carlo simulations, we\ncalculate the scaled LENGTH and WIDTH parameters with the purpose to separate\ngamma-ray and proton initiated showers in real data. We show, that the high\nlevel of the night sky background effects the selection efficiency of the\ngamma-ray initiated showers. However, application of the higher image cleaning\nlevel significantly improves expected quality factors. The estimated gamma-ray\nselection efficiency for the detector with the camera FOV limited to 8 deg. is\nslightly better than for the camera with unlimited FOV, although the number of\nidentified gamma-ray events is lower. We conclude that large Cherenkov\ntelescopes with large FOV cameras can be used for observations of very high\nenergy gamma-rays in the presence of clouds.

Generally, the empirical Band\nfunction is fit to the observed gamma-ray data and the fit parameters are used\nto infer which radiative mechanisms are at work in GRB outflows. In particular,\nthe distribution of the Band function's low-energy power law index, $\\alpha$,\nhas led to the so-called synchrotron \"line-of-death\" (LOD) which is a statement\nthat the distribution cannot be explained by the simplest of synchrotron models\nalone. As an alternatively fitting model, a combination of a blackbody in\naddition to the Band function is used, which in many cases provide a better or\nequally good fit. It has been suggested that such fits would be able to\nalleviate the LOD problem for synchrotron emission in GRBs. However, these\nconclusions rely on the Band function's ability to fit a synchrotron spectrum\nwithin the observed energy band. In order to investigate if this is the case,\nwe simulate synchrotron and synchrotron+blackbody spectra and fold them through\nthe instrumental response of the $Fermi$ Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). We then\nperform a standard data analysis by fitting the simulated data with both Band\nand Band+blackbody models.

We model the day-scale\nSEDs with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models,\ninvestigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observed\nbroadband SED variability can be associated to variations in the relativistic\nparticle population.\n  Flux variability was remarkable in the X-ray and VHE bands while it was minor\nor not significant in the other bands. The one-zone SSC model can describe\nreasonably well the SED of each day for the 13 consecutive days. This flaring\nactivity is also very well described by a two-zone SSC model, where one zone is\nresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which is\nspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variable\nemission occurring in X-rays and VHE gamma-rays.\n  Both the one-zone SSC and the two-zone SSC models can describe the daily SEDs\nvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesis\nthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particle\npopulation. This shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanism\nproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for the\nbroadband SED variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. The two-zone\nSSC model provides a better agreement to the observed SED at the narrow peaks\nof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although the\nreported one-zone SSC model could be further improved by the variation of the\nparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\\delta$, $B$ and $R$), in\naddition to the parameters related to the particle population. \n\n"}

The progenitor is a nonrotating,\nzero-metallicity 9.6 Msun star with an iron core. While in spherical symmetry\noutward shock acceleration sets in later than 300 ms after bounce, a successful\nexplosion starts at ~130 ms postbounce in two dimensions (2D). The 3D model\nexplodes at about the same time but with faster shock expansion than in 2D and\na more quickly increasing and roughly 10 percent higher explosion energy of\n>10^50 erg. The more favorable explosion conditions in 3D are explained by\nlower temperatures and thus reduced neutrino emission in the cooling layer\nbelow the gain radius.

The main reason is that many of the NS in these systems appear to be\nspinning well below their Keplerian breakup frequency, and it has been\nsuggested that torques associated with GW emission may be setting the observed\nspin period. This assumption has been used extensively in the literature to\nassess the strength of the likely gravitational wave signal. There is now,\nhowever, a significant amount of theoretical and observation work that suggests\nthat this may not be the case, and that GW emission is unlikely to be setting\nthe spin equilibrium period in many systems. In this paper we take a different\nstarting point and predict the GW signal strength for two physical mechanisms\nthat are likely to be at work in LMXBs: crustal mountains due to thermal\nasymmetries and magnetically confined mountains.

Since redshifts are usually measured from the optical spectrum of the\nafterglow, correlations between prompt and afterglow emissions may introduce\nbiases in the distribution of rest-frame properties of the prompt emission,\nespecially considering that we measure the redshift of only one third of Swift\nGRBs.\n  In this paper we study the brightness of optical GRB afterglows and the role\nof optical selection effects in the distribution of various intrinsic\nproperties of GRBs and on the Epi - Eiso relation discovered by Amati et al.\n(2002). Our analysis is based on a sample of 85 GRBs with good optical\nfollow-up and well measured prompt emission. 71 of them have a measure of\nredshift and 14 have no redshift. We discuss the connection between the\nlocation of GRBs in the Epi-Eiso plane and their optical brightness measured\ntwo hours after the trigger in the GRB rest frame.

We demonstrate here that for some\nrealistic progenitors enshrouded in optically thick winds, such as possibly SN\n2008D, a CS forms deep inside the wind, soon after the RDS leaves the core, and\ntherefore significantly before SB. The RDS does not survive the transition from\nthe core to the thick wind when the wind close to the core is not sufficiently\ndense to compensate for the $r^{-2}$ dilution of photons due to shock\ncurvature.

We explore the non-thermal emission mechanism at these\ndynamically evolved SNRs by constructing a hydrodynamical model. Two scenarios\nof particle acceleration, either a re-acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays\n(CRs) or an efficient nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (NLDSA) of\nparticles injected from downstream, are considered. Using parameters inferred\nfrom observations, our models are contrasted with the observed spectra of SNR\nW44.

If sufficiently strong magnetic turbulence is present in the molecular\ncloud, the re-acceleration scenario can explain the observed broadband spectral\nproperties.

The resulting imaging reaches unprecedented coverage in IRAC 3.6{\\mu}m\nand 4.5{\\mu}m ranging from > 50 hour over 150 arcmin^2, > 100 hour over 60 sq\narcmin2, to 200 hour over 5 - 10 arcmin$^2$. This paper presents the survey\ndescription, data reduction, and public release of reduced mosaics on the same\nastrometric system as the CANDELS/GOODS-South WFC3 data. To facilitate\nprior-based WFC3+IRAC photometry, we introduce a new method to create high\nsignal-to-noise PSFs from the IRAC data and reconstruct the complex spatial\nvariation due to survey geometry. The PSF maps are included in the release, as\nare registered maps of subsets of the data to enable reliability and\nvariability studies. Simulations show that the noise in the ultradeep IRAC\nimages decreases approximately as the square root of integration time over the\nrange 20 - 200 hours, well below the classical confusion limit, reaching\n1{\\sigma} point source sensitivities as faint as of 15 nJy (28.5 AB) at\n3.6{\\mu}m and 18 nJy (28.3 AB) at 4.5{\\mu}m.

In the particular case of an initially\nstationary ($V_S=0,\\;a_S=0$) profile, the prospects for an explosion can be\nreasonably assessed by the initial signs of the partial derivatives of the\nshock acceleration, in analogy to a linear damped/anti-damped oscillator.

We investigated the temporal characteristics of X-ray\nemission during the early phases of the outburst.

The model takes into account (and is based\non) non-local energy and momentum transport across the shock front via emission\nand absorption of high-energy photons. This leads to a pre-acceleration of the\nfluid and pre-amplificaiton of the magnetic fields in the upstream region. Both\nhave drastic implications on the shock structure. The model explains the\npersistence of the shock generated magnetic field at large distances from the\nshock front.

Radiation constraints, which are relevant for high-energy neutrino\nproduction are considered as well. Efficient shock acceleration of cosmic rays\nis possible for sufficiently low-power jets and/or jets buried in a dense,\nextended wind or outer envelope.

A clumpy torus\nallows photons reflected from the back-side of the torus to leak through the\nfront free-of-obscuration regions. Therefore, the observed X-ray fluorescent\nlines are sensitive to the clumpiness of the torus. We analyse a sample of type\nII AGN observed with Chandra HETGS, and measure the fluxes for the Si Ka and Fe\nKa lines. The measured Fe Ka/Si Ka ratios, spanning a range between $5-60$, are\nfar smaller than the ratios predicted from simulations of smooth tori,\nindicating that the tori of the studied sources have clumpy distributions\nrather than smooth ones. Compared with simulation results of clumpy tori with a\nhalf-opening angle of 60$^{\\circ}$, the Circinus galaxy has a Fe Ka/Si Ka ratio\nof $\\sim60$, which is close to the simulation results for $N=5$, where $N$ is\nthe average number of clumps along the line of sight.

In one of the leading formation\nscenarios, a black hole of $\\sim100$ M$_{\\odot}$ results from the collapse of\nthe inner core of a supermassive star ($\\gtrsim 10^{4-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$), created\nby the rapid accumulation ($\\gtrsim 0.1 $ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) of pristine\ngas at the centre of newly formed galaxies at $z\\sim 15$. The subsequent\nevolution is still speculative: the remaining gas in the supermassive star can\neither directly plunge into the nascent black hole, or part of it can form a\ncentral accretion disc, whose luminosity sustains a surrounding, massive, and\nnearly hydrostatic envelope (a system called a \"quasi-star\"). To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon.

Flattening has two consequences: first, there\nis a geometric effect as the squeezing (or stretching) of the dark matter\ndistribution enhances (or diminishes) the J-factor; second, the line of sight\nvelocity dispersion of stars must hold up the flattened baryonic component in\nthe flattened dark matter halo. We provide analytic formulae and a simple\nnumerical approach to estimate the correction to the J- and D-factors required\nover simple spherical modeling.

We observe strong\ndepolarization effects that correlate with diffuse H$\\alpha$ emission, likely\ndue to spatially-varying Faraday rotation measure (RM) fluctuations of $\\ge48$\nto 61 rad m$^{-2}$ on scales $\\le4.5$ to 6 pc. We also report the discovery of\nnumerous, faint, H$\\alpha$ filaments that are unambiguously associated with the\ncentral region of W50. These thin filaments are suggestive of a SNR's shock\nemission, and almost all have a radio counterpart. Furthermore, an RM-gradient\nis detected across the central region of W50, which we interpret as a loop\nmagnetic field with a symmetry axis offset by $\\approx90^{\\circ}$ to the\neast-west jet-alignment axis, and implying that the evolutionary processes of\nboth the jets and the SNR must be coupled. A separate RM-gradient is associated\nwith the termination shock in the Eastern ear, which we interpret as a\nring-like field located where the shock of the jet interacts with the\ncircumstellar medium.

Previous studies revealed many, but not all\ninteresting properties of this event. Our goal was to add new understanding of\nboth the early and late-time phases of SN 2013df.

With this in mind, we\nemploy the publicly available Fermi data to study the gamma-ray emission from\n157 globular clusters, identifying a statistically significant signal from 25\nof these sources (ten of which are not found in existing gamma-ray catalogs).\nWe combine these observations with the predicted pulsar formation rate based on\nthe stellar encounter rate of each globular cluster to constrain the gamma-ray\nluminosity function of millisecond pulsars in the Milky Way's globular cluster\nsystem. We find that this pulsar population exhibits a luminosity function that\nis quite similar to those millisecond pulsars observed in the field of the\nMilky Way (i.e. the thick disk). After pulsars are expelled from a globular\ncluster, however, they continue to lose rotational kinetic energy and become\nless luminous, causing their luminosity function to depart from the\nsteady-state distribution.

Abstract: Successful phenomenological models of pulsar wind nebulae assume efficient\ndissipation of the Poynting flux of the magnetized electron-positron wind as\nwell as efficient acceleration of the pairs in the vicinity of the termination\nshock, but how this is realized is not yet well understood. The present paper\nsuggests that the corrugation of the termination shock, at the onset of\nnon-linearity, may lead towards the desired phenomenology. Non-linear\ncorrugation of the termination shock would convert a fraction of order unity of\nthe incoming ordered magnetic field into downstream turbulence, slowing down\nthe flow to sub-relativistic velocities. The dissipation of turbulence would\nfurther preheat the pair population on short length scales, close to\nequipartition with the magnetic field, thereby reducing the initial high\nmagnetization to values of order unity. Furthermore, it is speculated that the\nturbulence generated by the corrugation pattern may sustain a relativistic\nFermi process, accelerating particles close to the radiation reaction limit, as\nobserved in the Crab nebula. The required corrugation could be induced by the\nfast magnetosonic modes of downstream nebular turbulence; but it could also be\nproduced by upstream turbulence, either carried by the wind or seeded in the\nprecursor by the accelerated particles themselves. \n\n"}

In this\nwork, we trace DM capture and annihilation rates throughout the life of a\nmassive star and show that this evolution culminates in an intense annihilation\nburst coincident with the death of the star in a core collapse supernova. The\nreason is that, along with the stellar interior, also its DM core heats up and\ncontracts, so that the DM density increases rapidly during the final stages of\nstellar evolution. We argue that, counterintuitively, the annihilation burst is\nmore intense if DM annihilation is a $p$-wave process than for $s$-wave\nannihilation because in the former case, more DM particles survive until the\nsupernova. If among the DM annihilation products are particles like dark\nphotons that can escape the exploding star and decay to Standard Model\nparticles later, the annihilation burst results in a flash of gamma rays\naccompanying the supernova.

Such acceleration\ncan produce the non-thermal particles that emit the broadband continuum\nradiation that is detected from extragalactic jets. An important recent\ndevelopment for blazar science is the ability of Fermi-LAT spectroscopy to pin\ndown the shape of the distribution of the underlying non-thermal particle\npopulation. This paper highlights how multi-wavelength spectra spanning optical\nto X-ray to gamma-ray bands can be used to probe diffusive acceleration in\nrelativistic, oblique, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks in blazar jets.\nDiagnostics on the MHD turbulence near such shocks are obtained using thermal\nand non-thermal particle distributions resulting from detailed Monte Carlo\nsimulations of DSA. These probes are afforded by the characteristic property\nthat the synchrotron $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ peak energy does not appear in the gamma-ray\nband above 100 MeV. We investigate self-consistently the radiative synchrotron\nand inverse Compton signatures of the simulated particle distributions.\nImportant constraints on the diffusive mean free paths of electrons, and the\nlevel of electromagnetic field turbulence are identified for three different\ncase study blazars, Mrk 501, BL Lacertae and AO 0235+164.

Self-regulation cycle and\n  non-thermal emission Abstract: Self-regulated feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) appears to be\ncritical in balancing radiative cooling of the low-entropy gas at the centres\nof galaxy clusters and in regulating star formation in central galaxies. In a\ncompanion paper, we found steady-state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations\nthat are coupled to the CR energy equation for a large cluster sample. In those\nsolutions, radiative cooling in the central region is balanced by streaming CRs\nthrough the generation and dissipation of resonantly generated Alfv{\\'e}n waves\nand by thermal conduction at large radii. Here we demonstrate that the\npredicted non-thermal emission resulting from hadronic CR interactions in the\nintra-cluster medium exceeds observational radio (and gamma-ray) data in a\nsubsample of clusters that host radio mini halos (RMHs). In contrast, the\npredicted non-thermal emission is well below observational data in cooling\ngalaxy clusters without RMHs.

We start with a precursor theory that\ncontains three propagating gravitational degrees of freedom without a\nquasidilaton scalar and introduce St\\\"uckelberg fields to covariantize its\naction. This makes it possible for us to formulate the quasidilaton global\nsymmetry that mixes the St\\\"uckelberg fields and the quasidilaton scalar field.\nBy the Hamiltonian analysis we confirm that the precursor theory with the\nquasidilaton scalar contains four degrees of freedom, three from the precursor\nmassive gravity and one from the quasidilaton scalar.

These objects are a missing link in two ways: (1) for probing\nmoderately massive BHs and (2) for understanding the hydrodynamics of the\ndisruption of objects with tenuous envelopes. A flare arising from the tidal\ndisruption of a $0.17~M_\\odot$ white dwarf by a $10^5~M_\\odot$ BH reaches a\nmaximum between 0.6 and 11 days, with a peak fallback rate that is usually\nsuper-Eddington and results in a flare that is likely brighter than a typical\ntidal disruption event.

While most tidal disruption candidates observed thus far are\nconsistent with the disruptions of main sequence stars, the rapid timescales of\nnuclear transients such as Dougie and PTF10iya are naturally explained by the\ndisruption of low-mass white dwarfs.

We evaluate energy threshold, angular\nresolution and sensitivity of MAGIC under different background light levels,\nbased on Crab Nebula observations and tuned Monte Carlo simulations. This study\nincludes observations taken under non-standard hardware configurations, such as\nreducing the camera photomultiplier tubes gain by a factor ~1.7 (Reduced HV\nsettings) with respect to standard settings (Nominal HV) or using UV-pass\nfilters to strongly reduce the amount of moonlight reaching the cameras of the\ntelescopes.

First, applying Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques, we use the absence\nof dipolar radiation in the pulsar-timing observations of five binary systems\ncomposed of a NS and a white dwarf, and eleven equations of state (EOSs) for\nNSs, to derive the most stringent constraints on the two free parameters of the\nDEF scalar-tensor theory.

While general relativity predicts only two\ntensor gravitational-wave polarizations, general metric theories of gravity\nallow for up to four additional vector and scalar modes.

The LIGO-Virgo detection of the binary black hole merger GW170814\nhas recently offered the first direct constraints on the polarization of\ngravitational waves.

Previous\nwork on sub-mm and radio variability hints at a lag between X-ray flares and\ntheir candidate sub-millimeter or radio counterparts, with the long wavelength\ndata lagging the X-ray.

Gamma-ray fluxes have been predicted for both the\ncentral binary and the interaction regions between jets and surrounding nebula.\nAlso, non-thermal emission at lower energies has been previously reported. We\nexplore the capability of SS 433 to emit VHE gamma rays during periods in which\nthe expected flux attenuation due to periodic eclipses and precession of the\ncircumstellar disk periodically covering the central binary system is expected\nto be at its minimum. The eastern and western SS433/W50 interaction regions are\nalso examined. We aim to constrain some theoretical models previously developed\nfor this system. We made use of dedicated observations from MAGIC and H.E.S.S.\nfrom 2006 to 2011 which were combined for the first time and accounted for a\ntotal effective observation time of 16.5 h. Gamma-ray attenuation does not\naffect the jet/medium interaction regions. The analysis of a larger data set\namounting to 40-80 h, depending on the region, was employed. No evidence of VHE\ngamma-ray emission was found. Upper limits were computed for the combined data\nset. We place constraints on the particle acceleration fraction at the inner\njet regions and on the physics of the jet/medium interactions.

In this system,\nan inertia force due to the uniform acceleration acts as the restoring force\nfor the oscillation. We find that not only the difference in the inertia\nbetween the two fluids separated by the interface but also the pressure at the\ninterface helps to drive the RTI because of a difference in the Lorenz factor\nacross the discontinuous surface of the jet.

To determine the\nsignificance of a GW candidate, a ranking statistic is evaluated and compared\nto an empirically-estimated background distribution, yielding a false alarm\nprobability or p-value. The reliability of this background estimate is limited\nby the number of background samples and by the fact that GW detectors cannot be\nshielded from signals, making it impossible to identify a pure background data\nset. Different strategies have been proposed: in one method, all samples,\nincluding potential signals, are included in the background estimation, whereas\nin another method, coincidence removal is performed in order to exclude\npossible signals from the estimated background. Here we report on a mock data\nchallenge, performed prior to the first detections of GW signals by Advanced\nLIGO, to compare these two methods. The all-samples method is found to be\nself-consistent in terms of the rate of false positive detection claims, but\nits p-value estimates are systematically conservative and subject to higher\nvariance. Conversely, the coincidence-removal method yields a mean-unbiased\nestimate of the p-value but sacrifices self-consistency.

Building on previous work, we use\nsynthetic Hitomi/SXS observations of the hot plasma of a simulated cluster with\nsloshing gas motions and varying viscosity to analyze its velocity structure in\na similar fashion. We find that sloshing motions can produce line shifts and\nwidths similar to those measured by Hitomi. We find these measurements are\nunaffected by the value of the gas viscosity, since its effects are only\nmanifested clearly on angular scales smaller than the SXS $\\sim$1' PSF. The PSF\nbiases the line shift of regions near the core as much as $\\sim 40-50$ km\ns$^{-1}$, so it is crucial to model this effect carefully. We also infer that\nif sloshing motions dominate the observed velocity gradient, Perseus must be\nobserved from a line of sight which is somewhat inclined from the plane of\nthese motions, but one that still allows the spiral pattern to be visible.\nFinally, we find that assuming isotropy of motions can underestimate the total\nvelocity and kinetic energy of the core in our simulation by as much as\n$\\sim$60%.

We study for which sets of parameters the emission can\nfulfil the observational constraints. Even if the emission is coherent, we find\nthat self-absorption can limit the produced luminosities at low radio\nfrequencies and that an efficient re-acceleration process is needed to balance\nthe dramatic energy losses of the emitting particles. Self-absorption limits\nthe luminosities at low radio frequency, while coherence favours steep\noptically thin spectra. Furthermore, the magnetic geometry must have a high\ndegree of order to obtain coherent curvature emission.

Approximate universal relations insensitive to the star's\ninternal structure exist among certain observables and are useful in testing\nGeneral Relativity, as they project out the uncertainties in the equation of\nstate. One such set of universal relations between the moment of inertia $(I)$,\nthe tidal Love number and the quadrupole moment $(Q)$ has been studied both in\nGeneral Relativity and in modified theories. In this paper, we study the\nrelations in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a well-motivated, parity-violating\neffective field theory, extending previous work in various ways. First, we\nstudy how projected constraints on the theory using the I-Love relation depend\non the measurement accuracy of $I$ with radio observations and that of the Love\nnumber with gravitational-wave observations. Provided these quantities can be\nmeasured with future observations, we find that the latter could place bounds\non dynamical Chern-Simons gravity that are six orders of magnitude stronger\nthan current bounds. Second, we study the I-Q and Q-Love relations in this\ntheory by constructing slowly-rotating neutron star solutions to quadratic\norder in spin. We find that the approximate universality continues to hold in\ndynamical Chern-Simons gravity, and in fact, it becomes stronger than in\nGeneral Relativity, although its existence depends on the normalization of the\ndimensional coupling constant of the theory. Finally, we study the variation of\nthe eccentricity of isodensity contours inside a star and its relation to the\ndegree of universality. We find that, in most cases, the eccentricity variation\nis smaller in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity than in General Relativity,\nproviding further support to the idea that the approximate self-similarity of\nisodensity contours is responsible for universality. \n\n"}

The present\nwork aims to explore the adequacy of different gap-type (unscreened electric\nfield) models to account for the observed characteristics. Based on a\nphenomenological description of the gap potential, we estimate the maximum\nextractable gap power $L_{gap}$ for different magnetospheric set-ups, and study\nits dependence on the accretion state of the source. $L_{gap}$ is found to be\nin general proportional to the Blandford-Znajek jet power $L_{BZ}$ and a\nsensitive function of gap size $h$, i.e. $L_{gap} \\sim L_{BZ} (h/r_g)^{\\beta}$,\nwhere the power index $\\beta \\geq 1$ is dependent on the respective gap-setup.\nThe transparency of the black hole vicinity to VHE photons generally requires a\nradiatively inefficient accretion environment and thereby imposes constraints\non possible accretion rates, and correspondingly on $L_{BZ}$.

Combining these constraints, we provide a general classification to assess\nthe likelihood that the VHE gamma-ray emission observed from an AGN can be\nattributed to a magnetospheric origin.

Based on the\nobservations of SGRBs, we could derive the merger rates of these compact\nbinaries, and study the stochastic GW backgrounds (SGWBs) or the co-detection\nrates of GWs associate with SGRBs (GW-SGRBs). But before that, the most\nimportant thing is to derive the GW spectrum from a single GW source. Usually,\nGW spectrum from a circular orbit binary is assumed. However, observations of\nthe large spatial offsets of SGRBs from their host galaxies imply that SGRB\nprogenitors may be formed by the dynamical processes, and will merge with\nresidual eccentricities. The orbital eccentricity has important effect on GW\nspectra, and therefore on the SGWB and GW-SGRB co-detection rate. Our results\nshow that the power spectra of the SGWBs from eccentric compact binaries are\ngreatly suppressed at low frequencies. Especially, SGWBs from binaries with\nhigh residual eccentricities will hard to be detected (above the detection\nfrequency of $\\sim100~\\rm Hz$). For the co-detection rates of GW-SGRB events,\nthey could be $\\sim1.4$ times higher than the circular case within some\nparticular ranges of $e_{\\rm r}$ , but greatly reduced for high residual\neccentricities (e.g., $e_{\\rm r}>0.1$ for BNSs).

Although gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been promising\nsources of UHECRs, it is still unclear whether they can account for the Auger\nresults because of their unknown nuclear composition of ejected UHECRs. In this\nwork, we revisit the possibility that low-luminosity GRBs (LL GRBs) act as the\nsources of UHECR nuclei, and give new predictions based on the intrajet nuclear\ncomposition models considering progenitor dependencies. We find that the\nnuclear component in the jet can be divided into two groups according to the\nmass fraction of silicon nuclei, Si-free and Si-rich. Motivated by the\nconnection between LL GRBs and transrelativistic supernovae, we also consider\nthe hypernova ejecta composition. Then, we discuss the survivability of UHECR\nnuclei in the jet base and internal shocks of the jets, and show that it is\neasier for nuclei to survive for typical LL GRBs. Finally, we numerically\npropagate UHECR nuclei ejected from LL GRBs with different composition models\nand compare the resulting spectra and composition to Auger data. Our results\nshow that both the Si-rich progenitor and hypernova ejecta models match the\nAuger data well, while the Si-free progenitor models have more difficulty in\nfitting the spectrum.

Unfortunately, lightcurves'\nobservations take several years to be completed, producing truncated time\nseries that generally remain without the application of automatic classifiers\nuntil they are finished.

The main difficulty in PA\nexplanation relates to cosmic gamma-radiation which is inevitably produced in\nDM annihilation or decay leading to tension with respective observation data.\nIntroduction of \"active\" (producing CR) DM component concentrating in galactic\ndisk alleviates this tension. Earlier we considered two-lepton modes, with\nbranching ratios being chosen to fit in the best way all the observation data.\nHere we considered, in framework of the same dark disk model, two cases:\ntwo-body final state annihilation and four-body one, and in each case a quark\nmode is added to the leptonic ones. It is shown that 4-body mode case is a\nlittle better than 2-body one from viewpoint of quality of observation data\ndescription at the fixed all other parameters (of CR propagation, background,\ndisk height). The values of DM particle mass around 350 GeV and 500 GeV are\nmore favourable for 2- and 4-body modes respectively.

X-ray irradiation from the central source heats disc surface,\nforming a wind from the outer disc where the local escape velocity is lower\nthan the sound speed. The mass loss rate from each part of the disc is\ndetermined by the luminosity and spectral shape of the central source.

For each system in this sample, we measure dM/dt using archival\nChandra X-ray data and acquire the SFR and systematic uncertainty in the SFR by\ncombining over 330 estimates from dozens of literature sources.

For these systems, we measure a slope in the SFR-dM/dt relation\ngreater than unity, suggesting that the systems with the strongest cool cores\nare also cooling more efficiently. We propose that this may be related to, on\naverage, higher black hole accretion rates in the strongest cool cores, which\ncould influence the total amount (saturating near the Eddington rate) and\ndominant mode (mechanical vs radiative) of feedback.

We test this scenario on the Fermi gamma-ray spectra of 106\nbroad-line blazars detected with the highest significance or largest BLR, by\nlooking for cut-off signatures at high energies compatible with gamma-gamma\ninteractions with BLR photons. We do not find evidence for the expected BLR\nabsorption.

These flares also appear to originate on the heated side of the\ncompanion, while the \"night\"-side brightness remains relatively stable.\nSomewhat less active, PSR J1628$-$3205 has an optical light curve that is\ndominated by tidal distortion (ellipsoidal modulation), although it too shows\nevidence of variable and asymmetric heating due to shifting magnetic fields or\nmigrating star spots.

Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries may be detectable by an upcoming suite of\ngravitational wave experiments. Their binary nature can also be revealed by\nradio jets via a short-period precession driven by the orbital motion as well\nas the geodetic precession at typically longer periods. We have investigated\nKarl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and MERLIN radio maps of powerful jet\nsources for morphological evidence of geodetic precession. For perhaps the best\nstudied source, Cygnus A, we find strong evidence for geodetic precession.\nProjection effects can enhance precession features, for which we find\nindications in strongly projected sources. For a complete sample of 33 3CR\nradio sources we find strong evidence for jet precession in 24 cases (73 per\ncent). The morphology of the radio maps suggests that the precession periods\nare of the order of 10^6 - 10^7 yr. We consider different explanations for the\nmorphological features and conclude that geodetic precession is the best\nexplanation. The frequently observed gradual jet angle changes in samples of\npowerful blazars can be explained by orbital motion. Both observations can be\nexplained simultaneously by postulating that a high fraction of powerful radio\nsources have sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries.

The UV-optical and X-ray\nlight curves include dips and flares, while several superluminal knots appear\nin the parsec-scale jet. The recovery time of the second dip was longer at\nUV-optical wavelengths, in conflict with a model in which the inner accretion\ndisk (AD) is disrupted during a dip and then refilled from outer to inner\nradii. We favor an alternative scenario in which occasional polar alignments of\nthe magnetic field in the disk and corona cause the flux dips and formation of\nshocks in the jet. Similar to observations of Seyfert galaxies, intra-band time\nlags of flux variations are longer than predicted by the standard AD model.\nThis suggests that scattering or some other reprocessing occurs. The 37 GHz\nlight curve is well correlated with the optical-UV variations, with a ~20-day\ndelay.

It has been long suggested that such a wind\nfeedback regulates the final SMBH mass, however, it has been shown recently\nthat AGN winds can also regulate the average accretion rate at a level\nconsistent with observations of high redshift AGNs. In this paper we study the\neffect of wind feedback on the accretion rate using 2D, high resolution\nhydrodynamic simulations, that incorporate a self-consistent wind injection\nscheme and resolves the SMBH sphere of influence. Two different cases are\nexplored and compared: one in which the initial gas density is uniform, and one\nin which it has an isothermal sphere profile.

In the analysis, we consider\nrealistic conditions inside supernovae and discuss both the Dirac and Majorana\ncases.

One ejection mechanism is the ablation of the neutron star surface by\nthe burst of neutrinos in the first $30\\,\\mu$s of the merger. Another, more\nefficient, mechanism for inflating the ultra-relativistic envelope is an\ninternal shock in the massive ejecta from the merger. A strong shock is\nexpected if the merger product is a magnetar, which emits a centrifugally\naccelerated wind. The shock propagates outward through the ejecta and\naccelerates in its outer layers at radii $r\\sim 10^9-10^{10}$cm, launching an\nultra-relativistic opaque envelope filled with $\\sim 10^4$ photons per nucleon.\nThe Lorentz factor profile of the envelope rises outward and determines its\nhomologous expansion, which adiabatically cools the trapped photons.

In the Pan-STARRS1 imaging for IceCube-160427A (probability to be of\nastrophysical origin of $\\sim$50 %), we found a SN PS16cgx, located at 10.0'\nfrom the nominal IceCube direction. Spectroscopic observations of PS16cgx\nshowed that it was an H-poor SN at z = 0.2895. The spectra and light curve\nresemble some high-energy Type Ic SNe, raising the possibility of a jet driven\nSN with an explosion epoch temporally coincident with the neutrino detection.\nHowever, distinguishing Type Ia and Type Ic SNe at this redshift is notoriously\ndifficult. Based on all available data we conclude that the transient is more\nlikely to be a Type Ia with relatively weak SiII absorption and a fairly normal\nrest-frame r-band light curve. If, as predicted, there is no high-energy\nneutrino emission from Type Ia SNe, then PS16cgx must be a random coincidence,\nand unrelated to the IceCube-160427A.

Abstract: We present a new approach to tackle the issue of radio loudness in quasars.\nWe constrain a (simple) prescription for the intrinsic distribution of\nradio-to-optical ratios by comparing properties of Monte Carlo simulated\nsamples with those of observed optically selected quasars. We find strong\nevidence for a dependence of the radio luminosity on the optical one, even\nthough with a large scatter. The dependence of the fraction of radio loud\nquasars on apparent and absolute optical magnitudes results in a selection\neffect related to the radio and optical limits of current surveys.
