During the observation, Mrk\n421 was undergoing a large flare and the X-ray flux was variable, decreasing by\n~ 50 %, from 7.8x10^{-10} to 3.7x10^{-10} erg/s/cm^2 in about 6 hours, followed\nby an increase by ~ 35 %. Thanks to the broad bandpass coupled with\nhigh-sensitivity of Suzaku, we measured the evolution of the spectrum over the\n0.4--60 keV band in data segments as short as ~1 ksec. The data show deviations\nfrom a simple power law model, but also a clear spectral variability. The\ntime-resolved spectra are fitted by a synchrotron model, where the observed\nspectrum is due to a exponentially cutoff power law distribution of electrons\nradiating in uniform magnetic field; this model is preferred over a broken\npower law. As another scenario, we separate the spectrum into \"steady\" and\n\"variable\" components by subtracting the spectrum in the lowest-flux period\nfrom those of other data segments. In this context, the difference (\"variable\")\nspectra are all well described by a broken power law model with photon index\nGamma ~ 1.6, breaking at energy epsilon_{brk} ~ 3 keV to another photon index\nGamma ~ 2.1 above the break energy, differing from each other only by\nnormalization, while the spectrum of the \"steady\" component is best described\nby the synchrotron model. We suggest the rapidly variable component is due to\nrelatively localized shock (Fermi I) acceleration, while the slowly variable\n(\"steady\") component is due to the superposition of shocks located at larger\ndistance along the jet, or due to other acceleration process, such as the\nstochastic acceleration on magnetic turbulence (Fermi II) in the more extended\nregion. \n\n"}

The rotation of the space-time channels a fraction of the disc\nenergy (i.e., the gravitational energy of the disc plus the rotational energy\nof the BH which is deposited into the disc by magnetic connection) into a\npopulation of particles that escape from the disc surfaces, carrying away mass,\nenergy and angular momentum in the form of jets, allowing the remaining disc\ngas to accrete.

Linear acceleration emission occurs when a charged particle is\naccelerated parallel to its velocity. We evaluate the spectral and angular\ndistribution of this radiation for several special cases, including constant\nacceleration (hyperbolic motion) of finite duration. Based on these results, we\nfind the following general properties of the emission from an electron in a\nlinear accelerator that can be characterized by an electric field E acting over\na distance L: (i) the spectrum extends to a cut-off photon energy ~ LE^2 MeV,\nwhere E is in units of the Schwinger critical field and L in units of the\nCompton wavelength of the electron. (ii) the total energy emitted by a particle\ntraversing the accelerator is in agreement with the standard Larmor formula\n(iii) the low frequency spectrum is flat for hyperbolic trajectories, but in\ngeneral depends on the details of the accelerator. We also show that linear\nacceleration emission complements curvature radiation in the strongly\nmagnetized pair formation regions in pulsar magnetospheres. It dominates when\nthe length L of the accelerator is less than the formation length of curvature\nphotons, which is given by the ratio of the radius of curvature of the magnetic\nfield lines to the Lorentz factor of the particle. In standard static models of\npair creating regions linear acceleration emission is negligible, but it is\nimportant in more realistic dynamical models in which the accelerating field\nfluctuates on a short length-scale. \n\n"}

The first light, typically a UV or X-ray flash, is\nfollowed by a broken power-law decay of the luminosity generated by radiation\nthat leaks out of the expanding gas sphere. Motivated by recent detection of\nemission from very early stages of several SNe, we revisit the theory of shock\nbreakout and the following emission. We derive analytic light curves, paying\nspecial attention to the photon-gas coupling and deviations from thermal\nequilibrium. We then consider the breakout from several SNe progenitors. We\nfind that for more compact progenitors, white dwarfs, Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs)\nand possibly more energetic blue-supergiant explosions, the observed radiation\nis out of thermal equilibrium at the breakout, during the planar phase (i.e.,\nbefore the expanding gas doubles its radius), and during the early spherical\nphase. Therefore, during these phases we predict significantly higher\ntemperatures than previous analysis that assumed equilibrium. When thermal\nequilibrium prevails, we find the location of the thermalization depth and its\ntemporal evolution. Our results are useful for interpretation of early SN light\ncurves. Some examples are: (i) Red supergiant SNe have an early bright peak in\noptical and UV flux, less than an hour after breakout. It is followed by a\nminimum at the end of the planar phase (about 10 hr), before it peaks again\nonce the temperature drops to the observed frequency range.

Black-Hole Images Abstract: According to the no-hair theorem, all astrophysical black holes are fully\ndescribed by their masses and spins.

In this paper, we analyze images of black holes within a framework\nthat allows us to calculate observables in the electromagnetic spectrum as a\nfunction of the mass, spin, and, independently, the quadrupole moment of a\nblack hole. We show that a deviation of the quadrupole moment from the expected\nKerr value leads to images of black holes that are either prolate or oblate\ndepending on the sign and magnitude of the deviation. In addition, there is a\nring-like structure around the black-hole shadow with a diameter of about 10\nblack-hole masses that is substantially brighter than the image of the\nunderlying accretion flow and that is independent of the astrophysical details\nof accretion flow models.

Thus, a heating\nmechanism needs to be added to the cooling models in order to obtain agreement\nbetween theory and observation. Aims: Several internal heating mechanisms could\nbe operating in neutron stars, such as magnetic field decay, dark matter\naccretion, crust cracking, superfluid vortex creep, and non-equilibrium\nreactions (\"rotochemical heating\"). We study these mechanisms in order to\nestablish which could be the dominant source of thermal emission from old\npulsars. Methods: We show by simple estimates that magnetic field decay, dark\nmatter accretion, and crust cracking mechanism are unlikely to have a\nsignificant effect on old neutron stars. The thermal evolution for the other\nmechanisms is computed using the code of Fern\\'andez and Reisenegger. Given the\ndependence of the heating mechanisms on the spin-down parameters, we study the\nthermal evolution for two types of pulsars: young, slowly rotating \"classical\"\npulsars and old, fast rotating millisecond pulsars. Results: We find that\nmagnetic field decay, dark matter accretion, and crust cracking do not produce\ndetectable heating of old pulsars. Rotochemical heating and vortex creep can be\nimportant both for classical pulsars and millisecond pulsars. More restrictive\nupper limits on the surface temperatures of classical pulsars could rule out\nvortex creep as the main source of thermal emission. Rotochemical heating in\nclassical pulsars is driven by the chemical imbalance built up during their\nearly spin-down, and therefore strongly sensitive to their initial rotation\nperiod. \n\n"}

We report results of an X-ray study of the supernova remnant (SNR)\nG344.7-0.1 and the point-like X-ray source located at the geometrical center of\nthe SNR radio structure. Methods. The morphology and spectral properties of the\nremnant and the central X-ray point-like source were studied using data from\nthe XMM-Newton and Chandra satellites. Archival radio data and infrared Spitzer\nobservations at 8 and 24 $\\mu$m were used to compare and study its multi-band\nproperties at different wavelengths. Results. The XMM-Newton and Chandra\nobservations reveal that the overall X-ray emission of G344.7-0.1 is extended\nand correlates very well with regions of bright radio and infrared emission.\nThe X-ray spectrum is dominated by prominent atomic emission lines. These\ncharacteristics suggest that the X-ray emission originated in a thin thermal\nplasma, whose radiation is represented well by a plane-parallel shock plasma\nmodel (PSHOCK). Our study favors the scenario in which G344.7-0.1 is a 6 x 10^3\nyear old SNR expanding in a medium with a high density gradient and is most\nlikely encountering a molecular cloud on the western side. In addition, we\nreport the discovery of a soft point-like X-ray source located at the\ngeometrical center of the radio SNR structure. The object presents some\ncharacteristics of the so-called compact central objects (CCO). However, its\nneutral hydrogen absorption column (N_{H}) is inconsistent with that of the\nSNR. Coincident with the position of the source, we found infrared and optical\nobjects with typical early-K star characteristics.

Linear Theory Abstract: We study the tidal excitation of gravity modes (g-modes) in compact white\ndwarf binary systems with periods ranging from minutes to hours. As the orbit\nof the system decays via gravitational radiation, the orbital frequency\nincreases and sweeps through a series of resonances with the g-modes of the\nwhite dwarf. At each resonance, the tidal force excites the g-mode to a\nrelatively large amplitude, transferring the orbital energy to the stellar\noscillation. We calculate the eigenfrequencies of g-modes and their coupling\ncoefficients with the tidal field for realistic non-rotating white dwarf\nmodels. Using these mode properties, we numerically compute the excited mode\namplitude in the linear approximation as the orbit passes though the resonance,\nincluding the backreaction of the mode on the orbit. We also derive analytical\nestimates for the mode amplitude and the duration of the resonance, which\naccurately reproduce our numerical results for most binary parameters. We find\nthat the g-modes can be excited to a dimensionless (mass-weighted) amplitude up\nto 0.1, with the mode energy approaching $10^{-3}$ of the gravitational binding\nenergy of the star. This suggests that thousands of years prior to the binary\nmerger, the white dwarf may be heated up significantly by tidal interactions.\nHowever, more study is needed since the physical amplitudes of the excited\noscillation modes become highly nonlinear in the outer layer of the star, which\ncan reduce the mode amplitude attained by tidal excitation. \n\n"}

In frequentist\nparameter estimation, a central requirement for properly constructed confidence\nintervals is that they cover true parameter values, preferably at exactly the\nstated confidence level when experiments are repeated infinitely many times.\nSince most widely-used scanning techniques are optimised for Bayesian\nstatistics, one needs to assess their abilities in providing correct confidence\nintervals in terms of the statistical coverage.

This instability is an inevitable outcome of\ninteractions between shock and ambient density fluctuations. We find that the\nmagnetic energy grows exponentially in a few eddy turnover times, and then,\nfollowing the decay of kinetic turbulence, decays with a temporal power-law\nexponent of -0.7. The magnetic-energy fraction can reach $epsilon_B \\sim$ 0.1\nbut depends on the initial magnetic field strength. We find that the magnetic\nenergy grows by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the magnetic\nenergy immediately behind the shock. This minimum degree of the amplification\ndoes not depend on the amplitude of the initial density fluctuations, while the\ngrowth timescale and the maximum magnetic energy depend on the degree of\ninhomogeneity in the density. The transition from Kolmogorov cascade to MHD\ncritical balance cascade occurs at $\\sim$ 1/10th the initial inhomogeneity\nscale, which limits the maximum synchrotron polarization to less than 2%.

These quasars were\nidentified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at high redshift (z~2.2); eight are\nradio quiet while two are radio intermediate.

Forty seven of the 222 BzK\ngalaxies in the central region of the CDF-S are detected at X-ray energies, 11\nof which have hard X-ray spectral slopes (Gamma<1) indicating the presence of\nheavily obscured AGN activity.

The majority (7 out of\n11) of the heavily obscured AGNs have excess IR emission over that expected\nfrom star formation (termed \"IR-excess galaxies\"). However, we find that X-ray\ndetected heavily obscured AGNs only comprise ~25% of the IR-excess galaxy\npopulation, which is otherwise composed of relatively unobscured AGNs and\nstarburst galaxies. We find that the typical X-ray spectrum of the heavily\nobscured AGNs is better characterized by a pure reflection model than an\nabsorbed power-law model, suggesting extreme Compton-thick absorption in some\nsystems.

Two kinds of broad emission line region (BELR) models\nhave been proposed, outflow and gravitationally bound BELR, which are supported\nrespectively by blueshift of the CIV line and reverberation mapping\nobservations. To reconcile these two apparently different models, we present a\ndetailed comparison study between the CIV and MgII lines using a sample of AGNs\nselected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the kinematics of the\nCIV region is different from that of MgII, which is thought to be controlled by\ngravity. A strong correlation is found between the blueshift and asymmetry of\nthe CIV profile and the Eddington ratio. This provides strong observational\nsupport for the postulation that the outflow is driven by radiation pressure.\nIn particular, we find robust evidence that the CIV line region is largely\ndominated by outflow at high Eddington ratios, while it is primarily\ngravitationally bounded at low Eddington ratios. Our results indicate that\nthese two emitting regions coexist in most of AGNs. The emission strength from\nthese two gases varies smoothly with Eddington ratio in opposite ways.

From a comparison with the optical\nemission-line widths obtained from spectropolarimetric observations, we found\nthat the location of Fe Ka line-emitting material is a factor of ~0.7-11 times\nthe size of the optical BLR. Furthermore, compared to 13 type I AGNs for which\nthe best Fe Ka line FWHM constraints were obtained, we found no difference in\nthe FWHM distribution or the mean FWHM, and this conclusion is independent of\nthe central black hole mass.

We find that the joint\nenergy spectra can be well fitted with a model composed of a blackbody and a\ncutoff power-law, with a cutoff energy decreasing from $ \\sim$ 150 keV to\n$\\sim$ 40 keV as the source leaves the quiescent state toward the low hard\nstate. This fits into a scenario in which the corona is cooled by the soft\nX-rays along the outburst evolution, as observed in several other atoll\nsources. By using the flux measured in the 1.5--30 keV band of the type-I\nbursts during the outburst, we find that the linear relationship between the\nburst duration and the flux still holds for those bursts that occur at the\ndecaying part of the low hard state, but with a different slope than the\noverall one that was estimated with the bursts happening in the whole extent\nof, and for the rest of the low hard state. The significance of such a\ndichotomy in the type-I X-ray bursts is $\\sim$ 3 $\\sigma$ under an F-test.\nSimilar results are hinted at as well with the broader energy-band that was\nadopted recently. This dichotomy may be understood in a scenario where part of\nthe accreting material forms a corona on the way of falling onto the surface of\nthe neutron star during the decaying part of the low hard state. Based on the\naccretion rates of the preceding LHS, estimated from type-I X-ray bursts and\nfrom persistent emission, at least for IGR J17473-2721, most of the accretion\nmaterial may fall on the neutron star (NS) surface in the LHS. Considering the\nburst behavior in the context of the outburst indicates a corona formed on top\nof the disk rather than on the NS surface. \n\n"}

The field decay\nprobably also causes them to be systematically hotter than pulsars of the same\n(true) age. \n\n"}

We confirm that the frequency of sources in the\nradio-quiet sample showing UFOs is >35%. The outflow velocity distribution\nspans from \\sim10,000km/s (\\sim0.03c) up to \\sim100,000km/s (\\sim0.3c), with a\npeak and mean value of \\sim42,000km/s (\\sim0.14c).

The remnant is composed of a central pulsar wind nebula and a\nbright partial shell in the south that is visible at radio, IR, and X-ray\nwavelengths. The X-ray emission can be modeled by either a single thermal\ncomponent with a temperature of ~ 1.5 keV, or with two thermal components with\ntemperatures of 1.5 and 0.2 keV. Previous studies suggest that the hot\ncomponent may originate from reverse-shocked SN ejecta. However, our new\nanalysis shows no definitive evidence for enhanced abundances of Si, S, Ar, Mg,\nand Fe, as expected from supernova (SN) ejecta, or for the IR spectral\nsignatures characteristic of confirmed SN condensed dust, thus favoring a\ncircumstellar or interstellar origin for the X-ray and IR emission. The X-ray\nand IR emission in the shell are spatially correlated, suggesting that the dust\nparticles are collisionally heated by the X-ray emitting gas. The IR spectrum\nof the shell is dominated by continuum emission from dust with little, or no\nline emission. Modeling the IR spectrum shows that the dust is heated to a\ntemperature of ~ 140 K by a relatively dense, hot plasma, that also gives rise\nto the hot X-ray emission component. The density inferred from the IR emission\nis significantly higher than the density inferred from the X-ray models,\nsuggesting a low filling factor for this X-ray emitting gas. The total mass of\nthe warm dust component is at least 0.013 solar masses, assuming no significant\ndust destruction has occurred in the shell. The IR data also reveal the\npresence of an additional plasma component with a cooler temperature,\nconsistent with the 0.2 keV gas component.

We suggest that the GRB prompt emission is\nmainly a result of two upscattering processes. The first process is the\nComptonization of relatively cold soft photons of the star off electrons of a\nhot shell of plasma of temperature T_e of the order of 10^{9} K (or kT_e~100\nkeV) that moves sub-relativistically with the bulk velocity V_b substantially\nless than the speed of light c. In this phase, the Comptonization parameter Y\nis high and the interaction between a blackbody-like soft seed photon\npopulation and hot electrons leads to formation of a saturated Comptonization\nspectrum modified by the sub-relativistic bulk outflow. The second process is\nan upscattering of the previously Comptonized spectrum by the plasma outflow\nonce it becomes relativistic. This process gives rise to the high-energy\npower-law component above the peak in the EF(E)-diagram where F(E) is the\nenergy flux. The latter process can be described by a convolution of the\nComptonized spectrum with a broken-power-law Green function. Possible physical\nscenarios for this second upscattering process are discussed. In the framework\nof our model, we give an interpretation of the Amati relation between the\nintrinsic spectral peak photon energy and radiated energy or luminosity, and we\npropose a possible explanation of the GRB temporal variability. \n\n"}

In order to confirm the Kerr-nature of these\nobjects, we need to probe the geometry of the space-time around them and see if\nthe observations are consistent with the predictions of the Kerr metric. That\ncan be achieved, for instance, by studying the properties of the\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by the gas in the accretion disk. The\nhigh-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in the X-ray flux of some\nstellar-mass black hole candidates might do the job. As the frequencies of\nthese oscillations depend only very weakly on the observed X-ray flux, it is\nthought they are mainly determined by the metric of the space-time. In this\npaper, I consider the resonance models proposed by Abramowicz and Kluzniak and\nI extend previous results to the case of non-Kerr space-times. The emerging\npicture is more complicated than the one around a Kerr black hole and there is\na larger number of possible combinations between different modes. I then\ncompare the bounds inferred from the twin peak high-frequency quasi-periodic\noscillations observed in three micro-quasars (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, and\nGRS 1915+105) with the measurements from the continuum-fitting method of the\nsame objects. For Kerr black holes, the two approaches do not provide\nconsistent results. In a non-Kerr geometry, this conflict may be solved if the\nobserved quasi-periodic oscillations are produced by the resonance $\\nu_\\theta\n: \\nu_r = 3:1$, where $\\nu_\\theta$ and $\\nu_r$ are the two epicyclic\nfrequencies. It is at least worth mentioning that the deformation from the Kerr\nsolution required by observations would be consistent with the one suggested in\nanother recent work discussing the possibility that steady jets are powered by\nthe spin of these compact objects. \n\n"}

The reason for this remains an unsolved problem that hampers our\nability to measure the spin frequency of most accreting NSs. The accreting\nmillisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) HETE J1900.1--2455 is an intermittent pulsar\nthat exhibited pulsations at about 377 Hz for the first 2 months and then\nturned in a non-pulsating source.

These high resolution (1 pc) simulations follow formation and\ndestruction of individual GMCs and star clusters. The final starburst is\ndominated by in situ star formation, fueled by gas which flows inwards due to\nglobal torques. The resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation.\nThe gas is self gravitating, and forms massive (~10^10 M_sun) GMCs and\nsubsequent super-starclusters (masses up to 10^8 M_sun). However, in contrast\nto some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form the\ncentral bulge are not born in superclusters which then sink to the center of\nthe galaxy, because feedback efficiently disperses GMCs after they turn several\npercent of their mass into stars. Most of the mass that reaches the nucleus\ndoes so in the form of gas. The Kennicutt-Schmidt law emerges naturally as a\nconsequence of feedback balancing gravitational collapse, independent of the\nsmall-scale star formation microphysics. The same mechanisms that drive this\nrelation in isolated galaxies, in particular radiation pressure from IR\nphotons, extend over seven decades in SFR to regulate star formation in the\nmost extreme starbursts (densities >10^4 M_sun/pc^2). Feedback also drives\nsuper-winds with large mass loss rates; but a significant fraction of the wind\nmaterial falls back onto the disks at later times, leading to higher\npost-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback. Strong AGN feedback is\nrequired to explain sharp cutoffs in star formation rate. We compare the\npredicted relic structure, mass profile, morphology, and efficiency of disk\nsurvival to simulations which do not explicitly resolve GMCs or feedback.\nGlobal galaxy properties are similar, but sub-galactic properties and star\nformation rates can differ significantly. \n\n"}

A mismatch between the\nmagnetospheric current distribution and the current injected by the polar cap\naccelerator gives rise to reverse plasma flows in the magnetosphere. The\nreverse flow shields the electric field in the polar gap and thus shuts up the\nplasma production process. I assume that a circulating system of streams is\nformed such that the upward streams are produced in narrow gaps separated by\ndownward streams. The electric drift is small in this model because the\npotential drop in narrow gaps is small. The gaps have to drift because by the\ntime a downward stream reaches the star surface and shields the electric field,\nthe corresponding gap has to shift. The transverse size of the streams is\ndetermined by the condition that the potential drop in the gaps is sufficient\nfor the pair production.

This result has important theoretical and observational\nimplications. However, because of technical difficulties, the radial dynamic\nrange in almost all previous simulations usually spans at most two orders of\nmagnitude.

However, no consensus\ncurrently exists as to which progenitor scenario is the correct one, or whether\nthe observed SN Ia rate is produced by a combination of both channels. Unlike a\nDD progenitor a SD progenitor is expected to emit supersoft X-rays for a\nprolonged period of time (~1 Myr) as a result of the burning of accreted matter\non the surface of the WD. An argument against the SD channel as a significant\nproducer of SNe type Ia has been the lack of observed supersoft X-ray sources\n(SSS) and the lower-than-expected integrated soft X-ray flux from elliptical\ngalaxies.\n  We wish to determine if it is possible to obscure the supersoft X-ray\nemission from a nuclear burning white dwarf in an accreting single degenerate\nbinary system. In case of obscured systems we wish to determine their general\nobservational characteristics.\n  We examine the emergent X-ray emission from a canonical SSS system surrounded\nby a spherically symmetric configuration of material, assuming a black body\nspectrum with T_BB=50 eV and L=10^38 erg/s. The circumbinary material is\nassumed to be of solar chemical abundances, and we leave the mechanism behind\nthe mass loss into the circumbinary region unspecified.\n  If steadily accreting, nuclear burning WDs are canonical SSS our analysis\nsuggests that they can be obscured by relatively modest circumbinary mass loss\nrates. This may explain the discrepancy of SSS compared to the SN Ia rate\ninferred from observations if the SD progenitor scenario contributes\nsignificantly to the SN Ia rate.

We carry out a\ntime dependent numerical simulation where both the hydrodynamics and the\nradiative transfer processes are coupled together. We consider a two-component\naccretion flow in which the Keplerian disk is immersed into an accreting\nlow-angular momentum flow (halo) around a black hole. The soft photons which\noriginate from the Keplerian disk are inverse-Comptonized by the electrons in\nthe halo and the region between the centrifugal pressure supported shocks and\nthe horizon. We run several cases by changing the rate of the Keplerian disk\nand see the effects on the shock location and properties of the outflow and the\nspectrum. We show that as a result of Comptonization of the Compton cloud, the\ncloud becomes cooler with the increase in the Keplerian disk rate. As the\nresultant thermal pressure is reduced, the post-shock region collapses and the\noutflow rate is also reduced. Since the hard radiation is produced from the\npost-shock region, and the spectral slope increases with the reduction of the\nelectron temperature, the cooling produces softer spectrum. We thus find a\ndirect correlation between the spectral states and the outflow rates of an\naccreting black hole. \n\n"}

{"id": "1210.6093", "contents": "Title: Outflow from Hot Accretion Flows Abstract: Numerical simulations of hot accretion flows have shown that the mass\naccretion rate decreases with decreasing radius. Two models have been proposed\nto explain this result. In the adiabatic inflow-outflow solution (ADIOS), it is\nthought to be due to the loss of gas in outflows. In the convection-dominated\naccretion flow (CDAF) model, it is explained as because that the gas is locked\nin convective eddies. In this paper we use hydrodynamical (HD) and\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to investigate which one is physical.\nWe calculate and compare various properties of inflow (gas with an inward\nvelocity) and outflow (gas with an outward velocity). Systematic and\nsignificant differences are found. For example, for HD flows, the temperature\nof outflow is higher than inflow; while for MHD flows, the specific angular\nmomentum of outflow is much higher than inflow. We have also analyzed the\nconvective stability of MHD accretion flow and found that they are stable.\nThese results suggest that systematic inward and outward motion must exist,\ni.e., the ADIOS model is favored. The different properties of inflow and\noutflow also suggest that the mechanisms of producing outflow in HD and MHD\nflows are buoyancy associated with the convection and the centrifugal force\nassociated with the angular momentum transport mediated by the magnetic field,\nrespectively. The latter mechanism is similar to the Blandford & Payne\nmechanism but no large-scale open magnetic field is required here. Possible\nobservational applications are briefly discussed. \n\n"}

One way\nto distinguish between the SDS and the double-degenerate scenario is to search\nfor the post-impact remnant stars (PIRSs) in SN Ia remnants. Using a technique\nthat combines multi-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations with one-dimensional\nstellar evolution simulations, we have examined the post-impact evolution of\nhelium-rich binary companions in the SDS.

Subsequently, they\ncontract and evolve to become hot blue-subdwarf-like (sdO-like) stars by\nreleasing gravitational energy, persisting as sdO-like stars for several\nmillion years before evolving to the helium red-giant phase.

In 2009, a warm Spitzer survey observed 30 SNe IIn\ndiscovered in 2003 - 2008 and detected 10 SNe at distances out to 175 Mpc with\nunreported late-time infrared emission, in some cases more than 5 years\npost-discovery. For this single epoch of data, the warm-dust parameters suggest\nthe presence of a radiative heating source consisting of optical/X-ray emission\ncontinuously generated by ongoing CSM interaction. Here we present\nmulti-wavelength follow-up observations of this sample of 10 SNe IIn and the\nwell-studied Type IIn SN 2010jl.

To account for the principle effects of general\nrelativity (GR), we propose a modification of the standard Newtonian evolution\nequation for the (orbit-averaged) time-varying disk surface density. In our\nmodified equation the viscous torque in the disk is treated in full GR, while\nthe tidal torque is handled in the Newtonian limit. Our GR-hybrid treatment is\nreasonable because the tidal torque is concentrated near the orbital radius of\nthe secondary and is most important prior to binary-disk decoupling, when the\norbital separation is large and resides in the weak-field regime. The tidal\ntorque on the disk diminishes during late merger and vanishes altogether\nfollowing merger. By contrast, the viscous torque drives the flow into the\nstrong-field region and onto the primary during all epochs. Following binary\ncoalescence, the viscous torque alone governs the time-dependent accretion onto\nthe remnant, as well as the temporal behavior, strength and spectrum of the\naftermath electromagnetic radiation from the disk.

Multiple\nX-ray observations were taken within one month of each other, allowing us to\ntrack each individual system's X-ray spectral evolution during its decay. We\ncompare these three systems to other BHXB systems. We confirm that quiescent\nBHXBs have softer X-ray spectra than low-hard state BHXBs, and that quiescent\nBHXB spectral properties show no dependence on the binary system's orbital\nparameters. However, the observed anti-correlation between X-ray photon index\nand l_x in the low-hard state does not continue once a BHXB enters quiescence.\nInstead, the photon index plateaus to an average value of 2.08+/-0.07 by the\ntime l_x reaches approximately 1e-5. l_x~1e-5 is thus an\nobservationally-motivated upper limit for the beginning of the quiescent\nspectral state. Our results are discussed in the context of different accretion\nflow models, and across the black hole mass scale. \n\n"}

In this paper, we revisit XENON100's\nconstraint on dark matter in this mass range, and consider how various\nuncertainties and assumptions made might alter this conclusion. We also note\nthat while XENON100's two nuclear recoil candidates each exhibit very low\nratios of ionization-to-scintillation signals, making them difficult to\nattribute to known electronic or neutron backgrounds, they are consistent with\noriginating from dark matter particles in the mass range favored by CoGeNT and\nCDMS. We argue that with lower, but not implausible, values for the relative\nscintillation efficiency of liquid xenon (L_eff), and the suppression of the\nscintillation signal in liquid xenon at XENON100's electric field (S_nr), these\ntwo events could consistently arise from dark matter particles with a mass and\ncross section in the range favored by CoGeNT and CDMS.

If jet power is coupled to\nblack hole spin, deviations from the jet-disk correlation for a sample of AGN\ncan be used to probe the dispersion of the spin parameter within this sample.\nTo exploit this idea, we matched double-lobed radio sources from the FIRST\nsurvey to spectroscopically confirmed quasars from SDSS. We obtain 763 FR-II\nquasars with a median redshift of z=1.2 A tight correlation between the optical\nluminosity of the accretion disk and the lobe radio luminosity is observed.

Before using them as efficient tools in the early Universe,\nhowever, the environmental factors that govern the formation of GRBs need to be\nunderstood.

Due to the substantial\nangular momentum from the binary, such a remnant is born rapidly rotating and\nlikely acquires a strong magnetic field (a `millisecond magnetar'). Magnetic\nspin-down deposits a large fraction of the rotational energy from the magnetar\nbehind the small quantity of mass ejected during the merger. This has the\npotential for creating a bright transient that could be useful for determining\nwhether a NS or black hole was formed in the merger. We investigate the\nexpected signature of such an event, including for the first time the important\nimpact of electron/positron pairs injected by the millisecond magnetar into the\nsurrounding nebula. These pairs cool via synchrotron and inverse Compton\nemission, producing a pair cascade and hard X-ray spectrum. A fraction of these\nX-rays are absorbed by the ejecta walls and re-emitted as thermal radiation,\nleading to an optical/UV transient peaking at a luminosity of ~1e43-1e44 erg/s\non a timescale of several hours to days. This is dimmer than predicted by\nsimpler analytic models because the large optical depth of electron/positron\npairs across the nebula suppresses the efficiency with which the magnetar spin\ndown luminosity is thermalized. Nevertheless, the optical/UV emission is more\nthan two orders of magnitude brighter than a radioactively powered `kilonova.'\nIn some cases nebular X-rays are sufficiently luminous to re-ionize the ejecta,\nin which case non-thermal X-rays escape the ejecta unattenuated with a similar\npeak luminosity and timescale as the optical radiation.

By interpreting these\nlines to arise from highly ionized iron the implied outflow velocities of the\nX-ray absorbing gas corresponding to these lines are 0.13c and 0.41c,\nrespectively. The presence of these relativistic outflows and the absence of\nany significant low-energy X-ray absorption suggest that a shielding gas is not\nrequired for the generation of the relativistic X-ray absorbing winds in HS\n0810+2554. UV spectroscopic observations with VLT/UVES indicate that the UV\nabsorbing material is outflowing at v_UV ~0.065c. Our analysis indicates that\nthe fraction of the total bolometric energy released by HS 0810+2554 into the\nIGM in the form of kinetic energy is epsilon_k = 1.0(-0.6,+0.8). An efficiency\nof greater than unity implies that magnetic driving is likely a significant\ncontributor to the acceleration of this X-ray absorbing wind. We also estimate\nthe mass-outflow rate of the strongest absorption component to be\nMdot_abs=1.1(-0.7,+0.9) M_solar yr^-1. Assuming that the energetic outflow\ndetected in the NAL AGN HS 0810+2554 is a common property of most AGN it would\nsuggest that the X-ray absorbing wind may have a larger opening angle than\npreviously thought.

Using a large number of accurate\nnumerical-relativity simulations of binaries with nuclear equations of state,\nwe find that the postmerger emission is characterized by two distinct and\nrobust spectral features. While the high-frequency peak has already been\nassociated with the oscillations of the hypermassive neutron star produced by\nthe merger and depends on the equation of state, a new correlation emerges\nbetween the low-frequency peak, related to the merger process, and the total\ncompactness of the stars in the binary.

If the mass of the binary is known from the inspiral\nsignal, the combined use of the two frequency peaks sets four simultaneous\nconstraints to be satisfied. Ideally, even a single detection would be\nsufficient to select one equation of state over the others.

It is widely believed that the singularity must\nbe removed by quantum gravity effects. Some static quantum-inspired\nsingularity-free black hole solutions have been proposed in the literature, but\nwhen one considers simple examples of gravitational collapse the classical\nsingularity is replaced by a bounce, after which the collapsing matter expands\nfor ever. We may expect 3 possible explanations: $i)$ the static regular black\nhole solutions are not physical, in the sense that they cannot be realized in\nNature, $ii)$ the final product of the collapse is not unique, but it depends\non the initial conditions, or $iii)$ boundary effects play an important role\nand our simple models miss important physics. In the latter case, after proper\nadjustment, the bouncing solution would approach the static one. We argue that\nthe \"correct answer\" may be related to the appearance of a ghost state in de\nSitter spacetimes with super Planckian mass.

The strong correlation between the X-ray and the UV emissions\nindicates that the same mechanism should be responsible for part of the\nemission in these bands. Optical and infrared photometric observations show\nthat the companion star is strongly irradiated. Double-peaked emission lines in\nthe optical spectra provide compelling evidence for the presence of an outer\naccretion disc too. The spectral energy distribution from IR to X-rays is well\nmodelled if the contributions from the companion, the disc and the intra-binary\nshock emission are all considered. Our extensive data set can be interpreted in\nterms of an engulfed radio pulsar: the radio pulsar is still active, but\nundetectable in the radio band due to a large amount of ionized material\nsurrounding the compact object. X-rays and gamma-rays are produced in an\nintra-binary shock front between the relativistic pulsar wind and matter from\nthe companion and an outer accretion disc. The intense spin-down power\nirradiates the disc and the companion star, accounting for the UV and optical\nemissions. \n\n"}

Abstract: We investigate effect of a test magnetic field on the process of destroying\nnear-extremal Kerr black hole with a charged test particle. It has been shown\nthat it would be possible to throw a charged test particle into the near\nextremal rotating black hole and make it go past the extremality i.e. turn Kerr\nblack hole into the Kerr-Newmann naked singularity. Typically in an\nastrophysical scenario black holes are believed to be surrounded by a magnetic\nfield. Magnetic field although small, affects motion of charged particles\ndrastically due to the large Lorentz force, as the electromagnetic force is\nmuch stronger that the gravity. Thus a test magnetic field can affect the\nprocess of destroying black holes and restore the cosmic censorship in the\nastrophysical context. We show that a test magnetic field would act as a cosmic\ncensor beyond a certain threshold value.

We find that the magnetic field\nrequired in only as strong as or slightly stronger as compared to the value for\nwhich its effect of the background geometry is comparable to the tiny\nbackreaction as that of the test particle.

Unfortunately\nthis emission has been difficult to constrain and thus presents an uncertain\nforeground to any attempts to extract potential dark matter signal. Recently,\nIceCube has detected high-energy isotropic neutrino flux which could be of an\nextragalactic origin. In general, neutrinos can be linked to gamma rays since\ncosmic-ray interactions produce neutral and charged pions where neutral pions\ndecay into gamma rays, while charged pions decay to give neutrinos. By assuming\nthat isotropic high-energy IceCube neutrinos are entirely produced by cosmic\nrays accelerated in accretion shocks during the process of structure formation,\nwe obtain the strongest constraint to the gamma-ray emission from large scale\nstructure formation (strong) shocks and find that they can make at best ~20% of\nthe extragalactic gamma-ray background, corresponding to neutrino flux with\nspectral index 2, or ~10% for spectral index 2.46.

In the past several years, 3D numerical\nsimulations made it possible to compute pulsar spindown luminosity from first\nprinciples and revealed that oblique pulsar winds are more powerful than\naligned ones. However, what causes this enhanced power output of oblique\npulsars is not understood. In this work, using time-dependent 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and force-free simulations, we show that, contrary to\nthe standard paradigm, the open magnetic flux, which carries the energy away\nfrom the pulsar, is laterally non-uniform. We argue that this non-uniformity is\nthe primary reason for the increased luminosity of oblique pulsars. To\ndemonstrate this, we construct simple analytic descriptions of aligned and\northogonal pulsar winds and combine them to obtain an accurate 3D description\nof the pulsar wind for any obliquity. Our approach describes both the warped\nmagnetospheric current sheet and the smooth variation of pulsar wind properties\noutside of it. We find that generically the magnetospheric current sheet\nseparates plasmas that move at mildly relativistic velocities relative to each\nother. This suggests that the magnetospheric reconnection is a type of driven,\nrather than free, reconnection. The jump in magnetic field components across\nthe current sheet decreases with increasing obliquity, which could be a\nmechanism that reduces dissipation in near-orthogonal pulsars. Our analytical\ndescription of the pulsar wind can be used for constructing models of pulsar\ngamma-ray emission, pulsar wind nebulae, and magnetar-powered core-collapse\ngamma-ray bursts and supernovae. \n\n"}

In this band the Compton component is rapidly rising\nalmost up to the peak of the emission. Simultaneous soft-X-rays and UV-optical\nobservations were performed with the Swift satellite, while near-infrared (NIR)\ndata were obtained with the REM telescope. To study their variability, we\nrepeated these observations for both sources on a timescale of a few months.\nWhile no fast variability was detected during a single observation, both\nsources were found to be variable in the X-ray band, up to 50%, between the two\nobservations, with larger variability at higher energies. No variability was\ndetected in the optical/NIR band. These data together with Fermi-LAT, WISE and\nother literature data are then used to study the overall spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of these blazars. Although the jet non-thermal emission\ndominates the SED, it leaves the UV band unhidden, allowing us to detect the\nthermal emission of the disc and to estimate the mass of the black hole.

Despite decades of\nefforts, many aspects of the physics of relativistic jets remain elusive. In\nparticular, the location and the mechanisms responsible for the high-energy\nemission and the connection of the variability at different wavelengths are\namong the greatest challenges in the study of AGN. Recent high resolution radio\nobservations of flaring objects locate the high-energy emitting region\ndownstream the jet at parsec scale distance from the central engine, posing\nquestions on the nature of the seed photons upscattered to gamma-rays.\nFurthermore, monitoring campaigns of the most active blazars indicate that not\nall the high energy flares have the same characteristics in the various energy\nbands, even from the same source, making the interpretation of the mechanism\nresponsible for the high-energy emission not trivial.

Thus, hadron-initiated showers\ndetected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator\nfrom the surface array (usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance\nfrom the shower core S(r0)) with the primary energy.

Therefore, pure Monte\nCarlo parametrizations are used instead.\n  In this work, we present a new method to determine the primary energy of\nhadron-induced showers in a hybrid experiment based on a technique previously\ndeveloped for photon primaries. It consists on a set of calibration curves that\nrelate the surface energy estimator, S(r0), and the depth of maximum\ndevelopment of the shower, Xmax, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes.\nThen, the primary energy can be determined from pure surface information since\nS(r0) and the zenith angle of the incoming shower are only needed.

In the\nframework of star-quake model, based on~\\cite{Baym1971}, the glitch-sizes (the\nrelative increases of spin-frequencies during glitches) $\\Delta \\Omega/\\Omega$\ndepend on the released energies during glitches, with less released energies\ncorresponding to smaller glitch sizes. On the other hand, as one of dark matter\ncandidates, our Galaxy might be filled with the so called strange nuggets (SNs)\nwhich are the relics from the early Universe. In this case the collisions\nbetween pulsars and SNs is inevitable, and these collisions would lead to\nglitches when enough elastic energy has been accumulated during the spin-down\nprocess. The SNs-triggered glitches could release less energy, because the\naccumulated elastic energy would be less than that in the scenario of glitches\nwithout SNs. Therefore, if a pulsar is hit frequently by SNs, it would tend to\nhave more small size glitches, whose values of $\\Delta \\Omega/\\Omega$ are\nsmaller than that in standard star-quake model (with larger amounts of released\nenergy). Based on the assumption that in our Galaxy the distribution of SNs is\nsimilar to that of dark matter, as well as on the glitch data in ATNF Pulsar\nCatalogue and Jodrell Bank glitch table, we find that in our Galaxy the\nincidences of small size glitches exhibit tendencies consistent with the\ncollision rates of pulsars and strange nuggets.

The soft extended emission\nand the simultaneous late re-brightening in both the X-ray and optical\nafterglow lightcurves raise interesting questions regarding its physical\norigin. We show that the broad-band data of GRB 080503 can be well explained\nwithin the framework of the double neutron star merger model, provided that the\nmerger remnant is a rapidly-rotating massive neutron star with an extremely\nhigh magnetic field (i.e. a millisecond magnetar). We show that the late\noptical re-brightening is consistent with the emission from a magnetar-powered\n\"merger-nova\". This adds one more case to the growing sample of merger-novae\nassociated with short GRBs. The soft extended emission and the late X-ray\nexcess emission are well connected through a magnetar dipole spin-down\nluminosity evolution function, suggesting that direct magnetic dissipation is\nthe mechanism to produce these X-rays. The X-ray emission initially leaks from\na hole in the merger ejecta pierced by the short GRB jet. The hole subsequently\ncloses after the magnetar spins down and the magnetic pressure drops below ram\npressure. The X-ray photons are then trapped behind the mergernova ejecta until\nthe ejecta becomes optically thin at a later time. This explains the\nessentially simultaneous re-brightening in both the optical and X-ray\nlightcurves. Within this model, future gravitational wave sources could be\nassociated with a bright X-ray counterpart along with the mergernova, even if\nthe short GRB jet beams away from Earth. \n\n"}

The evolution of a SNR in a self-consistently generated\nthree-phase ISM is qualitatively different from that in a uniform or a\ntwo-phase warm/cold medium.

The improved hard X-ray\nsensitivity of the imaging NuSTAR data has resulted in the first robust\ndetection of Compton hump in all three objects, with amplitudes of ~1 or\ngreater in NY Lup, and likely <1.0 in the other two.

The\nmagnetic fields of the two poles are 36 and 69 MG, indicating a non-dipolar\nfield geometry. The X-ray spectrum of the main accreting pole with the lower\nfield comprises a hot thermal component from the cooling accretion plasma,\n$kT_{plas}$ of a few tens of keV, and a much less luminous blackbody-like\ncomponent from the accretion area with $kT_{\\rm bb} \\sim$ 50-100\\,eV.

In general, heat\nfrom the core should be stable on timescales $<10^4$ years, while continuing\naccretion may produce variations on a range of timescales. While some quiescent\nneutron stars (e.g. Cen X-4, Aql X-1) have shown variations in their thermal\ncomponents on a range of timescales, several others, particularly those in\nglobular clusters with no detectable nonthermal hard X-rays (fit with a\npowerlaw), have shown no measurable variations.

Pure thermal feedback alone is sufficient to produce the observed\nsurface brightness, although it is very sensitive to the supernova rate.

Dynamical capture mergers may take place in globular clusters, as\nwell as other dense stellar systems, where most neutron stars have large spins.\nWe find significant variability in the merger outcome as a function of initial\nneutron star spin. For cases where the spin is aligned with the orbital angular\nmomentum, the additional centrifugal support in the remnant hypermassive\nneutron star can prevent the prompt collapse to a black hole, while for\nantialigned cases the decreased total angular momentum can facilitate the\ncollapse to a black hole. We show that even moderate spins can significantly\nincrease the amount of ejected material, including the amount unbound with\nvelocities greater than half the speed of light, leading to brighter\nelectromagnetic signatures associated with kilonovae and interaction of the\nejecta with the interstellar medium. Furthermore, we find that the initial\nneutron star spin can strongly affect the already rich phenomenology in the\npostmerger gravitational wave signatures that arise from the oscillation modes\nof the hypermassive neutron star. In several of our simulations, the resulting\nhypermassive neutron star develops the one-arm ($m=1$) spiral instability, the\nmost pronounced cases being those with small but non-negligible neutron star\nspins.

A new interior numerical solution is\nfound of a self gravitating spinning cosmic string with a U(1) scalar gauge\nfield and the matching on the exterior space time is revealed. It is\nconjectured that the experience of CTC's close to the core of the string is\nexceedingly unlikely. It occurs when the causality breaking boundary, $r_\\mu$,\napproaches the boundary of the cosmic string, $r_{CS}$.

A more\nexotic arena for testing general relativity is in systems that contain one or\nmore black holes. Black holes are the most compact objects in the universe,\nproviding probes of the strongest-possible gravitational fields. We are\nmotivated to study strong-field gravity since many theories give large\ndeviations from general relativity only at large field strengths, while\nrecovering the weak-field behavior. In this article, we review how one can\nprobe general relativity and various alternative theories of gravity by using\nelectromagnetic waves from a black hole with an accretion disk, and\ngravitational waves from black hole binaries. We first review model-independent\nways of testing gravity with electromagnetic/gravitational waves from a black\nhole system. We then focus on selected examples of theories that extend general\nrelativity in rather simple ways. Some important characteristics of general\nrelativity include (but are not limited to) (i) only tensor gravitational\ndegrees of freedom, (ii) the graviton is massless, (iii) no quadratic or higher\ncurvatures in the action, and (iv) the theory is 4 dimensional.

Within each theory, we describe\nblack hole solutions, their properties, and current and projected constraints\non each theory using black hole-based tests of gravity.

We analyze the effects of flattening on the\nannihilation (J) and decay (D) factors of dwarf spheroidal galaxies with both\nanalytic and numerical methods. Flattening has two consequences: first, there\nis a geometric effect as the squeezing (or stretching) of the dark matter\ndistribution enhances (or diminishes) the J-factor; second, the line of sight\nvelocity dispersion of stars must hold up the flattened baryonic component in\nthe flattened dark matter halo. We provide analytic formulae and a simple\nnumerical approach to estimate the correction to the J- and D-factors required\nover simple spherical modeling. The formulae are validated with a series of\nequilibrium models of flattened stellar distributions embedded in flattened\ndark-matter distributions. We compute corrections to the J- and D-factors for\nthe Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies under the assumption that they are all\nprolate or all oblate and find that the hierarchy of J-factors for the dwarf\nspheroidals is slightly altered (typical correction factors for an ellipticity\nof $0.4$ are $0.75$ for the oblate case and $1.6$ for the prolate case). We\ndemonstrate that spherical estimates of the D-factors are very insensitive to\nthe flattening and introduce uncertainties significantly less than the\nuncertainties in the D-factors from the other observables for all the dwarf\nspheroidals (for example, ${}^{+10\\mathrm{\\,percent}}_{-3\\mathrm{\\,percent}}$\nfor a typical ellipticity of $0.4$).

Previously, we showed that for binary mass ratios 0.06 < q < 0.8,\nsynchronous L2 mass loss results in a radiatively inefficient, dust-forming\nunbound equatorial outflow. A similar outflow exists irrespective of q if the\nratio of the sound speed to the orbital speed at the injection point is\nsufficiently large, \\epsilon = c_T/v_orb > 0.15. By contrast, for cold L2\nmass-loss (\\epsilon < 0.15) from binaries with q < 0.06 or q > 0.8, the\nequatorial outflow instead remains marginally-bound and falls back to the\nbinary over tens to hundreds of binary orbits, where it experiences additional\ntidal torqueing and shocking. As the bound gas becomes virialized with the\nbinary, the luminosity of the system increases slowly at approximately constant\nphotosphere radius, causing the temperature to rise. Subsequent evolution\ndepends on the efficiency of radiative cooling. If the bound atmosphere is able\nto cool efficiently, as quantified by radiative diffusion time being shorter\nthan the advection time (t_diff/t_adv < 1), then the virialized gas collapses\nto an excretion disk, while for t_diff/t_adv > 1 an isotropic wind is formed.\nBetween these two extremes, an inflated envelope transports the heat generated\nnear the binary to the surface by meridional flows. In all cases, the radiated\nluminosity reaches a fraction ~0.01 to 0.1 of Mdot v_orb^2/2, where Mdot is the\nmass outflow rate.

There are\nonly a hundred inclinations derived so far; in this context, can we be sure\nthat we measure the true orientation of AGN?

Recent\nterrestrial experiments constrain both its value and slope at nuclear\nsaturation density, however, its value at higher densities is unknown. Assuming\na Free Fermi-gas (FFG) model for the kinetic symmetry energy, the high-density\nextrapolation depends on a single parameter, the density dependence of the\npotential symmetry energy. The Correlated Fermi-gas (CFG) model improves on the\nFFG model by including the effects of short-range, correlated, high-momentum,\nnucleons in nuclear matter. Using the CFG model for the kinetic symmetry energy\nalong with constraints from terrestrial measurements leads to a much softer\ndensity dependence for the potential symmetry energy. Purpose: Examine the\nability of the FFG and CFG models to describe NS observables that are directly\nsensitive to the symmetry energy at high-density. Specifically, examine the\nability of the CFG model, with its softer density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy, to describe a two solar-mass NS. Methods: Using a Bayesian\nanalysis of NS observables we compare the CFG and FFG models and examine the\nresulting parameters in the NS EOS and the density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy. Results: Despite the large difference in the density\ndependence of the potential part of the symmetry energy, both models can\ndescribe the NS data and support a two solar-mass NS. The different density\ndependences has only a small effect on the NS EOS. Conclusions: While sensitive\nto the high-density values of the symmetry energy, NS observables alone are not\nenough to distinguish between the CFG and FFG models. This indicates that the\nNS EOS, obtain from Bayesian analysis of NS observables, is robust and is not\nsensitive to the exact nuclear model used for the kinetic symmetry energy. \n\n"}

As a result of the collision between the ejecta and the wind, a\ngeometrically thin shell surrounding a hot bubble forms and expands in the\nejecta. We use a self-similar solution to describe the early dynamical\nevolution of the shell and carry out a two-dimensional special relativistic\nhydrodynamic simulation to follow further evolution. The Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability inevitably develops at the contact surface separating the shocked\nwind and ejecta, leading to the complete destruction of the shell and the\nleakage of hot gas from the hot bubble.

The distinctive spectral states are not strongly\nrelated to observed luminosity and velocity, nor to SMBH mass estimates. We use\nexhaustive photoionization modelling to map the domain of fluxes and cloud\nproperties that yield (e.g.) a He-overbright state where a large\nHeII(4686A)/H$\\alpha$ line-ratio creates an illusion of helium enrichment.\nAlthough observed line ratios occur in a plausible minority of cases, AGN-like\nillumination can not reproduce the observed equivalent widths.

While many works favor such a change, there are\nalso several works claiming the opposite. In this paper, we gather from\nliterature a largest quiescent AGN (defined as $L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm Edd} <\n10^{-6}$) sample to date, consisting of $75$ sources. We find that these\nquiescent AGNs follow a $\\xi_{\\rm X}\\approx 1.23$ radio/X-ray relationship, in\nexcellent agreement with the Yuan \\& Cui prediction. The reason for the\ndiscrepancy between the present result and some previous works is that their\nsamples contain not only quiescent sources but also \"normal\" ones (i.e.,\n$L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm Edd} > 10^{-6}$).

On the precession\ntimescale, the angle between the total and orbital angular momenta oscillates\nwith nutation period $\\tau$, during which the orbital angular momentum\nprecesses about the total angular momentum by an angle $\\alpha$. This defines\ntwo distinct frequencies that vary on the radiation-reaction timescale: the\nnutation frequency $\\omega \\equiv 2\\pi/\\tau$ and the precession frequency\n$\\Omega \\equiv \\alpha/\\tau$. We use analytic solutions for generic spin\nprecession at 2PN order to derive Fourier series for the total and orbital\nangular momenta in which each term is a sinusoid with frequency $\\Omega -\nn\\omega$ for integer $n$. As black holes inspiral, they can pass through\nnutational resonances ($\\Omega = n\\omega$) at which the total angular momentum\ntilts.

Such dark matter not only features dissipative cooling\nprocesses, but is also assumed to have nontrivial heating sourced by ordinary\nsupernovae (facilitated by the kinetic mixing interaction). The dynamics of\ndissipative dark matter halos around rotationally supported galaxies,\ninfluenced by heating as well as cooling processes, can be modelled by fluid\nequations. For a sufficiently isolated galaxy with stable star formation rate,\nthe dissipative dark matter halos are expected to evolve to a steady state\nconfiguration which is in hydrostatic equilibrium and where heating and cooling\nrates locally balance. Here, we take into account the major cooling and heating\nprocesses, and numerically solve for the steady state solution under the\nassumptions of spherical symmetry, negligible dark magnetic fields, and that\nsupernova sourced energy is transported to the halo via dark radiation. For the\nparameters considered, and assumptions made, we were unable to find a\nphysically realistic solution for the constrained case of mirror dark matter\nhalos. Halo cooling generally exceeds heating at realistic halo mass densities.\nThis problem can be rectified in more generic dissipative dark matter models,\nand we discuss a specific example in some detail. \n\n"}

The fragment\npresents a bowshock-like shape with its anti-apex pointing to the center of the\nremnant.

This scenario is able to explain the recent measurements reported by\nAMS on the antiproton/proton ratio, that is found to be remarkably constant at\n~60-450 GeV of kinetic energy.

This algorithm ensures manifest conservation of mass, energy,\nand momentum, and avoids imprinting 'preferred directions' on the ejecta. We\nshow that it is critical to incorporate both momentum and thermal energy of\nmechanical ejecta in a self-consistent manner, accounting for SNe cooling radii\nwhen they are not resolved. Using idealized simulations of single SN\nexplosions, we show that the FIRE-2 algorithm, independent of resolution,\nreproduces converged solutions in both energy and momentum.

The fluctuations diffuse through the disc and\nresult in local variability of the mass accretion rate, which modulates the\nX-ray flux from the inner disc in the case of black holes, or from the surface\nin the case of neutron stars. A key role in the theoretical explanation of fast\nvariability belongs to the description of the diffusion process. The\npropagation and evolution of the fluctuations is described by the diffusion\nequation, which can be solved by the method of Green functions. We implement\nGreen functions in order to accurately describe the propagation of fluctuations\nin the disc. For the first time we consider both forward and backward\npropagation.

One such set of universal relations between the moment of inertia $(I)$,\nthe tidal Love number and the quadrupole moment $(Q)$ has been studied both in\nGeneral Relativity and in modified theories. In this paper, we study the\nrelations in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a well-motivated, parity-violating\neffective field theory, extending previous work in various ways. First, we\nstudy how projected constraints on the theory using the I-Love relation depend\non the measurement accuracy of $I$ with radio observations and that of the Love\nnumber with gravitational-wave observations. Provided these quantities can be\nmeasured with future observations, we find that the latter could place bounds\non dynamical Chern-Simons gravity that are six orders of magnitude stronger\nthan current bounds.

Understanding\nthe radiation mechanism for FRBs should provide the missing insights regarding\ntheir progenitors, which is investigated in this paper.

The GeV flux variation is accompanied by the spectral variation\ncharacterized as flux-tracking, i.e., \"harder when brighter\". The GeV flux is\ncorrelated with the optical and X-ray fluxes, and a weak correlation between\ngamma-ray flux and radio flux is also observed. The gamma-ray flux is not\ncorrelated with the optical linear polarization degree for the global\nlightcurves, but they show a correlation for the lightcurves before MJD 56000.\nThe power density spectrum of the global lightcurve shows an obvious turnover\nat ~7.7 days, which may indicate a typical variability timescale of 3C 454.3 in\nthe gamma-ray band.

We explore the effect\nof misaligning the pre-collapse magnetic field with respect to the rotation\naxis by performing four simulations: one aligned model and models with 15, 30,\nand 45 degree misalignments.

We track the thermodynamic properties of the ejected\nmaterial with Lagrangian tracer particles and analyse its composition with the\nnuclear reaction network SkyNet. By using different neutrino luminosities in\npost-processing the tracer data with SkyNet, we constrain the impact of\nuncertainties in neutrino luminosities. We find that, for the aligned model\nconsidered here, the use of an approximate leakage scheme results in neutrino\nluminosity uncertainties corresponding to a factor of 100-1000 uncertainty in\nthe abundance of third peak $r$-process elements.

Unexpected discoveries, such as the\ndiphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the\nconstruction of a photon collider. In order to enable the gamma-gamma collision\noption, the ILC design should be compatible with it from the very beginning. In\nthis paper, we discuss the problem of the beam crossing angle. In the ILC\ntechnical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough\nspace for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions,\nthe crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result\nfrom multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with\nthe opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector\nfield. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.\nIn this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as\nwell as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable\nreduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity.

Because wind acceleration makes the\nwind velocities near the progenitors low, the density of the immediate vicinity\nof the red supergiant supernova progenitors can be higher than that\nextrapolated by using a constant terminal wind velocity. Therefore, even if the\nmass-loss rate of the progenitor is relatively low, it can have a dense\ncircumstellar medium at the immediate stellar vicinity and the early light\ncurves of Type IIP supernovae are significantly affected by it.

However, the expected properties and distribution of such events is\nnot well understood. Here we characterize the rates of such events, their delay\ntime distribution, their progenitors and the distribution of their properties.\nWe use binary populations synthesis models and consider a wide range of initial\nconditions and physical processes.

The\nfrequencies can be offset from the spin frequency of the NS by several Hz, and\ncan drift by 1-3 Hz. One possible explanation is a mode in the bursting ocean,\nthe frequency of which would decrease (in the rotating frame) as the burst\ncools, hence explaining the drifts. Most burst oscillations have been observed\nduring H/He triggered bursts, however there has been one observation of\noscillations during a superburst; hours' long Type I X-ray bursts caused by\nunstable carbon burning deeper in the ocean.

A\nparameter which is common to and plays a key role in both the GW and the EM\nanalyses is the viewing angle of the binary's orbit. If a binary is viewed from\ndifferent angles, the amount of GW energy changes (implying that orientation\nand distance are correlated) and the EM signatures can vary, depending on the\nstructure of the emission. Information about the viewing angle of the binary\norbital plane is therefore crucial to the interpretation of both the GW and the\nEM data, and can potentially be extracted from either side.\n  In the first part of this study, we present a systematic analysis of how well\nthe viewing angle of binary neutron stars can be measured from the GW data. We\nshow that if the sky position and the redshift of the binary can be identified\nvia the EM counterpart and an associated host galaxy, then for 50$\\%$ of the\nsystems the viewing angle can be constrained to $\\leq 7^{\\circ}$ uncertainty\nfrom the GW data, independent of electromagnetic emission models.

We investigate whether particles accelerated during high-power episodes\naround the Galactic center can account for a significant fraction of the\nobserved GCRs, or conversely what constraints can be derived regarding their\nGalactic transport if their contributions are negligible.\n  Methods. We address these questions by studying the contribution of a\ncontinuous source of energetic particles at the Galactic center to the local\nGCRs.

I start from long-term evolution (on the timescale when\ninstability significantly changes the spin frequency). For this case, I reduce\nevolution equations to one differential equation and demonstrate that it can be\ndirectly derived from energy conservation law. This equation governs evolution\nrate through sequence of thermally equilibrium states and provides linear\ncoupling for the cooling power and rotation energy losses via gravitational\nwave emission. In particular, it shows that differential rotation do not affect\nlong-term spin-down. On the contrary, on the short timescales, differential\nrotation can significantly modify the apparent spin-down, if one examines a\nstrongly unstable star with very small initial amplitude of unstable mode. This\nstatement is confirmed by consideration of Newtonian non-magnetized perfect\nfluid and dissipative stellar models as well as magnetized stellar model.

Two processes that are commonly considered (e.g., for sub-grid\nprescriptions) are Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion and the Eddington limit. A\nthird one is AGN wind feedback. It has been long suggested that such a wind\nfeedback regulates the final SMBH mass, however, it has been shown recently\nthat AGN winds can also regulate the average accretion rate at a level\nconsistent with observations of high redshift AGNs. In this paper we study the\neffect of wind feedback on the accretion rate using 2D, high resolution\nhydrodynamic simulations, that incorporate a self-consistent wind injection\nscheme and resolves the SMBH sphere of influence. Two different cases are\nexplored and compared: one in which the initial gas density is uniform, and one\nin which it has an isothermal sphere profile. We also compare simulations with\nand without cooling. Our main finding is that for reasonable parameters, AGN\nfeedback always limits the accretion rate to be far below the\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton limit. For typical wind parameters and a uniform ISM\ndensities of the order $1 {cm}^{-3}$, the accretion rate is found to be several\norders of magnitudes smaller than that inferred in large samples of high\nredshift AGNs. On the other hand, the accretion rate obtained for initially\nisothermal density profile is found to be consistent with the observations,\nparticularly when cooling is included. Furthermore, it roughly scales as\n$\\sigma^{5}$ with the velocity dispersion of the bulge, in accord with the\n$M-\\sigma$ relation. \n\n"}

The LGRB host distributions can be\nreconciled with the ones expected from galaxy surveys by imposing a metallicity\nupper limit of 12+logOH ~ 8.55. Metallicity rules the LGRB production\nefficiency, which is stifled at Z > 0.7 Zsun. Under this hypothesis we can\nexpect LGRBs to trace star formation at z > 3, once the bulk of the star\nforming galaxy population are characterised by metallicities below this limit.\nThe moderately high metallicity threshold found is in agreement with the\nconditions necessary to rapidly produce a fast-rotating Wolf-Rayet star a in\nclose binary system, and could be accommodated by single star models under\nchemically homogeneous mixing with very rapid rotation and weak magnetic\ncoupling. \n\n"}

Stability and\n  dynamics Abstract: In some Seyfert Galaxies, the hard X-rays that produce fluorescent emission\nlines are thought to be generated in a hot corona that is compact and located\nat only a few gravitational radii above the supermassive black hole. We\nconsider the possibility that this X-ray source may be powered by small scale\nmagnetic flux tubes attached to the accretion disk near the black hole. We use\nthree dimensional, time dependent force-free simulations in a simplified\nsetting to study the dynamics of such flux tubes as they get continuously\ntwisted by the central compact star/black hole. We find that, the dynamical\nevolution of the flux tubes connecting the central compact object and the\naccretion disk is strongly influenced by the confinement of the surrounding\nfield. Although differential rotation between the central object and the disk\ntends to inflate the flux tubes, strong confinement from surrounding field\nquenches the formation of a jet-like outflow, as the inflated flux tube becomes\nkink unstable and dissipates most of the extracted rotational energy relatively\nclose to the central object. Such a process may be able to heat up the plasma\nand produce strong X-ray emission. We estimate the energy dissipation rate and\ndiscuss its astrophysical implications. \n\n"}

Abstract: The main hard pulse of prompt gamma-ray emission in GRB$\\,$170817A had a\nduration of $\\sim0.5\\,{\\rm s}$ and its onset was delayed with respect to the\ngravitational-wave chirp signal by $t_{\\rm del} \\approx 1.74\\,{\\rm s}$.\nDetailed follow-up of the subsequent broadband kilonova emission revealed a\ntwo-component ejecta -- a lanthanide-poor ejecta with mass $M_{\\rm\nej,blue}\\approx0.025\\,M_\\odot$ that powered the early but rapidly fading blue\nemission and a lanthanide-rich ejecta with mass $M_{\\rm ej,red}\\approx\n0.04\\,M_\\odot$ that powered the longer lasting redder emission. Both the prompt\ngamma-ray onset delay and the existence of the blue ejecta with modest electron\nfraction, $0.2\\lesssim Y_e\\lesssim0.3$, can be explained if the collapse to a\nblack hole was delayed by the formation of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS).\nHere, we determine the survival time of the merger remnant by combining two\ndifferent constraints, namely, the time needed to produce the requisite\nblue-ejecta mass and that necessary for the relativistic jet to bore its way\nout of the expanding ejecta. In this way, we determine that the remnant of\nGW170817 must have collapsed to a black hole after $t_{\\rm\ncoll}=0.98_{-0.26}^{+0.31}\\,{\\rm s}$. We also discuss how future detections and\nthe delays between the gravitational and electromagnetic emissions can be used\nto constrain the properties of the merged object. \n\n"}

While the observed\nradio emission is consistent with the star formation rate inferred from\ninfrared observations, a significantly higher cosmic ray population is\nnecessary to accurately model the measured gamma-ray flux. To resolve this\ndiscrepancy between the radio and gamma-ray observations, we find that we must\nincrease the cosmic ray energy injection rate and account for an infrared\noptical depth greater than unity.

These are the first observations of a very young (<1 Myr) stellar\nobject in a band encompassing simultaneously both soft and hard X-rays. In\naddition to the hot Fe complex at 6.7 keV, we observed fluorescent emission\nfrom Fe at $\\sim6.4$ keV, confirming the previous findings. The line at 6.4 keV\nis detected during quiescent and flaring states and its flux is variable. The\nequivalent width is found varying in the $\\approx 0.15--0.5$ keV range. These\nvalues make unrealistic a simple model with a centrally illuminated disk and\nsuggest a role of the cavity containing Elias 29 and possibly reverberation\nprocesses that could occur in it. We observed two flares, with duration of 20\nks and 50 ks, respectively. We systematically observed an increase of $N_H$\nduring the flares of a factor five. This behavior has been observed during\nflares previously detected in Elias 29 with XMM-Newton and ASCA. The phenomenon\nhints that the flaring regions could be buried under the accretion streams and\nat high stellar latitudes, as the X-rays from flares pass through gas denser\nthan the gas along the line of sight of the quiescent corona. In a different\nscenario, a contribution from scattered soft photons to the primary coronal\nemission could mimic a shallower $N_H$ in the quiescent spectrum. In the\nspectrum of the full NuSTAR exposure, we detect hard X-ray emission in the band\n$\\approx20-80$ keV in excess with respect to the thermal emission. The hard\nX-ray emission could be due to a population of energetic electrons accelerated\nby the magnetic field along the accretion streams. These particles could concur\nto pumping up the Fe fluorescence of cold Fe of the disk along with X-ray\nphotons with $E>7.11$ keV. \n\n"}

We employ a simplified 2D model in ${\\bf k}$-space to study the\nevolution of the electric-field spectrum and to calculate the relaxation time\nof the beam. We demonstrate that the 2D model is an adequate representation of\nthe 3D physics. We find that non-linear Landau damping, once it operates\nefficiently, transports essentially the entire wave energy to small wavenumbers\nwhere wave driving is weak or absent. The relaxation time also strongly depends\non the IGM temperature, $T_\\mathrm{IGM}$, and for $T_\\mathrm{IGM}\\ll10$ eV, and\nin the absence of any other damping mechanism, the relaxation time of the pair\nbeam is longer than the inverse Compton (IC) scattering time. The weak\nlate-time beam energy losses arise from the accumulation of wave energy at\nsmall $k$, that non-linearly drains the wave energy at the resonant\n$\\mathbf{k}$ of the pair-beam instability. Any other dissipation process\noperating at small $k$ would reduce that wave-energy drain and hence lead to\nstronger pair-beam energy losses. As an example, collisions reduce the\nrelaxation time by an order of magnitude, although their rate is very small.\nOther non-linear processes, such as the modulation instability, could provide\nadditional damping of the non-resonant waves and dramatically reduce the\nrelaxation time of the pair beam. An accurate description of the spectral\nevolution of the electrostatic waves is crucial for calculating the relaxation\ntime of the pair beam. \n\n"}

It is\ntherefore interesting to explore whether short duration events also have ejecta\npowered by radioactivity (i.e. that are supernova-like).
