We vary only\nthe jet's input power between P_{jet} = 10^{41}-10^{47} {\\rm erg/sec}. The\ndensity Probability Distribution Function (PDF) within the cocoon can be\ndescribed in terms of two distinct components, which are also spatially\ndistinct: a low- and a high-density component. The PDF of the post-shocked\nregion is well approximated by a modified lognormal distribution, for all\nvalues of $P_{jet}$. During the active phase, when the jet is fed by the AGN,\nthe cloud is subject both to compression and stripping, which tend to increase\nits density and diminish its total mass. When the jet is switched off (i.e.\nduring the passive phase) the shocked cloud cools further and tends to become\nmore filamentary, under the action of a back-flow which develops within the\ncocoon. We study the evolution of the star formation rate within the cloud,\nassuming that is determined by a Schmidt-Kennicutt law, and we analyze the\ndifferent physical factors which have an impact on the star formation rate.

This photometric catalog contains\nmore than 25,000 matched SDSS and 2MASS point sources spanning ~30 square\ndegrees on the sky. We have obtained follow-up spectroscopy, complete to J=16,\nof more than 500 low mass dwarf candidates within a 1 square degree sub-sample,\nand thousands of additional dwarf candidates in the remaining 29 square\ndegrees.

Our results, based upon a new CCF\nmethodology for determining the time-resolved spectral lag, are summarized as\nfollows. First, the evolution in the arrival offset of prompt gamma-ray photon\ncounts between Swift-BAT 15-25 keV and 50-100 keV energy bands (intrinsic\ngamma-ray spectral lag) appears to be anti-correlated with the arrival offset\nbetween prompt 15-350 keV gamma-rays and the optical emission observed by\nTORTORA (extrinsic optical/gamma-ray spectral lag), thus effectively\npartitioning the burst into two main episodes at ~T+28+/-2 sec. Second, the\nrise and decline of prompt optical emission at ~T+10+/-1 sec and ~T+50+/-1 sec,\nrespectively, both coincide with discontinuities in the hard to soft evolution\nof the photon index for a power law fit to 15-150 keV Swift-BAT data at\n~T+8+/-2 sec and ~T+48+/-1 sec. These spectral energy changes also coincide\nwith intervals whose time-resolved spectral lag values are consistent with\nzero, at ~T+12+/-2 sec and ~T+50+/-2 sec. These results, which are robust\nacross heuristic permutations of Swift-BAT energy channels and varying temporal\nbin resolution, have also been corroborated via independent analysis of\nKonus-Wind data. This potential discovery may provide the first observational\nevidence for an implicit connection between spectral lags and GRB emission\nmechanisms in the context of canonical fireball phenomenology.

Twenty-one horizontal branch stars\n(out of which 5 EHBs) in NGC5986 and 31 in M80 (11 EHBs) were observed during\nfour consecutive nights. We measured radial velocity variations, temperatures,\ngravities, and helium abundances. By means of a statistical analysis, we\ndetected one EHB close binary candidate per cluster. In M80, the best estimate\nof the close binary EHB fraction is f=12%, and even the lowest estimate of the\nbinary fraction among field sdB stars can be ruled out within a 90% confidence\nlevel. Because of the small observed sample, no strong conclusions can be drawn\non the close EHB binary fraction for NGC5986, although our best estimate is\nrather low (f=25%). For the discrepancy in spectroscopic derived masses with\ntheoretical models observed in NGC6752, our analysis of M80 EHB stars shows a\nsimilar trend.

Second-order magnetic field\nstatistics like the power spectrum cannot always distinguish between magnetic\nfields with essentially different spatial structure. Synchrotron polarimetry\nnaturally allows certain 4th-order magnetic field statistics to be inferred\nfrom observational data, which lifts this degeneracy and can thereby help us\ngain a better picture of the structure of the cosmic fields and test\ntheoretical scenarios describing magnetic turbulence. In this work we show that\na 4th-order correlator of physical interest, the tension-force spectrum, can be\nrecovered from the polarized synchrotron emission data. We develop an estimator\nfor this quantity based on polarized-emission observations in the\nFaraday-rotation-free frequency regime.

We focus here on a reflection-based\ninterpretation which interprets both features, as well as the large soft\nexcess, in terms of partially ionized reflection off the inner accretion disc.\nWe show that the two peculiar spectral features mentioned above can be\nreproduced by two relativistic emission lines due to Fe K and Fe L. The lines\nare produced in the inner accretion disc and independently yield consistent\ndisc parameters. We argue that the high L/K intensity ratio is broadly\nconsistent with expectations from an ionized accretion disc reflection,\nindicating that they belong to a single ionized reflection component. The\nspectral shape, X-ray flux, and variability properties are very similar in the\nXMM-Newton and Suzaku observations, performed about 5 years apart. The overall\nX-ray spectrum and variability can be described by a simple two-component model\ncomprising a steep power law continuum plus its ionised reflection off the\ninner accretion disc. In this model, a rapidly rotating Kerr black hole and a\nsteep emissivity profile are required to describe the data. The simultaneous\ndetection of broad relativistic Fe L and K lines in IRAS 13224-3809 follows\nthat in another extreme NLS1 galaxy, 1H0707-495. Although the data quality for\nIRAS13224-3809 does not allow us to rule out competing models as in 1H0707-495,\nwe show here that our reflection-based interpretation describes in a\nself-consistent manner the available data and points towards IRAS13224-3809\nbeing a very close relative of 1H0707-495 in terms of both spectral and\nvariability properties. \n\n"}

Such an additional scalar degree of freedom is called \"Galileon\". The\nbasic idea is inspired by the DGP braneworld, but one can construct a\nghost-free model that admits a self-accelerating solution. We perform a fully\nrelativistic analysis of linear perturbations in Galileon cosmology. Although\nthe Galileon model can mimic the background evolution of standard $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology, the behavior of perturbation is quite different. It is shown that\nthere exists a super-horizon growing mode in the metric and Galileon\nperturbations at early times, suggesting that the background is unstable. A\nfine-tuning of the initial condition for the Galileon fluctuation is thus\nrequired in order to promote a desirable evolution of perturbations at early\ntimes.

We\nassess ejection probabilities for mergers occurring in a gas-poor environment,\nwhere the MBH binary coalescence is driven by stellar dynamical processes, and\nthe spin/orbit configuration is expected to be isotropically distributed. We\ncontrast this case with the 'aligned' case. The latter is the most realistic\nsituation for 'wet', gas-rich mergers, which are the expectation for\nhigh-redshift galaxies.

Previous attempts which assumed\nnon-minimal coupling to gravity failed due to a tachyonic instability of the\nsinglet field during inflation. A canonical K\\\"{a}hler potential with\n\\textit{minimal coupling} to gravity can resolve the tachyonic instability but\nruns into the $\\eta$-problem. We suggest a model which is free of the\n$\\eta$-problem due to an additional coupling in the K\\\"{a}hler potential which\nis allowed by the Standard Model gauge group. This induces directions in the\npotential which we call K-flat. For a certain value of the new coupling in the\n(N)MSSM, the K\\\"{a}hler potential is special, because it can be associated with\na certain shift symmetry for the Higgs doublets, a generalization of the shift\nsymmetry for singlets in earlier models.

We found that alterations of the initial\nconditions consistently modify both the cumulative and the differential\nskeleton length, although the effect is generically smaller than the cosmic\nvariance and depends on the smoothing of the map prior to the skeleton\ncomputation. Nevertheless, the qualitative shape of these deviations is rather\nsimilar to their primordial counterparts, implying that skeleton statistics\nretain good memory of the initial conditions. We performed a statistical\nanalysis in order to find out at what Confidence Level primordial\nnon-Gaussianity could be constrained by the skeleton test on cosmic shear maps\nof the size we adopted. At 68.3% Confidence Level we found an error on the\nmeasured level of primordial non-Gaussianity of $\\Delta f_\\mathrm{NL}\\sim 300$,\nwhile at 90% Confidence Level it is of $\\Delta f_\\mathrm{NL}\\sim 500$.

A cosmological magnetic\nfield present prior to recombination would produce substantial matter\nclustering at intermediate/small scales, on top of the standard inflationary\npower spectrum.

Time-resolved photometric and spectroscopic observations were obtained\nto analyze the behavior of the system between superoutbursts. A geometric model\nof a binary system containing a disk with two outer annuli spiral density waves\nwas applied to explain the light curve and the Doppler tomography. Observations\nwere carried out during 2008-2009, after the object's magnitude decreased to\nV~17.7(0.1) from the March 2006 eruption. The light curve clearly shows a\nsinusoid-like variability with a 0.07 mag amplitude and a 42.48 min\nperiodicity, which is half of the orbital period of the system. In Sept. 2010,\nthe system underwent yet another superoutburst and returned to its quiescent\nlevel by the beginning of 2012. This light curve once again showed a\ndouble-humps, but with a significantly smaller ~0.01mag amplitude. Other types\nof variability like a \"mini-outburst\" or SDSS1238-like features were not\ndetected. Doppler tomograms, obtained from spectroscopic data during the same\nperiod of time, show a large accretion disk with uneven brightness, implying\nthe presence of spiral waves. We constructed a geometric model of a bounce-back\nsystem containing two spiral density waves in the outer annuli of the disk to\nreproduce the observed light curves. The Doppler tomograms and the\ndouble-hump-shape light curves in quiescence can be explained by a model system\ncontaining a massive >0.7Msun white dwarf with a surface temperature of\n~12000K, a late-type brown dwarf, and an accretion disk with two outer annuli\nspirals.

As such, they should follow the star formation rate (SFR) of\ngalaxies. We can use them to probe for star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the\ndistant universe following this assumption. The relation between the rate of\nLGRBs in a given galaxy and its SFR (that we call the LGRB \"bias\") may be\ncomplex, as we have indications that the LGRB hosts are not perfect analogues\nto the general population of SFGs. In this work, we try to quantify the\ndependence of the LGRB bias on physical parameters of their host galaxy such as\nthe SFR or the stellar mass. We propose an empirical method based on the\ncomparison of stellar mass functions (and SFR distributions) of LGRB hosts and\nof SFGs in order to find how the bias depends on the stellar mass or the SFR.\nBy applying this method to a sample of LGRB hosts at redshifts lower than 1.1,\nwhere the properties of SFGs are well established, and where the properties of\nLGRB host galaxies can be deduced from observations (for stellar masses larger\nthan 10**9.25 Msun and SFR larger than 1.8 Msun / yr), we find that the LGRB\nbias depends on both the stellar mass and SFR. We find that the bias decreases\nwith the SFR, i.e. we see no preference for highly SFGs, once taken into\naccount the larger number of massive stars in galaxies with larger SFR. We do\nnot find any trend with the specific star formation rate (SSFR) but the\ndynamical range in SSFR in our study is narrow. Although through an indirect\nmethod, we relate these trends to a possible decrease of the LGRBs rate / SFR\nratio with the metallicity. The method we propose suggests trends that may be\nuseful to constrain models of LGRB progenitors, showing a clear decrease of the\nLGRB bias with the metallicity. This is promising for the future as the number\nof LGRB hosts studied will increase. \n\n"}

Likewise, the analogous\ninteraction of an axion field with the axial-vector current generated by a\nnucleon can give rise to time-dependent mixing of opposite-parity states in\nnuclear systems. This mixing can induce oscillating electric dipole moments,\noscillating parity non-conservation effects and oscillating anapole moments in\nsuch systems. By adjusting the energy separation between the opposite-parity\nstates of interest to match the axion mass energy, axion-induced experimental\nobservables can be enhanced by many orders of magnitude.

Since anti-deuterons have been shown to\noffer a distinctive DM signal, with potentially good prospects of detection in\nlarge portions of the DM-particle parameter space, we explore here the\nproduction of heavier anti-nuclei, specifically anti-helium. Even more than for\nanti-deuterons, the DM-produced anti-He flux can be mostly prominent over the\nastrophysical anti-He background at low kinetic energies, typically below 3-5\nGeV/n. However, the larger number of anti-nucleons involved in the formation\nprocess makes the anti-He flux extremely small. We therefore explore, for a few\nDM benchmark cases, whether the yield is sufficient to allow for anti-He\ndetection in current-generation experiments, such as AMS-02. We account for the\nuncertainties due to the propagation in the Galaxy and to the uncertain details\nof the coalescence process, and we consider the constraints already imposed by\nanti-proton searches.

The relative displacement between\nthe interfering wave packets in such open interferometers leads to a fringe\npattern in the density profile at each exit port and a loss of contrast in the\noscillations of the integrated particle number as a function of the phase\nshift. Paying particular attention to gravity gradients, we present a simple\nmitigation strategy involving small changes in the timing of the laser pulses\nwhich is very easy to implement.

While the EOS is still poorly known, there are\nalso longstanding ambiguities in choosing General Relativity or alternative\ngravity theories in the not-so-well tested strong-field regime. Besides\npossible appearance of hyperons and new phases, the most uncertain part of the\nnucleonic EOS is currently the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy.\nTo provide information that may help break the EOS-gravity degeneracy, we\ninvestigate effects of symmetry energy within its uncertain range determined by\nterrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments on the gravitational binding energy\nand spacetime curvature of neutron stars within GR and the scalar-tensor (ST)\ntheory of gravity. In particular, we focus on effects of the following\nparameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter: (1) the\nincompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter, (2) the slope $L$ of\nsymmetry energy at saturation density and (3) the high-density behavior of\nsymmetry energy.

Accurate covariance\nestimates are an essential step for the validation of galaxy clustering models\nof the redshift-space two-point statistics. Usually, only a limited set of\naccurate N-body simulations is available. Thus, assessing the data covariance\nis not possible or only leads to a noisy estimate. Further, relying on\nsimulated realisations of the survey data means that tests of the cosmology\ndependence of the covariance are expensive. With these points in mind, this\nwork presents a simple theoretical model for the linear covariance of\nanisotropic galaxy clustering observations with synthetic catalogues.\nConsidering the Legendre moments (`multipoles') of the two-point statistics and\nprojections into wide bins of the line-of-sight parameter (`clustering\nwedges'), we describe the modelling of the covariance for these anisotropic\nclustering measurements for galaxy samples with a trivial geometry in the case\nof a Gaussian approximation of the clustering likelihood. As main result of\nthis paper, we give the explicit formulae for Fourier and configuration space\ncovariance matrices.

Therefore, an accurate numerical simulation of these phenomena is\nmandatory to correctly model and understand many astrophysical events, such as\nSupernovas, stellar collisions, or planetary formation. In this work, we\nattempt to address many of the problems that the smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) technique has when dealing with subsonic hydrodynamical\ninstabilities or shocks. To that aim we built a new SPH code named SPHYNX, that\nincludes many of the recent advances in the SPH technique and some other new\nones, which we present here. SPHYNX is of Newtonian type and grounded in the\nEuler-Lagrange formulation of the SPH technique. Its distinctive features are:\nthe use of an integral approach to estimating the gradients; the use of a\nflexible family of interpolators called sinc kernels, which suppress pairing\ninstability; and the incorporation of a new type of volume element which\nprovides a better partition of the unity. Unlike other modern formulations,\nwhich consider volume elements linked to pressure, our volume element choice\nrelies on density. SPHYNX conserves mass, linear and angular momentum, energy,\nentropy, and preserves kernel normalization even in strong shocks. The coupling\nbetween the integral approach to calculate gradients and the new family of\nvolume elements reduces the so-called tensile instability. Both features help\nto suppress the damp which often prevents the growth of hydrodynamic\ninstabilities in regular SPH codes. On the whole, SPHYNX has passed the\nverification tests described below. For identical particle setting and initial\nconditions the results were similar (or better in some particular cases) than\nthose obtained with other SPH schemes such as GADGET-2, PSPH or with the recent\ndensity-independent formulation (DISPH) and conservative reproducing kernel\n(CRKSPH) techniques. \n\n"}

We allow for repulsive self-interaction.\nIn a Lambda-SFDM universe, SFDM starts relativistic, evolving from stiff (w=1)\nto radiation-like (w=1/3), becoming nonrelativistic (w=0) at late times. Thus,\na stiff-SFDM-dominated era precedes the familiar radiation-dominated era. SFDM\nparticle mass $m$ and quartic self-interaction strength \\lambda, are therefore\nconstrained by cosmological observables, N_{eff}, the effective number of\nneutrino species during BBN, and z_{eq}, the matter-radiation equality\nredshift. Since the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from\ninflation is amplified during the stiff-SFDM-dominated era, it can also\ncontribute a radiationlike component large enough to affect these observables.\nRemarkably, this amplification makes this SGWB detectable by current GW\nexperiments, e.g., aLIGO/Virgo and LISA, for Lambda-SFDM models satisfying\ncosmological constraints, for a range of reheat temperatures T_{re} and\ncurrently allowed values of tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$.

The newly\nintroduced fields share an odd charge under a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ parity symmetry.\nThis model, commonly known as \"Scotogenic\", was designed to provide a mechanism\nfor active neutrino mass generation as well as a viable dark matter candidate.\nIn this paper we consider a scenario in which the dark matter particle is at\nthe keV-scale. Such particle is free from X-ray limits due to the unbroken\nparity symmetry that forbids the mixing between active and right-handed\nneutrinos. The active neutrino masses are radiatively generated from the new\nscalars and the two heavier right-handed states with $\\sim \\mathcal{O}(100)$\nGeV masses. These heavy fermions can produce the observed baryon asymmetry of\nthe Universe through the combination of Akhmedov-Rubakov-Smirnov mechanism and\nrecently proposed scalar decays.

The extraction of the neutrino mass\nordering is a data-driven field expected to evolve very rapidly in the next\ndecade. In this review, we both analyze the present status and describe the\nphysics of subsequent prospects. Firstly, the different current available tools\nto measure the neutrino mass ordering are described. Namely, reactor,\nlong-baseline (accelerator and atmospheric) neutrino beams, laboratory searches\nfor beta and neutrinoless double beta decays and observations of the cosmic\nbackground radiation and the large scale structure of the universe are\ncarefully reviewed.

In this work, we implemented a time-dependent 1D\nmodel to follow the long-term evolution of the coupled binary + discs system,\nfrom a separation of 10^5 down to 20 Schwarzschild radii. We run different\nmodels changing the system parameters, including the binary mass ratio q \\leq\n0.3 and a factor {\\gamma} that controls the inflow across the gap created by\nthe secondary. We find that our implementation yields higher residual masses\nand longer binary residence times than previous studies. Our main conclusion is\nthe non-steady-state nature of the evolution of the system: the properties the\ndisc had when the binary was still at large separations influence its whole\nevolution. To recover steady state, the binary residence time would have to be\nmuch longer than the inflow time-scale of the disc throughout their entire\nhistory, which in general is not satisfied. \n\n"}

The SO2 and H2S emissions are enhanced around the\ncentrifugal barrier, and also trace the outer part of the disk.

Although the\nthreshold cannot at present be accurately determined (or even quantified)\nobservationally, it is clearly higher for bright Z sources than for faint atoll\nsources. Here we propose that the observational manifestation of kHz QPOs {\\em\nrequires} direct interaction between the neutron star magnetosphere and the\nKeplerian accretion disk and that the cessation of kHz QPOs at high accretion\nrate is due to the lack of such an interact when the Keplerian disk terminates\nat the last stable orbit and yet the magnetosphere is pushed farther inward.\nThe threshold is therefore dependent of the magnetic field strength -- the\nstronger the magnetic field the higher the threshold. This is certainly in\nagreement with the atoll/Z paradigm, but we argue that it is also generally\ntrue, even for individual sources within each (atoll or Z) category. For atoll\nsources, the kHz QPOs also seem to vanish at low accretion rate.

For the same reason, the\nspecific heat of the CFL phase is also dominated by the Goldstone modes.\nNotwithstanding this, both the emissivity and the specific heat from the\nmassive modes remain rather small, because of their extremely small number\ndensities.

The supernova yield\npatterns of VMS are incompatible with the Fe-peak and r-process abundances in\nhalo stars. Models including Type II supernovae and/or ``hypernovae'' from\nmetal-free progenitors with 8 - 40 Msun can better explain the observed trends.\nWith a simple metal-transport model, we estimate that halo enrichment curtails\nmetal-free star formation after ~10^8 yr at z ~ 20. Because the ionizing photon\nefficiency of metal-free stars peaks at ~120 Msun and declines at higher mass,\nan IMF with a lower bound at M ~ 10 - 20 Msun and no VMS can maximize the\nionizing photon budget and still be consistent with the nucleosynthetic\nevidence.

Observations suggest that some neutron stars are born with magnetic\nfields of at least 10^15 G while theoretical considerations give an upper limit\nof 10^18 G for the protoneutron star magnetic fields.

As a result, the cooling rate can be\ngreatly reduced by magnetic fields of 10^16 G for typical conditions below the\nstalled shock and a nonuniform protoneutron star magnetic field (e.g., a dipole\nfield) can introduce a large angular dependence of the cooling rate.

We use modern cooling simulations to extract\ndistributions of NS masses required to reproduce those of the yet sparse data\nin the TA plane. By comparing the results with a mass distribution for young,\nnearby NSs from population synthesis we can sharpen two NS cooling problems.\nThe direct Urca (DU) problem consists in a narrowing of the NS population at\nthe mass value for which the DU process as the most effective cooling mechanism\nin the hadronic layer of the star can occur. The Vela mass problem is a\nbroadening of the population beyond the range of the typical mass window of 1.1\n- 1.5 M_sun. Applying this tool to modern EoS we discuss examples for pure\nhadronic stars which are in conflict with these constraints while hybrid stars\nwith a color superconducting quark matter core can predict a satisfactory mass\ndistribution, provided the smallest diquark pairing gap has a properly defined\ndensity dependence. \n\n"}

We will show that if there is a persistent, non-dissipating\ncurrent running along the magnetic flux tubes, the force between magnetic flux\ntubes may be attractive, resulting in a type-I, rather than a type-II,\nsuperconductor. If this is the case, the conflict between the observed\nprecession and the canonical estimation of the Landau-Ginzburg parameter (which\nsuggests type II behaviour) will be automatically resolved. Such a current\narises in some condensed matter systems and may also appear in QCD dense matter\nas a consequence of quantum anomalies. We calculate the interaction between two\nvortices carrying a current j and find a constraint on the magnitude of j where\na superconductor is always type-I, even when the cannonical Landau-Ginzburg\nparameter indicates type-II behaviour. If this condition is met, the magnetic\nfield is expelled from the superconducting regions of the neutron star leading\nto the formation of the intermediate state where alternating domains of\nsuperconducting matter and normal matter coexist. We further argue that even\nwhen the induced current is small the vortex Abrikosov lattice will\nnevertheless be destroyed due to the helical instability studied previously in\nmany condensed matter systems. This would also resolve the apparent\ncontradiction with the precession of the neutron stars.

The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian marginalization\nallows the inclusion of valuable information, e.g. the redshift distributions\nor the galaxy type mix, which is often ignored by other methods. In those cases\nwhen the a priori information is insufficient, it is shown how to `calibrate'\nthe prior distributions, using even the data under consideration. There is an\nexcellent agreement between the 108 HDF spectroscopic redshifts and the\npredictions of the method, with a rms error Delta z/(1+z_spec) = 0.08 up to z<6\nand no systematic biases nor outliers. The reliability of the method is further\ntested by restricting the color information to the UBVI filters.

A\nproposed explanation for this remarkable fact is that gravitational radiation\nfrom a steady-state r-mode oscillation in the neutron star's core halts the\nspin-up due to accretion. For the neutron star transients, balancing the\ntime-averaged accretion torque with gravitational wave emission from\nsteady-state, constant amplitude r-mode pulsations implies a quiescent\nluminosity too bright to be consistent with observations (in particular of Aql\nX-1). The viscous dissipation (roughly 10 MeV per accreted nucleon for a spin\nof 300 Hz) from such an r-mode makes the core sufficiently hot to power a\nthermal luminosity of order 1e34 erg/s when accretion halts. This is the\nminimum quiescent luminosity that the neutron star must emit when viscous\nheating in the core is balanced by radiative cooling from the surface, as is\nthe case when the core of the star is superfluid. We therefore conclude that\neither the accretion torque is much less than (dM/dt)(GMR)^{1/2}, or that a\nsteady-state r-mode does not limit the spin rate of the neutron star\ntransients. Future observations with AXAF and XMM promise to further constrain\nthe amount of viscous dissipation in the neutron star core. \n\n"}

The orbits of the\ninspiraling COs are highly complicated; they can remain rather eccentric up\nuntil the final plunge, and display extreme versions of relativistic perihelion\nprecession and Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital plane. The strongest\ncapture signals will be ~10 times weaker than LISA's instrumental noise, but in\nprinciple (with sufficient computing power) they can be disentangled from the\nnoise by matched filtering. The associated template waveforms are not yet in\nhand, but theorists will very likely be able to provide them before LISA\nlaunches. Here we introduce a family of approximate (post-Newtonian) capture\nwaveforms, given in (nearly) analytic form, for use in advancing LISA studies\nuntil more accurate versions are available. Our model waveforms include most of\nthe key qualitative features of true waveforms, and cover the full space of\ncapture-event parameters (including orbital eccentricity and the MBH's spin).\nHere we use our approximate waveforms to (i) estimate the relative\ncontributions of different harmonics (of the orbital frequency) to the total\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and (ii) estimate the accuracy with which LISA will be\nable to extract the physical parameters of the capture event from the measured\nwaveform.

Parity violation in a\nstrong magnetic field could lead to an asymmetry in the neutrino radiation and\nrecoil of the newly formed neutron star. Charge conjugation violation in the\nneutrino-nucleon interaction reduces the ratio of neutrons to protons in the\nneutrino driven wind above the neutron star. This is a problem for r-process\nnucleosynthesis in this wind. On earth, parity violation is an excellent probe\nof neutrons because the weak charge of a neutron is much larger than that of a\nproton. The Parity Radius Experiment (PREX) at Jefferson Laboratory aims to\nprecisely measure the neutron radius of $^{208}$Pb with parity violating\nelastic electron scattering. This has many implications for astrophysics,\nincluding the structure of neutron stars, and for atomic parity nonconservation\nexperiments.} \n\n"}

We study the impact of those effects on predictive\nstellar evolution simulations for detached double-lined eclipsing binaries. We\nfollow the evolution of binary systems (pre-main sequence or main sequence\nstars) with precisely determined radii and masses from 1.1Mo to 23Mo (from\ntheir birth until their present state). The results indicate that all the\ndiscrepancies between the screened and unscreened models (in terms of\nluminosity, stellar radius, and effective temperature) are within the\nobservational uncertainties. Moreover, no nucleosynthetic or compositional\nvariation was found due to screening corrections. Therefore all thermonuclear\nscreening effects on the charged-particle nuclear reactions that occur in the\nbinary stars considered in this work (from their birth until their present\nstate) can be totally disregarded.

It is found that\nthe in-medium NN cross sections are not only reduced but also have a different\nisospin dependence compared with the free-space ones. Because of the\nneutron-proton effective mass splitting the difference between nn and pp\nscattering cross sections increases with the increasing isospin asymmetry of\nthe medium. Within the transport model IBUU04, the in-medium NN cross sections\nare found to influence significantly the isospin transport in heavy-ion\nreactions. With the in-medium NN cross sections, a symmetry energy of\n$E_{sym}(\\rho)\\approx 31.6(\\rho /\\rho_{0})^{0.69}$ was found most acceptable\ncompared with both the MSU isospin diffusion data and the presently acceptable\nneutron-skin thickness in $^{208}$Pb.
