The\nmotivation for this (seemingly academic) endeavour is to take the background\nindependence intrinsic to Einstein gravity one step further, and to assure that\nboth the equations of motion and the way in which those equations of motion are\nderived are as self-consistent as possible. That is, solutions to the equations\nof motion of general relativity endow a three-space region with a physical and\ndistinguishing geometry in four-dimensional space-time. However, in order to\nderive these equations of motion one should first be able to choose a\nthree-space region without having any prior knowledge of its physically\nappropriate geometry. The expression of this choice process requires a\nthree-dimensional topological manifold Q, to which all considered three-space\nregions belong, and that generates an equation of motion whose solutions are q.\nThese solutions relate the effects of curvature to the source term through the\ntopology of Q and constitute Einstein gravity.

We explore one particular model\nfor dynamic dark energy; quintessence driven by a scalar dilaton field.

In the original article, the\nWKB approximation was used for the modes that are globally stationary. In a\nprevious article, we found that the WKB quantization rule together with a\nproper counting of the states, leads to a new expression of the scalar field\nentropy which is not proportional to the area of the horizon. The expression of\nthe entropy is logarithmically divergent in the brick wall cut-off parameter in\ncontrast to an inverse power divergence obtained earlier. In this article, we\nwill consider the entropy for a thin shell of matter field of a given thickness\nsurrounding the black hole horizon. The thickness is chosen to be large\ncompared with the Planck length and is of the order of the atomic scale. When\nexpressed in terms of a covariant cut-off parameter, the entropy of a thin\nshell of matter field of a given thickness and surrounding the horizon in the\nSchwarzschild black hole background is given by an expression proportional to\nthe area of the black hole horizon.

In this paper, we construct the actual twistor scattering\namplitudes themselves. We show that the recursion relations of Britto, Cachazo,\nFeng and Witten have a natural twistor formulation that, together with the\nthree-point seed amplitudes, allows us to recursively construct general tree\namplitudes in twistor space. We obtain explicit formulae for $n$-particle MHV\nand NMHV super-amplitudes, their CPT conjugates (whose representations are\ndistinct in our chiral framework), and the eight particle N^2MHV\nsuper-amplitude.

There the\ngravitational field is represented by a pair of variables: 1) a `contact\nvector' $V^A$ which is geometrically visualized as the contact point between\nthe spacetime manifold and a model spacetime being `rolled' on top of it, and\n2) a gauge connection $A_{\\mu}^{\\ph\\mu AB}$, taken to be valued in the Lie\nalgebra of SO(2,3) or SO(1,4), which mathematically determines how much the\nmodel spacetime is rotated when rolled.

First, using perturbative techniques, we compare\nthe massless and massive scalar radiation emitted by a particle radially\ninfalling into a Schwarzchild black hole. We show that the late-time waveform\nof massive scalar perturbations is dominated by a universal oscillatory\ndecaying tail, which appears due to curvature effects. We also show that the\nenergy spectrum is in perfect agreement with a ZFL calculation once no-hair\nproperties of black holes are taken into account. In the second part, we study\nthe phenomenon of superradiance in higher dimensions and conjecture that the\nmaximum energy extracted from a rotating black hole can be understood in terms\nof the ergoregion proper volume. We then study some consequences of\nsuperradiance in the dynamics of moons orbiting around higher-dimensional\nrotating black holes. In four-dimensional spacetime, moons around black holes\ngenerate low-amplitude tides, and the energy extracted from the hole's rotation\nis always smaller than the gravitational radiation lost to infinity. We show\nthat in dimensions larger than five the energy extracted from the black hole\nthrough superradiance is larger than the energy carried out to infinity. Our\nresults lend strong support to the conjecture that tidal acceleration is the\nrule, rather than the exception, in higher dimensions. Superradiance dominates\nthe energy budget and moons \"outspiral\"; for some particular orbital frequency,\nthe energy extracted at the horizon equals the energy emitted to infinity and\n\"floating orbits\" generically occur. We give an interpretation of this\nphenomenon in terms of the membrane paradigm and of tidal acceleration due to\nenergy dissipation across the horizon. \n\n"}

The related studies also suggested an\ninteresting form of decoupling of the heavy Kaluza-Klein (KK) fermion states in\nthe warped 5D SM in the limit where the profile of the SM Higgs approaches the\nIR brane. We demonstrate that a similar phenomenon occurs when we include the\nmandatory KK excitations of the SM Higgs in loop diagrams giving dipole\noperators for SM fermions, where the earlier work only considered the SM Higgs\n(zero mode). In particular, in the limit of a quasi IR-localized SM Higgs, the\neffect from summing over KK Higgs modes is unsuppressed (yet finite), in\ncontrast to the naive expectation that KK Higgs modes decouple as their masses\nbecome large. In this case, a wide range of KK Higgs modes have\nquasi-degenerate masses and enhanced couplings to fermions relative to those of\nthe SM Higgs, which contribute to the above remarkable result. In addition, we\nfind that the total contribution from KK Higgs modes in general can be\ncomparable to that from the SM Higgs alone. It is also interesting that KK\nHiggs couplings to KK fermions of the same chirality as the corresponding SM\nmodes have an unsuppressed overall contribution, in contrast to the result from\nthe earlier studies involving the SM Higgs.

Three right-handed neutrinos\n$N_i$, a new color triplet $Q$ and a complex SM-singlet scalar $\\sigma$, whose\nvacuum expectation value $v_\\sigma \\sim 10^{11}$ GeV breaks lepton number and a\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry simultaneously, are added to the SM.

This is due to a negative IR-singular term in the one-loop effective\npotential, which appears as a result of the UV/IR mixing. We study such a\nsystem non-perturbatively in the case of pure U(1) gauge theory in four\ndimensions, where two directions are non-commutative. Monte Carlo simulations\nare performed after mapping the regularized theory onto a U(N) lattice gauge\ntheory in d=2. At intermediate coupling strength, we find a phase in which open\nWilson lines acquire non-zero vacuum expectation values, which implies the\nspontaneous breakdown of translational invariance. In this phase, various\nphysical quantities obey clear scaling behaviors in the continuum limit with a\nfixed non-commutativity parameter $\\theta$, which provides evidence for a\npossible continuum theory. The extent of the dynamically generated space in the\nnon-commutative directions becomes finite in the above limit, and its\ndependence on $\\theta$ is evaluated explicitly.

We use this fact in this paper to derive in arbitrary\ndimension relations between the topology of the timelike boundary-at-infinity,\n$\\scri$, and that of the spacetime interior to this boundary. We prove as a\nsimple corollary of topological censorship that any asymptotically anti-de\nSitter spacetime with a disconnected boundary-at-infinity necessarily contains\nblack hole horizons which screen the boundary components from each other. This\ncorollary may be viewed as a Lorentzian analog of the Witten and Yau result\nhep-th/9910245, but is independent of the scalar curvature of $\\scri$.\nFurthermore, the topology of V', the Cauchy surface (as defined for\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime with boundary-at-infinity) for regions\nexterior to event horizons, is constrained by that of $\\scri$. In this paper,\nwe prove a generalization of the homology results in gr-qc/9902061 in arbitrary\ndimension, that H_{n-1}(V;Z)=Z^k where V is the closure of V' and k is the\nnumber of boundaries $\\Sigma_i$ interior to $\\Sigma_0$.

It turns out that the connected components of d are tori whose\ndimension is given by the holonomy of the connection. For n=2 we explicitly\ncompute d on all the connected components.

Our main result is a\nnatural isomorphism between a moduli space of spectral data and a moduli space\nof differential data, each equipped with an infinite collection of commuting\nflows. The spectral data are principal G-bundles on an algebraic curve,\nequipped with an abelian reduction near one point. The flows on the spectral\nside come from the action of a Heisenberg subgroup of the loop group. The\ndifferential data are flat connections known as opers. The flows on the\ndifferential side come from a generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchy.
