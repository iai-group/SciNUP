The\nadditional contributions are dominated by the repulsive 3P1 partial wave.

New experimental data on nucleon spin\nstructure at low to intermediate momentum transfers combined with existing high\nmomentum transfer data offer a comprehensive picture in the strong region of\nthe interaction and of the transition region from the strong to the\nasymptotic-free region. Insight for some aspects of the theory for the strong\ninteraction, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), is gained by exploring lower moments\nof spin structure functions and their corresponding sum rules. These moments\nare expressed in terms of an operator-product expansion using quark and gluon\ndegrees of freedom at moderately large momentum transfers. The higher-twist\ncontributions have been examined through the evolution of these moments as the\nmomentum transfer varies from higher to lower values. Furthermore, QCD-inspired\nlow-energy effective theories, which explicitly include chiral symmetry\nbreaking, are tested at low momentum transfers.

In this work, we examined the role of\nnuclear effective radius parameter (r$_0$) on Ramsauer model fits of neutron\ntotal cross sections. We performed Ramsauer model global analysis of the\nexperimental neutron total cross sections reported by W. P. Abfalterer, F.

We can imagine a unitary transformation which groups four non\nidentical nucleons (i.e. with different spin and isospin) close in coordinate\nspace. Those nucleons, being non identical, do not obey the Pauli principle,\nthus their relative momenta are negligibly small (just to fulfill the\nHeisenberg principle). Such a cluster can be identified with an $\\alpha$ boson.\nBut in dense nuclear matter, those $\\alpha$ particles still obey the Pauli\nprinciple since are constituted of Fermions. The ground state energy of nuclear\nmatter $\\alpha$ clusters is the same as for nucleons, thus it is degenerate. We\ncould think of $\\alpha$ particles as vortices which can now braid, for instance\nmaking $^8Be$ which leave the ground state energy unchanged. Further braiding\nto heavier clusters ($^{12}C$, $^{16}O$..) could give a different\nrepresentation of the ground state at no energy cost. In contrast d-like\nclusters (i.e. N=Z odd-odd nuclei, where N and Z are the neutron and proton\nnumber respectively) cannot describe the ground state of nuclear matter and can\nbe formed at high excitation energies (or temperatures) only. We show that\neven-even, N=Z, clusters could be classified as non-Abelian states of matter.\nAs a consequence an $\\alpha$ condensate in nuclear matter might be hindered by\nthe Fermi motion, while it could be possible a condensate of $^8Be$ or heavier\nclusters. \n\n"}

KATRIN investigates spectroscopically the electron spectrum from\ntritium beta- decay close to the kinematic endpoint of 18.6 keV with a high\nresolution electro-static filter of unprecedented energy resolution of 0.93 eV.\nKATRIN will be built at the Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe on site of the KIT\nCampus North.

Consequently, one can\nextract physics from solar neutrino flux measurements while minimizing the\nconsequences of SSM uncertainties, by studying flux ratios with appropriate\npower-law weightings tuned to cancel this $T_c$ dependence. We re-examine an\nidea for constraining the primordial C+N content of the solar core from a ratio\nof CN-cycle $^{15}$O to pp-chain $^8$B neutrino fluxes, showing that nonnuclear\nSSM uncertainties in the ratio are small and effectively governed by a single\nparameter, the diffusion coefficient. We point out that measurements of both\nCN-I cycle neutrino branches -- $^{15}$O and $^{13}$N $\\beta$-decay -- could in\nprinciple lead to separate determinations of the core C and N abundances, due\nto out-of-equilibrium CN-cycle burning in the cooler outer layers of the solar\ncore. Finally, we show that the strategy of constructing \"minimum uncertainty\"\nneutrino flux ratios can also test other properties of the SSM. In particular,\nwe demonstrate that a weighted ratio of $^7$Be and $^8$B fluxes constrains a\nproduct of S-factors to the same precision currently possible with laboratory\ndata. \n\n"}

Such technology has been proven\nin successful productions of ATLAS and Medipix-based silicon pixel sensors by a\nfew foundries. However, the drawbacks of edgeless sensors are poor radiation\nhardness for ionizing radiation and non-uniform charge collection by edge\npixels. In this work, the radiation hardness of edgeless sensors with different\npolarities has been investigated using Synopsys TCAD with X-ray\nradiation-damage parameters implemented. Results show that if no conventional\nguard ring is present, none of the current designs are able to achieve a high\nbreakdown voltage (typically < 30 V) after irradiation to a dose of ~10 MGy. In\naddition, a charge-collection model has been developed and was used to\ncalculate the charges collected by the edge pixels of edgeless sensors when\nilluminated with X-rays. The model takes into account the electric field\ndistribution inside the pixel sensor, the absorption of X-rays, drift and\ndiffusion of electrons and holes, charge sharing effect, and threshold settings\nin ASICs. It is found that the non-uniform charge collection of edge pixels is\ncaused by the strong bending of electric field and the non-uniformity depends\non bias voltage, sensor thickness and distance from active edge to the last\npixel (\"edge space\").

Its 2500\nscintillator strips have a Gd loaded reflective cover. Light is collected with\n3 wave length shifting fibers per strip and read out with 50 PMTs and 2500\nSiPMs. The DANSS will be installed under the industrial 3GW$_{th}$ reactor of\nthe Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant at distances varying from 9.7m to 12.2m from\nthe reactor core. PMTs and SiPMs collect about 30 photo electrons per MeV\ndistributed approximately equally between two types of the readout. Light\ncollection non-uniformity across and along the strip is about $\\pm13\\%$ from\nmaximum to minimum. The resulting energy resolution is modest, $\\sigma/E=15\\%$\nat 5MeV. This leads to a smearing of the oscillation pattern comparable with\nthe smearing due to the large size of the reactor core.

Liquid\nargon had a minor (56 ppm) admixture of nitrogen, which allowed to understand,\ninter alia, the effect of N2 doping on the EL mechanism in rare-event\nexperiments using two-phase Ar detectors. The measurements were performed in a\ntwo-phase Cryogenic Avalanche Detector (CRAD) with EL gap located directly\nabove the liquid-gas interface. The EL gap was optically read out in the Vacuum\nUltraviolet (VUV), near 128 nm (Ar excimer emission), and in the near\nUltraviolet (UV), at 300-450 nm (N2 Second Positive System emission), via\ncryogenic PMTs and a Geiger-mode APD (GAPD). Proportional electroluminescence\nwas measured to have an amplification parameter of 109+-10 photons per drifting\nelectron per kV overall in the VUV and UV, of which 51+-6% were emitted in the\nUV. The measured EL threshold, at an electric field of 3.7+-0.2 kV/cm, was in\naccordance with that predicted by the theory.

The J-PET is the first positron emission tomography\nscanner based on organic scintillators in contrast to all current PET scanners\nbased on inorganic crystals. Monte Carlo simulations show that the J-PET as an\naxially symmetric and high acceptance scanner can be used as a multi-purpose\ndetector well suited to pursue research including e.g. tests of discrete\nsymmetries in decays of ortho-positronium in addition to the medical imaging.\nThe gamma quanta originating from o-Ps decay interact in the plastic\nscintillators predominantly via the Compton effect, making the direct\nmeasurement of their energy impossible.

With a CRHWP, single detectors can measure\nthree of the Stokes parameters, $I$, $Q$ and $U$, thereby avoiding the set of\nsystematic errors that can be introduced by mismatches in the properties of\northogonal detector pairs. We focus on the implementation of CRHWPs in large\naperture telescopes (i.e. the primary mirror is larger than the current maximum\nhalf-wave plate diameter of $\\sim$0.5 m), where the CRHWP can be placed between\nthe primary mirror and focal plane. In this configuration, one needs to address\nthe intensity to polarization ($I{\\rightarrow}P$) leakage of the optics, which\nbecomes a source of 1/f noise and also causes differential gain systematics\nthat arise from CMB temperature fluctuations. In this paper, we present the\nperformance of a CRHWP installed in the POLARBEAR experiment, which employs a\nGregorian telescope with a 2.5 m primary illumination pattern. The CRHWP is\nplaced near the prime focus between the primary and secondary mirrors.

We demonstrate,\nhowever, that by subtracting the leakage correlated with the intensity signal,\nthe 1/f noise knee frequency is reduced to 32 mHz ($\\ell \\sim$39 for our scan\nstrategy), which is very promising to probe the primordial B-mode signal.

We prove that these\nsingular artifacts arise from points at the boundary of the data set. Our\nresults show that, depending on the geometry of this boundary, two types of\nartifacts can arise: object-dependent and object-independent artifacts.\nObject-dependent artifacts are generated by singularities of the object being\nscanned and these artifacts can extend along lines. They generalize the streak\nartifacts observed in limited-angle tomography. Object-independent artifacts,\non the other hand, are essentially independent of the object and take one of\ntwo forms: streaks on lines if the boundary of the data set is not smooth at a\npoint and curved artifacts if the boundary is smooth locally. We prove that\nthese streak and curve artifacts are the only singular artifacts that can occur\nfor FBP in the continuous case.

The measurement of the\nnuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm AA}$) provides a strong evidence of the\nin-medium parton energy loss. The comparison between the ${\\rm D_s}^{+}$ and\nthe non-strange D-meson $R_{\\rm AA}$ can help to study the hadronisation\nmechanism of the charm quark in the QGP. In mid-central collisions, the\nmeasurement of the D-meson elliptic flow $v_2$ at low transverse momentum\n($p_{\\rm T}$) gives insight into the participation of the charm quark into the\ncollective motion of the system, while at high $p_{\\rm T}$ it constrains the\npath-length dependence of the energy loss. The ${\\rm D_s}^{+}$ $v_2$, measured\nfor the first time at the LHC, is found to be compatible to that of non-strange\nD mesons and positive with a significance of about $2.6~\\sigma$. Further\nevidence of a strong coupling of the charm quark to the light quarks of the\nunderlying medium is suggested by the first application of the Event-Shape\nEngineering (ESE) technique to D-meson elliptic flow. \n\n"}

We arrive at this connection by reconsidering solvable lattice models\nknown as `metaplectic ice' whose partition functions are metaplectic Whittaker\nfunctions. First, we show that a certain Hecke action on metaplectic Whittaker\ncoinvariants agrees (up to twisting) with a Hecke action of Ginzburg,\nReshetikhin, and Vasserot. This allows us to expand the framework of KMS by\nDrinfeld twisting to introduce Gauss sums into the quantum wedge, which are\nnecessary for connections to metaplectic forms. Our main theorem interprets the\nrow transfer matrices of this ice model as `half' vertex operators on quantum\nFock space that intertwine with the action of\n$U_q(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}}(n))$.\n  In the process, we introduce new symmetric functions termed\n\\textit{metaplectic symmetric functions} and explain how they relate to\nWhittaker functions on an $n$-fold metaplectic cover of GL$_r$.

Heavy-quark\ntransport coefficients extracted from these models with their default\nparameters vary, however, by up to a factor of 5 at high momenta. To\ninvestigate the origin of this large theoretical uncertainty, a systematic\ncomparison of heavy-quark transport coefficients is carried out between various\ntransport models. Within a common scheme devised for the nuclear modification\nfactor of charm quarks in a brick medium of a quark-gluon plasma, the\nsystematic uncertainty of the extracted drag coefficient among these models is\nshown to be reduced to a factor of 2, which can be viewed as the smallest\nintrinsic systematical error band achievable at present time. This indicates\nthe importance of a realistic hydrodynamic evolution constrained by bulk hadron\nspectra and of heavy-quark hadronization for understanding the final\nheavy-flavor hadron spectra and extracting heavy-quark drag coefficient.

We investigate the\nconsequences of this for the charge-independence breaking (CIB) of the $^1S_0$\nscattering length, $\\Delta a_{CIB}$.

Moreover, if $g^2_{\\pi^\\pm}$ is only about 3%\nlarger than $g^2_{\\pi^0}$, then the established theoretical explanation of\n$\\Delta a_{CIB}$ (in terms of pion mass splitting) is completely wiped out. \n\n"}

The model\ncorrectly predicts the variation in the profiles as the temperature is changed\nfrom -10C to -25C. The measured charge collection profiles are inconsistent\nwith the linearly-varying electric fields predicted by the usual description\nbased upon a uniform effective doping density. This observation calls into\nquestion the practice of using effective doping densities to characterize\nirradiated silicon. \n\n"}
