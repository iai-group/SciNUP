This metric is known to be Finslerian, and the usual proof assumes a\ncertain degree of smoothness of the boundary of $\\Omega$ and refers to a\ntheorem by Busemann and Mayer that produces the norm of a tangent vector from\nthe distance function.

Under magnetic fields,\nferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations develop around the\nantiferromagnetic QTCP in addition to antiferromagnetic ones, which is in sharp\ncontrast with the conventional antiferromagnetic quantum critical point. For\nitinerant electron systems,} we show that the temperature dependence of\ncritical magnetic fluctuations around the QTCP are given as chiQ \\propto\nT^{-3/2} (chi0\\propto T^{-3/4}) at the antiferromagnetic ordering\n(ferromagnetic) wave number q=Q (q=0). The convex temperature dependence of\nchi0^{-1} is the characteristic feature of the QTCP, which is never seen in the\nconventional spin fluctuation theory. We propose that the general theory of\nquantum tricriticality that has nothing to do with the specific Kondo physics\nitself, solves puzzles of quantum criticalities widely observed in\nheavy-fermion systems such as YbRh2Si2, CeRu2Si2, and beta-YbAlB4.

We analytically substantiate this conjecture for a series of FQH\nstates defined as unique zero modes of pseudopotential Hamiltonians by finding\na one to one map between the thermodynamic limit counting of two different\nentanglement spectra: the particle entanglement spectrum, whose counting of\neigenvalues for each good quantum number is identical (up to accidental\ndegeneracies) to the counting of bulk quasiholes, and the orbital entanglement\nspectrum (the Li-Haldane spectrum).

The\nRiemannian metric $g_F$ also behaves nicely under conformal or bilipshitz\ndeformation of the Finsler metric $F$.

In particular we answer a question of M.\nMatsumoto about local conformal mapping between two Minkowski spaces, we\ndescribe all possible conformal self maps and all self similarities on a\nFinsler manifold. We also classify all compact conformally flat Finsler\nmanifolds, solve a conjecture of S. Deng and Z.

In the present paper we adopt therefore a metric rather than\nanalytic viewpoint.\n  As a first main result, we prove that the sub-Riemannian lens space admits\nnontrivial uniformly quasiregular (UQR) mappings, that is, quasiregular\nmappings with a uniform bound on the distortion of all the iterates. In doing\nso, we also obtain new examples of UQR maps on the standard sub-Riemannian\nspheres. The proof is based on a method for building conformal traps on\nsub-Riemannian spheres using quasiconformal flows, and an adaptation of this\napproach to quotients of spheres.\n  One may then study the quasiregular semigroup generated by a UQR mapping. In\nthe second part of the paper we follow Tukia to prove the existence of a\nmeasurable conformal structure which is invariant under such a semigroup. Here,\nthe conformal structure is specified only on the horizontal distribution, and\nthe pullback is defined using the Margulis--Mostow derivative (which\ngeneralizes the classical and Pansu derivatives). \n\n"}

This is commonly achieved by creating sub-wavelength\nlattices of electronic or plasmonic structures, so-called meta-atoms, that\ndetermine the interaction between light and metamaterial. One of the ultimate\ngoals for these tailored media is the ability to control their properties\nin-situ which has led to a whole new branch of tunable and switchable\nmetamaterials. Many of the present realizations rely on introducing\nmicroelectromechanical actuators or semiconductor elements into their meta-atom\nstructures. Here we show that superconducting quantum interference devices\n(SQUIDs) can be used as fast, intrinsically switchable meta-atoms. We found\nthat their intrinsic nonlinearity leads to simultaneously stable dynamic\nstates, each of which is associated with a different value and sign of the\nmagnetic susceptibility in the microwave domain. Moreover, we demonstrate that\nit is possible to switch between these states by applying a nanosecond long\npulse in addition to the microwave probe signal.

This state, dubbed as time MPS (tMPS), is a boundary state of tensor\nnetwork (TN) that represents the ground-state simulation after Trotter-Suzuki\ndecomposition. We show that the tMPS exhibits the structure of the continuous\nMPS originally proposed for the field theories. The information of excitations,\ne.g., dynamic correlation length and energy gap, can be accurately calculated\nfrom the tMPS. The non-universal renormalization of velocity of the excitations\nis given by a ratio between the correlations of the ground state and the tMPS.\nWhen the system is at the quantum critical point, the tMPS is found to show the\nlogarithmic scaling law, where the scaling coefficient gives the central charge\nthat characterizes the criticality of the theory.

We show how to reconcile the immobility\nof fractons with the expected gravitational behavior of the model. First, we\nreformulate the fracton phenomenon in terms of an emergent center of mass\nquantum number, and we show how an effective attraction arises from the\nprinciples of locality and conservation of center of mass. This interaction\nbetween fractons is always attractive and can be recast in geometric language,\nwith a geodesic-like formulation, thereby satisfying the expected properties of\na gravitational force.

Its dependence on the fictitious temperature can reflect the\nlow-temperature behavior of the physical heat capacity, and thus provide a\nuseful probe of gapless bulk or edge excitations of the system. Assuming a\npower-law scaling of the COE with an exponent $\\alpha$ at low fictitious\ntemperatures, we derive an analytical formula for the distribution function of\nthe RDM eigenvalues. We numerically test the effectiveness of the formula in\nrelativistic free scalar boson in two spatial dimensions, and find that the\ndistribution function can detect the expected $\\alpha=3$ scaling of the COE\nmuch more efficiently than the raw data of the COE. We also calculate the\ndistribution function in the ground state of the half-filled Landau level with\nshort-range interactions, and find a better agreement with the $\\alpha=2/3$\nformula than with the $\\alpha=1$ one, which indicates a non-Fermi-liquid nature\nof the system. \n\n"}

Cartan\nwith the upshot that generic equations in a C-class can be solved without\nintegration. While Cartan's definition was in terms of differential invariants\nbeing first integrals, all results exhibiting C-classes that we are aware of\nare based on the fact that a canonical Cartan geometry associated to the\nequations in the class descends to the space of solutions. For sufficiently low\norders, these geometries belong to the class of parabolic geometries and the\nresults follow from the general characterization of geometries descending to a\ntwistor space.\n  In this article we answer the question of whether a canonical Cartan geometry\ndescends to the space of solutions in the case of scalar ODEs of order at least\nfour and of systems of ODEs of order at least three. As in the lower order\ncases, this is characterized by the vanishing of the generalized Wilczynski\ninvariants, which are defined via the linearization at a solution. The\ncanonical Cartan geometries (which are not parabolic geometries) are a slight\nvariation of those available in the literature based on a recent general\nconstruction.

In other words the Minkowski geometry is an\nalternative of the Euclidean geometry for the subgroup $G$. It is rich of\nisometries if $G$ is \"close enough\" to the orthogonal group or at least to one\nof its transitive subgroups. The measure of non-transitivity is related to the\nHausdorff distances of the orbits under the elements of $G$ to the Euclidean\nsphere. Its maximum/minimum belongs to the so-called lazy/busy orbits, i.e.\nthey are the solutions of an optimization problem on the Euclidean sphere.

Particularly interesting is the fact that the\nobtention of dilation matrices is regardless of the stationarity of the\nunderlying process. When the process is stationary, it coincides with the\nNaimark Dilation and only one rotation matrix is computed, when the process is\nnon-stationary, a set of rotation matrices are computed. In particular, the\nperiodicity of the correlation function that may appear in some classes of\nsignal is transmitted to the set of dilation matrices. These rotation matrices,\nwhich can be arbitrarily close to each other depending on the sampling or the\nrescaling of the signal are seen as a distinctive feature of the signal.

On the\nother hand, in generic systems such expectation values relax to stationary\nvalues described by the thermal ensemble, fixed solely by the energy of the\nstate.

In\nsystems where ETH is violated, thermalization can be avoided. Thus establishing\nthe range of validity of ETH is crucial in understanding whether a given\nquantum system thermalizes.

It displays a topological\ndegeneracy when the lattice has a non-trivial geometry (cylinder, torus, etc).\nWe discuss and solve two extensions of the model where perturbations along\nlines are introduced: first the introduction of a potential energy term\nrepelling (or attracting) the dimers along a line is added, second a\nperturbation allowing to create, move or destroy monomers. For each of these\nperturbations we show that there exists a critical value above which, in the\nthermodynamic limit, the degeneracy of the ground-state is lifted from 2 (on a\ncylinder) to 1.

Classical phase transitions are characterized by\nnon-analyticities of the free energy. For quantum phase transitions (QPTs) the\nground state energy often assumes the role of the free energy.

It is therefore essential that we\nfind alternative criteria that can track fundamental changes in the internal\ncorrelations of the ground state wavefunction.

The Mahler conjecture asserts that the Mahler volume $v(K)$ is\nminimized (non-uniquely) when $K$ is an $n$-cube. The bottleneck conjecture (in\nits least general form) asserts that the volume of a certain domain $K^\\diamond\n\\subseteq K \\times K^\\circ$ is minimized when $K$ is an ellipsoid. It implies\nthe Mahler conjecture up to a factor of $(\\pi/4)^n \\gamma_n$, where $\\gamma_n$\nis a monotonic factor that begins at $4/\\pi$ and converges to $\\sqrt{2}$. This\nstrengthens a result of Bourgain and Milman, who showed that there is a\nconstant $c$ such that the Mahler conjecture is true up to a factor of $c^n$.\n  The proof uses a version of the Gauss linking integral to obtain a constant\nlower bound on $\\Vol K^\\diamond$, with equality when $K$ is an ellipsoid.

{"id": "math/0610985", "contents": "Title: A geometrical proof of the Hartogs extension theorem Abstract: 100 years ago exactly, in 1906, Hartogs published a celebrated extension\nphenomenon (birth of Several Complex Variables), whose global counterpart was\nstated in full generality later by Osgood (1929): holomorphic functions in a\nconnected neighborhood V(bD) of a connected boundary bD contained in C^n (n >=\n2) do extend holomorphically and uniquely to the domain D. It was a\nlong-standing open problem to derive a proof using only analytic discs, as did\nHurwitz (1897), Hartogs (1906) and E.E. Levi (1911) in some special, model\ncases. Quite unexpectedly, Fornaess in 1998 exhibited a topologically strange\n(nonpseudoconvex) domain D^F in C^2 that cannot be filled in by holomorphic\ndiscs, when one makes the additional requirement that discs must all lie\nentirely inside D^F. However, one should point out that the standard,\nunrestricted disc method usually allows discs to go outsise the domain (just\nthink of Levi pseudoconcavity). Confirming these rather ancient expectations,\nwe show that the global Hartogs extension theorem can be established in such a\nnatural way. \n\n"}

Here, an $X$-ray in direction $u$ of a finite\nsubset of the plane gives the number of points in the set on each line parallel\nto $u$. For practical reasons, only $X$-rays in $\\varLambda$-directions, i.e.,\ndirections parallel to non-zero elements of the difference set $\\varLambda -\n\\varLambda$, are permitted. In particular, by combining methods from algebraic\nnumber theory and convexity, it is shown that the convex subsets of a\ncyclotomic model set $\\varLambda$, i.e., finite sets $C\\subset \\varLambda$\nwhose convex hulls contain no new points of $\\varLambda$, are determined, among\nall convex subsets of $\\varLambda$, by their $X$-rays in four prescribed\n$\\varLambda$-directions, whereas any set of three $\\varLambda$-directions does\nnot suffice for this purpose.
