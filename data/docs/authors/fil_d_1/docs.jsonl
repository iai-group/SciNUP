As in a double-layer graphene system the\ntotal number of fermionic \"flavors\" is equal to N=8 due to two projections of\nspin, two valleys, and two layers, the large-$N$ approximation appears to be\nespecially suitable for theoretical investigation of the system.

It is shown that the effect of screening on the excitonic pairing\nis just as strong in the excitonic state as it is in the normal state.

We use both the exact numerical\nsimulations and the analytical theory employing the effective pure dephasing\nHamiltonian. The comparison shows that the latter approach describes very well\nthe spin echo decay at magnetic fields larger than the typical Overhauser\nfield, and that the timescale at which this theory works is larger than\npreviously expected. The numerical simulations are also done for very low\nvalues of electron spin splitting at which the effective Hamiltonian based\ntheory fails quantitatively. Interestingly, the qualitative difference in the\nspin echo decay between the cases of a homonuclear and a heteronuclear bath\n(i.e. bath containing nuclear isotopes having different Zeeman energies),\npredicted previously using the effective Hamiltonian approach, is still visible\nat very low fields outside the regime of applicability of the analytical\ntheory.

One such system is the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas on a\nring. In this system binary contact interactions between the constituent\nbosonic atoms, usually alkali metals, can be controlled in both sign and\nmagnitude; a recent experiment has tuned interactions over seven orders of\nmagnitude, using an atom-molecule resonance called a Feshbach resonance. Thus\none can directly realize the Lieb-Liniger Hamiltonian, from the weakly- to the\nstrongly-interacting regime. At the same time there are a number of experiments\nutilizing ring traps. The ring geometry affords us the opportunity to study\ntopological properties of this system as well; one of the main properties of a\nsuperfluid is the quantized circulation in which the average angular momentum\nper particle, L/N, is quantized under rotation. Thus we focus on a tunable 1D\nBose system for which the main control parameters are interaction and rotation.\nWe will show that there is a critical boundary in the interaction-rotation\ncontrol-parameter plane over which the topological properties of the system\nchange. This is the basis of our concept of \\textit{metastable quantum phase\ntransitions} (QPTs).

These nonlocal phase behaviors,\napparently overlooked in path-integral approaches, give a natural account of\nthe dynamical nonlocality character of the various (even static) Aharonov-Bohm\nphenomena, while at the same time they seem to respect Causality. Indeed, for\nparticles passing through nonvanishing magnetic or electric fields they lead to\ncancellations of Aharonov-Bohm phases at the observation point, generalizing\nearlier semiclassical experimental observations (of Werner & Brill) to\ndelocalized (spread-out) quantum states.

Recent discoveries, enabled by sophisticated\nfabrication, have uncovered new phenomena that completely change our\nunderstanding of transport in these devices, especially the role of the spin\nand valley degrees of freedom. This review describes the modern understanding\nof transport through nanotube devices.\n  Unlike conventional semiconductors, electrons in nanotubes have two angular\nmomentum quantum numbers, arising from spin and from valley freedom. We focus\non the interplay between the two. In single quantum dots defined in short\nlengths of nanotube, the energy levels associated with each degree of freedom,\nand the spin-orbit coupling between them, are revealed by Coulomb blockade\nspectroscopy. In double quantum dots, the combination of quantum numbers\nmodifies the selection rules of Pauli blockade.

In the transition to a 1D\nsystem with increasing lateral confinement, the spin orientation becomes more\nand more independent on the trajectory.

We also find that the dielectric\nresponse manifests as the wide-angle passband in the mid-infrared (IR)\ntransmission spectrum of light incident on a BDS film, which can be used for\nthe interferenceless omnidirectional mid-IR filtering. The tuning of the Fermi\nlevel of the system allows us to switch between the metallic and the dielectric\nregimes and to change the frequency range of the predicted modes.

Reaching the theoretical bounds for efficiency and\nefficiency at maximum power typically requires full control over the design and\nthe driving of the system. We develop a framework which allows to quantify the\nrole that limited control over the system has on the performance. Specifically,\nwe show that optimizing the driving entering the work extraction for a given\ntemperature protocol leads to a universal, one-parameter dependence for both\nmaximum efficiency and maximum power as a function of efficiency.

Using the Keldysh Green's function technique,\nwe calculate the nonsymmetrized current noise to the leading order in the\ncharge-vibration interaction.

In non-topological\njunctions when the charging energy is small compared to the Josephson tunneling\nscale the low energy physics is described by 2pi phase slips.

These phases are protected by\ncrystallographic point group symmetries and are characterized by bulk\ntopological invariants. The classification paradigm generalizes the Clifford\nalgebra extension process of each Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry class and utilizes\nalgebras which incorporate the point group symmetry. Explicit results for all\npoint group symmetries of three-dimensional crystals are presented as well as\nfor all symmorphic layer groups of two-dimensional crystals. We discuss future\nextensions for treatment of magnetic crystals and defected or\nhigher-dimensional systems as well as weak and fragile invariants. \n\n"}

The origin of such advantages lies in the role of\nquantum correlations, which may arise during the charging and discharging\nprocesses performed on the battery. In this theoretical work, we introduce a\nsystematic characterization of the relevant quantities of quantum batteries,\ni.e., the capacity and the power, in relation to such correlations. For these\nquantities, we derive upper bounds for batteries that are a collection of\nnoninteracting quantum cells with fixed Hamiltonians. The capacity, that is, a\nbound on the stored or extractable energy, is derived with the help of the\nenergy-entropy diagram, and this bound is respected as long as the charging and\ndischarging processes are entropy preserving. While studying power, we consider\na geometric approach for the evolution of the battery state in the energy\neigenspace of the battery Hamiltonian. Then, an upper bound for power is\nderived for arbitrary charging process, in terms of the Fisher information and\nthe energy variance of the battery. The former quantifies the speed of\nevolution, and the latter encodes the nonlocal character of the battery state.\nIndeed, due to the fact that the energy variance is bounded by the multipartite\nentanglement properties of batteries composed of qubits, we establish a\nfundamental bound on power imposed by quantum entanglement. We also discuss\nparadigmatic models for batteries that saturate the bounds both for the stored\nenergy and power. Several experimentally realizable quantum batteries, based on\nintegrable spin chains, the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick and the Dicke models, are also\nstudied in the light of these newly introduced bounds. \n\n"}

This study points to a novel way for an ultrafast\ngeneration and tuning of a unidirectional nonlinear spin Hall current by means\nof subpicosecond laser pulses of optical vortices. When interacting with\nmatter, the optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) carried by the vortex and\nquantified by its topological charge is transferred to the charge carriers.

We predict that a coupling between the\nspin-momentum locking (SML) observed in spin-orbit materials and low-energy\nbarrier magnets (LBM) should exhibit a unique multi-terminal rectification for\narbitrarily small amplitude channel currents. The basic idea is to measure the\ncharge current induced spin accumulation in the SML channel in the form of a\nmagnetization dependent voltage using an LBM, either with an in-plane or\nperpendicular anisotropy (IMA or PMA). The LBM feels an instantaneous\nspin-orbit torque due to the accumulated spins in the channel which causes the\naverage magnetization to follow the current, leading to the non-linear\nrectification.

Since the two sets of two-level\nsystems are coupled indirectly through the oscillator, excitation transfer from\none set of two-level systems to the other is possible. In addition, the\nexcitation energy from the two-level systems may be exchanged with the\noscillator coherently, even though the oscillator energy may be orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the two-level system transition energy. In the lossless\ncase, we demonstrate these effects numerically, and also use an approximate\ndiagonalization to show that these effects are expected from the model\nHamiltonian.\n  We augment the model to include loss effects, and show that loss enhances the\nexcitation transfer effect by breaking the severe cancelation between different\npaths that occurs in the lossless case.

These include macroscopic \"vacuum\" forces on a metallic layer\nin-between a dielectric medium and an inert ($\\epsilon (\\omega) = 1$) one. Ways\nto control the sign of these forces, based on dielectric properties of the\nmedia, are thus suggested. Finally, the large positive Casimir pressure, due to\nsurface plasmons on thin metallic layers, is evaluated and discussed. \n\n"}

As\nwas shown by several research groups, the Lifshitz theory, which provides the\ntheoretical foundation for the calculation of both the van der Waals and\nCasimir forces, leads to different results depending on the model of metal\nconductivity used. To resolve these controversies, the theoretical\nconsiderations based on the principles of thermodynamics and new experimental\ntests were invoked. We analyze the present status of the problem (in\nparticular, the advantages and disadvantages of the approaches based on the\nsurface impedance and on the Drude model dielectric function) using rigorous\nanalytical calculations of the entropy of a fluctuating field. We also discuss\nthe results of a new precise experiment on the determination of the Casimir\npressure between two parallel plates by means of a micromechanical torsional\noscillator. \n\n"}

State-selective mirrors are described in the limit of strong\nlasers. The ladder, V and $\\Lambda$ configurations for a three-level atom are\ndiscussed. For the two level case, the transient effects arising as result of\nthe interaction between both a semi-infinite beam and a wavepacket with the\non-resonance laser are examined. \n\n"}

We obtain exact numerical results\nfor a simple two-well model and carry out statistical calculations appropriate\nfor the full lattice case. We find that the dynamics of the reflected light\nstrongly depends on both the lattice spacing and the state of the matter-wave\nfield. Depending on the lattice spacing, the light field is sensitive to\nvarious density-density correlation functions of the atoms. The light field and\nthe atoms become strongly entangled if the latter are in a superfluid state, in\nwhich case the photon statistics typically exhibit complicated multimodal\nstructures. \n\n"}

Varying their\ndegree of connectivity, we investigate the interplay between the enhancement of\nentanglement, due to connections, and its frustration, due to monogamy\nconstraints. Remarkably, we see that in many situations the degree of\nentanglement in a highly connected system is essentially of the same order as\nin a low connected one. We also identify instances in which the entanglement\ndecreases as the degree of connectivity increases. \n\n"}
