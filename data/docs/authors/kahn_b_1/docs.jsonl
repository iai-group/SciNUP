This decomposition\ncoincides with the projection of the Richardson stratification of the flag\nmanifold, studied by Lusztig, Rietsch, and Brown-Goodearl-Yakimov. However, its\ncyclic-invariance is hidden in this description.

Localizing an\narbitrary triangulated $C$ by a set $S$ of morphisms in the heart of a weight\nstructure $w$ for it one obtains a triangulated category endowed with a weight\nstructure $w'$. The heart of $w'$ is a certain idempotent completion of the\nnon-commutative localization of the heart of $w$ by $S$. The latter is the\nnatural categorical version of Cohn's localizations of rings i.e. the functor\nconnecting hearts is universal among all the additive functors that make the\nelements of $S$ invertible. In particular, taking $C=K^b(A)$ for an additive\n$A$ we obtain a very efficient tool for computing the additive localization of\n$A$ by $S$; using it, we generalize the calculations of Gerasimov and\nMalcolmson.\n  We apply our results to certain categories of birational motives over a base\nscheme $U$ (generalizing those defined by Kahn and Sujatha).

Crauder\nand Morrison classified these models into two main classes: so-called flowerpot\ndegenerations and chain degenerations. This classification is very precise,\nwhich allows to use a combination of geometrical and combinatorial techniques\nto check the monodromy property in practice.\n  The first main result is an explicit computation of the poles of\n$Z_{X,\\omega}(T)$ for a $K3$ surface $X$ allowing a triple-point-free model and\na volume form $\\omega$ on $X$.

This is\nbecause smoothly embedded special lagrangian cycles in the mirror have\nunobstructed deformations.

The generalized\nbranch divisor of a stable map to a nonsingular curve X yields a canonical\nmorphism from the space of stable maps to a symmetric product of X.

This property allows to complete the\nwork of van Geemen-Previato which, basing on the classical results on geometry\nof the Kummer quartic surfaces, specified the explicit form of the Hamiltonians\nof the Hitchin system. The resulting integrable system resembles the classic\nNeumann systems which are also self-dual. Its quantization produces a commuting\nfamily of differential operators of the second order acting on homogeneous\npolynomials in four complex variables. As recently shown by van Geemen-de Jong,\nthese operators realize the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard-Hitchin connection\nfor group SU(2) and genus 2 curves. \n\n"}
