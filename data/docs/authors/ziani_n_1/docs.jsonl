Throughout the review we emphasize\nuniversal aspects and similarities of symmetry breaking found in these systems,\nas well as in more traditional fields like nuclear physics and quantum\nchemistry, which are characterized by very different interparticle forces. A\nunified description of strongly correlated phenomena in finite systems of\nrepelling particles (whether fermions or bosons) is presented through the\ndevelopment of a two-step method of symmetry breaking at the unrestricted\nHartree-Fock level and of subsequent symmetry restoration via post Hartree-Fock\nprojection techniques. Quantitative and qualitative aspects of the two-step\nmethod are treated and validated by exact diagonalization calculations.\n  Strongly-correlated phenomena emerging from symmetry breaking include: (I)\nChemical bonding, dissociation, and entanglement (at zero and finite magnetic\nfields) in quantum dot molecules and in pinned electron molecular dimers formed\nwithin a single anisotropic quantum dot. (II) Electron crystallization, with\nparticle localization on the vertices of concentric polygonal rings, and\nformation of rotating electron molecules (REMs) in circular quantum dots. (III)\nAt high magnetic fields, the REMs are described by parameter-free analytic wave\nfunctions, which are an alternative to the Laughlin and composite-fermion\napproaches. (IV) Crystalline phases of strongly repelling bosons. In rotating\ntraps and in analogy with the REMs, such repelling bosons form rotating boson\nmolecules (RBMs). \n\n"}

Fractional charge pumping is achieved by slow and periodic\nmodulation of coupling of the anti-dot level to left and right moving edges of\na Hall bar set-up.

Either a grounded or a semi-infinite wire at\ntoo low temperature is driven into the strong coupling regime.\n  We show that the injector induce invasive effects. They are due to non-local\nbackscattering processes generated both by virtual higher order tunneling\nprocesses and by Coulomb interactions with the injector. The latter induce in\naddition screening of interactions in the wire. For an STM, those effects can\ndrastically mask the probed density of states (DOS). In the limit of zero\ntemperature, a long and grounded wire is driven to its fixed point where it is\ndisconnected at the tunneling point. Thus instead of the bulk expected DOS, the\nSTM probes the end one. We analyze current auto- and cross-correlations. We\nshow that the cross-correlations are dominated by their value in the\ntwo-terminal geometry. As these are opposite to the current auto-correlations,\nthey are always negative for local scattering processes. We give novel scaling\nlaws to all orders with respect to a local backscattering. \n\n"}

These\nlocal sum rules allow for arbitrary hoppings, site energies, and interactions.\nThey can be employed to quantify the accuracy of numerical solutions to the\ninhomogeneous many-body problem like strongly correlated multilayered devices,\nultracold atoms in an optical lattice with a trap potential, strongly\ncorrelated systems that are disordered, or systems with nontrivial spatial\nordering like a charge density wave or a spin density wave. We also show how\nthe spectral moment sum rules determine the asymptotic behavior of the Green\nfunction, self-energy, and dynamical mean field, when applied to the dynamical\nmean-field theory solution of the many body problem. In particular, we\nillustrate in detail how one can dramatically reduce the number of Matsubara\nfrequencies needed to solve the Falicov-Kimball model, while still retaining\nhigh precision, and we sketch how one can incorporate these results into\nHirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo solvers for the Hubbard (or more complicated)\nmodels. Since the solution of inhomogeneous problems is significantly more time\nconsuming than periodic systems, efficient use of these sum rules can provide a\ndramatic speed up in the computational time required to solve the many-body\nproblem.

The strong scattering is reflected by a\nminimum of the spin conductivity at the Dirac point, where it reaches sigma_s =\n(0.121/alpha^2) * (mu_B^2/\\hbar) at weak Coulomb coupling alpha.

In\nparticular, we consider different types of interactions including screened\nCoulomb interactions, much like those produced by a point charge placed either\nabove a single infinite conducting plate or exactly halfway between two\nparallel infinite conducting plates.

The thesis consists of six chapters. Ch1 is an\nintroduction. In Ch2, sample preparation and characterizations are described.\nIn Ch3, by using a self-heating 3-Omega method, the specific heat, thermal\ndiffusivity and thermal conductivity of MWNTs are measured. MWNTs of 20-40 nm\ndiameter show a linear specific heat over a temperature range of 10-300 K,\nsuggesting that inter-wall coupling in MWNTs is rather weak compared with that\nof graphite. The thermal conductivity shows a crossover from linear temperature\ndependence to a square law at ~120K, with a rather low room-temperature\namplitude which may have resulted from structural defects. In Ch4, four-wire\ntunneling spectroscopy of junctions between MWNTs and a normal metal is\nmeasured. The Coulomb interactions in the MWNTs give rise to a strong zero-bias\nsuppression of tunneling density of states that can be fitted numerically with\nthe environmental quantum-fluctuation theory. At low temperatures, an\nasymmetric conductance anomaly near zero bias is observed, which is interpreted\nas Fano resonance in the strong tunneling regime. In Ch5, the thermoelectric\npower (TEP) and longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) of MWNTs are measured. A\nmoderate positive TEP with metallic-like linear temperature dependence is\nfound, suggesting that the electron-hole symmetry in metallic MWNTs is broken.\nPeriodic oscillations in MR are observed at 20 mK when a longitudinal magnetic\nfield is applied.

In\nthis article, we review theoretical studies of the Fermi liquid theory and\nCooper pairing instabilities of both electric and magnetic dipolar fermionic\nsystems from the perspective of unconventional symmetries. When the electric\ndipole moments are aligned by the external electric field, their interactions\nexhibit the explicit $d_{r^2-3z^2}$ anisotropy. The Fermi liquid properties,\nincluding the single-particle spectra, thermodynamic susceptibilities, and\ncollective excitations, are all affected by this anisotropy. The electric\ndipolar interaction provides a mechanism for the unconventional spin triplet\nCooper pairing, which is different from the usual spin-fluctuation mechanism in\nsolids and the superfluid $^3$He. Furthermore, the competition between pairing\ninstabilities in the singlet and triplet channels gives rise to a novel\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking superfluid state.

There is mounting experimental evidence for this scenario in 2D\norganic superconductors in large in-plane magnetic fields; this is complemented\nby ongoing efforts to realize this scenario in coupled tubes of atomic Fermi\ngases with spin imbalance.

Although the unitary time evolution ensuing from a pure initial\nstate maintains the system globally at zero entropy, at long time after the\nquench local properties are captured by an appropriate statistical ensemble\nwith non zero thermodynamic entropy, which can be interpreted as the\nentanglement accumulated during the dynamics.

From this theoretical study a\npicture emerges in which impurity dynamics is universal on essentially all time\nscales, and where the high-frequency few-body response is related to the\nlong-time dynamics of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe by Tan relations.\nOur theoretical description relies on different and complementary approaches:\nfunctional determinants give an exact numerical solution for time- and\nfrequency-resolved responses, bosonization provides analytical expressions at\nlow temperatures, and the theory of Toeplitz determinants allows one to\nanalytically predict response up to high temperatures.

Without the bond alternation, finite\npairing potential induces a topological state defined by zero-energy Majorana\nedge mode, while finite bond alternation without the pairing potential makes a\ndifferent topological state similar to the Haldane state, which is defined by\nlocal Berry phase in the bulk.

Its real, Lindbladian or imaginary time\nevolution can be split into small time steps. Every time step generates a new\niPEPS with an enlarged bond dimension $D' > D$, which is approximated by an\niPEPS with the original $D$. In Phys. Rev. B 98, 045110 (2018) an algorithm was\nintroduced to optimize the approximate iPEPS by maximizing directly its\nfidelity to the one with the enlarged bond dimension $D'$. In this work we\nimplement a more efficient optimization employing a local estimator of the\nfidelity.
