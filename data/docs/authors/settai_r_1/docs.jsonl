In deriving\nrenormalization formulae, we also derive or estimate terms of higher powers of\nintersite contractions neglected in the conventional GA.

From the d-wave symmetry of the order parameter, the importance of\nantiferromagnetic fluctuations, and the presence of a mysterious pseudogap\nphase close to the Mott state, one can conclude that high-Tc superconductors\nare clearly distinguishable from the well-understood BCS superconductors. The\nd-wave superconducting state can be understood through a Gutzwiller-type\nprojected BCS wave-function.

Nevertheless, the efficiency most of them is still based on the\nfundamental physical phenomena, such as resonances. Thus, the understanding of\nthe resonance phenomena will be beneficial. One of the well-known examples is\nthe resonant enhancement of the transmission known as Breit-Wigner resonances,\nwhich can be described by a Lorentzian function. But, in many physical systems\nthe scattering of waves involves propagation along different paths, and, as a\nconsequence, results in interference phenomena, where constructive interference\ncorresponds to resonant enhancement and destructive interference to resonant\nsuppression of the transmission. Recently, a variety of experimental and\ntheoretical work has revealed such patterns in different branches of physics.\nThe purpose of this Review is to demonstrate that this kind of resonant\nscattering is related to the Fano resonances, known from atomic physics. One of\nthe main features of the Fano resonances is the asymmetric profile. The\nasymmetry comes from the close coexistence of resonant transmission and\nresonant reflection. Fano successfully explained such a phenomenon in his\nseminal paper in 1961 in terms of interaction of a discrete (localized) state\nwith a continuum of propagation modes. It allows to describe both resonant\nenhancement and resonant suppression in a unified manner.

Even in the intermediate-valence materials, the QCP is induced by\napplying a magnetic field, at which the magnetic susceptibility also diverges.\nThe driving force of the field-induced QCP is shown to be a cooperative\nphenomenon of the Zeeman effect and the Kondo effect, which creates a distinct\nenergy scale from the Kondo temperature. The key concept is that the closeness\nto the QCP of the FOVT is capital in understanding Ce- and Yb-based heavy\nfermions.

In addition to the standard\ndescription based on the fluctuations of the antiferromagnetic order, a local\nquantum critical point is also considered. It contains inherently quantum modes\nthat are associated with a critical breakdown of the Kondo effect. Across such\na quantum critical point, there is a sudden collapse of a large Fermi surface\nto a small one. I also consider the proximate antiferromagnetic and\nparamagnetic phases, and these considerations lead to a global phase diagram.\nFinally, I discuss the pertinent experiments on the antiferromagnetic heavy\nfermions, briefly address the case of ferromagnetic heavy fermions, and outline\nsome directions for future studies. \n\n"}

Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L. We explicitly establish the validity of this statement\nfor the case of N=4. The details of the relevant calculations being distinctly\ntransparent, one can readily convince oneself that our observation is valid for\narbitrary N. It follows that the issues raised by DPK, such as non-existence of\nthe Luttinger-Ward functional and \"breakdown of the elemental particle picture\nin strongly correlated electron matter\", are all inessential to the observed\nfailure of the LT. As regards the singularity of the self-energy \\Sigma(\\omega)\non the real \\omega-axis, observed by DPK, we demonstrate that this also is a\ndirect consequence of the non-uniqueness of the GS of the SU(N) model for 0 < n\n< N.

The most fundamental result to which we pay especial\nattention in this paper, is that the exact Fermi surface (FS) of the uniform\nmetallic ground state (GS) of any single-band Hamiltonian, describing fermions,\nis a subset of the FS within the framework of the exact Hartree-Fock theory. We\nalso review some of the physical implications of the latter result. Our\nconsiderations reveal that the interacting FS of a uniform metallic GS cannot\nbe calculated exactly to order \\nu (\\nu \\ge 2) in the coupling constant \\lambda\nof the interaction potential in terms of the self-energy calculated to order\n\\nu in a non-self-consistent fashion. We show this to be interlinked with the\nfailure of the Luttinger-Ward identity, and thus of the Luttinger theorem, for\na self-energy that is not appropriately related to the single-particle Green\nfunction from which the FS is deduced. We further show that the same mechanism\nthat embodies the Luttinger theorem within the framework of the exact theory,\naccounts for a non-trivial dependence of the exact self-energy on \\lambda that\ncannot be captured within a non-self-consistent framework. We thus establish\nthat the extant calculations that purportedly prove deformation of the\ninteracting FS of the metallic GS of the single-band Hubbard Hamiltonian with\nrespect to its Hartree-Fock counterpart at the second order in the on-site\ninteraction energy U, are fundamentally deficient.

Numerical solution of the BdG equations suggests that while in the\nstrong attraction regime (U > Uc) disorder has the usual effect of suppressing\nsuperconductivity, in the weak attraction regime (U < Uc) weak disorder\nenhances superconductivity.

Moreover, the\nnon-trivial topology found in some insulators and superconductors has profound\nphysical implications that can be observed experimentally and can potentially\nbe used for applications.

ZrTe5\nhas host a long-standing puzzle on its anomalous transport properties; its\nunderlying origin remains elusive. Lately, ZrTe5 has ignited renewed interest\nbecause it is predicted that single-layer ZrTe5 is a two-dimensional\ntopological insulator and there is possibly a topological phase transition in\nbulk ZrTe5. However, the topological nature of ZrTe5 is under debate as some\nexperiments point to its being a three-dimensional or quasi-two-dimensional\nDirac semimetal. Here we report high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved\nphotoemission measurements on ZrTe5. The electronic property of ZrTe5 is\ndominated by two branches of nearly-linear-dispersion bands at the Brillouin\nzone center. These two bands are separated by an energy gap that decreases with\ndecreasing temperature but persists down to the lowest temperature we measured\n(~2 K). The overall electronic structure exhibits a dramatic temperature\ndependence; it evolves from a p-type semimetal with a hole-like Fermi pocket at\nhigh temperature, to a semiconductor around ~135 K where its resistivity\nexhibits a peak, to an n-type semimetal with an electron-like Fermi pocket at\nlow temperature. These results indicate a clear electronic evidence of the\ntemperature-induced Lifshitz transition in ZrTe5.

In this present theory, the d-wave\nsuperconducting (SC) fluctuations, which are mediated by antiferromagnetic (AF)\ncorrelations, become dominant below T^*. We focus on the role of the vertex\ncorrections both for the charge current and the heat one, which are\nindispensable to keep the conservation laws. As a result, the mysterious\nbehaviors of \\nu and \\Delta\\rho/\\rho, which are the key phenomena in the\npseudo-gap region, are naturally explained as the reflection of the enhancement\nof the SC fluctuation, without assuming thermally excited vortices. The present\nresult suggests that the pseudo-gap region in high-Tc cuprates is well\ndescribed in terms of the Fermi liquid with AF and SC fluctuations. \n\n"}

Such behavior is of general form and takes place in\nboth three dimensional systems and two dimensional ones. We demonstrate that a\nsystem which has undergone FCQPT and lies close to the critical point $x_{FC}$\ncan be driven back into the normal Fermi liquid by applying a small magnetic\nfield $B$. As the field $B$ is reduced, the system is tuned back to the\ncritical point and the effective mass diverges as $M^*\\propto\n1/\\sqrt{B-B_{FC}}$ where $B_{FC}$ is the maximum field at which FCQPT takes\nplace. We demonstrate the constancy of the Kadowaki-Woods ratio when\napproaching the critical point at the fields $B>B_{FC}$. Analyzing recent\nexperimental data on the effective mass behavior in a strongly correlated two\ndimensional fluid $^3$He, in metallic two dimensional electron systems and in\nheavy-fermion systems, we show that the observed behavior is in agreement with\nour consideration.

The first goal is to show that high\nresolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectra from cuprates indicate the\npresence of string-like excitations of the quasihole excitation in a quantum\nantiferromagnet. In order to compare with the experimental intensity plots, we\ncalculate the spectral function of the t-J and the t-t'-t\"-J models within the\nself-consistent Born approximation for widely accepted values of the parameters\nof these models. The main features of the high resolution photoelectron spectra\nare in general agreement with the results based on the above models and can be\nunderstood by considering not only the lowest energy quasiparticle peak but,\nalso, the higher energy string-like excitations of the hole. The second goal of\nthe present paper is to make the case that a proper analysis of both the\nnumerical results obtained from these models and of the experimental results,\nsuggests a theoretical picture for the internal structure of the\nhole-quasiparticle and a string-exchange pairing mechanism due to strong\nantiferromagnetic correlations among the background spins. We find that, using\na simple model in which the Hilbert space is restricted to states of only\nunbroken strings attached to the holes and in which the holes are connected\nwith unbroken strings, we can provide a good quantitative description of the\nmost accurate numerical results.

More specifically, spin and\ncharge susceptibilities are expressed, in a conserving approximation, as a\nfunction of two constant irreducible vertices whose values are found\nself-consistently. The Mermin-Wagner theorem in two dimensions is automatically\nsatisfied. The effect of collective modes on single-particle properties is then\nobtained by a paramagnon-like formula that is consistent with the two-particle\nproperties in the sense that the potential energy obtained from $Tr\\Sigma G$ is\nidentical to that obtained using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for\nsusceptibilities.

Results obtained for various electron numbers\ncorresponding to different closed-shells indicate that the finite-size effects\nin our calculation are small. For any value of interaction strength, we find\nthat there is always a value of the electron density above which the system can\nlower its energy by forming a two-component phase separated state. Our results\nare compared with other calculations on the t-J model. We find that the most\naccurate results are consistent with phase separation at all interaction\nstrengths. \n\n"}

We use the spin-charge\nseparation ansatz as applied to the nodes of a d-wave superconducting gap.Such\na situation may be of relevance to the physics of high-temperature\nsuperconductivity.

Such symmetries\npertain to the continuum effective field theory of the nodal liquid, and one's\nhope is that the ancestor lattice model may differ from the continuum theory\nonly by renormalization-group irrelevant operators in the infrared. We give\nplausible arguments that nodal liquids at such supersymmetric points are\ncharacterized by superconductivity of Kosterlitz-Thouless type.
