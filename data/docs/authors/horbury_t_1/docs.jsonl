Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

While the massive\nfirst stars have long vanished the second stars are still around and currently\nobserved. They are the carriers of the information about the first stars, but\nthey are also capable of nuclear production themselves. For example, in order\nto use ultra or extremely metal-poor stars as a probe for the r-process in the\nearly universe a reliable model of the s-process in the second stars is needed.\nEventually, the second stars may provide us with important clues on questions\nranging from structure formation to how the stars actually make the elements,\nnot only in the early but also in the present universe. In particular the\nC-rich extremely metal-poor stars, most of which show the s-process signature,\nare thought to be associated with chemical yields from the evolved giant phase\nof intermediate mass stars. Models of such AGB stars at extremely low\nmetallicity now exist, and comparison with observation show important\ndiscrepancies, for example with regard to the synthesis of nitrogen.

The distribution function of the\ntransported particles is decomposed into trapped and streaming particle\ncomponents. Their separate evolution equations are coupled by a source term\nthat converts trapped particles into streaming particles. We determine this\nsource term by requiring the correct diffusion limit. For a smooth transition\nto the free streaming regime, this 'diffusion source' is limited by the matter\nemissivity. The resulting streaming particle emission rates are integrated over\nspace to obtain the streaming particle flux. A geometric estimate of the flux\nfactor is used to convert the particle flux to the streaming particle density.\nThe efficiency of the scheme results from the freedom to use different\napproximations for each particle component.

Although the power spectrum differs substantially across\nplausible models, a generic prediction is that the amplitude of the 21 cm power\nspectrum on MWA scales peaks near the epoch when the intergalactic medium (IGM)\nis ~ 50% ionized.

To\ninvestigate dust absorption and emission in galaxies we have assembled a sample\nof ~1000 galaxies with ultraviolet (UV) through infrared (IR) photometry from\nGALEX, SDSS, and Spitzer and optical spectroscopy from SDSS. The ratio of IR to\nUV emission (IRX) is used to constrain the dust attenuation in galaxies. We use\nthe 4000A break as a robust and useful, although coarse, indicator of star\nformation history (SFH). We examine the relationship between IRX and the UV\nspectral slope (a common attenuation indicator at high-redshift) and find\nlittle dependence of the scatter on 4000A break strength. We construct average\nUV through far-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for different ranges of\nIRX, 4000A break strength, and stellar mass (M_*) to show the variation of the\nentire SED with these parameters. When binned simultaneously by IRX, 4000A\nbreak strength, and M_* these SEDs allow us to determine a low resolution\naverage attenuation curve for different ranges of M_*. The attenuation curves\nthus derived are consistent with a lambda^{-0.7} attenuation law, and we find\nno significant variations with M_*. Finally, we show the relationship between\nIRX and the global stellar mass surface density and gas-phase-metallicity.\nAmong star forming galaxies we find a strong correlation between IRX and\nstellar mass surface density, even at constant metallicity, a result that is\nclosely linked to the well-known correlation between IRX and star-formation\nrate. \n\n"}

The total number of stars with reliable\nspectroscopic and morphological identification was 95 and 108 in the north and\nsouth fields respectively. The sample of spectroscopically identified stars\nallows constraints to be set on the thickness of the Galactic thin disk as well\nas contributions from a thick disk and a halo component. We derive a thin disk\nscale height, as traced by the population of M4 to M9 dwarfs along two\nindependent lines of sight, of h_thin = 370 +60/-65 pc.

In\ncontrast, the observed behaviour in the optical band is complex (from 10$^2$ up\nto 10$^6$ s).

In contrast, the shallow optical\ndecay between 450 and 1500 s remains problematic, requiring a reverse shock\ncomponent whose typical frequency is above the optical band at the optical peak\ntime for it to be explained within the standard model.

We conclude that other heating mechanisms must\nbe in operation if the pulsars are in fact solid quark stars. Two possible\nheating mechanisms are explored. Firstly, for pulsars with little\nmagnetospheric activities, accretion from the interstellar medium or from the\nmaterial in the associated supernova remnants may power the observed thermal\nemission. In the propeller regime, a disk-accretion rate ${\\dot M}\\sim$1% of\nthe Eddington rate with an accretion onto the stellar surface at a rate of\n$\\sim 0.1% {\\dot M}$ could explain the observed emission luminosities of the\ndim isolated neutron stars and the central compact objects.

The electro-magnetic configuration\nforming the RCS incorporates all three components of the magnetic field\n(including the guiding field) and a drifted electric field. PIC simulations\nreveal that there is a polarisation electric field that appears during\nacceleration owing to a separation of electrons from protons towards the\nmidplane of the RCS. If the plasma density is low, the polarisation field is\nweak and the particle trajectories in the PIC simulations are similar to those\nin the test particle (TP) approach. For the higher plasma density the\npolarisation field is stronger and it affects the trajectories of protons by\nincreasing their orbits during acceleration. This field also leads to a less\nasymmetrical abundances of ejected protons towards the midplane in comparison\nwith the TP approach. For a given magnetic topology electrons in PIC\nsimulations are ejected to the same semispace as protons, contrary to the TP\nresults. This happens because the polarisation field extends far beyond the\nthickness of a current sheet. This field decelerates the electrons, which are\ninitially ejected into the semispace opposite to the protons, returns them back\nto the RCS, and, eventually, leads to the electron ejection into the same\nsemispace as protons.

The spine is an isolated field\nline which approaches the null (or recedes from it), while the fan is a surface\nof field lines which recede from it (or approach it).\n  So-called \"torsional spine reconnection\" occurs when field lines in the\nvicinity of the fan rotate, with current becoming concentrated along the spine,\nso that nearby field lines undergo rotational slippage. In \"torsional fan\nreconnection\" field lines near the spine rotate and create a current that is\nconcentrated in the fan with a rotational flux mismatch and rotational\nslippage. In both of these regimes, the spine and fan are perpendicular and\nthere is no flux transfer across spine or fan. The third regime, called\n\"spine-fan reconnection\", is the most common in practice and combines elements\nof the previous spine and fan models. In this case, in response to a generic\nshearing motion, the null point collapses to form a current sheet that is\nfocused at the null itself, in a sheet that locally spans both the spine and\nfan.

In this article, we perform an analysis of this effect, based\non the hierarchial halo model of the dark matter structure and\nNavarro-Frenk-White density profiles. We consider the clumps of various masses,\nfrom the smallest up to the highest ones $M\\ge 10^{9} M_\\odot$. It has been\nfound that in any event the effect grows with the mass of the clump: not only\nthe drag force $\\mathfrak F$ acting on the clump, but also its acceleration\n$w=\\mathfrak F/M$ increases.\n  We discuss various astrophysical systems. The mechanism proved to be\nineffective in the case of galaxy or galaxy cluster collisions. On the other\nhand, it played an important role during the process of galaxy formation.

Our analysis is mainly based on redshift\ndata for 88 galaxies acquired at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo.

We estimate a quite large LOS\nvelocity dispersion sigma_V about 1400 km/s and X-ray temperature T_X about 10\nkeV. Our optical and X-ray analysis detects evidence for substructure. Our\nresults are consistent with the presence of two massive subclusters separated\nby a LOS rest frame velocity difference V_rf about 2000 km/s, very closely\nprojected in the plane of sky along the SE-NW direction.

It is thus one of the best\ncases for studying the properties of massive protostars to constrain high-mass\nstar formation theories. Near-infrared radiation from source I escapes through\nthe cavity opened by the OMC1 outflow and is scattered by dust towards our line\nof sight. The reflected spectrum offers a unique possibility of observing the\nemission from the innermost regions of the system and probing the nature of\nsource I and its immediate surroundings. We obtained moderately high\nspectral-resolution (R~9000) observations of the near-infrared diffuse emission\nin several locations around source I/Orion-KL. We observed a widespread rich\nabsorption line spectrum that we compare with cool stellar photospheres and\nprotostellar accretion disk models. The spectrum is broadly similar to strongly\nveiled, cool, low-gravity stellar photospheres in the range Teff~3500-4500 K,\nluminosity class I-III. An exact match explaining all features has not been\nfound, and a plausible explanation is that a range of different temperatures\ncontribute to the observed absorption spectrum.

The differences are significant and\ncannot be due entirely to uncertainties in the assumed vertical scale-heights\nor in the assumption of constant mass-to-light ratios.

Due to the fifth force produced by the scalar field coupling,\nthe matter particles feel stronger attraction amongst each other and cluster\nmore quickly than they do in the standard LCDM model. Consequently voids in the\ncoupled scalar field theories start to develop earlier and end up bigger, which\nis confirmed by our numerical simulations. We find that a significantly larger\nportion of the whole space is under-densed in the coupled scalar field theories\nand there are more voids whose sizes exceed given thresholds. This is more\nprominent in early times because at later times the under-dense regions have\nalready been evacuated in coupled scalar field theories and there is time for\nthe LCDM model to catch up. The coupled scalar field theories also predict a\nsharper transition between voids and high density regions. All in all, the\nqualitative behaviour is different not only from the LCDM result, but also\namongst specific coupled scalar field models, making voids a potential\ncandidate to test alternative ideas about the cosmic structure formation. \n\n"}

Within each blob, we detect\nseveral Halpha sources, which roughly correspond to galaxies seen in HST\nimages. The Halpha detections show that these galaxies have large internal\nvelocity dispersions (130 - 190km/s) and that, in the one system (LAB01), their\nvelocity difference is ~440 km/s. The presence of multiple galaxies within the\nblobs, and those galaxies' large velocity dispersions and large relative\nmotion, is consistent with our previous finding that LyA blobs inhabit massive\ndark matter halos that will evolve into those typical of rich clusters today.\nTo determine whether the gas near the embedded galaxies is predominantly\ninfalling or outflowing, we compare the LyA and Halpha line centers, finding\nthat LyA is not offset (Delta LyA = +0km/s) in LAB01 and redshifted by only\n+230 km/s in LAB02. These offsets are small compared to those of Lyman break\ngalaxies, which average +450 km/s and extend to about +700 km/s. We test and\nrule out the simplest infall models and those outflow models with\nsuper/hyper-winds, which require large outflow velocities. Because of the\nunknown geometry of the gas distribution and the possibility of multiple\nsources of LyA emission embedded in the blobs, a larger sample and more\nsophisticated models are required to test more complex or a wider range of\ninfall and outflow scenarios. \n\n"}

Since there are a large number of metastable de Sitter vacua\nin string landscape, tunneling transitions to lower metastable vacua through\nthe bubble nucleation occur quite naturally. Although the deviation of Omega_0\nfrom unity is small by the observational bound, we argue that the effect of\nthis small deviation on the large angle CMB anisotropies can be significant for\ntensor-type perturbation in open inflation scenario. We consider the situation\nin which there is a large hierarchy between the energy scale of the quantum\ntunneling and that of the slow-roll inflation in the nucleated bubble. If the\npotential just after tunneling is steep enough, a rapid-roll phase appears\nbefore the slow-roll inflation. In this case the power spectrum is basically\ndetermined by the Hubble rate during the slow-roll inflation. If such\nrapid-roll phase is absent, the power spectrum keeps the memory of the high\nenergy density there in the large angular components. The amplitude of large\nangular components can be enhanced due to the effects of the wall fluctuation\nmode if the bubble wall tension is small. Therefore, one can construct some\nmodels in which the deviation of Omega_0 from unity is large enough to produce\nmeasurable effects. We also consider a more general class of models, where the\nfalse vacuum decay may occur due to Hawking-Moss tunneling, as well as the\nmodels involving more than one scalar field. We discuss scalar perturbations in\nthese models and point out that a large set of such models is already ruled out\nby observational data, unless there was a very long stage of slow-roll\ninflation after the tunneling.

This enables us to measure CO intensities with high\nsignificance as low as Ico = 0.3 K km/s (H2_SD = 1 Msun/pc2), an improvement of\nabout one order of magnitude over previous studies. We detect CO out to radii\nRgal = R25 and find the CO radial profile to follow a uniform exponential\ndecline with scale length of 0.2 R25. Comparing our sensitive CO profiles to\nmatched profiles of HI, Halpha, FUV, and IR emission at 24um and 70um, we\nobserve a tight, roughly linear relation between CO and IR intensity that does\nnot show any notable break between regions that are dominated by molecular (H2)\ngas (H2_SD > HI_SD) and those dominated by atomic gas (H2_SD < HI_SD). We use\ncombinations of FUV+24um and Halpha+24um to estimate the recent star formation\nrate (SFR) surface density, SFR_SD, and find approximately linear relations\nbetween SFR_SD and H2_SD.

These galaxy-to-galaxy\nvariations dominate the scatter in relations between CO and SFR tracers\nmeasured at large scales. The variations have the sense that less massive\ngalaxies exhibit larger ratios of SFR-to-CO than massive galaxies.

The aggregated X-ray spectra appear unlike standard sub-Eddington\naccretion state spectra which, alongside the lack of discernible variability at\nany energy, argues strongly against conventional two-component, sub-Eddington\nmodels. Although the lack of variability could be consistent with\ndisc-dominated spectra, sub-Eddington disc models are not sufficiently broad to\nexplain the observed spectra. Fits with a ~ Eddington accretion rate slim disc\nmodel are acceptable, but the fits show that the temperature decreases with\nflux, contrary to expectations, and this is accompanied by the appearance of a\nharder tail to the spectrum.

The reconstruction method is based on\nexpansions of the general interaction term and the relevant cosmological\nvariables in terms of Chebyshev polynomials which form a complete set\northonormal functions.

To show how the method works we\ndo the reconstruction of the interaction function expanding it in terms of only\nthe first six Chebyshev polynomials and obtain the best estimation for the\ncoefficients of the expansion assuming three models: (a) a DE equation of the\nstate parameter $w =-1$ (an interacting cosmological $\\Lambda$), (b) a DE\nequation of the state parameter $w =$ constant with a dark matter density\nparameter fixed, (c) a DE equation of the state parameter $w =$ constant with a\nfree constant dark matter density parameter to be estimated, and using the\nUnion2 SNe Ia data set from \"The Supernova Cosmology Project\" (SCP) composed by\n557 type Ia supernovae.

When the\nhierarchy is large, a low energy effective field theory (EFT) exists in which\nonly curvature modes participate in the dynamics of perturbations. In this EFT\nheavy fields continue to have a significant role in the low energy dynamics, as\ntheir interaction with curvature modes reduces their speed of sound whenever\nthe multi-field trajectory is subject to a sharp turn in target space. Here we\nanalyze under which general conditions this EFT remains a reliable description\nfor the linear evolution of curvature modes. We find that the main condition\nconsists on demanding that the rate of change of the turn's angular velocity\nstays suppressed with respect to the masses of heavy modes. This adiabaticity\ncondition allows the EFT to accurately describe a large variety of situations\nin which the multi-field trajectory is subject to sharp turns. To test this, we\nanalyze several models with turns and show that, indeed, the power spectra\nobtained for both the original two-field theory and its single-field EFT are\nidentical when the adiabaticity condition is satisfied. In particular, when\nturns are sharp and sudden, they are found to generate large features in the\npower spectrum, accurately reproduced by the EFT. \n\n"}

Abstract: A significant fraction of massive stars in the Milky Way and other galaxies\nare located far from star clusters. It is known that some of these stars are\nrunaways and therefore most likely were formed in embedded clusters and then\nejected into the field because of dynamical few-body interactions or\nbinary-supernova explosions. However, there exists a group of field O stars\nwhose runaway status is difficult to prove via direct proper motion\nmeasurements or whose low space velocities and/or young ages appear to be\nincompatible with their large separation from known star clusters. The\nexistence of this group led some authors to believe that field O stars can form\nin situ. In this paper, we examine the runaway status of the best candidates\nfor isolated formation of massive stars in the Milky Way and the Magellanic\nClouds by searching for bow shocks around them, by using the new reduction of\nthe Hipparcos data, and by searching for stellar systems from which they could\noriginate within their lifetimes. We show that most of the known O stars\nthought to have formed in isolation are instead very likely runaways. We show\nalso that the field must contain a population of O stars whose low space\nvelocities and/or young ages are in apparent contradiction with the large\nseparation of these stars from their parent clusters and/or the ages of these\nclusters. These stars (the descendants of runaway massive binaries) cannot be\ntraced back to their parent clusters and therefore can be mistakenly considered\nas having formed in situ. We argue also that some field O stars could be\ndetected in optical wavelengths only because they are runaways, while their\ncousins residing in the deeply embedded parent clusters might still remain\ntotally obscured. The main conclusion of our study is that there is no\nsignificant evidence whatsoever in support of the in situ proposal on the\norigin of massive stars. \n\n"}

We discuss the processes that\nregulate the observed position of the spectral peak E_pk.

(2)\nWien zone R_P<r<R_W with Kompaneets parameter y>>1 where radiation has a\nBose-Einstein spectrum, and (3) Comptonization zone r>R_W where the radiation\nspectrum develops the high-energy tail. Besides the initial jet temperature, an\nimportant factor regulating E_pk is internal dissipation (of bulk motions and\nmagnetic energy) at large distances from the central engine. Dissipation in the\nPlanck zone reduces E_pk, and dissipation in the Wien zone increases E_pk. In\njets with sub-dominant magnetic fields, the predicted E_pk varies around 1 MeV\nup to a maximum value of about 10 MeV. If the jet carries an energetically\nimportant magnetic field, E_pk can be additionally increased by dissipation of\nmagnetic energy.

There are some systems\nshowing positive period derivatives despite the long orbital periods. We\nobserved the 2011 outburst of the WZ Sge-type dwarf nova BW Scl, and recorded\nan O-C diagram similar to those of previously known WZ Sge-type dwarf novae.\nThe WZ Sge-type dwarf nova OT J184228.1+483742 showed an unusual pattern of\ndouble outbursts composed of an outburst with early superhumps and one with\nordinary superhumps. We propose an interpretation that a very small growth rate\nof the 3:1 resonance due to an extremely low mass-ratio led to a quenching of\nthe superoutburst before the ordinary superhumps appeared. We studied ER\nUMa-type dwarf novae and found that V1159 Ori showed positive superhumps\nsimilar to ER UMa in the 1990s. The recently recognized ER UMa-type object BK\nLyn dominantly showed negative superhumps, and its behavior was very similar to\nthe present-day state of ER UMa. The pattern of period variations in AM\nCVn-type objects were very similar to short-period hydrogen-rich SU UMa-type\ndwarf novae, making them helium analogue of hydrogen-rich SU UMa-type dwarf\nnovae. SBS 1108+574, a peculiar hydrogen-rich dwarf nova below the period\nminimum, showed a very similar pattern of period variations to those of\nshort-period SU UMa-type dwarf novae. The mass-ratio derived from the detected\norbital period suggests that this secondary is a somewhat evolved star whose\nhydrogen envelope was mostly stripped during the mass-exchange. CC Scl, MASTER\nOT J072948.66+593824.4 and OT J173516.9+154708 showed only low-amplitude\nsuperhumps with complex profiles. These superhumps are likely a combination of\nclosely separated two periods. \n\n"}

We simulate the nearby\n(radius 250 pc) part of this population, corresponding to the closest ~35 000\nblack holes, using current best estimates of the mass distribution of stellar\nmass black holes combined with two models for the velocity distribution of\nstellar-mass IBH which bracket likely possibilities. We distribute this\npopulation of objects appropriately within the different phases of the ISM and\ncalculate the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate, modified by a further dimensionless\nefficiency parameter \\lambda. Assuming a simple prescription for radiatively\ninefficient accretion at low Eddington ratios, we calculate the X-ray\nluminosity of these objects, and similarly estimate the radio luminosity from\nrelations found empirically for black holes accreting at low rates.

Starting with a derivation of\nintrinsic ellipticity spectra by employing a tidal torquing model generating\ngalactic angular momenta, we model the galaxy ellipticity by assuming that the\ngalactic disk forms perpendicularly to the host halo angular momentum direction\nand derive intrinsic ellipticity E-mode and B-mode spectra from the angular\nmomentum statistics. The lensing effect on the ellipticity field is modeled by\nemploying the methodology developed in the framework of lensing of the cosmic\nmicrowave background polarisation. For EUCLID, ellipticity correlations are\naltered by lensing deflection on multipoles l>1000 by ~5% for the ellipticity\nE-modes and by ~30% for the B-modes, while a shallower survey would exhibit\nlarger changes on larger angular scales.

In extensions of the standard model allowing for the\npresence of DeltaNnu equivalent neutrinos (or dark radiation), Neff is\ngenerally >3. The canonical results are reconsidered here, revealing that a\nmeasurement of Neff>3 can be consistent with DeltaNnu=0 (dark radiation without\ndark radiation). Conversely, a measurement consistent with Neff=3 is not\ninconsistent with the presence of dark radiation (DeltaNnu>0). In particular,\nif there is a light WIMP that annihilates to photons after the SM neutrinos\nhave decoupled, the photons are heated beyond their usual heating from e+-\nannihilation, reducing the late time ratio of neutrino and photon temperatures\n(and number densities), leading to Neff<3. This opens the window for one or\nmore equivalent neutrinos, including sterile neutrinos, to be consistent with\nNeff=3. By reducing the neutrino number density at present, this allows for\nmore massive neutrinos, relaxing the current constraints on the sum of the\nneutrino masses. In contrast, if the light WIMP only couples to the SM\nneutrinos and not to the photons, its late time annihilation heats the\nneutrinos but not the photons, resulting in Neff>3 even in the absence of\nequivalent neutrinos or dark radiation. A measurement of Neff>3 is thus no\nguarantee of the presence of equivalent neutrinos or dark radiation.

We compare: (1) a self-gravity criterion (based on the local\nvirial parameter and the assumption that self-gravitating gas collapses to high\ndensity in a free-fall time), (2) a fixed density threshold, (3) a\nmolecular-gas law, (4) a temperature threshold, (5) a Jeans-instability\nrequirement, (6) a criteria that cooling times be shorter than dynamical times,\nand (7) a convergent-flow criterion. We consider these both MW-like and\nhigh-density (starburst) galaxies. With feedback present, all models produce\nidentical integrated star formation rates (SFRs), in agreement with the\nKennicutt relation. Without feedback all produce orders-of-magnitude excessive\nSFRs. This is totally dependent on feedback and independent of the SF law.\nHowever, the spatial and density distribution of SF depend strongly on the SF\ncriteria. Because cooling rates are generally fast and gas is turbulent,\ncriteria (4)-(7) are 'weak' and spread SF uniformly over the disk (above\ndensities n~0.01-0.1 cm^-3). A molecular criterion (3) localizes to higher\ndensities, but still a wide range; for Z Z_solar, it is similar to a density\nthreshold at n~1 cm^-3 (well below mean densities in the MW center or\nstarbursts). Fixed density thresholds (2) can always select the highest\ndensities, but must be adjusted for simulation resolution and galaxy\nproperties; the same threshold that works in a MW-like simulation will select\nnearly all gas in a starburst. Binding criteria (1) tend to adaptively select\nthe largest over-densities, independent of galaxy model or resolution, and\nautomatically predict clustered SF. We argue that this SF model is most\nphysically-motivated and presents significant numerical advantages in\nlarge-dynamic range simulations. \n\n"}

Abstract: The intrinsic X-ray emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is often found to be\nabsorbed over and above the column density through our own galaxy. The extra\ncomponent is usually assumed to be due to absorbing gas lying within the host\ngalaxy of the GRB itself. There is an apparent correlation between the\nequivalent column density of hydrogen, N(H,intrinsic) (assuming it to be at the\nGRB redshift), and redshift, z, with the few z>6 GRBs showing the greatest\nintrinsic column densities. We investigate the N(H,intrinsic) - z relation\nusing a large sample of Swift GRBs, as well as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nquasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energy\ndistributions of the two highest redshift GRBs. Various possible sample biases\nand systematics that might produce such a correlation are considered, and we\nconclude that the correlation is very likely to be real. This may indicate\neither an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contribution\nfrom gas along the line-of-sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) or\nintervening absorbing clouds. Employing a more realistic model for IGM\nabsorption than in previous works, we find that this may explain much of the\nobserved opacity at z>~3 providing it is not too hot, likely between 10^5 K and\n10^6.5 K, and moderately metal enriched, Z~0.2 Z_sun. This material could\ntherefore constitute the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium. However, a comparable\nlevel of absorption is also expected from the cumulative effect of intervening\ncold gas clouds, and given current uncertainties it is not possible to say\nwhich, if either, dominates. At lower redshifts, we conclude that gas in the\nhost galaxies must be the dominant contributor to the observed X-ray\nabsorption. \n\n"}

The significance of\ndetection ranges from 2 to 4 sigma, depending on which method is used. We\ninvestigate three separate approaches, which cover essentially all previous\nstudies, as well as breaking new ground. (i) Correlation of the CMB with the\nPlanck reconstructed gravitational lensing potential (for the first time). This\ndetection is made using the lensing-induced bispectrum; the correlation between\nlensing and the ISW effect has a significance close to 2.5 sigma. (ii)\nCross-correlation with tracers of LSS, yielding around 3 sigma significance,\nbased on a combination of radio (NVSS) and optical (SDSS) data. (iii) Aperture\nphotometry on stacked CMB fields at the locations of known large-scale\nstructures, which yields a 4 sigma signal when using a previously explored\ncatalogue, but shows strong discrepancies in amplitude and scale compared to\nexpectations. More recent catalogues give more moderate results, ranging from\nnegligible to 2.5 sigma at most, but with a more consistent scale and\namplitude, the latter being still slightly above what is expected from\nnumerical simulations within LCMD. Where they can be compared, these\nmeasurements are compatible with previous work using data from WMAP, which had\nalready mapped these scales to the limits of cosmic variance.

As a final step we use tracers of large-scale structure to\nfilter the CMB data, presenting maps of the ISW temperature perturbation.

A\nfluctuation power spectrum with approximately power law form is created down to\nscales of order the electron gyroradius.

This leads to the formation\nof multi-peaked velocity distribution functions with a strong parallel\ntemperature anisotropy. In a three-dimensional system, supporting the\nappropriate wave vectors, the multi-peaked distribution functions would be\nexpected to be unstable to kinetic instabilities, contributing to dissipation.\nThe proposed mechanism of anisotropy formation is also relevant to space and\nastrophysical systems where the evolution of the plasma is constrained by\nlinear temperature anisotropy instability thresholds.

The theory is constructed as follows:\nFaddeev-Popov path integral in Hamilton gauge -> factorization of classical and\nquantum variables, allowing the existence of a self-consistent system of\nequations for gravitons, ghosts and macroscopic geometry -> transition to the\none-loop approximation. The ghost sector corresponding to the Hamilton gauge\nensures of one-loop finiteness of the theory off the mass shell. The\nBogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirckwood-Yvon (BBGKY) chain for the spectral function of\ngravitons renormalized by ghosts is used to build a self-consistent theory of\ngravitons in the isotropic Universe. We found three exact solutions of the\nequations, consisting of BBGKY chain and macroscopic Einstein's equations. The\nsolutions describe virtual graviton, ghost, and instanton condensates and are\nreproduced at the level of exact solutions for field operators and state\nvectors. Each exact solution corresponds to a certain phase state of\ngraviton-ghost substratum. We establish conditions under which a continuous\nquantum-gravity phase transitions occur between different phases of the\ngraviton-ghost condensate. \n\n"}

Comparing modified stellar evolution sequences with\nobservations provides some of the most restrictive limits on axions and other\nhypothetical low-mass particles and on non-standard neutrino properties. In\nparticular, a putative neutrino magnetic dipole moment mu_nu enhances the\nplasmon decay process, postpones helium ignition in low-mass stars, and\ntherefore extends the red-giant branch (RGB) in globular clusters (GCs). The\nbrightness of the tip of the RGB (TRGB) remains the most sensitive probe for\nmu_nu and we revisit this argument from a modern perspective. Based on a large\nset of archival observations, we provide high-precision photometry for the\nGalactic GC M5 (NGC5904) and carefully determine its TRGB position. On the\ntheoretical side, we add the extra plasmon decay rate brought about by mu_nu to\nthe Princeton-Goddard-PUC stellar evolution code. Different sources of\nuncertainty are critically examined. The main source of systematic uncertainty\nis the bolometric correction and the main statistical uncertainty derives from\nthe distance modulus based on main-sequence fitting. (Other measures of\ndistance, e.g., the brightness of RR Lyrae stars, are influenced by the energy\nloss that we wish to constrain.) The statistical uncertainty of the TRGB\nposition relative to the brightest RGB star is less important because the RGB\nis well populated. We infer an absolute I-band brightness of M_I=-4.17+/-0.13\nmag for the TRGB compared with the theoretical prediction of -3.99+/-0.07 mag,\nin reasonable agreement with each other. A significant brightness increase\ncaused by neutrino dipole moments is constrained such that\nmu_nu<2.6x10^-12mu_B(68% CL), where mu_B is the Bohr magneton, and\nmu_nu<4.5x10^-12 mu_B(95% CL).

The observed energy density of this\nbackground will therefore appear anisotropic at different angles in the sky.

These degeneracies cannot be broken by the CMB constraint on the\neffective number of neutrinos, N_eff. However, big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN)\nis affected by a light WIMP and equivalent neutrinos, so the combination of BBN\nand CMB can break some of the degeneracies.

As in previous simulations, following the partial emergence of\nthe sub-surface flux into the corona, a combination of vortical motions and\ninternal magnetic reconnection forms a coronal flux rope. Then, in the\nsimulations presented here, external reconnection between the emerging field\nand the pre-existing dipole coronal field allows further expansion of the\ncoronal flux rope into the corona. After sufficient expansion, internal\nreconnection occurs beneath the coronal flux rope axis, and the flux rope\nerupts up to the top boundary of the simulation domain ($\\sim$ 36 Mm above the\nsurface). We find that the presence of a pre-existing field, orientated in a\ndirection to facilitate reconnection with the emerging field, is vital to the\nfast rise of the coronal flux rope.

The fitting to this excess\ndefines the centre of the green-valley in the local universe to be $(u-r)_{0.1}\n= -0.121M_{r,0.1}-0.061$. The fraction of blue cloud and red sequence galaxies\nturns over around $M_{r,0.1} \\sim -20.1$ mag, corresponding to stellar mass of\n$3\\times10^{10}M_\\odot$.

Therefore, conformity manifestly\nviolates the widely adopted assumption that the dark matter halo mass Mvir\nexclusively governs galaxy occupation statistics.

Such processes are generically present in\nmulti-component DM scenarios or those with non-minimal DM stabilization\nsymmetries.

Super-AGB stars are expected to\nhave slow winds with high mass-loss rates, so their wind density is high. The\nexplosions of super-AGB stars are therefore presumed to occur in this dense\nwind. We provide the first synthetic light curves (LCs) for such events by\nexploding realistic electron-capture supernova (ecSN) progenitors within their\nsuper-AGB winds. We find that the early LC, i.e. before the recombination wave\nreaches the bottom of the H-rich envelope of SN ejecta (the plateau phase), is\nnot affected by the dense wind. However, after the plateau phase, the\nluminosity remains higher when the super-AGB wind is taken into account. We\ncompare our results to the historical LC of SN 1054, the progenitor of the Crab\nNebula, and show that the explosion of an ecSN within an ordinary super-AGB\nwind can explain the LC features. We conclude that SN 1054 could have been a\nType IIn SN without any extra extreme mass loss which was previously suggested\nto be necessary to account for its early high luminosity. We also show that our\nLCs match Type IIn SNe with an early plateau phase (`Type IIn-P') and suggest\nthat they are ecSNe within super-AGB winds. Although some ecSNe can be bright\nin the optical spectral range due to the large progenitor radius, their X-ray\nluminosity from the interaction does not necessarily get as bright as other\nType IIn SNe whose optical luminosities are also powered by the interaction.\nThus, we suggest that optically-bright X-ray-faint Type IIn SNe can emerge from\necSNe. Optically-faint Type IIn SNe, such as SN 2008S, can also originate from\necSNe if their H-rich envelope masses are small.

Interestingly, the\ndifference is due to the high frequency of mergers in the non-HBLR sample,\nseven versus only one in the control sample, while also they present a high\nnumber of hosts with signs of peculiar morphology. In sharp contrast, the HBLR\nsample is consistent with its control sample and furthermore, the number of\ntheir host galaxies that present peculiar morphology, which probably implies\nsome level of interactions or merging in the past, is the lowest in all four\ngalaxy samples.

Using a sample of ~10,000 kinematically-unbiased red-clump\nstars with ~5% distance accuracy as tracers, the [alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]\ndistribution of this sample exhibits a bimodality in [alpha/Fe] at intermediate\nmetallicities, -0.9<[Fe/H]<-0.2, but at higher metallicities ([Fe/H]=+0.2) the\ntwo sequences smoothly merge. We investigate the effects of the APOGEE\nselection function and volume filling fraction and find that these have little\nqualitative impact on the alpha-element abundance patterns. The described\nabundance pattern is found throughout the range 5<R<11 kpc and 0<|Z|<2 kpc\nacross the Galaxy. The [alpha/Fe] trend of the high-alpha sequence is\nsurprisingly constant throughout the Galaxy, with little variation from region\nto region (~10%).

Using the D3PO inference algorithm, we model the\nobserved photon counts as the sum of a diffuse and a point-like photon flux,\nconvolved with the instrumental beam and subject to Poissonian shot noise.

The non-parametric reconstruction uncovers the morphology of the\ndiffuse photon flux up to several hundred GeV. We present an all-sky spectral\nindex map for the diffuse component.

However, comparing the predictions of planet-disk\ninteraction models to the observed features has shown far from perfect\nagreement.

The energy release and particle acceleration during\nreconnection have been proposed as a mechanism for producing high-energy\nemissions and cosmic rays. We carry out two- and three-dimensional kinetic\nsimulations to investigate relativistic magnetic reconnection and the\nassociated particle acceleration. The simulations focus on electron-positron\nplasmas starting with a magnetically dominated, force-free current sheet\n($\\sigma \\equiv B^2/(4\\pi n_e m_e c^2) \\gg 1$). For this limit, we demonstrate\nthat relativistic reconnection is highly efficient at accelerating particles\nthrough a first-order Fermi process accomplished by the curvature drift of\nparticles along the electric field induced by the relativistic flows. This\nmechanism gives rise to the formation of hard power-law spectra $f \\propto\n(\\gamma-1)^{-p}$ and approaches $p = 1$ for sufficiently large $\\sigma$ and\nsystem size. Eventually most of the available magnetic free energy is converted\ninto nonthermal particle kinetic energy. An analytic model is presented to\nexplain the key results and predict a general condition for the formation of\npower-law distributions. The development of reconnection in these regimes leads\nto relativistic inflow and outflow speeds and enhanced reconnection rates\nrelative to non-relativistic regimes. In the three-dimensional simulation, the\ninterplay between secondary kink and tearing instabilities leads to strong\nmagnetic turbulence, but does not significantly change the energy conversion,\nreconnection rate, or particle acceleration. This study suggests that\nrelativistic reconnection sites are strong sources of nonthermal particles,\nwhich may have important implications to a variety of high-energy astrophysical\nproblems. \n\n"}

Abstract: IceCube has reported the detection of a diffuse TeV-PeV neutrino emission,\nfor which the flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) have been proposed to be the\ncandidate sources. Here we assume that the neutrino flux from FSRQs is\nproportional to their gamma-ray ones, and obtain the gamma-ray/neutrino flux\nratio by the diffuse gamma-ray flux from Fermi-LAT measurement of FSRQs and the\ndiffuse neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We apply this ratio to individual\nFSRQs and hence predict their neutrino flux. We find that a large fraction of\ncandidate FSRQs from the northern sky in the IceCube point source search has\npredicted neutrino flux above the IceCube upper limit; and for the sample of\nstacking search for neutrinos by IceCube, the predicted stacked flux is even\nlarger than the upper limit of stacked flux by orders of magnitude. Therefore\nthe IceCube limit from stacking searches, combined with the Fermi-LAT\nobservations, already rejects FSRQs as the main sources of IceCube-detected\ndiffuse neutrinos: FSRQs can only account for <10% (4%) of the IceCube-detected\ndiffuse neutrino flux, according to the stacking searches from the whole\n(northern) sky.

Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are\nsufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using\nonly the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,\norder-of-magnitude errors. \n\n"}

A stationary thermally unstable spherical\ndiffuse atomic cloud with uniform density in pressure equilibrium with low\ndensity surroundings was seeded with random density variations and allowed to\nevolve. A range of magnetic field strengths threading the cloud have been\nexplored, from beta=0.1 to beta=1.0 to the zero magnetic field case\n(beta=infinity), where beta is the ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic\npressure. Once the density inhomogeneities had developed to the point where\ngravity started to become important, self-gravity was introduced to the\nsimulation. With no magnetic field, clouds and clumps form within the cloud\nwith aspect ratios of around unity, whereas in the presence of a relatively\nstrong field (beta=0.1) these become filaments, then evolve into interconnected\ncorrugated sheets that are predominantly perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nWith magnetic and thermal pressure equality (beta=1.0), filaments, clouds and\nclumps are formed.

We\ninvestigate different diffusion strengths, by changing the pre-factor of the\ndiffusion coefficient, by varying how the diffusion coefficient is calculated\nfrom the local velocity distribution, and by varying whether the speed of sound\nis included as a velocity term. Stronger diffusion produces a tighter\n[O/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution in the gas, and cuts off the gas metallicity\ndistribution function at lower metallicities. Diffusion suppresses the\nformation of low-metallicity stars, even with weak diffusion, and also strips\nmetals from enriched outflows.

The existence of this desert is similar to the\nappearance of the so-called brown-dwarf desert that suggests different\nformation mechanisms of planets and stellar companions with short orbital\nperiods. Similarly, the Neptunian desert might indicate different mechanisms of\nformation and evolution for hot Jupiters and short-period super-Earths. We here\nfollow a previous study and examine the location and shape of the desert in\nboth the period-mass and period-radius planes, using the currently available\nlarge samples of planets. The desert in the period-mass plane has a relatively\nsharp upper edge, with a planetary mass that is inversely proportional to the\nplanetary orbital period, while the lower, somewhat blurred, boundary is\nlocated along masses that are apparently linearly proportional to the period.\nThe desert in the period-radius plane of the transiting planets is less clear.\nIt seems as if the radius along the upper boundary is inversely proportional to\nthe period to the power of one-third, while the lower boundary shows a radius\nthat is proportional to the period to the power of two-thirds.

Specifically, pure thermal feedback results in excessive\ncondensation and smothering of the AGN by cold gas because the feedback energy\ndoes not propagate to large enough radii. We do not see large differences\nbetween implementations of different triggering mechanisms, as long as the\nspatial resolution is sufficiently high, probably because all of the\nimplementations tested here trigger strong AGN feedback under similar\nconditions.

The production of helium can be\nenhanced in such a \"simmering universe\" by boosting the baryon to photon ratio,\nalthough more than an order of magnitude increase is required to bring the\nhelium mass fraction into accordance with observations. However, in this\nscenario, the prolonged period of nucleosynthesis results of the efficient\ncooking of lighter into heavier elements, impacting the resultant abundances of\nall elements so that, other than hydrogen and helium, there are virtually no\nlight elements present in the universe. Without the addition of substantial new\nphysics in the early universe, it is difficult to see how the Rh = ct universe\ncan be considered a viable cosmological model. \n\n"}

The presence, composition, and geometry of\ncircumstellar matter may hint at the elusive progenitor system of SNe Ia and\ncould also affect the observed reddening law. To date, there are few known\ncases of time-varying Na I D absorption in SNe Ia, all of which occurred during\nrelatively late phases of the supernova evolution. Photoionisation, however, is\npredicted to occur during the early phases of SNe Ia, when the supernova peaks\nin the ultraviolet.

The correlations considered include the matter\ndensity-intrinsic ellipticity (mI), galaxy density-intrinsic ellipticity (dI),\ngravitational shear-intrinsic ellipticity (GI), and intrinsic\nellipticity-intrinsic ellipticity (II) correlations. We find stronger\ncorrelations for more massive and more luminous galaxies, as well as for\nearlier photometric types, in agreement with observations. Moreover, the\ncorrelations significantly depend on the choice of shape estimator, even if\ncalibrated to serve as unbiased shear estimators. In particular, shape\nestimators that down-weight the outer parts of galaxy images produce much\nweaker IA signals on intermediate and large scales than methods employing flat\nradial weights.

To understand the impact of these\ncharacteristics on the solar chromosphere and coronal dynamics, images from a\nwide wavelength range are needed. In this work we use the 17~GHz radio\ncontinuum, formed in the upper chromosphere and the EUV lines 304 and\n171~{\\AA}, that come from the transition region (He II) and the corona (Fe IX,\nX), respectively. We analyze daily images at 304 and 171~{\\AA} obtained by the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). The 17~GHz maps were obtained by the\nNobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH). To construct synoptic limb charts, we\ncalculated the mean emission of delimited limb areas with 100\" wide and angular\nseparation of $5^\\circ$. At the equatorial region, the results show an\nhemispheric asymmetry of the solar activity. The northern hemisphere dominance\nis coincident with the first sunspot number peak, whereas the second peak\noccurs concurrently with the increase in the activity at the south. The polar\nemission reflects the presence of coronal holes at both EUV wavelengths,\nmoreover, the 17~GHz polar brightenings can be associated with the coronal\nholes. Until 2013, both EUV coronal holes and radio polar brightenings were\nmore predominant at the south pole.

The pipeline detected 128 signals, and the weakest signal\ninjected and detected has a GW strain amplitude of ~10^-24, assuming one month\nof gapless data collected by a single advanced detector. We also provide\nsensitivity estimations, which show that, for a single- detector data covering\none month of observation time, depending on the source orbital Doppler\nmodulation, we can detect signals with an amplitude of ~7x10^-25. By using\nthree detectors, and one year of data, we would easily gain more than a factor\n3 in sensitivity, translating into being able to detect weaker signals.

We replace the\nstandard synchrotron process by the more general magneto-bremsstrahlung (MBS).\nSignificant differences in the energy flux appear at low radio frequencies when\nconsidering MBS instead of the standard synchrotron emission. A drop in the\nspectrum appears in the all the radio band and a prominent valley between the\ninfrared and soft X-rays bands when a hybrid EED is considered, instead of a\npower-law EED. In the $\\gamma$-ray band an EED of mostly thermal particles\ndisplays significant differences with respect to the one dominated by\nnon-thermal particles.

Using N-body simulation we find that halo spin\nwith its environment evolves continuously from sheet to cluster, and the flip\nof halo spin happens both in filament and nodes. For the flip in filament can\nbe explained by halo formation time and the migrating time when its environment\nchanges from sheet to filament.

The velocities\nof the molecular gas in both observations and our simulations fall in the range\nof $100-400$ km/s, much lower than expected if they fall from a few tens of kpc\nballistically. If the intra-cluster medium (ICM) is at rest, the ram pressure\nof the ICM only slightly reduces the velocity of the clouds. When we assume\nthat the clouds are actually \"fluffier\" because they are co-moving with a\nwarm-hot layer, the velocity becomes smaller. If we also consider the AGN wind\nin the cluster center by adding a wind profile measured from the simulation,\nthe clouds are further slowed down at small radii, and the resulting velocities\nare in general agreement with the observations and simulations.

We examine the 2D stellar\nand ionised gas kinematics of dusty ETGs using IFS observations from the SAMI\ngalaxy survey, and integrated star-formation rates, stellar masses, and dust\nmasses from the GAMA survey. Only 8% (4/49) of visually-classified ETGs are\nkinematically consistent with being dispersion-supported systems.

The\nmodel is a kinetic analog of the Kraichnan-Batchelor model of chaotic\nadvection. The solution of the model is found in Fourier-Hermite space and\nshows that the free-energy flux from low to high Hermite moments is suppressed,\nwith phase mixing cancelled on average by anti-phase-mixing (stochastic plasma\necho). This implies that Landau damping is an ineffective route to dissipation\n(i.e., to thermalisation of electric energy via velocity space). The full\nFourier-Hermite spectrum is derived.

For a soft EOS which supports a low $M_{\\rm max}$,\nthe merger undergoes a prompt collapse accompanied by a small quantity of\nshock-heated or disk wind ejecta, inconsistent with the large quantity $\\gtrsim\n10^{-2}M_{\\odot}$ of lanthanide-free ejecta inferred from the KN. On the other\nhand, if $M_{\\rm max}$ is sufficiently large, then the merger product is a\nrapidly-rotating supramassive NS (SMNS), which must spin-down before collapsing\ninto a black hole. A fraction of the enormous rotational energy necessarily\nreleased by the SMNS during this process is transferred to the ejecta, either\ninto the GRB jet (energy $E_{\\rm GRB}$) or the KN ejecta (energy $E_{\\rm ej}$),\nalso inconsistent with observations. By combining the total binary mass of\nGW170817 inferred from the GW signal with conservative upper limits on $E_{\\rm\nGRB}$ and $E_{\\rm ej}$ from EM observations, we constrain the likelihood\nprobability of a wide-range of previously-allowed EOS. These two constraints\ndelineate an allowed region of the $M_{\\rm max}-R_{\\rm ns}$ parameter space,\nwhich once marginalized over NS radius places an upper limit of $M_{\\rm max}\n\\lesssim 2.17M_{\\odot}$ (90\\%), which is tighter or arguably less\nmodel-dependent than other current constraints. \n\n"}

At 13.5 kpc from the galaxy, optical filaments with recent star\nformation lie along the radio-jet direction. It is a testbed region for\npositive feedback (jet-induced star formation). APEX revealed strong CO\nemission in star-forming regions but also in regions with no detected tracers\nof star formation. When observed, star formation appears to be inefficient\ncompared to the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.\n  We used ALMA to map the 12CO(1-0) emission all along the filaments at 1.3\"~\n23.8 pc resolution. The CO emission is clumpy and distributed in two main\nstructures: (i) the Horseshoe complex, outside the HI cloud, where gas is\nmostly excited by shocks and no star formation is observed; (ii) the Vertical\nfilament, at the edge of the HI shell, which is a region of moderate star\nformation.\n  We identified 140 molecular clouds. A statistical study reveals that they\nhave very similar physical properties that in the inner Milky Way. However, the\nrange of radius available with the present observations does not enable to\ninvestigate whether the clouds follow the Larson relation or not. The large\nvirial parameter of the clouds suggests that gravity is not dominant.\n  Finally, the total energy injection in the filaments is of the same order as\nin the inner part of the Milky Way. The strong CO emission detected in the\nfilaments is an indication that the energy injected by the jet acts positively\nin the formation of dense molecular gas. The relatively high virial parameter\nof the molecular clouds suggests that the injected kinetic energy is too strong\nfor star formation to be efficient. This is particularly the case in the\nHorseshoe complex where the virial parameter is the largest and where strong CO\nis detected with no associated star formation.

The origin of this emission is debated, with\nproposed explanations including supernova shock breakout, emission from a\ncocoon surrounding the jet, as well as emission from the jet itself. A larger\nsample of detections is needed in order to place constraints on these different\nmodels.

These observations raise critical\nquestions about the fundamental nature of the circulation, its time\nvariability, and the overall relationship to the circulation on Jupiter and\nSaturn.

These oscillations, dubbed the Quasi\nQuadrennial Oscillation (QQO) for Jupiter and the Semi-Annual Oscillation (SAO)\non Saturn, are thought to be analogous to the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO)\non Earth, which is driven by upward propagation of equatorial waves from the\ntroposphere.

While the\nconnected covariance only becomes important on small scales, the disconnected\ncovariance is dominant on large scales, where the survey window has a\nsignificant impact. In this work, we develop an analytical method to compute\nthe disconnected covariance, accounting for the window effect. Derived under\nthe flat-sky approximation, our formalism is applicable to wide surveys by\nswapping in the curved-sky window functions. Our method works for both the\npower spectrum and the correlation function, and applies to the covariances of\nvarious probes including the multipoles and the wedges of 3D clustering, the\nangular and the projected statistics of clustering and shear, as well as the\ncross covariances between different probes. We verify the analytic covariance\nagainst the sample covariance from the galaxy mock simulations in two test\ncases: (1) the power spectrum multipole covariance, and (2) the joint\ncovariance of the projected correlation function and the correlation function\nmultipoles. Our method achieve good agreement with the mocks, while at a\nnegligible computational cost.

Due to the low\ntemperatures in regions of star formation, these isotopologues are enhanced to\nsignificant levels, making detections of multiply-deuterated species possible.\nHowever, for complex organic species, only the multiply-deuterated variants of\nmethanol and methyl cyanide have been reported so far.

We use ALMA observations from the Protostellar Interferometric Line\nSurvey (PILS) of the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422, in the spectral range\nof 329.1 GHz to 362.9 GHz. We report the first detection of doubly-deuterated\nmethyl formate CHD2OCHO in the ISM. The D/H ratio of CHD2OCHO is found to be\n2-3 times higher than the D/H ratio of CH2DOCHO for both sources, similar to\nthe results for formaldehyde from the same dataset. The observations are\ncompared to a gas-grain chemical network coupled to a dynamical physical model,\ntracing the evolution of a molecular cloud until the end of the Class 0\nprotostellar stage. The overall D/H ratio enhancements found in the\nobservations are of the same order of magnitude as the predictions from the\nmodel for the early stages of Class 0 protostars. However, the higher D/H ratio\nof CHD2OCHO compared to the D/H ratio of CH2DOCHO is still not predicted by the\nmodel. This suggests that a mechanism is enhancing the D/H ratio of singly- and\ndoubly-deuterated methyl formate that is not in the model, e.g. mechanisms for\nH-D substitutions. \n\n"}

It opens up the exciting possibility of detecting and\ncharacterizing magnetic fields and grain growth in disks around young stellar\nobjects. However, to use polarization for probing the disk properties, its\nproduction mechanism must be ascertained first. To date, the conventional\nmechanism involving magnetically aligned grains fails to explain the\npolarization patterns detected in most disks. This is especially true for the\ninclined disk of HL Tau in ALMA Band 3 (wavelength $\\sim 3$ mm), which has an\nelliptical polarization pattern. The elliptical pattern was taken as evidence\nfor polarized emission by dust grains aligned with their long axes\nperpendicular the direction of the radiative flux. We show that the radiatively\naligned grains produce a circular, rather than elliptical, polarization pattern\neven in inclined disks such as HL Tau. An elliptical polarization pattern can\nbe produced if the grains are aligned aerodynamically by the difference in\nrotation speed between the dust and gas through the Gold mechanism. However, a\nstrong azimuthal variation in polarized intensity is expected for both the\nradiative and aerodynamic alignment, but not observed in the HL Tau disk in\nALMA Band 3.

We find that the analytical estimate based on\nthe tidally perturbed 2-body system strongly overestimates the present merger\nrate when PBHs comprise all dark matter, as most initial binaries are disrupted\nby the surrounding PBHs.

Changing the simulation domain size, we find that\nthe ion response varies greatly. For reconnecting regions with scales\ncomparable to the ion Larmor radius, the ions do not respond to the\nreconnection dynamics leading to ''electron-only'' reconnection with very large\nquasi-steady reconnection rates. The transition to more traditional\n''ion-coupled'' reconnection is gradual as the reconnection domain size\nincreases, with the ions becoming frozen-in in the exhaust when the magnetic\nisland width in the normal direction reaches many ion inertial lengths. During\nthis transition, the quasi-steady reconnection rate decreases until the ions\nare fully coupled, ultimately reaching an asymptotic value. The scaling of the\nion outflow velocity with exhaust width during this electron-only to\nion-coupled transition is found to be consistent with a theoretical model of a\nnewly reconnected field line. In order to have a fully frozen-in ion exhaust\nwith ion flows comparable to the reconnection Alfv\\'en speed, an exhaust width\nof at least several ion inertial lengths is needed.

Calculations of the present PBH evaporation rate have traditionally\nassumed that the PBH mass function varies as $M_{{\\rm BH}}^{-5/2}$. This mass\nfunction only arises if the density perturbations from which the PBHs form have\na scale invariant power spectrum. It is now known that for a scale invariant\npower spectrum, normalised to COBE on large scales, the PBH density is\ncompletely negligible, so that this mass function is cosmologically irrelevant.\nFor non-scale-invariant power spectra, if all PBHs which form at given epoch\nhave a fixed mass then the PBH mass function is sharply peaked around that\nmass, whilst if the PBH mass depends on the size of the density perturbation\nfrom which it forms, as is expected when critical phenomena are taken into\naccount, then the PBH mass function will be far broader than $ M_{{\\rm\nBH}}^{-5/2}$. In this paper we calculate the present day PBH evaporation rate,\nusing constraints from the diffuse gamma-ray background, for both of these mass\nfunctions. If the PBH mass function has significant finite width, as recent\nnumerical simulations suggest, then it is not possible to produce a present day\nPBH evaporation rate comparable with the observed short period gamma-ray burst\nrate.

Derivation of spectral and temporal indices of an adiabatic\nblast wave decelerating in a uniform surrounding medium in the limiting case of\na nonrelativistic reverse shock, both for spherical and collimated outflows, is\npresented as an example of the general theory. External shock model fits for\nthe afterglow lead to the conclusion that GRB outflows are jetted. The external\nshock model also explains the temporal duration distribution and clustering of\npeak energies in prompt spectra of long-duration GRBs, from which the redshift\ndependence of the GRB source rate density can be derived.

Follow-up optical spectra have been obtained for ~900 of these objects. A\nthree step process is used to obtain metal abundances for these galaxies.

Using secondary metallicity indicators R_23 and p_3,\nwe calculate metallicities for an additional 59 galaxies with spectra that\ncover a similar wavelength range but lack [OIII]4363. The results are used to\ncalibrate relations between metallicity and two readily observed emission-line\nratios, which allow us to estimate coarse metallicities for 519 galaxies in\ntotal.

Since a Type Ia supernova ejects $\\sim$ 10 times more iron than a\nType II supernova, [Fe/H] of the non-merger component tends to be higher than\nthat of the merger component, which widens the metallicity distribution\nfunction. From these results, we suggest that the Galactic bulge consists of\ntwo chemically different components; one has formed quickly through the\nsub-galactic clump merger in the proto-galaxy and the other has formed\ngradually in the inner disk. \n\n"}

We first obtained a series of solutions for equations describing\nnon-rotating spherically symmetric flows and confirmed the results of preceding\npapers that, for a given mass accretion rate, there is a critical luminosity of\nirradiating neutrinos, above which there exists no steady solution. Below the\ncritical value, we found two branches of solutions; one is stable and the other\nis unstable against radial perturbations. With a simple argument based on the\nRiemann problem, we can identify the critical luminosity as the one, at which\nthe stalled shock revives. We also obtained the condition satisfied by the flow\nvelocity for the critical luminosity, which can be easily applied to the\nrotational case. If a collapsing star rotates, the accretion flow is\nnon-spherical due to centrifugal forces. Flows are accelerated near the\nrotation axis whereas they are decelerated near the equatorial plane. As a\nresult, the critical luminosity is lowered, that is, rotation assists the\nrevival of a stalled shock. According to our calculations, the critical\nluminosity is $\\sim25$% lower for the mass accretion rate of 1M$_{\\odot}$/sec\nand the rotation frequency of 0.1 Hz at a radius of 1000 km than that of the\nspherically symmetric flow with the same mass accretion rate.

These models reproduce very\nwell observations during the early stages of the evolution (in particular WR\npopulations and ratio between type II and type Ib,c at different metallicities,\nsee Meynet & Maeder 2005).\n  Our models predict the production of fast rotating black holes. Models with\nlarge initial masses or high metallicity end their life with less angular\nmomentum in their central remnant with respect to the break-up limit for the\nremnant. Many WR star models satisfy the three main criteria (black hole\nformation, loss of hydrogen-rich envelope and enough angular momentum to form\nan accretion disk around the black hole) for gamma-ray bursts (GRB) production\nvia the collapsar model (Woosley 1993).

In this paper we apply statistical tests, the chi-square test and the\nF-test, to the Cepheid data from the MACHO project to test for a non-linearity\nof the V- and R-band PL relations at 10 days, and extend these tests to the\nnear infrared (JHK-band) PL relations with 2MASS data. We correct the\nextinction for these data by applying an extinction map towards the LMC. The\nstatistical test we use, the F-test, is able to take account of small numbers\nof data points and the nature of that data on either side of the period cut at\n10 days. With our data, the results we obtained imply that the VRJH-band PL\nrelations are non-linear around a period of 10 days, while the K-band PL\nrelation is (marginally) consistent with a single-line regression. The choice\nof a period of 10 days, around which this non-linearity occurs, is consistent\nwith the results obtained when this \"break\" period is estimated from the data.\nLong period Cepheids are supplemented from the literature to increase our\nsample size.

Increasing the number of SNe\nhelps reduce the first type of error but not the second. The coherent component\nhas been largely ignored in forecasts of dark energy parameter estimation from\nupcoming SN surveys. For instance it is commonly thought, based on Poissonian\nconsiderations, that peculiar motion is unimportant, even for a low redshift SN\nsurvey such as the Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory; z = 0.03 - 0.08), which\nprovides a useful anchor for future high redshift surveys by determining the SN\nzero-point. We show that ignoring coherent peculiar motion leads to an\nunderestimate of the zero-point error by about a factor of 2, despite the fact\nthat SNfactory covers almost half of the sky. More generally, there are four\ntypes of fluctuations: peculiar motion, gravitational lensing, gravitational\nredshift and what is akin to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Peculiar motion\nand lensing dominates at low and high redshifts respectively. Taking into\naccount all significant luminosity distance fluctuations due to large scale\nstructure leads to a degradation of up to 60% in the determination of the dark\nenergy equation of state from upcoming high redshift SN surveys, when used in\nconjunction with a low redshift anchor such as the SNfactory. The most relevant\nfluctuations are the coherent ones due to peculiar motion and the Poissonian\nones due to lensing, with peculiar motion playing the dominant role.

Recently, a novel\nmodel-independent method for the estimation of CMB angular power spectrum from\nmulti-frequency observations has been proposed and implemented on the first\nyear WMAP (WMAP-1) data by Saha et al.~2006. We review the results from WMAP-1\nand also present the new angular power spectrum based on three years of the\nWMAP data (WMAP-3). Previous estimates have depended on foreground templates\nbuilt using extraneous observational input to remove foreground contamination.\nThis is the first demonstration that the CMB angular spectrum can be reliably\nestimated with precision from a self contained analysis of the WMAP data. The\nprimary product of WMAP are the observations of CMB in 10 independent\ndifference assemblies (DA) distributed over 5 frequency bands that have\nuncorrelated noise. Our method utilizes maximum information available within\nWMAP data by linearly combining DA maps from different frequencies to remove\nforegrounds and estimating the power spectrum from the 24 cross power spectra\nof clean maps that have independent noise. An important merit of the method is\nthat the expected residual power from unresolved point sources is significantly\ntempered to a constant offset at large multipoles (in contrast to the ~l^2\ncontribution expected from a Poisson distribution) leading to a small\ncorrection at large multipoles.

Here we report on precision timing observations taken over the 2.5\nyears since its discovery and present four independent strong-field tests of\ngeneral relativity.

Secondly, we\nsolve the initial-value problem by simulating the sudden release of an\ninitially strained crust and monitoring the subsequent crustal motion. We find\nthat the crustal torsional modes quickly exchange their energy with the MHD\ncontinuum in the core, and decay by several orders of magnitude over the course\nof about 10 oscillation periods. After the initial rapid decay, the crustal\nmotion is stabilized and several time-varying QPOs are observed. The dynamical\nspectrum of the simulated crustal motion is in qualitative agreement with that\nof the x-ray light-curve in the tail of a giant magnetar flare.

The\nanalysis is based on photometry obtained with the Wide Field Imager at the 2.2m\ntelescope at La Silla for several fields near the probable center of the\nover-density. A modified version of the MATCH software package was applied to\nfit the observed CMDs, enabling us to constrain the properties of the old and\nyoung stellar populations that appear to be present. For the old population we\nfind [Fe/H]~-1.0, a distance of ~7.5 kpc and a line-of-sight depth sigma_los of\n1.5+-0.2 kpc and a characteristic age range of 3-6 Gyrs. However, the spread in\nages and the possible presence of a ~10 Gyr old population cannot be\nconstrained. The young main-sequence is found to have an age spread; ages must\nrange from a few hundred Myr to 2 Gyr. Because of the degeneracy between\ndistance and metallicity in CMDs the estimates of these parameters are strongly\ncorrelated and two scenarios are consistent with the data: if the young stars\nhave a similar metallicity to the old stars, they are equidistant and therefore\nco-spatial with the old stars; if the young stars have close to solar\nmetallicity they are more distant (~9 kpc).

Upon initiating deep contact in our baseline\nsimulation, the mass transfer rate grows by more than an order of magnitude\nover approximately ten orbits, as would be expected for dynamically unstable\nmass transfer. However, the mass transfer rate then reaches a peak value, the\nbinary expands and the mass transfer event subsides. The binary must therefore\nhave crossed the critical mass ratio for stability against dynamical mass\ntransfer. Despite the initial loss of orbital angular momentum into the spin of\nthe accreting star, we find that the accretor's spin saturates and angular\nmomentum is returned to the orbit more efficiently than has been previously\nsuspected for binaries in the direct impact accretion mode. To explore this\nsurprising result, we directly measure the critical mass ratio for stability by\nimposing artificial angular momentum loss at various rates to drive the binary\nto an equilibrium mass transfer rate. For one of these driven evolutions, we\nattain equilibrium mass transfer and deduce that effectively q_crit has evolved\nto approximately 2/3.

In this paper I propose a causal relationship between the strongly\ndecreasing densities of Lyman alpha (LyA) clouds at high redshift and the\nformation of GCs - namely that GCs were created by the accretion of LyA clouds\nonto protogalaxies. I describe a scenario which involves an inherently stable\nand orderly cycling of compression and cooling in the central cores of clouds\nduring the extended period of dissipation in the outer regins of gas-rich proto\ngalaxies, culminating in a burst of efficient star formation. I demonstrate\nthat the comoving density of GCs is comparable to that of LyA clouds at high\nredshift, that the energetic requirements for compression to core GC densities\ncan be met, and that the time-scale for cooling is within obvious limits\nimposed by dynamical stability.\n  This dissipative process requires there to be a large column of dissipated\ngas about the attractor in order to form GCs.

A jack-knife analysis of the coadded 53 and 90 GHz sky maps reveals\nthose sky pixels to which the bispectrum statistic is particularly sensitive.\nWe find that by removing data from the 53 GHz sky maps for periods of time\nduring which a known systematic effect perturbs the 31 GHz channels, the\namplitudes of the bispectrum coefficients become completely consistent with\nthat expected for a Gaussian sky. We conclude that the non-Gaussian signal\ndetected by the normalised bispectrum statistic in the publicly available DMR\nsky maps is due to a systematic artifact. The impact of removing the affected\ndata on estimates of the normalisation of simple models of cosmological\nanisotropy is negligible. \n\n"}

For $T<M_P$ this leads to decoupling of gravity from the\ninflaton dynamics.
