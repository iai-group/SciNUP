With this interaction, we\ncalculate the energy per nucleon of symmetric nuclear matter in the Brueckner\npair approximation and obtain a converged, cutoff-independent result that shows\nsaturation, but also substantial underbinding.

The influence of initial\nstate fluctuations on this observable is explored using an event-by-event\n(3+1)d hybrid approach that is based on UrQMD (Ultra-relativistic Quantum\nMolecular Dynamics) with an ideal hydrodynamic evolution. In this calculation\nmomentum conservation and elliptic flow are explicitly taken into account. The\nasymmetries in the initial state are translated to a final state momentum\nasymmetry by the hydrodynamic flow profile. Dependent on the size of the\ninitial state fluctuations the resulting charged particle asymmetries are in\nqualitative agreement with the preliminary STAR results. The multi-particle\ncorrelation as proposed by the PHENIX collaboration can in principle be used to\ndisentangle the different contributions, however is in practice substantially\naffected by the procedure to subtract trivial resonance decay contributions. \n\n"}

We demonstrate that for sufficiently\nasymmetric case and high densities the momentum distribution of the smaller\np-component is strongly deformed with protons increasingly populating the\nmomentum states beyond the Fermi surface. This result is obtained by extracting\nthe probabilities of two-nucleon (2N) SRCs from the analysis of the\nexperimental data on high momentum transfer inclusive electro-nuclear\nreactions. We fitted the extracted probabilities as a function of nuclear\ndensity and asymmetry and used the fit to estimate the fractions of the\noff-Fermi shell nucleons in the superdense nuclear matter relevant to neutron\nstars. Our results indicate that starting at three nuclear saturation densities\nthe protons with fractional densities 1/9 will populate mostly the high\nmomentum tail of the momentum distribution while only 2% of the neutrons will\ndo so.

This DM mass scale (warm DM) is in agreement with both\ncosmological and galactic observations. We study the role of a keV sterile\nneutrino through its mixing with a light active neutrino in Rhenium 187 and\nTritium beta decays. We pinpoint the energy spectrum of the beta particle, 0 <\nT_e < (Q_{beta} - m_s), as the region where a sterile neutrino could be\ndetected and where its mass m_s could be measured. This energy region is at\nleast 1 keV away rom the region suitable to measure the mass of the light\nactive neutrino, located near the endpoint Q_{beta} . The emission of a keV\nsterile neutrino in a beta decay could show up as a small kink in the spectrum\nof the emitted beta particle. With this in view, we perform a careful\ncalculation of the Rhenium and Tritium beta spectra and estimate the size of\nthis perturbation by means of the dimensionless ratio R of the sterile neutrino\nto the active neutrino contributions.

Since the anomalous\npeak exists in the dijet-mass region of 140 GeV with the p-pbar center-of-mass\nenergy sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, a relevant momentum fraction x of partons is roughly\n0.1. In this x region, recent HERMES semi-inclusive charged-lepton scattering\nexperiment indicated that the strange-quark distribution could be very\ndifferent from a conventional one, which has been used for many years, based on\nopposite-sign dimuon measurements in neutrino-induced deep inelastic\nscattering. We investigated effects of such variations in the strange-quark\ndistribution s(x) on the anomaly. We found that distributions of W+dijets and\nother process are affected by the strange-quark modifications in wide\ndijet-mass regions including the 140 GeV one. Since the CDF anomaly was\nobserved in the shoulder region of the dijet-mass distribution, a slight\nmodification of the distribution shape could explain at least partially the CDF\nexcess. Therefore, it is important to consider such effects within the standard\nmodel for judging whether the CDF anomaly indicates new physics beyond the\nstandard model.

This discrepancy has led to various, quite different\nexplanations in terms of increased axial masses, changes in the functional form\nof the axial form factor, increased vector strength in nuclei, and initial\ntwo-particle interactions. This is disconcerting since the neutrino energy\nreconstruction depends on the reaction mechanism. Purpose: We investigate\nwhether exclusive observables, such as nucleon knock-out, can be used to\ndistinguish between the various proposed reaction mechanisms. We determine the\ninfluence of 2p-2h excitations on the energy reconstruction. Method: We use the\nGiessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model to predict numbers and\nspectra of knock-out nucleons. The model is extended by incorporating a simple,\nbut realistic treatment of initial 2p-2h excitations. Results: We show numbers\nand spectra of knock-out nucleons and show their sensitivity to the presence of\n2p-2h initial excitations. We also discuss the influence of 2p-2h excitations\non the neutrino energy reconstruction. Conclusions: 2p-2h excitations do lead\nto an increase in the number $n$ of knock-out nucleons for $n \\ge 2$ while only\nthe $n=1$ knock-out remains a clean signal of true QE scattering. The spectra\nof knock-out nucleons do also change, but their qualitative shape remains as\nbefore. In the energy reconstruction 2p-2h interactions lead to a downward\nshift of the reconstructed energy; this effect of 2p-2h excitations disappears\nat higher energies because the 2p-2h influence is spread out over a wider\nenergy range. \n\n"}

The virtual photons have a non-zero mass and convert into\nlepton-antilepton pairs. Therefore, information about the quarks' spatial\ndistribution inside the meson can be extracted from the lepton-antilepton\ninvariant mass distributions by comparing the empirical results with QED\npredictions, which are based on the assumption that the meson is a point-like\nparticle. The deviation from the expected behavior in the leptonic mass\nspectrum exposes the inner structure of the meson. This deviation is\ncharacterized by a form factor.

The first property is the approximate scaling\nrelation between proton and neutron high-momentum distributions weighted by\ntheir relative fractions in the nucleus. The second property is the inverse\nproportionality of the strength of the high-momentum distribution of protons\nand neutrons to the same relative fractions.

To this aim the use of the current FNAL-Booster neutrino\nbeam for a Short-Baseline experiment has been carefully evaluated. This\nproposal refers to the use of magnetic spectrometers at two different sites,\nNear and Far. Their positions have been extensively studied, together with the\npossible performances of two OPERA-like spectrometers. The proposal is\nconstrained by availability of existing hardware and a time-schedule compatible\nwith the CERN project for a new more performant neutrino beam, which will\nnicely extend the physics results achievable at the Booster. The possible FNAL\nexperiment will allow to clarify the current $\\nu_{\\mu}$ disappearance tension\nwith $\\nu_e$ appearance and disappearance at the eV mass scale. Instead, a new\nCERN neutrino beam would allow a further span in the parameter space together\nwith a refined control of systematics and, more relevant, the measurement of\nthe antineutrino sector, by upgrading the spectrometer with detectors currently\nunder R&D study. \n\n"}

In this work we will\npresent the specific protocols developed to select bulk scintillation events in\nNaI(Tl), and its application to data obtained with the ANAIS-0 prototype.\nSlight differences in time constants are expected in scintillation pulses\nproduced by nuclear or electron recoils in NaI(Tl), so in order to analyze the\neffect of these filtering procedures in the case of a recoil population\nattributable to dark matter, data from a neutron calibration have been used. \n\n"}

We demonstrate\nthere is no trivial error cancellation, thus the flux systematic error can\nremain dominant even after the adoption of multi-detector configurations.\nHowever, three mechanisms for flux error suppression have been identified and\ncalculated in the context of Double Chooz, Daya Bay and RENO sites.

In measurements of\nthe basic weak muon capture reaction on the proton to determine the\npseudoscalar coupling g_P, capture occurs from both atomic and molecular\nstates.

Nevertheless, given the\nunprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge\nin \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ had to be improved.\n  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon\ndisappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen. By doping the hydrogen with 20 ppm\nof argon, a competing process to pp\\mu\\ formation was introduced, which allowed\nthe extraction of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ from the observed time distribution of decay\nelectrons.\n  Results: The pp\\mu\\ formation rate was measured as \\lambda_pp\\mu = (2.01 +-\n0.06(stat) +- 0.03(sys)) 10^6 s^-1.

The out-of-equilibrium description\nof strongly interacting relativistic fields is based on the theory of Kadanoff\nand Baym. For the modeling of the partonic phase we introduce a dynamical\nquasiparticle model (DQPM) for QCD in equilibrium. The widths and masses of the\nquasiparticles are controlled by transport coefficients in comparison to\nlattice QCD results. The resulting off-shell transport approach - denoted by\nParton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) - also includes covariant dynamical\nhadronization and keeps track of the hadronic interactions in the final phase.\nWe show that PHSD captures the bulk dynamics of heavy-ion collisions from SPS\nto LHC energies and provides a basis for the evaluation of the electromagnetic\nemissivity, using the same dynamical parton propagators as for the system\nevolution. Direct photon production in elementary processes and heavy-ion\nreactions at RHIC and LHC energies is investigated and the status of the photon\nv2 puzzle - a large elliptic flow of the direct photons observed in A+A\ncollisions - is addressed.

In addition to two-nucleon SRC with center of mass\nmotion we derive also the contribution of three-nucleon SRCs to the nuclear\nspectral functions.

The collectivity depends on the details of\nthe shell structure around the Fermi levels, in particular the presence of the\norbitals that have the enhanced transition matrix elements of the non-axial\nquadrupole excitation. Quite recently, a sudden decrease in the excitation\nenergy of the $\\gamma$ vibration was observed at RIKEN RIBF for the\nneutron-rich Dy isotopes at $N=106$. Purpose: In the present work, by studying\nsystematically the microscopic structure of the $\\gamma$ vibration in the\nneutron-rich Dy isotopes with $N=98-114$, we try to understand the mechanism of\nthe observed softening. Methods: The low-frequency modes of excitation in the\nneutron-rich rare-earth nuclei are described based on nuclear\ndensity-functional theory. We employ the Skyrme energy-density functionals\n(EDF) in the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculation for the ground states and in\nthe Quasiparticle Random-Phase Approximation (QRPA) for the excitations.\nResults: The lowering of the excitation energy around $N=106$ is reproduced\nwell by employing the SkM* and SLy4 functionals.

Conclusions: The microscopic framework of the Skyrme-EDF based QRPA\ndescribes well the isotopic dependence of the energy of the $\\gamma$ vibration\nin the well-deformed neutron-rich rare-earth nuclei. The strong collectivity at\n$N=108-110$ is expected as the Fermi level of neutrons lies just among the\norbitals that play an important role in generating the collectivity around\n$N=106$. \n\n"}

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are\nused to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of\nthe morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification\nmethods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency\nand accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and\ncharacterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and\nsubsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby\nimproving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We\ndemonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO's first\nobserving run. \n\n"}

The array will use water\nCherenkov detectors, as in the HAWC observatory, but combined with scintillator\ndetectors, to detect air showers induced by VHE gamma rays in the atmosphere.\nIt is being designed to attain a lower energy threshold, better energy and\nangular resolution, and improved sensitivity. The array will consist of about\n1250 small-sized (3.6 m diameter) detector units distributed over a circular\narea of about 160 m in diameter. Each detector unit will consist of a water\nCherenkov detector and a liquid scintillation detector underneath which will\npreferentially identify muons, facilitating the background (cosmic ray)\nrejection, thereby improving the sensitivity. The background rejection will be\nfurther enhanced by the close-packed arrangement and the small size of the\ndetectors which will allow a fine sampling of air-shower footprints at the\nground. In this contribution, we present the Monte-Carlo simulation of the\nexperiment performed using CORSIKA and GEANT4 simulation packages.

For gamma-gamma collisions,\nthe crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result\nfrom multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with\nthe opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector\nfield. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.\nIn this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as\nwell as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable\nreduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity.

In the\npresent work, by using the recently measured data of rapidity-dependent flows,\nwe constrain the incompressibility of nuclear matter and analyse the impact of\nmodel uncertainties on the obtained value. The method is based on the newly\nupdated version of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD)\nmodel in which the Skyrme potential energy-density functional is introduced.\nThree different Skyrme interactions which give different incompressibilities\nvarying from $K_0$=201 to 271 MeV are adopted.

Also the UCN\ntransparency of the bulk sD_2 material must be high because crystal\ninhomogeneities limit the mean free path for elastic scattering and reduce the\nextraction efficiency. Observations at the UCN sources at Paul Scherrer\nInstitute and at Los Alamos National Laboratory consistently show a decrease of\nthe UCN yield with time of operation after initial preparation or later\ntreatment (`conditioning') of the sD_2. We show that, in addition to the\nquality of the bulk sD_2, the quality of its surface is essential. Our\nobservations and simulations support the view that the surface is deteriorating\ndue to a build-up of D_2 frost-layers under pulsed operation which leads to\nstrong albedo reflections of UCN and subsequent loss. We report results of UCN\nyield measurements, temperature and pressure behavior of deuterium during\nsource operation and conditioning, and UCN transport simulations. This,\ntogether with optical observations of sD_2 frost formation on initially\ntransparent sD_2 in offline studies with pulsed heat input at the North\nCarolina State University UCN source results in a consistent description of the\nUCN yield decrease. \n\n"}

The detector operates in a surface building, with\nmodest shielding, and relies on extremely efficient online rejection of\nbackgrounds in order to identify these interactions. A novel detector design\nhas been developed using 12800 5 cm cubes for high segmentation. Each cube is\nformed of a sandwich of two scintillators, PVT and 6LiF:ZnS(Ag), allowing the\ndetection and identification of positrons and neutrons respectively. The active\nvolume of the detector is an array of cubes measuring 80x80x250 cm\n(corresponding to a fiducial mass of 1.6 T), which is read out in layers using\ntwo dimensional arrays of wavelength shifting fibres and silicon\nphotomultipliers, for a total of 3200 readout channels.

Isotopically resolved yield distributions of projectile fragments in\nthe range Z=10-36 from these reaction pairs were measured with the MARS recoil\nseparator in the angular range 2.7-5.3 degrees. The velocities of the residues,\nmonotonically decreasing with Z down to Z~26-28, are employed to characterize\nthe excitation energy. The yield ratios R21(N,Z) for each pair of systems are\nfound to exhibit isotopic scaling (isoscaling), namely, an exponential\ndependence on the fragment atomic number Z and neutron number N. The isoscaling\nis found to occur in the residue Z range corresponding to the maximum observed\nexcitation energies. The corresponding isoscaling parameters are alpha=0.43 and\nbeta=-0.50 for the Kr+Sn system and alpha=0.27 and beta=-0.34 for the Kr+Ni\nsystem. For the Kr+Sn system, for which the experimental angular acceptance\nrange lies inside the grazing angle, isoscaling was found to occur for Z<26 and\nN<34.

Abstract: A quantum mechanical model for the description of the alpha-decay of heavy\nnuclei with accompanying photons emission is presented. The model is based on a\nquantum mechanical one-particle model of alpha-decay through a decay barrier.\nThe bremsstrahlung spectrum calculation employs multipole expansion of the\nvector potential of the Coulomb field of the daughter nucleus and takes into\naccount the dependence on the angle between the directions of the\nalpha-particle propagation and the photon emission. Spectra of 210Po are\nobtained for the angles 25 and 90, and the best agreement with the experimental\ndata in the 90 case in a comparison with other existing models is achieved.\n  From the angular analysis, the model gives monotonic behavior of the\nbremsstrahlung spectrum for any value of the angle.

Abstract: The centrality dependence of (multi-)strange hadron abundances is studied for\nPb(158 AGeV)Pb reactions and compared to p(158 GeV)Pb collisions. The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity. For Omega's, the predicted enhancement can be as\nlarge as one order of magnitude. Comparisons of Pb-Pb data to proton induced\nasymmetric (p-A) collisions are hampered due to the predicted strong asymmetry\nin the various rapidity distributions of the different (strange) particle\nspecies. In p-Pb collisions, strangeness is locally (in rapidity) not\nconserved. The present comparison to the data of the WA97 and NA49\ncollaborations clearly supports the suggestion that conventional (free)\nhadronic scenarios are unable to describe the observed high (anti-)hyperon\nyields in central collisions.
