Then the measured values\nof the flavor parameters do not lead to any fundamental symmetries, but are\nstatistical accidents; their precise values do not provide any insights into\nthe fundamental theory, rather the overall pattern of flavor reflects the\nunderlying landscape. We investigate whether random selection from the\nstatistics of a simple landscape can explain the broad patterns of quark,\ncharged lepton, and neutrino masses and mixings. We propose Gaussian landscapes\nas simplified models of landscapes where Yukawa couplings result from overlap\nintegrals of zero-mode wavefunctions in higher-dimensional supersymmetric gauge\ntheories. In terms of just five free parameters, such landscapes can account\nfor all gross features of flavor, including: the hierarchy of quark and charged\nlepton masses; small quark mixing angles, with 13 mixing less than 12 and 23\nmixing; very light Majorana neutrino masses, with the solar to atmospheric\nneutrino mass ratio consistent with data; distributions for leptonic 12 and 23\nmixings that are peaked at large values, while the distribution for 13 mixing\nis peaked at low values; and order unity CP violating phases in both the quark\nand lepton sectors.

For\nexample, electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) could be triggered by a\nspontaneously broken, nearly conformal sector. The spectrum of states at the\nelectroweak scale would then contain a narrow scalar resonance, the\npseudo-Goldstone boson of conformal symmetry breaking, with Higgs-like\nproperties. If the conformal sector is strongly coupled, this pseudo-dilaton\nmay be the only new state accessible at high energy colliders. We discuss the\nprospects for distinguishing this mode from a minimal Higgs boson at the LHC\nand ILC. The main discriminants between the two scenarios are (1) cubic\nself-interactions and (2) a potential enhancement of couplings to massless SM\ngauge bosons. A particularly interesting situation arises when the scale f of\nconformal symmetry breaking is approximately the electroweak scale v~246 GeV.\nAlthough in this case the LHC may not be able to tell apart a pseudo-dilaton\nfrom the Higgs boson, the self-interactions differ in a way that depends only\non the scaling dimension of certain operators in the conformal sector.

We show that in the two generation case,\nmaximal mixing can naturally arise only when the total neutrino mass matrix has\na quasi-degenerate pattern. The best way to demonstrate this is by decomposing\nthe quasi-degenerate spectrum in to hierarchial and inverse-hierarchial mass\nmatrices, both with small mixing. Such a decomposition of the quasi-degenerate\nspectra is in fact very general and can be done irrespective of the mixing\npresent in the mass matrices. With three generations, and two sources, we show\nthat only one or all the three small mixing angles in the total neutrino mass\nmatrix can be converted to maximal/large mixing angles. The decomposition of\nthe degenerate pattern in this case is best realised in to sub-matrices whose\ndominant eigenvalues have an alternating pattern. On the other hand, it is\npossible to generate two large and one small mixing angle if either one or both\nof the sub-matrices contain maximal mixing. We present example textures of\nthis.

However, the model is not realistic given that, as a result of Lorentz\nViolation, the maximal (light-cone) speed seen by the fermions is smaller than\nthat of the massless gauge boson (which equals the speed of light in vacuo) by\nan amount which is unacceptably large to be compatible with the current tests\nof Lorentz Invariance, unless the gauge couplings assume unnaturally small\nvalues. Possible ways out of this phenomenological drawback are briefly\ndiscussed, postponing a detailed construction of more realistic models for\nfuture work. \n\n"}

One usually think that it is extremely\nimportant for the measurement of triple Higgs coupling at the high luminosity\nLHC. In this paper, we propose to search for the extra Higgs boson (denoted as\n$S$) utilizing pair production of the SM-like Higgs boson ($H$) which was\ndiscovered in July, 2012.The pair production of $H$ can be huge due to the\nresonant production of heavy scalar $S$, namely $PP \\rightarrow S \\rightarrow\nHH$. The couplings of $H$ with weak gauge boson are similar to ones in the SM\nand it implies that the couplings between $S$ and gauge bosons are likely\nsuppressed. Provided that $S$ is heavy enough, the decay into weak gauge bosons\nmay not be the dominant modes. Instead $S$ can decay into a pair of $H$ and\noffer the promising channel to discover it.

The second puzzle is that the\nsevere suppression of lepton-flavor-violating processes involving electrons,\ne.g. mu->3e, tau->e mu mu, etc., implies that generic new-physics contributions\nto lepton interactions cannot exist below O(10 - 100 TeV), whereas the 3.6sigma\ndeviation of the muon g-2 from the standard model can be explained by a\nnew-physics scale < O(1 TeV).

Specifically, we assume that composite $(B - L)$ gauge boson is\nlighter than all the others in the EW sector. We show that the composite $(B -\nL)$ gauge boson can acquire a significant coupling to light quarks simply via\nmixing with elementary hypercharge gauge boson.

After explaining the\ntheoretical conditions for producing a matter-antimatter asymmetry in the\nUniverse we detail how, through sphaleron processes, it is possible to\ntransmute a lepton asymmetry -- or, more precisely, a (B-L)-asymmetry -- into a\nbaryon asymmetry. Because Leptogenesis depends in detail on properties of the\nneutrino spectrum, we review briefly existing experimental information on\nneutrinos as well as the seesaw mechanism, which offers a theoretical\nunderstanding of why neutrinos are so light. The bulk of the review is devoted\nto a discussion of thermal Leptogenesis and we show that for the neutrino\nspectrum suggested by oscillation experiments one obtains the observed value\nfor the baryon to photon density ratio in the Universe, independently of any\ninitial boundary conditions. In the latter part of the review we consider how\nwell Leptogenesis fits with particle physics models of dark matter.

By investigating the phase structure of the\nmodel at $T \\neq 0$ we get the following observations; i) Starting from the\nperturbative calculations with the theory renormalized at an arbitrary\nmass-scale $\\mu$ and at an arbitrary temperature $T_0$, we can in principle\nfully resum terms of $O(\\lambda T/\\mu)$ together with terms of $O(\\lambda\n(T/\\mu)^2)$. The key idea is to fix the arbitrary RS-parameters so as to make\nboth of one-loop radiative corrections to the mass as well as to the coupling\nvanish, ensuring the function form of the EP to be determined up to the\nnext-to-leading order of large correction terms, thus absorbing completely\nthose terms of $O(\\lambda (T/\\mu)^2)$ and of $O(\\lambda T/\\mu)$. ii) If we\nstart from the theory renormalized at the temperature of the environment $T$,\nthe $O(\\lambda (T/\\mu)^2)$-term resummation can be simply completed through the\n$T$-renormalization itself.

We work in the Wigner SU(4)-symmetric limit\nwhere the S-wave scattering lengths {1}S{0} and {3}S{1} are equal.

We provide a simple qualitative explanation of the effect which\nshows that it is not caused predominantly by edge effects. We also show that it\nis quite insensitive to ``details'' of the unintegrated gluon distribution\nfunctions such as the presence of leading-twist shadowing and of an extended\ngeometric scaling window. The larger eccentricity increases the azimuthal\nasymmetry of high transverse momentum particles. Finally, we point out that the\nlongitudinal structure of the Color Glass Condensate initial condition for\nhydrodynamics away from midrapidity is non-trivial but requires understanding\nof large-$x$ effects. \n\n"}

In particular, at high\nQ^2, the extracted amplitude falls much slower than the predictions of the\nquark model, as a function of Q^2, a situation similar to the electroexcitation\nand decay of Delta(1232).

Abstract: Light scalar fields very naturally appear in modern cosmological models,\naffecting such parameters of Standard Model as electromagnetic fine structure\nconstant $\\alpha$, dimensionless ratios of electron or quark mass to the QCD\nscale, $m_{e,q}/\\Lambda_{QCD}$. Cosmological variations of these scalar fields\nshould occur because of drastic changes of matter composition in Universe: the\nlatest such event is rather recent (redshift $z\\sim 0.5$), from matter to dark\nenergy domination. In a two-brane model (we use as a pedagogical example) these\nmodifications are due to changing distance to \"the second brane\", a massive\ncompanion of \"our brane\". Back from extra dimensions, massive bodies (stars or\ngalaxies) can also affect physical constants. They have large scalar charge\n$Q_d$ proportional to number of particles which produces a Coulomb-like scalar\nfield $\\phi=Q_d/r$. This leads to a variation of the fundamental constants\nproportional to the gravitational potential, e.g. $\\delta \\alpha/ \\alpha =\nk_\\alpha \\delta (GM/ r c^2)$. We compare different manifestations of this\neffect. The strongest limits $k_\\alpha +0.17 k_e= (-3.5\\pm 6) * 10^{-7}$ are\nobtained from the measurements of dependence of atomic frequencies on the\ndistance from Sun (the distance varies due to the ellipticity of the Earth's\norbit). \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/9904013", "contents": "Title: Sonoluminescence as a QED vacuum effect. I: The Physical Scenario Abstract: Several years ago Schwinger proposed a physical mechanism for\nsonoluminescence in terms of changes in the properties of the\nquantum-electrodynamic (QED) vacuum state. This mechanism is most often phrased\nin terms of changes in the Casimir Energy: changes in the distribution of\nzero-point energies and has recently been the subject of considerable\ncontroversy. The present paper further develops this quantum-vacuum approach to\nsonoluminescence: We calculate Bogolubov coefficients relating the QED vacuum\nstates in the presence of a homogeneous medium of changing dielectric constant.\nIn this way we derive an estimate for the spectrum, number of photons, and\ntotal energy emitted. We emphasize the importance of rapid spatio-temporal\nchanges in refractive indices, and the delicate sensitivity of the emitted\nradiation to the precise dependence of the refractive index as a function of\nwavenumber, pressure, temperature, and noble gas admixture. Although the\nphysics of the dynamical Casimir effect is a universal phenomenon of QED,\nspecific experimental features are encoded in the condensed matter physics\ncontrolling the details of the refractive index. This calculation places rather\ntight constraints on the possibility of using the dynamical Casimir effect as\nan explanation for sonoluminescence, and we are hopeful that this scenario will\nsoon be amenable to direct experimental probes. In a companion paper we discuss\nthe technical complications due to finite-size effects, but for reasons of\nclarity in this paper we confine attention to bulk effects. \n\n"}
