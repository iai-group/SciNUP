Particle\ninterferometry might then reveal non-standard decoherence effects, in addition\nto standard ones (due to, e.g., finite source size and detector resolution.) In\nthis work we discuss the phenomenology of such non-standard effects in the\npropagation of electron neutrinos in the Sun and in the long-baseline reactor\nexperiment KamLAND, which jointly provide us with the best available probes of\ndecoherence at neutrino energies E ~ few MeV. In the solar neutrino case, by\nmeans of a perturbative approach, decoherence is shown to modify the standard\n(adiabatic) propagation in matter through a calculable damping factor.

Measurements have\ncontinued with only a few brief interruptions since that time. We give here the\nexperimental improvements in SAGE since its last published data summary in Dec.\n2001. Assuming the solar neutrino production rate was constant during the\nperiod of data collection, combined analysis of 168 extractions through Dec.\n2007 gives a capture rate of solar neutrinos with energy more than 233 keV of\n65.4 (+3.1)(-3.0) (stat) (+2.6)(-2.8) (syst) SNU. The weighted average of the\nresults of all three Ga solar neutrino experiments, SAGE, Gallex, and GNO, is\nnow 66.1 +/- 3.1 SNU, where statistical and systematic uncertainties have been\ncombined in quadrature.

The ratio of\nobserved to calculated rates in this experiment, combined with the measured\nrates in the three prior 51Cr neutrino-source experiments with Ga, is 0.87 +/-\n0.05. A probable explanation for this low result is that the cross section for\nneutrino capture by the two lowest-lying excited states in 71Ge has been\noverestimated.

This effect may lead to important\nconsequences for the dynamics and the neutrino signal of the core-collapse\nsupernova. It is known that if neutrino is a Dirac fermion, then nu_L->nu_R\ntransition induced by the chirality flip leads to the emission of sterile\nright-handed neutrinos. The typical energies of these neutrinos are rather\nhigh, E ~ (100-200)MeV. Neutrino spin precession in the magnetic field either\ninside the collapsing star or in the interstellar space may lead to the\nbackward transition, nu_R->nu_L. Both possibilities are known to be\ninteresting. In the former case high-energy neutrinos can deliver additional\nenergy to the supernova envelope, which can help the supernova to explode. In\nthe latter case high-energy neutrinos may be detected simultaneously with the\n\"normal\" supernova neutrino signal, which would be a smoking gun for the Dirac\nneutrino magnetic moment.

The two-loop bubble diagram contains a linear infrared\ndivergence. Even if regulated with a non-zero photon mass M of order of the\nDebye mass, this infrared sensitivity implies that the two-loop self-energy\ncontributes terms to the fermion dispersion relation that are comparable to or\neven larger than the next-to-leading-order (NLO) contributions at one-loop.\nAdditional evidence for the necessity of a systematic restructuring of the loop\nexpansion comes from the explicit gauge parameter dependence of the fermion\ndamping rate at both one and two-loops. The leading terms in the high\ntemperature expansion of the two-loop self-energy for all topologies arise from\nan explicit hard-soft factorization pattern, in which one of the loop integrals\nis hard, nested inside a second loop integral which is soft.

The ability to trigger the\naforementioned identity hinges crucially on the particular Ansatz employed for\nthe three-gluon vertex entering into the Schwinger-Dyson equation governing the\ngluon propagator. The use of the appropriate three-gluon vertex brings about an\nadditional advantage: one obtains two separate (but coupled) integral\nequations, one for the effective charge and one for the gluon mass. This system\nof integral equations has a unique solution, which unambiguously determines\nthese two quantities.

In this scenario, the use of the Dirac equation\nis required for a satisfactory evolution of fermionic mass-eigenstates since in\nthe standard treatment of oscillations the mass-eigenstates are implicitly\nassumed to be scalars and, consequently, the spinorial form of neutrino wave\nfunctions is not included in the calculations. Within first quantized theories,\nbesides flavor oscillations, chiral oscillations automatically appear when we\nset the dynamic equations for a fermionic Dirac-type particle. The left-handed\nchiral nature of created and detected neutrinos can be implemented in the first\nquantized Dirac theory in presence of mixing; the probability loss due to the\nchanging of initially left-handed neutrinos to the undetected right-handed\nneutrinos can be obtained in analytic form. In the context of a causal\nrelativistic theory of a free particle, one of the two effects should be\npresent in flavor oscillations: (a) rapid oscillations or (b) initial flavor\nviolation. Concerning second quantized approaches, a simple second quantized\ntreatment exhibits a tiny but inevitable initial flavor violation without the\npossibility of rapid oscillations. Such effect is a consequence of an\nintrinsically indefinite but approximately well defined neutrino flavor.

A canonical K\\\"{a}hler potential with\n\\textit{minimal coupling} to gravity can resolve the tachyonic instability but\nruns into the $\\eta$-problem. We suggest a model which is free of the\n$\\eta$-problem due to an additional coupling in the K\\\"{a}hler potential which\nis allowed by the Standard Model gauge group. This induces directions in the\npotential which we call K-flat.

The new development is that we consider two components to the\nmass density: one arising from mass in collapsed haloes, and the second from a\nsmooth component of uncollapsed mass. Assuming that the nonlinear clustering of\ndark matter haloes can be understood, then from conservation arguments one can\nprecisely calculate the clustering properties of the smooth component and its\ncross-correlation with haloes. We then explore how the three main ingredients\nof the halo calculations, the mass function, bias and density profiles are\naffected by WDM. We show that, relative to CDM: the mass function is suppressed\nby ~50%, for masses ~100 times the free-streaming mass-scale; the bias of low\nmass haloes can be boosted by up to 20%; core densities of haloes can be\nsuppressed. We also examine the impact of relic thermal velocities on the\ndensity profiles, and find that these effects are constrained to scales r<1\nkpc/h, and hence of little importance for dark matter tests, owing to\nuncertainties in the baryonic physics. We use our modified halo model to\ncalculate the non-linear matter power spectrum, and find significant\nsmall-scale power in the model. However, relative to the CDM case, the power is\nsuppressed.

In the absence of\nneutrinos, the anisotropic stress vanishes and the Volterra equations reduce to\na single integral equation. We solve numerically this equation both for DM\nfermions decoupling at equilibrium and DM sterile neutrinos decoupling out of\nequilibrium.

At fixed\na, the density contrast grows with k for k < k_c while it decreases for k >\nk_c, (k_c ~ 1.6/Mpc). The density contrast depends on k and a mainly through\nthe product k a exhibiting a self-similar behavior. Our numerical density\ncontrast for small k gently approaches our analytic solution for k = 0. For\nfixed k < 1/(60 kpc), the density contrast generically grows with a while for k\n> 1/(60 kpc) it exhibits oscillations since the RD era which become stronger as\nk grows. We compute the transfer function of the density contrast for thermal\nfermions and for sterile neutrinos in: a) the Dodelson-Widrow (DW) model and b)\nin a model with sterile neutrinos produced by a scalar particle decay. The\ntransfer function grows with k for small k and then decreases after reaching a\nmaximum at k = k_c reflecting the time evolution of the density contrast.

Thus, if one wishes to entertain the possibility of Lorentz symmetry\nbreaking within the context of the class of local physical theories, then it\nseems likely that one will have to abandon (or at the very least grossly\nmodify) the relativity principle. Working within the framework of local\nphysics, we reassess the notion of spacetime transformations between inertial\nframes in the absence of the relativity principle, arguing that significant and\nnontrivial physics can still be extracted as long as the transformations are at\nleast linear. An interesting technical aspect of the analysis is that the\ntransformations now form a groupoid/pseudo-group --- it is this technical point\nthat permits one to evade the von Ignatowsky argument. Even in the absence of a\nrelativity principle we can nevertheless deduce clear and compelling rules for\nthe transformation of space and time, rules for the composition of\n3-velocities, and rules for the transformation of energy and momentum. As part\nof the analysis we identify two particularly elegant and physically compelling\nmodels implementing \"minimalist\" violations of Lorentz invariance --- in the\nfirst of these minimalist models all Lorentz violations are confined to\ncarefully delineated particle physics sub-sectors, while the second minimalist\nLorentz-violating model depends on one free function of absolute velocity, but\notherwise preserves as much as possible of standard Lorentz invariant physics. \n\n"}

Gravitino mediation\narises from minimally uplifting SUSY anti-de Sitter (AdS) space to Minkowski\nspace, generating soft masses proportional to the gravitino mass. Kahler\nmediation arises when visible sector fields have linear couplings to SUSY\nbreaking in the Kahler potential, generating soft masses proportional to beta\nfunction coefficients. In the literature, these two phenomena are lumped\ntogether under the name \"anomaly mediation\", but here we demonstrate that they\ncan be physically disentangled by measuring associated couplings to the\ngoldstino. In particular, we use the example of gaugino soft masses to show\nthat gravitino mediation generates soft masses without corresponding goldstino\ncouplings. This result naively violates the goldstino equivalence theorem but\nis in fact necessary for supercurrent conservation in AdS space.

Constrained by the\nobservation of the rotational stars moving in circular orbits with nearly\nconstant tangential speed in a spiral galaxy, the background of the phantom\nfield which is spatially inhomogeneous has an exponential potential. To avoid\nthe well-known quantum instability of the vacuum at high frequencies, the\nphantom field defined in an effective theory is valid only at low energies.\nUnder this assumption, we further investigate the following properties. The\nabsorption cross section of the low-energy $S$-wave excitations of the phantom\nfield into the central black hole is shown to be the horizontal area of the\ncentral black hole. Because the infalling phantom particles have a total\nnegative energy, the accretion of the phantom energy is related to the decrease\nof the black hole mass which is estimated to be much less than a solar mass in\nthe lifetime of the Universe. Using a simple model with the cold dark matter\nvery weakly coupled to the \"{\\it low-frequency}\" phantom particles which are\ngenerated from the background, we show that these two densities can be\nquasi-stable in the galaxy. \n\n"}

It is demonstrated that quantization in terms of neutral\nparticles and antiparticles is possible in terms of the states with\nwell-defined spin polarization. Such states are localizable and can form wave\npackets in a given asymptotic region. In this case, the problem can be\ntechnically reduced to the problem of charged-particle creation by an electric\nstep. In particular, the relation to the Schwinger method of an effective\naction is established. As an example, we calculate neutral fermion creation\nfrom the vacuum by a linearly growing magnetic field. We show that the total\nnumber and the vacuum-to-vacuum transition probability of created pairs depend\nonly on the gradient of the magnetic field, but not on its strength, and this\nfact does not depend on the spacetime dimension.

In this article, we review how one can\nprobe general relativity and various alternative theories of gravity by using\nelectromagnetic waves from a black hole with an accretion disk, and\ngravitational waves from black hole binaries. We first review model-independent\nways of testing gravity with electromagnetic/gravitational waves from a black\nhole system.

This allows an exploration of\ninflationary physics in a controlled regime away from the usual 4D lamp-post.\nThe inclusion of modulus stabilization is important as experience with string\nmodels teaches that this is usually what makes models fail: stabilization\nenergies dominate the shallow potentials required by slow roll and open up\ndirections to evolve that are steeper than those of the putative inflationary\ndirection.

{"id": "1609.06598", "contents": "Title: Initial conditions for the Galileon dark energy Abstract: Galileon models are among the most appealing candidates for Dark Energy. The\nreason is twofold: classically, they provide a tracking solution leading to an\nalmost DeSitter space starting from very generic initial conditions in the deep\nradiation era. The second reason is the standard lore that Galileons are\nquantum mechanically stable. The latter property is certainly true in flat\nspace-time, thanks to the non-renormalization theorems of galilean coupling\nconstants. However, in a cosmological background, we show that quantum effects\nmight dominate the classical trajectory. Assuming the radiation era to last at\nleast up to the electroweak phase transition, the trajectory with initial\nconditions sitting on the tracker is ruled out. On the other hand, it is always\npossible to find a sub-space of initial conditions such that the dark energy\nsolution approaches stably the tracker at late times. Fixing the value of\ninitial conditions that best fit current data, and assuming that the galileon\neffective theory is valid up to the beginning of the radiation epoch, we found\nthat the reheating temperature of the universe cannot be larger than $10^8 \\\n{\\rm GeV}$.

We present a formulation of the evolution equation that governs this\ncascade, the Banfi-Marchesini-Smye equation, from both an effective field\ntheory point of view and a direct diagrammatic argument. The equation uses\nexact momentum conservation, and is applicable to both scattering with initial\nand final state hard partons. The direct diagrammatic formulation is organized\nby constructing a generating functional. This functional is also automatically\nrealized with soft wilson lines and collinear field operators coupled to\nexternal currents. The two approaches are directly connected by reverse\nengineering the Lehman-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction procedure to insert states\nwithin the soft and collinear matrix elements.

The effects due to Pauli-Blocking and density, spin, and\nisospin correlations in the medium significantly reduce the neutrino cross\nsections. Due to the lack of experimental information at high density, these\ncorrelations are necessarily model dependent. For example, spin correlations in\nnonrelativistic models are found to lead to larger suppressions of neutrino\ncross sections compared to those of relativistic models. This is due to the\ntendency of the nonrelativistic models to develop spin instabilities.\nNotwithstanding the above caveats, and the differences between nonrelativistic\nand relativistic approaches such as the spin- and isospin-dependent\ninteractions and the nucleon effective masses, suppressions of order 2--3,\nrelative to the case in which correlations are ignored, are obtained.

In particular, we demonstrate that such strings will generically\nbecome superconducting at moderately low temperatures, thus enhancing their\nstability. We then present a new class of defects - drum vortons - which arise\nwhen a small symmetry breaking term is added to the potential. We display these\npoints within the context of the O(4) sigma model, relevant for hadrodynamics\nbelow the QCD scale. This model admits `embedded defects' (topological defect\nconfigurations of a simpler - in this case O(2) symmetric - model obtained by\nimposing an embedding constraint) that are unstable in the full model at zero\ntemperature, but that can be stabilised (by electromagnetic coupling to\nphotons) in a thermal gas at moderately high termperatures. It is shown here\nthat below the embedded defect stabilisation threshold, there will still be\nstabilized cosmic string defects. However, they will not be of the symmetric\nembedded vortex type, but of an `asymmetric' vortex type, and are automatically\nsuperconducting. In the presence of weak symmetry breaking terms, such as arise\nnaturally when using the O(4) model for hadrodynamics, the strings become the\nboundary of a new kind of cosmic sigma membrane, with tension given by the pion\nmass. The string current would then make it possible for a loop to attain a\n(classically) stable equilibrium state that differs from an ``ordinary'' vorton\nstate by the presence of a sigma membrane stretched across it in a drum like\nconfiguration. Such defects will however be entirely destabilised if the\nsymmetry breaking is too strong, as is found to be the case -- due to the\nrather large value of the pion mass -- in the hadronic application of the O(4)\nsigma model. \n\n"}

Both effects occur only if flat directions are\nsufficiently long-lived. The computation of their perturbative decay rate, and\na simple estimate of their nonperturbative decay have led to the conclusion\nthat this is indeed the case. In contrast, we show that flat directions can\ndecay quickly through nonperturbative channels in realistic models. The mass\nmatrix for MSSM excitations around flat directions has nondiagonal entries,\nwhich vary with the phase of the (complex) flat directions. The quasi-periodic\nmotion of the flat directions results in a strong parametric resonance, leading\nto the rapid depletion of the flat direction within its first few rotations.\nThis may preclude any significant role for the flat directions in reheating the\nUniverse after inflation in models in which the inflaton decays perturbatively. \n\n"}

In multi-field models\nwith strong preheating (q \\gg 1), metric perturbations are driven nonlinear,\nwith the strongest amplification typically on super-Hubble scales (k \\to 0).\nThis amplification is causal, being due to the super- Hubble coherence of the\ninflaton condensate, and is accompanied by resonant growth of entropy\nperturbations. The amplification invalidates the use of the linearized Einstein\nfield equations, irrespective of the amount of fine-tuning of the initial\nconditions. This has serious implications at all scales - from the large-angle\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies to primordial black holes.

It is shown that in\nthe general case a presence of bosons (e.g. gluons) in an initial state\nincreases the creation rate of the same kind of bosons. We discuss the question\n(and its relation to the initial stage of quark-gluon plasma formation) whether\na thermal form of one-particle distribution can appear even if the final state\nof the complete system is not a thermal equilibrium. In this respect, we\ndiscuss some cases when a pair creation by an electric-like field can mimic a\none-particle thermal distribution. We apply our technics to some QFT problems\nin slowly varying electric-like backgrounds: electric, SU(3) chromoelectric,\nand metric. In particular, we study the time and temperature behavior of mean\nnumbers of created particles provided switching on and off effects of the\nexternal field are negligible. It is shown that at high temperatures and in\nslowly varying electric fields the rate of particle creation is essentially\ntime-dependent. \n\n"}
