This larger capacitance is known to result\nfrom the Coulomb correlations between individual electrons within the low\ndensity 2DEG, which lead to a negative thermodynamic density of states\n(negative compressibility). Experiments on such systems generally operate in\nthe regime where the average spacing between electrons $n^{-1/2}$ in the 2DEG\nis smaller than $d$, and these experiments observe $C > C_g$ by only a few\npercent.

It was further claimed that at large enough SOC, the stronger the\nSOC, the weaker the Uc because in general the effective SOC is enhanced with\nincreasing electron-electron interaction strength. Contrary to this\nexpectation, we find that, in orthorhombic perovskite oxides (Pbnm), the\nstronger the SOC, the bigger the Uc.

We consider two alternative\ndefinitions of localized states in the lowest Landau level (LLL) on a torus.\nOne is the projection of the coordinate delta function onto the LLL. Another\ndefinition, proposed by Haldane & Rezayi, is to consider the set of functions\nwhich have all their zeros at a single point. Since all LLL wave functions on a\ntorus, are uniquely defined by the position of their zeros, this defines a set\nof functions that are expected to be localized around the point maximally far\naway from the zeros.\n  These two families of localized states have many properties in common with\nthe coherent states on the plane and on the sphere, e.g. a simple resolution of\nunity and a simple self-reproducing kernel.

In this\npaper, we demonstrate that a chiral free-fermion theory can live on an\nultra-local spacetime lattice if we allow the Lagrangian to be non-hermitian.\nRather than a violation of unitarity, the non-hermitian structure of our\nLagrangian arises because time is discrete, and we show that our model is obeys\nan elementary unitarity condition: namely, that the norm of the two-point\nfunctions conserves probability. Beyond unitarity, our model displays several\nsurprising properties: it is formulated directly in Minkowskian time; it has\nexactly Lorentz invariant dynamics for all frequencies and momenta (in the\nlarge volume limit); and it is free from all gauge anomalies, despite the\nprediction from field theory that it should suffer one. We show that our model\nis a discrete time description of a single chiral edge mode of several recently\nproposed $2+1$d Floquet models. That the chiral edge can be treated without the\nrest of the $2+1$d system, even when coupled to a gauge field, implies that the\nFloquet models are radically different from Integer Quantum Hall models, which\nalso support chiral edge modes. Furthermore, the Floquet results imply that our\nmodel can be physically realized, which presents an opportunity for gauge\ntheories to be simulated in a condensed matter or cold atom context. Our\nresults present a solution to the `Chiral-fermion problem:' a chiral field\ntheory can indeed be defined on an ultra-local spacetime lattice, and we\naddress how our model avoids several no-go arguments. \n\n"}

{"id": "1807.10633", "contents": "Title: Faster and lower scaling orbital-space Variational Monte Carlo Abstract: In this work, we introduce three algorithmic improvements to reduce the cost\nand improve the scaling of orbital space variational Monte Carlo (VMC). First,\nwe show that by appropriately screening the one- and two-electron integrals of\nthe Hamiltonian one can improve the efficiency of the algorithm by several\norders of magnitude. This improved efficiency comes with the added benefit that\nthe resulting algorithm scales as the second power of the system size $O(N^2)$,\ndown from the fourth power $O(N^4)$. Using numerical results, we demonstrate\nthat the practical scaling obtained is in fact $O(N^{1.5})$ for a chain of\nHydrogen atoms, and $O(N^{1.2})$ for the Hubbard model. Second, we introduce\nthe use of the rejection-free continuous time Monte Carlo (CTMC) to sample the\ndeterminants. CTMC is usually prohibitively expensive because of the need to\ncalculate a large number of intermediates. Here, we take advantage of the fact\nthat these intermediates are already calculated during the evaluation of the\nlocal energy and consequently, just by storing them one can use the CTCM\nalgorithm with virtually no overhead. Third, we show that by using the adaptive\nstochastic gradient descent algorithm called AMSGrad one can optimize the\nwavefunction energies robustly and efficiently. The combination of these three\nimprovements allows us to calculate the ground state energy of a chain of 160\nhydrogen atoms using a wavefunction containing $\\sim 2\\times 10^5$ variational\nparameters with an accuracy of 1 $mE_h$/particle at a cost of just 25 CPU\nhours, which when split over 2 nodes of 24 processors each amounts to only\nabout half hour of wall time. This low cost coupled with embarrassing\nparallelizability of the VMC algorithm and great freedom in the forms of usable\nwavefunctions, represents a highly effective method for calculating the\nelectronic structure of model and \\emph{ab initio} systems. \n\n"}

Using determinantal quantum\nMonte Carlo, we study the 2D Hubbard model for two different band structures: a\nregular nearest-neighbor tight-binding model, and a partially flat band\nstructure containing a non-dispersing region, with identical total\nnon-interacting bandwidth $W$. For both repulsive and attractive weak\ninteractions ($|U| \\ll W$), correlated phenomena are significantly stronger in\nthe partially flat model. In the repulsive case, even with $U$ an order of\nmagnitude smaller than $W$, we find the presence of a Mott insulating state\nnear half-filling of the flat region in momentum space. In the attractive case,\nwhere generically the ground state is superconducting, the partially flat model\nexhibits significantly enhanced superconducting transition temperatures.

In order to drive the system through the phase\nborder P_0(T_0), the sample was maintained at fixed temperature T and pressure\nP, whereas the critical pressure P_0 was tuned by applying the magnetic field\nB. In this approach, the magnetic field was used (i) for tuning (P-P_0), and\n(ii) for identifying the phase composition (due to qualitatively different\nmagnetoresistance behavior in different phases). Experimentally, we measured\nR(B) and its temperature dependence R(B,T) in the pressure range (0 - 1)GPa.\nOur studies focus on the features of the magnetoresistance at the phase\ntransition between the PM and AF phases, in the close vicinity to the\nsuperconducting transition at T~1K.

The most important example is the transition of the S = 1/2 square\nlattice antiferromagnet between the Neel state (which breaks spin rotation\ninvariance) and the paramagnetic valence bond solid (which preserves spin\nrotation invariance but breaks lattice symmetries). We show that these two\nstates are separated by a second order quantum phase transition. The critical\ntheory is not expressed in terms of the order parameters characterizing either\nstate (as would be the case in Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory) but involves\nfractionalized degrees of freedom and an emergent, topological, global\nconservation law. A closely related theory describes the superfluid-insulator\ntransition of bosons at half-filling on a square lattice, in which the\ninsulator has a bond density wave order. Similar considerations are shown to\napply to transitions of antiferromagnets between the valence bond solid and the\nZ_2 spin liquid: the critical theory has deconfined excitations interacting\nwith an emergent U(1) gauge force.

It was previously reported that in the undoped\nCa$_2$Y$_2$Cu$_5$O$_{10}$ there is an anomalous broadening of spin-wave\nexcitations along the chain, which is caused mainly by the antiferromagnetic\ninterchain interactions [Matsuda $et$ $al.$, Phys.
