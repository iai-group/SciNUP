Recently, atom-exchange reactions were observed in a\ntrapped ultracold gas of KRb molecules.

Abstract: Various fundamental phenomena of strongly-correlated quantum systems such as\nhigh-$T_c$ superconductivity, the fractional quantum-Hall effect, and quark\nconfinement are still awaiting a universally accepted explanation. The main\nobstacle is the computational complexity of solving even the most simplified\ntheoretical models that are designed to capture the relevant quantum\ncorrelations of the many-body system of interest. In his seminal 1982 paper\n[Int. J. Theor. Phys. 21, 467], Richard Feynman suggested that such models\nmight be solved by \"simulation\" with a new type of computer whose constituent\nparts are effectively governed by a desired quantum many-body dynamics.\nMeasurements on this engineered machine, now known as a \"quantum simulator,\"\nwould reveal some unknown or difficult to compute properties of a model of\ninterest. We argue that a useful quantum simulator must satisfy four\nconditions: relevance, controllability, reliability, and efficiency. We review\nthe current state of the art of digital and analog quantum simulators. Whereas\nso far the majority of the focus, both theoretically and experimentally, has\nbeen on controllability of relevant models, we emphasize here the need for a\ncareful analysis of reliability and efficiency in the presence of\nimperfections. We discuss how disorder and noise can impact these conditions,\nand illustrate our concerns with novel numerical simulations of a paradigmatic\nexample: a disordered quantum spin chain governed by the Ising model in a\ntransverse magnetic field. We find that disorder can decrease the reliability\nof an analog quantum simulator of this model, although large errors in local\nobservables are introduced only for strong levels of disorder. We conclude that\nthe answer to the question \"Can we trust quantum simulators?\" is... to some\nextent. \n\n"}

A plethora of interesting lattice gauge theories\nsuggests itself for quantum simulation, which should allow us to address very\nchallenging problems, ranging from confinement and deconfinement, or chiral\nsymmetry breaking and its restoration at finite baryon density, to color\nsuperconductivity and the real-time evolution of heavy-ion collisions, first in\nsimpler model gauge theories and ultimately in QCD. \n\n"}

{"id": "1311.7300", "contents": "Title: Extended Parrondo's Game and Brownian Ratchets: Strong and Weak Parrondo\n  Effect Abstract: Inspired by the flashing ratchet, Parrondo's game presents an apparently\nparadoxical situation. Parrondo's game consists of two individual games, game A\nand game B. Game A is a slightly losing coin-tossing game. Game B has two\ncoins, with an integer parameter $M$. If the current cumulative capital (in\ndiscrete unit) is a multiple of $M$, an unfavorable coin $p_b$ is used,\notherwise a favorable $p_g$ coin is used. Paradoxically, combination of game A\nand game B could lead to a winning game, which is the Parrondo effect. We\nextend the original Parrondo's game to include the possibility of $M$ being\neither $M_1$ or $M_2$. Also, we distinguish between strong Parrondo effect,\ni.e. two losing games combine to form a winning game, and weak Parrondo effect,\ni.e. two games combine to form a better-performing game. We find that when\n$M_2$ is not a multiple of $M_1$, the combination of $B(M_1)$ and $B(M_2)$ has\nstrong and weak Parrondo effect for some subsets in the parameter space\n$(p_b,p_g)$, while there is neither strong nor weak effect when $M_2$ is a\nmultiple of $M_1$. Furthermore, when $M_2$ is not a multiple of $M_1$,\nstochastic mixture of game A may cancel the strong and weak Parrondo effect.\nFollowing a discretization scheme in the literature of Parrondo's game, we\nestablish a link between our extended Parrondo's game with the analysis of\ndiscrete Brownian ratchet. We find a relation between the Parrondo effect of\nour extended model to the macroscopic bias in a discrete ratchet. The slope of\na ratchet potential can be mapped to the fair game condition in the extended\nmodel, so that under some conditions, the macroscopic bias in a discrete\nratchet can provide a good predictor for the game performance of the extended\nmodel. On the other hand, our extended model suggests a design of a ratchet in\nwhich the potential is a mixture of two periodic potentials. \n\n"}

Current\nschemes, however, require prohibitively high laser power ($\\sim10$ W), and the\n$Q_m$ enhancement is ultimately limited to a factor of $\\sim$ 50 by\nhybridization between the trapped mode and the dissipative modes of the\nsupporting structure. Here we propose a levitation scheme taking full advantage\nof an optical resonator to reduce the circulating power requirements by many\norders of magnitude. Applying this scheme to the case of a dielectric disk in a\nFabry-Perot cavity, we find a tilt-based tuning mechanism for optimizing both\ncenter-of-mass and torsional mode traps. Notably, the two modes are trapped\nwith comparable efficiency, and we estimate that a 10-micron-diameter,\n100-nm-thick Si disc could be trapped to a frequency of $\\sim$ 10 MHz with only\n$30$ mW circulating in a cavity of (modest) finesse 1500. Finally, we simulate\nthe effect such a strong trap would have on a realistic doubly-tethered disc.\nOf central importance, we find torsional motion is comparatively immune to\n$Q_m$-limiting hybridization, allowing a $Q_m$ enhancement factor of $\\sim$\n1500.

We perform a\nsystematic, in-depth analysis of the relation between the macroscopic,\nphenomenological parameters of Luttinger liquid effective field theory, and the\nmicroscopic interactions of the Fermi gas. In particular, we begin by\nexplaining how to model effective interactions in one dimension, which we then\napply to the main forward scattering channel -- the interbranch collisions --\ncommon to these systems. We renormalise the corresponding interbranch\nphenomenological constants in favour of scattering phase shifts. Interestingly,\nour renormalisation procedure shows (i) how Luttinger's model arises in a\ncompletely natural way -- and not as a convenient approximation -- from\nTomonaga's model, and (ii) the reasons behind the interbranch coupling constant\nremaining unrenormalised in Luttinger's model.

We show that, contrary to general belief and common sense, the\nintrabranch interactions appearing in Luttinger liquid theory do not correspond\nto an intrabranch scattering channel, nor an energy shift due to intrabranch\ninteractions, in the microscopic theory.

Both\nzero-vorticity (fundamental) solitons and ones carrying vorticity S = 1 are\nconsidered. Physical realizations of multidimensional solitons in atomic\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and nonlinear optics are briefly discussed\ntoo. Unlike 1D solitons, which are typically stable, 2D and 3D ones are\nvulnerable to instabilities induced by the occurrence of the critical and\nsupercritical collapse, respectively, in the same 2D and 3D models that give\nrise to the solitons. Vortex solitons are subject to a still stronger splitting\ninstability. For this reason, a central problem is search for physical settings\nin which 2D and 3D solitons may be stabilized. The brief review addresses one\nwell-established topic, viz., the stabilization of the 3D and 2D states, with S\n= 0 and 1, trapped in harmonic-oscillator (HO) potentials, and another topic\nwhich was developed very recently: the stabilization of 2D and 3D free-space\nsolitons, which juxtapose components with S = 0 and (+/-)1 (semi-vortices and\nmixed modes), in a binary system with the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) between its\ncomponents.

In this\npaper, we investigate theoretically the Landau effective interaction between\nquasiparticles, so-called Bose polarons, formed by impurity particles immersed\nin a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). In the limit of weak interactions between\nthe impurities and the BEC, we derive rigorous results for the effective\ninteraction. They show that it can be strong even for weak impurity-boson\ninteraction, if the transferred momentum/energy between the quasiparticles is\nresonant with a sound mode in the BEC. We then develop a diagrammatic scheme to\ncalculate the effective interaction for arbitrary coupling strengths, which\nrecovers the correct weak coupling results. Using this, we show that the Landau\neffective interaction in general is significantly stronger than that between\nquasiparticles in a Fermi gas, mainly because a BEC is more compressible than a\nFermi gas.

The observed BEC depletion rates\nare much higher when shaking both along x and y directions, as opposed to only\nx or only y. This is understood as originating from the interaction-induced\nnon-separability along the two lattice directions. We also report an explosion\nof the heating rates at large drive amplitudes, and suggest a phenomenological\ndescription beyond Bogoliubov theory. In this strongly-coupled regime, circular\ndrives heat faster than diagonal drives, which illustrates the non-trivial\ndependence of the heating on the choice of drive. \n\n"}

By using this second quantized formulation,\nwhich does not assume adiabatic approximation, a convenient exact formula for\nthe geometric terms including off-diagonal geometric terms is derived. The\nanalysis of geometric phases is then reduced to a simple diagonalization of the\nHamiltonian, and it is analyzed both in the operator and path integral\nformulations.

Pairs of\ndegenerate photons at telecom wavelength are created by parametric down\nconversion in a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide. The photon pairs\nare separated in a beam-splitter and transmitted via two fibers of 25km. The\nwave-packets are relatively delayed and recombined on a second beam-splitter,\nforming a large Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Coincidence counts between the\nphotons at the two output modes are registered. The main challenge consists in\nthe trade-off between low count rates due to narrow filtering and length\nfluctuations of the 25km long arms during the measurement. For balanced paths a\nHong-Ou-Mandel dip with a visibility of 47.3% is observed, which is close to\nthe maximal theoretical value of 50% developed here. This proves the\npracticability of a long distance Bell state measurement with two independent\nsources, as e.g. required in an entanglement swapping configuration in the\nscale of tens of km. \n\n"}
