It takes into\naccount both galaxy evolution and the perturbing effects of large scale\nstructure. The key to the algorithm is a maximum likelihood (ML) method for\njointly estimating both the luminosity function (LF) and the overdensity as a\nfunction of redshift. The random catalogue algorithm then works by cloning each\ngalaxy in the original catalogue, with the number of clones determined by the\nML solution. Each of these cloned galaxies is then assigned a random redshift\nuniformly distributed over the accessible survey volume, taking account of the\nsurvey magnitude limit(s) and, optionally, both luminosity and number density\nevolution. The resulting random catalogues, which can be employed in\ntraditional estimates of galaxy clustering, make fuller use of the information\navailable in the original catalogue and hence are superior to simply fitting a\nfunctional form to the observed redshift distribution. They are particularly\nwell suited to studies of the dependence of galaxy clustering on galaxy\nproperties as each galaxy in the random catalogue has the same list of\nattributes as measured for the galaxies in the genuine catalogue. The\nderivation of the joint overdensity and LF estimator reveals the limit in which\nthe ML estimate reduces to the standard 1/Vmax LF estimate, namely when one\nmakes the prior assumption that the are no fluctuations in the radial\noverdensity.

The confidence\ninterval is determined from the current intrinsic scatter in the relation,\nwhich includes effects from X-ray variability and accretion modes.

Given that rotating superfluids between two\nconcentric spheres have been verified to be dynamically unstable to non\naxi-symmetric perturbations, we conclude that the remnant energy stored in the\ncore would be sufficiently large to turn the flow turbulent and dissipative and\nsubsequently lead to core collapse bosonova.\n  The feasibility of a conversion mechanism of normal matter into bosonic\ncondensates under normal astrophysical conditions is discussed as well.\n  We finally conclude that in lack of a profound theory for quantum gravity,\nBHs should continue to be the favorite proposal for BH candidates. \n\n"}

For axion masses above about 10^-4 eV, resonant mode conversion at a\nlayer where the axion mass matches the local electron plasma frequency is\nnecessary. For axion masses above about 10^-2 eV, this mode conversion occurs\ntoo deep in the solar atmosphere for the resulting photon to escape the solar\nsurface and be detected before Compton scattering obscures the line. At the\n(detectable) axion masses below this, the flux of mode converted photons\npredicted by axion models appears to be too low for detection to be feasible\nwith current instrumentation.

We show that above a critical particle number in the\nbright component, a symmetry breaking bifurcation of the pitchfork type occurs\nthat leads to a new asymmetric solution whereas the parental branch, i.e., the\nout-of-phase state becomes unstable. These three different states support\ndifferent small amplitude oscillations, characterized by an almost stationary\ndensity of the dark component and a tunneling of the bright component between\nthe two dark solitons. Within a suitable effective double-well picture, these\ncan be understood as the characteristic features of a Bosonic Josephson\nJunction (BJJ), and we show within a two-mode approach that all characteristic\nfeatures of the BJJ phase space are recovered. For larger deviations from the\nstationary states, the simplifying double-well description breaks down due to\nthe feedback of the bright component onto the dark one, causing the solitons to\nmove.

We\nemploy radiative hydrodynamic simulations to parameterize the ionisation rate\nRion and recombination rate Rrec as functions of halo mass, overdensity and\nredshift.

We require an average photon escape\nfraction fesc=0.04 within ~ 0.5 cMpc cells, independent of halo mass or\nredshift, to simultaneously match these data.

Both\nzero-vorticity (fundamental) solitons and ones carrying vorticity S = 1 are\nconsidered. Physical realizations of multidimensional solitons in atomic\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and nonlinear optics are briefly discussed\ntoo. Unlike 1D solitons, which are typically stable, 2D and 3D ones are\nvulnerable to instabilities induced by the occurrence of the critical and\nsupercritical collapse, respectively, in the same 2D and 3D models that give\nrise to the solitons. Vortex solitons are subject to a still stronger splitting\ninstability. For this reason, a central problem is search for physical settings\nin which 2D and 3D solitons may be stabilized. The brief review addresses one\nwell-established topic, viz., the stabilization of the 3D and 2D states, with S\n= 0 and 1, trapped in harmonic-oscillator (HO) potentials, and another topic\nwhich was developed very recently: the stabilization of 2D and 3D free-space\nsolitons, which juxtapose components with S = 0 and (+/-)1 (semi-vortices and\nmixed modes), in a binary system with the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) between its\ncomponents. The former model is based on the single cubic nonlinear\nSchroedinger/Gross-Pitaevskii equation (NLSE/GPE), while the latter one is\nrepresented by a system of two coupled GPEs. In both cases, generic situations\nare drastically different in the 2D and 3D geometries. In the 2D settings, the\nstabilization mechanism creates a stable ground state (GS, which was absent\nwithout the stabilization), whose norm falls below the threshold value at which\nthe critical collapse sets in. In the 3D geometry, the supercritical collapse\ndoes not allow to create a GS, but metastable solitons can be constructed. \n\n"}

The barrier's\nstrength, epsilon, is the single free parameter of the scaled form of the\nmodel. It may be implemented in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and nonlinear\noptics. The SSB bifurcation of the symmetric ground state (GS) is predicted\nanalytically in two limit cases, viz., for deep or weak splitting of the\npotential box by the barrier. For the generic case, a variational approximation\n(VA) is elaborated. The analytical findings are presented along with systematic\nnumerical results. Stability of stationary states is studied through the\ncalculation of eigenvalues for small perturbations, and by means of direct\nsimulations. The GS always undergoes the SSB bifurcation of the supercritical\ntype, as predicted by the VA at moderate values of epsilon, although the VA\nfails at small epsilon, due to inapplicability of the underlying ansatz in that\ncase. However, the latter case is correctly treated by the approximation based\non a soliton ansatz. On top of the GS, the first and second excited states are\nstudied too.

Over the last decade, optical frequency combs were shown to offer\nunique advantages in optical ranging, in particular when it comes to fast\ndistance acquisition with high accuracy. However, current comb-based concepts\nare not suited for emerging high-volume applications such as drone navigation\nor autonomous driving. These applications critically rely on LIDAR systems that\nare not only accurate and fast, but also compact, robust, and amenable to\ncost-efficient mass-production. Here we show that integrated dissipative\nKerr-soliton (DKS) comb sources provide a route to chip-scale LIDAR systems\nthat combine sub-wavelength accuracy and unprecedented acquisition speed with\nthe opportunity to exploit advanced photonic integration concepts for\nwafer-scale mass production. In our experiments, we use a pair of free-running\nDKS combs, each providing more than 100 carriers for massively parallel\nsynthetic-wavelength interferometry.

In this paper, we show that a recently discovered\nduality relation for fermionic systems -- deriving from the fundamental\nfermion-parity superselection principle of quantum many-particle systems --\nprovides new insights into thermoelectric transport. Using a master equation,\nwe analyze the stationary charge and heat currents through a weakly coupled,\nbut strongly interacting single-level quantum dot subject to electrical and\nthermal bias. In linear transport, the fermion-parity duality shows that\nfeatures of thermoelectric response coefficients are actually dominated by the\naverage and fluctuations of the charge in a dual quantum dot system, governed\nby attractive instead of repulsive electron-electron interaction.

The presented logic uses fluxons, topological solitons in Long\nJosephson Junctions (LJJs), as inputs into and outputs from logic gates. An\nadvantage of using LJJs for connections is that they restrict scattering to 1D\npaths, in contrast to previous ballistic logic which is based on 2D scattering.\nFurthermore, we find through simulation that there is almost no energy loss in\nthe scattering of fluxons between LJJs of designed unpowered circuit gates. To\nswitch bit states, the fluxons are made to change polarity during operations --\nfluxons in an input LJJ freely propagate into the gate circuit, excite a\nnonlinear oscillatory interface mode, and quickly scatter deterministically to\nan output LJJ as a fluxon or antifluxon.

In this work, we unveil\nthe particularities of a vortex ice system by direct observation of the vortex\ndistribution in a kagome lattice of paired antidots using scanning Hall probe\nmicroscopy. The theoretically suggested vortex ice distribution, lacking long\nrange order, is observed at half matching field (H_{1}/2).

We show that, in spite of the fact that the physics\nunderlying the appearance of a chiral response is very different in all these\nmethods, the enantio-sensitive and dichroic observable in all cases has a\nunique form. It is a polar vector given by the product of (i) a molecular\npseudoscalar and (ii) a field pseudovector specified by the configuration of\nthe electric fields interacting with the isotropic ensemble of chiral\nmolecules. The molecular pseudoscalar is a rotationally invariant property,\nwhich is composed from different molecule-specific vectors and in the simplest\ncase is a triple product of such vectors. The key property that enables the\nchiral response is the non-coplanarity of the vectors forming such triple\nproduct.

This atypical\nconverging electron flow emerges by applying uniaxial tension out of the\ndevice's symmetry axes. A part of electron flow needs to be positively\nrefracted for focusing in an asymmetric spot, whose location is tunable with\nthe strain. In AVLs, Klein tunneling is angularly shifted regards to the normal\nincidence. This perfect transmission occurs at the straight line that connects\nthe point source and focus, which is unaffected by variation of the Fermi level\nand barrier's width. Moreover, the mirror symmetry breaking by the strain also\ncauses the asymmetry in Fabry-P\\'erot interference.

In the companion paper, we studied experimentally\nthe minimal realization of a CIM, i.e. two coupled parametric oscillators [L.\nBello, M. Calvanese Strinati, E. G. Dalla Torre, and A. Pe'er, Phys.

We found that the presence of an energy-conserving\ncoupling between the oscillators can dramatically change the dynamics, leading\nto everlasting beats, which transcend the Ising description.

A\ncrucial role is played by the fact that gap solitons may feature a negative\ndynamical mass, keeping their mobility in the OL. First, the respective system\nof coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs) is reduced to a system of\nequations for envelopes of the lattice wave functions. Two generic dynamical\nregimes are revealed by simulations of the reduced system, viz., shuttle\noscillations of pairs of solitons with positive and negative masses, and\nsplitting of the pair. The co-accelerating motion of the interacting solitons,\nwhich keeps constant separation between them, occurs at the boundary between\nthe shuttle motion and splitting. The position of the co-acceleration regime in\nthe system's parameter space can be adjusted with the help of an additional\ngravity potential, which induces its own acceleration, that may offset the\nrelative acceleration of the two solitons, while gravity masses of both\nsolitons remain positive.

We note that a\nspectrum which runs only over 1.5 decades of k space provides as good a fit to\nthe CMB data as one which runs at all k, that significant evidence for running\ncomes from multipoles l near 40, and that large running gives a better fit than\na flat spectrum primarily if the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is large, r ~ 0.5,\nand the field values are at the Planck scale.

The superfluid transition in aerogel at 33.4\nbars is field independent from 0 to 5 kG and shows no evidence of an\n$A_{1}-A_{2}$ splitting. The first-order transition between the A and B-phases\nis suppressed by a magnetic field, and exhibits strong supercooling at high\npressures. We show that the equilibrium phase in zero applied field is the\nB-phase with at most a region of A-phase {\\small $\\alt$} 20 $\\mu$K just below\nT${_c}$ at a pressure of 33.4 bars. This is in contrast to pure $^{3}$He which\nhas a large stable region of A-phase and a polycritical point. The quadratic\ncoefficient for magnetic field suppression of the AB-transition,\n$g_{a}(\\beta)$, was obtained. The pressure dependence of $g_{a}(\\beta)$ is\nmarkedly different from that for the pure superfluid, $g_{0}(\\beta)$, which\ndiverges at a polycritical pressure of 21 bars. We compare our results with\ncalculations from the homogeneous scattering model for $g_{a}(\\beta)$, defined\nin a Ginzburg-Landau theory in terms of strong-coupling parameters $\\beta$. We\nfind qualitatively good agreement with the experiment if the strong-coupling\ncorrections are rescaled from known values of the $\\beta$'s for pure $^{3}$He,\nreduced by the suppression of the superfluid transition temperature.
