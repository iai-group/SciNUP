Nevertheless, the efficiency most of them is still based on the\nfundamental physical phenomena, such as resonances. Thus, the understanding of\nthe resonance phenomena will be beneficial. One of the well-known examples is\nthe resonant enhancement of the transmission known as Breit-Wigner resonances,\nwhich can be described by a Lorentzian function. But, in many physical systems\nthe scattering of waves involves propagation along different paths, and, as a\nconsequence, results in interference phenomena, where constructive interference\ncorresponds to resonant enhancement and destructive interference to resonant\nsuppression of the transmission. Recently, a variety of experimental and\ntheoretical work has revealed such patterns in different branches of physics.\nThe purpose of this Review is to demonstrate that this kind of resonant\nscattering is related to the Fano resonances, known from atomic physics. One of\nthe main features of the Fano resonances is the asymmetric profile. The\nasymmetry comes from the close coexistence of resonant transmission and\nresonant reflection. Fano successfully explained such a phenomenon in his\nseminal paper in 1961 in terms of interaction of a discrete (localized) state\nwith a continuum of propagation modes. It allows to describe both resonant\nenhancement and resonant suppression in a unified manner.

The model consists\nof atoms with prescribed geometric arrangement of active orbitals, represented\nby arms of the length of half of the relevant bond lengths. The interactions\nhave a repulsive part between the atomic centers and an attraction between the\narm ends of different atoms. For each atom pair only the closest pair of arms\ninteracts attempting to form the bond. This is a picture of sigma bonds, the pi\nbonds are modeled by alignment of additional internal vectors which might\ncharacterize a given atom. Also these are primarily pair interactions. Thus\nthere are only pair interactions of several types present. The intrinsic\narrangement of the model elements, arms and internal vectors can be switched\ndepending on the environment. Thus the complexity of the many-body potentials\nis replaced by pair interactions between atoms with complex internal behaviour.\nThe proposed model thus allows formation of new geometries, establishing new\nand breaking existing bonds with the use of only pair interactions and\nenvironment scanning.

Abstract: We have recently applied the second law to an isolated system, consisting of\na system {\\Sigma} such as a glass surrounded by an extremely large medium\n{\\Sigma}, to show that the instantaneous temperature T(t), thermodynamic\nentropy S(T_0,t) and enthalpy H(T_0,t) of {\\Sigma} decrease in any isothermal\nrelaxation towards their respective equilibrium values under isobaric cooling.\nThe Gibbs statistical entropy also conforms to the above relaxation behavior in\na glass, which however is contrary to the conjecture by Gupta, Mauro and\ncoworkers that the glass transition and the structural relaxation are inverse\nprocesses. However, they do not establish that the entropy loss during the\nglass transition is accompanied by a concomitant entropy gain of the medium to\nmaintain the second law. They use a novel statistical formulation of entropy\nbased on several conjectures such as it being zero for a microstate, but do not\ncompare its behavior with the thermodynamic entropy. The formulation is\ndesigned to show the entropy loss. Its subsequent rise not only contradicts our\nresult but also implies that the glass during relaxation must have a negative\nabsolute temperature. To understand these puzzling results and the above\nconjecture, we have carried out a critical evaluation of their unconventional\napproach. We find that the inverse conjecture is neither supported by their\napproach nor by the second law. The zero-entropy microstate conjecture is only\nconsistent with S(T_0,t)\\equiv 0 at all temperatures, not just at absolute zero\nand is found to have no scientific merit. We show that the maximum entropy gain\nof the medium during the glass transition invalidates the entropy loss\nconjecture. After pointing out other misleading, confusing and highly\nexaggerated statements in their work, we finally conclude that their\nunconventional statistical approach and computational scheme are not\nappropriate for glasses. \n\n"}

Collective cavity\ncooling of molecules is a promising method that does not rely on molecular\nenergy level and thus can be applied to all molecules in principle. However,\nthe initial lack of cold molecules leads to the difficulty in its experimental\nimplementation. We show that efficient collective sympathetic cooling of\nmolecules to sub-mK temperatures using a large ensemble of atoms within a\ncavity is feasible. This approach is a new type of sympathetic cooling which\ndoes not rely on direct collisions between atoms and molecules, but utilizes\nthermalization via their mutual interaction with a cavity field. Two important\nmechanisms are identified. This include: (1) giant enhancement of cavity\noptical field from the efficient scattering of the pump light by the atoms; (2)\ncavity-mediated collective interaction between the atoms and the molecules. We\nshow an optimal cavity detuning for maximizing cooling, which is dependent on\nthe atom and molecule numbers. We determine a threshold for the molecular pump\nstrength and show that it is independent of molecule number when the number of\natoms is much greater than the molecules. This can be reduced by orders of\nmagnitude when compared to cavity cooling of single molecular species only.\nUsing this new sympathetic cavity cooling technique, cooling molecules to\nsub-mK within a high-Q cavity could be within reach of experimental\ndemonstration. \n\n"}

It\nhas been speculated that super rotors may exhibit a number of unique\nproperties. Theoretical studies showed that ultrafast molecular rotation may\nchange the character of molecular scattering from solid surfaces, alter\nmolecular trajectories in external fields, make super rotors stable against\ncollisions, and lead to the formation of gas vortices. New ways of molecular\ncooling and selective chemical bond breaking by ultrafast spinning have been\nsuggested. Bringing a large number of molecules to fast, directional and\nsynchronous rotation is rather challenging. An efficient method of accelerating\nmolecular rotation with an \"optical centrifuge\" has been proposed and\nsuccessfully implemented, yet only indirect evidence of super rotors has been\nreported to date. Here we demonstrate the first direct observation of molecular\nsuper rotors and study their spectroscopic, dynamical and magneto-optical\nproperties.

Ultracold quantum gases offer tremendous promise for this\napplication largely due to an unprecedented control over interactions.\nSpecifically, $a$, the two-body scattering length that characterizes the\ninteraction strength, can be tuned to any value. This offers prospects for\nexperimental access to regimes where the behavior is not well understood\nbecause interactions are strong, atom-atom correlations are important,\nmean-field theory is inadequate, and equilibrium may not be reached or perhaps\ndoes not even exist. Of particular interest is the unitary gas, where $a$ is\ninfinite, and where many aspects of the system are universal in that they\ndepend only on the particle density and quantum statistics.

Furthermore,\nhighly efficient single-photon sources and giant photon nonlinearities may be\nimplemented with immediate applications for photonic quantum-information\nprocessing. The review summarizes the general theoretical framework of photon\nemission including the role of dephasing processes, and applies it to photonic\nnanostructures of current interest, such as photonic-crystal cavities and\nwaveguides, dielectric nanowires, and plasmonic waveguides. The introduced\nconcepts are generally applicable in quantum nanophotonics and apply to a large\nextent also to other quantum emitters, such as molecules, nitrogen vacancy\nceters, or atoms. Finally, the progress and future prospects of applications in\nquantum-information processing are considered. \n\n"}

In the fields of condensed matter, nuclear structure and\nmolecular electronic structure, it has significantly extended the system sizes\nthat can be handled compared to full configuration interaction, without losing\nnumerical accuracy. For quantum chemistry (QC), the most efficient\nimplementations of DMRG require the incorporation of particle number, spin and\npoint group symmetries in the underlying matrix product state (MPS) ansatz, as\nwell as the use of so-called complementary operators. The symmetries introduce\na sparse block structure in the MPS ansatz and in the intermediary contracted\ntensors. If a symmetry is non-abelian, the Wigner-Eckart theorem allows to\nfactorize a tensor into a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient and a reduced tensor. In\naddition, the fermion signs have to be carefully tracked. Because of these\nchallenges, implementing DMRG efficiently for QC is not straightforward.\nEfficient and freely available implementations are therefore highly desired. In\nthis work we present CheMPS2, our free open-source spin-adapted implementation\nof DMRG for ab initio QC.

Abstract: There are three theoretical models which purport to relate\nexperimentally-measurable or fabrication-controllable device properties to the\nmemristor's operation: 1. Strukov et al's phenomenological model; 2. Georgiou\net al's Bernoulli rewrite of that phenomenological model; 3. Gale's\nmemory-conservation model. They differ in their prediction of the effect on\nmemristance of changing the electrode size and factors that affect the\nhysteresis. Using a batch of TiO$_2$ sol-gel memristors fabricated with\ndifferent top electrode widths we test and compare these three theories. It was\nfound that, contrary to model 2's prediction, the `dimensionless lumped\nparameter', $\\beta$, did not correlate to any measure of the hysteresis.\nContrary to model 1, memristance was found to be dependent on the three spatial\ndimensions of the TiO$_2$ layer, as was predicted by model 3. Model 3 was found\nto fit the change in resistance value with electrode size. Simulations using\nmodel 3 and experimentally derived values for contact resistance gave\nhysteresis values that were linearly related to (and only one order of\nmagnitude out) from the experimentally-measured values. Memristor hysteresis\nwas found to be related to the ON state resistance and thus the electrode size\n(as those two are related). These results offer a verification of the\nmemory-conservation theory of memristance and its association of the vacancy\nmagnetic flux with the missing magnetic flux in memristor theory. This is the\nfirst paper to experimentally test various theories pertaining to the operation\nof memristor devices. \n\n"}

The underlying\nmatrix product state (MPS) ansatz is a low-rank decomposition of the full\nconfiguration interaction tensor. The virtual dimension of the MPS controls the\nsize of the corner of the many-body Hilbert space that can be reached.\n  Whereas the MPS ansatz will only yield an efficient description for\nnoncritical one-dimensional systems, it can still be used as a variational\nansatz for other finite-size systems. Rather large virtual dimensions are then\nrequired. The two most important aspects to reduce the corresponding\ncomputational cost are a proper choice and ordering of the active space\norbitals, and the exploitation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian. By\ntaking care of both aspects, DMRG becomes an efficient replacement for exact\ndiagonalization in quantum chemistry.\n  DMRG and Hartree-Fock theory have an analogous structure. The former can be\ninterpreted as a self-consistent mean-field theory in the DMRG lattice sites,\nand the latter in the particles. It is possible to build upon this analogy to\nintroduce post-DMRG methods. Based on an approximate MPS, these methods provide\nimproved ans\\\"atze for the ground state, as well as for excitations.\nExponentiation of the single-particle (single-site) excitations for a Slater\ndeterminant (an MPS with open boundary conditions) leads to the Thouless\ntheorem for Hartree-Fock theory (DMRG), an explicit nonredundant\nparameterization of the entire manifold of Slater determinants (MPS\nwavefunctions). This gives rise to the configuration interaction expansion for\nDMRG. The Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation lies at the basis of auxiliary\nfield quantum Monte Carlo for Slater determinants. An analogous transformation\nfor spin-lattice Hamiltonians allows to formulate a promising variant for MPSs. \n\n"}

The FRET rate is controlled by the mirror up to distances\ncomparable to the donor-acceptor distance, that is, the few-nanometer range.\nFor vanishing distance, we find a complete inhibition or a four-fold\nenhancement, depending on dipole orientation. For mirror distances on the\nwavelength scale, where the well-known `Drexhage' modification of the\nspontaneous-emission rate occurs, the FRET rate is constant. Hence there is no\ncorrelation between the Foerster (or total) energy transfer rate and the LDOS.\nAt any distance to the mirror, the total energy transfer between a\nclosely-spaced donor and acceptor is dominated by Foerster transfer, i.e., by\nthe static dipole-dipole interaction that yields the characteristic\ninverse-sixth-power donor-acceptor distance dependence in homogeneous media.\nGeneralizing to arbitrary inhomogeneous media with weak dispersion and weak\nabsorption in the frequency overlap range of donor and acceptor, we derive two\nmain theoretical results. Firstly, the spatially dependent Foerster energy\ntransfer rate does not depend on frequency, hence not on the LDOS. Secondly the\nFRET rate is expressed as a frequency integral of the imaginary part of the\nGreen function. This leads to an approximate FRET rate in terms of the LDOS\nintegrated over a huge bandwidth from zero frequency to about 10 times the\ndonor emission frequency, corresponding to the vacuum-ultraviolet. Even then,\nthe broadband LDOS hardly contributes to the energy transfer rates. We discuss\npractical consequences including quantum information processing. \n\n"}

In this paper, we study the trapping problem in extended dendrimers\nwith generation-dependent segment lengths, which is different from that of\ncompact dendrimers where the length of the linear segments is fixed. We first\nconsider a particular case that the deep trap is located at the central node,\nand derive an exact formula for the average trapping time (ATT) defined as the\naverage of the source-to-trap mean first passage time over all starting points.\nThen, using the obtained result we deduce a closed-form expression for the ATT\nto an arbitrary trap node, based on which we further obtain an explicit\nsolution to the ATT corresponding to the trapping issue with the trap uniformly\ndistributed in the polymer systems.

Abstract: The definition of the classical transition state theory (TST) as a t= 0+\nlimit of the flux-side time correlation function relies on the assumption that\nsimultaneous measurement of population and flux is a well defined physical\nprocess. However, the noncommutativity of the two measurements in quantum\nmechanics makes the extension of such a concept to the quantum regime\nimpossible. For this reason, quantum TST (QTST) has been generally accepted as\nany kind of quantum rate theory reproducing the TST in the classical limit, and\nthere has been a broad consensus that no unique QTST retaining all the\nproperties of TST can be defined. Hele and Althorpe (HA) [J. Chem. Phys. 138,\n084108 (2013)] recently suggested that a true QTST can be defined as the exact\nt=0+ limit of a certain kind of quantum flux-side time correlation function and\nthat it is equivalent to the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) TST. This\nwork seeks to question and clarify certain assumptions underlying these\nsuggestions and their implications. First, the time correlation function used\nby HA as a starting expression is not related to the kinetic rate constant by\nvirtue of linear response theory, which is the first important step in relating\na t=0+ limit to a physically measurable rate. Second, a theoretical analysis\ncalls into question a key step in HA's proof which appears not to rely on an\nexact quantum mechanical identity. The correction of this makes the true t=0+\nlimit of HA's QTST different from the RPMD-TST rate expression, but rather\nequal to the well-known path integral quantum transition state theory rate\nexpression for the case of centroid dividing surface. An alternative path\nintegral quantum rate expression is then formulated based on the linear\nresponse theory.

In this work we rigorously show the shortcomings of various\nsimplifications that are used to calculate the total internal partition\nfunction. These shortcomings can lead to errors of up to 40 percent or more in\nthe estimated partition function. These errors carry on to calculations of\nthermodynamic quantities. Therefore a more complicated approach has to be\ntaken.\n  Methods. Seven possible simplifications of various complexity are described,\ntogether with advantages and disadvantages of direct summation of experimental\nvalues. These were compared to what we consider the most accurate and most\ncomplete treatment (case 8). Dunham coefficients were determined from\nexperimental and theoretical energy levels of a number of electronically\nexcited states of H$_2$ . Both equilibrium and normal hydrogen was taken into\nconsideration.\n  Results. Various shortcomings in existing calculations are demonstrated, and\nthe reasons for them are explained. New partition functions for equilibrium,\nnormal, and ortho and para hydrogen are calculated and thermodynamic quantities\nare reported for the temperature range 1 - 20000 K.

The calculations are not limited to the\nground electronic state, but include all bound and quasi-bound levels of\nexcited electronic states.

We discuss\nthe choice of partitioning for the perturbation theory, which is crucial for\nits accuracy and robustness. To circumvent the problem of a large bond\ndimension in the first-order wavefunction, we use a sum of matrix product\nstates (MPS) to expand the first-order wavefunction, yielding substantial\nsavings in computational cost and memory. We also propose extrapolation schemes\nto reduce the errors in the zeroth- and first-order wavefunctions. Numerical\nresults for Cr 2 with a (28e,76o) active space and 1,3-butadiene with a\n(22e,82o) active space reveal that p-DMRG provides ground state energies of a\nsimilar quality to variational DMRG with very large bond dimensions, but at a\nsignificantly lower computational cost.

In a waveguide or free space, this intuition is typically found\nthrough Fermi's Golden rule, however, this does not properly account for the\nwave-like nature of the photons. Here, I present an exact solution to\nstimulated emission from a quantum two-level atom that properly accounts for\nthe incoming and outgoing electromagnetic modes.

For a Fock state drive with large photon number, the exact\nsolution shows how a two-level system Rabi oscillates with the traveling Fock\nmode as it passes by. I additionally use the same formalism to show that\nstimulated emission by a coherent pulse cannot be understood as an additional\nphoton being emitted into the incident coherent state because the two-level\nsystem's state factorizes with the electromagnetic field's coherent state.\nRecent advances in superconducting circuits make them an ideal platform to test\nthese predictions. \n\n"}

Alavi et al. [S. D. Smart, G. H.\nBooth, and A. Alavi, unpublished] then approximated these weights with weights\nbased on Cauchy--Schwarz-like inequalities calculated on-the-fly. While\nreducing the memory cost, this algorithm scales linearly in system size\ncomputationally. We combine both these ideas with the single reference nature\nof many systems, and introduce a spawn-sampling algorithm that has low memory\nrequirements (quadratic in basis set size) compared to the heat bath algorithm\nand only scales either independently of system size (CCMC) or linearly in the\nnumber of electrons (FCIQMC). On small water chains with localized orbitals, we\nshow that it is equally efficient as the other excitation generators. As the\nsystem gets larger, it converges faster than the on-the-fly weight algorithm,\nwhile having a much more favourable memory scaling than the heat bath\nalgorithm. \n\n"}

Their realization,\nhowever, meets a major stumbling block -- the motion-induced dephasing of the\ntransition between the ground and Rydberg states. By using quantum interference\nbetween different detuned Rabi oscillations, we propose a practical scheme to\nrealize a class of accurate entangling Rydberg quantum gates subject to a\nminimal dephasing error. We show two types of such gates, $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$,\nin the form of $\\text{diag}\\{1, e^{i\\alpha}, e^{i\\gamma}, e^{i\\beta}\\}$, where\n$\\alpha, \\gamma$, and $\\beta$ are determined by the parameters of lasers and\nthe Rydberg blockade $V$. $U_{1}$ is realized by sending to the two qubits a\nsingle off-resonant laser pulse, while $U_{2}$ is realized by individually\napplying one pulse of detuned laser to each qubit. Our method has several\nadvantages. First, the gates are accurate because the fidelity of $U_k$ is\nlimited only by a rotation error below $10^{-5}$ and the Rydberg-state decay.\nDecay error on the order of $10^{-5}$ can be easily obtained because all\ntransitions are detuned, resulting in small population in Rydberg state.\nSecond, the motion-induced dephasing is minimized because there is no gap time\nin which a population is left in the Rydberg shelving states of either qubit.\nThird, the gate is resilient to the variation of $V$. This is because among the\nthree phases $\\alpha,\\gamma$, and $\\beta$, only the last has a (partial)\ndependence on $V$. Fourth, the Rabi frequency and $V$ in our scheme are of\nsimilar magnitude, which permits a fast implementation of the gate when both of\nthem are of the feasible magnitude of several megahertz. The rapidity,\naccuracy, and feasibility of this interference method can lay the foundation\nfor entangling gates in universal quantum computing with neutral atoms. \n\n"}
