Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

It was originally estimated that only one or two\nof the essential evolutionary steps had to have been hard in this sense, but it\nhas become apparent that this figure may need upward revision, because recent\nstudies of climatic instability suggest that the possible future duration of\nour biologically favourable environment may be shorter than had been supposed,\nonly about one Giga year rather than five. On the basis of the statistical\nrequirement of roughly equal spacing between hard steps, it is argued that the\nbest fit with the fossil record is now obtainable by postulating the number of\nhard steps to be five, if our evolution was exclusively terrestrial, or six if,\nas now seems very plausible, the first step occurred on Mars. \n\n"}

Indeed, merely a single case of a star-planet-disk\nsystem has previously been detected at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths.\nConsequently, one of our aims is to understand the reasons for these poor\nstatistics, i.e., whether these results reflected the composition and/or the\nphysics of the planetary disks or were simply due to observational bias and\nselection effects. Finding more examples would be very significant. The\nselected target, q1 Eri, is a solar-type star, which was known to possess a\nplanet, q1 Eri b, and to exhibit excess emission at IRAS wavelengths, but had\nremained undetected in the millimeter regime. Therefore, submm flux densities\nwould be needed to better constrain the physical characteristics of the\nplanetary disk. Consequently, we performed submm imaging observations of q1\nEri. The detected dust toward q1 Eri at 870 micron exhibits the remarkable fact\nthat the entire SED, from the IR to mm-wavelengths, is fit by a single\ntemperature blackbody function (60 K). This would imply that the emitting\nregions are confined to a narrow region (ring) at radial distances much larger\nthan the orbital distance of q1 Eri b, and that the emitting particles are\nconsiderably larger than some hundred micron. However, the 870 micron source is\nextended, with a full-width-half-maximum of roughly 600 AU.

Such binaries form after major galaxy\nmergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering\nbecomes very inefficient at sub-parsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary\ndynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the orbits of binaries embedded within\ngeometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly resolve angular momentum\ntransport within the disc, which at the radii of interest is likely dominated\nby disc self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good\nagreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation\nof eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e > 0.35. Accretion onto\nthe black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital\nfrequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of\nbinary decay that is possible without fragmentation occuring within the\nsurrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar\ndynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 10^5 < M/Msun < 10^8\nwe find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a ~\n0.01--0.1 pc, where the disc is optically thick. The minimum merger time scale\nis shorter than the Hubble time for M < 10^7 Msun.

Dark matter particles that end up within two virial\nradii of a Milky-Way-sized DM halo at $z=0$ have an approximately Gaussian\ndistribution in log(f) at early redshifts, but the distribution becomes\nincreasingly skewed at lower redshifts. The value corresponding to the peak of\nthe Gaussian decreases as the evolution progresses and is well described by a\npower-law in (1+z). The highest values of f are found at the centers of dark\nmatter halos and subhalos, where f can be an order of magnitude higher than in\nthe center of the main halo.

By performing an ensemble of radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show that such discs fragment within a few thousand years, and\nproduce mainlybrown dwarf (BDs) stars, but also planetary mass (PM) stars and\nvery low-mass hydrogen-burning (HB) stars. Most of the the PM stars and BDs are\nejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these\nstars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years\nthe Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and\ntwo much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.\nThere is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs\ntend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be\nscattered even further out, or even into the field. BDs form with discs of a\nfew Mj and radii of a few tens of AU, and they are more likely to retain these\ndiscs if they remain bound to the primary star.

For the respective scenarios, the lifetimes\nfor decaying dark matter are $\\Gamma^{-1} \\gtrsim 100$ Gyr and $ (f \\Gamma)\n^{-1} \\gtrsim 5.3 \\times 10^8$ Gyr (at 95.4% confidence level), where the\nphenomenological parameter $f$ is the fraction of the decay energy deposited in\nbaryonic gas. This allows us to constrain particle physics models with dark\nmatter candidates through investigation of dark matter decays into Standard\nModel particles via effective operators. For decaying dark matter of $\\sim 100$\nGeV mass, we found that the size of the coupling constant in the effective\ndimension-4 operators responsible for dark matter decay has to generically be $\n\\lesssim 10^{-22}$. We have also explored the implications of our analysis for\nrepresentative models in theories of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking,\nminimal supergravity and little Higgs. \n\n"}

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers\nafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably\ndissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be\napproximately proportional to the increase in mass. This model successfully\nreproduces the observed evolution since z~2 in the mean size and in the\ncomoving mass density of massive early-type galaxies.

In fact, the addition of a new contribution accounting for the\ngas can increase the statistical significance of the lensing model. We propose\na parametric method for strong lensing analyses which exploits multi-wavelength\nobservations.

The gas distribution is fitted to lensing data exploiting\nprior knowledge from X-ray observations.

It has been tentatively explained by the possible increase\nof planet formation probability in stellar disks with enhanced amount of\nmetals. However, there are two caveats to this explanation. First, giant stars\nwith planets do not show a metallicity distribution skewed towards metal-rich\nobjects, as found for dwarfs. Second, the correlation with metallicity is not\nvalid at intermediate metallicities, for which it can be shown that giant\nplanets are preferentially found orbiting thick disk stars.\n  None of these two peculiarities is explained by the proposed scenarios of\ngiant planet formation. We contend that they are galactic in nature, and\nprobably not linked to the formation process of giant planets. It is suggested\nthat the same dynamical effect, namely the migration of stars in the galactic\ndisk, is at the origin of both features, with the important consequence that\nmost metal-rich stars hosting giant planets originate from the inner disk, a\nproperty that has been largely neglected until now.

This implies that, at z ~ 0, or at low luminosity AGN levels,\nthere is an anti-correlation between Gamma and L/Ledd, opposite to the trend\nexhibited by high z AGN (quasars).

First, a\nkinematical model is constructed for SN Ia 2003hv, which can account for the\nmain features in its optical, Near-Infrared (NIR), and Mid-Infrared (Mid-IR)\nlate-time spectra. It is found that an asymmetric off-center model can explain\nthe observed characteristics of SN 2003hv. This model includes a relatively\nhigh density, Fe-rich region which displays a large velocity off-set, and a\nrelatively low density, extended 56Ni-rich region which is more spherically\ndistributed. The high density region consists of the inner stable Fe-Ni region\nand outer 56Ni-rich region. Such a distribution may be the result of a\ndelayed-detonation explosion, in which the first deflagration produces the\nglobal asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, while the subsequent detonation can\nlead to the bulk spherical symmetry. This configuration, if viewed from the\ndirection of the off-set, can consistently explain the blueshift in some of the\nemission lines and virtually no observed shift in other lines in SN 2003hv. For\nthis model, we then explore the effects of different viewing angles and the\nimplications for SNe Ia in general. The model predicts that a variation of the\ncentral wavelength, depending on the viewing angle, should be seen in some\nlines (e.g., [Ni II]7378), while the strongest lines (e.g., [Fe III] blend at\n4700A) will not show this effect.

The sample host stars have typical mass M_host 0.5 Msun, and\ndetection is sensitive to planets over a range of projected separations\n(R_E/s_max,R_E*s_max), where R_E 3.5 AU sqrt(M_host/Msun) is the Einstein\nradius and s_max (q/5e-5)^{2/3}, corresponding to deprojected separations ~3\ntimes the \"snow line\". Though frenetic, the observations constitute a\n\"controlled experiment\", which permits measurement of absolute planet\nfrequency. High-mag events are rare, but the high-mag channel is efficient:\nhalf of high-mag events were successfully monitored and half of these yielded\nplanet detections. The planet frequency derived from microlensing is a factor 7\nlarger than from RV studies at factor ~25 smaller separations [2<P<2000 days].\nHowever, this difference is basically consistent with the gradient derived from\nRV studies (when extrapolated well beyond the separations from which it is\nmeasured). This suggests a universal separation distribution across 2 dex in\nsemi-major axis, 2 dex in mass ratio, and 0.3 dex in host mass.

Observations of copper abundances rely on a very limited\nnumber of lines, the strongest are the Cu I lines of Mult. 1 at 324.7 nm and\n327.3 nm which can be measured even at extremely low metallicities. Aims. We\ninvestigate the quality of these lines as abundance indicators. Method. We\nmeasure these lines in two turn-off (TO) stars in the Globular Cluster NGC 6752\nand two TO stars in the Globular Cluster NGC 6397 and derive abundances with 3D\nhydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the CO5BOLD code. These\nabundances are compared to the Cu abundances measured in giant stars of the\nsame clusters, using the lines of Mult. 2 at 510.5 nm and 578.2 nm. Results.\nThe abundances derived from the lines of Mult. 1 in TO stars differ from the\nabundances of giants of the same clusters. This is true both using CO5BOLD\nmodels and using traditional 1D model atmospheres. The LTE 3D corrections for\nTO stars are large, while they are small for giant stars. Conclusions. The Cu I\nresonance lines of Mult. 1 are not reliable abundance indicators. It is likely\nthat departures from LTE should be taken into account to properly describe\nthese lines, although it is not clear if these alone can account for the\nobservations. An investigation of these departures is indeed encouraged for\nboth dwarfs and giants. Our recommendation to those interested in the study of\nthe evolution of copper abundances is to rely on the measurements in giants,\nbased on the lines of Mult. 2.

II.\n  Metallicity Abstract: We investigate the large-scale influence of outflows from AGNs in enriching\nthe IGM with metals in a cosmological context. We combine cosmological\nsimulations of large scale structure formation with a detailed model of metal\nenrichment, in which outflows expand anisotropically along the direction of\nleast resistance, distributing metals into the IGM. The metals carried by the\noutflows are generated by two separate stellar populations: stars located near\nthe central AGN, and stars located in the greater galaxy. Using this algorithm,\nwe performed a series of 5 simulations of the propagation of AGN-driven\noutflows in a cosmological volume of size (128/h Mpc)^3 in a Lambda-CDM\nuniverse, and analyze the resulting metal enrichment of the IGM. We found that\nthe metallicity induced in the IGM is greatly dominated by AGNs having\nbolometric luminosity L > 10^9 L_sun, sources with 10^8 < L / L_sun < 10^9\nhaving a negligible contribution. Our simulations produced an average IGM\nmetallicity of [O/H] = -5 at z = 5.5, which then rises gradually, and remains\nrelatively flat at a value [O/H] = -2.8 between z = 2 and z = 0. The ejection\nof metals from AGN host galaxies by AGN-driven outflows is found to enrich the\nIGM to > 10 - 20% of the observed values, the number dependent on redshift.

We find that the average LAT gamma-ray spectrum of\nMrk 501 can be well described by a single power-law function with a photon\nindex of 1.78 +/- 0.03. While we observe relatively mild flux variations with\nthe Fermi-LAT (within less than a factor of 2), we detect remarkable spectral\nvariability where the hardest observed spectral index within the LAT energy\nrange is 1.52 +/- 0.14, and the softest one is 2.51 +/- 0.20.

Importantly,\nthese environments consist just of electrons and ions and the dissipated energy\nalways stays with the plasma. In contrast, in this paper I introduce a new\ndirection of research, motivated by several important problems in high-energy\nastrophysics --- reconnection in high energy density (HED) radiative plasmas,\nwhere radiation pressure and radiative cooling become dominant factors in the\npressure and energy balance. I identify the key processes distinguishing HED\nreconnection: special-relativistic effects; radiative effects (radiative\ncooling, radiation pressure, and Compton resistivity); and, at the most extreme\nend, QED effects, including pair creation. I then discuss the main\nastrophysical applications --- situations with magnetar-strength fields\n(exceeding the quantum critical field of about 4 x 10^13 G): giant SGR flares\nand magnetically-powered central engines and jets of GRBs.

Apparent\n  Radii Abstract: The masses and radii of low-magnetic field neutron stars can be measured by\ncombining different observable quantities obtained from their X-ray spectra\nduring thermonuclear X-ray bursts. One of these quantities is the apparent\nradius of each neutron star as inferred from the X-ray flux and spectral\ntemperature measured during the cooling tails of bursts, when the thermonuclear\nflash is believed to have engulfed the entire star. In this paper, we analyze\n13,095 X-ray spectra of 446 X-ray bursts observed from 12 sources in order to\nassess possible systematic effects in the measurements of the apparent radii of\nneutron stars. We first show that the vast majority of the observed X-ray\nspectra are consistent with blackbody functions to within a few percent. We\nfind that most X-ray bursts follow a very well determined correlation between\nX-ray flux and temperature, which is consistent with the whole neutron-star\nsurface emitting uniformly during the cooling tails. We develop a Bayesian\nGaussian mixture algorithm to measure the apparent radii of the neutron stars\nin these sources, while detecting and excluding a small number of X-ray bursts\nthat show irregular cooling behavior. This algorithm also provides us with a\nquantitative measure of the systematic uncertainties in the measurements. We\nfind that those errors in the spectroscopic determination of neutron-star radii\nthat are introduced by systematic effects in the cooling tails of X-ray bursts\nare in the range $\\simeq 3-8$%. Such small errors are adequate to distinguish\nbetween different equations of state provided that uncertainties in the\ndistance to each source and the absolute calibration of X-ray detectors do not\ndominate the error budget. \n\n"}

The data are from our proper-motion (PM) survey of Kapteyn's\nSelected Areas, in which we have measured accurate PMs to faint magnitudes in\n40x40 arcmin fields evenly spaced across the sky. The radial velocity (RV)\nsignature of Sgr has been identified among our follow-up spectroscopic data in\nfour of the six fields and combined with mean PMs of\nspectroscopically-confirmed members to derive space motions of Sgr debris based\non 15-64 confirmed stream members per field. These kinematics are compared to\npredictions of the Law & Majewski (2010) model of Sgr disruption; we find\nreasonable agreement with model predictions in RVs and PMs along Galactic\nlatitude. However, an upward adjustment of the Local Standard of Rest velocity\nTheta_LSR from its standard 220 km/s to at least $232\\pm14$ km/s (and possibly\nas high as $264\\pm23$ km/s) is necessary to bring 3-D model debris kinematics\nand our measurements into agreement. Satisfactory model fits that\nsimultaneously reproduce known position, distance, and radial velocity trends\nof the Sgr tidal streams, while significantly increasing Theta_LSR}, could only\nbe achieved by increasing the Galactic bulge and disk mass while leaving the\ndark matter halo fixed to the best-fit values from Law & Majewski (2010).

The optimization is performed by\nminimizing several volume integrals which would vanish for an exact\nRobertson-Walker metric. Covariance is automatic. Foliation of space-time is\npart of the optimization procedure. Only the metric is involved in the\nprocedure, no assumptions about the origin of the energy-momentum tensor are\nneeded. A scale factor does not show up during the optimization process, the\noptimal scale factor is determined at the end. The general formulation is non\nperturbative. An explicit perturbative treatment is possible. The shifts which\nlead to the optimal coordinates obey Euler-Lagrange equations which are\nformulated and solved in first order of the perturbation. The extension to\nsecond order is sketched, but turns out to be unnecessary. The only freedom in\nthe choice of coordinates which finally remains are the rigid transformations\nwhich keep the form of the Robertson-Walker metric intact, i.e. translations in\nspace and time, spatial rotations, and spatial scaling. Spatial averaging\nbecomes trivial. In first order of the perturbation there is no backreaction. A\nsimplified second order treatment results in a very small effect, excluding the\npossibility to mimic dark energy from backreaction.

Physical and kinematical\ndifferences can be seen at the two shocked positions. At the R4 position, two\nvelocity components with different excitation can be distinguished, with the\ncomponent at higher velocity (R4-HV) being less extended and less dense than\nthe low velocity component (R4-LV).

The\nhydrodynamics of the interaction between a jet and a clumpy wind is studied,\nfocusing on the global wind and single clump-jet interplay. We have performed,\nusing the code \\textit{Ratpenat}, three-dimensional numerical simulations of a\nclumpy wind interacting with a mildly relativistic jet, and of individual\nclumps penetrating into a jet. For typical wind and jet velocities, filling\nfactors of about > 0.1 are already enough for the wind to be considered as\nclumpy. An inhomogeneous wind makes the jet more unstable when crossing the\nsystem. Kinetic luminosities of the order 1.e37 erg/s allow the jet to reach\nthe borders of a compact binary with an O star, as in the smooth wind case,\nalthough with a substantially higher degree of disruption. When able to enter\ninto the jet, clumps are compressed and heated during a time of about their\nsize divided by the sound speed in the shocked clump.

One of the key questions is how\nthese disks form so close to their host black holes and under what condition\nthey form stars in a tidally stressed environment.

This suggests that the majority of them either are not blazars\nor have spectral energy distributions contaminated by their host galaxies. A\nsignificant fraction of true blazars are found to be hosted by star-forming\ngalaxies. This finding, supported by an analysis of blazars detected in Planck\n545 and 857 GHz bands, is at odds with the notion that blazar hosts are passive\nellipticals and indicates that the sub-mm selection is providing a novel\nprospect on blazar properties.

No\nprogenitor system has ever been identified either in the pre- or post-explosion\nimages of a Ia event. There have been recent claims for and against the\ndetection of ex-companion stars in several SNe Ia remnants. These studies,\nhowever, usually ignore the angular momentum gain of the progenitor WD, which\nleads to a spin-up phase and a subsequent spin-down phase before explosion. For\nspin-down timescales greater than 10^5 years, the donor star could be too dim\nto detect by the time of explosion.

For the stellar core collapse simulation, we present the\nlatest numerical results. We employed a purely nucleonic EOS (Shen-EOS). As an\ninitial condition, we adopted a 100 $M_{\\odot}$ presupernova model calculated\nby Umeda and Nomoto. Changing the degree of rotation for the initial condition,\nwe clarify the strong dependence of the outcome of the collapse on this. When\nthe rotation is rapid enough, the shock wave formed at the core bounce is\ndeformed to be a torus-like shape. Then, the infalling matter is accumulated in\nthe central region due to the oblique shock at the torus surface, hitting the\nPNS and dissipating the kinetic energy there. As a result, outflows can be\nlaunched. The PNS eventually collapses to a BH and an accretion torus is formed\naround it. We also found that the evolution of the BH and torus depends\nstrongly on the rotation initially given. In the BNS merger simulations, we in\naddition employ an EOS incorporating a degree of freedom for hyperons. The\nnumerical simulations show that for the purely nucleonic EOS, a HMNS with a\nlong lifetime ($\\gg 10$ ms) is the outcome for the total mass $M \\lesssim\n3.0M_{\\odot}$.

Assuming that the observed MIR\nemission is radiation from an accretion disk reprocessed in a surrounding dusty\ntorus that subtends a solid angle decreasing with increasing luminosity (as\ninferred from the declining fraction of obscured AGNs), the intrinsic disk\nluminosity, L_D, is approximately proportional to the luminosity of the corona\nin the 2-300 keV energy band, L_C, with the L_D/L_C ratio varying by a factor\nof 2.1 around a mean value of 1.6.

Four models are\nproposed, all based on the standard assumption that cores are randomly\norientated ellipsoids, and on the further assumption that a core's shape is not\ncorrelated with its absolute size. The first and simplest model, M1, has a\nsingle free parameter, and assumes that the relative axes of a core are drawn\nrandomly from a log-normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation\n\\sigma o. The second model, M2a, has two free parameters, and assumes that the\nlog-normal distribution (with standard deviation \\sigma o) has a finite mean,\n\\mu o, defined so that \\mu o<0 means elongated (prolate) cores are favoured,\nwhereas \\mu o>0 means flattened (oblate) cores are favoured.

Only\nthree confirmed novae and three SSSs have been discovered in globular clusters\n(GCs) of any galaxy so far, of which one nova and two SSSs (including the nova)\nwere found in M 31 GCs. To study the SSS state of CNe we carried out a\nhigh-cadence X-ray monitoring of the M 31 central area with XMM-Newton and\nChandra. We analysed X-ray and optical data of a new transient X-ray source in\nthe M 31 GC Bol 126, discovered serendipitously in Swift observations. Our\noptical data set was based on regular M 31 monitoring programmes from five\ndifferent small telescopes. Additionally, we made use of Pan-STARRS 1 data\nobtained during the PAndromeda survey. Our observations reveal that the X-ray\nsource in Bol 126 is the third SSS in an M 31 GC and can be confirmed as the\nsecond CN in the M 31 GC system. This nova is named M31N 2010-10f. Its\nproperties in the X-ray and optical regimes agree with a massive white dwarf\n(M_WD >~ 1.3 M_sun) in the binary system. Incorporating the data on previously\nfound (suspected) novae in M 31 GCs we used our high-cadence X-ray monitoring\nobservations to estimate a tentative nova rate in the M 31 GC system of 0.05\n/yr/GC. An optical estimate, based on the recent 10.5-year WeCAPP survey, gives\na lower nova rate, which is compatible with the X-ray rate on the 95%\nconfidence level. There is growing evidence that the nova rate in GCs is higher\nthan expected from primordial binary formation and under conditions as in the\nfield.

This scenario is\nattractive for the progenitor systems of present-day massive globular clusters\n(GCs) which likely had masses M \\gtrsim 10^7\\msun. In such clusters, supernovae\nand stellar winds cannot provide a plausible explanation for the sudden removal\nof the primordial gas reservoir that is required to explain their complex\nchemical enrichment history.\n  In order to consider different regimes in the gas accretion rate onto\nstellar-mass BHs, we consider both the Bondi-Hoyle and Eddington\napproximations. For either model, our results show that the gas can be\nsignificantly depleted within only a few tens of Myrs. This process will affect\nthe distribution of BH masses, and may accelerate the dynamical decoupling of\nthe BH population and, ultimately, their dynamical ejection. Moreover, the\ntimescales for gas depletion are sufficiently short that the accreting BHs\ncould significantly affect the chemistry of subsequent star formation episodes.\n  The gas depletion times and final mass in BHs are sensitive to the assumed\nmodel for the accretion rate, and to the initial mass of the most massive BH\nwhich, in turn, is determined by the upper mass cut-off of the stellar IMF. Our\nresults imply that the remnant accretion history can have an important bearing\non the observed present-day cluster mass-to-light ratio.

A variety of temperature and abundance\nretrieval approaches have been applied to exoplanet spectra, but no previous\ninvestigations have sought to compare these approaches. In this investigation\nwe compare three different retrieval methods: Optimal Estimation, Differential\nEvolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Bootstrap Monte Carlo. We call our\nsuite of retrieval algorithms the Caltech Inverse Modeling and Retrieval\nAlgorithms (CHIMERA). We discuss what we can expect in terms of uncertainties\nin abundances and temperatures given current observations as well as potential\nfuture observations and what conclusions can be drawn given those\nuncertainties. In general we find that the three approaches agree for high\nquality spectra expected to come from potential future spaceborne missions, but\ndisagree for low quality spectra representative of current observations. We\nalso show that the Gaussian posterior probability distribution assumption made\nin the Optimal Estimation approach is valid for high quality spectral data. We\nalso discuss the implications of our models for the inferred C to O ratios of\nexoplanetary atmospheres, which of course are important for understanding\nformation environments. More specifically we show that in the observational\nlimit of a few photometric points, the retrieved C/O is biased towards values\nnear solar and near one simply due to the assumption of uninformative priors. \n\n"}

Aims: We intended to find the X-ray coronal counterpart of the\nchromospheric cycle for i Hor. This represents the first X-ray cycle observed\nin an active star, as well as the paradigm of the first coronal cycles in the\nlife of a solar-like star. Methods: We monitored i Hor with XMM-Newton\nobservations spanning almost two years. The spectra of each observation are fit\nwith two-temperature coronal models to study the long-term variability of the\nstar. Results: We find a cyclic behavior in X-rays very similar to the\ncontemporaneous chromospheric cycle. The continuous chromospheric monitoring\nfor more than three cycle lengths shows a trend toward decreasing amplitude,\napparently modulated by a longer term trend. The second cycle is disrupted\nprior to reaching its maximum, followed by a brief episode of chaotic\nvariability before the cyclic behavior resumes, only to be disrupted again\nafter slightly more than one cycle.

The\n1.6 yr cycle is the shortest coronal one observed to date, and i Hor represents\nthe most active star for which a coronal activity cycle has been found.

It has\nbeen found that most O-stars are multiples. HD 150 136 is the nearest system to\nEarth with >100 M_sol, and provides a unique opportunity to study an extremely\nmassive system. Recently, evidence for the existence of a third component in HD\n150 136, in addition to the tight spectroscopic binary that forms the main\ncomponent, was found in spectroscopic observations. Our aim was to image and\nobtain astrometric and photometric measurements of this component using long\nbaseline optical interferometry to further constrain the nature of this\ncomponent. We observed HD150136 with the near-infrared instrument AMBER\nattached to the ESO VLT Interferometer. The recovered closure phases are robust\nto systematic errors and provide unique information on the source asymmetry.\nTherefore, they are of crucial relevance for both image reconstruction and\nmodel fitting of the source structure. The third component in HD 150 136 is\nclearly detected in the high-quality data from AMBER. It is located at a\nprojected angular distance of 7.3 mas, or about 13 AU at the line-of-sight\ndistance of HD 150 136, at a position angle of 209 degrees East of North, and\nhas a flux ratio of 0.25 with respect to the inner binary. We resolved the\nthird component of HD 150 136 in J, H and K filters. The luminosity and color\nof the tertiary agrees with the predictions and shows that it is also an O\nmain-sequence star. The small measured angular separation indicates that the\ntertiary may be approaching the periastron of its orbit.

Recent studies have reported relatively weak\ncorrelations between observed AGN luminosities and the properties of AGN hosts,\nwhich has been interpreted to imply that there is no direct connection between\nAGN activity and star formation. However, AGNs may be expected to vary\nsignificantly on a wide range of timescales (from hours to Myr) that are far\nshorter than the typical timescale for star formation (>~100 Myr). This\nvariability can have important consequences for observed correlations. We\npresent a simple model in which all star-forming galaxies host an AGN when\naveraged over ~100 Myr timescales, with long-term average AGN accretion rates\nthat are perfectly correlated with the star formation rate (SFR). We show that\nreasonable prescriptions for AGN variability reproduce the observed weak\ncorrelations between SFR and L_AGN in typical AGN host galaxies, as well as the\ngeneral trends in the observed AGN luminosity functions, merger fractions, and\nmeasurements of the average AGN luminosity as a function of SFR. These results\nimply there may be a tight connection between AGN activity and SFR over galaxy\nevolution timescales, and that the apparent similarities in rest-frame colors,\nmerger rates, and clustering of AGNs compared to \"inactive\" galaxies may be due\nprimarily to AGN variability.

At high\naccretion rates the protostar's outer envelope continues to expand and the\neffective surface temperature remains low; such protostars do not exert strong\nradiative feedback and can grow in excess to one hundred solar masses. The\nobtained wide mass range suggests that the first stars play a variety of roles\nin the early universe, by triggering both core-collapse supernovae and\npair-instability supernovae as well as by leaving stellar mass black holes. We\nfind certain correlations between the final stellar mass and the physical\nproperties of the star-forming cloud. These correlations can be used to\nestimate the mass of the first star from the properties of the parent cloud or\nof the host halo, without following the detailed protostellar evolution. \n\n"}

This uncertainty stems from a dearth of observational\nconstraints as well as the great dynamic range between the small scales (<1 pc)\nwhere the feedback occurs and the large scales of galaxies (>1 kpc) that are\nshaped by this feedback. To bridge this divide, in this paper we aim to assess\nobservationally the role of stellar feedback at the intermediate scales of HII\nregions. In particular, we employ multiwavelength data to examine several\nstellar feedback mechanisms in a sample of 32 HII regions in the Large and\nSmall Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively). Using optical, infrared,\nradio, and X-ray images, we measure the pressures exerted on the shells from\nthe direct stellar radiation, the dust-processed radiation, the warm ionized\ngas, and the hot X-ray emitting gas. We find that the warm ionized gas\ndominates over the other terms in all of the sources, although two have\ncomparable dust-processed radiation pressures to their warm gas pressures. The\nhot gas pressures are comparatively weak, while the direct radiation pressures\nare 1-2 orders of magnitude below the other terms. We discuss the implications\nof these results, particularly highlighting evidence for hot gas leakage from\nthe HII shells and regarding the momentum deposition from the dust-processed\nradiation to the warm gas. Furthermore, we emphasize that similar observational\nwork should be done on very young HII regions to test whether direct radiation\npressure and hot gas can drive the dynamics at early times. \n\n"}

The predicted SFR\ndensity and how much of this is contributed by galaxies with different stellar\nmasses and infrared luminosities are in agreement with observations. The model\npredicts a modest evolution of the HI density at z<3, which is also in\nagreement with the observations. The HI density is predicted to be always\ndominated by galaxies with SFR<1Msun/yr. This contrasts with the H2 density,\nwhich is predicted to be dominated by galaxies with SFR>10Msun/yr. Current\nhigh-redshift galaxy surveys are limited to detect carbon monoxide in galaxies\nwith SFR>30Msun/yr, which in our model make up, at most, 20% of the H2 in the\nuniverse.

One component exhibits a sawtooth-like\nvelocity waveform while the other is nearly sinusoidal. One method of\ngenerating such a hybrid is presented: a nonlinear model is developed for the\nfirst overtone mode, which, if excited to large amplitude, is found to drop\nstrongly in frequency and become highly non-sinusoidal. If the frequency drops\nsufficiently to become equal to the fundamental frequency, the two can become\nphase locked and form the desired hybrid. A relationship is assumed between the\nhybrid mode velocity and the observed light curve, which is approximated as a\npower series. An accurate fit of the hybrid model is made to actual Kepler data\nfor RR Lyr. The sinusoidal component may tend to stabilize the period of the\nhybrid which is found in real Blazhko data to be extremely stable. It is\nproposed that the variations in amplitude and phase might result from a\nnonlinear interaction with a third mode, possibly a nonradial mode at 3/2 the\nfundamental frequency.

For this task we use spectroscopic observations of\nseveral active regions taken by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer of\nthe Hinode mission.

Abstract: Using idealized 1-D Eulerian hydrodynamic simulations, we contrast the\nbehavior of isolated supernovae with the superbubbles driven by multiple,\ncollocated supernovae. Continuous energy injection via successive supernovae\ngoing off within the hot/dilute bubble maintains a strong termination shock.\nThis strong shock keeps the superbubble over-pressured and drives the outer\nshock well after it becomes radiative. Isolated supernovae, in contrast, with\nno further energy injection, become radiative quite early ($\\lesssim 0.1$ Myr,\n10s of pc), and stall at scales $\\lesssim 100$ pc.

Results\n  from scaling the ISM opacity Abstract: The opacity due to grains in the envelope of a protoplanet regulates the\naccretion rate of gas during formation, thus the final bulk composition of\nplanets with primordial H/He is a function of it. Observationally, for\nexoplanets with known mass and radius it is possible to estimate the bulk\ncomposition via internal structure models. We first determine the reduction\nfactor of the ISM grain opacity f_opa that leads to gas accretion rates\nconsistent with grain evolution models. We then compare the bulk composition of\nsynthetic low-mass and giant planets at different f_opa with observations. For\nf_opa=1 (full ISM opacity) the synthetic low-mass planets have too small radii,\ni.e., too low envelope masses compared to observations. At f_opa=0.003, the\nvalue calibrated with the grain evolution models, synthetic and actual planets\noccupy similar mass-radius loci. The mean enrichment of giant planets relative\nto the host star as a function of planet mass M can be approximated as\nZ_p/Z_star = beta*(M/M_Jup)^alpha. We find alpha=-0.7 independent of f_opa in\nsynthetic populations in agreement with the observational result (-0.71+-0.10).\nThe absolute enrichment level decreases from beta=8.5 at f_opa=1 to 3.5 at\nf_opa=0. At f_opa=0.003 one finds beta=7.2 which is similar to the\nobservational result (6.3+-1.0). We thus find observational hints that the\nopacity in protoplanetary atmospheres is much smaller than in the ISM even if\nthe specific value of the grain opacity cannot be constrained here. The result\nfor the enrichment of giant planets helps to distinguish core accretion and\ngravitational instability. In the simplest picture of core accretion where\nfirst a critical core forms and afterwards only gas is added, alpha=-1. If a\ncore accretes all planetesimals inside the feeding zone, alpha=-2/3.

We demonstrate here that the\nunderlying hosts of BCDs are distinct from the broad continuum of typical dwarf\nirregular galaxies, and that it is unlikely that most dwarf irregular galaxies\ncan transform into a BCD or vice versa. Furthermore, we find that the starburst\nin a BCD only brightens it on average by ~0.8 mag (factor of two), in agreement\nwith other studies. It appears that a BCD is a long-lived and distinct type of\ndwarf galaxy that exhibits an exceptionally concentrated matter distribution.\nWe suggest that it is this compact mass distribution that enables the strong\nstar formation events that characterize this class of dwarf galaxy, that the\ncompactness of the underlying host can be used as a distinguishing parameter\nbetween BCDs and other dwarf galaxies, and that it can also be used to identify\nBCDs which are not currently experiencing an intense starburst event. \n\n"}

Focusing on z = 1 and 2 we propose a method of environmental\ncalibration which can be applied to the next generation of low to medium\nresolution spectroscopic surveys. Using an up-to-date semi-analytic model of\ngalaxy formation, we measure the local density of galaxies in fixed apertures\non different scales. There is a clear correlation of density with halo mass for\nsatellite galaxies, while a significant population of low mass centrals is\nfound at high densities in the neighbourhood of massive haloes. In this case\nthe density simply traces the mass of the most massive halo within the\naperture. To identify central and satellite galaxies, we apply an\nobservationally motivated stellar mass rank method which is both highly pure\nand complete, especially in the more massive haloes where such a division is\nmost meaningful. Finally we examine a test case for the recovery of\nenvironmental trends: the passive fraction of galaxies and its dependence on\nstellar and halo mass for centrals and satellites. With careful calibration,\nobservationally defined quantities do a good job of recovering known trends in\nthe model. This result stands even with reduced redshift accuracy, provided the\nsample is deep enough to preserve a wide dynamic range of density. \n\n"}

Nonetheless, the metallicity change is\nnegligible, and the mass--metallicity relations, which are mainly generated by\nsupernova feedback at the first star burst, are preserved. \n\n"}

We find from our magnetograms that the\ndistributions of the vertical [B_v] and the horizontal [B_h] component of the\nmagnetic field over the area of the magnetic subregion are spatially well\ncorrelated; in contrast, the rise of a flux-tube loop would result in a\nqualitatively different pattern, with the maxima of the two magnetic-field\ncomponents spatially separated: the vertical field would be the strongest where\neither spot emerges, while the maximum horizontal-field strengths would be\nreached in between them.

CP stars exhibiting this phenomenon are normally\nclassified as alpha2 Canum Venaticorum (ACV) variables. It is important to\nincrease the sample of known rotational periods among CP stars by discovering\nnew ACV variables. The ASAS-3 data were cross-correlated with the Catalogue of\nAp, HgMn, and Am stars in order to analyse the light curves of bona fide CP and\nrelated stars. The light curves were downloaded and cleaned of outliers and\ndata points with a flag indicating bad quality. Promising candidates showing a\nlarger scatter than observed for constant stars in the corresponding magnitude\nrange were searched for periodic signals using a standard Fourier technique. In\ntotal, we found 323 variables, from which 246 are reported here for the first\ntime, and 77 were probably wrongly classified before. The observed variability\npattern of most stars is in accordance with an ACV classification.

Within this\nscheme, the angular parameter which defines quasi-elliptical isophotes is\ntransformed from the commonly used, but inappropriate, polar co-ordinate to the\n`eccentric anomaly'. This provides a superior description of deviations from\nellipticity, better capturing the true isophotal shape. Furthermore, this makes\nit possible to accurately recover both the surface brightness profile, using\nthe correct azimuthally-averaged isophote, and the two-dimensional model of any\ngalaxy: the hitherto ubiquitous, but artificial, cross-like features in\nresidual images are completely removed. The formalism has been implemented into\nthe IRAF tasks $Ellipse$ and $Bmodel$ to create the new tasks `$Isofit$', and\n`$Cmodel$'.

A\nwell-characterized stellar sample suggests at least two different relationships\nbetween rotation period and cycle period, with some stars exhibiting long and\nshort cycles simultaneously.

In this\nwork, we present new and archival observations of dual magnetic cycles in the\nyoung solar analog HD 30495, an $\\sim$1 Gyr-old G1.5V star with a rotation\nperiod near 11 days.

The\nreported preliminary lag measurements are for intermediate-luminosity quasars\nat 0.3<~z<0.8, including 9 Hbeta lags and 6 MgII lags, for the first time\nextending RM results to this redshift-luminosity regime and providing direct\nquasar black hole mass estimates over ~ half of cosmic time. The MgII lags also\nincrease the number of known MgII lags by several-fold, and start to explore\nthe utility of MgII for RM at high redshift. The location of these new lags at\nhigher redshifts on the observed BLR size-luminosity relationship is\nstatistically consistent with previous Hbeta results at z<0.3.

A coaddition image that is optimal for any\n  purpose in the background dominated noise limit Abstract: Image coaddition is one of the most basic operations that astronomers\nperform. In Paper~I, we presented the optimal ways to coadd images in order to\ndetect faint sources and to perfrom flux measurements under the assumption that\nthe noise is approximately Gaussian. Here, we build on these results and derive\nfrom first principles a coaddition technique which is optimal for any\nhypothesis testing and measurement (e.g., source detection, flux or shape\nmeasurements and star/galaxy separation), in the background-noise-dominated\ncase. This method has several important properties. The pixels of the resulting\ncoadd image are uncorrelated. This image preserves all the information (from\nthe original individual images) on all spatial frequencies. Any hypothesis\ntesting or measurement that can be done on all the individual images\nsimultaneously, can be done on the coadded image without any loss of\ninformation. The PSF of this image is typically as narrow, or narrower than the\nPSF of the best image in the ensemble. Moreover, this image is practically\nindistinguishable from a regular single image, meaning that any code that\nmeasures any property on a regular astronomical image can be applied to it\nunchanged. In particular, the optimal source detection statistic derived in\npaper~I is reproduced by matched filtering this image with its own PSF. This\ncoaddition process, which we call proper coaddition, can be understood as a the\nmaximum signal-to-noise ratio measurement of the Fourier transform of the\nimage, weighted in such a way that the noise in the entire Fourier domain is of\nequal variance. This method has important implications for multi-epoch\nseeing-limited deep surveys, weak lensing galaxy shape measurements, and\ndiffraction-limited imaging via speckle observations. The last topic will be\ncovered in depth in future papers. We provide an implementation of this\nalgorithm in MATLAB. \n\n"}

Our data release covers\n36,900 square degrees (or 3.6 pi steradians) of the sky between -53 deg and +90\ndeg DEC, which is 90 percent of the total sky. The majority of pointing images\nhave a background RMS noise below 5 mJy/beam with an approximate resolution of\n25\" x 25\" (or 25\" x 25\" / cos (DEC - 19 deg) for pointings south of 19 deg\nDEC). We have produced a catalog of 0.62 Million radio sources derived from an\ninitial, high reliability source extraction at the 7 sigma level. For the bulk\nof the survey, the measured overall astrometric accuracy is better than 2\" in\nRA and DEC, while the flux density accuracy is estimated at ~10 percent. Within\nthe scope of the TGSS ADR project, the source catalog as well as 5336 mosaic\nimages (5 deg x 5 deg) and an image cutout service, are made publicly available\nonline as a service to the astronomical community. Next to enabling a wide\nrange of different scientific investigations, we anticipate that these survey\nproducts provide a solid reference for various new low-frequency radio aperture\narray telescopes (LOFAR, LWA, MWA, SKA-low), and can play an important role in\ncharacterizing the EoR foreground. The TGSS ADR project aims at continuously\nimproving the quality of the survey data products. \n\n"}

In this paper, I initiate a study of possible self-interactions\nof ultralight scalar dark matter from the particle physics point of view.

Quite a few pNGB models with different potentials\nsuch as the QCD axion and the dilaton lead to attractive self-interactions. Yet\nif an axion is a remnant of a 5D gauged U(1) symmetry, its self-interactions\ncould be repulsive provided the masses and charges of the 5D matter\ncontributing to its potential satisfy certain constraints. Collective symmetry\nbreaking could also lead to a repulsive self-interaction yet with too large a\nstrength that is ruled out by Bullet Cluster constraints.

To correct the\nsystematic difference between DR7 and DR9 due to the different instrumental\nsetup, we produced a correction spectrum by using a sample of F-stars observed\nboth in DR7 and DR9.

We suggest that advanced civilizations could cloak their\npresence, or deliberately broadcast it, through controlled laser emission. Such\nemission could distort the apparent shape of their transit light curves with\nrelatively little energy, due to the collimated beam and relatively infrequent\nnature of transits. We estimate that humanity could cloak the Earth from\nKepler-like broadband surveys using an optical monochromatic laser array\nemitting a peak power of about 30 MW for roughly 10 hours per year. A chromatic\ncloak, effective at all wavelengths, is more challenging requiring a large\narray of tunable lasers with a total power of approximately 250 MW.\nAlternatively, a civilization could cloak only the atmospheric signatures\nassociated with biological activity on their world, such as oxygen, which is\nachievable with a peak laser power of just around 160 kW per transit. Finally,\nwe suggest that the time of transit for optical SETI is analogous to the\nwater-hole in radio SETI, providing a clear window in which observers may\nexpect to communicate.

The origin of the bars has\nremained as a long-standing problem -- what made bar formation possible in\ncertain S0s?\n  By analysing a large sample of S0s with classical bulges observed by the\nSpitzer space telescope, we find that most of our barred S0s host comparatively\nlow-mass classical bulges, typically with bulge-to-total ratio ($B/T$) less\nthan $0.5$; whereas S0s with more massive classical bulges than these do not\nhost any bar. Furthermore, we find that amongst the barred S0s, there is a\ntrend for the longer and massive bars to be associated with comparatively\nbigger and massive classical bulges -- possibly suggesting bar growth being\nfacilitated by these classical bulges. In addition, we find that the bulge\neffective radius is always less than the bar effective radius --indicating an\ninteresting synergy between the host classical bulge and bars being maintained\nwhile bar growth occurred in these S0s. \n\n"}

Physical properties derived from spectral energy\n  distributions Abstract: We characterise the physical nature of a 1.1 mm-selected, flux-limited, and\ninterferometrically followed up sample of SMGs in COSMOS. We used the MAGPHYS\ncode to fit the multiwavelength (UV-radio) SEDs of 16 of the target SMGs. We\nalso constructed the pure radio SEDs of our SMGs using three different radio\nbands (325 MHz, 1.4 GHz, and 3 GHz). Moreover, since two SMGs in our sample,\nAzTEC1 and AzTEC3, benefit from previous CO line observations, we studied their\nproperties in more detail. We found that 63% of our target SMGs lie above the\ngalaxy main-sequence by more than a factor of 3, and hence are starbursts. The\n3 GHz radio sizes we have previously measured for the target SMGs were compared\nwith the present stellar mass estimates, and we found that the z>3 SMGs are\nfairly consistent with the mass-size relationship of z~2 compact, quiescent\ngalaxies (cQGs). The median IR-radio correlation parameter is found to be\nq=2.27, which is lower than measured locally (median q=2.64). AzTEC1 is found\nto have a sub-Eddington SFR surface density (by a factor of 2.6), while AzTEC3\nappears to be an Eddington-limited starburster. The gas reservoir in these two\nhigh-z SMGs would be exhausted in only ~86 and 19 Myr at the current SFR,\nrespectively. A comparison of the MAGPHYS-based properties of our SMGs with\nthose of equally bright ALESS SMGs suggests that the two populations share\nfairly similar physical characteristics, including the q parameter. A hint of\nnegative correlation is found between the 3 GHz size and the level of\nstarburstiness, and hence cosmic-ray electrons in more compact starbursts might\nbe more susceptible to free-free absorption. Some of the derived low and high q\nvalues (compared to the local median) could be the result of a specific\nmerger/post-starburst phase of galaxy evolution. Overall, our results support\nthe scenario where z>3 SMGs evolve into today's giant ellipticals. \n\n"}

This scenario typically requires a large \"boost factor\" to be\nconsistent with a thermal relic dark matter candidate produced via freeze-out.\nHowever, such an explanation is disfavored by constraints from CMB observations\non energy deposition during the epoch of recombination. We discuss a scenario\ncalled late-decaying two-component dark matter (LD2DM), where the entire DM\nconsists of two semi-degenerate species. Within this framework, the heavier\nspecies is produced as a thermal relic in the early universe and decays to the\nlighter species over cosmological timescales. Consequently, the lighter species\nbecomes the DM which populates the universe today. We show that annihilation of\nthe lighter DM species with an enhanced cross-section, produced via such a\nnon-thermal mechanism, can explain the observed AMS-02 positron flux while\navoiding CMB constraints. The observed DM relic density can be correctly\nreproduced as well with simple s-wave annihilation cross-sections. We\ndemonstrate that the scenario is safe from CMB constraints on late-time energy\ndepositions during the cosmic \"dark ages\".

In this paper, we focus on the subset of WIMP models in which the\ndark matter annihilates in the early universe through couplings to either the\nStandard Model $Z$ or the Standard Model Higgs boson.

Aims: Attempt to,\nfor the first time, spectrally resolve CO thermal line emission in a small\nsample of AGB stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Methods: ALMA was used to\nobserve 2 OH/IR stars and 4 carbon stars in the LMC in the CO J= 2-1 line.\nResults: We present the first measurement of expansion velocities in\nextragalactic carbon stars. All four C-stars are detected and wind expansion\nvelocities and stellar velocities are directly measured. Mass-loss rates are\nderived from modelling the spectral energy distribution and Spitzer/IRS\nspectrum with the DUSTY code. Gas-to-dust ratios are derived that make the\npredicted velocities agree with the observed ones. The expansion velocities and\nMLRs are compared to a Galactic sample of well-studied relatively low MLRs\nstars supplemented with \"extreme\" C-stars that have properties more similar to\nthe LMC targets. Gas MLRs derived from a simple formula are significantly\nsmaller than derived from the dust modelling, indicating an order of magnitude\nunderestimate of the estimated CO abundance, time-variable mass loss, or that\nthe CO intensities in LMC stars are lower than predicted by the formula derived\nfor Galactic objects.

In total, this survey has resulted in the discovery of\n17 new gamma-ray pulsars, of which 13 are newly reported in this work, and an\naccompanying paper. These pulsars are all young, isolated pulsars with\ncharacteristic ages between 12 kyr and 2 Myr, and spin-down powers between\n$10^{34}$ and $4\\times10^{36}$ erg/s.

We focus\non large scales where cosmic density fields are quasi-linear. On these scales,\nthe clustering of galaxies can be described by a perturbative bias expansion,\nand the complicated physics of galaxy formation is absorbed by a finite set of\ncoefficients of the expansion, called bias parameters. The review begins with a\ndetailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the\nrigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions\nof General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key\ncomponents of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational\nobservables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their\ntime derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all\nthese contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the\npeak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical\nmeaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection\nbetween bias parameters and galaxy statistics. We then review the excursion-set\nformalism and peak theory which provide predictions for the values of the bias\nparameters.

In fact, the detection of such a\nrelic would bring us information from the pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN)\nperiod, an epoch from which we have no data, and could even hint at\ninflationary physics. In this work, we assume that the expansion rate of the\nUniverse after inflationary is governed by the kinetic energy of a scalar field\n$\\phi$, in the so-called \"kination\" model.

We explore the parameter space of this theory with the requirement\nthat the present WIMP abundance provides the correct DM relic budget.

However, variations in plasma parameters\nand magnetic field strength in the vicinity of a coronal reconnection site may\nlead to wave reflection and mode conversion. In this paper we investigate the\nreflection and refraction of fast magnetoacoustic waves near a reconnection\nsite.

Abstract: The first billion years in the evolution of the Universe mark the formation\nof the first stars, black holes and galaxies. The radiation from the first\ngalaxies plays an important role in determining the final state of primordial\ngas collapsing in a neighboring halo. This is due to the fact that the primary\ncoolant for primordial gas is molecular hydrogen, which can be dissociated into\natomic hydrogen by Lyman-Werner photons in the energy range $11.2 - 13.6$~eV.\nWhile cooling by molecular hydrogen leads to Pop. III star formation, cooling\nby atomic hydrogen can lead to the formation of a supermassive star (or\nquasi-star) which results in the formation of a massive $10^{4-5} M_\\odot$\nblack hole, or a direct collapse black hole.

Six previously unidentified waves in Saturn's middle\n  C ring Abstract: Recent studies of stellar occultations observed by the Visual and Infrared\nMapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft have demonstrated\nthat multiple spiral wave structures in Saturn's rings are probably generated\nby normal-mode oscillations inside the planet. Wavelet-based analyses have been\nable to unambiguously determine both the number of spiral arms and the rotation\nrate of many of these patterns. However, there are many more planetary normal\nmodes that should have resonances in the rings, implying that many normal modes\ndo not have sufficiently large amplitudes to generate obvious ring waves.\nFortunately, recent advances in wavelet analysis allow weaker wave signals to\nbe uncovered by combining data from multiple occultations. These new analytical\ntools reveal that a pattern previously identified as a single spiral wave\nactually consists of two superimposed waves, one with 5 spiral arms rotating at\n1593.6 degrees/day and one with 11 spiral arms rotating at 1450.5 degrees/day.\nFurthermore, a broad search for new waves revealed four previously unknown wave\npatterns with 6, 7, 8 and 9 spiral arms rotating around the planet at 1538.2\ndegrees/day, 1492.5 degrees/day, 1454.2 degrees/day and 1421.8 degrees/day,\nrespectively. These six patterns provide precise frequencies for another six\nfundamental normal modes inside Saturn, yielding what is now a complete\nsequence of fundamental sectoral normal modes with azimuthal wavenumbers from 2\nto 10. These frequencies should place strong constraints on Saturn's interior\nstructure and rotation rate, while the relative amplitudes of these waves\nshould help clarify how the corresponding normal modes are excited inside the\nplanet. \n\n"}

We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flows, in which a binary moves\nsupersonically relative to a homogeneous medium, using the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code FLASH. We simulate a range of values of the initial semi-major\naxis of the orbit relative to the gravitational focusing impact parameter of\nthe pair. When the binary separation is less than the gravitational focusing\nimpact parameter, the pair orbits within a shared bow shock. When the pair is\nwider, each object has an individual bow-shock structure. The long-term\nevolution of the binary is determined by the timescales for accretion, slowing\nof the center of mass, and orbital inspiral. We find a clear hierarchy of these\ntimescales; a binary's center-of-mass motion is slowed over a shorter timescale\nthan the pair inspirals or accretes. In contrast to previous analytic\npredictions, which assume an unperturbed background medium, we find that the\ntimescale for orbital inspiral is proportional to the semi-major axis to the\n$0.19 \\pm 0.01$ power. This positive scaling indicates that gaseous drag forces\ncan drive binaries either to coalescence or to the critical separation at which\ngravitational radiation dominates their further evolution. We discuss the\nimplications of our results for binaries embedded in the interstellar medium,\nactive galactic nuclei disks, and common envelope phases. \n\n"}

However, the proportionality of both\ncm and submm data to the star formation rate suggests that high resolution\nradio continuum maps with subarcsecond positional accuracy can be exploited to\nlocate submm sources. In this paper we present results from a targeted SCUBA\nsurvey of micro-Jansky radio sources in the flanking fields of the Hubble Deep\nField. Even with relatively shallow 850-micron SCUBA observations (>6 mJy at\n3-sigma), we were successful at making submm detections of optical/NIR-faint\n(I>24 and K~21-22) radio sources, and our counts closely match the bright\ncounts from submm surveys.

If the gas behind the bow shock expands adiabatically,\nand the source is expanding into a steeply falling atmosphere, then a narrow\ndense layer will form as the radio source lifts gas out of the cluster\npotential. This layer has a cooling time very much less than that of the gas\njust ahead of the radio source.

This decrease makes the tidal mass transfer\nrelatively more efficient at larger a, which means steepening when a is small\nand flattening when a is large, thus causing converges to a stable solution.\nGiven this mass-transfer recipe, linear perturbation analysis, supported by toy\nsimulations, shows that a sequence of cosmological mergers with homologous\nsatellites slowly leads to a fixed-point cusp with an asymptotic slope a_as>1.\nThe slope depends only weakly on the fluctuation power spectrum, in agreement\nwith cosmological simulations. During a long interim period the profile has an\nNFW-like shape, with a cusp of 1<a<a_as. Thus, a cusp is enforced if enough\ncompact satellite remnants make it intact into the inner halo.

We consider the possibility that the steepening may\nresult from a tenuous absorption component that is anticorrelated with large\nmass overdensities. UV sensitive satellites, whose detectors can extend down to\n1000 A, can set a useful limit to such an absorption component through the\nsearch of a flux increase in the window 1050-1190 A (observer frame) with\nrespect to an extrapolation of the continuum above 1230 A. Since the recent\nFUSE or HST-STIS data do not show any obvious discontinuity in this region,\nthis effectively rules out the possibility that intergalactic HI absorption is\nvery important, and it is concluded that most if not all of the steepening is\nintrinsic to quasars.

In particular, we find that\nterminal properties of bulges and their central SBHs are constrained by the\ndestruction of box orbits in the harmonic cores of dark haloes and the\nemergence of progressively less eccentric loop orbits there. SBH masses, M_SBH,\nshould exhibit a tighter correlation with bulge velocity dispersions, sigma_B,\nthan with bulge masses, M_B, in accord with observations, if there is a\nsignificant scatter in the M_H-sigma_H relation for the halo.

These two sources of\nabsorption are to a good approximation uncorrelated because of their wide\nphysical separation. Therefore, the two-point correlation of absorption in this\nregion of quasar spectra neatly factorizes into two pieces: the Lyb correlation\nat high z, and the Lya correlation at low z. The latter can be independently\nmeasured from quasar spectra at lower redshifts using current techniques. A\nsimple division then offers a way to statistically separate out the Lyb\ntwo-point correlation from the Lya correlation. Several applications of this\ntechnique are discussed. First, since the Lyb absorption cross-section is lower\nthan Lya by about a factor of 5, the Lyb forest is a better probe of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM) at higher redshifts where Lya absorption is often\nsaturated. Second, for the same reason, the Lyb forest allows a better\nmeasurement of the equation of state of the IGM at higher overdensities,\nyielding stronger constraints on its slope when used in conjunction with the\nLya forest. Third, models of the Lya forest based on gravitational instability\nmake unique predictions for the Lyb forest, which can be tested against\nobservations. We briefly point out that feedback processes that affect higher\ndensity regions but leave low density structure intact may be better\nconstrained by the Lyb forest. \n\n"}

SNe Ia have been proposed\nas the alternative dominant iron source. Different SN Ia progenitor models\npredict different ``delay functions'' between the formation of a stellar\npopulation and the explosion of some of its members as SNe Ia. We use our\nprevious measurements of the cluster SN Ia rate at high redshift to constrain\nSN Ia progenitor models and the star-formation epoch in clusters. The low\nobserved rate of cluster SNe Ia at z ~ 0 - 1 means that, if SNe Ia produced the\nobserved amount of iron, they must have exploded at even higher z. This puts a\n>95% upper limit on the mean SN Ia delay time of tau <2 Gyr (<5 Gyr) if the\nstars in clusters formed at redshift z<2 (z<3), assuming Ho=70 km/s/Mpc.

{"id": "astro-ph/0310147", "contents": "Title: The Dependence of the Galaxy Luminosity Function on Large-Scale\n  Environment Abstract: A basic assumption in current halo occupation model is that the properties of\na galaxy depend only on the mass of its dark matter halo. An important\nconsequence of this is that the segregation of the galaxy population by\nlarge-scale environment is entirely due to the environmental dependence of the\nhalo population. In this paper we use such a model to predict how the galaxy\nluminosity function depends on large-scale environment. The latter is\nrepresented by the density contrast (delta) averaged over a spherical volume of\nradius R=8Mpc/h. The model predicts that the Schechter function is a good\napproximation to the luminosity functions of galaxies brighter than ~10^9\nh^{-2}L_sun (b_j-band) in virtually all environments. The characteristic\nluminosity, L^{\\star}, increases moderately with \\delta. The faint-end slope,\n\\alpha, on the other hand, is quite independent of $\\delta$. However, when\nsplitting the galaxy population into early and late types, it is found that for\nlate-types \\alpha is virtually constant, whereas for early-types \\alpha\nincreases from ~-0.3 in underdense regions (\\delta~-0.5) to ~-0.8 in highly\noverdense regions with \\delta ~ 10. The luminosity function at L_{b_j}<10^9\nh^{-2} L_sun is significantly steeper than the extrapolation of the Schechter\nfunction that fits the brighter galaxies. This steepening is more significant\nfor early-types and in low-density environments. The model also predicts that\nthe luminosity density and mass density are closely correlated. The relation\nbetween the two is monotonic but highly non-linear. This suggests that one can\nuse the luminosity density, averaged over a large volume, to rank the mass\ndensity. This, in turn, allows the environmental effects predicted here to be\ntested by observations. \n\n"}

In the model, both ions interact with several\nresonant modes. When one of these modes dominates, the acceleration rate is\nreduced considerably. At low energies, this happens for $^4$He, but not for\n$^3$He where contributions from the two stronger modes are comparable so that\nacceleration of $^3$He is very efficient. As a result, the acceleration of\n$^4$He is suppressed by a barrier below $\\sim 100$ keV nucleon$^{-1}$ and there\nis a prominent quasi-thermal component in the $^4$He spectra, while almost all\nthe injected $^3$He ions are accelerated to high energies.

If most of the\naccretion happens at constant \\dot{M_BH}/M_BH the local SMBH mass function is\nfully accounted for by mass accreted by X-ray selected AGNs, with bolometric\ncorrections indicated by current observations and a standard mass-to-light\nconversion efficiency \\epsilon ~10%. The analysis of the accretion history\nhighlights that the most massive BHs accreted their mass faster and at higher\nredshifts (z>1.5), while the lower mass BHs responsible for most of the hard\nX-ray background have mostly grown at z<1.5. The accreted mass function matches\nthe local SMBH mass function if \\epsilon ~0.09(+0.04,-0.03) and the Eddington\nratio \\lambda=L/L_Edd \\~0.3(+0.3,-0.1) (68% confidence errors). The visibility\ntime, during which AGNs are luminous enough to be detected by the currently\navailable X-ray surveys, ranges from ~0.1 Gyr for present day BH masses\nM_BH(z=0) ~10^6 M_sun to ~0.3 Gyr for M_BH(z=0) >= 10^9 M_sun.

We first\nisolate the effects of stellar contributions (direct+scattered) to the SED\nusing homologous \"Class I\" models, where the shape of the thermal contribution\nto the SED remains constant. Stellar light contributes relatively more to the\nMIR emission of YSOs with lower temperature stars (Tstar ~4000 K) because the\nemission peak wavelength of the star is closer to that of the thermal\nradiation. Next we consider realistic Class 0, I, and II source models and find\nthat the other dominant effect of varying stellar temperature on YSO SEDs is\nthat of the inner disk wall: In high-Tstar models, the dust destruction radius\nis much further out with a consequently larger inner disk wall that contributes\nrelatively more to the 2-10 um flux.

In our most sophisticated models, we put stars\non realistic orbits around Sgr A*, include `slow' winds (300 km/s), and account\nfor radiative cooling. We first model only one phase `fast' stellar winds (1000\nkm/s). For wind sources fixed in space, the accretion rate is Mdot ~ 1e-5\nMsun/yr, fluctuates by < 10%, and is in a good agreement with previous models.\nIn contrast, Mdot decreases by an order of magnitude for stars following\ncircular orbits, and fluctuates by ~ 50%. Then we allow a fraction of stars to\nproduce slow winds. Much of these winds cool radiatively, forming cold clumps\nimmersed into the X-ray emitting gas. We test two orbital configurations for\nthe stars in this scenario, an isotropic distribution and two rotating discs\nwith perpendicular orientation. The morphology of cold gas is quite sensitive\nto the orbits. In both cases, however, most of the accreted gas is hot, with an\nalmost constant Mdot ~ 3e-6 Msun/yr, consistent with Chandra observations. The\ncold gas accretes in intermittent, short but powerful episodes which may give\nrise to large amplitude variability in the luminosity of Sgr A* on time scales\nof 10s to 100s of years. The circularisation radii for the flows are ~ 1e3 and\n1e4 Rsch, for the one and two-phase wind simulations, respectively, never\nforming the quasi-spherical accretion flows suggested in some previous work.\nOur work suggests that, averaged over time scales of 100s to 1000s of years,\nthe radiative and mechanical luminosity of Sgr A* may be substantially higher\nthan it is in its current state. Further improvements of the wind accretion\nmodelling of Sgr A* will rely on improved observational constraints for the\nwind properties and stellar orbits. \n\n"}

The\nearly X-ray afterglows show a canonical behavior, where the light curve broadly\nconsists of three distinct power law segments: (i) an initial very steep decay\n(t^{-alpha} with 3<alpha_1<5), followed by (ii) a very shallow decay\n(0.2<alpha_2<0.8), and finally (iii) a somewhat steeper decay (1<alpha_3<1.5).\nThese power law segments are separated by two corresponding break times,\n300s<t_{break,1}<500s and 10^3s<t_{break,2}<10^4s. On top of this canonical\nbehavior of the early X-ray light curve, many events have superimposed X-ray\nflares, which are most likely caused by internal shocks due to long lasting\nsporadic activity of the central engine, up to several hours after the GRB.

The correlation of SFR/M$_*$ with the continuum\nbreak strength at 4000 \\AA is also confirmed. The SFR/M$_*$ - M$_*$ correlation\nis found for both the early- and late-type galaxies, indicating that the star\nformation activity tends to be suppressed when the assembled stellar mass\nM$_*$) increases, and this correlation is tighter and steeper for the late-type\ncluster galaxies. Compared with the mass range of field spiral galaxies, only\ntwo massive late-type galaxies with M$_*>10^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$ are survived in\nA2255, suggesting that the gas disks of massive spiral galaxies could have been\ntidally stripped during cluster formation.

This may suggest that the galaxy-scale\nturbulence stimulated by the merging of subclusters might have played different\nroles on early- and late-type galaxies, which leads to a suppression of the\nstar formation activity for E/S0 galaxies and a SFR enhancement for spiral and\nirregular galaxies. \n\n"}

Caustics are places where the CDM\nparticles are naturally focussed. Our focus is upon the caustic rings which are\nclosed tubes whose cross-section is an elliptic umbilic catastrophe with three\ndual cusps. A caustic ring has a specific density profile, a specific geometry\nand, therefore, precisely calculable gravitational lensing signatures. The\nmagnification monotonically increases as the line of sight approaches to the\ncusps where it diverges in the limit of zero velocity dispersion. In this\nlimit, we find 37% magnification at a sample point near the outer cusps of the\nCDM caustic rings at cosmological distances. In the presence of finite velocity\ndispersion, the lower and upper bounds of the effective velocity dispersions of\nthe axion and WIMP flows in galactic halos may be used to constrain the lensing\neffects at the cusps. For a cosmological axion caustic ring, we find that the\nmagnification may range between 3% and 2800% at the outer cusp, and between 2%\nand 46% at the non-planer cusps.

Using data from the Burst Alert and X-Ray Telescopes, we show that the\nX-ray light curve can be well described by an exponential that relaxes into a\npower law, often with flares superimposed. The transition time between the\nexponential and the power law provides a physically defined timescale for the\nburst duration. In most bursts the power law breaks to a shallower decay within\nthe first hour, and a late emission \"hump\" is observed which can last for many\nhours. In other GRBs the hump is weak or absent. The observed variety in the\nshape of the early X-ray light curve can be explained as a combination of three\ncomponents: prompt emission from the central engine; afterglow; and the late\nhump. In this scenario, afterglow emission begins during or soon after the\nburst and the observed shape of the X-ray light curve depends on the relative\nstrengths of the emission due to the central engine and that of the afterglow.\nThere is a strong correlation such that those GRBs with stronger afterglow\ncomponents have brighter early optical emission.

Our\nsimulations consistently describe the formation of the structure and its\nchemical enrichment within a cosmological context. Our results indicate that\nthe luminosity-metallicity (LZR) and the stellar mass-metallicity (MZR)\nrelations are naturally generated in a hierarchical scenario. Both relations\nare found to evolve with redshift. In the case of the MZR, the estimated\nevolution is weaker than that deduced from observational works by approximately\n0.10 dex. We also determine a characteristic stellar mass, $M_c \\approx 3\n\\times 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$, which segregates the simulated galaxy population\ninto two distinctive groups and which remains unchanged since $z\\sim 3$, with a\nvery weak evolution of its metallicity content.

Therefore, the lightcurve is directly\nrelated to the density profile of the CSM. The density can either decrease with\nthe radius squared (as is the case for a freely expanding stellar wind) or be\nconstant (as we would expect for shocked wind or the interstellar medium).\nSecondly, material between the GRB and the observer will absorb part of the\nafterglow radiation, causing absorption lines in the afterglow spectrum.

This is\ndone via a regression analysis of the 100 micron DIRBE map against the Leiden-\nDwingeloo map of H_I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a\nsuitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 micron flux. For the 100 micron map, no\nsignificant CIB is detected.

X-ray light curves and spectra from the ROSAT, Ginga, and ASCA\nobservatories show that the uneclipsed flux varies by as much as a factor of\ntwenty between a high-flux state when 0.71 second pulses are present and a\nlow-flux state when pulses are absent. In contrast, during eclipses when the\nX-rays consist of radiation scattered from circumsource matter, the fluxes and\nspectra in the high and low states are approximately the same. These\nobservations prove that the low state of SMC X-1 is not caused by a reduction\nin the intrinsic luminosity of the source, or a spectral redistribution\nthereof, but rather by a quasi-periodic blockage of the line of sight, most\nlikely by a precessing tilted accretion disk. In each of two observations in\nthe midst of low states a brief increase in the X-ray flux and reappearance of\n0.71 second pulses occurred near orbital phase 0.2.

Naively one would expect that supersymmetry enhances bosonic preheating\nas it introduces new scalars such as squarks and sleptons. On the contrary, we\npoint out that preheating is unlikely within supersymmetry. The reason is that\nflat directions in the scalar potential, classified by gauge invariant\ncombinations of slepton and squark fields, are generically displaced towards a\nlarge vacuum expectation value (VEV) in the early Universe. They induce\nsupersymmetry preserving masses to the inflaton decay products through the\nStandard Model Yukawa couplings, which kinematically blocks preheating for VEVs\n$> 10^{13}$ GeV.

This poses fundamental problems for string theory,\nsince a scattering matrix is not well defined in such Universes. In a previous\npaper we have presented a model, based on (non-equilibrium) non-critical\nstrings, which is characterized by eventual ``graceful'' exit from a de Sitter\nphase. The model is based on a type-0 string theory, involving D3 brane worlds,\nwhose initial quantum fluctuations induce the non criticality. We argue in this\narticle that this model is compatible with the current observations. A crucial\nr\\^ole for the correct ``phenomenology'' of the model is played by the relative\nmagnitude of the flux of the five form of the type 0 string to the size of five\nof the extra dimensions, transverse to the direction of the flux-field. We do\nnot claim, at this stage at least, that this model is a realistic physical\nmodel for the Universe, but we find it interesting that the model cannot be\nruled out immediately, at least on phenomenological grounds. \n\n"}

Abstract: Current theoretical investigations seem to indicate the possibility of\nobserving signatures of short distance physics in the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground spectrum. We try to gain a deeper understanding on why all\ninformation about this regime is lost in the case of Black Hole radiation but\nnot necessarily so in a cosmological setting by using the moving mirror as a\ntoy model for both backgrounds. The different responses of the Hawking and\nCosmic Microwave Background spectra to short distance physics are derived in\nthe appropriate limit when the moving mirror mimics a Black Hole background or\nan expanding universe. The different sensitivities to new physics, displayed by\nboth backgrounds, are clarified through an averaging prescription that accounts\nfor the intrinsic uncertainty in their quantum fluctuations. We then proceed to\ninterpret the physical significance of our findings for time-dependent\nbackgrounds in the light of nonlocal string theory. \n\n"}

Such\nfrequencies are rather difficult to compute, even for Schwarzschild black\nholes. However, it is now quite likely that they may provide a fundamental link\nbetween classical general relativity and quantum theories of gravity. Here we\ncarry out the first numerical computation of very highly damped quasinormal\nmodes (QNM's) for charged and rotating black holes. In the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\ncase QNM frequencies and damping times show an oscillatory behaviour as a\nfunction of charge. The oscillations become faster as the mode order increases.\nAt fixed mode order, QNM's describe spirals in the complex plane as the charge\nis increased, tending towards a well defined limit as the hole becomes\nextremal. Kerr QNM's have a similar oscillatory behaviour when the angular\nindex $m=0$. For $l=m=2$ the real part of Kerr QNM frequencies tends to\n$2\\Omega$, $\\Omega$ being the angular velocity of the black hole horizon, while\nthe asymptotic spacing of the imaginary parts is given by $2\\pi T_H$. \n\n"}
