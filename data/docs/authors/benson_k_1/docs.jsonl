Since this site has an exponentially long lifetime, it may well be\ntoday's universe. We investigate specific scenarios based on this quantum\ndiffusion property of the cosmic landscape and find a plausible scenario for\nthe early universe. In the last fast tunneling to the $\\Lambda_0$\n($<\\Lambda_c$) site in this scenario, all energies are stored in the nucleation\nbubble walls, which are released to radiation only after bubble collisions and\nthermalization.

Here we generalize the step feature to include\nspace-dependence, allowing it also to model a breakdown of homogeneity and\nisotropy. The space-dependent inflaton potential generates a classical\ncurvature perturbation mode characterized by the wavenumber of the step\ninhomogeneity. For inhomogeneities small compared with the horizon at the step,\nspace-dependence has a small effect on the curvature perturbation. Therefore\nthe smoothly oscillating quantum power spectrum predicted by the homogeneous\nstep is robust with respect to sub-horizon space-dependence. For\ninhomogeneities equal to or greater than the horizon at the step, the\nspace-dependent classical mode can dominate, producing a curvature perturbation\nin which modes of wavenumber determined by the step inhomogeneity are\nsuperimposed on the oscillating power spectrum. Generation of a space-dependent\nstep feature may therefore provide a mechanism to introduce primordial\nanisotropy into the curvature perturbation. Space-dependence also modifies the\nquantum fluctuations, in particular via resonance-like features coming from\nmode coupling to amplified superhorizon modes.

{"id": "0912.0075", "contents": "Title: A Warm Molecular Hydrogen Tail Due to Ram Pressure Stripping of a\n  Cluster Galaxy Abstract: We have discovered a remarkable warm (130-160 K) molecular hydrogen tail with\na H_2 mass of approximately 4*10^7 solar masses extending 20 kpc from a cluster\nspiral galaxy, ESO 137-001, in Abell 3627. At least half of this gas is lost\npermanently to the intracluster medium, as the tail extends beyond the tidal\nradius of the galaxy. We also detect a hot (400-550 K) component in the tail\nthat is approximately 1% of the mass. The large H_2 line to IR continuum\nluminosity ratio in the tail indicates that star formation is not a major\nexcitation source and that the gas is possibly shock-heated. This discovery\nconfirms that the galaxy is currently undergoing ram-pressure stripping, as\nalso indicated by its X-ray and Halpha tails found previously. We estimate the\ngalaxy is losing its warm H_2 gas at a rate of ~ 2-3 solar masses per year. The\ntrue mass loss rate is likely higher if we account for cold molecular gas and\natomic gas. We predict that the galaxy will lose most of its gas in a single\npass through the core and place a strong upper limit on the ram-pressure\ntimescale of 1 Gyr. We also study the star-forming properties of the galaxy and\nits tail. We identify most of the previously discovered external Halpha sources\nwithin the tail in our 8 um data but not in our 3.6 um data; IRS spectroscopy\nof the region containing these Halpha sources also reveals aromatic features\ntypically associated with star formation. From the positions of these HII\nregions, it appears that star formation is not occurring throughout the\nmolecular hydrogen tail but only immediately downstream of the galaxy. Some of\nthese HII regions lie outside the tidal radius of the galaxy, indicating that\nram-pressure stripping can be a source of intracluster stars. \n\n"}

A direct dimensional reduction to two dimensions\ndoes not allow us to see the integrability of the theory in an easy way. This\nsituation is in contrast with vacuum five-dimensional gravity.

This is the first in-depth analysis of the X-ray\nspectral characteristics of this source. We found that the flux of 1ES 1210-646\nvaries by a factor of about 3 on a timescale of hundreds of seconds and by a\nfactor of at least 10 among observations acquired over a time span of several\nmonths. The X-ray spectrum of 1ES 1210-646 is described using a simple powerlaw\nshape or, in the case of INTEGRAL data, with a blackbody plus powerlaw model.\nSpectral variability is found in connection with different flux levels of the\nsource. A strong and transient iron emission line with an energy of about 6.7\nkeV and an equivalent width of about 1.6 keV is detected when the source is\nfound at an intermediate flux level. The line strength seems to be tied to the\norbital motion of the accreting object, as this feature is only apparent at the\nperiastron.

We first give explicit collective observables whose\ncorrelations reveal vacuum entanglement in the Klein-Gordon field.

It has\nresisted a both global and precise physical interpretation despite a consequent\nnumber of works, observational, theoretical or using numerical simulations. It\nappears that its precise properties depend on the population of galaxies in\nstudy. Instead of selecting a priori these populations, we propose to\nobjectively construct homologous populations from multivariate analyses. We\nhave undertaken multivariate cluster and cladistic analyses of a sample of 56\nlow-redshift galaxy clusters containing 699 early-type galaxies, using four\nparameters: effective radius, velocity dispersion, surface brightness averaged\nover effective radius, and Mg2 index. All our analyses are consistent with\nseven groups that define separate regions on the global fundamental plane, not\nacross its thickness. In fact, each group shows its own fundamental plane,\nwhich is more loosely defined for less diversified groups. We conclude that the\nglobal fundamental plane is not a bent surface, but made of a collection of\nseveral groups characterizing several fundamental planes with different\nthicknesses and orientations in the parameter space. Our diversification\nscenario probably indicates that the level of diversity is linked to the number\nand the nature of transforming events and that the fundamental plane is the\nresult of several transforming events. We also show that our classification,\nnot the fundamental planes, is universal within our redshift range (0.007 -\n0.053). We find that the three groups with the thinnest fundamental planes\npresumably formed through dissipative (wet) mergers. In one of them, this(ese)\nmerger(s) must have been quite ancient because of the relatively low\nmetallicity of its galaxies, Two of these groups have subsequently undergone\ndry mergers to increase their masses. In the k-space, the third one clearly\noccupies the region where bulges (of lenticular or spiral galaxies) lie and\nmight also have formed through minor mergers and accretions. The two least\ndiversified groups probably did not form by major mergers and must have been\nstrongly affected by interactions, some of the gas in the objects of one of\nthese groups having possibly been swept out. The interpretation, based on\nspecific assembly histories of galaxies of our seven groups, shows that they\nare truly homologous. They were obtained directly from several observables,\nthus independently of any a priori classification. The diversification scenario\nrelating these groups does not depend on models or numerical simulations, but\nis objectively provided by the cladistic analysis. Consequently, our\nclassification is more easily compared to models and numerical simulations, and\nour work can be readily repeated with additional observables. \n\n"}

Abstract: We report on the long-term monitoring campaign of the black hole candidate\nIGR J17091-3624 performed with INTEGRAL and Swift during the peculiar outburst\nstarted on January 2011. We have studied the two month spectral evolution of\nthe source in detail.

IGR J17091-3624\nshowed pseudo periodic flare-like events in the light curve, closely resembling\nthose observed from GRS 1915+105.

These constraints are\nremarkably consistent with inferences from theoretical calculations of pure\nneutron matter, and, furthermore, with astrophysical observations of neutron\nstars.

When the co-dimension\nis non-zero, the system acquires fluid-elastic properties and constitutes what\nis called a fluid brane. Applying an effective action approach, the most\ngeneral form of the free energy quadratic in the extrinsic curvature and\nextrinsic twist potential of stationary fluid brane configurations is\nconstructed to second order in a derivative expansion. This construction\ngeneralizes the Helfrich-Canham bending energy for fluid membranes studied in\ntheoretical biology to the case in which the fluid is rotating. It is found\nthat stationary fluid brane configurations are characterized by a set of 3\nelastic response coefficients, 3 hydrodynamic response coefficients and 1 spin\nresponse coefficient for co-dimension greater than one. Moreover, the elastic\ndegrees of freedom present in the system are coupled to the hydrodynamic\ndegrees of freedom. For co-dimension-1 surfaces we find a 8 independent\nparameter family of stationary fluid branes.

This\ncycle is probably representative of the first coronal cycles in the life of a\nsolar-like star, at the age when life started on Earth. \n\n"}

For a\nspecific interior spacetime setup, namely the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW\nmetric, we obtain two classes of solutions to the field equations where\ndepending on the relation between spin source parameters, $(i)$ the collapse\nprocedure culminates in a spacetime singularity or $(ii)$ it is replaced by a\nnon-singular bounce.

Nonetheless, the metallicity change is\nnegligible, and the mass--metallicity relations, which are mainly generated by\nsupernova feedback at the first star burst, are preserved. \n\n"}

In particular, defects could be spontaneously nucleated in our\nparent vacuum. We study the evolution of these defects as they collide with and\npropagate inside of our bubble.

Furthermore, they provide a quantum mechanical description in a\nmanifestly Lorentz invariant way using the concept of a multi-time wave\nfunction. In this paper, we place them into the context of the multi-time\nformalism of Dirac, Tomonaga and Schwinger for the first time.

The main requirement derived from the\ngeneral framework is the existence of conserved tensor currents with a positive\ncomponent which can play the role of a probability density.

In the first step, called the S-matrix bootstrap, the\nscattering matrix, is determined from its properties. In developing a defect\nform factor program the first step is the T-matrix bootstrap. Interacting\nintegrable defect theories are purely transmitting and topological. We analyze\nboth operators localized in the bulk and also on the defect. By finding their\nsolutions, the spectral representation of any correlator can be determined.\n  Next we consider the model on the lattice. The lattice approach allows to\nobtain both massive and massless excited TBA equations by studying the\ncontinuum scaling limit of the associated integrable lattice models. The most\nimportant input from the lattice approach is an insight into the analytic\nstructure of the excited state solutions of the TBA equations. Previously this\nstructure had to be guessed.

The\nspin-squared sector is an intricate one, as it requires the consideration of\nthe point particle action beyond minimal coupling, and mainly involves the\nspin-squared worldline couplings, which are quite complex, compared to the\nworldline couplings from the minimal coupling part of the action. This sector\nalso involves the linear in spin couplings, as we go up in the nonlinearity of\nthe interaction, and in the loop order. Hence, there is an excessive increase\nin the number of Feynman diagrams, of which more are higher loop ones. We\nprovide all the Feynman diagrams and their values. The beneficial\nnonrelativistic gravitational fields are employed in the computation. This\nspin-squared correction, which enters at the fourth post-Newtonian order for\nrapidly rotating compact objects, completes the conservative sector up to the\nfourth post-Newtonian accuracy. The robustness of the effective field theory\nfor gravitating spinning objects is shown here once again, as demonstrated in a\nrecent series of papers by the authors, which obtained all spin dependent\nsectors, required up to the fourth post-Newtonian accuracy. The effective field\ntheory of spinning objects allows to directly obtain the equations of motion,\nand the Hamiltonians, and these will be derived for the potential obtained here\nin a forthcoming paper. \n\n"}

In\nthis paper we assume that we are given a semi-commutative Galois extension of\nassociative unital algebra, then we show how one can construct the graded\nq-differential algebra and, when this algebra is constructed, we study its\nfirst order noncommutative differential calculus. We also study the subspaces\nof graded q-differential algebra of degree greater than one which we call the\nhigher order noncommutative differential calculus induced by a semi-commutative\nGalois extension of associative unital algebra. Finally we show that a reduced\nquantum plane can be viewed as a semi-commutative Galois extension of a\nfractional one-dimensional space and we apply the noncommutative differential\ncalculus developed in the previous sections to a reduced quantum plane. \n\n"}

Several phenomenological implications have been discussed in the\ncases in which (i) $X$ is the inflation, and (ii) $X$ is a field different from\nthe inflation, that experiences a temporary speed up during inflation.

Abstract: Successful phenomenological models of pulsar wind nebulae assume efficient\ndissipation of the Poynting flux of the magnetized electron-positron wind as\nwell as efficient acceleration of the pairs in the vicinity of the termination\nshock, but how this is realized is not yet well understood. The present paper\nsuggests that the corrugation of the termination shock, at the onset of\nnon-linearity, may lead towards the desired phenomenology. Non-linear\ncorrugation of the termination shock would convert a fraction of order unity of\nthe incoming ordered magnetic field into downstream turbulence, slowing down\nthe flow to sub-relativistic velocities. The dissipation of turbulence would\nfurther preheat the pair population on short length scales, close to\nequipartition with the magnetic field, thereby reducing the initial high\nmagnetization to values of order unity.

Here we write down the field equations which\nfollow from this action. We argue that the large mass limit yields Einstein\nequations, provided we assume wave function collapse and localisation for large\nmasses. The small mass limit yields the Dirac equation. We explain why the\nKerr-Newman black hole has the same gyromagnetic ratio as the Dirac electron,\nboth being twice the classical value. The small mass limit also provides\ncompelling reasons for introducing torsion, which is sourced by the spin\ndensity of the Dirac field. There is thus a symmetry between torsion and\ngravity: torsion couples to quantum objects through Planck's constant $\\hbar$\n(but not $G$) and is important in the microscopic limit. Whereas gravity\ncouples to classical matter, as usual, through Newton's gravitational constant\n$G$ (but not $\\hbar$), and is important in the macroscopic limit.

This principle captures all diffeomorphism constraints on\nsurface/interface actions and their associated spacetime stress tensor. The\ndifferent couplings to the geometric tensors appearing in the surface action\nare interpreted in terms of response coefficients within elasticity theory. An\nexample of a surface action with edges at the two-derivative level is studied,\nincluding both the parity-even and parity-odd sectors. Its conformally\ninvariant counterpart restricts the type of conformal anomalies that can appear\nin two-dimensional submanifolds with boundaries.

As the name\nsuggests, the motivation was via the OS reconstruction theorem which allows to\nreconstruct the OS data from an OS measure satisfying (a subset of) the OS\naxioms, in particular reflection positivity. The guiding principle was to map\nthe usual Wilsonian path integral renormalisation flow onto a flow of the\ncorresponding OS data.\n  We showed that this induced flow on the OS data has an unwanted feature which\ndisqualifies the associated coarse grained Hamiltonians from being the\nprojections of a continuum Hamiltonian onto vectors in the coarse grained\nHilbert space.

We aim to study, in a quantitative way,\nthe impact of granulation on colours. We use the CIFIST grid of CO5BOLD\nhydrodynamical models to compute emerging fluxes. These in turn are used to\ncompute theoretical colours in the UBVRI,2MASS,Hipparcos,Gaia and SDSS systems.\nEvery CO5BOLD model has a corresponding one dimensional (1D) plane-parallel LHD\nmodel computed for the same atmospheric parameters, which we used to define a\n\"3D correction\" that can be applied to colours computed from fluxes computed\nfrom any 1D model atmosphere code. The 3D corrections on colours are generally\nsmall, of the order of a few hundredths of a magnitude, yet they are far from\nnegligible. We find that ignoring granulation effects can lead to\nunderestimation of Teff by up to 200K and overestimation of gravity by up to\n0.5dex, when using colours as diagnostics. We have identified a major\nshortcoming in how scattering is treated in the current version of the CIFIST\ngrid, which could lead to offsets of the order 0.01mag, especially for colours\ninvolving blue and UV bands.We have investigated the Gaia and Hipparcos\nphotometric systems and found that the (G-H_p),(BP-RP) diagram is immune to the\neffects of granulation. In addition, we point to the potential of the RVS\nphotometry as a metallicity diagnostic. Our investigation shows that the\neffects of granulation should not be neglected if one wants to use colours as\ndiagnostics of the stellar parameters of F,G,K stars. A limitation is that\nscattering is treated as true absorption in our current computations, thus our\n3D corrections are likely an upper limit to the true effect. (Abridged) \n\n"}

The simulation was set to approximately reproduce the\nobserved MW and M31 masses, effective radii, separation, relative velocity and\ndisk inclinations. We used the publicly available adaptive-mesh-refinement code\nPhantom of RAMSES. In the simulation, matter was transferred from the MW to M31\nalong a tidal tail. The encounter induced formation of several structures\nresembling the peculiarities of the Local Group. Most notably: 1) A rotating\nplanar structure formed around M31 from the transferred material. It had a size\nsimilar to the observed satellite plane and was oriented edge-on to the\nsimulated MW, just as the real one. 2) The same structure also resembled the\ntidal features observed around M31 by its size and morphology. 3) A warp in the\nMW developed with an amplitude and orientation similar to that observed. 4) A\ncloud of particles formed around the simulated MW, with the extent of the\nactual MW satellite system.

We present a formulation of the evolution equation that governs this\ncascade, the Banfi-Marchesini-Smye equation, from both an effective field\ntheory point of view and a direct diagrammatic argument. The equation uses\nexact momentum conservation, and is applicable to both scattering with initial\nand final state hard partons. The direct diagrammatic formulation is organized\nby constructing a generating functional. This functional is also automatically\nrealized with soft wilson lines and collinear field operators coupled to\nexternal currents. The two approaches are directly connected by reverse\nengineering the Lehman-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction procedure to insert states\nwithin the soft and collinear matrix elements.

This article presents the modeling of the\nazimuthal-to-radial axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid of galactic disks from\nstellar dispersion maps using integral field spectroscopy data of the CALIFA\nsurvey. The measured azimuthal anisotropy is shown to be not strongly dependent\non the assumed vertical-to-radial dispersion ratio of the ellipsoid. The\nanisotropy distribution shows a large diversity in the orbital structure of\ndisk galaxies from tangential to radial stellar orbits. Globally, the orbits\nare isotropic in inner disk regions and become more radial as a function of\nradius, although this picture tends to depend on galaxy morphology and\nluminosity. The Milky Way orbital anisotropy profile measured from the Second\nGaia Data Release is consistent with those of CALIFA galaxies. A new\ncorrelation is evidenced, linking the absolute magnitude or stellar mass of the\ndisks to the azimuthal anisotropy. More luminous disks have more radial orbits\nand less luminous disks have isotropic and somewhat tangential orbits. This\ncorrelation is consistent with the picture in galaxy evolution in which orbits\nbecome more radial as the mass grows and is redistributed as a function of\ntime. With the help of circular velocity curves, it is also shown that the\nepicycle theory fails to reproduce the diversity of the azimuthal anisotropy of\nstellar random motions, as it predicts only nearly radial orbits in the\npresence of flat curves.

Parameter\nestimation from current CMB data continues, however, to be subject to several\ndegeneracies.

We extend earlier work on the\nmutual constraints that such analyses of CMB data and a reionization model may\nplace on each other to a more general parameter set, and to the case of data\nanticipated from the $MAP$ satellite. We focus in particular on a semi-analytic\nmodel of reionization by the first stars, although the methods here are easily\nextended to other reionization scenarios. A reionization model can provide\nuseful complementary information for cosmological parameter (CP) extraction\nfrom the CMB, particularly for the degeneracies between the optical depth and\neither of the amplitude and index of the primordial scalar power spectrum,\nwhich are still present in the most recent data.

The cumulative effect of these\n\"merger boosts\" will affect the observed X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) and\ntemperature functions (TFs) of clusters. Merger boosts may bias the values of\nsigma_8 and Omega_0 inferred from cluster XLFs and TFs if virial equilibrium is\nassumed. We use a semi-analytic technique to estimate the effect of merger\nboosts on the X-ray luminosity and temperature functions. The boosts from\nindividual mergers are derived from N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of\nmergers. The statistics of the merger histories of clusters are determined from\nextended Press-Schechter (PS) merger trees. We find that merger boosts can\nincrease the apparent number of hot, luminous clusters. For example, in a\nUniverse with Omega_0 = 0.3 and Omega_Lambda = 0.7 at a redshift of z=1, the\nnumber of clusters with temperatures T > 10 keV is increased by a factor of\n9.5, and the number of clusters with luminosities L_X > 5x10^44 h^-2 erg/s is\nincreased by a factor of 8.9.

Merger boosts cause sigma_8 to be overestimated by\nabout 20%. The matter density parameter Omega_0 may be underestimated by about\n20%, although this result is less clear. \n\n"}

We confirm\nthat S2s with hidden broad line regions (HBLRs) tend to have hotter\ncircumnuclear dust temperatures, show mid-IR spectra more characteristic of S1\ngalaxies, and are intrinsically more luminous than non-HBLR S2s. The level of\nobscuration and circumnuclear star formation, however, appear to be similar\nbetween HBLR and non-HBLR S2 galaxies, based on an examination of various\nobservational indicators. HBLR S2s, on average, share many similar large-scale,\npresumably isotropic, characteristics with Seyfert 1 galaxies (S1s), as would\nbe expected if the unified model is correct, while non-HBLR S2s generally do\nnot.

Assuming that the efficiency of producing UV\nphotons per baryon is constant, we derive a constraint of the form sigma_8\nOmega_0^0.5~0.33 in a flat, Lambda-dominated universe with h=0.72, n=0.99, and\nOmega_b h^2=0.024.

Based on this large,\nhomogeneous dataset, we present a sharp upward revision in the frequency of\nnucleation in early-type galaxies brighter than M_B ~ -15 (66 < f_n < 82%), and\nfind no evidence for nucleated dwarfs to be more concentrated to the center of\nVirgo than their non-nucleated counterparts.

We explore the effects of systematic uncertainties in the lens\nmodels on the estimates of H_0, and we discuss how the uncertainties can be\nreduced by future observations. We find that the lens cannot be fit by an\nisolated lens galaxy, but that it can be well fit by including a perturbation\nfrom the nearby group of galaxies.

The explicit expression for this term is given. It is shown that\nneither vortices nor topological solitons exist in the model. The case of\nsoftly broken supersymmetry is considered as well.

For this purpose\nwe use thermo field dynamics and the causal approach to quantum field theory\naccording to Epstein and Glaser, the latter being a rigorous method to avoid\nthe well-known ultraviolet divergencies of quantum field theory. It will be\nshown that the theory is infrared divergent if the usual scattering states are\nused. The same is true if we use more general mixed states. This is in\ncontradiction to the results established in the literature, and we will point\nout why these earlier approaches fail to describe the infrared behaviour\ncorrectly. We also calculate the thermal corrections to the electron magnetic\nmoment in the low temperature approximation k_B T << m_e. This is done by\ninvestigating the scattering of an electron on a C-number potential in third\norder in the limit of small momentum transfer p -> q. We reproduce one of the\ndifferent results reported up to now in literature. In the low temperature\napproximation infrared finiteness is recovered in a very straightforward way:\nIn contrast to the literature we do not have to introduce a thermal Dirac\nequation or thermal spinors. \n\n"}
