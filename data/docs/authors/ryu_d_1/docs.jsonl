Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance.

The\nresulting convection heats the intracluster plasma and regulates its\ntemperature and density profiles. By adjusting a single parameter in the model\n(the size of the cosmic-ray acceleration region), we are able to achieve a good\nmatch to the observed density and temperature profiles in a sample of eight\nclusters. Our results suggest that convection is an important process in\ncluster cores. An interesting feature of our solutions is that the cooling rate\nis more sharply peaked about the cluster center than is the convective heating\nrate. As a result, in several of the clusters in our sample, a compact cooling\nflow arises in the central region with a size R that is typically a few kpc.\nThe cooling flow matches onto a Bondi flow at smaller radii. The mass accretion\nrate in the Bondi flow is equal to, and controlled by, the rate at which mass\nflows in through the cooling flow. Our solutions suggest that the AGN regulates\nthe mass accretion rate in these clusters by controlling R: if the AGN power\nrises above the equilibrium level, R decreases, the mass accretion rate drops,\nand the AGN power drops back down to the equilibrium level. \n\n"}

In\ncomparison with equivalent low-relativistic jets which get surrounded by\ncocoons with vortical backflows filled by mainly toroidal field, the high speed\njets demonstrate only localized, strong toroidal field zones within the\nbackflow vortical structures. We find evidence for a more poloidal, straight\nfield layer, compressed between jet beam and backflows. This layer decreases\nthe destabilizing influence of the backflow on the jet beam. In all cases, the\njet beam contains rich cross-shock patterns, across which part of the kinetic\nenergy gets transferred. For the high speed reference jet considered here,\nsignificant jet deceleration only occurs beyond distances exceeding ${\\cal\nO}(100 R_j)$, as the axial flow can reaccelerate downstream to the internal\ncross-shocks. This reacceleration is magnetically aided, due to field\ncompression across the internal shocks which pinch the flow. \n\n"}

Discretization is based on cell-centered volume-averages for\nmass, momentum, and energy, and face-centered area-averages for the magnetic\nfield.

We review the significance for constraining sound speed models of\ndark energy using large neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys with the Square Kilometre\nArray (SKA). Our analysis considers the effect on the sound speed measurement\nthat arises from the covariance of $c_s$ with the dark energy density,\n$\\Omega_\\LLambda$, and a time-varying equation of state, $w(a)=w_0+(1-a)w_a$.\nWe find that the approximate degeneracy between dark energy parameters that\narises in power spectrum observations is lifted through redshift tomography of\nthe HI-galaxy angular power spectrum, resulting in sound speed constraints that\nare not severely degraded. The cross-correlation of the galaxy and the\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect spectra contributes approximately 10\npercent of the information that is needed to distinguish variations in the dark\nenergy parameters, and most of the discriminating signal comes from the galaxy\nauto-correlation spectrum.

'Core' Ellipticals\n  and 'Missing' Light Abstract: We investigate how 'extra' central light in the surface brightness profiles\nof cusp ellipticals relates to the profiles of ellipticals with cores. Cusp\nelliptical envelopes are formed by violent relaxation in mergers acting on\nstars in progenitor disks, while their centers are structured by dissipational\nstarbursts. Core ellipticals are formed by subsequent merging of (now gas-poor)\ncusp ellipticals, with the fossil starburst components combining to preserve a\ncompact component in the remnant (although the 'transition' is smoothed).\nComparing hydrodynamical simulations and observed profiles, we show how to\nobservationally isolate the relic starburst components in core ellipticals. We\ndemonstrate that these survive re-mergers and reliably trace the dissipation in\nthe initial gas-rich merger(s). The typical degree of dissipation is a strong\nfunction of stellar mass, tracing observed disk gas fractions. We find a\ncorrelation between dissipation and effective radius: systems with more\ndissipation are more compact. The survival of this component and scattering of\nstars into the envelope naturally explain high-Sersic index profiles\ncharacteristic of massive core ellipticals. This is also closely related to the\nkinematics and isophotal shapes: only systems with matched starburst components\nfrom their profile fits also reproduce the observed kinematics of boxy/core\nellipticals. We show that it is critical to adopt physically motivated profiles\nwhen attempting to quantify how much mass has been 'scoured' or scattered out\nof the inner regions by binary black holes. Estimates of scoured mass ignoring\nmulti-component structure can be strongly biased, potentially explaining\nobserved systems with large inferred core masses in apparent conflict with\ncore-scouring models. \n\n"}

Such an\nassumption is valid in the weak field, as verified by precision experiments and\nobservations, but it need not hold in the dynamical strong-field regime where\ntests are lacking. Fundamental bias can cause systematic errors in the\ndetection and parameter estimation of signals, which can lead to a\nmischaracterization of the universe through incorrect inferences about source\nevent rates and populations. We propose a remedy through the introduction of\nthe parameterized post-Einsteinian framework, which consists of the enhancement\nof waveform templates via the inclusion of post-Einsteinian parameters.

We find that closed-box models in which H_2 is not replenished by HI\nrequire improbably large increases in rho(H_2) and a decrease in the MGDR with\nlookback time that is inconsistent with observations. Allowing the H_2 used in\nstar formation to be replenished by HI does not alleviate the problem because\nobservations show that there is very little evolution of rho(HI) from z = 0 to\nz = 4. We show that to be consistent with observational constraints, star\nformation on cosmic timescales must be fueled by intergalactic ionized gas,\nwhich may come from either accretion of gas through cold (but ionized) flows or\nfrom ionized gas associated with accretion of dark matter halos. We constrain\nthe rate at which the extraglactic ionized gas must be converted into HI and\nultimately into H_2. The ionized gas inflow rate roughly traces the SFRD: about\n1 - 2 x 10^8 M_sun Gyr^-1 Mpc^-3 from z ~ 1 - 4, decreasing by about an order\nof magnitude from z=1 to z=0 with details depending largely on MGDR(t).

The\nSEDs are fit to Tau-models with a range of metallicities, dust laws, as well as\ndifferent stellar population synthesis codes. These models indicate masses\nequal to, or slightly smaller than our default masses. The maximum difference\nis 0.16 dex for each parameter considered, and only 0.18 dex for the most\nextreme combination of parameters. Two-component populations with a maximally\nold stellar population superposed with a young component provide reasonable\nfits to these SEDs using the models of Bruzual & Charlot (2003); however, using\nmodels with updated treatment of TP-AGB stars the fits are poorer.

Normal galaxies with low star-formation rates become radio-faint at high z,\nbecause Inverse Compton (IC) losses off the CMB cool CR electrons and positrons\nrapidly, suppressing their nonthermal radio emission. However, we find that\nthis effect occurs at higher redshifts than previously expected, because\nescape, bremsstrahlung, ionization, and starlight IC losses act to counter this\neffect and preserve the radio luminosity of galaxies. The radio dimming of\nstar-forming galaxies at high z is not just a simple competition between\nmagnetic field energy density and the CMB energy density; the CMB must also\ncompete with every other loss process. We predict relations for the critical\nredshift when radio emission is significantly suppressed compared to the z ~ 0\nFRC as a function of star-formation rate per unit area. Additionally, we\nprovide a quantitative explanation for the relative radio brightness of some\nhigh-z submillimeter galaxies.

Abstract: We study the emission observed at energies greater than 100 MeV of 11 Gamma\nRay Bursts (GRBs) detected by the Fermi/Large Area Telescope (LAT) until\nOctober 2009. The GeV emission has three main properties: (i) its duration is\noften longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by the Gamma\nBurst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi [this confirms earlier results from the\nEnergetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET)]; (ii) its spectrum is\nconsistent with F(v) propto v^(-1) and does not show strong spectral evolution;\n(iii) for the brightest bursts, the flux detected by the LAT decays as a power\nlaw with a typical slope: t^(-1.5). We argue that the observed >0.1 GeV flux\ncan be interpreted as afterglow emission shortly following the start of the\nprompt phase emission as seen at smaller frequencies. The decay slope is what\nexpected if the fireball emission is produced in the radiative regime, i.e. all\ndissipated energy is radiated away.

With the corrected formula, we find that the peaks in the\nlight curves predicted from the TPC model using the vacuum field are less\nsharp. The sharpness of the peaks in the OG model is less affected by this\nchange, but the range of magnetic inclination angles and viewing geometries\nresulting in double-peaked light curves is reduced.

The\n18-60 keV hard X-ray behaviour of the source is presented here for the first\ntime, it is characterized by a spectral shape ($\\Gamma$ about 2.5) similar to\nthat during outburst activity and the lowest measured luminosity level is about\n10^34 erg s^-1. The 0.5-10 keV luminosity state, measured by XMM-Newton during\nthe apastron passage, is about one order of magnitude lower and it is\nreasonably fitted by an absorbed black body model yielding parameters\nconsistent with previous measurements. In addition, we find evidence (about 3.5\nsigma significance) of an emission-like feature at about 3.3 keV in the\nquiescent 0.5-10 keV source spectrum. The absence of any known or found\nsystematic effects, which could artificially introduce the observed feature,\ngive us confidence about its non-instrumental nature. We show that its physical\nexplanation in terms of atomic emission line appears unlikely and conversely we\nattempt to ascribe it to an electron cyclotron emission line which would imply\na neutron star magnetic field of the order of about 3x10^11 G. Importantly,\nsuch direct estimation is in very good agreement with that independently\ninferred by us in the framework of accretion from a spherically symmetric\nstellar wind. If firmly confirmed by future longer X-ray observations, this\nwould be the first detection ever of a cyclotron feature in the X-ray spectrum\nof a SFXT, with important implications on theoretical models. \n\n"}

Such an additional scalar degree of freedom is called \"Galileon\".

Since it is observed in the\nsame source, the difference in QPO coherence and rms amplitude between the Z\nand atoll phase cannot be due to neutron-star mass, magnetic field, spin,\ninclination of the accretion disk, etc. If the QPO frequency is a function of\nthe radius in the accretion disk in which it is produced, our results suggest\nthat in XTE J1701-462 the coherence and rms amplitude are not uniquely related\nto this radius. Here we argue that this difference is instead due to a change\nin the properties of the accretion flow around the neutron star. Regardless of\nthe precise mechanism, our result shows that effects other than the geometry of\nspace time around the neutron star have a strong influence on the coherence and\nrms amplitude of the kHz QPOs, and therefore the coherence and rms amplitude of\nthe kHz QPOs cannot be simply used to deduce the existence of the innermost\nstable circular orbit around a neutron star. \n\n"}

The pressure of the relativistic\nelectron-positron gas is determined by solving the diffusion-loss equation,\nconsidering inverse Compton scattering, synchrotron radiation, Coulomb\ncollisions, bremsstrahlung, and ionization.

The FUV and HI maps\nshow a stunning spatial correlation out to almost 4 optical radii (r25),\nroughly the extent of our maps. This underscores that HI traces the gas\nreservoir for outer disk star formation and it implies that massive (at least\nlow level) star formation proceeds almost everywhere HI is observed. Whereas\nthe average FUV intensity decreases steadily with increasing radius before\nleveling off at ~1.7 r25, the decline in HI surface density is more subtle. Low\nHI columns (<2 M_solar/pc^2) contribute most of the mass in the outer disk,\nwhich is not the case within r25. The time for star formation to consume the\navailable HI, inferred from the ratio of HI to FUV intensity, rises with\nincreasing radius before leveling off at ~100 Gyr, i.e., many Hubble times,\nnear ~1.7 r25. Assuming the relatively short H2 depletion times observed in the\ninner parts of galaxies hold in outer disks, the conversion of HI into bound,\nmolecular clouds seems to limit star formation in outer galaxy disks.

By comparing the HeII and HI Lyman-alpha forests along a particular\nline of sight, one can trace fluctuations in the hardness of the radiation\nfield (which are driven by fluctuations in the HeII ionization rate). Because\nthis high-energy background is highly variable - thanks to the rarity of the\nbright quasars that dominate it and the relatively short attenuation lengths of\nthese photons - it is straightforward to associate features in the radiation\nfield with their source quasars. Here we quantify how finite lifetimes and\nbeamed emission geometries affect these expectations. Finite lifetimes induce a\ntime delay that displaces the observed radiation peak relative to the quasar.\nFor beamed emission, geometry dictates that sources invisible to the observer\ncan still create a peak in the radiation field. We show that both these models\nproduce substantial populations of \"bare\" peaks (without an associated quasar)\nfor reasonable parameter values (lifetimes ~10^6-10^8 yr and beaming angles <90\ndegrees).

The\ncritical influence of certain parameters on these distributions is used to\nconstrain their values. The single degenerate scenario alone is found to be\nunable in reproducing the morphological shape of the observational delay time\ndistribution, while use of the double degenerate one (or a combination of both)\ndoes result in fair agreement.

We conclude that the observed luminosity is the result of the\njoint probability distribution function of the SFR, cluster mass function, and\na universal IMF, consistent with parts of the IGIMF theory, but that a\ntruncation in the IMF in clusters is inconsistent with the observations. Future\nwork will examine stochastic star formation and its time dependence in detail\nto study whether random sampling can explain other observations that suggest a\nvarying IMF. \n\n"}

We find that although the fraction of galaxies\nhosting an AGN at fixed X-ray luminosity rises strongly with stellar mass, the\ndistribution of X-ray luminosities is independent of mass. Furthermore, we show\nthat the probability that a galaxy will host an AGN can be defined by a\nuniversal Eddington ratio distribution that is independent of the host galaxy\nstellar mass and has a power-law shape with slope -0.65.

From the cooling process we\nfound that a solid quark-cluster star, which has a stiffer equation of state\nthan that of conventional liquid quark star, has a heat capacity much smaller\nthan a neutron star. It can cool down quickly, which can naturally explain the\nnon-detection of a point source (neutron star or quark star) in X-ray band.

An important question is\nwhether the distribution of arrival directions for such UHECR nuclei can\nexhibit observable anisotropy or positional correlations with their\nastrophysical source objects despite the expected strong deflections by\nintervening magnetic fields. For this purpose, we have simulated the\npropagation of UHECR nuclei including models for both the extragalactic\nmagnetic field and the Galactic magnetic field. Assuming that only iron nuclei\nare injected steadily from sources with equal luminosity and spatially\ndistributed according to the observed large scale structure in the local\nUniverse, at the number of events published by the PAO so far, the arrival\ndistribution of UHECRs would be consistent with no auto-correlation at 95%\nconfidence if the mean number density of UHECR sources $n_s >~ 10^{-6}$\nMpc$^{-3}$, and consistent with no cross-correlation with sources within 95%\nerrors for $n_s >~ 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$.

Importance of the\n  conal profile components Abstract: This work is a continuation of two previous papers of a series, in which we\nexamined the pulse-width statistics of normal radio pulsars. In the first paper\nwe compiled the largest ever database of pulsars with interpulses in their mean\nprofiles. In the second one we confirmed the existence of the lower boundary in\nthe scatter plot of core component pulse-widths versus pulsar period W50 sim\n2.5 P^{-0.5}[deg], first discovered by Rankin using much smaller number of\ninterpulse cases. In this paper we show that the same lower boundary also\nexists for conal profile components. Rankin proposed a very simple method of\nestimation of pulsar inclination angle based on comparing the width W50 of its\ncore component with the period dependent value of the lower boundary. We claim\nthat this method can be extended to conal components as well. To explain an\nexistence of the lower boundary Rankin proposed that the core emission\noriginates at or near the polar cap surface. We demonstrated clearly that no\ncoherent pulsar radio emission can originate at altitudes lower than 10 stellar\nradii, irrespective of the actual mechanism of coherence. We argue that the\nlower boundary reflects the narrowest angular structures that can be\ndistinguished in the average pulsar beam. These structures represent the core\nand the conal components in mean pulsar profiles. The P^{-0.5} dependence\nfollows from the dipolar nature of magnetic field lines in the radio emission\nregion, while the numerical factor of about 2.5 deg reflects the curvature\nradius of a non-dipolar surface magnetic field in the partially screened gap\nabove the polar cap, where dense electron-positron plasma is created.

We use a global\nclimate model to simulate the thermal phase variations of Earth-analogs and\ntest whether these data could distinguish between planets with different heat\nstorage and heat transport characteristics. In particular, we consider a\ntemperate climate with polar ice caps (like modern Earth), and a snowball state\nwhere the oceans are globally covered in ice. We first quantitatively study the\nperiodic radiative forcing from, and climatic response to, rotation, obliquity,\nand eccentricity. Orbital eccentricity and seasonal changes in albedo cause\nvariations in the global-mean absorbed flux. The responses of the two climates\nto these global seasons indicate that the temperate planet has 3 times the bulk\nheat capacity of the snowball planet due to the presence of liquid water\noceans. The temperate obliquity seasons are weaker than one would expect based\non thermal inertia alone; this is due to cross-equatorial oceanic and\natmospheric energy transport. Thermal inertia and cross-equatorial heat\ntransport have qualitatively different effects on obliquity seasons, insofar as\nheat transport tends to reduce seasonal amplitude without inducing a phase lag.\nFor an Earth-like planet, however, this effect is masked by the mixing of\nsignals from low thermal inertia regions (sea ice and land) with that from high\nthermal inertia regions (oceans), which also produces a damped response with\nsmall phase lag. We then simulate thermal lightcurves as they would appear to a\nhigh-contrast imaging mission (TPF-I/Darwin) and consider the inverse problem\nof estimating thermal inertia based solely on time-resolved photometry.\n[Abridged] \n\n"}

We compared\nour measurements with SWCX models. The heliospheric SWCX intensity is expected\nto vary with ecliptic latitude and solar cycle. We found that the observed\noxygen intensities generally decrease from solar maximum to solar minimum, both\nat high ecliptic latitudes (as expected) and at low ecliptic latitudes (not as\nexpected). The geocoronal SWCX intensity is expected to depend on the solar\nwind proton flux and on the sightline's path through the magnetosheath. The\nintensity variations seen in directions that have been observed multiple times\nare in poor agreement with the predictions of a geocoronal SWCX model. The\noxygen lines account for ~40-50% of the 3/4 keV X-ray background that is not\ndue to unresolved AGN, in good agreement with a previous measurement.

The\nmodel assumes that the Faraday Rotators, namely the QSO's host galaxy and the\nintervening MgII host galaxies along the line of sight, contain partially\ninhomogeneous RM screens. We find that this leads to an increasing\ndepolarization towards longer wavelengths and to wavelength dependent RM\nvalues. In particular, due to cosmological redshift, observations at fixed\nwavelength of sources at different redshift are affected differently by\ndepolarization and are sensitive to different Faraday active components. For\nexample, at 21 cm the polarized signal is averaged out by inhomogeneous Faraday\nscreens and the measured RM mostly reflects the Milky Way contributions for low\nredshift QSOs, while polarization is relatively unaffected for high redshift\nQSOs.

However, according to recent Suzaku X-ray\nmeasurements, gas mass fractions, f_gas, appear to be considerably larger than\nthe cosmic mean at the virial radius, R_200, questioning the accuracy of the\ncosmological parameter estimations. Here, we use a large suite of cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations to study measurement biases of f_gas. We employ\ndifferent variants of simulated physics, including radiative gas physics, star\nformation, and thermal feedback by active galactic nuclei. Computing the mass\nprofiles in 48 angular cones, whose footprints partition the sphere, we find\nanisotropic gas and total mass distributions that imply an angular variance of\nf_gas at the level of 30%. This anisotropic distribution originates from the\nrecent formation epoch of clusters and from the strong internal\nbaryon-to-dark-matter density bias. In the most extreme cones, f_gas can be\nbiased high by a factor of two at R_200 in massive clusters, thereby providing\na potential explanation for high f_gas measurements by Suzaku. While projection\nlowers this factor, there are other measurement biases that may (partially)\ncompensate. We find that at R_200, f_gas is biased high by 20% when assuming\nhydrostatic equilibrium masses, i.e., neglecting the kinetic pressure, and by\nanother ~10-20% due to the presence of density clumping. At larger radii, both\nmeasurement biases increase dramatically. While the cluster sample variance of\nthe true f_gas decreases to a level of 5% at R_200, the sample variance that\nincludes both measurement biases remains fairly constant at the level of\n10-20%.

The\nmodel contains, in addition to the standard model (SM) Higgs boson, an inert\nSU(2)_L doublet scalar eta and two inert singlet scalars phi and chi. The\nlepton number is softly broken by a dimension-two operator, and the tree-level\nDirac mass is forbidden by Z_2 x Z_2' (or D_{2N}), which predicts the existence\nof two or three dark matter particles. The scalar sector is minimal; none of\nthe scalar fields can be suppressed for the radiative seesaw mechanism to work.\nThere are by-products: The SM Higgs boson decay into two gamma's is slightly\nenhanced by eta^+ (the charged component of eta) circulating in one-loop\ndiagrams for h to gamma gamma. The 135 GeV gamma-ray line observed at the Fermi\nLAT can be also explained by the annihilation of chi dark matter.

By solving the Jeans equations we\nconstruct realistic axisymmetric three-component galaxy models (stars, dark\nmatter halo, central black hole) with different degrees of flattening and\nrotational support.

For these models we compute T_* (the stellar heating contribution to\nthe gas injection temperature) and T_gm (the temperature equivalent of the\nenergy required for the gas escape). In particular, different degrees of\nthermalisation of the ordered rotational field of the galaxy are considered. We\nfind that T_* and T_gm can vary only mildly due to a pure change of shape.\nGalaxy rotation instead, when not thermalised, can lead to a large decrease of\nT_*; this effect can be larger in flatter galaxies that can be more\nrotationally supported. Recent temperature measurements T_x, obtained with\nChandra, are larger than, but close to, the T_* values of the models, and show\na possible trend for a lower T_x in flatter and more rotationally supported\ngalaxies; this trend can be explained by the lack of thermalisation of the\nwhole stellar kinetic energy.

If we fix the\nlocal circular velocity the latter profile yields a significantly higher mass\nthan the un-contracted halo, but if we instead use the statistics on halo\nconcentration parameters in large cosmological simulations as a constraint we\nfind very similar masses for both models. Our best estimate for $M_{340}$, the\nmass interior to $R_{340}$ (dark matter and baryons), is $1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\n\\times 10^{12}$ M$_\\odot$ (corresponding to $M_{200} = 1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4} \\times\n10^{12}$ M$_\\odot$).

We\npropose to use the proton linac of the European Spallation Source currently\nunder construction in Lund, Sweden to deliver, in parallel with the spallation\nneutron production, a very intense, cost effective and high performance\nneutrino beam. The baseline program for the European Spallation Source linac is\nthat it will be fully operational at 5 MW average power by 2022, producing 2\nGeV 2.86 ms long proton pulses at a rate of 14 Hz. Our proposal is to upgrade\nthe linac to 10 MW average power and 28 Hz, producing 14 pulses/s for neutron\nproduction and 14 pulses/s for neutrino production. Furthermore, because of the\nhigh current required in the pulsed neutrino horn, the length of the pulses\nused for neutrino production needs to be compressed to a few $\\mu$s with the\naid of an accumulator ring.

Generally, a static binary lens is considered to fit the observed\nlight curve and, when the orbital motion is taken into account, an\noversimplified model is usually employed. In this paper, we treat the\nbinary-lens motion in a realistic way and focus on simulated events that are\nfitted well by a Paczy\\'nski curve. We show that an accurate timing analysis of\nthe residuals (calculated with respect to the best-fitting Paczy\\'nski model)\nis usually sufficient to infer the orbital period of the binary lens.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod to probe sub-parsec BBHs through microlensing of lensed QSOs. If a QSO\nhosts a sub-parsec BBH in its center, it is expected that the BBH is surrounded\nby a circum-binary disk, each component of the BBH is surrounded by a small\naccretion disk, and a gap is opened by the secondary component in between the\ncircum-binary disk and the two small disks. Assuming such a BBH structure, we\ngenerate mock microlensing light curves for some QSO systems that host BBHs\nwith typical physical parameters. We show that microlensing light curves of a\nBBH QSO system at the infrared-optical-UV bands can be significantly different\nfrom those of corresponding QSO system with a single massive black hole (MBH),\nmainly because of the existence of the gap and the rotation of the BBH (and its\nassociated small disks) around the center of mass.

The model yields good fits of the UV and Lyman-alpha LFs at\nz>~2. The weak evolution of both LFs between z=2 and z=6 is explained as the\ncombined effect of the negative evolution of the halo mass function, of the\nincrease with redshift of the star formation efficiency, and of dust\nextinction. The slope of the faint end of the UV LF is found to steepen with\nincreasing redshift, implying that low luminosity galaxies increasingly\ndominate the contribution to the UV background at higher and higher redshifts.\nThe observed range of UV luminosities at high-z implies a minimum halo mass\ncapable of hosting active star formation M_crit <~ 10^9.8 M_odot, consistent\nwith the constraints from hydrodynamical simulations. From fits of Lyman-alpha\nLFs plus data on the luminosity dependence of extinction and from the measured\nratios of non-ionizing UV to Lyman-continuum flux density for samples of z=~3\nLyman break galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitters, we derive a simple relationship\nbetween the escape fraction of ionizing photons and the star formation rate,\nimpling larger escape fraction for less massive galaxies.

GRS\n1915+105 is at about the same distance as some HII regions and water masers\nassociated with high-mass star formation in the Sagittarius spiral arm of the\nGalaxy. The absolute proper motion of GRS 1915+105 is -3.19 +/- 0.03 mas/y and\n-6.24 +/- 0.05 mas/y toward the east and north, respectively, which corresponds\nto a modest peculiar speed of 22 +/-24 km/s at the parallax distance,\nsuggesting that the binary did not receive a large velocity kick when the black\nhole formed.

The templates for the first time cover FO Cepheids\nand the FU short-period Cepheids (P<5 days). Moreover, the zero-point phase is\nanchored to the phase of the mean magnitude along the rising branch. The new\napproach has several advantages in sampling the light curve of bump Cepheids\nwhen compared with the phase of maximum light.

In particular, the ability to relate experimental\nobservables to neutrino energy in previous experiments has relied solely on\ntheoretical models of neutrino-nucleus interactions, which currently suffer\nfrom very large theoretical uncertainties.\n  By observing charged current $\\nu_\\mu$ interactions over a continuous range\nof off-axis angles from 1 to 4 degrees, the nuPRISM water Cherenkov detector\ncan provide a direct measurement of the far detector lepton kinematics for any\ngiven set of oscillation parameters, which largely removes neutrino interaction\nmodeling uncertainties from T2K oscillation measurements. This naturally\nprovides a direct constraint on the relationship between lepton kinematics and\nneutrino energy. In addition, nuPRISM is a sensitive probe of sterile neutrino\noscillations with multiple energy spectra, which provides unique constraints on\npossible background-related explanations of the MiniBooNE anomaly.

We find 19 850um\nbright X-ray AGN in a high-sensitivity region covering 0.89 sq-deg with flux\ndensities of S850=4-10 mJy. The 19 AGN span the full range in redshift and hard\nX-ray luminosity covered by the sample - 0.7<z<3.5 and 43.2<log10(LX) <45.

For Type 1\nAGN, there is no significant correlation between the stacked 850um flux and\nhard X-ray luminosity.

When averaging over all X-ray\nluminosities, no significant differences are found in the stacked submm fluxes\nof Type 1 and Type 2 AGN as well as AGN separated on the basis of X-ray\nhardness ratios and optical-to-infrared colours. However, at log10(LX) >44.4,\ndependences in average submm flux on the optical-to-infrared colours become\nmore pronounced. We argue that these high luminosity AGN represent a transition\nfrom a secular to a merger-driven evolutionary phase where the star formation\nrates and accretion luminosities are more tightly coupled.

Upon its destruction, a fraction of this energy is extracted\nand injected into the stellar debris, half of which becomes unbound from the\nblack hole, with the fastest material moving at $\\sim 0.03 c$. In this paper,\nwe present a formalism for determining the fate of these unbound debris streams\n(UDSs) as they depart from the black hole and interact with the surrounding\ngas. As the density and velocity varies along the length of a UDS, we find that\nhydrodynamical drag quickly shapes UDSs into loop-like structures, with the\ndensest portions of the streams leading portions of lower density. As UDSs\ntravel outwards, their drag against the ISM increases quadratically with\ndistance, which causes UDSs to deposit their momentum and energy into the\nambient medium before the surrounding shocked ISM has a chance to cool.

One way to\nmeet the demand for rapid GW parameter estimation is to trade off accuracy for\nspeed, using waveform models with simplified treatment of the compact objects'\nspin. We report on the systematic errors in GW parameter estimation suffered\nwhen using different spin approximations to recover generic signals. Component\nmass measurements can be biased by $>5\\sigma$ using simple-precession waveforms\nand in excess of $20\\sigma$ when non-spinning templates are employed. This\nsuggests that electromagnetic observing campaigns should not take a strict\napproach to selecting which LIGO/Virgo candidates warrant follow-up\nobservations based on low-latency mass estimates.

Abstract: Recently, Keane et al. reported the discovery of a fading radio transient\nfollowing FRB 150418, and interpreted it as the afterglow of the FRB. Williams\n\\& Berger, on the other hand, suggested that the radio transient is analogous\nto a group of variable radio sources, so that it could be a coincident AGN\nflare in the observational beam of the FRB. A new observation with VLA showed a\nre-brightening, which is consistent with the AGN picture. Here, using the radio\nsurvey data of Ofek et al., we statistically examine the chance coincidence\nprobability to produce an event like the FRB 150418 transient. We find that the\nprobabilities to produce a variable radio transient with at least the same\nvariability amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio as the FRB 150415 transient,\nwithout and with the VLA point, are $P_1 \\sim 6 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $P_1 \\sim 2\n\\times 10^{-3}$, respectively. In addition, the chance probability to have a\nfading transient detected following a random time (FRB time) is less than $P_2\n\\sim 10^{-2.9\\pm 1.3}$.

The\nnon-thermal WIMP becomes important when the reheating temperature is well below\nthe freeze-out temperature. Usually, two limiting cases have been considered.\nOne is that the produced high energetic dark matter particles are quickly\nthermalized due to the elastic scattering with background radiations. The\ncorresponding relic abundance is determined by the thermally averaged\nannihilation cross-section at the reheating temperature. The other one is that\nthe initial abundance is too small for the dark matter to annihilate so that\nthe final relic is determined by the initial amount itself. We study the\nregions between these two limits, and show that the relic density depends not\nonly on the annihilation rate, but also on the elastic scattering rate.\nEspecially, the relic abundance of the p-wave annihilating dark matter\ncrucially relies on the elastic scattering rate because the annihilation\ncross-section is sensitive to the dark matter velocity. We categorize the\nparameter space into several regions where each region has distinctive\nmechanism for determining the relic abundance of the dark matter at the present\nUniverse.

Abstract: We consider some general implications of bright gamma-ray counterparts to\nfast radio bursts (FRBs). We show that even if these manifest in only a\nfraction of FRBs, gamma-ray detections with current satellites (including\nSwift) can provide stringent constraints on cosmological FRB models. If the\nenergy is drawn from the magnetic energy of a compact object such as a\nmagnetized neutron star, the sources should be nearby and be very rare. If the\nintergalactic medium is responsible for the observed dispersion measure, the\nrequired gamma-ray energy is comparable to that of the early afterglow or\nextended emission of short gamma-ray bursts. While this can be reconciled with\nthe rotation energy of compact objects, as expected in many merger scenarios,\nthe prompt outflow that yields the gamma-rays is too dense for radio waves to\nescape. Highly relativistic winds launched in a precursor phase, and forming a\nwind bubble, may avoid the scattering and absorption limits and could yield FRB\nemission. Largely independent of source models, we show that detectable radio\nafterglow emission from gamma-ray bright FRBs can reasonably be anticipated.\nGravitational wave searches can also be expected to provide useful tests. \n\n"}

Since the squeezed-limit bispectrum encodes the impact of a\nlarge-scale fluctuation on the small-scale power spectrum, it can be understood\nas how the small-scale power spectrum \"responds\" to the large-scale\nfluctuation.

In this study we\npropose to go one step further and directly detect intergalactic medium\nfilaments through their emission in the HI 21cm line.

Given the expected signal of these\nfilaments our study shows that HI emission from large filaments can be observed\nby current and next generation radio telescopes.

Background sky and model\n  fitting effects Abstract: A number of recent estimates of the total luminosities of galaxies in the\nSDSS are significantly larger than those reported by the SDSS pipeline. This is\nbecause of a combination of three effects: one is simply a matter of defining\nthe scale out to which one integrates the fit when defining the total\nluminosity, and amounts on average to < 0.1 mags even for the most luminous\ngalaxies. The other two are less trivial and tend to be larger; they are due to\ndifferences in how the background sky is estimated and what model is fit to the\nsurface brightness profile. We show that PyMorph sky estimates are fainter than\nthose of the SDSS DR7 or DR9 pipelines, but are in excellent agreement with the\nestimates of Blanton et al. (2011). Using the SDSS sky biases luminosities by\nmore than a few tenths of a magnitude for objects with half-light radii > 7\narcseconds. In the SDSS main galaxy sample these are typically luminous\ngalaxies, so they are not necessarily nearby. This bias becomes worse when\nallowing the model more freedom to fit the surface brightness profile. When\nPyMorph sky values are used, then two component Sersic-Exponential fits to\nE+S0s return more light than single component deVaucouleurs fits (up to ~0.2\nmag), but less light than single Sersic fits (0.1 mag). Finally, we show that\nPyMorph fits of Meert et al.

In this paper, we investigate the\npossible bounds which could be placed on the Brans-Dicke gravity using GW\ndetection from inspiralling compact binaries with the proposed Einstein\nTelescope, a third-generation GW detector. We first calculate in details the\nwaveforms of gravitational radiation in the lowest post-Newtonian\napproximation, including the tensor and scalar fields, which can be divided\ninto the three polarization modes, i.e. \"plus mode\", \"cross mode\" and\n\"breathing mode\".

Furthermore, chromospheric emission in young active stars impacts the\nmeasurement of mass accretion rates, a key quantity to study disk evolution.\nHere we derive stellar properties of low-mass pre-main sequence stars without\ndisks, which represent ideal photospheric templates for studies of young stars.\nWe also use these spectra to constrain the impact of chromospheric emission on\nthe measurements of mass accretion rates. The spectra in reduced,\nflux-calibrated, and corrected for telluric absorption form are made available\nto the community. We derive the spectral type for our targets by analyzing the\nphotospheric molecular features present in their VLT/X-Shooter spectra by means\nof spectral indices and comparison of the relative strength of photospheric\nabsorption features. We also measure effective temperature, gravity, projected\nrotational velocity, and radial velocity from our spectra by fitting them with\nsynthetic spectra with the ROTFIT tool.

This process is\noften assumed to be governed by the dipolar component of the magnetic field.\nHowever, observed magnetic fields can host strong quadrupolar and/or octupolar\ncomponents, which may influence the resulting spin-down torque on the star. In\nPaper I, we used the MHD code PLUTO to compute steady state solutions for\nstellar winds containing a mixture of dipole and quadrupole geometries. We\nshowed the combined winds to be more complex than a simple sum of winds with\nthese individual components. This work follows the same method as Paper I,\nincluding the octupole geometry which increases the field complexity but also,\nmore fundamentally, looks for the first time at combining the same symmetry\nfamily of fields, with the field polarity of the dipole and octupole geometries\nreversing over the equator (unlike the symmetric quadrupole).

By means of high-resolution two-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we study the three feedback effects (the stellar wind heating, SNe\nfeedback, and AGN feedback) in suppressing star formation activities on the\nevolution of early-type galaxies with different stellar masses. AGN feedback\nmodels are updated based on \\citet{Yuan2018}. The gas sources comes exclusively\nfrom the mass losses of dying low-mass stars for most of our models. We find\nthat SNe feedback can keep star formation at a significantly low level for low\nmass elliptical galaxies for a cosmological evolution time. For the high mass\ngalaxies, AGN feedback can efficiently offset the radiative cooling and thus\nregulate the star formation activities. Such a suppression of star formation is\nextremely efficient in the inner region of the galaxies. AGB heating cannot\naccount for this suppression for low and high mass galaxies.

Unresolved and unrecognized binaries give rise to systematic errors\nin planet occurrence rates, including misclassified planets and mistakes in\ncompleteness corrections. The individual errors can have different signs,\nmaking it difficult to anticipate the net effect on inferred occurrence rates.\nHere we use simplified models of signal-to-noise limited transit surveys to try\nand clarify the situation. We derive a formula for the apparent occurrence rate\ndensity measured by an observer who falsely assumes all stars are single. The\nformula depends on the binary fraction; the mass function of the secondary\nstars; and the true occurrence of planets around primaries, secondaries, and\nsingle stars. It also takes into account the Malmquist bias by which binaries\nare over-represented in flux-limited samples. Application of the formula to an\nidealized Kepler-like survey shows that for planets larger than 2 $R_\\oplus$,\nthe net systematic error is of order 5%. In particular, unrecognized binaries\nare unlikely to be the reason for the apparent discrepancies between hot\nJupiter occurrence rates measured in different surveys. For smaller planets the\nerrors are potentially larger: the occurrence of Earth-sized planets could be\noverestimated by as much as 50%. We also show that whenever high-resolution\nimaging reveals a transit host star to be a binary, the planet is usually more\nlikely to orbit the primary star than the secondary star. \n\n"}

Spectroscopy of\ngamma-ray burst afterglows can be used to determine the neutral hydrogen\ncolumn-density in their host galaxies and hence the opacity to extreme\nultra-violet radiation along the lines-of-sight to the bursts. Thus, making the\nreasonable assumption that long-duration GRB locations are representative of\nthe sites of massive stars that dominate EUV production, one can calculate an\naverage escape fraction of ionizing radiation in a way that is independent of\ngalaxy size, luminosity or underlying spectrum. Here we present a sample of NH\nmeasures for 138 GRBs in the range 1.6<z<6.7 and use it to establish an average\nescape fraction at the Lyman limit of <fesc>~0.005, with a 98% confidence upper\nlimit of ~0.015. This analysis suggests that stars provide a small contribution\nto the ionizing radiation budget of the IGM at z<5, where the bulk of the\nbursts lie.

It is caused by an asymmetry between the number densities of left- and\nright-handed fermions, which can be maintained at high energies when the\nchirality flipping rate can be neglected, for example in the early Universe.\nThe inclusion of the CME in the Maxwell equations leads to a modified set of\nMHD equations. We discuss how the CME is implemented in the PENCIL CODE. The\nCME plays a key role in the evolution of magnetic fields since it results in a\ndynamo effect associated with an additional term in the induction equation.\nThis term is formally similar to the $\\alpha$ effect in classical mean-field\nMHD. However, the chiral dynamo can operate without turbulence and is\nassociated with small spatial scales that can be, in the case of the early\nUniverse, orders of magnitude below the Hubble radius. A chiral $\\alpha_\\mu$\neffect has also been identified in mean-field theory. It occurs in the presence\nof turbulence but is not related to kinetic helicity. Depending on the plasma\nparameters, chiral dynamo instabilities can amplify magnetic fields over many\norders of magnitude. These instabilities can affect the propagation of MHD\nwaves, which is demonstrated by our DNS. We also study the coupling between the\nevolution of the chiral chemical potential and the ordinary chemical potential,\nwhich is proportional to the sum of the number densities of left- and\nright-handed fermions. An important consequence of this coupling is the\nemergence of chiral magnetic waves (CMWs). We confirm numerically that linear\nCMWs and MHD waves are not interacting.

Our\nmodel reproduces well the observed light curve with a slight perturbation of a\nsinusoidal feature and predicts that a slightly larger period than previously\nreported, of about 1899 days, could arise due to a cold spot in the disk of\n{\\bf more massive} component of a close, unequal-mass\n($\\frac{\\mathrm{m}_{1}}{\\mathrm{m}_{2}}=0.1$) black hole binary system.

To understand their observational signatures,\nwe simulate these white dwarf (WD) postgenitors from shortly after explosion\nuntil they move back down the WD cooling track, and we consider several\npossible WD masses and explosion energies. To predict the peculiar surface\nabundances of the WD postgenitors, our models take into account gravitational\nsettling and radiative levitation. We find that radiative levitation is\nsignificant at temperatures above a mass-dependent critical temperature,\ntypically in the range Teff ~ 50-100 * 10^3 K, significantly increasing surface\nabundances of iron-group elements. Due to enhanced iron group opacity compared\nto normal WDs, the postgenitor peak luminosity and cooling timescale depend\nsensitively on mass, with more massive WDs becoming brighter but cooling much\nfaster. We discuss our results in light of recently discovered hypervelocity\nwhite dwarfs with peculiar surface compositions, finding that our low-mass\npostgenitor models match many of their observational characteristics.

We investigate here the origin of this sequence for the\nsame sample. We show that total attenuations anti-correlate with the starburst\nsizes in radio (3 GHz) with a significance larger than 5sigma and a scatter of\n0.26 dex. More obscured and compact starbursts also show enhanced N2\n(=[NII]/Halpha) ratios and larger line velocity widths that we attribute to an\nincreasing shock contribution toward later merger phases, driven by deeper\ngravitational potential wells at the coalescence. Additionally, the attenuation\nis also linked to the equivalent width (EW) of hydrogen recombination lines,\nwhich is sensitive to the luminosity weighted age of the relatively unobscured\nstellar populations. Overall, the correlations among A(V), radio size, line\nwidth, N2 and EW of Balmer/Paschen lines converge towards suggesting an\nevolutionary sequence of merger stages: all of these quantities are likely to\nbe good time-tracers of the merger phenomenon, and their large spanned range\nappears to be characteristic of the different merger phases.

We show that isotropic mass distributions with power-law\nphase-space density profiles form a one-parameter family of structures\ncontrolled by $\\kappa$, the ratio of the velocity dispersion to the peak\ncircular velocity. For $\\kappa=\\alpha=1.875$ one recovers the power-law\nsolution $\\rho \\propto r^{2\\alpha-6}$. For $\\kappa$ larger than some critical\nvalue, $\\kappa_{cr}$, solutions become non-physical, leading to negative\ndensities near the center. The critical solution, $\\kappa =\\kappa_{cr}$, has\nthe narrowest phase-space density distribution compatible with the power-law\nphase-space density stratification constraint. Over three decades in radius the\ncritical solution is indistinguishable from an NFW profile. Our results thus\nsuggest that the NFW profile is the result of a hierarchical assembly process\nthat preserves the phase-space stratification of Bertschinger's infall model\nbut which ``mixes'' the system maximally, perhaps as a result of repeated\nmerging. \n\n"}

Subsequent low-z redshift surveys have been up to an order of\nmagnitude larger, and ongoing surveys will yield a similar improvement over the\ngeneration preceding them. Full sky redshift surveys have a special role to\nplay as predictors of cosmological flows, and deep pencil beam surveys have\nprovided fundamental constraints on the evolution of properties of galaxies.\nWith the 2DF redshift survey and the SDSS survey, our knowledge of the\nstatistical clustering of low-redshift galaxies will achieve unprecedented\nprecision.

We\nfind that the disruption of satellite galaxies in orbits roughly coplanar with\nthe disk leads naturally to the formation of ring-like stellar structures\nsimilar to that recently discovered in the outer disk of the Milky Way. Two\ninterpretations appear plausible in this context. One is that the ring is a\ntransitory, localized radial density enhancement reflecting the apocenter of\nparticles stripped from a satellite during a recent pericentric passage (a\n``tidal arc'' reminiscent of the tidal arms seen in disk galaxy mergers). In\nthe second scenario, the ring is analogous to the ``shells'' found around some\nelliptical galaxies, and would result from a minor merger that took place\nseveral Gyr ago. The two interpretations differ in several ways. Tidal arcs are\nexpected to span a limited longitude range; may carry a substantial fraction of\nthe original mass of the satellite; should exhibit a significant velocity\ngradient with Galactic longitude; and are in all likelihood asymmetric above\nand below the plane of the disk. Shells, on the other hand, may comprise at\nmost a small fraction of the original mass of the satellite and, due to their\nmore relaxed state, ought to be symmetric above and below the plane, with no\ndiscernible velocity gradients across the structure. If confirmed as a tidal\nfeature, the ring discovered by SDSS in the outer Galactic disk would\nstrengthen the view--supported by numerical simulations--that minor mergers\nhave played a significant role building up not only the stellar halo, but also\nthe disk components of the Galaxy. \n\n"}

Simulations\nfail to predict the existence of significant numbers of detectable void clouds.\nThey incorrectly predict the characteristics of non-void clouds.

Abstract: Recent observations of z~6 quasars and the cosmic microwave background imply\na complex history to cosmic reionization. Such a history requires some form of\nfeedback to extend reionization over a long time interval, but the nature of\nthe feedback and how rapidly it operates remain highly uncertain. Here we focus\non one aspect of this complexity: which physical processes can cause the global\nionized fraction to evolve non-monotonically with cosmic time? We consider a\nrange of mechanisms and conclude that double reionization is much less likely\nthan a long, but still monotonic, ionization history. We first examine how\ngalactic winds affect the transition from metal-free to normal star formation.\nBecause the transition is actually spatially inhomogeneous and temporally\nextended, this mechanism cannot be responsible for double reionization given\nplausible parameters for the winds. We next consider photoheating, which causes\nthe cosmological Jeans mass to increase in ionized regions and hence suppresses\ngalaxy formation there. In this case, double reionization requires that small\nhalos form stars efficiently, that the suppression from photoheating is strong\nrelative to current expectations, and that ionizing photons are preferentially\nproduced outside of previously ionized regions. Finally, we consider H_2\nphotodissociation, in which the buildup of a soft ultraviolet background\nsuppresses star formation in small halos. This can in principle cause the\nionized fraction to temporarily decrease, but only during the earliest stages\nof reionization. Finally, we briefly consider the effects of some of these\nfeedback mechanisms on the topology of reionization. \n\n"}

Expanded perturbatively in the amplitude of the input (i.e.\ntheoretical, continuum) power spectrum, we obtain at linear order the input\npower spectrum, plus two terms which arise from discreteness and contribute at\nlarge wavenumbers.

The gravity induced \"R-boost\" mechanism is indeed responsible for an\nearly, enhanced scalar field dynamics, by virtue of which the residual imprint\nof a wide set of initial field values is cancelled out. The initial conditions\nproblem is particularly relevant, as the most recent observations indicate that\nthe dark energy equation of state approaches, at the present time, the\ncosmological constant value, wDE = -1; if confirmed, such observational\nevidence would cancel the advantage of a standard, minimally coupled scalar\nfield as a Dark Energy candidate instead of the cosmological constant, because\nof the huge fine tuning it would require.

In this second paper, we describe two\ndifferent approaches to computing the gravitational field of a two-dimensional\nflow with pseudo-spectral methods. For situations in which the density profile\nis independent of the third coordinate (i.e., an infinite cylinder), we use a\nstandard Poisson solver in spectral space. On the other hand, for situations in\nwhich the density profile is a delta function along the third coordinate (i.e.,\nan infinitesimally thin disk), or any other function known a priori, we perform\na direct integration of Poisson's equation using a Green's functions approach.\nWe devise a number of test problems to verify the implementations of these two\nmethods.

From cloud formation to the early stages\n  of star formation in decaying conditions Abstract: We study the formation of giant dense cloud complexes and of stars within\nthem by means of SPH numerical simulations of the mildly supersonic collision\nof gas streams (``inflows'') in the warm neutral medium (WNM). The resulting\ncompressions cause cooling and turbulence generation in the gas, forming a\ncloud that then becomes self-gravitating and undergoes global collapse.\nSimultaneously, the turbulent, nonlinear density fluctuations induce fast,\nlocal collapse events. The simulations show that: a) The clouds are not in a\nstate of equilibrium. Instead, they undergo secular evolution. Initially, their\nmass and gravitational energy |Eg| increase steadily, while the turbulent\nenergy Ek reaches a plateau. b) When |Eg| becomes comparable to Ek, global\ncollapse begins, causing a simultaneous increase in both that maintains a\nnear-equipartition condition |Eg| ~ 2 Ek. c) Longer inflow durations delay the\nonset of global and local collapse, by maintaining a higher turbulent velocity\ndispersion in the cloud over longer times. d) The star formation rate is large\nfrom the beginning, without any period of slow and accelerating star formation.\ne) The column densities of the local star-forming clumps are very similar to\nreported values of the column density required for molecule formation,\nsuggesting that locally molecular gas and star formation occur nearly\nsimultaneously.

The equations of motion were not derived, rather they were\ninferred from the result one would obtain by using the Schwinger-Keldysh\nformalism. The formalism simultaneously ensures causality of the field\nequations and the reality of in-out operator amplitudes. This point was avoided\nin our previous paper as its discussion was too far afield. Here we first\ndemonstrate the features non-local actions generally possess: namely acausal\nequations of motion and non-real in-out operator amplitudes; and secondly how\nthe Schwinger-Keldysh formalism works to provide the characteristics we usually\ndesire from effective theories. \n\n"}

The first part reviews the work of Poincar\\'e on the Theory of (Special)\nRelativity. One emphasizes both the remarkable achievements of Poincar\\'e, and\nthe fact that he never came close to what is the essential conceptual\nachievement of Einstein: changing the concept of time. The second part reviews\na topic which probably would have appealed to Poincar\\'e because it involves\nseveral mathematical structures he worked on: chaotic dynamics, discrete\nreflection groups, and Lobachevskii space. This topic is the hidden role of\nKac-Moody algebras in the billiard description of the asymptotic behaviour of\ncertain Einstein-matter systems near a cosmological singularity. Of particular\ninterest are the Einstein-matter systems arising in the low-energy limit of\nsuperstring theory. These systems seem to exhibit the highest-rank hyperbolic\nKac-Moody algebras, and notably E(10), as hidden symmetries. \n\n"}

It is shown that higher order stringy corrections can lead to a class\nof dark energy models consistent with recent observations. The model can give\nrise to quintessence, deSitter or phantom dark energy, in last case without\nrecourse to negative kinetic energy field. The detailed treatment of\nreconstruction program for general scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is presented for\nany given cosmology. The explicit examples of reconstructed scalar potentials\nare given for accelerated (quintessence, cosmological constant or phantom)\nuniverse. Finally, the relation with modified $F(G)$ gravity is established on\nclassical level and is extended to include third order terms on curvature. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-th/0606090", "contents": "Title: Starting the Universe: Stable Violation of the Null Energy Condition and\n  Non-standard Cosmologies Abstract: We present a consistent effective theory that violates the null energy\ncondition (NEC) without developing any instabilities or other pathological\nfeatures. The model is the ghost condensate with the global shift symmetry\nsoftly broken by a potential. We show that this system can drive a cosmological\nexpansion with dH/dt > 0. Demanding the absence of instabilities in this model\nrequires dH/dt <~ H^2. We then construct a general low-energy effective theory\nthat describes scalar fluctuations about an arbitrary FRW background, and argue\nthat the qualitative features found in our model are very general for stable\nsystems that violate the NEC. Violating the NEC allows dramatically\nnon-standard cosmological histories. To illustrate this, we construct an\nexplicit model in which the expansion of our universe originates from an\nasymptotically flat state in the past, smoothing out the big-bang singularity\nwithin control of a low-energy effective theory. This gives an interesting\nalternative to standard inflation for solving the horizon problem. We also\nconstruct models in which the present acceleration has w < -1; a periodic\never-expanding universe and a model with a smooth ``bounce'' connecting a\ncontracting and expanding phase. \n\n"}

The equations of state are used as input for solving the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations for corresponding neutron stars. The\npotential part contribution of the symmetry energy to the total energy is\nparameterized in a generalized form both for low and high values of the baryon\ndensity. Special attention is devoted to the construction of the symmetry\nenergy in order to reproduce the results of most microscopic calculations of\ndense nuclear matter. The obtained nuclear equations of state are applied for\nthe systematic study of the global properties of a neutron star (masses, radii\nand composition). The calculated masses and radii of the neutron stars are\nplotted as a function of the potential part parameters of the symmetry energy.\nA linear relation between these parameters, the radius and the maximum mass of\nthe neutron star is obtained. In addition, a linear relation between the radius\nand the derivative of the symmetry energy near the saturation density is found.\nWe also address on the problem of the existence of correlation between the\npressure near the saturation density and the radius. \n\n"}
