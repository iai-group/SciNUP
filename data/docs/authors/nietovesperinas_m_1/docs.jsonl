In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking\nin the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.\nThis formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical\nproblems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the\npermeability of the {\\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked\nobjects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\\\"odinger form with the\nelectromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that\nthe electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially\nself-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily\nequivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium\n$\\var_0^{\\lambda\\nu}, \\mu^{\\lambda\\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the\ncoordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the\nscattering operator is the identity.

Furthermore, we prove\ncloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove\nthat it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals. \n\n"}

The analysis concentrates specifically on\nthe single-component Lennard-Jones system. We demonstrate that the potential\nmay be replaced, at fixed volume, by an effective power-law, but not because\nonly short distance encounters dominate the fluctuations. Indeed, contributions\nto the fluctuations are associated with the whole first peak of the RDF, as we\ndemonstrate by an analysis of the spatially resolved covariance matrix. The\nreason the effective power-law works so well depends on going beyond\nsingle-pair effects and on the constraint of fixed volume.

However, the\ndependence of the non-linear interaction on frequency and time makes it\ndifficult to preserve a coherent pulse shape that could justify a single mode\nmodel for the time-frequency degree of freedom of the photons. In this paper,\nwe analyze the problem of temporal multi-mode effects by considering the pulse\nshape of the average output field obtained from a coherent input pulse. It is\nshown that a significant part of the two photon state transformation can be\nderived from this semi-classical description of the optical non-linearity. The\neffect of a non-linear system on a two photon state can then be determined from\nthe density matrix dynamics of the coherently driven system using input-output\ntheory. As an example, the resonant non-linearity of a single two level atom is\ncharacterized. The results indicate that the most efficient non-linear effect\nmay not be the widely studied single mode phase shift, but the transfer of one\nof the photons to an orthogonal mode distinguished by its temporal and spectral\nproperties. \n\n"}

The results show that the nature of adhesion between\ngraphene and its substrate is qualitatively dependent on the surface defect\ntype. In particular, the interaction between graphene and silicon-terminated\nSiO$_2$ originates exclusively from the vdW interaction, whereas the\noxygen-terminated surface provides additional ionic contribution to the binding\narising from interfacial charge transfer ($p$-type doping of graphene).

To describe this setting, I develop a\ntwo-active-electron quantum theory for a single atom assuming no Coulomb\ninteraction among the electrons; one electron performs a typical HHG three-step\nprocess whereas another electron is excited (or even Rabi flops) by intense x\nrays from the core shell into the valence hole after the first electron has\nleft the atom.

We study a very compact self-seeding\nscheme with a grating monochromator originally designed at SLAC, which can be\nstraightforwardly installed in the SASE3 type undulator beamline at the\nEuropean XFEL. The monochromator design is based on a toroidal VLS grating\nworking at a fixed incidence angle mounting without entrance slit. It covers\nthe spectral range from 300 eV to 1000 eV. The optical system was studied using\nwave optics method (in comparison with ray tracing) to evaluate the performance\nof the self-seeding scheme. Our wave optics analysis takes into account the\nactual beam wavefront of the radiation from the coherent FEL source, third\norder aberrations, and errors from each optical element.

For waves,\nhowever, diffusion is an approximation that disregards the possibility of\ninterference. Anderson localization, which manifests itself through a vanishing\ndiffusion coefficient in an infinite system, originates from constructive\ninterference of waves traveling in loop trajectories -- pairs of time-reversed\npaths returning to the same point. In an open system of finite size, the return\nprobability through such paths is reduced, particularly near the boundary where\nwaves may escape. Based on this argument, the self-consistent theory of\nlocalization and the supersymmetric field theory predict that the diffusion\ncoefficient varies spatially inside the system. A direct experimental\nobservation of this effect is a challenge because it requires monitoring wave\ntransport inside the system. Here, we fabricate two-dimensional photonic random\nmedia and probe position-dependent diffusion inside the sample from the third\ndimension. By varying the geometry of the system or the dissipation which also\nlimits the size of loop trajectories, we are able to control the\nrenormalization of the diffusion coefficient.

Experimental studies have shown that\nsuch modes also strongly scatter the carrier light, enabling very sensitive\nreadout of the acoustic modes. The 3-mode scattering from the thermal\nfluctuation of large population of ultrasonic modes would causes random changes\nin occupation number of the carrier light and cavity transverse optical modes.\nBecause the thermal fluctuation time scale (set by the acoustic mode relaxation\ntimes) is typically a few seconds, the noise spectrum from thermally induced\nphoton number fluctuations is strongly peaked at low frequency.

We theoretically investigate the possible effect of this\nnoise and show that in advanced detectors under construction three mode\ninteraction noise is below the standard quantum limit, but could set limits on\nfuture low frequency detectors that aim to exceed the free mass standard\nquantum limit. \n\n"}

These\nsystem-dependent pre-pulses in the nanosecond and/or picosecond regimes are\noften intense enough to modify the target significantly by ionizing and forming\na plasma layer in front of the target. Time resolved interferometry offers a\nrobust way to characterize the expanding plasma during this period.

The first of\nthese amplifiers acts as the pump and delivers maximal energy to the\ninteraction region. The second amplifier is frequency shifted and then\nfrequency doubled to generate the femtosecond probe pulse. After passing\nthrough the laser-target interaction region, the probe pulse is split and\nrecombined in a laterally sheared Michelson interferometer.

We address some properties of this type of systems by using a\nSlater-Koster tight-binding model. We predict that topological\nsuperconductivity is nearly universal when ferromagnetic transition metal\nchains form straight lines on superconducting substrates and that it is\npossible for more complex chain structures. The proximity induced\nsuperconducting gap is $\\sim \\Delta E_{so} / J$ where $\\Delta$ is the $s$-wave\npair-potential on the chain, $E_{so}$ is the spin-orbit splitting energy\ninduced in the normal chain state bands by hybridization with the\nsuperconducting substrate, and $J$ is the exchange-splitting of the\nferromagnetic chain $d$-bands. Because of the topological character of the 1D\nsuperconducting state, Majorana end modes appear within the gaps of finite\nlength chains. We find, in agreement with experiment, that when the chain and\nsubstrate orbitals are strongly hybridized, Majorana end modes are\nsubstantially reduced in amplitude when separated from the chain end by less\nthan the coherence length defined by the $p$-wave superconducting gap.

This theorem\nfamously states that the maximum efficiency depends only on the temperature of\nthe heat baths used by the engine, but not on the specific structure of baths.\nHere, we show that when the heat baths are finite in size, and when the engine\noperates in the quantum nanoregime, a revision to this statement is required.\nWe show that one may still achieve the Carnot efficiency, when certain\nconditions on the bath structure are satisfied; however if that is not the\ncase, then the maximum achievable efficiency can reduce to a value which is\nstrictly less than Carnot. We derive the maximum efficiency for the case when\none of the baths is composed of qubits. Furthermore, we show that the maximum\nefficiency is determined by either the standard second law of thermodynamics,\nanalogously to the macroscopic case, or by the non increase of the max relative\nentropy, which is a quantity previously associated with the single shot regime\nin many quantum protocols. This relative entropic quantity emerges as a\nconsequence of additional constraints, called generalized free energies, that\ngovern thermodynamical transitions in the nanoregime.

As such, they operate under direct electrical\npumping at both mid-infrared and THz frequencies, making them very attractive\nfor dual-comb spectroscopy. Performance levels are continuously improving, with\naverage powers over 100 mW and frequency coverage of 100 cm$^{-1}$ in the\nmid-infrared. In the THz range, 10 mW of average power and 600 GHz of frequency\ncoverage are reported. As a result of the very short upper state lifetime of\nthe gain medium, the mode proliferation in these sources arises from four wave\nmixing rather than saturable absorption. As a result, their optical output is\ncharacterized by the tendency of small intensity modulation of the output\npower, and the relative phases of the modes to be similar to the ones of a\nfrequency modulated laser.

Thus, the possibility that the optical force field of the light\npulse would drive forward an atomic mass density wave (MDW) and the related\nkinetic and elastic energies is neglected. In this work, we present foundations\nof a covariant theory of light propagation in a medium by considering a light\nwave simultaneously with the dynamics of the medium atoms driven by optoelastic\nforces between the induced dipoles and the electromagnetic field. We prove that\nthe transfer of mass as MDW associated with the light pulse, the photon mass\ndrag effect, gives an essential contribution to the total momentum of the light\npulse, which becomes equal to the Minkowski momentum. Thus, our theory also\nresolves the centenary Abraham-Minkowski controversy of the momentum of light\nin a nondispersive medium.

On the other hand, it opens new paths toward\nefficient attosecond pulse generation, novel imaging of electronic wave\nfunctions, and enhancement of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) intensity. A\nkey feature of HHG in a solid (as compared to the well-understood phenomena of\nHHG in an atomic gas) is the delocalization of the process, whereby an electron\nionized from one site in the periodic lattice may recombine with any other.\nHere, we develop an analytic model, based on the localized Wannier wave\nfunctions in the valence band and delocalized Bloch functions in the conduction\nband. This Wannier-Bloch approach assesses the contributions of individual\nlattice sites to the HHG process, and hence addresses precisely the question of\nlocalization of harmonic emission in solids.

EuS, a wide-band-gap ferromagnetic\ninsulator with a Curie temperature around 16 K, and SrTiO$_3$ (STO), an\nimportant substrate for engineering heterostructures, may support these phases.\nWe present scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)\nmeasurements of EuS grown epitaxially on STO that reveal micron-scale\nvariations in ferromagnetism and paramagnetism.

We have recently\npresented foundations of a covariant theory of light propagation in a medium by\nconsidering a light wave simultaneously with the dynamics of the medium atoms\ndriven by optoelastic forces between the induced dipoles and the\nelectromagnetic field. In the previously discussed mass-polariton (MP)\nquasiparticle approach, we considered the light pulse as an isolated coupled\nstate between the photon and matter and showed that the momentum and the\ntransferred mass of MP follow unambiguously from the Lorentz invariance and the\nfundamental conservation laws of nature. In the present work, we combine the\nelectrodynamics of continuous media and elasticity theory to account for the\nspace- and time dependent dynamics of the light pulse and the associated mass\nand momentum distributions of the mass density wave (MDW).

In particular, steering of\ncontinuous variable Gaussian states has been extensively studied as a\nmanifestation of the EPR paradox. While most of these studies focused on\nquadrature measurements for steering detection, two recent works revealed that\nthere exist Gaussian states which are only steerable by non-Gaussian\nmeasurements.

We first derive the density matrix elements of\ntwo-mode squeezed thermal states in the Fock basis, which may be of independent\ninterest. We then use such a representation to investigate steering of these\nstates as detected by a nonlinear criterion, based on second moments of the\npseudospin correlation matrix. This analysis reveals previously unexplored\nregimes where non-Gaussian measurements are more effective than Gaussian ones\nto witness steering of Gaussian states in the presence of local noise.

The simulation shows that a more efficient and stable\ncoherent random lasing can be achieved with monodisperse scatterers having\namplification in the intra-scatterer region. To realize that experimentally,\nthe array of amplifying microdroplets is created using a vibrating orifice\ndroplet generator.

In fact, in many cases they do not even satisfy the weaker condition\nof subadditivity. In the present paper we shed light on this subject by\nproviding a detailed survey of R\\'enyi entropies for bosonic and fermionic\nGaussian states. We show that for bosons the R\\'enyi entropies always satisfy\nsubadditivity, but not necessarily strong subadditivity. Conversely, for\nfermions both do not hold in general. We provide the precise intervals of the\nR\\'enyi index $\\alpha$ for which subadditivity and strong subadditivity are\nvalid in each case. \n\n"}

This allows us to\nnumerically study very large system sizes and to directly access observables\nrelated to the eigenfunctions and energy level statistics. In agreement with\nrecent works, we establish the existence of a delocalized non-ergodic phase on\nCayley trees. On random regular graphs instead our results indicate that\nergodicity is recovered when the system size is larger than a cross-over scale\n$N_c (W)$, which diverges exponentially fast approaching the localization\ntransition. This scale corresponds to the size at which the mean-level spacing\nbecomes smaller than the Thouless energy $E_{Th} (W)$. Such energy scale, which\nvanishes exponentially fast approaching the localization transition, is the one\nbelow which ergodicity in the level statistics is restored in the thermodynamic\nlimit. Remarkably, the behavior of random regular graphs below $N_c (W)$\ncoincides with the one found close to the root of loop-less infinite Cayley\ntrees, {\\it i.e.} only above $N_c (W)$ the effects of loops emerge and random\nregular graphs behave differently from Cayley trees.

Given the very fast divergence of $N_c(W)$ and\n$\\hbar/E_{Th} (W)$ these non-ergodic effects are very pronounced in a large\nregion preceding the localization transition, and they can be related to the\nintermediate phase present on Cayley trees. \n\n"}

On the\nbasis of these concepts and K-theory, we complete classification of\nnon-Hermitian topological phases in arbitrary dimensions and symmetry classes.\nRemarkably, non-Hermitian topology depends on the type of complex-energy gaps\nand multiple topological structures appear for each symmetry class and each\nspatial dimension, which are also illustrated in detail with concrete examples.\nMoreover, the bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems is\nelucidated within our framework, and symmetries preventing the non-Hermitian\nskin effect are identified. Our classification not only categorizes recently\nobserved lasing and transport topological phenomena, but also predicts a new\ntype of symmetry-protected topological lasers with lasing helical edge states\nand dissipative topological superconductors with nonorthogonal Majorana edge\nstates. Furthermore, our theory provides topological classification of\nHermitian and non-Hermitian free bosons. \n\n"}

To\nbring such control to the atomic-scale limit, it is important to consider\nphonon polaritons in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Recent studies have pointed\nout that in 2D, splitting between longitudinal and transverse optical (LO and\nTO) phonons is absent at the $\\Gamma$ point, even for polar materials. Does\nthis lack of LO--TO splitting imply the absence of a phonon polariton in polar\nmonolayers?
