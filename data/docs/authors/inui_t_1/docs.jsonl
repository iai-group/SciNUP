Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

It is therefore expected to\nbe quickly rotating when it ignites as a Type Ia supernova. The thermal and\nshearing profile are important for subsequent flame propagation. We highlight\nprocesses that could affect the WD shear, during accretion as well as during\nthe ~1000 years of pre-explosive simmering. Baroclinic instabilities and/or the\nshear growth of small magnetic fields provide sufficient torque to bring the WD\nvery close to solid body rotation during accretion. The lack of significant\nshear makes it difficult to grow a WD substantially past the typical\nChandrasekhar mass. Once carbon ignites, a convective region spreads from the\nWD's center. This phase occurs regardless of progenitor scenario, and therefore\nit is of great interest for understanding how the WD interior is prepared\nbefore the explosive burning begins. We summarize some of the key properties of\nthe convective region, which includes demonstrating that the mass enclosed by\nconvection at any given time depends most sensitively on a single parameter\nthat can be expressed as either the ratio of temperatures or densities at the\ntop and bottom of the convection zone.

The potential is derived from an N-body calculation and leads to a\nmulti-armed time-evolving pattern. The gas forms long spiral arms typical of\ngrand design galaxies, although the spiral pattern is asymmetric. The primary\ndifference from a grand-design spiral galaxy, which has a consistent 2/4-armed\npattern, is that instead of passing through the spiral arms, gas generally\nfalls into a developing potential minimum and is released only when the local\nminimum dissolves. In this case, the densest gas is coincident with the spiral\npotential, rather than offset as in the grand-design spirals. We would there\nfore expect no offset between the spiral shock and star formation, and no\nobvious co-rotation radius. Spurs which occur in grand-design spirals when\nlarge clumps are sheared off leaving the spiral arms, are rare in the active,\ntime-evolving spiral reported here. Instead, large branches are formed from\nspiral arms when the underlying spiral potential is dissolving due to the\nN-body dynamics. We find that the molecular cloud mass spectrum for the active\npotential is similar to that for clouds in grand design calculations, depending\nprimarily on the ambient pressure rather than the nature of the potential. The\nlargest molecular clouds occur when spiral arms collide, rather than by\nagglomeration within a spiral arm. \n\n"}

We find agglomeration is\npredominant when both the warm and cold components of the ISM are effectively\nstable to gravitational instabilities. In this case, the spacing (and\nconsequently mass) of clouds and spurs along the spiral arms is determined by\nthe orbits of the gas particles and correlates with their epicyclic radii (or\nequivalently spiral shock strength). Notably GMCs formed primarily by\nagglomeration tend to be unbound associations of many smaller clouds, which\ndisperse upon leaving the spiral arms. These GMCs are likely to be more massive\nin galaxies with stronger spiral shocks or higher surface densities. GMCs\nformed by agglomeration are also found to exhibit both prograde and retrograde\nrotation, a consequence of the clumpiness of the gas.

We evaluate the prospects for an all-sky transit survey targeted\nto the brightest stars, that would find the most favorable cases for\nphotometric and spectroscopic characterization using the James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST). We use the proposed Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite\n(TESS) as representative of an all-sky survey. We couple the simulated TESS\nyield to a sensitivity model for the MIRI and NIRSpec instruments on JWST. We\nfocus on the TESS planets with radii between Earth and Neptune. Our simulations\nconsider secondary eclipse filter photometry using JWST/MIRI, comparing the 11-\nand 15-micron bands to measure CO2 absorption in superEarths, as well as\nJWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of water absorption from 1.7-3.0 microns, and CO2\nabsorption at 4.3-microns.

In the accretion model the secondary star accretes mass\nfrom the primary wind near periastron passage, a process that suppresses the\nsecondary wind. As the shocked secondary wind is responsible for most of the\nX-ray emission, the accretion process accounts for the X-ray minimum. The early\nexit from the 2009 X-ray minimum after four weeks, instead of ten weeks as in\nthe two previous minima, is attributed to the primary wind that during the last\nminimum was somewhat faster and of lower mass loss rate than during the two\nprevious X-ray minima. This results in a much lower mass accretion rate during\nthe X-ray minimum. We show that using fluctuations in these quantities that are\nwithin the range deduced from fluctuations in the X-ray flux outside the\nminimum, can account for the short duration of the last X-ray minimum. The\nshorter X-ray minimum may have further implications on the recovery of the\nsystem from the spectroscopic event. \n\n"}

Contrary to the\nearlier claim, we found no clear evidence for variation of period derivatives\nbetween superoutburst of the same object.

Furthermore,\ninstead of forming dilute halos around the remnant as in the case of NS\nmergers, the coalescence of SSs results in a differentially rotating\nhypermassive object with a sharp surface layer surrounded by a geometrically\nthin, clumpy high-density SQM disk. We also investigate the importance of\nincluding non-zero temperature equations of state (EoSs) in NS and SS merger\nsimulations. In both cases we find a crucial sensitivity of the dynamics and\noutcome of the coalescence to thermal effects, which, e.g., determine the outer\nremnant structure and the delay time of the dense remnant core to black hole\ncollapse. For comparing and classifying the GW signals, we use a number of\ncharacteristic quantities like the maximum frequency during inspiral or the\ndominant frequency of oscillations of the postmerger remnant. In general, these\nfrequencies are higher for SS mergers. If not, additional features of the GW\nluminosity spectrum may help to discriminate coalescence events of the\ndifferent types.

In this scenario, the use of the Dirac equation\nis required for a satisfactory evolution of fermionic mass-eigenstates since in\nthe standard treatment of oscillations the mass-eigenstates are implicitly\nassumed to be scalars and, consequently, the spinorial form of neutrino wave\nfunctions is not included in the calculations. Within first quantized theories,\nbesides flavor oscillations, chiral oscillations automatically appear when we\nset the dynamic equations for a fermionic Dirac-type particle. The left-handed\nchiral nature of created and detected neutrinos can be implemented in the first\nquantized Dirac theory in presence of mixing; the probability loss due to the\nchanging of initially left-handed neutrinos to the undetected right-handed\nneutrinos can be obtained in analytic form. In the context of a causal\nrelativistic theory of a free particle, one of the two effects should be\npresent in flavor oscillations: (a) rapid oscillations or (b) initial flavor\nviolation. Concerning second quantized approaches, a simple second quantized\ntreatment exhibits a tiny but inevitable initial flavor violation without the\npossibility of rapid oscillations. Such effect is a consequence of an\nintrinsically indefinite but approximately well defined neutrino flavor. The\nviolation effects are shown to be much larger than loop induced lepton flavor\nviolation processes, already present in the standard model in the presence of\nmassive neutrinos with mixing.

We find that the use of a weighted correlation function results in a\ndilution of the magnitude of any radial dependence of properties and a smearing\nout of that radial dependence in radius, compared to the input behavior. We\npresent a quantitative discussion of the dilution in the magnitude of radial\ndependence in properties in the special case of a constant enhancement at r <\nrc. In this particular case where there was a SFR enhancement at small radius r\n< rc = 35 kpc, the matching of one member of an enhanced pair with a\nnon-enhanced galaxy in the same group gives an artificial enhancement out to\nlarge radius ~ 200 kpc.

This makes the relation between\nthe observed shear, the intrinsic shear and lensing distortion more simple and\nthus higher-order calculation more easy. The elliptical weight function allows\nus to measure the mutiplemoment of shape of background galaxies more precisely\nby weighting highly to brighter parts of image and moreover to reduce\nsystematic error due to insufficient expansion of the weight function in the\noriginal approach of KSB.

This is the\nfirst time that the properties of a modestly sized (M_vir~1.4e14 M_sun, kT~2.3\nkeV), dynamically young cluster have been studied out to the virial radius. The\ndensity profile of the cluster can be described by a surprisingly shallow\npower-law with index 1.21+/-0.12.

In particular, we\nexplore the theoretical uncertainties associated with modeling contributions of\nhadronic intermediate states. Taking into account constraints from low- and\nhigh-energy, parity-conserving electroproduction measurements, choosing\ndifferent models for contributions from the non-resonant processes, and\nperforming the corresponding flavor rotations to obtain the electroweak\namplitude, we arrive at an estimate of the uncertainty in the total\ncontribution to the parity-violating asymmetry. At the kinematics of the Q-Weak\nexperiment, we obtain a correction to the asymmetry equivalent to a shift in\nthe proton weak charge of $(0.0054\\pm0.0020)$. This should be compared to the\nvalue of the proton's weak charge of $\\qwp=0.0713\\pm0.0008$ that includes SM\ncontributions at tree level and one-loop radiative corrections. Therefore, we\nobtain a new Standard Model prediction for the parity-violating asymmetry in\nthe kinematics of the Q-Weak experiment of $(0.0767\\pm0.0008\\pm0.0020_{\\gamma\nZ})$. The latter error leads to a relative uncertainty of 2.8% in the\ndetermination of the proton's weak charge, and is dominated by the uncertainty\nin the isospin structure of the inclusive cross section. We argue that future\nparity-violating inelastic $ep$ asymmetry measurements at low-to-moderate $Q^2$\nand $W^2$ could be exploited to reduce the uncertainty associated with the\ndispersion correction. Because the corresponding shift and error bar decrease\nmonotonically with decreasing beam energy, a determination of the proton's weak\ncharge with a lower-energy experiment or measurements of \"isotope ratios\" in\natomic parity-violation could provide a useful cross check on any implications\nfor physics beyond the Standard Model derived from the Q-Weak measurement. \n\n"}

We provide an interpretation of the formation of these\nbinaries that explains the total number formed and their distribution of\nenergies. A population of weakly bound binaries can always be found in the\ncluster, in accordance with statistical detailed balance, limited at the soft\nend only by the current size of the cluster and whatever observational criteria\nare imposed. At any given time, the observed soft binary distribution is\npredominantly a snapshot of a transient population.

The total number of wide binaries that form, and their\nenergy distribution, are insensitive to the cluster population; the number is\napproximately one per cluster.

We can directly observe and test for isotropy, but to\nlink this to homogeneity, we need to assume the Copernican Principle. First, we\ndiscuss the link between isotropic observations on the past lightcone and\nisotropic spacetime geometry: what observations do we need to be isotropic in\norder to deduce spacetime isotropy? Second, we discuss what we can say with the\nCopernican assumption.

These morphological disturbances\nare related to the ram-pressure stripping and tidal interaction that galaxies\nundergo in this dense cluster environment. To quantify the morphological\ntransformation of the HI disks, we compute the morphological parameters of CAS,\nGini, and M20 and our own GM for 51 galaxies in 48 HI column density maps from\nthe VIVA project. Some morphological phenomena can be identified in this space\nof relatively low resolution HI data. Truncation of the HI disk can be cleanly\nidentified via the Concentration parameter (C<1) and Concentration can also be\nused to identify HI deficient disks (1<C<5). Tidal interaction is typically\nidentified using combinations of these morphological parameters, applied to\n(optical) images of galaxies. We find that some selection criteria (Gini-M20,\nAsymmetry, and a modified Concentration-M20) are still applicable for the\ncoarse (~15\" FWHM) VIVA HI data. The phenomena of tidal tails can be reasonably\nwell identified using the Gini-M20 criterion (60% of galaxies with tails\nidentified but with as many contaminants).

Antiprotons can play a key role validating those\ninterpretations since they are copiously produced by WIMP annihilations in the\nGalactic halo, and the secondary antiproton background produced by Cosmic Ray\n(CR) interactions is predicted with fair accuracy and matches the observed\nspectrum very well. Using the publicly available numerical DRAGON code, we\nreconsider antiprotons as a tool to constrain DM models discussing its power\nand limitations. We provide updated constraints on a wide class of annihilating\nDM models by comparing our predictions against the most up-to-date ap\nmeasurements, taking also into account the latest spectral information on the\np, He and other CR nuclei fluxes. Doing that, we probe carefully the\nuncertainties associated to both secondary and DM originated antiprotons, by\nusing a variety of distinctively different assumptions for the propagation of\nCRs and for the DM distribution in the Galaxy. We find that the impact of the\nastrophysical uncertainties on constraining the DM properties can be much\nstronger, up to a factor of ~50, than the one due to uncertainties on the DM\ndistribution (~2-6). Remarkably, even reducing the uncertainties on the\npropagation parameters derived by local observables, non-local effects can\nstill change DM model constraints even by 50%. Nevertheless, current ap data\nplace tight constraints on DM models, excluding some of those suggested in\nconnection with indirect and direct searches. Finally we discuss the power of\nupcoming CR spectral data from the AMS-02 observatory to drastically reduce the\nuncertainties discussed in this paper and estimate the expected sensitivity of\nthis instrument to some sets of DM models. \n\n"}

We further demonstrate that this scale\ncorresponds to that where the correlation between the color of galaxies and\nenvironmental density 1+{\\delta} is the strongest. For this optimal smoothing\nR0 no additional correlations with e are observed. The apparent dependence on\ntidal ellipticity e at other smoothing scales Rs can be viewed as a geometric\neffect, arising from the cross correlation be- tween (1+{\\delta}o) and e(Rs).\nWe perform the same analysis on numerical simulations with semi-analytical\nmodeling (SAM) of galaxy formation. The e dependence of the galaxy properties\nshows similar behavior to that in the SDSS, although the color-density cor-\nrelation is significantly stronger in the SAM. The 'optimal adaptive smoothing\nscale' in the SAM is also closely related to the distance to the\n3rd-nearest-neighbor of a galaxy, and its characteristic value is consistent\nwith, albeit slightly smaller than for SDSS. \n\n"}

Abstract: We revisit the issue of color neutrality in effective model descriptions of\ndense quark matter based on global color symmetry.

We point out that\nthe constraint of color neutrality must be carefully generalized in order to\nobtain physically consistent and well-defined results. Particularly important\nis that the collective modes associated with order parameter fluctuations\ncouple to charge density fluctuations in the neutral medium. We start by\nproving explicitly that, in contrast to claims made previously in literature,\nNambu-Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken global color symmetry remain\nexactly massless even after imposing the color neutrality constraint. As the\nnext step, we make the argument general by using effective field theory.

The simulation begins with a twisted flux\nrope emerging at the lower boundary and pushing into a pre-existing coronal\npotential arcade field. At a chosen time the emergence is stopped with the\nlower boundary taken to be rigid. Then the coronal flux rope settles into a\nquasi-static rise phase during which an underlying, central sigmoid-shaped\ncurrent layer forms along the so called hyperbolic flux tube (HFT), a\ngeneralization of the X-line configuration. Reconnections in the dissipating\ncurrent layer effectively add twisted flux to the flux rope and thus allow it\nto rise quasi-statically, even though the magnetic energy is decreasing as the\nsystem relaxes. We examine the thermal features produced by the current layer\nformation and the associated \"tether-cutting\" reconnections as a result of\nheating and field aligned thermal conduction. It is found that a central hot,\nlow-density channel containing reconnected, twisted flux threading under the\nflux rope axis forms on top of the central current layer. When viewed in the\nline of sight roughly aligned with the hot channel (which is roughly along the\nneutral line), the central current layer appears as a high-density vertical\ncolumn with upward extensions as a \"U\" shaped dense shell enclosing a central\nhot, low-density void.

Our MHD simulation suggests that they are the signatures\nof the development of the HFT topology and the associated tether-cutting\nreconnections, and that the central void grows and rises with the\nreconnections, until the flux rope reaches the critical height for the onset of\nthe torus instability and dynamic eruption ensues. \n\n"}

We use\nhigh-quality observations with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope to establish\nthat so-called type II spicules are characterized by the simultaneous action of\nthree different types of motion: 1. field-aligned flows of order 50-100 km/s,\n2. swaying motions of order 15-20 km/s, and 3. torsional motions of order 25-30\nkm/s. The first two modes have been studied in detail before, but not the\ntorsional motions. Our analysis of many near-limb and off-limb spectra and\nnarrow-band images yields strong evidence that most, if not all, type-II\nspicules undergo large torsional modulation and that these motions, like\nspicule swaying, represent Alfvenic waves propagating outward at several\nhundred km/s.

In an intermediate regime, with a\nmass range that depends on the uncertain details of rotation and mass loss\nduring the star's life, a NS is initially formed which then experiences\nfallback accretion and collapse to a BH. The electromagnetic consequence of\nsuch an event is not clear. Depending on the progenitor's structure,\npossibilities range from a long gamma-ray burst to a Type II supernova (that\nmay or may not be jet-powered) to a collapse with a weak electromagnetic\nsignature. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide the exciting opportunity to peer\nthrough the envelope of a dying massive star and directly probe what is\noccurring inside. We explore whether fallback onto young NSs can be detected by\nground-based interferometers. When the incoming material has sufficient angular\nmomentum to form a disk, the accretion spins up the NS sufficiently to produce\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities and gravitational radiation at frequencies of\n~700-2400 Hz for ~30-3000 s until collapse to a BH occurs. Using a realistic\nexcess cross-power search algorithm, we show that such events are detectable by\nAdvanced LIGO out to ~17 Mpc. From the rate of nearby core-collapse supernovae,\nwe estimate that there will be ~1-2 events each year that are worth checking\nfor fallback GWs. The observation of these unique GW signatures coincident with\nelectromagnetic detections would identify the transient events that are\nassociated with this channel of BH formation, while providing information about\nthe protoneutron star progenitor. \n\n"}

Previous analysis of this cluster revealed a large\ndispersion in the line strength of the infrared Ca II triplet, suggesting an\nintrinsic star-to-star scatter in its Fe or Ca content. From our analysis, we\nassess that all the investigated stars share the same [Fe/H], [Ca/Fe] and\n[Ti/Fe] abundance ratios, while a large spread in Mg and K abundances is\ndetected. The distribution of [Mg/Fe] is bimodal, with ~40% of the observed\ntargets having subsolar [Mg/Fe], down to [Mg/Fe] ~ -1 dex, a level of\nMg-deficiency never observed before in globular clusters. It is found that the\nlarge dispersion in Mg abundances is likely the main origin of the observed\ndispersion of the Ca II triplet lines strengths (that can be erroneously\ninterpreted in terms of Fe or Ca abundance scatter) because Mg plays a relevant\nrole in the atmosphere of giant stars as an electron donor.

Abstract: Given a solar luminosity L_Ar = 0.75 L_0 at the beginning of the Archean 3.8\nGyr ago, where L_0 is the present-day one, if the heliocentric distance r of\nthe Earth was r_Ar = 0.956 r_0, the solar irradiance would have been as large\nas I_Ar = 0.82 I_0. It would allowed for a liquid ocean on the terrestrial\nsurface which, otherwise, would have been frozen, contrary to the empirical\nevidence. By further assuming that some physical mechanism subsequently\ndisplaced the Earth towards its current distance in such a way that the\nirradiance stayed substantially constant over the entire Archean from 3.8 Gyr\nto 2.5 Gyr ago, a relative recession rate as large as \\dot r/r \\simeq 3.4 x\n10^-11 yr^-1 would have been required. Although such a figure is roughly of the\nsame order of magnitude of the value of the Hubble parameter 3.8 Gyr ago H_Ar =\n1.192 H_0 = 8.2 x 10^-11 yr^-1, standard general relativity rules out\ncosmological explanations for the hypothesized Earth' s recession rate.\nInstead, a class of modified theories of gravitation with nonminimal coupling\nbetween the matter and the metric naturally predicts a secular variation of the\nrelative distance of a localized two-body system, thus yielding a potentially\nviable candidate to explain the putative recession of the Earth' s orbit.\nAnother competing mechanism of classical origin which could, in principle,\nallow for the desired effect is the mass loss which either the Sun or the Earth\nitself may have experienced during the Archean. On the one hand, this implies\nthat our planet should have lost 2% of its present mass in the form of\neroded/evaporated hydrosphere which, thus, should have been two orders of\nmagnitude larger than now. On the other hand, it is widely believed that the\nSun could have lost mass at an enhanced rate due to a stronger solar wind in\nthe past for not more than \\sim 0.2-0.3 Gyr. \n\n"}

While most of\nthese shocks are weak and inefficient accelerators of cosmic rays (CRs), there\nare a number of strong, energetic shocks which can produce large amounts of CR\nprotons via diffusive shock acceleration.

By performing a global\nanalysis, we obtain the 68% C.L. constraints on the parameters of the model\nfrom the Planck+WP and BICEP2 data together: the jump scale $\\log_{10}(k_{\\rm\nb}/{\\rm Mpc}^{-1})=-2.4\\pm0.2$ and the spectrum amplitude ratio of\nbounce-to-inflation $r_B\\equiv P_{\\rm m} / A_{\\rm s} = 0.71\\pm0.09$. Our result\nreveals that the bounce inflation scenario can simultaneously explain the\nPlanck and BICEP2 observations better than the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model, and\ncan be verified by the future CMB polarization measurements. \n\n"}

Therefore, the final stage consists of a binary made of\na MSP and the core of the deeply peeled companion. In the last years, however\nan increasing number of systems deviating from these expectations has been\ndiscovered, thus strongly indicating that our understanding of MSPs is far to\nbe complete. The identification of the optical companions to binary MSPs is\ncrucial to constrain the formation and evolution of these objects. In dense\nenvironments such as Globular Clusters (GCs), it also allows us to get insights\non the cluster internal dynamics. By using deep photometric data, acquired both\nfrom space and ground-based telescopes, we identified 5 new companions to MSPs.\nThree of them being located in GCs and two in the Galactic Field.

Three simple models of dust emission were fit to the\nobservations: a single temperature blackbody modified by a power- law\nemissivity (SMBB), a single temperature blackbody modified by a broken\npower-law emissivity (BEMBB), and two blackbodies with different temperatures,\nboth modified by the same power-law emissivity (TTMBB).

By a forward modeling\napproach we analyze in a qualitative manner the impact of different\ndifferential rotation profiles on the splittings of p-mode oscillation\nfrequencies. The optimum modes for inference on differential rotation are\nidentified along with the best value of the stellar inclination angle.

This constraint agreed\nwith color-magnitude and spectroscopic redshift constraints (0.179 < z < 0.56),\nRecently, however, a much higher redshift was proposed for this blazar (z >\n1.2). This value was debated because if true, it would imply either that the\nrelevant absorption processes of gamma-rays are not well understood or that the\nEBL is dramatically different from what is believed today. This high redshift\nwas not confirmed by three independent new spectroscopic observations at high\nsignal-to-noise ratios.\n  Given that BL-Lac are typically hosted by elliptical galaxies, which in turn\nare associated with groups, we aim to find the host group of galaxies of PKS\n0447-439.

The focus is put\nhere on stability with respect to perturbations of the same period as the wave,\nfor KdV-like systems of one-dimensional Hamiltonian PDEs. Stability criteria\nare derived and investigated first in a general abstract framework, and then\napplied to three basic examples that are very closely related, and ubiquitous\nin mathematical physics, namely, a quasilinear version of the generalized\nKorteweg--de Vries equation (qKdV), and the Euler--Korteweg system in both\nEulerian coordinates (EKE) and in mass Lagrangian coordinates (EKL). Those\ncriteria consist of a necessary condition for spectral stability, and of a\nsufficient condition for orbital stability. Both are expressed in terms of a\nsingle function, the abbreviated action integral along the orbits of waves in\nthe phase plane, which is the counterpart of the solitary waves moment of\ninstability introduced by Boussinesq. Regarding solitary waves, the celebrated\nGrillakis--Shatah--Strauss stability criteria amount to looking for the sign of\nthe second derivative of the moment of instability with respect to the wave\nspeed. For periodic waves, the most striking results obtained here can be\nsummarized as: an odd value for the difference between N -- the size of the PDE\nsystem -- and the negative signature of the Hessian of the action implies\nspectral instability, whereas a negative signature of the same Hessian being\nequal to N implies orbital stability. Since these stability criteria are merely\nencoded by the negative signature of matrices, they can at least be checked\nnumerically. Various numerical experiments are presented, which clearly\ndiscriminate between stable cases and unstable cases for (qKdV), (EKE) and\n(EKL). \n\n"}

We argue that\nsubstructure variables cannot use HCAL information to access the microscopic\nnature of jets much narrower than the hadronic shower size, which we call\nsuperboosted massive jets. It implies that roughly 15% of their transverse\nenergy profile remains inaccessible due to the presence of long-lived neutral\nhadrons. This part of the jet substructure is also subject to order-one\nfluctuations. We demonstrate that the effects of the fluctuations are not\nreduced when a global correction to jet variables is applied. The above leads\nto fundamental limitations in the ability to extract intrinsic information from\njets in the superboosted regime. The neutral fraction of a jet is correlated\nwith its flavor.

We have recently identified a spiral\ninstability in the post-merger phase of DD mergers and demonstrated that this\ninstability self-consistently leads to detonation in some cases.

Here, we utilize the SuperNu radiative transfer\nsoftware to calculate three-dimensional synthetic light curves and spectra of\nthe spiral merger simulation with a system mass of 2.1 $M_\\odot$ from Kashyap\net al. Because of their large system masses, both violent and spiral merger\nlight curves are slowly declining. The spiral merger resembles very slowly\ndeclining SNe Ia, including SN 2001ay, and provides a more natural explanation\nfor its observed properties than other SN Ia explosion models. Previous\nsynthetic light curves and spectra of violent DD mergers demonstrate a strong\ndependence on viewing angle, which is in conflict with observations.

Because the ISM is turbulent, a given\npatch of ISM exhibits sub-patches with a range of surface densities. The\nhigh-density patches are 'pushed' by feedback, thereby driving turbulence and\nself-regulating local star formation. Sufficiently low-density patches,\nhowever, are accelerated to above the escape velocity before the region can\nself-adjust and are thus vented as outflows. In the\nturbulent-pressure-supported regime, when the gas fraction is $\\gtrsim 0.3$,\nthe ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion to the circular velocity is\nsufficiently high that at any given time, of order half of the ISM has surface\ndensity less than the critical value and thus can be blown out on a dynamical\ntime. The resulting outflows have a mass-loading factor ($\\eta \\equiv M_{\\rm\nout}/M_{\\star}$) that is inversely proportional to the gas fraction times the\ncircular velocity. At low gas fractions, the star formation rate needed for\nlocal self-regulation, and corresponding turbulent Mach number, decline\nrapidly; the ISM is 'smoother', and it is actually more difficult to drive\nwinds with large mass-loading factors. Crucially, our model predicts that\nstellar-feedback-driven outflows should be suppressed at $z \\lesssim 1$ in\n$M_{\\star} \\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ galaxies. This mechanism allows massive\ngalaxies to exhibit violent outflows at high redshifts and then 'shut down'\nthose outflows at late times, thereby enabling the formation of a smooth,\nextended thin stellar disk. We provide simple fitting functions for $\\eta$ that\nshould be useful for sub-resolution and semi-analytic models. [abridged] \n\n"}

Motivation, methodology\n  and first results from SALT Abstract: The black holes (BH) in merging BH-BH binaries are likely progeny of binary O\nstars. Their properties, including their spins, will be strongly influenced by\nthe evolution of their progenitor O stars. The remarkable observation that many\nsingle O stars spin very rapidly can be explained if they accreted angular\nmomentum from a mass-transferring, O-type or Wolf-Rayet companion before that\nstar blew up as a supernova. To test this prediction, we have measured the spin\nrates of eight O stars in Wolf-Rayet (WR) + O binaries, increasing the total\nsample size of such O stars' measured spins from two to ten. Polarimetric and\nother determinations of these systems' sin i allow us to determine an average\nequatorial rotation velocity from HeI (HeII) lines of $v_e$ = 348 (173) km/s\nfor these O stars, with individual star's $v_e$ from HeI (HeII) lines ranging\nfrom 482 (237) to 290 (91) km/s. We argue that the $\\sim$ 100\\% difference\nbetween HeI and HeII speeds is due to gravity darkening. Super-synchronous\nspins, now observed in all 10 O stars in WR + O binaries where it has been\nmeasured, are strong observational evidence that Roche lobe overflow mass\ntransfer from a WR progenitor companion has played a critical role in the\nevolution of WR+OB binaries. While theory predicts that this mass transfer\nrapidly spins-up the O-type mass gainer to a nearly break-up rotational\nvelocity $v_e \\sim 530 $ km/s, the observed average $v_e$ of the O-type stars\nin our sample is 65\\% that speed. This demonstrates that, even over the\nrelatively short WR-phase timescale, tidal and/or other effects causing\nrotational spin-down must be efficient. A challenge to tidal synchronization\ntheory is that the two longest-period binaries in our sample (with periods of\n29.7 and 78.5 days) unexpectedly display super-synchronous rotation. \n\n"}

In\ncontrast, the expected change to the flux ratio caused by line-of-sight\nstructures is typically $\\sim 10$ percent and the mean of the convergence\nperturbation is $0.008$, corresponding to $0.017$. The contribution of\nmagnification perturbation caused by subhaloes is $\\sim 40$ percent of the\ntotal at a source redshift $z_S= 0.7$ and decreases monotonically in $z_S$ to\n$\\sim 20$ percent at $z_S= 3.6$.

We\nformulate our model as the Wasserstein gradient flow of an interaction energy,\nwith a penalization to enforce the constraint on the height of the density.\nFrom this perspective, the problem can be seen as a singular limit of the\nKeller-Segel equation with degenerate diffusion. Two key properties distinguish\nour problem from previous work on height constrained equations: nonconvexity of\nthe interaction kernel (which places the model outside the scope of classical\ngradient flow theory) and nonlocal dependence of the velocity field on the\ndensity (which causes the problem to lack a comparison principle).

Galaxies were therein\nseparated from stars and quasars through colour cuts, which may leave\nimperfections because of mixing different source types which overlap in colour\nspace. The aim of the present work is to identify galaxies in the\nWISExSuperCOSMOS catalogue through an alternative approach of machine learning.\nThis allows us to define more complex separations in the multi-colour space\nthan possible with simple colour cuts, and should provide more reliable source\nclassification. For the automatised classification we use the support vector\nmachines learning algorithm, employing SDSS spectroscopic sources cross-matched\nwith WISExSuperCOSMOS as the training and verification set. We perform a number\nof tests to examine the behaviour of the classifier (completeness, purity and\naccuracy) as a function of source apparent magnitude and Galactic latitude. We\nthen apply the classifier to the full-sky data and analyse the resulting\ncatalogue of candidate galaxies. We also compare thus produced dataset with the\none presented in B16. The tests indicate very high accuracy, completeness and\npurity (>95%) of the classifier at the bright end, deteriorating for the\nfaintest sources, but still retaining acceptable levels of 85%. No significant\nvariation of classification quality with Galactic latitude is observed.\nApplication of the classifier to all-sky WISExSuperCOSMOS data gives 15 million\ngalaxies after masking problematic areas.

Stress buildup\nand yielding in a magnetar crust is a global phenomenon: an elastic distortion\nradiating from one plastically deforming zone is shown to dramatically increase\nthe creep rate in distant zones. Runaway creep to dynamical rates is shown to\nbe possible, being enhanced by in situ heating and suppressed by thermal\nconduction and shearing of an embedded magnetic field. A global and\ntime-dependent model of elastic, plastic, magnetic, and thermal evolution is\ndeveloped. Fault-like structures develop naturally, and a range of outburst\ntimescales is observed. Transient events with time profiles similar to giant\nmagnetar flares (millisecond rise, $\\sim$ 0.1 s duration, and decaying\npower-law tails) result from runaway creep that starts in localized\nsub-km-sized patches and spreads across the crust. A one-dimensional model of\nstress relaxation in the vertically stratified crust shows that a modest\nincrease in applied stress allows embedded magnetic shear to escape the star\nover $\\sim$ 3-10 ms, dissipating greater energy if the exterior field is\nalready sheared. Several such zones coupled to each other naturally yield a\nburst of duration $\\sim$ 0.1 s, as is observed over a wide range of burst\nenergies.

Here we show how the E- and B-mode powers depend on the\ndetailed properties of the fluctuations in the magnetized interstellar medium.\nThese fluctuations are classified into the slow, fast, and Alfv\\'en\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, which are determined once the ratio of gas to\nmagnetic-field pressures is specified.

The observed power-law index for temperature/polarization\nfluctuations also disfavors MHD turbulence. We thus speculate that the 0.1--30\npc length scales probed by these dust-polarization measurements are not\ndescribed by MHD turbulence but, rather, probe the large-scale physics that\ndrives ISM turbulence.

Motivated by the evidence for powerful\nradiative shocks within nova outflows, we propose that dust formation occurs\nwithin the cool, dense shell behind these shocks. We incorporate a simple\nmolecular chemistry network and classical nucleation theory with a model for\nthe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas, in order to demonstrate the\nformation of both carbon and forsterite ($\\rm Mg_2SiO_4$) grains. The high\ndensities due to radiative shock compression ($n \\sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$)\nresult in CO saturation and rapid dust nucleation. Grains grow efficiently to\nlarge sizes $\\gtrsim 0.1\\mu$m, in agreement with IR observations of\ndust-producing novae, and with total dust masses sufficient to explain massive\nextinction events such as V705 Cas. As in dense stellar winds, dust formation\nis CO-regulated, with carbon-rich flows producing carbon-rich grains and\noxygen-rich flows primarily forming silicates. CO is destroyed by non-thermal\nparticles accelerated at the shock, allowing additional grain formation at late\ntimes, but the efficiency of this process appears to be low.

Our\nhydrodynamic calculations allow for a precise evaluation of logarithmic\nderivatives. For scale-free initial conditions, entropy is a power law in\nLagrangian (mass) coordinates, but not in Eulerian (radial) coordinates. The\ndeviation from a radial power law arises from incomplete hydrostatic\nequilibrium (HSE), linked to bulk inflow and mass accretion, and the\nconvergence to the asymptotic central power-law slope is very slow. For more\nrealistic collapse, entropy is not a power law with either radius or mass due\nto deviations from HSE and scale-dependent initial conditions. Instead, it is a\nslowly rolling power law that appears approximately linear on a log-log plot.\nOur fluid calculations recover PPSD power-law slopes and residual amplitudes\nsimilar to N-body simulations, indicating that deviations from a power law are\nnot numerical artefacts.

The lack of symmetry, however, indicates that such\ndegeneracy might be lifted by higher order corrections. \n\n"}

Besides using the angular momentum of the 15 solar-mass model\nas obtained in the stellar evolution calculation with an angular frequency of\nabout 0.001 rad/s (spin period of more than 6000 s) at the Si/Si-O interface,\nwe also computed 2D and 3D cases with no rotation and with a ~300 times shorter\nrotation period and different angular resolutions. In 2D, only the nonrotating\nand slowly rotating models explode, while rapid rotation prevents an explosion\nwithin 500 ms after bounce because of lower radiated neutrino luminosities and\nmean energies and thus reduced neutrino heating. In contrast, only the fast\nrotating model develops an explosion in 3D when the Si/Si-O interface collapses\nthrough the shock.

We analyse bolometric and NIR lightcurves of the first detected double\nneutron star merger and compare them to nuclear reaction network-based\nmacronova models. The slope of the bolometric lightcurve is consistent with the\nradioactive decay of neutron star ejecta with $Y_e \\lesssim 0.3$ (but not\nlarger), which provides strong evidence for an r-process origin of the\nelectromagnetic emission. This rules out in particular \"nickel winds\" as major\nsource of the emission. We find that the NIR lightcurves can be well fitted\neither with or without lanthanide-rich ejecta. Our limits on the ejecta mass\ntogether with estimated rates directly confirm earlier purely theoretical or\nindirect observational conclusions that double neutron star mergers are indeed\na major site of cosmic nucleosynthesis.

The latter measures the relative contribution of\nPAH molecules to the LIR. We used this library to model star-forming galaxies\nat 0.5<z<4 in the CANDELS fields, using both individual detections and stacks\nof Herschel and ALMA imaging, and extending this sample to z=0 using the\nHerschel Reference Survey. At first order, the dust SED of a galaxy was found\nindependent of stellar mass, but evolving with redshift. We found trends of\nincreasing Tdust and IR8 with redshift and distance from the SFR--Mstar main\nsequence (MS), and quantified for the first time their intrinsic scatter. Half\nof the observed variation of these parameters was captured by these empirical\nrelations, with residual scatters of 12% and 0.18 dex, respectively.

Global mm-VLBI\nArray (GMVA) observations at 86 GHz ($\\lambda=3.5\\,$mm) provide an angular\nresolution of $\\sim50\\mu$as, which corresponds to a spatial resolution of only\n$7~R_{\\rm sch}$ and reach the small spatial scale. We use five GMVA data sets\nof M87 obtained during 2004--2015 and present new high angular resolution VLBI\nmaps at 86GHz. In particular, we focus on the analysis of the brightness\ntemperature, the jet ridge lines, and the jet to counter-jet ratio. The imaging\nreveals a parabolically expanding limb-brightened jet which emanates from a\nresolved VLBI core of $\\sim(8-13) R_{\\rm sch}$ size. The observed brightness\ntemperature of the core at any epoch is $\\sim(1-3)\\times10^{10}\\,$K, which is\nbelow the equipartition brightness temperature and suggests magnetic energy\ndominance at the jet base. We estimate the diameter of the jet at its base to\nbe $\\sim5 R_{\\rm sch}$ assuming a self-similar jet structure.

The image stacking reveals faint emission at the center of the\nedge-brightened jet on sub-pc scales. We discuss its physical implication\nwithin the context of the spine-sheath structure of the jet. \n\n"}

Model galaxies at $z \\sim 3$ have star formation rates, half-light\nradii, I-K colours, and internal velocity dispersions that are in good\nagreement with the data. Global quantities such as the star formation rate\ndensity and cold gas and metal content of the Universe as a function of\nredshift also agree well. Two ``quiescent'' models without starbursts are also\ninvestigated. In one, the star formation efficiency in galaxies remains\nconstant with redshift, while in the other, it scales inversely with disc\ndynamical time, and thus increases rapidly with redshift. The first quiescent\nmodel is strongly ruled out as it does not produce enough high redshift\ngalaxies once realistic dust extinction is accounted for. The second quiescent\nmodel fits marginally, but underproduces cold gas and very bright galaxies at\nhigh redshift. A general conclusion is that star formation at high redshift\nmust be more efficient than locally. The collisional starburst model appears to\naccomplish this naturally without violating other observational constraints. \n\n"}

The extended mixing is\ntreated time-dependently, and the efficiency declines exponentially with the\ngeometric distance from the convective boundary. It has been considered at all\nconvective boundaries, including the He-flash convection zone in the intershell\nregion which forms during the thermal pulses. Both the structural and the\nchemical evolution are affected by the inclusion of overshoot. The main results\ninclude a very efficient third dredge-up which leads to the formation of carbon\nstars of low mass and luminosity. A C13 pocket which may serve as a neutron\nsource for the s-process can form after the third dredge-up has reached into\nthe C12 rich intershell.

In the model, the M_bh - sigma relation is significantly tighter than\nthe correlation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity or the correlation\nbetween bulge luminosity and velocity dispersion. There are two reasons for\nthis: i) the gas masses of bulge progenitors depend on the velocity dispersion\nbut not on the formation epoch of the bulge, whereas the stellar masses of the\nprogenitors depend on both; ii) mergers between galaxies move black holes along\nthe observed M_bh - sigma relation, even at late times when the galaxies are\ngas-poor and black holes grow mainly by merging of pre-existing black holes.

This is due to the projection\neffects inherent in catalogues of clusters constructed using 2 dimensional\ndata. Many of the clusters found in 2d have no significant 3d counterparts, and\nmost suffer from massive background contamination that cannot be corrected for\nby subtracting random offset fields.

The highly-ionized Fe emission, previously\nattributed to the diffuse emission, is found largely due to the discrete X-ray\nsource population. The number and spectrum of such sources indicate the\npresence of numerous accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars, and/or black holes\nin the region. The diffuse X-ray emission dominates over the contribution from\nthe faint discrete sources and is shown to be associated with distinct\ninterstellar structures observed at radio and mid-infrared wavelengths,\nsuggesting that it arises from the recent formation of massive stars. We have\nalso mapped out the 6.4-keV fluorescence line emission from neutral to\nmoderately ionized irons. The ubiquitous association of the emission with\nmolecular gas indicates that either the X-ray radiation from the Galactic\ncenter was substantially more intense in the past than at present or\nnon-relativistic cosmic-rays are important in producing Fe K shell vacancies. \n\n"}

Abstract: Nearby galactic nuclei are observed to be very much dimmer than active\ngalactic nuclei in distant galaxies. The Chandra X-ray Observatory has provided\na definitive explanation for why this is so. With its excellent angular\nresolution, Chandra has imaged hot X-ray-emitting gas close to the\ngravitational capture radius of a handful of supermassive black holes,\nincluding Sgr A* in the nucleus of our own Galaxy. These observations provide\ndirect and reliable estimates of the Bondi mass accretion rate in these nuclei.\nIt is found that the Bondi accretion rate is significantly below the Eddington\nmass accretion rate, but this alone does not explain the dimness of the\naccretion flows. In all the systems observed so far, the accretion luminosity\nis orders of magnitude less than Mdot_{Bondi} times c^2, which means that the\naccretion must occur via a radiatively inefficient mode. This conclusion, which\nwas strongly suspected for many years, is now inescapable. Furthermore, if the\naccretion in these nuclei occurs via either a Bondi flow or an\nadvection-dominated accretion flow, the accreting plasma must be\ntwo-temperature at small radii, and the central mass must have an event\nhorizon. Convection, winds and jets may play a role, but observations do not\nyet permit definite conclusions. \n\n"}

The particular\nquestion is whether the combined action of a (stable) vertical density\nstratification and a (stable) radial differential rotation gives rise to a new\ninstability for nonaxisymmetric modes of disturbances. The existence of such an\ninstability is not suggested by the well-known Solberg-Hoiland criterion. It is\nalso not suggested by a local analysis for disturbances in general\nstratifications of entropy and angular momentum which is presented in our\nSection 2 confirming the results of the Solberg-Hoiland criterion also for\nnonaxisymmetric modes within the frame of ideal hydrodynamics but only in the\nframe of a short-wave approximation for small m. As a necessary condition for\nstability we find that only conservative external forces are allowed to\ninfluence the stable disk. As magnetic forces are never conservative, linear\ndisk instabilities should only exist in the magnetohydrodynamical regime which\nindeed contains the magnetorotational instability as a much-promising\ncandidate. To overcome some of the used approximations in a numerical\napproach,the equations of the compressible adiabatic hydrodynamics are\nintegrated imposing initial nonaxisymmetric velocity perturbations with m=1 to\nm=200.\n  Only solutions with decaying kinetic energy are found.

We find\nthat even quite fast jets (gamma~10) can be significantly influenced by\nimpinging on an oblique density gradient, exhibiting a rotation of the Mach\ndisk in the jet's head. The flow is bent via a potentially strong, oblique\ninternal shock that arises due to asymmetric perturbation of the flow by its\ncocoon.

Recent observations\nsuggest that radio emitting electrons are presently accelerated rather than\nhaving been injected at early stages of the plerion evolution. The observed\nflat spectra without a low frequency cutoff imply an acceleration mechanism\nthat raises the average particle energy by few orders of magnitude but leaves\nmost of the particles at the energy less than about few hundred MeV. It is\nsuggested that annihilation of the alternating magnetic field at the pulsar\nwind termination shock provides the necessary mechanism. Toroidal stripes of\nopposite magnetic polarity are formed in the wind emanated from an obliquely\nrotating pulsar magnetosphere (the striped wind). At the termination shock, the\nflow is compressed and the magnetic field annihilates by driven reconnection.\nJump conditions are obtained for the shock in a striped wind. It is shown that\npostshock MHD parameters of the flow are the same as if the energy of\nalternating field has already been converted into the plasma energy upstream\nthe shock. Therefore the available estimates of the ratio of the Poynting flux\nto the matter energy flux, $\\sigma$, should be attributed not to the total\nupstream Poynting flux but only to that associated with the average magnetic\nfield.

We explore possible\nconnections between the two problems by studying the gravitational scattering\neffects due to subhalos on the phase-space distribution of dark matter\nparticles in the main halos. Our series of controlled numerical experiments\nindicates that the number and mass density of subhalos can be high enough to\ncause the collisionless dark matter particles in the inner part of a main halo\nto diffuse, flattening the main halo's inner cusp within a few dynamical times.\nDepending on the masses and concentration of the subhalos, the inner density\nprofile of the whole system (main plus sub halos) can either steepen or\nflatten.

Abstract: We study regenerated high-energy emission from the gamma-ray burst (GRB)\nafterglows, and compare its flux with the direct component from the same\nafterglow. When the intrinsic emission spectrum extends to TeV region, these\nvery high-energy photons are significantly absorbed by the cosmic infrared\nbackground (CIB) radiation field, creating electron/positron pairs; since these\npairs are highly energetic, they can scatter the cosmic microwave background\nradiation up to GeV energies, which may change the intrinsic afterglow light\ncurve in the GeV region.

We focus on bound matter inside the initial pressure maximum, where the\ntime-averaged motion of gas is inward and an accretion disk forms. We use the\nflows of mass, angular momentum, and energy in order to understand dynamics in\nthis region. The sharp reduction in accretion rate with increasing black hole\nspin reported in Paper I of this series is explained by a strongly\nspin-dependent outward flux of angular momentum conveyed electromagnetically;\nwhen a/M > 0.9, this flux can be comparable to the inward angular momentum flux\ncarried by the matter. In all cases, there is outward electromagnetic angular\nmomentum flux throughout the flow; in other words, contrary to the assertions\nof traditional accretion disk theory, there is in general no \"stress edge\", no\nsurface within which the stress is zero. The retardation of accretion in the\ninner disk by electromagnetic torques also alters the radial distribution of\nsurface density, an effect that may have consequences for observable properties\nsuch as Compton reflection. The net accreted angular momentum is sufficiently\ndepressed by electromagnetic effects that in the most rapidly-spinning black\nholes mass growth can lead to spindown. Spinning black holes also lose energy\nby Poynting flux; this rate is also a strongly increasing function of black\nhole spin, rising to 10% or more of the rest-mass accretion rate at very high\nspin.

Our analysis shows that the 2002\noutburst of V838 Mon consisted of two major phases: pre-eruption which was\nobserved in January 2002 and a major outburst, called eruption, which started\nin the beginning of February 2002. During pre-eruption the object seemed to be\nrelaxing after an initial event which had presumably taken place in last days\nof December 2001. The eruption phase, which lasted till mid-April 2002,\nresulted from a very strong energy burst, which presumably took place in last\ndays of January at the base of the stellar envelope inflated in pre-eruption.\nThe burst produced an energy wave, which was observed as a strong luminosity\nflash in the beginning of February, followed by a strong mass outflow in form\nof two shells, which was observed as an expanding photosphere in later epochs.\nIn mid-April, when the outflow became optically transparent and most of its\nenergy radiated away, the object entered the decline phase during which V838\nMon was evolving along the Hayashi track.

Our\nresults are in excellent agreement with measurements of the spatial\ndistribution of quasars, and we detect an intriguing excess of galaxy-quasar\npairs at very short separations. We also reproduce the anti-hierarchical\nturnoff in the quasar luminosity function, however, the magnitude of the\nturn-off falls short of that observed as well as that predicted by analogous\nsemi-analytic models.

The\nobserved properties of the single burst detected differ significantly from\nthose measured previously, suggesting that GCRT J1745-3009 was detected in a\nnew physical state. The 2004 flux density was ~0.05 Jy, ~10x weaker than the\nsingle 2003 burst and ~30x weaker than the five bursts detected in 2002. We\nderive a very steep spectral index, alpha = -13.5 +/- 3.0, across the bandpass,\na new result previously not detectable due to limitations in the analysis of\nthe 2002 and 2003 observations. Also, the burst was detected for only ~2 min.,\nin contrast to the 10 min. duration observed in the earlier bursts. Due to\nsparse sampling, only the single burst was detected in 2004, as in the 2003\nepoch, and we cannot rule out additional undetected bursts that may have\noccurred with the same ~77 min. periodicity observed in 2002 or with a\ndifferent periodicity. Considering our total time on source throughout both our\narchival and active monitoring campaigns, we estimate the source exhibits\ndetectable bursting activity ~7% of the time. \n\n"}

These data allow us\nto investigate the physics of the highly relativistic fireball outflow and its\ninteraction with the circumburst environment.

Unexpectedly, they are characterised by\ndifferent slopes, with a very steep decay in the first few hundred of seconds,\nfollowed by a flatter decay and, a few thousand of seconds later, by a somewhat\nsteeper decay. Often strong flare activity up to few hours after the burst\nexplosion is also seen. These flares, most likely, are still related to the\ncentral engine activity, that last much longer than expected and it is still\ndominating the X-ray light curve well after the prompt phase, up to a few\nthousand of seconds. The real afterglow emission (external shock) is dominating\nthe X-ray light curve only after the flatter phase ends. The flatter phase is\nprobably the combination of late-prompt emission and afterglow emission. When\nthe late-prompt emission ends the light curve steepens again.

This event, originating from a Galactic\nneutron star, displayed exceptional energetics. Recent investigations of the\nX-ray light curve's pulsating tail revealed the presence of Quasi-Periodic\nOscillations (QPOs) in the 30 - 2000 Hz frequency range, most of which\ncoincides with the bandwidth of the LIGO detectors.

Our search targeted potential\nquasi-monochromatic GWs lasting for tens of seconds and emitted at the QPO\nfrequencies. We have observed no candidate signals above a pre-determined\nthreshold and our lowest upper limit was set by the 92.5 Hz QPO observed in the\ninterval from 150 s to 260 s after the start of the flare.

These are\nstrong non-axisymmetric features which significantly affect orbits of stars and\ndark matter particles. One of the main effects is the dynamical resonances\nbetween galactic material and the bar. We detect and characterize these\nresonances in N-body models of barred galaxies by measuring angular and radial\nfrequencies of individual orbits. We found narrow peaks in the distribution of\norbital frequencies with each peak corresponding to a specific resonance. We\nfound five different resonances in the stellar disk and two in the dark matter.\nThe corotation resonance and the inner and outer Lindblad resonances are the\nmost populated. The spatial distributions of particles near resonances are\nwide. For example, the inner Lindblad resonance is not localized at a given\nradius. Particles near this resonance are mainly distributed along the bar and\nspan a wide range of radii. On the other hand, particles near the corotation\nresonance are distributed in two broad areas around the two stable Lagrange\npoints. The distribution resembles a wide ring at the corotation radius.\nResonances capture disk and halo material in near-resonant orbits. Our analysis\nof orbits in both N-body simulations and in simple analytical models indicates\nthat resonances tend to prevent the dynamical evolution of this trapped\nmaterial. Only if the bar evolves as a whole, resonances drift through the\nphase space. In this case particles anchored near resonant orbits track the\nresonance shift and evolve. The criteria to ensure a correct resonant behavior\ndiscussed in Weinberg & Katz (2007a) can be achieved with few millions\nparticles because the regions of trapped orbits near resonances are large and\nevolving. \n\n"}

We\ninvestigate the possibility that the expansion rate within this region is\nsystematically higher than the true expansion rate due to the presence of a\nlocal, large underdense region or void. We begin by calculating the expected\ndeviations between the locally measured Hubble constant and the true Hubble\nconstant for a variety of models.

We study the evolution of strain in\nthe crust, the initiation of starquakes, and possible consequences for magnetic\nfield and torque evolution.

The U and B light curves display an ellipsoidal modulation with\namplitudes of about 0.02 magnitudes. The sdB star contributes nearly all of the\nobserved flux.
