The bulk turns out to be nearly supersymmetric since the\nscale of the gravitino mass is of the order of the observed value of the\ncosmological constant. The quintessence field is a modulus parameterising the\nsize of an internal four-cycle which naturally develops a potential of the\norder (gravitino mass)^4, leading to a small dark energy scale without tunings.\nThe mass of the quintessence field is also radiatively stable since it is\nprotected by supersymmetry in the bulk. Moreover, this light scalar couples to\nordinary matter via its mixing with the volume mode. Due to the fact that the\nquintessence field is a flat direction at leading order, this mixing is very\nsmall, resulting in a suppressed coupling to Standard Model particles which\navoids stringent fifth-force constraints.

The axion is linear in the time\ncoordinate of the Einstein frame and gives rise to a constant torsion which\ncouples to the fermion spin through a gravitational covariant derivative. This\nleads to different energy-momentum dispersion relations for fermions and\nanti-fermions and hence leptogenesis. The next two backgrounds go beyond the\nlocal effective lagrangian framework. One is a stochastic (Lorentz Violating)\nFinsler metric which again leads to different dispersion relations between\nfermions and antifermions. The third background of primary interest is the one\ndue to populations of stochastically fluctuating point-like space-time defects\nthat can be encountered in string/brane theory (D0 branes). Only neutral matter\ninteracts non-trivially with these defects, as a consequence of charge\nconservation. Hence, such a background singles out neutrinos among the Standard\nModel excitations as the ones interacting predominantly with the defects.

The two-point function is characterised by different power on\nlarge and small scales, and a burst of small amplitude superimposed\noscillations in between. Motivated by string-theory models with stuck branes,\nwe extend this analysis to Dirac Born Infeld (DBI) inflation, for which\ngeneralised slow-roll is violated at the discontinuity and a rapid variation in\nthe speed of sound c_s occurs. In an attempt to characterise the effect of\nnon-linear kinetic terms on the oscillatory features of the primordial\npower-spectrum, we show that the resulting power spectrum has a shape and\nfeatures which differ significantly from those of the standard Starobinsky\nmodel.

Our\narguments are based on nearly-resonant interactions of the R mode with pairs of\n\"daughter modes\". The amplitude of the R mode saturates at the lowest value for\nwhich parametric instability leads to significant excitation of a particular\npair of daughters. The lower bound on this limiting amplitude is proportional\nto the damping rate of the daughter modes that are excited parametrically.\nBased on this picture, we show that if modes damp because of dissipation in a\nvery thin boundary layer at the crust-core boundary then spin up to frequencies\nlarger than about 300 Hz does not occur. Within this conventional scenario the\nR mode saturates at an amplitude that is too large for angular momentum gain\nfrom accretion to overcome gravitational loss to gravitational radiation. We\nconclude that lower dissipation is required for spin up to frequencies much\nhigher than 300 Hz. We conjecture that if the transition from the fluid core to\nthe crystalline crust occurs over a distance much longer than 1 cm then a sharp\nviscous boundary layer fails to form. In this case, damping is due to shear\nviscosity dissipation integrated over the entire star; the rate is slower than\nif a viscous boundary layer forms. We use statistical arguments and scaling\nrelations to estimate the lowest parametric instability threshold from first\nprinciples. The resulting saturation amplitudes are low enough to permit spin\nup to higher frequencies. Further, we show that the requirement that the lowest\nparametric instability amplitude be small enough to allow continued spin up\nimposes an upper bound to the frequencies that may be attained via accretion\nthat may plausibly be about 750 Hz. Within this framework, the R mode is\nunstable for all millisecond pulsars, whether accreting or not. \n\n"}

In this paper to proceed\nfurther with the investigation on the potentialities, difficulties and\nlimitations of $f(R)$ gravity, we examine the question as to whether the future\ndynamics can be used to break the degeneracy between $f(R)$ gravity theories by\ninvestigating the future dynamics of spatially homogeneous and isotropic dust\nflat models in two $f(R)$ gravity theories, namely the well known $f(R) = R +\n\\alpha R^{n}$ gravity and another by A.

Attention to the gauge generator G\nof Rosenfeld, Anderson, Bergmann, Castellani et al., a specially tuned sum of\nfirst-class constraints, facilitates seeing that a solitary first-class\nconstraint in fact generates not a gauge transformation, but a bad physical\nchange in electromagnetism (changing E) or GR. The change spoils the Lagrangian\nconstraints in terms of the physically relevant velocities rather than\nauxiliary canonical momenta. While Maudlin has defended change in GR much as G.\nE. Moore resisted skepticism, there remains a need to exhibit the technical\nflaws in the argument.\n  Insistence on Hamiltonian-Lagrangian equivalence, a theme emphasized by\nMukunda, Castellani, Sugano, Pons, Salisbury, Shepley and Sundermeyer among\nothers, holds the key. Taking objective change to be ineliminable time\ndependence, there is change in vacuum GR just in case there is no time-like\nvector field satisfying Killing's equation. Throwing away the spatial\ndependence of GR for convenience, one finds that the time evolution from\nHamilton's equations is real change just when there is no time-like Killing\nvector. Hence change is real and local even in the Hamiltonian formalism.\n  The considerations here resolve the Earman-Maudlin standoff: the Hamiltonian\nformalism is helpful, and, suitably reformed, it does not have absurd\nconsequences for change. Hence the classical problem of time is resolved, apart\nfrom the issue of observables, for which the solution is outlined.

The Effective Field\nTheory of LSS (EFTofLSS) is a novel theoretical framework that aims to develop\nan analytic understanding of LSS at long distances, where inhomogeneities are\nsmall. We further develop the description of biased tracers in the EFTofLSS to\naccount for the effect of baryonic physics and primordial non-Gaussianities,\nfinding that new bias coefficients are required.

Each of the standard scenarios proposed, involving rapid\naccretion of seed black holes or black hole mergers, faces severe theoretical\ndifficulties in explaining the short-time formation of supermassive objects. In\nthis work we propose an alternative scenario for the formation of SMBH in the\nearly Universe, in which energy transfer from superconducting cosmic strings\npiercing small seed black holes is the main physical process leading to rapid\nmass increase. As a toy model, the accretion rate of a seed black hole pierced\nby two antipodal strings carrying constant current is considered. Using an\neffective action approach, which phenomenologically incorporates a large class\nof superconducting string models, we estimate the minimum current required to\nform SMBH with masses of order $M = 2 \\times 10^{9}M_{\\odot}$ by $z = 7.085$.\nThis corresponds to the mass of the central black hole powering the quasar ULAS\nJ112001.48+064124.3 and is taken as a test case scenario for early-epoch SMBH\nformation. For GUT scale strings, the required fractional increase in the\nstring energy density, due to the presence of the current, is of order\n$10^{-7}$, so that their existence remains consistent with current\nobservational bounds on the string tension. In addition, we consider an\n\"exotic\" scenario, in which an SMBH is generated when a small seed black hole\nis pierced by a higher-dimensional $F-$string, predicted by string theory.

One such set of relations determines all of the multipole moments of a\nneutron star just from the first three (the mass monopole, the current dipole\nand the mass quadrupole moment) approximately independently of the equation of\nstate.

Within\nsuch a simple scenario, inflation gracefully exits when the GR regime is\nrecovered, but the Universe would remain matter dominated. In order to\nimplement a reheating era after inflation, we then consider inflation to be\ndriven by a mixture of unstable dust species decaying into radiation. Because\nthe speed of sound gravitates within the Born-Infeld model under consideration,\nour scenario ends up being predictive on various open questions of the\ninflationary paradigm. The total number of e-folds of acceleration is given by\nthe lifetime of the unstable dust components and is related to the duration of\nreheating. As a result, inflation does not last much longer than the number of\ne-folds of deceleration allowing a small spatial curvature and large scale\ndeviations to isotropy to be observable today.

However, the\ngravitational-wave signal emitted by an inspiraling binary neutron star system\nis only weakly dependent on the equation of state and extracting this\ninformation is challenging. Previous studies have focused mainly on binary\nsystems where the neutron stars are spinning slowly and the main imprint of\nneutron star matter in the inspiral signal is due to tidal effects. For\nbinaries with non-negligible neutron-star spin the deformation of the neutron\nstar due to its own rotation introduces additional variations in the emitted\ngravitational-wave signal. Here we explore whether highly spinning binary\nneutron-star systems offer a better chance to measure the equation-of-state\nthan weakly spinning binary-neutron star systems. We focus on the dominant\nadiabatic quadrupolar effects and consider three main questions. First, we show\nthat equation-of-state effects can be significant in the inspiral waveforms,\nand that the spin-quadrupole effect dominates for rapidly rotating neutron\nstars. Second, we show that variations in the spin-quadrupole phasing are\nstrongly degenerate with changes in the component masses and spins, and\nneglecting these terms has a negligible impact on the number of observations\nwith second generation observatories. Finally, we explore the bias in the\nmasses and spins that would be introduced by using incorrect equation-of-state\nterms. Using a novel method to rapidly evaluate an approximation of the\nlikelihood we show that assuming the incorrect equation-of-state when measuring\nsource parameters can lead to a significant bias. We also find that the ability\nto measure the equation-of-state is improved when considering spinning systems. \n\n"}

An approximate Paczynski-Wiita pseudo-Newtonian potential is used.\nHydrodynamical disks are linearly unstable inside a radius which differs\nslightly from the classical R_ms value because of finite pressure and radial\nstratification effects. Linear stresses associated with unstable hydrodynamical\nmodes vanish exactly at the radius of marginal stability and are generally\npositive inside of that radius.

The resonant energy\ntransfer between the orbit and NS speeds up or slows down the inspiral and\ninduces a phase change in the emitted gravitational waves from the binary. A\ntidal resonance, (jk,m), occurs when the mode frequency equals m times the\norbital frequency. For f-mode resonance to occur before coalescence, the NS\nmust have rapid rotation, with spin frequency nu_s>710Hz for (22,2)-resonance\nand nu_s>570Hz for (33,3)-resonance (M=1.4Mo and R=10km; however, for R=15km,\nthese spin frequencies become 330Hz and 250Hz). Because of strong tidal\ncoupling, f-mode resonances induce a large change in the number of orbital\ncycles, N_orb, with maximum N_orb~10-1000 for (22,2)-resonance and N_orb~1 for\n(33,3)- resonance. Such resonant effects, if present, must be included in\nconstructing waveform templates used in searching for gravitational wave\nsignals. Higher order f-mode resonances can occur at slower rotation rates, but\nN_orb<0.1. For the dominant g-mode (22,2)-resonance, even modest rotation\n(nu_s<100Hz) can enhance the resonant effect on the orbit by shifting resonance\nto a smaller orbital frequency. However, because of the weak coupling, N_orb\nlies in the range 10^-3-10^-2 (depending on the NS EOS) and is probably\nnegligible for the purpose of detecting gravitational waves. R-mode resonances\nrequire misaligned spin-orbit inclinations, and the dominant resonances\ncorrespond to (22,3) and (22,1). Since tidal coupling depends strongly on\nrotation rate, N_orb<10^-2(R/10km)^(10)(M/1.4Mo)^(-20/3) is negligible for\ncanonical NS parameters but can be appreciable if the NS radius is larger. \n\n"}

The new Hubble function, defined by this law, has two\nadditional terms besides an expansion one, similar to the usual volume\nexpansion one of the FLRW models, but now due to an angular expansion.

As a by-product of using the covariant curvature tensor formalism, it is\nimmediately seen that the cosmological scalar, vector and tensor type\nperturbations all have the same Kaluza-Klein spectrum. On the other hand, if\nthere are two branes with positive and negative tensions, the gravity on each\nbrane takes corrections from the radion mode in addition to the Kaluza-Klein\nmodes and the radion is found to have a negative mass-squared proportional to\nthe curvature of the de Sitter brane, in contrast to the flat brane case in\nwhich the radion mass vanishes and degenerates with the 4-dimensional graviton\nmodes.

A metric tensor as well as a metric compatible connection is\ngenerated by a coframe in a unique manner. The Lagrangian is a general linear\ncombination of Weitzenb\\\"{o}ck's quadratic invariants with free dimensionless\nparameters $\\r_1,\\r_2,\\r_3$.\n  Every independent term of the Lagrangian is a global SO(1,3)-invariant\n4-form.

This, in turn, leads to the existence of observers (in any\nspace-time) who do not have access to regions of space-time bounded by\nhorizons. To take into account this generic possibility, it is necessary to\ndemand that \\emph{physical theories in a given coordinate system must be\nformulated entirely in terms of variables that an observer using that\ncoordinate system can access}. This principle is powerful enough to obtain the\nfollowing results: (a) The action principle of gravity must be of such a\nstructure that, in the semiclassical limit, the action of the unobserved\ndegrees of freedom reduces to a boundary contribution $A_{\\rm boundary}$\nobtained by integrating a four divergence. (b) When the boundary is a horizon,\n$A_{\\rm boundary}$ essentially reduces to a single, well-defined, term.

Each projector determines the projective\nmodule of finite type of sections of the corresponding `rank 1' supervector\nbundle over $S^{2,2}$. The canonical connection $\\nabla = p \\circ d$ is used to\ncompute the Chern numbers by means of the Berezin integral on $S^{2,2}$. The\nassociated connection 1-forms are graded extensions of monopoles with not\ntrivial topological charge. Supertransposed projectors gives opposite values\nfor the charges. We also comment on the $K$-theory of $S^{2,2}$. \n\n"}

In particular, we\nrecover for $l=3$ the non-rotating massive BTZ black hole. The method presented\nhere is very simple and in principle generalizable to any semi-simple symmetric\nspace. \n\n"}

As an\napplication, it is explained how the nonlinear Toda lattice and a discrete time\nversion of it can be understood as generalized sigma-models based on\nnoncommutative geometries. In particular, in this way one achieves a simple\nunderstanding of the complete integrability of the Toda lattice. Furthermore,\ngeneralized metric structures on finite sets and lattices are briefly\ndiscussed. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0404040", "contents": "Title: Quantum Quandaries: a Category-Theoretic Perspective Abstract: General relativity may seem very different from quantum theory, but work on\nquantum gravity has revealed a deep analogy between the two. General relativity\nmakes heavy use of the category nCob, whose objects are (n-1)-dimensional\nmanifolds representing \"space\" and whose morphisms are n-dimensional cobordisms\nrepresenting \"spacetime\". Quantum theory makes heavy use of the category Hilb,\nwhose objects are Hilbert spaces used to describe \"states\", and whose morphisms\nare bounded linear operators used to describe \"processes\". Moreover, the\ncategories nCob and Hilb resemble each other far more than either resembles\nSet, the category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are functions. In\nparticular, both Hilb and nCob but not Set are *-categories with a noncartesian\nmonoidal structure. We show how this accounts for many of the famously puzzling\nfeatures of quantum theory: the failure of local realism, the impossibility of\nduplicating quantum information, and so on. We argue that these features only\nseem puzzling when we try to treat Hilb as analogous to Set rather than nCob,\nso that quantum theory will make more sense when regarded as part of a theory\nof spacetime. \n\n"}

In particular, we offer an explicit construction\nof coherent states for both charged and neutral (real) free Klein-Gordon fields\nas well as for charged fields interacting with a constant magnetic field. Our\nconstruction is free from the problems associated with charge-superselection\nrule that complicated the previous studies.

{"id": "quant-ph/9902069", "contents": "Title: Royal Road to Coupling Classical and Quantum Dynamics Abstract: We present a consistent framework of coupled classical and quantum dynamics.\nOur result allows us to overcome severe limitations of previous\nphenomenological approaches, like evolutions that do not preserve the\npositivity of quantum states or that allow to activate quantum nonlocality for\nsuperluminal signaling. A `hybrid' quantum-classical density is introduced and\nits evolution equation derived. The implications and applications of our result\nare numerous: it incorporates the back-reaction of quantum on classical\nvariables, it resolves fundamental problems encountered in standard mean field\ntheories, and remarkably, also the quantum measurement process, i.e. the most\ncontroversial example of quantum-classical interaction is consistently\ndescribed within our approach, leading to a theory of dynamical collapse. \n\n"}
