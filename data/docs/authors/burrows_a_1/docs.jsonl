We focus on the dynamical role of MHD processes after the formation of a\nmillisecond-period protoneutron star. We find that including magnetic fields\nand stresses can lead to a powerful explosion with an energy of a few Bethe,\nrather than a weak one of at most 0.1 Bethe, with an associated ejecta mass of\n~0.1Msun, instead of a few 0.001Msun. The core is spun down by ~30% within\n500ms after bounce, and the rotational energy extracted from the core is\nchanneled into magnetic energy that generates a strong magnetically-driven\nwind, rather than a weak neutrino-driven wind. Baryon loading of the ejecta,\nwhile this wind prevails, precludes it from becoming relativistic. This\nsuggests that a GRB is not expected to emerge from such AICs during the early\nprotoneutron star phase, except in the unlikely event that the massive white\ndwarf has sufficient mass to lead to black hole formation. In addition, we\npredict both negligible 56Ni-production (that should result in an\noptically-dark, adiabatically-cooled explosion) and the ejection of 0.1Msun of\nmaterial with an electron fraction of 0.1-0.2.

We show how techniques\nproven useful for collective two-flavor neutrino oscillations such as\ncorotating frames can be applied readily to three-flavor mixing. Applying two\nsimple assumptions and the conservation of two ``lepton numbers'' we use this\nframework to demonstrate how the adiabatic/precession solution emerges. We\nillustrate with a numerical example how two stepwise spectral swaps appear\nnaturally if the flavor evolution of the neutrino gas can be described by such\na solution. For the special case where mu and tau flavor neutrinos are equally\nmixed and are produced with identical energy spectra and total numbers, we find\nthat one of the spectral swaps in the three-flavor scenario agrees with that in\nthe two-flavor scenario when appropriate mixing parameters are used.

The FP 'tilt' implies lower-mass ellipticals have a higher ratio\nof stellar to dark matter within their stellar effective radii. Models argue\nthat mergers between more gas-rich (typically lower-mass) disks yield larger\nmass fractions formed in compact starbursts, giving a smaller stellar R_e and\nhigher M_stellar/M_tot within that R_e. Such starbursts leave a characteristic\nimprint in the surface brightness profile: a central excess above an outer\nprofile established by the dissipationless violent relaxation of disk stars. In\nprevious work, we developed empirical methods to decompose the observed\nprofiles of ellipticals and robustly estimate the amount of dissipation in the\noriginal spheroid-forming merger(s). Applying this to a large sample of\nobserved ellipticals, we test whether or not their location on the FP and its\ntilt are driven by dissipation. At fixed mass, ellipticals formed in more\ndissipational events are smaller and have higher M_stellar/M_tot. At fixed\ndegree of dissipation, there is no tilt in the FP. We show that the dynamical\nmass estimator R_e*sigma^2/G is a good estimator of the true mass: the observed\nFP tilt cannot primarily owe to other forms of non-homology. Removing the\neffects of dissipation, observed ellipticals obey the same FP correlations as\ndisks: unusual progenitors are not required to make typical ellipticals.\nDissipation appears to be both necessary and sufficient to explain the FP tilt. \n\n"}

In this\npaper, based on the data from the UNLV GRB group web-site, we found an obvious\ncorrelation between the two quantities. In addition, we found that the\nsoftening process can be divided into two classes: the early type softening\n($t_{s,max}\\leq \"4000\"s$) and the late type softening ($t_{s,max} > \"4000\"s$).\nThe two types of softening show different behaviors in the duration vs.\nterminating time plot. In the relation between the variation rates of the flux\ndensity and spectral index during the softening process, a discrepancy between\nthe two types of softening is also observed. According to their time scales and\nthe discrepancy between them, we propose that the two types are of different\norigins: the early type is of internal shock origin and the late type is of\nexternal shock origin. The early softening is referred to the steep decay just\nfollowing the prompt emission, whereas the late decay typically conceives the\ntransition from flat decay to late afterglow decay. We suspect that there might\nbe a great difference of the Lorentz factor in two classes which is responsible\nfor the observed discrepancy. \n\n"}

The combination of a long time baseline and the\nexcellent astrometric accuracy of adaptive optics data allow us to determine\norbits of 28 stars, including the star S2, which has completed a full\nrevolution since our monitoring began.

The six-fluid (neutrals, electrons, molecular\nand atomic ions, positively-charged, negatively-charged, and neutral grains)\nphysical system is governed by the radiative, nonideal magnetohydrodynamic\n(RMHD) equations. The magnetic flux is not assumed to be frozen in any of the\ncharged species.

However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code.

Our\nsimulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in\nmean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's\nperturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed\nrate of MMRs.

The latter essentially characterizes the isospin dependence of the\nincompressibility at the saturation density and can be expressed as\n$K_{sat,2}=K_{sym}-6L-\\frac{J_{0}}{K_{0}}L$, Furthermore, we have constructed a\nphenomenological modified Skyrme-like (MSL) model which can reasonably describe\nthe general properties of symmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy\npredicted by both the MDI model and the SHF approach. The results indicate that\nthe high-order $J_{0}$ contribution to $K_{sat,2}$ generally cannot be\nneglected. In addition, it is found that there exists a nicely linear\ncorrelation between $K_{sym}$ and $L$ as well as between $J_{0}/K_{0}$ and\n$K_{0}$. These correlations together with the empirical constraints on $K_{0}$,\n$L$, $E_{sym}(\\rho_{0})$ and the nucleon effective mass lead to an estimate of\n$K_{sat,2}=-370\\pm 120$ MeV. \n\n"}

We investigate how upcoming astrophysical experiments will\nexplore the existence of such axions over a vast mass range from 10^-33eV to\n10^-10eV. Axions with masses between 10^-33eV to 10^-28eV cause a rotation of\nthe CMB polarization that is constant throughout the sky. The predicted\nrotation angle is of order \\alpha~1/137. Axions in the mass range 10^-28eV to\n10^-18eV give rise to multiple steps in the matter power spectrum, that will be\nprobed by upcoming galaxy surveys. Axions in the mass range 10^-22eV to\n10^-10eV affect the dynamics and gravitational wave emission of rapidly\nrotating astrophysical black holes through the Penrose superradiance process.\nWhen the axion Compton wavelength is of order of the black hole size, the\naxions develop \"superradiant\" atomic bound states around the black hole\n\"nucleus\". Their occupation number grows exponentially by extracting rotational\nenergy from the ergosphere, culminating in a rotating Bose-Einstein axion\ncondensate emitting gravitational waves. This mechanism creates mass gaps in\nthe spectrum of rapidly rotating black holes that diagnose the presence of\naxions. The rapidly rotating black hole in the X-ray binary LMC X-1 implies an\nupper limit on the decay constant of the QCD axion f_a<2*10^17GeV, much below\nthe Planck mass.

In this newly defined vacuum we construct the coincidence\nlimit of the propagator and as an example calculate the expectation value of\nthe stress energy tensor. We find that this approach gives both in the\nultraviolet and in the infrared satisfactory results. Moreover, we find that,\nunless the effective mass due to the coupling to the Ricci scalar $\\xi R$ is\nnegative, quantum contributions to the energy density always dilute away\nfaster, or just as fast, as the background energy density. Therefore, quantum\nbackreaction is insignificant at the one loop order, unless $\\xi R$ is\nnegative.

The relevant phases are prompt and steady-state convection, the\nstanding accretion shock instability (SASI), and asymmetric explosions. For the\nstages before explosion, we propose a model for the source of GW emission.\nDowndrafts of the postshock-convection/SASI region strike the protoneutron star\n\"surface\" with large speeds and are decelerated by buoyancy forces. We find\nthat the GW amplitude is set by the magnitude of deceleration and, by\nextension, the downdraft's speed and the vigor of postshock-convective/SASI\nmotions. However, the characteristic frequencies, which evolve from ~100 Hz\nafter bounce to ~300-400 Hz, are primarily independent of these speeds, but are\nset by the deceleration timescale, which is in turn set by the buoyancy\nfrequency at the lower boundary of postshock convection. Consequently, the GW\ncharacteristic frequencies are dependent upon a combination of core structure\nattributes, specifically the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) and details\nthat determine the gradients at the boundary, including the accretion-rate\nhistory, the EOS at subnuclear densities, and neutrino transport. During\nexplosion, the high frequency signal wanes and is replaced by a strong low\nfrequency, ~10s of Hz, signal that reveals the general morphology of the\nexplosion (i.e. prolate, oblate, or spherical). However, current and\nnear-future GW detectors are sensitive to GW power at frequencies >50 Hz.\nTherefore, the signature of explosion will be the abrupt reduction of\ndetectable GW emission. \n\n"}

The planetary radius is evolved\nself-consistently with orbital parameters, under the influence of tidal torques\nand tidal dissipation in the interior of the planet. A general feature of this\nmodel, which we have previously demonstrated in the generic case, is that a\npossible transient inflation of the planetary radius can temporarily interrupt\nits standard monotonic shrinking and can lead to the inflated radii that we\nobserve. In particular, a bloated planet with even a circular orbit may still\nbe inflated due to an earlier episode of tidal heating. We have modified our\nmodel to include an orbital period dependence of the tidal dissipation factor\nin the star, $Q'_{\\ast} \\propto P^{\\gamma}$, $-1 \\leqslant \\gamma \\leqslant 1$.\nWith this model, we search, for a tidally heated planet, orbital and radius\nevolutionary tracks that fall within the observational limits of the radius,\nthe semimajor axis, and the eccentricity of the planet in its current estimated\nage range.

We investigate the ability of this \"thermal tide\" to\nproduce a quadrupole moment which can couple to the stellar gravitational tidal\nforce. While previous investigations discussed planets with solid surfaces,\nhere we focus on entirely fluid planets in order to understand gas giants with\nsmall cores. The Coriolis force, thermal diffusion and self-gravity of the\nperturbations are ignored for simplicity. First, we examine the response to\nthermal forcing through analytic solutions of the fluid equations which treat\nthe forcing frequency as a small parameter. In the \"equilibrium tide\" limit of\nzero frequency, fluid motion is present but does not induce a quadrupole\nmoment.

In this work we assess the range of separations at which\nthe CI may operate by (1) allowing for arbitrary (physically meaningful) rate\nof planetesimal accretion by the core and (2) properly taking into account the\ndependence of the critical mass for the CI on the planetesimal accretion\nluminosity.

The moving hotspots are sandwiched between two shocks.

An\nouter-facing bow shock moves directly into the undisturbed group or cluster\ngas, creating a cocoon of shocked gas enclosing the radio lobe. We describe\ncomputations that follow the self-consistent dynamical evolution of the shocked\ncluster gas and the relativistic synchrotron-emitting gas inside the lobes.\nRelativistic and non-relativistic components exchange momentum by interacting\nwith small magnetic fields having dynamically negligible energy densities. The\nevolution of Cygnus A is governed almost entirely by cosmic ray energy flowing\nfrom the hotspots.

Carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter between\nstellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using a\nnovel and self-consistent theoretical framework. Our results provide strong\nconstraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass\nrelation (SHMR) from z=0.2 to z=1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass\nscales as Mh M*^0.46 and that this scaling does not evolve significantly with\nredshift to z=1. We show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh/M*, varies from low\nto high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh/M*~27 at M*=4.5x10^10 Msun and\nMh=1.2x10^12 Msun. This minimum is important for models of galaxy formation\nbecause it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the\ncentral galaxy has been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this\nminimum in terms of the \"pivot stellar mass\", M*piv, the \"pivot halo mass\",\nMhpiv, and the \"pivot ratio\", (Mh/M*)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous analysis of a\nsingle data set, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends for\nboth Mhpiv and M*piv. The pivot stellar mass decreases from\nM*piv=5.75+-0.13x10^10 Msun at z=0.88 to M*piv=3.55+-0.17x10^10 Msun at z=0.37.\nIntriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of Mhpiv leaves the pivot\nratio constant with redshift at (Mh/M*)piv~27.

The absorption of electron-type\nneutrinos below the radius of the stalled shockwave may drive explosions (the\n\"neutrino mechanism\"). Because the heating rate is proportional to the square\nof neutrino energy, flavor conversion of mu and tau neutrinos to electron-type\nneutrinos via collective neutrino oscillations (CnuO) may in principle increase\nthe heating rate and drive explosions. In order to assess the potential\nimportance of CnuO for the shock revival, we solve the steady-state boundary\nvalue problem of spherically-symmetric accretion between the PNS surface (r_nu)\nand the shock (r_S), including a scheme for flavor conversion via CnuO. For a\ngiven r_nu, PNS mass (M), accretion rate (Mdot), and assumed values of the\nneutrino energies from the PNS, we calculate the critical neutrino luminosity\nabove which accretion is impossible and explosion results. We show that CnuO\ncan decrease the critical luminosity by a factor of at most ~1.5, but only if\nthe flavor conversion is fully completed inside r_S and if there is no matter\nsuppression. The magnitude of the effect depends on the model parameters (M,\nMdot, and r_nu) through the shock radius and the physical scale for flavor\nconversion. We quantify these dependencies and find that CnuO could lower the\ncritical luminosity only for small M and Mdot, and large r_nu. However, for\nthese parameter values CnuO are suppressed due to matter effects. By\nquantifying the importance of CnuO and matter suppression at the critical\nneutrino luminosity for explosion, we show in agreement with previous studies\nthat CnuO are unlikely to affect the neutrino mechanism of core-collapse\nsupernovae significantly. \n\n"}

Supersonic motion, producing\na wake of spiral-onion shell structure, exhibits a single-armed Archimedes\nspiral and two-centered circular arcs with respect to the line of sight. The\npitch angle, arm width, and spacing of the spiral pattern are entirely\ndetermined by the orbital distance $r_p$ and Mach number of the object. The\narm-interarm density contrast is proportional to the Bondi accretion radius,\ndecreasing as a function of distance with a power index of -1. The background\ndensity distribution is globally changed from initially uniform to centrally\nconcentrated. The vertical structure of the wake is manifested as circular arcs\nwith the center at the object location. The angular extent of the arcs is\ndetermined by the Mach number of the object motion. Diagnostic probes of\nnonlinear wakes such as a detached bow shock, an absence of the definite inner\narm boundary, the presence of turbulent low density eddies, and elongated\nshapes of arcs are explained in the extension of the linear analysis.

Our results disagree with previous findings. While we also\nobserve that two-dimensional (2D) models explode for lower driving neutrino\nluminosity than spherically symmetric (1D) models, we do not find that\nexplosions in 3D occur easier and earlier than in 2D. Moreover, we find that\nthe average entropy of matter in the gain layer hardly depends on the dimension\nand thus is no good diagnostic quantity for the readiness to explode. Instead,\nmass, integrated entropy, total neutrino-heating rate, and nonradial kinetic\nenergy in the gain layer are higher when models are closer to explosion.\nCoherent, large-scale mass motions as typically associated with the standing\naccretion-shock instability (SASI) are observed to be supportive for explosions\nbecause they drive strong shock expansion and thus enlarge the gain layer.\nWhile 2D models with better angular resolution explode clearly more easily, the\nopposite trend is seen in 3D. We interpret this as a consequence of the\nturbulent energy cascade, which transports energy from small to large spatial\nscales in 2D, thus fostering SASI activity. In contrast, the energy flow in 3D\nis in the opposite direction, feeding fragmentation and vortex motions on\nsmaller scales and thus making the 3D evolution with finer grid resolution more\nsimilar to 1D. More favorable conditions for explosions in 3D may therefore be\ntightly linked to efficient growth of low-order SASI modes including\nnonaxisymmetric ones. \n\n"}

The\nfinal total rest mass exceeds Mmax, but the remnant does not collapse promptly.\nTo assess whether the object will ultimately collapse after cooling, we\nintroduce radiative thermal cooling. We first apply our cooling algorithm to\nTZlOs formed in WDNS head-on collisions, and show that these objects collapse\nand form black holes on the cooling time scale, as expected. However, when we\ncool the spinning TZlO formed in the merger of a circular-orbit WDNS binary,\nthe remnant does not collapse, demonstrating that differential rotational\nsupport is sufficient to prevent collapse. Given that the final total mass\nexceeds Mmax, magnetic fields and/or viscosity may redistribute angular\nmomentum and ultimately lead to delayed collapse to a BH. We infer that the\nmerger of realistic massive WDNS binaries likely will lead to the formation of\nspinning TZlOs that undergo delayed collapse. \n\n"}

We\nuse an approximative treatment of neutrino transport and replace the\nhigh-density interior of the neutron star (NS) by an inner boundary condition\nbased on an analytic proto-NS core-cooling model, whose free parameters are\nchosen such that explosion energy, nickel production, and energy release by the\ncompact remnant of progenitors around 20 solar masses are compatible with\nSupernova 1987A. Thus we are able to simulate the accretion phase, initiation\nof the explosion, subsequent neutrino-driven wind phase for 15-20 s, and the\nfurther evolution of the blast wave for hours to days until fallback is\ncompleted. Our results challenge long-standing paradigms. We find that remnant\nmass, launch time, and properties of the explosion depend strongly on the\nstellar structure and exhibit large variability even in narrow intervals of the\nprogenitors' zero-age-main-sequence mass. While all progenitors with masses\nbelow about 15 solar masses yield NSs, black hole (BH) as well as NS formation\nis possible for more massive stars, where partial loss of the hydrogen envelope\nleads to weak reverse shocks and weak fallback.

This in turn implied that the\nneutrino driven wind is proton rich during its entire life, precluding\n$r$-process nucleosynthesis and the synthesis of Sr, Y, and Zr. This work\nrelied on charged current neutrino interaction rates that are appropriate for a\nfree nucleon gas. Here, it is shown in detail that the inclusion of the nucleon\npotential energies and collisional broadening of the response significantly\nalters this conclusion. Iso-vector interactions, which give rise to the nuclear\nsymmetry energy, produce a difference between the neutron and proton\nsingle-particle energies $\\Delta U=U_n-U_p$ and alter the kinematics of the\ncharged current reactions. In neutron-rich matter, and for a given\nneutrino/antineutrino energy, the rate for $\\nu_e+n\\rightarrow e^-+p$ is\nenhanced while $ \\bar{\\nu}_e+p\\rightarrow n+e^+$ is suppressed because the $Q$\nvalue for these reactions is altered by $\\pm\\Delta U$, respectively. In the\nneutrino decoupling region, collisional broadening acts to enhance both $\\nu_e$\nand $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ cross-sections and RPA corrections decrease the $\\nu_e$\ncross-section and increase the $\\bar \\nu_e$ cross-section, but mean field\nshifts have a larger effect. Therefore, electron neutrinos decouple at lower\ntemperature than when the nucleons are assumed to be free and have lower\naverage energies. The change is large enough to allow for a reasonable period\nof time when the neutrino driven wind is predicted to be neutron rich. It is\nalso shown that the electron fraction in the wind is influenced by the nuclear\nsymmetry energy. \n\n"}

While convection has so far been observed to grow first in\nself-consistent hydrodynamical models with multi-group neutrino transport, we\nhere present the first such simulation in which the SASI grows faster while the\ndevelopment of convection is initially inhibited. We illustrate the features of\nthis SASI-dominated regime using an explosion model of a 27 solar mass\nprogenitor, which is contrasted with a convectively-dominated model of an 8.1\nsolar mass progenitor with subsolar metallicity, whose early post-bounce\nbehavior is more in line with previous 11.2 and 15 solar mass explosion models.\nWe analyze the conditions discriminating between the two different regimes,\nshowing that a high mass-accretion rate and a short advection time-scale are\nconducive for strong SASI activity.

My conclusion is that there is little or no evidence for\nsuch objects.\n  Panchromatic properties of all types of radio loud AGN are then reviewed in\ndetail. Radio galaxies usually show subparsec-scale radio core sources, jets,\nand a pair of giant radio lobes. The optical spectra sometimes show only\nrelatively weak lines of low-ionization ionic species, and no clear nuclear\ncontinuum in the optical or UV region of the spectrum. Some show strong\nhigh-ionization narrow lines. Finally, a few radio galaxies add broad bases\nonto the permitted lines. These spectral categories are the same as those for\nradio-quiet AGN and quasars.\n  By the 1980s, data from optical polarization and statistics of the radio\nproperties required that many narrow line radio galaxies do in fact produce\nstrong optical/UV continuum. This continuum and the broad line emission are\nhidden from the line of sight by dusty, roughly toroidal gas distributions, but\nthey are seen in polarized flux. The radio galaxies with hidden quasars are\nreferred to as \"thermal.\"\n  Do all radio galaxies harbor hidden quasars?

I: Escape of Ionizing\n  Photons Abstract: We describe a new method for simulating ionizing radiation and supernova\nfeedback in the analogues of low-redshift galactic disks. In this method, which\nwe call star-forming molecular cloud (SFMC) particles, we use a ray-tracing\ntechnique to solve the radiative transfer equation for ultraviolet photons\nemitted by thousands of distinct particles on the fly. Joined with high\nnumerical resolution of 3.8 pc, the realistic description of stellar feedback\nhelps to self-regulate star formation. This new feedback scheme also enables us\nto study the escape of ionizing photons from star-forming clumps and from a\ngalaxy, and to examine the evolving environment of star-forming gas clumps. By\nsimulating a galactic disk in a halo of 2.3e11 Msun, we find that the average\nescape fraction from all radiating sources on the spiral arms (excluding the\ncentral 2.5 kpc) fluctuates between 0.08% and 5.9% during a ~20 Myr period with\na mean value of 1.1%. The flux of escaped photons from these sources is not\nstrongly beamed, but manifests a large opening angle of more than 60 degree\nfrom the galactic pole. Further, we investigate the escape fraction per SFMC\nparticle, f_esc(i), and how it evolves as the particle ages. We discover that\nthe average escape fraction f_esc is dominated by a small number of SFMC\nparticles with high f_esc(i). On average, the escape fraction from a SFMC\nparticle rises from 0.27% at its birth to 2.1% at the end of a particle\nlifetime, 6 Myrs. This is because SFMC particles drift away from the dense gas\nclumps in which they were born, and because the gas around the star-forming\nclumps is dispersed by ionizing radiation and supernova feedback. The framework\nestablished in this study brings deeper insight into the physics of photon\nescape fraction from an individual star-forming clump, and from a galactic\ndisk. \n\n"}

We argue on statistical grounds that the Higgs field would be highly\nunlikely to begin in the small field meta-stable region in the early universe,\nand thus some new physics should enter in the energy range of order, or lower\nthan, the instability scale to remove the large field unstable region. We\nassume that Peccei-Quinn (PQ) dynamics enters to solve the strong CP problem\nand, for a PQ-scale in this energy range, may also remove the unstable region.\nWe allow the PQ-scale to scan and argue, again on statistical grounds, that its\nvalue in our universe should be of order the instability scale, rather than\n(significantly) lower.

To this end, we perform 3D general-relativistic\nsimulations with a 3-species neutrino leakage scheme. The leakage scheme\ncaptures the essential aspects of neutrino cooling, heating, and lepton number\nexchange as predicted by radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. The 27-solar-mass\nprogenitor was studied in 2D by B. Mueller et al. (ApJ 761:72, 2012), who\nobserved strong growth of the SASI while neutrino-driven convection was\nsuppressed. In our 3D simulations, neutrino-driven convection grows from\nnumerical perturbations imposed by our Cartesian grid. It becomes the dominant\ninstability and leads to large-scale non-oscillatory deformations of the shock\nfront. These will result in strongly aspherical explosions without the need for\nlarge-scale SASI shock oscillations. Low-l-mode SASI oscillations are present\nin our models, but saturate at small amplitudes that decrease with increasing\nneutrino heating and vigor of convection.

The apsidal motion of a binary system with an eccentric\norbit provides information regarding the interior structure constants of the\nindividual stars. These constants are related to the normalized stellar\ninterior density distribution and can be extracted from the predictions of\nstellar evolution models. We demonstrate that low-mass, pre-main sequence stars\nundergoing radiative core contraction display rapidly changing interior\nstructure constants (greater than 5% per 10 Myr) that, when combined with\nobservational determinations of the interior structure constants (with 5 -- 10%\nprecision), allow for a robust age estimate. This age estimate, unlike those\nbased on surface quantities, is largely insensitive to the surface layer where\neffects of magnetic activity are likely to be most pronounced. On the main\nsequence, where age sensitivity is minimal, the interior structure constants\nprovide a valuable test of the physics used in stellar structure models of\nlow-mass stars. There are currently no known systems where this technique is\napplicable. Nevertheless, the emphasis on time domain astronomy with current\nmissions, such as Kepler, and future missions, such as LSST, has the potential\nto discover systems where the proposed method will be observationally feasible. \n\n"}

This result was obtained with the Prometheus-Vertex code with the\nsame sophisticated neutrino treatment so far used only in 1D and 2D models.\nWhile buoyant plumes initially determine the nonradial mass motions in the\npostshock layer, bipolar shock sloshing with growing amplitude sets in during a\nphase of shock retraction and turns into a violent spiral mode whose growth is\nonly quenched when the infall of the Si/SiO interface leads to strong shock\nexpansion in response to a dramatic decrease of the mass accretion rate. In the\nphase of large-amplitude SASI sloshing and spiral motions, the postshock layer\nexhibits nonradial deformation dominated by the lowest-order spherical\nharmonics (l=1, m=0,-1,+1) in distinct contrast to the higher multipole\nstructures associated with neutrino-driven convection.

This paper shows that several properties of the Crab are best\nsuited to Type IIn-P explosions (Type IIn spectra with plateau light curves).\nThese events probably arise from relatively low-energy (1e50 erg) explosions\nwith low 56Ni yield resulting from electron-capture SNe (ecSNe), but their high\nluminosity and Type IIn spectra are dominated by shock interaction with CSM.\nAfter about 120 days, nearly all of the mass in the CSM and ejecta ends up in a\nslow dense shell. In the scenario proposed here for SN1054, this thin shell is\naccelerated by the growing pulsar wind nebula, producing the complex network of\nfilaments seen today. There is no need to invoke the invisible fast SN envelope\nhypothesized to reside outside the Crab.

The flow structure is\ngeometrically thick, and independent of the gas density and cooling, if the\ncooling time is longer than the viscous timescale (i.e., $t_{\\rm cool} \\gtrsim\nt_{\\rm visc}$). For higher densities, the gas can cool before it can accrete\nand forms the standard geometrically thin, optically thick Shakura-Sunyaev\ndisk. For usual cooling processes (such as bremsstrahlung), we expect an inner\nhot flow and an outer thin disk. For a short cooling time the accretion flow\nseparates into two phases: a radiatively inefficient hot coronal phase and a\ncold thin disk. We argue that there is an upper limit on the density of the hot\ncorona corresponding to a critical value of $t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff} (\\sim\n10-100)$, the ratio of the cooling time and the free-fall time. Based on our\nsimulations, we have developed a model for transients observed in black hole\nX-ray binaries (XRBs). An XRB in a quiescent hot RIAF state can transition to a\ncold black-body dominated state because of an increase in the mass accretion\nrate. The transition from a thin disk to a RIAF happens because of mass\nexhaustion due to accretion; the transition happens when the cooling time\nbecomes longer than the viscous time at inner radii.

Only the outermost ejecta layers with free-expansion\nvelocities larger than about 18,000 km/s have been shocked so far in this\ndynamically young, likely Type Ia SNR. A long (980 ks) Chandra observation in\n2011 allowed spatially-resolved spectroscopy of heavy-element ejecta. We\ndenoised Chandra data with the spatio-spectral method of Krishnamurthy et al.,\nand used a wavelet-based technique to spatially localize thermal emission\nproduced by intermediate-mass elements (IMEs: Si and S) and iron. The spatial\ndistribution of both IMEs and Fe is extremely asymmetric, with the strongest\nejecta emission in the northern rim. Fe Kalpha emission is particularly\nprominent there, and fits with thermal models indicate strongly oversolar Fe\nabundances. In a localized, outlying region in the northern rim, IMEs are less\nabundant than Fe, indicating that undiluted Fe-group elements (including 56Ni)\nwith velocities larger than 18,000 km/s were ejected by this SN. But in the\ninner west rim, we find Si- and S-rich ejecta without any traces of Fe, so\nhigh-velocity products of O-burning were also ejected. G1.9+0.3 appears similar\nto energetic Type Ia SNe such as SN 2010jn where iron-group elements at such\nhigh free-expansion velocities have been recently detected. The pronounced\nasymmetry in the ejecta distribution and abundance inhomogeneities are best\nexplained by a strongly asymmetric SN explosion, similar to those produced in\nsome recent 3D delayed-detonation Type Ia models. \n\n"}

In this paper, we study the transition from\nsuper-AGB star to massive star and find that a propagating neon-oxygen burning\nshell is common to both the most massive electron capture supernova (EC-SN)\nprogenitors and the lowest mass iron-core collapse supernova (FeCCSN)\nprogenitors.

Abstract: We estimate the formation height range contributing to broad-band and\nnarrow-band filter imaging data in Ca II H to investigate whether spicules can\nbe detected in such observations at the centre of the solar disc. We apply\nspectral filters of FWHMs from 0.03 nm to 1 nm to observed Ca line profiles to\nsimulate Ca imaging data. We estimate the relative intensity contributions of\noff-limb and on-disc structures. We compare the synthetic Ca filter imaging\ndata with intensity maps of Ca spectra at different wavelengths and temperature\nmaps at different optical depths. We determine the intensity response function\nfor the wavelengths covered by the filters of different FWHM.\n  The intensity emitted off the solar limb is about 5% of the intensity at disc\ncentre. For a 0.3 nm-wide Ca II H filter, up to about 1/3 of the off-limb\nintensity comes from emission in Hepsilon. On the disc, only about 15% of the\nintensity transmitted through a broad-band filter comes from the line-core\nregion. No traces of elongated fibrillar structures are visible in imaging data\nat disc centre, opposite to the line-core images of the Ca spectra.

{"id": "1307.2890", "contents": "Title: The stability of tidally deformed neutron stars to three- and four-mode\n  coupling Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the tidal deformation of a neutron star\nexcites daughter p- and g-modes to large amplitudes via a quasi-static\ninstability. This would remove energy from the tidal bulge, resulting in\ndissipation and possibly affecting the phase evolution of inspiralling binary\nneutron stars and hence the extraction of binary parameters from gravitational\nwave observations. This instability appears to arise because of a large\nthree-mode interaction among the tidal mode and high-order p- and g-modes of\nsimilar radial wavenumber. We show that additional four-mode interactions enter\ninto the analysis at the same order as the three-mode terms previously\nconsidered. We compute these four-mode couplings by finding a volume-preserving\ncoordinate transformation that relates the energy of a tidally deformed star to\nthat of a radially perturbed spherical star. Using this method, we relate the\nfour-mode coupling to three-mode couplings and show that there is a near-exact\ncancellation between the destabilizing effect of the three-mode interactions\nand the stabilizing effect of the four-mode interaction. We then show that the\nequilibrium tide is stable against the quasi-static decay into daughter p- and\ng-modes to leading order. The leading deviation from the quasi-static\napproximation due to orbital motion of the binary is considered; while it may\nslightly spoil the near-cancellation, any resulting instability timescale is at\nleast of order the gravitational-wave inspiral time. We conclude that the\np-/g-mode coupling does not lead to a quasi-static instability, and does not\nimpact the phase evolution of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars. \n\n"}

Depending on\nthe structure of the stellar progenitor, each of these instabilities can\ndominate the evolution of the gain region prior to the onset of explosion, with\nimplications for the ensuing asymmetries. Here we examine the flow dynamics in\nthe neighborhood of explosion by means of parametric two-dimensional,\ntime-dependent hydrodynamic simulations for which the linear stability\nproperties are well understood. We find that systems for which the convection\nparameter is sub-critical (SASI-dominated) develop explosions once large-scale,\nhigh-entropy bubbles are able to survive for several SASI oscillation cycles.\nThese long-lived structures are seeded by the SASI during shock expansions.\nFinite-amplitude initial perturbations do not alter this outcome qualitatively,\nthough they can lead to significant differences in explosion times.\nSupercritical systems (convection-dominated) also explode by developing\nlarge-scale bubbles, though the formation of these structures is due to buoyant\nactivity. Non-exploding systems achieve a quasi-steady state in which the\ntime-averaged flow adjusts itself to be convectively sub-critical.

Whether\nlarge scale fields are amplified in situ or a remnant from previous stages of\nan object's history is often debated for objects without a definitive magnetic\nactivity cycle. Magnetic helicity, a measure of twist and linkage of magnetic\nfield lines, is a unifying tool for understanding large scale field evolution\nfor both mechanisms of origin. Its importance stems from its two basic\nproperties: (1) magnetic helicity is typically better conserved than magnetic\nenergy; and (2) the magnetic energy associated with a fixed amount of magnetic\nhelicity is minimized when the system relaxes this helical structure to the\nlargest scale available. Here I discuss how magnetic helicity has come to help\nus understand the saturation of and sustenance of large scale dynamos, the need\nfor either local or global helicity fluxes to avoid dynamo quenching, and the\nassociated observational consequences.

The models were computed with\nthe Vertex-CoCoNuT code, using three-flavor, energy-dependent neutrino\ntransport in the ray-by-ray-plus approximation. Our results confirm the close\nsimilarity of the mean energies of electron antineutrinos and heavy-lepton\nneutrinos and even their crossing during the accretion phase for stars with\nM>10 M_sun as observed in previous 1D and 2D simulations with state-of-the-art\nneutrino transport. We establish a roughly linear scaling of the electron\nantineutrino mean energy with the proto-neutron star (PNS) mass, which holds in\ntime as well as for different progenitors. Convection inside the PNS affects\nthe neutrino emission on the 10-20% level, and accretion continuing beyond the\nonset of the explosion prevents the abrupt drop of the neutrino luminosities\nseen in artificially exploded 1D models.

Initially, LESA seems to develop stochastically from convective\nfluctuations, it exists for hundreds of milliseconds or more, and it persists\nduring violent shock sloshing associated with the standing accretion shock\ninstability. The nue minus antinue flux asymmetry originates mainly below the\nneutrinosphere in a region of pronounced proto-neutron star (PNS) convection,\nwhich is stronger in the hemisphere of enhanced lepton-number flux. On this\nside of the PNS, the mass-accretion rate of lepton-rich matter is larger,\namplifying the lepton-emission asymmetry, because the spherical stellar infall\ndeflects on a dipolar deformation of the stalled shock. The increased shock\nradius in the hemisphere of less mass accretion and minimal lepton-number flux\n(antinue flux maximum) is sustained by stronger convection on this side, which\nis boosted by stronger neutrino heating because the average antinue energy is\nhigher than the average nue energy. Asymmetric heating thus supports the global\ndeformation despite extremely nonstationary convective overturn behind the\nshock. While these different elements of LESA form a consistent picture, a full\nunderstanding remains elusive at present.

At its core, VIDE uses a substantially\nenhanced version of ZOBOV (Neyinck 2008) to calculate a Voronoi tessellation\nfor estimating the density field and a performing a watershed transform to\nconstruct voids.

Here we show that for large\ngrains (size >0.1 micron, containing most grain mass) in sufficiently large\nmolecular clouds (radii >1-10 pc, masses >10^4 M_sun), this scale becomes\nlarger than the characteristic sizes of pre-stellar cores (the sonic length),\nso large fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio are imprinted on cores. As a\nresult, star clusters and protostellar disks formed in large clouds should\nexhibit significant abundance spreads in the elements preferentially found in\nlarge grains. This naturally predicts populations of carbon-enhanced stars,\ncertain highly unusual stellar populations observed in nearby open clusters,\nand may explain the 'UV upturn' in early-type galaxies. It will also\ndramatically change planet formation in the resulting protostellar disks, by\npreferentially 'seeding' disks with an enhancement in large carbonaceous or\nsilicate grains. The relevant threshold for this behavior scales simply with\ncloud densities and temperatures, making straightforward predictions for\nclusters in starbursts and high-redshift galaxies. Because of the selective\nsorting by size, this process is not necessarily visible in extinction mapping.\nWe also predict the shape of the abundance distribution -- when these\nfluctuations occur, a small fraction of the cores may actually be seeded with\nabundances ~100 times the mean, such that they are almost 'totally metal'\n(Z~1)!

The planet\nitself has a high total density, suggesting that it may also have a high\nmetallicity in its atmosphere. We analyze two eclipses of the planet in each of\nthe 3.6- and 4.5 micron bands of Warm Spitzer. These data exhibit intra-pixel\ndetector sensitivity fluctuations that were resistant to traditional\ndecorrelation methods. We have developed a simple, powerful, and radically\ndifferent method to correct the intra-pixel effect for Warm Spitzer data, which\nwe call pixel-level decorrelation (PLD). PLD corrects the intra-pixel effect\nvery effectively, but without explicitly using - or even measuring - the\nfluctuations in the apparent position of the stellar image. We illustrate and\nvalidate PLD using synthetic and real data, and comparing the results to\nprevious analyses. PLD can significantly reduce or eliminate red noise in\nSpitzer secondary eclipse photometry, even for eclipses that have proven to be\nintractable using other methods. Our successful PLD analysis of four HAT-P-20b\neclipses shows a best-fit blackbody temperature of 1134 +/-29K, indicating\ninefficient longitudinal transfer of heat, but lacking evidence for strong\nmolecular absorption. We find sufficient evidence for variability in the 4.5\nmicron band that the eclipses should be monitored at that wavelength by\nSpitzer, and this planet should be a high priority for JWST spectroscopy. All\nfour eclipses occur about 35 minutes after orbital phase 0.5, indicating a\nslightly eccentric orbit.

We made two independent analyses: one based\nupon identifying the three Cartesian velocity components; and the other based\nupon the cosine dependence of the deviation from Hubble flow on the sky. We\napply these analyses to the Union2.1 SN Ia data and to the SDSS-II supernova\nsurvey. For both methods, results for low redshift, $z < 0.05$, are consistent\nwith previous searches.

The progenitor is a nonrotating,\nzero-metallicity 9.6 Msun star with an iron core. While in spherical symmetry\noutward shock acceleration sets in later than 300 ms after bounce, a successful\nexplosion starts at ~130 ms postbounce in two dimensions (2D). The 3D model\nexplodes at about the same time but with faster shock expansion than in 2D and\na more quickly increasing and roughly 10 percent higher explosion energy of\n>10^50 erg. The more favorable explosion conditions in 3D are explained by\nlower temperatures and thus reduced neutrino emission in the cooling layer\nbelow the gain radius. This moves the gain radius inward and leads to a bigger\nmass in the gain layer, whose larger recombination energy boosts the explosion\nenergy in 3D.

At core bounce, progenitors with rapid\ncore rotation rates exhibit a characteristic GW signal which can be used to\nconstrain the properties of the core of the progenitor star. We investigate the\ndynamics of rapidly rotating core collapse, focusing on hydrodynamic waves\ngenerated by the core bounce and the GW spectrum they produce. The centrifugal\ndistortion of the rapidly rotating proto-neutron star (PNS) leads to the\ngeneration of axisymmetric quadrupolar oscillations within the PNS and\nsurrounding envelope. Using linear perturbation theory, we estimate the\nfrequencies, amplitudes, damping times, and GW spectra of the oscillations. Our\nanalysis provides a qualitative explanation for several features of the GW\nspectrum and shows reasonable agreement with nonlinear hydrodynamic\nsimulations, although a few discrepancies due to non-linear/rotational effects\nare evident. The dominant early postbounce GW signal is produced by the\nfundamental quadrupolar oscillation mode of the PNS, at a frequency $0.70 \\,\n{\\rm kHz} \\lesssim f \\lesssim 0.80\\,{\\rm kHz}$, whose energy is largely trapped\nwithin the PNS and leaks out on a $\\sim\\!10$ ms timescale.

Both the PNS structure and Coriolis/centrifugal\nforces have a strong impact on the GW spectrum, and a detection of the GW\nsignal can therefore be used to constrain progenitor properties. \n\n"}

We also consider the full mass field\nas the sum of two distinct fields: dark matter halos ($M>9\\times\n10^{12}~M_{\\odot}$/h) and particles not included into halos.

Using Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the relativistic runaway electron avalanche (RREA) process,\ntheoretical predictions for the temporal and spectral evolution of TGFs are\ncompared to observations made with the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board\nthe Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Assuming a single source altitude of 15\nkm, a comparison of simulations to data is performed for a range of empirically\nchosen source electron variation time scales. The data exhibit a clear\nsoftening with increased source distance, in qualitative agreement with\ntheoretical predictions. The simulated spectra follow this trend in the data,\nbut tend to underestimate the observed hardness. Such a discrepancy may imply\nthat the basic RREA model is not sufficient. Alternatively, a TGF beam that is\ntilted with respect to the zenith could produce an evolution with source\ndistance that is compatible with the data. Based on these results, we propose\nthat the source electron distributions of TGFs observed by GBM vary on time\nscales of at least tens of microseconds, with an upper limit of approx. 100\nmicroseconds. \n\n"}

The\n3D model shows a faster and steadier growth of the explosion energy and already\nshows signs of subsiding accretion after one second. By contrast, the growth of\nthe explosion energy in 2D is unsteady, and accretion lasts for several seconds\nas confirmed by additional long-time simulations of stars of similar masses.\nAppreciable explosion energies can still be reached, albeit at the expense of\nrather high neutron star masses. In 2D, the binding energy at the gain radius\nis larger because the strong excitation of downward-propagating g-modes removes\nenergy from the freshly accreted material in the downflows. Consequently, the\nmass outflow rate is considerably lower in 2D than in 3D. This is only\npartially compensated by additional heating by outward-propagating acoustic\nwaves in 2D. Moreover, the mass outflow rate in 2D is reduced because much of\nthe neutrino energy deposition occurs in downflows or bubbles confined by\nsecondary shocks without driving outflows. Episodic constriction of outflows\nand vertical mixing of colder shocked material and hot, neutrino-heated ejecta\ndue to Rayleigh-Taylor instability further hamper the growth of the explosion\nenergy in 2D.

We have carried out three\ndimensional (3-D) hydrodynamical simulations to study spiral wakes/shocks\nexcited by young planets. We find that, in contrast with linear theory, the\npitch angle of spiral arms does depend on the planet mass, which can be\nexplained by the non-linear density wave theory. A secondary (or even a\ntertiary) spiral arm, especially for inner arms, is also excited by a massive\nplanet. With a more massive planet in the disk, the excited spiral arms have\nlarger pitch angle and the separation between the primary and secondary arms in\nthe azimuthal direction is also larger. We also find that although the arms in\nthe outer disk do not exhibit much vertical motion, the inner arms have\nsignificant vertical motion, which boosts the density perturbation at the disk\natmosphere.

The fundamental\nchallenge in CCSN theory is to explain how a stalled accretion shock revives to\nexplode a star. In this manuscript, we assume that the shock revival is\ninitiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition\nfor spherically symmetric shock expansion, $v_s > 0$. One of the most useful\none-dimensional explosion conditions is the neutrino luminosity and\nmass-accretion rate ($L_{\\nu}-\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$) critical curve. Below this\ncurve, steady-state stalled solutions exist, but above this curve, there are no\nstalled solutions. Burrows & Goshy suggested that the solutions above this\ncurve are dynamic and explosive. In this manuscript, we take one step closer to\nproving this supposition; we show that all steady solutions above this curve\nhave $v_s > 0$. Assuming that these steady $v_s > 0$ solutions correspond to\nexplosion, we present a new dimensionless integral condition for explosion,\n$\\Psi > 0$. $\\Psi$ roughly describes the balance between pressure and gravity,\nand we show that this parameter is equivalent to the $\\tau$ condition used to\ninfer the $L_{\\nu}-\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$ critical curve. The illuminating\ndifference is that there is a direct relationship between $\\Psi$ and $v_s$.\nBelow the critical curve, $\\Psi$ may be negative, positive, and zero, which\ncorresponds to receding, expanding, and stalled-shock solutions. At the\ncritical curve, the minimum $\\Psi$ solution is zero; above the critical curve,\n$\\Psi_{\\rm min} > 0$, and all steady solutions have $v_s > 0$.

Due to their role neutrinos carry information from the heart of\nthe explosion and, due to their weakly interacting nature, offer the only\ndirect probe of the dynamics and thermodynamics at the center of a supernova.\nIn this paper, we review the present status of modelling the neutrino physics\nand signal formation in collapsing and exploding stars. We assess the\ncapability of current and planned large underground neutrino detectors to yield\nfaithful information of the time and flavor dependent neutrino signal from a\nfuture Galactic supernova. We show how the observable neutrino burst would\nprovide a benchmark for fundamental supernova physics with unprecedented\nrichness of detail.

As for the latter, we\ndiscuss self-induced flavor conversions associated with neutrino-neutrino\ninteractions that occur in the deepest stellar regions; matter effects that\nmodify the pattern of flavor conversions in the dynamical stellar envelope;\nneutrino-oscillation signatures that result from structural features associated\nwith the shock-wave propagation as well as turbulent mass motions in post-shock\nlayers.

We do\nso through a phase space analysis of the shock acceleration, $a_S$, in the\n$R_S-V_S$ plane, shown to provide quantitative insights into the initiation of\nrunaway expansion and its nature. In the particular case of an initially\nstationary ($V_S=0,\\;a_S=0$) profile, the prospects for an explosion can be\nreasonably assessed by the initial signs of the partial derivatives of the\nshock acceleration, in analogy to a linear damped/anti-damped oscillator.

The full evolution is\nfollowed using an adaptive reaction network of up to 2000 nuclei. A novel\naspect of the survey is the use of a one-dimensional neutrino transport model\nfor the explosion. This explosion model has been calibrated to give the\nobserved energy for SN 1987A, using several standard progenitors, and for the\nCrab supernova using a 9.6 solar mass progenitor. As a result of using a\ncalibrated central engine, the final kinetic energy of the supernova is\nvariable and sensitive to the structure of the presupernova star. Many\nprogenitors with extended core structures do not explode, but become black\nholes, and the masses of exploding stars do not form a simply connected set.\nThe resulting nucleosynthesis agrees reasonably well with the sun provided that\na reasonable contribution from Type Ia supernovae is also allowed, but with a\ndeficiency of light s-process isotopes.

We study the internal dynamics of neutrino-driven convection\nand its role in re-distributing energy and momentum through the gain region. We\nfind that even if buoyant plumes are able to locally transfer heat up to the\nshock, convection is not able to create a net positive energy flux and overcome\nthe downwards transport of energy from the accretion flow. Turbulent convection\ndoes, however, provide a significant effective pressure support to the\naccretion flow as it favors the accumulation of energy, mass and momentum in\nthe gain region. We derive an approximate equation that is able to explain and\npredict the shock evolution in terms of integrals of quantities such as the\nturbulent pressure in the gain region or the effects of non-radial motion of\nthe fluid. We use this relation as a way to quantify the role of turbulence in\nthe dynamics of the accretion shock.

All models develop explosions, but depending on the progenitor\nstructure, they can be divided into two classes. With a steep density decline\nat the Si/Si-O interface, the arrival of this interface at the shock front\nleads to a sudden drop of the mass-accretion rate, triggering a rapid approach\nto explosion. With a more gradually decreasing accretion rate, it takes longer\nfor the neutrino heating to overcome the accretion ram pressure and explosions\nset in later. Early explosions are facilitated by high mass-accretion rates\nafter bounce and correspondingly high neutrino luminosities combined with a\npronounced drop of the accretion rate and ram pressure at the Si/Si-O\ninterface.

However, measuring the signal is technically challenging: one must\nextract a small, frequency-dependent signal from under much brighter spectrally\nsmooth foregrounds. Traditional approaches to study the global signal have used\nsingle antennas, which require one to calibrate out the frequency-dependent\nstructure in the overall system gain (due to internal reflections, for example)\nas well as remove the noise bias from auto-correlating a single amplifier\noutput. This has motivated proposals to measure the signal using\ncross-correlations in interferometric setups, where additional calibration\ntechniques are available. In this paper we focus on the general principles\ndriving the sensitivity of the interferometric setups to the global signal. We\nprove that this sensitivity is directly related to two characteristics of the\nsetup: the cross-talk between readout channels (i.e. the signal picked up at\none antenna when the other one is driven) and the correlated noise due to\nthermal fluctuations of lossy elements (e.g. absorbers or the ground) radiating\ninto both channels.

All methods but one\naccurately assess their own errors: for these methods, the individual\nmeasurement uncertainties are comparable to the scatter in eclipse depths over\nthe 10 epoch sample. To assess the accuracy of the techniques as well as to\nclarify the difference between instrumental and other sources of measurement\nerror, we have also analyzed a simulated data set of 10 visits to XO-3b, for\nwhich the eclipse depth is known. We find that three of the methods (BLISS\nmapping, Pixel Level Decorrelation, and Independent Component Analysis) obtain\nresults that are within three times the photon limit of the true eclipse depth.\nWhen averaged over the 10 epoch ensemble, 5 out of 7 techniques come within 60\nppm of the true value.

In the\nstandard method, galaxy line-of-sight (LOS) velocities, $v$, or velocity\ndispersions are used to infer cluster masses, $M$, in order to quantify the\nhalo mass function (HMF), $dn(M)/d\\log(M)$, which is strongly affected by mass\nmeasurement errors. In our new method, the probability distribution of\nvelocities for each cluster in the sample are summed to create a new statistic\ncalled the velocity distribution function (VDF), $dn(v)/dv$. The VDF can be\nmeasured more directly and precisely than the HMF and it can also be robustly\npredicted with cosmological simulations which capture the dynamics of subhalos\nor galaxies. We apply these two methods to mock cluster catalogs and forecast\nthe bias and constraints on the matter density parameter $\\Omega_m$ and the\namplitude of matter fluctuations $\\sigma_8$ in flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmologies.\nFor an example observation of 200 massive clusters, the VDF with (without)\nvelocity errors constrains the parameter combination $\\sigma_8\\Omega_m^{0.29\\\n(0.29)} = 0.587 \\pm 0.011\\ (0.583 \\pm 0.011)$ and shows only minor bias.\nHowever, the HMF with dynamical mass errors is biased to low $\\Omega_m$ and\nhigh $\\sigma_8$ and the fiducial model lies well outside of the forecast\nconstraints, prior to accounting for Eddington bias. When the VDF is combined\nwith constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the degeneracy\nbetween cosmological parameters can be significantly reduced. Upcoming\nspectroscopic surveys that probe larger volumes and fainter magnitudes will\nprovide a larger number of clusters for applying the VDF as a cosmological\nprobe. \n\n"}

To maximize the science return from such a rare\nevent, it is essential to have established classes of possible situations and\npreparations for appropriate observations. To this end, we use a long-term\nnumerical simulation of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) of a 17 solar-mass\nred supergiant progenitor to self-consistently model the multi-messenger\nsignals expected in GW, neutrino, and electromagnetic messengers. This\nsupernova model takes into account the formation and evolution of a\nprotoneutron star, neutrino-matter interaction, and neutrino transport, all\nwithin a two-dimensional shock hydrodynamics simulation. With this, we\nseparately discuss three situations: (i) a CCSN at the Galactic Center, (ii) an\nextremely nearby CCSN within hundreds of parsecs, and (iii) a CCSN in nearby\ngalaxies within several Mpc. These distance regimes necessitate different\nstrategies for synergistic observations. In a Galactic CCSN, neutrinos provide\nstrategic timing and pointing information.

This has been explained by 3D turbulence leading to\nenergy cascading from large to small spatial scales, inversely to the 2D case,\nthus disfavoring the growth of buoyant plumes on the largest scales. Unless the\ninertia to explode simply reflects a lack of sufficient resolution in relevant\nregions, it suggests that some important aspect may still be missing for robust\nand sufficiently energetic neutrino-powered explosions. Such deficits could be\nassociated with progenitor properties like rotation, magnetic fields or\npre-collapse perturbations, or with microphysics that could lead to an\nenhancement of neutrino heating behind the shock. 3D simulations have also\nrevealed new phenomena that are not present in 2D, for example spiral modes of\nthe standing accretion shock instability (SASI) and a stunning dipolar\nlepton-emission self-sustained asymmetry (LESA).

First\n  multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the oxygen deflagration Abstract: In the classical picture, electron-capture supernovae and the\naccretion-induced collapse of oxygen-neon white dwarfs (ONeWDs) undergo an\noxygen deflagration phase before gravitational collapse produces a neutron star\n(NS). These types of core collapse events are postulated to explain several\nastronomical phenomena. In this work, the deflagration phase is simulated for\nthe first time using multidimensional hydrodynamics, with the aim of gaining\nnew insight into the explosive deaths of $8-10~M_\\odot$ stars and ONeWDs that\naccrete material from a binary companion star. The main aim is to determine\nwhether these events are thermonuclear or core-collapse supernova explosions,\nand hence whether NSs are formed by such phenomena. The deflagration is\nsimulated in ONe cores with three different central ignition densities. The\nintermediate density case is perhaps the most realistic, being based on recent\nnuclear physics calculations and 1D stellar models. The 3D hydrodynamic\nsimulations presented in this work begin from a centrally confined flame\nstructure using a level-set-based flame approach and are performed in $256^3$\nand $512^3$ numerical resolutions. In the simulations with intermediate and low\nignition density, the cores do not appear to collapse into NSs. Instead, almost\na solar mass of material becomes unbound from the cores, leaving bound\nremnants. These simulations represent the case in which semiconvective mixing\nduring the electron-capture phase preceding the deflagration is inefficient.\nThe masses of the bound remnants double when Coulomb corrections are included\nin the EoS, however they still do not exceed the effective Chandrasekhar mass\nand, hence, would not collapse into NSs. The simulations with the highest\nignition density ($\\log_{10}\\rho_{\\rm c}=10.3$), representing the case where\nsemiconvective mixing is very efficient, show clear signs that the core will\ncollapse into a NS. \n\n"}

The simulation covers the full solid angle to allow the\nemergence of large-scale convective modes. Due to core contraction and the\nconcomitant acceleration of nuclear burning, the convective Mach number\nincreases to ~0.1 at collapse, and an l=2 mode emerges shortly before the end\nof the simulation. Aside from a growth of the oxygen shell from 0.51 to 0.56\nsolar masses due to entrainment from the carbon shell, the convective flow is\nreasonably well described by mixing length theory, and the dominant scales are\ncompatible with estimates from linear stability analysis. We deduce that\nartificial changes in the physics, such as accelerated core contraction, can\nhave precarious consequences for the state of convection at collapse.

We propose a\nsupervised machine learning approach to this endeavour, based on principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, followed by artificial\nneural networks (ANNs) estimating the spectral type. Our analysis is performed\nwith image simulations mimicking the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced\nCamera for Surveys (ACS) in the F606W and F814W bands, as well as the Euclid\nVIS imager. We first demonstrate this classification in a simple context,\nassuming perfect knowledge of the point spread function (PSF) model and the\npossibility of accurately generating mock training data for the machine\nlearning. We then analyse its performance in a fully data-driven situation, in\nwhich the training would be performed with a limited subset of bright stars\nfrom a survey, and an unknown PSF with spatial variations across the detector.\nWe use simulations of main-sequence stars with flat distributions in spectral\ntype and in signal-to-noise ratio, and classify these stars into 13 spectral\nsubclasses, from O5 to M5. Under these conditions, the algorithm achieves a\nhigh success rate both for Euclid and HST images, with typical errors of half a\nspectral class.

Its distinctive features are:\nthe use of an integral approach to estimating the gradients; the use of a\nflexible family of interpolators called sinc kernels, which suppress pairing\ninstability; and the incorporation of a new type of volume element which\nprovides a better partition of the unity. Unlike other modern formulations,\nwhich consider volume elements linked to pressure, our volume element choice\nrelies on density. SPHYNX conserves mass, linear and angular momentum, energy,\nentropy, and preserves kernel normalization even in strong shocks. The coupling\nbetween the integral approach to calculate gradients and the new family of\nvolume elements reduces the so-called tensile instability. Both features help\nto suppress the damp which often prevents the growth of hydrodynamic\ninstabilities in regular SPH codes. On the whole, SPHYNX has passed the\nverification tests described below. For identical particle setting and initial\nconditions the results were similar (or better in some particular cases) than\nthose obtained with other SPH schemes such as GADGET-2, PSPH or with the recent\ndensity-independent formulation (DISPH) and conservative reproducing kernel\n(CRKSPH) techniques. \n\n"}

However, this barrier\nis weakened in presence of viscosity, more so, if there are explicit energy\ndissipations at the boundary layer itself. We study effects of viscosity and\nenergy dissipation theoretically on the outflow rate and show that as the\nviscosity or energy dissipation (or both) rises, the prospect of formation of\noutflows is greatly reduced, thereby verifying results obtained through\nobservations and numerical simulations. Indeed, we find that in a dissipative\nviscous flow, shocks in presence of outflows can be produced only if the\nShakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter {\\alpha} is less than 0.2. This is a direct\nconsequence of modification of the Rankine-Hugoniot relation across the shock\nin a viscous flow, when the energy dissipation and mass loss in the form of\noutflows from the post-shock region are included.

GW emission in the\npre-explosion phase strongly depends on whether the post-shock flow is\ndominated by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or convection and\ndiffers considerably from 2D models. SASI activity produces a strong signal\ncomponent below 250 Hz through asymmetric mass motions in the gain layer and a\nnon-resonant coupling to the proto-neutron star (PNS). Both convection- and\nSASI-dominated models show GW emission above 250 Hz, but with considerably\nlower amplitudes than in 2D. This is due to a different excitation mechanism\nfor high-frequency l=2 motions in the PNS surface, which are predominantly\nexcited by PNS convection in 3D. Resonant excitation of high-frequency surface\ng-modes in 3D by mass motions in the gain layer is suppressed compared to 2D\nbecause of smaller downflow velocities and a lack of high-frequency variability\nin the downflows. In the exploding 20 Msun model, shock revival results in\nenhanced low-frequency emission due to a change of the preferred scale of the\nconvective eddies in the PNS convection zone.

Unfortunately,\ncurrent estimates span a wide range of values and often are statistically\nincompatible with one another.

We present spatially sampled maps of\nthe CH+ J=3-2 transition at 119.8 {\\mu}m and the OH {\\Lambda}-doublet at 84\n{\\mu}m in the Orion Bar over an area of 110\"x110\" with Herschel (PACS). We\ncompare the spatial distribution of these molecules with those of their\nchemical precursors, C+, O and H2, and tracers of warm and dense gas. We assess\nthe spatial variation of CH+ J=2-1 velocity-resolved line profile observed with\nHerschel (HIFI). The OH and CH+ lines correlate well with the high-J CO\nemission and delineate the warm and dense molecular region. While similar, the\ndifferences in the CH+ and OH morphologies indicate that CH+ formation and\nexcitation are related to the observed vibrationally excited H2. This indicates\nthat formation pumping contributes to the excitation of CH+. Interestingly, the\npeak of the rotationally excited OH 84 {\\mu}m emission coincides with a bright\nyoung object, proplyd 244-440, which shows that OH can be an excellent tracer\nof UV-irradiated dense gas. The spatial distribution of CH+ and OH revealed in\nour maps is consistent with previous modeling studies. Both formation pumping\nand nonreactive collisions in a UV-irradiated dense gas are important CH+ J=3-2\nexcitation processes. The excitation of the OH {\\Lambda}-doublet at 84 {\\mu}m\nis mainly sensitive to the temperature and density. \n\n"}

In\nthe current implementation, we use an exact solution of the radiative transfer\nequation, in the pure absorption limit, in our forward model, which allows us\nto analytically integrate over all of the outgoing rays (instead of performing\nGaussian quadrature). Two chemistry models are considered: unconstrained\nchemistry (where the mixing ratios are treated as free parameters) and\nequilibrium chemistry (enforced via analytical formulae, where only the\nelemental abundances are free parameters). The nested sampling algorithm allows\nus to formally implement Occam's Razor based on a comparison of the Bayesian\nevidence between models.

In disks, the ratios of volatile elements, such as C/O and\nN/O, are regulated by the abundance of the main C, N, O carriers, their ice\nbinding environment, and the presence of snowlines of major volatiles at\ndifferent distances from the central star. We explore the effects of disk\ndynamical processes, molecular compositions and abundances, and ice\ncompositions on the snowline locations of the main C, O and N carriers, and the\nC/N/O ratios in gas and dust throughout the disk. The gas-phase N/O ratio\nenhancement in the outer disk (exterior to the H2O snowline) exceeds the C/O\nratio enhancement for all reasonable volatile compositions.

In the LS EOS the shock wave reaches ~700km at 300ms after bounce and is\nstill expanding whereas in the FS EOS it stalled at ~200km and has started to\nrecede by the same time.

Not much is known about the\npresence of the fragile 6Li isotope in evolved solar-metallicity RGB stars, not\nto mention its production in magnetically active targets like HD123351. From\nfits of the observed CFHT spectrum with synthetic line profiles based on 1D and\n3D model atmospheres, we seek to estimate the abundance of the 6Li isotope and\nto place constraints on its origin. We derive A(Li) and the 6Li/7Li isotopic\nratio by fitting different synthetic spectra to the Li-line region of a\nhigh-resolution CFHT spectrum (R=120 000, S/R=400). The synthetic spectra are\ncomputed with four different line lists, using in parallel 3D hydrodynamical\nCO5BOLD and 1D LHD model atmospheres and treating the line formation of the\nlithium components in non-LTE (NLTE).

Most of the time, only planets are considered as possible places where\nextraterrestrial life can emerge and evolve, however, their moons could be\ninhabited, too. I present a comprehensive study, which considers habitability\nnot only on planets, but on satellites, as well. My research focuses on three\nclosely related topics. The first one is the circumstellar habitable zone,\nwhich is usually used as a first proxy for determining the habitability of a\nplanet around the host star. The word habitability is used in the sense that\nliquid water, which is essential for life as we know it, may be present on the\nplanetary surface. Whether the planet is habitable or not, its moon might have\na suitable surface temperature for holding water reservoirs, providing that\ntidal heating is in action. Tidal heating is generated inside the satellite and\nits source is the strong gravitational force of the nearby planet. The second\ntopic of my research explores tidal heating and the habitability of extra-solar\nmoons with and without stellar radiation and other related energy sources. Life\nis possible to form even on icy planetary bodies, inside tidally heated\nsubsurface oceans. The third topic probes the possibility of identifying an\nice-covered satellite from photometric observations. A strong indication of\nsurface ice is the high reflectance of the body, which may be measured when the\nmoon disappears behind the host star, so its reflected light is blocked out by\nthe star. \n\n"}

We use group\ncatalogs to isolate a robust sample of central galaxies with high purity and\ncompleteness.

The results for SFR are consistent\nwith a model in which SFR correlates with present-day halo accretion rate,\n$\\dot{M}_h$. In this model, galaxies are assigned to halos using the abundance\nmatching ansatz, which maps galaxy stellar mass onto halo mass. At fixed halo\nmass, SFR is assigned to galaxies using the same approach,but $\\dot{M}_h$ is\nused to map onto SFR. The best-fit model requires some scatter in the\n$\\dot{M}_h$-SFR relation.

Here, we identify and study both resonant and new\nnon-resonant instabilities, in the simple case where the gas satisfies neutral\nhydrodynamics and supports acoustic waves ($\\omega^{2}=c_{s}^{2}\\,k^{2}$). The\ngas and dust are coupled via an arbitrary drag law and subject to external\naccelerations (e.g. gravity, radiation pressure). If there is any dust drift\nvelocity, the system is unstable. The instabilities exist for {\\em all}\ndust-to-gas ratios $\\mu$ and their growth rates depend only weakly on $\\mu$\naround resonance, as $\\sim\\mu^{1/3}$ or $\\sim \\mu^{1/2}$ (depending on\nwavenumber). The behavior changes depending on whether the drift velocity is\nlarger or smaller than the sound speed $c_{s}$. In the supersonic regime a\n'resonant' instability appears with growth rate increasing without limit with\nwavenumber, even for vanishingly small $\\mu$ and values of the coupling\nstrength ('stopping time').

The instabilities directly drive exponentially growing\ndust-to-gas-ratio fluctuations, which can be large even when the modes are\notherwise weak. We discuss physical implications for cool-star winds,\nAGN-driven winds and torii, and starburst winds: the instabilities alter the\ncharacter of these outflows and could drive clumping and/or turbulence in the\ndust and gas. \n\n"}

Besides using the angular momentum of the 15 solar-mass model\nas obtained in the stellar evolution calculation with an angular frequency of\nabout 0.001 rad/s (spin period of more than 6000 s) at the Si/Si-O interface,\nwe also computed 2D and 3D cases with no rotation and with a ~300 times shorter\nrotation period and different angular resolutions. In 2D, only the nonrotating\nand slowly rotating models explode, while rapid rotation prevents an explosion\nwithin 500 ms after bounce because of lower radiated neutrino luminosities and\nmean energies and thus reduced neutrino heating. In contrast, only the fast\nrotating model develops an explosion in 3D when the Si/Si-O interface collapses\nthrough the shock.

Higher mass disks generally\nshow brighter CN. Higher UV fields, such as those appropriate for T Tauri stars\nwith high accretion rates or for Herbig Ae stars or for higher disk flaring,\ngenerally result in brighter and larger rings.

From our fully\ngeneral relativistic numerical computations of the structures of fast-spinning\ncompact stars, known as millisecond pulsars, we find that such a stellar\nconversion causes a simultaneous spin-up and decrease in gravitational mass of\nthese stars.

Next, we show with strong significance that $\\epsilon(F)$\nincreases with $T_{\\rm{eq}}$ towards a maximum of $\\sim 2.5\\%$ at $T_{\\rm{eq}}\n\\approx 1500$ K, and then decreases as temperatures increase further, falling\nto $\\sim0.2\\%$ at $T_\\rm{eff}= 2500$ K. This high-flux decrease in inflation\nefficiency was predicted by the Ohmic dissipation model of giant planet\ninflation but not other models.

There are two clear\ndirections in which such an observatory could optimize its performance.\nFirstly, optimize the performance of sub-TeV energies. This is especially\nimportant to provide an unbiased monitoring of a large fraction of the sky for\nobservations of transient and extended sources. Secondly, to obtain the largest\nphoton statistics above roughly 50 TeV, which requires a large collection area\nwith sufficient performance in angular and energy resolution.

GALARIO speeds up the\ncomputation of synthetic visibilities from a generic 2D model image or a radial\nbrightness profile (for axisymmetric sources). On a GPU, GALARIO is 150 faster\nthan standard Python and 10 times faster than serial C++ code on a CPU. Highly\nmodular, easy to use and to adopt in existing code, GALARIO comes as two\ncompiled libraries, one for Nvidia GPUs and one for multicore CPUs, where both\nhave the same functions with identical interfaces.

After many theoretical attempts to understand the\nmeaning of $\\Lambda$, and in view of the enhanced accuracy of the cosmological\nobservations, it seems now mandatory that this issue should be first settled\nempirically before further theoretical speculations on its ultimate nature. In\nthis work, we summarize the situation of some of these studies. Devoted\nanalyses made recently show that the $\\Lambda=$const. hypothesis, despite being\nthe simplest, may well not be the most favored one.

The T dependency of VUV\nabsorption cross sections are poorly known, leading to an undefined uncertainty\nin atmospheric models. Similarly, data measured at low T similar to that of the\nhigh atmosphere of Mars, Venus, and Titan are often lacking. Our aim is to\nquantify the T dependency of the abs. cross section of important molecules in\nplanetary atmospheres. We want to provide both high-resolution data at T\nprevailing in these media and a simple parameterization of the absorption in\norder to simplify its use in photochemical models. This study focuses on carbon\ndioxide. We performed experimental measurements of CO$_2$ absorption cross\nsection with synchrotron radiation for the wavelength range (115--200nm). For\nlonger wavelengths (195--230nm), we used a deuterium lamp and a 1.5m Jobin-Yvon\nspectrometer.

Seven M-dwarfs included in the CARMENES sample had\nbeen observed before with HIRES and HARPS and either were reported to have one\nshort period planetary companion (GJ15A, GJ176, GJ436, GJ536 and GJ1148) or are\nmultiple planetary systems (GJ581 and GJ876).\n  Aims: We aim to report new precise optical radial velocity measurements for\nthese planet hosts and test the overall capabilities of CARMENES.\n  Methods: We combined our CARMENES precise Doppler measurements with those\navailable from HIRES and HARPS and derived new orbital parameters for the\nsystems. Bona-fide single planet systems are fitted with a Keplerian model. The\nmultiple planet systems were analyzed using a self-consistent dynamical model\nand their best fit orbits were tested for long-term stability.\n  Results: We confirm or provide supportive arguments for planets around all\nthe investigated stars except for GJ15A, for which we find that the\npost-discovery HIRES data and our CARMENES data do not show a signal at 11.4\ndays.

An alternative to new elementary particles\npostulates DM as made of macroscopic compact halo objects (MACHO) such as black\nholes formed in the very early universe. Stellar-mass primordial black holes\n(PBHs) are subject to less robust constraints than other mass ranges and might\nbe connected to gravitational-wave signals detected by the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). New methods are therefore necessary to\nconstrain the viability of compact objects as a DM candidate. Here we report\nbounds on the abundance of compact objects from gravitational lensing of type\nIa supernovae (SNe). Current SNe datasets constrain compact objects to\nrepresent less than 35.2% (Joint Lightcurve Analisis) and 37.2% (Union 2.1) of\nthe total matter content in the universe, at 95% confidence-level. The results\nare valid for masses larger than $\\sim 0.01M_\\odot$ (solar-masses), limited by\nthe size SNe relative to the lens Einstein radius. We demonstrate the mass\nrange of the constraints by computing magnification probabilities for realistic\nSNe sizes and different values of the PBH mass.

These results are robust against\ncosmological parameters, outlier rejection, correlated noise and selection\nbias.

Important issues\nhere include the initial state of forming and evolving disks, chemical and dust\nprocesses within them, the migration of planets and the importance of planet\ntraps, the nature of angular momentum transport processes involving turbulence\nand/or MHD disk winds, planet formation theory, and advanced treatments of disk\nastrochemistry. All of these issues affect, and are affected by the chemistry\nof disks which is driven by X-ray ionization of the host stars. We discuss how\nthese processes lead to a coherent end-to-end model and how this may address\nthe basic question. \n\n"}

From Michel H\\'enon ideas to\n  isochrone relativity: classification, interpretation and applications Abstract: Revisiting and extending an old idea of Michel H\\'enon, we geometrically and\nalgebraically characterize the whole set of isochrone potentials. Such\npotentials are fundamental in potential theory. They appear in spherically\nsymmetrical systems formed by a large amount of charges (electrical or\ngravitational) of the same type considered in mean-field theory. Such\npotentials are defined by the fact that the radial period of a test charge in\nsuch potentials, provided that it exists, depends only on its energy and not on\nits angular momentum.\n  Our characterization of the isochrone set is based on the action of a real\naffine subgroup on isochrone potentials related to parabolas in the\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$ plane. Furthermore, any isochrone orbits are mapped onto\nassociated Keplerian elliptic ones by a generalization of the Bohlin\ntransformation. This mapping allows us to understand the isochrony property of\na given potential as relative to the reference frame in which its parabola is\nrepresented. We detail this isochrone relativity in the special relativity\nformalism.\n  We eventually exploit the completeness of our characterization and the\nrelativity of isochrony to propose a deeper understanding of general symmetries\nsuch as Kepler's Third Law and Bertrand's theorem. \n\n"}

Results from the nearly 11 years of monitoring are presented\nhere. Structure functions are used to measure the UV-optical and X-ray power\nspectra. The X-ray structure function measured between 10-100 days is\nconsistent with the flat, low-frequency part of the power spectrum measured\npreviously in Mrk 335. The UV-optical structure functions of Mrk 335 are\ncomparable with those of other Seyfert 1 galaxies and of Mrk 335 itself when it\nwas in a normal bright state. There is no indication that the current X-ray\nlow-flux state is attributed to changes in the accretion disc structure of Mrk\n335. The characteristic timescales measured in the structure functions can be\nattributed to thermal (for the UV) and dynamic (for the optical) timescales in\na standard accretion disc. The high-quality UVW2 (~1800 A in the source frame)\nstructure function appears to have two breaks and two different slopes between\n10-160 days. Correlations between the X-ray and other bands are not highly\nsignificant when considering the entire 11-year light curves, but more\nsignificant behaviour is present when considering segments of the light curves.\nA correlation between the X-ray and UVW2 in 2014 (Year-8) may be predominately\ncaused by an giant X-ray flare that was interpreted as jet-like emission.

For the most common type of progenitors, likely with slowly rotating\ncores, the dominant GW emission mechanisms are the post-bounce oscillations of\nthe proto-neutron star (PNS) before the explosion. We present a new procedure\nto compute the eigenmodes of the system formed by the PNS and the stalled\naccretion shock in general relativity including spacetime perturbations.

We apply our analysis to two\nnumerical core-collapse simulations and show that our improved method is able\nto obtain eigenfrequencies that accurately match the features observed in the\nGW signal and to predict the qualitative behaviour of quasi-radial\noscillations. Our analysis is possible thanks to a newly developed algorithm to\nclassify the computed eigenmodes in different classes (f-, p-, and g-modes),\nimproving previous results which suffered from misclassification issues.

This model\nassumes that central galaxies are quenched by AGN feedback when hot halo gas\naccretes onto a supermassive black hole.

Shortly after the apocenter passage, the\noptical galaxy, dark matter and gaseous core move in a north-east direction,\nwhile the displaced gas continues moving to the south-west.

This mass infall has been shown, both numerically\nand observationally, to be episodically interspersed by accretion of dense\ngaseous clumps migrating through the circumstellar disc to the protostellar\nsurface, causing sudden accretion and luminous bursts. Using numerical\ngravito-radiation-hydrodynamics and stellar evolution calculations, we\ndemonstrate that, in addition to the known bloating of massive protostars,\nvariable episodic accretion further influences their evolutionary tracks of\nmassive young stellar objects (MYSOs). For each accretion-driven flare, they\nexperience rapid excursions toward more luminous, but colder regions of the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram. During these excursions, which can occur up to the\nend of the pre-main-sequence evolution, the photosphere of massive protostars\ncan episodically release much less energetic photons and MYSOs surreptitiously\nadopt the same spectral type as evolved massive (supergiants) stars.

The alignments indicate\nthese pulsars were born either in isolation or with negligible velocity\ncontributions from binary motions.

If the kick is generated when the neutron star first forms\nby asymmetric mass ejection or/and neutrino emission, then the alignment\nrequires that the protoneutron star possesses an original spin with period\n$P_s$ much less than the kick timescale, thus spin-averaging the kick forces.\nThe kick timescale ranges from 100 ms to 10 s depending on whether the kick is\nhydrodynamically driven or neutrino-magnetic field driven. For hydrodynamical\nmodels, spin-kick alignment further requires the rotation period of an\nasymmetry pattern at the radius near shock breakout (>100 km) to be much less\nthan ~100 ms; this is difficult to satisfy unless rotation plays a dynamically\nimportant role in the core collapse and explosion ($P_s\\lo 1$ ms).

The outer\nregions of galaxies both as observed and as simulated have density profiles\nsteeper than the self-similar profile. Nevertheless there appears to be an\nintermediate region in most galaxies in which the inverse square behaviour is a\ngood description. The outer deviations can be explained plausibly in terms of\nthe transition from a self-gravitating extended halo to a Keplerian flow onto a\ndominant central mass (the isothermal distribution can not be complete), but\nthe inner deviations are more problematic.

It is widely accepted,\nalthough not confirmed, that magnetic fields drive an energetic jet which\nproduces a burst of TeV neutrinos by photon-meson interaction, and eventually\nbreaks out of the stellar envelope appearing as a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB). Based\non recent numerical simulations and neutrino emission models, we predict the\nexpected neutrino diffuse flux from these PopIII GRBs and compare it with the\ncapabilities of present and planned detectors as AMANDA and IceCube. If beamed\ninto 1% of the sky, we find that the rate of PopIII GRBs is $\\le 4 \\times 10^6$\nyr$^{-1}$. High energy neutrinos from PopIII GRBs could dominate the overall\nflux in two energy bands [$10^4 - 10^5$] GeV and [$10^5 - 10^6$] GeV of\nneutrino telescopes. The enhanced sensitivities of forthcoming detectors in the\nhigh-energy band (AMANDA-II, IceCube) will provide a fundamental insight on the\ncharacteristic explosion energies of PopIII GRBs and will constitute a unique\nprobe of the the Initial Mass Function (IMF) of the first stars and of the\nredshift $z_f$ marking the metallicity-driven transition from a top-heavy to a\nnormal IMF.

The\nhalo MDF is quite broad but dominated by a moderately high-metallicity\npopulation peaking at [m/H] ~ -0.5, strikingly different from the [m/H] ~ -1.3\nlevel which characterizes the outer halo of the Milky Way.

We found that the rate of average mass accretion to the nucleus due\nto the radiation drag exerted by newly formed stars in the forming galaxy is\n$\\approx 10^{-5}M_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. As a result of this accretion, an IMBH\nwith $\\approx 10^{4}M_{\\odot}$ can be formed in the center of the spiral galaxy\nat $z\\sim 4$.

Therefore, our model naturally\npredicts a correlation between massive BHs and dark matter halos. Moreover, it\nis found that the final BH-to-bulge mass ratio ($\\approx 5\\times 10^{-5}$) in a\nsmall spiral galaxy at high-$z$ is much smaller than that in the large galaxies\n($\\approx 10^{-3}$).

Coronagraphs\ntackle only the photon noise contribution by reducing diffracted star light at\nthe location of a planet. Speckle noise should be addressed with\nadaptative-optics systems. Following the tracks of Malbet, Yu and Shao (1995),\nwe develop in this paper two analytical methods for wavefront sensing and\ncontrol that aims at creating dark holes, i.e. areas of the image plane cleared\nout of speckles, assuming an ideal coronagraph and small aberrations. The first\nmethod, speckle field nulling, is a fast FFT-based algorithm that requires the\ndeformable-mirror influence functions to have identical shapes. The second\nmethod, speckle energy minimization, is more general and provides the optimal\ndeformable mirror shape via matrix inversion. With a NxN deformable mirror, the\nsize of matrix to be inverted is either N^2xN^2 in the general case, or only\nNxN if influence functions can be written as the tensor product of two\none-dimensional functions. Moreover, speckle energy minimization makes it\npossible to trade off some of the dark hole area against an improved contrast.\nFor both methods, complex wavefront aberrations (amplitude and phase) are\nmeasured using just three images taken with the science camera (no dedicated\nwavefront sensing channel is used), therefore there are no non-common path\nerrors. We assess the theoretical performance of both methods with numerical\nsimulations, and find that these speckle nulling techniques should be able to\nimprove the contrast by several orders of magnitude. \n\n"}

We argue that there exist two types of turbulence\nin star-forming clouds: a primordial (or ``interstellar'') turbulence and a\nprotostellar turbulence, with the former transformed into the latter mostly in\nembedded clusters such as NGC 1333. Since the majority of stars are thought to\nform in clusters, an implication is that the stellar initial mass function is\ndetermined to a large extent by the stars themselves, through outflows which\nindividually limit the mass accretion onto forming stars and collectively shape\nthe environments (density structure and velocity field) in which most cluster\nmembers form.

We consider three 15 solar mass\nprogenitors with different structures and one rotating model, in which we\nreplace the dense core of the newly formed neutron star (NS) by a contracting\ninner grid boundary, and trigger neutrino-driven explosions by systematically\nvarying the neutrino fluxes emitted at this boundary.

In this\nstudy, pseudobulges are identified using the presence of disk-like structure in\nthe center of the galaxy (nuclear spiral, nuclear bar, and/or high ellipticity\nin bulge); classical bulges are those galaxy bulges with smooth isophotes which\nare round compared to the outer disk, and show no disky structure in their\nbulge. I show that galaxies structurally identified as having pseudobulges have\nhigher central star formation rates than those of classical bulges. Further, I\nalso show that galaxies identified as having classical bulges have remarkably\nregular star formation profiles. The color profiles of galaxies with classical\nbulges show a star forming outer disk with a sharp change, consistent with a\ndecline in star formation rates, toward the center of the galaxy. Classical\nbulges have a nearly constant inner profile (r < 1.5 kpc) that is similar to\nelliptical galaxies. Pseudobulges in general show no such transition in star\nformation properties from the outer disk to the central pseudobulge.

Abstract: The primordial gas in the earliest dark matter halos, collapsing at redshifts\naround z=20, with masses M_halo=10^6 M_sun, and virial temperatures\nT_vir<10^4K, relied on the presence of molecules for cooling. Several\ntheoretical studies have suggested that gas contraction and star-formation in\nthese minihalos was suppressed by radiative, chemical, thermal, and dynamical\nfeedback processes. The recent measurement by the Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe (WMAP) of the optical depth to electron scattering,\ntau=0.09+/-0.03, provides the first empirical evidence for this suppression.\nThe new WMAP result is consistent with vanilla models of reionization, in which\nionizing sources populate cold dark matter (CDM) halos down to a virial\ntemperature of T_vir=10^4K. On the other hand, we show that in order to avoid\noverproducing the optical depth, the efficiency for the production of ionizing\nphotons in minihalos must have been about an order of magnitude lower than\nexpected and lower than the efficiency in large halos that can cool via atomic\nhydrogen (T_vir > 10^4K). This conclusion is insensitive to assumptions about\nthe efficiency of ionizing photon production in the large halos, as long as\nreionization ends by z=6, as required by the spectra of bright quasars at z<6.\nOur conclusion is strengthened if the clumping of the ionized gas evolves with\nredshift, as suggested by semi-analytical predictions and three-dimensional\nnumerical simulations. \n\n"}

Both strong and\nelectromagnetic correlations are considered.The propagation of particle-hole\ninteractions in the medium plays an important role in determining the neutrino\nmean free paths. The effects due to Pauli-Blocking and density, spin, and\nisospin correlations in the medium significantly reduce the neutrino cross\nsections. Due to the lack of experimental information at high density, these\ncorrelations are necessarily model dependent. For example, spin correlations in\nnonrelativistic models are found to lead to larger suppressions of neutrino\ncross sections compared to those of relativistic models. This is due to the\ntendency of the nonrelativistic models to develop spin instabilities.\nNotwithstanding the above caveats, and the differences between nonrelativistic\nand relativistic approaches such as the spin- and isospin-dependent\ninteractions and the nucleon effective masses, suppressions of order 2--3,\nrelative to the case in which correlations are ignored, are obtained. Neutrino\ninteractions in dense matter are especially important for supernova and early\nneutron star evolution calculations. The effects of correlations for\nprotoneutron star evolution are calculated. Large effects on the internal\nthermodynamic properties of protoneutron stars, such as the temperature, are\nfound. These translate into significant early enhancements in the emitted\nneutrino energies and fluxes, especially after a few seconds. At late times,\nbeyond about 10 seconds, the emitted neutrino fluxes decrease more rapidly\ncompared to simulations without the effects of correlations, due to the more\nrapid onset of neutrino transparency in the protoneutron star \n\n"}

We give simple examples with negative\nenergy in higher dimensions even if the matter is not beyond horizon or system\ndoes not have large `momentum'. They do not have the lower bound on the mass.\nWe also give a positive energy argument in higher dimensions and realise that\nelementary fermion cannot exist in our examples. \n\n"}

A general method\nand geometrical picture is developed and shown to agree with effective action\nresults, commonly derived through path integration, for perturbations around a\nharmonic oscillator ground state. The same methods are used to describe\ndynamical coherent states, which in turn provide means to compute quantum\ncorrections to the symplectic structure of an effective system. \n\n"}

We find that the\nglobal balance of the forces allows a huge charge (~ 10^{20} Coulomb) to be\npresent in a neutron star producing a very high electric field (~ 10^{21} V/m).\nWe have studied the particular case of a polytropic equation of state and\nassumed that the charge distribution is proportional to the mass density. The\ncharged stars have large mass and radius as we should expect due to the effect\nof the repulsive Coulomb force with the M/R ratio increasing with charge. In\nthe limit of the maximum charge the mass goes up to ~ 10 M_sun which is much\nhigher than the maximum mass allowed for a neutral compact star. However, the\nlocal effect of the forces experienced by a single charged particle, makes it\nto discharge quickly. This creates a global force imbalance and the system\ncollapses to a charged black hole. \n\n"}

We\ntreat the uniform matter and non-uniform matter consistently using the RMF\ntheory.

{"id": "physics/0010021", "contents": "Title: Measurements of the instantaneous velocity difference and local velocity\n  with a fiber-optic coupler Abstract: New optical arrangements with two single-mode input fibers and a fiber-optic\ncoupler are devised to measure the instantaneous velocity difference and local\nvelocity. The fibers and the coupler are polarization-preserving to guarantee a\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio. When the two input fibers are used to collect the\nscattered light with the same momentum transfer vector but from two spatially\nseparated regions in a flow, the obtained signals interfere when combined via\nthe fiber-optic coupler. The resultant light received by a photomultiplier tube\ncontains a cross-beat frequency proportional to the velocity difference between\nthe two measuring points. If the two input fibers are used to collect the\nscattered light from a common scattering region but with two different momentum\ntransfer vectors, the resultant light then contains a self-beat frequency\nproportional to the local velocity at the measuring point. The experiment shows\nthat both the cross-beat and self-beat signals are large and the standard laser\nDoppler signal processor can be used to measure the velocity difference and\nlocal velocity in real time. The new technique will have various applications\nin the general area of fluid dynamics. \n\n"}
