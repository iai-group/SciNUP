We consider\nlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be\nneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an\nadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite.

As a result, the gas pressure rapidly becomes almost homogeneous,\nwhile the typical Mach number of the flow drops well below unity. Eliminating\nthe acoustic modes, we reduce the hydrodynamic equations to a single nonlinear\nand nonlocal equation of a reaction-diffusion type in Lagrangian coordinates.\nThis equation describes a broad class of channel flows and, in particular, can\nfollow the development of the clustering instability from a weakly perturbed\nhomogeneous cooling state to strongly nonlinear states. If the heat diffusion\nis neglected, the reduced equation is exactly soluble, and the solution\ndevelops a finite-time density blowup.

That is, rather than being a description of the behavior of the\nuniverse, these theories describe how observers can make optimal predictions\nabout the universe. In such a picture, information plays a critical role. What\nis more is that little clues, such as the fact that black holes have entropy,\ncontinue to suggest that information is fundamental to physics in general.\n  In the last decade, our fundamental understanding of probability theory has\nled to a Bayesian revolution. In addition, we have come to recognize that the\nfoundations go far deeper and that Cox's approach of generalizing a Boolean\nalgebra to a probability calculus is the first specific example of the more\nfundamental idea of assigning valuations to partially-ordered sets. By\nconsidering this as a natural way to introduce quantification to the more\nfundamental notion of ordering, one obtains an entirely new way of deriving\nphysical laws. I will introduce this new way of thinking by demonstrating how\none can quantify partially-ordered sets and, in the process, derive physical\nlaws. The implication is that physical law does not reflect the order in the\nuniverse, instead it is derived from the order imposed by our description of\nthe universe. Information physics, which is based on understanding the ways in\nwhich we both quantify and process information about the world around us, is a\nfundamentally new approach to science. \n\n"}

Previous work on maximally random strictly jammed sphere packings in\nthree dimensions has shown that these systems are hyperuniform and possess\nunusual quasi-long-range pair correlations, resulting in anomalous logarithmic\ngrowth in the number variance. However, recent work on maximally random jammed\nsphere packings with a size distribution has suggested that such\nquasi-long-range correlations and hyperuniformity are not universal among\njammed hard-particle systems. In this paper we show that such systems are\nindeed hyperuniform with signature quasi-long-range correlations by\ncharacterizing the more general local-volume-fraction fluctuations.

For\nmodels in which agents do not save, or save with uniform saving propensity,\nthis walk has diffusive behavior. In case the saving propensity $\\lambda$ is\ndistributed randomly ($0 \\leq \\lambda < 1$), the resultant walk showed a\nballistic nature (except at a particular value of $\\lambda^* \\approx 0.47$).\nHere we consider several other features of the walk with random $\\lambda$.\nWhile some macroscopic properties of this walk are comparable to a biased\nrandom walk, at microscopic level, there are gross differences. The difference\nturns out to be due to an antipersistent tendency towards making a gain (loss)\nimmediately after making a loss (gain). This correlation is in fact present in\nkinetic models without saving or with uniform saving as well, such that the\ncorresponding walks are not identical to ordinary random walks.

We\nassert that the notion of `levels of structure', the coupling strength between\nconstituents in different levels, and the use of collective variables in each\nlevel are all pertinent factors.

In the 1-1 case with pairwise interactions\nof equal strength, the entanglement is independent of the number of constituent\nparticles $N$ in the macroscopic object. In the 1-to-all case the relative\ncoordinates are decoupled and the center of mass (CoM) coupling scales with\n$N$.

In this mesoscopic framework, multiple attractors arise as emergent\nproperties of the nonlinear systems. The interplay between the stochasticity\nand nonlinearity leads to successive jump-like transitions among different\nbasins. We argue each transition is a dynamic symmetry breaking, with the\npotential of exhibiting Thom-Zeeman catastrophe as well as phase transition\nwith the breakdown of ergodicity (e.g., cell differentiation). The slow-time\ndynamics of the nonlinear mesoscopic system is not deterministic, rather it is\na discrete stochastic jump process. The existence of these discrete states and\nthe Markov transitions among them are both emergent phenomena. This emergent\nstochastic jump dynamics then serves as the stochastic element for the\nnonlinear dynamics of a higher level aggregates on an even larger spatial and\nslower time scales (e.g., evolution).

We show that the\nparameter ${\\cal G}(L)$ decreases with system size $L$ in the MBL phase, and\ngrows in the ergodic phase. We surmise that the delocalization transition\noccurs when ${\\cal G}(L)$ is independent of system size, ${\\cal G}(L)={\\cal\nG}_c\\sim 1$. We illustrate our approach by studying the many-body localization\ntransition and resolving the many-body mobility edge in a disordered 1D XXZ\nspin-1/2 chain using exact diagonalization and time-evolving block decimation\nmethods.

This establishes a quantitative paradigm for\nunderstanding how adaptive agents leverage structured thermal environments for\ntheir own thermodynamic benefit. General ratchets behave as memoryful\ncommunication channels, interacting with their environment sequentially and\nstoring results to an output. The bulk of thermal ratchets analyzed to date,\nhowever, assume memoryless environments that generate input signals without\ntemporal correlations. Employing computational mechanics and a new\ninformation-processing Second Law of Thermodynamics (IPSL) we remove these\nrestrictions, analyzing general finite-state ratchets interacting with\nstructured environments that generate correlated input signals. On the one\nhand, we demonstrate that a ratchet need not have memory to exploit an\nuncorrelated environment.

The lesson is that to\noptimally harvest work a ratchet's memory must reflect the input generator's\nmemory.

This has been\ndemonstrated using the statistical state dynamics (SSD) framework with a\nclosure at second order. Furthermore, it was shown that for small\nsupercriticality the flow-forming instability follows Ginzburg-Landau (G-L)\ndynamics.

First, we compare the\npredictions of the weakly nonlinear G-L dynamics to the fully nonlinear SSD\ndynamics closed at second order for a wide ranges of parameters. A new branch\nof jet equilibria is revealed that is not contiguously connected with the G-L\nbranch. This new branch at weak supercriticalities involves jets with larger\namplitude compared to the ones of the G-L branch. Furthermore, this new branch\ncontinues even for subcritical values with respect to the linear flow-forming\ninstability.

The interplay between conservation laws and scrambling\nsheds light on the mechanism by which unitary quantum dynamics, which is\nreversible, gives rise to diffusive hydrodynamics, which is a dissipative\nprocess. We obtain our results in a random quantum circuit model that is\nconstrained to have a conservation law. We find that a generic spreading\noperator consists of two parts: (i) a conserved part which comprises the weight\nof the spreading operator on the local conserved densities, whose dynamics is\ndescribed by diffusive charge spreading. This conserved part also acts as a\nsource that steadily emits a flux of (ii) non-conserved operators. This\nemission leads to dissipation in the operator hydrodynamics, with the\ndissipative process being the conversion of operator weight from local\nconserved operators to nonconserved, at a rate set by the local diffusion\ncurrent. The emitted nonconserved parts then spread ballistically at a\nbutterfly speed, thus becoming highly nonlocal and hence essentially\nnon-observable, thereby acting as the \"reservoir\" that facilitates the\ndissipation.

We find that non-local surface stabilizers (NLSS), a set of\nsymmetries of the Hamiltonian which form on the boundary of the entanglement\ncut, act as purveyors of universal non-local features appearing in the\nentanglement spectrum. While in conventional topological orders and fracton\norders, the NLSS retain a form of topological invariance with respect to the\nentanglement cut, subsystem symmetric systems---fracton and SSPT\nphases---additionally show a non-trivial geometric dependence on the\nentanglement cut, corresponding to the subsystem symmetry. This sheds further\nlight on the interplay between geometric and topological effects in fracton\nphases of matter and demonstrates that strong SSPT phases harbour a measure of\nquasi-local entanglement beyond that encountered in conventional SPT phases. We\nfurther show that a version of the edge-entanglement correspondence,\nestablished earlier for gapped two-dimensional topological phases, also holds\nfor gapped three-dimensional fracton models. \n\n"}

This seems, however, to be in contradiction with the\nfundamental role played by covariance matrices in finance, which constitute the\npillars of modern investment theory and have also gained industry-wide\napplications in risk management. Our paper is an attempt to resolve this\nembarrassing paradox. The key observation is that the effect of noise strongly\ndepends on the ratio r = n/T, where n is the size of the portfolio and T the\nlength of the available time series. On the basis of numerical experiments and\nanalytic results for some toy portfolio models we show that for relatively\nlarge values of r (e.g. 0.6) noise does, indeed, have the pronounced effect\nsuggested by [1,2,3] and illustrated later by [4,5] in a portfolio optimization\ncontext, while for smaller r (around 0.2 or below), the error due to noise\ndrops to acceptable levels. Since the length of available time series is for\nobvious reasons limited in any practical application, any bound imposed on the\nnoise-induced error translates into a bound on the size of the portfolio. In a\nrelated set of experiments we find that the effect of noise depends also on\nwhether the problem arises in asset allocation or in a risk measurement\ncontext: if covariance matrices are used simply for measuring the risk of\nportfolios with a fixed composition rather than as inputs to optimization, the\neffect of noise on the measured risk may become very small. \n\n"}

Modulated amplitude waves (MAWs) are\nquasi-periodic solutions of the CGLE that emerge near the Eckhaus instability\nof plane waves and cease to exist due to saddle-node bifurcations (SN). These\nMAWs can be characterized by their average phase gradient $\\nu$ and by the\nspatial period P of the periodic amplitude modulation. A numerical bifurcation\nanalysis reveals the existence and stability properties of MAWs with arbitrary\n$\\nu$ and P. MAWs are found to be stable for large enough $\\nu$ and\nintermediate values of P. For different parameter values they are unstable to\nsplitting and attractive interaction between subsequent extrema of the\namplitude. Defects form from perturbed plane waves for parameter values above\nthe SN of the corresponding MAWs. The break-down of phase chaos with average\nphase gradient $\\nu$ > 0 (``wound-up phase chaos'') is thus related to these\nSNs. A lower bound for the break-down of wound-up phase chaos is given by the\nnecessary presence of SNs and an upper bound by the absence of the splitting\ninstability of MAWs. \n\n"}

The\nsimplicity of the model enables us to write closed equations for the\ninter-particle distance in the presence of a finite-correlated noise. In 1D, we\nare able to find analytically the long-time growth rates of the distance\nmoments and the senior Lyapunov exponent, which consistently turns out to be\nnegative.

In particular, the\namplitude of the remnant-burst oscillations, and the corresponding missing\natoms, have prompted speculation as to the formation of a molecular condensate.\nUsing a minimal mean-field model, we find that rogue dissociation, molecular\ndissociation to noncondensate atom pairs, is qualitatively implicated as the\nphysical mechanism responsible for these observations, although very little\nmolecular condensate is formed. Refining the model provides excellent\nquantitative agreement with the experimental remnant-burst oscillations, and\nthe fraction of molecular condensate accounts almost entirely for the measured\natom loss. \n\n"}

In particular we focus on spin star and spin\nring-star geometries to investigate the effect of intra-environmental coupling\non the central spin. By changing the spectrum of the environment its effect as\na bath on the central spin is changed also and may even be adjustable to some\ndegree.
