This\nis in contrast to the assumption of hole doping into planar Cu dx2-y2 and O\npsigma orbitals as in the t-J model. Interaction of holes with the d9 spin\nbackground leads to chiral polarons with either a clockwise or anti-clockwise\ncharge current. When the polaron plaquettes percolate through the crystal at\nx~0.05 for LaSrCuO, a Cu dx2-y2 and planar O psigma band is formed. Spin\nexchange Coulomb repulsion with chiral polarons leads to D-wave\nsuperconductivity. The equivalent of the Debye energy in phonon\nsuperconductivity is the maximum energy separation between a chiral polaron and\nits time-reversed partner. An additive skew-scattering contribution to the Hall\neffect is induced by chiral polarons and leads to a temperature dependent Hall\neffect that fits the measured values for LaSrCuO.

This is why NIS\ntunneling spectra are asymmetric, with larger current for negatively biased\nsamples. It is also why there is a Meissner effect: as electrons are expelled\ntowards the surface in the presence of a magnetic field, the Lorentz force\nimparts them with azimuthal velocity, thus generating the surface Meissner\ncurrent that screens the interior magnetic field. In type II superconductors,\nthe Lorentz force acting on expelled electrons that don't reach the surface\ngives rise to the azimuthal velocity of the vortex currents.

The experimental advances made in the last decade in\nthe investigation of superconducting phenomena in low-dimensional correlated\nelectronic systems raised new questions on the nature of the BKT transitions in\nreal materials.

In fact\nPt-substitution is detrimental to higher Tc, which increases up to 38 K only by\ncharge doping of pure FeAs layers. We point out, that two different negatively\ncharged layers [(FeAs)10]n- and (Pt3+yAs8)m- compete for the electrons provided\nby the Ca2+ ions, which is unique in the field of iron-based superconductors.\nIn the parent compound Ca10(FeAs)10(Pt3As8), no excess charge dopes the\nFeAs-layer, and superconductivity has to be induced by Pt-substitution, albeit\nbelow 15 K.

Indeed, interband-dominated\npairing leads to the coexistence of bonding and antibonding superconducting\nchannels. Here we show that this has profound consequences on the nature of the\nlow-energy superconducting collective modes. In particular, the so-called\nLeggett mode for phase fluctuations is absent in the usual two-band description\nof pnictides. On the other hand, when also the repulsion between the hole bands\nis taken into account, a more general three-band description should be used,\nand a Leggett mode is then allowed.

Yet, in a number of materials, in particular the\nhigh-temperature superconductors and the layered organic superconductors, they\nfail. In these lecture notes for an international school, I emphasize that even\nthough the low energy properties of a phase of matter are generally emergent\nand entirely determined by the broken symmetry, there are many differences\nbetween a strongly correlated and a weakly correlated state of matter. For\nexample, spin waves are an emergent property for antiferromagnets, but for weak\ncorrelations the normal phase of a (Slater) antiferromagnet is metallic,\nwhereas it is insulating (Heisenberg) for strong correlations. As a function of\ninteraction strength, above the antiferromagnetic phase, the crossover between\na metal and a local moment paramagnetic insulator is described by the Mott\ntransition, whose mean-field theory down to T=0 is best formulated with\ndynamical mean-field theory. A similar situation occurs for superconductors:\ndespite similar emergent properties, there are many differences between both\nkinds of superconductors. Experimental evidence suggests that hole-doped\ncuprates are strongly correlated whereas the correlations are weaker in the\nelectron-doped case, especially near optimal doping. Evidence for a pseudogap\narising from antiferromagnetic fluctuations is strong in the latter case,\nwhereas in the hole-doped case the pseudogap temperature appears as a\nconsequence of Mott physics. In cluster dynamical mean-field theory, the\npseudogap line T* is a Widom line arising from a T=0 first-order transition\nthat terminates at a finite T critical point. Strongly correlated\nsuperconductors are much more resilient to near-neighbor repulsion than their\nweakly correlated counterpart. Many different methods to attack these problems\ntheoretically are described. \n\n"}

The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings. These\nprinciples explain why the unconventional high T_c superconductivity appears to\nbe such a rare but robust phenomena with its strict requirement on electronic\nenvironment. The robust s-wave pairing also reveals that the current standard\neffective models with only onsite interactions are not sufficient and a minimum\nmicroscopic model must include strong nearest neighbor repulsive interactions\nresulted from the d-d direct bondings to serves as a s-wave symmetry\nstabilizer.

The derivation of the response\nfunctions is based on the elegant functional path integral approach which\nallows us to calculate the density-density and spin-spin correlation functions\nby introducing the external sources for the density and the spin density. Since\nthe generating functional cannot be evaluated exactly, we consider two gapless\napproximations which ensure a gapless collective mode (Goldstone mode) in the\nsuperfluid state: the BCS-Leggett mean-field theory and the\nGaussian-pair-fluctuation (GPF) theory.

The transition has a width in doping and\nsome internal structure, whereby R$_H$ responds more slowly than $\\rho$ to the\nopening of the pseudogap. We attribute this difference to a Fermi surface that\nsupports both hole-like and electron-like carriers in the interval $0.2 < p <\np^\\star$, with compensating contributions to R$_H$. Our data are in excellent\nagreement with recent high-field data on YBCO and LSCO. The quantitative\nconsistency across three different cuprates shows that a drop in carrier\ndensity from $1 + p$ to $p$ is a universal signature of the pseudogap\ntransition at $T=0$. We discuss the implication of these findings for the\nnature of the pseudogap phase. \n\n"}

Although\nthese magnetic configurations share the same wave-vectors, they break distinct\nsymmetries of the lattice.

Here, we\nstudy a mechanism of superconductivity in heavy fermion systems, by focusing on\nthe impact of vertex corrections (VCs) for the pairing interaction going beyond\nthe Migdal approximation. In heavy fermion systems, strong interference between\nmultipole fluctuations cause significant VCs, that represent many-body effects\nbeyond mean-field-type approximations. Especially, the coupling constants\nbetween electrons and charged-bosons, including the electron-phonon coupling\nconstant, are strongly magnified by the VCs.

In this work, we derive the expressions of the\nzero-temperature spin susceptibility, the upper critical field close to the\nzero-field critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical temperature with weak\nrandom non-magnetic disorders for the singlet-quintet mixed state based on the\nLuttinger model. Our study revealed the following features of the\nsinglet-quintet mixing. (1) The zero-temperature spin susceptibility remains\nzero for the singlet-quintet mixed state if only the centrosymmetric spin-orbit\ncoupling is taken into account, and will deviate from zero when the\nnon-centrosymmetric spin-orbit coupling is introduced. (2) The singlet-quintet\nmixing can help enhance the upper critical field roughly because it can\nincrease $T_c$.

The lowering of kinetic\nenergy, mainly in-plane in origin, accounts for both the condensation energy of\nthe superconductor as well as an increased potential energy due to larger\nCoulomb repulsion in the paired state. It leads to an apparent violation of the\nconductivity sum rule, which in the clean limit we predict to be substantially\nlarger for in-plane than for c-axis conductivity. However, because cuprates are\nin the dirty limit for c-axis transport, the sum rule violation is found to be\ngreatly enhanced in the c-direction.

The\ncuprates seems to exhibit statistics, dimensionality and phase transitions in\nnovel ways. The nature of excitations [i.e. quasiparticle or collective] must\nbe understood. The Hubbard model captures some of the behaviour of the phase\ntransitions in these materials. On the other hand the phases such as stripes in\nthese materials bear relationship to quantum group or string-like solutions.\nOne thus expects that the relevant solutions of Hubbard model may thus be\nwritten in terms of stringy solutions. In short this approach may lead to the\nnon-perturbative formualtion of Hubbard and other condensed matter\nHamiltonians. The question arises that how a 1-d based symmetry such as quantum\ngroups can be relevant in describing a 3-d [spatial dimensions] system such as\ncuprates. The answer lies in the key observation that strings which are 1-d\nobjects can be used to describe physics in $d$ dimensions. For example gravity\n[which is a 3-d [spatial] plus time] phenomenon can be understood in terms of\n1-d strings. Thus we expect that 1-d quantum group object induces physics in\n2-d and 3-d which may be relevant to the cuprates. We present support for our\ncontention using [numerical] variational Monte-Carlo [MC] applied to 2d d-p\nmodel. We also briefly discuss others ways to formulate a string picture for\ncuprates, namely by exploiting connection between gauge theories and strings\nand t'Hooft picture of quark confinement. \n\n"}

In the quantum regime, however, this assumption\nleads to spurious results, such as the violation of the Galilean invariance in\nthe continuum model. Starting from a general microscopic model, in this paper\nwe explicitly derive the effective low-energy theory for the phase, up to\nfourth-order terms. This expansion allows us to properly take into account\ndynamic effects beyond the Gaussian level, both in the continuum and in the\nlattice model.

Abstract: The question of determining the underlying Fermi surface (FS) that is gapped\nby superconductivity (SC) is of central importance in strongly correlated\nsystems, particularly in view of angle-resolved photoemission experiments. Here\nwe explore various definitions of the FS in the superconducting state using the\nzero-energy Green's function, the excitation spectrum and the momentum\ndistribution. We examine (a) d-wave SC in high Tc cuprates, and (b) the s-wave\nsuperfluid in the BCS-BEC crossover. In each case we show that the various\ndefinitions agree, to a large extent, but all of them violate the Luttinger\ncount and do not enclose the total electron density.

Similar to the usual cavity QED system in form, this\ncharge qubit system with engineered couplings shows the quantum jumps (C.P.Sun\net al Fortschr. Phys. \\textbf{43}, 585 (1995))in a progressive decoherence\nprocess. Corresponding to two components of superposition of two charge states,\nthe inductor evolves simultaneously towards two distinct quasi-classical states\nentangling with two states of the charge qubit. Then it induces the quantum\ndecoherence for the induced squeezing macroscopically in the LC mode. \n\n"}

We show that that the eigenfunctions of\nthe Hamiltonian for the ring can be used to create macroscopic quantum\nsuperposition states of the ring. We also show that the ring potential may be\nutilised to squeeze coherent states. With the SQUID ring as a strong contender\nas a device for manipulating quantum information, such properties may be of\ngreat utility in the future. However, as with all candidate systems for quantum\ntechnologies, decoherence is a fundamental problem. In this paper we apply an\nopen systems approach to model the effect of coupling a quantum mechanical\nSQUID ring to a thermal bath. We use this model to demonstrate the manner in\nwhich decoherence affects the quantum states of the ring. \n\n"}
