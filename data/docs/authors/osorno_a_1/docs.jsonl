It is defined\nas a subobject of the labelled coskeleton, the latter coinciding in the\nunlabelled case with the right adjoint to the truncation functor. This\nnon-functorial construction is necessary since the labelled coskeleton functor\nof the category of labelled precubical sets does not fulfil the above\nrequirement. We prove in this paper that it is possible to force the labelled\ncoskeleton functor to be well-behaved by working with labelled transverse\nsymmetric precubical sets.

Our model follows\nthe accretion, cooling, star formation and ejection of baryonic mass inside\ngrowing dark matter haloes, with cosmologically motivated specific angular\nmomentum distributions. Models without feedback produce disks that are too\nsmall and rotate too fast. Feedback reduces the baryonic masses of galaxies,\nresulting in larger disks with lower rotation velocities. Models with feedback\ncan reproduce the zero points of the scaling relations between rotation\nvelocity, stellar mass and disk size, but only in the absence of adiabatic\ncontraction. Our feedback mechanism is maximally efficient in expelling mass,\nbut our successful models require 25% of the SN energy, or 100% of the SN\nmomentum, to drive the outflows. It remains to be seen whether such high\nefficiencies are realistic or not. Our energy and momentum driven wind models\nresult in different slopes of various scaling relations, such as size - stellar\nmass, stellar mass - halo mass, and metallicity - stellar mass. Observations\nfavor the energy driven wind at stellar masses below Mstar = 10^{10.5} Msun,\nbut the momentum driven wind model at high masses.

The motivation is extended topological quantum field theory (TQFT),\nwhere the 2-category of unitary 2-representations of a finite group is thought\nof as the `2-category assigned to the point' in the untwisted finite group\nmodel.\n  The first result is that the braided monoidal category of transformations of\nthe identity on the 2-category of unitary 2-representations of a finite group\ncomputes as the category of conjugation equivariant vector bundles over the\ngroup equipped with the fusion tensor product. This result is consistent with\nthe extended TQFT hypotheses of Baez and Dolan, since it establishes that the\ncategory assigned to the circle can be obtained as the `higher trace of the\nidentity' of the 2-category assigned to the point.\n  The second result is about 2-characters of 2-representations, a concept which\nhas been introduced independently by Ganter and Kapranov. It is shown that the\n2-character of a unitary 2-representation can be made functorial with respect\nto morphisms of 2-representations, and that in fact the 2-character is a\nunitarily fully faithful functor from the complexified Grothendieck category of\nunitary 2-representations to the category of unitary equivariant vector bundles\nover the group.\n  The final result is about pivotal structures on fusion categories, with a\nview towards a conjecture made by Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik.

The experimental\nspectral function of epitaxial graphene on SiC has been extensively studied.\nHowever, until now the cause of an anisotropy in the spectral width of the\nFermi surface has not been determined. In the current work we show, by\ncomparison of the spectral function to a semi-empirical model, that the\nanisotropy is due to small scale rotational disorder ($\\sim\\pm$ 0.15$^{\\circ}$)\nof graphene domains in graphene grown on SiC(0001) samples. In addition to the\ndirect benefit in the understanding of graphene's electronic structure this\nwork suggests a mechanism to explain similar variations in related ARPES data. \n\n"}

The homotopy relation between 2-crossed\nmodule maps will be defined in a similar way to Crans' 1-transfors between\nstrict Gray functors, however being pointed, thus this corresponds to Baues'\nhomotopy relation between quadratic module maps. Despite the fact that this\nhomotopy relation between 2-crossed module morphisms is not, in general, an\nequivalence relation, we prove that if $A$ and $A'$ are 2-crossed modules, with\nthe underlying group $F$ of $A$ being free (in short $A$ is free up to order\none), then homotopy between 2-crossed module maps $A \\to A'$ yields, in this\ncase, an equivalence relation. Furthermore, if a chosen basis $B$ is specified\nfor $F$, then we can define a 2-groupoid $HOM_B(A,A')$ of 2-crossed module maps\n$A \\to A'$, homotopies connecting them, and 2-fold homotopies between\nhomotopies, where the latter correspond to (pointed) Crans' 2-transfors between\n1-transfors.\n  We define a partial resolution $Q^1(A)$, for a 2-crossed module $A$, whose\nunderlying group is free, with a canonical chosen basis, together with a\nprojection map ${\\rm proj}\\colon Q^1(A) \\to A$, defining isomorphisms at the\nlevel of 2-crossed module homotopy groups.

We present new measurements of the global\nproperties of this cluster, including the initial mass function (IMF), age, and\ncluster mass. These results are based on Keck laser-guide-star adaptive optics\nobservations used to identify the young stars and measure their Kp-band\nluminosity function as presented in Do et al. 2013.

This model is then used to\nproduce the possible progenitors of long gamma-ray burst / hypernova (GRB/HN)\nexplosions. As the core collapses with the newly supplied angular momentum it\nproduces a Kerr black hole surrounded by an accretion disk. Energy is extracted\nfrom the rotation of the black hole (BH) through the Blandford-Znajek (BZ)\nmechanism to power both, the long gamma-ray burst and the accompanying\nhypernova (supernova type Ic broad line). If the binary survives the asymmetric\nmass loss its remnant is a black-hole binary that may eventually be observed as\na soft X-ray transient (SXT) when the companion evolves and starts to transfer\nmass back to the black hole. A comparison with a sample of black-hole binaries\nwhere the masses and orbital periods are well constrained is performed. \n\n"}

The different schemes\ncan be difficult to compare meaningfully. Here we develop a theoretical\nframework to evaluate disparate qubit-gating schemes on an equal footing. We\napply the procedure to two types of double-dot qubits: the singlet-triplet (ST)\nand the semiconducting quantum dot hybrid qubit. We investigate three quantum\ngates that flip the qubit state: a DC pulsed gate, an AC gate based on logical\nqubit resonance (LQR), and a gate-like process known as stimulated Raman\nadiabatic passage (STIRAP). These gates are all mediated by an exchange\ninteraction that is controlled experimentally using the interdot tunnel\ncoupling $g$ and the detuning $\\epsilon$, which sets the energy difference\nbetween the dots. Our procedure has two steps. First, we optimize the gate\nfidelity ($f$) for fixed $g$ as a function of the other control parameters;\nthis yields an $f^\\text{opt}(g)$ that is universal for different types of\ngates. Next, we identify physical constraints on the control parameters; this\nyields an upper bound $f^\\text{max}$ that is specific to the qubit-gate\ncombination. We show that similar gate fidelities ($ \\sim 99.5$%) should be\nattainable for ST qubits in isotopically purified Si, and for hybrid qubits in\nnatural Si.

Morphology of the molecular gas in the bar of\nNGC 5430 shows minimal signs of recent interactions in our resolution. The\napparent morphological remnant of the past galaxy interaction is an asymmetric\nspiral arm, containing more molecular gas and exhibiting higher star formation\nrate (SFR) surface density than the two primary arms. Rotation curve analysis\nsuggests that NGC 5430 and its satellite collided several Gyr ago. History of\nstar formation was constrained by using SFRs that trace different timescales\n(infrared, radio continuum, and H-alpha). The collision occurred 5 - 10 Myr\nago, triggering a transient off-center starburst of Wolf-Rayet stars at the\neastern bar end. In the past, the global SFR during the Wolf-Rayet starburst\npeaked at 35 Msun/yr. At present, the merger-driven starburst is rapidly\ndecaying and the current global SFR has decreased to the Galactic value. The\nSFR will continue to decay as suggested by the present amount of dense gas\n(traced by HCN (1-0)). Nonetheless, the global SFR is still dominated by the\nWolf-Rayet region rather than the circumnuclear region.

To answer these types of questions, one has to go beyond\nlearning visual similarity and learn a visual notion of compatibility across\ncategories. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework to help answer\nthese types of questions. The main idea of this framework is to learn a feature\ntransformation from images of items into a latent space that expresses\ncompatibility. For the feature transformation, we use a Siamese Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) architecture, where training examples are pairs of items\nthat are either compatible or incompatible. We model compatibility based on\nco-occurrence in large-scale user behavior data; in particular co-purchase data\nfrom Amazon.com. To learn cross-category fit, we introduce a strategic method\nto sample training data, where pairs of items are heterogeneous dyads, i.e.,\nthe two elements of a pair belong to different high-level categories. While\nthis approach is applicable to a wide variety of settings, we focus on the\nrepresentative problem of learning compatible clothing style.

A decomposition\nspace is a simplicial $\\infty$-groupoid satisfying an exactness condition\nweaker than the Segal condition. Just as the Segal condition expresses\ncomposition, the new condition expresses decomposition. In this paper, we\nintroduce various technical conditions on decomposition spaces. The first is a\ncompleteness condition (weaker than Rezk completeness), needed to control\nsimplicial nondegeneracy. For complete decomposition spaces we establish a\ngeneral M\\\"obius inversion principle, expressed as an explicit equivalence of\n$\\infty$-groupoids. Next we analyse two finiteness conditions on decomposition\nspaces. The first, that of locally finite length, guarantees the existence of\nthe important length filtration on the associated incidence coalgebra. We show\nthat a decomposition space of locally finite length is actually the left Kan\nextension of a semi-simplicial space. The second finiteness condition, local\nfiniteness, ensures we can take homotopy cardinality to pass from the level of\n$\\infty$-groupoids to the level of vector spaces.

Neumann boundary operators can be organized by their behavior\nunder scaling of the target space coordinates X, and the set of allowed\nX-scaling exponents is bounded above by +1/2 and unbounded below. Negative\ncontributions to X-scalings come from powers of a single invariant, or\n\"dressing\" operator, which is bilinear in the embedding coordinates. In\nparticular, we show that all Neumann boundary operators are dressed by\nquarter-integer powers of this invariant, and we demonstrate how this rule\narises from various ways of regulating the short-distance singularities of the\neffective theory. \n\n"}

Spectral sparsifiers generalize cut sparsifiers, and have\nfound many applications in designing graph algorithms. In recent years, there\nhas been interest in computing spectral sparsifiers in semi-streaming and\ndynamic settings. Natural algorithms in these settings often involve repeated\nsparsification of a graph, and accumulation of errors across these steps. We\npresent a framework for analyzing algorithms that perform repeated\nsparsifications that only incur error corresponding to a single sparsification\nstep, leading to better results for many resparsification-based algorithms. As\nan application, we show how to maintain a spectral sparsifier in the\nsemi-streaming setting: We present a simple algorithm that, for a graph $G$ on\n$n$ vertices and $m$ edges, computes a spectral sparsifier of $G$ with $O(n\n\\log n)$ edges in a single pass over $G$, using only $O(n \\log n)$ space, and\n$O(m \\log^2 n)$ total time.

These images\nacquire additional phase-shifts as the over-focused wavefront passes through\nitself along the line of sight. Time domain waveforms of Type-II images\n(associated with saddle points of the time delay) exhibit a non-trivial\ndistortion from the unlensed waveforms. This phenomenon is in addition to the\nusual frequency-independent magnification, and happens even in the geometric\nlimit where the wavelength is much shorter than the deflector's gravitational\nlength scale. Similarly, Type-III images preserve the original waveform's shape\nbut exhibit a sign flip.

The latter\ncategory Bmod^s is simply Bmod in the topos of sets endowed with an involution\nand as such it shares with Bmod most of its abstract categorical properties.\nThe three main results of the paper are the following. First, when endowed with\nthe natural ideal of null morphisms, the category Bmod^s is a semi-exact,\nhomological category in the sense of M. Grandis.

In the offline setting, the two natural objectives are profit\nmaximization, i.e., embedding a maximal number of request graphs subject to the\nresource constraints, and cost minimization, i.e., embedding all requests at\nminimal overall cost. The VNEP can be seen as a generalization of classic\nrouting and call admission problems, in which requests are arbitrary graphs\nwhose communication endpoints are not fixed. Due to its applications, the\nproblem has been studied intensively in the networking community. However, the\nunderlying algorithmic problem is hardly understood.\n  This paper presents the first fixed-parameter tractable approximation\nalgorithms for the VNEP. Our algorithms are based on randomized rounding. Due\nto the flexible mapping options and the arbitrary request graph topologies, we\nshow that a novel linear program formulation is required. Only using this novel\nformulation the computation of convex combinations of valid mappings is\nenabled, as the formulation needs to account for the structure of the request\ngraphs. Accordingly, to capture the structure of request graphs, we introduce\nthe graph-theoretic notion of extraction orders and extraction width and show\nthat our algorithms have exponential runtime in the request graphs' maximal\nwidth. Hence, for request graphs of fixed extraction width, we obtain the first\npolynomial-time approximations.\n  Studying the new notion of extraction orders we show that (i) computing\nextraction orders of minimal width is NP-hard and (ii) that computing\ndecomposable LP solutions is in general NP-hard, even when restricting request\ngraphs to planar ones. \n\n"}

Their particularity is that they aim\nat offering strong consistency (no forks) in an open system combining two\ningredients (i) a set of validators that generate blocks via a variant of\nPractical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) consensus protocol and (ii) a\nselection strategy that dynamically selects nodes to be validators for the next\nblock via a proof-of-stake mechanism. However,the exact assumptions on the\nsystem model under which Tendermint underlying algorithms are correct and the\nexact properties Tendermint verifies have never been formally analyzed. The\ncontribution of this paper is two-fold. First, while formalizing Tendermint\nalgorithms we precisely characterize the system model and the exact problem\nsolved by Tendermint. We prove that in eventual synchronous systems a modified\nversion of Tendermint solves (i) under additional assumptions, a variant of\none-shot consensus for the validation of one single block and (ii) a variant of\nthe repeated consensus problem for multiple blocks. These results hold even if\nthe set of validators is hit by Byzantine failures, provided that for each\none-shot consensus instance less than one third of the validators is Byzantine.\nOur second contribution relates to the fairness of the rewarding mechanism. It\nis common knowledge that in permisionless blockchain systems the main threat is\nthe tragedy of commons that may yield the system to collapse if the rewarding\nmechanism is not adequate. Ad minimum the rewarding mechanism must be fair,\ni.e.distributing the rewards in proportion to the merit of participants. We\nprove, for the first time in blockchain systems, that in repeated-consensus\nbased blockchains there exists an (eventual) fair rewarding mechanism if and\nonly if the system is (eventual) synchronous. We also show that the original\nTendermint rewarding is not fair, however, a modification of the original\nprotocol makes it eventually fair. \n\n"}

For example, we prove that modules over the semiring\ncategory Fin of finite sets are cocartesian monoidal $\\infty$-categories, and\nmodules over Burn (the Burnside $\\infty$-category) are additive\n$\\infty$-categories.\n  As a consequence, we can regard Lawvere theories as cyclic\n$\\text{Fin}^\\text{op}$-modules, leading to algebraic foundations for the higher\ncategorical study of Lawvere theories.

The ability to learn from continuous streams of information is\nreferred to as lifelong learning and represents a long-standing challenge for\nneural network models due to catastrophic forgetting. Computational models of\nlifelong learning typically alleviate catastrophic forgetting in experimental\nscenarios with given datasets of static images and limited complexity, thereby\ndiffering significantly from the conditions artificial agents are exposed to.\nIn more natural settings, sequential information may become progressively\navailable over time and access to previous experience may be restricted. In\nthis paper, we propose a dual-memory self-organizing architecture for lifelong\nlearning scenarios. The architecture comprises two growing recurrent networks\nwith the complementary tasks of learning object instances (episodic memory) and\ncategories (semantic memory). Both growing networks can expand in response to\nnovel sensory experience: the episodic memory learns fine-grained\nspatiotemporal representations of object instances in an unsupervised fashion\nwhile the semantic memory uses task-relevant signals to regulate structural\nplasticity levels and develop more compact representations from episodic\nexperience. For the consolidation of knowledge in the absence of external\nsensory input, the episodic memory periodically replays trajectories of neural\nreactivations.

Rapid recycling of the envelope\ngas of planets embedded in a protoplanetary disc has been proposed to delay the\ncooling and following accretion of disc gas. We compare isothermal and\nnon-isothermal 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the gas flow past a planet to\ninvestigate the influence on the feasibility of the recycling mechanism.\nRadiative cooling is implemented by using the beta cooling model. We find that,\nin either case, gas enters the Bondi sphere at high latitudes and leaves\nthrough the midplane regions, or vice versa when disc gas rotates\nsub-Keplerian.

However, neighboring patches often share spatial correlations,\nand ignoring these spatial correlations may result in inconsistent predictions.\nIn this paper, we propose a neural conditional random field (NCRF) deep\nlearning framework to detect cancer metastasis in WSIs. NCRF considers the\nspatial correlations between neighboring patches through a fully connected CRF\nwhich is directly incorporated on top of a CNN feature extractor.

We derive the normalization conditions for unstable modes\nsuch that they can serve in a mode decomposition of the non-condensed\ncomponent. Furthermore, we develop approximative techniques to determine the\nspectrum and the mode functions. Finally, we apply our theory to a sonic white\nhole and find that the spectrum of unstable modes is intrinsically discrete. \n\n"}

Naively, one might expect the field $\\phi$ to fall from the top of the\neffective potential and then experience a long stage of oscillations with\namplitude O(v) near the minimum of the effective potential at $\\phi = v$ until\nit gives its energy to particles produced during these oscillations. However,\nit was recently found that the tachyonic instability rapidly converts most of\nthe potential energy V(0) into the energy of colliding classical waves of the\nscalar field. This conversion, which was called \"tachyonic preheating,\" is so\nefficient that symmetry breaking typically completes within a single\noscillation of the field distribution as it rolls towards the minimum of its\neffective potential.

{"id": "math/0701325", "contents": "Title: Intermutation Abstract: This paper proves coherence results for categories with a natural\ntransformation called \\emph{intermutation} made of arrows from $(A\\wedge\nB)\\vee(C\\wedge D)$ to ${(A\\vee C)\\wedge(B\\vee D)}$, for $\\wedge$ and $\\vee$\nbeing two biendofunctors. Intermutation occurs in iterated, or $n$-fold,\nmonoidal categories, which were introduced in connection with $n$-fold loop\nspaces, and for which a related, but different, coherence result was obtained\npreviously by Balteanu, Fiedorowicz, Schw\\\" anzl and Vogt. The results of the\npresent paper strengthen up to a point this previous result, and show that\ntwo-fold loop spaces arise in the manner envisaged by these authors out of\ncategories of a more general kind, which are not two-fold monoidal in their\nsense. In particular, some categories with finite products and coproducts are\nsuch.\n  Coherence is proved here first for categories where for $\\wedge$ and $\\vee$\none assumes only intermutation, and next for categories where one also assumes\nnatural associativity isomorphisms. Coherence in the sense of coherence for\nsymmetric monoidal categories is proved when one assumes moreover natural\ncommutativity isomorphisms. A restricted coherence result, involving a proviso\nof the kind found in coherence for symmetric monoidal closed categories, is\nproved in the presence of two nonisomorphic unit objects. The coherence\nconditions for intermutation and for the unit objects are derived from a\nunifying principle, which roughly speaking is about preservation of categories\nwith structure by functors up to a natural transformation that is not an\nisomorphism. \n\n"}

It is well known that the symmetric part\ng of B determines a unique (up to an isomorphism) Clifford structure on\n$\\cl(B)$ while the antisymmetric part of B changes the multilinear structure of\n$\\cl(B).$ As an example, we verify Helmstetter's formula which relates Clifford\nproduct in $\\cl(g)$ to the Clifford product in $\\cl(B).$ Experimentation with\nClifford algebras $\\cl(B)$ of a general form~B is highly desirable for physical\nreasons and can be easily done with {\\sc CLIFFORD}.
