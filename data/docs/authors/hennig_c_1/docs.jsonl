We have previously proposed a data mining\nscheme to efficiently discover such patterns which are frequent in the sense\nthat the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the pattern in the data stream\nis above a threshold. Here we propose a method to determine the statistical\nsignificance of these repeating patterns and to set the thresholds\nautomatically. The novelty of our approach is that we use a compound null\nhypothesis that includes not only models of independent neurons but also models\nwhere neurons have weak dependencies. The strength of interaction among the\nneurons is represented in terms of certain pair-wise conditional probabilities.\nWe specify our null hypothesis by putting an upper bound on all such\nconditional probabilities. We construct a probabilistic model that captures the\ncounting process and use this to calculate the mean and variance of the count\nfor any pattern.

A solution of\nthe problem has been proposed. If dwarf galaxies have a core dark matter halo\nwhich has constant density distribution in its center, the effect of dynamical\nfriction will be weakened considerably, and GCs should be able to survive\nbeyond the age of the universe.

In this study,\nI tested whether the solution is reasonable and reconsidered why a constant\ndensity, core halo suppresses dynamical friction, by means of N-body\nsimulations.

Two versions of the\nmodel are studied, one with non-thermal DM as the origin of the boost factor\nand one with Sommerfeld enhancement. In the case of non-thermal DM, four hidden\nsector scalars which transform under a U(1)_{X} symmetry are added. The\nheaviest scalars decouple and later decay to DM scalars, so providing the boost\nfactor necessary to explain the present DM annihilation rate. The mass of the\nannihilating scalars is limited to < 600 GeV for the model to remain\nperturbative. U(1)_{X} breaking to Z_2 at the electroweak transition mixes\nlight O(100) MeV hidden sector scalars with the Higgs.

We discuss the possibility and theoretical aspects\nof using Lyman alpha emission properties of long GRB host galaxies as a\nmetallicity indicator of high redshift GRB environments, where direct\nmetallicity measurements are not easy. We propose to use the fraction of\nLy-alpha emitters (LAEs) in long GRB host galaxies as a function of UV\nluminosity, which can be compared with star-formation-rate weighted LAE\nfraction of Lyman-break galaxies as the standard in the case of no metallicity\ndependence. There are two important effects of metallicity dependence of long\nGRB rate to change the LAE fraction of host galaxies. One is the enhancement of\nintrinsic Ly-alpha equivalent width (EW) by stronger ionizing UV luminosity of\nlow metallicity stellar population, and the other is extinction by interstellar\ndust to change the observable EW. Based on a latest theoretical model of LAEs\nthat reproduce observations, we argue that the latter is likely to work in the\nopposite direction to the former, i.e., to decrease LAE fraction if GRBs\npreferentially occur in low-metallicity environments, because of the clumpy\ninter-stellar medium effect. The high LAE fraction of GRB host galaxies\nindicated by observations is quantitatively be explained by the LAE model if\nGRBs occur when Z < 0.1Z_sun, although this result is still indicative because\nof the limited statistics and theoretical uncertainties.

The inconsistency indicates that there is a serious problem in\nthe map making routine of the WMAP team, and it is necessary to reprocess the\nWMAP data.

After careful evaluation of the X-ray and Non X-ray\nbackground, the 0.4 -- 7 keV X-ray spectrum of the west lobe is described by a\npower-law model. The photon index and 1 keV flux density was derived as\n$1.82_{-0.24}^{+0.26}\\pm0.04$ and $19.4_{-3.2}^{+3.3}\\pm 3.0$ nJy,\nrespectively, where the first and second errors represent the statistical and\nsystematic ones. The diffuse X-rays were attributed to be inverse Compton\nradiation by the synchrotron radio electrons scattering off the cosmic\nmicrowave background photons. This radio galaxy is the largest among those with\nlobes detected through inverse Compton X-ray emission. A comparison of the\nradio to X-ray fluxes yields the energy densities of electron and magnetic\nfield as $u_e = (2.3 \\pm 0.3 \\pm 0.3) \\times 10^{-13}$ ergs/cm3 and $u_m =\n(1.2_{-0.1}^{+0.2}\\pm 0.2) \\times 10^{-14}$ ergs/cm3, respectively. The galaxy\nis suggested to host a low luminosity nucleus with an absorption-corrected 2 --\n10 keV luminosity of $<2 \\times 10^{42}$ ergs/s, together with a relatively\nweak radio core. The energetics in the west lobe of 3C 326 were compared with\nthose of moderate radio galaxies with a size of $\\sim 100$ kpc. The west lobe\nof 3C 326 is confirmed to agree with the correlations for the moderate radio\ngalaxies, $u_e \\propto D^{-2.2\\pm0.4}$ and $u_m \\propto D^{-2.4\\pm0.4}$, where\n$D$ is their total physical size.

The\npresence of baryons produces the concentration of the DM halo with respect to\nits corresponding dissipationless run, but we found that this response does not\nonly depend on the amount of baryons gathered in the central region but also on\nthe way they have been assembled.

Supernova (SN) feedback regulates the star formation\nand triggers galactic outflows not only in the central galaxy but also in its\nsatellites.

We determine integrated radio-to-X-ray\nflux ratios for the galaxies, GRx, which are shown to span a large range\n(factor of 100).

We use a suite of\nN-body simulations to investigate quantitatively the effect of the growth of a\ncentral disk galaxy on the shape of triaxial dark matter halos. As expected,\nthe halo responds to the presence of the disk by becoming more spherical. The\nnet effect depends only weakly on the orientation of the disk relative to the\nhalo principal axes or the timescale of disk assembly, but strongly on the\noverall gravitational importance of the disk.

We improve on previous analyses by allowing\nfor nonzero overall curvature, accurately computing the distance to the\nlast-scattering surface and the observed scale of the Baryon Acoustic peaks,\nand investigating important effects that could arise from having nontrivial\nVoid density profiles. We mainly focus on the WMAP 7-yr data (TT and TE),\nSupernova data (SDSS SN), Hubble constant measurements (HST) and Baryon\nAcoustic Oscillation data (SDSS and LRG). We find that the inclusion of a\nnonzero overall curvature drastically improves the goodness of fit of the Void\nmodel, bringing it very close to that of a homogeneous universe containing Dark\nEnergy, while by varying the profile one can increase the value of the local\nHubble parameter which has been a challenge for these models.

The BH resides in a metal-rich [Fe/H]~0.2 globular cluster. After\nRZ2109 in NGC 4472 this is only the second black-hole X-ray source in a GC\nconfirmed via rapid X-ray variability. Unlike RZ2109, the X-ray spectrum of\nthis BH source did not change during the period of rapid variability. In\naddition to the short-term variability the source also exhibits long-term\nvariability. After being bright for at least a decade since 1993 within a span\nof 2 years it became progressively fainter, and eventually undetectable, or\nmarginally detectable, in deep Chandra and XMM observations.

The long\nterm decline in the luminosity of this object was likely not recognized in\nprevious studies because the rapid variability within the bright epoch\nsuppressed the average luminosity in that integration.

We test closures for the turbulence energy\ncascade by filtering data from high-resolution simulations of forced isothermal\nand adiabatic turbulence. Optimal properties and an excellent correlation are\nfound for a linear combination of the eddy-viscosity closure that is employed\nin LES of weakly compressible turbulence and a term that is non-linear in the\nJacobian matrix of the velocity. Using this mixed closure, the SGS turbulence\nenergy model is validated in LES of turbulence with stochastic forcing. It is\nfound that the SGS model satisfies several important requirements: 1. The mean\nSGS turbulence energy follows a power law for varying grid scale. 2. The root\nmean square (RMS) Mach number of the unresolved velocity fluctuations is\nproportional to the RMS Mach number of the resolved turbulence, independent of\nthe forcing. 3.

Radio observations of \"extreme scattering events\" and \"parabolic arcs\"\nand microwave observations of \"cold dust cirrus\" clouds are observed at 15 - 20\nK temperatures are till now not considered in a unifying picture. Aims: The\ntheory of gravitational hydrodynamics predicts galactic dark matter arises from\nJeans clusters that are made up of almost a trillion micro brown dwarfs (mBDs)\nof earth weight. It is intended to explain the aforementioned anomalous\nobservations and to make predictions within this framework. Methods: We employ\nanalytical isothermal modeling to estimate various effects. Results: Estimates\nof their total number show that they comprise enough mass to constitute the\nmissing baryonic matter. Mysterious radio events are explained by mBD pair\nmerging in the Galaxy. The \"dust\" temperature of cold galaxy halos arises from\na thermostat setting due to a slow release of latent heat at the 14 K gas to\nsolid transition at the mBD surface. The proportionality of the central black\nhole mass of a galaxy and its number of globular clusters is explained.

The partition of gas into different thermal components must itself\ndepend on the star formation rate, since a steady state distribution requires a\nbalance between heating (largely from stellar UV for the atomic component) and\ncooling.

Inefficient fueling (and/or\nfeedback) from fast stellar winds has been invoked to explain this, but we\nargue this is unlikely in bright systems accreting primarily cold dense gas. We\nshow that such a delay can arise even in bright quasars for purely dynamical\nreasons. If some large-scale process produces rapid inflow, smaller scales will\nquickly become gas-dominated. As the gas density peaks, so does the SFR.\nHowever, gravitational torques which govern further inflow are relatively\ninefficient in gas-dominated systems; as more gas is turned into stars, the\nstars provide an efficient angular momentum sink allowing more rapid inflow.\nMoreover, the gas provided to the central regions in mergers or strong disk\ninstabilities will typically be ~100 times larger than that needed to fuel the\nBH; the system is effectively in the 'infinite gas supply' limit. BH growth can\ntherefore continue for some time while the gas supply exhausts, until it has\nsignificantly depleted to the point where the BH is finally 'starved.' Both of\nthese effects act together with comparable magnitude, and mean that the peak of\nBH growth can lag the peak in the SFR measured at a given scale by a timescale\ncorresponding to the gas exhaustion time on that scale (~ 10-100 local\ndynamical times).

Using a multi-scale approach, we investigate the\ndependence of Xco on the galactic environment in numerical simulations of disc\ngalaxies and galaxy mergers. Xco is proportional to the GMC surface density\ndivided by the integrated CO intensity, Wco, and Wco is related to the kinetic\ntemperature and velocity dispersion in the cloud. In disc galaxies (except\nwithin the central ~ kpc), the galactic environment is largely unimportant in\nsetting the physical properties of GMCs provided they are gravitationally\nbound. The temperatures are roughly constant at ~10 K due to the balance of CO\ncooling and cosmic ray heating, giving a nearly constant CO-H2 conversion\nfactor in discs. In mergers, the velocity dispersion of the gas rises\ndramatically during coalescence. The gas temperature also rises as it couples\nwell to the warm (~50 K) dust at high densities (n > 10^4 cm^-3).

We show\nthat in order to explain the high surface brightnesses both the mass accretion\nrate and energy would have to be much higher than expected from simulations or\nfrom equating the star formation with the accretion rate. We also investigate\nscaling relations between the surface brightness expected from accretion and\nfor star formation through mechanical heating and photo-ionization, trying to\nidentify a regime where such accretion may become evident in galaxies.\nUnfortunately, the surface brightness necessary to detect the gas in optical\nline emission is about an order of magnitude lower than what has currently been\nachieved with near-infrared observations of distant galaxies. \n\n"}

The frequency and properties of such fine structures\ndepend on the main acting mechanisms - secular evolution, minor or major\nmergers - and on the age of the last substantial accretion event. We use this\nto constrain the mass assembly history of two apparently relaxed nearby\nEarly-Type Galaxies (ETGs) selected from the Atlas-3D sample, NGC 680 and NGC\n5557. Our ultra deep optical images obtained with MegaCam on the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope reach 29 mag/arcsec^2 in the g-band. They reveal\nvery low-surface brightness (LSB) filamentary structures around these\nellipticals. Among them, a gigantic 160 kpc long tail East of NGC 5557 hosts\ngas-rich star-forming objects. NGC 680 exhibits two major diffuse plumes\napparently connected to extended HI tails, as well as a series of arcs and\nshells. Comparing the outer stellar and gaseous morphology of the two\nellipticals with that predicted from models of colliding galaxies, we argue\nthat the LSB features are tidal debris, the star-forming objects near NGC 5557,\nlong lived Tidal Dwarf Galaxies and that each of the two ETGs was assembled\nduring a relatively recent, major wet merger, which likely occurred at a\nredshift below z = 0.5.

If the early Universe contained only\nthe known standard-model particles ($g\\approx 100$), then the energy density at\nthe big bounce was about 15 times larger than the Planck energy.

We find that black hole growth is strongly\ncorrelated with nuclear (r<1 kpc) star formation, but only weakly correlated\nwith extended (r>1 kpc) star formation in the host galaxy. In particular, the\nnuclear star-formation rate (SFR) traced by the 11.3 micron aromatic feature\nfollows a relationship with the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) of the form\nSFR\\proptoBHAR^0.8, with an observed scatter of 0.5 dex.

This is significantly lower than for relaxed\nLCDM haloes, which have an average spin parameter <\\lambda'_halo> = 0.031. The\naverage ratio between the specific angular momentum of disk galaxies and their\nhost dark matter haloes is therefore R_j = \\lambda'_gal/\\lambda'_halo =\n0.61^{+0.13}_{-0.10}. This calls into question a standard assumption made in\nthe majority of all (semi-analytical) models for (disc) galaxy formation,\nnamely that R_j=1. Using simple disc formation models we show that it is\nparticularly challenging to understand why R_j is independent of halo mass,\nwhile the galaxy formation efficiency (\\epsilon_GF, proportional to the ratio\nof galaxy mass to halo mass) reveals a strong halo mass dependence. We argue\nthat the empirical scaling relations between \\epsilon_GF, R_j and halo mass\nrequire both feedback (i.e., galactic outflows) and angular momentum transfer\nfrom the baryons to the dark matter (i.e., dynamical friction). The efficiency\nof angular momentum loss need to decrease with increasing halo mass. Such a\nmass dependence may reflect a bias against forming stable discs in high mass,\nlow spin haloes or a transition from cold-mode accretion in low mass haloes to\nhot-mode accretion at the massive end. However, current hydrodynamical\nsimulations of galaxy formation, which should include these processes, seem\nunable to reproduce the empirical relation between \\epsilon_GF and R_j.

This is closely related to\nthe fact that correlation functions can only depend on the de Sitter invariant\ndistances. These properties follow from the isometries of the inflationary de\nSitter space and are thus completely independent of the dynamics.

The conformal invariance of correlators can be directly checked in\nFourier space, as we show in an explicit example.

The basic principle is that, even in rather shallow\nsurveys, substantial information on cluster redshift and temperature is present\nin the raw X-ray data and can be statistically extracted; in parallel, such\ndiagrams can be readily predicted from an ab initio cosmological modeling. We\nillustrate the methodology for the case of a 100 deg2 XMM survey having a\nsensitivity of ~10^{-14} ergs/s/cm^2 and fit at the same time, the survey\nselection function, the cluster evolutionary scaling-relations and the\ncosmology; our sole assumption -- driven by the limited size of the sample\nconsidered in the case-study -- is that the local cluster scaling relations are\nknown.

We find that the CMB peaks can be affected in three\nindependent ways provided the Compton radius of the massive scalar is not\nfar-off the sound horizon at last scattering. When the coupling of the massive\nscalar to Cold Dark Matter (CDM) is large, the anomalous growth of the CDM\nperturbation inside the Compton radius induces a change in the peak amplitudes.\nWhen the coupling to baryons is moderately large, the speed of sound is\nmodified and the peaks shifted to higher momenta.

We\nanalytically show that observations of piecewise-spiral fronts impose strong\nconstraints on the CC, implying the presence of a cold, fast flow, which\npropagates below a hot, slow inflow, separated by a slowly rotating, trailing,\nquasi spiral, tangential discontinuity surface. This leads to the nearly\nlogarithmic spiral pattern, two-phase plasma, \\rho \\sim r^{-1} density (or T\n\\sim r^{0.4} temperature) radial profile, and ~100kpc size, characteristic of\nCCs.

Most of the individual\nspectra are drawn from our ongoing survey in the GOODS fields with the Keck\nDEIMOS spectrograph, and we have augmented our sample with published data taken\nwith FORS2 on the VLT.

Specifically, we find low-ionization\nabsorption lines which trace the presence of neutral outflowing gas are weaker\nin galaxies with stronger Lyman-alpha emission, bluer UV spectral slopes, lower\nstellar masses, lower UV luminosities and smaller half-light radii. This is\nconsistent with a physical picture whereby star formation drives outflows of\nneutral gas which scatters Lyman-alpha and gives rise to strong low-ionization\nabsorption lines, while increasing the stellar mass, size, metallicity, and\ndust content of galaxies. Typical galaxies are thus expected to have stronger\nLyman-alpha emission and weaker low-ionization absorption at earlier times\n(higher redshifts).

The spheroidal\ncomponent is composed mainly by old, metal-poor and {\\alpha}-enhanced stars.\nThe distribution of metals in this component shows, however, a clear bimodality\nwith a low-metallicity peak, which could be related to a classical bulge, and a\nhigh-metallicity peak, which could be related to a pseudo-bulge. The thin disc\nappears in our simulations as the youngest and most metal-rich component. The\nradial distribution of ages and colours in this component are U-shaped: the new\nstars are forming in the inner regions, and then migrate through secular\nprocesses. Finally, we also find a thick disc containing about 16% of the total\nstellar mass and with properties that are intermediate between those of the\nthin disc and the spheroid. Its low-metallicity stars are {\\alpha}-enhanced\nwhen compared to thin disc stars of the same metallicity. The structural\nparameters (e.g., the scale height) of the simulated thick discs suggest that\nsuch a component could result from the combination of different thickening\nmechanisms that include merger-driven processes, but also long-lived internal\nperturbations of the thin disc.

Our\nfiducial model assumes an efficiency of ~0.5 per dynamical time for the decay\nof turbulence energy, and ~0.02 for each of the processes that deplete the disc\ngas, i.e., star formation, outflow, and inflow within the disc into a central\nbulge. In this case, the in-streaming drives a ratio of turbulent to rotation\nvelocity sigma/V~0.2-0.3, which at z~2 induces an instability with Q~1, both as\nobserved. However, in conflict with observations, this model predicts that\nsigma/V remains constant with time, independent of the cosmological accretion\nrate, because mass and turbulence have the same external source. Such strongly\ncoupled cosmological inflow tends to stabilize the disc at low z, with Q ~ a\nfew, which may be consistent with observations.

Alternatively, the coupling between the\nin-streaming gas and the disc may weaken in time, reflecting an evolving nature\nof the accretion. If, instead, that coupling is weak at all times, the likely\nenergy source for self-regulated stirring up of the turbulence is the inflow\nwithin the disc down the potential gradient (studied in a companion paper). \n\n"}

At these early times, the Universe was dense and hot enough\nthat complete thermal equilibrium between baryonic matter (electrons and ions)\nand photons could be established. Any perturbation away from the blackbody\nspectrum was suppressed exponentially. New physics, for example annihilation\nand decay of dark matter, can add energy and photons to CMB at redshifts z>10^5\nand result in a Bose-Einstein spectrum with a non-zero chemical potential\n($\\mu$). Precise evolution of the CMB spectrum around the critical redshift of\nz~2x10^6 is required in order to calculate the $\\mu$-type spectral distortion\nand constrain the underlying new physics. Although numerical calculation of\nimportant processes involved (double Compton process, comptonization and\nbremsstrahlung) is not difficult, analytic solutions are much faster and easier\nto calculate and provide valuable physical insights. We provide precise (better\nthan 1%) analytic solutions for the decay of $\\mu$, created at an earlier\nepoch, including all three processes, double Compton, Compton scattering on\nthermal electrons and bremsstrahlung in the limit of small distortions.

{"id": "1205.0253", "contents": "Title: The Radius of Baryonic Collapse in Disc Galaxy Formation Abstract: In the standard picture of disc galaxy formation, baryons and dark matter\nreceive the same tidal torques, and therefore approximately the same initial\nspecific angular momentum. However, observations indicate that disc galaxies\ntypically have only about half as much specific angular momentum as their dark\nmatter haloes. We argue this does not necessarily imply that baryons lose this\nmuch specific angular momentum as they form galaxies. It may instead indicate\nthat galaxies are most directly related to the inner regions of their host\nhaloes, as may be expected in a scenario where baryons in the inner parts of\nhaloes collapse first. A limiting case is examined under the idealised\nassumption of perfect angular momentum conservation. Namely, we determine the\ndensity contrast Delta, with respect to the critical density of the Universe,\nby which dark matter haloes need to be defined in order to have the same\naverage specific angular momentum as the galaxies they host. Under the\nassumption that galaxies are related to haloes via their characteristic\nrotation velocities, the necessary Delta is ~600. This Delta corresponds to an\naverage halo radius and mass which are ~60% and ~75%, respectively, of the\nvirial values (i.e., for Delta = 200). We refer to this radius as the radius of\nbaryonic collapse R_BC, since if specific angular momentum is conserved\nperfectly, baryons would come from within it. It is not likely a simple step\nfunction due to the complex gastrophysics involved, therefore we regard it as\nan effective radius. In summary, the difference between the predicted initial\nand the observed final specific angular momentum of galaxies, which is\nconventionally attributed solely to angular momentum loss, can more naturally\nbe explained by a preference for collapse of baryons within R_BC, with possibly\nsome later angular momentum transfer. \n\n"}

Galactic outflows driven by supernovae/stellar winds are the\nleading mechanism for explaining this fact. The scaling relation between galaxy\nmass and outer rotation velocity (also known as the baryonic Tully-Fisher\nrelation, BTF) has recently been used as evidence against this viewpoint. We\nuse a LCDM based semi-analytic disk galaxy formation model to investigate these\nclaims. In our model, galaxies with less efficient star formation and higher\ngas fractions are more efficient at ejecting gas from galaxies. This is due to\nthe fact that galaxies with less efficient star formation and higher gas\nfractions tend to live in dark matter haloes with lower circular velocities,\nfrom which less energy is required to escape the potential well. In our model\nthe intrinsic scatter in the BTF is 0.15 dex, and mostly reflects scatter in\ndark halo concentration. The observed scatter, equal to 0.24 dex, is dominated\nby measurement errors. The best estimate for the intrinsic scatter is that it\nis less than 0.15 dex, and thus our LCDM based model (which does not include\nall possible sources of scatter) is only just consistent with this. In our\nmodel, gas rich galaxies, at fixed virial velocity (V_vir), with lower stellar\nmasses have lower baryonic masses. This is consistent with the expectation that\ngalaxies with lower stellar masses have had less energy available to drive an\noutflow. However, when the outer rotation velocity (V_flat) is used the\ncorrelation has the opposite sign, with a slope in agreement with observations.\nThis is due to scatter in the relation between V_flat and V_vir. In summary,\ncontrary to some previous claims, we show that basic features of the BTF are\nconsistent with a LCDM based model in which the low efficiency of galaxy\nformation is determined by galactic outflows. \n\n"}

Satellites, though, have higher\ngas-phase metallicities than equally massive centrals, and this difference\nincreases with decreasing M_*. We also find that the gas-phase metallicity of\nsatellites increases with halo mass at fixed stellar mass. This increment is\nmore pronounced for less massive galaxies. We also show that low mass satellite\ngalaxies have higher gas-phase metallicities than central galaxies of the same\nstellar metallicity.

An equilibrium model would fix the gravitational and\ntransverse Doppler velocity shifts to be about 6sigma^2/c and 3sigma^2/2c in\norder to fit the observed velocity dispersion sigma self-consistently. This\nresult comes from the Virial Theorem for a spherical isotropic cluster, and is\ninsensitive to the theory of gravity.

Hence, the Bondi accretion cannot be used in\nthese cases, such as in the galaxy NGC 3115. The winds of these high-velocity\nstars are shocked to temperatures above the virial temperature of the galaxy,\nleading to the formation of a hot bubble of size ~0.1-10 pc near the center.\nThis hot bubble can substantially reduce the mass accretion rate by the SMBH.\nIf the density of the hot bubble is lower than that of the interstellar medium\n(ISM), a density-inversion layer is formed. As the gas loses energy by X-ray\nradiation, eventually more mass of the cooling shocked stellar winds will be\naccreted to the SMBH. This accretion will be of cold clumps. After a period of\nmillions of years of low AGN activity, therefore, a stronger AGN activity will\noccur that will heat and expel gas, much as in cooling flow clusters.

Our study is conducted from the perspective of a user of\nthe models, who has observational data in hand and seeks to convert them into\nphysical quantities. Stellar population models for galaxies are created by\nsynthesizing star formations histories and chemical enrichments using single\nstellar populations from several groups (Starburst99, GALAXEV, Maraston2005,\nGALEV).

We\ncompare three WDM models with a dark matter mass of 0.5, 0.75 and 2.0 keV, with\nthe standard Cold Dark Matter case. For a fixed set of parameters describing\nthe baryonic physics the WDM models predict less galaxies at low (stellar)\nmasses, as expected due to the suppression of power on small scales, while no\nsubstantial difference is found at the high mass end. However these differences\nin the stellar mass function, vanish when different set of parameters are used\nto describe the (largely unknown) galaxy formation processes.

In particular, it enables us to compute the\ncurvature perturbation, {\\zeta}, on large scales without actually solving\nperturbed field equations. However, people often wonder why this is the case.\nIn order for this approach to be valid, the perturbed Hamiltonian constraint\nand matter-field equations on large scales must, with a suitable choice of\ncoordinates, take on the same forms as the corresponding unperturbed equations.\nWe find that this is possible when (1) the unperturbed metric is given by a\nhomogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric; and (2)\non large scales and with a suitable choice of coordinates, one can ignore the\nshift vector (g0i) as well as time-dependence of tensor perturbations to\ngij/a2(t) of the perturbed metric.

In its\nsimplest realization, an SU(2) gauge field is assumed to begin inflation in a\nrotationally invariant VEV. The dynamics of the gauge fields significantly\nmodifies the equations of motion for the axion, providing an additional damping\nterm that supports slow-roll inflation, without the need to fine tune the axion\ndecay constant. We demonstrate that in an appropriate slow-roll limit it is\npossible to integrate out the massive gauge field fluctuations whilst still\nmaintaining the nontrivial modifications of the gauge field to the axion. In\nthis slow-roll limit, chromo-natural inflation is exactly equivalent to a\nsingle scalar field effective theory with a non-minimal kinetic term, i.e. a\nP(X,\\chi) model. This occurs through a precise analogue of the gelaton\nmechanism, whereby heavy fields can have unsuppressed effects on the light\nfield dynamics without contradicting decoupling. The additional damping effect\nof the gauge fields can be completely captured by the non-minimal kinetic term\nof the single scalar field effective theory. We utilize the single scalar field\neffective theory to infer the power spectrum and non-gaussianities in\nchromo-natural inflation and confirm that the mass squared of all the gauge\nfield fluctuations is sufficiently large and positive that they completely\ndecouple during inflation. These results confirm that chromo-natural inflation\nis a viable, stable and compelling model for the generation of inflationary\nperturbations. \n\n"}

This assumption has been confirmed by\nSZ signal detection in hundreds of clusters but, in comparison with the huge\nnumbers of clusters within optically selected samples from Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) data, this only accounts for a few per cent of clusters. Here we\nintroduce a model-independent new method to confirm the assumption that most\ngalaxy clusters can offer the thermal SZ signal as their main foreground\neffect. For the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) seven-year data\n(and a given galaxy cluster sample), we introduced a parameter d1 as the\nnearest-neighbour cluster angular distance of each pixel, then we classified\ndata pixels as 'to be' (d1--> 0 case) or 'not to be' (d1 large enough) affected\nby the sample clusters.

We\nfind that the Planck Early Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (ESZ) sample and X-ray samples\n(~10^2 clusters) can lead to obvious temperature depression in the WMAP\nseven-year data, which confirms the SZ effect prediction. However, each\noptically selected sample (>10^4 clusters) shows an opposite result: the mean\ntemperature rises to about 10uK. This unexpected qualitative scenario implies\nthat the main foreground effect of most clusters is $not$ always the expected\nSZ effect.

It can be\nmany times larger than the Newtonian force and their ratio is in principle\nunbound. This is very different from the case in halos, where the fifth force\nis no more than 1/3 of gravity. The evolution of voids is governed by the\nNewtonian gravity, the effective dark energy force and the fifth force. While\nthe first two forces are common in both LCDM and chameleon universes, the fifth\nforce is unique to the latter. Driven by the outward-pointing fifth force,\nindividual voids in chameleon models expand faster and grow larger than in a\nLCDM universe. The expansion velocity of the void shell can be 20% to 30%\nlarger for voids of a few Mpc/h in radius, while their sizes can be larger by\n~10%. These differences are smaller for larger voids of the same density.

We select snapshot redshifts such that the linear matter power spectra\nof different gravity models are identical, in order to isolate the impact of\ngravity beyond modifying the linear growth rate. At the baseline redshift\ncorresponding to z_S=1.2 in the standard \\Lambda CDM, for a 10% deviation from\nGR(|\\zeta-1|=0.1), the measured halo mass function can differ by about 5-10%,\nthe halo concentration by about 10-20%, while the halo bias differs\nsignificantly less. These results demonstrate that the halo mass function\nand/or the halo concentration are sensitive to the nature of gravity and may be\nused to make interesting constraints along this line. \n\n"}

A volume limited sample of 6,150 galaxies is classified to determine\nemission features, morphological type and presence of a disk. This sample\nallows for characteristics of galaxies to be isolated (e.g. stellar mass and\ngroup halo mass), and their codependencies determined.\n  We observe that galaxy-galaxy interactions play the most important role in\nshaping the evolution within a group halo, the main role of halo mass is in\ngathering the galaxies together to encourage such interactions. Dominant pair\ngalaxies find their overall star formation enhanced when the pair's mass ratio\nis close to 1, otherwise we observe the same galaxies as we would in an\nunpaired system. The minor galaxy in a pair is greatly affected by its\ncompanion galaxy, and whilst the star forming fraction is always suppressed\nrelative to equivalent stellar mass unpaired galaxies, it becomes lower still\nwhen the mass ratio of a pair system increases.\n  We find that, in general, the close galaxy-galaxy interaction rate drops as a\nfunction of halo mass for a given amount of stellar mass. We find evidence of a\nlocal peak of interactions for Milky-Way stellar mass galaxies in Milky-Way\nhalo mass groups. Low mass halos, and in particular Local Group mass halos, are\nan important environment for understanding the typical evolutionary path of a\nunit of stellar mass.\n  We find compelling evidence for galaxy conformity in both groups and pairs,\nwhere morphological type conformity is dominant in groups, and emission class\nconformity is dominant in pairs.

We verify that our method reproduces published results for\ncollisional equilibrium, collisional non-equilibrium, and photo-ionised\nequilibrium. Non-equilibrium effects can become very important in cooling gas,\nparticularly below 10^6 K. Photo-ionisation and non-equilibrium effects both\ntend to boost the degree of ionisation and to reduce cooling efficiencies. The\neffect of the EGB is larger for lower densities. Hence, photo-ionisation\naffects cooling more under isochoric than under isobaric conditions.\nNon-equilibrium effects are smaller in the presence of the EGB and are thus\noverestimated when using collisional-only processes.

We\npresent Chandra observations for four new GALEX-selected LBAs. Including\npreviously studied LBAs, Haro 11 and VV 114, we find that LBAs demonstrate\nL_X/SFR ratios that are elevated by ~1.5sigma compared to local galaxies,\nsimilar to the ratios found for stacked LBGs in the early Universe (z>2). We\nshow that these LBAs are unlikely to harbor AGN, based on their optical and\nX-ray spectra and the spatial distribution of the X-rays in three spatially\nextended cases. We expect that high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) dominate the\nX-ray emission in these galaxies, based on their high specific SFRs\n(sSFRs=SFR/M* > 10^{-9}/yr), which suggest the prevalence of young stellar\npopulations. Since both LBAs and LBGs have lower dust attenuations and\nmetallicities compared to similar samples of more typical local galaxies, we\ninvestigate the effects of dust extinction and metallicity on the L_X/SFR for\nthe broader population of galaxies with high sSFRs (>10^{-10}/yr). The\nestimated dust extinctions (corresponding to column densities of\nN_H<10^{22}/cm^2) are expected to have insignificant effects on observed\nL_X/SFR ratio for the majority of galaxy samples. We find that the observed\nrelationship between L_X/SFR and metallicity appears consistent with\ntheoretical expectations from X-ray binary population synthesis models.\nTherefore, we conclude that lower metallicities, related to more luminous HMXBs\nsuch as ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), drive the elevated L_X/SFR observed\nin our sample of z<0.1 LBAs. The relatively metal-poor, active mode of star\nformation in LBAs and distant z>2 LBGs may yield higher total HMXB luminosity\nthan found in typical galaxies in the local Universe. \n\n"}

The low redshift of the lens\n(z_lens=0.035) results in arcs being formed at a small fraction of the\neffective radius, (R_Ein ~ R_Eff/4). At such small radii, stars dominate the\nlensing mass, so that lensing provides a direct probe of the stellar\nmass-to-light ratio, with only small corrections needed for dark matter. The\nredshift of the galaxy lensed by ESO325-G004 was unknown until now, so the\nlensing mass was not securely determined. Using X-SHOOTER, we measure a secure\nsource redshift of z_src=2.141. Combined with the lensing configuration, this\nyields a total mass inside the Einstein radius of (1.50+/-0.06) 10^11 M_sun. We\nestimate the range of possible contribution of dark matter to the lensing mass,\nusing statistics from cosmological N-body simulations.

Moreover, group galaxies show a mean SFR\nlower than other environments up to z~1, while at earlier epochs group and\nfield galaxies exhibit consistent levels of star formation (SF) activity. We\nfind that processes related to a massive dark matter halo must be dominant in\nthe suppression of the SF below z~1, with respect to purely density-related\nprocesses.

At all redshifts, Tdust increases with infrared luminosities\n(LIR), specific SFRs (SSFR; i.e., SFR/M*) and distances with respect to the\nmain sequence (MS) of the SFR-M* plane (i.e.,\nD_SSFR_MS=log[SSFR(galaxy)/SSFR_MS(M*,z)]). The Tdust-SSFR and Tdust-D_SSFR_MS\ncorrelations are statistically more significant than the Tdust-LIR one. While\nthe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, their\nnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. We convert these results into a recipe\nto derive Tdust from SFR, M* and z. The existence of a strong Tdust-D_SSFR_MS\ncorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content of\ngalaxies. (i) The slope of the Tdust-D__SSFR_MS correlation can be explained by\nthe increase of the star-formation efficiency (SFE; SFR/Mgas) with D_SSFR_MS as\nfound locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) At fixed D_SSFR_MS, the constant\nTdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in SFR and M* can be explained\nby an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions with\ncomparable SFE enclosed in them. (iii) At high redshift, the normalization\ntowards hotter temperature of the Tdust-D_SSFR_MS correlation can be explained\nby the decrease of the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase of the SFE\nof MS galaxies.

Using a simple analytic\nmodel for the fluctuations predicted in simulations, we estimate the\nrate-of-formation and mass function of self-gravitating, rapidly-collapsing\nplanetesimal-mass bodies formed by this mechanism. The statistics of this\nprocess depend sensitively on the size/stopping time of the grains, disk\nsurface density, and turbulent Mach numbers.

Collapse to planetesimal through super-Earth\nmasses is possible. The key condition is that grain density fluctuations reach\nlarge amplitudes on large scales, where gravitational instability proceeds most\neasily (collapse of small grains is strongly suppressed by turbulent\nvorticity). We show this leads to a new criterion for 'pebble-pile' formation\nin terms of the dimensionless particle stopping time (tau_stop > f(Q,Z,alpha)).\nIn a MMSN, this requires grains larger than a=(50,1,0.1)cm at r=(1,30,100)au.\nAt small radii, it would depend on the existence of large boulders.

Planned large galaxy\nsurveys such as the Large Synoptic Sky Telescope (LSST) and Euclid are expected\nto measure the sum of neutrino masses to extremely high precision, sufficient\nto detect non-zero neutrino masses even in the minimal mass normal hierarchy.\nWe show that weak lensing of galaxies while being a very good probe of neutrino\nmasses, is extremely sensitive to baryonic feedback processes. We use publicly\navailable results from the Overwhelmingly Large Simulations (OWLS) project to\ninvestigate the effects of active galactic nuclei feedback, the nature of the\nstellar initial mass function, and gas cooling rates, on the measured weak\nlensing shear power spectrum. Using the Fisher matrix formalism and priors from\nCMB+BAO data, we show that when one does not account for feedback, the measured\nneutrino mass may be substantially larger or smaller than the true mass,\ndepending on the dominant feedback mechanism, with the mass error |\\Delta m_nu|\noften exceeding the mass m_nu itself.

In this paper, we perform a set of hydrodynamical simulations of mergers\nof two galaxy clusters to investigate the spatial offset between the maxima of\nthe X-ray and the SZ surface brightness of the merging clusters. We find that\nsignificantly large SZ-X-ray offsets (>100kpc) can be produced during the major\nmergers of galaxy clusters. The significantly large offsets are mainly caused\nby a `jump effect' occurred between the primary and secondary pericentric\npassages of the two merging clusters, during which the X-ray peak may jump to\nthe densest gas region located near the center of the small cluster, but the SZ\npeak remains near the center of the large one. Our simulations show that\nmerging systems with higher masses and larger initial relative velocities may\nresult in larger offset sizes and longer offset time durations; and only nearly\nhead-on mergers are likely to produce significantly large offsets. We further\ninvestigate the statistical distribution of the SZ-X-ray offset sizes and find\nthat (1) the number distribution of the offset sizes is bimodal with one peak\nlocated at low offsets ~0 and the other at large offsets ~350-450kpc/h, but the\nobjects with intermediate offsets are scarce; and (2) the probabilities of the\nclusters in the mass range higher than 2x10^{14}Msun/h that have offsets larger\nthan 20, 50, 200, 300, and 500kpc/h are 34.0%, 11.1%, 8.0%, 6.5%, and 2.0%\nrespectively at z=0.7.

The simulations are analyzed with a\nLarge Velocity Gradient (LVG) model to compute the local emission in various\nmolecular lines in each resolution element, radiation transfer and opacity\neffects, and the intensity emerging from galaxies, to generate synthetic\nspectra for various transitions of the CO molecule. This model reproduces the\nknown properties of CO spectra and CO-to-H2 conversion factors in nearby\nspirals and starbursting major mergers. The high excitation of CO lines in\nmergers is dominated by an excess of high-density gas, and the high turbulent\nvelocities and compression that create this dense gas excess result in broad\nlinewidths and low CO intensity-to-H2 mass ratios. When applied to\nhigh-redshift gas-rich disks galaxies, the same model predicts that their\nCO-to-H2 conversion factor is almost as high as in nearby spirals, and much\nhigher than in starbursting mergers.

Such\nsolitons should be ubiquitous in models of axion dark matter, with the soliton\ncharacteristic mass and size depending on some inverse power of the axion mass.\nStable configurations of non-relativistic axions are studied numerically using\nthe Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Poisson system. This method, and the resulting soliton\ndensity profiles, are reviewed. Using a scaling symmetry and the uncertainty\nprinciple, the core size of the soliton can be related to the central density\nand axion mass, $m_a$, in a universal way. Solitons have a constant central\ndensity due to pressure-support, unlike the cuspy profile of cold dark matter\n(CDM). One consequence of this fact is that solitons composed of ultra-light\naxions (ULAs) may resolve the `cusp-core' problem of CDM. In DM halos,\nthermodynamics will lead to a CDM-like Navarro-Frenk-White profile at large\nradii, with a central soliton core at small radii.

On the other hand, nonparametric models have a very flexible\nstructure, but they suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality and are not\npractical for high-dimensional systems.

In this picture, dark matter halos of disk galaxies not only cool via\ndissipative interactions but are also heated via ordinary supernovae\n(facilitated by an assumed photon - dark photon kinetic mixing interaction).\nThis interaction between the dark matter halo and ordinary baryons, a very\nspecial feature of these types of models, plays a critical role in governing\nthe physical properties of the dark matter halo. Here, we further study the\nimplications of this type of dissipative dark matter for disk galaxies.\nBuilding on earlier work, we develop a simple formalism which aims to describe\nthe effects of dissipative dark matter in a fairly model independent way.

For the MG formalism applied to the\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, this gives an extra\ndynamical term encapsulated as an averaging density parameter denoted\n$\\Omega_A$. An exact isotropic cosmological solution of MG for the flat FLRW\nmetric is already known in the literature, we derive here an anisotropic exact\nsolution. Using the isotropic solution, we compare the expansion history to\ncurrent data of distances to supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, CMB last\nscattering surface, and Hubble constant measurements, and find $-0.05 \\le\n\\Omega_A \\le 0.07$ (at the 95% CL). For the flat metric case this reduces to\n$-0.03 \\le \\Omega_A \\le 0.05$. We also find that the inclusion of this term in\nthe fits can shift the values of the usual cosmological parameters by a few to\nseveral percents. Next, we derive an equation for the growth rate of large\nscale structure in MG that includes a term due to the averaging and compare it\nto that of the LCDM concordance model. We find that an $\\Omega_A$ of an\namplitude range within the bounds above leads to a relative deviation of the\ngrowth from that of the LCDM of up to 2-4% at late times. Thus, the shift in\nthe growth could be of comparable amplitude to that caused by similar changes\nin cosmological parameters like the dark energy density parameter or its\nequation of state.

However, these methods are\nknown to produce poor results on idealized test problems, particularly at late\ntimes, after the particle trajectories have crossed. To investigate this, we\nhave performed a series of one- and two-dimensional \"Zel'dovich Pancake\"\ncalculations using the popular Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method. We find that PIC\ncan indeed converge on these problems provided the following modifications are\nmade. The first modification is to regularize the singular initial distribution\nfunction by introducing a small but finite artificial velocity dispersion. This\nprocess is analogous to artificial viscosity in compressible gas dynamics, and,\nas with artificial viscosity, the amount of regularization can be tailored so\nthat its effect outside of a well-defined region - in this case, the\nhigh-density caustics - is small.

To recognize discriminative and\nnoise dimensions, these variables are considered to be linear combinations of\ntwo independent sets of second-order latent variables where only one contains\nthe information about the cluster structure while the other contains noise\ndimensions. The model specification involves multidimensional integrals that\nmake the maximum likelihood estimation cumbersome and in some cases infeasible.\nTo overcome this issue the parameter estimation is carried out through an\nEM-like algorithm maximizing a pairwise log-likelihood. Examples of application\nof the model on real and simulated data are performed to show the effectiveness\nof the proposal. \n\n"}

Einstein's theory of General Relativity (GR) has been tested\naccurately within the local universe i.e. the Solar System, but this leaves the\npossibility open that it is not a good description of gravity at the largest\nscales in the Universe. This being said, the standard model of cosmology\nassumes GR on all scales. In 1998, astronomers made the surprising discovery\nthat the expansion of the Universe is accelerating, not slowing down. This\nlate-time acceleration of the Universe has become the most challenging problem\nin theoretical physics. Within the framework of GR, the acceleration would\noriginate from an unknown dark energy. Alternatively, it could be that there is\nno dark energy and GR itself is in error on cosmological scales.

Abstract: Scale-dependent halo bias due to local primordial non-Gaussianity provides a\nstrong test of single-field inflation. While it is universally understood that\nsingle-field inflation predicts negligible scale-dependent bias compared to\ncurrent observational uncertainties, there is still disagreement on the exact\nlevel of scale-dependent bias at a level that could strongly impact inferences\nmade from future surveys. In this paper, we clarify this confusion and derive\nin various ways that there is exactly zero scale-dependent bias in single-field\ninflation. Much of the current confusion follows from the fact that\nsingle-field inflation does predict a mode coupling of matter perturbations at\nthe level of $f_{NL}^{loc} \\approx -5/3$, which naively would lead to\nscale-dependent bias. However, we show explicitly that this mode coupling\ncancels out when perturbations are evaluated at a fixed physical scale rather\nthan fixed coordinate scale. Furthermore, we show how the absence of\nscale-dependent bias can be derived easily in any gauge. This result can then\nbe incorporated into a complete description of the observed galaxy clustering,\nincluding the previously studied general relativistic terms, which are\nimportant at the same level as scale-dependent bias of order $f_{NL}^{loc} \\sim\n1$. This description will allow us to draw unbiased conclusions about inflation\nfrom future galaxy clustering data. \n\n"}

Quasi-single-field (QsF) inflation is a relatively simple family of\nphenomenological models that serve as a proxy for theories with additional\nfields with masses $m\\sim H$. Since QsF inflation involves fields in addition\nto the inflaton, the consistency conditions (ccs) between correlations that\narise in single-clock inflation are not necessarily satisfied. As a result,\ncorrelation functions in the squeezed limit may be larger than in single-field\ninflation. Scalar non-Gaussianities mediated by the massive isocurvature field\nin QsF have been shown to be potentially observable. These are especially\ninteresting since they would convey information about the mass of the\nisocurvature field. Here we consider non-Gaussian correlators involving tensor\nmodes and their observational signatures. A physical correlation between a\n(long-wavelength) tensor mode and two scalar modes (tss), for instance, may\ngive rise to local departures from statistical isotropy or, in other words, a\nnon-trivial four-point function.

However, numerical simulations of\nisothermal turbulent fragmentation thus far have not succeeded in identifying a\nfragment mass scale that is independent of the simulation resolution. Moreover,\nthe fluid equations for magnetized, self-gravitating, isothermal turbulence are\nscale-free, and do not predict any characteristic mass. In this paper we show\nthat, although an isothermal self-gravitating flow does produce a CMF with a\nmass scale imposed by the initial conditions, this scale changes as the parent\ncloud evolves.

However the inclusion of string loop\ncorrections to the Kahler potential gives rise to a parameter space region\nwhere the decay channel to SUSY scalars opens up, leading to a significant\nreduction of dark radiation production. In this case, the simplest model with a\nshift-symmetric Higgs sector can suppress the excess of dark radiation $\\Delta\nN_{eff}$ to values as small as 0.14, in perfect agreement with current\nexperimental bounds. Depending on the exact mass of the SUSY scalars all values\nin the range 0.14 $\\lesssim \\Delta N_{eff} \\lesssim$ 1.6 are allowed.\nInterestingly dark radiation overproduction can be avoided also in the absence\nof a Giudice-Masiero coupling. \n\n"}

The high redshift universe offers a powerful probe of\ntheir parameters.

In particular, the cross-correlations between a\nbright and a faint population of galaxies contain also a dipole. In this paper\nwe present the first attempt to measure this dipole. We discuss the four types\nof effects that contribute to the dipole: relativistic distortions, evolution\neffect, wide-angle effect and large-angle effect. We show that the first three\ncontributions are intrinsic anti-symmetric contributions that do not depend on\nthe choice of angle used to measure the dipole.

Unfortunately, standard\nestimators of mixture parameters, like the MLE, are known to exhibit\npathological behavior.

Our direct simulations differ substantially from\nstripping models employed in current SAMs, which in most cases overpredict the\nmass loss from RPS.

In the first method we\nfind the global best fit halo function (we prove that it is a unique piecewise\nconstant function with a number of down steps smaller than or equal to a\nmaximum number that we compute) and construct a two-sided pointwise confidence\nband at any desired confidence level, which can then be compared with those\nderived from the extended likelihood alone to assess the joint compatibility of\nthe data.

In the case of uni-modal densities, Warp-I, II, and\nIII transformations (Meng and Schilling, 2002) are effective for increasing the\ninitial overlap, but they are less so for multi-modal densities. This paper\nintroduces Warp-U transformations that aim to transform multi-modal densities\ninto Uni-modal ones without altering their normalizing constants. The\nconstruction of a Warp-U transformation starts with a Normal (or other\nconvenient) mixture distribution $\\phi_{\\text{mix}}$ that has reasonable\noverlap with the target density $p$, whose normalizing constant is unknown. The\nstochastic transformation that maps $\\phi_{\\text{mix}}$ back to its generating\ndistribution $N(0,1)$ is then applied to $p$ yielding its Warp-U version, which\nwe denote $\\tilde{p}$.

To do so, we\nquantify the azimuthal dependence of the stacked lensing signal around seven\ndifferent proxies for the orientation of the dark matter distribution, as it is\na priori unknown which one traces the orientation best. On small scales, the\nmajor axis of the brightest group/cluster member (BCG) provides the best proxy,\nleading to a clear detection of an anisotropic signal.

Modeling the signal with an elliptical\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile on scales < 250 kpc, which roughly\ncorresponds to half the virial radius, and assuming that the BCG is perfectly\naligned with the dark matter, we find an average halo ellipticity of e_h=0.38\n+/- 0.12.

We focus\non large scales where cosmic density fields are quasi-linear. On these scales,\nthe clustering of galaxies can be described by a perturbative bias expansion,\nand the complicated physics of galaxy formation is absorbed by a finite set of\ncoefficients of the expansion, called bias parameters. The review begins with a\ndetailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the\nrigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions\nof General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key\ncomponents of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational\nobservables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their\ntime derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all\nthese contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the\npeak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical\nmeaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection\nbetween bias parameters and galaxy statistics.

Numerical simulations of WL features rely on\nray-tracing through the outputs of $N$-body simulations, which requires\nknowledge of the gravitational potential and accurate solvers for light ray\ntrajectories.

Abstract: A large fraction of baryons predicted from the standard cosmology has been\nmissing observationally. Although previous numerical simulations have indicated\nthat most of the missing baryons reside in large-scale filaments in the form of\nWarm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM), it is generally very difficult to detect\nsignatures from such a diffuse gas. In this work, we focus on the hyperfine\ntransition of neutral hydrogen (HI) called 21-cm line as a tool to trace the\nWHIM. For the purpose, we first construct the map of the 21-cm signals by using\nthe data provided by the state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamics simulation\nproject, Illustris, in which detailed processes affecting the dynamical and\nthermal evolution of the WHIM are implemented. From the comparison with the\nconstructed 21-cm signal map with the expected noise level of the Square\nKilometre Array phase 1 mid-frequency instrument (SKA1-mid), we find that the\n21-cm signals from the filamentary structures at redshifts z=0.5-3 are\ndetectable with the SKA1-mid if we assume the angular resolution of\n\\Delta\\theta > 10 arcmin and the observing time of t_obs > 100 hours. However,\nit also turns out that the signals mainly come from galaxies residing in the\nfilamentary structures and the contribution from the WHIM is too small to\ndetect with the SKA1-mid. Our results suggest that about 10 times higher\nsensitivity than the SKA1-mid is possibly enough to detect the WHIM at z=0.5-3. \n\n"}

We restrict our measurements to scales $>1$\nMpc to probe the correlations between the formation histories of distinct\nhalos. Over the stellar mass range $10^{9.7} \\le M_\\ast/M_\\odot \\le 10^{10.9}$,\nwe find minimal statistical evidence for conformity. We further compare these\ndata to predictions of the halo age-matching model, in which the oldest\ngalaxies are associated with the oldest halos at fixed $M_\\ast$. For models\nwith strong correlations between halo and stellar age, the conformity signal is\ntoo large to be consistent with the data. For weaker implementations of\nage-matching, galactic conformity is not a sensitive diagnostic of halo\nassembly bias, and would not produce a detectable signal in SDSS data. We\nreproduce the results of Kauffmann et al 2013, in which the star formation\nrates of neighbor galaxies are significantly reduced around primary galaxies\nwhen the primaries are themselves low star formers.

Assuming the dark matter (DM) exists, this\nacceleration relation is tantamount to an acceleration relation between DM and\nbaryons. This leads us to a universal maximum acceleration for all halos.

Such a\nposterior is determined together by a generative model imposed on data and the\nselection event that enforces a truncation on the assumed law. The effective\ndifference between the selective posterior and the usual Bayesian framework is\nreflected in the use of a truncated likelihood. The normalizer of the truncated\nlaw in the adjusted framework is the probability of the selection event; this\nis typically intractable and it leads to the computational bottleneck in\nsampling from such a posterior. The current work lays out a primal-dual\napproach of solving an approximating optimization problem to provide valid\npost-selective Bayesian inference.

Thus, here we apply our self-consistent\nN-body/hydro-dynamical code (based on FLASH) to model this binary cluster\nencounter.

We can model such information-sharing relations as an\ninformation network, and the strategic interactions as a game on the network.\nWhen any two agents in the network are connected either directly or indirectly\nin a large network, empirical modeling using an equilibrium approach can be\ncumbersome, since the testable implications from an equilibrium generally\ninvolve all the players of the game, whereas a researcher's data set may\ncontain only a fraction of these players in practice. This paper develops a\ntractable empirical model of linear interactions where each agent, after\nobserving part of his neighbors' types, not knowing the full information\nnetwork, uses best responses that are linear in his and other players' types\nthat he observes, based on simple beliefs about the other players' strategies.\nWe provide conditions on information networks and beliefs such that the best\nresponses take an explicit form with multiple intuitive features. Furthermore,\nthe best responses reveal how local payoff interdependence among agents is\ntranslated into local stochastic dependence of their actions, allowing the\neconometrician to perform asymptotic inference without having to observe all\nthe players in the game or having to know the precise sampling process. \n\n"}

In astronomy, for example,\none can dramatically improve estimates of the parameters that dictate the\nevolution of the Universe by working with full conditional densities instead of\nregression (i.e., conditional mean) estimates. More generally, standard\nregression falls short in any prediction problem where the distribution of the\nresponse is more complex with multi-modality, asymmetry or heteroscedastic\nnoise. Nevertheless, much of the work on high-dimensional inference concerns\nregression and classification only, whereas research on density estimation has\nlagged behind. Here we propose FlexCode, a fully nonparametric approach to\nconditional density estimation that reformulates CDE as a non-parametric\northogonal series problem where the expansion coefficients are estimated by\nregression. By taking such an approach, one can efficiently estimate\nconditional densities and not just expectations in high dimensions by drawing\nupon the success in high-dimensional regression.

The 21cm-Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitter(LAE)\ncross-correlation is one of the tools available to reduce the foreground\neffects because the foreground emission from such radio sources is\nstatistically independent of LAE distribution. LAE surveys during the EoR at\nredshifts $z=6.6$ and $7.3$ are ongoing by the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC).\nAdditionally, Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) will provide precise redshift\ninformation of the LAEs discovered by the HSC survey. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the detectability of the 21cm signal with the 21cm-LAE\ncross-correlation by using our improved reionization simulations.

Being the issue so pressing, here we explain both\nanalytically and numerically the origin of the possible hints of DDE in the\ncontext of RVMs, which arise at a significance level of $3-4\\sigma$. By\nperforming a detailed study on the matter and vacuum perturbations within the\nRVMs, and comparing with the XCDM, we show why the running vacuum fully relaxes\nthe existing $\\sigma_8$-tension and accounts for the LSS formation data much\nbetter than the concordance model. \n\n"}

First, we introduce the sensitivity space of $T$, which\nextends the concepts of sensitivity polytope and sensitivity hull to the\nsetting of arbitrary statistics $T$. We then propose a framework consisting of\nthree methods for comparing the $K$-norm mechanisms: 1) a multivariate\nextension of stochastic dominance, 2) the entropy of the mechanism, and 3) the\nconditional variance given a direction, to identify the optimal $K$-norm\nmechanism.

However, due to the form\nof the adopted component densities, the distribution of the factors/errors in\nmost of these models is typically limited to modelling skewness oncentrated in\na single direction. Here, we introduce a more flexible finite mixture of factor\nanalyzers based on the class of scale mixtures of canonical fundamental skew\nnormal (SMCFUSN) distributions. This very general class of skew distributions\ncan capture various types of skewness and asymmetry in the data. In particular,\nthe proposed mixture model of SMCFUSN factor analyzers(SMCFUSNFA) can\nsimultaneously accommodate multiple directions of skewness. As such, it\nencapsulates many commonly used models as special and/or limiting cases, such\nas models of some versions of skew normal and skew t-factor analyzers, and skew\nhyperbolic factor analyzers.

Undirected network\npredictors are often expressed in terms of symmetric adjacency matrices, with\nrows and columns of the matrix representing the nodes, and zero entries\nsignifying no association between two corresponding nodes. Network predictor\nmatrices are typically vectorized prior to any analysis, thus failing to\naccount for the important structural information in the network. This results\nin poor inferential and predictive performance in presence of small sample\nsizes. We propose a novel class of network shrinkage priors for the coefficient\ncorresponding to the undirected network predictor. The proposed framework is\ndevised to detect both nodes and edges in the network predictive of the\nresponse. Our framework is implemented using an efficient Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo algorithm. Empirical results in simulation studies illustrate strikingly\nsuperior inferential and predictive gains of the proposed framework in\ncomparison with the ordinary high dimensional Bayesian shrinkage priors and\npenalized optimization schemes.

By performing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we\nquantify the sensitivity of 3D cosmic shear and tomography with different\nbinning strategies to different regions of the lensing kernel and matter power\nspectrum, and hence the background geometry and growth of structure in the\nUniverse. We find that a large number of equally spaced tomographic bins in\nredshift can extract nearly all the cosmological information without the\nadditional computational expense of 3D cosmic shear. Meanwhile a large fraction\nof the information comes from small poorly understood scales in the matter\npower spectrum, that can lead to biases on measurements of cosmological\nparameters. In light of this, we define and compute a cosmology-independent\nmeasure of the bias due to imperfect knowledge of the power spectrum.

Age-dating these galaxies\nis, however, a difficult task, and even a small contribution of an underlying\nyoung stellar population could, in principle, affect the age estimate and its\ncosmological interpretation. We present several spectral indicators to detect,\nquantify and constrain such contamination in old galaxies, and study how their\ncombination can be used to maximize the purity of cosmic chronometers\nselection. In particular, we analyze the CaII H/K ratio, the presence (or\nabsence) of H$\\alpha$ and [OII] emission lines, higher order Balmer absorption\nlines, and UV flux; each indicator is especially sensitive to a particular age\nrange, allowing us to detect young components ranging between 10 Myr and 1 Gyr.\nThe combination of these indicators minimizes the contamination to a level\nbelow 1% in the case of ideal data.

Screened modified gravity models can exhibit complex\nbehaviour there without violating stringent tests of gravity within our Solar\nSystem. They might hence provide viable extensions of the theory of gravity.\nHere, we use galaxy kinematics to constrain screened modified gravity models.\nWe focus on chameleon $f(R)$ gravity and predict its impact on galaxy rotation\ncurves and radial acceleration relations. This is achieved by post-processing\nstate-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations from the \\textsc{auriga project},\nusing the \\textsc{mg-gadget} code. For a given galaxy, the surface dividing\nscreened and un-screened regions adopts an oblate shape, reflecting the disc\nmorphology of the galaxy's mass distribution. At the `screening radius'---the\nradius at which screening is triggered in the disc plane---characteristic\n`upturns' are present in both rotation curves and radial acceleration\nrelations. The locations of these features depend on various factors, such as\nthe galaxy mass, the concentration of the density profile and the value of the\nbackground field amplitude $f_{R0}$.

This has led to a perceived dearth of dusty\nsystems at $z>4$, and the conclusion, according to some models, that the early\nUniverse was relatively dust-poor. In this paper, we extend the backward\nevolution galaxy model described by Casey et al.

Second, MDL codes\nsit precisely at a second order phase transition point where the symmetry\nbetween the sampled outcomes is spontaneously broken. The order parameter\ncontrolling the phase transition is the coding cost of the samples. The phase\ntransition is a manifestation of the optimality of MDL codes, and it arises\nbecause codes that achieve a higher compression do not exist.

MaDCoWS is the first cluster survey\ncapable of discovering massive clusters at these redshifts over the full\nextragalactic sky.

Using analytic calculations verified with mock\ngalaxy catalogs from log-normal simulations we find that constraints are\ndegraded in two ways, even when the interloper power spectrum is modeled\ncorrectly in the likelihood. Firstly, there is a loss of signal-to-noise ratio\nfor the power spectrum of the target galaxies, which propagates to all\ncosmological constraints and increases with contamination fraction, $f_c$.\nSecondly, degeneracies can open up between $f_c$ and cosmological parameters.\nIn our calculations this typically increases BAO scale uncertainties at the\n10-20% level when marginalizing over parameters determining the broadband power\nspectrum shape.
