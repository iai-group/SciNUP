The DC Josephson effect is\nthe pseudo-Goldstone boson of two coupled systems with a broken continuous\nabelian U(1) symmetry. Hence, an analog should exist for systems with broken\ncontinuous non-Abelian symmetries. To exhibit the generality of the phenomenon\nand make predictions from a realistic model, we study tunneling between\nantiferromagnets and also between antiferromagnetic d-wave superconductors.\nPerforming a calculation analogous to that of Ambegaokar and Baratoff for the\nJosephson junction, we find an equilibrium current of the staggered\nmagnetization through the junction that, in antiferromagnets, is proportional\nto s_L X s_R where s_L and s_R are the Neel vectors on either sides of the\njunction. Microscopically, this effect exists because of the coherent tunneling\nof spin-one particle-hole pairs. In the presence of a magnetic field which is\ndifferent on either sides of the junction, we find an analog of the AC\nJosephson effect where the angle between Neel vectors depends on time. In the\ncase of antiferromagnetic d-wave superconductors we predict that there is a\ncontribution to the critical current that depends on the antiferromagnetic\norder and a contribution to the spin-critical current that depends on\nsuperconducting order. The latter contributions come from tunneling of the\ntriplet Cooper pair that is necessarily present in the ground state of an\nantiferromagnetic d-wave superconductor. All these effects appear to leading\norder in the square of the tunneling matrix elements. \n\n"}

Remarkably, however, it is possible to detect and\ncorrect errors without destroying coherence by using quantum error correcting\ncodes [1]. The simplest of these are the three-qubit codes, which map a\none-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state and can correct any single\nphase-flip or bit-flip error of one of the three qubits, depending on the code\nused [2]. Here we demonstrate both codes in a superconducting circuit by\nencoding a quantum state as previously shown [3,4], inducing errors on all\nthree qubits with some probability, and decoding the error syndrome by\nreversing the encoding process. This syndrome is then used as the input to a\nthree-qubit gate which corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the\ncode can recover from a single error on any qubit, the fidelity of this process\nshould decrease only quadratically with error probability.

In general it is expected that interlayer interactions can\ndrive the system to a spontaneously broken symmetry state characterized by\ninterlayer phase coherence. The peculiarity of the SLG-BLG heterostructure is\nthat the electrons in the layers (SLG and BLG) have different chiralities. We\nfind that the difference of chirality between electrons in the two layers\ncauses the spontaneously broken symmetry state to be N-fold degenerate.\nMoreover, we find that some of the degenerate states are chiral superfluid\nstates, topologically distinct from the usual layer-ferromagnetism. The chiral\nnature of the ground state opens the possibility to realize protected midgap\nstates. The N-fold degeneracy of the ground state makes the physics of SLG-BLG\nhybrid systems analogous to the physics of helium-3, in particular given the\nrecent discovery of chiral superfluid states in this system. \n\n"}

Here, we make\nthe connection between Abelian as well as non-Abelian FQH states and FCIs more\nprecise. Using a gauge-fixed version of Qi's Wannier basis representation of a\nChern band, we demonstrate that the interpolation between several FCI states,\nobtained by short-range lattice interactions in a spin-orbit-coupled kagome\nlattice model, and the corresponding continuum FQH states is smooth: the gap\nremains approximately constant and extrapolates to a finite value in the\nthermodynamic limit, while the low-lying part of the orbital entanglement\nspectrum remains qualitatively unaltered. The orbital entanglement spectra also\nprovide a first glimpse of the edge physics of FCIs via the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence.

We also study $G(eV>0)$ for a system with a pair of\nalmost decoupled Majorana fermions with splitting $E_0$ and show that at lowest\n$E_0$ there is a zero-bias Lorentz peak of width $W$ as expected for a single\nMajorana fermion (a topological NS-junction) with a narrow dip of width\n$E_0^2/W$ at zero bias, which ensures $G(0)=0$ (the NS-junction remains trivial\non a very small energy scale). As the coupling $W$ gets stronger, the dip\nbecomes narrower, which can be understood as enhanced decoupling of the remote\nMajorana fermion.

We\nconsider both fully gapped and gapless topological materials and their\nclassification in terms of nonspatial symmetries, such as time-reversal, as\nwell as spatial symmetries, such as reflection. Furthermore, we survey the\nclassification of gapless modes localized on topological defects. The\nclassification of these systems is discussed by use of homotopy groups,\nClifford algebras, K-theory, and non-linear sigma models describing the\nAnderson (de-)localization at the surface or inside a defect of the material.\nTheoretical model systems and their topological invariants are reviewed\ntogether with recent experimental results in order to provide a unified and\ncomprehensive perspective of the field. While the bulk of this article is\nconcerned with the topological properties of noninteracting or mean-field\nHamiltonians, we also provide a brief overview of recent results and open\nquestions concerning the topological classifications of interacting systems. \n\n"}

Besides the Hall\nconductance, the Hall viscosity is another example of such a response that\nmeasures how electronic wave functions respond to changes in the underlying\ngeometry. Topological (Chern) insulators are known to have a quantized Hall\nconductance. A natural question is how the Hall viscosity behaves for these\nmaterials. So far, most of studies on the Hall viscosity of Chern insulators\nhave focused on the continuum limit. The presence of lattice breaks the\ncontinuous translational symmetry to a discrete group and this causes two\ncomplications: it introduces a new length scale associated with the lattice\nconstant, and makes the momentum periodic. We develop two different methods of\nhow to implement a lattice deformation: (1) a lattice distortion is encoded as\na shift in the lattice momentum, and (2) a lattice deformation is treated\nmicroscopically in the gradient expansion of the hopping matrix elements. After\nestablishing the method of deformation we can compute the Hall viscosity\nthrough a linear response (Kubo) formula. We examine these methods for three\nmodels: the Hofstadter model, the Chern insulator, and the surface of a 3D\ntopological insulator. Our results in certain regimes of parameters, where the\ncontinuum limit is relevant, are in agreement with previous calculations. We\nalso provide possible experimental signatures of the Hall viscosity by studying\nthe phononic properties of a single crystal 3D topological insulator. \n\n"}

As an example, we focus on the induced topological time-periodic\n(Floquet) phase in a 2D $p+ip$ superfluid, following an instantaneous quench of\nthe coupling strength. The post-quench Cooper pairs occupy a linear combination\nof \"ground\" and \"excited\" Floquet states, with coefficients determined by the\ndistribution function. While the Floquet bandstructure exhibits a single\navoided crossing relative to the equilibrium case, the distribution function\nshows a population inversion of the Floquet bands at low energies. For a\nrealization in ultracold atoms, these two features compensate, producing a bulk\naverage rf signal that is well-captured by a quasi-equilibrium approximation.\nIn particular, the rf spectrum shows a robust gap. The single crossing occurs\nbecause the quench-induced Floquet phase belongs to a particular class of\nsoliton dynamics for the BCS equation. The population inversion is a\nconsequence of this, and ensures the conservation of the pseudospin winding\nnumber. As a comparison, we compute the rf signal when only the lower Floquet\nband is occupied; in this case, the gap disappears for strong quenches. The\ntunneling signal in a solid state realization is ignorant of the distribution\nfunction, and can show wildly different behaviors. We also examine rf,\ntunneling, and ARPES for weak quenches, such that the resulting topological\nsteady-state is characterized by a constant nonequilibrium order parameter.

It is known that dissipationless\nspin currents can arise when using conventional superconducting contacts, yet\nthis has only been experimentally demonstrated when using intricate\nmagnetically inhomogeneous multilayers, or in extreme cases such as half-metals\nwith interfacial magnetic disorder. Moreover, it is unknown how such spin\nsupercurrents decay in the presence of spin-flip scattering.

We also include the\neffects of surface roughness to examine the effects of contact-line pinning on\nthe dynamics. When there is a `lid' above the system, which prevents\nevaporation, equilibrium drops form on the surface, which we use to determine\nthe contact angle and how it varies as the parameters of the model are changed.\nThis enables us to relate the interaction parameters to the materials used in\napplications.

This happens\nwhen the potential energy of the system dominates over its kinetic energy,\ni.e., at low temperatures for a classical system and at low densities for a\nquantum one. At $T=0$, the system is governed by quantum mechanics, and hence,\nthe spatial density peaks associated with crystalline charge localization are\nsharpened for a lower average density. Conversely, in the classical limit of\nhigh temperatures, the crystalline spatial density peaks are suppressed\n(recovered) at a lower (higher) average density. In this paper, we study those\ntwo limits separately using an exact diagonalization of small one-dimensional\n(1D) systems containing few ($<10$) electrons and propose an approximate method\nto connect them into a unified effective phase diagram for Wigner few-electron\ncrystallization. The result is a qualitative quantum-classical crossover phase\ndiagram of an effective 1D Wigner crystal. We show that the spatial density\npeaks associated with the quasi-crystallization should be experimentally\nobservable in a few-electron 1D system. We find that the effective crystalline\nstructure slowly disappears with both the crossover average density and\ncrossover temperature for crystallization decreasing with increasing particle\nnumber, consistent with the absence of any true long-range 1D order. In fact,\none peculiar aspect of the effective finite-size nature of 1D Wigner\ncrystallization we find is that even a short-range interaction would lead to a\nfinite-size 1D crystal, except that the crystalline order vanishes much faster\nwith increasing system size in the short-range interacting system compared with\nthe long-range interacting one. \n\n"}

The focus is primarily on the relationship\nbetween the quasiparticle energy eigenvalue spectrum and the geometrical shape\nof the normal-state region, i.e., the question of spectral geometry in the\nnovel setting of excitations confined by a superconducting pair-potential.\nAmong the central results of this investigation are two semiclassical trace\nformulas for the density of states. The first, a lower-resolution formula,\ncorresponds to the well-known quasiclassical approximation, conventionally\ninvoked in settings involving superconductivity. The second, a\nhigher-resolution formula, allows the density of states to be expressed in\nterms of: (i) An explicit formula for the level density, valid in the\nshort-wave limit, for billiards of arbitrary shape and dimensionality. This\nlevel density depends on the billiard shape only through the set of\nstationary-length chords of the billiard and the curvature of the boundary at\nthe endpoints of these chords; and (ii) Higher-resolution corrections to the\nlevel density, expressed as a sum over periodic orbits that creep around the\nbilliard boundary. Owing to the fact that these creeping orbits are much longer\nthan the stationary chords, one can, inter alia, hear the stationary chords of\nAndreev billiards. \n\n"}

Because of the coupling, the qubit frequency is shifted by an amount $n\n\\delta \\nu_0$ if the resonator contains $n$ energy quanta. Thermal fluctuations\ninduce temporal variations $n(t)$ and thus dephasing. We give an approximate\nformula for the qubit dephasing time as a function of $\\delta \\nu_0$. We\ndiscuss the specific case of a flux-qubit coupled to the plasma mode of its\nDC-SQUID detector.

{"id": "hep-th/0306247", "contents": "Title: The Fuzzy Disc Abstract: We introduce a finite dimensional matrix model approximation to the algebra\nof functions on a disc based on noncommutative geometry. The algebra is a\nsubalgebra of the one characterizing the noncommutative plane with a * product\nand depends on two parameters N and theta. It is composed of functions which\ndecay exponentially outside a disc. In the limit in which the size of the\nmatrices goes to infinity and the noncommutativity parameter goes to zero the\ndisc becomes sharper. We introduce a Laplacian defined on the whole algebra and\ncalculate its eigenvalues. We also calculate the two--points correlation\nfunction for a free massless theory (Green's function). In both cases the\nagreement with the exact result on the disc is very good already for relatively\nsmall matrices. This opens up the possibility for the study of field theories\non the disc with nonperturbative methods. The model contains edge states, a\nfact studied in a similar matrix model independently introduced by\nBalachandran, Gupta and Kurkcuoglu. \n\n"}
