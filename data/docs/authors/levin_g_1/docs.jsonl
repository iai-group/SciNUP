Here we provide combined experimental and theoretical\nevidences showing that the anomaly is caused by the spin-density-wave (SDW)\ninstability, and electron-doping by F suppresses the SDW instability and\nrecovers the superconductivity. Therefore, the La(O$_{1-x}$F$_x$)FeAs offers an\nexciting new system showing competing orders in layered compounds. \n\n"}

The first paradox concerns the\napparent non-existence of the signature of the electron pockets in angle\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The second paradox is a clear\nsignature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments, but no\nevidence as yet of the corresponding hole pockets of approximately double the\nfrequency of the electron pocket. This hole pockets should be present if the\nFermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave, assuming\nthat Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number\nof charge carriers holds. Here we provide possible resolutions of these\napparent paradoxes from the commensurate $d$-density wave theory. To address\nthe first paradox we have computed the ARPES spectral function subject to\ncorrelated disorder, natural to a class of experiments relevant to the\nmaterials studied in quantum oscillations. The intensity of the spectral\nfunction is significantly reduced for the electron pockets for an intermediate\nrange of disorder correlation length, and typically less than half the hole\npocket is visible, mimicking Fermi arcs. Next we show from an exact transfer\nmatrix calculation of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation that the usual disorder\naffects the electron pocket more significantly than the hole pocket. However,\nwhen, in addition, the scattering from vortices in the mixed state is included,\nit wipes out the frequency corresponding to the hole pocket. Thus, if we are\ncorrect, it will be necessary to do measurements at higher magnetic fields and\neven higher quality samples to recover the hole pocket frequency. \n\n"}

Some of these results had been announced much\nearlier by Bell but without accessible proofs. We define the concept of the\nvariation of a map on a simple closed curve and relate it to the index of the\nmap on that curve: Index = Variation + 1. A fixed point theorem for positively\noriented, perfect maps of the plane is obtained. This generalizes results\nannounced by Bell in 1982. A continuous map of an interval to the real line\nwhich sends the endpoints in opposite directions has a fixed point. We\ngeneralize this to maps on non-invariant continua in the plane under positively\noriented maps of the plane (with appropriate boundary conditions). These\nmethods imply that in some cases non-invariant continua in the plane are\ndegenerate. This has important applications in complex dynamics. E.g., a\nspecial case of our results shows that if $X$ is a non-separating invariant\nsubcontinuum of the Julia set of a polynomial $P$ containing no fixed Cremer\npoints and exhibiting no local rotation at all fixed points, then $X$ must be a\npoint.

Substituting Fe for a tiny amount of Cu (1%) induced an\nincommensurate magnetic order below 20 K in heavily-overdoped La2-xSrxCuO4\n(LSCO). Elastic neutron scattering suggested that this order cannot be ascribed\nto the localized spins on Cu or doped Fe. Angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES), combined with numerical calculations, revealed a strong\nFermi surface nesting inherent in the pristine LSCO that likely drives this\norder. The heavily-overdoped Fe-doped LSCO thus represents the first plausible\nexample of the long-sought \"itinerant-spin extreme\" of cuprates, where the\nspins of itinerant doped holes define the magnetic ordering ground state. This\nfinding complements the current picture of cuprate spin physics that highlights\nthe predominant role of localized spins at lower dopings.

The model predicts a zero-mass pion for zero-mass quarks and a Regge\nspectrum of linear trajectories with the same slope in the leading orbital\nangular momentum $L$ of hadrons and the radial quantum number $N$. Light-Front\nHolography maps the amplitudes which are functions of the fifth dimension\nvariable $z$ of anti-de Sitter space to a corresponding hadron theory quantized\non the light front. The resulting Lorentz-invariant relativistic light-front\nwave equations are functions of an invariant impact variable $\\zeta$ which\nmeasures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron\nat equal light-front time. The result is a semi-classical frame-independent\nfirst approximation to the spectra and light-front wavefunctions of meson and\nbaryon light-quark bound states, which in turn predict the behavior of the pion\nand nucleon form factors. The effects of chiral symmetry breaking increase as\none goes toward large interquark separation, consistent with spectroscopic\ndata, and the hadron eigenstates generally have components with different\norbital angular momentum; e.g., the proton eigenstate in AdS/QCD with massless\nquarks has L=0 and L=1 light-front Fock components with equal probability. The\nsoft-wall model also predicts the form of the non-perturbative effective\ncoupling $\\alpha_s^{AdS}(Q)$ which agrees with the effective coupling extracted\nfrom the Bjorken sum rule. The AdS/QCD model can be systematically improved by\nusing its complete orthonormal solutions to diagonalize the full QCD\nlight-front Hamiltonian or by applying the Lippmann-Schwinger method in order\nto systematically include the QCD interaction terms.

Resummation follows after one factorizes the cross\nsection into the rele- vant modes. The class of observables which are sensitive\nto soft recoil effects are particularly challenging to factorize and resum\nsince they involve rapidity logarithms. In this paper we will present a\nformalism which allows one to factorize and resum the perturbative series for\nsuch observables in a systematic fashion through the notion of a \"rapidity\nrenormalization group\". That is, a Collin-Soper like equation is realized as a\nrenormalization group equation, but has a more universal applicability to\nobservables beyond the traditional transverse momentum dependent parton\ndistribution functions (TMDPDFs) and the Sudakov form factor. This formalism\nhas the feature that it allows one to track the (non-standard) scheme\ndependence which is inherent in any scenario where one performs a resummation\nof rapidity divergences. We present a pedagogical introduction to the formalism\nby applying it to the well-known massive Sudakov form factor. The formalism is\nthen used to study observables of current interest. A factorization theorem for\nthe transverse momentum distribution of Higgs production is presented along\nwith the result for the resummed cross section at NLL.

In addition, annealing at 563\nK, well above Tp, suppresses the superconducting transition temperature Tc and\nleads to an increase of the antiferromagnetic susceptibility accompanied by the\ncreation of ferromagnetic impurity phases, which are developing with annealing\ntime. However, annealing at T=488K=Tp increases Tc up to 33.3 K, sharpens the\nsuperconducting transition, increases the lower critical field, and strengthens\nthe screening efficiency of the applied magnetic field. Resistivity\nmeasurements of the as-grown and optimally annealed samples reveal an increase\nof the upper critical field along both crystallographic directions as well as\nits anisotropy.

Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L. We explicitly establish the validity of this statement\nfor the case of N=4. The details of the relevant calculations being distinctly\ntransparent, one can readily convince oneself that our observation is valid for\narbitrary N. It follows that the issues raised by DPK, such as non-existence of\nthe Luttinger-Ward functional and \"breakdown of the elemental particle picture\nin strongly correlated electron matter\", are all inessential to the observed\nfailure of the LT. As regards the singularity of the self-energy \\Sigma(\\omega)\non the real \\omega-axis, observed by DPK, we demonstrate that this also is a\ndirect consequence of the non-uniqueness of the GS of the SU(N) model for 0 < n\n< N.

It leads to\nspontaneously fluctuating Cu - O - Cu valence bonds which establish a local\nFeshbach resonance exchange coupling between bound and unbound electron pairs.\nThe coupling, being the only free parameter in this scenario, the hole doping\nof the parent state is monitored by varying the total number of unpaired and\npaired electrons, in chemical equilibrium with each other. Upon lowering the\ntemperature to below a certain $T^*$, bound and unbound electron pairs lock\ntogether in a local quantum superposition, generating transient localized bound\nelectron pairs and a concomitant opening of a pseudo-gap in the single-particle\ndensity of states. At low temperature, this pseudo-gap state transits via a\nfirst order hole doping induced phase transition into a superconducting state\nin which the localized transient bound electron pairs get spatially phase\ncorrelated. The mechanism driving that transition is a phase separation between\ntwo phases having different relative densities of bound and unbound electron\npairs, which is reminiscent of the physics of $^4$He - $^3$He mixtures. \n\n"}

Compared to the iron pnictides,\nthese systems have only electron Fermi pockets (i.e. no hole Fermi pockets) but\ncomparable superconducting transition temperatures. The challenge lies in\nreconciling the two basic experimental features of their superconducting state:\na node-less gap and the existence of a resonance in the spin excitation\nspectrum. We propose a mechanism based on reconstructing two quasi-degenerate\npairing states, one in an $s$-wave $A_{1g}$ channel that is fully gapped, and\nthe other in a $d$-wave $B_{1g}$ channel whose pairing function changes sign\nacross the electron Fermi pockets at the Brillouin-zone boundary. The resulting\nintermediate pairing state, which we call an orbital-selective $s \\times\n\\tau_3$ state, incorporates both of the above two properties. When the leading\nspin-singlet pairing is in the $d_{xz}, d_{yz}$ orbital subspace, this state\nretains the $s$-wave form factor but has a $B_{1g}$ symmetry due to an internal\n$\\tau_3$ structure in the orbital space.

The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings. These\nprinciples explain why the unconventional high T_c superconductivity appears to\nbe such a rare but robust phenomena with its strict requirement on electronic\nenvironment.

While\nthree-dimensional topological insulators are becoming abundant, two-dimensional\ntopological insulators remain rare, particularly in natural materials. ZrTe5\nhas host a long-standing puzzle on its anomalous transport properties; its\nunderlying origin remains elusive. Lately, ZrTe5 has ignited renewed interest\nbecause it is predicted that single-layer ZrTe5 is a two-dimensional\ntopological insulator and there is possibly a topological phase transition in\nbulk ZrTe5. However, the topological nature of ZrTe5 is under debate as some\nexperiments point to its being a three-dimensional or quasi-two-dimensional\nDirac semimetal. Here we report high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved\nphotoemission measurements on ZrTe5. The electronic property of ZrTe5 is\ndominated by two branches of nearly-linear-dispersion bands at the Brillouin\nzone center. These two bands are separated by an energy gap that decreases with\ndecreasing temperature but persists down to the lowest temperature we measured\n(~2 K). The overall electronic structure exhibits a dramatic temperature\ndependence; it evolves from a p-type semimetal with a hole-like Fermi pocket at\nhigh temperature, to a semiconductor around ~135 K where its resistivity\nexhibits a peak, to an n-type semimetal with an electron-like Fermi pocket at\nlow temperature. These results indicate a clear electronic evidence of the\ntemperature-induced Lifshitz transition in ZrTe5. They provide a natural\nunderstanding on the underlying origin of the resistivity anomaly at ~135 K and\nits associated reversal of the charge carrier type. Our observations also\nprovide key information on deciphering the topological nature of ZrTe5 and\npossible temperature-induced topological phase transition. \n\n"}

We show that localization of large extended objects can be mapped\nto a lower-dimensional many-body localization problem. For example, motion of a\nstring involves propagation of point-like signals down its length to keep the\ndifferent segments in causal contact. For sufficiently strong disorder, all\nsuch internal modes will exhibit many-body localization, resulting in the\nlocalization of the entire string. The eigenstates of the system can then be\nconstructed perturbatively through a convergent 'string locator expansion.'

We show that a unified theory of the diverse broken symmetry states\nnecessarily requires explicit incorporation of strong electron-electron\ninteractions and lattice discreteness, and most importantly, the correct\nbandfilling of one-quarter. Uniquely in the quarter-filled band, there is a\nvery strong tendency to form nearest neighbor spin-singlets, in both one and\ntwo dimensions. The tendency to spin-singlets, a quantum effect, drives a\ncommensurate charge-order in the correlated quarter-filled band. This\ncharge-ordered spin-singlet, which we label as a paired-electron crystal (PEC),\nis different from and competes with both the antiferromagnetic state and the\nWigner crystal of single electrons. Further, unlike these classical broken\nsymmetries, the PEC is characterized by a spin gap. The tendency to the PEC in\ntwo dimensions is enhanced by lattice frustration.

These interaction and disorder effects can be incorporated into a\nmean-field description by means of a self-energy appearing in the Green's\nfunction. We first examine the quasiparticle scattering interference spectra in\nthe superconducting state at optimal doping as temperature is increased.\nAssuming agreement with angle-resolved photoemission experiments which suggest\nthat the scattering rate depends on temperature, resulting in the filling of\nthe $d$-wave gap, we find that the peaks predicted by the octet model become\nprogressively smeared as temperature is increased. When the scattering rate is\nof the same order of magnitude as the superconducting gap, the spectral\nfunction shows Fermi-arc-like patterns, while the power spectrum of the local\ndensity of states shows the destruction of the octet-model peaks. We next\nconsider the normal state properties of the optimally-doped cuprates.

In this work, we derive the expressions of the\nzero-temperature spin susceptibility, the upper critical field close to the\nzero-field critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical temperature with weak\nrandom non-magnetic disorders for the singlet-quintet mixed state based on the\nLuttinger model. Our study revealed the following features of the\nsinglet-quintet mixing. (1) The zero-temperature spin susceptibility remains\nzero for the singlet-quintet mixed state if only the centrosymmetric spin-orbit\ncoupling is taken into account, and will deviate from zero when the\nnon-centrosymmetric spin-orbit coupling is introduced. (2) The singlet-quintet\nmixing can help enhance the upper critical field roughly because it can\nincrease $T_c$.

The order\nparameter also assumes a dome shape as a function of doping while, by contrast,\nthe gap in the single-particle density of states decreases monotonically with\nincreasing doping. In the presence of a finite second-neighbor hopping t', the\nzero temperature phase diagram displays the electron-hole asymmetric\ncompetition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity that is observed\nexperimentally in the cuprates. Adding realistic third-neighbor hopping t''\nimproves the overall agreement with the experimental phase diagram. Since band\nparameters can vary depending on the specific cuprate considered, the\nsensitivity of the theoretical phase diagram to band parameters challenges the\ncommonly held assumption that the doping vs T_{c}/T_{c}^{max} phase diagram of\nthe cuprates is universal. The calculated ARPES spectrum displays the observed\nelectron-hole asymmetry. Our calculations reproduce important features of\nd-wave superconductivity in the cuprates that would otherwise be considered\nanomalous from the point of view of the standard BCS approach. \n\n"}

In this work, we\ninvestigate its phenomenological implications at linear colliders, especially\nthe TESLA at DESY, through the processes of e^+e^-\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-,H^+H^-,H^0H^0.\nThe results are indeed found to be very different from the ones obtained in the\nnaive approach. The first two get corrected at tree level as opposed to the\nnull result in the naive approach, while the third one coincides with the naive\nresult only in the low energy limit.
