Two main schemes have been\nproposed for such a 'first' detection: measurements of ellipticity acquired by\na linearly polarized beam of light passing through a magnetic field and direct\nlight-light scattering. The study of the propagation of light through an\nexternal field can also be used to probe for new physics such as the existence\nof axion-like particles and millicharged particles. Their existence in nature\nwould cause the index of refraction of vacuum to be different from unity in the\npresence of an external field and dependent of the polarization direction of\nthe light propagating. The major achievement of reaching the project\nsensitivities in gravitational wave interferometers such as LIGO an VIRGO has\nopened the possibility of using such instruments for the detection of QED\ncorrections in electrodynamics and for probing new physics at very low\nenergies. In this paper we discuss the difference between direct birefringence\nmeasurements and index of refraction measurements.

For the \\Xi_{cc}, we find the\nisospin-averaged mass to be M_{\\Xi_{cc}} = 3665 +/- 17 +/- 14 +0 -78 MeV; the\nthree given uncertainties are statistical, systematic and an estimate of\nlattice discretization errors, respectively.

It has earlier been proposed that UHECRs could be\naccelerated in either the nucleus or the outer lobes of the nearby radio galaxy\nCen A. We show that UHECR production at a spatially intermediate location about\n15 kpc northeast from the nucleus, where the jet emerging from the nucleus is\nobserved to strike a large star-forming shell of gas, is a plausible\nalternative. A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud. In this model many CRs arising from\na starburst, with a composition enhanced in heavy elements near the knee region\naround PeV, are boosted to ultra-high energies by the relativistic shock of a\nnewly oriented jet. This model matches the overall spectrum shown by the Auger\ndata and also makes a prediction for the chemical composition as a function of\nparticle energy. We thus predict an observable anisotropy in the composition at\nhigh energy in the sense that lighter nuclei should preferentially be seen\ntoward the general direction of Cen A. Taking into consideration the magnetic\nfield models for the Galactic disk and a Galactic magnetic wind, this scenario\nmay resolve the discrepancy between HiRes and Auger results concerning the\nchemical composition of UHECRs. \n\n"}

{"id": "1108.4977", "contents": "Title: QCD Structure of Nuclear Interactions Abstract: This dissertation investigated selected processes involving baryons and\nnuclei in hard scattering reactions. Through these processes, this work\nexplored the constituent structure of baryons and the mechanisms through which\nthe interactions between these constituents ultimately control the selected\nreactions. First, hard nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering was studied\nconsidering the quark exchange (QE) between the nucleons to be the dominant\nmechanism of interaction in the constituent picture. It was found that an\nangular asymmetry exhibited by proton-neutron (pn) elastic scattering data is\nexplained within this framework if a quark-diquark picture dominates the\nnucleon's structure instead of a more traditional SU(6) model. The latter\nyields an asymmetry around 90 deg center of mass scattering with a sign\nopposite to what is experimentally observed. The second process is the hard\nbreakup by a photon of a nucleon-nucleon system in light nuclei. Proton-proton\n(pp) and pn breakup in 3He, and double Delta-isobars production in deuteron\nbreakup were analyzed in the hard rescattering model (HRM), which in\nconjunction with the QE mechanism provides a QCD description of the reaction.\nCross sections for both channels in 3He photodisintegration were computed\nwithout the need of a fitting parameter. The results presented here for pp\nbreakup show excellent agreement with recent experimental data. In double\nDelta-isobars production in deuteron breakup, HRM angular distributions for the\ntwo double Delta channels were compared to the pn channel and to each other. An\nimportant prediction from this study is that the Delta++ Delta- channel\nconsistently dominates Delta+Delta0, which is in contrast with models that\nunlike the HRM consider a double Delta system in the initial state of the\ninteraction. For such models both channels should have the same strength. \n\n"}

This discrepancy has led to various, quite different\nexplanations in terms of increased axial masses, changes in the functional form\nof the axial form factor, increased vector strength in nuclei, and initial\ntwo-particle interactions. This is disconcerting since the neutrino energy\nreconstruction depends on the reaction mechanism. Purpose: We investigate\nwhether exclusive observables, such as nucleon knock-out, can be used to\ndistinguish between the various proposed reaction mechanisms. We determine the\ninfluence of 2p-2h excitations on the energy reconstruction. Method: We use the\nGiessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model to predict numbers and\nspectra of knock-out nucleons. The model is extended by incorporating a simple,\nbut realistic treatment of initial 2p-2h excitations. Results: We show numbers\nand spectra of knock-out nucleons and show their sensitivity to the presence of\n2p-2h initial excitations. We also discuss the influence of 2p-2h excitations\non the neutrino energy reconstruction. Conclusions: 2p-2h excitations do lead\nto an increase in the number $n$ of knock-out nucleons for $n \\ge 2$ while only\nthe $n=1$ knock-out remains a clean signal of true QE scattering. The spectra\nof knock-out nucleons do also change, but their qualitative shape remains as\nbefore. In the energy reconstruction 2p-2h interactions lead to a downward\nshift of the reconstructed energy; this effect of 2p-2h excitations disappears\nat higher energies because the 2p-2h influence is spread out over a wider\nenergy range. \n\n"}

Furthermore, we assume that dark matter scattering of\nbaryons, namely, the spin-independent scattering cross section, is of the same\norder as the range of values suggested by several theoretical particle physics\nmodels used to explain the current unexplained events reported in the\nDAMA/LIBRA, CoGeNT and CRESST experiments. Here, we constrain \\eta-ADM models\nby investigating the impact of such a type of dark matter on the evolution of\nthe Sun, namely, the flux of solar neutrinos and helioseismology. We find that\ndark matter particles with a mass smaller than 15 GeV, a spin-independent\nscattering cross section on baryons of the order of a picobarn, and an\n\\eta-dark matter asymmetry with a value in the interval 10^{-12}-10^{-10},\nwould induce a change in solar neutrino fluxes in disagreement with current\nneutrino flux measurements. A natural consequence of this model is suppressed\nannihilation, thereby reducing the tension between indirect and direct dark\nmatter detection experiments, but the model also allows a greatly enhanced\nannihilation cross section. All the cosmological \\eta-asymmetric dark matter\nscenarios that we discuss are in agreement with the current WMAP measured\nvalues. \n\n"}

The measured Higgs mass constrains the scalar sparticles to\nbe below 10^5 TeV, while gauge coupling unification favors Higgsinos below 100\nTeV.

APFEL consistently accounts for\nthe QED corrections to the evolution of quark and gluon PDFs and for the\ncontribution from the photon PDF in the proton.

For these analyses, signatures that mimic such leptons\npresent a `fake lepton' background that must be estimated. Since the magnitude\nof this background depends strongly upon details of the detector response, it\ncan be difficult to estimate with simulation. One data-driven approach is the\n`matrix method', in which two categories of leptons are defined (`loose' and\n`tight'), with the tight category being a subset of the loose category. Using\nthe populations of leptons in each category in the analysis sample, and the\nefficiencies for both real and fake leptons in the loose category to satisfy\nthe criteria for the tight category, the fake background yield can be\nestimated. This paper describes a Poisson likelihood implementation of the\nmatrix method, which provides a more precise, reliable, and robust estimate of\nthe fake background yield compared to an analytic solution. This implementation\nalso provides a reliable estimate of the background for cases in which the\nanalysis selection permits more loose leptons than tight leptons, potentially\nallowing for greater selection efficiency. \n\n"}

When an incident wave scatters off of an obstacle, it is partially\nreflected and partially transmitted. Since the scatterer absorbs part of the\nincident energy, the reflected wave carries less energy than the incident one.\nHowever, if the obstacle is rotating, this process can be reversed and waves\ncan be amplified, extracting energy from the scatterer. Even though this\nphenomenon, known as superradiance, has been thoroughly analysed in several\ntheoretical scenarios (from eletromagnetic radiation scattering on a rotating\ncylinder to gravitational waves incident upon a rotating black hole), it has\nnever been observed. Here we describe in detail the first laboratory detection\nof superradiance. We observed that plane waves propagating on the surface of\nwater are amplified after being scattered by a draining vortex. The maximum\namplification measured in the experiment was 20%, obtained for 3.70 Hz waves,\nin a 6.25 cm deep fluid. Our results are consistent with superradiant\nscattering caused by rapid rotation. In particular, a draining fluid can\ntransfer part of its rotational energy to incident low-frequency waves. Our\nexperimental findings will shed new light on Black Hole Physics, since shallow\nwater waves scattering on a draining fluid constitute an analogue of a black\nhole. We believe, especially in view of the recent observations of\ngravitational waves, that our results will motivate further research (both\ntheoretical and experimental) on the observation of superradiance of\ngravitational waves. \n\n"}

This chamber is\ninstrumented with a CCD camera for near-IR bubble imaging, a solar-blind\nphotomultiplier tube to detect 175-nm xenon scintillation light, and a\npiezoelectric acoustic transducer to detect the ultrasonic emission from a\ngrowing bubble. The time of nucleation determined from the acoustic signal is\nused to correlate specific scintillation pulses with bubble-nucleating events.\nWe report on data from this chamber for thermodynamic \"Seitz\" thresholds from\n4.2 to 15.0 keV. The observed single- and multiple-bubble rates when exposed to\na $^{252}$Cf neutron source indicate that, for an 8.3-keV thermodynamic\nthreshold, the minimum nuclear recoil energy required to nucleate a bubble is\n$19\\pm6$ keV (1$\\sigma$ uncertainty).

We examine the azimuthal\ncorrelations between the system and one of its particles. We point out that the\nperturbative QCD computation of such azimuthal correlations and asymmetries can\nlead to divergent results at fixed perturbative orders. The fixed-order\ndivergences affect basic (and infrared safe) quantities such as the total cross\nsection at fixed (and arbitrary) values of the azimuthal-correlation angle\n$\\varphi$. Examples of processes with fixed-order divergences are heavy-quark\npair production, associated production of vector bosons and jets, dijet and\ndiboson production. A noticeable exception is the production of high-mass\nlepton pairs through the Drell--Yan mechanism of quark-antiquark annihilation.\nHowever, even in the Drell--Yan process, fixed-order divergences arise in the\ncomputation of QED radiative corrections. We specify general conditions that\nproduce the divergences by discussing their physical origin in fixed-order\ncomputations.

Because of a unique beam structure of\nthe ILC, the IBF is a critical issue for the realization of the ILD-TPC. Not\nonly to suppress the ion back-flow to the drift volume, but also to allow the\nprimary electrons pass through, a large aperture GEM-like gating device has\nbeen developed. Several bench tests for confirming the performance of the\ngating device have been conducted, besides that, beam test with the full\ndetector module equipped with the gating device was carried out to verify the\nresolution that the full module can provide. As a result, it turned out that\nthe developed gating device fulfills requirements for maintaining the\nperformance of the MPGD based TPC, and it has sufficient performance for the\ncentral tracker of the ILD at the ILC. \n\n"}

Existing\napproaches attempt to tackle this problem by either synthesizing visible faces\nfrom NIR faces, extracting domain-invariant features from these modalities, or\nprojecting heterogeneous data onto a common latent space for cross-modal\nmatching. In this paper, we take a different approach in which we make use of\nthe Disentangled Variational Representation (DVR) for cross-modal matching.\nFirst, we model a face representation with an intrinsic identity information\nand its within-person variations.

The incident wave is decomposed into\nplane waves and each plane wave is reflected off the surface using the standard\nFresnel formalism. For each plane wave the reflected wave is assumed to be\nlocally a plane wave.

It\nis based on the different behavior of the neutral current pion production off\nthe nucleon, depending on whether it is induced by neutrinos or antineutrinos.\nThis procedure for distinguishing tau-neutrinos from antineutrinos neither\nrelies on any nuclear model, nor it is affected by any nuclear effect\n(distortion of the outgoing nucleon waves, etc...).

The absence of a\nsignal at the Tevatron disfavours the likelihood that any such leptoquark\ndecays only into e^+ q. We then focus on the possibility that the leptoquark is\na squark with R-violating couplings. In view of the present experimental limits\non such couplings, the most likely production channels are e^+d -> scharm_L or\nperhaps e^+d->stop, with e^+s->stop a more marginal possibility. Possible tests\nof our preferred model include the absence both of analogous events in e^- p\ncollisions and of charged current events, and the presence of detectable\ncascade decays whose kinematical signatures we discuss. We also discuss the\npossible implications for K->pi nu nubar, neutrinoless double-beta decay, the\nTevatron and for e^+ e^- ->q qbar and neutralinos at LEP2. \n\n"}
