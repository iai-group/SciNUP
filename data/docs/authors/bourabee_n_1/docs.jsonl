We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold.

The limiting\nfree energy in all these models along with Word GREM, a model proposed by us,\nturn out to be a cute consequence of large deviation principle (LDP). This LDP\nargument allows us to consider non-Gaussian driving distributions as well as\nexternal field. We could also consider random trees as the underlying tree\nstructure in GREM. In all these models, as expected, limiting free energy is\nnot 'universal' unlike the SK model. However it is 'rate specific'.\nConsideration of non-Gaussian driving distribution as well as different driving\ndistributions for the different levels of the underlying trees in GREM leads to\ninteresting phenomena. For example in REM, if the Hamiltonian is Binomial with\nparameter $N$ and $p$ then the existence of phase transition depends on the\nparameter $p$. More precisely, phase transition takes place only when\n$p>{1/2}$.

Some attractive properties are derived for the\nresiduals obtained by MINRES. Based on them and the new general theory, we make\na more refined analysis and establish a number of new convergence results. Let\n$\\|r_k\\|$ be the residual norm of approximating eigenpair at outer iteration\n$k$. Then all the available cubic and quadratic convergence results require\n$\\xi_k=O(\\|r_k\\|)$ and $\\xi_k\\leq\\xi$ with a fixed $\\xi$ not near one,\nrespectively.

Important questions\nabout the relation between regularization theory and Bayesian inference still\nneed to be addressed when using sparsity promoting inversion. A practical\nobstacle for these examinations is the lack of fast posterior sampling\nalgorithms for sparse, high-dimensional Bayesian inversion: Accessing the full\nrange of Bayesian inference methods requires being able to draw samples from\nthe posterior probability distribution in a fast and efficient way.

As a result, PSWFs\nare becoming increasing popular in various areas in which such function occur -\nthis includes physics (e.g. wave phenomena, fluid dynamics), engineering (e.g.\nsignal processing, filter design), etc.\n  To use PSWFs as a computational tool, one needs fast and accurate numerical\nalgorithms for the evaluation of PSWFs and related quantities, as well as for\nthe construction of quadratures, interpolation formulas, etc. Even though, for\nthe last half a century, substantial progress has been made in design of such\nalgorithms, the complexity of many of the existing algorithms, however, is at\nleast quadratic in the band limit $c$. For example, the evaluation of the $n$th\neigenvalue of the prolate integral operator requires at least $O(c^2)$\noperations. Therefore, while the existing algorithms are quite satisfactory for\nmoderate values of $c$ (e.g. $c \\leq 10^3$), they tend to be relatively slow\nwhen $c$ is large (e.g. $c \\geq 10^4$).\n  In this paper, we describe several numerical algorithms for the evaluation of\nPSWFs and related quantities, and design a class of PSWF-based quadratures for\nthe integration of bandlimited functions.

These schemes are obtained by spatially discretizing the Kolmogorov\nequation associated with the SDE in such a way that the resulting semi-discrete\nequation generates a Markov jump process that can be realized exactly using a\nMonte Carlo method. In this construction the spatial increment of the\napproximation can be bounded uniformly in space, which guarantees that the\nschemes are numerically stable for both finite and long time simulation of\nSDEs. By directly analyzing the generator of the approximation, we prove that\nthe approximation has a sharp stochastic Lyapunov function when applied to an\nSDE with a drift field that is locally Lipschitz continuous and weakly\ndissipative. We use this stochastic Lyapunov function to extend a local\nsemimartingale representation of the approximation. This extension permits to\nanalyze the complexity of the approximation. Using the theory of semigroups of\nlinear operators on Banach spaces, we show that the approximation is (weakly)\naccurate in representing finite and infinite-time statistics, with an order of\naccuracy identical to that of its generator.

Transfer functions associated with multi-input/multi-output (MIMO)\ndynamical systems typify the class of functions that we consider here. Others\nhave also considered extensions of VF to matrix-valued functions and related\nnumerical implementations are readily available. However to our knowledge, a\ndetailed analysis of numerical issues that arise does not yet exist.

Our interest is in the reconstruction of\npiecewise continuous fields in which the discontinuity set is described by a\nfinite number of geometric parameters. Natural applications include groundwater\nflow and electrical impedance tomography. We take a Bayesian approach, placing\na prior distribution on $u$ and determining the conditional distribution on $u$\ngiven the data $y$. It is then natural to study maximum a posterior (MAP)\nestimators. Recently (Dashti et al 2013) it has been shown that MAP estimators\ncan be characterised as minimisers of a generalised Onsager-Machlup functional,\nin the case where the prior measure is a Gaussian random field. We extend this\ntheory to a more general class of prior distributions which allows for\npiecewise continuous fields. Specifically, the prior field is assumed to be\npiecewise Gaussian with random interfaces between the different Gaussians\ndefined by a finite number of parameters.

One may then apply\nhigh-dimensional approximation methods to the solution map $y\\mapsto u(y)$.\nAlthough Karhunen-Lo\\`eve representations are commonly used, it was recently\nshown, in the relevant case of lognormal diffusion fields, that they do not\ngenerally yield optimal approximation rates.

In this process, individuals are the vertices of a connected graph $G$.\nInitially, there is a single mutant vertex, chosen uniformly at random. In each\nstep, a random vertex is selected for reproduction with a probability\nproportional to its fitness: mutants have fitness $r>1$, while non-mutants have\nfitness 1. The vertex chosen to reproduce places a copy of itself to a\nuniformly random neighbor in $G$, replacing the individual that was there. The\nprocess ends when the mutation either reaches fixation (i.e., all vertices are\nmutants), or gets extinct. The principal quantity of interest is the\nprobability with which each of the two outcomes occurs.\n  A problem that has received significant attention recently concerns the\nexistence of families of graphs, called strong amplifiers of selection, for\nwhich the fixation probability tends to 1 as the order $n$ of the graph\nincreases, and the existence of strong suppressors of selection, for which this\nprobability tends to 0. For the case of directed graphs, it is known that both\nstrong amplifiers and suppressors exist.

In the Lovas-Andai framework, the\nindependent variable $\\varepsilon \\in [0,1]$ is the ratio $\\sigma(V)$ of the\nsingular values of the $2 \\times 2$ matrix $V=D_2^{1/2} D_1^{-1/2}$ formed from\nthe two $2 \\times 2$ diagonal blocks ($D_1, D_2$) of a $4 \\times 4$ density\nmatrix $D$. In the Slater setting, the independent variable $\\mu$ is the\ndiagonal-entry ratio $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_{11} \\rho_{44}}{\\rho_{22}\n\\rho_{33}}}$--with, of central importance, $\\mu=\\varepsilon$ or\n$\\mu=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}$ when both $D_1$ and $D_2$ are themselves diagonal.\nLovas and Andai established that their two-rebit \"separability function\"\n$\\tilde{\\chi}_1 (\\varepsilon )$ ($\\approx \\varepsilon$) yields the previously\nconjectured Hilbert-Schmidt separability probability of $\\frac{29}{64}$. We are\nable, in the Slater framework (using cylindrical algebraic decompositions [CAD]\nto enforce positivity constraints), to reproduce this result. Further, we newly\nfind its two-qubit (yielding $\\frac{8}{33}$), two-quater[nionic]-bit (yielding\n$\\frac{26}{323}$) and \"two-octo[nionic]-bit\" (yielding $\\frac{44482}{4091349}$)\ncounterparts.

Such matched behavior\nmakes analysis of the bike sharing systems more difficult and challenging. This\npaper considers a more general large-scale bike sharing system from two\nimportant views: (a) Bikes move in an irreducible path graph, which is related\nto geographical structure of the bike sharing system; and (b) Markovian arrival\nprocesses (MAPs) are applied to describe the non-Poisson and burst behavior of\nbike-user (abbreviated as user) arrivals, while the burstiness demonstrates\nthat the user arrivals are time-inhomogeneous and space-heterogeneous in\npractice. For such a complicated bike sharing system, this paper establishes a\nmulticlass closed queueing network by means of some virtual ideas, for example,\nbikes are abstracted as virtual customers; stations and roads are regarded as\nvirtual nodes. Thus user arrivals are related to service times at station\nnodes; and users riding bikes on roads are viewed as service times at road\nnodes. Further, to deal with this multiclass closed queueing network, we\nprovide a detailed observation practically on physical behavior of the bike\nsharing system in order to establish the routing matrix, which gives a\nnonlinear solution to compute the relative arrival rates in terms of the\nproduct-form solution to the steady-state probabilities of joint queue lengths\nat the virtual nodes.

The\nPDEs in such applications are high-dimensional as the dimension corresponds to\nthe number of financial assets in a portfolio. Moreover, such PDEs are often\nfully nonlinear due to the need to incorporate certain nonlinear phenomena in\nthe model such as default risks, transaction costs, volatility uncertainty\n(Knightian uncertainty), or trading constraints in the model. Such\nhigh-dimensional fully nonlinear PDEs are exceedingly difficult to solve as the\ncomputational effort for standard approximation methods grows exponentially\nwith the dimension. In this work we propose a new method for solving\nhigh-dimensional fully nonlinear second-order PDEs. Our method can in\nparticular be used to sample from high-dimensional nonlinear expectations.

The theory\ndeveloped here shows that if the absorption is large enough, and if the\nsubdomain and coarse mesh diameters and overlap are chosen appropriately, then\nthe classical two-level overlapping Additive Schwarz preconditioner (with PEC\nboundary conditions on the subdomains) performs optimally -- in the sense that\nGMRES converges in a wavenumber-independent number of iterations -- for the\nproblem with absorption.

An important case, especially in quantum physics, is the\ncomputation of the spectrum of a Schr\\\"odinger operator with a disordered\npotential. Unlike plane waves or Bloch waves that arise as Schr\\\"odinger\neigenfunctions for periodic and other ordered potentials, for many forms of\ndisordered potentials the eigenfunctions remain essentially localized in a very\nsmall subset of the initial domain. A celebrated example is Anderson\nlocalization, for which, in a continuous version, the potential is a piecewise\nconstant function on a uniform grid whose values are sampled independently from\na uniform random distribution. We present here a new method for approximating\nthe eigenvalues and the subregions which support such localized eigenfunctions.\nThis approach is based on the recent theoretical tools of the localization\nlandscape and effective potential. The approach is deterministic, predicting\nquantities that depend sensitively on the particular realization, rather than\nfurnishing statistical or probabilistic results about the spectrum associated\nto a family of potentials with a certain distribution. These methods, which\nhave only been partially justified theoretically, enable the calculation of the\nlocations and shapes of the approximate supports of the eigenfunctions, the\napproximate values of many of the eigenvalues, and of the eigenvalue counting\nfunction and density of states, all at the cost of solving a single source\nproblem for the same elliptic operator.

They are based on a crucial full one order superconvergence of\nthe first order mixed Raviart-Thomas(RT for short) element. The main ingredient\nof such a superconvergence analysis is to employ a discrete Helmholtz\ndecomposition of the difference between the canonical interpolation and the\nfinite element solution of the RT element. In particular, it allows for some\nvital cancellation between terms in one key sum of boundary terms.\nConsequently, a full one order superconvergence follows from a special relation\nbetween the CR element and the RT element, and the equivalence between the ECR\nelement and the RT element for these two nonconforming elements. These\nsuperconvergence results improve those in literature from a half order to a\nfull one order for the RT element, the CR element and the ECR element. Based on\nthe aforementioned superconvergence of the RT element, asymptotic expansions of\neigenvalues are established and employed to achieve high accuracy extrapolation\nmethods for these two nonconforming elements. In contrast to a classic analysis\nin literature, the novelty herein is to use not only the canonical\ninterpolations of these nonconforming elements but also that of the RT element\nto analyze such asymptotic expansions.

Finally, two post-processing\nmethods are proposed to improve accuracy of approximate eigenvalues by\nemploying these a posteriori error estimators.Numerical tests are provided to\njustify and compare the performance of the aforementioned methods. \n\n"}

While this domain mapping method is quite\nefficient for theory and practice, since only a single domain discretisation is\nneeded, it also requires the knowledge of the domain mapping.\n  However, in certain applications, the random domain is only described by its\nrandom boundary, while the quantity of interest is defined on a fixed,\ndeterministic subdomain.

Further, it increases the order of convergence of the\ndiscretization in time which can be be exploited nicely, for instance, for\na-posteriori error control. The convergence behavior is shown by proving error\nestimates of optimal order in various norms. A bound of superconvergence at the\ndiscrete times nodes is included. To show the error estimates, a special\napproach is developed. Firstly, error estimates for the time derivative of the\npost-processed solution are proved.

This practice improves the\noriginal operator splitting approach in the Monte Carlo method, such as the\nseparated treatment of particle transport and collision. As a result, with the\nvariation of the ratio between numerical time step and local photon's collision\ntime, different transport physics can be fully captured in a single\ncomputation. In the diffusive limit, the UGKP method could recover the solution\nof the diffusion equation with the cell size and time step being much larger\nthan the photon's mean free path and the mean collision time.

The nonlinearity in the diffusion term of the SPDEs is\nassumed to be globally Lipschitz and the nonlinearity in the drift term is only\nassumed to satisfy a one-side Lipschitz condition. The semilinear SPDEs\nconsidered in this paper is a direct generalization of the SODEs considered in\n[13]. There are several difficulties which need to be overcome for this\ngeneralization. First, obviously the spatial discretization, which does not\nappear in the SODE case, adds an extra layer of difficulty. It turns out a\nspecial discretization must be designed to guarantee certain properties for the\nnumerical scheme and its stiffness matrix. In this paper we use a finite\nelement interpolation technique to discretize the nonlinear drift term. Second,\nin order to prove the strong convergence of the proposed fully discrete finite\nelement method, stability estimates for higher order moments of the\n$H^1$-seminorm of the numerical solution must be established, which are\ndifficult and delicate. A judicious combination of the properties of the drift\nand diffusion terms and a nontrivial technique borrowed from [16] is used in\nthis paper to achieve the goal. Finally, stability estimates for the second and\nhigher order moments of the $L^2$-norm of the numerical solution is also\ndifficult to obtain due to the fact that the mass matrix may not be diagonally\ndominant. This is done by utilizing the interpolation theory and the higher\nmoment estimates for the $H^1$-seminorm of the numerical solution. After\novercoming these difficulties, it is proved that the proposed fully discrete\nfinite element method is convergent in strong norms with nearly optimal rates\nof convergence. \n\n"}

The\nIB/WSI methodology is enabled by combining the distributed Lagrange multiplier\n(DLM) method of Sharma and Patankar (J Comp Phys, 2005) with a robust level set\nmethod based multiphase flow solver. The fluid solver integrates the\nconservative form of the variable-coefficient incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations using a hybrid preconditioner and ensures consistent transport of\nmass and momentum at a discrete level. The consistent transport scheme\npreserves the numerical stability of the method in the presence of large\ndensity ratios found in problems involving air, water, and an immersed\nstructure.

{"id": "1901.11269", "contents": "Title: Transport map accelerated adaptive importance sampling, and application\n  to inverse problems arising from multiscale stochastic reaction networks Abstract: In many applications, Bayesian inverse problems can give rise to probability\ndistributions which contain complexities due to the Hessian varying greatly\nacross parameter space. This complexity often manifests itself as lower\ndimensional manifolds on which the likelihood function is invariant, or varies\nvery little. This can be due to trying to infer unobservable parameters, or due\nto sloppiness in the model which is being used to describe the data. In such a\nsituation, standard sampling methods for characterising the posterior\ndistribution, which do not incorporate information about this structure, will\nbe highly inefficient.\n  In this paper, we seek to develop an approach to tackle this problem when\nusing adaptive importance sampling methods, by using optimal transport maps to\nsimplify posterior distributions which are concentrated on lower dimensional\nmanifolds. This approach is applicable to a whole range of problems for which\nMonte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) methods mix slowly.\n  We demonstrate the approach by considering inverse problems arising from\npartially observed stochastic reaction networks. In particular, we consider\nsystems which exhibit multiscale behaviour, but for which only the slow\nvariables in the system are observable. We demonstrate that certain multiscale\napproximations lead to more consistent approximations of the posterior than\nothers. The use of optimal transport maps stabilises the ensemble transform\nadaptive importance sampling (ETAIS) method, and allows for efficient sampling\nwith smaller ensemble sizes.

Our aim is to explain\nwhat the harmonic analysis on U(infinity) consists of.\n  We deal with unitary representations of a reasonable class, which are in 1-1\ncorrespondence with characters (central, positive definite, normalized\nfunctions on U(infinity)). The decomposition of any representation of this\nclass is described by a probability measure (called spectral measure) on the\nspace of indecomposable characters.

While there exists\nextensive theory for hypothesis testing under smooth cone alternatives with\nindependent observations, extension to correlated data under general convex\ncone alternatives remains an open problem. This long-pending problem is\naddressed by (1) establishing that a \"generalized quasi-score\" statistic is\nasymptotically equivalent to the squared length of the projection of the\nstandard Gaussian vector onto the convex cone and (2) showing that the\nasymptotic null distribution of the test statistic is a weighted chi-squared\ndistribution, where the weights are \"mixed volumes\" of the convex cone and its\npolar cone.
