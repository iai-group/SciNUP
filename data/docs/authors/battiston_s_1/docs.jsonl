We find that this emerging\nmarket exhibits strong correlations in the movement of stock prices compared to\ndeveloped markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This is shown to\nbe due to the dominant influence of a common market mode on the stock prices.\nBy comparison, interactions between related stocks, e.g., those belonging to\nthe same business sector, are much weaker. This lack of distinct sector\nidentity in emerging markets is explicitly shown by reconstructing the network\nof mutually interacting stocks. Spectral analysis of C for NSE reveals that,\nthe few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by\nrandom matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.\nWe show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions\nbetween stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics\nwith a two-factor model. Our results suggest that the emergence of an internal\nstructure comprising multiple groups of strongly coupled components is a\nsignature of market development. \n\n"}

An\nautomatic discovery of such structure is a fundamental task in many\ndisciplines, including sociology, biology, engineering, and computer science.\nRecently, several community discovery algorithms have been proposed based on\nthe optimization of a quantity called modularity (Q). However, the problem of\nmodularity optimization is NP-hard, and the existing approaches often suffer\nfrom prohibitively long running time or poor quality. Furthermore, it has been\nrecently pointed out that algorithms based on optimizing Q will have a\nresolution limit, i.e., communities below a certain scale may not be detected.\nIn this research, we first propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, Qcut,\nwhich combines spectral graph partitioning and local search to optimize Q.\nUsing both synthetic and real networks, we show that Qcut can find higher\nmodularities and is more scalable than the existing algorithms. Furthermore,\nusing Qcut as an essential component, we propose a recursive algorithm, HQcut,\nto solve the resolution limit problem. We show that HQcut can successfully\ndetect communities at a much finer scale and with a higher accuracy than the\nexisting algorithms. Finally, we apply Qcut and HQcut to study a\nprotein-protein interaction network, and show that the combination of the two\nalgorithms can reveal interesting biological results that may be otherwise\nundetectable. \n\n"}

To explore how accurate is the scaling and therefore understand the\nunderlined non-linear mechanism, we investigate intraday datasets of 500 stocks\nwhich consist of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. We show that the cumulative\ndistribution of return intervals has systematic deviations from scaling. We\nsupport this finding by studying the m-th moment $\\mu_m \\equiv\n<(\\tau/<\\tau>)^m>^{1/m}$, which show a certain trend with the mean interval\n$<\\tau>$. We generate surrogate records using the Schreiber method, and find\nthat their cumulative distributions almost collapse to a single curve and\nmoments are almost constant for most range of $<\\tau>$. Those substantial\ndifferences suggest that non-linear correlations in the original volatility\nsequence account for the deviations from a single scaling law. We also find\nthat the original and surrogate records exhibit slight tendencies for short and\nlong $<\\tau>$, due to the discreteness and finite size effects of the records\nrespectively.

The present article shows that, by\ntaking into account exponential decays of the stored activation, it is possible\nto identify the communities also in terms of the patterns of activation along\nthe initial steps of the transient dynamics.

In most cases, however, they have been studied from a fermionic\nperspective, in which each vertex can be occupied by at most one particle.\nWhile still useful, this approach suffers from some drawbacks, the most\nimportant probably being the difficulty to implement reactions involving more\nthan two particles simultaneously. Here we introduce a general framework for\nthe study of bosonic reaction-diffusion processes on complex networks, in which\nthere is no restriction on the number of interacting particles that a vertex\ncan host. We describe these processes theoretically by means of continuous time\nheterogeneous mean-field theory and divide them into two main classes: steady\nstate and monotonously decaying processes. We analyze specific examples of both\nbehaviors within the class of one-species process, comparing the results\n(whenever possible) with the corresponding fermionic counterparts. We find that\nthe time evolution and critical properties of the particle density are\nindependent of the fermionic or bosonic nature of the process, while\ndifferences exist in the functional form of the density of occupied vertices in\na given degree class k. We implement a continuous time Monte Carlo algorithm,\nwell suited for general bosonic simulations, which allow us to confirm the\nanalytical predictions formulated within mean-field theory. Our results, both\nat the theoretical and numerical level, can be easily generalized to tackle\nmore complex, multi-species, reaction-diffusion processes, and open a promising\npath for a general study and classification of this kind of dynamical systems\non complex networks. \n\n"}

Here, we investigate this question\nby focusing on the relation between capacity and load in different types of\nreal-world communication and transportation networks. We find strong empirical\nevidence that the actual capacity of the network elements tends to be similar\nto the maximum available capacity, if the cost is not strongly constraining. As\nmore weight is given to the cost, however, the capacity approaches the load\nnonlinearly. In particular, all systems analyzed show larger unoccupied\nportions of the capacities on network elements subjected to smaller loads,\nwhich is in sharp contrast with the assumptions involved in (linear) models\nproposed in previous theoretical studies. We describe the observed behavior of\nthe capacity-load relation as a function of the relative importance of the cost\nby using a model that optimizes capacities to cope with network traffic\nfluctuations.

They are either academic scientists, or high school teachers; we\nleave aside the {\\it philosophers} and the {\\it aficionados}. We discuss the\nscientific facts and publications they handled, the modernity of their\ninformation and the \"language\" they use to transmit their ideas. Finally, we\nconsider astronomers proper; first Charles Perrine, an astronomer interested in\nastrophysics, contracted by the government of Argentina in the USA as director\nof its main observatory. He became interested in testing the possible\ndeflection of light rays by the Sun towards 1912; his Argentine expedition was\nthe first to attempt that test. Perhaps Perrine was not so much interested in\nrelativity as in testing the particular astronomical effects it predicted. In\nany case, he attempted the test with the acquiescence and financial support of\nthe Argentine state, and as a leading member of its official scientific elite.\nWe contrast his very specific and strictly scientific efforts with those of our\nsecond astronomer, Jos\\'e Ubach, SJ, a secondary school teacher of science at a\nleading Buenos Aires Catholic school who reported in response to Eddington's\nexpedition. Finally, our third astronomer is F\\'elix Aguilar, who made an\neffort to contribute to the public understanding of Einstein's theories in\n1924, when Einstein's visit to Argentina had become a certainty.

In the\nmean-field approximation, the model produces a stationary wealth distribution\nwith a power-law tail. In this paper we examine characteristic time scales of\nthe model and show that for any finite number of agents, the validity of the\nmean-field result is time-limited and the model in fact has no stationary\nwealth distribution. Further analysis suggests that for heterogeneous agents,\nthe limitations are even stronger. We conclude with general implications of the\npresented results. \n\n"}

Although various dynamical\nprocesses have been investigated in scale-free small-world networks, analytical\nresearch about random walks on such networks is much less. In this paper, we\nwill study analytically the scaling of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for\nrandom walks on scale-free small-world networks. To this end, we first map the\nclassical Koch fractal to a network, called Koch network. According to this\nproposed mapping, we present an iterative algorithm for generating the Koch\nnetwork, based on which we derive closed-form expressions for the relevant\ntopological features, such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient,\naverage path length, and degree correlations. The obtained solutions show that\nthe Koch network exhibits scale-free behavior and small-world effect. Then, we\ninvestigate the standard random walks and trapping issue on the Koch network.\nThrough the recurrence relations derived from the structure of the Koch\nnetwork, we obtain the exact scaling for the MFPT.

The obtained analytical results are corroborated by direct\nextensive numerical calculations. In addition, we also determine the scaling\nefficiency exponents characterizing random walks on the Koch network. \n\n"}

Although the behavior of pedestrian crowds under\nextreme conditions is decisive for the safety of crowds during the access to or\negress from mass events as well as for situations of emergency evacuation,\nthere is still a lack of empirical studies of extreme crowding. Therefore, this\npaper discusses how one may study high-density conditions based on suitable\nvideo data.

Our results reveal previously unexpected pattern formation\nphenomena and show that the average individual speed does not go to zero even\nat local densities of 10 persons per square meter. Since the maximum density\nand flow are different from measurements in other countries, this has\nimplications for the capacity assessment and dimensioning of facilities for\nmass events.

Then, \"crowd turbulence\" sets in, which\nmay trigger crowd disasters. \n\n"}

The distribution $D(f)$ of the fraction\nof nodes with funnelling capacity $f$ shows a power law behaviour in random\nnetworks (with power law or stretched exponential degree distribution) for a\nconsiderable range of values of the parameters defining the networks.\nSpecifically we study in detail $D_1=D(f=1)$, which is the quantity signifying\nthe presence of nodes through which all the dynamical paths pass through.

One is a conflict at an exit when\npedestrians evacuate from a room. We use floor field model for simulating such\nbehavior, which is a well-studied pedestrian model using cellular automata. The\nconflicts have been taken into account by the friction parameter. However, the\nfriction parameter so far is a constant and does not depend on the number of\nthe pedestrians conflicting at the same time. Thus, we have improved the\nfriction parameter by the frictional function, which is a function of the\nnumber of the pedestrians involved in the conflict. Second, we have newly\nintroduced the cost of turning of pedestrians at the exit. Since pedestrians\nhave inertia, their walking speeds decrease when they turn, and the pedestrian\noutflow decreases.\n  The validity of the extended model, which includes the frictional function\nand the turning function, is verified by both a mean field theory and\nexperiments. In our experiments, the pedestrian flow increases when we put an\nobstacle in front of an exit. The analytical results clearly explains the\nmechanism of the effect of the obstacle, i.e., the obstacle blocks pedestrians\nmoving to the exit and decreases the average number of pedestrians involved in\nthe conflict. We have also found that an obstacle works more effectively when\nwe shift it from the center since pedestrians go through the exit with less\nturning. \n\n"}

To unify their description, we define the net fragility of a\nnode, which is the difference between its fragility and the threshold that\ndetermines its failure. Nodes fail if their net fragility grows above zero and\ntheir failure increases the fragility of neighbouring nodes, thus possibly\ntriggering a cascade. In this framework, we identify three classes depending on\nthe way the fragility of a node is increased by the failure of a neighbour. At\nthe microscopic level, we illustrate with specific examples how the failure\nspreading pattern varies with the node triggering the cascade, depending on its\nposition in the network and its degree. At the macroscopic level, systemic risk\nis measured as the final fraction of failed nodes, $X^\\ast$, and for each of\nthe three classes we derive a recursive equation to compute its value.

A protolanguage is a mapping\nbetween sounds and objects (or concepts) of the perceived world. This mapping\nis represented by a matrix and the linguistic interaction among individuals is\ndescribed by a random matrix model. There are two essential parameters in our\napproach. The strength of the linguistic interaction $\\beta$, which following\nChomsky's tradition, we consider as a genetically determined ability, and the\nnumber $N$ of employed sounds (the lexicon size). Our model of linguistic\ninteraction is analytically studied using methods of statistical physics and\nsimulated by Monte Carlo techniques.

It pervades\ncultural markets, and manifests itself in the adoption of scientific and\ntechnical innovations as well as the spread of social practices. Prior\nempirical work on the diffusion of innovations in spatial regions or social\nnetworks has largely focused on the spread of one particular technology among a\nsubset of all potential adopters. It has also been difficult to determine\nwhether the observed collective behaviour is driven by natural influence\nprocesses, or whether it follows external signals such as media or marketing\ncampaigns. Here, we choose an online context that allows us to study social\ninfluence processes by tracking the popularity of a complete set of\napplications installed by the user population of a social networking site, thus\ncapturing the behaviour of all individuals who can influence each other in this\ncontext. By extending standard fluctuation scaling methods, we analyse the\ncollective behaviour induced by 100 million application installations, and show\nthat two distinct regimes of behaviour emerge in the system. Once applications\ncross a particular threshold of popularity, social influence processes induce\nhighly correlated adoption behaviour among the users, which propels some of the\napplications to extraordinary levels of popularity. Below this threshold, the\ncollective effect of social influence appears to vanish almost entirely in a\nmanner that has not been observed in the offline world. Our results demonstrate\nthat even when external signals are absent, social influence can spontaneously\nassume an on-off nature in a digital environment.

Additionally, properties of previous epidemic\nmodels require prior knowledge of the complex network structure, which means\nthe models are limited to only well-known network structures. In this paper, we\npropose a new epidemiological SIR model based on the continuous time Markov\nchain, which is generalized to any type of network. The new model is capable of\nevaluating the states of every individual in the network. Through mathematical\nanalysis, we prove an epidemic threshold exists below which an epidemic does\nnot propagate in the network. We also show that the new epidemic threshold is\ninversely proportional to the spectral radius of the network.

Due to numerous limitations in sharing real-world graphs, models for\ngenerating massive graphs are critical for developing better algorithms. In\nthis paper, we analyze the stochastic Kronecker graph model (SKG), which is the\nfoundation of the Graph500 supercomputer benchmark due to its favorable\nproperties and easy parallelization. Our goal is to provide a deeper\nunderstanding of the parameters and properties of this model so that its\nfunctionality as a benchmark is increased. We develop a rigorous mathematical\nanalysis that shows this model cannot generate a power-law distribution or even\na lognormal distribution. However, we formalize an enhanced version of the SKG\nmodel that uses random noise for smoothing. We prove both in theory and in\npractice that this enhancement leads to a lognormal distribution. Additionally,\nwe provide a precise analysis of isolated vertices, showing that the graphs\nthat are produced by SKG might be quite different than intended. For example,\nbetween 50% and 75% of the vertices in the Graph500 benchmarks will be\nisolated.

This propensity,\nreferred to as assortative mixing or homophily, is expressed as the correlation\nbetween attribute values of nearest neighbour vertices in a graph. Recent\nresults indicate that beyond demographic features such as age, sex and race,\neven psychological states such as \"loneliness\" can be assortative in a social\nnetwork. In spite of the increasing societal importance of online social\nnetworks it is unknown whether assortative mixing of psychological states takes\nplace in situations where social ties are mediated solely by online networking\nservices in the absence of physical contact. Here, we show that general\nhappiness or Subjective Well-Being (SWB) of Twitter users, as measured from a 6\nmonth record of their individual tweets, is indeed assortative across the\nTwitter social network. To our knowledge this is the first result that shows\nassortative mixing in online networks at the level of SWB. Our results imply\nthat online social networks may be equally subject to the social mechanisms\nthat cause assortative mixing in real social networks and that such assortative\nmixing takes place at the level of SWB.

According to previous studies, it is the heterogeneity in\nindividual tagging behavior that gives rise to allometric growth.

We investigate this claim using the paradigm of\nsynchronization in a network of coupled oscillators. As the network evolves to\na global steady state, nodes belonging to the same community synchronize faster\nthan nodes belonging to different communities. Traditionally, nodes in network\nsynchronization models are coupled via one-to-one, or conservative\ninteractions. However, social interactions are often one-to-many, as for\nexample, in social media, where users broadcast messages to all their\nfollowers. We formulate a novel model of synchronization in a network of\ncoupled oscillators in which the oscillators are coupled via one-to-many, or\nnon-conservative interactions.

Rank all the co-authors of that individual according to their\nnumber of joint publications, giving a rank $r$ to each co-author, starting\nwith $r=1$ for the most prolific.\n  It is empirically found that a very simple relationship holds between the\nnumber of joint publications $J$ by coauthors and their rank of importance,\ni.e. $J \\propto 1/r$.

Specifically, given a query f and\na hypothesis H about the structure of a dataset D, we show generically how to\ntransform f into a new query f_H whose global sensitivity (over all datasets\nincluding those that do not satisfy H) matches the restricted sensitivity of\nthe query f. Moreover, if the belief of the querier is correct (i.e., D is in\nH) then f_H(D) = f(D). If the belief is incorrect, then f_H(D) may be\ninaccurate.\n  We demonstrate the usefulness of this notion by considering the task of\nanswering queries regarding social-networks, which we model as a combination of\na graph and a labeling of its vertices.

Here we show\nthe effect of speculators on food prices using a validated quantitative model\nthat accurately describes historical food prices. During the last six years,\nhigh and fluctuating food prices have lead to widespread hunger and social\nunrest. While a relative dip in food prices occurred during the spring of 2012,\na massive drought in the American Midwest in June and July threatens to trigger\nanother crisis. In a previous paper, we constructed a model that quantitatively\nagreed with food prices and demonstrated that, while the behavior could not be\nexplained by supply and demand economics, it could be parsimoniously and\naccurately described by a model which included both the conversion of corn into\nethanol and speculator trend following. An update to the original paper in\nFebruary 2012 demonstrated that the model previously published was predictive\nof the ongoing price dynamics, and anticipated a new food crisis by the end of\n2012 if adequate policy actions were not implemented. Here we provide a second\nupdate, evaluating the effects of the current drought on global food prices. We\nfind that the drought may trigger the expected third food price bubble to occur\nsooner, before new limits to speculation are scheduled to take effect. Reducing\nthe amount of corn that is being converted to ethanol may address the immediate\ncrisis. Over the longer term, market stabilization requires limiting financial\nspeculation. \n\n"}

We show that a user can improve his information access\nby linking to active users, though this becomes less effective as the number of\nfriends, or their activity, grows due to structural network constraints. These\nconstraints arise because users in structurally diverse position within the\nfollower graph have topically diverse interests from their friends. Moreover,\nthough in most cases user's friends are exposed to almost all the information\navailable in the network, after they make their recommendations, the user sees\nonly a small fraction of the available information. Our study suggests that\ncognitive and structural bottlenecks limit access to novel information in\nonline social networks. \n\n"}

Recent de-anonymization attacks on Netflix and AOL\ndatasets show that an open access to such graphs pose privacy threats. Among\nthe various privacy preserving models, Differential privacy provides the\nstrongest privacy guarantees.\n  In this paper we propose a privacy preserving mechanism for publishing social\nnetwork graph data, which satisfies differential privacy guarantees by\nutilizing a combination of theory of random matrix and that of differential\nprivacy. The key idea is to project each row of an adjacency matrix to a low\ndimensional space using the random projection approach and then perturb the\nprojected matrix with random noise. We show that as compared to existing\napproaches for differential private approximation of eigenvectors, our approach\nis computationally efficient, preserves the utility and satisfies differential\nprivacy. We evaluate our approach on social network graphs of Facebook, Live\nJournal and Pokec. The results show that even for high values of noise variance\nsigma=1 the clustering quality given by normalized mutual information gain is\nas low as 0.74. For influential node discovery, the propose approach is able to\ncorrectly recover 80 of the most influential nodes. We also compare our results\nwith an approach presented in [43], which directly perturbs the eigenvector of\nthe original data by a Laplacian noise. The results show that this approach\nrequires a large random perturbation in order to preserve the differential\nprivacy, which leads to a poor estimation of eigenvectors for large social\nnetworks. \n\n"}

The\nsevere drought in the US in the summer of 2012 led to a new increase in food\nprices. Through the fall, they remained at a threshold above which the riots\nand revolutions had predominantly occurred. Global prices at this level create\nconditions where an exacerbating local circumstance can trigger unrest. Global\ncorn (maize) prices reached new highs, and countries that depend mostly on\nmaize are more likely to experience high local food prices and associated\npressures toward social unrest. Here we analyze the conditions in South Africa,\nwhich is a heavily maize-dependent country. Coinciding with increased consumer\nfood indices this summer, massive labor strikes in mining and agriculture have\nled to the greatest single incident of social violence since the fall of\napartheid in 1994. Worker demands for dramatic pay increases reflect that their\nwages have not kept up with drastic increases in the prices of necessities,\nespecially food. Without attention to the global food price situation, more\nincidents of food-based social instability are likely to arise. Other countries\nthat have manifested food-related protests and riots in 2012 include Haiti and\nArgentina. Moreover, these cases of unrest are just the most visible symptom of\nwidespread suffering of poor populations worldwide due to elevated food prices.\nPolicy decisions that would directly impact food prices are decreasing the\nconversion of maize to ethanol in the US, and reimposing regulations on\ncommodity futures markets to prevent excessive speculation, which we have shown\ncauses bubbles and crashes in these markets. Absent such policy actions,\ngovernments and companies should track and mitigate the impact of high and\nvolatile food prices on citizens and employees. \n\n"}

However, conventional\noptimisation models lack detail on these aspects and have limited ability to\naddress the effectiveness of policy interventions because they do not represent\ndecision-making.

In a viral marketing campaign, a firm initially\ntargets a small set of pioneers and hopes that they would influence a sizeable\nfraction of the population by diffusion of influence through the network. In\ngeneral, any marketing campaign might fail to go viral in the first try. As\nsuch, it would be useful to have some guide to evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe campaign and judge whether it is worthy of further resources, and in case\nthe campaign has potential, how to hit upon a good pioneer who can make the\ncampaign go viral. In this paper, we present a diffusion model developed by\nenriching the generalized random graph (a.k.a. configuration model) to provide\ninsight into these questions. We offer the intuition behind the results on this\nmodel, rigorously proved in Blaszczyszyn & Gaurav(2013), and illustrate them\nhere by taking examples of random networks having prototypical degree\ndistributions - Poisson degree distribution, which is commonly used as a kind\nof benchmark, and Power Law degree distribution, which is normally used to\napproximate the real-world networks. On these networks, the members are assumed\nto have varying attitudes towards propagating the information. We analyze three\ncases, in particular - (1) Bernoulli transmissions, when a member influences\neach of its friend with probability p; (2) Node percolation, when a member\ninfluences all its friends with probability p and none with probability 1-p;\n(3) Coupon-collector transmissions, when a member randomly selects one of his\nfriends K times with replacement. We assume that the configuration model is the\nclosest approximation of a large online social network, when the information\navailable about the network is very limited. The key insight offered by this\nstudy from a firm's perspective is regarding how to evaluate the effectiveness\nof a marketing campaign and do cost-benefit analysis by collecting relevant\nstatistical data from the pioneers it selects. The campaign evaluation\ncriterion is informed by the observation that if the parameters of the\nunderlying network and the campaign effectiveness are such that the campaign\ncan indeed reach a significant fraction of the population, then the set of good\npioneers also forms a significant fraction of the population. Therefore, in\nsuch a case, the firms can even adopt the naive strategy of repeatedly picking\nand targeting some number of pioneers at random from the population. With this\nstrategy, the probability of them picking a good pioneer will increase\ngeometrically fast with the number of tries. \n\n"}

Previously, researchers surmised that a single general concept may act\nas a unifying underlying generative mechanism, with the theory of self\norganized criticality being a weighty contender.\n  Consequently, a substantial amount of effort has gone into developing new and\nextended models and, hitherto, three classes of models have emerged.

Within this approach the steady state is\nclose to criticality in terms of an absorbing phase transition.

It is most common to study community\nstructure, but numerous other types of mesoscale structures also exist. In this\npaper, we examine core-periphery structures based on both density and\ntransport. In such structures, core network components are well-connected both\namong themselves and to peripheral components, which are not well-connected to\nanything. We examine core-periphery structures in a wide range of examples of\ntransportation, social, and financial networks---including road networks in\nlarge urban areas, a rabbit warren, a dolphin social network, a European\ninterbank network, and a migration network between counties in the United\nStates.

Two important classes\nof networks, small world and scale free networks have gained a lot of research\ninterest. Another important characteristic of social networks is the presence\nof community structures. Many social processes such as information diffusion\nand disease epidemics depend on the presence of community structures making it\nan important property for network generation models to be incorporated. In this\npaper, we present a tunable and growing network generation model with small\nworld and scale free properties as well as the presence of community\nstructures. The major contribution of this model is that the communities thus\ncreated satisfy three important structural properties: connectivity within each\ncommunity follows power-law, communities have high clustering coefficient and\nhierarchical community structures are present in the networks generated using\nthe proposed model. Furthermore, the model is highly robust and capable of\nproducing networks with a number of different topological characteristics\nvarying clustering coefficient and inter-cluster edges. Our simulation results\nshow that the model produces small world and scale free networks along with the\npresence of communities depicting real world societies and social networks. \n\n"}

In online systems, product\ndesigners can define how peer exposure mechanisms work: adoption behaviors can\nbe shared in a passive, automatic fashion, or occur through explicit, active\nsharing. The consequences of these mechanisms are of substantial practical and\ntheoretical interest: passive sharing may increase total peer exposure but\nactive sharing may expose higher quality products to peers who are more likely\nto adopt.\n  We examine selection effects in online sharing through a large-scale field\nexperiment on Facebook that randomizes whether or not adopters share Offers\n(coupons) in a passive manner. We derive and estimate a joint discrete choice\nmodel of adopters' sharing decisions and their peers' adoption decisions. Our\nresults show that active sharing enables a selection effect that exposes peers\nwho are more likely to adopt than the population exposed under passive sharing.\n  We decompose the selection effect into two distinct mechanisms: active\nsharers expose peers to higher quality products, and the peers they share with\nare more likely to adopt independently of product quality.

While Western online\nsocial networks such as Twitter have been well studied, the popular Chinese\nmicroblogging network Sina Weibo has had relatively lower exposure. In this\npaper, we analyze in detail the temporal aspect of trends and trend-setters in\nSina Weibo, contrasting it with earlier observations in Twitter. We find that\nthere is a vast difference in the content shared in China when compared to a\nglobal social network such as Twitter.

One of our key findings is that retweets are much more\ncommon in Sina Weibo and contribute a lot to creating trends. When we look\ncloser, we observe that most trends in Sina Weibo are due to the continuous\nretweets of a small percentage of fraudulent accounts. These fake accounts are\nset up to artificially inflate certain posts, causing them to shoot up into\nSina Weibo's trending list, which are in turn displayed as the most popular\ntopics to users. \n\n"}

Secure electrical power supply requires, together with\ncareful operation, a robust design of the electrical power grid topology. This\npaper investigates the impact of a power grid topology on its robustness\nagainst cascading failures. Currently, the impact of the topology on a grid\nrobustness is mainly assessed by using purely topological approaches that fail\nto capture the essence of electric power flow.

Such systems are therefore naturally described in\nterms of multiplex or multi-layer networks, i.e. networks where each layer\nstands for a different type of interaction between the same set of nodes. There\nis today a growing interest in understanding when and why a description in\nterms of a multiplex network is necessary and more informative than a\nsingle-layer projection. Here, we contribute to this debate by presenting a\ncomprehensive study of correlations in multiplex networks. Correlations in node\nproperties, especially degree-degree correlations, have been thoroughly studied\nin single-layer networks. Here we extend this idea to investigate and\ncharacterize correlations between the different layers of a multiplex network.\nSuch correlations are intrinsically multiplex, and we first study them\nempirically by constructing and analyzing several multiplex networks from the\nreal-world. In particular, we introduce various measures to characterize\ncorrelations in the activity of the nodes and in their degree at the different\nlayers, and between activities and degrees. We show that real-world networks\nexhibit indeed non-trivial multiplex correlations. For instance, we find cases\nwhere two layers of the same multiplex network are positively correlated in\nterms of node degrees, while other two layers are negatively correlated.

In this paper, we adopt a complementary\nperspective that \"communities\" are associated with bottlenecks of\nlocally-biased dynamical processes that begin at seed sets of nodes, and we\nemploy several different community-identification procedures (using\ndiffusion-based and geodesic-based dynamics) to investigate community quality\nas a function of community size. Using several empirical and synthetic\nnetworks, we identify several distinct scenarios for ``size-resolved community\nstructure'' that can arise in real (and realistic) networks. Depending on which\nscenario holds, one may or may not be able to successfully identify ``good''\ncommunities in a given network, the manner in which different small communities\nfit together to form meso-scale network structures can be very different, and\nprocesses such as viral propagation and information diffusion can exhibit very\ndifferent dynamics.In addition, our results suggest that, for many large\nrealistic networks, the output of locally-biased methods that focus on\ncommunities that are centered around a given seed node might have better\nconceptual grounding and greater practical utility than the output of global\ncommunity-detection methods.

The critical point is stretched to\na finite region, called the critical phase, on nonamenable graphs.

In this\npaper, we are interested in finding a source estimator that is applicable to\nvarious spreading models, including the Susceptible-Infected (SI),\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR), Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Infected\n(SIRI), and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) models. We show that under\nthe SI, SIR and SIRI spreading models and with mild technical assumptions, the\nJordan center is the infection source associated with the most likely infection\npath in a tree network with a single infection source. This conclusion applies\nfor a wide range of spreading parameters, while it holds for regular trees\nunder the SIS model with homogeneous infection and recovery rates.

Bipartite networks represent diverse interaction\npatterns in many real-world systems, such as predator-prey networks,\nplant-pollinator networks, and drug-target networks. While community detection\nin unipartite networks has been extensively studied in the past decade,\nidentification of modules or communities in bipartite networks is still in its\nearly stage.

New Insights from Statistical Physics Abstract: During last years poker has gained a lot of prestige in several countries\nand, beyond to be one of the most famous card games, it represents a modern\nchallenge for scientists belonging to different communities, spanning from\nartificial intelligence to physics and from psychology to mathematics. Unlike\ngames like chess, the task of classifying the nature of poker (i.e., as 'skill\ngame' or gambling) seems really hard and it also constitutes a current problem,\nwhose solution has several implications. In general, gambling offers equal\nwinning probabilities both to rational players (i.e., those that use a\nstrategy) and to irrational ones (i.e., those without a strategy). Therefore,\nin order to uncover the nature of poker, a viable way is comparing performances\nof rational versus irrational players during a series of challenges. Recently,\na work on this topic revealed that rationality is a fundamental ingredient to\nsucceed in poker tournaments. In this study we analyze a simple model of poker\nchallenges by a statistical physics approach, with the aim to uncover the\nnature of this game. As main result we found that, under particular conditions,\nfew irrational players can turn poker into gambling. Therefore, although\nrationality is a key ingredient to succeed in poker, also the format of\nchallenges has an important role in these dynamics, as it can strongly\ninfluence the underlying nature of the game. The importance of our results lies\non related implications, as for instance in identifying the limits poker can be\nconsidered as a `skill game' and, as a consequence, which kind of format must\nbe chosen to devise algorithms able to face humans. \n\n"}

Inspired by the formation mechanism of human's\nphysical sensations to external stimuli, we propose a new method to detect the\ninfluence of spreading by constructing excitable sensor networks. Exploiting\nthe amplifying effect of excitable sensor networks, our method can better\ndetect small-scale spreading processes. At the same time, it can also\ndistinguish large-scale diffusion instances due to the self-inhibition effect\nof excitable elements. Through simulations of diverse spreading dynamics on\ntypical real-world social networks (facebook, coauthor and email social\nnetworks), we find that the excitable senor networks are capable of detecting\nand ranking spreading processes in a much wider range of influence than other\ncommonly used sensor placement methods, such as random, targeted, acquaintance\nand distance strategies. In addition, we validate the efficacy of our method\nwith diffusion data from a real-world online social system, Twitter. We find\nthat our method can detect more spreading topics in practice. Our approach\nprovides a new direction in spreading detection and should be useful for\ndesigning effective detection methods. \n\n"}

We apply this framework to a massive dataset of news articles\nspanning the six years of Obama's presidency and all of his speeches, and\nreveal that a systematic pattern does indeed emerge from the outlet's quoting\nbehavior.

A model of\nmulti-layer flow network is proposed for modelling and analyzing multiple types\nof flows in flow systems. Then, flow distances are introduced, and symmetric\nminimum flow distance is presented. Subsequently, we discuss the establishment\nof the multi-layer flow networks of international trade from two coupled\nviewpoints, i.e., the viewpoint of commodity flow and that of money flow. Thus,\nthe multi-layer flow networks of international trade is explored. First,\ntrading \"trophic levels\" are adopted to depict positions that economies\noccupied in the flow network. We find that the distributions of trading\n\"trophic levels\" have the similar clustering pattern for different types of\ncommodity, and there are some regularities between money flow network and\ncommodity flow network.

Recently, dynamic message-passing (DMP) has been\nproposed as an efficient algorithm for simulating epidemic models on networks,\nand in particular for estimating the probability that a given node will become\ninfectious at a particular time. To date, DMP has been applied exclusively to\nmodels with one-way state changes, as opposed to models like SIS\n(susceptible-infectious-susceptible) and SIRS\n(susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible) where nodes can return to\npreviously inhabited states. Because many real-world epidemics can exhibit such\nrecurrent dynamics, we propose a DMP algorithm for complex, recurrent epidemic\nmodels on networks. Our approach takes correlations between neighboring nodes\ninto account while preventing causal signals from backtracking to their\nimmediate source, and thus avoids \"echo chamber effects\" where a pair of\nadjacent nodes each amplify the probability that the other is infectious. We\ndemonstrate that this approach well approximates results obtained from Monte\nCarlo simulation and that its accuracy is often superior to the pair\napproximation (which also takes second-order correlations into account).\nMoreover, our approach is more computationally efficient than the pair\napproximation, especially for complex epidemic models: the number of variables\nin our DMP approach grows as $2mk$ where $m$ is the number of edges and $k$ is\nthe number of states, as opposed to $mk^2$ for the pair approximation.

The\nstrength of these social influences are controlled by two parameters: $F$, the\nnumber of features that characterizes the cultures and $q$, the common number\nof states each feature can assume. Here we assume that the innovation is a new\nstate of a cultural feature of a single individual -- the innovator -- and\nstudy how the innovation spreads through the networks among the individuals.\nFor infinite regular lattices in one (1D) and two dimensions (2D), we find that\ninitially the successful innovation spreads linearly with the time $t$, but in\nthe long-time limit it spreads diffusively ($\\sim t^{1/2}$) in 1D and\nsub-diffusively ($\\sim t/\\ln t$) in 2D. For finite lattices, the growth curves\nfor the number of adopters are typically concave functions of $t$. For random\ngraphs with a finite number of nodes $N$, we argue that the classical S-shaped\ngrowth curves result from a trade-off between the average connectivity $K$ of\nthe graph and the per feature diversity $q$. A large $q$ is needed to reduce\nthe pace of the initial spreading of the innovation and thus delimit the\nearly-adopters stage, whereas a large $K$ is necessary to ensure the onset of\nthe take-off stage at which the number of adopters grows superlinearly with\n$t$.

This is very realistic for infrastructure across cities. Each city\nhas its own infrastructures and different infrastructures are dependent within\nthe city. However, each infrastructure is connected within and between cities.\nFor example, a power grid will connect many cities as will a communication\nnetwork, yet a power station and communication tower that are interdependent\nwill likely be in the same city.

In contrast, sensitive agents can decide either to live peacefully\nadjusting their way of life to the core one, or to oppose it with eventually\njoining violent activities. The interplay dynamics between peaceful and\nopponent sensitive agents is driven by pairwise interactions.

However,\nthey have largely ignored the fact that individuals make decisions on whether\nto create links to other individuals based on cost and benefit of linking, and\nthe fact that individuals may use perception of the network in their decision\nmaking. In this paper, we study the evolution of social networks in terms of\nperception-based strategic link formation. Here each individual has her own\nperception of the actual network, and uses it to decide whether to create a\nlink to another individual. An individual with the least perception accuracy\ncan benefit from updating her perception using that of the most accurate\nindividual via a new link. This benefit is compared to the cost of linking in\ndecision making. Once a new link is created, it affects the accuracies of other\nindividuals' perceptions, leading to a further evolution of the actual network.\nAs for initial actual networks, we consider homogeneous and heterogeneous\ncases. The homogeneous initial actual network is modeled by Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi\n(ER) random networks, while we take a star network for the heterogeneous case.\nIn any cases, individual perceptions of the actual network are modeled by ER\nrandom networks with controllable linking probability. Then the stable link\ndensity of the actual network is found to show discontinuous transitions or\njumps according to the cost of linking. As the number of jumps is the\nconsequence of the dynamical complexity, we discuss the effect of initial\nconditions on the number of jumps to find that the dynamical complexity\nstrongly depends on how much individuals initially overestimate or\nunderestimate the link density of the actual network. For the heterogeneous\ncase, the role of the highly connected individual as an information spreader is\ndiscussed. \n\n"}

Specifically, we seek to\ndescribe the conditions under which it is optimal to build decentralized\nnetwork infrastructures, such as a microgrid, rather than centralized ones,\nsuch as a large high-voltage power system. While our method is simple it is\nuseful in explaining why sometimes, but not always, it is economical to build\nlarge, interconnected networks and in other cases it is preferable to use\nsmaller, distributed systems. The results indicate that there is not a single\nset of infrastructure cost conditions under which optimally-designed networks\nwill have highly centralized architectures.

When we\nconsider the reliability costs, however, we do observe a transition point at\nwhich optimally designed networks become more centralized with larger\ngeographic scope. As the losses associated with node and edge failures become\nmore costly, this transition becomes more sudden. \n\n"}

The effect of such events can be analyzed from several\nperspectives, one of them being the intensity and characteristics of the\ncollective activity that it produces in the social platform. We research 5,234\nreal-world news events encompassing 43 million messages discussed on the\nTwitter microblogging service for approximately 1 year.

The crucial assumption underlying this\nmathematical and computational \"technology transfer\" is that the evolving\nstates of the nodes in a network quickly become correlated with the\ncorresponding node \"identities\": features of the nodes imparted by the network\nstructure (e.g. the node degree, the node clustering coefficient). The node\ndynamics thus depend on heterogeneous (rather than uncertain) parameters, whose\ndistribution over the network results from the network structure. Knowing these\ndistributions allows us to obtain an efficient coarse-grained representation of\nthe network state in terms of the expansion coefficients in suitable orthogonal\npolynomials. This representation is closely related to\nmathematical/computational tools for uncertainty quantification (the Polynomial\nChaos approach and its associated numerical techniques).

We begin an investigation into this broad domain by studying robust\nalgorithms for the Influence Maximization problem, in which the goal is to\nidentify a set of k nodes in a social network whose joint influence on the\nnetwork is maximized.\n  We define a Robust Influence Maximization framework wherein an algorithm is\npresented with a set of influence functions, typically derived from different\ninfluence models or different parameter settings for the same model. The\ndifferent parameter settings could be derived from observed cascades on\ndifferent topics, under different conditions, or at different times. The\nalgorithm's goal is to identify a set of k nodes who are simultaneously\ninfluential for all influence functions, compared to the (function-specific)\noptimum solutions.\n  We show strong approximation hardness results for this problem unless the\nalgorithm gets to select at least a logarithmic factor more seeds than the\noptimum solution.

We show that\nthe computational complexity of CI is O(N log N) when removing nodes\none-by-one, with N the number of nodes. This is made possible by using an\nappropriate data structure to process the CI values, and by the finite radius l\nof the CI sphere. Furthermore, we introduce a simple extension of CI when l is\ninfinite, the CI propagation (CI_P) algorithm, that considers the global\noptimization of influence via message passing in the whole network and\nidentifies a slightly smaller fraction of influencers than CI. Remarkably, CI_P\nis able to reproduce the exact analytical optimal percolation threshold\nobtained by Bau, Wormald, Random Struct.

Among several theories, network reciprocity --\na model of inhomogeneous social interactions -- has been proposed as an\nenabling mechanism to explain the emergence of cooperation. Existing\nevolutionary models of this mechanism have tended to focus on highly\nheterogeneous (scale-free) networks, hence typically assume preferential\nattachment mechanisms, and consequently the prerequisite that individuals have\nglobal network knowledge. Within an evolutionary game theoretic context, using\nthe weak prisoner's dilemma as a metaphor for cooperation, we present a minimal\nmodel which describes network growth by chronological random addition of new\nnodes, combined with regular attrition of less fit members of the population.\nSpecifically our model does not require that agents have access to global\ninformation and does not assume scale-free network structure or a preferential\nattachment mechanism. Further our model supports the emergence of cooperation\nfrom initially non-cooperative populations. By reducing dependency on a number\nof assumptions, this model offers broad applicability and as such may support\nan explanation of the emergence of cooperation in early evolutionary\ntransitions, where few assumptions can be made. \n\n"}

People with more friends experience greater interactive\neffects and hence engage more in socially influenced activities. Given the\nfriendship paradox, people then perceive more engagement when sampling their\nfriends than exists in the overall population. Given the complementarities,\nthis feeds back to amplify average engagement. In addition, people with the\ngreatest innate benefits from a behavior also tend to be the ones who choose to\ninteract the most, leading to further feedback and amplification. These results\nare consistent with studies finding that people consistently overestimate peer\nconsumption of alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs; and, can help explain problems\nwith adolescent abuse of drugs and binge-drinking, as well as other behaviors.\nI also discuss how these results change in cases of strategic substitutes,\nwhere individuals overestimate free-riding by peers. \n\n"}

In the present work, we compare different quasistationary (QS)\nsimulation methods where the absorbing states are suitably handled and the\nthermodynamical limit of the original dynamics can be achieved.

However, it is still unclear whether the road to\nhierarchical complexity is determined by the particularities of each phenomena,\nor if there are universal mechanisms of stratification common to many systems.\nHuman sports and games, with their (varied but simplified) rules of competition\nand measures of performance, serve as an ideal test bed to look for universal\nfeatures of hierarchy formation.

A network's\nclustering can be a useful indicator of its connectedness and community\nstructure. Algorithms for generating networks with high clustering have been\ndeveloped, but typically rely on adding or removing edges and nodes, sometimes\nfrom a completely empty network. Here, we introduce algorithms that create a\nhighly clustered network by starting with an existing network and rearranging\nedges, without adding or removing them; these algorithms can preserve other\nnetwork properties even as the clustering increases. They rely on local\nrewiring rules, in which a single edge changes one of its vertices in a way\nthat is guaranteed to increase clustering. This greedy step can be applied\niteratively to transform a random network into a form with much higher\nclustering. Additionally, the algorithms presented grow a network's clustering\nfaster than they increase its path length, meaning that network enters a regime\nof comparatively high clustering and low path length: a small world.

Fundamentally, the unknown graph encodes\ndirect relationships between signal elements, which we aim to recover from\nobservable indirect relationships generated by a diffusion process on the\ngraph. The fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from convex\noptimization and stationarity of graph signals, in order to identify the graph\nshift operator (a matrix representation of the graph) given only its\neigenvectors. These spectral templates can be obtained, e.g., from the sample\ncovariance of independent graph signals diffused on the sought network. The\nnovel idea is to find a graph shift that, while being consistent with the\nprovided spectral information, endows the network with certain desired\nproperties such as sparsity. To that end we develop efficient inference\nalgorithms stemming from provably-tight convex relaxations of natural nonconvex\ncriteria, particularizing the results for two shifts: the adjacency matrix and\nthe normalized Laplacian. Algorithms and theoretical recovery conditions are\ndeveloped not only when the templates are perfectly known, but also when the\neigenvectors are noisy or when only a subset of them are given.

Due to the extreme\ndifficulty of reducing the time complexity of exact BC determining problem,\nmany researchers have considered the possibility of any satisfactory BC\napproximation algorithms, especially those based on samplings. Bader et al.\ngive the currently best BC approximation algorithm, with a high probability to\nsuccessfully estimate the BC of one vertex within a factor of $1/\\varepsilon$\nusing $\\varepsilon t$ samples, where $t$ is the ratio between $n^2$ and the BC\nvalue of the vertex. However, some of the algorithmic parameters in Bader's\nwork are not yet tightly bounded, leaving some space to improve their\nalgorithm. In this project, we revisit Bader's algorithm, give more tight\nbounds on the estimations, and improve the performance of the approximation\nalgorithm, i.e., fewer samples and lower factors.

In the study of multilayer networks, it is\nimportant to investigate mesoscale (i.e., intermediate-scale) structures, such\nas dense sets of nodes known as communities, to discover network features that\nare not apparent at the microscale or the macroscale. The ill-defined nature of\nmesoscale structure and its ubiquity in empirical networks make it crucial to\ndevelop generative models that can produce the features that one encounters in\nempirical networks. Key purposes of such generative models include generating\nsynthetic networks with empirical properties of interest, benchmarking\nmesoscale-detection methods and algorithms, and inferring structure in\nempirical multilayer networks.

The model is intended to understand diffusion of influence, or any\nother spreading process implying a threshold dynamics, in setups of\ninterconnected networks with significant clustering. The contagion is assumed\nto be general enough to account for a content-dependent linear threshold model,\nwhere each link type has a different weight (for spreading influence) that may\ndepend on the content (e.g., product, rumor, political view) that is being\nspread. Using the generating functions formalism, we determine the conditions,\nprobability, and expected size of the emergent global cascades. This analysis\nprovides a generalization of previous approaches and is specially useful in\nproblems related to spreading and percolation. The results present non trivial\ndependencies between the clustering coefficient of the networks and its average\ndegree. In particular, several phase transitions are shown to occur depending\non these descriptors. Generally speaking, our findings reveal that increasing\nclustering decreases the probability of having global cascades and their size,\nhowever this tendency changes with the average degree. There exists a certain\naverage degree from which on clustering favours the probability and size of the\ncontagion.

To capture both self-healing and contagion, this paper considers a\ngraphical model representation of an interdependent cyber-physical system, in\nwhich nodes represent various cyber or physical functionalities, and edges\ncapture the interactions between the nodes. A message-passing algorithm is\nproposed for this representation to study the dynamics of failure propagation\nand healing.

Whereas such a model seems\nappropriate to understand the effect of interdependencies in the simplest\nscenario of a network composed of only two layers, it may seem not suitable to\ncharacterize the robustness of real systems formed by multiple network layers.\nIt seems in fact unrealistic that a real system, evolved, through the\ndevelopment of multiple layers of interactions, towards a fragile structure. In\nthis paper, we introduce a model of percolation where the condition that makes\na node functional is that the node is functioning in at least two of the layers\nof the network. The model reduces to the commonly adopted percolation model for\nmultiplex networks when the number of layers equals two. For larger number of\nlayers, however, the model describes a scenario where the addition of new\nlayers boosts the robustness of the system by creating redundant\ninterdependencies among layers. We prove this fact thanks to the development of\na message-passing theory able to characterize the model in both synthetic and\nreal-world multiplex graphs. \n\n"}

An essential approach\nconsists in using, as an \"a priori\" information, previous observations and\nmeasurements. The formal tools used in our analysis consists in: (1)\nassociating a digraph to the network where the edges correspond to arteries and\nthe vertices with loops represent the sites. (2) From an initial set of\nnumbers, that are the distribution of vehicles within the network, we construct\na matrix that we transform into a stochastic matrix (SM) by normalizing the\nrows, whose entries are now transition probabilities. This matrix becomes the\ngenerator of the evolution of the traffic flow. And (3), we use the\nPerron-Frobenius theory for a formal analysis. We investigate three models: (a)\na closed four-site network having a conserved number of vehicles; (b) to this\nnetwork we add an influx and an outflux of vehicles to characterize an open\nsystem; asymptotically, $n \\rightarrow \\infty$, the SM raised to the power $n$\ngoes to a unique stationary matrix.

Each state represents the traffic for $L$ different moments. These\nmodels were used to analyze the traffic in a sector of the city of Tigre,\nlocated in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

While there are many\nways to formalize it, one of the most popular is as an inference problem, where\nthere is a \"ground truth\" community structure built into the graph somehow. The\ntask is then to recover the ground truth knowing only the graph.\n  Recently it was discovered, first heuristically in physics and then\nrigorously in probability and computer science, that this problem has a phase\ntransition at which it suddenly becomes impossible. Namely, if the graph is too\nsparse, or the probabilistic process that generates it is too noisy, then no\nalgorithm can find a partition that is correlated with the planted one---or\neven tell if there are communities, i.e., distinguish the graph from a purely\nrandom one with high probability.

Thus, the memory prone SIR model dynamics is\ninvestigated using fractional derivatives. The decay of long-range memory,\ntaken as a power-law function, is directly controlled by the order of the\nfractional derivatives in the corresponding nonlinear fractional differential\nevolution equations. Here we assume \"fully mixed\" approximation and show that\nthe epidemic threshold is shifted to higher values than those for the\nmemoryless system, depending on this memory \"length\" decay exponent. We also\nconsider the SIR model on structured networks and study the effect of topology\non threshold points in a non- Markovian dynamics. Furthermore, the lack of\naccess to the precise information about the initial conditions or the past\nevents plays a very relevant role in the correct estimation or prediction of\nthe epidemic evolution. Such a \"constraint\" is analyzed and discussed. \n\n"}

They have opinions about certain\ntopics, which they share and spread on these networks, and are influenced by\nthe opinions of other persons. In this paper, we build upon this observation to\npropose a new nodal centrality measure for multiplex networks. Our measure,\ncalled Opinion centrality, is based on a stochastic model representing opinion\npropagation dynamics in such a network. We formulate an optimization problem\nconsisting in maximizing the opinion of the whole network when controlling an\nexternal influence able to affect each node individually. We find a\nmathematical closed form of this problem, and use its solution to derive our\ncentrality measure. According to the opinion centrality, the more a node is\nworth investing external influence, and the more it is central. We perform an\nempirical study of the proposed centrality over a toy network, as well as a\ncollection of real-world networks. Our measure is generally negatively\ncorrelated with existing multiplex centrality measures, and highlights\ndifferent types of nodes, accordingly to its definition. \n\n"}

Existing research shows that\nconvergence can be problematic when there are best reply cycles. Here we\ncalculate how typical this is by studying the space of all possible two-player\nnormal form games and counting the frequency of best reply cycles. The two key\nparameters are the number of moves, which defines how complicated the game is,\nand the anti-correlation of the payoffs, which determines how competitive it\nis.

Trait formation\nis intimately connected to cultural dynamics, which has been the focus of a\nvariety of quantitative models. Recently, some studies have emphasized the\nimportance of connecting those models to snapshots of cultural dynamics that\nare empirically accessible. By analyzing data obtained from different sources,\nit has been suggested that culture has properties that are universally present,\nand that empirical cultural states differ systematically from randomized\ncounterparts. Hence, a question about the mechanism responsible for the\nobserved patterns naturally arises. This study proposes a stochastic structural\nmodel for generating cultural states that retain those robust, empirical\nproperties. One ingredient of the model, already used in previous work, assumes\nthat every individual's set of traits is partly dictated by one of several,\nuniversal \"rationalities\", informally postulated by several social science\ntheories. The second, new ingredient taken from the same theories assumes that,\napart from a dominant rationality, each individual also has a certain exposure\nto the other rationalities.

Recent\ncomplexity measures such as integrated information have sought to\noperationalize this problem taking a whole-versus-parts perspective, wherein\none explicitly computes the amount of information generated by a network as a\nwhole over and above that generated by the sum of its parts during state\ntransitions. While several numerical schemes for estimating network integrated\ninformation exist, it is instructive to pursue an analytic approach that\ncomputes integrated information as a function of network weights. Our\nformulation of integrated information uses a Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween the multi-variate distribution on the set of network states versus the\ncorresponding factorized distribution over its parts. Implementing stochastic\nGaussian dynamics, we perform computations for several prototypical network\ntopologies. Our findings show increased informational complexity near\ncriticality, which remains consistent across network topologies. Spectral\ndecomposition of the system's dynamics reveals how informational complexity is\ngoverned by eigenmodes of both, the network's covariance and adjacency\nmatrices. We find that as the dynamics of the system approach criticality, high\nintegrated information is exclusively driven by the eigenmode corresponding to\nthe leading eigenvalue of the covariance matrix, while sub-leading modes get\nsuppressed. The implication of this result is that it might be favorable for\ncomplex dynamical networked systems such as the human brain or communication\nsystems to operate near criticality so that efficient information integration\nmight be achieved. \n\n"}

Quantifying the level of\nassortativity or disassortativity (the preference of linking to nodes with\ndifferent attributes) can shed light on the factors involved in the formation\nof links and contagion processes in complex networks. It is common practice to\nmeasure the level of assortativity according to the assortativity coefficient,\nor modularity in the case of discrete-valued metadata. This global value is the\naverage level of assortativity across the network and may not be a\nrepresentative statistic when mixing patterns are heterogeneous.

Given these inputs, agents follow strategies\nderived via multi-agent deep reinforcement learning and receive utility from\nacting in accordance with the veracity of claims.

The\nmodel captures essential properties of the structure and growth dynamics of\nsocial networks, acquaintance networks and scientific citation networks, where\nduplication mechanisms play a major role. Starting from an initial seed\nnetwork, at each time step a random node, referred to as a mother node, is\nselected for duplication. Its daughter node is added to the network, forming a\nlink to the mother node, and with probability $p$ to each one of its neighbors.\nThe degree distribution of the resulting network turns out to follow a\npower-law distribution, thus the ND network is a scale-free network.

That two such disparate discrete systems share important structural\nproperties suggests that yet other apparently unrelated discrete systems might\nshare the same properties, and certainly invites an explanation.\n  We demonstrate that this is inevitable for all discrete systems of components\nbuilt from tokens or symbols. Departing from existing work by embedding the\nConservation of Hartley-Shannon information (CoHSI) in a classical statistical\nmechanics framework, we identify two kinds of discrete system, heterogeneous\nand homogeneous. Heterogeneous systems contain components built from a unique\nalphabet of tokens and yield an implicit CoHSI distribution with a sharp\nunimodal peak asymptoting to a power-law. Homogeneous systems contain\ncomponents each built from just one kind of token unique to that component and\nyield a CoHSI distribution corresponding to Zipf's law.\n  This theory is applied to heterogeneous systems, (proteome, computer\nsoftware, music); homogeneous systems (language texts, abundance of the\nelements); and to systems in which both heterogeneous and homogeneous behaviour\nco-exist (word frequencies and word length frequencies in language texts).

Traditionally, the initial cultural traits of individuals are chosen\nuniformly at random, the emphasis being on characterizing the model outcomes\nthat are independent of these (`annealed') initial conditions. Here, motivated\nby an increasing interest in forecasting social behavior in the real world, we\nreverse the point of view and focus on the effect of specific (`quenched')\ninitial conditions, including those obtained from real data, on the final\ncultural state. We study the predictability, rigorously defined in an\ninformation-theoretic sense, of the \\emph{social content} of the final cultural\ngroups (i.e. who ends up in which group) from the knowledge of the initial\ncultural traits. We find that, as compared to random and shuffled initial\nconditions, the hierarchical ultrametric-like organization of empirical\ncultural states significantly increases the predictability of the final social\ncontent by largely confining cultural convergence within the lower levels of\nthe hierarchy.

Here, we address this issue by\nleveraging data sets containing high resolution face-to-face contacts as well\nas a coarser spatial localisation of individuals, both temporally resolved, in\nvarious contexts. The co-presence and the face-to-face contact temporal\nnetworks share a number of structural and statistical features, but the former\nis (by definition) much denser than the latter.

It is becoming increasingly clear that many mobile animal\ngroups are composed of heterogeneous individuals with differential levels and\ntypes of influence over group behaviors. The ability to infer this differential\ninfluence, or leadership, is critical to understanding group functioning in\nthese collective animal systems. Due to the broad interpretation of leadership,\nmany different measures and mathematical tools are used to describe and infer\n\"leadership\", e.g., position, causality, influence, information flow.

Recent studies\nhave revealed that, for a single-layer network, synergy can enhance spreading\nand even induce an explosive contagion. There is at the present a growing\ninterest in behavior spreading dynamics on multiplex networks. What is the role\nof synergistic interactions in behavior spreading in such networked systems? To\naddress this question, we articulate a synergistic behavior spreading model on\na double layer network, where the key manifestation of the synergistic\ninteractions is that the adoption of one behavior by a node in one layer\nenhances its probability of adopting the behavior in the other layer. A general\nresult is that synergistic interactions can greatly enhance the spreading of\nthe behaviors in both layers. A remarkable phenomenon is that the interactions\ncan alter the nature of the phase transition associated with behavior adoption\nor spreading dynamics. In particular, depending on the transmission rate of one\nbehavior in a network layer, synergistic interactions can lead to a\ndiscontinuous (first-order) or a continuous (second-order) transition in the\nadoption scope of the other behavior with respect to its transmission rate. A\nsurprising two-stage spreading process can arise: due to synergy, nodes having\nadopted one behavior in one layer adopt the other behavior in the other layer\nand then prompt the remaining nodes in this layer to quickly adopt the\nbehavior. Analytically, we develop an edge-based compartmental theory and\nperform a bifurcation analysis to fully understand, in the weak synergistic\ninteraction regime where the dynamical correlation between the network layers\nis negligible, the role of the interactions in promoting the social behavioral\nspreading dynamics in the whole system. \n\n"}

In this paper, we introduce a novel\nprobabilistic approach for the sign prediction problem. The main characteristic\nof the proposed models is their ability to adapt to the sparsity level of an\ninput network. The sparsity of networks is one of the major reasons for the\npoor performance of many link prediction algorithms, in general, and sign\nprediction algorithms, in particular. Building a model that has an ability to\nadapt to the sparsity of the data has not yet been considered in the previous\nrelated works. We suggest that there exists a dilemma between local and global\nstructures and attempt to build sparsity adaptive models by resolving this\ndilemma. To this end, we propose probabilistic prediction models based on local\nand global structures and integrate them based on the concept of smoothing. The\nmodel relies more on the global structures when the sparsity increases, whereas\nit gives more weights to the information obtained from local structures for low\nlevels of the sparsity. The proposed model is assessed on three real-world\nsigned networks, and the experiments reveal its consistent superiority over the\nstate of the art methods.

Here, we propose a network filtering methodology based on a family\nof null hypotheses that can be calibrated to assess which links are\nstatistically significant with respect to a given network's own heterogeneity.\nWe design such family of null hypotheses by adapting the P\\'olya urn, a simple\none-parameter combinatorial model driven by a self-reinforcement mechanism, to\na network setting. We provide a full analytical description of our filter, and\nshow that it retains or discards links based on a non-trivial interplay between\ntheir own local importance and the importance of the nodes they belong to. We\nprove that the widely used disparity filter can be recovered as a\nlarge-strength approximation for a specific value of the P\\'olya filter's\nparameter, and illustrate our findings by applying the filter to two large\nnetwork datasets. \n\n"}

Since\nits inception, this bound has been widely used and empirically validated using\nMarkov chains. We show that recurrent-neural architectures can achieve\nsignificantly higher predictability, surpassing this widely used upper bound.\nIn order to explain this anomaly, we shed light on several underlying\nassumptions in previous research works that has resulted in this bias. By\nevaluating the mobility predictability on real-world datasets, we show that\nhuman mobility exhibits scale-invariant long-range correlations, bearing\nsimilarity to a power-law decay. This is in contrast to the initial assumption\nthat human mobility follows an exponential decay. This assumption of\nexponential decay coupled with Lempel-Ziv compression in computing Fano's\ninequality has led to an inaccurate estimation of the predictability upper\nbound.

In this work, we study a tractable\nanalytical model of a user that interacts with an online news aggregator, with\nthe purpose of making explicit the feedback loop between the evolution of the\nuser's opinion and the personalised recommendation of contents. More\nspecifically, we assume that the user is endowed with a scalar opinion about a\ncertain issue and seeks news about it on a news aggregator: this opinion is\ninfluenced by all received news, which are characterized by a binary position\non the issue at hand. The user is affected by a confirmation bias, that is, a\npreference for news that confirm her current opinion. The news aggregator\nrecommends items with the goal of maximizing the number of user's clicks (as a\nmeasure of her engagement): in order to fulfil its goal, the recommender has to\ncompromise between exploring the user's preferences and exploiting what it has\nlearned so far.

An important area of research is to study how well real networks\ncan be described with a small selection of metrics, furthermore how well\nnetwork models can capture the relations between graph metrics observed in real\nnetworks. In this paper, we apply machine learning techniques to investigate\nthe aforementioned problems. We study 500 real-world networks along with 2,000\nsynthetic networks generated by four frequently used network models with\npreviously calibrated parameters to make the generated graphs as similar to the\nreal networks as possible. This paper unifies several branches of data-driven\ncomplex network analysis, such as the study of graph metrics and their\npair-wise relationships, network similarity estimation, model calibration, and\ngraph classification. We find that the correlation profiles of the structural\nmeasures significantly differ across network domains and the domain can be\nefficiently determined using a small selection of graph metrics. The structural\nproperties of the network models with fixed parameters are robust enough to\nperform parameter calibration.

However, not every state policy reaches the national level.\nPrevious work has suggested that state-level policies are more likely to become\nnational policies depending on their geographic origin, their category of\nlegislation, or some characteristic of their initiating states, such as wealth,\nurbanicity, or ideological liberalism. Here, we tested these hypotheses by\ndivorcing the set of traits from the states' identities and building predictive\nforecasting models of state policies becoming national policies. Using a large,\nlongitudinal data set of state level policies and their traits, we train models\nto predict (i) whether policies become national policy, and (ii) how many\nstates must pass a given policy before it becomes national. Using these models\nas components, we then develop a logistic growth model to forecast when a\ncurrently spreading state-level policy is likely to pass at the national level.\nOur results indicate that traits of initiating states are not systematically\ncorrelated with becoming national policy and they predict neither how many\nstates must enact a policy before it becomes national nor whether it ultimately\nbecomes a national law. In contrast, the cumulative number of state-level\nadoptions of a policy is reasonably predictive of when a policy becomes\nnational.

An additional challenge is learning an interpretable model that not\nonly accurately predicts outcomes, but also identifies important factors\nassociated with a given behavior. To address these challenges, we describe a\nstatistical approach to modeling behavioral data called the structured\nsum-of-squares decomposition (S3D). The algorithm, which is inspired by\ndecision trees, selects important features that collectively explain the\nvariation of the outcome, quantifies correlations between the features, and\npartitions the subspace of important features into smaller, more homogeneous\nblocks that correspond to similarly-behaving subgroups within the population.\nThis partitioned subspace allows us to predict and analyze the behavior of the\noutcome variable both statistically and visually, giving a medium to examine\nthe effect of various features and to create explainable predictions.

We begin by analyzing the behavior of bots in\nsocial networks and identify that they exhibit heterophily, meaning they\ninteract with humans more than other bots. We use this property to develop a\ndetection algorithm based on the Ising model from statistical physics. The bots\nare identified by solving a minimum cut problem.

Here we\nintroduce a spectral approach for detecting a network's low-dimensional\nstructure, and the nodes that participate in it, using any null model. We use\ngenerative models to estimate the expected eigenvalue distribution under a\nspecified null model, and then detect where the data network's eigenspectra\nexceed the estimated bounds. On synthetic networks, this spectral estimation\napproach cleanly detects transitions between random and community structure,\nrecovers the number and membership of communities, and removes noise nodes. On\nreal networks spectral estimation finds either a significant fraction of noise\nnodes or no departure from a null model, in stark contrast to traditional\ncommunity detection methods. Across all analyses, we find the choice of null\nmodel can strongly alter conclusions about the presence of network structure.\nOur spectral estimation approach is therefore a promising basis for detecting\nlow-dimensional structure in real-world networks, or lack thereof. \n\n"}

The scarcity of balanced networks\nencouraged us to define the notion of partial balance in order to quantify the\nextent to which a network is balanced. We evaluate several numerical measures\nof partial balance and recommend using the frustration index, a measure that\nsatisfies key axiomatic properties and allows us to analyse graphs based on\ntheir levels of partial balance. The exact algorithms used in the literature to\ncompute the frustration index, also called the line index of balance, are not\nscalable and cannot process graphs with a few hundred edges. We formulate\ncomputing the frustration index as a graph optimisation problem to find the\nminimum number of edges whose removal results in a balanced network given\nbinary decision variables associated with graph nodes and edges. We use our\nfirst optimisation model to analyse graphs with up to 3000 edges. Reformulating\nthe optimisation problem, we develop three more efficient binary linear\nprogramming models. Equipping the models with valid inequalities and\nprioritised branching as speed-up techniques allows us to process graphs with\n15000 edges on inexpensive hardware. Besides making exact computations possible\nfor large graphs, we show that our models outperform heuristics and\napproximation algorithms suggested in the literature by orders of magnitude. We\nextend the concepts of balance and frustration in signed networks to\napplications beyond the classic friend-enemy interpretation of balance theory\nin social context. Using a high-performance computer, we analyse graphs with up\nto 100000 edges to investigate a range of applications from biology and\nchemistry to finance, international relations, and physics. \n\n"}

The algorithm assigns a limited but\ndiverse number of monitored households (the \"buddies\") to the unmonitored\ncustomers on a network. We study and compare two algorithms, one where\nsubstation monitoring data is available and a second where no substation\ninformation is used. Despite the roll out of monitoring equipment at domestic\nproperties and/or substations, less data is available for commercial customers.\nThis study focuses on substations with commercial customers most of which have\nno monitored `buddy', in which case a profile must be created. Due to the\nvolatile nature of the low voltage networks, uncertainty bounds are crucial for\noperational purposes. We introduce and demonstrate two techniques for modelling\nthe confidence bounds on the modelled LV networks.

Here, we\nintroduce a reference model to tackle this current lack of general framework.\nWe consider mobile agents which align their direction of motion (based on the\nKuramoto dynamics) and carry an internal state governed by the\nSusceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic process, characterizing the\nspread of information in the population, and affecting the way agents move in\nspace. We show that the feedback between the agents motion and information\nspreading is responsible for (i) the enhancement of both flocking and\ninformation spreading, (ii) the emergence of complex spatial structures, or\nswarms, which can be controlled by the velocity of the agents. The SIS dynamics\nis able to drive a flocking phase transition even in the absence of explicit\nvelocity-alignment, recovering a behavior reminiscent of Vicsek-like systems\nbut featuring macro-phase separation rather than micro-phase separation.

Also, each link\n$r(i,j)$ is initially represented by a random positive value, which means the\npercentage of resources of node $i$ which is offered to node $j$. Initially\nthen, the graph is fully connected, i.e. all non-diagonal matrix elements\n$r(i,j)$ are different from zero. During the simulation, the amounts of\nresources $p(i)$ change according to the balance equation. Also, nodes\nreorganise their activity with time, going to give more resources to those\nwhich give them more. This is the rule of varying the coefficients $r(i,j)$.\nThe result is that after some transient time, only some pairs $(m,n)$ of nodes\nsurvive with non-zero $p(m)$ and $p(n)$, each pair with symmetric and positive\n$r(m,n)=r(n,m)$. Other coefficients $r(m,i\\ne n)$ vanish. Unpaired nodes remain\nwith no resources, i.e. their $p(i)=0$, and they cease to be active, as they\nhave nothing to offer. The percentage of survivors (i.e. those with with $p(i)$\npositive) increases with the velocity of varying the numbers $r(i,j)$, and it\nslightly decreases with the size of the group.

Abstract: A large consensus now seems to take for granted that the distributions of\nempirical returns of financial time series are regularly varying, with a tail\nexponent close to 3. We revisit this results and use standard tests as well as\ndevelop a battery of new non-parametric and parametric tests (in particular\nwith stretched exponential (SE) distributions) to characterize the\ndistributions of empirical returns of financial time series, with application\nto the 100 years of daily return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and over 1\nyears of 5-minutes returns of the Nasdaq Composite index. Based on the\ndiscovery that the SE distribution tends to the Pareto distribution in a\ncertain limit such that the Pareto (or power law) distribution can be\napproximated with any desired accuracy on an arbitrary interval by a suitable\nadjustment of the parameters of the SE distribution, we demonstrate that Wilks'\ntest of nested hypothesis still works for the non-exactly nested comparison\nbetween the SE and Pareto distributions. The SE distribution is found\nsignificantly better over the whole quantile range but becomes unnecessary\nbeyond the 95% quantiles compared with the Pareto law. Similar conclusions hold\nfor the log-Weibull model with respect to the Pareto distribution. Our main\nresult is that the tails ultimately decay slower than any stretched exponential\ndistribution but probably faster than power laws with reasonable exponents.\nImplications of our results on the ``moment condition failure'' and for risk\nestimation and management are presented. \n\n"}

For\nmesoscopic times the bulk of the distribution (more than 99% of the\nprobability) follows an exponential law. At longer times, the exponential law\ncontinuously evolves into Gaussian distribution.\n  After characterizing the stock returns at mesoscopic time lags, we study the\nsubordination hypothesis. The integrated volatility V_t constructed from the\nnumber of trades process can be used as a subordinator for a Brownian motion.\nThis subordination is able to describe approximatly 85% of the stock returns\nfor time lags that start at 1 hour but are shorter than one day.

In this work we study\nthe network of investment stocks in Europe at two different levels: first, we\ncompute the inward-outward investment stocks at the level of firms, based on\nownership shares and number of employees; then we estimate the inward-outward\ninvestment stock at the level of regions in Europe, by aggregating the\nownership network of firms, based on their headquarter location. Despite the\nintuitive value of this approach for EU policy making in economic development,\nto our knowledge there are no similar works in the literature yet.

Each subset of knowledge is represented as a\nnode, and relations between such knowledge are expressed as edges. Two types of\nedges are considered, corresponding to free and conditional transitions. The\nlatter case implies that a node can only be reached after visiting previously a\nset of nodes (the required conditions). The process of knowledge acquisition\ncan then be simulated by considering the number of nodes visited as a single\nagent moves along the network, starting from its lowest layer. It is shown that\nhierarchical networks, i.e. networks composed of successive interconnected\nlayers, arise naturally as a consequence of compositions of the prerequisite\nrelationships between the nodes. In order to avoid deadlocks, i.e. unreachable\nnodes, the subnetwork in each layer is assumed to be a connected component.\nSeveral configurations of such hierarchical knowledge networks are simulated\nand the performance of the moving agent quantified in terms of the percentage\nof visited nodes after each movement. The Barab\\'asi-Albert and random models\nare considered for the layer and interconnecting subnetworks.

We suppose that the object of\ninterest of agents, called here baskets, form a vector space over the reals. A\nportfolio is defined as an equivalence class of baskets containing assets in\nthe same proportions. Therefore portfolios form a projective space. Cross\nratios, being invariants of projective maps, form key structures in the\nproposed model. Quotation with respect to an asset X (i.e. in units of X) are\ngiven by linear maps. Among various types of metrics that have financial\ninterpretation, the min-max metrics on the space of quotations can be\nintroduced.

Moreover it\ncreates an incompressible minority around the inflexibles, one of the pure\nattractors becoming a mixed phase attractor. In addition above a threshold of\n17% inflexibles make their side sure of winning whatever the initial conditions\nare. The inflexible minority wins. An equal presence of inflexibles on both\nsides restores the balanced dynamics with again a separator at 50% and now two\nmixed phase attractors on each side. Nevertheless, beyond 25% the dynamics is\nreversed with a unique attractor at a fifty-fifty stable equilibrium. But a\nvery small advantage in inflexibles results in a decisive lowering of the\nseparator at the advantage of the corresponding opinion. A few percent\nadvantage does guarantee to become majority with one single attractor. The\nmodel is solved exhaustedly for groups of size 3. \n\n"}

We note that most\nsuch systems are subject to multiple structural and functional constraints,\ne.g., minimizing the average path length and the total number of links, while\nmaximizing robustness against perturbations in node activity. We show that the\noptimal networks satisfying these three constraints are characterized by the\nexistence of multiple subnetworks (modules) sparsely connected to each other.\nIn addition, these modules have distinct hubs, resulting in an overall\nheterogeneous degree distribution. \n\n"}

Within this model\nagents suffering under dissatisfaction compare them with their neighbors. The\ninternal bias are the pre-formed preferences, and the states are represented by\nthe visual contacts that an agent makes to the baskets of her/his neighbors.\nThe topology of the comparisons is a random network. We compare the behavior\nbetween altruistic and non-altruistic agents and we find out that altruistic\nbehavior alters the robustness of the network. \n\n"}
{"id": "q-bio/0703019", "contents": "Title: Robustness of Cooperation in the Evolutionary Prisoner's Dilemma on\n  Complex Networks Abstract: Recent studies on the evolutionary dynamics of the Prisoner's Dilemma game in\nscale-free networks have demonstrated that the heterogeneity of the network\ninterconnections enhances the evolutionary success of cooperation. In this\npaper we address the issue of how the characterization of the asymptotic states\nof the evolutionary dynamics depends on the initial concentration of\ncooperators. We find that the measure and the connectedness properties of the\nset of nodes where cooperation reaches fixation is largely independent of\ninitial conditions, in contrast with the behavior of both the set of nodes\nwhere defection is fixed, and the fluctuating nodes. We also check for the\nrobustness of these results when varying the degree heterogeneity along a\none-parametric family of networks interpolating between the class of\nErdos-Renyi graphs and the Barabasi-Albert networks. \n\n"}
