All the masers appear blueshifted with respect to\nthe systemic velocity of the nebula and they have different spatial and\nkinematic distributions.The OH 1665 and 1720 MHz masers appear spatially\ncoincident with the core of the nebula, while the OH 1612 and 1667 MHz ones\nexhibit a more extended distribution.

It is worth noting that the location and velocity of the OH 1720 MHz\nmaser emission are very similar to those of the H2O masers (coinciding within\n0.1\" and ~2 km/s, respectively).

The flux\nratio H-alpha/FUV from these two star formation tracers shows strong\ncorrelations with the surface-brightness in H-alpha and the R band: Low Surface\nBrightness (LSB) galaxies have lower ratios compared to High Surface Brightness\ngalaxies and to expectations from equilibrium star formation models using\ncommonly favored IMF parameters.

The correlated variations of\nH-alpha/FUV with other global parameters are thus part of the larger family of\ngalaxy scaling relations. The H-alpha/FUV correlations can not be due to dust\ncorrection errors, while systematic variations in the star formation history\ncan not explain the trends with both H-alpha and R surface brightness. LSB\ngalaxies are unlikely to have a higher escape fraction of ionizing photons\nconsidering their high gas fraction, and color-magnitude diagrams. The most\nplausible explanation for the correlations are systematic variations of the\nupper mass limit and/or slope of the IMF at the upper end.

The surrounding stars must share a common turnoff mass with the\ntransient, since almost all stars form in stellar clusters that remain\nphysically associated for periods longer than the lifetime of the most massive\nstars. We find that the precursor of NGC 300 OT2008-1 is surrounded by stars\nthat formed in a single burst between 8-13 Myr ago, with 70% confidence. The\ntransient was therefore likely to be due to a progenitor whose mass falls\nbetween the main sequence turnoff mass (12 Msun) and the maximum stellar mass\n(25 Msun) found for isochrones bounding this age range. We characterize the\ngeneral applicability of this technique in identifying precursor masses of\nhistoric and future transients and supernovae (SNe), noting that it requires\nneither precursor imaging nor sub-arcsecond accuracy in the position of the\ntransient. It is also based on the well-understood physics of the main\nsequence, and thus may be a more reliable source of precursor masses than\nfitting evolutionary tracks to precursor magnitudes.

We disentangled the binary spectra using\nKOREL, and performed the first abundance analysis on both disentangled spectra.\nBy combining the spectroscopic results and the photometric data, we obtained\nthe component masses, 1.8 and 1.7 solar masses, and radii, 4.0 and 2.4 solar\nradii, for inclination i = 73.2 degrees, eccentricity e = 0.28, and orbital\nperiod 5.70198 days.

In particular, the secondary companion to the progenitor of a\nType Ib/c SN is frequently (~50%) the more optically luminous star since the\nhigh effective temperatures of the stripped progenitors make it relatively easy\nfor a lower luminosity, cooler secondary to emit more optical light.\nSecondaries to the lower mass progenitors of Type II SN will frequently produce\nexcess blue emission relative to the spectral energy distribution of the red\nprimary.

Internal two-body relaxation and external shocks will lead to\nfurther, gradual dissolution on timescales of up to a few hundred million years\nfor low-mass open clusters in the Milky Way, while the most massive clusters (>\n10^5 Msun) have lifetimes comparable to or exceeding the age of the Universe.\nThe low-mass end of the initial cluster mass function is well approximated by a\npower-law distribution, dN/dM ~ M^{-2}, but there is mounting evidence that\nquiescent spiral discs form relatively few clusters with masses M > 2 x 10^5\nMsun.

We study a toy model where the flow behind a planar\nstationary accretion shock is adiabatically decelerated by an external\npotential. Two magnetic field geometries are considered: parallel or\nperpendicular to the shock. The entropy-vorticity wave, which is simply\nadvected in the unmagnetized limit, separates into five different waves: the\nentropy perturbations are advected, while the vorticity can propagate along the\nfield lines through two Alfven waves and two slow magnetosonic waves. The two\ncycles existing in the unmagnetized limit, advective-acoustic and purely\nacoustic, are replaced by up to six distinct MHD cycles. The phase differences\namong the cycles play an important role in determining the total cycle\nefficiency and hence the growth rate. Oscillations in the growth rate as a\nfunction of the magnetic field strength are due to this varying phase shift. A\nvertical magnetic field hardly affects the cycle efficiency in the regime of\nsuper-Alfvenic accretion that is considered. In contrast, we find that a\nhorizontal magnetic field strongly increases the efficiencies of the vorticity\ncycles that bend the field lines, resulting in a significant increase of the\ngrowth rate if the different cycles are in phase. These magnetic effects are\nsignificant for large-scale modes if the Alfven velocity is a sizable fraction\nof the flow velocity. \n\n"}

To this end, we\nanalysed high-resolution spectra of 18 sample stars for the presence of\nabsorption lines of Tc and Li. The abundance of the latter was determined by\ncomparing the observed spectra to hydrostatic MARCS model spectra. Bolometric\nmagnitudes were established from near-IR photometry and pulsation periods. We\nreclassify the star V441 Cyg as Tc-rich, and the unusual Mira star R Hya, as\nwell as W Eri, as Tc-poor. The abundance of Li, or an upper limit to it, was\ndetermined for all of the sample stars. In all stars with Tc we also detected\nLi. Most of them have a Li content slightly below the solar photospheric value,\nexcept for V441 Cyg, which has ~1000 times the solar abundance.

Analysis of the radii of curvature of electron trajectories in the\ninertial observer's frame (IOF) enables these two effects to be considered\ntogether. We demonstrate that for dipolar magnetic field lines on the TS there\nexists a `caustic phase' beyond which no emission can be observed.

The maximum gradient of polarisation angle\n(PA) in the S-shaped PA curve is also associated with the curvature minimum and\noccurs at exactly the same phase.

The facts that the system is magnetically active and that the\nhot spot has consistently existed on the inner hemisphere of the star indicate\nthat the two spots are formed by (1) magnetic dynamo-related activity on the\ncool star and (2) mass transfer from the primary to the secondary component.\nBased on 38 light-curve timings from the Wilson-Devinney code and all other\nminimum epochs, a period study of GW Cep reveals that the orbital period has\nexperienced a sinusoidal variation with a period and semi-amplitude of 32.6 yrs\nand 0.009 d, respectively.

We also detect a hot (400-550 K) component in the tail\nthat is approximately 1% of the mass. The large H_2 line to IR continuum\nluminosity ratio in the tail indicates that star formation is not a major\nexcitation source and that the gas is possibly shock-heated. This discovery\nconfirms that the galaxy is currently undergoing ram-pressure stripping, as\nalso indicated by its X-ray and Halpha tails found previously. We estimate the\ngalaxy is losing its warm H_2 gas at a rate of ~ 2-3 solar masses per year. The\ntrue mass loss rate is likely higher if we account for cold molecular gas and\natomic gas.

We have\nevolved models of 1, 1.5 and 2 solar masses from the pre-main sequence to the\nend of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch with thermohaline mixing\napplied throughout the simulations. In agreement with other authors, we find\nthat thermohaline mixing substantially reduces the abundance of helium-3 on the\nupper part of the red giant branch in our lowest mass model. However, the small\namount of helium-3 that remains is enough to drive thermohaline mixing on the\nAGB. We find that thermohaline mixing is most efficient in the early thermal\npulses and its efficiency drops from pulse to pulse. Nitrogen is not\nsubstantially affected by the process, but we do see substantial changes in\ncarbon-13. The carbon-12 to carbon-13 ratio is substantially lowered during the\nearly thermal pulses but the efficacy of the process is seen to diminish\nrapidly. As the process stops after a few pulses, the carbon-12 to carbon-13\nratio is still able to reach values of 10^3-10^4, which is inconsistent with\nthe values measured in carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars.

We show that those results suffered\nfrom effects caused by stellar blending and imaging artifacts and that it is\nlikely that no stars below about 1 mag from the tip of the RGB are producing\ndust. The only stars that appear to harbor dust are variable stars, which are\nalso the coolest and most luminous stars in the cluster. \n\n"}

The Vela Molecular Ridge hosts a number of young embedded star\nclusters in the same evolutionary stage. Aims. The main aim of the present work\nis testing whether the fraction of members with a circumstellar disk in a\nsample of clusters in the cloud D of the Vela Molecular Ridge, is consistent\nwith relations derived for larger samples of star clusters with an age spread.\nBesides, we want to constrain the age of the young embedded star clusters\nassociated with cloud D. Methods. We carried out L (3.78 microns) photometry on\nimages of six young embedded star clusters associated with cloud D of the Vela\nMolecular Ridge, taken with ISAAC at the VLT. These data are complemented with\nthe available HKs photometry. The 6 clusters are roughly of the same size and\nappear to be in the same evolutionary stage. The fraction of stars with a\ncircumstellar disk was measured in each cluster by counting the fraction of\nsources displaying a NIR excess in colour-colour (HKsL) diagrams. Results. The\nL photometry allowed us to identify the NIR counterparts of the IRAS sources\nassociated with the clusters. The fraction of stars with a circumstellar disk\nappears to be constant within errors for the 6 clusters. There is a hint that\nthis is lower for the most massive stars. The age of the clusters is\nconstrained to ~1-2 Myr. Conclusions. The fraction of stars with a\ncircumstellar disk in the observed sample is consistent with the relations\nderived from larger samples of star clusters and with other age estimates for\ncloud D. The fraction may be lower for the most massive stars. Our results\nagree with a scenario where all intermediate and low-mass stars form with a\ndisk, whose lifetime is shorter for higher mass stars. \n\n"}

I.\n  Outbursts Abstract: As an initial investigation into the long-term evolution of protostellar\ndisks, we explore the conditions required to explain the large outbursts of\ndisk accretion seen in some young stellar objects. We use one-dimensional\ntime-dependent disk models with a phenomenological treatment of the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) and gravitational torques to follow disk\nevolution over long timescales. Comparison with our previous two-dimensional\ndisk model calculations (Zhu et al. 2009b, Z2009b) indicates that the neglect\nof radial effects and two-dimensional disk structure in the one-dimensional\ncase makes only modest differences in the results; this allows us to use the\nsimpler models to explore parameter space efficiently. We find that the mass\ninfall rates typically estimated for low-mass protostars generally result in\nAU-scale disk accretion outbursts, as predicted by our previous analysis (Zhu\net al. 2009a,Z2009a). We also confirm quasi-steady accretion behavior for high\nmass infall rates if the values of $\\alpha$-parameter for the magnetorotational\ninstability is small, while at this high accretion rate convection from the\nthermal instability may lead to some variations. We further constrain the\ncombinations of the $\\alpha$-parameter and the MRI critical temperature, which\ncan reproduce observed outburst behavior. Our results suggest that dust\nsublimation may be connected with full activation of the MRI. This is\nconsistent with the idea that small dust captures ions and electrons to\nsuppress the MRI. In a later paper we will explore both long-term outburst and\ndisk evolution with this model, allowing for infall from protostellar envelopes\nwith differing angular momenta. \n\n"}

Precise estimates of the\natmospheric parameters (Teff, [M/H], log g) and of the vsini of HD 49385 are\nobtained.

The Symbiotic Channel Abstract: In order for a white dwarf (WD) to achieve the Chandrasekhar mass, M_C, and\nexplode as a Type Ia supernova (SNIa), it must interact with another star,\neither accreting matter from or merging with it. The failure to identify the\ntypes of binaries which produce SNeIa is the \"progenitor problem\". Its solution\nis required if we are to utilize the full potential of SNeIa to elucidate basic\ncosmological and physical principles. In single-degenerate models, a WD\naccretes and burns matter at high rates. Nuclear-burning WDs (NBWDs) with mass\nclose to M_C are hot and luminous, potentially detectable as supersoft x-ray\nsources (SSSs). In previous work we showed that > 90-99% of the required number\nof progenitors do not appear as SSSs during most of the crucial phase of mass\nincrease. The obvious implication is that double-degenerate (DD) binaries form\nthe main class of progenitors. We show in this paper, however, that many\nbinaries that later become DDs must pass through a long-lived NBWD phase during\nwhich they are potentially detectable as SSSs. The paucity of SSSs is therefore\nnot a strong argument in favor of DD models. Those NBWDs that are the\nprogenitors of DD binaries are likely to appear as symbiotic binaries for\nintervals > 10^6 years. In fact, symbiotic pre-DDs should be common, whether or\nnot the WDs eventually produce SNeIa. The key to solving the progenitor problem\nlies in understanding the appearance of NBWDs. Most do not appear as SSSs most\nof the time. We therefore consider the evolution of NBWDs to address the\nquestion of what their appearance may be and how we can hope to detect them. \n\n"}

In this\npaper we investigate how the properties of such shells influence the SN\nlightcurve by conducting numerical simulations of the interaction between an\nexpanding SN and a circumstellar shell ejected a few years prior to core\ncollapse. Our parameter study explores how the emergent luminosity depends on a\nrange of circumstellar shell masses, velocities, geometries, and wind mass-loss\nrates, as well as variations in the SN mass and energy. We find that the shell\nmass is the most important parameter, in the sense that higher shell masses (or\nhigher ratios of M_shell/M_SN) lead to higher peak luminosities and higher\nefficiencies in converting shock energy into visual light. Lower mass shells\ncan also cause high peak luminosities if the shell is slow or if the SN ejecta\nare very fast, but only for a short time. Sustaining a high luminosity for\ndurations of more than 100 days requires massive circumstellar shells of order\n10 M_sun or more.

{"id": "1005.3271", "contents": "Title: Limiting Accretion onto Massive Stars by Fragmentation-Induced\n  Starvation Abstract: Massive stars influence their surroundings through radiation, winds, and\nsupernova explosions far out of proportion to their small numbers. However, the\nphysical processes that initiate and govern the birth of massive stars remain\npoorly understood. Two widely discussed models are monolithic collapse of\nmolecular cloud cores and competitive accretion. To learn more about massive\nstar formation, we perform simulations of the collapse of rotating, massive,\ncloud cores including radiative heating by both non-ionizing and ionizing\nradiation using the FLASH adaptive mesh refinement code. These simulations show\nfragmentation from gravitational instability in the enormously dense accretion\nflows required to build up massive stars. Secondary stars form rapidly in these\nflows and accrete mass that would have otherwise been consumed by the massive\nstar in the center, in a process that we term fragmentation-induced starvation.\nThis explains why massive stars are usually found as members of high-order\nstellar systems that themselves belong to large clusters containing stars of\nall masses. The radiative heating does not prevent fragmentation, but does lead\nto a higher Jeans mass, resulting in fewer and more massive stars than would\nform without the heating. This mechanism reproduces the observed relation\nbetween the total stellar mass in the cluster and the mass of the largest star.\nIt predicts strong clumping and filamentary structure in the center of\ncollapsing cores, as has recently been observed. We speculate that a similar\nmechanism will act during primordial star formation. \n\n"}

Rotational properties of subdwarf\n  B stars in close binary systems and nature of their unseen companions Abstract: The origin of hot subdwarf B stars (sdBs) is still unclear. About half of the\nknown sdBs are in close binary systems for which common envelope ejection is\nthe most likely formation channel. Little is known about this dynamic phase of\nbinary evolution. Due to the tidal influence of the companion in close binary\nsystems, the rotation of the primary becomes synchronised to its orbital\nmotion. In this case it is possible to constrain the mass of the companion, if\nthe primary mass, its projected rotational velocity as well as its surface\ngravity are known. For the first time we measured the projected rotational\nvelocities of a large sdB binary sample from high resolution spectra. We\nanalysed a sample of 51 sdB stars in close binaries, 40 of which have known\norbital parameters comprising half of all such systems known today.\nSynchronisation in sdB binaries is discussed both from the theoretical and the\nobservational point of view. The masses and the nature of the unseen companions\ncould be constrained in 31 cases. The companions to seven sdBs could be clearly\nidentified as late M stars. One binary may have a brown dwarf companion. The\nunseen companions of nine sdBs are white dwarfs with typical masses. The mass\nof one white dwarf companion is very low. In eight cases the companion mass\nexceeds 0.9 solar masses, four of which even exceed the Chandrasekhar limit\nindicating that they may be neutron stars. Even stellar mass black holes are\npossible for the most massive companions. The distribution of the inclinations\nof the systems with low mass companions appears to be consistent with\nexpectations, whereas a lack of high inclinations becomes obvious for the\nmassive systems. We show that the formation of such systems can be explained\nwith common envelope evolution and present an appropriate formation channel\nincluding two phases of unstable mass transfer and one supernova explosion. \n\n"}

In this paper, we apply the\ngrowth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (\"frozen\" zone)\nwhere the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage. For\nlow-turbulence disks, we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of\nthe disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star. The maximum mass of the\naggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer\nmasses at 100 AU. Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the\nfrozen zone, but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic\naggregates at later stages.

The jet breakout is possible even if the Pop\nIII star has a supergiant hydrogen envelope without mass loss, thanks to the\nlong-lived powerful accretion of the envelope itself. While the Pop III GRB is\nestimated to be energetic, E_{gamma,iso} ~ 10^{55} erg, the supergiant envelope\nhides the initial bright phase into the cocoon component, leading to a GRB with\na long duration ~ 1000(1+z) sec and an ordinary isotropic luminosity ~ 10^{52}\nerg s^{-1} (~ 10^{-9} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} at redshift z ~ 20).

In addition, we show that the state of matter\nand the geometrical shape of the celestial object could significantly affect\nthe precessional value. For example, a Cataclysmic Variable (CV) Dwarf Novae\n(DN) non-magnetic system that shows negative superhumps in its light curve can\nbe described by a retrogradely precessing, differentially rotating, tilted\ndisc. Because the disc is a fluid and because the gas stream overflows the\ntilted disc and particles can migrate into inner disc annuli, coupled to the\ndisc could be a retrogradely precessing inner ring that is located near the\ninnermost annuli of the disc. However, numerical simulations by Bisikalo et al.\n(2003, 2004) and this work show that an inner spiral density wave can be\ngenerated instead of an inner ring.

The disentangled spectra of a binary star system are\nvery well suited to spectroscopic analysis but for one problem: the absolute\nspectral line depths are unknown because this information is not contained in\nthe original spectra (unless there is one taken in eclipse) without making\nassumptions about the spectral characteristics of the component stars. Here we\npresent a method for obtaining the atmospheric parameters of the component\nstars by the constrained fitting of synthetic spectra to observed and\ndisentangled spectra. Disentangled spectra are fitted using synthetic spectra\nand a genetic algorithm in order to determine the effective temperatures,\nsurface gravities and relative light contributions of the two stars in a binary\nsystem. The method is demonstrated on synthetic spectra and then applied to the\neclipsing binary V615 Per, a member of the young open cluster NGC 869 (h\nPersei). The method works well for disentangled spectra with signal-to-noise\nratios of 100 or more. For V615 Per we find a normal He abundance but an Mg\nabundance, which indicates bulk metallicity, a factor of two lower than typical\nfor nearby OB stars. \n\n"}

Using a simple analytic model related to\nthe so-called maximally compact equation of state, model-independent upper\nlimits to thermodynamic properties in neutron stars, such as energy density,\npressure, baryon number density and chemical potential, are established which\ndepend upon the neutron star maximum mass.

The wavelength dependence\nof polarization indicates the dominance of Rayleigh scattering with a peak in\nthe blue B and U bands of ~10^-4+/-10^-5 and at least a factor of two lower\nsignal in the V band. The Rayleigh-like wavelength dependence, detected also in\nthe transmitted light during transits, implies a rapid decrease of the\npolarization signal toward longer wavelengths. Therefore, the nondetection by\nWiktorowicz (2009), based on a measurement integrated within a broad passband\ncovering the V band and partly B and R bands, is inconclusive and consistent\nwith our detection in B.

Recent studies\nhave shown that magnetic braking is strong enough to suppress the formation of\nrotationally supported disks in the ideal MHD limit. Whether non-ideal MHD\neffects can enable disk formation remains unsettled. We carry out a first study\non how disk formation in magnetic clouds is modified by the Hall effect, the\nleast explored of the three non-ideal MHD effects in star formation (the other\ntwo being ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation). For illustrative\npurposes, we consider a simplified problem of a non-self-gravitating,\nmagnetized envelope collapsing onto a central protostar of fixed mass. We find\nthat the Hall effect can spin up the inner part of the collapsing flow to\nKeplerian speed, producing a rotationally supported disk. The disk is generated\nthrough a Hall-induced magnetic torque. Disk formation occurs even when the\nenvelope is initially non-rotating, provided that the Hall coefficient is large\nenough. When the magnetic field orientation is flipped, the direction of disk\nrotation is reversed as well. The implication is that the Hall effect can in\nprinciple produce both regularly rotating and counter-rotating disks around\nprotostars.

In this paper, the first in a series, we present and test a novel\nnumerical implementation of stellar feedback resulting from momentum imparted\nto the ISM by radiation, supernovae, and stellar winds. We employ a realistic\ncooling function, and find that a large fraction of the gas cools to <100K, so\nthat the ISM becomes highly inhomogeneous. Despite this, our simulated galaxies\nreach an approximate steady state, in which gas gravitationally collapses to\nform giant molecular clouds (GMCs), dense clumps, and stars; subsequently,\nstellar feedback disperses the GMCs, repopulating the diffuse ISM. This\ncollapse and dispersal cycle is seen in models of SMC-like dwarfs, the\nMilky-Way, and z~2 clumpy disk analogues. The simulated global star formation\nefficiencies are consistent with the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.\nMoreover, the star formation rates are nearly independent of the numerically\nimposed high-density star formation efficiency, density threshold, and density\nscaling. This is a consequence of the fact that, in our simulations, star\nformation is regulated by stellar feedback limiting the amount of very dense\ngas available for forming stars. In contrast, in simulations without stellar\nfeedback, i.e. under the action of only gravity and gravitationally-induced\nturbulence, the ISM experiences runaway collapse to very high densities. In\nthese simulations without feedback, the global star formation rates exceed\nobserved galactic star formation rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude,\ndemonstrating that stellar feedback is crucial to the regulation of star\nformation in galaxies. \n\n"}

Due to the low gas density in SNe Ia with no H-envelope, the\naverage radii of the newly formed grains are generally below 0.01 micron, being\nmuch smaller than those in Type II-P SNe. This supports our previous conclusion\nthat the radius of dust formed in the ejecta is smaller in SNe with less\nmassive envelopes. The total dust mass ranges from 3x10^{-4} M_sun to 0.2 M_sun\nfor alpha_j=0.1--1, depending on whether or not CO and SiO molecules are\nformed.

This\nquestion is particularly relevant to assess the planet-making potential of\nthese lower mass discs. Given the uncertainties inherent to age-dating young\nstars, we propose an alternative approach that is to analyse the spatial\ndistribution of disc-bearing low-mass stars and compare it to that of\ndisc-bearing solar-type stars in the same cluster. A significant age difference\nbetween the two populations should be reflected in their average nearest\nneighbour distance (normalised to the number of sources), where the older\npopulation should appear more spread out.\n  To this aim, we perform a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis on the spatial\ndistribution of disc-bearing young stellar objects (YSOs) in six nearby low\nmass star forming regions.

In order to do so we improve an analytic description of relativistic\nradiation mediated shocks and follow the system from the breakout itself,\nthrough the planar phase and into the spherical phase. We limit our calculation\nto cases where the post breakout acceleration of the gas ends during the planar\nphase. (i.e., the final gas Lorentz factor <~30). We find that spherical\nrelativistic breakouts produce a flash of gamma-rays with energy, temperature,\nand duration that always satisfy a specific relation between them as well as\nproviding the breakout radius and Lorentz factor. The breakout flare is\ntypically followed, on longer time scales, by X-rays that carry a comparable\nenergy. We apply our model to a variety of explosions, including Ia and .Ia\nsupernovae (SNe), AIC, energetic SNe and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).

We suggest that tides from a\nmisaligned companion neutron star can cause the observed effects. We make\nnumerical models of a Be star decretion disc in which the spin of the Be star\nis misaligned with the orbital axis of a neutron star companion. Tidal torques\nfrom the neutron star truncate the disc at a radius small enough that the\nneutron star orbit does not intersect the disc unless the eccentricity or\nmisalignment is very large. A magnetic torque from the Be star that is largest\nat the equator, where the rotation is fastest, is approximated by an inner\nboundary condition. There are large oscillations in the mass and inclination of\nthe disc as it moves towards a steady state. These large variations may explain\nthe observed changes from Be star to Be shell star and vice-versa and also the\nType II X-ray outbursts. We find the tidal timescale on which the disc warps,\nprecesses and reaches a steady state to be around a year up to a few hundred\nyears.

Important\ninitial steps toward examining the potential effects of rapid accretion were\nrecently made by Baraffe, Chabrier, & Gallardo, who showed that in the limit of\nlow-temperature (\"cold\") accretion, protostars may have much smaller radii than\nfound in previous treatments. Such small radii at the end of protostellar\naccretion would have the effect of making some young stars appear much older -\nperhaps as much as 10 Myr - than they really are. However, we argue that very\nrapid disk accretion is unlikely to be cold, because observations of the\nbest-studied pre-main sequence disks with rapid disk accretion outbursts - the\nFU Ori objects - have spectral energy distributions which imply large, not\nsmall, protostellar radii. In addition, theory indicates models that at high\naccretion rates, protostellar disks become internally hot and geometrically\nthick, making it much more likely that hot material is added to the star. In\naddition, the very large luminosity of the accretion disk is likely to\nirradiate the central star strongly, heating up the outer layers and\npotentially expanding them.

{"id": "1108.4036", "contents": "Title: The Long-Term Evolution of Double White Dwarf Mergers Abstract: In this paper, we present a model for the long-term evolution of the merger\nof two unequal mass C/O white dwarfs (WDs). After the dynamical phase of the\nmerger, magnetic stresses rapidly redistribute angular momentum, leading to\nnearly solid-body rotation on a viscous timescale of 1e-4 to 1 yr, long before\nsignificant cooling can occur. Due to heating during the dynamical and viscous\nphases, the less massive WD is transformed into a hot, slowly rotating, and\nradially extended envelope supported by thermal pressure.\n  Following the viscous phase of evolution, the maximum temperature near the\nenvelope base may already be high enough to begin off-center convective\ncarbon-burning. If not, Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction of the inner region of the\nenvelope on a thermal timescale of 1e3-1e4 yr compresses the base of the\nenvelope, again yielding off-center burning. As a result, the long-term\nevolution of the merger remnant is similar to that seen in previous\ncalculations: the burning shell diffuses inwards over ~1e4 yr, eventually\nyielding a high-mass O/Ne WD or a collapse to a neutron star. During the\ncooling and shell-burning phases, the merger remnant radiates near the\nEddington limit. Given the double WD merger rate of a few per 1000 yr, tens of\nthese ~1e38 erg/s sources should exist in a Milky Way-type galaxy.\n  While the end result is similar to that of previous studies, the physical\npicture and the dynamical state of the matter in our model differ from previous\nwork. Furthermore, remaining uncertainties related to the convective structure\nnear the photosphere and mass loss during the thermal evolution may\nsignificantly affect our conclusions. Thus, future work within the context of\nthe physical model presented here is required to better address the eventual\nfate of double WD mergers, including those for which one or both of the\ncomponents is a He WD. \n\n"}

We assume\nthat the disk is built gradually and smoothly by the infall, resulting in good\nnumerical convergence. We confirm that for disks around solar-mass stars,\ninfall at high rates at radii beyond ~50 AU leads to disk fragmentation. At\nlower infall rates <1e-5 Msun/yr, however, irradiation suppresses\nfragmentation. We find that, once formed, the fragments or clumps migrate\ninward on typical type-I time scales of ~2e3 yr initially, but later migration\ndeviates from the type-I time scale when the clump becomes more massive than\nthe local disk mass, and/or when they starts to open gaps. As they migrate, the\nclumps accrete from the disk at a rate 1e-3 to 1e-1 MJupiter/yr, consistent\nwith analytic estimates that assume a 1-2 Hill radii cross section.

Motivated by\nrecent two-dimensional wind simulations, we vary the dynamical evolution during\nthe \\nu p-process and show that final abundances strongly depend on the\ntemperature evolution.

We find that the \\nu p-process starts to\nefficiently produce heavy elements only when the temperature drops below ~3 GK.\nAt higher temperatures, due to the low alpha separation energy of 60Zn\n(S_{\\alpha} = 2.7 MeV) the reaction 59Cu(p,\\alpha)56Ni is faster than the\nreaction 59Cu(p,\\gamma)60Zn.

This \"flash mixing\"\nproduces hotter-than-normal EHB stars with atmospheres significantly enhanced\nin helium and carbon. The larger bolometric correction, combined with the\ndecrease in hydrogen opacity, makes these stars appear subluminous in the\noptical and UV.

The aim\nis to characterize the warmer parts of the protostellar envelope in order to\nquantify the feedback of the protostars on their surroundings in terms of\nshocks, UV heating, photodissociation and outflow dispersal. Fully sampled\nlarge scale maps of the region were obtained; APEX-CHAMP+ was used for 12CO\n6-5, 13CO 6-5 and [CI] 2-1, and JCMT-HARP-B for 12CO 3-2 emissions.\nComplementary Herschel-HIFI and ground-based lines of CO and its isotopologs,\nfrom 1-0 upto 10-9 (Eu/k 300K), are collected at the source positions.\nRadiative-transfer models of the dust and lines are used to determine\ntemperatures and masses of the outflowing and UV-heated gas and infer the CO\nabundance structure. Broad CO emission line profiles trace entrained shocked\ngas along the outflow walls, with typical temperatures of ~100K. At other\npositions surrounding the outflow and the protostar, the 6-5 line profiles are\nnarrow indicating UV excitation. The narrow 13CO 6-5 data directly reveal the\nUV heated gas distribution for the first time. The amount of UV-heated and\noutflowing gas are found to be comparable from the 12CO and 13CO 6-5 maps,\nimplying that UV photons can affect the gas as much as the outflows. Weak [CI]\nemission throughout the region indicates a lack of CO dissociating photons.\nModeling of the C18O lines indicates the necessity of a \"drop\" abundance\nprofile throughout the envelope where the CO freezes out and is reloaded back\ninto the gas phase, thus providing quantitative evidence for the CO ice\nevaporation zone around the protostars. The inner abundances are less than the\ncanonical value of CO/H_2=2.7x10^-4, indicating some processing of CO into\nother species on the grains. \n\n"}

We use\nhigh-quality observations with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope to establish\nthat so-called type II spicules are characterized by the simultaneous action of\nthree different types of motion: 1. field-aligned flows of order 50-100 km/s,\n2. swaying motions of order 15-20 km/s, and 3. torsional motions of order 25-30\nkm/s. The first two modes have been studied in detail before, but not the\ntorsional motions. Our analysis of many near-limb and off-limb spectra and\nnarrow-band images yields strong evidence that most, if not all, type-II\nspicules undergo large torsional modulation and that these motions, like\nspicule swaying, represent Alfvenic waves propagating outward at several\nhundred km/s. The combined action of the different motions explains the similar\nmorphology of spicule bushes in the outer red and blue wings of chromospheric\nlines, and needs to be taken into account when interpreting Doppler motions to\nderive estimates for field-aligned flows in spicules and determining the\nAlfvenic wave energy in the solar atmosphere.

Results from the theory of radiatively driven winds are incorporated\nin stellar evolutionary and population synthesis models, and used in our\ninterpretation of the observations of the deep Universe. Yet, the theory has\nbeen confirmed only until Small Magellanic Cloud metallicities. Analyses of\nO-stars at lower metallicities are needed to prove the theory. Aims. We have\nobserved GHV-62024, an O6.5 IIIf star in the low-metallicity galaxy IC1613.\nAccording to a previous preliminary analysis this star could challenge the\nradiatively driven wind theory at low metallicities. Methods. Our observations\nwere obtained with VIMOS at VLT, at R~2000 and were analysed using the latest\nversion of the model atmosphere code FASTWIND, which includes N III Results. We\nobtain the stellar parameters and conclude that the star follows the average\nwind momentum-luminosity relationship (WLR) expected for its metallicity, but\nwith a high value for the exponent of the wind velocity law, beta. We suggest\nthat this high value may be reached because GHV-62024 could be a fast rotator\nseen at a low inclination angle. While the derived beta value does not change\nby adopting a lower wind terminal velocity, a wrong $V_\\infty$ has a clear\nimpact on the position of the star in the WLR diagram.

However, the mechanisms of angular momentum transport in\nstars remain theoretically uncertain and very complex to take into account in\nstellar models. To achieve a better understanding of these processes, we\ndesperately need observational constraints on the internal rotation of stars,\nwhich until very recently were restricted to the Sun. In this paper, we report\nthe detection of mixed modes - i.e. modes that behave both as g modes in the\ncore and as p modes in the envelope - in the spectrum of the early red giant\nKIC7341231, which was observed during one year with the Kepler spacecraft. By\nperforming an analysis of the oscillation spectrum of the star, we show that\nits non-radial modes are clearly split by stellar rotation and we are able to\ndetermine precisely the rotational splittings of 18 modes.

We use this model to perform inversions of the internal\nrotation profile of the star, which enables us to show that the core of the\nstar is rotating at least five times faster than the envelope. This will shed\nnew light on the processes of transport of angular momentum in stars. In\nparticular, this result can be used to place constraints on the angular\nmomentum coupling between the core and the envelope of early red giants, which\ncould help us discriminate between the theories that have been proposed over\nthe last decades. \n\n"}

By changing systematically the shear rates that symbolize the\ndegree of differential rotation in nascent proto-neutron stars (PNSs), we\nderive a scaling relation between the turbulent stress sustained by the MRI and\nthe shear- vorticity ratio.

Abstract: The lightcurve of the explosion of a star with a radius <10-100Rsun is\npowered mostly by radioactive decay. Observationally such events are dominated\nby hydrogen deficient progenitors and classified as Type I supernovae: white\ndwarf thermonuclear explosions (Type Ia) and core collapses of\nhydrogen-stripped massive stars (Type Ibc). Transient surveys are finding SNe I\nin increasing numbers and at earlier times, allowing their early emission to be\nstudied in unprecedented detail. Motivated by these developments, we summarize\nthe physics that produces their rising lightcurves and discuss how observations\ncan be utilized to study these exploding stars. The early radioactive-powered\nlightcurves probe the shallowest 56Ni deposits. If the amount of 56Ni mixing\ncan be deduced, then it places constraints on the progenitor and properties of\nthe explosive burning. In practice we find it is difficult to disentangle\nwhether the explosion occurred recently and one is seeing 56Ni heating near the\nsurface or whether the explosion began in the past and 56Ni heating is deeper.\nIn the latter case there is a \"dark phase\" between the moment of explosion and\nthe first light observed from the shallowest layers of 56Ni. Because of this,\nsimply extrapolating a lightcurve from 56Ni back in time is not a reliable\nmethod for estimating the explosion time. The best solution is to directly\nidentify the moment of explosion, by either observing shock breakout or\nshock-heated surface cooling, so the depth being probed by the rising\nlightcurve is known. Since this is typically not available, we identify other\ndiagnostics that are helpful for deciphering how recently an explosion\noccurred. As an example we apply these arguments to the SN Ic PTF 10vgv. We\ndemonstrate that just a single measurement of the photospheric velocity and\ntemperature during the rise places constraints on its explosion time, radius,\nand 56Ni mixing. \n\n"}

Turbulence dies away for\nAm < 1, and becomes progressively more vigorous as ambipolar diffusion is\ndecreased. Near-ideal MHD behavior is recovered for Am > 1000. In the\nintermediate regime (10 < Am < 1000) ambipolar diffusion leads to substantial\nincreases in both the period of the MRI dynamo cycle and the characteristic\nscales of magnetic field structures.

Using this procedure, we confirmed that the polarization\ndistribution projected on the celestial plane strongly depends on the viewing\nangle of the cloud.

We report on four iso-phase X-ray\nspectroscopic observations of the RS CVn binary EI Eri with XMM-Newton, carried\nout approximately every two days, to match the rotation period of EI Eri. We\npresent an analysis of the thermal and chemical structure of the Ei Eri corona\nas it evolves over the six days. Although the corona is rather steady in its\ntemperature distribution, the emission measure and FIP bias both vary and seem\nto be correlated. An active region, predating the beginning of the campaign,\nrepeatedly enters into our view at the same phase as it rotates from beyond the\nstellar limb. As a result, the abundances tend slightly, but consistently, to\nincrease for high FIP elements (an inverse FIP effect) with phase.

We analyse the\ndisc counterpart to type II spicules, RBEs, in three high quality datasets from\nCRISP at the SST. In a quiet Sun region at disc centre we find lower Doppler\nvelocities, 15-40km/s, and Doppler widths, 2-15km/s, of RBEs than in earlier\ncoronal hole studies, 30-50km/s and 7-23km/s, respectively. We examine the\nspatial dependence of Doppler velocities and widths along RBE axes and conclude\nthat there is no clear trend over the FOV or in individual RBEs in quiet Sun at\ndisc centre. These differences with previous coronal hole studies are\nattributed to the more varying magnetic field configuration in quiet Sun\nconditions. Using an extremely high cadence dataset allowed us to improve\ngreatly on the determination of lifetimes of RBEs, found to range from 5 to 60s\nwith an average of 30s, as well as the transverse motions in RBEs, with\ntransverse velocities up to 55km/s and averaging 12km/s. Furthermore, our\nmeasurements of the recurrence rates of RBEs provide important new constraints\non coronal heating by spicules. We also see many examples of a sinusoidal wave\npattern in the transverse motion with periods averaging 54s and amplitudes from\n21.5 to 129km, agreeing well with previous studies of wave motion in limb\nspicules. We interpret the appearance of RBEs over their full length within a\nfew seconds as the result of a combination of three kinds of motions as\nreported earlier for spicules.

But if disks are\nturbulent, this neglects a spectrum of stochastic density fluctuations that can\nproduce rare, high-density mass concentrations. Here, we use a\nrecently-developed analytic framework to predict the statistics of these\nfluctuations, i.e. the rate of fragmentation and mass spectrum of fragments\nformed in a turbulent Keplerian disk. Turbulent disks are never completely\nstable: we calculate the (always finite) probability of forming\nself-gravitating structures via stochastic turbulent density fluctuations in\nsuch disks. Modest sub-sonic turbulence above Mach number ~0.1 can produce a\nfew stochastic fragmentation or 'direct collapse' events over ~Myr timescales,\neven if Q>>1 and cooling is slow (t_cool>>t_orbit). In trans-sonic turbulence\nthis extends to Q~100. We derive the true Q-criterion needed to suppress such\nevents, which scales exponentially with Mach number. We specify to turbulence\ndriven by MRI, convection, or spiral waves, and derive equivalent criteria in\nterms of Q and the cooling time. Cooling times >~50*t_dyn may be required to\ncompletely suppress fragmentation. These gravoturbulent events produce mass\nspectra peaked near ~M_disk*(Q*M_disk/M_star)^2 (rocky-to-giant planet masses,\nincreasing with distance from the star).

Here, we study the underlying dynamical mechanisms which\ncan incite planetary escape in two-planet post-main sequence systems. Stellar\nmass loss alone is unlikely to be rapid and high enough to eject planets at\ntypically-observed separations. However, the combination of mass loss and\nplanet-planet interactions can prompt a shift from stable to chaotic regions of\nphase space. Consequently, when mass loss ceases, the unstable configuration\nmay cause escape. By assuming a constant stellar mass loss rate, we utilize\nmaps of dynamical stability to illustrate the distribution of regular and\nchaotic trajectories in phase space. We show that chaos can drive the planets\nto undergo close encounters, leading to the ejection of one planet. Stellar\nmass loss can trigger the transition of a planetary system from a stable to\nchaotic configuration, subsequently causing escape.

The good angular resolution of the\nHerschel maps corresponds to physical scales of 0.1 - 0.4 pc, and allows us to\nanalyze the small-scale structures of the clouds. The full extent of the CNC\nwas mapped with PACS and SPIRE from 70 to 500 micron. We determine temperatures\nand column densities at each point in this maps by modeling the observed FIR\nSEDs. We also derive a map showing the strength of the UV field. We investigate\nthe relation between the cloud properties and the spatial distribution of the\nhigh-mass stars, and compute total cloud masses for different density\nthresholds. Our Herschel maps resolve, for the first time, the small-scale\nstructure of the dense clouds. Several particularly interesting regions,\nincluding the prominent pillars south of eta Car, are analyzed in detail. We\ncompare the cloud masses derived from the Herschel data to previous mass\nestimates based on sub-mm and molecular line data. Our maps also reveal a\npeculiar \"wave\"-like pattern in the northern part of the Carina Nebula.\nFinally, we characterize two prominent cloud complexes at the periphery of our\nHerschel maps, which are probably molecular clouds in the Galactic background.\nWe find that the density and temperature structure of the clouds in most parts\nof the CNC is dominated by the strong feedback from the numerous massive stars,\nrather than random turbulence. Comparing the cloud mass and the star formation\nrate derived for the CNC to other Galactic star forming regions suggests that\nthe CNC is forming stars in an particularly efficient way.

We describe\na new, simple method to correct spectroscopically derived temperatures\n(\"excitation temperatures\") of metal-poor stars based on a literature sample\nwith -3.3<[Fe/H]<-2.5. Excitation temperatures were determined from FeI line\nabundances in high-resolution optical spectra in the wavelength range of ~3700\nto ~7000A, although shorter wavelength ranges, up to 4750 to 6800A, can also be\nemployed, and compared with photometric literature temperatures. Our adjustment\nscheme increases the temperatures up to several hundred degrees for cool red\ngiants, while leaving the near-main-sequence stars mostly unchanged. Hence, it\nbrings the excitation temperatures in good agreement with photometrically\nderived values. The modified temperature also influences other stellar\nparameters, as the FeI-FeII ionization balance is simultaneously used to\ndetermine the surface gravity, while also forcing no abundance trend on the\nabsorption line strengths to obtain the microturbulent velocity. As a result of\nincreasing the temperature, the often too low gravities and too high\nmicroturbulent velocities in red giants become higher and lower, respectively.\nOur adjustment scheme thus continues to build on the advantage of deriving\ntemperatures from spectroscopy alone, independent of reddening, while at the\nsame time producing stellar chemical abundances that are more straightforwardly\ncomparable to studies based on photometrically derived temperatures. Hence, our\nmethod may prove beneficial for comparing different studies in the literature\nas well as the many high-resolution stellar spectroscopic surveys that are or\nwill be carried out in the next few years. \n\n"}

Alternatively, phase-dependent absorption has\nbeen used to reproduce the X-ray data.

The thermonuclear explosion of\na white dwarf can explain their observed properties, but neither the progenitor\nsystems nor any stellar remnants have been conclusively identified.\nUnderluminous SN Ia have been proposed to originate from a so-called\ndouble-detonation of a white dwarf. After a critical amount of helium is\ndeposited on the surface through accretion from a close companion, the helium\nis ignited causing a detonation wave that triggers the explosion of the white\ndwarf itself.

The results show that BD And is a detached\nbinary system, whose components have a little temperature difference of about\n40 K. By analyzing photometric available light minimum times, we also derived\nan update ephemeris and found for the first time a possible periodic\noscillation with an amplitude of 0.011 days and a period of 9.6 years. The\nresults indicate that the periodic oscillation could be caused by a third\ncomponent physically attached to the eclipsing binary. After removing the light\nvariations due to the eclipses and proximity effects, the light-curve\ndistortions are further explained by the pulsation of the primary component\nwith a dominant period of 1 day. In accordance with the position of the primary\ncomponent on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and its pulsation period, the\nprimary component of BD And could be an excellent gamma Doradus candidate. It\nis rarely phenomenon that a component of the eclipsing binary system is a gamma\nDoradus variable. \n\n"}

Methods: We combine high-resolution\nSoHO/MDI magnetograms with TRACE observations taken in the 1216 {\\AA} channel\nin order to analyze the temporal evolution of an emerging small-scale magnetic\nloop and its traces in the chromosphere. Results: At first place, we find\nsignatures of flux emergence very close to the edge of a supergranular network\nboundary located at disk center. The new emerging flux appears first in the MDI\nmagnetograms in form of an asymmetric bipolar element, i.e. the patch with\nnegative polarity is roughly two-times weaker than the corresponding patch with\nopposite polarity. The average values of magnetic flux and magnetic flux\ndensities reach 1.6 x 10^18 Mx, -8.5 x 10^17 Mx, and 55 Mx cm^-2, -30 Mx cm^-2,\nrespectively. The spatial distance between the opposite polarity patches of the\nemerged feature increases from about 2.5\" to 5.0\" during the lifetime of the\nloop which was not longer than 36 min. A more precise lifetime-estimate of the\nfeature was not possible because of a gap in the temporal sequence of the MDI\nmagnetograms. The chromospheric response to the emerged magnetic dipole occurs\n~ 9 minutes later with respect to the photospheric magnetograms. It consists of\na quasi-periodic sequence of time-localized brightenings visible in the 1216\n{\\AA} TRACE channel apparent for ~ 14 minutes and being co-spatial with the\naxis connecting the two patches of opposite magnetic polarity. Conclusions: We\nidentify the observed event as a small-scale magnetic loop emerging at\nphotospheric layers and subsequently rising up to the chromosphere. We discuss\nthe possibility that the fluctuations detected in the chromospheric emission\nprobably reflect magnetic field oscillations which propagate to the\nchromosphere in form of waves. \n\n"}

Even after the primordial accretion disk has been\ncleared out, the star's high-energy radiation continues to affect the formation\nand evolution of dust, planetesimals, and large planets. Young stars with\ndebris disks are thus ideal environments for studying the earliest stages of\nnon-accretion-driven coronae. In this paper we simulate the corona of AU Mic, a\nnearby active M dwarf with an edge-on debris disk. We apply a self-consistent\nmodel of coronal loop heating that was derived from numerical simulations of\nsolar field-line tangling and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We also\nsynthesize the modeled star's X-ray luminosity and thermal radio/millimeter\ncontinuum emission. A realistic set of parameter choices for AU Mic produces\nsimulated observations that agree with all existing measurements and upper\nlimits. This coronal model thus represents an alternative explanation for a\nrecently discovered ALMA central emission peak that was suggested to be the\nresult of an inner \"asteroid belt\" within 3 AU of the star. However, it is also\npossible that the central 1.3 mm peak is caused by a combination of active\ncoronal emission and a bright inner source of dusty debris.

Taking into account the non conservative\nevolution of the system due to mass loss from an accretion disk as a result of\npropeller action and from the companion via ablation by the pulsar, the\ntransition from the accretion powered to rotation powered phase is\ninvestigated. It is shown that the operation of the propeller and ablation\nmechanisms can be responsible for the formation and evolution of black widow\nmillisecond pulsar systems from the low mass X-ray binary phase at an orbital\nperiod of ~0.1 day. For a range of population synthesis input parameters, the\nresults reveal that a population of black widow millisecond pulsars\ncharacterized by orbital periods as long as ~0.4 days and companion masses as\nlow as ~0.005 Msun can be produced. The orbital periods and minimum companion\nmass of this radio millisecond pulsar population critically depend on the\nthermal bloating of the semi-degenerate hydrogen mass losing component, with\nlonger orbital periods for a greater degree of bloating.

In this paper, we study the\norigin of these discrepancies.

We also explore an alternative configuration with\npulsational-delayed detonations (PDDEL model series). Because of the pulsation,\nPDDEL models retain more unburnt carbon, have little mass at high velocity, and\nhave a much hotter outer ejecta after the explosion. The pulsation does not\ninfluence the inner ejecta, so PDDEL and DDC models exhibit similar radiative\nproperties beyond maximum. However, at early times, PDDEL models show bluer\noptical colors and a higher luminosity, even for weak mixing. Their early-time\nradiation is derived primarily from the initial shock-deposited energy in the\nouter ejecta rather than radioactive decay heating.

The gravitational torque\non the disc from an inclined binary makes the disc precess around the binary\naxis, while the star-disc interaction torque due to the rotation-induced\nquadrupole makes the stellar spin and the disc angular momentum axes precess\naround each other. A significant star-disc misalignment angle can be generated\nfrom a small initial value as the star-disc system evolves in time such that\nthe two precession frequencies cross each other. This ``secular resonance''\nbehavior can be understood in a geometric way from the precession dynamics of\nspin and disc angular momenta. We derive the conditions for such resonance to\noccur, and find that they can be satisfied for reasonable protostar-disc-binary\nparameters. The evolution of star-disc inclination is also affected by mass\naccretion and by magnetic star-disc interaction torques, which can either\npromote or reduce star-disc misalignment. In general, as long as the initial\nbinary-disc inclination is greater than a few degrees, a variety of star-disc\nmisalignment angles can be generated within the disc lifetimes. We discuss the\nimplications of our results for the stellar spin orientations in binaries, for\nthe alignments/misalignments of protostellar discs and debris discs, and for\nthe stellar obliquities in exoplanetary systems. In particular, if hot Jupiters\nare produced by the Kozai effect induced by an external stellar companion, then\nit is likely that ``primordial'' star-disc misalignments are already generated\nby the star-disc-binary interactions. Even for systems where the Kozai effect\nis suppressed, misaligned planets may still be produced during the\nprotoplanetary disc phase. \n\n"}

Abstract: Recent analysis of the interstellar helium fluxes measured in 2009-2010 at\nEarth orbit by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) has suggested that the\ninterstellar velocity (both direction and magnitude) is inconsistent with that\nderived previously from Ulysses/GAS observations made in the period from 1990\nto 2002 at 1.5-5.5 AU from the Sun. Both results are model-dependent and models\nthat were used in the analyses are different. In this paper, we perform an\nanalysis of the Uysses/GAS and IBEX-Lo data using our state-of-the-art 3D\ntime-dependent kinetic model of interstellar atoms in the heliosphere. For the\nfirst time we analyze Ulysses/GAS data from year 2007, the closest available\nUlysses/GAS observations in time to the IBEX observations.\n  We show that the interstellar velocity derived from the Ulysses 2007 data is\nconsistent with previous Ulysses results and does not agree with the velocity\nderived from IBEX. This conclusion is very robust since, as is shown in the\npaper, it does not depend on the ionization rates adopted in theoretical\nmodels.\n  We conclude that Ulysses data are not consistent with the new LISM velocity\nvector from IBEX. In contrast, IBEX data, in principle, could be explained with\nthe LISM velocity vector derived from the Ulysses data. This is possible for\nthe models with the interstellar temperature increased from 6300 K to 9000 K.\nThere is a need to perform further study of possible reasons for the broadening\nof the helium signal core measured by IBEX.

Large deviations between the abundances of\nthe host star and its gas giants seem likely to occur if the planet formation\nfollows the core-accretion scenario. These deviations stem from the separate\nevolution of gas and dust in the disk, where the dust forms the planet cores,\nfollowed by the final run-away accretion of the left-over gas. ProDiMo\nprotoplanetary disk models are used to predict the chemical evolution of gas\nand ice in the midplane. We find that cosmic rays play a crucial role in slowly\nun-blocking the CO, where the liberated oxygen forms water, which then freezes\nout quickly. Therefore, the C/O ratio in the gas phase is found to gradually\nincrease with time, in a region bracketed by the water and CO ice-lines. In\nthis regions, C/O is found to approach unity after about 5 Myrs, scaling with\nthe cosmic ray ionisation rate.

Planetesimals are scattered progressively inward by a system of 5-7\nplanets from 30-60 AU to very close-in. In successful simulations the outermost\nplanets are typically Neptune-mass.

We have\ninvestigated the structures and kinematics of the outflows driven by the YSO DG\nTauri, using the Near-infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) on Gemini\nNorth. The blueshifted outflow shows two distinct components in [Fe II] 1.644\nmicron emission, which are separated using multi-component line fitting. A\nstationary recollimation shock is observed, in agreement with previous X-ray\nand FUV observations. The presence of this shock indicates that the innermost\nstreamlines of the high-velocity component are launched at a very small radius,\n0.01-0.15 AU, from the central star. The jet accelerates and expands downstream\nof the recollimation shock; the 'acceleration' is likely a sign of velocity\nvariations in the jet. No evidence of rotation is found, and we compare this\nnon-detection to previous counter-claims. Moving jet knots, likely the result\nof the jet velocity variations, are observed. One of these knots moves more\nslowly than previously observed knots, and the knot ejection interval appears\nto be non-periodic. An intermediate-velocity component surrounds this central\njet, and is interpreted as the result of a turbulent mixing layer along the jet\nboundaries. Such lateral entrainment requires the presence of a magnetic field\nof strength a few mG or less at hundreds of AU above the disc surface, which is\nargued to be a reasonable proposition.

The (peak) luminosity function is roughly dN/dL\nL^(-1.4+/-0.3), so the rates for events more luminous than V1309 Sco (M_V=-7\nmag) or V838Mon (M_V=-10 mag) are lower at r~0.1/year and 0.03/year,\nrespectively. The peak luminosity is a steep function of progenitor mass, L\nM^(2-3). This very roughly parallels the scaling of luminosity with mass on the\nmain sequence, but the transients are ~2000-4000 times more luminous at peak.\nCombining these, the mass function of the progenitors, dN/dM M^(-2.0+/-0.8), is\nconsistent with the initial mass function, albeit with broad uncertainties.\nThese observational results are also broadly consistent with the estimates of\nbinary population synthesis models.

At sufficiently\nlarge scales such as the BAO scale, a standard approach for the bias problem on\nthe basis of the perturbation theory (PT) is to assume the `local bias' model\nin which the density field of biased tracers is deterministically expanded in\nterms of matter density field at the same position. The higher-order bias\nparameters are then determined by combining the power spectrum with\nhigher-order statistics such as the bispectrum. As is pointed out by recent\nstudies, however, nonlinear gravitational evolution naturally induces nonlocal\nbias terms even if initially starting only with purely local bias. As a matter\nof fact, previous works showed that the second-order nonlocal bias term, which\ncorresponds to the gravitational tidal field, is important to explain the\ncharacteristic scale-dependence of the bispectrum. In this paper we extend the\nnonlocal bias term up to third order, and investigate whether the PT-based\nmodel including nonlocal bias terms can simultaneously explain the power\nspectrum and the bispectrum of simulated halos in $N$-body simulations. We show\nthat the power spectrum, including density and momentum, and the bispectrum\nbetween halo and matter in $N$-body simulations can be simultaneously well\nexplained by the model including up to third-order nonlocal bias terms up to\nk~0.1h/Mpc. Also, the results seem in a good agreement with theoretical\npredictions of a simple coevolution picture, although the agreement is not\nperfect. These demonstration clearly shows a failure of the local bias model\neven at such large scales, and we conclude that nonlocal bias terms should be\nconsistently included in order to model statistics of halos.

We\nespecially wish to know when the spin-down flow forced by the mass loss\nsupersedes the baroclinic flows that pervade the radiative envelope of rotating\nstars. We consider a Boussinesq fluid enclosed in a rigid sphere whose flows\nare forced both by the baroclinic torque, the spin-down of an outer layer, and\nan outward mass flux. The spin-down forcing is idealized in two ways: either by\na rigid layer that imposes its spinning down velocity at some interface or by a\nturbulent layer that imposes a stress at this same interface to the interior of\nthe star. In the case where the layer is rigid and imposes its velocity, we\nfind that, as the mass-loss rate increases, the flow inside the star shows two\ntransitions: the meridional circulation associated with baroclinic flows is\nfirst replaced by its spin-down counterpart, while at much stronger mass-loss\nrates the baroclinic differential rotation is superseded by the spin-down\ndifferential rotation. In fact, we find three wind regimes: weak (or no wind),\nmoderate, and strong. In the first case, the flow in the radiative envelope is\nof baroclinic origin. In the moderate case, the circulation results from the\nspin-down while the differential rotation may either be of baroclinic or of\nspin-down origin, depending on the coupling between mass and angular momentum\nlosses. For fast rotating stars, our model says that the moderate wind regime\nstarts when mass loss is higher than ~1e-11 Msun/yr. In the strong wind case,\nthe flow in the radiative envelope is mainly driven by angular momentum\nadvection.

While the EOS is still poorly known, there are\nalso longstanding ambiguities in choosing General Relativity or alternative\ngravity theories in the not-so-well tested strong-field regime. Besides\npossible appearance of hyperons and new phases, the most uncertain part of the\nnucleonic EOS is currently the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy.\nTo provide information that may help break the EOS-gravity degeneracy, we\ninvestigate effects of symmetry energy within its uncertain range determined by\nterrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments on the gravitational binding energy\nand spacetime curvature of neutron stars within GR and the scalar-tensor (ST)\ntheory of gravity. In particular, we focus on effects of the following\nparameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter: (1) the\nincompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter, (2) the slope $L$ of\nsymmetry energy at saturation density and (3) the high-density behavior of\nsymmetry energy. We find that the variation of either the density slope $L$ or\nthe high-density behavior of symmetry energy leads to large changes in both the\nbinding energy and curvature of neutron stars while effects of varying the more\nconstrained $K_0$ are negligibly small. The difference in predictions using the\nGR and the ST theory appears only for massive neutron stars, and is\nsignificantly smaller than the differences resulting from variations in the\nsymmetry energy. We conclude that within the ST theory of gravity, the\nEOS-gravity degeneracy has been broken by the recent relativistic pulsar\nmeasurements, and that measurements of neutron star properties sensitive to the\ncompactness constrain mainly the density dependence of the symmetry energy. \n\n"}

We also identified variables on the longest timescales\npossible of ~6 years, by comparing measurements taken early in the Spitzer\nmission with the mean from our YSOVAR campaign.

How such strong\nmagnetic fields can be generated and maintained is still an unsolved problem,\nwhich is, in principle, related to the interior structure of compact stars,\ni.e., the equation of state of cold matter at supra-nuclear density. In this\npaper we are trying to solve the problem in the regime of solid quark-cluster\nstars. Inside quark-cluster stars, the extremely low ratio of number density of\nelectrons to that of baryons $n_e/n_b$ and the screening effect from\nquark-clusters could reduce the long-range Coulomb interaction between\nelectrons to short-range interaction. In this case, the Stoner's model could\napply, and we find that the condition for ferromagnetism is consistent with\nthat for validity of Stoner's model. Under the screened Coulomb repulsion, the\nelectrons inside the stars could spontaneously magnetized and become\nferromagnetic, and hence would contribute non-zero net magnetic momentum to the\nwhole star. We conclude that, for most cases in solid quark-cluster stars, the\namount of net magnetic momentum, which is proportional to the amount of\nunbalanced spins $\\xi=(n_+-n_-)/n_e$ and depends on the number density of\nelectrons $n_e=n_++n_-$, could be significant with non-zero $\\xi$.

This is best visible for profiles with\nseveral components, such as those of class T, Q and M, because they most\nclearly exhibit a range of effects previously interpreted within the conal\nmodel. In particular, with no reference to the flaring boundary of the polar\nmagnetic flux tube, the stream model explains the apparent radius-to-frequency\nmapping (RFM), including its reduced strength for the inner pair of components.\nThe lag of the central component (apparent `core') with respect to the\ncentroids of the flanking (`conal') components can also be naturally explained\nwith no reference to emission rings located at disparate altitudes. The stream\nmodel also reveals why the millisecond pulsars, despite their more strongly\nflaring magnetic field lines, do not exhibit as strong RFM as the normal\npulsars. The model is then successful in reproducing properties of so disparate\nobjects as the M-class and millisecond pulsars, including some peculiarities of\nthe latter.

OCs span a sizeable range in metallicity\n-0.6<[Fe/H]<+0.4), and they show abundances of light elements similar to disk\nstars of the same age. A different pattern is observed for heavy elements.

Modulation is\ndetected in 15 stars. Most of them have non-typical period ratio of the radial\nmodes. In the Petersen diagram, at a given period of the fundamental mode, they\nare located significantly below or above the sequence formed by the majority of\nRRd stars.\n  Multi-periodic modulation is very frequent; two or three modulation periods\nare detected in 8 stars. Modulation periods vary from ~20 to more than 300\ndays. Radial mode amplitudes can be modulated by a few to nearly hundred per\ncent. Both radial modes may be modulated with the same period. More commonly\nhowever, dominant modulation for the fundamental mode has different period than\ndominant modulation for the first overtone. Quite often modulation of only one\nmode is detected in the data. We find a clear feedback between pulsation\namplitude of the dominant mode and mean stellar brightness: lower the pulsation\namplitude, brighter the star. At phases of low pulsation amplitude, the mode\nperiods are prone to fast changes. All the stars share the common feature:\ntheir pulsation properties are non-stationary. Amplitudes and phases of the\nradial modes vary irregularly on a long time-scale of a few hundred or thousand\ndays.

We compute Dopplergrams from the observed intensity profiles\nusing line bisectors and filter the resulting velocity maps for subsonic\noscillations. Lateral downflows appear everywhere in the center-side penumbra\nas small, weak patches of redshifts next to or along the edges of blueshifted\nflow channels. These patches have an intermittent life and undergo mergings and\nfragmentations quite frequently. The lateral downflows move together with the\nhosting filaments and react to their shape variations, very much resembling the\nevolution of granular convection in the quiet Sun. There is a good relation\nbetween brightness and velocity of the flow structures in the center-side\npenumbra, with downflows being darker than upflows on average, which is again\nreminiscent of quiet Sun convection.

We interpret the formation\nprocess in terms of negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI),\nwhich is a possible mechanism to explain the origin of sunspots. In our\nsimulations, we use a Cartesian domain of isothermal stratified gas that is\ndivided into two layers. In the lower layer, turbulence is forced with\ntransverse nonhelical random waves, whereas in the upper layer no flow is\ninduced. A weak uniform magnetic field is imposed in the entire domain at all\ntimes. In this study we vary the stratification by changing the gravitational\nacceleration, magnetic Reynolds number, strength of the imposed magnetic field,\nand size of the domain to investigate their influence on the formation process.\nBipolar magnetic structure formation takes place over a large range of\nparameters. The magnetic structures become more intense for higher\nstratification until the density contrast becomes around $100$ across the\nturbulent layer. For the Reynolds numbers considered, magnetic flux\nconcentrations are generated at magnetic Prandtl number between 0.1 and 1. The\nmagnetic field in bipolar regions increases with higher imposed field strength\nuntil the field becomes comparable to the equipartition field strength of the\nturbulence. A larger horizontal extent enables the flux concentrations to\nbecome stronger and more coherent. The size of the bipolar structures turns out\nto be independent of the domain size. In the case of bipolar region formation,\nwe find an exponential growth of the large-scale magnetic field, which is\nindicative of a hydromagnetic instability. Additionally, the flux\nconcentrations are correlated with strong large-scale downward and converging\nflows. These findings imply that NEMPI is responsible for magnetic flux\nconcentrations. \n\n"}

We developed a\ndedicated software to build a new custom mask that we used to refine the radial\nvelocity determination with the HARPS-N pipeline and perform the spectroscopic\nanalysis. Results. We updated the planetary ephemeris and showed the\nacceleration caused by the stellar binary companion. Our results on the stellar\nactivity variation suggest the presence of a high-latitude plage during the\ntime span of our observations. The correlation between the chromospheric\nactivity and the planetary orbital phase remains unclear. Solar-like\noscillations are detected in the radial velocity time series: we estimated\nasteroseismic quantities and found that they agree well with theoretical\npredictions.

However, it can also be generated by electromagnetic\nfields if electric and magnetic fields are simultaneously present. In most\nmodels of astrophysical objects, macroscopic charge neutrality is assumed and\nthe entire electromagnetic field is characterized in terms of a magnetic dipole\ncomponent. Hence, the purely electromagnetic contribution to the frame dragging\nvanishes. However, strange stars may posses independent electric dipole and\nneutron stars independent electric quadrupole moments that may lead to the\npresence of purely electromagnetic contributions to the frame dragging.\nMoreover, recent observations have shown that in stars with strong\nelectromagnetic fields, the magnetic quadrupole may have a significant\ncontribution to the dynamics of stellar processes. As an attempt to\ncharacterized and quantify the effect of electromagnetic frame-dragging in this\nkind of astrophysical objects, an analytic solution to the Einstein-Maxwell\nequations is constructed here on the basis that the electromagnetic field is\ngenerated by the combination of arbitrary magnetic and electric dipoles plus\narbitrary magnetic and electric quadrupole moments. The effect of each\nmultipole contribution on the vorticity scalar and the Poynting vector is\ndescribed in detail. Corrections on important quantities such the innermost\nstable circular orbit (ISCO) and the epyciclic frequencies are also considered. \n\n"}

Comparison of this fraction in this period\nrange (1-20 years) implies a large fraction for the full period range. This is\nreasonable in that the high accuracy velocities are sensitive to the longer\nperiods and smaller orbital velocity amplitudes in the period range sampled\nhere. Thus the Cepheid velocity sample provides a sensitive detection in the\nperiod range between short period spectroscopic binaries and resolved\ncompanions.

Tidal dissipation in stellar\nconvective envelopes is a key actor that shapes the orbital architecture of\nshort-period systems. Our objective is to understand and evaluate how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of low-mass stars (from M to F types)\ndepends on their mass, evolutionary stage and rotation. Using a simplified\ntwo-layer assumption, we compute analytically the frequency-averaged tidal\ndissipation in their convective envelope. This dissipation is due to the\nconversion into heat of the kinetic energy of tidal non wave-like/equilibrium\nflow and inertial waves because of the viscous friction applied by turbulent\nconvection. Using grids of stellar models allows us to study the variation of\nthe dissipation as a function of stellar mass and age on the Pre-Main-Sequence\nand on the Main-Sequence for stars with masses spanning from $0.4$ to\n$1.4M_{\\odot}$. As shown by observations, tidal dissipation in stars varies\nover several orders of magnitude as a function of stellar mass, age and\nrotation. During their Pre-Main-Sequence, all low-mass stars have an increase\nof the frequency-averaged tidal dissipation for a fixed angular velocity in\ntheir convective envelope until they reach a critical aspect and mass ratios.\nNext, the dissipation evolves on the Main Sequence to an asymptotic value that\nbecomes maximum for $0.6M_{\\odot}$ K-type stars and that decreases by several\norders of magnitude with increasing stellar mass. Finally, the rotational\nevolution of low-mass stars strengthens the importance of tidal dissipation\nduring the Pre-Main-Sequence for star-planet and multiple star systems. \n\n"}

This results in an\nextended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO) that appears at young ages\n($\\sim30$~Myr) and lasts beyond 1~Gyr. If this eMSTO is interpreted as an age\nspread, the resulting age spread is proportional to the age of the cluster,\ni.e. young clusters ($<100$~Myr) appear to have small age spreads (10s of Myr)\nwhereas older clusters ($\\sim1$~Gyr) appear to have much larger spreads, up to\na few hundred Myr.

The main aim of this work is to determine what extra information\nabout these disks can be extracted from polarimetry observations of\nmicrolensing events in addition to those given by photometry ones.

Both stellar generations are found at different evolutionary stages (e.g.,\nthe main-sequence turnoff, the subgiant branch, and the red giant branch). The\nnon detection of SG asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in several metal-poor\n([Fe/H] < -1) GCs suggests that not all SG stars ascend the AGB phase, and that\nfailed AGB stars may be very common in metal-poor GCs. This observation\nrepresents a serious problem for stellar evolution and GC formation/evolution\ntheories. We report fourteen SG-AGB stars in four metal-poor GCs (M 13, M 5, M\n3, and M 2) with different observational properties: horizontal branch (HB)\nmorphology, metallicity, and age. By combining the H-band Al abundances\nobtained by the APOGEE survey with ground-based optical photometry, we identify\nSG Al-rich AGB stars in these four GCs and show that Al-rich RGB/AGB GC stars\nshould be Na-rich. Our observations provide strong support for present,\nstandard stellar models, i.e., without including a strong mass-loss efficiency,\nfor low-mass HB stars.

II.\n  Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor Stars - CEMP-no stars Abstract: The detailed composition of most metal-poor halo stars has been found to be\nvery uniform. However, a fraction of 20-70% (increasing with decreasing\nmetallicity) exhibit dramatic enhancements in their abundances of carbon - the\nso-called carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. A key question for Galactic\nchemical evolution models is whether this non-standard composition reflects\nthat of the stellar natal clouds, or is due to local, post-birth mass transfer\nof chemically processed material from a binary companion; CEMP stars should\nthen all be members of binary systems. Our aim is to determine the frequency\nand orbital parameters of binaries among CEMP stars with and without\nover-abundances of neutron-capture elements - CEMP-s and CEMP-no stars,\nrespectively - as a test of this local mass-transfer scenario. This paper\ndiscusses a sample of 24 CEMP-no stars, while a subsequent paper will consider\na similar sample of CEMP-s stars. Most programme stars exhibit no statistically\nsignificant radial-velocit variation over this period and appear to be single,\nwhile four are found to be binaries with orbital periods of 300-2,000 days and\nnormal eccentricity; the binary frequency for the sample is 17+-9%. The single\nstars mostly belong to the recently-identified ``low-C band'', while the\nbinaries have higher absolute carbon abundances. We conclude that the\nnucleosynthetic process responsible for the strong carbon excess in these\nancient stars is unrelated to their binary status; the carbon was imprinted on\ntheir natal molecular clouds in the early Galactic ISM by an even earlier,\nexternal source, strongly indicating that the CEMP-no stars are likely bona\nfide second-generation stars. We discuss potential production sites for carbon\nand its transfer across interstellar distances in the early ISM, and\nimplications for the composition of high-redshift DLA systems. Abridged. \n\n"}

The optical\nspectrum of the source is almost featureless since the hydrogen and He I\nemissions lines, typically observed in LMXBs, are not detected. Similarly,\ncarbon and oxygen lines are neither observed. We marginally detect the He II\n4686 AA emission line, suggesting the presence of helium in the accretion disc.\nNo significant optical polarisation level was observed. The lack of hydrogen\nand He I emission lines in the spectrum implies that the companion is likely\nnot a main sequence star. Driven by the tentative detection of the He II 4686\nAA emission line, we suggest that the system could harbour a helium white\ndwarf.

This enormous speed-up enables the simultaneous many-label\nfitting of spectra with computationally expensive ab initio models for stellar\nspectra, such as non-LTE models. A PSM also enables the simultaneous fitting of\nobservational parameters, such as the spectrum's continuum or line-spread\nfunction. \n\n"}

We present a general analytical theory of\nthe dynamics of radiation pressure-driven, optically thick winds. Unlike the\nclassical adiabatic stellar wind solution whose dynamics are solely determined\nby the sonic radius, here the loss of the radiation pressure due to photon\ndiffusion also plays an important role. We identify two high mass loss rate\nregimes ($\\dot{M} > L_{\\rm Edd\\,}/c^2$). In the large total luminosity regime\nthe solution resembles an adiabatic wind solution. Both the radiative\nluminosity, $L$, and the kinetic luminosity, $L_k$, are super-Eddington with $L\n< L_k$ and $L \\propto L_k^{1/3}$. In the lower total luminosity regime most of\nthe energy is carried out by the radiation with $L_k < L \\approx L_{\\rm\nEdd\\,}$. In a third, low mass loss regime ($\\dot{M} < L_{\\rm Edd\\,}/c^2$), the\nwind becomes optically thin early on and, unless gas pressure is important at\nthis stage, the solution is very different from the adiabatic one. The results\nare independent from the energy generation mechanism at the foot of the wind,\ntherefore they are applicable to a wide range of mass ejection systems, from\nblack hole accretion, to planetary nebulae, and to classical novae. \n\n"}

Remarkably, we find that even with vigorous MRI turbulence, spiral\nshocks are an important component to the overall angular momentum budget, at\nleast when temperatures in the disk are high (so that Mach numbers are low). In\norder to understand the excitation, propagation, and damping of spiral density\nwaves in our simulations more carefully, we perform a series of 2D global\nhydrodynamical simulations with various equation of states and both with and\nwithout mass inflow via the Lagrangian point (L1). Compared with previous\nsimilar studies, we find the following new results. 1) Linear wave dispersion\nrelation fits the pitch angles of spiral density waves very well. 2) We\ndemonstrate explicitly that mass accretion is driven by the deposition of\nnegative angular momentum carried by the waves when they dissipate in shocks.\n3) Using Reynolds stress scaled by gas pressure to represent the effective\nangular momentum transport rate alpha_{eff} is not accurate when mass accretion\nis driven by non-axisymmetric shocks. 4) Using the mass accretion rate measured\nin our simulations to directly measure alpha defined in standard thin-disk\ntheory, we find 0.02 < alpha_{eff} < 0.05 for CV disks, consistent with\nobserved values in quiescent states of dwarf novae (DNe).

The fine structures (below 500 km) of flares are\nrarely observed and are accessible to only a few instruments world-wide. Here\nwe present observation of a solar flare using exceptionally high resolution\nimages from the 1.6~m New Solar Telescope (NST) equipped with high order\nadaptive optics at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO).

Therefore,\nin order to explain the observed large polarization of several L-dwarfs,\nrotation-induced oblateness or horizontally inhomogeneous cloud distribution in\nthe atmosphere is invoked. On the other hand, when an extra-solar planet of\nEarth-size or larger transits the brown dwarf along the line of sight, the\nasymmetry induced during the transit gives rise to a net non-zero, time\ndependent polarization. Employing atmospheric models for a range of effective\ntemperature and surface gravity appropriate for T- and L-dwarfs, I derive the\ntime dependent polarization profiles of these objects during transit phase and\nestimate the peak amplitude of polarization that occurs during the inner\ncontact points of the transit ingress/egress phase.

Such an amount of\npolarization is higher than that can be produced by rotation-induced oblateness\nof even the rapidly rotating L-dwarfs.

Similar erosion may occur for hot Jupiters with close\norbits around solar-like stars. We have developed a model, Forecasting a CME's\nAltered Trajectory (ForeCAT), which predicts a CME's deflection. We adapt\nForeCAT to simulate CME deflections for the mid-type M dwarf V374 Peg and hot\nJupiters with solar-type hosts. V374 Peg's strong magnetic fields can trap CMEs\nat the M dwarfs's Astrospheric Current Sheet, the location of the minimum in\nthe background magnetic field. Solar-type CMEs behave similarly, but have much\nsmaller deflections and do not get trapped at the Astrospheric Current Sheet.\nThe probability of planetary impact decreases with increasing inclination of\nthe planetary orbit with respect to the Astrospheric Current Sheet - 0.5 to 5\nCME impacts per day for M dwarf exoplanets, 0.05 to 0.5 CME impacts per day for\nsolar-type hot Jupiters.

Methods: We perform three-dimensional simulations of\nstratified fully compressible magnetohydrodynamic convection in rotating\nspherical wedges at various thermal and magnetic Prandtl numbers (from 0.25 to\n2 and 5, respectively). Results: We find that the rotation profiles for high\nthermal diffusivity show a monotonically increasing angular velocity from the\nbottom of the convection zone to the top and from the poles toward the equator.\nFor sufficiently rapid rotation, a region of negative radial shear develops at\nmid-latitudes as the thermal diffusivity is decreased. This coincides with a\nchange in the dynamo mode from poleward propagating activity belts to\nequatorward propagating ones. Furthermore, the cyclic solutions disappear at\nthe highest magnetic Reynolds numbers. The total magnetic energy increases with\nthe magnetic Reynolds number in the range studied here ($5-151$), but the\nenergies of the mean magnetic fields level off at high magnetic Reynolds\nnumbers. The differential rotation is strongly affected by the magnetic fields\nand almost vanishes at the highest magnetic Reynolds numbers.

The period ratios fall in a range similar\nto double-mode fundamental and first overtone RR Lyrae stars (RRd), with the\nexception of one star, in which the period ratio is significantly lower and\nnearly exactly equals 0.7. Although period ratios are fairly different for the\nfour stars, the light curve shapes corresponding to the dominant, fundamental\nmode are very similar.

This ~1\nGyr-old 400K dwarf is at a distance of 8pc and has a mass around 5 M_Jupiter.\nWe observed W1738 using two near-infrared filters at lambda~1um, Y and J, on\nGemini observatory, and two mid-infrared filters at lambda~4um, [3.6] and\n[4.5], on the Spitzer observatory. Twenty-four hours were spent on the source\nby Spitzer on each of June 30 and October 30 2013 UT. Between these\nobservations, around 5 hours were spent on the source by Gemini on each of July\n17 and August 23 2013 UT. The mid-infrared light curves show significant\nevolution between the two observations separated by four months. We find that a\ndouble sinusoid can be fit to the [4.5] data, where one sinusoid has a period\nof 6.0 +/- 0.1 hours and the other a period of 3.0 +/- 0.1 hours. The\nnear-infrared observations suggest variability with a ~3.0 hour period,\nalthough only at a <~2 sigma confidence level. We interpret our results as\nshowing that the Y dwarf has a 6.0 +/- 0.1 hour rotation period, with one or\nmore large-scale surface features being the source of variability. The\npeak-to-peak amplitude of the light curve at [4.5] is 3%. The amplitude of the\nnear-infrared variability, if real, may be as high as 5 to 30%. Intriguingly,\nthis size of variability and the wavelength dependence can be reproduced by\natmospheric models that include patchy KCl and Na_2S clouds and associated\nsmall changes in surface temperature. The small number of large features, and\nthe timescale for evolution of the features, is very similar to what is seen in\nthe atmospheres of the solar system gas giants. \n\n"}

Both exhibit elevated levels\nof X-ray emission at periastron. Our goal is to determine whether colliding\nmagnetospheres in young high-eccentricity binaries commonly produce elevated\naverage levels of X-ray activity. This work is based on Chandra snapshots of\nmultiple periastron and non-periastron passages in four nearby young eccentric\nbinaries (Parenago 523, RX J1622.7-2325 Nw, UZ Tau E, and HD 152404). We find\nthat for the merged sample of all 4 binaries the current X-ray data show an\nincreasing average X-ray flux near periastron (at about 2.5-sigma level).\nFurther comparison of these data with the X-ray properties of hundreds of young\nstars in the Orion Nebula Cluster, produced by the Chandra Orion Ultradeep\nProject (COUP), indicates that the X-ray emission from the merged sample of our\nbinaries can not be explained within the framework of the COUP-like X-ray\nactivity. However, due to the inhomogeneities of the merged binary sample and\nthe relatively low statistical significance of the detected flux increase,\nthese findings are regarded as tentative only.

This is because of the interaction between DM and NM, which\nleads to gravitationally or self-bound DMANSs. We study the radius of the NM\nsphere as well as the radius of the DM halo for different DMANSs. The results\nconfirm that, in some cases, a NM sphere with a small radius is surrounded by a\nhalo of DM with a larger radius.

We focus on the regime where the local thermal\ntimescale is shorter than the dynamical timescale, corresponding to inefficient\nconvective energy transport.

The\nunstable density inversion amplifies the magnetic field, increasing the\nmagnetic energy density to values close to equipartition with the turbulent\nkinetic energy density. By providing pressure support, the magnetic field's\npresence significantly increases the density fluctuations in the turbulent\nenvelope, thereby enhancing the radiative energy transport by allowing photons\nto diffuse out through low density regions. Magnetic buoyancy brings small\nscale magnetic fields to the photosphere and increases the vertical energy\ntransport with the energy advection velocity proportional to the Alfv\\'en\nvelocity, although in all cases we study photon diffusion still dominates the\nenergy transport. The increased radiative and advective energy transport causes\nthe stellar envelope to shrink by several scale heights.

We implement the quenching of the\nmass loss produced by a surface dipolar magnetic field into the Geneva stellar\nevolution code and compute new stellar models with an initial mass of\n$200\\,M_\\odot$ at solar metallicity, with and without rotation. It considerably\nreduces the total amount of mass lost by the star during its life. For the\nnon-rotating model, the total (CO-core) mass of the models is $72.8\\,M_\\odot$\n($70.1\\,M_\\odot$) at the onset of the electron-positron pair-creation\ninstability. For the rotating model, we obtain $65.6\\,M_\\odot$\n($62.4\\,M\\odot$). In both cases, a significant fraction of the internal mass\nlies in the region where pair instability occurs in the $\\log(T)-\\log(\\rho)$\nplane. The interaction of the reduced mass loss with the magnetic field\nefficiently brakes the surface of the rotating model, producing a strong shear\nand hence a very efficient mixing that makes the star evolve nearly\nhomogeneously. The core characteristics of our models indicate that solar\nmetallicity models of magnetic VMSs may evolve to PISNe (and pulsation PISNe). \n\n"}

For example, symbiotic stars without shell burning on\ntheir white dwarfs have been revealed through their X-ray emission, UV excess,\nand UV variability. These purely accretion powered symbiotic stars have much\nweaker optical emission lines than those with shell burning, and are therefore\nharder to discover. Yet they may be as numerous as symbiotic stars with shell\nburning. Interestingly, both types of symbiotic stars are capable of driving\nstrong outflows, leading to colliding wind X-ray emission and spatially\nresolved jets. For nova eruptions, the most surprising discovery has been that\nthey are capable of particle acceleration as evidenced by Fermi detection of\nnovae as transient GeV gamma-ray sources. For nova eruptions in cataclysmic\nvariables, this implicates internal shocks, between a slow, dense outflow and a\nfast outflow or wind. Other signatures of shocks include thermal X-rays and\nnon-thermal radio emissions, and a substantial fraction of optical emission may\nbe shock-powered in the early phase of novae. Radio (V959 Mon) and HST (V959\nMon and T Pyx) images of nova shells within a few years of their respective\neruptions suggest that the ejecta from a nova may commonly consist of an\nequatorial ring and a bipolar outflow. \n\n"}

A larger difference is found for one\ncluster (NGC 6752), and is most likely caused primarily by stochastic\nfluctuations in the numbers of bright red giants within the scanned area. As\nexpected, the alpha-elements (Ca, Ti) are enhanced by about 0.3 dex compared to\nthe Solar-scaled composition, while the [Cr/Fe] ratios are close to Solar.

Our goal was to monitor objects that possess a disk but have a weak\nHalpha line, a common accretion tracer for young stars, to determine whether\nthey host a passive circumstellar disk. We used medium-resolution optical\nspectroscopy to assess the objects' accretion status and to measure the Halpha\nline. We found no convincing example of passive disks; only transition disk and\ndebris disk systems in our sample are non-accreting. Among accretors, we find\nno example of flickering accretion, leading to an upper limit of 2.2% on the\nduty cycle of accretion gaps assuming that all accreting TTS experience such\nevents. Combining literature results with our observations, we find that the\nreliability of traditional Halpha-based criteria to test for accretion is high\nbut imperfect, particularly for low-mass TTS. We find a significant correlation\nbetween stellar mass and the full width at 10 per cent of the peak (W10%) of\nthe Halpha line that does not seem to be related to variations in free-fall\nvelocity. Finally, our data reveal a positive correlation between the Halpha\nequivalent width and its W10%, indicative of a systematic modulation in the\nline profile whereby the high-velocity wings of the line are proportionally\nmore enhanced than its core when the line luminosity increases. We argue that\nthis supports the hypothesis that the mass accretion rate on the central star\nis correlated with the Halpha W10% through a common physical mechanism. \n\n"}

We show that many tidal\nmodels provide thermal feedback, producing interior radiative zones and leading\nto enhanced g-mode dissipation with a wide spectrum of resonances. These\nresonances are dynamically tuned by the thermal feedback, and so represent a\nnovel form of thermomechanical feedback, coupling vibrational modes to the very\nslow thermal evolution of the planet.

This implies that violent mass loss must\nhave occurred several decades before the supernova explosion. Such a short time\ninterval suggests that eruptive mass loss could be common shortly prior to the\ndeath of a massive star as a SLSN.

It is a mystery why helium features are not detected, even though\nnon-thermal energy sources, capable of ionizing He atoms, may exist as\nsuggested by the O II absorption series in the early time spectra. At late\ntimes (+240d), our spectra appear to have intrinsically lower [O I]6300A\nluminosities than that of SN2015bn and SN2007bi, possibly an indication of\nsmaller oxygen masses (<10-30Msun).

Most embedded binary systems are\nfound toward the centres of their parent cores, although several systems have\ncomponents closer to the core edge. Wide binaries, defined as those systems\nwith physical separations greater than 500 au, show a tendency to be aligned\nwith the long axes of their parent cores, whereas tight binaries show no\npreferred orientation.

Within the considered parameter range, i.e., of\ngrain radii between 5 nm and 1 mm and an optically thin and thick disk with a\nparameterized density distribution, we obtain the following results: In\noptically thin disk regions, the temperature spread can be as large as ~63% and\nthe relative grain surface below a certain temperature is lower than in the\nreference disk. With increasing optical depth, the difference in the midplane\ntemperature and the relative grain surface below a certain temperature\ndecreases. Furthermore, below ~20K, this fraction is higher for the reference\ndisk than for the case of multiple grain radii, while it shows the opposite\nbehavior for temperatures above this threshold. The thermal emission in the\ncase of multiple grain radii at short wavelengths is stronger than for the\nreference disk. The freeze-out radius is a function of grain radius, spanning a\nradial range between the coldest and warmest grain species of ~30AU. \n\n"}

We have performed\nsimultaneous analyses of the temporal evolution in several chromospheric\nstellar lines, namely, the Ca II H and K lines, Halpha, Hbeta, Hgamma, Hdelta,\nHepsilon, the Ca II infrared triplet line, and He I D3.

This paper places constraints\non progenitor initial mass and metallicity in distinct core-collapse SN\nsubclasses, through a study of the parent stellar populations at the explosion\nsites. Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) of 83 nearby SN explosion sites with a\nmedian distance of 18 Mpc has been collected and analysed, enabling detection\nand spectral extraction of the parent stellar population of SN progenitors.\nFrom the parent stellar population spectrum, the initial mass and metallicity\nof the coeval progenitor are derived by means of comparison to simple stellar\npopulation models and strong-line methods. Additionally, near-infrared IFS was\nemployed to characterise the star formation history at the explosion sites. No\nsignificant metallicity differences are observed among distinct SN types. The\ntypical progenitor mass is found to be highest for SN Ic, followed by type Ib,\nthen types IIb and II.

Starting from newborn\npairs of stars, we follow their evolution including mass loss, mass transfer\nand accretion, common envelopes and supernova explosions. We apply the binding\nenergies of common envelopes based on dense grids of detailed stellar structure\nmodels, make use of improved investigations of the subsequent Case BB\nRoche-lobe overflow and scale supernova kicks according to the stripping of the\nexploding stars. We demonstrate that all the double black hole mergers,\nGW150914, LVT151012, GW151226, GW170104, GW170608 and GW170814, as well as the\ndouble neutron star merger GW170817, are accounted for in our models in the\nappropriate metallicity regime.

I show\nthat objects with M <~ 4 M_Jup orbit metal-rich solar-type dwarf stars, a\nproperty associated with core accretion. Objects with M >~ 10 M_Jup do not\nshare this property. This transition is coincident with a minimum in the\noccurrence rate of such objects, suggesting that the maximum mass of a\ncelestial body formed through core accretion like a planet is less than 10\nM_Jup. Consequently, objects with M >~ 10 M_Jup orbiting solar-type dwarf stars\nlikely formed through gravitational instability and should not be thought of as\nplanets. Theoretical models of giant planet formation in scaled minimum-mass\nsolar nebula Shakura--Sunyaev disks with standard parameters tuned to produce\ngiant planets predict a maximum mass nearly an order of magnitude larger.

We find that\nthe differential desorption of volatile species is amplified by the grains\nlarger than 0.1 $\\mu$m, because larger grains are heated to a lower temperature\nby cosmic-rays and hence more sensitive to the variations in binding energies.\nAs a result, atomic nitrogen N is $\\sim$2 orders of magnitude more abundant\nthan CO; N$_2$H$^+$ also becomes a few times more abundant than HCO$^+$ due to\nthe increased gas-phase N$_2$. However, the changes in ionization fraction due\nto freeze-out and desorption only have minor effects on the non-ideal MHD\ndiffusivities. Our chemical network confirms that the very small grains (VSGs:\nbelow a few 100 $\\AA$) weakens the efficiency of both ambipolar diffusion and\nHall effect.

The analysis is performed on 168 subregions of size 0.143 deg2,\ncovering a total contiguous area of 23.57 deg2.

With respect to\nprevious analyses, we use a far larger set of VMC data, updated stellar models,\nand fit the two available CMDs (Y-Ks versus Ks and J-Ks versus Ks)\nindependently. The results allow us to derive a more complete and more reliable\npicture of how the mean distances, extinction values, star formation rate, and\nmetallicities vary across the SMC, and provide a better description of the\npopulations that form its Bar and Wing.

These very distinct chemical fea- tures are\nsimilar to what is found in the centres of the massive early-type galaxies and\nmay influence measurements of the global properties of the galaxies.\nAdditionally, recent results have suggested that M/L variations found in the\ncentres of massive early-type galaxies might be due to a bottom-heavy stellar\ninitial mass function. We present an analysis of the effects of globular\ncluster-like multiple populations on the integrated properties of early-type\ngalaxies. In particular, we focus on spectral features in the integrated\noptical spectrum and the global mass-to-light ratio that have been used to\ninfer variations in the stellar initial mass function. To achieve this we\ndevelop appropriate stellar population synthesis models and take into account,\nfor the first time, an initial-final mass relation which takes into\nconsideration a varying He abundance. We conclude that while the multiple\npopulations may be present in massive early-type galaxies, they are likely not\nresponsible for the observed variations in the mass- to-light ratio and IMF\nsensitive line strengths. Finally, we estimate the fraction of stars with\nmultiple populations chemistry that come from disrupted globular clusters\nwithin massive ellipticals and find that they may explain some of the observed\nchemical patterns in the centres of these galaxies. \n\n"}

With the exquisite photometry of\n\\textit{Kepler}, the uncertainties in the seismic observables are small enough\nto estimate masses and radii with a precision of only a few per cent. Even\nthough this seems to work quite well for main-sequence stars, there is\nempirical evidence, mainly from studies of eclipsing binary systems, that the\nseismic scaling relations overestimate the mass and radius of red giants by\nabout 15 and 5\\%, respectively.

Two giants\nwere observed in fields towards the Galactic bulge but are likely in the inner\ndisk. One of the bulge field giants is super Li-rich with A(Li) = 4.0 dex.

Another giant is\nfound to be barium enhanced and thus could have accreted material from a former\nAGB companion. Otherwise, besides the Li enrichment, the evolutionary stages\nare the only other connection between these new Li-rich giants. The CoRoT data\nconfirm that one Li-rich giant is at the core-He burning stage. The other\ngiants are concentrated in close proximity to the RGB luminosity bump, the\ncore-He burning stages, or the early-AGB. This is very clear when looking at\nthe Gaia-based luminosities of the Li-rich giants.

We aim to\nconstrain radial differential rotation profiles in gamma Doradus (gamma Dor)\nstars, and to develop new theoretical seismic diagnosis for such stars with\nrapid and potentially non-uniform rotation. Methods. We derive a new asymptotic\ndescription which accounts for the impact of weak differential near-core\nrotation on gravity- mode period spacings. The theoretical predictions are\nillustrated from pulsation computations with the code GYRE and compared with\nobservations of gamma Dor stars. When possible, we also derive the surface\nrotation rates in these stars by detecting and analysing signatures of\nrotational modulation, and compute the core-to-surface rotation ratios.\nResults. Stellar rotation has to be strongly differential before its effects on\nperiod spacing patterns can be detected, unless multiple period spacing\npatterns can be compared. Six stars in our sample exhibit a single unexplained\nperiod spacing pattern of retrograde modes. We hypothesise that these are Yanai\nmodes.

If only one period spacing\npattern is detected and analysed for a star, it is difficult to detect\ndifferential rotation. A rigidly rotating model will often provide the best\nsolution.

To derive precise estimates of IFMRs and\nexplore how they may vary among star clusters, we propose a Bayesian\nhierarchical model that pools photo- metric data from multiple star clusters.\nAfter performing a simulation study to show the benefits of the Bayesian\nhierarchical model, we apply this model to five star clus- ters: the Hyades,\nM67, NGC 188, NGC 2168, and NGC 2477, leading to reasonable and consistent\nestimates of IFMRs for these clusters. We illustrate how a cluster-specific\nanalysis of NGC 188 using its own photometric data can produce an unreasonable\nIFMR since its WDs have a narrow range of zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) masses.\nHowever, the Bayesian hierarchical model corrects the cluster-specific analysis\nby bor- rowing strength from other clusters, thus generating more reliable\nestimates of IFMR parameters. The data analysis presents the benefits of\nBayesian hierarchical modelling over conventional cluster-specific methods,\nwhich motivates us to elaborate the pow- erful statistical techniques in this\narticle. \n\n"}

Magnetic reconnection during flares takes place in the corona but a\nsubstantial part of flare energy is deposited in the chromosphere. However,\nhigh-resolution spectro-polarimetric chromospheric observations of flares are\nvery rare. The most used observables are Ca II 8542 {\\AA} and He I 10830 {\\AA}.\nAims. We aim to study the chromosphere during a C3.6 class flare via\nspectro-polarimetric observations of the He I D3 line. Methods. We present the\nfirst SST/CRISP spectro-polarimetric observations of He I D3. We analyze the\ndata using the inversion code HAZEL, and estimate the LOS velocity and the\nmagnetic field vector. Results. Strong He I D3 emission at the flare\nfootpoints, as well as strong He I D3 absorption profiles tracing the flaring\nloops are observed during the flare. The He I D3 traveling emission kernels at\nthe flare footpoints exhibit strong chromospheric condensations of up to $\\sim$\n60 km/s at their leading edge. Our observations suggest that such condensations\nresult in shocking the deep chromosphere, causing broad and modestly\nblueshifted He I D3 profiles indicating subsequent upflows. A strong and rather\nvertical magnetic field of up to $\\sim$ 2500 G is measured in the flare\nfootpoints, confirming that the He I D3 line is likely formed in the deep\nchromosphere at those locations. We provide chromospheric line-of-sight\nvelocity and magnetic field maps obtained via He I D3 inversions. We propose a\nfan-spine configuration as the flare magnetic field topology. Conclusions. The\nHe I D3 line is an excellent diagnostic to study the chromosphere during\nflares. The impact of strong condensations on the deep chromosphere has been\nobserved.

One notable exception is GJ 758 B, a brown dwarf\ncompanion in a $\\sim$20 AU orbit around a nearby Sun-like star, which has been\nboth directly imaged and dynamically detected through a radial velocity trend\nin the primary. This has enabled a mass constraint for GJ 758 B of\n42$^{+19}_{-7}$ $M_{\\rm Jup}$.

This suggests that the system will finally merge\ninto a rapid-rotating single star and may produce a luminous red nova.

Helio- and asteroseismology reveal a strong extraction of\nangular momentum from stellar radiation zones over the whole\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram. Turbulent transport in differentially rotating\nstably stratified stellar radiation zones should be carefully modeled and its\nstrength evaluated. Stratification and rotation imply that this turbulent\ntransport is anisotropic. Only phenomenological prescriptions have been\nproposed for the transport in the horizontal direction, which however\nconstitutes a cornerstone in current theoretical formalisms for stellar\nhydrodynamics in evolution codes. We derive a new theoretical prescription for\nthe anisotropy of the turbulent transport in radiation zones using a spectral\nformalism for turbulence that takes simultaneously stable stratification,\nrotation, and a radial shear into account. Then, the horizontal turbulent\ntransport resulting from 3D turbulent motions sustained by the instability of\nthe radial differential rotation is derived. We implement this framework in the\nstellar evolution code STAREVOL and quantify its impact on the rotational and\nstructural evolution of low-mass stars from the pre-main-sequence to the red\ngiant branch. The anisotropy of the turbulent transport scales as\n$N^4\\tau^2/\\left(2\\Omega^2\\right)$, $N$ and $\\Omega$ being the buoyancy and\nrotation frequencies respectively and $\\tau$ a time characterizing the source\nof turbulence.

Due to the motions of binary and the\ncompanion stars around the common mass center of the ternary system, the\nlight-time effect produces an irregularity on the eclipse timings. Monitoring\nthe variations in these timings, sub-stellar or planet companions orbiting\naround the binary system can be identified.

More than five hundred minimum times equivalent to around\nnine decades are employed to identify the orbital behavior of the binary\nsystem. The best fit to the timings shows that the orbital period of DI Peg has\nvariation due to an integration of two sinusoids with the periods of $P_3 =\n49.50\\pm0.36$ yr and $P_4 = 27.40\\pm0.24$ yr.

In this work we investigate if\nspatially resolved observations of rarer CO isotopologues may be good tracers\nof Sigma_gas. Physical-chemical models with different input Sigma_gas(R) are\nrun. The input disk surface density profiles are compared with the simulated\n13CO intensity radial profiles to check if and where the two follow each other.\nThere is always an intermediate region in the disk where the slope of the 13CO\nradial emission profile and Sigma_gas(R) coincide. At small radii the line\nradial profile underestimates Sigma_gas, as 13CO emission becomes optically\nthick. The same happens at large radii where the column densities become too\nlow and 13CO is not able to efficiently self-shield. If the gas surface density\nprofile is a simple power-law of the radius, the input power-law index can be\nretrieved within 20% uncertainty if one choses the proper radial range. If\ninstead Sigma_gas(R) follows the self-similar solution for a viscously evolving\ndisk, retrieving the input power-law index becomes challenging, in particular\nfor small disks. Nevertheless, it is found that the power-law index can be in\nany case reliably fitted at a given line intensity contour around 6 K km/s, and\nthis produces a practical method to constrain the slope of Sigma_gas(R).\nApplication of such a method is shown in the case study of the TW Hya disk.\nSpatially resolved 13CO line radial profiles are promising to probe the disk\nsurface density distribution, as they directly trace Sigma_gas(R)profile at\nradii well resolvable by ALMA.

In this paper,\nwe simulate photometric variability introduced by randomly-distributed\nstarspots on a 125-Myr-old coeval cluster. Our simulation results show that\nrandomly distributed small spots on the stellar surface would explain this\ndiscrepancy that the photometric observations only reveal 10% to 40% of the\nspot coverage measured by spectra. The colors and luminosities of photospheres\nare modeled for a range of photospheric temperature, spot coverage, and spot\ntemperature. The colors and luminosities of a simulated population are then\ncompared to the luminosity spread of Pleiades members, excluding the 25% of\ncandidates that are identified as non-members with Gaia DR2 astrometry. The\nobserved luminosities of Pleiades members have a standard deviation of 0.05\ndex, which could be entirely explained by spots with a star-to-star standard\ndeviation of spot coverage of 10%, but with an average coverage area that is\nnot well constrained. \n\n"}

The evolving QSL footprints are used to define the outer edge of the\nflux rope at different times, and to identify and characterize new 3D\nreconnection geometries and sequences that occur above the ends of the flaring\nPIL. We also analyse flare-ribbons as observed in EUV by SDO/AIA and IRIS\nduring two X-class flares. The flux-rope footpoints are drifting during the\neruption, which is unexpected due to line-tying. This drifting is due to a\nseries of coronal reconnections that erode the flux rope on one side and\nenlarge it on the other side. Other changes in the flux-rope footpoint-area are\ndue to multiple reconnections of individual field lines whose topology can\nevolve sequentially from arcade to flux rope and finally to flare loop. These\nare associated with deformations and displacements of QSL footprints, which\nresemble those of the studied flare ribbons.

It is, however, fundamentally important in the understanding of the\nstellar and planetary formation and evolution mechanisms. We aim to\ncharacterize the presence of physical companions in orbit around nearby stars.\nOrbiting secondary bodies influence the proper motion (PM) of their parent star\nthrough their gravitational reflex motion. Using the Hipparcos catalog and\nGaia's second data release (GDR2), we determined the long-term PM of the stars\ncommon to these two catalogs. We then searched for a PM anomaly (PMa) between\nthe long-term PM vector and the GDR2 (or Hipparcos) measurements, indicative of\nthe presence of a perturbing secondary object. We focussed our analysis on the\n6741 nearby stars located within 50 pc, and we also present a catalog of the\nPMa for >99% of the Hipparcos catalog (>117000 stars). 30% of the stars studied\npresent a PMa greater than 3 sigmas. The PMa allows us to detect orbiting\ncompanions, or set stringent limits on their presence. We present a few\napplications to interesting targets.

We find that, for the\nparameters investigated, the resistive evolution of the structures follows a\nuniversal pattern when rescaled to resistive time.

The disk is stabilized if the wind-dominated region is large\nenough, potentially leading to `dark' disks emitting little radiation.\nWind-driven accretion can play a key role in shaping the light curves of DNe\nand X-ray binaries.

They are by far outnumbered by forty\nnon-DAs with Teff = 100,000 - 250,000 K, giving a DA/non-DA ratio of 0.2. In\ncontrast, this ratio is the inverse of that for the cooler WDs. One reason for\nthis discrepancy could be uncertainties in the temperature determination of hot\nDAs using Balmer-line spectroscopy. Recent investigations involving\nmetal-ionization balances in ultraviolet (UV) spectra indeed showed that the\ntemperatures of some DAs were underestimated, but the paucity of extremely hot\nDAs prevailed. Here we present the results of a UV spectral analysis of one of\nthe three hottest DAs, PG0948+534. We find that its temperature was strongly\noverestimated by recent Balmer line analyses. We correct it downward to 105,000\n$\\pm$ 5000 K, aggravating the hot-DA paucity. The Balmer-line problem\nencountered previously is not resolved by our non-LTE line-blanketed model\natmospheres. We speculate that it might be related to the possible presence of\na magnetosphere. This is supported by the V-band variability that shows a\nperiod of P=3.45 d (amplitude 0.19 mag), which we interpret as the star's\nrotation period. The metal abundances in PG0948+534 are affected by atomic\ndiffusion and we conclude that the onset of diffusion in hot DAs occurs when\nthey cool below Teff about 105,000 K. We discuss the possibility that the\npaucity of very hot DAs is a consequence of their fast evolutionary rate. \n\n"}

Methods: We use simulations of forced turbulence in\nfully periodic cubes composed of isothermal gas with an imposed large-scale\nsinusoidal shear flow. Turbulent viscosity is computed either from the\nresulting Reynolds stress or from the decay rate of the large-scale flow.\nTurbulent magnetic diffusivity is computed using the test-field method. The\nscale dependence of the coefficients is studied by varying the wavenumber of\nthe imposed sinusoidal shear and test fields. Results: We find that turbulent\nviscosity and magnetic diffusivity are in general of the same order of\nmagnitude. Furthermore, the turbulent viscosity depends on the fluid Reynolds\nnumber (${\\rm Re}$) and scale separation ratio of turbulence. The scale\ndependence of the turbulent viscosity is found to be well approximated by a\nLorentzian.

Step II: Subsequently, supernova\nexplosions occur inside the galaxy and then blow out as a galactic wind (or a\nsuperwind). This wind expands into the intergalactic space and then causes a\nlarge-scale shell with a radius of several hundreds of kpc. Since this radius\nmay be smaller than the typical separation between galaxies, interactions of\nshells may also occur, resulting in the formation of a large-scale gaseous\nslab.

We obtain highly significant (~25 sigma) velocity offsets\nbetween the OH and HI lines and the OH and CO lines, but measurements of\nalpha-independent systematics demonstrate that the observed velocity\ndifferences are entirely attributable to physical velocity offsets between\nspecies rather than a change in alpha. The OH alone, in which conjugate line\nprofiles guarantee that both lines originate in the same molecular gas,\nprovides a weak constraint of Delta alpha/alpha_o = (+0.51 +/- 1.26) x 10^-5 at\nz=0.2467. Higher frequency OH line detections can provide a larger lever arm on\nDelta alpha and can increase precision by an order of magnitude. The OH\nmolecule can thus provide precise measurements of the cosmic evolution of alpha\nthat include quantitative constraints on systematic errors. Application of this\ntechnique is limited only by the detectability of |tau|~0.01 OH lines toward\nradio continuum sources and may be possible to z~5. \n\n"}
