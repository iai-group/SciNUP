The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance.

For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors).

The time-dependent solutions of this equation is crucial to the\nestimation of the effect of the Wouthuysen-Field (WF) coupling in relation to\nthe 21 cm emission and absorption at the epoch of reionization. The resonant\nscattering leads to the photon distribution in the frequency space to be\npiecewise smooth containing sharp changes. The weighted essentially\nnonoscillatory (WENO) scheme is suitable to handle this problem, as this\nalgorithm has been found to be highly stable and robust for solving Boltzmann\nequation. We test this numerical solver against analytic solutions of the\nevolution of the photon distribution in rest background, analytic solution in\nexpanding background without resonant scattering and formation of local\nBoltzmann distribution around the resonant frequency with the temperature same\nas that of atom for recoil. We find that evolution of photon distribution\nundergoes three phases; profile is similar to the initial one, a flat plateau\n(without recoil) or local Boltzmann distribution (with recoil) forms around the\nresonant frequency, and finally the distribution around the resonant frequency\nis saturated when the photons from the source is balanced by the redshift of\nthe expansion. This result indicates that the onset of the W-F coupling should\nnot be determined by the third phase, but by the time scale of the second\nphase.

Roughly half\nthe data was taken through the Keck iodine cell which contains thousands of\nwell calibrated iodine lines. Using these iodine exposures to calibrate the\nnormal Th-Ar Keck data pipeline output we found absolute wavelength offsets of\n500 m/s to 1000 m/s with drifts of more than 500 m/s over a single night, and\ndrifts of nearly 2000 m/s over several nights. These offsets correspond to an\nabsolute redshift of uncertainty of about Delta z=10^{-5} (Delta lambda= 0.02\nAng), with daily drifts of around Delta z=5x10^{-6} (Delta lambda =0.01 Ang),\nand multiday drifts of nearly Delta z=2x10^{-5} (0.04 Ang).

The detection rate of Class I 44 GHz methanol\nmasers, which trace molecular outflows, is ~89% towards EGOs associated with\n6.7 GHz methanol masers. The two types of methanol masers exhibit different\nspatial distributions: 6.7 GHz masers are centrally concentrated and usually\ncoincide with 24 micron emission, while 44 GHz masers are widely distributed\nand generally trace diffuse 4.5 micron features. We also present results of a\ncomplementary James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) single-pointing molecular\nline survey of EGOs in the outflow tracers HCO+(3-2) and SiO(5-4).

The maps were made in the two\nfields originally targeted at 0.85mm with SCUBA in the SHADES project, namely\nthe Lockman Hole East (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mJy rms) and the Subaru XMM\nDeep Field (1.0-1.7 mJy rms). The wealth of existing and forthcoming deep\nmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm source\npopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequent\npapers.

We\nuse a large Monte Carlo library of SFHs to study as a function of galaxy\nspectral type and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) the statistical uncertainties of\nM/L values using either absorption-line data or broad band colors. The accuracy\nof M/L estimates can be significantly improved by using metal-sensitive indices\nin combination with age-sensitive indices, in particular for galaxies with\nintermediate-age or young stellar populations. While M/L accuracy clearly\ndepends on the spectral S/N ratio, there is no significant gain in improving\nthe S/N much above 50/pix and limiting uncertainties of 0.03 dex are reached.\nAssuming that dust is accurately corrected or absent and that the redshift is\nknown, color-based M/L estimates are only slightly more uncertain than\nspectroscopic estimates (at comparable spectroscopic and photometric quality),\nbut are more easily affected by systematic biases.

A bolometric interferometer will have to take\nadvantage of the wide spectral detection band of its bolometers in order to be\ncompetitive with imaging experiments. A crucial concern is that interferometers\nare presumed to be importantly affected by a spoiling effect known as bandwidth\nsmearing. In this paper, we investigate how the bandwidth modifies the work\nprinciple of a bolometric interferometer and how it affects its sensitivity to\nthe CMB angular power spectra. We obtain analytical expressions for the\nbroadband visibilities measured by broadband heterodyne and bolometric\ninterferometers.

We simulate full-polarization (sub)millimeter\nVLBI data of Sgr A* using a hot-spot model that is embedded within an accretion\ndisk, with emphasis on nonimaging polarimetric data products that are robust\nagainst calibration errors. Although the source-integrated linear polarization\nfraction in the models is typically only a few percent, the linear polarization\nfraction on small angular scales can be much higher, enabling the detection of\nchanges in the polarimetric structure of Sgr A* on a wide variety of baselines.\nThe shortest baselines track the source-integrated linear polarization\nfraction, while longer baselines are sensitive to polarization substructures\nthat are beam-diluted by connected-element interferometry.

We study a toy model where the flow behind a planar\nstationary accretion shock is adiabatically decelerated by an external\npotential. Two magnetic field geometries are considered: parallel or\nperpendicular to the shock. The entropy-vorticity wave, which is simply\nadvected in the unmagnetized limit, separates into five different waves: the\nentropy perturbations are advected, while the vorticity can propagate along the\nfield lines through two Alfven waves and two slow magnetosonic waves. The two\ncycles existing in the unmagnetized limit, advective-acoustic and purely\nacoustic, are replaced by up to six distinct MHD cycles. The phase differences\namong the cycles play an important role in determining the total cycle\nefficiency and hence the growth rate. Oscillations in the growth rate as a\nfunction of the magnetic field strength are due to this varying phase shift. A\nvertical magnetic field hardly affects the cycle efficiency in the regime of\nsuper-Alfvenic accretion that is considered. In contrast, we find that a\nhorizontal magnetic field strongly increases the efficiencies of the vorticity\ncycles that bend the field lines, resulting in a significant increase of the\ngrowth rate if the different cycles are in phase. These magnetic effects are\nsignificant for large-scale modes if the Alfven velocity is a sizable fraction\nof the flow velocity. \n\n"}

Previous results show a high level of stellar activity, with\nthe presence of prominence-like structures, spots on the surface and strong\nflare events, despite the moderate rotational velocity of the star. In\naddition, radial velocity variations with a semi-amplitude of up to 1 km/s were\ndetected. We investigated the nature of these radial velocity variations, in\norder to determine whether they are due to stellar activity or the reflex\nmotion of the star induced by a companion. We have analysed high-resolution\nechelle spectra and also two-band photometry was obtained to produce the light\ncurve and determine the photometric period. Based upon the analysis of the\nbisector velocity span, as well as spectroscopic indices of chromospheric\nindicators and taking into account the photometric analysis, we report that the\nbest explanation for the RV variation is the presence of a sub-stellar\ncompanion. The Keplerian fit of the RV data yields a solution for a close-in\nmassive planet with an orbital period of 7.78 days.

In this paper, we present a self-consistent spectral\nanalysis of the pulsating star RR Lyr, which is the primary target for our\nstudy of the Blazhko effect. We used high-resolution and high signal-to-noise\nratio spectra to carry out a consistent parameter determination and abundance\nanalysis for RR Lyr.

Stellar\npulsation attains high amplitudes in RR Lyrae stars, and as a consequence the\nstellar parameters vary significantly over the pulsation cycle.

Its very soft\nspectrum is well fit with a non local thermodynamical equilibrium model\natmosphere composed of H, He, C, N, and O, with abundances equal to those\ninferred from studies of its nebular lines. The derived effective temperature\nof 1.5x10^5 K is in good agreement with that found from the optical/UV data.\nThe unabsorbed flux in the 0.1-0.5 keV range is about 3x10^{-11} erg cm^-2\ns^-1, corresponding to a luminosity of 1.2x10^37 erg/s at the distance of 60\nkpc. We also searched for X-ray emission from a large number of SMC planetary\nnebulae, confirming the previous detection of SMP SMC 25 with a luminosity of\n(0.2-6)x10^35 erg/s (0.1-1 keV).

RADAMESH uses a novel Monte Carlo approach to sample the radiation\nfield within the computational domain on a \"cell-by-cell\" basis. Thanks to this\nalgorithm, the computational efforts are now focused where actually needed,\ni.e. within the Ionization-fronts (I-fronts). This results in an increased\naccuracy level and, at the same time, a huge gain in computational speed with\nrespect to a \"classical\" Monte Carlo RT, especially when combined with an\nAdaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) scheme. Among several new features, RADAMESH is\nable to adaptively refine the computational mesh in correspondence of the\nI-fronts, allowing to fully resolve them within large, cosmological boxes.

The giant exoplanets are cloud-free at\n0.8 AU, have H2O clouds at 2 AU, and have both NH3 and H2O clouds at 5 AU and\n10 AU. For each model planet we compute moderate resolution spectra as a\nfunction of phase. The presence and structure of clouds strongly influence the\nspectra.

Given a cosmological background model, a power spectrum of\nfluctuations as well as a Gaussian linear density contrast field $\\delta_{\\rm\nl}$ is generated on a cubic grid, which is then smoothed repeatedly with\nGaussian filters. For each Lagrangian particle at position $\\bmath{q}$ and each\nsmoothing radius $R$, the collapse time, the velocities and ellipsoidal\ntruncation are computed using Lagrangian Perturbation Theory. The collapsed\nmedium is then fragmented into isolated objects by an algorithm designed to\nmimic the accretion and merger events of hierarchical collapse.

Model and analysis Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is commonly considered as a mechanism of solar\n(eruptive) flares. A deeper study of this scenario reveals, however, a number\nof open issues. Among them is the fundamental question, how the magnetic energy\nis transferred from large, accumulation scales to plasma scales where its\nactual dissipation takes place. In order to investigate this transfer over a\nbroad range of scales we address this question by means of a high-resolution\nMHD simulation. The simulation results indicate that the magnetic-energy\ntransfer to small scales is realized via a cascade of consecutive smaller and\nsmaller flux-ropes (plasmoids), in analogy with the vortex-tube cascade in\n(incompressible) fluid dynamics. Both tearing and (driven) \"fragmenting\ncoalescence\" processes are equally important for the consecutive fragmentation\nof the magnetic field (and associated current density) to smaller elements. At\nthe later stages a dynamic balance between tearing and coalescence processes\nreveals a steady (power-law) scaling typical for cascading processes. It is\nshown that cascading reconnection also addresses other open issues in solar\nflare research such as the duality between the regular large-scale picture of\n(eruptive) flares and the observed signatures of fragmented (chaotic) energy\nrelease, as well as the huge number of accelerated particles. Indeed,\nspontaneous current-layer fragmentation and formation of multiple channelised\ndissipative/acceleration regions embedded in the current layer appears to be\nintrinsic to the cascading process. The multiple small-scale current sheets may\nalso facilitate the acceleration of a large number of particles. The structure,\ndistribution and dynamics of the embedded potential acceleration regions in a\ncurrent layer fragmented by cascading reconnection are studied and discussed. \n\n"}

However, there is\nevidence that the special case when the ambient manifold is R^3, or more\ngenerally when the second homology is trivial, should be considerably more\ntractable.

Abstract: In this article we propose a novel test for statistical anisotropy of the\nCMB. The test is based on the fact, that the Galactic foregrounds have a\nremarcably strong symmetry with respect to their antipodal points and with\nrespect to the Galactic plane, while the cosmological signal should not be\nsymmetric or asymmetric under these transitions. We have applied the test for\nthe octupole component of the WMAP ILC 7 map, by looking at a_3,1 and a_3,3,\nand their ratio to a_3,2 both for real and imaginary values. We find abnormal\nsymmetry of the octupole component at the level of 0.58%, compared to Monte\nCarlo simulations. By using the analysis of the phases of the octupole we found\nremarkably strong cross-correlations between the phases of kinematic dipole and\nILC 7 octupole, in full agreement with previous results. We further test the\nmultipole range 2<l<100, by investigating the ratio between the l+m=even and\nl+m=odd parts of power spectra. We compare the results to simulations of a\nGaussian random sky, and find significant departure from the statistically\nisotropic and homogeneous case, for a very broad range of multipoles. We found\nthat for the most prominent peaks of our estimator, the phases of the\ncorresponding harmonics are coherent with phases of the octupole.

Abstract: Before it becomes a sensitive probe of the Epoch of Reionization, the Dark\nAges, and fundamental physics, 21 cm tomography must successfully contend with\nthe issue of foreground contamination. Broadband foreground sources are\nexpected to be roughly four orders of magnitude larger than any cosmological\nsignals, so precise foreground models will be necessary. Such foreground models\noften contain a large number of parameters, reflecting the complicated physics\nthat governs foreground sources. In this paper, we concentrate on spectral\nmodeling (neglecting, for instance, bright point source removal from spatial\nmaps) and show that 21 cm tomography experiments will likely not be able to\nmeasure these parameters without large degeneracies, simply because the\nforeground spectra are so featureless and generic. However, we show that this\nis also an advantage, because it means that the foregrounds can be\ncharacterized to a high degree of accuracy once a small number of parameters\n(likely three or four, depending on one's instrumental specifications) are\nmeasured. This provides a simple understanding for why 21 cm foreground\nsubtraction schemes are able to remove most of the contaminants by suppressing\njust a small handful of simple spectral forms. In addition, this suggests that\nthe foreground modeling process should be relatively simple and will likely not\nbe an impediment to the foreground subtraction schemes that are necessary for a\nsuccessful 21 cm tomography experiment. \n\n"}

It is well known that the\nstate of cold matter at supra-nuclear density depends on the non-perturbative\nnature of quantum chromo-dynamics (QCD) and is essential for modeling pulsars.\nA so-called H-cluster matter is proposed in this paper as the nature of dense\nmatter in reality.\n  In compact stars at only a few nuclear densities but low temperature, quarks\ncould be interacting strongly with each other there. That might render quarks\ngrouped in clusters, although the hypothetical quark-clusters in cold dense\nmatter has not been confirmed due to the lack of both theoretical and\nexperimental evidence. Motivated by recent lattice QCD simulations of the\nH-dibaryons (with structure uuddss), we are therefore considering here a\npossible kind of quark-clusters, H-clusters, that could emerge inside compact\nstars during their initial cooling, as the dominant components inside (the\ndegree of freedom could then be H-clusters there).Taking into account the\nin-medium stiffening effect, we find that at baryon densities of compact stars\n$H$-cluster matter could be more stable than nuclear matter. We also find that\nfor the H-cluster matter with lattice structure, the equation of state could be\nso stiff that it would seem to be \"superluminal\" in most dense region.

Computation\nof various magnetic parameters such as magnetic energy, gradient of twist of\nsunspot fields and any kind of extrapolations, heavily hinge on the force-free\napproximation of the photospheric sunspot magnetic fields. Thus it is important\nto inspect the force-freeness of sunspot fields. The force-freeness of sunspot\nmagnetic fields has been examined earlier by some researchers ending with\nincoherent results. Accurate photospheric vector field measurements with high\nspatial resolution are required to inspect the force-free nature of sunspots.\nWe use several such vector magnetograms obtained from the Solar Optical\nTelescope/Spectro-Polarimeter aboard the Hinode. Both necessary and sufficient\nconditions for force-freeness are examined by checking global and local nature\nof magnetic forces over sunspots. We find that the sunspot magnetic fields are\nnot much away from force-free configuration, although they are not completely\nforce-free on the photosphere.

For applications which need to consider\nboth chromospheric and coronal models, the chromosphere-corona boundary, where\nthese functions have different values as well as gradients, can lead to\nnumerical problems. We encountered this problem in context of ray tracing\nthrough the corona at low radio frequencies, as a part of effort to prepare for\nthe analysis of solar images from new generation radio arrays like the\nMurchison Widefield Array (MWA), Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and Long\nWavelength Array (LWA). We have developed a solution to this problem by using a\n{\\em patch} function, a thin layer between the chromosphere and the corona\nwhich matches the values and gradients of the two regions at their respective\ninterfaces. We describe the method we have developed for defining this patch\nfunction to seamlessly \"stitch\" chromospheric and coronal electron density\ndistributions, and generalize the approach to work for any arbitrary\ndistributions of different dimensionality. We show that the complexity of the\npatch function is independent of the stitched functions dimensionalities. It\nalways has eight parameters (even four for univariate functions) and they may\nbe found without linear system solution for every point. The developed method\ncan potentially be useful for other applications. \n\n"}

Evolving A enables one\nto use any interpolation scheme on refinement level boundaries and still\nguarantee that the magnetic field remains divergenceless. As in classical EM, a\ngauge choice must be made when evolving A, and we chose a straightforward\n\"algebraic\" gauge condition to simplify the A evolution equation. However,\nmagnetized black hole-neutron star (BHNS) simulations in this gauge exhibit\nunphysical behavior, including the spurious appearance of strong magnetic\nfields on refinement level boundaries. This spurious behavior is exacerbated\nwhen matter crosses refinement boundaries during tidal disruption of the NS.\nApplying Kreiss-Oliger dissipation to the evolution of the magnetic vector\npotential A slightly weakens this spurious magnetic effect, but with undesired\nconsequences. We demonstrate via an eigenvalue analysis and a numerical study\nthat zero-speed modes in the algebraic gauge, coupled with the frequency\nfiltering that occurs on refinement level boundaries, are responsible for the\ncreation of spurious magnetic fields. We show that the EM Lorenz gauge exhibits\nno zero-speed modes, and as a consequence, spurious magnetic effects are\nquickly propagated away, allowing for long-term, stable magnetized BHNS\nevolutions. Our study demonstrates how the EM gauge degree of freedom can be\nchosen to one's advantage, and that for magnetized BHNS simulations the Lorenz\ngauge constitutes a major improvement over the algebraic gauge. \n\n"}

We analyse dense stellar fields imaged\nat the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope to quantify the degree of high spatial\nfrequency variation in ground-based imaging Point Spread Functions and compare\nour results to models of atmospheric turbulence.

We find that more than half of these transients are due to rare\ndata artifacts. The remaining sources have lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nthan initially reported by 1 to 1.5-sigma.

Previous work has shown that the thermal wind\nequation together with informal arguments on the nature of convection in a\nrotating fluid could be used to deduce the shape of the isorotation surfaces in\nthe bulk of the SCZ with great fidelity, and that the tachocline contours could\nalso be described by relatively simple phenomenology. In this paper, we show\nthat the form of these surfaces can be understood more broadly as a\nmathematical consequence of the thermal wind equation and a narrow convective\nshell. The analysis does not yield the angular velocity function directly, an\nadditional surface boundary condition is required. But much can already be\ndeduced without constructing the entire rotation profile. The mathematics may\nbe combined with dynamical arguments put forth in previous works to the mutual\nbenefit of each. An important element of our approach is to regard the constant\nangular velocity surfaces as an independent coordinate variable for what is\ntermed the \"residual entropy,\" a quantity that plays a key role in the equation\nof thermal wind balance. The difference between the dynamics of the bulk of the\nSCZ and the tachocline is due to a different functional form of the residual\nentropy in each region. We develop a unified theory for the rotational behavior\nof both the SCZ and the tachocline, using the solutions for the characteristics\nof the thermal wind equation. These characteristics are identical to the\nisorotation contours in the bulk of the SCZ, but the two deviate in the\ntachocline.

A comparison of the\ntime-resolved spectroscopic measurements during bursts from the two epochs\nshows that the normalisation evolves consistently through the burst rise and\npeak, but subsequently increases further in the earlier epoch bursts.

As an application, we consider the\neffectiveness of the BzK colour selection technique, which was designed to\nisolate galaxies in the redshift interval 1.4<z<2.5. The mock catalogue is in\nreasonable agreement with the observed number counts of all BzK galaxies, as\nwell as with the observed counts of the subsample of BzKs that are star-forming\ngalaxies. We predict that over 75 per cent of the model galaxies with\nK_{AB}<=23, and 1.4<z<2.5, are selected by the BzK technique.

To track these\ninteractions we have conducted a suite of high-resolution (1500^3 effective) 3D\nsimulations that follow the evolution of individual clumps as they move into\nmolecular gas. Even at these high resolutions, our simulations do not quite\nachieve numerical convergence, due to the challenge of properly resolving the\nsmall-scale mixing of ejecta and molecular gas, although they do allow some\nrobust conclusions to be drawn. Isotropically exploding ejecta do not penetrate\ninto the molecular cloud, but, if cooling is properly accounted for, clumpy\nejecta penetrate to distances ~10^18 cm and mix effectively with star-forming\nmolecular gas.

The basic idea is to map out the likelihood\ngrid-cell by grid-cell according to decreasing likelihood, and stop when a\ncertain threshold has been reached. This approach improves vastly on the \"curse\nof dimensionality\" problem plaguing standard grid-based parameter estimation\nsimply by disregarding grid-cells with negligible likelihood. The main\nadvantages of this method compared to standard Metropolis-Hastings MCMC methods\ninclude 1) trivial extraction of arbitrary conditional distributions; 2) direct\naccess to Bayesian evidences; 3) better sampling of the tails of the\ndistribution; and 4) nearly perfect parallelization scaling. The main\ndisadvantage is, as in the case of brute-force grid-based evaluation, a\ndependency on the number of parameters, N_par. One of the main goals of the\npresent paper is to determine how large N_par can be, while still maintaining\nreasonable computational efficiency; we find that N_par = 12$ is well within\nthe capabilities of the method. The performance of the code is tested by\ncomparing cosmological parameters estimated using Snake and the WMAP-7 data\nwith those obtained using CosmoMC, the current standard code in the field. We\nfind fully consistent results, with similar computational expenses, but shorter\nwall time due to the perfect parallelization scheme. \n\n"}

{"id": "1211.6515", "contents": "Title: SZ effect or Not? - Detecting most galaxy clusters' main foreground\n  effect Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the most massive objects in the Universe and comprise a\nhigh-temperature intracluster medium of about 10^7 K, believed to offer a main\nforeground effect for cosmic microwave background (CMB) data in the form of the\nthermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. This assumption has been confirmed by\nSZ signal detection in hundreds of clusters but, in comparison with the huge\nnumbers of clusters within optically selected samples from Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) data, this only accounts for a few per cent of clusters. Here we\nintroduce a model-independent new method to confirm the assumption that most\ngalaxy clusters can offer the thermal SZ signal as their main foreground\neffect. For the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) seven-year data\n(and a given galaxy cluster sample), we introduced a parameter d1 as the\nnearest-neighbour cluster angular distance of each pixel, then we classified\ndata pixels as 'to be' (d1--> 0 case) or 'not to be' (d1 large enough) affected\nby the sample clusters. By comparing the statistical results of these two kinds\nof pixels, we can see how the sample clusters affect the CMB data directly. We\nfind that the Planck Early Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (ESZ) sample and X-ray samples\n(~10^2 clusters) can lead to obvious temperature depression in the WMAP\nseven-year data, which confirms the SZ effect prediction. However, each\noptically selected sample (>10^4 clusters) shows an opposite result: the mean\ntemperature rises to about 10uK. This unexpected qualitative scenario implies\nthat the main foreground effect of most clusters is $not$ always the expected\nSZ effect. This may be the reason why the SZ signal detection result is lower\nthan expected from the model. \n\n"}

Our method explicitly\nlinks a network's capacity to permit a particular class of steady states,\ncalled toric steady states, to topological properties of a related network\ncalled a translated chemical reaction network. These networks share their\nreaction stoichiometries with their source network but are permitted to have\ndifferent complex stoichiometries and different network topologies.

To investigate the fine-scale structure of these filaments, we\nperform a depth-dependent inversion of spectropolarimetric data of a sunspot\nvery close to solar disk center obtained by Hinode (SOT/SP). We have used a\nrecently developed spatially coupled 2D inversion scheme which allows us to\nanalyze the fine structure of individual penumbral filaments up to the\ndiffraction limit of the telescope. Filaments of different sizes in all parts\nof penumbra display very similar magnetic field strengths, inclinations and\nvelocity patterns. The similarities allowed us to average all these filaments\nand to extract the physical properties common to all of them. This average\nfilament shows upflows associated with an upward pointing field at its inner,\numbral end and along its axis, downflows along the lateral edge and strong\ndownflows in the outer end associated with a nearly vertical, strong and\ndownward pointing field. The upflowing plasma is significantly hotter than the\ndownflowing plasma. The hot, tear-shaped head of the averaged filament can be\nassociated with a penumbral grain.

We present maps of\ntemperature, E- and B-mode polarization, and their associated angular power\nspectra. The improvement in the map noise level and polarization spectra error\nbars are consistent with the 52% increase in integration time relative to\nChiang et al. (2010).

Assuming\nthat these emissions are caused by magnetic cycles similar to the sunspot\ncycle, we construct flux transport dynamo models of $1M_{\\odot}$ stars rotating\nwith different rotation periods. We first compute the differential rotation and\nthe meridional circulation inside these stars from a mean-field hydrodynamics\nmodel.

To keep analyticity as far as possible to dispense with numerically\nexpensive sampling techniques a saddle-point approximation is introduced, whose\nprecision is validated for a numerical toy example. The mathematical\nformulation is done in a generic way so that the approach remains applicable to\ncosmic microwave background data as well as to large scale structure data.\nAdditionally, we review a few currently interesting inflation models and\npresent numerical toy examples thereof in two and three dimensions to\ndemonstrate the efficiency of the higher-order statistics method. A second\nquantity of interest is the primordial power spectrum.

This paper\nis a sequel to a previous paper that established a rigorous mathematical\nframework for describing the foreground wedge and the EoR window. Here, we use\nour framework to explore statistical methods by which the EoR window can be\nenlarged, thereby increasing the sensitivity of a power spectrum measurement.\nWe adapt the FKP approximation (commonly used in galaxy surveys) for 21 cm\ncosmology, and also compare the optimal quadratic estimator to simpler\nestimators that ignore covariances between different Fourier modes.

Multiple red giant branches\n(RGBs), subgiant branches (SGBs), and even main sequences (MSs) have now been\nobserved photometrically in many GCs. UV photometry has been crucial in\ndiscovering and analyzing these MPs, but the Johnson U and the Stromgren and\nSloan u filters that have generally been used are relatively inefficient and\nvery sensitive to reddening and atmospheric extinction. In contrast, the\nWashington C filter is much broader and redder than these competing UV filters.\nHere we investigate the use of the Washington system to uncover MPs using only\na 1-meter telescope. Our analysis of the well-studied GC NGC 1851 finds that\nthe C filter is both very efficient and effective at detecting its previously\ndiscovered MPs in the RGB and SGB. Remarkably, we have also detected an\nintrinsically broad MS best characterized by two distinct but heavily\noverlapping populations that cannot be explained by binaries, field stars, or\nphotometric errors. The MS distribution is in very good agreement with that\nseen on the RGB, with ~30% of the stars belonging to the second population.\nThere is also evidence for two sequences in the red horizontal branch, but this\nappears to be unrelated to the MPs in this cluster. Neither of these latter\nphenomena have been observed previously in this cluster. The redder MS stars\nare also more centrally concentrated than the blue MS. This is the first time\nMPs in a MS have been discovered from the ground, and using only a 1-meter\ntelescope. The Washington system thus proves to be a very powerful tool for\ninvestigating MPs, and holds particular promise for extragalactic objects where\nphotons are limited. \n\n"}

The X-ray spectrum is well described by an\nabsorbed power law, which is softer than the previous quiescent epoch (up to\n2013 June).

After removing residual dipoles and\ngalactic foregrounds, the residual difference maps exhibit a quadrupole and\nother large-scale systematic structure. We identify this structure as possibly\noriginating from Planck's beam sidelobe pick-up, but note that it appears to\nhave insignificant cosmological impact. We develop an extension of the internal\nlinear combination technique and find features that plausibly originate in the\nPlanck data.

This paper only contains announcements and a few\nsketches of proofs; a forthcoming series of papers will present the proofs in\ndetails.\n  The two prototypical examples of non-hyperbolic dynamics are homoclinic\ntangencies and heterodimensional cycles. Palis conjectured that they actually\ncharacterize densely non-hyperbolic dynamics. It is therefore important to\nunderstand what happens close to those bifurcations. We generalize classical\nresults of Newhouse, Palis and Viana, for both tangencies and cycles: close to\na homoclinic tangency or to a heterodimensional cycle there is abundance of\ndiffeomorphisms exhibiting infinitely many sinks or sources if and only if the\ndynamics is not volume-hyperbolic. This proves in particular a conjecture of\nTuraev for homoclinic tangencies.\n  An important result of Bonatti, Diaz, Pujals states that if a homoclinic\nclass is $C^1$-robustly without dominated splitting, then nearby\ndiffeomorphisms exhibit $C^1$-generically infinitely many sinks or sources.

The diffusion of\nneutrinos trapped in the PNS induces a transport of momentum, which can be\nmodelled as a viscosity on length-scales longer than the neutrino mean free\npath. This neutrino-viscosity can slow down the growth of MRI modes to such an\nextent that a minimum initial magnetic field strength of $\\gtrsim 10^{12}\\,\n{\\rm G}$ is needed for the MRI to grow on a sufficiently short time-scale to\npotentially affect the explosion.

Here we add a mechanism for emulating the effect of\na full bias matrix to the Planck likelihood code through the parameter\nestimation code SCoPE. We show that if the angular power spectrum was measured\nwith a non-circular beam, the assumption of circular Gaussian beam or\nconsidering only the diagonal part of the bias matrix can lead to huge error in\nparameter estimation. We demonstrate that, at least for elliptical Gaussian\nbeams, use of scalar beam window functions obtained via Monte Carlo simulations\nstarting from a fiducial spectrum, as implemented in Planck analyses for\nexample, leads to em only few percent of sigma deviation of the best-fit\nparameters. However, we notice more significant differences in the posterior\ndistributions for some of the parameters, which would in turn lead to incorrect\nerrorbars.

We show that under the specific threshold where the\ndisease-free state is a globally stable fixed point of both the linear and\nnonlinear models, the exact underlying Markov chain has an $O(\\log n)$ mixing\ntime, which means the epidemic dies out quickly. In fact, the epidemic\neradication condition coincides for all the three models. Furthermore, when the\nthreshold condition is violated, which indicates that the linear model is not\nstable, we show that there exists a unique second fixed point for the nonlinear\nmodel, which corresponds to the endemic state.

Our results indicate that\nimmunization improves the threshold of epidemic eradication. Furthermore, the\ncommon threshold for fast-mixing of the Markov chain and global stability of\nthe disease-free fixed point improves by the same factor for the\nvaccination-dominant model. \n\n"}

The\n  first evidence of an extended main sequence turn-off in a young cluster:\n  NGC1856 Abstract: Recent studies have shown that the extended main-sequence turn off (eMSTO) is\na common feature of intermediate-age star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds\n(MCs). The most simple explanation is that these stellar systems harbor\nmultiple generations of stars with an age difference of a few hundred Myrs.\n  However, while an eMSTO has been detected in a large number of clusters with\nages between ~1-2 Gyrs, several studies of young clusters in both MCs and in\nnearby galaxies do not find any evidence for a prolonged star-formation\nhistory, i.e. for multiple stellar generations. These results have suggested\nalternative interpretation of the eMSTOs observed in intermediate-age star\nclusters. The eMSTO could be due to stellar rotation mimicking an age spread or\nto interacting binaries. In these scenarios, intermediate-age MC clusters would\nbe simple stellar populations, in close analogy with younger clusters.\n  Here we provide the first evidence for an eMSTO in a young stellar cluster.\nWe exploit multi-band Hubble Space Telescope photometry to study the ~300-Myr\nold star cluster NGC1856 in the Large Magellanic Cloud and detected a broadened\nMSTO that is consistent with a prolonged star-formation which had a duration of\nabout 150 Myrs. Below the turn-off, the MS of NGC1856 is split into a red and\nblue component, hosting 33+/-5% and 67+/-5% of the total number of MS stars,\nrespectively. We discuss these findings in the context of\nmultiple-stellar-generation, stellar-rotation, and interacting-binary\nhypotheses. \n\n"}

Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods.

It has been\nproposed that magnetic activity is responsible for radius inflation. By\nestimating the radii of low-mass stars in three young clusters (NGC 2264, NGC\n2547, NGC 2516, with ages of 5, 35 and 140 Myr respectively), we aim to\nestablish whether similar radius inflation is seen in single, magnetically\nactive stars. We use radial velocities from the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) and\npublished photometry to establish cluster membership and combine GES\nmeasurements of vsini with published rotation periods to estimate average radii\nfor groups of fast-rotating cluster members as a function of their luminosity\nand age. The average radii are compared with the predictions of both standard\nevolutionary models and variants that include magnetic inhibition of convection\nand starspots. At a given luminosity, the stellar radii in NGC 2516 and NGC\n2547 are larger than predicted by standard evolutionary models at the ages of\nthese clusters. The discrepancy is least pronounced and not significant ~10\npercent) in ZAMS stars with radiative cores, but more significant in\nlower-mass, fully convective pre main-sequence cluster members, reaching\n30+/-10 percent. The uncertain age and distance of NGC 2264 preclude a reliable\ndetermination of any discrepancy for its members. The median radii we have\nestimated for low-mass fully convective stars in the older clusters are\ninconsistent (at the 2-3 sigma level) with non-magnetic evolutionary models and\nmore consistent with models that incorporate the effects of magnetic fields or\ndark starspots. The available models suggest this requires either surface\nmagnetic fields exceeding 2.5 kG, spots that block about 30 per cent of the\nphotospheric flux, or a more moderate combination of both.

Our assessments are based on the\ntotal signal-to-noise of the recovered shear power spectra, a metric that we\nfind to correlate very well with a standard dark energy figure of merit. We\nfirst consider the choice of frequency band, trading off increases in number\ncounts at lower frequencies against poorer resolution; our analysis strongly\nprefers the higher frequency Band 2 (950-1760 MHz) channel of the SKA-MID\ntelescope to the lower frequency Band 1 (350-1050 MHz). Best results would be\nobtained by allowing the centre of Band 2 to shift towards lower frequency,\naround 1.1 GHz. We then move on to consider survey size, finding that an area\nof 5,000 square degrees is optimal for most SKA1 instrumental configurations.\nFinally, we forecast the performance of a weak lensing survey with the second\ndeployment of the SKA. The increased survey size (3$\\pi$\\,steradian) and\nsensitivity improves both the signal-to-noise and the dark energy metrics by\ntwo orders of magnitude. \n\n"}

Three\nhours of observations were conducted over two nights with significantly\ndifferent levels of ionospheric activity.

We focus on three main classes of systematics: (i) experimental\nsystematic errors in the observed shear; (ii) signal contamination by intrinsic\nalignments; and (iii) systematic effects due to an incorrect modelling of\nnon-linear scales. First, we show that a comprehensive, multi-wavelength\nanalysis provides a self-calibration method for experimental systematic\neffects, only implying <50% increment on the errors on cosmological parameters.\nWe also illustrate how the cross-correlation between radio and optical/near-IR\nsurveys alone is able to remove residual systematics with variance as large as\n0.00001, i.e. the same order of magnitude of the cosmological signal. This also\nopens the possibility of using such a cross-correlation as a means to detect\nunknown experimental systematics. Secondly, we demonstrate that, thanks to\npolarisation information, radio weak lensing surveys will be able to mitigate\ncontamination by intrinsic alignments, in a way similar but fully complementary\nto available self-calibration methods based on position-shear correlations.\nLastly, we illustrate how radio weak lensing experiments, reaching higher\nredshifts than those accessible to optical surveys, will probe dark energy and\nthe growth of cosmic structures in regimes less contaminated by non-linearities\nin the matter perturbations. For instance, the higher-redshift bins of radio\ncatalogues peak at z~0.8-1, whereas their optical/near-IR counterparts are\nlimited to z<0.5-0.7.

We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide\nillustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion\nof the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1\nconsists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,\nparallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars\nin common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric\ndata set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The\nsecond component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band\nmagnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the\ntypical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas.

Although solving\nthe time-dependent equations is necessary for accurate abundances and\ntemperature in the dynamic ISM, a full chemical network is too computationally\nexpensive to incorporate in numerical simulations. In this paper, we propose a\nnew simplified chemical network for hydrogen and carbon chemistry in the atomic\nand molecular ISM. We compare results from our chemical network in detail with\nresults from a full photo-dissociation region (PDR) code, and also with the\nNelson & Langer (1999) (NL99) network previously adopted in the simulation\nliterature. We show that our chemical network gives similar results to the PDR\ncode in the equilibrium abundances of all species over a wide range of\ndensities, temperature, and metallicities, whereas the NL99 network shows\nsignificant disagreement. Applying our network in 1D models, we find that the\n$\\mathrm{CO}$-dominated regime delimits the coldest gas and that the\ncorresponding temperature tracks the cosmic ray ionization rate in molecular\nclouds.

On one hand, it is known that oriented 3d TFTs having a topological\nboundary condition admit a state-sum construction known as the Turaev-Viro\nconstruction. This is related to the string-net construction of fermionic\nphases of matter. We show how Turaev-Viro construction can be generalized to\nunoriented 3d TFTs. On the other hand, it is known that the \"fermionic\"\nversions of oriented TFTs, known as Spin-TFTs, can be constructed in terms of\n\"shadow\" TFTs which are ordinary oriented TFTs with an anomalous $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n1-form symmetry. We generalize this correspondence to Pin$^+$-TFTs by showing\nthat they can be constructed in terms of ordinary unoriented TFTs with\nanomalous $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ 1-form symmetry having a mixed anomaly with\ntime-reversal symmetry. The corresponding Pin$^+$-TFT does not have any anomaly\nfor time-reversal symmetry however and hence it can be unambiguously defined on\na non-orientable manifold.

We show that this segregated hybrid\nstructure becomes unstable to rapid mixing within 2,000 years of the onset of\nWD cooling. Carbon burning includes a weak reaction that removes electrons,\nresulting in a lower electron-to-baryon ratio ($Y_{\\rm e}$) in the regions\nprocessed by carbon burning compared to the unburned C/O core, making the O/Ne\nmantle denser than the C/O core as the WD cools. This is unstable to efficient\nmixing. We use the results of $\\texttt{MESA}$ models with different size C/O\ncores to quantify the rate at which the cores mix with the mantle as they cool.\nIn all cases, we find that the WDs undergo significant core/mantle mixing on\ntimescales shorter than the time available to grow the WD to the Chandrasekhar\nmass ($M_{\\rm Ch}$) by accretion. As a result, hybrid WDs that reach $M_{\\rm\nCh}$ due to later accretion will have lower central carbon fractions than\nassumed thus far.

{"id": "1612.00008", "contents": "Title: Constructing stable 3D hydrodynamical models of giant stars Abstract: Hydrodynamical simulations of stellar interactions require stable models of\nstars as initial conditions. Such initial models, however, are difficult to\nconstruct for giant stars because of the wide range in spatial scales of the\nhydrostatic equilibrium and in dynamical timescales between the core and the\nenvelope of the giant. They are needed for, e.g., modeling the common envelope\nphase where a giant envelope encompasses both the giant core and a companion\nstar. Here, we present a new method of approximating and reconstructing giant\nprofiles from a stellar evolution code to produce stable models for\nmulti-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We determine typical stellar\nstratification profiles with the 1D stellar evolution code MESA. After an\nappropriate mapping, hydrodynamical simulations are conducted using the\nmoving-mesh code AREPO. The giant profiles are approximated by replacing the\ncore of the giant with a point mass and by constructing a suitable continuation\nof the profile to the center. Different reconstruction methods are tested that\ncan specifically control the convective behaviour of the model. After mapping\nto a grid, a relaxation procedure that includes damping of spurious velocities\nyields stable models in three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. Initially\nconvectively stable configurations lead to stable hydrodynamical models while\nfor stratifications that are convectively unstable in the stellar evolution\ncode, simulations recover the convective behaviour of the initial model and\nshow large convective plumes with Mach numbers up to 0.8. Examples are shown\nfor a $2M_\\odot$ red giant and a $0.67M_\\odot$ asymptotic giant branch star.

The gravitational\ncollapse of a large sample of model cores in the mass range 0.1-2.0 Msun is\ninvestigated. Numerical simulations were started at the pre-stellar phase and\nterminated at the end of the embedded phase when 90% of the initial core mass\nhad been accreted onto the forming protostar plus disk system. The disk\nformation and evolution was studied using numerical hydrodynamics simulations,\nwhile the formation and evolution of the central star was calculated using a\nstellar evolution code. Three scenarios for mass accretion from the disk onto\nthe star were considered: hybrid accretion in which a fraction of accreted\nenergy absorbed by the protostar depends on the accretion rate, hot accretion\nwherein a fraction of accreted energy is constant, and cold accretion wherein\nall accretion energy is radiated away. Our conclusions on the nature of VeLLOs\ndepend crucially on the character of protostellar accretion. In the hybrid\naccretion scenario, most VeLLOs (90.6%) are expected to be the first\nhydrostatic cores (FHSCs) and only a small fraction (9.4%) are true protostars.\nIn the hot accretion scenario, all VeLLOs are FHSCs due to overly high\nphotospheric luminosity of protostars. In the cold accretion scenario, on the\ncontrary, the majority of VeLLOs belong to the Class I phase of stellar\nevolution. The reason is that the stellar photospheric luminosity, which sets\nthe floor for the total internal luminosity of a young star, is lower in cold\naccretion, thus enabling more VeLLOs in the protostellar stage. VeLLOs are\nrelatively rare objects occupying 7%-11% of the total duration of the embedded\nphase and their masses do not exceed 0.3 Msun. (abridged). \n\n"}

The graph $G$ has the\n\\emph{$f_n$-containment property} if every initial fire admits an strategy that\nprotects $f_n$ vertices at time $n$ so that the set of vertices on fire is\neventually constant.

Like these\nestablished methods, the radio signal is sensitive to the calorimetric energy\nand the position of the maximum of the electromagnetic shower component. This\nmakes antenna arrays an ideal extension for particle-detector arrays above a\nthreshold energy of about 100 PeV of the primary cosmic-ray particles. In the\nlast few years the digital radio technique for cosmic-ray air showers again\nmade significant progress, and there now is a consistent picture of the\nemission mechanisms confirmed by several measurements. Recent results by the\nantenna arrays AERA and Tunka-Rex confirm that the absolute accuracy for the\nshower energy is as good as the other detection techniques.

Here we\nperform mock-catalogue analyses to show that the estimates of $\\beta$ based on\nlocal fitting methods are reliable only at $r \\leq 15 \\;\\rm{kpc}$ with the\ncurrent sample size ($\\sim10^3$ stars at a given radius). As $r$ increases, the\nline-of-sight velocity (corrected for the Solar reflex motion) becomes\nincreasingly closer to the Galactocentric radial velocity, so that it becomes\nincreasingly more difficult to estimate tangential velocity dispersion\n$(\\sigma_\\theta, \\sigma_\\phi)$ from line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our\nresults suggest that the forthcoming Gaia data will be crucial for\nunderstanding the velocity distribution of halo stars at $r \\geq 20\\;\\rm{kpc}$. \n\n"}

After 165 years, during June of 2015, it\nerupted again showing characteristics of the Z And-type outburst. The primary\nobjective is to determine basic characteristics, the nature and type of the\n2015 outburst of AG Peg. We achieved this aim by modelling the spectral energy\ndistribution using low-resolution spectroscopy (330-750 nm), medium-resolution\nspectroscopy (420-720 nm; R=11000), and $UBVR_{\\rm C}I_{\\rm C}$ photometry\ncovering the 2015 outburst with a high cadence. Optical observations were\ncomplemented with the archival HST and FUSE spectra from the preceding\nquiescence. During the outburst, the luminosity of the hot component was in the\nrange of 2-11$\\times 10^{37}(d/0.8{\\rm kpc})^2$ erg/s. To generate the maximum\nluminosity the white dwarf (WD) had to accrete at $\\sim 3\\times 10^{-7}$\nM$_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$, which exceeds the stable-burning limit and thus led to\nblowing optically thick wind from the WD. We determined its mass-loss rate to a\nfew $\\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$. At the high temperature of the\nionising source, $1.5-2.3\\times 10^5$ K, the wind converted a fraction of the\nWD's photospheric radiation into the nebular emission that dominated the\noptical. A one order of magnitude increase of the emission measure, from a few\n$\\times 10^{59}(d/0.8 {\\rm kpc})^2$ cm$^{-3}$ during quiescence, to a few\n$\\times 10^{60}(d/0.8\\,{\\rm kpc})^2$ cm$^{-3}$ during the outburst, caused a 2\nmag brightening in the LC, which is classified as the Z And-type of the\noutburst. The very high nebular emission and the presence of a disk-like HI\nregion encompassing the WD, as indicated by a significant broadening and high\nflux of the Raman-scattered OVI 6825 \\AA\\ line during the outburst, is\nconsistent with the ionisation structure of hot components in symbiotic stars\nduring active phases. \n\n"}

The same model, in dimension\ntwo, describes another mechanical device, the hatchet planimeter.\n  Here is a sampler of our results. We express the linearized flow of the\nbicycle equation in terms of the geometry of the rear track; in dimension\nthree, for closed front and rear tracks, this is a version of the Berry phase\nformula.

{"id": "1705.09798", "contents": "Title: Universal Protocols for Information Dissemination Using Emergent Signals Abstract: We consider a population of $n$ agents which communicate with each other in a\ndecentralized manner, through random pairwise interactions. One or more agents\nin the population may act as authoritative sources of information, and the\nobjective of the remaining agents is to obtain information from or about these\nsource agents. We study two basic tasks: broadcasting, in which the agents are\nto learn the bit-state of an authoritative source which is present in the\npopulation, and source detection, in which the agents are required to decide if\nat least one source agent is present in the population or not.We focus on\ndesigning protocols which meet two natural conditions: (1) universality, i.e.,\nindependence of population size, and (2) rapid convergence to a correct global\nstate after a reconfiguration, such as a change in the state of a source agent.\nOur main positive result is to show that both of these constraints can be met.\nFor both the broadcasting problem and the source detection problem, we obtain\nsolutions with a convergence time of $O(\\log^2 n)$ rounds, w.h.p., from any\nstarting configuration. The solution to broadcasting is exact, which means that\nall agents reach the state broadcast by the source, while the solution to\nsource detection admits one-sided error on a $\\varepsilon$-fraction of the\npopulation (which is unavoidable for this problem). Both protocols are easy to\nimplement in practice and have a compact formulation.Our protocols exploit the\nproperties of self-organizing oscillatory dynamics. On the hardness side, our\nmain structural insight is to prove that any protocol which meets the\nconstraints of universality and of rapid convergence after reconfiguration must\ndisplay a form of non-stationary behavior (of which oscillatory dynamics are an\nexample).

Effect of stellar\n  metallicity Abstract: Observations of hot Jupiter type exoplanets suggest that their orbital period\ndistribution depends on the metallicity of their host star. We investigate here\nwhether the impact of the stellar metallicity on the evolution of the tidal\ndissipation inside the convective envelope of rotating stars and its resulting\neffect on the planetary migration might be a possible explanation for this\nobserved statistical trend.\n  We use a frequency-averaged tidal dissipation formalism coupled to an orbital\nevolution code and to rotating stellar evolution models to estimate the effect\nof a change of stellar metallicity on the evolution of close-in planets. We\nconsider here two different stellar masses: 0.4 and 1.0 $M_{\\odot}$ evolving\nfrom the early pre-main sequence phase up to the red giant branch.\n  We show that the metallicity of a star has a strong effect on the stellar\nparameters which in turn strongly influence the tidal dissipation in the\nconvective region. While on the pre-main sequence the dissipation of a metal\npoor Sun-like star is higher than the dissipation of a metal rich Sun-like\nstar, on the main sequence it is the opposite. However, for the $0.4~M_{\\odot}$\nstar, the dependence of the dissipation with metallicity is much less visible.\n  Using an orbital evolution model, we show that changing the metallicity leads\nto different orbital evolutions (e.g., planets migrate farther out from an\ninitially fast rotating metal rich star). By using this model, we qualitatively\nreproduced the observational trends of the population of hot Jupiters with the\nmetallicity of their host stars. However, more steps are needed to improve our\nmodel to try to quantitatively fit our results to the observations. Namely, we\nneed to improve the treatment of the rotation evolution in the orbital\nevolution model and ultimately we need to consistently couple of the orbital\nmodel to the stellar evolution model. \n\n"}

Probabilistic cataloging allows us to robustly characterize modeling\ncovariances within and across lens models with different numbers of subhalos.\nUnlike traditional cataloging of subhalos, it does not require model subhalos\nto improve the goodness of fit above the detection threshold.

We present a quantitative analysis of BD+46$^{\\circ}$442, a\npost-AGB binary which shows active mass transfer that leads to the creation of\na disk-driven outflow or jet. We obtained high-resolution optical spectra from\nthe HERMES spectrograph, mounted on the 1.2m Flemish Mercator Telescope. By\nperforming a time-series analysis of the Halpha profile, we dissected the\ndifferent components of the system. We deduced the jet geometry by comparing\nthe orbital phased data with our jet model. In order to image the accretion\ndisk around the companion of BD+46$^{\\circ}$442, we applied the technique of\nDoppler tomography. The orbital phase-dependent variations in the Halpha\nprofile can be related to an accretion disk around the companion, from which a\nhigh-velocity outflow or jet is launched. Our model shows that there is a clear\ncorrelation between the inclination angle and the jet opening angle. The\nlatitudinally dependent velocity structure of our jet model shows a good\ncorrespondence to the data, with outflow velocities at least higher than\n400km/s. We show that BD+46$^{\\circ}$442, is a result of a binary interaction\nchannel. The origin of the fast outflow in this system can be attributed to a\ngaseous disk around the secondary component, which is most likely a main\nsequence star. Our analysis suggests the outflow to have a rather wide opening\nangle instead of being strongly collimated. Similar orbital phase-dependent\nHalpha profiles are commonly observed in post-AGB binaries. Post-AGB binaries\nprovide ideal test bets to study jet formation and launching mechanisms over a\nwide range of orbital conditions. \n\n"}

In particular, the accretion shock region, where the accreting\nmaterial is heated to temperatures of a few MK as it continues its inward bulk\nmotion, can be probed by X-ray spectroscopy. To attempt to detect for the first\ntime the motion of this X-ray-emitting post-shock material, we searched for a\nDoppler shift in the deep Chandra/HETGS observation of the CTTS TW Hya. This\ntest should unveil the nature of this X-ray emitting plasma component in CTTS,\nand constrain the accretion stream geometry. We searched for a Doppler shift in\nthe X-ray emission from TW Hya with two different methods, by measuring the\nposition of a selected sample of emission lines, and by fitting the whole TW\nHya X-ray spectrum, allowing the line-of-sight velocity to vary. We found that\nthe plasma at T~2-4 MK has a line-of-sight velocity of 38.3+/-5.1 km/s with\nrespect to the stellar photosphere. This result definitively confirms that this\nX-ray-emitting material originates in the post-shock region, at the base of the\naccretion stream, and not in coronal structures. The comparison of the observed\nvelocity along the line of sight, 38.3+/-5.1 km/s, with the inferred intrinsic\nvelocity of the post shock of TW Hya, v_post~110-120 km/s, indicates that the\nfootpoints of the accretion streams on TW Hya are located at low latitudes on\nthe stellar surface. Our results indicate that complex magnetic field\ngeometries, such as that of TW Hya, permit low-latitude accretion spots.\nMoreover, since on TW Hya the redshift of the soft X-ray emission is very\nsimilar to that of the narrow component of the CIV resonance doublet at 1550\nAng, as found by Ardila et al. (2013), then the plasma at 2-4 MK and that at\n0.1 MK likely originate in the same post-shock regions. \n\n"}

They seem to belong to a class of events for\nwhich the fate as a genuine core-collapse supernova or a non-terminal explosion\nis still under debate. Our CMFGEN models suggest that the progenitor of\nSN2015bh had an effective temperature between 8700 and 10000 K, luminosity in\nthe range ~ 1.8-4.74e6 Lsun, contained at least 25% H in mass at the surface,\nand half-solar Fe abundances. The results also show that the progenitor of SN\n2015bh generated an extended wind with a mass-loss rate of ~ 6e-4 to 1.5e-3\nMsun/yr and a velocity of 1000 km/s. We determined that the wind extended to at\nleast 2.57e14 cm and lasted for at least 30 days prior to the observations,\nreleasing 5e-5 Msun into the circumstellar medium. In analogy to 2009ip, we\npropose that this is the material that the explosive ejecta could interact at\nlate epochs, perhaps producing observable signatures that can be probed with\nfuture observations. We conclude that the progenitor of SN 2015bh was most\nlikely a warm luminous blue variable of at least 35 Msun before the explosion.\nConsidering the high wind velocity, we cannot exclude the possibility that the\nprogenitor was a Wolf-Rayet star that inflated just before the 2013 eruption,\nsimilar to HD5980 during its 1994 episode. If the star survived, late-time\nspectroscopy may reveal either a similar LBV or a Wolf-Rayet star, depending on\nthe mass of the H envelope before the explosion.

In the first\ncase, we run MCMC sampling on the compressed data-vector in order to recover\nthe one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) posterior distributions. The\nsecond option, approximately 2000 times faster, works by orthogonalising the\nparameter space through diagonalisation of the Fisher information matrix before\nthe compression, obtaining the posterior distributions without the need of MCMC\nsampling.

For most\nsources, the observed distribution of the degree of circular polarisation is\nbroader than that of unpolarised calibrators, indicating that weak (<0.5%)\ncircular polarisation is present most of the time. Our detection rate and the\nmaximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable to previous surveys,\nall made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating\ncircular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose\nthat the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength\nsample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly\npolarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.\nCircular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or\nshorter than our median sampling interval <1 month.

The\nsource region for each burst splits from one dominant component at higher\nfrequencies into two increasingly-separated components at lower frequencies.\nFor channels below ~132 MHz, the two components repetitively diverge at high\nspeeds (0.1-0.4 c) along directions tangent to the limb, with each episode\nlasting just ~2 s. We argue that both effects result from the strong magnetic\nfield connectivity gradient that the burst-driving electron beams move into.\nPersistence mapping of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) jets observed by the Solar\nDynamics Observatory reveals quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) associated with\ncoronal null points, including separatrix dome, spine, and curtain structures.\nElectrons are accelerated at the flare site toward an open QSL, where the beams\nfollow diverging field lines to produce the source splitting, with larger\nseparations at larger heights (lower frequencies).

These finite-dimensional approximations are obtained from the\nso-called \"periodic approximation\" of the underlying automorphism and take the\nform of permutation operators. Results are established on how these\ndiscretizations approximate the Koopman operator spectrally. Specificaly, it is\nshown that both the spectral measure and the spectral projectors of these\npermutation operators converge weakly to their infinite dimensional\ncounterparts. Based on this result, a numerical method is derived for computing\nthe spectra of volume-preserving maps on the unit $m$-torus.

This hybrid method is modelled on the\nFourier power spectrum approach of treating relatively thick redshift bins\n(redshift width ~0.1) as separate surveys.

To explore a large parameter space, we\nintroduce fit functions for two mixing metrics of choice: the number of cutting\ninterfaces (a standard quantity in dynamical systems theory of interval\nexchange transformations) and a mixing norm (a more physical measure of\nmixing). We compute averages of the mixing metrics across different\npermutations (shuffling protocols), showing that the latter averages are a\nrobust descriptor of mixing for any permutation choice. If the decay of the\nnormalized mixing norm is plotted against the number of map iterations rescaled\nby the characteristic e-folding time, then universality emerges: mixing norm\ndecay curves across all cutting and shuffling protocols collapse onto a single\nstretched-exponential profile. Next, we predict this critical number of\niterations using the average length of unmixed subsegments of continuous color\nduring cutting and shuffling and a Batchelor-scale-type diffusion argument.\nThis prediction, called a \"stopping time\" for finite Markov chains, compares\nwell with the e-folding time of the stretched-exponential fit.

We then fit the CMD of 1100 bright DA WDs within\n100 pc, for which atmospheric composition and completeness are well-understood.\nThe resulting best-fit IFMR flattens at $3.5 \\lesssim m_{\\rm\nin}/M_{\\odot}\\lesssim 5.5$, producing a secondary peak in the WD mass\ndistribution at $m_{\\rm WD} \\sim 0.8 M_{\\odot}$. Our IFMR is broadly consistent\nwith weaker constraints obtained from binaries and star clusters in previous\nwork but represents the clearest observational evidence obtained to date of\ntheoretically-predicted non-linearity in the IFMR. A visibly bimodal CMD is\nonly predicted for mixed-age stellar populations: in single-age clusters, more\nmassive WDs reach the bottom of the cooling sequence before the first\nlower-mass WDs appear. This may explain why bimodal cooling sequences have thus\nfar evaded detection in cluster CMDs. \n\n"}

In this work, we present an\neffective solution to this problem in the form of a robust likelihood designed\nto account for effects due to unknown foreground and target contaminations.\nConceptually, this robust likelihood marginalizes over the unknown large-scale\ncontamination amplitudes. We showcase the effectiveness of this novel\nlikelihood via an application to a mock SDSS-III data set subject to dust\nextinction contamination.

Unlike in the measure-theoretic case, where\nKolmogorov--Sinai entropy is the estimate, in the topological setup the task\nreaches beyond the classical theory of entropy. Tools from an extended theory\nof entropy structures are needed. The main goal of this paper is to prove the\nSEET for actions of countable amenable groups: Let a countable amenable group\n$G$ act by homeomorphisms on a compact metric space $X$ and let $\\mathcal\nM_G(X)$ denote the simplex of $G$-invariant probability measures on $X$.

We study the temperature distributions obtained with ALMA\nBand 6 (in four sub-bands at 1.21, 1.22, 1.29, and 1.3 mm) for various areas\nat, and in the vicinity of, a sunspot, comprising quasi-quiet and active\nregions with different amounts of underlying magnetic fields. We compare these\ntemperatures with those obtained at near- and far-ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths\n(and with the line-core intensities of the optically-thin far-UV spectra),\nco-observed with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) explorer.\nThese include the emission peaks and cores of the Mg II k 279.6 nm and Mg II h\n280.4 nm lines as well as the line cores of C II 133.4 nm, O I 135.6 nm, and Si\nIV 139.4 nm, sampling the mid-to-high chromosphere and the low transition\nregion. Splitting the ALMA sub-bands resulted in an slight increase of spatial\nresolution in individual temperature maps, thus, resolving smaller-scale\nstructures compared to those produced with the standard averaging routines. We\nfind that the radiation temperatures have different, though somewhat\noverlapping, distributions in different wavelengths and in the various magnetic\nregions. Comparison of the ALMA temperatures with those of the UV diagnostics\nshould, however, be interpreted with great caution, the former is formed under\nthe local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions, the latter under non-LTE.\nThe mean radiation temperature of the ALMA Band 6 is similar to that extracted\nfrom the IRIS C II line in all areas with exception of the sunspot and pores\nwhere the C II poses higher radiation temperatures. In all magnetic regions,\nthe Mg II lines associate with the lowest mean radiation temperatures in our\nsample. These will provide constraints for future numerical models. \n\n"}

Its light curve exhibited\nfive distinct brightening episodes, reaching up to I=12 mag, and it was covered\nin great detail with almost 25,000 data points gathered by a network of\ntelescopes.

The photometric data allowed us to solve the\nmicrolensing event entirely and to derive the complete and unique set of\norbital parameters of the binary lensing system. We also report on the\ndetection of the first-ever microlensing space-parallax between the Earth and\nGaia located at L2. The properties of the binary system were derived from\nmicrolensing parameters, and we found that the system is composed of two\nmain-sequence stars with masses 0.57$\\pm$0.05 $M_\\odot$ and 0.36$\\pm$0.03\n$M_\\odot$ at 780 pc, with an orbital period of 2.88 years and an eccentricity\nof 0.30.

Part A of the article deals with general\npost-Newtonian sources. The exterior field of the source is investigated by\nmeans of a combination of analytic post-Minkowskian and multipolar\napproximations. The physical observables in the far-zone of the source are\ndescribed by a specific set of radiative multipole moments. By matching the\nexterior solution to the metric of the post-Newtonian source in the near-zone\nwe obtain the explicit expressions of the source multipole moments. The\nrelationships between the radiative and source moments involve many non-linear\nmultipole interactions, among them those associated with the tails (and\ntails-of-tails) of gravitational waves.
