Under these conditions,\nstable de Sitter vacua can be obtained in dimensionally reduced theories (from\n5D to 4D) if the semi-direct product of SO(1,1) with R^(1,1) together with a\nsimultaneous R_s is gauged.

For a positive gravity\ninduced anomalous dimension $A_\\lambda>0$ the running of the quartic scalar\nself interaction $\\lambda$ at scales beyond the Planck mass is determined by a\nfixed point at zero. This results in $m_H=m_{\\rm min}=126$ GeV, with only a few\nGeV uncertainty. This prediction is independent of the details of the short\ndistance running and holds for a wide class of extensions of the SM as well.\nFor $A_\\lambda <0$ one finds $m_H$ in the interval $m_{\\rm min}< m_H < m_{\\rm\nmax}\\simeq 174$ GeV, now sensitive to $A_\\lambda$ and other properties of the\nshort distance running. The case $A_\\lambda>0$ is favored by explicit\ncomputations existing in the literature. \n\n"}

When the vacuum moduli can be dialed\nadiabatically until the central charges become anti -parallel, a paradox\narises. We show that this paradox is always resolved by the existence of \"bound\nstate transformation walls\" across which the nature of the bound state changes,\nalthough the index does not jump. We find that there are two distinct phenomena\nthat can take place on these walls, which we call recombination and\nconjugation. The latter is associated to the presence of singularities at\nfinite distance in moduli space. Consistency of conjugation and wall-crossing\nrules near these singularities leads to new constraints on the BPS spectrum.\nSingular loci supporting massless vector bosons are particularly subtle in this\nrespect. We argue that the spectrum at such loci necessarily contains massless\nmagnetic monopoles, and that bound states around them transform by intricate\nhybrids of conjugation and recombination. \n\n"}

This relation was explained by\nconsidering in this background a probe D3 brane, which supports this theory\nwith SU(2) realized as Sp(1). Here we explicitly compute the non-perturbative\ncorrections to the D7/D3 system in type I' due to D-instantons. This\ncomputation provides both the quartic effective action on the D7 branes and the\nquadratic effective action on the D3 brane; the latter agrees with the\nF-theoretic prediction. The action obtained in this way is related to the one\nderived from the usual instanton calculus \\`a la Nekrasov (or from its AGT\nrealization in terms of Liouville conformal blocks) by means of a\nnon-perturbative redefinition of the coupling constant.

In this work we\nstudy the thermodynamics and phase structure of the same in a grand canonical\nensemble. Since the boundary data in two cases are different (for the grand\ncanonical ensemble boundary potential is fixed instead of the charge as in\ncanonical ensemble) the stability analysis and the phase structure in the two\ncases are quite different. In particular, we find that there exists an analog\nof one-variable analysis as in canonical ensemble, which gives the same\nstability condition as the rather complicated known (but generalized from black\nholes to the present case) two-variable analysis.

We work in the context of\ndiffeomorphism invariant gauge theories, which exist for any non-abelian gauge\ngroup G, and which have second order in derivatives field equations. We show\nthat any (non-trivial) vacuum solution of such a theory gives rise to an\nembedding of the group SU(2) into G, and thus breaks G down to SU(2) times its\ncentralizer in G. The components of the connection charged under SU(2) can then\nbe seen to describe gravitons, with the SU(2) itself playing the role of the\nchiral half of the Lorentz group. Components charged under the centralizer\ndescribe the usual Yang-Mills gauge bosons. The remaining components describe\nmassive particles.

Branes extending from $\\mu=\\pm\\pi/2$\ncan end at different locations, giving rise to quarks with piecewise constant\nmass on each $AdS_4$ half-space, jumping discontinuously between them. A second\nclass of flavor brane solutions exists in this coordinate system, dubbed\n\"continuous\" flavor branes, that extend across the entire range of $\\mu$. We\npropose that the correct dual interpretation of \"disconnected\" flavor brane in\nthis ansatz is a quark hypermultiplet with constant mass on one of the AdS$_4$\nhalf-spaces with totally reflecting boundary conditions at the boundary of\nAdS$_4$; whereas the dual interpretation of a continuous flavor brane has\ntotally transparent boundary conditions.

Those\ncorresponding to constraints in the phase space, and those associated with\nnontrivial conserved charges. We argue that while the former is related to\nredundant gauge degrees of freedom, the latter leads to physically distinct\nstates of the system, known as surface degrees of freedom and can induce a\nlower dimensional dynamics on the system.

In\nmodels with non-minimal couplings of the scalar fields to the Ricci scalar,\nthat are conformal invariant, the spontaneous generation by a scalar field(s)\nvev of a positive Newton constant demands a negative kinetic term for the\nscalar field, or vice-versa. This is naturally avoided in models with\nadditional Weyl gauge symmetry. The Weyl gauge field $\\omega_\\mu$ couples to\nthe scalar sector but not to the fermionic sector of a SM-like Lagrangian. The\nfield $\\omega_\\mu$ undergoes a Stueckelberg mechanism and becomes massive after\n\"eating\" the (radial mode) would-be-Goldstone field (dilaton $\\rho$) in the\nscalar sector.

Gravitational energy differences between observers in\nbound systems, such as galaxies, and volume-averaged comoving locations within\nvoids in freely expanding space can be so large that the time dilation between\nthe two significantly affects the parameters of any effective homogeneous\nisotropic model one fits to the universe.

Using path integration techniques, we show that the relative Casimir\nenergy vanishes exponentially fast in temperature. This is consistent with a\nsimple physical argument based on Kirchhoff's law. As a result the ``relative\nCasimir entropy\", which we define in an obviously analogous manner, tends, in\nthe classical limit, to a finite asymptotic value which depends only on the\ngeometry of the boundaries. Thus the Casimir force between disjoint pieces of\nthe boundary, in the classical limit, is entropy driven and is governed by a\ndimensionless number characterizing the geometry of the cavity. Contributions\nto the Casimir thermodynamical quantities due to each individual connected\ncomponent of the boundary exhibit logarithmic deviations in temperature from\nthe behavior just described.

Our approach to the\nCasimir effect is not to impose sharp boundary conditions on the fluctuating\nfield, but rather take into consideration its interaction with the plasma of\n``charge carriers'' in the boundary, with the plasma frequency playing the role\nof a physical UV cutoff.

Of central importance in our\nanalysis is the notion of the ``energy-momentum map'' associated to the gauge\ngroup of a given classical field theory. We hope to demonstrate that many\ndifferent and apparently unrelated facets of field theories can be thereby tied\ntogether and understood in an essentially new way.\n  In Part I we develop some of the basic theory of classical fields from a\nspacetime covariant viewpoint. We begin with a study of the covariant\nLagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, on jet bundles and multisymplectic\nmanifolds, respectively. Then we discuss symmetries, conservation laws, and\nNoether's theorem in terms of ``covariant momentum maps.'' \n\n"}
