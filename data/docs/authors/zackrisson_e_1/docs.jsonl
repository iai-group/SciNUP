Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

It also shows that when ssSSP models are used to determine the ages and\nmetallicities of stellar populations, lower ages or metallicities will be\nobtained, taking two line indices (Hbeta and [MgFe]) and two colours (e.g., u-R\nand R-K), respectively.

Here we study the mass distribution of HB stars\nin M3 by comparing evolutionary tracks and photometric observations. Our\napproach is thus of a semi-empirical nature, describing as it does the mass\ndistribution that is favored from the standpoint of canonical stellar\nevolutionary predictions for the distribution of stars across the CMD. We\nlocate, for each individual HB star, the evolutionary track whose distance from\nthe star's observed color and magnitude is a minimum. Artificial tests reveal\nthat our method would be able to detect a bimodal mass distribution, if\npresent. We study the impact of different procedures for taking into account\nthe evolutionary speed, and conclude that they have but a small effect upon the\ninferred mass distribution. We find that a Gaussian shape, though providing a\nreasonable first approximation, fails to account for the detailed shape of M3's\nHB mass distribution: the latter may have skewness and kurtosis that deviate\nslightly from a perfectly Gaussian solution. Alternatively, the excess of stars\ntowards the wings of the distribution may also be accounted for in terms of a\nbimodal distribution in which both the low- and the high-mass modes are normal,\nthe former being significantly wider than the latter.

We quantify the presence of a long tail in the\nformation rate of metal-free halos during late stages of reionization (redshift\nz~6), which might offer the best window to detect Population III stars. Using\ncosmological simulations for the growth of dark matter halos, coupled with\nanalytical recipes for the metal enrichment of their interstellar medium, we\nshow that pockets of metal-free gas exist at z~6 even under the assumption of\nhigh efficiency in metal pollution via winds.

We confirm\nthe existence of a tight relation between colour and HI-fraction across all the\nrange of colours, although outside the blue cloud this trend becomes gradually\nweaker. Transition galaxies are divided into two different families, according\nto their atomic hydrogen content. HI-deficient galaxies are the majority of\ntransition galaxies in our sample. They are found in high density environments\nand all their properties are consistent with a quenching of the star formation\nvia gas stripping. However, while the migration from the blue cloud is\nrelatively quick (i.e., <=1 Gyr), a longer amount of time (a few Gyr at least)\nseems required to completely suppress the star formation and reach the red\nsequence. At all masses, migrating HI-deficient galaxies are mainly disks,\nimplying that the mechanism responsible for today's migration in clusters\ncannot have played a significant role in the creation of the red sequence at\nhigh-redshift. Conversely, HI-normal transition galaxies are a more\nheterogeneous population.

Abstract: The observations show that less massive the galaxies are, the higher on\naverage is their specific star formation rate (SSFR = SFR/Ms, Ms is the stellar\nmass). Such a trend, called the 'SSFR downsizing' (SSFR-DS) phenomenon, is seen\nfor local and high-z (back to z~1-2) galaxy samples. We use observational data\nrelated only to disc galaxies and explore the average SSFR change with z for\ndifferent masses. For Ms in the range ~10^9.5-10^10.5 Msun, the SSFR increases\nwith (1+z) to a power that barely depends on Ms, and at all z's smaller\ngalaxies have ever higher SSFRs. The latter strongly disagree with the LCDM\nhierarchical mass accretion rates. By means of self-consistent models of disc\ngalaxy evolution inside growing LCDM halos, the effects that disc\nfeedback-driven outflows and gas re-accretion have on the galaxy SSFR histories\nare explored. The parameters of the outflow and re-accretion schemes are tuned\nto reproduce the z~0 Mh-Ms relation inferred from observations. In the case of\noutflows only, the SSFR of individual model galaxies is roughly proportional to\n(1+z)^2.2 for all the masses with a normalization factor that depends on mass\nas Ms^0.1, i.e more massive galaxies have slightly larger SSFRs, contrary to\nthe observed strong SSFR-DS trend. For the re-accretion cases, the dependence\non z remains approximately the same as without re-infall, but the correlation\non Ms even increases for most of the reasonable values of the model parameters.\nThe comparison of models and observations in the SSFR-Ms plane at z~0 shows the\ndivergent trend in SSFR as lower are the masses (upsizing vs downsizing).

Thus far,\nimages of high-redshift quasars from the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (UDF) provide\nthe most stringent test of spacetime foam theories.

Here $\\alpha \\sim 1$ parametrizes the different spacetime\nfoam models according to which the fluctuation of a distance $l$ is given by\n$\\sim l^{1 - \\alpha} l_P^{\\alpha}$ with $l_P$ being the Planck length.

However, the evolution of the comoving number density is\nvery different: the decrease in the total number density of M_B <= -20 galaxies\nsince z = 1 is due to the decrease in the late-type population, which accounts\nfor ~75% of the total star-formation rate in the range under study, while the\nincrease in the total number density of M_star >= 10^10 M_Sun galaxies in the\nsame redshift range is due to the evolution of early types.

This hypothesis is at variance with the assumption that the usual\ncontinuity equation holds but, in the inviscid limit, both models agree in the\nregular regions.

In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM\ntemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by\napproximately 20%.

While derivation of the absolute neutral fraction remains\ndifficult with this technique, the evolution of the NZ sizes suggests a\ndecrease in the neutral fraction of intergalactic hydrogen by a factor ~ 9.4\nfrom z=6.4 to 5.7, in its simplest interpretation. Alternatively, recent\nnumerical simulations suggest that this rapid increase in near-zone size from\nz=6.4 to 5.7 is due to the rapid increase in the background photo-ionization\nrate at the end of the percolation or overlap phase, when the average mean free\npath of ionizing photons increases dramatically. In either case, the results\nare consistent with the idea that z ~ 6 to 7 corresponds to the tail end of\ncosmic reionization. The scatter in the normalized NZ sizes is larger than\nexpected simply from measurement errors, and likely reflects intrinsic\ndifferences in the quasars or their environments.

I: First Systematics Abstract: Star clusters are studied widely both as benchmarks for stellar evolution\nmodels and in their own right. Cluster age and mass distributions within\ngalaxies are probes of star formation histories, and of cluster formation and\ndisruption processes. The vast majority of clusters in the Universe is small,\nand it is well known that the integrated fluxes and colors have broad\nprobability distributions, due to small numbers of bright stars. This paper\ngoes beyond the description of predicted probability distributions, and\npresents results of the analysis of cluster energy distributions in an\nexplicitly stochastic context. The method developed is Bayesian. It provides\nposterior probability distributions in the age-mass-extinction space, using\nmulti-wavelength photometric observations and a large collection of Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of clusters of finite stellar masses. Both UBVI and UBVIK datasets\nare considered, and the study conducted in this paper is restricted to the\nsolar metallicity. We first reassess and explain errors arising from the use of\nstandard analysis methods, which are based on continuous population synthesis\nmodels: systematic errors on ages and random errors on masses are large, while\nsystematic errors on masses tend to be smaller.

Abstract: Galaxies are missing most of their baryons, and many models predict these\nbaryons lie in a hot halo around galaxies. We establish observationally\nmotivated constraints on the mass and radii of these haloes using a variety of\nindependent arguments. First, the observed dispersion measure of pulsars in the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud allows us to constrain the hot halo around the Milky\nWay: if it obeys the standard NFW profile, it must contain less than 4-5% of\nthe missing baryons from the Galaxy. This is similar to other upper limits on\nthe Galactic hot halo, such as the soft X-ray background and the pressure\naround high velocity clouds. Second, we note that the X-ray surface brightness\nof hot haloes with NFW profiles around large isolated galaxies is high enough\nthat such emission should be observed, unless their haloes contain less than\n10-25% of their missing baryons. Third, we place constraints on the column\ndensity of hot haloes using nondetections of OVII absorption along AGN\nsightlines: in general they must contain less than 70% of the missing baryons\nor extend to no more than 40 kpc. Flattening the density profile of galactic\nhot haloes weakens the surface brightness constraint so that a typical L$_*$\ngalaxy may hold half its missing baryons in its halo, but the OVII constraint\nremains unchanged, and around the Milky Way a flattened profile may only hold\n$6-13%$ of the missing baryons from the Galaxy ($2-4 \\times 10^{10}\nM_{\\odot}$). We also show that AGN and supernovae at low to moderate redshift -\nthe theoretical sources of winds responsible for driving out the missing\nbaryons - do not produce the expected correlations with the baryonic\nTully-Fisher relationship and so are insufficient to explain the missing\nbaryons from galaxies. We conclude that most of missing baryons from galaxies\ndo not lie in hot haloes around the galaxies, and that the missing baryons\nnever fell into the potential wells of protogalaxies in the first place. They\nmay have been expelled from the galaxies as part of the process of galaxy\nformation. \n\n"}

Many of these studies were based on GALEX imaging of SDSS galaxies\n(z~0.1), and were thus limited by its 5\" FWHM. Poor UV resolution left other\npossibilities for UV excess open, such as the old populations or an AGN. Here\nwe study high-resolution far-ultraviolet HST/ACS images of optically quiescent\nearly-type galaxies with strong UV excess. The new images show that\nthree-quarters of these moderately massive (~5x10^10 M_sun) early-type galaxies\nshows clear evidence of extended SF, usually in form of wide or concentric UV\nrings, and in some cases, striking spiral arms.

In X-rays, they are relatively\nbright, and Abell 223 shows a double structure. A filament has also been\ndetected between the clusters both at optical and X-ray wavelengths. We analyse\nthe optical properties of these two clusters based on deep imaging in two\nbands, derive their galaxy minosity functions (GLFs) and correlate these\nproperties with X-ray characteristics derived from XMM-Newton data. The GLFs of\nAbell 222 in the g' and r' bands are well fit by a Schechter function; the GLF\nis steeper in r' than in g'. For Abell 223, the GLFs in both bands require a\nsecond component at bright magnitudes, added to a Schechter function; they are\nsimilar in both bands.

Previous attempts to\nmeasure fesc have found a wide range of values, varying from less than 0.01 to\nnearly 1. Rather than finding a single value of fesc, we clarify through\nmodeling how internal properties of galaxies affect fesc through the density\nand distribution of neutral hydrogen within the galaxy, along with the rate of\nionizing photons production. We find that the escape fraction depends\nsensitively on the covering factor of clumps, along with the density of the\nclumped and interclump medium. One must therefore be cautious when dealing with\nan inhomogeneous medium. Fewer, high-density clumps lead to a greater escape\nfraction than more numerous low-density clumps. When more ionizing photons are\nproduced in a starburst, fesc increases, as photons escape more readily from\nthe gas layers. Large variations in the predicted escape fraction, caused by\ndifferences in the hydrogen distribution, may explain the large observed\ndifferences in fesc among galaxies. Values of fesc must also be consistent with\nthe reionization history. High-mass galaxies alone are unable to reionize the\nuniverse, because fesc > 1 would be required. Small galaxies are needed to\nachieve reionization, with greater mean escape fraction in the past. \n\n"}

This plays an important role in both linear and\nnon linear interactions between haloes. ii).- Most of the mass in the Universe\nis concentrated in filaments, narrowly followed by clusters.

The cosmic SFRD is dominated by galaxies with Mstar = 10^{10-11} Msun\nat 0.5<z<3.5, while the contribution of massive galaxies with Mstar =\n10^{11-11.5} Msun shows a strong evolution at z>1 and becomes significant at\nz~3, especially in the case with the SFR based on MIPS 24um. In galaxies with\nMstar = 10^{10-11.5} Msun, those with a relatively narrow range of SSFR (<~1\ndex) dominates the cosmic SFRD at 0.5<z<3.5. The SSFR of galaxies which\ndominate the SFRD systematically increases with redshift.

We use the simple Zeldovich dynamics as a\nbenchmark, as it allows the exact computation of the full nonlinear power\nspectrum and of perturbative terms at all orders. Then, we introduce a \"sticky\nmodel\" that coincides with the Zeldovich dynamics before shell crossing but\nshows a different behavior afterwards. Thus, their power spectra only differ in\ntheir nonperturbative terms. We consider both the real-space and redshift-space\npower spectra. We find that the potential of perturbative schemes is greater at\nhigher redshift for a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. For the real-space power\nspectrum, one can go up to order $66$ of perturbation theory at $z=3$, and to\norder $9$ at $z=0$, before the nonperturbative correction surpasses the\nperturbative correction of that order.

Radial profiles of 18 nearby spiral galaxies from\nTHINGS, HERACLES, SINGS, and GALEX data are used to compare the observed star\nformation efficiency, molecular fraction, and velocity dispersion to the model.\nThe observed radially decreasing velocity dispersion can be reproduced by the\nmodel. In the framework of this model the decrease in the inner disk is due to\nthe stellar mass distribution which dominates the gravitational potential.\nIntroducing a radial break in the star formation efficiency into the model\nimproves the fits significantly. This change in star formation regime is\nrealized by replacing the free fall time in the prescription of the star\nformation rate with the molecule formation timescale. Depending on the star\nformation prescription, the break radius is located near the transition region\nbetween the molecular-gas-dominated and atomic-gas-dominated parts of the\ngalactic disk or closer to the optical radius.

Observations and theory support models in\nwhich these cusps are formed by dissipative gas inflows and nuclear starbursts\nin gas-rich mergers. At these comparatively large radii, stellar relaxation is\nunlikely to account for or strongly modify the cuspy stellar profiles. We argue\nthat the power-law surface density profiles observed are a natural consequence\nof the gravitational instabilities that dominate angular momentum transport in\nthe gravitational potential of a central massive black hole. The dominant mode\nat these radii is an m=1 lopsided/eccentric disk instability, in which stars\ntorquing the gas can drive rapid inflow and accretion. Such a mode first\ngenerically appears at large radii and propagates inwards by exciting\neccentricities at smaller and smaller radii, where M*(<R)<<M_BH. When the\nstellar surface density profile is comparatively shallow with n<1/2, the modes\ncannot efficiently propagate to R=0 and so gas piles up and star formation\nsteepens the profile. But if the profile is steeper than n=1, the inwards\npropagation of eccentricity is strongly damped, suppressing inflow and bringing\nn down again. Together these results produce an equilibrium slope of 1/2 < n <\n1 in the potential of the central black hole. These physical arguments are\nsupported by nonlinear numerical simulations of gas inflow in galactic nuclei.\nTogether, these results naturally explain the observed stellar density profiles\nof 'cusp' elliptical galaxies. \n\n"}

When $M_{crit}$ is higher than the maximum mass achieved by the WD,\nthe WD must spin down before it can explode. This introduces a delay between\nthe time at which the WD has completed its epoch of mass gain and the time of\nthe explosion. Matter ejected from the binary during mass transfer therefore\nhas a chance to become diffuse, and the explosion occurs in a medium with a\ndensity similar to that of typical regions of the interstellar medium. Also,\neither by the end of the WD's mass increase or else by the time of explosion,\nthe donor may exhaust its stellar envelope and become a WD.

In the linear perturbation theory limit, the\nbias-modulation method of McDonald & Seljak allows one to distinguish the\nreal-space galaxy clustering from the peculiar velocity signal in each Fourier\nmode. The ratio of lensing signal to galaxy clustering in transverse modes\nyields the bias factor b of each galaxy subset (as per Pen 2004), hence\ncalibrating the conversion from galaxy real-space density to matter density in\nevery mode. In combination these techniques permit measure of the growth rate f\nin each Fourier mode. This yields a measure of the growth rate free of sample\nvariance, i.e. the uncertainty in f can be reduced without bound by increasing\nthe number of redshifts within a finite volume. In practice, the gain from the\nabsence of sample variance is bounded by the limited range of bias modulation\namong dark-matter halos. Nonetheless, the addition of background weak lensing\ndata to a redshift survey increases information on G and f by an amount\nequivalent to a 10-fold increase in the volume of a standard redshift-space\ndistortion measurement---if the lensing signal can be measured to sub-percent\naccuracy.

The X-ray\nselected clusters are massive (kT > 5 keV; 5 - 30 x 10^14 M_solar) and, in most\ncases, dynamically relaxed. Five additional clusters are included for their\nlensing strength (Einstein radii > 35 arcsec at z_source = 2) to further\nquantify the lensing bias on concentration, to yield high resolution dark\nmatter maps, and to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnified\nhigh-redshift (z > 7) galaxies. The high magnification, in some cases, provides\nangular resolutions unobtainable with any current UVOIR facility and can yield\nz > 7 candidates bright enough for spectroscopic follow-up. A total of 16\nbroadband filters, spanning the near-UV to near-IR, are employed for each\n20-orbit campaign on each cluster. These data are used to measure precise\n(sigma_phz < 0.02(1+z)) photometric redshifts for dozens of newly discovered\nmultiply-lensed images per cluster. Observations of each cluster are spread\nover 8 epochs to enable a search, primarily in the parallel fields, for Type Ia\nsupernovae at z > 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the dark\nenergy equation of state and the evolution of such supernovae in an epoch when\nthe universe is matter dominated. \n\n"}

We compute hydrogen reionization\nhistories, CMB optical depths and anisotropy power spectra for a range of\nstellar populations including dark stars. If dark stars capture large amounts\nof dark matter via nuclear scattering, reionization can be substantially\ndelayed, leading to decreases in the integrated optical depth to last\nscattering and large-scale power in the EE polarization power spectrum. Using\nthe integrated optical depth observed by WMAP7, in our canonical reionization\nmodel we rule out the section of parameter space where dark stars with high\nscattering-induced capture rates tie up more than ~90% of all the first\nstar-forming baryons, and live for over ~250 Myr.

Roughly 30% of the clusters show radio emission above a flux\nthreshold of 3 mJy within a projected radius of 250 kpc. The radio emission is\npresumably associated with the brightest cluster galaxy. The mechanical jet\npower for each radio source was determined using scaling relations between\nradio power and cavity (mechanical) power determined for nearby clusters,\ngroups, and galaxies with hot atmospheres containing X-ray cavities. The\naverage jet power of the central radio AGN is approximately $2\\times\n10^{44}$\\ergs. We find no significant correlation between radio power, hence\nmechanical jet power, and the X-ray luminosities of clusters in the redshift\nrange 0.1 -- 0.6. This implies that the mechanical heating rate per particle is\nhigher in lower mass, lower X-ray luminosity clusters. The jet power averaged\nover the sample corresponds to an atmospheric heating of approximately 0.2 keV\nper particle within R$_{500}$. Assuming the current AGN heating rate does not\nevolve but remains constant to redshifts of 2, the heating rate per particle\nwould rise by a factor of two.

JCs in the galaxy center heat up their MACHOs by tidal\nforces, which makes them expand, so that coagulation and star formation occurs.\nBeing continuously fed by matter from bypassing JCs, the central star(s) may\ntransform into a super massive black hole. It has a fast $t^3$ growth during\nthe first mega years, and a slow $t^{1/3}$ growth at giga years. JCs disrupted\nby a close encounter with this black hole can provide matter for the bulge.\nThose that survive can be so agitated that they form stars inside them and\nbecome globular star clusters.

To\nreconcile these different results, we simulated both approaches and found that\nbeta measurements for faint sources are subject to large biases if the same\npassbands are used both to select the sources and to measure beta.\nHigh-redshift galaxies show a well-defined rest-frame UV color-magnitude (CM)\nrelationship that becomes systematically bluer towards fainter UV luminosities.\nNo evolution is seen in the slope of the UV CM relationship in the first 1.5\nGyr, though there is a small evolution in the zero-point to redder colors from\nz~7 to z~4.

We use numerical simulations of merging\ndisc galaxies to investigate which mechanism dominates. The simulations include\na model for the formation and dynamical disruption of the entire star cluster\npopulation. We find that the dynamical heating of clusters by tidal shocks is\nabout an order of magnitude higher in interacting galaxies than in isolated\ngalaxies. This is driven by the increased gas density, and is sufficient to\ndestroy star clusters at a higher rate than new clusters are formed: the total\nnumber of clusters in the merger remnant is 2-50% of the amount in the\nprogenitor discs, with low-mass clusters being disrupted preferentially. By\nadopting observationally motivated selection criteria, we find that the\nobserved surplus of star clusters in nearby merging galaxies is caused by the\nbias to detect young, massive clusters. We provide a general expression for the\nsurvival fraction of clusters, which increases with the gas depletion\ntime-scale.

In this paper, we study the properties of the\nmodel, by varying the mass of the galaxy, the star formation rate, and the\nefficiency of star formation. Our main results are the following: (1) For a\ngiven star formation efficiency f*, a more extended period of active star\nformation tends to produce a galactic wind that reaches a larger extent. If f*\nis sufficiently large, the energy deposited by the stars completely expels the\nISM. Eventually, the ISM is being replenished by mass loss from supernovae and\nstellar winds. (2) For galaxies with masses above 10^11 Msun, the material\nejected in the IGM always falls back onto the galaxy. Hence lower-mass galaxies\nare the ones responsible for enriching the IGM. (3) Stellar winds play a minor\nrole in the dynamical evolution of the galactic wind, because their energy\ninput is small compared to supernovae. However, they contribute significantly\nto the chemical composition of the galactic wind.

We argue that the low energy relations representing the\nquantum anomalies of QCD are saturated by coherent low dimensional vacuum\nconfigurations as observed in Monte Carlo lattice studies. The thermal spectrum\nand approximate universality of the temperature with no dependence on energy of\ncolliding particles in this framework is due to the fact that the emission\nresults from the distortion of these low dimensional vacuum sheets rather than\nfrom the colliding particles themselves. The emergence of the long- range\ncorrelations of P odd domains (a feature which is apparently required for\nexplanation of the asymmetry observed at RHIC and LHC) is also a result of the\nsame distortion of the QCD vacuum configurations.

The aim of\nthis work is to search for the imprint of the environment on the chemical\nevolution of these galaxies. Galaxy chemical evolution is linked to the star\nformation history (SFH), as well as to the gas interchange with the\nenvironment, and low-mass galaxies are well known to be vulnerable systems to\nenvironmental processes affecting both these parameters. For our study we have\nused spectra from the SDSS-III DR8. We have examined the mass-metallicity\nrelation of cluster galaxies finding well defined sequences. The slope of these\nsequences, for galaxies in low-mass clusters and galaxies at large\ncluster-centric distances, follows the predictions of recent hydrodynamic\nmodels. A flattening of this slope has been observed for galaxies located in\nthe core of the two more massive clusters of the sample, principally in Coma,\nsuggesting that the imprint of the cluster environment on the chemical\nevolution of SF galaxies should be sensitive to both the galaxy mass and the\nhost cluster mass. The HI gas content of Coma and A1367 galaxies indicate that\nlow-mass SF galaxies, located at the core of these clusters, have been severely\naffected by ram-pressure stripping.

Under this \\emph{constant\nprecession cone} approximation, we show that the gravitational-wave phasing is\nmodulated in two ways: a secular increase of the gravitational-wave phase due\nto precession and an oscillation around this secular increase. We show that\nthis secular evolution occurs in precisely three ways, corresponding to\nphysically different apparent evolutions of the binary's precession about the\nline of sight.

Due to short free-fall times, these high-density regions achieve high\nlocal star formation efficiencies, enabling them to form bound clusters.\nStar-forming regions of lower density remain substructured and gas-rich, ending\nup unbound when the residual gas is expelled. Additionally, the tidal\nperturbation of star-forming regions by nearby, dense giant molecular clouds\nimposes a minimum density contrast required for the collapse to a bound\ncluster. The fraction of all star formation that occurs in bound stellar\nclusters (the cluster formation efficiency or CFE) follows by integration of\nthese local clustering and survival properties over the full density spectrum\nof the ISM, and hence is set by galaxy-scale physics. We derive the CFE as a\nfunction of observable galaxy properties, and find that it increases with the\ngas surface density, from ~1% in low-density galaxies to a peak value of ~70%\nat densities of ~10^3 Msun pc^-2. This explains the observation that the CFE\nincreases with the star formation rate density in nearby dwarf, spiral, and\nstarburst galaxies. Indeed, comparing our model results with observed galaxies\nyields excellent agreement. The model is applied further by calculating the\nspatial variation of the CFE within single galaxies.

The chemical\nevolution observed within this central region depends critically upon the\nrelative size of the bar and the aperture, which evolves strongly with time. At\nt~0.5Gyr, a strong bar forms, whose length is considerably longer than the 2kpc\naperture. The stars and gas lose angular momentum and follow elongated orbits\nthat cause an intense mixing of the gas between the central region and its\nsurroundings. During the next 1.5Gyr, the orbits of the gas contract\nsignificantly until the entire gas bar is contained in the 2kpc aperture,\nresulting in a net flux of gas into the central region. During this period, the\nmetallicity in the central region increases steadily, and this enrichment is\ndominated by metal-rich gas that is flowing into the central region.

Eight star forming galaxies with\nredshifts z > 0.015 from the FUSE archive were re-examined. Also, a sub-sample\nof an additional four galaxies with lower redshifts were included, for which\nthe escape fraction was estimated from residual flux in the low ionization\ninterstellar C II(1036{\\AA}) line. Out of the eight galaxies, only one was\nfound to have significant LyC leakage, Tol 1247-232 (S/N=5.2). This is the\nsecond detection of a leaking galaxy in the local universe. We find an absolute\nescape fraction for Tol 1247-232 of f_esc = 2.4(+0.9/-0.8) %. The stacked\nsample show an excess in the LyC with f_esc = 1.4(+0.6/-0.5) %, but we note\nthat there might be important selection biases involved. With the small sample,\nwe suggest a possible trend for higher f_esc with lower mass and with enhanced\nSSFR.

With the aim of analysing the dependence of the mass loading of the\noutflow, beta (i.e. the ratio between the outflow and star formation rates), on\ngalaxy properties, we embed our model in the galaxy formation simulation,\nGALFORM, set in the LCDM framework.

First,\nthe amplitude of scalar curvature perturbations is not directly tied to the\nshape of the inflationary potential. This allows the theory to violate na\\\"ive\nformulations of the Lyth bound. Second, the tensor sector of the theory is\nsignificantly altered from the usual case: the non-Abelian gauge field\nperturbations have a tensor degree of freedom. One chirality of the this tensor\ncan be exponentially enhanced by a temporary instability near horizon crossing;\nthis chiral instability exists because of the classical gauge field background,\nwhich violates parity. These tensor fluctuations of the gauge field also couple\nto gravitational waves at linear order in perturbation theory and source a\nchiral spectrum of gravitational waves.

Young massive cluster (YMC) progenitor\nclouds in the Galactic Center can accumulate to a high enough density without\nforming stars that the initial protostellar densities are close to the final\nstellar density. For this to hold in the disk, the time scale to accumulate the\ngas to such high densities must be much shorter than the star formation\ntimescale. Otherwise the gas begins forming stars while it is being accumulated\nto high density. The distinction between the formation regimes in the two\nenvironments is consistent with the predictions of environmentally-dependent\ndensity thresholds for star formation. This implies that stars in YMCs of\nsimilar total mass and radius can have formed at widely different initial\nprotostellar densities. The fact that no systematic variations in fundamental\nproperties are observed between YMCs in the disk and Galactic Center suggests\nstellar mass assembly is not strongly affected by the initial protostellar\ndensity. We review recent theoretical advances and summarize the debate on\nthree key open questions: the initial (proto)stellar distribution, infant\n(im)mortality and age spreads within YMCs. We conclude: the initial\nprotostellar distribution is likely hierarchical; YMCs likely experienced a\nformation history that was dominated by gas exhaustion rather than gas\nexpulsion; YMCs are dynamically stable from a young age; and YMCs have age\nspreads much smaller than their mean age.

For heavy ($\\sim TeV$) DM, the kinetic energy of WIMPs\nin large (galaxy-sized or larger) halos is capable of producing low-energy\npositrons.

However, in addition to resonant\nscattering by neutral gas, the visibility of Lyman alpha is also dependent on\nthe intrinsic properties of the host galaxy, including its stellar population,\ndust content and the nature of outflowing gas. Taking advantage of significant\nprogress we have made in determining the line emitting properties of $z \\simeq\n4-6$ galaxies, we propose an improved method, based on using the measured\nslopes of the rest-frame ultraviolet continua of galaxies, to interpret the\ngrowing body of near-infrared spectra of $z>7$ galaxies in order to take into\naccount these host galaxy dependencies. In a first application of our new\nmethod, we demonstrate its potential via a new spectroscopic survey of $7<z<8$\ngalaxies undertaken with the Keck MOSFIRE spectrograph. Together with earlier\npublished data our data provides improved estimates of the evolving visibility\nof Lyman alpha, particularly at redshift $z\\simeq 8$. As a byproduct, we also\npresent a new line emitting galaxy at a redshift $z=7.62$ which supersedes an\nearlier redshift record.

Our calculations are\ncompletely based on general relativity and especially the structure of neutron\nstars is obtained by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations with\nnuclear matter equation of state constrained by terrestrial experiments. We\nfind that, by considering the more realistic neutron star model rather than a\nsimple uniform neutron sphere as usual, the $\\sigma_{\\rm p}$ bounds from old\nneutron stars can be varied by more than an order of magnitude depending on the\nspecific values of the DM neutron-to-proton coupling ratio $f_{\\rm n}/f_{\\rm\np}$, and they can be further varied by more than a factor of two depending on\nthe density dependence of the symmetry energy.

We focus on properly accounting for the\nvoid-in-cloud effect, i.e., the growth of those voids sitting in over-dense\nregions may be restricted by the evolution of their surroundings. This effect\nmay change the distribution function of voids hence affect predictions on the\ndifferences between modified gravity and GR. We show that the thin-shell\napproximation usually used to calculate the fifth force is qualitatively good\nbut quantitatively inaccurate. Therefore, it is necessary to numerically solve\nthe fifth force in both over-dense and under-dense regions. We then generalise\nthe Eulerian void assignment method of Paranjape, Lam and Sheth (2012) to our\nmodified gravity model. We implement this method in our Monte Carlo simulations\nand compare its results with the original Lagrangian methods. We find that the\nabundances of small voids are significantly reduced in both modified gravity\nand GR due to the restriction of environments. However, the change in void\nabundances for the range of void radii of interest for both models is similar.\nTherefore, the difference between models remains similar to the results from\nthe Lagrangian method, especially if correlated steps of the random walks are\nused.

First, we re-derive the (resummed)\nconsistency conditions at unequal times using the eikonal approximation. These\nare solely based on symmetry arguments and are therefore universal. Then, we\nexplore the existence of equal-time relations in the soft limit which, on the\nother hand, depend on the interplay between soft and hard modes. We scrutinize\ntwo approaches in the literature: The time-flow formalism, and a background\nmethod where the soft mode is absorbed into a locally curved cosmology. The\nlatter has been recently used to set up (angular averaged) `equal-time\nconsistency relations'. We explicitly demonstrate that the time-flow relations\nand `equal-time consistency conditions' are only fulfilled at the linear level,\nand fail at next-to-leading order for an Einstein de-Sitter universe. While\napplied to the velocities both proposals break down beyond leading order, we\nfind that the `equal-time consistency conditions' quantitatively approximates\nthe perturbative results for the density contrast.

The star formation process considerably differs between clouds with\nlower (Z \\le 10^-4 Z_\\odot) and higher (Z > 10^-4 Z_\\odot) metallicities.\nFragmentation frequently occurs and many protostars appear without forming a\nstable circumstellar disc in lower-metallicity clouds. In these clouds,\nalthough protostars mutually interact and some are ejected from the cloud\ncentre, many remain as a small stellar cluster. In contrast, higher-metallicity\nclouds produce a single protostar surrounded by a nearly stable\nrotation-supported disc. In these clouds, although fragmentation occasionally\noccurs in the disc, the fragments migrate inwards and finally fall onto the\ncentral protostar. The difference in cloud evolution is due to different\nthermal evolutions and mass accretion rates. The thermal evolution of the cloud\ndetermines the emergence and lifetime of the first core. The first core\ndevelops prior to the protostar formation in higher-metallicity clouds, whereas\nno (obvious) first core appears in lower-metallicity clouds.

We find\nthat even when the criterion is satisfied, there are instances when planets\nstill do not open gaps. We stress that gap-opening is not only dependent on\nwhether a planet has the ability to open a gap, but whether it can do so\nquickly enough. This can be expressed as an additional condition on the\ngap-opening timescale versus the crossing time, i.e. the time it takes the\nplanet to cross the region which it is carving out. While this point has been\nbriefly made in the previous literature, our results quantify it for a range of\nprotoplanetary disk properties and planetary masses, demonstrating how crucial\nit is for gap-opening.

To separate the effects of bias from\nthose of sampling density, we do the same for voids traced by randomly\ndown-sampled subsets of the simulation dark matter particles. At the same\nsampling density, galaxy bias reduces the total number of voids by ~50% and can\ndramatically change their size distribution. The matter content of voids in\nbiased and unbiased tracers also differs. Deducing void properties from\nsimulation therefore requires the use of realistic galaxy mocks. We discuss how\nthe void observables can be related to their matter content.

The L_[CII]/L_FIR\nratios in the quasar hosts span a wide range from (0.3-4.6)x10^-3, including\none quasar with a ratio that is consistent with local star-forming galaxies. We\nfind that the strength of the L_[CII] and 158 micron continuum emission in z>~6\nquasar hosts correlate with the quasar's bolometric luminosity. In one quasar,\nthe [CII] line is significantly redshifted by ~1700 km/s with respect to the\nMgII broad emission line.

Even as gains are made in mapping the galaxy UV\nluminosity density to z>6, significant uncertainties remain regarding the\nconversion to the implied ionizing emissivity. The relevant unknowns are the\nLyman-continuum (LyC) photon production efficiency xi_{ion} and the escape\nfraction f_{esc}. As we show here, the first of these unknowns is directly\nmeasureable in z=4-5 galaxies, based on the impact the Halpha line has on the\nobserved IRAC fluxes. By computing a LyC photon production rate from the\nimplied Halpha luminosities for a broad selection of z=4-5 galaxies and\ncomparing this against the dust-corrected UV-continuum luminosities, we provide\nthe first-ever direct estimates of the LyC photon production efficiency\nxi_{ion} for the z>~4 galaxy population.

Reassuringly,\nboth values are consistent with standardly assumed xi_{ion}'s in reionization\nmodels, with a slight preference for higher xi_{ion}'s (by ~0.1 dex) adopting\nthe SMC dust law. A modest ~0.03-dex increase in these estimates would result\nif the escape fraction for ionizing photons is non-zero and galaxies dominate\nthe ionizing emissivity at z~4.4.

The mass function of active SMBHs\ndoes not depend on the choice of the radiative efficiency or of the local SMBH\nmass function, but it is mainly determined by the quasar luminosity function,\nonce the Eddington ratio distribution is fixed. Only a direct measurement of\nthe total BHMF at redshifts z>~2 could break these degeneracies giving\nimportant constraints on the average radiative efficiency. Focusing on type-1\nAGN, for which observational estimates of the mass function and Eddington ratio\ndistribution exist at various redshift, models with lower radiative\nefficiencies reproduce better the high-mass end of the mass function at high-z,\nbut they tend to over-predict it at low-z, and vice-versa for models with\nhigher radiative efficiencies. \n\n"}

It is the earliest known galaxy\nwhere the interstellar medium (ISM) has been detected; dust emission was\ndetected with the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA). A1689-zD1 is also\nunusual among high-redshift dust emitters as it is a sub-L* galaxy and is\ntherefore a good prospect for the detection of gaseous ISM in a more typical\ngalaxy at this redshift. We observed A1689-zD1 with ALMA in bands 6 and 7 and\nwith the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in band $Q$. To study the structure of\nA1689-zD1, we map the mm thermal dust emission and find two spatial components\nwith sizes about $0.4-1.7$\\,kpc (lensing-corrected). The rough spatial\nmorphology is similar to what is observed in the near-infrared with {\\it HST}\nand points to a perturbed dynamical state, perhaps indicative of a major merger\nor a disc in early formation.

At the HC strong coupling scale, the classical-scale\ninvariance assumed in the model is dynamically broken as well as the \"chiral\"\nsymmetry present in the HC sector. In addition to the composite Higgs, HC\nbaryons emerge to potentially be stable because of the unbroken HC baryon\nnumber symmetry. Hence the lightest HC baryon can be a DM candidate. Of\ninterest in the present scenario is that HC pions can be as heavy as the HC\nbaryon due to the possibly enhanced-explicit \"chiral\"-breaking effect triggered\nafter the BS mechanism, so the HC baryon pair cannot annihilate into HC pions.\nAs in the standard setup of freeze-in scenario, it is assumed that the DM was\nnever in the thermal equilibrium, which ends up with no thermal abundance. It\nis then the non-thermal BSP process that crucially comes into the game below\nthe HC scale: the HC baryon significantly couples to the standard-model Higgs\nvia the BS mechanism, and can non-thermally be produced from the thermal plasma\nbelow the HC scale, which turns out to allow the TeV mass scale for the\ncomposite baryonic DM, much smaller than the generic bound placed in the\nconventional thermal freeze-out scenario, to account for the observed relic\nabundance.

It turns out that the properties of these models are\nvery similar to the ones of ultralocal theories where the scalar-field value is\ndirectly determined by the local matter density. This leads to a complete\nscreening of the fifth force in the Solar System and between compact objects,\nthrough the ultralocal screening mechanism.

Recently, however, the hypothesis that the BH\ninterior does not exist has been gaining traction, as it provides a means for\nresolving the BH information-loss problem. Here, we propose a simple method for\nanswering the following question: Does the BH interior exist and, if so, does\nit contain some distribution of matter or is it mostly empty? Our proposal is\npremised on the idea that, similar to the case of relativistic, ultra-compact\nstars, any BH-like object whose interior has some matter distribution should\nsupport fluid modes in addition to the conventional spacetime modes. In\nparticular, the Coriolis-induced Rossby (r-) modes, whose spectrum is mostly\ninsensitive to the composition of the interior matter, should be a universal\nfeature of such BH-like objects. In fact, the frequency and damping time of\nthese modes are determined by only the object's mass and speed of rotation.

The method\nwas shown to be accurate in moderate sized simulations with galaxy images that\nhad relatively high signal-to-noise ratios, and without significant selection\neffects. In this work we introduce a formalism to correct for both shear\nresponse and selection biases. We also observe that, for images with relatively\nlow signal-to-noise ratios, the correlated noise that arises during the\nmetacalibration process results in significant bias, for which we develop a\nsimple empirical correction. To test this formalism, we created large image\nsimulations based on both parametric models and real galaxy images, including\ntests with realistic point-spread functions. We varied the point-spread\nfunction ellipticity at the five percent level. In each simulation we applied a\nsmall, few percent shear to the galaxy images.

Our method is novel: we perform halo finding inline with\nthe radiation hydrodynamical simulation, and assign escaping ionizing fluxes to\nhalos using a probability distribution function (PDF) measured from the\ngalaxy-resolving Renaissance Simulations.

Such flattening does not appear at\nhigher redshifts. We provide redshift-dependent fitting functions for the\nSFR-M_halo, SFR-M_star, and broad-band magnitude-stellar mass relations. We\nderive the star formation rate density and stellar mass density at z=5-12 and\nshow that the contribution from very faint galaxies becomes more important at\nz>8. Furthermore, we find that the decline in the z~6 UV luminosity function\nbrighter than M_1500~-20 is largely due to dust attenuation. Approximately 37%\n(54%) of the UV luminosity from galaxies brighter than M_1500=-13 (-17) is\nobscured by dust at z~6. Our results broadly agree with current data and can be\ntested by future observations. \n\n"}

The Hierachical Bound-Tracing (HBT) code identifies halos as they\nform and tracks their evolution as they merge, simultaneously detecting\nsubhalos and building their merger trees. Here we present a new implementation\nof this approach, HBT+, that is much faster, more user friendly, and more\nphysically complete than the original code. Applying HBT+ to cosmological\nsimulations we show that both the subhalo mass function and the peak-mass\nfunction are well fit by similar double-Schechter functions.The ratio between\nthe two is highest at the high mass end, reflecting the resilience of massive\nsubhalos that experience substantial dynamical friction but limited tidal\nstripping. The radial distribution of the most massive subhalos is more\nconcentrated than the universal radial distribution of lower mass subhalos.\nSubhalo finders that work in configuration space tend to underestimate the\nmasses of massive subhalos, an effect that is stronger in the host centre. This\nmay explain, at least in part, the excess of massive subhalos in galaxy cluster\ncentres inferred from recent lensing observations.

Based on this comprehensive\nsearch, we find that the UV luminosity function decreases by one order of\nmagnitude from z~8 to z~10 at all luminosities over a four magnitude range.\nThis also implies a decrease of the cosmic star-formation rate density by an\norder of magnitude within 170 Myr from z~8 to z~10.

This has motivated\nthe recent proposal of a novel ruler, also located in the Baryon Acoustic\nOscillation range of scales of the correlation function, dubbed the \"linear\npoint\". Unlike the peak, it is insensitive at the $0.5\\%$ level to many of the\nnon-linear effects that distort the clustering correlation function and shift\nthe peak.

One possible\nmodification to General Relativity is the gravitational parity violation that\ngives rise to the amplitude birefringence in gravitational waves, where one of\nthe circularly-polarized mode is amplified while the other one is suppressed\nduring their propagation. In this paper, we study how well one can measure\ngravitational parity violation via the amplitude birefringence of gravitational\nwaves from stellar-mass black hole binaries. We choose Chern-Simons gravity as\nan example and work within an effective field theory formalism. We consider\ngravitational waves from both individual sources and stochastic gravitational\nwave backgrounds. Regarding bounds from individual sources, we estimate them\nusing a Fisher analysis and carry out Monte Carlo simulations by randomly\ndistributing sources over their sky location and binary orientation. We find\nthat the bounds on the scalar field evolution in Chern-Simons gravity from\nGW150914 are too weak to satisfy the weak Chern-Simons approximation, while\naLIGO with its design sensitivity can place meaningful bounds. Regarding bounds\nfrom stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, we set the threshold\nsignal-to-noise ratio for detection of the parity-violation mode as 5 and\nestimate projected bounds with future detectors assuming that signals are\nconsistent with no parity violation. We find that a network of two\nthird-generation detectors is able to place bounds that are slightly stronger\nthan current binary pulsar bounds. Since gravitational wave observations probe\neither the difference in parity violation between the source and the detector\nor the line-of-sight integration of the scalar field, such bounds are\ncomplementary to local measurements from solar system experiments and binary\npulsar observations. \n\n"}

Owing to the suppression of galaxy growth via\nstrong feedback, our galaxies are in good agreement with observational\nestimates of the galaxy luminosity function. We find that binaries have a\nsignificant impact on the timing of reionization: with binaries, our boxes are\n$99.9$ percent ionized by volume at $z\\approx 7$, while without them our\nvolumes fail to reionize by $z=6$. These results are robust to changes in\nvolume size, resolution, and feedback efficiency. The escape of ionizing\nradiation from individual galaxies varies strongly and frequently. On average,\nbinaries lead to escape fractions of $\\approx 7-10$ percent, about $3.5$ times\nhigher than with single stars only. The higher escape fraction is a result of a\nshallower decline in ionizing luminosity with age, and is the primary reason\nfor earlier reionization, although the higher integrated luminosity with\nbinaries also plays a sub-dominant role. \n\n"}

Here, we compare four hydrodynamical schemes in\nidealized simulations of a rising bubble inflated by AGN feedback in a hot\nstratified ICM: (traditional) smoothed particle hydrodynamics (TSPH), a\npressure flavour of SPH (PSPH), a meshless finite mass (MFM) scheme, as well as\nan Eulerian code with adaptive mesh refinement. In the absence of magnetic\nfields, the bubble is Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable on short enough time scales to\ndissolve it fully in the ICM, which is captured by MFM and RAMSES simulations,\nwhile in the TSPH simulation the bubble survives. When the ICM is turbulent,\nmixing of the bubble with the ICM is accelerated. This occurs if the numerical\nscheme can capture the instabilities well. The differences in the evolution of\nthe bubble has a surprisingly small influence on the thermal structure of the\nICM. However, in the simulations with MFM and RAMSES the bubble disruption\nleads to turbulent stirring of the ICM which is suppressed in SPH.

As in the case of inflation, the conformal\ninvariance of the electromagnetic action needs to be broken in bouncing\nscenarios in order to generate primordial magnetic fields which correspond to\nobserved strengths today. The non-minimal coupling, which typically depends on\na scalar field that possibly drives the homogeneous background, leads to a\ncross-correlation at the level of the three-point function between the\nperturbation in the scalar field and the magnetic fields.

We\nemploy a semi-analytical approach to study the spherical collapse of dark\nmatter haloes in symmetron gravity and provide insights into how the\nphenomenology of splashback is affected. The symmetron is a scalar-tensor\ntheory of gravity which exhibits a screening mechanism whereby higher-density\nregions are screened from the effects of a fifth force. In this model, we find\nthat, as over-densities grow over cosmic time, the inner region becomes heavily\nscreened. In particular, we identify a sector of the parameter space for which\nmaterial currently sitting at $r_\\mathrm{sp}$ has followed, during the\ncollapse, the formation of this screened region. As a result, we find that for\nthis part of the parameter space the splashback radius is maximally affected by\nthe symmetron force and we predict changes in $r_\\mathrm{sp}$ up to around\n$10\\%$ compared to its General Relativity value.

The observations began when the source was still relatively bright,\nand, during one of the early observations, a QPO with a non-Lorentzian profile\noccurred near 6 Hz. As the source decayed, the X-ray flux dropped exponentially\nwith an e-folding time of 14.4 d.

We have decomposed the images into contributions from a\nspheroidal bulge and a flat disk, using an interactive, 2D decomposition\ntechnique.\n  We study in detail the relations between various bulge and disk parameters.\nIn particular, we find that the bulges of our galaxies have surface brightness\nprofiles ranging from exponential to De Vaucouleurs, with the average value of\nthe Sersic shape parameter n being 2.5. In agreement with previous studies, we\nfind that the shape of the bulge intensity distribution depends on luminosity,\nwith the more luminous bulges having more centrally peaked light profiles. By\ncomparing the ellipticity of the isophotes in the bulges to those in the outer,\ndisk dominated regions, we are able to derive the intrinsic axis ratio q_b of\nthe bulges. The average axis ratio is 0.55, with an rms spread of 0.12. None of\nthe bulges in our sample is spherical, whereas in some cases, the bulges can be\nas flat as q_b = 0.3 - 0.4.

Taking\ninto account the turbulent enhancement of the field by inverse cascade, we\nestimate that colliding electroweak bubbles would give rise to a mean field\n$B_{rms}\\simeq 10^{-21}$ G at 10 Mpc comoving scale today. \n\n"}

They\nhave been argued to form axionic boson stars with small masses\n$10^{-14}M_{\\odot}\\sim 10^{-11}M_{\\odot}$. Since they possess oscillating\nelectric fields in a magnetic field, they dissipate their energies in\nmagnetized conducting media such as white dwarfs or neutron stars. At the same\ntime the oscillating electric fields generate a monochromatic radiation with\nenergy equal to mass of the axion. We argue that the effect of the energy\ndissipation can be seen in the old white dwarfs. In particular, We show that\ncolliding with sufficiently cooled white dwarfs, plausible candidates of MACHO,\nthe axionic boson stars dissipate their energies in the dwarfs and heat up the\ndwarfs. Consequently the white dwarfs in the halo can emit detectable amount of\nthermal radiations with the collision. On the other hand, the monochromatic\nradiations can be seen only during the collision; a period of the dwarf passing\nthe axionic boson star. Assuming that MACHO are dark white dwarfs, we show that\nthere is a threshold in luminosity function of the white dwarfs below which the\nnumber of the white dwarfs in the halo increase discontinuously. The threshold\nin the luminosity function is expected to be located around\n$10^{-5.5}L_{\\odot}\\sim 10^{-7}L_{\\odot}$. Its precise value is determined by\nthe mass of the axionic boson stars dominant in the halo. \n\n"}

This has often been assumed to take continuous values, but we argue\nthat it has a generalized Dirac quantization condition. For a single flux the\nsteps are much larger than the observational limit, but we show that with\nmultiple fluxes the allowed values can form a sufficiently dense `discretuum'.\nMultiple fluxes generally arise in M theory compactifications on manifolds with\nnon-trivial three-cycles. In theories with large extra dimensions a few\nfour-forms suffice; otherwise of order 100 are needed. Starting from generic\ninitial conditions, the repeated nucleation of membranes dynamically generates\nregions with a cosmological constant in the observational range.

The fibers and the coupler are polarization-preserving to guarantee a\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio. When the two input fibers are used to collect the\nscattered light with the same momentum transfer vector but from two spatially\nseparated regions in a flow, the obtained signals interfere when combined via\nthe fiber-optic coupler. The resultant light received by a photomultiplier tube\ncontains a cross-beat frequency proportional to the velocity difference between\nthe two measuring points. If the two input fibers are used to collect the\nscattered light from a common scattering region but with two different momentum\ntransfer vectors, the resultant light then contains a self-beat frequency\nproportional to the local velocity at the measuring point. The experiment shows\nthat both the cross-beat and self-beat signals are large and the standard laser\nDoppler signal processor can be used to measure the velocity difference and\nlocal velocity in real time. The new technique will have various applications\nin the general area of fluid dynamics. \n\n"}
