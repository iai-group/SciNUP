Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is\ncomplicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the\ndistribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events\n-- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior\nholds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as\nleast-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of\nparameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods\nreturn accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no\nindication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a\nprincipled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law\nbehavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting\nmethods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic\nand likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests\non synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also\napply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of\ndifferent disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law\ndistribution.

Many studies have focused on regions where the dark matter\ndensity is greatest, e.g., the Galactic Center, as well as on the cosmic signal\narising from all halos in the Universe. We focus on the signal arising from the\nwhole Milky Way halo; this is less sensitive to uncertainties in the dark\nmatter distribution, and especially for flatter profiles, this halo signal is\nlarger than the cosmic signal.

(2) OHM hosts are a distinct population in the\nnonlinear part of the IR-CO relation. (3) OHM hosts have exceptionally high\ndense molecular gas fractions, L(HCN)/L(CO)>0.07, and comprise roughly half of\nthis unusual population. OH absorbers and kilomasers generally follow the\nlinear IR-CO relation and are uniformly distributed in dense gas fraction and\nL(HCN), demonstrating that OHMs are independent of OH abundance. The fraction\nof non-OHMs with high mean densities and high dense gas fractions constrains\nbeaming to be a minor effect: OHM emission solid angle must exceed 2 pi\nsteradians. Contrary to conventional wisdom, IR luminosity does not dictate OHM\nformation; both star formation and OHM activity are consequences of tidal\ndensity enhancements accompanying galaxy interactions. The OHM fraction in\nstarbursts is likely due to the fraction of mergers experiencing a temporal\nspike in tidally driven density enhancement. OHMs are thus signposts marking\nthe most intense, compact, and unusual modes of star formation in the local\nuniverse.

An ADAF is a poor radiator, and the ion temperature can approach\n10^{12} K near the center, although the electrons are cooler, with their\ntemperature typically capped at ~10^{9-11} K. The foundational papers predicted\nthat the large thermal energy in an ADAF would drive strong winds and jets, as\nlater observed and also confirmed in computer simulations. Of chief interest,\nhowever, is the accreting gas that races inward. It carries the bulk of the\naccretion energy as stored thermal energy, which vanishes without a trace as\nthe gas passes through the hole's event horizon. One thus expects black holes\nin the ADAF regime to be unusually faint. Indeed, this is confirmed by a\ncomparison of accreting stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars, which\nreside in very similar transient X-ray binary systems. The black holes are on\naverage observed to be fainter by a factor of ~100-1000.

The fraction of\ngalaxies with early-type morphologies increases monotonically with M_B\nluminosity and stellar mass and with cosmic epoch.

There is a clear\nmorphology-density relation in the Centaurus A Group, similarly to the Sculptor\nand Local Groups, in the sense that dEs/dSphs tend to be at small distances\nfrom the more massive galaxies of the group, while dIs are on average at larger\ndistances. We find four transition dwarfs in the Group, dwarfs that show\ncharacteristics of both dE/dSphs and dIs, and which contain cold gas but no\ncurrent star formation.

We aim to extend this investigation well down into\nthe substellar regime for our large sample of BDs in the Orion Nebula Cluster,\nfor which we have recently measured rotational periods.

Typically if the wavelength of the\nobservation is comparable to the Schwarzschild radius of lensing object,\ndiffraction leaves an observable imprint on the lensing signature. The\ncommissioning of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) over the next decade begs the\nquestion of whether it will become possible to follow up lensing events with\nradio observations because the SKA may have sufficient sensitivity to detect\nthe typical sources, giant stars in the bulge.

In this approximation, the initial\nabundances chosen, which are totally atomic in nature except for molecular\nhydrogen, are artificial. A more detailed approach to the chemistry of dense\ncold cores should include the physical evolution during their early stages of\nformation. Aims: Our major goal is to investigate the initial synthesis of\nmolecular ices and gas-phase molecules as cold molecular gas begins to form\nbehind a shock in the diffuse interstellar medium. The abundances calculated as\nthe conditions evolve can then be utilized as reasonable initial conditions for\na theory of the chemistry of dense cores.

We\nfollow the cold post-shock molecular evolution of ices and gas-phase molecules\nfor a range of visual extinction up to AV ~ 3, which increases with time. At\nhigher extinction, self-gravity becomes important. Results: As the newly\ncondensed gas enters its cool post-shock phase, a large amount of CO is\nproduced in the gas. As the CO forms, water ice is produced on grains, while\naccretion of CO produces CO ice. The production of CO2 ice from CO occurs via\nseveral surface mechanisms, while the production of CH4 ice is slowed by\ngas-phase conversion of C into CO. \n\n"}

We deduce a sharp difference in\nabundances for sightlines located at low ($|b|<30\\degr$) and high\n($|b|>30\\degr$) galactic latitudes. For high-latitude stars the ratios Mg/Si\nand Fe/Si in dust are close to 1.5. For disk stars they are reduced to ${\\rm\nMg/Si} \\sim 1.2$ and ${\\rm Fe/Si} \\sim 1.05$. The derived numbers indicate that\n1) the dust grains cannot be the mixture of silicates with olivine and pyroxene\ncomposition only and some amount of magnesium or iron (or both) should be in\nanother population and 2) the destruction of Mg-rich grains in the warm medium\nis more effective than of Fe-rich grains. We reveal a decrease of dust-phase\nabundances and correspondingly an increase of gas-phase abundances with\ndistance $D$ for stars with $D\\ga 400$\\,pc.

Disk\n  structure and evolution Abstract: We perform a comparative numerical hydrodynamics study of embedded\nprotostellar disks formed as a result of the gravitational collapse of cloud\ncores of distinct mass (M_cl=0.2--1.7 M_sun) and ratio of rotational to\ngravitational energy (\\beta=0.0028--0.023). An increase in M_cl and/or \\beta\nleads to the formation of protostellar disks that are more susceptible to\ngravitational instability. Disk fragmentation occurs in most models but its\neffect is often limited to the very early stage, with the fragments being\neither dispersed or driven onto the forming star during tens of orbital\nperiods. Only cloud cores with high enough M_cl or \\beta may eventually form\nwide-separation binary/multiple systems with low mass ratios and brown dwarf or\nsub-solar mass companions. It is feasible that such systems may eventually\nbreak up, giving birth to rogue brown dwarfs. Protostellar disks of {\\it equal}\nage formed from cloud cores of greater mass (but equal \\beta) are generally\ndenser, hotter, larger, and more massive. On the other hand, protostellar disks\nformed from cloud cores of higher \\beta (but equal M_cl) are generally thinner\nand colder but larger and more massive. In all models, the difference between\nthe irradiation temperature and midplane temperature \\triangle T is small,\nexcept for the innermost regions of young disks, dense fragments, and disk's\nouter edge where \\triangle T is negative and may reach a factor of two or even\nmore.

Additionally, the delay time distribution of\nthe sub-Chandrasekhar model can be divided in to two distinct evolutionary\nchannels: the `prompt' helium-star channel with delay times < 500 Myr, and the\n`delayed' double white dwarf channel with delay times > 800 Myr spanning up to\na Hubble time. These findings are in agreement with recent\nobservationally-derived delay time distributions which predict that a large\nnumber of SNe Ia have delay times < 1 Gyr, with a significant fraction having\ndelay times < 500 Myr.

The most popular interpretation of the MSP is that\nthe smallest dark matter halos in the universe are extremely inefficient at\nforming stars. The question from that standpoint is to identify the feedback\nsource that makes small halos dark and to identify any obvious mass scale where\nthe truncation in the efficiency of galaxy formation occurs. Among the most\nexciting developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery\nof a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide\nfield, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite count\nin less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint galaxies that are\nless luminous that some star clusters.

We\nresolve the emission from the protostar radio Source I and BN at several\nepochs. Source I is highly elongated NW-SE, and remarkably stable in flux\ndensity, position angle, and overall morphology over nearly a decade. This\nfavors the extended emission component arising from an ionized disk rather than\na jet. We have measured the proper motions of Source I and BN for the first\ntime at 43 GHz. We confirm that both sources are moving at high speed (12 and\n26 km/s, respectively) approximately in opposite directions, as previously\ninferred from measurements at lower frequencies. We discuss dynamical scenarios\nthat can explain the large motions of both BN and Source I and the presence of\ndisks around both. Our new measurements support the hypothesis that a close\n(~50 AU) dynamical interaction occurred around 500 years ago between Source I\nand BN as proposed by Gomez et al. From the dynamics of encounter we argue that\nSource I today is likely to be a binary with a total mass on the order of 20\nMsun, and that it probably existed as a softer binary before the close\nencounter. This enables preservation of the original accretion disk, though\ntruncated to its present radius of ~50 AU. N-body numerical simulations show\nthat the dynamical interaction between a binary of 20 Msun total mass (I) and a\nsingle star of 10 Msun mass (BN) may lead to the ejection of both and binary\nhardening. The gravitational energy released in the process would be large\nenough to power the wide-angle flow traced by H2 and CO emission in the BN/KL\nnebula. Assuming the proposed dynamical history is correct, the smaller mass\nfor Source I recently estimated from SiO maser dynamics (>7 Msun) by Matthews\net al., suggests that non-gravitational forces (e.g. magnetic) must play an\nimportant role in the circumstellar gas dynamics. \n\n"}

In the first stage - the growth from dust to\nkilometer sized planetesimals - the aerodynamics of the bodies are of central\nimportance. We discuss both a purely coagulative growth mode, as well as a\ngravoturbulent mode involving a gravitational instability of the dust. In the\nnext stage, planetesimals grow to protoplanets of roughly 1000 km in size.\nGravity is now the dominant force.

The highest energies (\\sim 10^{49} erg)\npredicted so far come from a model [K. Ioka, Mon. Not. Roy. Astron. Soc. 327,\n639 (2001)] in which the internal magnetic field of a magnetar experiences a\nglobal reconfiguration, changing the hydromagnetic equilibrium structure of the\nstar and tapping the gravitational potential energy without changing the\nmagnetic potential energy. The largest energies in this model assume very\nspecial conditions, including a large change in moment of inertia (which was\nobserved in at most one flare), a very high internal magnetic field, and a very\nsoft equation of state.

In each case, we directly resolve a dust-depleted disk\ncavity around the central star. Using radiative transfer calculations, we\ninterpret these dust disk structures in a homogeneous, parametric model\nframework by reproducing their SMA visibilities and SEDs. The cavities in these\ndisks are large (R_cav = 15-73 AU) and substantially depleted of small\n(~um-sized) dust grains, although their mass contents are still uncertain. The\nstructures of the remnant material at larger radii are comparable to normal\ndisks. We demonstrate that these large cavities are common among the\nmillimeter-bright disk population, comprising at least 20% of the disks in the\nbright half of the millimeter luminosity (disk mass) distribution.

We provide an interpretation of the formation of these\nbinaries that explains the total number formed and their distribution of\nenergies. A population of weakly bound binaries can always be found in the\ncluster, in accordance with statistical detailed balance, limited at the soft\nend only by the current size of the cluster and whatever observational criteria\nare imposed. At any given time, the observed soft binary distribution is\npredominantly a snapshot of a transient population.

The total number of wide binaries that form, and their\nenergy distribution, are insensitive to the cluster population; the number is\napproximately one per cluster. This suggests that a population composed of many\ndissolved small-N clusters will more efficiently populate the field with wide\nbinaries than that composed of dissolved large-N clusters.

The\nmotivation comes from the fact that super magnetized neutron stars of $\\sim\n10^{15}$G, magnetars, and magnetized proto-neutron stars born after the\nmagnetically-driven supernovae are likely to have such strong toroidal magnetic\nfields. Long-term, three-dimensional general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic\nsimulations are performed, preparing isentropic neutron stars with toroidal\nmagnetic fields in equilibrium as initial conditions. To explore the effects of\nrotations on the stability, simulations are done for both non-rotating and\nrigidly rotating models. We find the emergence of the Parker and/or Tayler\ninstabilities in both the non-rotating and rotating models. For both\nnon-rotating and rotating models, the Parker instability is the primary\ninstability as predicted by the local linear perturbation analysis. The\ninterchange instability also appears in the rotating models. It is found that\nrapid rotation is not enough to suppress the Parker instability, and this\nfinding does not agree with the perturbation analysis. The reason for this is\nthat rigidly and rapidly rotating stars are marginally stable, and hence, in\nthe presence of stellar pulsations by which the rotational profile is deformed,\nunstable regions with negative gradient of angular momentum profile is\ndeveloped. After the onset of the instabilities, a turbulence is excited.\nContrary to the axisymmetric case, the magnetic fields never reach an\nequilibrium state after the development of the turbulence.

We identify evolved stars using a combination\nof near-IR and mid-IR photometry and point out a new feature in the mid-IR\ncolor-magnitude diagram that may be due to particularly dusty O-rich AGB stars.\nWe find that the RSG and AGB stars each contribute ~20% of the global SMC flux\n(extended + point-source) at 3.6 microns, which emphasizes the importance of\nboth stellar types to the integrated flux of distant metal-poor galaxies. The\nequivalent SAGE survey of the higher-metallicity Large Magellanic Cloud\n(SAGE-LMC) allows us to explore the influence of metallicity on dust\nproduction. We find that the SMC RSG stars are less likely to produce a large\namount of dust (as indicated by the [3.6]-[8] color). There is a higher\nfraction of carbon-rich stars in the SMC, and these stars appear to able to\nreach colors as red as their LMC counterparts, indicating that C-rich dust\nforms efficiently in both galaxies. A preliminary estimate of the dust\nproduction in AGB and RSG stars reveals that the extreme C-rich AGB stars\ndominate the dust input in both galaxies, and that the O-rich stars may play a\nlarger role in the LMC than in the SMC. \n\n"}

CO fundamental emission is a potentially powerful probe of\nthe disk/wind structure within a few AU of young protostars. In this paper, we\npresent high spectral (R=90,000) and spatial (0.3\") resolution VLT/CRIRES\nM-band spectra of 18 low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) with dense envelopes\nin nearby star-froming regions to explore the utility of CO fundamental 4.6\nmicron emission as a probe of very young disks. CO fundamental emission is\ndetected from 14 of the YSOs in our sample. The emission line profiles show a\nrange of strengths and shapes, but can generally be classified into a broad,\nwarm component and a narrow, cool component. The broad CO emission is detected\nmore frequently from YSOs with bolometric luminosities of <15 Lsun than those\nwith >15 Lsun, and as with CO emission from CTTSs is attributed to the warm\n(~1000 K) inner AU of the disk. The CO emission from objects with high\nbolometric luminosity is produced in cooler (~320 K), narrow lines in 12CO and\nin rarer isotopologues. From some objects, the narrow lines are blueshifted by\nup to ~10 km/s, indicating a slow wind origin. For other sources the lines are\nlocated at the systemic velocity of the star and likely arise in the disk. For\na few YSOs, spatially-extended CO and H2 S(9) emission is detected up to 2\"\nfrom the central source and is attributed to interactions between the wind and\nsurrounding molecular material. Warm CO absorption is detected in the wind of\nsix objects with velocities up to 100 km/s, often in discrete velocity\ncomponents. That the wind is partially molecular where it is launched favors\nejection in a disk wind rather than a coronal or chromospheric wind. \n\n"}

Using linear\nperturbation theory, we analyze the observable properties of the gravitational\nwake due to the object circularly moving in a static homogeneous gaseous\nmedium, in order to derive the Bondi accretion radius $r_B$, the orbital\ndistance $r_p$, and the Mach number of the object. Supersonic motion, producing\na wake of spiral-onion shell structure, exhibits a single-armed Archimedes\nspiral and two-centered circular arcs with respect to the line of sight. The\npitch angle, arm width, and spacing of the spiral pattern are entirely\ndetermined by the orbital distance $r_p$ and Mach number of the object. The\narm-interarm density contrast is proportional to the Bondi accretion radius,\ndecreasing as a function of distance with a power index of -1. The background\ndensity distribution is globally changed from initially uniform to centrally\nconcentrated. The vertical structure of the wake is manifested as circular arcs\nwith the center at the object location. The angular extent of the arcs is\ndetermined by the Mach number of the object motion. Diagnostic probes of\nnonlinear wakes such as a detached bow shock, an absence of the definite inner\narm boundary, the presence of turbulent low density eddies, and elongated\nshapes of arcs are explained in the extension of the linear analysis. The\ndensity enhancement at the center is always $r_B/r_p$ independent of the\nnonlinearity, suggesting that massive objects can substantially modify the\nbackground distribution. These detailed understanding of the wake\ncharacteristics will provide an interpretative framework for both further\ntheoretical works under more complicated situations and future observations to\ndetect the gravitational wakes of hidden objects. \n\n"}

This is closely related to\nthe fact that correlation functions can only depend on the de Sitter invariant\ndistances. These properties follow from the isometries of the inflationary de\nSitter space and are thus completely independent of the dynamics. The 3-point\nfunction is fixed in terms of two constants, while the 4-point function is a\nfunction of two parameters (instead of five as in the absence of conformal\ninvariance). The conformal invariance of correlators can be directly checked in\nFourier space, as we show in an explicit example.

Irradiation is\nknown to weaken the strength of disc self-gravity, and can suppress it entirely\nif the disc is maintained above the threshold for linear instability. However,\nits impact on the susceptibility of the disc to fragmentation is less clear. We\nuse two-dimensional numerical simulations to investigate the evolution of\nself-gravitating discs as a function of the local cooling time and strength of\nirradiation. In the regime where the disc does not fragment, we show that local\nthermal equilibrium continues to determine the stress - which can be\nrepresented as an effective viscous alpha - out to very long cooling times (at\nleast 240 dynamical times). In this regime, the power spectrum of the\nperturbations is uniquely set by the effective viscous alpha and not by the\ncooling rate. Fragmentation occurs for cooling times tau < beta_crit / Omega,\nwhere beta_crit is a weak function of the level of irradiation. We find that\nbeta_crit declines by approximately a factor of two, as irradiation is\nincreased from zero up to the level where instability is almost quenched. The\nnumerical results imply that irradiation cannot generally avert fragmentation\nof self-gravitating discs at large radii; if other angular momentum transport\nsources are weak mass will build up until self-gravity sets in, and\nfragmentation will ensue. \n\n"}

Abstract: Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) are galaxies that have been selected on the basis\nof a strong Ly{\\alpha} emission line in their spectra. Observational campaigns\nhave dramatically increased the sample of known LAEs, which now extends out to\nz=7. These discoveries have motivated numerous theoretical studies on the\nsubject, which usually define LAEs in their models based on sharp Ly{\\alpha}\nluminosity and equivalent width (EW) cuts. While broadly representative, this\nprocedure does not mimic the selection from observational programs in detail,\nwhich instead use cuts in various colour-spaces. We investigate what\nimplications this disjoint may have for studies that aim to model LAEs. We\nconstruct an empirical model for the number density of star forming galaxies as\na function of their UV and Ly{\\alpha} luminosity, utilising measured\nconstraints on the luminosity functions (LFs) of drop-out galaxies, and their\nluminosity dependent probability distribution function of Ly{\\alpha} EW. In\nparticular, we investigate whether the LAE LFs can be reproduced by defining\nLAEs using a (z-dependent) Ly{\\alpha} luminosity and EW threshold. While we are\nable to reproduce the observed distribution of Ly{\\alpha} EW among LAEs out to\nrestframe EW 200 A, we find that our formalism over-predicts both the UV and\nLy{\\alpha} LFs of LAEs by a factor of 2-3, and is inconsistent with\nobservations at the ~95% level. This tension is partially resolved if we assume\nthe Ly{\\alpha} EW-distribution of drop-out galaxies to be truncated at\nrestframe EW>150 A. However the overprediction indicates that modeling LAEs\nwith simple REW and luminosity cuts does not accurately mimic observed\nselection criteria, and can lead to uncertainties in the predicted number\ndensity of LAEs. On the other hand, the predicted z-evolution is not affected.\nWe apply our formalism to drop-out galaxies at z>6, and predict the LFs of LAEs\nat z=7-9. \n\n"}

The sample stars clearly trace a typical thick disk population with\npeaks at |Z|=1.26 kpc and [Fe/H]=-0.54. The vertical metallicity gradient of\nthe thick disk is estimated in two ways.

We\nanalytically show that observations of piecewise-spiral fronts impose strong\nconstraints on the CC, implying the presence of a cold, fast flow, which\npropagates below a hot, slow inflow, separated by a slowly rotating, trailing,\nquasi spiral, tangential discontinuity surface. This leads to the nearly\nlogarithmic spiral pattern, two-phase plasma, \\rho \\sim r^{-1} density (or T\n\\sim r^{0.4} temperature) radial profile, and ~100kpc size, characteristic of\nCCs. By advecting heat and mixing the gas, such flows can eliminate the cooling\nproblem, provided that a feedback mechanism regulates the flow.

We use numerical simulations of merging\ndisc galaxies to investigate which mechanism dominates. The simulations include\na model for the formation and dynamical disruption of the entire star cluster\npopulation. We find that the dynamical heating of clusters by tidal shocks is\nabout an order of magnitude higher in interacting galaxies than in isolated\ngalaxies. This is driven by the increased gas density, and is sufficient to\ndestroy star clusters at a higher rate than new clusters are formed: the total\nnumber of clusters in the merger remnant is 2-50% of the amount in the\nprogenitor discs, with low-mass clusters being disrupted preferentially. By\nadopting observationally motivated selection criteria, we find that the\nobserved surplus of star clusters in nearby merging galaxies is caused by the\nbias to detect young, massive clusters. We provide a general expression for the\nsurvival fraction of clusters, which increases with the gas depletion\ntime-scale. Due to the preferential disruption of low-mass clusters, the mass\ndistribution of the surviving star clusters in a merger remnant develops a peak\nat a mass of about 10^3 Msun, which evolves to higher masses at a rate of\n0.3-0.4 dex per Gyr. The peak mass initially depends weakly on the\ngalactocentric radius, but this correlation disappears as the system ages. We\ndiscuss the similarities between the cluster populations of the simulated\nmerger remnants and (young) globular cluster systems. Our results suggest that\nthe combination of cluster formation and destruction should be widespread in\nthe dense star-forming environments at high redshifts, which could provide a\nnatural origin to present-day globular cluster systems. \n\n"}

Under the assumption\nthat mm-wave emission of disks is mostly optically thin, these data have been\ngenerally interpreted as evidence for the presence of mm/cm-sized pebbles in\nthe disk outer regions. In this work we investigate the effect of possible\nlocal optically thick regions on the mm-wave emission of protoplanetary disks\nwithout mm/cm-sized grains. A significant local increase of the optical depth\nin the disk can be caused by the concentration of solid particles, as predicted\nto result from a variety of proposed physical mechanisms. We calculate the\nfilling factors and implied overdensities these optically thick regions would\nneed to significantly affect the millimeter fluxes of disks, and we discuss\ntheir plausibility. We find that optically thick regions characterized by\nrelatively small filling factors can reproduce the mm-data of young disks\nwithout requesting emission from mm/cm-sized pebbles. However, these optically\nthick regions require dust overdensities much larger than what predicted by any\nof the physical processes proposed in the literature to drive the concentration\nof solids.

Theoretical studies encounter difficulties in\nexplaining their formation and origin. Here we propose a novel scenario for the\nproduction of planetary systems at such orbits, through the dynamical recapture\nof free floating planets (FFPs) in dispersing stellar clusters. This process is\na natural extension of the recently suggested scenario for the formation of\nwide stellar binaries. We use N-body simulations of dispersing clusters with\n10-1000 stars and comparable numbers of FFPs to study this process. We find\nthat planets are captured into wide orbits in the typical range ~100-10^6 AU,\nand have a wide range of eccentricities (thermal distribution). Typically, 3-6\nx (f_FFP/1) % of all stars capture a planetary companion with such properties\n(where f_FFP is the number of FFP per star). The planetary capture efficiency\nis comparable to that of capture-formed stellar-binaries, and shows a similar\ndependence on the cluster size and structure. It is almost independent of the\nspecific planetary mass; planets as well as sub-stellar companions of any mass\ncan be captured. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster size,\nand for a given cluster size the it increases with the host/primary mass. More\nthan one planet can be captured around the same host and planets can be\ncaptured into binary systems. Planets can also be captured into pre-existing\nplanetary and into orbits around black holes and massive white dwarfs, if these\nformed early enough before the cluster dispersal. In particular, stellar black\nholes have a high capture efficiency (>50 % and 5-10 x (f_FFP/1) % for capture\nof stars and planetary companions, respectively) due to their large mass.\nFinally, although rare, two FFPs or brown dwarfs can become bound and form a\nFFP-binary system with no stellar host. \n\n"}

The operator product expansion is\nparticularly powerful in characterizing inflationary correlation functions in\ntwo observationally interesting limits, the squeezed limit of the three-point\ncorrelator and the collapsed limit of the four-point correlator. Despite the\nfact that the shape of the four-point correlators is not fixed by the\nsymmetries of de Sitter, its exact shape can be found in the collapsed limit\nmaking use of the operator product expansion. By employing the fact that\nconformal invariance imposes the two-point cross-correlations of the light\nfields to vanish unless the fields have the same conformal weights, we are able\nto show that the Suyama-Yamaguchi inequality relating the coefficients $f_{\\rm\nNL}$ of the bispectrum in the squeezed limit and $\\tau_{\\rm NL}$ of the\ntrispectrum in the collapsed limit also holds when the light fields are\nintrinsically non-Gaussian.

The observed dearth of nearby ($\\leq 5$ AU) brown dwarf companions to\nsolar-mass stars, known as the brown dwarf desert, as well as the tendency for\nlow-mass binary systems to be more tightly-bound than stellar binaries, have\nbeen cited as evidence for distinct formation mechanisms for brown dwarfs and\nstars. In this paper, we explore the implications of the minimal hypothesis\nthat brown dwarfs in binary systems originate via the same fundamental\nfragmentation mechanism as stars, within isolated, turbulent giant molecular\ncloud cores. We demonstrate analytically that the scaling of specific angular\nmomentum with turbulent core mass naturally gives rise to the brown dwarf\ndesert, as well as wide brown-dwarf binary systems. Further, we show that the\nturbulent core fragmentation model also naturally predicts that very low-mass\n(VLM) binary and BD/BD systems are more tightly-bound than stellar systems. In\naddition, in order to capture the stochastic variation intrinsic to turbulence,\nwe generate $10^4$ model turbulent cores with synthetic turbulent velocity\nfields to show that the turbulent fragmentation model accommodates a small\nfraction of binary brown dwarfs with wide separations, similar to observations.\nIndeed, the picture which emerges from the turbulent fragmentation model is\nthat a single fragmentation mechanism may largely shape both stellar and brown\ndwarf binary distributions during formation. \n\n"}

In an intermediate regime, with a\nmass range that depends on the uncertain details of rotation and mass loss\nduring the star's life, a NS is initially formed which then experiences\nfallback accretion and collapse to a BH. The electromagnetic consequence of\nsuch an event is not clear. Depending on the progenitor's structure,\npossibilities range from a long gamma-ray burst to a Type II supernova (that\nmay or may not be jet-powered) to a collapse with a weak electromagnetic\nsignature. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide the exciting opportunity to peer\nthrough the envelope of a dying massive star and directly probe what is\noccurring inside.

Based on similarities between the full\nSED shapes (0.3-8 micron), we have divided galaxies in 32 different spectral\nclasses and stacked their photometry. As each class contains galaxies over a\nrange in redshift, the resulting rest-frame SEDs are well-sampled in wavelength\nand show various spectral features including Halpha and the UV dust bump at\n2175 Angstrom. We fit all composite SEDs with flexible stellar population\nsynthesis models, while exploring attenuation curves with varying slopes and UV\nbump strengths. The Milky Way and Calzetti law provide poor fits at UV\nwavelengths for nearly all SEDs. Consistent with previous studies, we find that\nthe best-fit attenuation law varies with spectral type.

Moreover, the attenuation curve correlates with\nspecific star formation rate (SFR), with more active galaxies having shallower\ndust curves and weaker bumps.

We find that\nNSs that have evolved through different evolutionary paths reflect distinctive\nsignatures through dissimilar distribution peak and mass cutoff values. NSs in\ndouble neutron star and neutron star-white dwarf systems show consistent\nrespective peaks at 1.33 Msun and 1.55 Msun suggesting significant mass\naccretion (delta m~0.22 Msun) has occurred during the spin-up phase.

We find a mass cutoff at ~2.1 Msun for\nNSs with white dwarf companions which establishes a firm lower bound for the\nmaximum NS mass.

The lack of truncation\nclose to the maximum mass cutoff along with the skewed nature of the inferred\nmass distribution both enforce the suggestion that the 2.1 Msun limit is set by\nevolutionary constraints rather than nuclear physics or general relativity, and\nthe existence of rare super-massive NSs is possible. \n\n"}

We have tested our method on\ndifferent synthetic inhomogeneous catalogs, and shown that it is capable of\ndiscriminating some fractal models with relatively large fractal dimensions, in\nspite of the loss of information due to the radial projection. We have also\nstudied the influence of the redshift bin width, photometric redshift errors,\nbias, non-linear clustering, and surveyed area, on the angular homogeneity\nindex H2 ({\\theta}) in a {\\Lambda}CDM cosmology. The level to which an upcoming\ngalaxy survey will be able to constrain the transition to homogeneity will\ndepend mainly on the total surveyed area and the compactness of the surveyed\nregion. In particular, a Dark Energy Survey (DES)-like survey should be able to\neasily discriminate certain fractal models with fractal dimensions as large as\nD2 = 2.95. We believe that this method will have relevant applications for\nupcoming large photometric redshift surveys, such as DES or the Large Synoptic\nSurvey Telescope (LSST). \n\n"}

Recently, the extinction data of GRB afterglows are compiled up to\nredshift $z=6.3$, in combination with hydrogen column densities and\nmetallicities. This data set enables us to investigate the relation between\ndust-to-gas ratio and metallicity out to high redshift for a wide metallicity\nrange. By applying our evolution models of dust content in galaxies, we find\nthat the dust-to-gas ratio derived from GRB afterglow extinction data are\nexcessively high such that they can be explained with a fraction of gas-phase\nmetals condensed into dust ($f_\\mathrm{in}$) $\\sim 1$, while theoretical\ncalculations on dust formation in the wind of asymptotic giant branch stars and\nin the ejecta of Type II supernovae suggest a much more moderate condensation\nefficiency ($f_\\mathrm{in}\\sim 0.1$).

The energy\ncontribution from AGNs in the total infrared luminosity is only ~7% in LIRGs\nand ~20% in ULIRGs, suggesting that the majority of the infrared luminosity\noriginates from starburst activity. Using the PAH emission, we investigate the\nluminosity relation between star formation and AGN. We find that these infrared\ngalaxies exhibit higher star formation rates than optically selected Seyfert\ngalaxies with the same AGN luminosities, implying that infrared galaxies could\nbe an early evolutionary phase of AGN. \n\n"}

Using previously published lithium abundances, we remove the\nconfounding effect of the different fundamental stellar parameters by applying\na multivariable regression on our dataset. In doing so, we explicitly make an\nassumption made implicitly by different authors: that lithium abundance depends\nlinearly on fundamental stellar parameters.

Previous\ninvestigations showed there is a discrepancy between interpretation of\ngamma-ray and ionization data if gamma-rays are generated by proton-proton\ncollisions. Here we provided analysis of processes of ionization and emission\nbasing on analytical and numerical calculations of kinetic equations which\ndescribe processes of particle propagation and their energy losses. The origin\nof gamma rays could be either due to collisions of relativistic protons with\nthe dense gas of the surrounding circumnuclear disk (CND) or bremsstrahlung and\ninverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons. The hydrogen ionization\nin this case is produced by a low energy component of the CR spectrum. We found\nthat if ionization is produced by protons the expected ionization rate of\nhydrogen in the CND is of the same order as derived from IR observations. So we\ndo not see any discrepancy between the gamma-ray and ionization data for the\nhadronic model. In the case of ionization by electrons we obtained the\nionization rate one order of magnitude higher than follows from the IR data. In\nprinciple, a selection between the leptonic and hadronic interpretations can be\nperformed basing on measurements of radio and X-ray fluxes from this region\nbecause the leptonic and hadronic models give different values of the fluxes\nfrom there. We do not exclude that gamma-ray production and hydrogen ionization\nin the CND are due to a past activity of Sgr A* which occurred about 100 year\nago. Then we hypothesize that there may be connection between a past proton\neruption and a flux of hard X-rays emitted by Sgr A* hundred years ago as\nfollows from the observed time variability of the iron line seen in the\ndirection of GC molecular clouds. \n\n"}

This is especially true for radio phoenixes\nthat do not have very well defined observational criteria. Radio phoenixes are\naged radio galaxy lobes whose emission is reactivated by compression or other\nmechanisms. Here, we present the detection of a radio phoenix close to the\nmoment of its formation. The source is located in Abell 1033, a peculiar galaxy\ncluster which underwent a recent merger. To support our claim, we present\nunpublished Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and Chandra observations\ntogether with archival data from the Very Large Array and the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey. We discover the presence of two sub-clusters displaced along the N-S\ndirection. The two sub-clusters probably underwent a recent merger which is the\ncause of a moderately perturbed X-ray brightness distribution.

Here we expand the\npoint made by Murphy (2013) that in the case of some interacting star-forming\ngalaxies there is a non-thermal emission from the gas bridge in between them,\nwhich might cause a dispersion in this correlation. Galactic interactions and\nmergers have been known to give rise to tidal shocks and disrupt morphologies\nespecially in the smaller of the interacting components. Here we point out that\nthese shocks can also heat the gas and dust and will inevitably accelerate\nparticles and result in a tidal cosmic-ray population in addition to standard\ngalactic cosmic rays in the galaxy itself. This would result in a non-thermal\nemission not only from the gas bridges of interacting systems, but from\ninteracting galaxies as a whole in general. Thus both tidal heating and\nadditional non-thermal radiation will obviously affect the FIR-radio\ncorrelation of these systems, the only question is how much. In this scenario\nthe FIR-radio correlation is not stable in interacting galaxies, but rather\nevolves as the interaction/merger progresses.

In this\npaper we present the predictions of the disc fragmentation model regarding the\nproperties of the discs around such low-mass objects. We find that the discs\naround objects that have formed by fragmentation in discs hosted by Sun-like\nstars (referred to as 'parent' discs and 'parent' stars) are more massive than\nexpected from the ${M}_{\\rm disc}-M_*$ relation (which is derived for stars\nwith masses $M_*>0.2 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$). Accordingly, the accretion rates onto\nthese objects are also higher than expected from the $\\dot{M}_*-M_*$ relation.\nMoreover there is no significant correlation between the mass of the brown\ndwarf or planet with the mass of its disc nor with the accretion rate from the\ndisc onto it. The discs around objects that form by disc fragmentation have\nlarger than expected masses as they accrete gas from the disc of their parent\nstar during the first few kyr after they form. The amount of gas that they\naccrete and therefore their mass depend on how they move in their parent disc\nand how they interact with it. Observations of disc masses and accretion rates\nonto very low-mass objects are consistent with the predictions of the disc\nfragmentation model. Future observations (e.g. by ALMA) of disc masses and\naccretion rates onto substellar objects that have even lower masses (young\nplanets and young, low-mass brown dwarfs), where the scaling relations\npredicted by the disc fragmentation model diverge significantly from the\ncorresponding relations established for higher-mass stars, will test the\npredictions of this model. \n\n"}

The Effective Field\nTheory of LSS (EFTofLSS) is a novel theoretical framework that aims to develop\nan analytic understanding of LSS at long distances, where inhomogeneities are\nsmall.

We show that, in the\npresence of a galactic bar, gas in a disc in the central regions of a galaxy\nwill be driven inwards by angular momentum transport induced by acoustic\ninstabilities within the bar's inner Lindblad resonance. This transport process\ndrives turbulence within the gas that temporarily keeps it strongly\ngravitationally stable and prevents the onset of rapid star formation. However,\nat some point the rotation curve must transition from approximately flat to\napproximately solid body, and the resulting reduction in shear reduces the\ntransport rates and causes gas to build up, eventually producing a\ngravitationally-unstable region that is subject to rapid and violent star\nformation.

A\nfast outflow of molecular gas extends along the entire radio jet, with the\nhighest outflow velocities about 0.5kpc from the nucleus, at the location of\nthe brighter hot-spot in the W lobe. The data show that a massive, fast outflow\nwith velocities up to 650 km/s of cold molecular gas is present, in addition to\none detected earlier in warm H2, HI and ionised gas. Both the central AGN and\nthe radio jet could energetically drive the outflow. However, the\ncharacteristics of the outflowing gas point to the radio jet being the main\ndriver. This is important, because IC5063, although one of the most powerful\nSeyfert galaxies, is a relatively weak radio source (P = 3x10^23 W/Hz). All the\nobserved characteristics can be described by a scenario of a radio plasma jet\nexpanding into a clumpy medium, interacting directly with the clouds and\ninflating a cocoon that drives a lateral outflow into the interstellar medium.\nThis model is consistent with results obtained by recent simulations such as\nthose of Wagner et al.. A stronger, direct interaction between the jet and a\ngas cloud is present at the location of the brighter W lobe. Even assuming the\nmost conservative values for the conversion factor CO-to-H2, the mass of the\noutflowing gas is between 1.9 and 4.8x10^7 Msun. These amounts are much larger\nthan those of the outflow of warm gas (molecular and ionized) and somewhat\nlarger than of the HI outflow.

Furthermore, the Ha emission is more\nextended than the stellar continuum emission, consistent with inside-out\nassembly of galactic disks. This effect, however, is mass dependent with\nr(Ha)/r(stars)=1.1(M/10^10Msun)^0.054, such that at low masses r(Ha)~r(stars).\nWe map the Ha distribution as a function of SFR(IR+UV) and find evidence for\n`coherent star formation' across the SFR-M plane: above the main sequence, Ha\nis enhanced at all radii; below the main sequence, Ha is depressed at all\nradii. This suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving the\nenhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks of\ngalaxies.

However, He has very different\nchemical properties and no phase transition is expected before H2 in dense\ninterstellar medium (ISM) conditions. The gravitational stability of fluid\nmixtures has been studied before, but these studies did not include a phase\ntransition.\n  First, we study the gravitational stability of van der Waals fluid mixtures\nusing linearized analysis and examine virial equilibrium conditions using the\nLennard-Jones intermolecular potential. Then, combining the Lennard-Jones and\ngravitational potentials, the non-linear dynamics of fluid mixtures are studied\nvia computer simulations using the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS.\n  Along with the classical, ideal-gas Jeans instability criterion, a fluid\nmixture is always gravitationally unstable if it is in a phase transition\nbecause compression does not increase pressure. However, the condensed phase\nfraction increases. In unstable situations the species can separate: in some\nconditions He precipitates faster than H2, while in other conditions the\nconverse occurs. Also, for an initial gas phase collapse the geometry is\nessential. Contrary to spherical or filamentary collapses, sheet-like collapses\nstarting below 15K easily reach H2 condensation conditions because then they\nare fastest and both the increase of heating and opacity are limited.\n  Depending on density, temperature and mass, either rocky H2 planetoids, or\ngaseous He planetoids form.

In this paper\nwe present a systematic study of the importance of microphysical processes in\nRHD simulations using the example of D-type HII region expansion. We compare\nthe simplest hydrogen-only models with those that include: ionisation of H, He,\nC, N, O, S and Ne, different gas metallicity, non-LTE metal line blanketed\nstellar spectral models of varying metallicity, radiation pressure, dust and\ntreatment of photodissociation regions. Each of these processes are explicitly\ntreated using modern numerical methods rather than parameterisation. In line\nwith expectations, changes due to microphysics in either the effective number\nof ionising photons or the thermal structure of the gas lead to differences in\nD-type expansion.

We show that aggregates consisting of multiple\nspecies of volatile ices experience sintering, collisionally disrupt, and pile\nup at multiple locations slightly outside the snow lines of the volatiles. At\nwavelengths of 0.87--1.3 mm, these sintering zones appear as bright, optically\nthick rings with a spectral slope of $\\approx 2$, whereas the non-sintering\nzones as darker, optically thinner rings of a spectral slope of $\\approx$\n2.3--2.5.

Because the radial profile of the\nimposed magnetic field is well constrained, a deterministic calculation of the\ndisk mass flow becomes possible. The vertical disk profiles obtained in Paper I\nimply a stronger magnetization in the inner disk, faster accretion, and a\nsecular depletion of the disk material. Inward transport of solids allows the\ndisk to maintain a broad optical absorption layer even when the grain abundance\nbecomes too small to suppress its ionization.

Simple theories of isothermal fragmentation successfully\nreproduce the core mass function (CMF) which has a very similar shape to the\ninitial mass function (IMF) of stars. However, numerical simulations of\nisothermal turbulent fragmentation thus far have not succeeded in identifying a\nfragment mass scale that is independent of the simulation resolution. Moreover,\nthe fluid equations for magnetized, self-gravitating, isothermal turbulence are\nscale-free, and do not predict any characteristic mass. In this paper we show\nthat, although an isothermal self-gravitating flow does produce a CMF with a\nmass scale imposed by the initial conditions, this scale changes as the parent\ncloud evolves. In addition, the cores that form undergo further fragmentation\nand after sufficient time forget about their initial conditions, yielding a\nscale-free pure power-law distribution $\\mathrm{d} N/\\mathrm{d} M\\propto\nM^{-2}$ for the stellar IMF. We show that this problem can be alleviated by\nintroducing additional physics that provides a termination scale for the\ncascade.

We find that the cores produced by our models would be\nbright in CO and NH$_3$ but not in HCO$^+$. This differentiates them from\nmodels using purely freefall collapse as such models produce cores that would\nhave detectable transitions from all three molecules. \n\n"}

A New\n  Classification Scheme for Carbon-Enhanced Metal-poor Stars with S-process\n  Element Enhancement Abstract: We present a detailed abundance analysis of 23 elements for a newly\ndiscovered carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) star, HE 0414-0343, from the\nChemical Abundances of Stars in the Halo (CASH) Project. Its spectroscopic\nstellar parameters are Teff = 4863 K, log g = 1.25, vmic = 2.20 km/s, and\n[Fe/H] = -2.24. Radial velocity measurements covering seven years indicate HE\n0414-0343 to be a binary. HE 0414-0343 has [C/Fe] = 1.44 and is strongly\nenhanced in neutron-capture elements but its abundances cannot be reproduced by\na solar-type s-process pattern alone. Traditionally, it could be classified as\n\"CEMP-r/s\" star. Based on abundance comparisons with AGB star nucleosynthesis\nmodels, we suggest a new physically-motivated origin and classification scheme\nfor CEMP-s stars and the still poorly-understood CEMP-r/s. The new scheme\ndescribes a continuous transition between these two so-far distinctly treated\nsubgroups: CEMP-sA, CEMP-sB, and CEMP-sC. Possible causes for a continuous\ntransition include the number of thermal pulses the AGB companion underwent,\nthe effect of different AGB star masses on their nucleosynthetic yields, and\nphysics that is not well approximated in 1-D stellar models such as proton\ningestion episodes and rotation. Based on a set of detailed AGB models, we\nsuggest the abundance signature of HE 0414-0343 to have arisen from a >1.3 Msun\nmass AGB star and a late-time mass transfer, that transformed HE 0414-0343 into\na CEMP-sC star. We also find the [Y/Ba] ratio well parametrizes the\nclassification and can thus be used to easily classify any future such stars. \n\n"}

This is done by combining\nmeasurements of the vertical velocity dispersion of the disc with the disc\nscale height. The vertical velocity dispersion of the discs is measured from\nabsorption lines (near the V-band) of near-face-on spiral galaxies, with the\nlight coming from a mixed population of giants of all ages. However, the scale\nheights for these galaxies are estimated statistically from near-IR surface\nphotometry of edge-on galaxies. The scale height estimate is therefore\ndominated by a population of older (> 2 Gyr) red giants. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the importance of measuring the velocity dispersion for the same\nolder population of stars that is used to estimate the vertical scale height.\nWe present an analysis of the vertical kinematics of K-giants in the solar\nvicinity.

Here we show that the assumption of an\nunstructured multitude of cluster or association types might be misleading.\nCurrent data compilations of clusters show correlations between cluster mass,\nsize, age, maximum stellar mass etc. In this first paper we take a closer look\nat the correlation of cluster mass and radius. We use literature data to\nexplore relations in cluster and molecular core properties in the solar\nneighborhood. We show that for embedded clusters in the solar neighborhood\nthere exists a clear correlation between cluster mass and half-mass radius of\nthe form $M_c = C R_c^{\\gamma}$ with gamma = 1.7 +/-0.2. This correlation holds\nfor infra red K band data as well as X-ray sources and for clusters containing\na hundred stars up to those consisting of a few tens of thousands of stars. The\ncorrelation is difficult to verify for clusters containing <30 stars due to\nlow-number statistics. Dense clumps of gas are the progenitors of the embedded\nclusters.

This might point at a direct\ntranslation from gas to stellar mass: however, it is difficult to relate size\nmeasurements for clusters (stars) to those for gas profiles.

We find\nsignificant differences in the morphology of the interaction when M=10 and\nchi=100: in many cases 3 parallel rolls are formed, and spread further apart\nwith time, and periodic vortex shedding can occur off the ends of oblique\nfilaments. Sideways-on filaments are accelerated more quickly, and initially\nlose mass more quickly than spherical clouds due to their greater surface area\nto volume ratio. However, at late stages they lose mass more slowly, due to the\nreduced relative speed between the filament and the postshock flow. The\nacceleration and mixing timescales can vary by a factor of 2 as the filament\norientation changes. Oblique filaments can achieve transverse velocities up to\n10% of the shock speed.

Abstract: The effective field theory of cosmic acceleration systematizes possible\ncontributions to the action, accounting for both dark energy and modifications\nof gravity. Rather than making model dependent assumptions, it includes all\nterms, subject to the required symmetries, with four (seven) functions of time\nfor the coefficients. These correspond respectively to the Horndeski and\ngeneral beyond Horndeski class of theories. We address the question of whether\nthis general systematization is actually effective, i.e. useful in revealing\nthe nature of cosmic acceleration when compared with cosmological data. The\nanswer is no and yes: {\\it there is no simple time dependence of the free\nfunctions} -- assumed forms in the literature are poor fits, but one can derive\nsome general characteristics in early and late time limits. For example, we\nprove that the gravitational slip must restore to general relativity in the de\nSitter limit of Horndeski theories, and why it doesn't more generally. We also\nclarify the relation between the tensor and scalar sectors, and its important\nrelation to observations; in a real sense the expansion history $H(z)$ or dark\nenergy equation of state $w(z)$ is $1/5$ or less of the functional information!\nIn addition we discuss the de Sitter, Horndeski, and decoupling limits of the\ntheory utilizing Goldstone techniques. \n\n"}

It has been proposed to mitigate\npossible bias by removing single-detector data samples that pass a\nmulti-detector consistency test from the background estimates. We conduct a\nhigh-statistics Mock Data Challenge to evaluate the effects of removing such\nsamples, modelling a range of scenarios with plausible detector noise\ndistributions and with a range of plausible foreground astrophysical signal\nrates. We consider the two different modes: one in which coincident samples are\nremoved, and one in which all samples are retained and used. Three algorithms\nwere operated in both modes, show good consistency with each other; however,\ndiscrepancies arise between the results obtained under the \"coincidence\nremoval\" and \"all samples\" modes, for false alarm probabilities below a certain\nvalue. In most scenarios the median of the false alarm probability (FAP)\nestimator under the \"all samples\" mode is consistent with the exact FAP.

We collect star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) with accurate spectroscopic redshifts, for which Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) coverage and multi-wavelength photometry are available. Method:\nWe selected a sample of about 200 sources at z~3. Taking advantage of HST\nresolution, we applied a careful cleaning procedure and rejected sources\nshowing nearby clumps with different colours, which could be lower-z\ninterlopers. Our clean sample consisted of 86 SFGs (including 19 narrow-band\nselected Lya emitters) and 8 AGN (including 6 detected in X-rays). We measured\nthe LyC flux from aperture photometry in four narrow-band filters covering\nwavelengths below a 912 A rest frame (3.11<z<3.53). We estimated the ratio\nbetween ionizing (LyC flux) and 1400 A non-ionizing emissions for AGN and\ngalaxies. Results: By running population synthesis models, we assume an average\nintrinsic L(1400 A)/L(900 A) ratio of 5 as the representative value for our\nsample. With this value and an average treatment of the lines of sight of the\ninter-galactic medium, we estimate the LyC escape fraction relative to the\nintrinsic value (fesc_rel(LyC)).

The obtained results provide evidence of a\npreviously unknown physical mechanism affecting the neutral species of some\nchemical elements in the atmosphere of most AGB stars: because of it, the\nabundances derived from neutral lines are systematically underestimated, while\nthose measured from ionized lines remain unaffected. Such a behaviour exactly\ncorresponds to what expected in the case of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium\n(NLTE) conditions in the star atmosphere.

This collection of data clearly confirms the existence of a\nplateau in the (N/O) ratio at very low metallicity, followed by an increase of\nthis ratio up to high values as the metallicity increases. This trend can be\ninterpreted as due to two main sources of nitrogen in galaxies: i) massive\nstars, which produce small amounts of pure primary nitrogen and are responsible\nfor the (N/O) ratio in the low metallicity plateau; ii) low- and\nintermediate-mass stars, which produce both secondary and primary nitrogen and\nenrich the interstellar medium with a time delay relative to massive stars, and\ncause the increase of the (N/O) ratio.

A Consistent 10 Myr Age for the Upper Scorpius OB\n  Association Abstract: When determining absolute ages of identifiably young stellar populations,\nresults strongly depend on which stars are studied. Cooler (K, M) stars\ntypically yield ages that are systematically younger than warmer (A, F, G)\nstars by a factor of two. I explore the possibility that these age\ndiscrepancies are the result of magnetic inhibition of convection in cool young\nstars by using magnetic stellar evolution isochrones to determine the age of\nthe Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association. A median\nage of 10 Myr consistent across spectral types A through M is found, except for\na subset of F-type stars that appear significantly older. Agreement is shown\nfor ages derived from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and from the empirical\nmass-radius relationship defined by eclipsing multiple-star systems. Surface\nmagnetic field strengths required to produce agreement are of order 2.5 kG and\nare predicted from a priori estimates of equipartition values. A region in the\nHR diagram is identified that plausibly connects stars whose structures are\nweakly influenced by the presence of magnetic fields with those whose\nstructures are strongly influenced by magnetic fields. The models suggest this\nregion is characterized by stars with rapidly thinning outer convective\nenvelopes where the radiative core mass is greater than 75% of the total\nstellar mass. Furthermore, depletion of lithium predicted from magnetic models\nappears in better agreement with observed lithium equivalent widths than\npredictions from non-magnetic models. These results suggest that magnetic\ninhibition of convection plays an important role in the early evolution of\nlow-mass stars and that it may be responsible for noted age discrepancies in\nyoung stellar populations. \n\n"}

We further aim to\ndetermine the effect of H2O line cooling on the energy balance in the inner\ncircumstellar envelope.

The observations are\ncomplemented by ground-based CO observations, and spectrally unresolved CO and\nH2O observations with PAC. The observed line profiles constrain the velocity\nstructure throughout the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs), while the CO\nintensities constrain the temperature structure in the CSEs. The H2O\nobservations constrain the o-H2O and p-H2O abundances relative to H2. Finally,\nthe radiative-transfer modelling allows to solve the energy balance in the CSE,\nin principle including also H2O line cooling. The fits to the line profiles\nonly set moderate constraints on the velocity profile, indicating shallower\nacceleration profiles in the winds of M-type AGB stars than predicted by\ndynamical models, while the CO observations effectively constrain the\ntemperature structure. Including H2O line cooling in the energy balance was\nonly possible for the low-mass-loss-rate objects in the sample, and required an\nad hoc adjustment of the dust velocity profile in order to counteract extreme\ncooling in the inner CSE.

I have tested this result by\nmeasuring century-long light curves in the Johnson B-band with modern\ncomparison star magnitudes, and I have extended this by measuring many\nmagnitudes over a wide time range as well as for the fourth hot RCB star. In\nall four cases, the B-band magnitude of the maximum light is now fast fading.\nThe fading rates (in units of magnitudes per century) are 2.5 for DY Cen after\n1960, 1.3 for MV Sgr, 1.3 for V348 Sgr, and 0.7 for HV 2671. This secular\nfading is caused by the expected evolution of the star across the top of the HR\ndiagram at constant luminosity, as the temperature rises and the bolometric\ncorrection changes. For DY Cen, the brightness at maximum light is rising from\n1906 to 1932, and this is caused by the temperature increase from near 5,800 to\n7,500 K. Before 1934 DY Cen had frequent dust dips, while after 1934 there are\nzero dust dips, so there is some apparent connection between the rising\ntemperature and the formation of the dust.

In our model angular momentum and mass are transported by a\ncombination of gravitational and bar-driven acoustic instabilities. In\ngravitationally-unstable regions the gas can form stars, and the resulting\nfeedback drives both turbulence and a wind that ejects mass from the CMZ. We\nshow that the CMZ is in a quasi-steady state where mass deposited at large\nradii by the bar is transported inward to a star-forming, ring-shaped region at\n$\\sim 100$ pc from the Galactic Centre, where the shear reaches a minimum. This\nring undergoes episodic starbursts, with bursts lasting $\\sim 5-10$ Myr\noccurring at $\\sim 20-40$ Myr intervals.

We use our new tool to perform\nthree-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the collapse of massive\npre-stellar cores with laminar and turbulent initial conditions and properly\nresolve regions where we expect instabilities to grow.

From this analysis, we show 1) the size range being targeted can affect\nthe survey design, 2) the orbit distribution of the target sample can affect\nthe survey design, 3) minimum observational arc length during the survey is an\nimportant metric of survey performance, and 4) surveys must consider objects as\nsmall as D=15-30 m to meet the goal of identifying objects that have the\npotential to cause damage on Earth in the next 100 years.

The\nSentinel mission concept is shown to be as effective as any survey in finding\nobjects bigger than D=140 m but is more effective when applied to finding\nsmaller objects on Earth-impacting orbits.

We have\nmeasured new Herschel PACS fluxes for 11 objects and complement these with\n(sub)-mm data and Herschel fluxes from the literature. We analyze their\nspectral energy distributions in comparison with results from radiative\ntransfer modeling. Fluxes in the far-infrared are strongly affected by the\nshape and temperature of the disk (and hence stellar luminosity), whereas the\n(sub)-mm fluxes mostly depend on disk mass. Nevertheless, there is a clear\ncorrelation between far-infrared and (sub)-mm fluxes. We argue that the link\nresults from the combination of the stellar mass-luminosity relation and a\nscaling between disk mass and stellar mass.

The planet has 20, 100, or 1000~M$_\\oplus$,\nranging from barely enough to perturb the disk significantly, to clearing a\ndeep tidal gap. The hydrostatic balance strikingly alters the model disk's\nappearance. The planet-carved gap's outer wall puffs up under starlight\nheating, throwing a shadow across the disk beyond. The shadow appears in\nscattered light as a dark ring that could be mistaken for a gap opened by\nanother more distant planet.

We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide\nillustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion\nof the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1\nconsists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,\nparallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars\nin common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric\ndata set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The\nsecond component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band\nmagnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the\ntypical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas. The median uncertainties on\nthe mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to ~0.03 mag over the\nmagnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping\nof the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin\nobservational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this\nfirst Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the\ndata quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions\nfrom the data. \n\n"}

We\ncarried out state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of the circumplanetary\ndisks for both formation scenarios, using as similar initial conditions as\npossible to unveil possible intrinsic differences in the circumplanetary disk\nmass and temperature between the two formation mechanisms. We found that the\ncircumplanetary disks mass linearly scales with the circumstellar disk mass.\nTherefore, in an equally massive protoplanetary disk, the circumplanetary disks\nformed in the disk instability model can be only a factor of eight more massive\nthan their core-accretion counterparts. On the other hand, the bulk\ncircumplanetary disk temperature differs by more than an order of magnitude\nbetween the two cases. The subdisks around planets formed by gravitational\ninstability have a characteristic temperature below 100 K, while the core\naccretion circumplanetary disks are hot, with temperatures even greater than\n1000 K when embedded in massive, optically thick protoplanetary disks. We\nexplain how this difference can be understood as the natural result of the\ndifferent formation mechanisms.

Abstract: [Abridged] Regions of low ionisation where the activity of the\nmagneto-rotational instability is suppressed, the so-called dead zones, have\nbeen suggested to explain gaps and asymmetries of transition disks. We\ninvestigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified\nprescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on\nthe disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create\nsignatures similar to those observed in transition disks. For the dust\nevolution, we included the transport, growth, and fragmentation of dust\nparticles. To compare with observations, we produced synthetic images in\nscattered optical light and in thermal emission at mm wavelengths. In all\nmodels with a dead zone, a bump in the gas surface density is produced that is\nable to efficiently trap large particles ($\\gtrsim 1$ mm) at the outer edge of\nthe dead zone. The gas bump reaches an amplitude of a factor of $\\sim5$, which\ncan be enhanced by the presence of an MHD wind that removes mass from the inner\ndisk. While our 1D simulations suggest that such a structure can be present\nonly for $\\sim$1 Myr, the structure may be maintained for a longer time when\nmore realistic 2D/3D simulations are performed. In the synthetic images,\ngap-like low-emission regions are seen at scattered light and in thermal\nemission at mm wavelengths, as previously predicted in the case of planet-disk\ninteraction. As a conclusion, main signatures of transition disks can be\nreproduced by assuming a dead zone in the disk, such as gap-like structure in\nscattered light and millimetre continuum emission, and a lower gas surface\ndensity within the dead zone. Previous studies showed that the Rossby wave\ninstability can also develop at the edge of such dead zones, forming vortices\nand also creating asymmetries. \n\n"}

We find that low mass halos (those less massive\nthan the characteristic mass $M_{\\rm C}$ of halos collapsing at a given epoch)\nin high-density environments have lower accretion rates, lower spins, higher\nconcentrations, and rounder shapes than halos in median density environments.\nHalos in median and low-density environments have similar accretion rates and\nconcentrations, but halos in low density environments have lower spins and are\nmore elongated. Halos of a given mass in high-density regions accrete material\nearlier than halos of the same mass in lower-density regions.

In this paper we study the dynamics of\ncounterrotating collisionless stellar disks by means of $N$-body simulations.\nWe show that, in the presence of counterrotation, an otherwise gravitationally\nstable disk can naturally generate bending waves accompanied by strong disk\nheating across the disk plane, that is in the vertical direction. Such\nconclusion is found to hold even for dynamically warm systems with typical\nvalues of the initial vertical-to-radial velocity dispersion ratio $\\sigma_{\\rm\nz}/\\sigma_{\\rm R} \\approx 0.5$, for which the role of pressure anisotropy\nshould be unimportant.

Pioneer radial velocity follow-up observations with the UVES\nspectrograph at the ESO - VLT of this system clearly ruled out the large radial\nvelocity variation, leaving a discrepancy between the observation and the\nprediction.

We find that disk winds are the dominant feedback mechanism setting star\nformation efficiencies (SFEs) from initial cores of ~0.3-0.5.

Spectral modelling indicates that\nthe SN ejected ~ 6 M_sol of CO-rich material with a kinetic energy of ~ 7 x\n10^51 erg, and suggests a partially thermalised additional source of luminosity\nbetween -2 d and +22 d. This may be due to interaction with a shell of material\noriginating from pre-explosion mass loss. We further present a detailed\nanalysis of the host galaxy system of LSQ14mo. PESSTO and GROND imaging show\nthree spatially resolved bright regions, and we used the VLT and FORS2 to\nobtain a deep (five-hour exposure) spectra of the SN position and the three\nstar-forming regions, which are at a similar redshift. The FORS spectrum at\n+300 days shows no trace of SN emission lines and we place limits on the\nstrength of [O I] from comparisons with other Ic SNe. The deep spectra provides\na unique chance to investigate spatial variations in the host star-formation\nactivity and metallicity.

The accretion luminosity, Lacc,\nincreases with the stellar luminosity, Lstar, with an overall slope of ~1.6,\nsimilar but with a smaller scatter than in previous studies. There is a\nsignificant lack of strong accretors below Lstar~0.1Lsun, where Lacc is always\nlower than 0.01Lstar.

We start by defining the action of a disformal\ntransformation in the tangent space. Then, we take advantage of the great\neconomy of means of the language of differential forms to compute the full\ntransformation of Horndeski's theory under general disformal transformations.\nWe obtain that Horndeski's action maps onto itself modulo a reduced set of\nnon-Horndeski Lagrangians. These new Lagrangians are found to be invariant\nunder disformal transformation that depend only in the first derivatives of the\nscalar. Moreover, these combinations of Lagrangians precisely appear when\nexpressing in our basis the constraints of the recently proposed Extended\nScalar-Tensor (EST) theories. These results allow us to classify the different\norbits of scalar-tensor theories invariant under particular disformal\ntransformations, namely the special disformal, kinetic disformal and disformal\nHorndeski orbits. In addition, we consider generalizations of this framework.\nWe find that there are possible well-defined extended disformal transformations\nthat have not been considered in the literature. However, they generically\ncannot link Horndeski theory with EST theories. Finally, we study further\ngeneralizations in which extra fields with different spin are included.

The likely progenitors of today's most massive galaxies are remarkably\nsmall, disky, passive and have already assembled much of their stellar mass at\nredshift z=2. An in-depth analysis of these objects, however, is currently not\nfeasible due to the lack of high-quality, spatially-resolved photometric and\nspectroscopic data. In this paper, we present a sample of nearby compact\nelliptical galaxies (CEGs), which bear resemblance to the massive and quiescent\ngalaxy population at earlier times. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and wide-field\nintegral field unit (IFU) data have been obtained, and are used to constrain\norbit-based dynamical models and stellar population synthesis (SPS) fits, to\nunravel their structural and dynamical properties. We first show that our\ngalaxies are outliers in the present-day stellar mass-size relation. They are,\nhowever, consistent with the mass-size relation of compact, massive and\nquiescent galaxies at redshift z=2. The compact sizes of our nearby galaxies\nimply high central stellar mass surface densities, which are also in agreement\nwith the massive galaxy population at higher redshift, hinting at strong\ndissipational processes during their formation. Corroborating evidence for a\nlargely passive evolution within the last 10 Gyr is provided by their orbital\ndistribution as well as their stellar populations, which are difficult to\nreconcile with a very active (major) merging history. This all supports that we\ncan use nearby CEGs as local analogues of the high-redshift, massive and\nquiescent galaxy population, thus providing additional constraints for models\nof galaxy formation and evolution. \n\n"}

The power\nlaw scaling is steeper for ionised winds (slope 1.29+/-0.38) than for molecular\nwinds (0.76+/-0.06), meaning that the two rates converge at high bolometric\nluminosities. The molecular gas depletion timescale and the molecular gas\nfraction of galaxies hosting powerful AGN winds are 3-10 times shorter and\nsmaller than those of main-sequence galaxies with similar SFR, stellar mass and\nredshift.

We pay\nattention to effects of BH mass function on the total mass and mass ratio\ndistributions of BH binaries ejected from clusters. Firstly, we consider BH\npopulations with two different masses in order to learn basic differences from\nmodels with single-mass BHs only. Secondly, we consider continuous BH mass\nfunctions adapted from recent studies on massive star evolution in a low\nmetallicity environment, where globular clusters are formed. In this work, we\nconsider only binaries that are formed by three-body processes and ignore\nstellar evolution and primordial binaries for simplicity. Our results imply\nthat most BH binary mergers take place after they get ejected from the cluster.\nAlso, mass ratios of dynamically formed binaries should be close to one or\nlikely to be less than 2:1. Since the binary formation efficiency is larger for\nhigher-mass BHs, it is likely that a BH mass function sampled by\ngravitational-wave observations would be weighed toward higher masses than the\nmass function of single BHs for a dynamically formed population. Applying\nconservative assumptions regarding globular cluster populations such as small\nBH mass fraction and no primordial binaries, the merger rate of BH binaries\noriginated from globular clusters is estimated to be at least 6.5 per yr per\nGpc^3.

Abstract: The dependence of the mass accretion rate on the stellar properties is a key\nconstraint for star formation and disk evolution studies. Here we present a\nstudy of a sample of stars in the Chamaeleon I star forming region carried out\nusing the VLT/X-Shooter spectrograph. The sample is nearly complete down to\nM~0.1Msun for the young stars still harboring a disk in this region. We derive\nthe stellar and accretion parameters using a self-consistent method to fit the\nbroad-band flux-calibrated medium resolution spectrum. The correlation between\nthe accretion luminosity to the stellar luminosity, and of the mass accretion\nrate to the stellar mass in the logarithmic plane yields slopes of 1.9 and 2.3,\nrespectively. These slopes and the accretion rates are consistent with previous\nresults in various star forming regions and with different theoretical\nframeworks. However, we find that a broken power-law fit, with a steeper slope\nfor stellar luminosity smaller than ~0.45 Lsun and for stellar masses smaller\nthan ~ 0.3 Msun, is slightly preferred according to different statistical\ntests, but the single power-law model is not excluded. The steeper relation for\nlower mass stars can be interpreted as a faster evolution in the past for\naccretion in disks around these objects, or as different accretion regimes in\ndifferent stellar mass ranges. Finally, we find two regions on the mass\naccretion versus stellar mass plane empty of objects. One at high mass\naccretion rates and low stellar masses, which is related to the steeper\ndependence of the two parameters we derived. The second one is just above the\nobservational limits imposed by chromospheric emission.

The small-scale dynamo appears to be a viable\nmechanism to explain observations of strong magnetic fields in present-day and\nhigh-redshift galaxies, considering the extreme weakness of seed fields\npredicted by battery mechanisms or primordial fields.

Inclination angle has little effect on the mass loss unless the disk is\nclose to edge-on. Inclined disks also strip asymmetrically with the trailing\nedge ablating more easily. Since the interaction lasts less than one outer\nrotation period, there is not enough time for the disk to restore its symmetry,\nleaving the disk asymmetrical after the flow has passed. Of the low-mass disks\nconsidered, only the edge-on disk is able to survive interaction with the SNR\n(with 50% of its initial mass remaining).

In\norder to apply an empirical completeness correction, existing works limit the\nsurvey depth to the shallower parts of the sky that hamper the maximum\npotential of a survey.

Most embedded binary systems are\nfound toward the centres of their parent cores, although several systems have\ncomponents closer to the core edge. Wide binaries, defined as those systems\nwith physical separations greater than 500 au, show a tendency to be aligned\nwith the long axes of their parent cores, whereas tight binaries show no\npreferred orientation.

In this work, the feedback\nof realistic dust particle distributions onto the gas chemistry and molecular\nemissivity is investigated, with a particular focus on CO isotopologues.

A new version of the code\nDALI is used to take into account how dust surface area and density influence\nthe disk thermal structure, molecular abundances and excitation. The difference\nof dust and gas radial sizes is largely due to differences in the optical depth\nof CO lines and millimeter continuum, without the need to invoke radial drift.\nThe effect of radial drift is primarily visible in the sharp outer edge of the\ncontinuum intensity profile. The gas outer radius probed by $^{12}$CO emission\ncan easily differ by a factor of $\\sim 2$ between the models for a turbulent\n$\\alpha$ ranging between typical values.

Furthermore, chromospheric emission in young active stars impacts the\nmeasurement of mass accretion rates, a key quantity to study disk evolution.\nHere we derive stellar properties of low-mass pre-main sequence stars without\ndisks, which represent ideal photospheric templates for studies of young stars.\nWe also use these spectra to constrain the impact of chromospheric emission on\nthe measurements of mass accretion rates. The spectra in reduced,\nflux-calibrated, and corrected for telluric absorption form are made available\nto the community. We derive the spectral type for our targets by analyzing the\nphotospheric molecular features present in their VLT/X-Shooter spectra by means\nof spectral indices and comparison of the relative strength of photospheric\nabsorption features. We also measure effective temperature, gravity, projected\nrotational velocity, and radial velocity from our spectra by fitting them with\nsynthetic spectra with the ROTFIT tool. The targets have negligible extinction\nand spectral type from G5 to M8. We perform synthetic photometry on the spectra\nto derive the typical colors of young stars in different filters.

From the PMS to the RGB at solar\n  metallicity Abstract: Star-planet interactions must be taken into account in stellar models to\nunderstand the dynamical evolution of close-in planets. The dependence of the\ntidal interactions on the structural and rotational evolution of the star is of\npeculiar importance and should be correctly treated. We quantify how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of rotating low-mass stars evolves from\nthe pre-main sequence up to the red-giant branch depending on the initial\nstellar mass. We investigate the consequences of this evolution on planetary\norbital evolution. We couple the tidal dissipation formalism described in\nMathis (2015) to the stellar evolution code STAREVOL and apply it to rotating\nstars with masses between 0.3 and 1.4 M$_\\odot$. In addition, we generalize the\nwork of Bolmont & Mathis (2016) by following the orbital evolution of close-in\nplanets using the new tidal dissipation predictions for advanced phases of\nstellar evolution. On the PMS the evolution of tidal dissipation is controlled\nby the evolution of the internal structure of the contracting star. On the MS\nit is strongly driven by the variation of surface rotation that is impacted by\nmagnetized stellar winds braking. The main effect of taking into account the\nrotational evolution of the stars is to lower the tidal dissipation strength by\nabout four orders of magnitude on the main-sequence, compared to a normalized\ndissipation rate that only takes into account structural changes. The evolution\nof the dissipation strongly depends on the evolution of the internal structure\nand rotation of the star. From the pre-main sequence up to the tip of the\nred-giant branch, it varies by several orders of magnitude, with strong\nconsequences for the orbital evolution of close-in massive planets. These\neffects are the strongest during the pre-main sequence, implying that the\nplanets are mainly sensitive to the star's early history. \n\n"}

We\nstudy the millimetre and centimetre emission from accreting CPDs by using the\nsimple $\\alpha$ disc model. We find that it is easier to detect CPDs at shorter\nradio wavelengths (e.g. $\\lambda\\lesssim$ 1 mm). For example, if the system is\n140 pc away from us, deep observations (e.g. 5 hours) at ALMA Band 7 (0.87 mm)\nare sensitive to as small as 0.03 lunar mass of dust in CPDs. If the CPD is\naround a Jupiter mass planet 20 AU away from the host star and has\n$\\alpha\\lesssim 0.001$, ALMA can detect this disc when it accretes faster than\n$10^{-10} M_{\\odot}/yr$.

It only\ntakes 10$^2$-10$^{3}$ years for CPDs to lose millimetre dust. Thus, for CPDs to\nbe detectable at radio wavelengths, mm-sized dust in CPDs needs to be\nreplenished continuously, or the disc has a significant fraction of\nmicron-sized dust or a high gas surface density so that the particle drifting\ntimescale is long, or the radial drift is prevented by other means (e.g.\npressure traps). \n\n"}

Higher mass disks generally\nshow brighter CN. Higher UV fields, such as those appropriate for T Tauri stars\nwith high accretion rates or for Herbig Ae stars or for higher disk flaring,\ngenerally result in brighter and larger rings.

We have produced the cluster stellar density radial profile and a\nstellar density map from independent approaches, from which we found results in\nexcellent agreement : the feature extends up to 3.5 times the cluster tidal\nradius. Previous works based on shallower photometric data sets have speculated\non the existence of several long tidal tails, similar to that found in Pal 5.\nThe present outcome shows that NGC 288 could hardly have such tails, but\nfavours the notion that interactions with the MW tidal field has been a\nrelatively inefficient process for stripping stars off the cluster.

They are thought to\nrepresent an evolutionary phase during the life of every young star when\naccretion from the circumstellar disk is enhanced during recurring time\nperiods. These outbursts are able to rapidly build up the star while affecting\nthe circumstellar disk and thus the ongoing or future planet formation. In many\nmodels infall from a circumstellar envelope seems to be necessary to trigger\nthe outbursts. We observed the J=1$-$0 rotational transition of $^{13}$CO and\nC$^{18}$O towards eight northern FU Orionis-type stars (V1057 Cyg, V1515 Cyg,\nV2492 Cyg, V2493 Cyg, V1735 Cyg, V733 Cep, RNO 1B and RNO 1C) and derive\ntemperatures and envelope masses and discuss the morphology and kinematics of\nthe circumstellar material.

We perform a 3D SPH simulation of a circumbinary disc\nmisaligned by $60^\\circ$ with respect to the binary orbital plane. The inner\ndisc breaks from the outer regions, precessing as a rigid body, and leading to\na complex evolution. As the inner disc precesses, the misalignment angle\nbetween the inner and outer discs varies by more than $100^\\circ$. Different\nsnapshots of the evolution are post-processed with a radiative transfer code,\nin order to produce observational diagnostics of the process. Even though the\nsimulation was produced for the specific case of a circumbinary disc, most of\nthe observational predictions hold for any disc hosting a precessing inner rim.\nSynthetic scattered light observations show strong azimuthal asymmetries, where\nthe pattern depends strongly on the misalignment angle between inner and outer\ndisc. The asymmetric illumination of the outer disc leads to azimuthal\nvariations of the temperature structure, in particular in the upper layers,\nwhere the cooling time is short.

We discovered molecular gas in\nthree debris disks. In all these disks, the $^{12}$CO line was optically thick,\nhighlighting the importance of less abundant molecules in reliable mass\nestimates. Supplementing our target list by literature data, we compiled a\nvolume-limited sample of dust-rich debris disks around young A-type stars\nwithin 150 pc.

First, we identify 156 planet hosts for which measurements of the\nprojected rotation velocity (vsini) and rotation period are both available. By\ncombining estimates of v and vsini, we find nearly all the stars to be\ncompatible with high inclination, and hence, low obliquity (less than about 20\ndegrees). Second, we focus on a sample of 159 hot stars (> 6000K) for which\nvsini is available but not necessarily the rotation period. We find 6 stars for\nwhich vsini is anomalously low, an indicator of high obliquity. Half of these\nhave hot Jupiters, even though only 3% of the stars that were searched have hot\nJupiters.

We explore\ndust evolution models in a disk perturbed by two giant planets, as well as\nmodels with a parameterized dust size distribution. The dust evolution model is\nable to reproduce the ring locations and gap widths in polarized intensity, but\nfails to reproduce their depths.

Models with a parameterized dust size\ndistribution better reproduce the gap depth in scattered light, suggesting that\ndust filtration at the outer edges of the gaps is less effective. The pile-up\nof millimeter grains in a dust trap and the continuous distribution of small\ngrains throughout the gap likely require a more efficient dust fragmentation\nand dust diffusion in the dust trap.

Low-velocity outflows are driven by an outer region of\nthe circumstellar disk, while high-velocity jets are driven near an inner edge\nof the disk. The disk angular momentum is effectively transferred by magnetic\neffects in the outflow and jet driving regions where the magnetic field is well\ncoupled with neutral gas. On the other hand, in a high density gas region of\nthe disk (or intermediate region), the magnetic field dissipates and is\ndecoupled from neutral gas. Thus, in such a magnetically inactive region, no\noutward flow appears and the disk angular momentum is not effectively\ntransferred by magnetic effects. Therefore, in the disk intermediate region,\nthe disk surface density continues to increase and gravitational instability\noccurs and produce a non-axisymmetric (or spiral) structure. After spiral arms\nsufficiently develop, the disk angular momentum is transferred by gravitational\ntorque and a large amount of the disk mass accretes onto the central protostar\nfrom the circumstellar disk.

We confirm\nthe strong variation in convective blueshift with Teff and its dependence on\n(as shown in the line list in Paper I) activity level. Although we do not\nobserve a significant effect of age or cyclic activity, stars with a higher\nmetallicity tend to have a lower convective blueshift, with a larger effect\nthan expected from numerical simulations. Finally, we estimate that for 71% of\nthe stars in our sample the RV and LogR'HK variations are compatible with the\neffect of activity on convection, as observed in the solar case, while for the\nother stars, other sources (such as binarity or companions) must be invoked to\nexplain the large RV variations. We also confirm a relationship between LogR'HK\nand metallicity, which may affect discussions of the possible relationship\nbetween metallicity and exoplanets, as RV surveys are biased toward low LogR'HK\nand possibly toward high-metallicity stars. We conclude that activity and\nmetallicity strongly affect the small-scale convection levels in stars in the\nF7-K4 range, with a lower amplitude for the lower mass stars and a larger\namplitude for low-metallicity stars. \n\n"}

The duration and efficiency of exchange\nbetween the primitive massive atmosphere and the global impact-induced water\nocean likely play a key role in the chemical evolution of the early Titan's\natmosphere. To investigate the atmospheric composition of early Titan for a\nwide range of global (atmosphere + ocean) composition in volatils, we first\ndeveloped a gas-liquid equilibrium model of the NH3-CO2-H2O system, where the\nnon-ideal behavior of both gas and liquid phases, and the speciation of\nvolatiles dissolved in the aqueous phase are taken into account. We show that\nthe relative abundance of CO2 and NH3 determine the composition of Titan's\natmosphere. For CO2/NH3 < 1, CO2 is massively dissolved in the ocean.

Multi-wavelength observations are indispensable in studying disk\ngeometry and dust evolution processes in protoplanetary disks. Aims. We aimed\nto construct a 3-dimensional model of HD 163296 capable of reproducing\nsimultaneously new observations of the disk surface in scattered light with the\nSPHERE instrument and thermal emission continuum observations of the disk\nmidplane with ALMA. We want to determine why the SED of HD 163296 is\nintermediary between the otherwise well-separated group I and group II Herbig\nstars. Methods. The disk was modelled using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer\ncode MCMax3D. The radial dust surface density profile was modelled after the\nALMA observations, while the polarized scattered light observations were used\nto constrain the inclination of the inner disk component and turbulence and\ngrain growth in the outer disk. Results. While three rings are observed in the\ndisk midplane in millimeter thermal emission at $\\sim$80, 124 and 200 AU, only\nthe innermost of these is observed in polarized scattered light, indicating a\nlack of small dust grains on the surface of the outer disk. We provide two\nmodels capable of explaining this difference. The first model uses increased\nsettling in the outer disk as a mechanism to bring the small dust grains on the\nsurface of the disk closer to the midplane, and into the shadow cast by the\nfirst ring. The second model uses depletion of the smallest dust grains in the\nouter disk as a mechanism for decreasing the optical depth at optical and NIR\nwavelengths. In the region outside the fragmentation-dominated regime, such\ndepletion is expected from state-of-the-art dust evolution models. We studied\nthe effect of creating an artificial inner cavity in our models, and conclude\nthat HD 163296 might be a precursor to typical group I sources. \n\n"}

II:\n  Application to Diffuse Interstellar Radio Synchrotron Emission Abstract: Diagnostics of polarized emission provide us with valuable information on the\nGalactic magnetic field and the state of turbulence in the interstellar medium,\nwhich cannot be obtained from synchrotron intensity alone. In Paper I (Herron\net al. 2017b), we derived polarization diagnostics that are rotationally and\ntranslationally invariant in the $Q$-$U$ plane, similar to the polarization\ngradient. In this paper, we apply these diagnostics to simulations of ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence that have a range of sonic and Alfv\\'enic Mach\nnumbers. We generate synthetic images of Stokes $Q$ and $U$ for these\nsimulations, for the cases where the turbulence is illuminated from behind by\nuniform polarized emission, and where the polarized emission originates from\nwithin the turbulent volume. From these simulated images we calculate the\npolarization diagnostics derived in Paper I, for different lines of sight\nrelative to the mean magnetic field, and for a range of frequencies. For all of\nour simulations, we find that the polarization gradient is very similar to the\ngeneralized polarization gradient, and that both trace spatial variations in\nthe magnetoionic medium for the case where emission originates within the\nturbulent volume, provided that the medium is not supersonic. We propose a\nmethod for distinguishing the cases of emission coming from behind or within a\nturbulent, Faraday rotating medium, and a method to partly map the rotation\nmeasure of the observed region. We also speculate on statistics of these\ndiagnostics that may allow us to constrain the physical properties of an\nobserved turbulent region. \n\n"}

Here, we\ninvestigate the combined effect of gas angular momentum and radiation feedback\non the accretion flow, by performing 2D axially symmetric radiation\nhydrodynamics simulations that solve the flow structure across the Bondi radius\nand the outer part of the accretion disc simultaneously. The accreting gas with\nfinite angular momentum forms a rotationally-supported disc inside the Bondi\nradius, where the accretion proceeds by the angular momentum transport due to\nassumed alpha-type viscosity. We find that the interplay of radiation and\nangular momentum significantly suppresses accretion even if the radiative\nfeedback is weakened in an equatorial shadowing region. The accretion rate is\nO(alpha)\\sim O(0.01-0.1) times the Bondi value, where alpha is the viscosity\nparameter.

But we show the usual method for\nassigning absorbed photon momentum to gas in numerical radiation-hydrodynamics\nsimulations (integrating over cell volumes or evaluating at cell centers) can\nseverely under-estimate the RP force in the immediate vicinity around\nun-resolved (point/discrete) sources (and subsequently under-estimate its\neffects on bulk gas properties), unless photon mean-free-paths are\nhighly-resolved in the fluid grid. The existence of this error is independent\nof the numerical radiation transfer (RT) method (even in exact\nray-tracing/Monte-Carlo methods), because it depends on how the RT solution is\ninterpolated back onto fluid elements. Brute-force convergence (resolving\nmean-free paths) is impossible in many cases (especially where UV/ionizing\nphotons are involved). Instead, we show a 'face-integrated' method --\nintegrating and applying the momentum fluxes at interfaces between fluid\nelements -- better approximates the correct solution at all resolution levels.\nThe 'fix' is simple and we provide example implementations for ray-tracing,\nMonte-Carlo, and moments RT methods in both grid and mesh-free fluid schemes.\nWe consider an example of star formation in a molecular cloud with UV/ionizing\nRP. At state-of-the-art resolution, cell-integrated methods under-estimate the\nnet effects of RP by an order of magnitude, leading (incorrectly) to the\nconclusion that RP is unimportant, while face-integrated methods predict strong\nself-regulation of star formation and cloud destruction via RP. \n\n"}

Using a nested sampling algorithm, we fit these\nper-star distance-reddening measurements to find the distances to the CO\nvelocity slices towards each star-forming region. This results in distance\nestimates explicitly tied to the velocity structure of the molecular gas. We\ndetermine distances to the B5, IC348, B1, NGC1333, L1448, and L1451\nstar-forming regions and find that individual clouds are located between\n$\\approx 275-300$ pc, with typical combined uncertainties of $\\approx 5\\%$.

The remaining $82.5\\%$ should be in binaries with\nsubdwarfs, white dwarfs or neutron stars, because those systems either remained\nbound post-supernova or avoided the supernova entirely. Using a Bayesian\nmethodology, we compare the hypothesis that each Be star in our catalogue is a\nrunaway to the null hypothesis that it is a member of the Milky Way disc. We\nfind that $13.1^{+2.6}_{-2.4}\\%$ of the Be stars in our catalogue are runaways,\nand identify a subset of 40 high-probability runaways. We argue that\ndeficiencies in our understanding of binary stellar evolution, as well as the\ndegeneracy between velocity dispersion and number of runaway stars, can explain\nthe slightly lower runaway fraction. We thus conclude that all Be stars could\nbe explained by an origin in mass-transfer binaries. This conclusion is\ntestable with the second Gaia data release (DR2). \n\n"}

All of these characteristics are consistent\nwith models of self-scattering of submillimeter-wave emission from an optically\nthin inclined disk. The distribution of the polarization position angles across\nthe disk reveals that while the average orientation is along the minor axis,\nthe polarization orientations show a significant spread in angles; this can\nalso be explained by models of pure scattering. We compare the polarization\nwith that of the Class I/II source HL Tau. A comparison of cuts of the\npolarization fraction across the major and minor axes of both sources reveals\nthat IM Lup has a substantially higher polarization fraction than HL Tau toward\nthe center of the disk. This enhanced polarization fraction could be due a\nnumber of factors, including higher optical depth in HL Tau, or scattering by\nlarger dust grains in the more evolved IM Lup disk. However, models yield\nsimilar maximum grain sizes for both HL Tau (72 $\\mu$m) and IM Lup (61 $\\mu$m,\nthis work).

Due to the ejection\nlocation, such a HVS initially has negligible azimuthal angular momentum Lz ~ 0\nkpc km/s. Even if the halo is mildly triaxial, Lz of a recently ejected nearby\nHVS remains negligible, since its flight time from the Galactic Center is too\nshort to accumulate noticeable torque. However, if we make a wrong assumption\nabout the Solar position and velocity, such a HVS would apparently have\nnoticeable non-zero azimuthal angular momentum, due to the wrong reflex motion\nof the Sun. Conversely, with precise astrometric data for a nearby HVS, we can\nmeasure the Solar position and velocity by assuming that the HVS has zero\nazimuthal angular momentum.

For the symmetric waves\nconvection is confined to high latitude in both hemispheres but is only\nrestricted to one hemisphere close to the pole in the case of asymmetric waves.\nThis is in contrast to what is previously known from studies in the field.\nThese periodic flows, in which the pattern is rotating steadily in the\nazimuthal direction, develop a strong axisymmetric component very close to\nonset. Using stability analysis of periodic orbits the regions of stability are\ndetermined and the topology of the stable/unstable oscillatory flows bifurcated\nfrom the branches of rotating waves is described.

Our\nstudy is based on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS)\nphotometric galaxy catalogue,associated with photometric redshifts. We\nconstructed LFs inside a scaled radius using a selection in photometric\nredshift around the cluster spectroscopic redshift in order to reduce\nprojection effects. The width of the photometric redshift selection was\ncarefully determined to avoid biasing the LF and depended on both the cluster\nredshift and the galaxy magnitudes. The purity was then enhanced by applying a\nprecise background subtraction. We constructed composite luminosity functions\n(CLFs) by stacking the individual LFs and studied their evolution with redshift\nand richness, analysing separately the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and\nnon-BCG members. We fitted the dependences of the CLFs and BCG distributions\nparameters with redshift and richness conjointly in order to distinguish\nbetween these two effects.

The generated\nspectra contain several tens of thousands of molecular emission lines of H2O,\nOH, CO, CO2, HCN, C2H2, H2 and a few other molecules, as well as the forbidden\natomic emission lines of SI, SII, SIII, SiII, FeII, NeII, NeIII, ArII and\nArIII. In contrast to previously published works, we do not treat the\nabundances of the molecules nor the temperature in the disc as free parameters,\nbut use the complex results of detailed 2D ProDiMo disc models concerning gas\nand dust temperature structure, and molecular concentrations. FLiTs computes\nthe line emission spectra by ray tracing in an efficient, fast and reliable\nway. The results are broadly consistent with R=600 Spitzer/IRS observational\ndata of T Tauri stars concerning line strengths, colour, and line ratios. In\norder to achieve that agreement, however, we need to assume either a high\ngas/dust mass ratio of order 1000, or the presence of illuminated disc walls at\ndistances of a few au. The molecules in these walls cannot be photo-dissociated\neasily by UV because of the large densities in the walls which favour their\nre-formation.

It opens up the exciting possibility of detecting and\ncharacterizing magnetic fields and grain growth in disks around young stellar\nobjects. However, to use polarization for probing the disk properties, its\nproduction mechanism must be ascertained first. To date, the conventional\nmechanism involving magnetically aligned grains fails to explain the\npolarization patterns detected in most disks. This is especially true for the\ninclined disk of HL Tau in ALMA Band 3 (wavelength $\\sim 3$ mm), which has an\nelliptical polarization pattern. The elliptical pattern was taken as evidence\nfor polarized emission by dust grains aligned with their long axes\nperpendicular the direction of the radiative flux.

We\nfurther discovered three planetary nebulae (PNe) that are likely part of this\ngalaxy. While five of the clusters had velocities measured in the literature,\nwe were able to confirm the membership of two more candidates through precise\nradial velocity measurements, which increases the measured specific frequency\nof GCs in DF2. The mean velocity of the diffuse stellar body,\n1792.9$^{-1.8}_{+1.4}$~\\kms, is consistent with the mean globular cluster\nvelocity. We detect a weak but significant velocity gradient within the stellar\nbody, with a kinematic axis close to the photometric major-axis, making it a\nprolate-like rotator. We estimate a velocity dispersion from the clusters and\nPNe of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}=10.6^{+3.9}_{-2.3}$~\\kms. The velocity dispersion\n$\\sigma_{\\rm{DF2}\\star}$(\\re) for the stellar body within one effective radius\nis $10.8^{-4.0}_{+3.2}$~\\kms. Considering various sources of systemic\nuncertainties this central value varies between 5 and 13~\\kms, and we\nconservatively report a 95\\% confidence upper limit to the dispersion within\none \\re\\ of 21~\\kms. We provide updated mass estimates based on these\ndispersions corresponding to the different distances to NGC~1052-DF2 that have\nbeen reported in the recent literature. \n\n"}

We have searched the\nrecently-released North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves\n(NANOGrav) 11-year data set for GWs from individual SMBHBs in circular orbits.\nAs we did not find strong evidence for GWs in our data, we placed 95\\% upper\nlimits on the strength of GWs from such sources as a function of GW frequency\nand sky location. We placed a sky-averaged upper limit on the GW strain of $h_0\n< 7.3(3) \\times 10^{-15}$ at $f_\\mathrm{gw}= 8$ nHz. We also developed a\ntechnique to determine the significance of a particular signal in each pulsar\nusing ``dropout' parameters as a way of identifying spurious signals in\nmeasurements from individual pulsars. We used our upper limits on the GW strain\nto place lower limits on the distances to individual SMBHBs.

The magnetic field helps shape and reinforce the long\nfilamentary structures.

Unless the line-of-sight is close to the mean field direction, the\nlarge-scale magnetic field and striations in the simulation are found roughly\nperpendicular to the long axis of the main cloud, similar to 1495.

The jets shock\nthe normal interstellar gas along the first 350 pc of their length, causing the\nhot, X-ray emitting cocoons noted above.

It is\nreasonable to truncate the Taylor series if $|n'_* ln(k/k_*)| << |n_*-1|$, but\nit is not if $|n'_* ln(k/k_*)| \\gtrsim |n_*-1|$. We argue that there is no good\ntheoretical reason to prefer $|n'_*| << |n_*-1|$, and show that current\nobservations are consistent with $|n'_* ln(k/k_*)| ~ |n_*-1|$ even for\n$|ln(k/k_*)| ~ 1$. Thus, there are regions of parameter space, which are both\ntheoretically and observationally relevant, for which the traditional truncated\nTaylor series parameterization is inconsistent, and hence it can lead to\nincorrect parameter estimations. Motivated by this, we propose a simple\nextension of the traditional parameterization, which uses no extra parameters,\nbut that, unlike the traditional approach, covers well motivated inflationary\nspectra with $|n'_*| ~ |n_*-1|$. Our parameterization therefore covers not only\nstandard-slow-roll inflation models but also a much wider class of inflation\nmodels.

The host is a low-luminosity (M_r = -16.75), blue galaxy with\nstrong indications of active star formation and an environment similar to that\nexpected for SNe Ia at high redshifts. Early-time (t ~ -10 days) optical\nspectra obtained with the HET reveal an asymmetric, triangular-shaped Si II\nabsorption feature at about 6100 \\AA with a sharp transition to the continuum\nat a blue shift of about 24,000 km s^-1. By 4 days before maximum, the Si II\nabsorption feature becomes symmetric with smoothly curved sides. Similar Si II\nprofile evolution has previously been observed in other supernovae, and is\npredicted by some explosion models, but its significance has not been fully\nrecognized. Although the spectra predicted by pure deflagration and delayed\ndetonation models are similar near maximum light, they predict qualitatively\ndifferent chemical abundances in the outer layers and thus give qualitatively\ndifferent spectra at the earliest phases.

By using a new\napproach we find, as suggested before, that the collision of the winds blown by\nthe two stars can explain the X-ray emission and temporal behavior. Most X-ray\nemission in the $2-10 \\kev$ band results from the shocked secondary stellar\nwind.

Absorption, particularly of the soft X-rays from\nthe primary wind, increases as the system approaches periastron and the shocks\nare produced deep inside the primary wind. However, absorption can not account\nfor the drastic X-ray minimum. The 70 day minimum is assumed to result from the\ncollapse of the collision region of the two winds onto the secondary star.

The clumps accrete material from the remaining disc and merge into\nlarger clumps; the upper mass of a merged clump is a few tens to a few hundreds\nof solar mass. This picture fits well with the observed young stellar discs\nnear the SgrA* black hole in the Galactic Center. In particular, we show how\nthe masses and spatial distribution of the young stars, and the total mass in\nthe Galactic Center discs can be explained. However, explaining the origin of\nthe several young stars closest to the black hole (the S-stars) is more\nproblematic: their orbits are compact, eccentric, and have random orientation.\nWe propose that the S-stars were born in a previous starburst(s), and then\nmigrated through their parent disc via type I or runaway migration. Their\norbits were then randomized by the Rauch-Tremaine resonant relaxation. We then\nexplore the consequences of the star-formation scenario for AGN discs, which\nare continuously resupplied with gas.

We first present a\nclassification scheme that allows to distinguish between haloes in clusters,\nfilaments, sheets and voids in the large-scale distribution of matter. This\nmethod is based on a local-stability criterion for the orbits of test particles\nand closely relates to the Zel'dovich approximation. Applying this scheme to\nour simulations we then find that: i) Mass assembly histories and formation\nredshifts strongly depend on environment for haloes of mass M<M* (haloes of a\ngiven mass tend to be older in clusters and younger in voids) and are\nindependent of it for larger masses; ii) Low-mass haloes in clusters are\ngenerally less spherical and more oblate than in other regions; iii) Low-mass\nhaloes in clusters have a higher median spin than in filaments and present a\nmore prominent fraction of rapidly spinning objects; we identify recent major\nmergers as a likely source of this effect. For all these relations, we provide\naccurate functional fits as a function of halo mass and environment.

Abstract: Beaming of relativistic ejecta in GRBs has been postulated by many authors in\norder to reduce the total GRB energy, thus it is very important to look for the\nobservational evidence of beaming. Rhoads (1999) has pointed out that the\ndynamics of the blast wave, which is formed when the beamed ejecta sweeping the\nexternal medium, will be significantly modified by the sideways expansion due\nto the increased swept up matter. He claimed that shortly after the bulk\nLorentz factor ($\\Gamma $) of the blast wave drops below the inverse of the\ninitial opening angle ($\\theta_{0}$) of the beamed ejecta, there will be a\nsharp break in the afterglow light curves. However, some other authors have\nperformed numerical calculations and shown that the break of the light curve is\nweaker and much smoother than the one analytically predicted. In this paper we\nreanalyse the dynamical evolution of the jet blast wave, calculate the jet\nemission analytically, we find that the sharp break predicted by Rhoads will\nactually not exist, and for most cases the afterglow light curve will almost\nnot be affected by sideways expansion unless the beaming angle is extremely\nsmall. We demonstrate that only when $\\theta_{0}<0.1$, the afterglow light\ncurves may be steepened by sideways expansion, and in fact there cannot be two\nbreaks as claimed before.
