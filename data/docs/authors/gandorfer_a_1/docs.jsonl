For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\nchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are\nnot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\nexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA. \n\n"}

The VL\nrelation at I- and K-bands is independent of surface brightness, size and light\nconcentration. The log-slope of the I- and K-band RL relations is a strong\nfunction of morphology and varies from 0.25 to 0.5. The average dispersion\nsigma_ln(RL) decreases from 0.33 at I-band to 0.29 at K, likely due to the\n2MASS selection bias against lower surface brightness galaxies.

However, the observed polarization may be modified\ndue to photon propagation through the star's magnetosphere. For photon\nfrequencies much larger than the typical radio frequency, vacuum birefringence\ndue to strong-field quantum electrodynamics dominates over the plasma effect.\nWe study the evolution of photon polarization in the magnetized QED vacuum of a\nneutron star magnetosphere, paying particular attention to the propagation\neffect across the quasi-tangential (QT) point, where the photon momentum is\nnearly aligned with the magnetic field. In agreement with previous studies, we\nfind that in most regions of the magnetosphere, the photon polarization modes\nare decoupled due to vacuum birefringence, and therefore a large net linear\npolarization can be expected when the radiation escapes the magnetosphere.\nHowever, we show that X-ray polarization may change significantly when the\nphoton passes through the QT region. When averaging over a finite emission\narea, the net effect of QT propagation is to reduce the degree of linear\npolarization; the reduction factor depends on the photon energy, magnetic field\nstrength, geometry, rotation phase and the emission area, and can be more than\na factor of two.

We use this\ntechnique to show that the disc blackbody component varies on all time-scales,\nbut varies more, relative to the power-law, on longer time-scales. This\nbehaviour explains the additional long-term variability seen in the soft band.\nComparison of the blackbody and iron line normalisations seen in the covariance\nspectra in GX 339-4 implies that the short-term blackbody variations are driven\nby thermal reprocessing of the power-law continuum absorbed by the disc.\nHowever, since the amplitude of variable reflection is the same on long and\nshort time-scales, we rule out reprocessing as the cause of the enhanced disc\nvariability on long time-scales.

Analysis of the data reveals a spectrum of solar-like acoustic\noscillations. However, the faintness of the target (m_v=7.65) means the\nsignal-to-noise (S/N) in the acoustic modes is quite low, and this low S/N\nleads to complications in the analysis.

The goal of the Coma survey\nwas to measure precise rotation periods for main-sequence F, G and K dwarfs in\nthis intermediate-age (~600 Myr) cluster, and to determine the extent to which\nmagnetic braking has caused the stellar spin periods to converge. We find a\ntight, almost linear relationship between rotation period and J-K colour with a\nroot-mean square scatter of only 2 percent. The relation is similar to that\nseen among F, G and K stars in the Hyades. Such strong convergence can only be\nexplained if angular momentum is not at present being transferred from a\nreservoir in the deep stellar interiors to the surface layers. We conclude that\nthe coupling timescale for angular momentum transport from a rapidly-spinning\nradiative core to the outer convective zone must be substantially shorter than\nthe cluster age, and that from the age of Coma onward, stars rotate effectively\nas solid bodies.

Our approach confines the\nanalysis only to the relevant portions of the hosts, allowing us to show that\neven so-called \"prompt\" SNe Ia that trace star-formation on cosmic timescales\nexhibit a significant delay time of 200-500 million years. This implies that\neither the majority of Ia companion stars have main-sequence masses less than 3\nsolar masses, or that most SNe Ia arise from double-white dwarf binaries. Our\nresults are also consistent with a SNe Ia rate that traces the white dwarf\nformation rate, scaled by a fixed efficiency factor. \n\n"}

To visualize the flow pattern\nin the low photosphere, we used a bisector of the wing of the absorption lines.\nDue to the small heliocentric angle (3 < Theta < 9) of our data sets, the\nhorizontal component of the Evershed flow (EF) does not contribute\nsignificantly to the line shift. We found that in the quiet Sun (QS), the area\nshowing up-flows is always larger than the one exhibiting down-flows. In the\npenumbra, up-flows dominate only at low velocities |v_dop| < 0.4 km/s while at\nlarger velocities |v_dop| > 0.6 km/s down-flows prevail. Additionally, the\nmaximal up-flow velocity in penumbrae is smaller, while the maximal down-flow\nvelocity is larger with respect to the QS velocities. Furthermore, on a spatial\naverage, the penumbra shows a red-shift, corresponding to a down-flow of more\nthan 0.1 km/s. Up-flows are elongated and appear predominately in the inner\npenumbra. Strong down-flows with velocities of up to 9 km/s are concentrated at\nthe penumbra-QS boundary.

A significant suppression in the 21cm angular power spectrum\nduring this transition is anticipated as the result of negative contribution of\nthe cross-correlation between the absorption of diffuse neutral hydrogen and\nthe emission components. Therefore, an accurate prediction of the cosmic 21cm\npower spectrum should take the cross-correlation into account especially at the\ntransition phase. \n\n"}

The\ncomposition of the models is also consistent with C abundances measured in\nmainstream silicon carbide grains.

We detect a distinct Be\nstar sequence, displaced to the red, and suggest a novel method of confirming\nBe star candidates photometrically. We find a higher fraction of Oe and Be\nstars among O and early-B stars in the SMC, respectively, when compared to the\nLMC, and that the SMC Be stars occur at higher luminosities.

The Symbiotic Channel Abstract: In order for a white dwarf (WD) to achieve the Chandrasekhar mass, M_C, and\nexplode as a Type Ia supernova (SNIa), it must interact with another star,\neither accreting matter from or merging with it. The failure to identify the\ntypes of binaries which produce SNeIa is the \"progenitor problem\". Its solution\nis required if we are to utilize the full potential of SNeIa to elucidate basic\ncosmological and physical principles. In single-degenerate models, a WD\naccretes and burns matter at high rates. Nuclear-burning WDs (NBWDs) with mass\nclose to M_C are hot and luminous, potentially detectable as supersoft x-ray\nsources (SSSs). In previous work we showed that > 90-99% of the required number\nof progenitors do not appear as SSSs during most of the crucial phase of mass\nincrease. The obvious implication is that double-degenerate (DD) binaries form\nthe main class of progenitors. We show in this paper, however, that many\nbinaries that later become DDs must pass through a long-lived NBWD phase during\nwhich they are potentially detectable as SSSs. The paucity of SSSs is therefore\nnot a strong argument in favor of DD models. Those NBWDs that are the\nprogenitors of DD binaries are likely to appear as symbiotic binaries for\nintervals > 10^6 years. In fact, symbiotic pre-DDs should be common, whether or\nnot the WDs eventually produce SNeIa. The key to solving the progenitor problem\nlies in understanding the appearance of NBWDs. Most do not appear as SSSs most\nof the time. We therefore consider the evolution of NBWDs to address the\nquestion of what their appearance may be and how we can hope to detect them. \n\n"}

These parameters are mainly determined by the WD's\ninitial mass and its cooling time, respectively. Using the progenitor model\ndeveloped by Meng and Yang, we present the distributions of the initial WD mass\nand the cooling time.

Unfortunately, the RM effect\nonly measures the angle between the orbit of a transiting exoplanet and the\nspin of its host star projected in the plane of sky, leaving unconstrained the\ncompliment misalignment angle between the orbit of the planet and the spin of\nits host star along the line of sight.

The fate of a given binary system is\ndetermined by the initial masses of the primary and companion, the initial\norbit (taken to be circular), the Reimers mass-loss parameter, and the tidal\nprescription employed. For a range of these parameters, we determine whether\nthe orbit expands due to mass loss or decays due to tidal torques. Where a\ncommon envelope (CE) phase ensues, we estimate the final orbital separation\nbased on the energy required to unbind the envelope. These calculations predict\nperiod gaps for planetary and brown dwarf companions to white dwarfs. In\nparticular, the lower end of the gap is the longest period at which companions\nsurvive their CE phase while the upper end of the gap is the shortest period at\nwhich a CE phase is avoided.

The spots are meridionally elongated and are\nlocated at higher latitudes, compared with the pure dipole case, where\ncrescent-shaped, latitudinally elongated spots form at lower latitudes.

In the test-mass limit,\nwell-defined ISCO conditions exist for the Kerr and Schwarzschild spacetimes.\nIn the finite-mass case, there are a large variety of ways to define an ISCO in\na post-Newtonian (PN) context. Here I generalize the gauge-invariant ISCO\ncondition of Blanchet & Iyer (2003) to the case of spinning (nonprecessing)\nbinaries. The Blanchet-Iyer ISCO condition has two desirable and unexpected\nproperties: (1) it exactly reproduces the Schwarzschild ISCO in the test-mass\nlimit, and (2) it accurately approximates the recently-calculated shift in the\nSchwarzschild ISCO frequency due to the conservative-piece of the gravitational\nself-force [Barack & Sago (2009)]. The generalization of this ISCO condition to\nspinning binaries has the property that it also exactly reproduces the Kerr\nISCO in the test-mass limit (up to the order at which PN spin corrections are\ncurrently known). The shift in the ISCO due to the spin of the test-particle is\nalso calculated. Remarkably, the gauge-invariant PN ISCO condition exactly\nreproduces the ISCO shift predicted by the Papapetrou equations for a\nfully-relativistic spinning particle.

Although the gamma-process has been successful in\nproducing a large range of p-nuclei, two mass regions remain problematic, A<110\nand 150<A<165, where a number of p-nuclei are severely underproduced. The\norigin of the problems is yet to be identified. A large number of unstable\nnuclei with only theoretically predicted reaction rates are included in the\nreaction network and thus the nuclear input may involve uncertainties.\nDeficiencies in charged-particle optical potentials at gamma-process\ntemperatures have been found for nuclei at stability. On the other hand, the\ngamma-process conditions (temperature profiles, entropy of the O shell, seed\ncomposition) also sensitively depend on details of the stellar structure and\nevolution, as well as on the initial metallicity. Nevertheless, especially the\ndeficient low-mass p-nuclei may call for an additional production process or\nsite, such as production in (subChandrasekhar) type Ia supernovae. Also the\n(im)possibility of a synthesis in the rp- and nu-p-processes is discussed. Were\nthis the case, the production of p-nuclei would be realized as a superposition\nof several different processes, not necessarily in the same site. \n\n"}

Two of the remaining\ntargets belong to the dominant metal-poor population (MP) at [Fe/H]~-1.7 dex,\nand the last one to the metal-intermediate (MInt) one at [Fe/H]~-1.2 dex.

In\nthis paper, we analyze simultaneous energy and angular-momentum conservation,\nand show that the gamma-prescription cannot adequately describe a CE event for\nan arbitrary binary, nor can the first phase of mass loss always be understood\nin general as a dynamical-timescale event.

Two\nadditional parameters ($\\x_{off}$ and $\\rho_{rms}$) are used to describe the\ndegree of `relaxedness' of the halo. We find that we can account for much of\nthe variance of these properties with halo mass and concentration, on the one\nhand, and halo relaxedness on the other. Nonetheless, three principle\ncomponents are usually required to account for most of the variance. We argue\nthat halo mass is not as dominant as expected, which is a challenge for halo\noccupation models and semi-analytic models that assume that mass determines\nother halo (and galaxy) properties. In addition, we find that the angle\n$\\Phi_L$ is not significantly correlated with other halo parameters, which may\npresent a difficulty for models in which galaxy disks are oriented in haloes in\na particular way. Finally, at fixed mass, we find that a halo's environment\n(quantified by the large-scale overdensity) is relatively unimportant. \n\n"}

We have\ncarried out wide field $UBVI_c$ and deep $VI_c$ photometry of the W5 E H{\\sc\nii} region. A distance of $\\sim$2.1 kpc and a mean age of $\\sim$1.3 Myr have\nbeen obtained for the central cluster. The young stellar objects (YSOs)\nassociated with the region are identified on the basis of near-infrared and\nmid-infrared observations.

Aspherical ejecta are produced by prescribing a latitudinal scaling or\nstretching of SN ejecta inputs obtained from 1-D non-LTE time-dependent\ncalculations. We study polarisation signatures as a function of inclination,\nshape factor, wavelength, line identity, post-explosion time. At early times,\ncancellation and optical-depth effects make the polarisation intrinsically low,\ncausing complicated sign reversals with inclination or continuum wavelength,\nand across line profiles. While the line polarisation is positive (negative)\nfor an oblate (prolate) morphology at the peak and in the red wing, the\ncontinuum polarisation may be of any sign. These complex polarisation\nvariations are produced not just by the asymmetric distribution of scatterers\nbut also of the flux. Our early-time signatures are in contradiction with\npredictions for a centrally illuminated aspherical nebula, although this\nbecomes a better approximation at nebular times. For a fixed asymmetry, our\nsynthetic continuum polarisation is generally low, may evolve non-monotonically\nduring the plateau phase, but it systematically rises as the ejecta become\noptically thin. Changes in polarization over time do not necessarily imply a\nchange in the asymmetry of the ejecta. The SN structure (e.g.,\ndensity/ionization) critically influences the level of polarisation.\nImportantly, a low polarisation (<0.5%) at early times does not necessarily\nimply a low degree of asymmetry as usually assumed. Asphericity influences\nline-profile morphology and the luminosity, which may compromise the accuracy\nof SN characteristics inferred from these. \n\n"}

Due to the low gas density in SNe Ia with no H-envelope, the\naverage radii of the newly formed grains are generally below 0.01 micron, being\nmuch smaller than those in Type II-P SNe. This supports our previous conclusion\nthat the radius of dust formed in the ejecta is smaller in SNe with less\nmassive envelopes. The total dust mass ranges from 3x10^{-4} M_sun to 0.2 M_sun\nfor alpha_j=0.1--1, depending on whether or not CO and SiO molecules are\nformed.

The\naverage FIR-to-AGN UV luminosity ratio of this faint quasar sample is about two\ntimes higher than that of the bright quasars at z~6 (m_1450<20.2). A fit to the\naverage FIR and AGN bolometric luminosities of both the UV/optically faint and\nbright z~6 quasars, and the average luminosities of samples of submillimeter\n/millimeter-observed quasars at z~2 to 5, yields a relationship of L_{FIR}\n{L_{bol}}^{0.62}. Five of the 18 faint z~6 quasars have been detected at 250\nGHz. These 250 GHz detections, as well as most of the millimeter-detected\noptically bright z~6 quasars, follow a shallower trend of L_{FIR}\n{L_{bol}}^{0.45} defined by the starburst-AGN systems in local and high-z\nuniverse. The millimeter continuum detections in the five objects and molecular\nCO detections in three of them reveal a few x10^8 M_sun of FIR-emitting warm\ndust and 10^10 M_sun of molecular gas in the quasar host galaxies. All these\nresults argue for massive star formation in the quasar host galaxies, with\nestimated star formation rates of a few hundred M_sun yr^{-1}.

A CCD survey of\nthe cluster on the UBVI and uvbyCaHbeta systems shows that the cluster is\nsuperposed upon a heavily reddened field of background stars with E(B-V) > 0.35\nmag, while the cluster has small and uniform reddening at E(b-y) = 0.075 +/-\n0.008 mag or E(B-V) = 0.103 +/- 0.011 mag, based upon 48 and 61 probable A and\nF dwarf single-star members, respectively. The errors quoted include both\ninternal photometric precision and external photometric uncertainties. The\nmetallicity derived from 61 probable single F-star members is [Fe/H] = -0.058\n+/- 0.027 (sem) from m_1 and 0.010 +/- 0.020 (sem) from hk, for a weighted\naverage of [Fe/H] = -0.019 +/- 0.023, where the errors refer to the internal\nerrors from the photometry alone. With reddening and metallicity fixed, the\ncluster age and apparent distance modulus are obtained through a comparison to\nappropriate isochrones in both VI and BV, producing 0.9 +/- 0.1 Gyr and 9.85\n+/- 0.15, respectively. The giant branch remains dominated by two distinct\nclumps of stars, though the brighter clump seems a better match to the\ncore-He-burning phase while the fainter clump straddles the first-ascent red\ngiant branch.

The\naccretion flow thus depends on the geometry of the magnetic field. This paper\nextends previous work by constructing a collection of orthogonal coordinate\nsystems, including the corresponding differential operators, where one\ncoordinate traces the magnetic field lines. This formalism allows for an\n(essentially) analytic description of the geometry and the conditions required\nfor the flow to pass through sonic points. Using this approach, we revisit the\nproblem of magnetically controlled accretion flow in a dipole geometry, and\nthen generalize the treatment to consider magnetic fields with multiple\ncomponents, including dipole, octupole, and split monopole contributions. This\napproach can be generalized further to consider more complex magnetic field\nconfigurations. Observations indicate that accreting young stars have\nsubstantial dipole and octupole components, and that accretion flow is\ntransonic. If the effective equation of state for the fluid is too stiff, the\nflow cannot pass smoothly through the sonic points in steady state. For a\nmultipole field of order \\ell, we derive a constraint on the polytropic index,\nn>\\ell+3/2, required for steady transonic flow to reach free-fall velocities.\nFor octupole fields, inferred on surfaces of T Tauri stars, n>9/2, so that the\nflow must be close to isothermal. The inclusion of octupole field components\nproduces higher densities at the stellar surface and smaller hot spots, which\noccur at higher latitudes; the magnetic truncation radius is also modified.\nThis contribution thus increases our understanding of magnetically controlled\naccretion for young stellar objects and can be applied to a variety of\nadditional astrophysical problems. \n\n"}

Magnetic flux in the immediate surroundings is\nincorporated into the spot, and new flux is supplied via small flux patches\n(SFPs), which on average have a flux of 2-3E+18 Mx. The spot's flux increase\nrate of 4.2E+16 Mx/s corresponds to the merging of one SFP per minute. We also\nfind that during the formation of the spot penumbra: a) the maximum magnetic\nfield strength of the umbra does not change, b) the magnetic neutral line keeps\nthe same position relative to the umbra, c) the new flux arrives on the\nemergence side of the spot while the penumbra forms on the opposite side, d)\nthe average LRF inclination of the light bridges decreases from 50 to 37 deg,\nand e) as the penumbra develops, the mean magnetic field strength at the spot\nborder decreases from 1.0 to 0.8 kG. The SFPs associated with elongated\ngranules are the building blocks of structure formation in active regions.\nDuring the sunspot formation, their contribution is comparable to the\ncoalescence of pores. A quiet environment in the surroundings is important for\npenumbral formation. As remnants of trapped granulation between merging pores,\nthe light bridges are found to play a crucial role in the formation process.\nThey seem to channel the magnetic flux through the spot during its formation.\nLight bridges are also the locations where the first penumbral filaments form. \n\n"}

For the\nlarge majority of stars with masses 0.7 < M/M_sun < 0.9 and heavy-element mass\nfractions 0.001 < Z < 0.006, the Li abundance is well fitted by a relation\nA(Li) = a0 + a1 M + a2 Z + a3 M Z, where a0, a1, a2, and a3 are constants.\nExtrapolating this relation to Z = 0 leads to a Li abundance close to the\nprimordial value predicted from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis calculations\nand the WMAP baryon density. The relation, however, does not apply to stars\nwith [Fe/H] < -1.5.

The properties of the polarization and\nflux spectra can be understood within the framework of a subluminous\ndelayed-detonation (DD), or pulsating DD scenario, or WD mergers.

The comparatively\nhigh level of continuum polarization is explained in terms of a significant\nglobal asymmetry (~15%), which is well reproduced by an oblate ellipsoidal\ngeometry. Our results suggest that SN2005ke arose either from a\nsingle-degenerate system in which the WD is especially rapidly rotating, close\nto the break-up velocity, or from a double-degenerate merger.

M dwarfs have special properties\nthat have not been considered in most work on the progenitors of SNIa: they\nhave small but finite magnetic fields, and they flare frequently. These\nproperties are explored in the context of SNIa progenitors. White dwarf/M dwarf\npairs may be sufficiently plentiful to provide an adequate rate of explosions.\nEven modest magnetic fields on the white dwarf and M dwarf will yield adequate\ntorques to lock the two stars together, resulting in a slowly rotating white\ndwarf, with the magnetic poles pointing at one another in the orbital plane.\nThe mass loss will be channeled by a \"magnetic bottle\" connecting the two\nstars, landing on a concentrated polar area on the white dwarf. This enhances\nthe effective rate of accretion compared to spherical accretion.

Using the model of\nmagnetic field evolution we developed previously based on the same data, we\nderived an analytical expression for the braking index, which agrees with all\nthe observed statistical properties of the braking indices of the pulsars in\nthe sample of Hobbs et al. Our model is, however, incompatible with the\nprevious interpretation that magnetic field growth is responsible for the small\nvalues of braking indices ($<3$) observed for \"baby\" pulsars with\ncharacteristic ages of less than $2\\times 10^3$ yr.

A handful of wide binary central stars of PNe are known to have\naccreted carbon and slow neutron capture (s-process) enhanced material, the\nimmediate progenitors of barium stars, however no close binary analogues are\nknown to have passed through a common-envelope (CE) phase.

The\nformation and early evolution of binaries is a longstanding problem in star\nformation that is not fully understood. In particular, how the magnetic field\nobserved in star-forming cores shapes the binary characteristics remains\nrelatively unexplored. We demonstrate numerically, using the ENZO-MHD code,\nthat a magnetic field of the observed strength can drastically change two of\nthe basic quantities of a binary system: the orbital separation and mass ratio\nof the two components. Our calculations focus on the protostellar mass\naccretion phase, after a pair of stellar 'seeds' have already formed. We find\nthat, in dense cores magnetized to a realistic level, the angular momentum of\nthe gas accreted by the protobinary is greatly reduced by magnetic braking.\nAccretion of strongly braked material shrinks the protobinary separation by a\nlarge factor compared to the non-magnetic case. The magnetic braking also\nchanges the evolution of the mass ratio of unequal-mass protobinaries by\nproducing gas of low specific angular momentum that accretes preferentially\nonto the primary rather than the secondary. This is in contrast with the\npreferential mass accretion onto the secondary previously found for\nprotobinaries accreting from an unmagnetized envelope, which tends to drive the\nmass ratio towards unity. In addition, the magnetic field greatly modifies the\nmorphology and dynamics of the protobinary accretion flow. It suppresses the\ncircumstellar and circumbinary disks that feed the protobinary in the\nnon-magnetic case; the binary is fed instead by a fast collapsing pseudodisk\nwhose rotation is strongly braked.

In 47 Tuc\nwe found tight relations between the colours of the stars and their abundances\nof p-capture elements. This strongly supports the idea that the He content -\nwhich is expected to be closely correlated with the abundances of p-capture\nelements - is the third parameter (after overall metallicity and age) that\ndetermines the colour of HB stars. However, the range in He abundance must be\nsmall (Delta Y<0.03) in 47 Tuc to reproduce our observations; this agrees with\nprevious analyses. There is possibly a correlation between the abundances of p-\nand n-capture elements in 47 Tuc. If confirmed, this might suggest that AGB\nstars of moderate mass contributed to the gas from which second-generation\nstars formed. Considering the selection effects in our sample (which does not\ninclude stars warmer than 11000 K and RR Lyrae variables) is important to\nunderstand our results for M5. In this case, we find that, as expected, RHB\nstars are Na-poor and O-rich, and likely belong to the primordial population.\nThere is a clear correlation of the [Na/O] ratio and N abundance with colour\nalong the BHB. A derivation of the He abundance for these stars yields a low\nvalue of Y=0.22\\pm 0.03. This is expected because HB stars of a putative\nHe-rich population in this cluster should be warmer than 11000 K, and would\naccordingly not have been sampled by our analysis. However, we need some\nadditional source of scatter in the total mass loss of stars climbing up the\nRGB to reproduce our results for M5.

The Galactic tidal forces acting on planets scale\ninversely with radius in the Galaxy and so are much greater in the inner Galaxy\nthan in the Solar neighbourhood. Within a range of 3.5 to 10 kpc, the vertical\ntide from the Galactic disc is predominant. Interior to 3.5 kpc, the effects of\nthe Galactic bulge cannot be neglected and the in-plane tidal components are as\nimportant as the vertical ones.

When both\nplanes are perpendicular, the eccentricity of the planet is driven to unity,\nalthough the semimajor axis is secularly unaffected.

We simulate the\ninteraction of the mechanical energy input from a cluster with 3 O-stars into a\ngiant molecular cloud (GMC) clump containing 3240 solar masses of molecular\nmaterial within a 4 pc radius. The cluster wind blows out of the molecular\nclump along low-density channels, into which denser clump material is\nentrained. We find that the densest molecular regions are surprisingly\nresistant to ablation by the cluster wind, in part due to shielding by other\ndense regions closer to the cluster. Nonetheless, molecular material is\ngradually removed by the cluster wind during which mass-loading factors in\nexcess of several 100 are obtained. Because the clump is very porous, 60-75 per\ncent of the injected wind energy escapes the simulation domain, with the\ndifference being radiated.

We examine the influence of the X-rays from the\nwind-wind collision shocks on the radiative driving of the stellar winds using\nsteady state models that include a parameterized line force with X-ray\nionization dependence. Our primary result is that X-ray radiation from the\nshocks inhibits wind acceleration and can lead to a lower pre-shock velocity,\nand a correspondingly lower shocked plasma temperature, yet the intrinsic X-ray\nluminosity of the shocks, LX remains largely unaltered, with the exception of a\nmodest increase at small binary separations. Due to the feedback loop between\nthe ionizing X-rays from the shocks and the wind-driving, we term this scenario\nas self regulated shocks. This effect is found to greatly increase the range of\nbinary separations at which a wind-photosphere collision is likely to occur in\nsystems where the momenta of the two winds are significantly different.\nFurthermore, the excessive levels of X-ray ionization close to the shocks\ncompletely suppresses the line force, and we suggest that this may render\nradiative braking less effective. Comparisons of model results against\nobservations reveals reasonable agreement in terms of log(LX/Lbol). The\ninclusion of self regulated shocks improves the match for kT values in roughly\nequal wind momenta systems, but there is a systematic offset for systems with\nunequal wind momenta (if considered to be a wind-photosphere collision). \n\n"}

Here we study a class\nof single planet systems where the stellar mass loss rate is time dependent.\nThe mass loss rate can be increasing or decreasing, but the stellar mass always\ndecreases monotonically. For this class of models, we develop analytic\napproximations to specify the final orbital elements for planets that remain\nbound after the epoch of mass loss, and find the conditions required for the\nplanets to become unbound.

The fragmentation of self-gravitating\nprotostellar discs into gravitationally bound embryos - with masses of a few to\ntens of Jupiter masses, at semi major axes above 30 - 40 au - is followed by\ngrain sedimentation inside the embryo, radial migration towards the central\nstar and tidal disruption of the embryo's upper layers. The properties of the\nresultant object depends sensitively on the timescales upon which each process\noccurs. Therefore, GI followed by tidal downsizing can theoretically produce\nobjects spanning a large mass range, from terrestrial planets to giant planets\nand brown dwarfs. Whether such objects can be formed in practice, and what\nproportions of the observed population they would represent, requires a more\ninvolved statistical analysis.\n  We present a simple population synthesis model of star and planet formation\nvia GI and tidal downsizing. We couple a semi-analytic model of protostellar\ndisc evolution to analytic calculations of fragmentation, initial embryo mass,\ngrain growth and sedimentation, embryo migration and tidal disruption.

Based on these parameters, we improve the theoretical\nprediction of the lower limit of the spindown rate of SGR 0418+5729; for a\nwhite dwarf close to its maximum stable we obtain the very stringent interval\nfor the spindown rate of 4.1E-16< dP/dt < 6E-15, where the upper value is the\nknown observational limit.

This indicates that the smaller holes have higher\nsurface gravity. For analogue Hawking effects, however, the acoustic surface\ngravity is determined by the local values of the dynamical velocity of the\nstationary background fluid flow and the speed of propagation of the\ncharacteristic perturbation embedded in the background fluid, as well as by\ntheir space derivatives evaluated along the direction normal to the acoustic\nhorizon, respectively. The mass of the analogue system - whether classical or\nquantum - does not directly contribute to extremise the value of the associated\nacoustic surface gravity. For general relativistic axially symmetric background\nfluid flow in the Schwarzschild metric, we show that the initial boundary\nconditions describing such accretion influence the maximization scheme of the\nacoustic surface gravity and associated analogue temperature. Aforementioned\nbackground flow onto black holes can assume three distinct geometric\nconfigurations.

We use 1-D non-LTE RATRAN radiative transfer models of\nthe observed water lines to constrain the infall velocity and chemistry in the\nprotostellar envelopes of these sources. We assume a free-fall velocity profile\nand, having found the best fit, vary the radii over which infall takes place.\nIn the well-studied Class 0 protostar NGC1333-IRAS4A we find that infall takes\nplace over the whole envelope to which our observations are sensitive (r>~1000\nAU). For 4 sources infall takes place on core to envelope scales (i.e.\n~10000-3000 AU). In 2 sources the inverse P-Cygni profiles seen in the\nground-state lines are more likely due to larger-scale motions or foreground\nclouds. Models including a simple consideration of the chemistry are consistent\nwith the observations, while using step abundance profiles are not. The\nnon-detection of excited water in the inner envelope in 6/7 protostars is\nfurther evidence that water must be heavily depleted from the gas-phase at\nthese radii. Infall in four of the sources is supersonic and infall in all\nsources must take place at the outer edge of the envelope, which may be\nevidence that collapse is global or outside-in rather than inside-out. The mass\ninfall rate in IRAS4A is large (>~10^-4 msol\\yr), higher than the mass outflow\nrate and expected mass accretion rates onto the star, suggesting that any\nflattened disk-like structure on small scales will be gravitationally unstable,\npotentially leading to rotational fragmentation and/or episodic accretion. \n\n"}

While it is usually agreed that single-degenerate progenitor\nsystems would be luminous supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs), it was recently\nsuggested that double-degenerate progenitors might also go through a SSS phase.\nAims: We aim to examine the possibility of double-degenerate progenitor systems\nbeing SSSs, and place stringent upper limits on the maximally possible\ndurations of any SSS phases and expected number of these systems in a galactic\npopulation. Method: We employ the binary population synthesis code SeBa to\nexamine the mass-transfer characteristics of a possible SSS phase of\ndouble-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems for 1) the standard SeBa\nassumptions, and 2) an optimistic best-case scenario. The latter case\nestablishes firm upper limits on the possible population of supersoft source\ndouble-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems. Results: Our results indicate\nthat unlike what is expected for single-degenerate progenitor systems, the vast\nmajority of the material accreted by either pure wind mass transfer or a\ncombination of wind and RLOF mass transfer is helium rather than hydrogen. Even\nwith extremely optimistic assumptions concerning the mass-transfer and\nretention efficiencies, the average mass accreted by systems that eventually\nbecome double-degenerate type Ia SNe is small. Consequently, the lengths of\ntime that these systems may be SSSs are short, even under optimal conditions,\nand the expected number of such systems in a galactic population is negligible.\nConclusions: The population of double-degenerate type Ia SN progenitors that\nare SSSs is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the population of\nsingle-degenerate progenitors expected to be SSSs, and the supersoft X-ray\nbehaviour of double-degenerate systems typically ceases long before the SN\nexplosions. \n\n"}

In\nthis paper we revisit the superradiance-tidal friction analogy within the\ncontext of ultracompact relativistic bodies. We advocate that as long as these\nbodies have non-zero viscosity they should undergo tidal friction that can be\nconstrued as a kind of superradiant scattering from the point of view of the\ndynamics of an orbiting test-body. In addition we consider the presence of\nanisotropic matter, which is required for at least some ultracompact bodies, if\nthey are to sustain a radius very close to the gravitational radius.

Within\nour sample, we can distinguish three groups of stars segregated (though\ncontiguous) in colours: Group 1 (49 stars) is metal-poor, N-normal, Na-poor and\nO-rich with abundances that match those determined for the primordial group of\nRGB stars from previous studies. Group 2 (23 stars) is still metal-poor, but it\nis N- and Na-rich, though only very mildly depleted in O.

The third group (20\nstars) is metal-rich, Na-rich, and O-rich and likely corresponds to the most\nO-rich component of the previously found metal-rich RGB population.

Using high-resolution\nobservations of plage magnetic fields made with the Solar Optical Telescope\naboard the Hinode satellite, we investigate this idea by estimating the upward\ntransport of magnetic energy --- the vertical Poynting flux, S_z --- across the\nphotosphere in a plage region.

Abstract: Recent analysis of the interstellar helium fluxes measured in 2009-2010 at\nEarth orbit by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) has suggested that the\ninterstellar velocity (both direction and magnitude) is inconsistent with that\nderived previously from Ulysses/GAS observations made in the period from 1990\nto 2002 at 1.5-5.5 AU from the Sun. Both results are model-dependent and models\nthat were used in the analyses are different. In this paper, we perform an\nanalysis of the Uysses/GAS and IBEX-Lo data using our state-of-the-art 3D\ntime-dependent kinetic model of interstellar atoms in the heliosphere. For the\nfirst time we analyze Ulysses/GAS data from year 2007, the closest available\nUlysses/GAS observations in time to the IBEX observations.\n  We show that the interstellar velocity derived from the Ulysses 2007 data is\nconsistent with previous Ulysses results and does not agree with the velocity\nderived from IBEX. This conclusion is very robust since, as is shown in the\npaper, it does not depend on the ionization rates adopted in theoretical\nmodels.\n  We conclude that Ulysses data are not consistent with the new LISM velocity\nvector from IBEX. In contrast, IBEX data, in principle, could be explained with\nthe LISM velocity vector derived from the Ulysses data. This is possible for\nthe models with the interstellar temperature increased from 6300 K to 9000 K.\nThere is a need to perform further study of possible reasons for the broadening\nof the helium signal core measured by IBEX. This could be an instrumental\neffect or due to unconsidered physical processes. \n\n"}

The differential analysis shows that this star is\nchemically very similar to the Sun. The refractory elements seem even slightly\nmore depleted than in the Sun, meaning that HIP 114328 may be as likely to form\nterrestrial planets as the Sun. HIP 114328 is about 2 Gyr older than the Sun,\nand is thus the second oldest solar twin analyzed at high precision.

If\ndark matter populates the interior of stars, and this matter is supersymmetric\nor of some other type, some of it possessing a tiny electric charge, there is\nthe possibility that highly compact stars can trap a small but non-negligible\nelectric charge. In this case the radius to mass relation for such compact\nstars should get modifications. We use an analytical scheme to investigate the\nlimiting radius to mass relation and the maximum mass of relativistic stars\nmade of an incompressible fluid with a small electric charge. The investigation\nis carried out by using the hydrostatic equilibrium equation, i.e., the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, together with the other equations of\nstructure, with the further hypothesis that the charge distribution is\nproportional to the energy density. The approach relies on Volkoff and Misner's\nmethod to solve the TOV equation. For zero charge one gets the interior\nSchwarzschild limit, and supposing incompressible boson or fermion matter with\nconstituents with masses of the order of the neutron mass one gets that the\nmaximum mass is the Misner mass. For a small electric charge, our analytical\napproximating scheme valid in first order in the star's electric charge, shows\nthat the maximum mass increases relatively to the uncharged case, whereas the\nminimum possible radius decreases, an expected effect since the new field is\nrepulsive aiding the pressure to sustain the star against gravitational\ncollapse. \n\n"}

We use two different samples of FGK dwarfs to study the effect of\nthe stellar surface gravity on the precise spectroscopic determination of the\nother atmospheric parameters. Furthermore, we present a straightforward formula\nfor correcting the spectroscopic surface gravities derived by our method and\nwith our linelists. Our spectroscopic analysis is based on Kurucz models in\nLTE, performed with the MOOG code to derive the atmospheric parameters.

While models that neglect irradiation feedback undergo continuous,\nlong standing mass transfer episodes, models including these effect suffer a\nnumber cycles of mass transfer and detachment. During mass transfer the systems\nshould reveal themselves as low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), whereas when\ndetached they behave as a binary radio pulsars. We show that at these stages\nirradiated models are in a Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) state or in a quasi-RLOF\nstate. Quasi-RLOF stars have a radius slightly smaller than its Roche lobe.\nRemarkably, these conditions are attained for orbital period and donor mass\nvalues in the range corresponding to a family of binary radio pulsars known as\n\"redbacks\".

This effect allows\nthe observed IR light curves to be used as a constraint on the position/size\nand the amount of CS dust. The method was applied to observed near-infrared\n(NIR) SN Ia samples; meaningful upper limits on the CS dust mass were derived\neven under conservative assumptions.

We present numerical\nsimulations of a water-like fluid near its density maximum in a two dimensional\ndomain. We successfully model the damping of waves in the simulations using\nlinear theory, provided we do not take the weak damping limit typically used in\nthe literature. In order to isolate the physical mechanism exciting internal\nwaves, we use the novel spectral code Dedalus to run several simplified model\nsimulations of our more detailed simulation. We use data from the full\nsimulation as source terms in two simplified models of internal wave excitation\nby convection: bulk excitation by convective Reynolds stresses, and interface\nforcing via the mechanical oscillator effect. We find excellent agreement\nbetween the waves generated in the full simulation and the simplified\nsimulation implementing the bulk excitation mechanism. The interface forcing\nsimulations over excite high frequency waves because they assume the excitation\nis by the \"impulsive\" penetration of plumes, which spreads energy to high\nfrequencies. However, we find the real excitation is instead by the \"sweeping\"\nmotion of plumes parallel to the interface.

Many large stellar surveys have been and are still being carried\nout, providing huge amounts of data, for which stellar physical parameters will\nbe derived. Solar twins and analogues provide a means to test the calibration\nof these stellar catalogues because the Sun is the best-studied star and\nprovides precise fundamental parameters. Solar twins should be centred on the\nsolar values. Aims. This spectroscopic study of solar analogues selected from\nthe Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (GCS) at a resolution of 48,000 provides effective\ntemperatures and metallicities for these stars. We test whether our\nspectroscopic parameters, as well as the previous photometric calibrations, are\nproperly centred on the Sun. In addition, we search for more solar twins in our\nsample. Methods. The methods used in this work are based on literature methods\nfor solar twin searches and on methods we developed in previous work to\ndistinguish the metallicity-temperature degeneracies in the differential\ncomparison of spectra of solar analogues versus a reference solar reflection\nspectrum. Results. We derive spectroscopic parameters for 148 solar analogues\n(about 70 are new entries to the literature) and verify with a-posteriori\ndifferential tests that our values are well-centred on the solar values. We use\nour dataset to assess the two alternative calibrations of the GCS parameters;\nour methods favour the latest revision.

In radio galaxies, the\nmolecular gas appears to be heated by jet-driven shocks, but exactly how this\nmechanism works is still poorly understood. With Chandra, we observe X-ray\nemission from the jets within the host galaxy and along the 100 kpc radio jets.\nWe model the X-ray spectra of the nucleus, the inner jets, and the X-ray\nfeatures along the extended radio jets. Both the nucleus and the inner jets\nshow evidence of 10^7 K shock-heated gas. The kinetic power of the jets is more\nthan sufficient to heat the X-ray emitting gas within the host galaxy.

Yet the connection between\nhost star metallicity and the properties of small planets is only just\nbeginning to be investigated. It has recently been argued that the metallicity\ndistribution of stars with exoplanet candidates identified by Kepler provides\nevidence for three distinct clusters of exoplanets, distinguished by planet\nradius boundaries at 1.7 R_Earth and 3.9 R_Earth. This would suggest that there\nare three distinct planet formation pathways for super-Earths, mini-Neptunes,\nand giant planets. However, as I show through three independent analyses, there\nis actually no evidence for the proposed radius boundary at 1.7 R_Earth. On the\nother hand, a more rigorous calculation demonstrates that a single, continuous\nrelationship between planet radius and metallicity is a better fit to the data.\nThe planet radius and metallicity data therefore provides no evidence for\ndistinct categories of small planets. This suggests that the planet formation\nprocess in a typical protoplanetary disk produces a continuum of planet sizes\nbetween 1 R_Earth and 4 R_Earth. As a result, the currently available planet\nradius and metallicity data for solar-metallicity F and G stars give no reason\nto expect that the amount of solid material in a protoplanetary disk determines\nwhether super-Earths or mini-Neptunes are formed. \n\n"}

This sample doubles the\nnumber of dSph stars with measurements of [C/Fe]. The [C/Fe] ratio in the\nclusters decreases with increasing luminosity above log(L/L_sun) ~= 1.6, which\ncan be explained by deep mixing in evolved giants. The same decrease is\nobserved in dSphs, but the initial [C/Fe] of the dSph giants is not uniform.\nStars in dSphs at lower metallicities have larger [C/Fe] ratios. We hypothesize\nthat [C/Fe] (corrected to the initial carbon abundance) declines with\nincreasing [Fe/H] due to the metallicity dependence of the carbon yield of\nasymptotic giant branch stars and due to the increasing importance of Type Ia\nsupernovae at higher metallicities.

LSQ13cuw was discovered\nwithin a day of explosion, hitherto unprecedented for Type II-L supernovae.\nThis motivated a comparative study of Type II-P and II-L supernovae with\nrelatively well-constrained explosion epochs and rise times to maximum\n(optical) light. From our sample of twenty such events, we find evidence of a\npositive correlation between the duration of the rise and the peak brightness.\nOn average, SNe II-L tend to have brighter peak magnitudes and longer rise\ntimes than SNe II-P. However, this difference is clearest only at the extreme\nends of the rise time versus peak brightness relation.

We aim to\ncharacterize the impact of possible accretion variations in a sample of\nembedded protostars by measuring the size of the inner regions of their\nenvelopes where CO is sublimated and relate those to their temperature profiles\ndictated by their current luminosities.

We compare these\nmeasurements to the predicted extent of the emission given the current\nluminosities of the sources through dust and line radiative transfer\ncalculations. Eight out of sixteen sources show more extended C18O emission\nthan predicted by the models.

In the present study we analyse the 35-Myr old visual\ntriple system TYC 9300-0891-1AB + TYC 9300-0529-1 in the young Octans stellar\nassociation consisting of three equal-mass K0V components. We collected from\nthe literature all information that allowed us to infer that the three\ncomponents are actually physically bound forming a triple system and are\nmembers of the Octans Association. We collected broad-band photometric\ntimeseries in two observation seasons. We discovered that all the components\nare variable, magnetically active, and from periodogram analysis we found the\nunresolved components TYC 9300-0891-1AB to have a rotation period P = 1.383d\nand TYC 9300-0529-1 a rotation period P = 1.634d. TYC 9300-0891-1A, TYC\n9300-0891-1B, and TYC 9300-0529-1 have same masses, ages, and initial chemical\ncompositions. The relatively small 16% rotation period difference measured by\nus indicates that all components had similar initial rotation periods and disc\nlifetimes, and the separation of 157AU between the component A and the\n'perturber' component B (or vice-versa) has been sufficiently large to prevent\nany significant perturbation/shortening of the accretion-disc lifetime. \n\n"}

We revisit the question of IR excesses around RGs using higher\nspatial resolution IR data, primarily from WISE. Our goal was to elucidate the\nlink between three unusual RG properties: fast rotation, enriched Li, and IR\nexcess. We have 316 targets thought to be K giants, about 40% of which we take\nto be Li-rich. In 24 cases with previous detections of IR excess at low spatial\nresolution, we believe that source confusion is playing a role, in that either\n(a) the source that is bright in the optical is not responsible for the IR\nflux, or (b) there is more than one source responsible for the IR flux as\nmeasured in IRAS. We looked for IR excesses in the remaining sources,\nidentifying 28 that have significant IR excesses by ~20 um (with possible\nexcesses for 2 additional sources). There appears to be an intriguing\ncorrelation in that the largest IR excesses are all in Li-rich K giants, though\nvery few Li-rich K giants have IR excesses (large or small). These largest IR\nexcesses also tend to be found in the fastest rotators. There is no correlation\nof IR excess with the carbon isotopic ratio, 12C/13C. IR excesses by 20 um,\nthough relatively rare, are at least twice as common among our sample of\nLi-rich K giants. If dust shell production is a common by-product of Li\nenrichment mechanisms, these observations suggest that the IR excess stage is\nvery short-lived, which is supported by theoretical calculations. Conversely,\nthe Li-enrichment mechanism may only occasionally produce dust, and an\nadditional parameter (e.g., rotation) may control whether or not a shell is\nejected. \n\n"}

The s-process pollution must therefore originate from\nmass transfer from a companion formerly on the AGB, now a carbon-oxygen white\ndwarf (WD). If the 384 d velocity variations are attributed to the WD\ncompanion, its orbit must be seen almost face-on, with $i \\sim 2.3^\\circ$,\nbecause the mass function is very small: $f(M_1,M_2) =\n(6.1\\pm1.1)\\times10^{-6}$ Msun. Alternatively, the WD orbital motion could be\nresponsible for the long-term velocity variations, with a period of several\ndecades. The 384 d variations should then be attributed either to a low-mass\ninner companion (perhaps a brown dwarf, depending on the orbital inclination),\nor to stellar pulsations. The latter possibility is made likely by the fact\nthat similar low-amplitude velocity variations, with periods close to 1 yr,\nhave been reported for other CEMP stars in a companion paper (Jorissen et al.,\n2015). A definite conclusion about the origin of the 384 d velocity variations\nshould however await the detection of synchronous low-amplitude photometric\nvariations. \n\n"}

Without reference to any\nspecific model of stellar photospheres, a model for a homogeneous cluster is\nthat it forms a one-dimensional sequence, with any differences between members\ndue to variations in stellar mass and observational uncertainties. I present a\nnovel method for investigating the abundance spread in open clusters that tests\nthis one-dimensional hypothesis at the level of observed stellar spectra,\nrather than constraining homogeneity using derived abundances as traditionally\ndone.

In this paper, we study a sample of giant transiting exoplanets\ndetected by the Kepler telescope with orbital periods up to 400 days. We first\ndefined a sample of 129 giant-planet candidates that we followed up with the\nSOPHIE spectrograph (OHP, France) in a 6-year radial velocity campaign.

The overall occurrence rate of giant planets within 400 days\nis 4.6 +/- 0.6 %. We recover, for the first time in the Kepler data, the\ndifferent populations of giant planets reported by radial velocity surveys.\nComparing these rates with other yields, we find that the occurrence rate of\ngiant planets is lower only for hot jupiters but not for the longer period\nplanets.

We here re-analyze an\nintriguing gedanken experiment which was designed by Bekenstein to challenge\nthe GSL. In this historical gedanken experiment an entropy-bearing box is\nlowered into a charged Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole. For the GSL to work,\nthe resulting increase in the black-hole surface area (entropy) must compensate\nfor the loss of the box's entropy. We show that if the box can be lowered\nadiabatically all the way down to the black-hole horizon, as previously assumed\nin the literature, then for near-extremal black holes the resulting increase in\nblack-hole surface-area (due to the assimilation of the box by the black hole)\nmay become too small to compensate for the loss of the box's entropy. In order\nto resolve this apparent violation of the GSL, we here suggest to use a\ngeneralized version of the hoop conjecture. In particular, assuming that a\nphysical system of mass $M$ and electric charge $Q$ forms a black hole if its\ncircumference radius $r_{\\text{c}}$ is equal to (or smaller than) the\ncorresponding Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black-hole radius\n$r_{\\text{RN}}=M+\\sqrt{M^2-Q^2}$, we prove that a new (and larger) horizon is\nalready formed before the entropy-bearing box reaches the horizon of the\noriginal near-extremal black hole.

Candidate carriers\ninclude water ice, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), silicon carbide,\ncrystalline silicates or even carbonates. All are known constituents of cosmic\ndust in one or more types of environments, though not necessarily together. In\nthis paper we present new ground-based 8-13 micron spectra of one evolved star,\nseveral embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) and a background source lying\nbehind a large column of the interstellar medium (ISM) toward the Galactic\nCentre. Our observations, obtained at a spectral resolution of approximately\n100, are compared with previous lower resolution data, as well as data obtained\nwith the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) on these and other targets.

Furthermore, the apparent\nassociation of the absorption feature with a sharp polarisation signature in\nthe spectrum of two previously reported cases suggests a carrier with a\nrelatively high band strength compared to amorphous silicates.

Using this large and homogeneous\ncatalog of UV and blue photometry, we demonstrate that the HB exhibits\ndiscontinuities that are remarkably consistent in color (effective\ntemperature). This consistency is apparent even among some of the most massive\nclusters hosting multiple distinct sub-populations (such as NGC 2808, omega\nCen, and NGC 6715), demonstrating that these phenomena are primarily driven by\natmospheric physics that is independent of the underlying population\nproperties.

However, breaking Lorentz invariance can cure such abominable behavior.\nBy analyzing a model that describes a massive graviton together with a\nremaining Boulware-Deser ghost mode we show that even ghostly theories of\nmodified gravity can yield models that are viable at both classical and quantum\nlevels and, therefore, they should not generally be ruled out.

However,\nthe validity of the scaling relations depends on the homology between the star\nunder study and the reference star.

We find that normal isolated\nspiral galaxies and merging galaxies have different slopes (alpha) in the log\nL'CO(3-2) - log LFIR plane (alpha ~ 0.79 for spirals and ~ 1.12 for mergers).\nThe large slope (alpha > 1) for merging galaxies can be interpreted as an\nevidence for increasing Star Formation Efficiency (SFE=LFIR/L'CO(3-2)) as a\nfunction of LFIR. Comparing our results with sub-kpc scale local star formation\nand global star-burst activity in the high-z Universe, we find deviations from\nthe linear relationship in the log L'CO(3-2) - log LFIR plane for the late\nstage mergers and high-z star forming galaxies.

By\ncomparing our findings with the results from numerical simulations, we suggest;\n(1) inefficient star-bursts triggered by disk-wide dense clumps occur in the\nearly stage of interaction and (2) efficient star-bursts triggered by central\nconcentration of gas occur in the final stage.

Employing hydrodynamic\nsimulations in full general relativity, we find that the one-arm instability is\ngeneric in that it can develop in HMNSs within a few tens of milliseconds after\nmerger for all equations of state in our survey. We find that mergers with\nstiffer equations of state tend to produce HMNSs with stronger $m=2$ azimuthal\nmode density deformations, and weaker $m=1$ components, relative to softer\nequations of state. We also find that for equations of state that can give rise\nto double-core HMNSs, large $m=1$ density modes can already be present due to\nasymmetries in the two cores. This results in the generation of $l=2$, $m=1$\ngravitational wave modes even before the dominance of a one-arm mode that\nultimately arises following merger of the two cores.

We find that disk winds are the dominant feedback mechanism setting star\nformation efficiencies (SFEs) from initial cores of ~0.3-0.5. However,\nradiation pressure is also significant to widen the outflow cavity causing\nreductions of SFE compared to the disk-wind only case, especially for >100Msun\nstar formation at clump mass surface densities Sigma<0.3g/cm2. Photoevaporation\nis of relatively minor importance due to dust attenuation of ionizing photons.\nStellar winds have even smaller effects during the accretion stage. For core\nmasses Mc~10-1000Msun and Sigma~0.1-3g/cm2, we find the overall SFE to be\n0.31(Rc/0.1pc)^{-0.39}, potentially a useful sub-grid star-formation model in\nsimulations that can resolve pre-stellar core radii,\nRc=0.057(Mc/60Msun)^{1/2}(Sigma/g/cm2)^{-1/2}pc. The decline of SFE with Mc is\ngradual with no evidence for a maximum stellar-mass set by feedback processes\nup to stellar masses of ~300Msun.

Very low-mass (VLM) stars and brown dwarfs (BDs) present a different\nrotational behaviour from their solar mass counter-parts. Aims. We investigate\nthe rotational evolution of young VLM stars and BDs using Monte Carlo\nsimulations under the hypothesis of disk locking and stellar angular momentum\nconservation. Methods. We built a set of objects with masses ranging from 0.01\nMo to 0.4 Mo and considered models with single- and double- peaked initial\nperiod distributions with and without disk locking. An object is considered to\nbe diskless when its mass accretion rate is below a given threshold. Results.\nModels with initial single-peaked period distributions reproduce the\nobservations well given that BDs rotate faster than VLM stars. We observe a\ncorrelation between rotational period and mass when we relax the disk locking\nhypothesis, but with a shallower slope compared to some observational results.\nThe angular momentum evolution of diskless stars is flatter than it is for\nstars with a disk which occurs because the moment of inertia of objects less\nmassive than 0.2 Mo remains pratically constant for a time scale that increases\nwith decreasing stellar mass. Conclusions. Comparing our results with the\navailable observational data we see that disk locking is not as important in\nthe low-mass regime and that the rotational behaviour of VLM stars and BDs is\ndifferent from what is seen in their solar mass counterparts. \n\n"}

We suggest that outbursts are indirectly triggered\nby stellar dynamo cycles, via poloidal magnetic flux that diffuses radially\noutward through the disk. Interior to the dead zone the strength of the net\nfield modulates the efficiency of angular momentum transport by the\nmagnetorotational instability.

Normal A-type\nstars possess none of these and therefore should not flare.

A study of the pixel data and the surrounding field-of-view (FOV)\nreveals that 14 of these 27 flaring objects have overlapping neighbouring stars\nand 5 stars show clear contamination in the pixel data. We have obtained\nhigh-resolution spectra for 2/3 of the entire sample and confirm that our\ntargets are indeed A-type stars.

Indeed, at such a metallicity,\neven an initially very massive star generally loses so much mass by stellar\nwinds that it will avoid the electron-positron pair-creation instability. We\nuse recent results showing that a magnetic field at the surface of a massive\nstar can significantly reduce its effective mass-loss rate to compute magnetic\nmodels of very massive stars (VMSs) at solar metallicity and explore the\npossibility that such stars end as PISNe. We implement the quenching of the\nmass loss produced by a surface dipolar magnetic field into the Geneva stellar\nevolution code and compute new stellar models with an initial mass of\n$200\\,M_\\odot$ at solar metallicity, with and without rotation. It considerably\nreduces the total amount of mass lost by the star during its life. For the\nnon-rotating model, the total (CO-core) mass of the models is $72.8\\,M_\\odot$\n($70.1\\,M_\\odot$) at the onset of the electron-positron pair-creation\ninstability.

The\ncurrent explanation for the source of this variation is that inflows into\nactive regions alter the global surface pattern of the meridional circulation.\nWhen these localized inflows are integrated over a full hemisphere, they\ncontribute to the slow down of the axisymmetric poleward horizontal component.\nThe behavior of this large scale flow deep inside the convection zone remains\nlargely unknown. Present helioseismic techniques are not sensitive enough to\ncapture the dynamics of this weak large scale flow. Moreover, the large time of\nintegration needed to map the meridional circulation inside the convection\nzone, also masks some of the possible dynamics on shorter timescales. In this\nwork we examine the dynamics of the meridional circulation that emerges from a\n3D MHD global simulation of the solar convection zone. Our aim is to assess and\nquantify the behavior of meridional circulation deep inside the convection\nzone, where the cyclic large-scale magnetic field can reach considerable\nstrength. Our analyses indicate that the meridional circulation morphology and\namplitude are both highly influenced by the magnetic field, via the impact of\nmagnetic torques on the global angular momentum distribution. A dynamic feature\ninduced by these magnetic torques is the development of a prominent upward flow\nat mid latitudes in the lower convection zone that occurs near the equatorward\nedge of the toroidal bands and that peaks during cycle maximum.

For order unity binary mass ratios, KL\ninstability is possible for a window of disc aspect ratios H/r in the outer\nparts of a disc that roughly scale as (n_b/n)^2 < H/r < n_b/n, for binary\norbital frequency n_b and orbital frequency n at the disc outer edge. We\npresent a framework for understanding the zones of instability based on the\ndetermination of branches of marginally unstable modes. In general, multiple\ngrowing eccentric KL modes can be present in a disc. Coplanar apsidal-nodal\nprecession resonances delineate instability branches. We determine the range of\ntilt angles for unstable modes as a function of disc aspect ratio. Unlike the\nKL instability for free particles that involves a critical (minimum) tilt\nangle, disc instability is possible for any nonzero tilt angle depending on the\ndisc aspect ratio. \n\n"}

Such\nmodels predict time lags between energy bands due to propagation delays. First\napplication of a propagating fluctuations model to black hole power spectra\nshowed good agreement with the data. Indeed, hard lags observed from these\nsystems appear to be in agreement with this generic prediction. Our PROPFLUC\ncode allows to simultaneously predict power spectra, time lags, and coherence\nof the variability as a function of energy. This was successfully applied to\nSwift data on the black hole MAXIJ1659-152, fitting jointly the power spectra\nin two energy bands and the cross-spectrum between these two bands.

We provide an analytical estimate\nfor the mass leakage rate through L2 and find the conditions in which it is\ncomparable to the mass transfer rate through L1. Focusing on a binary system of\na main-sequence star and a super-massive black hole, driven by the emission of\ngravitational radiation, we show that it may sustain stable mass transfer,\nalong with mass loss through L2. If such a mass-transferring system occurs at\nour Galactic Centre, it produces a gravitational wave signal detectable by\nfuture detectors, such as eLISA. The signal evolves according to the star's\nadiabatic index and cooling time. For low mass stars, the evolution is faster\nthan the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling rate driving the star out of the\nmain-sequence.

Estimating occurrence frequencies and\n  mass-loss rates Abstract: Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may play an important role in mass- and\nangular momentum loss of young Sun-like stars. If occurring frequently, they\nmay also have a strong effect on planetary evolution by increasing atmospheric\nerosion. So far it has not been possible to infer the occurrence frequency of\nstellar CMEs from observations. Based on their close relation with flares on\nthe Sun, we develop an empirical model combining solar flare-CME relationships\nwith stellar flare rates to estimate the CME activity of young Sun-like and\nlate-type main-sequence stars. By comparison of the obtained CME mass-loss\nrates with observations of total mass-loss rates, we find that our modeled\nrates may exceed those from observations by orders of magnitude for the most\nactive stars. This reveals a possible limit to the extrapolation of such models\nto the youngest stars. We find that the most uncertain component in the model\nis the flare-CME association rate adopted from the Sun, which does not properly\naccount for the likely stronger coronal confinement in active stars. Simple\nestimates of this effect reveal a possible suppression of CME rates by several\norders of magnitude for young stars, indicating that this issue should be\naddressed in more detail in the future. \n\n"}

The nature of eMSTOs remains debated in the literature. The\ncurrently most popular scenarios are extended star formation activity and\nranges of stellar rotation rates.

In 2D, only the nonrotating\nand slowly rotating models explode, while rapid rotation prevents an explosion\nwithin 500 ms after bounce because of lower radiated neutrino luminosities and\nmean energies and thus reduced neutrino heating. In contrast, only the fast\nrotating model develops an explosion in 3D when the Si/Si-O interface collapses\nthrough the shock.

Previous work has shown that II-P and\nII-L supernovae (SNe) have Red Supergiant (RSG) progenitors, and that the range\nof initial masses for these progenitors seems to be limited to $<$17M$_\\odot$.\nThis is in contrast with the cutoff of 25-30M$_\\odot$ predicted by evolutionary\nmodels, a result which is termed the 'Red Supergiant Problem'.

We show, using star clusters, that RSGs evolve to later spectral\ntypes as they approach SN, which in turn causes the BC to become larger.\nFailure to account for this results in a systematic underestimate of a star's\nluminosity, and hence its initial mass. Using our empirically motivated BCs we\nreappraise the II-P and II-L SNe that have their progenitors detected in\npre-explosion imaging.

Instead, they quickly get absorbed and re-emitted by at thermal\nwavelengths. As the cloud is typically optically thin to far-IR radiation, it\npromptly escapes, depositing little momentum. The resulting spectrum is more\nnarrowly peaked than the corresponding Planck function with an extended tail at\nlonger wavelengths.

We have\nmapped SDC13, a 1000Msun infrared dark hub, in NH3(1,1) and NH3(2,2) emission\nlines, with both the JVLA and GBT down to 0.07pc. The mass-per-unit-lengths of\nall four hub filaments are thermally super-critical, consistent with the\npresence of tens of gravitationally bound cores along them. These cores exhibit\nregular separation of 0.37 +/- 0.16 pc suggesting gravitational instabilities\nrunning along these super-critical filaments are responsible for their\nfragmentation. The observed local increase of the dense gas velocity dispersion\ntowards starless cores is believed to be a consequence of such fragmentation\nprocess. We see velocity gradient peaks towards 63% of the cores as expected\nduring the early stages of filament fragmentation. The most massive cores are\nlocated at the filament junctions, where the velocity dispersion is the\nlargest.

The goal is to ultimately confirm (or deny) the classical\n\"ion-neutral reactions\" scenario that predicts a similar trend for D and\n$^{15}$N fractionation. We do not find any evolutionary trend of the\n$^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio from both the $^{15}$NNH$^+$ and N$^{15}$NH$^+$\nisotopologues. Therefore, our findings confirm that, during the formation of a\nSun-like star, the core evolution is irrelevant in the fractionation of\n$^{15}$N. The independence of the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio with time, found also\nin high-mass star-forming cores, indicates that the enrichment in $^{15}$N\nrevealed in comets and protoplanetary disks is unlikely to happen at core\nscales. Nevertheless, we have firmly confirmed the evolutionary trend expected\nfor the H/D ratio, with the N$_2$H$^+$/N$_2$D$^+$ ratio decreasing before the\npre-stellar core phase, and increasing monotonically during the protostellar\nphase.

Many of them show surface activity\nqualitatively similar to our Sun and generate flares, high X-ray fluxes, and\nlarge-scale magnetic fields. Such activity is driven by a dynamo powered by the\nconvective motions in their interiors. Understanding properties of stellar\nmagnetic fields in these stars finds a broad application in astrophysics,\nincluding, e.g., theory of stellar dynamos and environment conditions around\nplanets that may be orbiting these stars. Most stars with convective envelopes\nfollow a rotation-activity relationship where various activity indicators\nsaturate in stars with rotation periods shorter than a few days. The activity\ngradually declines with rotation rate in stars rotating more slowly. It is\nthought that due to a tight empirical correlation between X-ray and magnetic\nflux, the stellar magnetic fields will also saturate, to values around ~4kG.\nHere we report the detection of magnetic fields above the presumed saturation\nlimit in four fully convective M-dwarfs. By combining results from\nspectroscopic and polarimetric studies we explain our findings in terms of\nbistable dynamo models: stars with the strongest magnetic fields are those in a\ndipole dynamo state, while stars in a multipole state cannot generate fields\nstronger than about four kilogauss.

The\nsecondary dimming regions also show a distinct decrease in density, but less\nstrong, decreasing by 10-45%. In both the core and the secondary dimming the\ndensity changes are much larger than the temperature changes, confirming that\nthe dimming regions are mainly caused by plasma evacuation. In the core\ndimming, the plasma density reduces rapidly within the first 20-30 min after\nthe flare start, and does not recover for at least 10 hrs later, whereas the\nsecondary dimming tends to be more gradual and starts to replenish after 1-2\nhrs.

We\nexamine this issue using 1D stellar models constructed using Modules for\nExperiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). First, we consider standard models\nthat do not explicitly include rotational/magnetic effects, with convective\ninhibition modeled by decreasing a depth-independent mixing length theory (MLT)\nparameter $\\alpha_{\\text{MLT}}$ (following Cox et al. 1981; Chabrier et al.\n2007). We provide formulae linking changes in $\\alpha_{\\text{MLT}}$ to changes\nin the interior specific entropy, and hence to the stellar radius. Next, we\nmodify the MLT formulation in MESA to mimic explicitly the influence of\nrotation and magnetism, using formulations suggested by Stevenson (1979) and\nMacDonald & Mullan (2014) respectively. We find rapid rotation in these models\nhas a negligible impact on stellar structure, primarily because a star's\nadiabat, and hence its radius, is predominantly affected by layers near the\nsurface; convection is rapid and largely uninfluenced by rotation there.\nMagnetic fields, if they influenced convective transport in the manner\ndescribed by MacDonald & Mullan (2014), could lead to more noticeable radius\ninflation. Finally, we show that these non-standard effects on stellar\nstructure can be fabricated using a depth-dependent $\\alpha_{\\text{MLT}}$: a\nnon-magnetic, non-rotating model can be produced that is virtually\nindistinguishable from one that explicitly parameterizes rotation and/or\nmagnetism using the two formulations above. We provide formulae linking the\nradially-variable $\\alpha_{\\text{MLT}}$ to these putative MLT reformulations. \n\n"}

The continuum\nbrightness temperature, the intensity profile, and the polarization properties\nclearly indicate that the disk is optically thick for a radius of R<170 au. The\nlinear polarization of the dust emission is detected almost all along the disk\nand its properties suggest that dust polarization is produced mainly by\nself-scattering.

One of the observable\ntests for migration theories is the current value of the angle between the\nstellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane, called the obliquity. After the\nmain migration mechanism has ended, the obliquity and the semi-major axis keep\non evolving due to the combined effects of tides and magnetic braking. The\nobserved correlation between effective temperature and measured projected\nobliquity in known short-period systems has been taken as evidence of such\nmechanisms being at play. Our aim is to produce an improved model for the tidal\nevolution of the obliquity, including all the components of the dynamical tide\nfor circular misaligned systems. This model takes into account the strong\nvariations in structure and rotation of stars during their evolution, and their\nconsequences for the efficiency of tidal dissipation. We use an analytical\nformulation for the frequency-averaged dissipation in convective layers for\neach mode, depending only on global stellar parameters and rotation. For\ntypical hot-Jupiters orbital configurations, the obliquity is generally damped\non a much shorter timescale than the semi-major axis. The final outcome of\ntidal evolution is also very sensitive to the initial conditions, with\nJupiter-mass planets being either quickly destroyed or brought on more distant\norbit, depending on the initial ratio of planetary orbital momentum to stellar\nspin momentum. However we find that everything else being the same, the\nevolution of the obliquity around low-mass stars with a thin convective zone is\nnot slower than around those with a thicker convective zone. On the contrary,\nwe find that more massive stars, remaining faster rotator throughout their\nmain-sequence, produce more efficient dissipation. \n\n"}

One possible explanation is a mode in the bursting ocean,\nthe frequency of which would decrease (in the rotating frame) as the burst\ncools, hence explaining the drifts.

This is\nthe main question addressed in the present analysis. We also discuss the\nvalidity of Derrick's theorem when scalar fields are embedded in non-trivial\ngravitational backgrounds. In the context of the above question, we consider\nthree global defect configurations: a finite thickness spherical domain wall\nwith a central S-dS black hole, a global string loop with a S-dS black hole in\nthe center and a global monopole near a S-dS black hole. Using an analytical\nmodel and numerical simulations of the evolving spherical wall we show that the\nspherical wall experiences a repelling gravitational potential due to the mass\nof the central black hole. This potential is further amplified by the presence\nof a cosmological constant. For initial domain wall radius larger than a\ncritical value, the repulsive potential dominates over the wall tension and the\nwall expands towards the cosmological horizon of the S-dS metric where it\ndevelops ghost instabilities. For smaller initial radius, tension dominates and\nthe wall contracts towards the black hole horizon where it also develops ghost\ninstabilities. We also show, using the same analytical model and energetic\narguments that a global monopole is gravitationally attracted by a black hole\nwhile a cosmological constant induces a repulsive gravitational potential as in\nthe case of test particles. Finally we show that a global string loop with\nfinite thickness experiences gravitational repulsion due to the cosmological\nconstant which dominates over its tension for a radius larger than a critical\nradius leading to an expanding rather than contracting loop. \n\n"}

Application to HD 207129 and HD 95456 Abstract: Convective motions in solar-type stellar atmospheres induce Doppler shifts\nthat affect the strengths and shapes of spectral absorption lines and create\nslightly asymmetric line profiles. 1D LTE studies of elemental abundances are\nnot able to reproduce this phenomenon, which becomes particularly important\nwhen modeling the impact of isotopic fine structure, like the subtle depression\ncreated by the 6Li isotope on the red wing of the Li I resonance doublet line.\nThe purpose of this work is to provide corrections for the lithium abundance,\nA(Li), and the 6Li/7Li ratio that can easily be applied to correct 1D LTE\nlithium abundances in G and F dwarf stars of approximately solar mass and\nmetallicity for 3D and non-LTE (NLTE) effects. The corrections for A(Li) and\n6Li/7Li are computed using grids of 3D NLTE and 1D LTE synthetic lithium line\nprofiles, generated from 3D hydro-dynamical CO5BOLD and 1D hydrostatic model\natmospheres, respectively. The 3D NLTE corrections are then approximated by\nanalytical expressions as a function of the stellar parameters. These are\napplied to adjust the 1D LTE isotopic lithium abundances in two solar-type\nstars, HD 207129 and HD 95456. The derived 3D NLTE corrections range between\n-0.01 and +0.11 dex for A(Li), and between -4.9 and -0.4% for the 6Li/7Li\nratio, depending on the adopted stellar parameters. In the case of the 6Li/7Li\nratio, our corrections are always negative, showing that 1D LTE analysis can\nsignificantly overestimate (up to 4.9 percentage points) the presence of 6Li in\nthe atmospheres of solar-like dwarf stars. These results emphasize the\nimportance of reliable 3D model atmospheres combined with NLTE line formation\nfor deriving precise isotopic lithium abundances.

In this work, we re-examine the sample from Sander\net al. (2012) to derive key properties of the Galactic WC population. All\nquantities depending on the distance are updated, while the underlying spectral\nanalyses remain untouched. Contrasting earlier assumptions, our study yields\nthat WC stars of the same subtype can significantly vary in absolute magnitude.\nWith Gaia DR2, the picture of the Galactic WC population becomes more complex:\nWe obtain luminosities ranging from log L = 4.9 to 6.0 with one outlier having\nlog L = 4.7.

We investigate how far this supports an optically thick bowl-shaped BLR\nand dust torus geometry as proposed by Kawaguchi & Mori (2010) and Goad et al.\n(2012). The comparison with several parameterizations of these models supports\nthe following geometry: the BLR clouds lie inside the bowl closely above the\nbowl rim, up to a half covering angle 0 deg < theta < 40 deg (measured against\nthe equatorial plane). Then the BLR is spread over many isodelay surfaces,\nyielding a smeared and structured echo as observed.

Aims. In the present paper we discuss these assumptions\nand applied a time delay in the source term of the azimuthally averaged\ninduction equation. This delay is set to be the rise time of magnetic flux\ntubes which supposedly form at the tachocline. We study the effect of the\ndelay, which adds to the spacial non-locality a non-linear temporal one, in the\nadvective but particularly in the diffusive regime. Methods. Fournier et al.\n(2017) obtained the rise time according to stellar parameters such as rotation,\nand the magnetic field strength at the bottom of the convection zone.

This color is\ndifferent than the neutral or ultra-red colors found for the ten largest TNOs,\nmaking 2013 FY27 one of the largest known moderately red TNOs, which only start\nto be seen, and in abundance, at diameters less than 800 km. This suggests\nsomething physically different might be associated with TNOs larger than 800\nkm. It could be that moderately red surfaces are older or less ice rich and\nTNOs larger than 800 km have fresher surfaces or are able to hold onto more\nvolatile ices. Its also possible TNOs larger than 800 km are more fully\ndifferentiated, giving them different surface compositions.

Achieving competitive constraints on these parameters\nrequires high signal-to-noise extraction of the projected gravitational\npotential from the CMB maps. Standard methods for reconstructing the lensing\npotential employ the quadratic estimator (QE). However, the QE performs\nsuboptimally at the low noise levels expected in upcoming experiments. Other\nmethods, like maximum likelihood estimators (MLE), are under active\ndevelopment. In this work, we demonstrate reconstruction of the CMB lensing\npotential with deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) - ie, a ResUNet.

Understanding the different interactions they are subject\nto, and how they are influenced by them, is therefore an important step towards\nexplaining the global picture of galaxy evolution. In this paper, we use the\npublicly-available high resolution hydrodynamical simulation Illustris-1 to\nstudy satellite galaxies in the three most massive host haloes (with masses\n$M_{200} > 10^{14}\\,h^{-1}\\rm{M}_{\\odot}$) at $z=0$. We measure the\nStellar-to-Halo Mass Relation (hereafter SHMR) of the galaxies, and find that\nfor satellites it is shifted towards lower halo masses compared to the SHMR of\ncentral galaxies. We provide simple fitting functions for both the central and\nsatellite SHMR. To explain the shift between the two, we follow the satellite\ngalaxies since their time of accretion into the clusters, and quantify the\nimpact of dark matter stripping and star formation.

In\nPaper I, Cally & Khomenko (2015) have shown that in a weakly ionized plasma,\nsuch as the solar photosphere and chromosphere, the Hall current introduces a\nnew coupling mechanism. The present study extends the results from Paper I to\nthe case of warm plasma. We report on numerical experiments where mode\ntransformation is studied using quasi-realistic stratification in thermodynamic\nparameters resembling the solar atmosphere. This redresses the limitation of\nthe cold plasma approximation assumed in Paper I, in particular allowing the\ncomplete process of coupling between fast and slow magneto-acoustic modes and\nsubsequent coupling of the fast mode to the Alfv\\'en mode through the Hall\ncurrent.

This type of\nheating arises when the amplitude of the gyroscale fluctuations exceeds a\ncertain threshold, causing particle orbits in the plane perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field to become stochastic rather than nearly periodic.

Abstract: (Abridged) This paper studies chaotic orbit ensembles evolved in triaxial\ngeneralisations of the Dehnen potential which have been proposed to model\nellipticals with a strong density cusp that manifest significant deviations\nfrom axisymmetry. Allowance is made for a possible supermassive black hole, as\nwell as low amplitude friction, noise, and periodic driving which can mimic\nirregularities associated with discreteness effects and/or an external\nenvironment. The degree of chaos is quantified by determining how (1) the\nrelative number of chaotic orbits and (2) the size of the largest Lyapunov\nexponent depend on the steepness of the cusp and the black hole mass, and (3)\nthe extent to which Arnold webs significantly impede phase space transport,\nboth with and without perturbations.

This large scale field is nearly force-free and exceeds the\nequipartition value. As the magnetic Reynolds number R_m increases, the\nsaturation field strength and the growth rate of the dynamo increase. However,\nthe time it takes to built up the large scale field from equipartition to its\nfinal super-equipartition value increases with magnetic Reynolds number. The\nlarge scale field generation can be identified as being due to nonlocal\ninteractions originating from the forcing scale, which is characteristic of the\nalpha-effect. Both alpha and turbulent magnetic diffusivity eta_t are\ndetermined simultaneously using numerical experiments where the mean-field is\nmodified artificially.

Both solutions have been developed\nto account for the observed properties of the low luminosity, high temperature\nX-ray sources believed to involve accretion onto massive black holes.\nSelf-similar CDAFs also have steeper poloidal density gradients and\ntemperatures close to the virial temperature. All these characteristics make\nCDAFs more capable of producing polar outflows driven by Compton heating as\ncompared to other classical accretion disks. We investigate the conditions for\nproducing such outflows in CDAFs and look for the mass accretion rate, or,\nequally, the luminosity of CDAFs for which such outflows will exist. When the\nelectron temperature saturates around 10^11 K at the inner region, polar\noutflows are probable for 8x10^-7 <~ L/L_E <~ 4x10^-5, where L_E is the\nEddington luminosity. Outflows are well collimated with small opening angles.\nThe luminosity range for which outflow solutions exist is narrower for lower\nelectron temperature flows and disappears completely for electron temperature\n<~ 6x10^9 K. When the magnetic field is present, we find that outflows are\npossible if the magnetic field is less than from 10% to 1% of the equipartition\nfield. We also find that outflows are more likely to be produced when the\nviscosity parameter alpha is small. The tendency for jet-like collimated\noutflows for these solutions is presumably astrophysically relevant given the\nhigh frequency of jets from AGNs. \n\n"}

At super-Eddington accretion rates, an outflow forms within the\nspherization radius. We construct the accretion disc model accounting for the\nadvection and the outflow, and compute characteristic disc temperatures. The\nbolometric luminosity exceeds the Eddington luminosity L_Edd by a logarithmic\nfactor 1+0.6 ln mdot (where mdot is the accretion rate in Eddington units) and\nthe wind kinetic luminosity is close to L_Edd. The apparent luminosity for the\nface-on observer is 2-7 times higher because of geometrical beaming. Such an\nobserver has a direct view of the inner hot accretion disc, which has a peak\ntemperature T_max of a few keV in stellar-mass BHs. The emitted spectrum\nextends as a power-law F_E ~ E**{-1} down to the temperature at the\nspherization radius T_sp ~ mdot**(-1/2) keV. We associate T_max with a few keV\nspectral components and T_sp with the soft, 0.1-0.2 keV components observed in\nULXs.

Strong outflows combined with the large intrinsic\nX-ray luminosity of the central BH explain naturally the presence of the\nphotoionized nebulae around ULXs.

We perform our calculations both in\nthe time and frequency domain. In order to numerically solve the infinite\nsystem of coupled equations, we truncate it at some value $l_{\\rm max}$.\nAlthough the time dependent equations can be numerically evolved without any\nproblems, the eigenvalue equations possess a singular structure, which is\nrelated to the existence of a continuous spectrum.

The properties of the latter depend strongly on the cut-off value\n$l_{\\rm max}$ and it can consist of several either disconnected or overlapping\npatches, which are the broader the more relativistic the stellar model is. By\ndiscussing the dependence of the continuous spectrum as a function of both the\ncut-off value $l_{\\rm max}$ and the compactness $M/R$, we demonstrate how it\naffects the inertial modes.

We note that the Bianchi type VI_h case is of\nparticular interest in that it contains many different subcases which exhibit\nmany of the different possible future asymptotic behaviours of Bianchi\ncosmological models. \n\n"}

LIGO/VIRGO can do moderate SNR (a few tens), moderate\naccuracy studies of BBH coalescences in the mass range of a few to about 2000\nsolar masses; LISA can do high SNR (of order 10^4) high accuracy studies in the\nmass range of about 10^5 to 10^8 solar masses. BBHs might well be the first\nsources detected by LIGO/VIRGO: they are visible to much larger distances (up\nto 500 Mpc by initial interferometers) than coalescing neutron star binaries\n(heretofore regarded as the \"bread and butter\" workhorse source for LIGO/VIRGO,\nvisible to about 30 Mpc by initial interferometers). Low-mass BBHs (up to 50\nsolar masses for initial LIGO interferometers; 100 for advanced; 10^6 for LISA)\nare best searched for via their well-understood inspiral waves; higher mass\nBBHs must be searched for via their poorly understood merger waves and/or their\nwell-understood ringdown waves. A matched filtering search for massive BBHs\nbased on ringdown waves should be capable of finding BBHs in the mass range of\nabout 100 to 700 solar masses out to 200 Mpc (initial LIGO interferometers),\nand 200 to 3000 solar masses out to about z=1 (advanced interferometers). The\nrequired number of templates is of order 6000 or less.

The instantons leading to an\nopen universe can be considered as generalizations of the Coleman-De-Luccia\nsolution. They are non-singular, unlike the instantons recently studied by\nHawking and Turok, whose prescription has the problem that the singularity is\nlocated on the hypersurface connecting to the Lorentzian region, which makes it\ndifficult to remove. We argue that such singularities are harmless if they are\nlocated purely in the Euclidean region. We thus obtain new singular instantons\nleading to a closed universe; unlike the usual regular instantons used for this\npurpose, they do not require complex initial conditions. The singularity gives\na boundary contribution to the action which is small for the instantons leading\nto sufficient inflation, but changes the sign of the action for small $\\phi$\ncorresponding to short periods of inflation. \n\n"}

This paper studies the\nconsistency and convergence of our general relativistic hydrodynamic treatment\nand its coupling to the spacetime evolutions described by the full set of\nEinstein equations with a perfect fluid source. The numerical treatment of the\ngeneral relativistic hydrodynamic equations is based on high resolution shock\ncapturing schemes. These schemes rely on the characteristic information of the\nsystem. A spectral decomposition for general relativistic hydrodynamics\nsuitable for a general spacetime metric is presented. Evolutions based on three\ndifferent approximate Riemann solvers coupled to four different discretizations\nof the Einstein equations are studied and compared. The coupling between the\nhydrodynamics and the spacetime (the right and left hand side of the Einstein\nequations) is carried out in a treatment which is second order accurate in {\\it\nboth} space and time.
