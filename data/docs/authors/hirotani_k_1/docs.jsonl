Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

We find that the\nGini/M_20 method appears to find a larger number of galaxy mergers than the CAS\nsystem, but contains a larger contamination from non-mergers. We furthermore\ncalculate the merger rate of galaxies in the UDF up to z~3, finding an increase\nwith redshift as well as stellar mass, confirming previous work in the Hubble\nDeep Field. We find that massive galaxies with M_{*} > 10^10 M_0 undergo\n4.3_+0.8^-0.8 major galaxy mergers at z < 3, with all of this merging occurring\nat z > 1. \n\n"}

The three stages involves a neutron star phase, a quark star (QS)\nand a black hole phase as described in Staff et al. (2007). We find that the QS\nstage allows for more energy to be extracted from neutron star to QS conversion\nas well as from ensuing accretion onto the QS. The QS accretion phase naturally\nextends the engine activity and can account for both the prompt emission and\nirregular early X-ray afterglow activity. Following the accretion phase, the QS\ncan spin-down by emission of a baryon-free outflow. The magnetar-like magnetic\nfield strengths resulting from the NS to QS transition provide enough spin-down\nenergy, for the correct amount of time, to account for the plateau in the X-ray\nafterglow. In our model, a sharp drop-off following the plateau occurs when the\nQS collapses to a BH during the spin-down, thus shutting-off the secondary\noutflow.

At optical\nwavelengths, our results match a wide range of current observations and\ngenerate predictions for future data sets. We reproduce the weak luminosity\ndependence of clustering over the currently well-measured range, and predict a\nmuch stronger dependence at higher luminosities. The increase in the amplitude\nof binary quasar clustering observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is\nalso reproduced and is predicted to occur at higher redshift, an effect that is\ndue to the one halo term in the correlation function.

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems.

The\nhigh-brightness isotopic SiO maser emission imaged with a ~0.2 arcsec\nresolution has a more compact distribution, generally similar to that of the\n28SiO v=1,2 emission, and it probably traces bulk gas flows in a region of\ndiameter <100 AU centered on Source I.

This great\nachievement raises questions on the formation and dynamical stability of the HR\n8799 system, because Keplerian fits to astrometric data are strongly unstable\nduring ~0.2Myr. We search for stable, self-consistent N-body orbits with the so\ncalled GAMP method that incorporates stability constraints into the\noptimization algorithm. Our searches reveal only small regions of stable\nmotions in the phase space of three-planet, coplanar configurations. Most\nlikely, if the planetary masses are in 10-Jupiter-mass range, they may be\nstable only if the planets are involved in two- or three-body mean motion\nresonances (MMRs). We found that 80% systems found by GAMP that survived 30Myr\nbackwards integrations, eventually become unstable after 100Myr.

The goal is to present an analysis based on minimal sets of\nassumptions and extrapolations with respect to locally testable or measurable\nquantities. We discuss the differences between the spatial and spectral\nfeatures for the DM-induced components (with an extended, possibly spherical,\nsource function) and those for the standard CR contribution (with sources\nconfined within the stellar disc), and propose to focus on intermediate and\nlarge latitudes. We address the dependence of the signal to background ratio on\nthe model adopted to describe the propagation of charged CRs in the Galaxy, and\nfind that, in general, the DM-induced signal can be detected by the Fermi\nGamma-ray Space Telescope at energies above 100 GeV.

In addition to\nseveral X-ray sources, diffuse emission was significantly detected associated\nwith its west lobe, but the east lobe was contaminated by an unidentified X-ray\nsource WARP J1552.4+2007. After careful evaluation of the X-ray and Non X-ray\nbackground, the 0.4 -- 7 keV X-ray spectrum of the west lobe is described by a\npower-law model. The photon index and 1 keV flux density was derived as\n$1.82_{-0.24}^{+0.26}\\pm0.04$ and $19.4_{-3.2}^{+3.3}\\pm 3.0$ nJy,\nrespectively, where the first and second errors represent the statistical and\nsystematic ones. The diffuse X-rays were attributed to be inverse Compton\nradiation by the synchrotron radio electrons scattering off the cosmic\nmicrowave background photons. This radio galaxy is the largest among those with\nlobes detected through inverse Compton X-ray emission. A comparison of the\nradio to X-ray fluxes yields the energy densities of electron and magnetic\nfield as $u_e = (2.3 \\pm 0.3 \\pm 0.3) \\times 10^{-13}$ ergs/cm3 and $u_m =\n(1.2_{-0.1}^{+0.2}\\pm 0.2) \\times 10^{-14}$ ergs/cm3, respectively.

The bulge and thick disks of modern\ngalaxies may form this way. Simulations of minor mergers make thick disks too,\nbut there is an important difference. Thick disks made by internal processes\nhave a constant scale height with galactocentric radius, but thick disks made\nby mergers flare. The difference arises because in the first case,\nperpendicular forcing and disk-gravity resistance are both proportional to the\ndisk column density, so the resulting scale height is independent of this\ndensity. In the case of mergers, perpendicular forcing is independent of the\ncolumn density and the low density regions get thicker; the resulting flaring\nis inconsistent with observations. Late-stage gas accretion and thin disk\ngrowth are shown to preserve the constant scale heights of thick disks formed\nby internal evolution.

Abstract: This review addresses the issue of whether there are physically realistic\nself-similar solutions in which a primordial black hole is attached to an exact\nor asymptotically Friedmann model for an equation of state of the form\n$p=(\\gamma-1)\\rho c^2$. In the positive pressure case ($1 < \\gamma < 2$), there\nis no such solution when the black hole is attached to an exact Friedmann\nbackground via a sonic point. However, it has been claimed that there is a\none-parameter family of asymptotically Friedmann black hole solutions providing\nthe ratio of the black hole size to the cosmological horizon size is in a\nnarrow range above some critical value. There are also \"universal\" black holes\nin which the black hole has an apparent horizon but no event horizon. It turns\nout that both these types of solution are only asymptotically {\\it\nquasi}-Friedmann, because they contain a solid angle deficit at large\ndistances, but they are not necessarily excluded observationally.\n  We also consider the possibility of self-similar black hole solutions in a\nuniverse dominated by a scalar field. If the field is massless, the situation\nresembles the stiff fluid case, so any black hole solution is again contrived,\nalthough there may still be universal black hole solutions. The situation is\nless clear if the scalar field is rolling down a potential and therefore\nmassive, as in the quintessence scenario. Although no explicit asymptotically\nFriedmann black hole solutions of this kind are known, they are not excluded\nand comparison with the $0 < \\gamma < 2/3$ perfect fluid case suggests that\nthey should exist if the black hole is not too large. This implies that a black\nhole might grow as fast as the cosmological horizon in a quintessence-dominated\nuniverse in some circumstances, supporting the proposal that accretion onto\nprimordial black holes may have played a role in the production of the\nsupermassive black holes in galactic nuclei. \n\n"}

The angular resolution of the maps is as high as\n0.15arcsec, or 20AU at the distance of the Taurus cloud, which is a factor of 2\nhigher than has been achieved to date at these wavelengths. The unprecedented\ndetail of the resulting disk images enables us to address three important\nquestions related to the formation of planets. (1) What is the radial\ndistribution of the circumstellar dust? (2) Does the dust emission show any\nindication of gaps that might signify the presence of (proto-)planets? (3) Do\nthe dust properties depend on the orbital radius? We find that modeling the\ndisk surface density in terms of either a classical power law or the similarity\nsolution for viscous disk evolution, reproduces the observations well. The\n1.3mm image from RYTau shows two peaks separated by 0.2arcsec with a decline in\nthe dust emission toward the stellar position, which is significant at about\n2-4sigma. For both RYTau and DGTau, the dust emission at radii larger than 15\nAU displays no significant deviation from an unperturbed viscous disk model.

We use an inhomogeneous chemical evolution model for the Galactic\nhalo to predict both the mean trend and scatter of C/O and N/O. In one set of\nmodels, we assume that massive stars enrich the interstellar medium during both\nthe stellar wind and supernovae phases. In the second set, we consider that in\nthe earliest phases (Z <10^-8), stars with masses above 40 Msun only enrich the\ninterstellar medium via stellar winds, collapsing directly into black holes. We\npredict a larger scatter in the C/O and N/O ratios at low metallicities when\nallowing the more massive fast-rotating stars to contribute to the chemical\nenrichment only via stellar winds. The latter assumption, combined with the\nstochasticity in the star formation process in the primordial Galactic halo can\nexplain the wide spread observed in the N/O and C/O ratios in normal\nvery-metal-poor stars. For chemical elements with stellar yields that depend\nstrongly on initial mass (and rotation) such as C, N, and neutron capture\nelements, within the range of massive stars, a large scatter is expected once\nthe stochastic enrichment of the early interstellar medium is taken into\naccount.

The derived ages range from very young ages (7.4 Myr) to 437\nMyr with a median age of 25 Myr. The color excess E(B-V) are between 0.1-0.4\nmag. Star formation rates are 55-209 Msun/yr. A comparison of the stellar\npopulations is made between three LAEs and 88 LBGs selected at the same\nredshift, in the same observed field, and down to the same limit of the\nrest-frame UV luminosity. These three LAEs are the brightest and reddest\nsamples among the whole LAE samples at z=4.86. The LAEs distribute at the\nrelatively faint part of UV-luminosity distribution of LBGs. Deriving the\nstellar properties of the LBGs by fitting their SEDs with the same model\nensures that model difference does not affect the comparison. It is found that\nthe stellar properties of the LAEs lie on distributions of those of LBGs. On\naverage, the LAEs show less dust extinction, and lower star formation rates\nthan LBGs, while the stellar mass of LAEs nearly lies in the middle part of the\nmass distribution of LBGs. However, the stellar properties of LAEs and LBGs are\nsimilar at the fixed UV or optical luminosity.

Abstract: Theoretical models have had difficulty matching the observed number density\nof sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs), causing some authors (e.g., Baugh et al.\n2005) to suggest that SMGs provide evidence for a top-heavy initial mass\nfunction (IMF). To test this claim, we have, for the first time, combined\nhigh-resolution 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of isolated and merging massive,\ngas-rich galaxies, radiative transfer, and a semi-empirical merger rate model\nto predict the number density of SMGs. Our model can reproduce the observed SMG\nnumber density even when using a standard (Kroupa) IMF. The agreement is due to\na combination of relatively long sub-mm duty cycles for mergers (a few times\n10^8 years for our most massive models), which owe to our combination of\nhigh-resolution 3-D hydrodynamic simulations and dust radiative transfer;\nsufficient number densities of massive, gas-rich mergers; and the decrease in\nsub-mm counts observed by recent deep/wide surveys (e.g., Austermann et al.\n2010) relative to previous surveys.

Consistent with the\npowerful, high-z giant radio galaxies we have studied previously, X-rays seem\nto be invariably found where the lobe plasma is oldest even where the radio\nemission has long since faded. The hotspot complexes seem to show structures\nresembling the double shock structure exhibited by the largest radio quasar\n4C74.26, with the X-ray shock again being offset closer to the nucleus than the\nradio synchrotron shock. In the current paper, the offsets between these shocks\nare even larger at 35kpc. Unusually for a classical double (FRII) radio source,\nthere is smooth low surface-brightness radio emission associated with the\nregions beyond the hotspots (further away from the nucleus than the hotspots\nthemselves), which seems to be symmetric for the ends of both jets. We consider\npossible explanations for this phenomenon, and conclude that it arises from\nhigh-energy electrons, recently accelerated in the nearby radio hotspots that\nare leaking into a pre-existing weakly-magnetized plasma that are symmetric\nrelic lobes fed from a previous episode of jet activity.

The diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism is usually\ninvoked to explain this acceleration, but the way in which electrons are\ninitially energized or 'injected' into this acceleration process starting from\nthermal energies is an unresolved problem. In this paper we study the initial\nacceleration of electrons in non-relativistic shocks from first principles,\nusing two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations. We\nsystematically explore the space of shock parameters (the Alfv\\'enic Mach\nnumber, M_A, the shock velocity, v_{sh}, the angle between the upstream\nmagnetic field and the shock normal, theta_{Bn}, and the ion to electron mass\nratio, m_i/m_e). We find that significant non-thermal acceleration occurs due\nto the growth of oblique whistler waves in the foot of quasi-perpendicular\nshocks. The obtained electron energy distributions show power law tails with\nspectral indices up to alpha ~ 3-4. The maximum energies of the accelerated\nparticles are consistent with the electron Larmor radii being comparable to\nthat of the ions, indicating potential injection into the subsequent DSA\nprocess. This injection mechanism, however, requires the shock waves to have\nfairly low Alf\\'enic Mach numbers, M_A <~ 20, which is consistent with the\ntheoretical conditions for the growth of whistler waves in the shock foot (M_A\n<~ (m_i/m_e)^{1/2}). Thus, if the whistler mechanism is the only robust\nelectron injection process at work in SNR shocks, then SNRs that display\nnon-thermal emission must have significantly amplified upstream magnetic\nfields. Such field amplification is likely achieved by the escaping cosmic\nrays, so electron and proton acceleration in SNR shocks must be interconnected. \n\n"}

Detection of lithium in the metal-poor bulge dwarf\n  MOA-2010-BLG-285S Abstract: Context: In order to study the evolution of Li in the Galaxy it is necessary\nto observe dwarf or subgiant stars. Abridged Although Li has been extensively\nstudied in the Galactic disk and halo, to date there is only one uncertain\ndetection of Li in an unevolved bulge star. AIMS: Our aim with this study is to\nprovide the first clear detection of Li in the Galactic bulge, based on an\nanalysis of a dwarf star that has largely retained its initial Li abundance.\nMETHODS: We have performed a detailed elemental abundance analysis of the bulge\ndwarf star MOA-2010-BLG-285S using a high-resolution, and high signal-to-noise\nspectrum obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the VLT when the object was\noptically magnified during a gravitational microlensing event (visual\nmagnification A~550 during observation). The lithium abundance was determined\nthrough synthetic line profile fitting of the 7Li resonance doublet line at\n670.8 nm. The results have been corrected for departures from LTE. Results:\nMOA-2010-BLG-285S is, at [Fe/H]=-1.23, the most metal-poor dwarf star detected\nso far in the Galactic bulge. Its old age (12.5 Gyr) and enhanced [alpha/Fe]\nratios agree well with stars in the thick disk at similar metallicity. This\nstar represents the first unambiguous detection of Li in a metal-poor dwarf\nstar in the Galactic bulge. We find an NLTE corrected Li abundance of log\ne(Li)=2.16, which is consistent with values derived for Galactic disk and halo\ndwarf stars at similar metallicities and temperatures. Conclusion: Our results\nshow that there are no signs of Li enrichment or production in the Galactic\nbulge during its earliest phases. Observations of Li in other galaxies (omega\nCen) and other components of the Galaxy suggest further that the Spite plateau\nis universal. \n\n"}

We\nresolve the emission from the protostar radio Source I and BN at several\nepochs. Source I is highly elongated NW-SE, and remarkably stable in flux\ndensity, position angle, and overall morphology over nearly a decade. This\nfavors the extended emission component arising from an ionized disk rather than\na jet. We have measured the proper motions of Source I and BN for the first\ntime at 43 GHz. We confirm that both sources are moving at high speed (12 and\n26 km/s, respectively) approximately in opposite directions, as previously\ninferred from measurements at lower frequencies. We discuss dynamical scenarios\nthat can explain the large motions of both BN and Source I and the presence of\ndisks around both. Our new measurements support the hypothesis that a close\n(~50 AU) dynamical interaction occurred around 500 years ago between Source I\nand BN as proposed by Gomez et al. From the dynamics of encounter we argue that\nSource I today is likely to be a binary with a total mass on the order of 20\nMsun, and that it probably existed as a softer binary before the close\nencounter. This enables preservation of the original accretion disk, though\ntruncated to its present radius of ~50 AU. N-body numerical simulations show\nthat the dynamical interaction between a binary of 20 Msun total mass (I) and a\nsingle star of 10 Msun mass (BN) may lead to the ejection of both and binary\nhardening. The gravitational energy released in the process would be large\nenough to power the wide-angle flow traced by H2 and CO emission in the BN/KL\nnebula.

Forty seven of the 222 BzK\ngalaxies in the central region of the CDF-S are detected at X-ray energies, 11\nof which have hard X-ray spectral slopes (Gamma<1) indicating the presence of\nheavily obscured AGN activity. The other 36 X-ray detected BzK galaxies appear\nto be relatively unobscured AGNs and starburst galaxies; we use X-ray\nvariability analyses over a rest-frame baseline of ~3 years to further confirm\nthe presence of AGN activity in many of these systems. The majority (7 out of\n11) of the heavily obscured AGNs have excess IR emission over that expected\nfrom star formation (termed \"IR-excess galaxies\"). However, we find that X-ray\ndetected heavily obscured AGNs only comprise ~25% of the IR-excess galaxy\npopulation, which is otherwise composed of relatively unobscured AGNs and\nstarburst galaxies. We find that the typical X-ray spectrum of the heavily\nobscured AGNs is better characterized by a pure reflection model than an\nabsorbed power-law model, suggesting extreme Compton-thick absorption in some\nsystems. We verify this result by producing a composite rest-frame 2-20 keV\nspectrum, which has a similar shape as a reflection-dominated X-ray spectrum\nand reveals an emission feature at rest-frame energy ~6.4 keV, likely to be due\nto Fe K.

While galactic supernovae can be\nresolved with this technique, the supernova neutrino emission spectrum remains\nunconstrained and thus presents a limited potential for the topics related to\nsupernova core collapse models.\n  The paper elaborates analytically on the capabilities of IceCube to detect\nsupernovae through the analysis of hits in the detector correlated in space and\ntime. These arise from supernova neutrinos interacting in the instrumented\ndetector volume along single strings. Although the effective detection volume\nfor such coincidental hits is much smaller ($\\gtrsim 35\\,$kton, about the scale\nof SuperK), a wealth of information is obtained due to the comparatively low\ncoincidental noise rate.

Eight percent of the sample is made up of massive galaxies\nwith M*>10^11 Msun.

Our results show that SFR\nincreases at higher stellar mass such that massive galaxies nearly double their\nstellar mass from star formation alone over the redshift range studied, but the\naverage value of SFR for a given stellar mass remains constant over this 2 Gyr\nperiod. Furthermore, we find no strong evolution in the SFR for our sample as a\nfunction of mass over our redshift range of interest, in particular we do not\nfind a decline in the SFR among massive galaxies, as is seen at z < 1.

Here, we review the theory and observations of cluster\ndisruption, both the suggested initial rapid dissolution phase (infant\nmortality) and the longer timescale processes that affect clusters after they\nemerge from their progenitor GMCs. Over the past decade, the standard paradigm\nthat has developed is that all/most stars are formed in clusters and that the\nvast majority of these groups are disrupted over short timescales (< 10 Myr).\nThis is thought to be due to the removal of the left over gas from the\nstar-formation process, known as infant mortality. However, recent results have\nsuggested that the fraction of stars that form in clusters has been\noverestimated, with the majority being formed in unbound groups (i.e.\nassociations) which expand and disrupt without the need of invoking gas\nremoval. Dynamical measurements of young massive clusters in the Galaxy suggest\nthat clusters reach a stable equilibrium at very young (<3 Myr) ages,\nsuggesting that gas expulsion has little effect on the cluster. After the early\ndynamical phase, clusters appear to be long lived and stable objects.

For this\npurpose we generate star cluster models with different degrees of mass\nsegregation and fractal substructure and analyse them. We quantify mass\nsegregation by measuring, from the projected 2d model data, the mass function\nslope in radial annuli, by looking for colour gradients in radial colour\nprofiles, by measuring Allison's Lambda parameter, and by determining the local\nstellar surface density around each star.

The continuum also varied, but by\nonly ~30%, and even decreased at a time when the gas emission was increasing.\nThe H I line at 1.083 microns was also found to vary in a manner inconsistent\nwith that of either the hydrogen lines or the dust. Both the gas and dust\nvariabilities indicate significant changes in the region of the inner gas and\nthe inner dust belt that may be common to many young disk systems. If planets\nare responsible for defining the inner edge of the gap, they could interact\nwith the material on time scales commensurate with what is observed for the\nvariations in the dust, while other disk instabilities (thermal,\nmagnetorotational) would operate there on longer time scales than we observe\nfor the inner dust belt. For SAO 206462, the orbital period would likely be 1-3\nyears. If the changes are being induced in the disk material closer to the star\nthan the gap, a variety of mechanisms (disk instabilities, interactions via\nplanets) might be responsible for the changes seen. The He I feature is most\nlikely due to a wind whose orientation changes with respect to the observer on\ntime scales of a day or less. To further constrain the origin of the gas and\ndust emission will require multiple spectroscopic and interferometric\nobservations on both shorter and longer time scales that have been sampled so\nfar. \n\n"}

To account for the phase alignment, we\nexplore geometric models where both the radio and gamma-ray emission originate\neither in the outer magnetosphere near the light cylinder (R_LC) or near the\npolar caps (PCs). We obtain reasonable fits for the first three of these MSPs\nin the context of \"altitude-limited\" outer gap (alOG) and two-pole caustic\n(alTPC) geometries. The outer magnetosphere phase-aligned models differ from\nthe standard outer gap (OG) / two-pole caustic (TPC) models in two respects:\nfirst, the radio emission originates in caustics at relatively high altitudes\ncompared to the usual low-altitude conal radio beams; second, we allow the\nmaximum altitude of the gamma-ray emission region as well as both the minimum\nand maximum altitudes of the radio emission region to vary within a limited\nrange. Alternatively, there also exist phase-aligned LC solutions for emission\noriginating near the stellar surface in a slot gap (SG) scenario (\"low-altitude\nslot gap\" (laSG) models). We find best-fit LCs using a Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) maximum likelihood approach. Our fits imply that the phase-aligned LCs\nare likely of caustic origin, produced in the outer magnetosphere, and that the\nradio emission may come from close to R_LC. We lastly constrain the emission\naltitudes with typical uncertainties of ~0.3R_LC.

The entire sample consist of 161\nsources observed by XMM for more than 10 ks in pointed observations which is\nthe largest sample used so far to study AGN X-ray variability on time scales\nless than a day. We compute the excess variance for all AGN, on different\ntime-scales (10, 20, 40 and 80 ks) and in different energy bands (0.3-0.7,\n0.7-2 and 2-10 keV). We observe a highly significant and tight (~0.7 dex)\ncorrelation between excess variance and MBH. The subsample of reverberation\nmapped AGN shows an even smaller scatter (~0.45 dex) comparable to the one\ninduced by the MBH uncertainties. This implies that X-ray variability can be\nused as an accurate tool to measure MBH and this method is more accurate than\nthe ones based on single epoch optical spectra. The excess variance vs.\naccretion rate dependence is weaker than expected based on the PSD break\nfrequency scaling, suggesting that both the PSD high frequency break and the\nnormalisation depend on accretion rate in such a way that they almost\ncompletely counterbalance each other. A highly significant correlation between\nexcess variance and 2-10 keV spectral index is observed. Both the variability\nvs. LBol and FWHM_Hbeta correlations are consistent with being just by-products\nof the correlation with MBH. The soft and medium variability is very well\ncorrelated with the hard variability, suggesting that the additional soft\ncomponents (i.e. soft excess, warm absorber) add a minor contribution to the\ntotal variability. Once the variability is rescaled for MBH and mdot, no\nsignificant difference between narrow-line and broad-line Seyfert 1 is\nobserved.

The motion of particles with trajectories close to\nthe curved magnetic lines is usually referred to the so-called curvature\nradiation. The latter is treated within the formalism of synchrotron radiation\nby replacing the particle Larmor radius with the curvature radius of the field\nlines. However, even at small pitch angles, the curvatures of the particle\ntrajectory and the field line may differ significantly. Moreover, as we show in\nthis paper the trajectory curvature varies with time, i.e. the process has a\nstochastic character. Therefore for calculations of observable characteristics\nof radiation by an ensemble of particles, the radiation intensities should be\naveraged over time. In this paper, for determination of particle trajectories\nwe use the Hamiltonian formalism, and show that that close to curved magnetic\nlines, for the given configuration of the magnetic field, the initial point and\nparticle energy, always exist a smooth trajectory without fast oscillations of\nthe curvature radius. This is the trajectory which is responsible for the\ncurvature radiation. The realization of this regime requires the initial\nparticle velocity to be directed strictly along the smooth trajectory.

By incorporating an\nevolving ionising escape fraction and a treatment for self-shielding within\nLyman limit systems, we have run the first simulations of \"photon-starved\"\nreionisation scenarios that simultaneously reproduce observations of the\nabundance of galaxies, the optical depth to electron scattering of cosmic\nmicrowave background photons \\tau, and the effective optical depth to\nLyman\\alpha absorption at z=5. We confirm that an ionising background reduces\nthe clumping factor C by more than 50% by smoothing moderately-overdense\n(\\Delta=1--100) regions. Meanwhile, outflows increase clumping only modestly.\nThe clumping factor of ionised gas is much lower than the overall baryonic\nclumping factor because the most overdense gas is self-shielded.\nPhotoionisation heating further suppresses recombinations if reionisation heats\ngas above the canonical 10,000 K.

The new 3D\nratios for 13C and 18O are: R23= 91.4 +/- 1.3 (Rsun= 89.2); and R68= 511 +/- 10\n(Rsun= 499), where the uncertainties are 1 sigma and \"optimistic.\" We also\nobtained R67= 2738 +/- 118 (Rsun= 2632), but we caution that the observed\n12C17O features are extremely weak. The new solar ratios for the oxygen\nisotopes fall between the terrestrial values and those reported by Genesis\n(R68= 530, R6= 2798), although including both within 2 sigma error flags, and\ngo in the direction favoring recent theories for the oxygen isotope composition\nof Ca-Al inclusions (CAI) in primitive meteorites. While not a major focus of\nthis work, we derive an oxygen abundance of 603 +/- 9 ppm (relative to\nhydrogen; 8.78 on the logarithmic H= 12 scale). That the Sun likely is lighter\nthan the Earth, isotopically speaking, removes the necessity to invoke exotic\nfractionation processes during the early construction of the inner solar\nsystem. \n\n"}

For a known cosmic ray\nspectral behavior, the main parameters in the calcula- tion of the neutrino\nflux from proton-proton interactions are the target density nH and the ratio of\nelectrons to protons fe . Using most recent neutrino flux limits from IceCube\npoint source searches, we set limits on the target densities for 33 FR-I\ngalaxies. The densities are shown to be smaller than 30 cm^{-3} to 2000\ncm^{-3}, depending on the source and when using a fixed electron to proton\nratio of f_{e} = 0.1.

Using published dataset, we show that\nsome projections of the gSR are the most efficient relations, holding among\nobserved physical X-ray quantities, to recover the cluster mass. This\nconclusion is based on the evidence that they provide the lowest chi^2, the\nlowest total scatter and the lowest intrinsic scatter among the studied scaling\nlaws on both galaxy group and cluster mass scales. By the application of the\ngSR, the intrinsic scatter is reduced in all the cases down to a relative error\non M_tot below 16 per cent.

The source exhibits remarkable spectral\nvariability from months to years timescales. The observed spectral variability\nis entirely due to variations of the column density of a neutral absorber\ntowards the intrinsic nuclear continuum. The column density is generally\nCompton-thin ranging from a few times 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ to a few times\n10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. However, one observation reveals a Compton-thick state\nwith column density of the order of 1.5 $\\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. The\nobserved variability offers a rare opportunity to study the properties of the\nX-ray absorber(s) in an active galaxy. We identify variable X-ray absorption\nfrom two different components, namely (i) a clumpy torus whose individual\nclumps have a density of $\\leq$ 1.7 $\\times$ 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$ and an average\ncolumn density of $\\sim$ 4 $\\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, and (ii) the broad\nline region (BLR), comprising individual clouds with density of 0.1-8 $\\times$\n10$^9$ cm$^{-3}$ and column density of 10$^{23}$-10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. The\nderived properties of the clumpy torus can also be used to estimate the torus\nhalf-opening angle, which is of the order of 47 $^\\circ$. We also confirm the\npreviously reported detection of two highly ionized warm absorbers with outflow\nvelocities of 1000-4000 km s$^{-1}$. The observed outflow velocities are\nconsistent with the Keplerian/escape velocity at the BLR. Hence, the warm\nabsorbers may be tentatively identified with the warm/hot inter-cloud medium\nwhich ensures that the BLR clouds are in pressure equilibrium with their\nsurroundings. The BLR line-emitting clouds may well be the cold, dense clumps\nof this outflow, whose warm/hot phase is likely more homogeneous, as suggested\nby the lack of strong variability of the warm absorber(s) properties during our\nmonitoring. \n\n"}

We systematically analyze the Swift/XRT light curves of long GRBs\ndetected before 2013 August, and characterize them into four categories based\non how likely they may harbor a magnetar central engine: Gold, Silver,\nAluminum, and Non-magnetar. We also independently analyze the data of short\nGRBs with a putative magnetar central engine. We then perform a statistical\nstudy of various properties of the magnetar samples and the non-magnetar\nsample, and investigate whether the data are consistent with the hypothesis\nthat there exist two types of central engines. By deriving the physical\nparameters of the putative magnetars, we find that the observations of the Gold\nand Silver samples are generally consistent with the predictions of the\nmagnetar model. For a reasonable beaming factor for long GRBs, the derived\nmagnetar surface magnetic field $B_p$ and initial spin period $P_0$ fall into\nthe reasonable range.

At some point, this mode\nspontaneously and randomly changes to a strongly-coupled mode, the transition\noccurring with a mass-dependent lifetime that is of order 100 MYr.

Determining the time-evolution of density and peculiar velocity\ndemands solving the full Vlasov hierarchy for the moments of the phase space\ndistribution function. In the presence of long-range interaction no consistent\ntruncation of the hierarchy is known apart from the pressure- less fluid (dust)\nmodel which is incapable of describing virialization due to the occurrence of\nshell-crossing singularities and the inability to generate vorticity and higher\ncumulants like velocity dispersion. Our goal is to find a simple ansatz for the\nphase space distribution function that approximates the full Vlasov\ndistribution function without pathologies in a controlled way and therefore can\nserve as theoretical N-body double and as a replacement for the dust model.

In this band the Compton component is rapidly rising\nalmost up to the peak of the emission. Simultaneous soft-X-rays and UV-optical\nobservations were performed with the Swift satellite, while near-infrared (NIR)\ndata were obtained with the REM telescope. To study their variability, we\nrepeated these observations for both sources on a timescale of a few months.\nWhile no fast variability was detected during a single observation, both\nsources were found to be variable in the X-ray band, up to 50%, between the two\nobservations, with larger variability at higher energies. No variability was\ndetected in the optical/NIR band. These data together with Fermi-LAT, WISE and\nother literature data are then used to study the overall spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of these blazars.

As a first step to compute the tidal Love\nnumbers of a spinning compact star, here we extend powerful perturbative\ntechniques to compute the exterior geometry of a spinning object distorted by\nan axisymmetric tidal field to second order in the angular momentum. The spin\nof the object introduces couplings between electric and magnetic deformations\nand new classes of induced Love numbers emerge.

This significance is typically addressed by\nrunning a large number of simulations to derive the probability density\nfunction (PDF) of the feature-amplitude in the Gaussian case. Although these\nsimulations are tractable for the power spectrum, for the bispectrum they\nrequire significant computational resources. We show that, by assuming that the\nPDF is given by a multi-variate Gaussian where the covariance is determined by\nthe Fisher matrix of the sine and cosine terms, we can efficiently produce\nspectra that are statistically close to those derived from full simulations. By\ndrawing a large number of spectra from this PDF, both for the power spectrum\nand the bispectrum, we can quickly determine the statistical significance of\ncandidate signatures in the CMB, considering both single frequency and\nmulti-frequency estimators.

Here, the mathematical correspondence\nbetween the KD and a specific stochastic differential equation (SDE) viewed\nfrom the perspective of the supersymmetric theory of stochastics (STS) is\ndiscussed. The STS is a novel, approximation-free framework to investigate\nSDEs. The correspondence reported here permits insights from the STS to be\napplied to the theory of KD and vice versa. It was previously known that the\nfast KD in the idealistic limit of no magnetic diffusion requires chaotic\nflows. The KD-STS correspondence shows that this is also true for the diffusive\nKD. From the STS perspective, the KD possesses a topological supersymmetry and\nthe dynamo effect can be viewed as its spontaneous breakdown. This\nsupersymmetry breaking can be regarded as the stochastic generalization of the\nconcept of dynamical chaos. As this supersymmetry breaking happens in both the\ndiffusive and the non-diffusive case, the necessity of the underlying SDE being\nchaotic is given in either case. The observed exponentially growing and\noscillating KD modes prove physically that dynamical spectra of the STS\nevolution operator that break the topological supersymmetry exist with both,\nreal and complex ground state eigenvalues.

We calculate the coronal properties required to produce the observed radio\nemission in RQ AGN, either from synchrotron emission of power-law (PL)\nelectrons, or from cyclo-synchrotron emission of hot mildly-relativistic\nthermal electrons. We find that a flat spectrum, as observed in about half of\nRQ AGN, can be produced by corona with a disc or a spherical configuration,\nwhich extends from the innermost regions out to a pc scale. A spectral break to\nan optically thin power-law emission is expected around 300-1000 GHz, as the\ninnermost corona becomes optically thin. In case of thermal electrons, a sharp\nspectral cutoff is expected above the break. The position of the break can be\nmeasured with VLBI observations, which exclude the cold dust emission, and it\ncan be used to probe the properties of the innermost corona.

Recently,\nmeasurements of the changes in the magnification ratio of the individual images\nhave been proposed as a powerful tool for estimation of the size and velocity\nof the emission region in the lensed source.

Beyond r~30 kpc the intra-cluster\nmedium (ICM) appears remarkably isothermal.

The sloshing is the result\nof the strongly perturbed gravitational potential in the cluster core, with the\ncentral brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) being displaced southward from the\nglobal center of mass. The residual image reveals a likely subcluster south of\nthe core at the projected distance of r~280 kpc. The cluster also harbors a\nlikely radio phoenix, a source revived by adiabatic compression by gas motions\nin the ICM. Even though the Ophiuchus cluster is strongly dynamically active,\nthe amplitude of density fluctuations outside of the cooling core is low,\nindicating velocities smaller than ~100 km/s.

This finding is at\nodds with formation theories that invoke the migration of such planets from\nsemi-major axes >~1AU due to secular dynamical processes (e.g., secular chaos,\nLidov-Kozai oscillations) coupled with tidal dissipation. In fact, the results\nof N-body integrations show that the evolution of dynamically unstable systems\ndoes not lead to tidal migration but rather to planet ejections and collisions\nwith the host star.

In contrast, the MZR of RXJ1532+30 is consistent with the local\ncomparison sample. RXJ1532+30 exhibits a bimodal radial metallicity\ndistribution, with one branch showing a similar negative gradient as\nMACS1115+01 (-0.14+/-0.05 dex/Mpc) and the other branch showing a positive\nradial gradient. The positive gradient branch in RXJ1532+30 is likely caused by\neither interloper galaxies or an in-plane merger, indicating that cluster-scale\nabundance gradients probe cluster substructures and thus the dynamical state of\na cluster. Most strikingly, we discover that neither the radial metallicity\ngradient nor the offset from the MZR is driven by the stellar mass. We compare\nour observations with Rhapsody-G cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in\nsimulations of relaxed galaxy clusters and find that the simulated galaxy\ncluster also exhibits a negative abundance gradient, albeit with a shallower\nslope (-0.04+/-0.03 dex/Mpc). Our observations suggest that the negative radial\ngradient originates from ram-pressure stripping and/or strangulation processes\nin the cluster environments. \n\n"}

We\ncompare these galaxies to a control sample of average galaxies detected in the\nHI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS, Barnes et al. 2001). As the control sample is\nmatched in stellar luminosity, we find that the stellar properties of HIX\ngalaxies are similar to the control sample. Furthermore, the specific star\nformation rate and optical morphology do not differ between HIX and control\ngalaxies. We find, however, the HIX galaxies to be less efficient in forming\nstars. For the most HI massive galaxy in our sample (ESO075-G006, $\\rm log\\\nM_{HI}\\ [M_{\\odot}] = 10.8$) the kinematic properties are the reason for\ninefficient star formation and HI excess. Examining the Australian Telescope\nCompact Array (ATCA) HI imaging and Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) optical\nspectra of ESO075-G006 reveals an undisturbed galaxy without evidence for\nrecent major, violent accretion events. A tilted-ring fit to the HI disc\ntogether with the gas-phase oxygen abundance distribution supports the scenario\nthat gas has been constantly accreted onto ESO07-G006 but the high specific\nangular momentum makes ESO075-G006 very inefficient in forming stars.

However, there are other key observables, such as the\nmetallicity distribution function (MDF), that may shed some light in this\nmatter. We argue that the shape of the MDF not only tells us whether the\nstellar disc experienced radial migration, but it also contains important clues\non the structure that triggered it. Specifically, the MDF contains information\nabout the dynamics and morphology of the spiral pattern. To constrain the\nspiral parameters, we have included a detailed chemical tagging in our\nsimulations; this allows us to produce a restriction of the structural\nparameters of the spiral arms in the Milky Way as well as a method to constrain\nchemical evolution models towards the center of the Galactic disc, where no\nchemical model provides information. We also found that it is unlikely that the\nSun was formed near its current galactocentric position, therefore it might be\ninaccurate to consider the Sun as representative of the chemical abundances in\nthe solar neighborhood. We also show that a stellar disc of the Milky Way,\nafter evolving dynamically and chemically for 5 Gyr, preserves 80% of its\noriginal global metallicity gradient despite having suffered important heating\nand radial migration; this means that the presence of a metallicity gradient in\na given galaxy, does not guarantee that radial mixing has not played a role in\nits evolution. \n\n"}

We report on a new method to determine ejecta neutronization\nusing Ca and S lines in the X-ray spectra of Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs).\nApplying this method to \\textit{Suzaku} data of Tycho, Kepler, 3C 397 and\nG337.2$-$0.7 in the Milky Way, and N103B in the Large Magellanic Cloud, we find\nthat the neutronization of the ejecta in N103B is comparable to that of Tycho\nand Kepler, which suggests that progenitor metallicity is not the only source\nof neutronization in SNe Ia.

The transient was previously claimed to be a Type\nIIn SLSN due to its luminosity and hydrogen emission lines. The light curve\nshows that PS16dtm brightened by about two magnitudes in ~50 days relative to\nthe archival host brightness and then exhibited a plateau phase for about 100\ndays followed by the onset of fading in the UV. During the plateau PS16dtm\nshowed no color evolution, maintained a blackbody temperature of 1.7 x 10$^4$\nK, and radiated at approximately $L_{Edd}$ of the SMBH. The spectra exhibit\nmulti-component hydrogen emission lines and strong FeII emission, show little\nevolution with time, and closely resemble the spectra of NLS1s while being\ndistinct from those of Type IIn SNe. Moreover, PS16dtm is undetected in the\nX-rays to a limit an order of magnitude below an archival X-ray detection of\nits host galaxy. These observations strongly link PS16dtm to activity\nassociated with the SMBH and are difficult to reconcile with a SN origin or any\nknown form of AGN variability, and therefore we argue that it is a TDE in which\nthe accretion of the stellar debris powers the rise in the continuum and\nexcitation of the pre-existing broad line region, while providing material that\nobscures the X-ray emitting region of the pre-existing AGN accretion disk.

This study is\nperformed by exploiting the multi-wavelength, from UV to sub-mm bands,\nDustPedia database, in addition to molecular (12CO) and atomic (HI) gas maps\nand metallicity abundance information available in the literature.

Because the Alfv\\'en speed\nvaries with distance from the disk, the AWs undergo partial non-WKB reflection,\nand counter-propagating AWs subsequently interact, causing AW energy to cascade\nto small scales and dissipate. To investigate this process, we introduce an\nElsasser-like formulation of general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) and develop the\ntheory of general relativistic reduced MHD in an inhomogeneous medium. We then\nderive a set of equations for the mean-square AW amplitude $M_+$ and turbulent\nheating rate $Q$ under the assumption that, in the plasma rest frame, AWs\npropagating away from the disk are much more energetic than AWs propagating\ntoward the disk. For the case in which the background flow is axisymmetric and\ntime-independent, we solve these equations analytically to determine $M_+$ and\n$Q$ as functions of position. We find that, for an idealized thin disk threaded\nby a large-scale poloidal magnetic field, the AW energy flux is $\\sim\n(\\rho_{\\rm b}/\\rho_{\\rm d})^{1/2} \\beta_{\\rm net,d}^{-1/2}$ times the disk's\nradiative flux, where $\\rho_{\\rm b}$ and $\\rho_{\\rm d}$ are the mass densities\nat the coronal base and disk midplane, respectively, and $\\beta_{\\rm net,d}$ is\nthe ratio (evaluated at the disk midplane) of plasma-plus-radiation pressure to\nthe pressure of the average vertical magnetic field.

Because of the beam size of the upcoming radio\ntelescopes at high redshifts, most of the theoretical models are focused on the\ninhomogeneities on scales above few comoving megaparsecs.

In\nthis study we explore whether the perturbations on small scales ($\\lesssim\n1h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$) can affect the 21cm signal on larger scales. Two distinct\nmechanism are discussed. First, we show that during the cosmic dawn small scale\nperturbations regulate the formation time of the first Lyman-alpha Emitters\n(LAE), and consequently the coupling timing of spin and kinetic temperatures.\nDue to the low number density of LAE, the inhomogeneity of coupling includes\nthe shot noise and manifests itself in the observed 21cm power spectrum.

After many theoretical attempts to understand the\nmeaning of $\\Lambda$, and in view of the enhanced accuracy of the cosmological\nobservations, it seems now mandatory that this issue should be first settled\nempirically before further theoretical speculations on its ultimate nature. In\nthis work, we summarize the situation of some of these studies. Devoted\nanalyses made recently show that the $\\Lambda=$const. hypothesis, despite being\nthe simplest, may well not be the most favored one. The overall fit to the\ncosmological observables $SNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+CMB$ singles out the class RVM of\nthe \"running\" vacuum models, in which $\\Lambda=\\Lambda(H)$ is an affine\npower-law function of the Hubble rate.

We analyze new VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL polarimetric\nimages of HD 100546 with filters in H$\\alpha$ and the adjacent continuum. We\nhave probed the disk gap and the surface layers of the outer disk, covering a\nregion < 500 mas (< 55 au at 109 pc) from the star, at an angular resolution of\n~ 20 mas. Our data show an asymmetry: the SE and NW regions of the outer disk\nare more polarized than the SW and NE. This can be explained from a\npreferential scattering angle close to 90$^o$, consistent with previous\npolarization images. The outer disk extends from 13 $\\pm$ 2 to 45 $\\pm$ 9 au,\nwith a position angle and inclination of 137 $\\pm$ 5$^o$ and 44 $\\pm$ 8$^o$.\nThe comparison with previous estimates suggests that the disk inclination could\nincrease with the stellocentric distance, although the different measurements\nare still consistent within the error bars. In addition, no direct signature of\nthe innermost candidate companion is detected from polarimetry, confirming\nrecent results based on intensity imagery. We set an upper limit to its mass\naccretion rate < 10$^{-8}$ M$_{\\odot}$/yr for a sub-stellar mass of\n15M$_{Jup}$.

These modulations depend\ncritically on the source's sky-location. Precise knowledge of the modulations\nare required to coherently track the source's phase over long observations, for\nexample, in pulsar timing, or searches for continuous gravitational waves. The\nmodulations can be modelled as sky-location and time-dependent time delays that\nconvert arrival times at the observer to the inertial frame of the source,\nwhich can often be the Solar system barycentre. We study the use of reduced\norder modelling for speeding up the calculation of this time delay for any\nsky-location. We find that the time delay model can be decomposed into just\nfour basis vectors, and with these the delay for any sky-location can be\nreconstructed to sub-nanosecond accuracy.

For this purpose,\nfor a given EFT, I introduce associated idealized low energy observers who only\nhave access to the energy scale below the UV cut-off scale of the EFT. In the\nframework of EFT, there is a clear difference between the particles lighter\nthan the UV cut-off scale and the particles which are heavier than the UV\ncut-off scale, as the lighter particles can be created below the UV cut-off\nscale while the heavier particles are not.

In\nmodels that include additional non-compact spacetime dimensions, as the\ngravitational waves propagate, they \"leak\" into the extra dimensions, leading\nto a reduction in the amplitude of the observed gravitational waves, and a\ncommensurate systematic error in the inferred distance to the gravitational\nwave source.

Abstract: Coronal plumes are bright magnetic funnels found in quiet regions (QRs) and\ncoronal holes (CHs). They extend high into the solar corona and last from hours\nto days. The heating processes of plumes involve dynamics of the magnetic field\nat their base, but the processes themselves remain mysterious. Recent\nobservations suggest that plume heating is a consequence of magnetic flux\ncancellation and/or convergence at the plume base. These studies suggest that\nthe base flux in plumes is of mixed polarity, either obvious or hidden in SDO\nHMI data, but do not quantify it. To investigate the magnetic origins of plume\nheating, we select ten unipolar network flux concentrations, four in CHs, four\nin QRs, and two that do not form a plume, and track plume luminosity in SDO AIA\n171 A images along with the base flux in SDO HMI magnetograms, over each flux\nconcentrations lifetime.

The disruption radius is hundreds to thousands of the BH's\nSchwarzschild radius, so the circularization of the falling-back debris stream\nis very inefficient due to weak general relativity effects. Due to this and a\nhigh mass fallback rate, the bound debris initially goes through a ~10 yr long\nsuper-Eddington accretion phase.

Similarly to the cloud Sgr B2, another well-known emitter of the\niron line in the GC, the Arches cloud demonstrates temporal decline of the\nX-ray emission. The most natural origin of this emission is irradiation of\nprimary photons of an X-ray flare from a distant source, most likely Sgr A*.\nHowever, recent observations of the Arches cloud discovered variations of\nequivalent width of the 6.4 keV iron line, which indicated that the X-ray\nemission from the cloud is a combination of two components with different\norigin and different equivalent width, one of which is time-variable, while the\nother is stationary during the period of observations. We considered two\ndifferent scenarios: a) this emission is formed by reflection from two clouds,\nwhich are at some distance from each other, when they are irradiated by two\ndifferent flares; and b) the other scenario assumes a combination of X-ray\nfluxes produced in the same cloud by reflection of primary photons and by\nsubrelativistic cosmic rays.

We identify numerous\nconstraints on any such scenario, ultimately concluding that observable effects\non the dynamics of binary inspirals due to such a force are not possible if the\ndark matter is accrued during ordinary stellar evolution. Constraints arise\nfrom the requirement that the astronomical body be able to collect and bind at\nsmall enough radius an adequate number of dark matter particles, from the\nrequirement that the particles thus collected remain bound to neutron stars in\nthe presence of another neutron star, and from the requirement that the theory\nallows old neutron stars to exist and retain their charge.

To constrain our simulations, we specifically\ninvestigate the outermost globular cluster in the M31 system, MGC1. The remote\nlocation of MGC1 favours the idea of it being captured, however, the cluster is\ndevoid of features associated with tidal interactions.

The role of cluster mass in AGN activity Abstract: We present the results of a study of the AGN density in a homogeneous and\nwell-studied sample of 167 bona fide X-ray galaxy clusters ($0.1<z<0.5$) from\nthe XXL Survey. The results can provide evidence of the physical mechanisms\nthat drive AGN and galaxy evolution within clusters. The XXL cluster sample\nmostly comprises poor and moderately rich structures ($M=10^{13} -\n4\\times10^{14} M_{\\rm o}$). Our aim is to statistically study the demographics\nof cluster AGNs as a function of cluster mass and host galaxy position. To\ninvestigate the effect of the environment on AGN activity, we computed the\nfraction of spectroscopically confirmed X-ray AGNs ($L_{\\rm X\n[0.5-10\\,keV]}>10^{42}$ erg cm$^{-1}$) in bright cluster galaxies, up to\n$6r_{500}$ radius. To study the mass dependence and the evolution of the AGN\npopulation, we further divided the sample into low- and high-mass clusters and\ntwo redshift bins (0.1-0.28 and 0.28-0.5). We detect a significant excess of\nX-ray AGNs, at the 95% confidence level, in low-mass clusters between\n$0.5r_{500}$ and 2$r_{500}$, which drops to the field value within the cluster\ncores ($r<0.5r_{500}$). In contrast, high-mass clusters present a decreasing\nAGN fraction towards the cluster centres. The high AGN fraction in the\noutskirts is caused by low-luminosity AGNs. It can be explained by a higher\ngalaxy merging rate in low-mass clusters, where velocity dispersions are not\nhigh enough to prevent galaxy interactions and merging. Ram pressure stripping\nis possible in the cores of all our clusters, but probably stronger in deeper\ngravitational potentials. Compared with previous studies of massive or\nhigh-redshift clusters, we conclude that the AGN fraction in cluster galaxies\nanti-correlates strongly with cluster mass. The AGN fraction also increases\nwith redshift, but at the same rate with the respective fraction in field\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

It has been long suggested that such a wind\nfeedback regulates the final SMBH mass, however, it has been shown recently\nthat AGN winds can also regulate the average accretion rate at a level\nconsistent with observations of high redshift AGNs. In this paper we study the\neffect of wind feedback on the accretion rate using 2D, high resolution\nhydrodynamic simulations, that incorporate a self-consistent wind injection\nscheme and resolves the SMBH sphere of influence. Two different cases are\nexplored and compared: one in which the initial gas density is uniform, and one\nin which it has an isothermal sphere profile.

The median period is 1.28\nd for the full sample and 0.84 d for the probable brown dwarfs.

If the magnetic field\nis strong enough, the energy extracted from the particles can be so large that\nthe particles have negative energy as they fall into the black hole. So\neffectively the energy is extracted from the black hole.\n  The particles inside the ergosphere can be continuously replenished with\naccretion from a disk surrounding the black hole, so a transition region with\nsufficient amount of plasma is formed between the black hole's horizon and the\ninner edge of the disk. Thus the energy can be continuously extracted from the\nblack hole through the transition region. This may be the most efficient way\nfor extracting energy from a Kerr black hole: in principle almost all of the\nrotational energy (up to $\\approx 29%$ of the total energy of the black hole)\ncan be extracted. \n\n"}

Using this supposed universal IMF, the\nuncertainty inherent to any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated,\nby studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution\nof star clusters.

A particularly useful set of complete and\northonormal shapelets is that consisting of weighted Hermite polynomials, which\ncorrespond to perturbations around a circular gaussian. They are also the\neigenstates of the 2-dimensional Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, and thus allow us\nto use the powerful formalism developed for this problem.

Both in early-type and late-type\nSeyferts, the presence of recent star-formation is related to the galaxy\nmorphology in the inner few kiloparsecs, as observed in HST images through the\nfilter F606W by Malkan et al., who has assigned a late ``inner Hubble type'' to\nmost Seyfert 2s with recent nuclear star-formation.

We focus on two\nvariants of the CDM cosmology: an LCDM and a tCDM model. Galaxy formation in\neach is adjusted to reproduce the I-band Tully-Fisher relation of Giovanelli et\nal. (1997). We compare the present-day luminosity functions, colours,\nmorphology and spatial distribution of our simulated galaxies with those of the\nreal local population, in particular with the Updated Zwicky Catalog, with the\nIRAS PSCz redshift survey, and with individual local clusters such as Coma,\nVirgo and Perseus. We also use the simulations to study the clustering bias\nbetween the dark matter and galaxies of differing type. Although some\nsignificant discrepancies remain, our simulations recover the observed\nintrinsic properties and the observed spatial distribution of local galaxies\nreasonably well.

The second one is based on the merging-halo\nformalism of Lacey & Cole (1993), accounting for the fact that massive clusters\naccrete matter quasi-continuously, and is an improvement of a model proposed by\nVoit (2000). The final result is that, in both models, the M-T relation shows a\nbreak at T \\sim 3-4 keV. The behavior of the M-T relation is as usual, M\n\\propto T^{3/2}, at the high mass end, and M \\propto T^{\\gamma}, with a value\nof \\gamma>3/2 depending on the chosen cosmology. The evolution of the M-T\nrelation, for a given M_{\\rm vir}, is more modest both in flat and open\nuniverses in comparison to previous estimate found in literature, even more\nmodest than what found by V2000. Moreover the time evolution is more rapid in\nmodels with L=0 than in models in which the angular momentum acquisition by\nprotostructures is taken into account (L \\neq 0). The effect of a non-zero\ncosmological constant is that of slightly increasing the evolution of the M-T\nrelation with respect to open models with L \\neq 0.

For the 3 epochs\nat which we obtained Chandra/RXTE observations, the 0.5-20 keV energy spectrum\nis consistent with a spectral model consisting of a power-law with interstellar\nabsorption.

Abstract: A fully analytical formulation is developed to make dynamical friction\nmodeling more realistic. The rate for a satellite to decay its orbit in a host\ngalaxy halo is often severely overestimated when applying ChandraSekhar's\nformula without correcting for the tidal loss of the satellite and the\nadiabactic growth of the host galaxy potential over the Hubble time. As a\nsatellite decays to the inner and denser region of the host galaxy, the high\nambient density speeds up their exchange of energy and angular momentum, but\nshrinks the Roche lobe of the satellite by tides. Eventually both processes of\norbital decay and tidal stripping hang up altogether once the satellite is\nlight enough. These competing processes can be modeled analytically for a\nsatellite if we parametrize the massloss history by an empirical formula. We\nalso incorporate the adiabatic contraction of orbits due to growth of the host\npotential well. Observed dwarf galaxies often show a finite density core, which\ndetermines how much inwards its remnants could be delivered to the host galaxy.\nGhost streams or remnant cores or globular clusters of satellites should\npopulate preferentially the outer halo (e.g., the Magellanic stream and the\nUrsa Minor dwarf), rather than the inner halo (e.g., the Sgr stream and the\nOmega-cen cluster).

In\nparticular, we center our attention on mechanisms generating some weak signal,\nof peculiar spectral behaviour, such as resonant scattering in ionic, atomic or\nmolecular lines, thermal SZ effect or extragalactic foreground emissions, whose\ntypical amplitude (denoted by $\\epsilon$) is sufficiently smaller than the\nintrinsic CMB fluctuations. We find that all these effects involve either the\nautocorrelation of anisotropies generated during recombination ($z_{rec}$) or\nthe cross-correlation of those anisotropies with fluctuations arising at some\nlater redshift $z_i$. The degree of this correlation can be computed under the\nassumption that density fluctuations were generated as standard inflationary\nmodels dictate and that they evolved in time according to linear theory. In\ncase that the weak signal is frequency dependent, we show that, by substracting\npower spectra at different frequencies, it is possible to avoid the limit\nassociated to Cosmic Variance and unveil weaker terms linear in $\\epsilon$. We\nfind that the correlation term shows a different spectral dependence than the\nsquared ($\\propto \\epsilon^2$) term considered usually, making its extraction\nparticularly straightforward for the thermal SZ effect.

This large excess implies a\nrelatively large mass ratio of the binary components (M_2/M_1), though it has a\nshort orbital period. The two types of superoutbursts can be explained by the\nthermal-tidal instability model for systems having large mass ratios. Our\nobservations reveal that superhump period derivatives are variable in distinct\nsuperoutbursts. The variation is apparently related to the presence or absence\nof a precursor. We propose that the superhump period derivative depends on the\nmaximum disk radius during outbursts. We investigate the relationship of the\ntype of superoutbursts and the superhump period derivative for known sources.\nIn the case of superoutbursts without a precursor, superhump period derivatives\ntend to be larger than those in precursor-main type superoutbursts, which is\nconsistent with our scenario. \n\n"}

During pre-eruption the object seemed to be\nrelaxing after an initial event which had presumably taken place in last days\nof December 2001. The eruption phase, which lasted till mid-April 2002,\nresulted from a very strong energy burst, which presumably took place in last\ndays of January at the base of the stellar envelope inflated in pre-eruption.\nThe burst produced an energy wave, which was observed as a strong luminosity\nflash in the beginning of February, followed by a strong mass outflow in form\nof two shells, which was observed as an expanding photosphere in later epochs.\nIn mid-April, when the outflow became optically transparent and most of its\nenergy radiated away, the object entered the decline phase during which V838\nMon was evolving along the Hayashi track.

We consider whether a nonradial mode\ncan serve as an explanation for burst oscillations from those NSs which are not\nmagnetic. We find that a surface wave in the shallow burning layer transitions\ninto a crustal interface wave as the envelope cools, a new and previously\nuninvestigated phenomenon. The surface modulations decrease dramatically as the\nmode switches, explaining why burst oscillations often disappear before burst\ncooling ceases. When we include rotational modifications, we find mode\nfrequencies and drifts consistent with those observed. The large NS spin\n($\\approx270-620 {\\rm Hz}$) needed to make this match implies that accreting\nNSs are spinning at frequencies $\\approx4 {\\rm Hz}$ above the burst\noscillation. Since the asymptotic frequency is set by the crustal interface\nwave, the observed late time frequency drifts are a probe of the composition\nand temperature of NS crusts.

This creates the possibility of\nparticle acceleration beyond the knee energy at ~10^15eV. The acceleration\nresults from a nonlinear modification of the flow ahead of the shock supported\nby particles already accelerated to the knee momentum at p ~ p_*. The particles\ngain energy by bouncing off converging magnetic irregularities frozen into the\nflow in the shock precursor and not so much by re-crossing the shock itself.\nThe acceleration rate is thus determined by the gradient of the flow velocity\nand turns out to be formally independent of the particle mean free path\n(m.f.p.). The velocity gradient is, in turn, set by the knee-particles at p ~\np_* as having the dominant contribution to the CR pressure. Since it is\nindependent of the m.f.p., the acceleration rate of particles above the knee\ndoes not decrease with energy, unlike in the linear acceleration regime. The\nreason for the knee formation at p ~ p_* is that particles with $p > p_*$ are\neffectively confined to the shock precursor only while they are within limited\ndomains in the momentum space, while other particles fall into\n``loss-islands'', similar to the ``loss-cone'' of magnetic traps. This\nstructure of the momentum space is due to the character of the scattering\nmagnetic irregularities. They are formed by a train of shock waves that\nnaturally emerge from unstably growing and steepening magnetosonic waves or as\na result of acoustic instability of the CR precursor. These losses steepen the\nspectrum above the knee, which also prevents the shock width from increasing\nwith the maximum particle energy. \n\n"}

The form of the PDF in redshift space is of great\nsignificance as galaxy surveys probe this and not the real space analogue\npredicted using theoretical models.

Decades of experience shows that such\nflows often build equilibria that reverse field directions, evolving to an MHD\nTaylor state, which has remarkable stability properties. We model jets and the\nmagnetic bubbles they build as reversed field pinch equilibria by assuming the\ndriver current to be stiff in the MHD sense. Taking the jet current as rigid\nand a fixed function of position, we prove a theorem: that the same, simple MHD\nstability conditions guarantee stability, even after the jet turns off. This\nmeans that magnetic structures harboring a massive inventory of magnetic energy\ncan persist long after the building jet current has died away. These may be the\nrelic radio \"fossils,\" \"ghost bubbles\" or \"magnetic balloons\" found in\nclusters. These equilibria under magnetic tension will evolve, retaining the\nstability properties from that state. The remaining fossil is not a disordered\nball of magnetic fields, but a stable structure under tension, able to respond\nto the slings and arrows of outside forces. Typically their Alfven speeds\ngreatly exceed the cluster sound speed, and so can keep out hot cluster\nplasmas, leading to x-ray \"ghosts.\" Passing shocks cannot easily destroy them,\nbut can energize and light them up anew at radio frequencies. Bubbles can rise\nin the hot cluster plasma, perhaps detaching from the parent radio galaxy, yet\nstable against Rayleigh-Taylor and other modes. \n\n"}

With the\nadvent of HST surveys that trace bars in the rest-frame optical out to z~1, it\nis critical to provide a reference baseline for bars at z~0 in the optical\nband. We present results on bars at z~0 in the optical and NIR bands based on\n180 spirals from OSUBSGS. (1) The deprojected bar fraction at z~0 is ~60% +/-6%\nin the NIR H-band and ~44% +/-6% in the optical B-band. (2) The results before\nand after deprojection are similar, which is encouraging for high-redshift\nstudies that forego deprojection. (3) Studies of bars at z~0.2-1.0 (lookback\ntime of 3-8 Gyr) have reported an optical bar fraction of ~30% +/-6%, after\napplying cutoffs in absolute magnitude (M_V < -19.3), bar size (a_bar >= 1.5\nkpc), and bar ellipticity (e_bar >= 0.4). Applying these exact cutoffs to the\nOSUBSGS data yields a comparable optical B-band bar fraction at z~0 of ~\n34%+/-6%. This rules out scenarios where the optical bar fraction in bright\ndisks declines strongly with redshift. (4) Most (~70%) bars have moderate to\nhigh strentgh or ellipticity (0.50 <= e_bar <= 0.75). There is no bimodality in\nthe distribution of e_bar. The H-band bar fraction and e_bar show no\nsubstantial variation across RC3 Hubble types Sa to Scd. (5) RC3 bar types\nshould be used with caution. Many galaxies with RC3 types \"AB\" turn out to be\nunbarred and RC3 bar classes \"B\" and \"AB\" have a significant overlap in e_bar.\n(6) Most bars have sizes below 5 kpc.

We remind that\neven the losses attributed to the magneto-dipole radiation of a pulsar in\nvacuum can be written as a result of an Ampere force action of the electric\ncurrens flowing over the neutron star surface (Michel, 1991, Beskin et al.,\n1993). It is this force that is responsible for the transfer of angular\nmomentum of a neutron star to an outgoing magneto-dipole wave. If a pulsar is\nsurrounded by plasma, and there is no longitudinal current in its\nmagnetosphere, there is no energy loss (Beskin et al., 1993, Mestel et al.,\n1999). It is the longitudinal current closing within the pulsar polar cap that\nexerts the retardation torque acting on the neutron star. This torque can be\ndetermined if the structure of longitudinal current is known. Here we remind of\nthe solution by Beskin, Gurevitch & Istomin (1993) and discuss the validity of\nsuch an assumption. The behavior of the recently observed \"part-time job\"\npulsar B1931+24 can be naturally explained within the model of current loss\nwhile the magneto-dipole model faces difficulties. \n\n"}

The current-carrying,\nPoynting flux-dominated magnetic tower jet, which possesses a highly wound\nhelical magnetic field, is subject to the current-driven instability (CDI). We\nfind that, under general physical conditions including small perturbations in\nthe initial background profiles, the propagating magnetic tower jets develop\nthe non-axisymmetric, $m=1$ kink mode of the CDI. The kink mode grows on the\nlocal Alfv\\'en crossing time scale. In addition, two types of kink modes appear\nin the system. At the central region where external thermal pressure\nconfinement is strong, only the internal kink mode is excited and will grow. A\nlarge distance away from the central region where the external thermal pressure\nbecomes low, the external kink mode is observed. As a result, the exterior of\nmagnetic tower jets will be deformed into a large-scale wiggled structure. We\nalso discuss extensively the different physical processes that contribute to\nthe overall stability properties of the magnetic tower jets. Specifically, when\nthe jet propagates in an initially unperturbed background, we find that they\ncan survive the kink mode beyond the point predicted by the well-known\nKruskal-Shafranov (K-S) criterion. The stabilization in this case comes mainly\nfrom the dynamical relaxation of magnetic twists during the propagation of\nmagnetic towers; the magnetic pitch is reduced and the corresponding K-S\ncritical wavelength becomes longer as the tower jet proceeds. Furthermore, we\nshow that the pressure-driven and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities do not occur\nin the magnetic tower jets. \n\n"}

We find that the support provided by magnetic fields\nover thermal pressure alone has several important effects on fragmentation and\nthe formation of binary and multiple systems, and on the properties of massive\ncircumstellar discs. The extra support suppresses the tendency of molecular\ncloud cores to fragment due to either initial density perturbations or disc\nfragmentation. Furthermore, unlike most previous studies, we find that magnetic\npressure plays the dominant role in inhibiting fragmentation rather than\nmagnetic tension or magnetic braking. In particular, we find that if the\nmagnetic field is aligned with the rotation axis of the molecular cloud core,\nthe effects of the magnetic field on fragmentation and disc structure are\nalmost entirely due to magnetic pressure, while if the rotation axis is\ninitially perpendicular to the magnetic field, magnetic tension plays a greater\nrole and can actually aid fragmentation.

It has been argued that such models\nmay require early reionization to suppress small-scale anisotropies in order to\nbe consistent with experimental data. We find that if the cosmological constant\nlambda=0, the extent of this suppression is quite insensitive to Omega_0. Given\na sigma_8-normalization today, the loss of small-scale power associated with a\nlower Omega_0 is partially canceled by higher optical depth from longer\nlookback times and by structures forming at higher redshifts before the\nuniverse becomes curvature-dominated.

These moving groups are\nresponsible for the vertex deviation measured even for samples of late-type\nstars; they appear more frequently for ever redder samples; and as a whole they\nfollow an asymmetric-drift relation, in the sense that those only present in\nred samples predominantly have large |v_R| and lag in v_phi w.r.t. the local\nstandard of rest (LSR). The question arise, how these old moving groups got on\ntheir eccentric orbits. A plausible mechanism, known from solar system\ndynamics, which is able to manage a shift in orbit space involves locking into\nan orbital resonance.\n  Apart from these moving groups, there is a smooth background distribution,\nakin to Schwarzschild's ellipsoidal model, with axis ratio of about 1:0.6:0.35\nin v_R, v_phi, and v_z.

We reported the detection of 110 Lya\nabsorbers at significance level >3 sigma in the redshift range z=0.002-0.069,\nover a total pathlength of 116,000 km/s. In this second paper, we evaluate the\nphysical properties of these Lya absorbers and compare them to their high-z\ncounterparts. The distribution of Doppler parameters is similar to that at high\nredshift, with mean b = 35.0 +- 16.6 km/s. The true Doppler parameter may be\nsomewhat lower, owing to component blends and non-thermal velocities. The\ndistribution of equivalent widths exhibits a significant break at W~133mA, with\nan increasing number of weak absorbers (10mA-100mA).

For the late-decaying leptonic Q-balls with lifetime of about 10^6\ns, we find that their decay product, gravitino, can serve as a dark matter\ncandidate without overclosing the universe and, at the same time, can give an\nexplanation of the approximate equality of dark and baryon matter densities. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-ph/0509062", "contents": "Title: Primordial black holes from cosmic necklaces Abstract: Cosmic necklaces are hybrid topological defects consisting of monopoles and\nstrings. We argue that primordial black holes(PBHs) may have formed from loops\nof the necklaces, if there exist stable winding states, such as coils and\ncycloops. Unlike the standard scenario of PBH formation from string loops, in\nwhich the kinetic energy plays important role when strings collapse into black\nholes, the PBH formation may occur in our scenario after necklaces have\ndissipated their kinetic energy. Then, the significant difference appears in\nthe production ratio. In the standard scenario, the production ratio $f$\nbecomes a tiny fraction $f\\sim 10^{-20}$, however it becomes $f \\sim 1$ in our\ncase. On the other hand, the typical mass of the PBHs is much smaller than the\nstandard scenario, if they are produced in the same epoch. As the two\nmechanisms may work at the same time, the necklaces may have more than one\nchannel of the gravitational collapse. Although the result obtained in this\npaper depends on the evolution of the dimensionless parameter $r$, the\nexistence of the winding state could be a serious problem in some cases. Since\nthe existence of the winding state in brane models is due to the existence of a\nnon-tivial circle in the compactified space, the PBH formation can be used to\nprobe the structure of the compactified space. Black holes produced by this\nmechanism may have peculiar properties. \n\n"}

A trilinear interaction term allows for the complete\ndecay of the massive inflaton particles, which is necessary for the transition\nto radiation domination. We found that typically the trilinear term is\nsubdominant during early stages of preheating, but it actually amplifies\nparametric resonance driven by the four-legs interaction. In cases where the\ntrilinear term does dominate during preheating, the process occurs through\nperiodic tachyonic amplifications with resonance effects, which is so effective\nthat preheating completes within a few inflaton oscillations. We develop an\nanalytic theory of this process, which we call tachyonic resonance. We also\nstudy numerically the influence of trilinear interactions on the dynamics after\npreheating. The trilinear term eventually comes to dominate after preheating,\nleading to faster rescattering and thermalization than could occur without it.\nFinally, we investigate the role of non-renormalizable interaction terms during\npreheating. We find that if they are present they generally dominate (while\nstill in a controllable regime) in chaotic inflation models. Preheating due to\nthese terms proceeds through a modified form of tachyonic resonance. \n\n"}

After a brief restatement of\nthe cosmological constant problem, a short summary of the proposed mechanism is\ngiven. The emphasis is on the perspective of the low-energy effective theory in\norder to see how it addresses the problem of why low-energy particles like the\nelectron do not contribute too large a vacuum energy. This is followed by a\ndiscussion of the main objections, which are grouped into the following five\ntopics:\n  (1) Weinberg's No-Go Theorem.\n  (2) Are hidden tunings of the theory required, and a problem?\n  (3) Why should the mechanism not rule out earlier epochs of inflation?\n  (4) How big are quantum effects, and which are the most dangerous?\n  (5) Can the mechanism be consistent with cosmological constraints?\n  It is argued that there are plausible reasons why the mechanism can thread\nthe potential objections, but that a definitive proof that it does depends on\naddressing well-defined technical points. These points include identifying what\nfixes the size of the extra dimensions, checking how topological obstructions\nrenormalize and performing specific calculations of quantum corrections.
