We therefore propose a (restricted) logical\ntheory over relations as a language for specifying such notions. Our\nspecification logic is further characterized by an ability to explicitly treat\nbinding in object languages. Once such a logic is fixed, a natural next\nquestion is how we might prove theorems about specifications written in it. We\npropose to use a second logic, called a reasoning logic, for this purpose. A\nsatisfactory reasoning logic should be able to completely encode the\nspecification logic. Associated with the specification logic are various\nnotions of binding: for quantifiers within formulas, for eigenvariables within\nsequents, and for abstractions within terms. To provide a natural treatment of\nthese aspects, the reasoning logic must encode binding structures as well as\ntheir associated notions of scope, free and bound variables, and\ncapture-avoiding substitution.

The crucial\nconstruction is of a weak equivalence of operads between the Boardman-Vogt\nW-construction for an operad P, and the cobar-bar construction on P.

Their proof can be\nturned into an approximation algorithm with worse than exponential complexity.\nIn 2000, Baier, Haverkort, Hermanns and Katoen presented an efficient\npolynomial-time approximation algorithm for the sublogic in which only binary\nuntil is allowed. In this paper, we propose such an efficient polynomial-time\napproximation algorithm for full CSL. The key to our method is the notion of\nstratified CTMCs with respect to the CSL property to be checked. On a\nstratified CTMC, the probability to satisfy a CSL path formula can be\napproximated by a transient analysis in polynomial time (using uniformization).\nWe present a measure-preserving, linear-time and -space transformation of any\nCTMC into an equivalent, stratified one. This makes the present work the\ncenterpiece of a broadly applicable full CSL model checker.

Several cooling algorithms were\nsuggested in recent years, including practicable algorithmic cooling (PAC) and\nexhaustive AC. Practicable algorithms have simple implementations, yet their\nlevel of cooling is far from optimal; Exhaustive algorithms, on the other hand,\ncool much better, and some even reach (asymptotically) an optimal level of\ncooling, but they are not practicable.

Some temporal logics,\nsuch as CTL, are branching: they allow to express facts about the whole\ncomputation tree of the model, rather than on each single linear computation.\nThis branching aspect is even more critical when dealing with multi-modal\nlogics, i.e. logics expressing facts about systems with several transition\nrelations. A prominent example is CTLK, a logic that reasons about temporal and\nepistemic properties of multi-agent systems. In general, model checkers produce\nlinear counter-examples for failed properties, composed of a single computation\npath of the model. But some branching properties are only poorly and partially\nexplained by a linear counter-example.\n  This paper proposes richer counter-example structures called tree-like\nannotated counter-examples (TLACEs), for properties in Action-Restricted CTL\n(ARCTL), an extension of CTL quantifying paths restricted in terms of actions\nlabeling transitions of the model. These counter-examples have a branching\nstructure that supports more complete description of property violations.\nElements of these counter-examples are annotated with parts of the property to\ngive a better understanding of their structure.

What is a \"typical\" structure of a simply typable term?\nDespite their ostensible simplicity, these questions still remain unanswered,\nwhereas solutions to such problems are essential for testing compilers and\noptimizing programs whose expected efficiency depends on the size of terms. Our\napproach toward the afore-mentioned problems may be later extended to any\nlanguage with bound variables, i.e., with scopes and declarations. This paper\npresents two complementary approaches: one, theoretical, uses complex analysis\nand generating functions, the other, experimental, is based on a generator of\nlambda-terms. Thanks to de Bruijn indices, we provide three families of\nformulas for the number of closed lambda terms of a given size and we give four\nrelations between these numbers which have interesting combinatorial\ninterpretations.

Localizing an\narbitrary triangulated $C$ by a set $S$ of morphisms in the heart of a weight\nstructure $w$ for it one obtains a triangulated category endowed with a weight\nstructure $w'$. The heart of $w'$ is a certain idempotent completion of the\nnon-commutative localization of the heart of $w$ by $S$. The latter is the\nnatural categorical version of Cohn's localizations of rings i.e. the functor\nconnecting hearts is universal among all the additive functors that make the\nelements of $S$ invertible.

The duality between monads and\ncomonads corresponds, in general, to a symmetry between construction and\nobservation, for instance between raising an exception and looking up a state.\nThanks to the properties of adjunction one may go one step further: the\ncoKleisli-on-Kleisli category of a monad provides a kind of observation with\nrespect to a given construction, while dually the Kleisli-on-coKleisli category\nof a comonad provides a kind of construction with respect to a given\nobservation. In the previous examples this gives rise to catching an exception\nand updating a state. However, the interpretation of computational effects is\nusually based on a category which is not self-dual, like the category of sets.\nThis leads to a breaking of the monad-comonad duality.

From the proof theory perspective, the challenge is met by laying\ndown new calculi that eliminate ``bureaucracy''; techniques such as\nnormalization and cut-elimination, as well as proof compression, are employed.\nIn this note a new perspective on the proof identity problem is outlined.

A crossroad between games and\n  MDPs Abstract: When reasoning about the strategic capabilities of an agent, it is important\nto consider the nature of its adversaries. In the particular context of\ncontroller synthesis for quantitative specifications, the usual problem is to\ndevise a strategy for a reactive system which yields some desired performance,\ntaking into account the possible impact of the environment of the system. There\nare at least two ways to look at this environment. In the classical analysis of\ntwo-player quantitative games, the environment is purely antagonistic and the\nproblem is to provide strict performance guarantees. In Markov decision\nprocesses, the environment is seen as purely stochastic: the aim is then to\noptimize the expected payoff, with no guarantee on individual outcomes.\n  In this expository work, we report on recent results introducing the beyond\nworst-case synthesis problem, which is to construct strategies that guarantee\nsome quantitative requirement in the worst-case while providing an higher\nexpected value against a particular stochastic model of the environment given\nas input. This problem is relevant to produce system controllers that provide\nnice expected performance in the everyday situation while ensuring a strict\n(but relaxed) performance threshold even in the event of very bad (while\nunlikely) circumstances.

This involves ideas from quantale theory and from semigroup\ntheory, specifically Ehresmann semigroups, restriction semigroups and inverse\nsemigroups. We establish a duality between the category of complete restriction\nmonoids and the category of \\'etale localic categories. The relationship\nbetween monoids and categories is mediated by a class of quantales called\nrestriction quantal frames. This result builds on the work of Pedro Resende on\nthe connection between pseudogroups and \\'etale localic groupoids but in the\nprocess we both generalize and simplify: for example, we do not require\ninvolutions and, in addition, we render his result functorial. We also project\ndown to topological spaces and, as a result, extend the classical adjunction\nbetween locales and topological spaces to an adjunction between \\'etale localic\ncategories and \\'etale topological categories.

Consequently, we deduce several dualities between\ndistributive restriction semigroups and spectral \\'etale topological\ncategories.

However, more complex and challenging objectives\nrelated to the verification of and the controller synthesis for logic\nspecifications have not been formally investigated for this class of systems as\nof yet. With logic specifications we mean properties expressed as formulae in\nlinear temporal logic or as automata on infinite strings. This paper addresses\nthese complex objectives by constructively deriving approximately equivalent\n(bisimilar) symbolic models of stochastic switched systems. More precisely,\nthis paper provides two different symbolic abstraction techniques: one requires\nstate space discretization, but the other one does not require any space\ndiscretization which can be potentially more efficient than the first one when\ndealing with higher dimensional stochastic switched systems. Both techniques\nprovide finite symbolic models that are approximately bisimilar to stochastic\nswitched systems under some stability assumptions on the concrete model. This\nallows formally synthesizing controllers (switching signals) that are valid for\nthe concrete system over the finite symbolic model, by means of mature\nautomata-theoretic techniques in the literature. The effectiveness of the\nresults are illustrated by synthesizing switching signals enforcing logic\nspecifications for two case studies including temperature control of a six-room\nbuilding. \n\n"}

The\nmain problem with identity types, as originally formulated, is that they are\ncomplex to understand and use. Using that fact as motivation, a much simpler\nformulation for the identity type was proposed by Queiroz & Gabbay (1994) and\nfurther developed by de Queiroz & de Oliveira (2013). In this formulation, an\nelement of an identity type is seen as a sequence of rewrites (or computational\npaths).

This idea is pushed further in the second part of this\ndissertation, and connected to realisability semantics, where the structured\ndata is interpreted algebraically, and the consumption of such data is modelled\nwith the use of an orthogonality relation.

The theorems that we include in our case study are the low basis\ntheorem of Jockusch and Soare, the Kleene-Post theorem, and Friedberg's jump\ninversion theorem. It turns out that all the aforementioned properties and many\ntheorems in computability theory, including all theorems that claim the\nexistence of some Turing degree, have very little uniform computational\ncontent: they are located outside of the upper cone of binary choice (also\nknown as LLPO); we call problems with this property indiscriminative.

The operation\nscheduling, placement, and qubit routing problems tackled by the quantum\nphysical mapper are highly dependent on one another. More precisely, the\nscheduling solution affects the quality of the achievable placement solution\ndue to resource pressures that may be created as a result of operation\nscheduling whereas the operation placement and qubit routing solutions\ninfluence the scheduling solution due to resulting distances between\npredecessor and current operations, which in turn determines routing latencies.\nThe proposed flow for the quantum physical mapper captures these dependencies\nby applying (i) a loose scheduling step, which transforms an initial quantum\ndata flow graph into one that explicitly captures the no-cloning theorem of the\nquantum computing and then performs instruction scheduling based on a modified\nforce-directed scheduling approach to minimize the resource contention and\nquantum circuit latency, (ii) a placement step, which uses timing-driven\ninstruction placement to minimize the approximate routing latencies while\nmaking iterative calls to the aforesaid force-directed scheduler to correct\nscheduling levels of quantum operations as needed, and (iii) a routing step\nthat finds dynamic values of routing latencies for the qubits.

The predictions of this first model have outperformed\nthat of other models in mainstream empirical language processing tasks on large\nscale data. Moreover, just like CQM allows for varying the model in which we\ninterpret quantum axioms, one can also vary the model in which we interpret\nword meaning.\n  In this paper we show that further developments in categorical quantum\nmechanics are relevant to natural language processing too.

This technique is graph-based and constructs a Lyapunov\nfunction for hybrid systems having a complex discrete state space. The\ntechnique consists of (1) decomposing the underlying graph of the hybrid system\ninto subgraphs, (2) computing multiple local Lyapunov functions for the\nsubgraphs, and finally (3) composing the local Lyapunov functions into a\npiecewise Lyapunov function.

Refraining from assuming space-time as given a priori has\na number of consequences. First, the usual definitions of randomness depend on\na causal structure and turn meaningless. So motivated, we propose an intrinsic,\nphysically motivated measure for the randomness of a string of bits: its length\nminus its normalized work value, a quantity we closely relate to its Kolmogorov\ncomplexity (the length of the shortest program making a universal Turing\nmachine output this string). We test this alternative concept of randomness for\nthe example of non-local correlations, and we end up with a reasoning that\nleads to similar conclusions as in, but is conceptually more direct than, the\nprobabilistic view since only the outcomes of measurements that can actually\nall be carried out together are put into relation to each other.

{"id": "1609.05382", "contents": "Title: The Algebra of Open and Interconnected Systems Abstract: Herein we develop category-theoretic tools for understanding network-style\ndiagrammatic languages. The archetypal network-style diagrammatic language is\nthat of electric circuits; other examples include signal flow graphs, Markov\nprocesses, automata, Petri nets, chemical reaction networks, and so on. The key\nfeature is that the language is comprised of a number of components with\nmultiple (input/output) terminals, each possibly labelled with some type, that\nmay then be connected together along these terminals to form a larger network.\nThe components form hyperedges between labelled vertices, and so a diagram in\nthis language forms a hypergraph. We formalise the compositional structure by\nintroducing the notion of a hypergraph category. Network-style diagrammatic\nlanguages and their semantics thus form hypergraph categories, and semantic\ninterpretation gives a hypergraph functor.\n  The first part of this thesis develops the theory of hypergraph categories.\nIn particular, we introduce the tools of decorated cospans and corelations.\nDecorated cospans allow straightforward construction of hypergraph categories\nfrom diagrammatic languages: the inputs, outputs, and their composition are\nmodelled by the cospans, while the 'decorations' specify the components\nthemselves. Not all hypergraph categories can be constructed, however, through\ndecorated cospans. Decorated corelations are a more powerful version that\npermits construction of all hypergraph categories and hypergraph functors.\nThese are often useful for constructing the semantic categories of diagrammatic\nlanguages and functors from diagrams to the semantics. To illustrate these\nprinciples, the second part of this thesis details applications to linear\ntime-invariant dynamical systems and passive linear networks. \n\n"}

However, if we simply add the univalence axiom to type theory,\nthen we lose the property of canonicity - that every closed term computes to a\ncanonical form. A computation becomes `stuck' when it reaches the point that it\nneeds to evaluate a proof term that is an application of the univalence axiom.\nSo we wish to find a way to compute with the univalence axiom. While this\nproblem has been solved with the formulation of cubical type theory, where the\ncomputations are expressed using a nominal extension of lambda-calculus, it may\nbe interesting to explore alternative solutions, which do not require such an\nextension.\n  As a first step, we present here a system of propositional higher-order\nminimal logic (PHOML). There are three kinds of typing judgement in PHOML.\nThere are terms which inhabit types, which are the simple types over $\\Omega$.\nThere are proofs which inhabit propositions, which are the terms of type\n$\\Omega$. The canonical propositions are those constructed from $\\bot$ by\nimplication $\\supset$. Thirdly, there are paths which inhabit equations $M =_A\nN$, where $M$ and $N$ are terms of type $A$. There are two ways to prove an\nequality: reflexivity, and propositional extensionality - logically equivalent\npropositions are equal. This system allows for some definitional equalities\nthat are not present in cubical type theory, namely that transport along the\ntrivial path is identity.\n  We present a call-by-name reduction relation for this system, and prove that\nthe system satisfies canonicity: every closed typable term head-reduces to a\ncanonical form.

Control processes are also described by controllability and\nobservability---whether the input can drive the process to any state, and\nwhether any state can be determined from later outputs. For any field k we give\na presentation of FinRel_k in terms of generators of the free PROP of\nsignal-flow diagrams together with the equations that give FinRel_k its\nstructure.

Tracing errors in higher levels of concatenation shows that, in most\ncases, after 1 or 2 levels of concatenation, the number of QECC blocks required\nbecome static. However, since the gate count increases with increasing\nconcatenation, the percentage saving in gate count is considerably high. \n\n"}

To an acyclic partial matching $\\mu$ on a finite regular CW complex\n$X$, Forman introduced a discrete analogue of gradient flows. Although Forman's\ngradient flow has been proved to be useful in practical computations of\nhomology groups, it is not sufficient to recover the homotopy type of $X$.\nForman also proved the existence of a CW complex which is homotopy equivalent\nto $X$ and whose cells are in one-to-one correspondence with the critical cells\nof $\\mu$, but the construction is ad hoc and does not have a combinatorial\ndescription. By relaxing the definition of Forman's gradient flows, we\nintroduce the notion of flow paths, which contains enough information to\nreconstruct the homotopy type of $X$, while retaining a combinatorial\ndescription. The critical difference from Forman's gradient flows is the\nexistence of a partial order on the set of flow paths, from which a\n$2$-category $C(\\mu)$ is constructed. It is shown that the classifying space of\n$C(\\mu)$ is homotopy equivalent to $X$ by using homotopy theory of\n$2$-categories.

The needed computations are organized as measurement\npatterns, or simply patterns, in the 1WQC model. The entanglement operations in\na pattern can be shown by a graph which together with the set of its input and\noutput qubits is called the geometry of the pattern. Since a one-way quantum\ncomputation pattern is based on quantum measurements, which are fundamentally\nnondeterministic evolutions, there must be conditions over geometries to\nguarantee determinism. Causal flow is a sufficient and generalized flow (gflow)\nis a necessary and sufficient condition over geometries to identify a\ndependency structure for the measurement sequences in order to achieve\ndeterminism. Previously, three optimization methods have been proposed to\nsimplify 1WQC patterns which are called standardization, signal shifting and\nPauli simplification.

Different methods are then used to map each\nsingle-target gate into Clifford+$T$ gates, while aiming at optimally using\navailable resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in\nautomatically synthesizing IEEE compliant floating point networks up to double\nprecision. As many quantum algorithms target scientific simulation\napplications, they can make rich use of floating point arithmetic components.\nBut due to the lack of quantum circuit descriptions for those components, it\ncan be difficult to find a realistic cost estimation for the algorithms. Our\nsynthesized benchmarks provide cost estimates that allow quantum algorithm\ndesigners to provide the first complete cost estimates for a host of quantum\nalgorithms. Thus, the benchmarks and, more generally, the LHRS framework are an\nessential step towards the goal of understanding which quantum algorithms will\nbe practical in the first generations of quantum computers. \n\n"}

An\nefficient quantum circuit saves quantum hardware resources by reducing the\nnumber of T gates without substantially increasing the number of qubits.\nRecently, the design of a quantum multiplier is presented by Babu [1] which\nimproves the existing works in terms of number of quantum gates, number of\nqubits, and delay.

In this contribution to the focus collection on \"What would\nyou do with 1000 qubits?\", we provide concrete examples of intractable ML tasks\nthat could be enhanced with near-term devices.

{"id": "1709.04301", "contents": "Title: Quantum error correction for non-maximally entangled states Abstract: Quantum states have high affinity for errors and hence error correction is of\nutmost importance to realise a quantum computer. Laflamme showed that 5 qubits\nare necessary to correct a single error on a qubit. In a Pauli error model,\nfour different types of errors can occur on a qubit. Maximally entangled states\nare orthogonal to each other and hence can be uniquely distinguished by a\nmeasurement in the Bell basis. Thus a measurement in Bell basis and a unitary\ntransformation is sufficient to correct error in Bell states. However, such a\nmeasurement is not possible for non-maximally entangled states. In this work we\nshow that the 16 possible errors for a non-maximally entangled two qubit system\nmap to only 8 distinct error states. Hence, it is possible to correct the error\nwithout perfect knowledge of the type of error. Furthermore, we show that the\npossible errors can be grouped in such a way that all 4 errors can occur on one\nqubit, whereas only bit flip error can occur on the second qubit. As a\nconsequence, instead of 10, only 8 qubits are sufficient to correct a single\nerror. We propose an 8-qubit error correcting code to correct a single error in\na non-maximally entangled state. We further argue that for an $n$-qubit\nnon-maximally entangled state of the form $a|0>^{n} + b|1>^{n}$, it is always\npossible to correct a single error with fewer than $5n$ qubits, in fact only\n$3n+2$ qubits suffice. \n\n"}

However, checking invariants of such protocols is undecidable and\nhard in practice, as it requires reasoning about an unbounded number of nodes\nand messages.

The proposed designs are primarily optimized for the number of\nancilla inputs and the number of garbage outputs and are designed for possible\nbest values for the quantum cost and delay. First, we propose two new designs\nfor the reversible ripple carry adder: (i) one with no input carry $c_0$ and no\nancilla input bits, and (ii) one with input carry $c_0$ and no ancilla input\nbits. The proposed reversible ripple carry adder designs with no ancilla input\nbits have less quantum cost and logic depth (delay) compared to their existing\ncounterparts in the literature. In these designs, the quantum cost and delay\nare reduced by deriving designs based on the reversible Peres gate and the TR\ngate. Next, four new designs for the reversible BCD adder are presented based\non the following two approaches: (i) the addition is performed in binary mode\nand correction is applied to convert to BCD when required through detection and\ncorrection, and (ii) the addition is performed in binary mode and the result is\nalways converted using a binary to BCD converter. The proposed reversible\nbinary and BCD adders can be applied in a wide variety of digital signal\nprocessing applications and constitute important design components of\nreversible computing. \n\n"}

We present a novel approach\nfor proving equivalence between imperative and MapReduce algorithms based on\npartitioning the equivalence proof into a sequence of equivalence proofs\nbetween intermediate programs with smaller differences.

In this work, we are changing the measure to the fair measure\n[Lin&Sahni: Fair edge deletion problems. IEEE Trans. Comput. 89]. The measure\nis k if the number of solution neighbors does not exceed k for any vertex in\nthe graph. One possible way to study graph problems is by defining the property\nin a certain logic. For a given objective an evaluation problem is to find a\nset (of vertices) that simultaneously minimizes the assumed measure and\nsatisfies an appropriate formula.\n  In the presented paper we show that there is an FPT algorithm for the MSO\nFair Vertex Evaluation problem for formulas with one free variable\nparameterized by the twin cover number of the input graph.

Currently,\nprogramming and reasoning about coinductive types is difficult for two reasons:\nThe need for recursive definitions to be productive, and the lack of\ncoincidence of the built-in identity types and the important notion of\nbisimilarity.\n  Guarded recursion in the sense of Nakano has recently been suggested as a\npossible approach to dealing with the problem of productivity, allowing this to\nbe encoded in types. Indeed, coinductive types can be encoded using a\ncombination of guarded recursion and universal quantification over clocks. This\npaper studies the notion of bisimilarity for guarded recursive types in Ticked\nCubical Type Theory, an extension of Cubical Type Theory with guarded\nrecursion. We prove that, for any functor, an abstract, category theoretic\nnotion of bisimilarity for the final guarded coalgebra is equivalent (in the\nsense of homotopy type theory) to path equality (the primitive notion of\nequality in cubical type theory). As a worked example we study a guarded notion\nof labelled transition systems, and show that, as a special case of the general\ntheorem, path equality coincides with an adaptation of the usual notion of\nbisimulation for processes.

Above the quantum supremacy threshold (approx. 60\nqubits), NISQ machines are expected to be more powerful than existing classical\ncomputers. One of the most stringent problems is that computations (expressed\nas quantum circuits) have to be adapted (compiled) to the NISQ hardware,\nbecause the hardware does not support arbitrary interactions between the\nqubits. This procedure introduces additional gates (e.g. SWAP gates) into the\ncircuits while leaving the implemented computations unchanged. Each additional\ngate increases the failure rate of the adapted (compiled) circuits, because the\nhardware and the circuits are not fault-tolerant. It is reasonable to expect\nthat the placement influences the number of additionally introduced gates.\nTherefore, a combinatorial problem arises: how are circuit qubits allocated\n(placed) initially to the hardware qubits?

Our\ndefinitions are based on a connection of higher categories to \"directed\nspaces\". Directed spaces are locally modelled on manifold diagrams, which are\nstratifications of the n-cube such that strata are transversal to the flag\nfoliation of the n-cube. The first part of this thesis develops a combinatorial\nmodel for manifold diagrams called singular n-cubes. In the second part we\napply this model to build our notions of higher categories.\n  Singular n-cubes are \"directed triangulations\" of space together with a\ndecomposition into a collection of subspaces or strata. Singular n-cubes can be\nnaturally organised into two categories. The first, whose morphisms are bundles\nthemselves, is used for the inductive definition of singular (n+1)-cubes. The\nsecond, whose morphisms are \"open\" base changes, admits an (epi,mono)\nfactorisation system. Monomorphisms will be called embeddings of cubes.\nEpimorphisms will be called collapses and describe how triangulations can be\ncoarsened. Each cube has a unique coarsest triangulation called its normal\nform. The existence of normal forms makes the equality relation of\n(combinatorially represented) manifold diagrams decidable.\n  As the main application of the resulting combinatorial framework for manifold\ndiagrams, we give algebraic definitions of various notions of higher\ncategories. Namely, we define associative n-categories, presented associative\nn-categories and presented associative n-groupoids.

In addition to mapping quantum gates into the supported gate\nset, it is necessary to map pseudo qubits in the technology-independent circuit\ninto physical qubits of the technology-dependent circuit such that coupling\nconstraints among qubits acting in multiple-qubit gates are satisfied. It is\nusually not possible to find such a mapping without adding SWAP gates into the\ncircuit.

Since a 2D topological quantum field\ntheory is equivalent to a commutative Frobenius algebra, this result also shows\nthat every 2D TQFT is obtained from an ambijunction in some 2-category.

The special\nstructure of the recursion formula being the core of this algorithm makes it a\ngood starting point to obtain systematically fast Fourier transforms for\nsolvable groups on a quantum computer. The inherent structure of the Hilbert\nspace imposed by the qubit architecture suggests to consider groups of order\n2^n first (where n is the number of qubits). As an example, fast quantum\nFourier transforms for all 4 classes of non-abelian 2-groups with cyclic normal\nsubgroup of index 2 are explicitly constructed in terms of quantum circuits.\nThe (quantum) complexity of the Fourier transform for these groups of size 2^n\nis O(n^2) in all cases. \n\n"}
