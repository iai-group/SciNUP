If correct, this\nimplies that mass generation mechanisms and physics in excited hadrons is very\ndifferent as compared to the lowest states. One needs an alternative and\nindependent experimental information to confirm this conjecture. Using very\ngeneral chiral symmetry arguments it is shown that strict chiral restoration in\na given excited nucleon forbids its decay into the N \\pi channel.

However, those baryons which have no chiral\npartner must decay strongly with a decay constant comparable with f_{NN\\pi}.\nDecay constants can be extracted from the existing decay widths and branching\nratios.

These currents can be called chiral partners at the\nfundamental level. In a world where chiral symmetry was not broken, the\ncorresponding current-current correlators would show the same spectral\ninformation. In the real world chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. A\nprominent peak -- the rho-meson -- shows up in the vector spectrum (measured in\n(e^+ e^-)-collisions and tau-decays). On the other hand, in the axial-vector\nspectrum a broad bump appears -- the a_1-meson (also accessible in tau-decays).\nIt is tempting to call rho and a_1 chiral partners at the hadronic level.\nStrong indications are brought forward that these ``chiral partners'' do not\nonly differ in mass but even in their nature: The rho-meson appears dominantly\nas a quark-antiquark state with small modifications from an attractive\npion-pion interaction. The a_1-meson, on the other hand, can be understood as a\nmeson-molecule state mainly formed by the attractive interaction between pion\nand rho-meson. A key issue here is that the meson-meson interactions are fixed\nby chiral symmetry breaking. It is demonstrated that one can understand the\nvector and the axial-vector spectrum very well within this interpretation. It\nis also shown that the opposite cases, namely rho as a pion-pion molecule or\na_1 as a quark-antiquark state lead to less satisfying results.

{"id": "0903.3994", "contents": "Title: Possible Resonances in the 12C + 12C Fusion Rate and Superburst Ignition Abstract: Observationally inferred superburst ignition depths are shallower than models\npredict. We address this discrepancy by reexamining the superburst trigger\nmechanism. We first explore the hypothesis of Kuulkers et al. that exothermic\nelectron captures trigger superbursts. We find that all electron capture\nreactions are thermally stable in accreting neutron star oceans and thus are\nnot a viable trigger mechanism. Fusion reactions other than 12C + 12C are\ninfeasible as well since the possible reactants either deplete at much\nshallower depths or have prohibitively large Coulomb barriers. Thus we confirm\nthe proposal of Cumming & Bildsten and Strohmayer & Brown that 12C + 12C\ntriggers superbursts. We then examine the 12C + 12C fusion rate. The reaction\ncross-section is experimentally unknown at astrophysically relevant energies,\nbut resonances exist in the 12C + 12C system throughout the entire measured\nenergy range. Thus it is likely, and in fact has been predicted, that a\nresonance exists near the Gamow peak energy ~ 1.5 MeV. For such a hypothetical\n1.5 MeV resonance, we derive both a fiducial value and upper limit to the\nresonance strength and find that such a resonance could decrease the\ntheoretically predicted superburst ignition depth by up to a factor of 4; in\nthis case, observationally inferred superburst ignition depths would accord\nwith model predictions for a range of plausible neutron star parameters. Said\ndifferently, such a resonance would decrease the temperature required for\nunstable 12C ignition at a column depth 10^12 g/cm^2 from 6 x 10^8 K to 5 x\n10^8 K. Determining the existence of a strong resonance in the Gamow window\nrequires measurements of the 12C + 12C cross-section down to a center-of-mass\nenergy near 1.5 MeV, which is within reach of the proposed DUSEL facility. \n\n"}

In this work, we apply the improved formulation of\nthe DME proposed recently in arXiv:0910.4979 by Gebremariam {\\it et al.} to the\nnon-local Fock energy obtained from chiral effective field theory (EFT)\ntwo-nucleon (NN) interactions at next-to-next-to-leading-order (N$^2$LO).

Our\napproach is based on the following observations. First, unlike the production\ncross sections, the ratio $R(x,Q^2)=F_L/F_T$ and the azimuthal $\\cos(2\\phi)$\nasymmetry in heavy-quark leptoproduction are sufficiently stable, both\nparametricallly and perturbatively, in a wide region of variables $x$ and $Q^2$\nwithin the fixed-flavor-number scheme of QCD. Second, both these quantities,\n$R(x,Q^2)=F_L/F_T$ and $\\cos(2\\phi)$ asymmetry, are sensitive to resummation of\nthe mass logarithms of the type $\\alpha_{s}\\ln\\left(Q^{2}/m^{2}\\right)$ within\nthe variable-flavor-number schemes.

In the present calculation, we consider\nnot only the tensor coupling of vector mesons to octet baryons and the form\nfactors at interaction vertexes but also the internal (quark) structure change\nof baryons in dense matter. The relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations are\nperformed in two ways: one is the calculation with the coupling constants\ndetermined by SU(6) (quark model) symmetry, the other is with the coupling\nconstants based on SU(3) (flavor) symmetry. For the latter case, we use the\nlatest Nijmegen (ESC08) model. Then, it is very remarkable that the particle\ncomposition of the core matter in SU(3) symmetry is completely different from\nthat in SU(6) symmetry. In SU(6) symmetry, all octet baryons appear in the\ndensity region below $\\sim 1.2$ fm$^{-3}$, while, in the ESC08 model, only the\n\\Xi^- hyperon is produced. Furthermore, the medium modification of the internal\nbaryon structure hardens the equation of state for the core matter.

To\ntake the pulsar mass ranging from $1.0M_{\\odot}$ to $2.0M_{\\odot}$, we\ncalculate the central density, the core/crust radii, the core/crust mass, the\ncore/crustal thickness, the moment of inertia, and the crustal moment of\ninertia. Among them, the crustal moment of inertia could be effectively\nconstrained from the accumulated glitch observations, which has been a great\ndebate recently, known as \"glitch crisis\". Namely, superfluid neutrons\ncontained in the inner crust, which are regarded as the origin of the glitch in\nthe standard two-component model, could be largely entrained in the nuclei\nlattices, then there may not be enough superfluid neutrons ($\\sim 4/5$ less\nthan the previous value) to trigger the large glitches ($\\Delta \\nu/\\nu_0 \\sim\n10^{-6}$) in the Vela pulsar.

In Euclidean space within the Matsubara imaginary\ntime formalism the quark propagator is not longer a O(4) symmetric function and\npossesses a discrete spectra of the fourth component of the momentum. This\nmakes the treatment of the Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations\nconceptually different from the vacuum and technically much more involved. The\nquestion whether the interaction kernel known from vacuum calculations can be\napplied at finite temperatures remains still open. We find that, at low\ntemperatures, the model interaction with vacuum parameters provides a\nreasonable description of the quark propagator, while at temperatures higher\nthan a certain critical value $T_c$ the interaction requires stringent\nmodifications. The general properties of the quark propagator at finite\ntemperatures can be inferred from lattice QCD calculations.

The muonic hydrogen result can be tested by a muon-proton\nscattering experiment, MUSE, that is planned at the Paul Scherrer Institute in\nSwitzerland. The typical momenta of the muons in this experiment are of the\norder of the muon mass. In this energy regime the muons are relativistic but\nthe protons are still non-relativistic.

As this QCD\ninterference does not depend on the strong coupling constant, it is part of the\nno-interaction baseline that needs to be controlled prior to searching for\nother manifestations of collective dynamics. Here, we introduce a model that is\nbased on the QCD theory of multi-parton interactions and that allows one to\nstudy interference effects in the production of $m$ particles in hadronic\ncollisions with $N$ parton-parton interactions (\"sources\"). In an expansion in\npowers of $1/(N_c^2-1)$ and to leading order in the number of sources $N$, we\ncalculate interference effects in the $m$-particle spectra and we determine\nfrom them the second and fourth order cumulant momentum anisotropies $v_n$.\nWithout invoking any azimuthal asymmetry and any density dependent non-linear\ndynamics in the incoming state, and without invoking any interaction in the\nfinal state, we find that QCD interference alone can give rise to values for\n$v_n\\lbrace 2\\rbrace$ and $v_n\\lbrace 4\\rbrace$, $n$ even, that persist\nunattenuated for increasing number of sources, that may increase with\nincreasing multiplicity and that agree with measurements in proton-proton (pp)\ncollisions in terms of the order of magnitude of the signal and the approximate\nshape of the transverse momentum dependence.

We first generate partons just after the collisions by\nusing event generators. These partons dynamically generate the quark gluon\nplasma (QGP) fluids through the source terms in the hydrodynamic equations.\nAccording to the core-corona picture, this process tends to happen where the\ndensity of generated partons is high and their transverse momentum is low. Some\npartons do not fully participate in this process when they are in dilute\nregions or their transverse momentum is high and subsequently fragment into\nhadrons through string fragmentation.

The phase transition from pure nucleonic matter to the\nkaon condensate phase is described using Gibbs' rules for phase equilibrium,\nwhich permit the existence of a mixed phase. A general property of neutron\nstars containing kaon condensates, as well as other forms of strangeness, is\nthat the maximum mass for cold, neutrino-free matter can be less than the\nmaximum mass for matter containing trapped neutrinos or which has a finite\nentropy. A proto-neutron star formed with a baryon mass exceeding that of the\nmaximum mass of cold, neutrino-free matter is therefore metastable, that is, it\nwill collapse to a black hole at some time during the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling\nstage.\n  The effects of kaon condensation on metastable stars are dramatic. In these\ncases, the neutrino signal from a hypothetical galactic supernova (distance\n$\\sim8.5$ kpc) will stop suddenly, generally at a level above the background in\nthe SuperK and SNO detectors, which have low energy thresholds and backgrounds.\nThis is in contrast to the case of a stable star, for which the signal\nexponentially decays, eventually disappearing into the background.

Because of the symmetry of\nthe problem, we are able to simplify the Ginzburg-Landau equations and express\nthem in terms of two components of the di-quark condensate and one component of\nthe gauge potential.

The latter would serve as the cosmological cold\ndark matter. In certain conditions the separation of charge is C and CP\nasymmetric and can leave a net excess of hadrons over antihadrons in the\nconventional phase, even if the visible universe is globally baryon symmetric\n$B = 0$. In this case an equal, but negative, overall baryon charge must be\nhidden in the lumps of novel phase. Due to the small volume occupied by these\ndense lumps/antilumps of color superconducting phase and the specific features\nof their interaction with \"normal\" matter in hadronic phase, this scenario does\nnot contradict the current phenomenological constrains on presence of\nantimatter in the visible universe.

The phase diagram has a chiral symmetry\nbreaking vacuum, a color superconductor phase at high density, and a mixed\nphase in between which can describe nuclear matter if the high density regions\nin the mixed phase form droplets. This is amusingly similar to the phase\ndiagram of the copper oxide superconductors, although their critical\ntemperatures are smaller by a factor of about 10^{-9} and their mixed phase\nseems to form stripes, rather than droplets.

The vector meson mass\ndrops significantly in the medium due to the effects of the Dirac sea. In the\nvariational approach adopted in the present paper, these effects are taken into\naccount through a realignment of the ground state with baryon condensates. Such\na realignment of the ground state becomes equivalent to summing of the baryonic\ntadpole diagrams in the relativistic Hartree approximation (RHA). The\napproximation scheme adopted here goes beyond RHA to include quantum effects\nfrom the scalar meson and is nonperturbative and self--consistent. It includes\nmultiloop effects, thus corresponding to a different approximation as compared\nto the one loop approximation of including scalar field quantum corrections. In\nthe present work, we study the properties of the vector mesons in the hot and\ndense matter as modified due to such quantum correction effects from the baryon\nas well as scalar meson sectors. These medium modifications of the properties\nof the vector mesons are reflected, through the shifting and broadening of the\nrespective peaks, in the low mass dilepton spectra. There is broadening of the\npeaks due to corrections from scalar meson quantum effects as compared to the\nrelativistic Hartree approximation.

We study the sensitivity of this\nconclusion to different hydrodynamic assumptions on chemical and thermal\nfreezeout after the sQGP hadronizes. We show that if chemical freezeout occurs\nat the hadronization time, the differential elliptic flow for pions increase\nwith proper time in the late hadronic phase until thermal freezeout and leads\nto a discrepancy with the data. In contrast, if both chemical and thermal\nequilibrium are maintained past the hadronization, then the mean pT per pion\nincreases in a way that accidentally preserves v2(pT) from the sQGP phase in\nagreement with the data, but at the cost of the agreement with the hadronic\nyields. In order that all the data on hadronic ratios, radial flow, and\ndifferential elliptic flow be reproduced, the sQGP must expand with a minimal\nviscosity, \\eta_Q, that is however even greater than the viscosity, \\eta_H, of\nits hadronic corona. However, because of the large entropy density difference\nof the two phases of QCD matter, the larger viscosity in the sQGP phase leads\nto nearly perfect fluid flow while the smaller entropy density of the hadronic\ncorona strongly hinders the applicability of Euler hydrodynamics. The ``perfect\nfluid'' property of the sQGP is thus not due to a sudden reduction of the\nviscosity at the critical temperature Tc, but to a sudden increase of the\nentropy density of QCD matter and is therefore an important signature of\ndeconfinement. \n\n"}

Comparison of evolution of ideal and\nviscous fluid, both initialised under the same conditions e.g. same\nequilibration time, energy density and velocity profile, reveal that the\ndissipative fluid evolves slowly, cooling at a slower rate. Cooling get still\nslower for higher viscosity. The fluid velocities on the otherhand evolve\nfaster in a dissipative fluid than in an ideal fluid. The transverse expansion\nis also enhanced in dissipative evolution. For the same decoupling temperature,\nfreeze-out surface for a dissipative fluid is more extended than an ideal\nfluid. Dissipation produces entropy as a result of which particle production is\nincreased. Particle production is increased due to (i) extension of the\nfreeze-out surface and (ii) change of the equilibrium distribution function to\na non-equilibrium one, the last effect being prominent at large transverse\nmomentum. Compared to ideal fluid, transverse momentum distribution of pion\nproduction is considerably enhanced. Enhancement is more at high $p_T$ than at\nlow $p_T$. Pion production also increases with viscosity, larger the viscosity,\nmore is the pion production. Dissipation also modifies the elliptic flow.\nElliptic flow is reduced in viscous dynamics. Also, contrary to ideal dynamics\nwhere elliptic flow continues to increase with transverse momentum, in viscous\ndynamics, elliptic flow tends to saturate at large transverse momentum. The\nanalysis suggest that initial conditions of the hot, dense matter produced in\nAu+Au collisions at RHIC, as extracted from ideal fluid analysis can be changed\nsignificantly if the QGP fluid is viscous. \n\n"}

We found that even for the most heavy systems\nparticle emission takes place from the whole space-time domain available for\nthe system evolution, but not from the thin ''freeze-out hypersurface\", adopted\nin fluid dynamical models. Pions are continuously emitted from the whole volume\nof the reaction and reflect the main trends of the system evolution. Nucleons\nin Pb+Pb collisions initially come from the surface region. For both systems\nthere is a separation of the elastic and inelastic freeze-out. The mesons with\nlarge transverse momenta, $p_t$, are predominantly produced at the early stages\nof the reaction. The low $p_t$-component is populated by mesons coming mainly\nfrom the decay of resonances. This explains naturally the decreasing source\nsizes with increasing $p_t$, observed in HBT interferometry. Comparison with\nS+S and Au+Au systems at 11.6 AGeV/$c$ is also presented. \n\n"}
{"id": "nucl-th/9908054", "contents": "Title: Improving the Convergence of NN Effective Field Theory Abstract: We study a low-energy effective field theory (EFT) describing the NN system\nin which all exchanged particles are integrated out. We show that fitting the\nresidue of the 3S1 amplitude at the deuteron pole, rather than the 3S1\neffective range, dramatically improves the convergence of deuteron observables\nin this theory. Reproducing the residue ensures that the tail of the deuteron\nwave function, which is directly related to NN scattering data via analytic\ncontinuation, is correctly reproduced in the EFT at next-to-leading order. The\nrole of multi-nucleon-electroweak operators which produce deviations from\neffective-range theory can then be explicitly separated from the physics of the\nwave function tail. Such an operator contributes to the deuteron quadrupole\nmoment, mu_Q, at low order, indicating a sensitivity to short-distance physics.\nThis is consistent with the failure of impulse approximation calculations in NN\npotential models to reproduce mu_Q. The convergence of NN phase shifts in the\nEFT is unimpaired by the use of this new expansion. \n\n"}

The applicability of its basic factorization\nassumption is clarified. An approximate scaling of the basic observables with\nthe phase space density is demonstrated in the low density (gas) limit. This\nscaling and also its violation at high densities due to the condensate\nformation is described by approximate analytical formulae which allow, in\nprinciple, for the identification of the multiboson effects among others. For\nmoderate densities indicated by the experimental data, a fast saturation of\nmultiboson effects with the number of contributing cumulants is obtained,\nallowing for the account of these effects in realistic transport code\nsimulations. At high densities, the spectra are mainly determined by the\nuniversal condensate term and the initially narrow Poisson multiplicity\ndistribution approaches a wide Bose-Einstein one. As a result, the intercepts\nof the inclusive and fixed-$n$ correlation functions (properly normalized to 1\nat large relative momenta) approach 2 and 1, respectively and their widths\nlogarithmically increase with the increasing phase space density. It is shown\nthat the neglect of energy-momentum constraints in the model is justified\nexcept near a multipion threshold, where these constraints practically exclude\nthe possibility of a very cold condensate production. It is argued that\nspectacular multiboson effects are likely to be observed only in the rare\nevents containing sufficiently high density (speckle) fluctuations. \n\n"}

In the first part of this\narticle we employ the massive Yang-Mills framework to construct an effective\nchiral Lagrangian based on low-energy mesonic modes at finite density. The\nlatter are identified through nuclear collective excitations of `meson'-sobar\ntype such as $\\pi\\leftrightarrow [\\Delta (1232)N^{-1}]\\equiv\\hat\\pi$,\n$\\rho\\leftrightarrow [N^* (1520)N^{-1}]\\equiv\\hat\\rho$, etc..
