Indeed, on page\n78/79 of this book, Macaulay is saying the following: \" A polynomial ideal\n$\\mathfrak{a} \\subset k[{\\chi}\\_1$,..., ${\\chi}\\_n]=k[\\chi]$ is of the {\\it\nprincipal class} and thus {\\it unmixed} if it has rank $r$ and is generated by\n$r$ polynomials. Having in mind this definition, a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nwith associated prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = rad(\\mathfrak{q})$ is such that any\nideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\\mathfrak{a} \\subset\n\\mathfrak{q}$ determines a primary ideal of greater {\\it multiplicity} over\n$k$. In particular, we have $dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/({\\chi}\\_1$,...,${\\chi}\\_n)^2)=n+1$\nbecause, passing to a system of PD equations for one unknown $y$, the\nparametric jets are \\{${y,y\\_1, ...,y\\_n}$\\} but any ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of\nthe principal class with $\\mathfrak{a}\\subset ({\\chi}\\_1,{\\^a},{\\chi}\\_n)^2$ is\ncontained into a {\\it simple} ideal, that is a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nsuch that $rad(\\mathfrak{q})=\\mathfrak{m}\\in max(k[\\chi])$ is a maximal and\nthus prime ideal with $dim\\_k(M)=dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/\\mathfrak{q})=2^n$ at least.\nAccordingly, any primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$ may not be a member of the\nprimary decomposition of an unmixed ideal $\\mathfrak{a} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{q}$\nof the principal class. Otherwise, $\\mathfrak{q}$ is said to be of the {\\it\nprincipal noetherian class} \". Our aim is to explain this result in a modern\nlanguage and to illustrate it by providing a similar example for $n=4$. The\nimportance of such an example is that it allows for the first time to exhibit\nsymbols which are $2,3,4$-acyclic without being involutive. Another interest of\nthis example is that it has properties quite similar to the ones held by the\nsystem of conformal Killing equations which are still not known. For this\nreason, we have put all the examples at the end of the paper and each one is\npresented in a rather independent way though a few among them are quite tricky.\nMeanwhile, the second purpose is to prove that the methods developped by\nMacaulay in order to study {\\it unmixed polynomial ideals} are only particular\nexamples of new formal differential geometric techniques that have been\nintroduced recently in order to study {\\it pure differential modules}. However\nthese procedures are based on the formal theory of systems of ordinary\ndifferential (OD) or partial differential (PD) equations, in particular on a\nsystematic use of the Spencer operator, and are still not acknowledged by the\nalgebraic community. \n\n"}

These form a wide class of potentially realistic\nfour-dimensional vacua of string theory. Despite all their phenomenological\npromise, there is little understanding of the metric on the moduli space of\nthese. What is sought is the analogue of special geometry for these vacua. The\nmetric on the moduli space is important in phenomenology as it normalises\nD-terms and Yukawa couplings. It is also of interest in mathematics, since it\ngeneralises the metric, first found by Kobayashi, on the space of gauge field\nconnections, to a more general context. Here we construct this metric, correct\nto first order in alpha', in two ways: first by postulating a metric that is\ninvariant under background gauge transformations of the gauge field, and also\nby dimensionally reducing heterotic supergravity. These methods agree and the\nresulting metric is Kahler, as is required by supersymmetry. Checking that the\nmetric is in fact Kahler is quite intricate and uses the anomaly cancellation\nequation for the H-field, in an essential way. The Kahler potential\nnevertheless takes a remarkably simple form: it is Kahler potential for special\ngeometry with the Kahler form replaced by the alpha'-corrected hermitian form. \n\n"}

This strengthened the invariance statement\ninitially proved by Welschinger.\n  This main result follows easily from a formula relating Welschinger\ninvariants of two real symplectic manifolds differing by a surgery along a real\nLagrangian sphere. In its turn, once one believes that such formula may hold,\nits proof is a mild adaptation of the proof of analogous formulas previously\nobtained by the author on the one hand, and by Itenberg, Kharlamov and Shustin\non the other hand.\n  We apply the two aforementioned results to complete the computation of\nWelschinger invariants of real rational algebraic surfaces, and to obtain\nvanishing, sign, and sharpness results for these invariants that generalize\npreviously known statements.

We explore this conjecture without\nreference to the special Lagrangian condition.
