This\narticle studies its relationship with the theory of quaternionic holomorphic\n2-tori in HP^1 (which are equivalent to conformally immersed 2-tori in S^4).\nAfter describing how the Sato-Segal-Wilson construction of KP solutions\n(particularly solutions of finite type) carries over to this quaternionic\nsetting, we compare three different notions of \"spectral curve\": the QKP\nspectral curve, which arises from an algebra of commuting differential\noperators; the (unnormalised) Floquet multiplier spectral curve for the related\nDirac operator; and the curve parameterising Darboux transforms of a conformal\n2-torus in S^4 (in the sense of Bohle, Leschke, Pedit and Pinkall).

This system is a kinetic model which has a similar Vlasov structure as\nthe classical Vlasov-Poisson system, but is coupled to a potential in $-1/r-\n1/r^2$ (Manev potential) instead of the usual gravitational potential in\n$-1/r$, and in particular the potential field does not satisfy a Poisson\nequation but a fractional-Laplacian equation. We first prove the orbital\nstability of the ground states type solutions which are constructed as\nminimizers of the Hamiltonian, following the classical strategy: compactness of\nthe minimizing sequences and the rigidity of the flow. However, in driving this\nanalysis, there are two mathematical obstacles: the first one is related to the\npossible blow-up of solutions to the VM system, which we overcome by imposing a\nsub-critical condition on the constraints of the variational problem. The\nsecond difficulty (and the most important) is related to the nature of the\nEuler-Lagrange equations (fractional-Laplacian equations) to which classical\nresults for the Poisson equation do not extend.

The goal was\nto unify the local and global theory of these convolution-type models,\nincluding the identification of a sharp critical mass; however, some cases\ninvolving unbounded domains were left open. In particular, the biologically\nrelevant case $\\Real^2$ was not treated. In this paper, we present an\nalternative proof of local existence, which now applies to $\\Real^d$ for all $d\n\\geq 2$ and give global results that were left open. The proof departs from\nprevious work in that it uses a more direct and intuitive regularization that\nconstructs approximate solutions on $\\Real^d$ instead of on sequences of\nbounded domains. Second, this work develops the local, subcritical, and small\ndata critical theory for a variety of Patlak-Keller-Segel models with spatially\nvarying diffusion and decay rate of the chemo-attractant. \n\n"}

It can be given\nin terms of an enforcement of the Lott, Sturm and Villani geodesic convexity\ncondition for the entropy coupled with the linearity of the heat flow.

Lojasiewicz proved this result in the early 1960s as\na consequence of his gradient inequality.\n  Many problems in calculus of variations are questions about critical points\nor gradient flow lines of an infinite dimensional functional. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, even blowups at singularities of many nonlinear PDE's can, in a\ncertain sense, be thought of as limits of infinite dimensional gradient flows\nof analytic functionals. Thus, the question of uniqueness of blowups can be\napproached as an infinite dimensional version of Lojasiewicz's theorem. The\nquestion of uniqueness of blowups is perhaps the most fundamental question\nabout singularities.\n  This approach to uniqueness was pioneered by Leon Simon thirty years ago for\nthe area functional and many related functionals using an elaborate reduction\nto a finite dimensional setting where Lojasiewicz's arguments applied.\n  Recently, the authors proved two new infinite dimensional Lojasiewicz\ninequalities at noncompact singularities where it was well-known that a\nreduction to Lojasiewicz's arguments is not possible, but instead entirely new\ntechniques are required. As a consequence, the authors settled a major\nlong-standing open question about uniqueness of blowups for mean curvature flow\nat all generic singularities and for mean convex mean curvature flow at all\nsingularities.

However, the rate of isocline\nmovement can be highly variable, with much uncertainty associated with yearly\nshifts. The same is true for population growth rates. Growth rates can be\nvariable and uncertain, even within suitable habitats for growth. In this paper\nwe reanalyze the question of population persistence in the context of the\nuncertainty and variability in isocline shifts and rates of growth.\nSpecifically, we employ a stochastic integrodifference equation model on a\npatch of suitable habitat that shifts poleward at a random rate.

Furthermore,\na careful estimation of the residual, together with stability estimates\nprovided by the PDE well-posedness framework, allow us to establish error\nestimates between the slender body approximation and the exact solution to the\nabove problem.

In this paper we are concerned with\nweak solutions to the Navier-Stokes inequality on $\\mathbb{R}^3$, that is\nvector fields that satisfy both the SEI and the LEI (but not necessarily solve\nthe Navier-Stokes equations).

We show that the solution $q(x,t)$ of\nthis initial value problem has a different asymptotic behavior in different\nregions of the $xt$-plane. In the regions $x<-2\\sqrt{2}q_0^2t$ and\n$x>2\\sqrt{2}q_0^2t$, the solution takes the form of a plane wave. In the region\n$-2\\sqrt{2}q_0^2t<x<2\\sqrt{2}q_0^2t$, the solution takes the form of a\nmodulated elliptic wave. \n\n"}

At its heart, Reifenberg theory is\nabout studying general sets or measures which can be, in one sense or another,\napproximated on all scales by well behaved spaces, typically just Euclidean\nspace itself. Such sets and measures turn out not to be arbitrary, and often\ntimes come with special structure inherited from what they are being\napproximated by.\n  We will begin by recalling and proving the standard Reifenberg theorem, which\nsays that sets in Euclidean space which are well approximated by affine\nsubspaces on all scales must be homoemorphic to balls. These types of results\nhave applications to studying the regular parts of solutions of nonlinear\nequations. The proof given is designed to move cleanly over to more complicated\nscenarios introduced later.\n  The rest of the lecture notes are designed to introduce and prove the\nRectifiable Reifenberg Theorem, including an introduction to the relevant\nconcepts. The Rectifiable Reifenberg Theorem roughly says that if a measure\n$\\mu$ is summably close on all scales to affine subspaces $L^k$, then\n$\\mu=\\mu^++\\mu^k$ may be broken into pieces such that $\\mu^k$ is\n$k$-rectifiable with uniform Hausdorff measure estimates, and $\\mu^+$ has\nuniform bounds on its mass.

The systems involve two\nsmall parameters: one is the ratio of the slow and the fast time scales, and\nanother one is the ratio of the small and the large space scales. We show that\na wide class of such systems, including nonlinear Schrodinger and Maxwell\nequations, Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model and many other not completely integrable\nsystems, satisfy a superposition principle. The principle essentially states\nthat if a nonlinear evolution of a wave starts initially as a sum of generic\nwavepackets (defined as almost monochromatic waves), then this wave with a high\naccuracy remains a sum of separate wavepacket waves undergoing independent\nnonlinear evolution. The time intervals for which the evolution is considered\nare long enough to observe fully developed nonlinear phenomena for involved\nwavepackets. In particular, our approach provides a simple justification for\nnumerically observed effect of almost non-interaction of solitons passing\nthrough each other without any recourse to the complete integrability. Our\nanalysis does not rely on any ansatz or common asymptotic expansions with\nrespect to the two small parameters but it uses rather explicit and\nconstructive representation for solutions as functions of the initial data in\nthe form of functional analytic series. \n\n"}

{"id": "math/0607108", "contents": "Title: Higher order Mori-Zwanzig models for the Euler equations Abstract: In a recent paper \\cite{CHSS06}, an infinitely long memory model (the\nt-model) for the Euler equations was presented and analyzed. The model can be\nderived by keeping the zeroth order term in a Taylor expansion of the memory\nintegrand in the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. We present here a collection of models\nfor the Euler equations which are based also on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. The\nmodels arise from a Taylor expansion of a different operator, the orthogonal\ndynamics evolution operator, which appears in the memory integrand. The zero,\nfirst and second order models are constructed and simulated numerically. The\nform of the nonlinearity in the Euler equations, the special properties of the\nprojection operator used and the general properties of any projection operator\ncan be exploited to facilitate the recursive calculation of even higher order\nmodels. We use our models to compute the rate of energy decay for the\nTaylor-Green vortex problem. The results are in good agreement with the\ntheoretical estimates. The energy decay appears to be organized in \"waves\" of\nactivity, i.e. alternating periods of fast and slow decay. Our results\ncorroborate the assumption in \\cite{CHSS06}, that the modeling of the 3D Euler\nequations by a few low wavenumber modes should include a long memory. \n\n"}
