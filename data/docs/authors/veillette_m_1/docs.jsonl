The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical\nto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function\nhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost\nidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\rm\nth}$ CF Landau level.

We\nresolve this seeming paradox by considering a microscopic model of electronic\ninterferometers made from a quantum Hall liquid at filling factor 1/m. An\napproximate ground state of such interferometers is described by a Laughlin\ntype wave function, and low-energy excitations are incompressible deformations\nof this state. We construct a low-energy effective theory by restricting the\nmicroscopic Hamiltonian of electrons to the space of incompressible\ndeformations and show that the theory of the quantum Hall edge so obtained is a\ngeneralization of a chiral conformal field theory. In our theory, a\nquasi-particle tunneling operator is found to be a single-valued function of\ntunneling point coordinates, and its phase depends on the topology determined\nby the positions of Ohmic contacts.

These\nmoments interact with each other via exchange interactions as well as\nphonon-mediated biquadratic interactions that favor a collinear double-stripe\nstate, corresponding to the ordering vectors $\\left(\\pm\\pi/2,\\pm\\pi/2\\right)$.\nThe remaining Fe orbitals are assumed to be itinerant, giving rise to the\nfirst-principle derived Fermi surface displaying nesting features at momenta\n$\\left(\\pi,0\\right)/\\left(0,\\pi\\right)$. Increasing the amount of itinerant\nelectrons due to excess Fe, $y$, leads to changes in the Fermi surface and to\nthe suppression of its nesting properties. As a result, due to the Hund's\ncoupling between the itinerant and localized moments, increasing $y$ leads to\nmodifications in the local moments' exchange interactions via the multi-orbital\ngeneralization of the long-range Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\ninteraction.

However, the geometric topology of the studied samples is\nusually trivial, such as a ribbon or a cylinder. In this paper, we consider a\ngraphene M\\\"obius band irradiated with circularly polarised light.\nInterestingly, due to the non-orientability of the M\\\"obius band, a homogeneous\nquantum Hall effect cannot exist in this system, but the quantum spin Hall\neffect can. To avoid this restriction, the irradiation is applied in a\nlongitudinal-domain-wall configuration. In this way, the periodic\ntime-dependent driving term tends to generate the quantum anomalous Hall\neffect.

The most striking result is that\neven without impurities the Fermi surface term, a non-Berry-curvature term,\nplays dominant roles at high or slightly low temperatures. In particular, this\nFermi surface term causes the temperature dependence of the dc anomalous Hall\nor spin Hall conductivity due to the interaction-induced quasiparticle damping\nand the correction of the dc spin Hall conductivity due to the spin-Coulomb\ndrag.

The information of excitations,\ne.g., dynamic correlation length and energy gap, can be accurately calculated\nfrom the tMPS.

To prove this, we examine the generic band topology of two\ndimensional real fermions in systems with space-time inversion $I_{ST}$\nsymmetry. The Euler class is an integer topological invariant classifying real\ntwo band systems. We show that a two-band system with a nonzero Euler class\ncannot have an $I_{ST}$-symmetric Wannier representation. Moreover, a two-band\nsystem with the Euler class $e_{2}$ has band crossing points whose total\nwinding number is equal to $-2e_2$. Thus the conventional Nielsen-Ninomiya\ntheorem fails in systems with a nonzero Euler class. We propose that the\ntopological phase transition between two insulators carrying distinct Euler\nclasses can be described in terms of the pair creation and annihilation of\nvortices accompanied by winding number changes across Dirac strings.

Building blocks are\nquantum wires described by the (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT)\nassociated with a current algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. The wires are coupled with\neach other to form a 3D network through the current-current interactions of\n$\\mathfrak{g}_1$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ CFTs that are related to the\n$\\mathfrak{g}$ CFT by a nontrivial conformal embedding $\\mathfrak{g} \\supset\n\\mathfrak{g}_1 \\times \\mathfrak{g}_2$.

In\nthis paper, we study spectral and eigenstate properties of this coupled SYK\nmodel. We have found that level statistics in the tail of the spectrum, and for\na sufficiently weak coupling, shows substantial deviations from random matrix\ntheory which suggests that traversable wormholes are not quantum chaotic. By\ncontrast, for sufficiently strong coupling, corresponding to the black hole\nphase, level statistics are well described by random matrix theory. This\ntransition in level statistics coincides approximately with a previously\nreported Hawking-Page transition for weak coupling. We have shown explicitly\nthat this thermodynamic transition turns into a sharp crossover as the coupling\nincreases. Likewise, this critical coupling also corresponds with the one at\nwhich the overlap between the ground state and the thermofield double state\n(TFD) is smallest. In the range of sizes we can reach by exact diagonalization,\nthe ground state is well approximated by the TFD state only in the strong\ncoupling limit. This is due to the fact that the ground state is close to the\neigenstate of the spin operator corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue which is\nan exact TFD state at infinite temperature. In this region, the spectral\ndensity is separated into blobs centered around the eigenvalues of the spin\noperator. For weaker couplings, the exponential decay of coefficients in a\ntensor product basis, typical of the TFD, becomes power law. Finally, we have\nalso found that the total Hamiltonian has an additional discrete symmetry which\nhas not been reported previously. \n\n"}

Within this theory the puzzling physics of the\ncuprates is shown to be a behavior specific of their structure, within the\nregime of a Mott transition. The translational symmetry within the CuO_2 planes\nis disturbed by dynamical stripe-like inhomogeneities, which provide\nquasi-one-dimensional segments where the large-U scenario of separation between\nspin and charge is materialized. However, these charge carriers gain itineracy\nonly due to the coupling with electrons in the regions where spin and charge\nare inseparable. Consequently a two-component scenario is obtained of heavy and\nlight charge carriers, which are coupled through spin carriers. The theory\ncould explain all the anomalous properties of the cuprates that were studied by\nit, including those observed in transport, tunneling, ARPES, and\nneutron-scattering results, the pairing mechanism and its symmetry, the\nobserved phase diagram, and the occurrence of intrinsic nanoscale\nheterogeneity.
