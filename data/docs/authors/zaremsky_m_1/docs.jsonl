We introduce a computational asymmetry function that measures\nthe amount of one-wayness of permutations. We also introduce the word-length\nasymmetry function for groups, which is an algebraic analogue of computational\nasymmetry. We relate boolean circuits to words in a Thompson monoid, over a\nfixed generating set, in such a way that circuit size is equal to word-length.\nMoreover, boolean circuits have a representation in terms of elements of a\nThompson group, in such a way that circuit size is polynomially equivalent to\nword-length.

It is a key\ningredient of the usual solutions to the conjugacy problem in braid groups. In\ntheir seminal paper on braid-cryptography, Ko, Lee et al. proposed the {\\it\ncycling problem} as a hard problem in braid groups that could be interesting\nfor cryptography. In this paper we give a polynomial solution to that problem,\nmainly by showing that cycling is surjective, and using a result by Maffre\nwhich shows that pre-images under cycling can be computed fast. This result\nalso holds in every Artin-Tits group of spherical type.\n  On the other hand, the conjugacy search problem in braid groups is usually\nsolved by computing some finite sets called (left) ultra summit sets\n(left-USS), using left normal forms of braids. But one can equally use right\nnormal forms and compute right-USS's. Hard instances of the conjugacy search\nproblem correspond to elements having big (left and right) USS's. One may think\nthat even if some element has a big left-USS, it could possibly have a small\nright-USS. We show that this is not the case in the important particular case\nof rigid braids. More precisely, we show that the left-USS and the right-USS of\na given rigid braid determine isomorphic graphs, with the arrows reversed, the\nisomorphism being defined using iterated cycling. We conjecture that the same\nis true for every element, not necessarily rigid, in braid groups and\nArtin-Tits groups of spherical type. \n\n"}

Indeed, the fundamental group of a 3-manifold is\nleft-orderable whenever the first Betti number is positive; in the case that\nthe first Betti number is zero this property is closely tied to the existence\nof certain nice foliations. As a result, many large classes of 3-manifolds,\nincluding knot complements, are known to have left-orderable fundamental group.\nHowever, though the complement of a knot has left-orderable fundamental group,\nthe result of Dehn surgery is a closed 3-manifold that need not have this\nproperty. We take this as motivation for the study of left-orderability in the\ncontext of Dehn surgery, and establish a condition on peripheral elements that\nmust hold whenever a given Dehn surgery yields a manifold with left-orderable\nfundamental group. This leads to a workable criterion used to determine when\nsufficiently positive Dehn surgery produces manifolds with non-left-orderable\nfundamental group. As examples we produce infinite families of hyperbolic knots\n-- subsuming the (-2,3,q)-pretzel knots -- for which sufficiently positive\nsurgery always produces a manifold with non-left-orderable fundamental group.\nOur examples are consistent with the observation that many (indeed, all known)\nexamples of L-spaces have non-left-orderable fundamental group, as the given\nfamilies of knots are hyperbolic L-space knots. Moreover, the behaviour of the\nexamples studied here is consistent with the property that sufficiently\npositive surgery on an L-space knot always yields an L-space. \n\n"}

When more general parabolic groups\nare allowed, these subgroups of GL_n(Z) have to be replaced by McCool groups:\nautomorphisms of parabolic groups acting trivially (i.e. by conjugation) on\ncertain subgroups. Given a malnormal quasiconvex subgroup P of a hyperbolic\ngroup G, we view G as hyperbolic relative to P and we apply the previous\nanalysis to describe the group Out(P to G) of automorphisms of P that extend to\nG: it is virtually a McCool group.

When G is hyperbolic, we show that Out(G) is\ninfinite if and only if G splits over a maximal virtually cyclic subgroup with\ninfinite center.

Several longstanding conjectures that are\nstill open for arbitrary groups were settled in the case of sofic or\nhyperlinear groups. These achievements aroused the interest of an increasing\nnumber of researchers into some fundamental questions about the nature of these\napproximation properties. Many of such problems are to this day still open such\nas, outstandingly: Is there any countable discrete group that is not sofic or\nhyperlinear?

The theme has often been restricted to finitely generated\ngroups, but it can favorably be played for locally compact groups. The\ndevelopment of the theory is illustrated by numerous examples, including matrix\ngroups with entries in the the field of real or complex numbers, or other\nlocally compact fields such as p-adic fields, isometry groups of various metric\nspaces, and, last but not least, discrete group themselves. Word metrics for\ncompactly generated groups play a major role. In the particular case of\nfinitely generated groups, they were introduced by Dehn around 1910 in\nconnection with the Word Problem. Some of the results exposed concern general\nlocally compact groups, such as criteria for the existence of compatible\nmetrics on locally compact groups.

Our methods use geometric finite semigroup theory\nvia the Karnofsky-Rhodes and the McCammond expansions of finite semigroups with\nspecified generators; this does not involve any linear algebra. The original\nTsetlin library is obtained by applying the expansions to $P(n)$, the set of\nall subsets of an $n$ element set. Our set-up generalizes previous\ngroundbreaking work involving left-regular bands (or $\\mathscr{R}$-trivial\nbands) by Brown and Diaconis, extensions to $\\mathscr{R}$-trivial semigroups by\nAyyer, Steinberg, Thi\\'ery and the second author, and important recent work by\nChung and Graham. The Karnofsky-Rhodes expansion of the right Cayley graph of\n$S$ in terms of generators yields again a right Cayley graph. The McCammond\nexpansion provides normal forms for elements in the expanded $S$.

In this paper we study versions of\nthis for an infinite group G, with the degree of nilpotence defined by sampling\nG in various natural ways, such as with a random walk, or with a Folner\nsequence if G is amenable. In our first main result we show that if G is\nfinitely generated then the degree of k-step nilpotence is positive if and only\nif G is virtually k-step nilpotent. This generalises both an earlier result of\nthe second author treating the case k=1 and a result of Shalev for finite\ngroups, and uses techniques from both of these earlier results.

Gromov's theory of bounded cohomology was based on\nthe use of multicomplexes, which are simplicial structures that generalize\nsimplicial complexes without allowing all the degeneracies appearing in\nsimplicial sets.\n  In the first part of this paper we lay the foundation of the theory of\nmulticomplexes.

When $W$ is the symmetric group, we obtain the poset of\nclassical $k$-divisible noncrossing partitions, first studied by Edelman.\n  Along the way, we include a comprehensive introduction to related background\nmaterial. Before defining our generalization $NC^{(k)}(W)$, we develop from\nscratch the theory of algebraic noncrossing partitions $NC(W)$.

{"id": "quant-ph/0609205", "contents": "Title: Group Theoretical Formulation of Quantum Partial Search Algorithm Abstract: Searching and sorting used as a subroutine in many important algorithms.\nQuantum algorithm can find a target item in a database faster than any\nclassical algorithm. One can trade accuracy for speed and find a part of the\ndatabase (a block) containing the target item even faster, this is partial\nsearch. An example is the following: exact address of the target item is given\nby a sequence of many bits, but we need to know only some of them. More\ngenerally partial search considers the following problem: a database is\nseparated into several blocks. We want to find a block with the target item,\nnot the target item itself. In this paper we reformulate quantum partial search\nalgorithm in terms of group theory. \n\n"}
