The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S}$\ndecay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective\n$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct\nCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the\nlatter.

To this end we\ngeneralize the usual notion of MT2 and define a new MT2(n,p,c) variable, which\ncan be applied to various subsystem topologies, as well as the full event\ntopology. We derive analytic formulas for its endpoint MT2{max}(n,p,c) as a\nfunction of the unknown test mass Mc of the final particle in the subchain and\nthe transverse momentum pT due to radiation from the initial state. We show\nthat the endpoint functions MT2{max}(n,p,c)(Mc,pT) may exhibit three different\ntypes of kinks and discuss the origin of each type. We prove that the subsystem\nMT2(n,p,c) variables by themselves already yield a sufficient number of\nmeasurements for a complete determination of the mass spectrum (including the\noverall mass scale). As an illustration, we consider the simple case of a decay\nchain with up to three heavy particles, X2 -> X1 -> X0, which is rather\nproblematic for all other mass measurement methods. We propose three different\nMT2-based methods, each of which allows a complete determination of the masses\nof particles X0, X1 and X2. The first method only uses MT2(n,p,c) endpoint\nmeasurements at a single fixed value of the test mass Mc.

The\ndetector is designed to hold a maximum of about 150 kg of xenon at 15 bar, or\n100 kg at 10 bar. This option builds in the capability to increase the total\nisotope mass by 50% while keeping the operating pressure at a manageable level.\n  The readout plane performing the energy measurement is composed of Hamamatsu\nR11410-10 photomultipliers, specially designed for operation in low-background,\nxenon-based detectors.

We consider two different\nbackground subtraction methods, an area-based one implemented through the\nFastJet pack- age and a pedestal subtraction method, that resemble the ones\nused by the experimental collaborations at the LHC. We also analyze different\nways of defining the optimal parame- ters in the second method.

The problem of vacuum stability is overcome in the SUGRA\nGUT model but the 126 GeV Higgs mass implies that the average SUSY scale lies\nin the several TeV region.

The current experiments combine two different techniques, an array\nof surface detectors and fluorescence telescopes. The latter allow an almost\ncalorimetric measurement of the primary energy. Thus, hadron-initiated showers\ndetected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator\nfrom the surface array (usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance\nfrom the shower core S(r0)) with the primary energy. On the other hand, this\ncalibration is not feasible when searching for photon primaries since no high\nenergy photon has been unambiguously detected so far. Therefore, pure Monte\nCarlo parametrizations are used instead.\n  In this work, we present a new method to determine the primary energy of\nhadron-induced showers in a hybrid experiment based on a technique previously\ndeveloped for photon primaries. It consists on a set of calibration curves that\nrelate the surface energy estimator, S(r0), and the depth of maximum\ndevelopment of the shower, Xmax, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes.\nThen, the primary energy can be determined from pure surface information since\nS(r0) and the zenith angle of the incoming shower are only needed. Considering\na mixed sample of ultra-high energy proton and iron primaries and taking into\naccount the reconstruction uncertainties and shower to shower fluctuations, we\ndemonstrate that the primary energy may be determined with a systematic\nuncertainty below 1% and resolution around 16% in the energy range from\n10^{18.5} to 10^{19.6} eV. Several array geometries, the shape of the energy\nerror distributions and the uncertainties due to the unknown composition of the\nprimary flux have been analyzed as well. \n\n"}

In particular, two models, called\nQUE and QDEE, realize the major virtues of supersymmetry (naturalness\nconsistent with the 125 GeV Higgs boson, gauge coupling unification, and\nthermal relic neutralino dark matter) without the need for fine-tuned relations\nbetween particle masses. We determine the implications of these models for dark\nmatter and collider searches. The QUE and QDEE models revive the possibility of\nheavy Bino dark matter with mass in the range 300-700 GeV, which is not usually\nconsidered. Dark matter direct detection cross sections are typically below\ncurrent limits, but are naturally expected above the neutrino floor and may be\nseen at next-generation experiments. Indirect detection prospects are bright at\nthe Cherenkov Telescope Array, provided the 4th-generation leptons have mass\nabove 350 GeV or decay to taus. In a completely complementary way, discovery\nprospects at the LHC are dim if the 4th-generation leptons are heavy or decay\nto taus, but are bright for 4th-generation leptons with masses below 350 GeV\nthat decay either to electrons or to muons.

Abstract: One of the fundamental parameters entering neutrino oscillation framework is\nthe leptonic CP phase $\\delta_{13}$ and its measurement is an important goal of\nthe planned long baseline experiments. It should be noted that ordinary matter\neffects complicate the determination of this parameter and there are studies in\nliterature that deal with separation of intrinsic versus extrinsic CP\nviolation.

Jet substructure\ntechniques are increasingly used in experimental analyses by the LHC\ncollaborations, both in the context of searching for new physics and for\nStandard Model measurements. On the theory side, the quest for a deeper\nunderstanding of jet substructure algorithms has contributed to a renewed\ninterest in all-order calculations in QCD. This has resulted in new ideas about\nhow to design better observables and how to provide a solid theoretical\ndescription for them. In the last years, jet substructure has seen its scope\nextended, for example, with an increasing impact in the study of heavy-ion\ncollisions, or with the exploration of deep-learning techniques. Furthermore,\njet physics is an area in which experimental and theoretical approaches meet\ntogether, where cross-pollination and collaboration between the two communities\noften bear the fruits of innovative techniques.

Hypothesising that these symmetries exist implies the\nexistence of a new form of matter, called mirror matter. The mirror matter\ntheory (or exact parity model) makes four main predictions: 1) Dark matter in\nthe form of mirror matter should exist in the Universe (i.e. mirror galaxies,\nstars, planets, meteoroids...), 2) Maximal ordinary neutrino - mirror neutrino\noscillations if neutrinos have mass, 3) Orthopositronium should have a shorter\neffective lifetime than predicted by QED (in \"vacuum\" experiments) because of\nthe effects of photon-mirror photon mixing and 4) Higgs production and decay\nrate should be 50% lower than in the standard model due to Higgs mirror - Higgs\nmixing (assuming that the seperation of the Higgs masses is larger than their\ndecay widths). At the present time there is strong experimental/observational\nevidence supporting the first three of these predictions, while the fourth one\nis not tested yet because the Higgs boson, predicted in the standard model of\nparticle physics, is yet to be found.

We delineate the\ndecay channels in which most of the decay energy ionizes and heats the IGM gas\n(and thus affects the CMB), and those in which most of the energy is carried\naway -- e.g. photons with energies 100 keV < E < 1 TeV -- and thus appears as a\ncontribution to diffuse x-ray and gamma-ray backgrounds. The new constraints to\nthe decay-particle parameters from the CMB power spectrum thus complement those\nfrom the cosmic X-ray and gamma-ray backgrounds. Although decaying particles\ncan indeed produce an optical depth consistent with that reported by WMAP, in\nso doing they produce new fluctuations in the CMB temperature/polarization\npower spectra.

This supersymmetric U(1)-extended model includes an Abelian gauge\nsuperfield and a Higgs singlet superfield in addition to the standard gauge and\nHiggs superfields of the MSSM.

Manifestly, for a particle, different self\npotential leads to different energy-speed relation, which can be used as the\nfingerprints of them. In this letter, we propose an experiment to test this\nrelation. The experiment only involves low energy of particles and measurement\nof speed, which can be easily realized. The experiment may shed lights on a\nnumber of fundamental puzzles in physics. \n\n"}

Main peculiarities of the Kerr spinning\nparticle are discussed: a vortex of twisting principal null congruence,\nsingular ring and the Kerr source representing a rotating relativistic disk of\nthe Compton size. A few stringy structures can be found in the real and complex\nKerr geometry.\n  Low-energy string theory predicts the existence of a heterotic string placed\non the sharp boundary of this disk. The obtained recently supergeneralization\nof the Kerr-Newman solution suggests the existence of extra axial singular line\nand fermionic traveling waves concentrating near these singularities.\n  We discuss briefly a possibility of experimental test of these predictions. \n\n"}

It follows the idea that source\nand detector are identical. This will allow simultaneous measurements of 5\n$\\beta^-\\beta^-$ - and 4 $\\beta^+\\beta^+$ - emitters at once. Half-life limits\nfor neutrinoless double beta decay of Cd-116 and Te-130 can be improved by more\nthan one order of magnitude with respect to current limits and sensitivities on\nthe effective Majorana neutrino mass of less than 1 eV can be obtained.\nFurthermore, for the first time a realistic chance of observing double electron\ncapture processes exists. Additional searches for rare processes like the\n4-fold forbidden Cd-113 $\\beta$-decay, the electron capture of Te-123 and dark\nmatter detection can be performed. The achievable limits are evaluated for 10\nkg of such detectors and can be scaled accordingly towards higher detector\nmasses because of the modular design of the proposed experiment. \n\n"}

Hadron\nproduction at high transverse momentum (p_T) in central Au+Au collisions shows\nvery different properties (production yields, flavor composition, azimuthal\ncorrelations, ...) in comparison to p+p, d+Au, and peripheral Au+Au collisions,\nand this fact constitutes arguably the most interesting outcome of the\nexperimental program so far. Four main topics are covered in this report: (i)\nthe depletion of high p_T inclusive hadron spectra, (ii) the ``anomalous''\nbaryon-meson composition at intermediate p_T's, (iii) the disappearance of\naway-side azimuthal (jet) correlations, and (iv) the large value of collective\nazimuthal (elliptic flow) correlations. Additionally, the observed high p_T\n``Cronin enhancement'' in d+Au collisions will be discussed. A succinct\ncomparison of experimental data to theoretical models is also provided. \n\n"}

Multivariate classification methods based on machine\nlearning techniques have become a fundamental ingredient to most analyses. Also\nthe multivariate classifiers themselves have significantly evolved in recent\nyears. Statisticians have found new ways to tune and to combine classifiers to\nfurther gain in performance. Integrated into the analysis framework ROOT, TMVA\nis a toolkit which hosts a large variety of multivariate classification\nalgorithms. Training, testing, performance evaluation and application of all\navailable classifiers is carried out simultaneously via user-friendly\ninterfaces. With version 4, TMVA has been extended to multivariate regression\nof a real-valued target vector. Regression is invoked through the same user\ninterfaces as classification. TMVA 4 also features more flexible data handling\nallowing one to arbitrarily form combined MVA methods.
