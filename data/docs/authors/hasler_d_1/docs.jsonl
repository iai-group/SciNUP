In particular, it has been predicted on the\nbasis of the Harris criterion that disorder is relevant (annealed and quenched\nmodel have different critical points and critical exponents) if the return\nprobability exponent alpha, a positive number that characterizes the model, is\nlarger than 1/2. Weak disorder has been predicted to be irrelevant (i.e.\ncoinciding critical points and exponents) if alpha < 1/2. Recent mathematical\nwork has put these predictions on firm grounds. In renormalization group terms,\nthe case alpha = 1/2 is a 'marginal case' and there is no agreement in the\nliterature as to whether one should expect disorder relevance or irrelevance at\nmarginality. The question is particularly intriguing also because the case\nalpha = 1/2 includes the classical models of two-dimensional wetting of a rough\nsubstrate, of pinning of directed polymers on a defect line in dimension (3+1)\nor (1+1) and of pinning of an heteropolymer by a point potential in\nthree-dimensional space.

By assuming a bilinear oscillator-field interaction, we derive a coupled\nset of equations for the oscillator's and the field's Heisenberg operators.

In case of discrete\nPainlev\\'{e} equations, we prove that an finite field analog of the Sakai\ntheory can be applied to construct the space of initial conditions. The other\nmethod is to define the equations over the field of $p$-adic numbers and then\nreduce them to the finite fields. The mapping whose time evolutions commute\nwith the reduction is said to have a `good reduction'. We generalize good\nreduction in order to be applied to integrable mappings. The generalized good\nreduction is formulated as `almost good reduction' and is proved to be a\n$p$-adic analog of the singularity confinement test. (*Note that this paper is\nintended for the author's thesis and it draws from several of our already\npublished papers. Also note that several minor modifications have been made\nfrom the original thesis.) \n\n"}

Genetic regulatory networks are therefore frequently modeled as\nstochastic birth-death processes with delay.

From the\nperspective of Schur-Weyl duality, it becomes evident that the computation of\nmatrix integrals over the unitary group is intricately intertwined with the\nso-called Weingarten function.

We focus on implementations without\nuncontrolled errors induced by the environment. This allows us to rigorously\nprove a quantum advantage. The first strategy uses a classical-to-quantum\nmapping, where the equilibrium properties of a classical system in $d$ spatial\ndimensions can be determined from the ground state properties of a quantum\nsystem also in $d$ spatial dimensions.

The best constants are expressed in the variational form as well as in\nterms of the ground state solutions of the corresponding nonlinear subelliptic\nequations. The orders of these equations can be high depending on the Sobolev\nspace order in the Sobolev or Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities, or may be\nfractional. Applications are obtained also to equations with lower order terms\ngiven by different hypoelliptic operators. Already in the case of $\\mathbb\nR^n$, the obtained results extend the classical relations by Weinstein to a\nwide range of nonlinear elliptic equations of high orders with elliptic low\norder terms and a wide range of interpolation inequalities of\nGagliardo-Nirenberg type. However, the proofs are different from those ivy\nWeinstein because of the impossibility of using the rearrangement inequalities\nalready in the setting of the Heisenberg group. The considered class of graded\ngroups is the most general class of nilpotent Lie groups where one can still\nconsider hypoelliptic homogeneous invariant differential operators and the\ncorresponding subelliptic differential equations. \n\n"}

The originality of this work resides in that this new notion\nof hypercontractivity is given in terms of the so-called amalgamated\n$\\mathbb{L}_p$ norms introduced recently by Junge and Parcet in the context of\noperator spaces theory. We make three main contributions. The first one is a\nversion of Gross' integration lemma: we prove that (weak) HC implies (weak)\nLSI. Surprisingly, the converse implication differs from the primitive case as\nwe show that LSI implies HC but with a weak constant equal to the cardinal of\nthe center of the decoherence-free algebra. Building on the first implication,\nour second contribution is the fact that strong LSI and therefore strong HC do\nnot hold for non-trivially primitive QMS. This implies that the amalgamated\n$\\mathbb{L}_p$ norms are not uniformly convex for $1\\leq p \\leq 2$. As a third\ncontribution, we derive universal bounds on the (weak) logarithmic Sobolev\nconstants for a QMS on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, using a similar\nmethod as Diaconis and Saloff-Coste in the case of classical primitive Markov\nchains, and Temme, Pastawski and Kastoryano in the case of primitive QMS.

The bias of an XOR game under local or global strategies\nis shown to be given by a certain injective or projective tensor norm,\nrespectively. The intrinsic (i.e.\\ model-independent) advantage of global over\nlocal strategies is thus connected to a universal function $r(n,m)$ called\n'projective-injective ratio'. This is defined as the minimal constant $\\rho$\nsuch that $\\|\\cdot\\|_{X\\otimes_\\pi Y}\\leq\\rho\\,\\|\\cdot\\|_{X\\otimes_\\varepsilon\nY}$ holds for all Banach spaces of dimensions $\\dim X=n$ and $\\dim Y=m$, where\n$X\\otimes_\\pi Y$ and $X \\otimes_\\varepsilon Y$ are the projective and injective\ntensor products. By requiring that $X=Y$, one obtains a symmetrised version of\nthe above ratio, denoted by $r_s(n)$. We prove that $r(n,m)\\geq 19/18$ for all\n$n,m\\geq 2$, implying that injective and projective tensor products are never\nisometric. We then study the asymptotic behaviour of $r(n,m)$ and $r_s(n)$,\nshowing that, up to log factors: $r_s(n)$ is of the order $\\sqrt{n}$ (which is\nsharp); $r(n,n)$ is at least of the order $n^{1/6}$; and $r(n,m)$ grows at\nleast as $\\min\\{n,m\\}^{1/8}$.

We show that it is a good definition in the following sense: (1)\nIt divides the set of states into equivalent classes and it establishes a\npartial order between those according to their level of \"topological\ncomplexity\". (2) It provides a path between any two states belonging to the\nsame phase where observables behave smoothly. We then focus on pure states to\nrelate the new definition in this particular case with the usual definition for\nquantum phases of closed systems in terms of the existence of a gapped path of\nHamiltonians connecting both states in the corresponding ground state path.

We\ndemonstrate that this is indeed the case provided one chooses an appropriate\nregularization of the effective LL theory.

We start with derivation of an exact RG equation which is analogous\nto the Wilsonian RG equations in statistical physics and quantum field theory.\nIt is clarified that the perturbative RG method constructs invariant manifolds\nsuccessively as the initial value of evolution equations, thereby the meaning\nto set $t_0=t$ is naturally understood where $t_0$ is the arbitrary initial\ntime. We show that the integral constants in the unperturbative solution\nconstitutes natural coordinates of the invariant manifold when the linear\noperator $A$ in the evolution equation has no Jordan cell; when $A$ has a\nJordan cell, a slight modification is necessary because the dimension of the\ninvariant manifold is increased by the perturbation. The RG equation determines\nthe slow motion of the would-be integral constants in the unperturbative\nsolution on the invariant manifold. We present the mechanical procedure to\nconstruct the perturbative solutions hence the initial values with which the RG\nequation gives meaningful results.

They are, e.g. the\nstarting point for the semi-classical operational approach by Noh, Fougeres and\nMandel (NFM) to the old and notorious phase problem in quantum optics.\nFollowing a recent group theoretical quantization of the symplectic space S =\n{(phi in R mod 2pi, p > 0)} in terms of irreducible unitary representations of\nthe group SO(1,2) the present paper applies those results to that controversial\nproblem of quantizing moduli and phases of complex numbers: The Poisson\nbrackets of the classical observables p cos\\phi, -p sin\\phi and p > 0 form the\nLie algebra of the group SO(1,2). The corresponding self-adjoint generators\nK_1, K_2 and K_3 of that group may be obtained from its irreducible unitary\nrepresentations. For the positive discrete series the modulus operator K_3 has\nthe spectrum {k+n, n = 0, 1,2,...; k > 0}. Self-adjoint operators for cos phi\nand sin phi can be defined as ((1/K_3)K_1 + K_1/K_3)/2 and -((1/K_3)K_2 +\nK_2/K_3)/2 which have the theoretically desired properties for k > or = 0.5.\nThe approach advocated here solves, e.g. the modulus-phase quantization problem\nfor the harmonic oscillator and appears to provide a full quantum theoretical\nbasis for the NFM-formalism. \n\n"}

We use this basis to\nconstruct the observables O of the quantum mechanics based on H.

This is achieved by a proper convex roof extension of the squared\nlogarithmic negativity. We prove that the contangle satisfies the\nCoffman-Kundu-Wootters monogamy inequality in all three--mode Gaussian states,\nand in all fully symmetric $N$--mode Gaussian states, for arbitrary $N$.

Theoretical Background Abstract: The paper deals with the projective line over the finite factor ring\n$R\\_{\\clubsuit} \\equiv$ GF(2)[$x$]/$<x^{3} - x>$. The line is endowed with 18\npoints, spanning the neighbourhoods of three pairwise distant points. As\n$R\\_{\\clubsuit}$ is not a local ring, the neighbour (or parallel) relation is\nnot an equivalence relation so that the sets of neighbour points to two distant\npoints overlap. There are nine neighbour points to any point of the line,\nforming three disjoint families under the reduction modulo either of two\nmaximal ideals of the ring. Two of the families contain four points each and\nthey swap their roles when switching from one ideal to the other; the points of\nthe one family merge with (the image of) the point in question, while the\npoints of the other family go in pairs into the remaining two points of the\nassociated ordinary projective line of order two.

In this work we\nintroduce a natural and compelling fourth assumption: if there is no reason to\nprefer one region of the configuration space over another then they should be\n`weighted' equally. This is the last ingredient necessary to introduce a unique\ninner product in the linear space of wave functions. Thus, a form of the\nprinciple of insufficient reason is implicit in the Hilbert inner product.\nArmed with the inner product we obtain two results. First, we elaborate on an\nearlier proof of the Born probability rule. The implicit appeal to insufficient\nreason shows that quantum probabilities are not more objective than classical\nprobabilities. Previously we had argued that the consistent manipulation of\namplitudes leads to a linear time evolution; our second result is that time\nevolution must also be unitary. The argument is straightforward and hinges on\nthe conservation of entropy. The only subtlety consists of defining the correct\nentropy; it is the array entropy, not von Neumann's. After unitary evolution\nhas been established we proceed to introduce the useful notion of observables\nand we explore how von Neumann's entropy can be linked to Shannon's information\ntheory.
