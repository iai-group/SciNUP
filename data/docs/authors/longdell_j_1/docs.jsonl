At the dynamical level, the transition corresponds to\na collapse of the excitation spectrum at a critical point. At the static level,\nthe transition affects the ground state wavefunction: while in some cases it\ncould be picked up by the expectation value of a local operator, in others the\norder may be non-local, and impossible to be determined with any local probe.\nHere we propose instead to use concepts from quantum information theory that\nare not centered around local order parameters, such as fidelity and\nentanglement measures.

Of the subsidiary claims, the four\nmain ones (each shared with some other authors) are: (i): I defend the\ntraditional Nagelian conception of reduction (Section 3); (ii): I deny that the\nmultiple realizability argument causes trouble for reductions, or\n\"reductionism\" (Section 4); (iii): I stress the collapse of supervenience into\ndeduction via Beth's theorem (Section 5.1); (iv): I adapt some examples already\nin the literature to show supervenience without emergence and vice versa\n(Section 5.2). \n\n"}

In a kinetic scaling\nlimit, the Hubbard model can be associated with a matrix-valued Boltzmann\nequation, the Hubbard-Boltzmann equation. Its collision operator is a sum of\ntwo qualitatively different terms: The first term is similar to the collision\noperator of the fermionic Boltzmann-Nordheim equation. The second term leads to\na momentum-dependent rotation of the spin basis. The rotation is determined by\na principal value integral which depends quadratically on the state of the\nsystem and might become singular for non-smooth states. In this paper, we prove\nthat the spatially homogeneous equation nevertheless has global solutions in\nL^\\infty(T^d,C^{2x2}) for any initial data W_0 which satisfies the \"Fermi\nconstraint\" in the sense that 0 <= W_0 <= 1 almost everywhere.

For the proof, we need to make a number of assumptions about the\nlattice dispersion relation which, however, are satisfied by the nearest\nneighbor Hubbard model, provided that d >= 3.

Our results show that the internal energy shift is positive, it\nvanishes in the two limits of zero and infinite coupling (respectively the\nideal Bose and the Tonks Girardeau gas) and it has a maximum at a finite,\ntemperature depending, value of the coupling. Remarkably, at fixed coupling the\nenergy shift density saturates to a finite value for infinite temperature.

Intuitively, one considers given\nmeasurements to be incompatible within a framework of a physical theory, if\ntheir simultaneous implementation on a single physical device is prohibited by\nthe theory itself. In the mathematical language of quantum theory, measurements\nare described by POVMs (positive operator valued measures), and given POVMs are\nby definition incompatible if they cannot be obtained via coarse-graining from\na single common POVM; this notion generalizes noncommutativity of projective\nmeasurements. In quantum theory, incompatibility can be regarded as a resource\nnecessary for manifesting phenomena such as Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)\nBell inequality violations or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering which do\nnot have classical explanation. We define operational ways of quantifying this\nresource via the amount of added classical noise needed to render the\nmeasurements compatible, i.e., useless as a resource. In analogy to\nentanglement measures, we generalize this idea by introducing the concept of\nincompatibility measure, which is monotone in local operations.

In recent years, an\nexquisite experimental control in the time domain was gained through the\nparameters entering the Hamiltonian, and high-fidelity readout schemes allowed\nthe state of the system to be monitored non-destructively. These developments\nwere made in the field of quantum devices, especially in superconducting\nqubits, as a well as in atomic physics, in particular in ultracold gases. As a\nresult of these advances, it became possible to demonstrate many of the\nfundamental effects that arise in a quantum system when its transition\nfrequencies are modulated. The purpose of this review is to present some of\nthese developments, from two-state atoms and harmonic oscillators to multilevel\nand many-particle systems. \n\n"}

We analyze a simple closed causal loop\nensuing from the interaction between two systems with opposing thermodynamic\ntime arrows, such that each system can forecast future events for the other.\nThe loop is avoided by the fact that the choice to abort an event thus\nforecasted leads to the destruction of the forecaster's past. Physical law\ntherefore enables prophecy of future events only as long as this prophecy is\nnot revealed to a free agent who can otherwise render it false. This resolution\nis demonstrated on an earlier finding derived from the Two-State-Vector\nFormalism (TSVF), where a weak measurement's outcome anticipates a future\nchoice, yet this anticipation becomes apparent only after the choice has been\nactually made. To quantify this assertion, \"weak information\" is described in\nterms of Fisher information. We conclude that an already existing future does\nnot exclude free will nor invoke causal paradoxes.

The dependence of the Hamiltonian and the system-field\ncoupling operators on the system variables is represented using the Weyl\nfunctional calculus.

Even if the constraints at the level of\ninflation are weak, such as observable statistical independences implied by\ndisjoint causal ancestry, the translated constraints can be strong. We apply\nthis method to derive new inequalities whose violation by a distribution\nwitnesses that distribution's incompatibility with the causal structure (of\nwhich Bell inequalities and Pearl's instrumental inequality are prominent\nexamples). We describe an algorithm for deriving all such inequalities for the\noriginal causal structure that follow from ancestral independences in the\ninflation.

Based on the OTOCs, three different concepts --\nquantum chaos, holographic duality, and information scrambling -- are found to\nbe intimately related to each other. Despite of its theoretical importance, the\nexperimental measurement of the OTOC is quite challenging and so far there is\nno experimental measurement of the OTOC for local operators.

Recently, machine learning techniques, in the form of\nrestricted Boltzmann machines, have been proposed as a way to efficiently\nrepresent certain quantum states with applications in state tomography and\nground state estimation. Here, we introduce a new representation of states\nbased on variational autoencoders. Variational autoencoders are a type of\ngenerative model in the form of a neural network. We probe the power of this\nrepresentation by encoding probability distributions associated with states\nfrom different classes. Our simulations show that deep networks give a better\nrepresentation for states that are hard to sample from, while providing no\nbenefit for random states. This suggests that the probability distributions\nassociated to hard quantum states might have a compositional structure that can\nbe exploited by layered neural networks.

This problem is critical in high-accuracy spectroscopy or for the next\ngeneration of atomic optical clocks. Ultra-high resolution frequency metrology\nrequires sophisticated interrogation schemes and robust protocols handling\npulse length errors and residual frequency detuning offsets . This review\nreports recent progress and perspective in such schemes, using sequences of\ncomposite laser-pulses tailored in pulse duration, frequency and phase,\ninspired by NMR techniques and quantum information processing. After a short\npresentation of Rabi technique and NMR-like composite pulses allowing efficient\ncompensation of electromagnetic field perturbations to achieve robust\npopulation transfers, composite laser-pulses are investigated within Ramsey's\nmethod of separated oscillating fields in order to generate non-linear\ncompensation of probe-induced frequency shifts. Laser-pulses protocols such as\nHyper-Ramsey (HR), Modified Hyper-Ramsey (MHR), Generalized Hyper-Ramsey (GHR)\nand hybrid schemes are reviewed. These techniques provide excellent protection\nagainst both probe induced light-shift perturbations and laser intensity\nvariations.

They allow to reduce or completely eliminate imperfect\ncorrection of probe-induced frequency-shifts even in presence of decoherence\ndue to the laser line-width. Finally, two universal protocols are presented\nwhich provide complete elimination of probe-induced frequency shifts in the\ngeneral case where both decoherence and relaxation dissipation effects are\npresent by using exact analytic expressions for phase-shifts and the clock\nfrequency detuning.

This upsurge of research has been prompted by the modified\nuncertainty relation brought about in the framework of string theory. In\ngeneral, the implementation of minimum length in QM can be done either by\nmodification of position and momentum operators or by restriction of their\ndomains. In the former case we have the so called soccer-ball problem when the\nnaive classical limit appears to be drastically different from the usual one.\nStarting with the latter possibility, an alternative approach was suggested in\nthe form of a band-limited QM. However, applying momentum cutoff to the\nwave-function, one faces the problem of incompatibility with the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation. One can overcome this problem in a natural fashion by\nappropriately modifying Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. But incompatibility takes\nplace for boundary conditions as well.

Contrary to some misinterpretations of the Principle, the mere\ntransfer of entropy between computational and non-computational subsystems can\noccur in a thermodynamically reversible way without increasing total entropy.\nHowever, Landauer's Principle is not about general entropy transfers; rather,\nit more specifically concerns the ejection of (all or part of) some correlated\ninformation from a controlled, digital form (e.g., a computed bit) to an\nuncontrolled, non-computational form, i.e., as part of a thermal environment.\nAny uncontrolled thermal system will, by definition, continually re-randomize\nthe physical information in its thermal state, from our perspective as\nobservers who cannot predict the exact dynamical evolution of the microstates\nof such environments. Thus, any correlations involving information that is\nejected into and subsequently thermalized by the environment will be lost from\nour perspective, resulting directly in an irreversible increase in total\nentropy.

In classical test and verification one\ndevelops a test set separating a correct circuit from a circuit containing any\nconsidered fault. Classical faults are modelled at the logical level by fault\nmodels that act on classical states. The stuck fault model, thought of as a\nlead connected to a power rail or to a ground, is most typically considered. A\nclassical test set complete for the stuck fault model propagates both binary\nbasis states, 0 and 1, through all nodes in a network and is known to detect\nmany physical faults. A classical test set complete for the stuck fault model\nallows all circuit nodes to be completely tested and verifies the function of\nmany gates. It is natural to ask if one may adapt any of the known classical\nmethods to test quantum circuits. Of course, classical fault models do not\ncapture all the logical failures found in quantum circuits. The first obstacle\nfaced when using methods from classical test is developing a set of realistic\nquantum-logical fault models. Developing fault models to abstract the test\nproblem away from the device level motivated our study. Several results are\nestablished. First, we describe typical modes of failure present in the\nphysical design of quantum circuits.

Our exact\nresults also demonstrate in an unambiguous way that the pointer states in this\nmeasurement model emerge independent of the initial state of the apparatus. \n\n"}

Choose a conjugation and consider the dependence of fidelity or of\nconcurrence on conjugated pairs of density operators. These functions turn out\nto be concave or convex roofs. Optimal decompositions are constructed. Some\napplications to two- and tripartite systems illustrate the general theorem. \n\n"}

If the partial inner product of a basis (belonging to a\nHilbert space of smaller dimension) with the state of the composite system\ngives a disentangled basis, then the Schmidt decomposition for a tripartite\nsystem exists.
