We\nmotivate degravitation-- where Netwon's constant is promoted to a scale\ndependent filter function-- as arising from either a small (resonant) mass for\nthe graviton, or as an effect in semi-classical gravity. After addressing how\nthe Bianchi identities are to be satisfied in such a set up, we turn our\nattention towards the cosmological consequences of degravitation. By\nconsidering the example filter function corresponding to a resonantly massive\ngraviton (with a filter scale larger than the present horizon scale), we show\nthat slow roll inflation, hybrid inflation and old inflation remain\nquantitatively unchanged. We also find that the degravitation mechanism\ninherits a memory of past energy densities in the present epoch in such a way\nthat is likely significant for present cosmological evolution. For example, if\nthe universe underwent inflation in the past due to it having tunneled out of\nsome false vacuum, we find that degravitation implies a remnant `afterglow'\ncosmological constant, whose scale immediately afterwards is parametrically\nsuppressed by the filter scale ($L$) in Planck units $\\Lambda \\sim\nl^2_{pl}/L^2$.

If elementary scalar fields play a role in the fundamental\ntheory (such as Higgs fields in the Standard Model coupled to gravity), then\ntheir shadows in d dimensions must necessarily be conformal scalars.

{"id": "0806.4006", "contents": "Title: E\\\"otv\\\"os branes Abstract: The high value of brane tension has a crucial role in recovering Einstein's\ngeneral relativity at low energies. In the framework of a recently developed\nformalism with variable brane tension one can pose the question, whether it was\nalways that high? In analogy with fluid membranes, in this paper we allow for\ntemperature dependent brane tension, according to the corresponding law\nestablished by E\\\"otv\\\"os. For cosmological branes this assumption leads to\nseveral immediate consequences: (a) The brane Universe was created at a finite\ntemperature $T_{c}$ and scale factor $a_{\\min}$. (b) Both the brane tension and\nthe 4-dimensional gravitational coupling 'constant' increase with the scale\nfactor from zero to asymptotic values. (c) The 4-dimensional cosmological\n'constant' evolves with $a$, starting with a huge negative value, passing\nthrough zero, finally reaching a small positive value. Such a scale-factor\ndependent cosmological constant is able to generate a surplus of attraction at\nsmall $a$ (as dark matter does) and a late-time repulsion at large $a$ (dark\nenergy). In the particular toy model discussed here the evolution of the brane\ntension is compensated by energy interchange between the brane and the fifth\ndimension, such that the continuity equation holds for the cosmological fluid.\nThe resulting cosmology closely mimics the standard model at late times, a\ndecelerated phase being followed by an accelerated expansion. The energy\nabsorption of the brane drives the 5D space-time towards maximal symmetry,\nbecoming Anti de Sitter. \n\n"}

Among the dominant\nphases generated by quantum effects are commensurate and incommensurate\ncoplanar quasi-ordered states, which appear in the vicinity of the isotropic\nregion for most fields, and in the high field region for most anisotropies. The\ncoplanar states, while not classical ground states, can be understood\nsemiclassically.

The\nlogarithmic minimal models LM(p,p') comprise a subfamily of the TL loop models\nfor which the crossing parameter lambda=(p'-p)pi/p' is parameterised by coprime\nintegers 0<p<p'.

The\ndispersion relation around this point is fully relativistic and the $3\\times3$\nmatrices in the corresponding effective Hamiltonian satisfy the\nDuffin-Kemmer-Petiau algebra. We show the robustness of the topologically\nprotected edge states by employing the entanglement spectrum. Moreover, we\nprove that the Chern number of the lowest band is robust with respect to weak\ndisorder. For its simplicity, our model can be naturally implemented in real\nphysical systems like cold atoms in optical lattices. \n\n"}

Here we challenge this\n\"lore\" by investigating the decoupling limit of Gauss-Bonnet gravity as an\nexample, in which the scalar field couples linearly to the Gauss-Bonnet density\nin the action. We prove a theorem that neutron stars in this theory cannot\npossess a scalar charge. Thus Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the strong binary\npulsar constraints on dipole radiation.

Van der Waals like\nphase transitions are found for both of them. Coexistent curves of reduced\npressure and reduced temperature are found to be different from that of RN-AdS\nblack holes.

A locally Lorentz covariant\n$f(T)$ gravity theory has been devised recently, and this local causality\nproblem has been overcome. The nonlocal question, however, is left open. If\ngravitation is to be described by this covariant $f(T)$ gravity theory there\nare a number of issues that ought to be examined in its context, including the\nquestion as to whether its field equations allow homogeneous G\\\"odel-type\nsolutions, which necessarily leads to violation of causality on nonlocal scale.\nHere, to look into the potentialities and difficulties of the covariant $f(T)$\ntheories, we examine whether they admit G\\\"odel-type solutions. We take a\ncombination of a perfect fluid with electromagnetic plus a scalar field as\nsource, and determine a general G\\\"odel-type solution, which contains special\nsolutions in which the essential parameter of G\\\"odel-type geometries, $m^2$,\ndefines any class of homogeneous G\\\"odel-type geometries.

We also shown that the\nsingle massless scalar field generates G\\\"odel-type solution with no closed\ntimelike curves. Even though the covariant $f(T)$ gravity restores Lorentz\ncovariance of the field equations and the local validity of the causality\nprinciple, the bare existence of the G\\\"odel-type solutions makes apparent that\nthe covariant formulation of $f(T)$ gravity does not preclude non-local\nviolation of causality in the form of closed timelike curves. \n\n"}

In the\ncase of black rings, we study their stability properties in the region of\nparameter space that has so far remained inaccessible to numerical approaches.\nIn particular, we show that very thin (ultraspinning) black rings exhibit a\nGregory-Laflamme instability, giving strong evidence that black rings are\nunstable in the entire range of parameter space.

In near-critical quantum circuits, entropy flows as a locally\nconserved quantum current, obeying circuit laws analogous to the electric\ncircuit laws.

The action and\nvariational equations are manifestly well defined in the Hamiltonian\nrepresentation, with the momentum fields consequently being complex. The\ncomplex action interpolates between the Lorentzian and Riemannian actions as\nthey appear formally in the respective path integrals. Thus the complex-lapse\ntheory provides a unified basis for a path-integral quantum theory of gravity\ninvolving both Lorentzian and Riemannian aspects. A major motivation is the\nquantum-tunnelling scenario for the origin of the universe. Taken as an\nexplanation for the observed quantum tunnelling of particles, the complex-lapse\ntheory determines that the argument of the lapse for the universe now is\nextremely small but negative. \n\n"}

It may\noccur in an expanding universe if the initial amplitude of oscillations of the\ninflaton field is large enough. We investigate a simple model of a massive\ninflaton field coupled to another scalar field X. Parametric resonance in this\nmodel is very broad. It occurs in a very unusual stochastic manner, which is\ndifferent from the parametric resonance in the case when the expansion of the\nuniverse is neglected. Quantum fields interacting with the oscillating inflaton\nfield experience a series of kicks which occur with phases uncorrelated to each\nother. We call this process stochastic resonance. We develop the theory of\npreheating taking into account the expansion of the universe and backreaction\nof produced particles, including the effects of rescattering. The process of\npreheating can be divided into several distinct stages. At the first stage the\nbackreaction of created particles is not important.

It is conjectured that the quantum laws of\nthe real world may be understood from exactly such a procedure. \n\n"}

For all D=4\nsupergravities (with N >= 3) there is a universal field theoretical mechanism\npromoting the extension, which relies on the coexistence of two non locally\nrelated lagrangian descriptions. This provides a Chevalley-Serre presentation\nof the affine Kac Moody algebra which follows a universal pattern for all\nsupergravities and is an extension of the mechanism considered by Nicolai for\npure N=1 supergravity. There are new distinctive features in extended theories\nrelated to the presence of vector fields and to their symplectic description.\nThe novelty is that in supergravity the so named Matzner-Missner description is\nstructurally different from the Ehlers one with gauge 0--forms subject to\nSO(2n,2n) electric--magnetic duality rotations representing in D=2 the Sp(2n,R)\nrotations of D=4.

The number of times the singlet occurs in the decomposition is the\nassociated multiplicity. In this framework, ordinary tensor products correspond\nto three-point couplings.

The mean square\ndisplacement for non-zero Planck's constant, and finite time, exhibits a\ncrossover from diffusive to ballistic motion, with crossover time on the order\nof the inverse of Planck's constant.

The set of permutation's partial\ntransposes is an algebra called the \"PPT\" algebra which guides the construction\nof multipartite symmetric states.
