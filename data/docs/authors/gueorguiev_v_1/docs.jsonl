{"id": "0810.5346", "contents": "Title: Where in the String Landscape is Quintessence Abstract: We argue that quintessence may reside in certain corners of the string\nlandscape. It arises as a linear combination of internal space components of\nhigher rank forms, which are axion-like at low energies, and may mix with\n4-forms after compactification of the Chern-Simons terms to 4D due to internal\nspace fluxes. The mixing induces an effective mass term, with an action which\n{\\it preserves} the axion shift symmetry, breaking it spontaneously after the\nbackground selection. With several axions, several 4-forms, and a low string\nscale, as in one of the setups already invoked for dynamically explaining a\ntiny residual vacuum energy in string theory, the 4D mass matrix generated by\nrandom fluxes may have ultralight eigenmodes over the landscape, which are\nquintessence. We illustrate how this works in simplest cases, and outline how\nto get the lightest mass to be comparable to the Hubble scale now, $H_0 \\sim\n10^{-33} {\\rm eV}$. The shift symmetry protects the smallest mass from\nperturbative corrections in field theory. Further, if the ultralight eigenmode\ndoes not couple directly to any sector strongly coupled at a high scale, the\nnon-perturbative field theory corrections to its potential will also be\nsuppressed. Finally, if the compactification length is larger than the string\nlength by more than an order of magnitude, the gravitational corrections may\nremain small too, even when the field value approaches $M_{Pl}$. \n\n"}

By adjusting the parameters to\nreproduce the pairing properties of the Gogny force in nuclear matter, this\nseparable pairing force is successful in depicting the pairing properties of\nground states and vibrational excitations of spherical nuclei on almost the\nsame footing as the original Gogny force. In this article, we extend these\ninvestigations for Relativistic Hartree Bogoliubov theory in deformed nuclei\nwith axial symmetry (RHBZ) using the same separable pairing interaction. In\norder to preserve translational invariance we construct one- and\ntwo-dimensional Talmi-Moshinsky brackets for the cylindrical harmonic\noscillator basis. We show that the matrix elements of this force can then be\nexpanded in a series of separable terms. The convergence of this expansion is\ninvestigated for various deformations.

This allows for a considerable reduction in computing time as\ncompared to RHBZ-calculations with the full Gogny force in the pairing channel.\nAs an example we solve the RHBZ equations with this separable pairing force for\nthe ground states of the chain of Sm-isotopes.

Quantification\nproceeds by selecting two chains of coordinated events, each of which\nrepresents an observer, and assigning a valuation to each chain. Events can be\nprojected onto each chain by identifying the earliest event on the chain that\ncan be informed about the event. In this way, each event can be quantified by a\npair of numbers, referred to a pair, that derives from the valuations on the\nchains. Pairs can be decomposed into a sum of symmetric and antisymmetric\npairs, which correspond to time-like and space-like coordinates. From this\npair, we derive a scalar measure and show that this is the Minkowski metric.\nThe Lorentz transformations follow, as well as the fact that speed is a\nrelevant quantity relating two inertial frames, and that there exists a maximal\nspeed, which is invariant in all inertial frames. All results follow directly\nfrom the Event Postulate and the adopted quantification scheme. \n\n"}

Then we\nconcentrate on considering the DVG models derived by reductions of D=3 and D=4\naffine theories. In particular, we introduce the most general cylindrical\nreductions that are often ignored. The main subject of our study is the static\nsolutions with horizons. We formulate the general conditions for the existence\nof the regular horizons and find the solutions of the static DVG/DSG near the\nhorizons in the form of locally convergent power - series expansion. For an\narbitrary regular horizon, we find a local generalization of the Szekeres -\nKruskal coordinates. Finally, we consider one-dimensional integrable and\nnonintegrable DSG theories with one scalar. We analyze simplest models having\nthree or two integrals of motion, respectively, and introduce the idea of a\n`topological portrait' giving a unified qualitative description of static and\ncosmological solutions of some simple DSG models. \n\n"}

Here it is described in more detail. The scenario takes\ninto account the interaction between superfluid inertial modes and the normal\n(quadrupole) $m=2$ $r$-mode, which can be driven unstable by\nChandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) mechanism. This interaction can only occur\nat some fixed \"resonance\" stellar temperatures; it leads to formation of the\n\"stability peaks\" which stabilize a star in the vicinity of these temperatures.\nWe demonstrate that a NS in LMXB spends a substantial fraction of time on the\nstability peak, that is, in the region of stellar temperatures and spin\nfrequencies, that has been previously thought to be CFS unstable with respect\nto excitation of $r$-modes. We also find that the spin frequencies of NSs are\nlimited by the CFS instability of normal (octupole) $m=3$ $r$-mode rather than\nby $m=2$ $r$-mode. This result agrees with the predicted value of the cutoff\nspin frequency $\\sim 730$ Hz in the spin distribution of accreting millisecond\nX-ray pulsars. In addition, we analyze evolution of a NS after the end of the\naccretion phase and demonstrate that millisecond pulsars can be born in LMXBs\nwithin our scenario. Besides millisecond pulsars, our scenario also predicts a\nnew class of LMXB descendants - hot and rapidly rotating nonaccreting NSs (\"hot\nwidows\"/HOFNARs).

Formulas\nfor the moments up to order four are also derived for systems with two types of\nspinless fermions and a transition operator similar to beta decay and\nneutrinoless beta decay operators. Moments formulas are also derived for\ntransition operator that removes $k_0$ number of particles from $m$ fermion\nsystem. Numerical results obtained using the exact formulas for two-body\n($k=2$) Hamiltonians (in some examples for $k=3,4$) and the asymptotic formulas\nclearly establish that in general the smoothed form of the bivariate transition\nstrength densities take bivariate Gaussian form for isolated finite quantum\nsystems. Extensions of these results to bosonic systems and EGUE ensembles with\nfurther symmetries are discussed. \n\n"}

In spontaneous fission, half-lives are the main observables\nand quantum tunnelling the essential concept, while in induced fission the\nfocus is on fragment properties and explicitly time-dependent approaches are\nneeded. The cornerstone of the current microscopic theory of fission is the\nenergy density functional formalism. Its basic tenets, including tools such as\nthe HFB theory, effective two-body effective nuclear potentials,\nfinite-temperature extensions and beyond mean-field corrections, are presented\nsuccinctly. The EDF approach is often combined with the hypothesis that the\ntime-scale of the large amplitude collective motion driving the system to\nfission is slow compared to typical time-scales of nucleons inside the nucleus.\nIn practice, this hypothesis of adiabaticity is implemented by introducing (a\nfew) collective variables and mapping out the many-body Schr\\\"odinger equation\ninto a collective Schr\\\"odinger-like equation for the nuclear wave-packet.\nScission configurations indicate where the split occurs.

It has been argued that this is an\nanalogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves\n(CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that\nfulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent\nliterature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework\nof quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag\nand Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states\nwhich are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for\na certain class of processes and initial conditions. On the other hand, if a\nquantum field theory admits sufficiently many uncorrelated states across\nacausally related spacetime regions (as implied by the split property), then\nthe D-CTC condition can always be fulfilled approximately to arbitrary\nprecision.

The result\nrelies on the knowledge of the recoupling theory between finite-dimensional and\ninfinite-dimensional irreducible representations of the group; here the\npreviously unconsidered cases of the 3D and 4D Lorentz groups are investigated\nin detail. As an application, the Wigner-Eckart theorem is used to generalise\nthe Jordan-Schwinger representation of SU(2) to both groups, for all\nrepresentation classes. Next, the results obtained for the 3D Lorentz group are\napplied to (2+1) Lorentzian loop quantum gravity to develop an analogue of the\nwell-known spinorial approach used in the Euclidean case. Tensor operators are\nused to construct observables and to generalise the Hamiltonian constraint\nintroduced by Bonzom and Livine (2012) for 3D gravity to the Lorentzian case.\nThe Ponzano-Regge amplitude is shown to be a solution of this constraint by\nrecovering the (opportunely generalised) Biedenharn-Elliott relations.

Here we focus on the astrophysical signatures of heavy\nneutron-capture elements made in the s-, i- and r-process found in old stars. A\nhighlight is the recently discovered r-process galaxy Reticulum II that was\napparently enriched by a neutron star merger. These results show that old stars\nin dwarf galaxies provide a novel means to constrain the astrophysical site of\nthe r-process, ushering in much needed progress on this major outstanding\nquestion. This nuclear astrophysics work complements the many nuclear physics\nefforts into heavy-element formation, and aligns with recent results on the\ngravitational wave signature of a neutron star merger. \n\n"}

Feng et\nal. have suggested that, at high ambient de Sitter temperature, the rate may be\nstrongly enhanced, due to large degeneracy factors associated with the number\nof light species living on the worldsheet. This might facilitate the quick\nrelaxation from a large effective cosmological constant down to the observed\nvalue. Here, we analyse this possibility in some detail. In four dimensions,\nand after the moduli are stabilized, branes interact via repulsive long range\nforces. Because of that, the Coleman-de Luccia (CdL) instanton for coincident\nbrane nucleation may not exist, unless there is some short range interaction\nwhich keeps the branes together. If the CdL instanton exists, we find that the\ndegeneracy factor depends only mildly on the ambient de Sitter temperature, and\ndoes not switch off even in the case of tunneling from flat space. This would\nresult in catastrophic decay of the present vacuum. If, on the contrary, the\nCdL instanton does not exist, coindident brane nucleation may still proceed\nthrough a \"static\" instanton, representing pair creation of critical bubbles --\na process somewhat analogous to thermal activation in flat space. In that case,\nthe branes may stick together due to thermal symmetry restoration, and the pair\ncreation rate depends exponentially on the ambient de Sitter temperature,\nswitching off sharply as the temperature approaches zero. Such static instanton\nmay be well suited for the \"saltatory\" relaxation scenario proposed by Feng et\nal. \n\n"}

For sub-critical tensions, the crossover scale, below which\ngravity may look 4D, and the effective 4D gravitational coupling are sensitive\nto vacuum energy. This shows how the vacuum energy problem manifests in brane\ninduced gravity: instead of tuning the 4D curvature, generically one must tune\nthe crossover scale.

The nuclear wave functions, both for the initial\nstate and all excited final states are obtained in the framework of 1s-0d shell\nmodel employing the well-known and tested Wildenthal realistic interaction. In\nthe case of the light intermediate neutrinos the transition rates to all\nexcited final states up to 25 MeV in energy are calculated. We find that the\nimaginary part of the amplitude is dominant. The total rate is calculated by\nsumming over all these partial transition strengths. We also find that the rate\ndue to the real part of the amplitude is much smaller than the corresponding\nquantity found previously by the closure approximation. \n\n"}
