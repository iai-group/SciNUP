Such equations are ubiquitous in string\nfield theory and have recently attracted considerable interest also from\ncosmologists. Though these equations have been studied in the classical\nmathematical literature, it appears that the physics community is largely\nunaware of the relevant formalism. Of particular importance is the fate of the\ninitial value problem. Under what circumstances do infinite order differential\nequations possess a well-defined initial value problem and how many initial\ndata are required? In this paper we study the initial value problem for\ninfinite order differential equations in the mathematical framework of the\nformal operator calculus, with analytic initial data. This formalism allows us\nto handle simultaneously a wide array of different nonlocal equations within a\nsingle framework and also admits a transparent physical interpretation.

First, we explore connections of exotic smoothings\nof R^4 and certain configurations of NS and D-branes, both classical and\n(generalized) quantum using C* algebras. Effects of some small exotic R^4's,\nwhen localized on S^3, correspond to stringy geometries of B-fields on S^3.\nExotic smoothness of R^4 acts as a non-vanishing B-field on S^3. The dynamics\nof D-branes in SU(2) WZW model at finite k indicates the exoticness of ambient\nR^4. Next, based on the relation of exotic smooth R^4 with integral levels of\nSU(2) WZW model we show the correspondence between exotic smoothness on\n4-space, transversal to the world volume of NS5 branes, and the number of these\nNS5 branes.

We find dark matter inside the star would soften the equation of\nstate more strongly than that of hyperons, and reduce largely the maximum mass\nof the star. However, the neutron star maximum mass is sensitive to the\nparticle mass of dark matter, and a very high neutron star mass larger than 2\ntimes solar mass could be achieved when the particle mass is small enough. Such\nkind of dark-matter- admixed neutron stars could explain the recent measurement\nof the Shapiro delay in the radio pulsar PSR J1614-2230, which yielded a\nneutron star mass of 2 times solar mass that may be hardly reached when\nhyperons are considered only, as in the case of the microscopic Brueckner\ntheory.

While the two-flavor effective models may be sufficient\nto describe the phenomenon of pion condensation, it is interesting to study the\nroles of the strangeness degree of freedom and the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly. In\nthis paper, we present a systematic study of the three-flavor\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model with a Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT) term that\nmimics the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly at finite isospin chemical potential. In the\nmean-field approximation, the model predicts a phase transition from the vacuum\nto the pion superfluid phase, which takes place at $\\mu_{\\rm I}$ equal to the\npion mass $m_\\pi$. Due to the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly, the strangeness degree of\nfreedom couples to the light quark degrees of freedom and the strange quark\neffective mass depends on the pion condensate. However, the strange quark\ncondensate and the strange quark effective mass change slightly in the pion\nsuperfluid phase, which verifies the validity of the two-flavor models. The\neffective four-fermion interaction of the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft term in\nthe presence of the pion condensation is constructed.

The standard cosmological model has\nmet the challenge of the high precision observations in cosmology and\nastroparticle physics. However these two standard models face both several\ntheoretical issues, such as the naturalness problem in the Higgs sector of the\nStandard Model, as well as observational issues, in particular the fact that an\nunknown kind of matter called Dark Matter accounts for the majority of the\nmatter content in our Universe. Attempts to solve such problems have led to the\ndevelopment of New Physics models during the last decades. Supersymmetry is one\nsuch model which addresses the fine-tuning problem in the Higgs sector and\nprovides viable Dark Matter candidates. Current high energy and high precision\nexperiments give many new opportunities to probe the supersymmetric models. It\nis in this context that this thesis is written. Considering the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the simplest supersymmetric extension of\nthe Standard Model of particle physics, and its conventional Dark Matter\ncandidate, the neutralino, it is shown that collider constraints could provide\ninformations on the very early Universe at the inflation area. It is also\ndemonstrated that the Indirect Detection of Dark Matter, despite several\ndrawbacks, can be a powerful technique to probe supersymmetric Dark Matter\nmodels.

For\nthe purpose we work on a metric in the gravity side, {\\em viz.} OKS-BH\ngeometry, whose dual in the gauge theory side runs with the energy and hence\nproves to be a better background for thermal QCD. The potential obtained has\nconfining term both in vacuum and in medium, in addition to the Coulomb term\nalone, usually reported in the literature. As the velocity of the pair is\nincreased the screening of the potential gets weakened, which may be understood\nby the decrease of effective temperature with the increase of velocity. The\ncrucial observation of our work is that beyond a critical separation of the\nheavy quark pair, the potential develops an imaginary part which is nowadays\nunderstood to be the main source of dissociation. The imaginary part is found\nto vanish at small $r$, thus agrees with the perturbative result.

A precise $\\nu A$\nscattering model, in which multinucleon effects are incorporated, is pivotal\nfor an accurate interpretation of the data. [Purpose] In $\\nu A$ interactions,\nmeson-exchange currents (MECs) can induce two-nucleon ($2N$) knockout from the\ntarget nucleus, resulting in a two-particle two-hole (2p2h) final state. They\nalso affect single nucleon ($1N$) knockout reactions, yielding a one-particle\none-hole (1p1h) final state. Both channels affect the inclusive strength. We\npresent a study of axial and vector, seagull and pion-in-flight currents in\nmuon-neutrino induced $1N$ and $2N$ knockout reactions on $^{12}$C. [Method]\nBound and emitted nucleons are described as Hartree-Fock wave functions. For\nthe vector MECs, the standard expressions are used. For the axial current,\nthree parameterizations are considered. The framework developed here allows for\na treatment of MECs and short-range correlations (SRCs). [Results] Results are\ncompared with electron-scattering data and with literature. The strengths of\nthe seagull, pion-in-flight and axial currents are studied separately and\ndouble differential cross sections including MECs are compared with results\nincluding SRCs. A comparison with MiniBooNE and T2K data is presented.\n[Conclusions] In the 1p1h channel, the effects of the MECs tend to cancel each\nother, resulting in a small effect on the double differential cross section.\n$2N$ knockout processes provide a small contribution to the inclusive double\ndifferential cross section, ranging from the $2N$ knockout threshold into the\ndip region. A fair agreement with the MiniBooNE and T2K data is reached. \n\n"}

We compute the probability distribution of orbital\nparameters for PBH binaries formed in the early Universe, accounting for tidal\ntorquing by all other PBHs, as well as standard large-scale adiabatic\nperturbations. We then check whether the orbital parameters of PBH binaries\nformed in the early Universe can be significantly affected between formation\nand merger. Our analytic estimates indicate that the tidal field of halos and\ninteractions with other PBHs, as well as dynamical friction by unbound standard\nDM particles, do not do significant work on nor torque PBH binaries. We\nestimate the torque due to baryon accretion to be much weaker than previous\ncalculations, albeit possibly large enough to significantly affect the\neccentricity of typical PBH binaries. We also revisit the PBH-binary merger\nrate resulting from gravitational capture in present-day halos, accounting for\nPoisson fluctuations. If binaries formed in the early Universe survive to the\npresent time, as suggested by our analytic estimates, they dominate the total\nPBH merger rate. Moreover, this merger rate would be orders of magnitude larger\nthan LIGO's current upper limits if PBHs make a significant fraction of the\ndark matter. As a consequence, LIGO would constrain ~10-300 Msun PBHs to\nconstitute no more than ~1% of the dark matter.

This is the subject of our actual paper: we discuss\nin detail the coupling of the gravitational field with (i) a massive complex\nscalar field, (ii) a massive real vector field, and (iii) a massless vector\nfield.

For that purpose,\nwe wish to analyze first the dielectric responses of the medium both in\npresence and absence of strong magnetic field. We found that for slow moving\npartons, the real part of dielectric function is not affected by the magnetic\nfield whereas for fast moving partons, for small $|\\textbf{k}|$, it becomes\nvery large and approaches towards its counterpart at $B=0$, for large\n$|\\textbf{k}|$. On the other hand the imaginary part is decreased for both slow\nand fast moving partons, due to the fact that the imaginary contribution due to\nquark-loop vanishes. With these ingredients, we found that the oscillation in\nthe (scaled) induced charge density, due to the very fast partons becomes less\npronounced in the presence of strong magnetic field whereas for smaller parton\nvelocity, no significant change is observed. For the (scaled) wake potential\nalong the motion of fast moving partons (which is of Lennard-Jones (LJ) type),\nthe depth of negative minimum in the backward region gets reduced drastically,\nresulting in the reduction of the amplitude of oscillation. On the other hand\nin the forward region, it remains as the screened Coulomb one, except the\nscreening now becomes much stronger for higher parton velocity. Similarly for\nthe wake potential transverse to the motion of partons in both forward and\nbackward regions, the depth of LJ potential for fast moving partons gets\ndecreased severely, but still retains the forward-backward symmetry. However,\nfor lower parton velocity, the magnetic field does not affect it significantly. \n\n"}

Several topics on this matter are\ndiscussed in this note. The notion of Cheshire Cat Principle is introduced for\nnucleons, nuclei and dense hadronic matter and is confronted with experimental\ndata on the proton, two-nucleon systems and heavy-ion experiments, with a\nleaping extrapolation to the structure of neutron stars. The matter discussed\nhere illustrates that a close contact with experiments, indispensable in the\npresent case, is essential for significant progress in {\\it any} field of\nphysics. I suggest that this is a field that has a tremendous potential for\nbreakthrough in the Asia Pacific countries, particularly in Korea, where some\nof the seminal works in this area have been done by young theorists, both pre-\nand post-graduate. \n\n"}

Multivariate classification methods based on machine\nlearning techniques have become a fundamental ingredient to most analyses. Also\nthe multivariate classifiers themselves have significantly evolved in recent\nyears. Statisticians have found new ways to tune and to combine classifiers to\nfurther gain in performance. Integrated into the analysis framework ROOT, TMVA\nis a toolkit which hosts a large variety of multivariate classification\nalgorithms. Training, testing, performance evaluation and application of all\navailable classifiers is carried out simultaneously via user-friendly\ninterfaces. With version 4, TMVA has been extended to multivariate regression\nof a real-valued target vector. Regression is invoked through the same user\ninterfaces as classification.

The short-lived mesons decay before their\nwave functions can overlap, so any interference must involve identical final\nstates. Unlike previous tests of nonlocality, the interference involves\ncontinuous variables, momentum and position.

We\nstudy all possible four combinations of subsystems A and B made up with a\nharmonic oscillator and an upside down oscillator. We analyzed the decoherence\nsuffered by subsystem A due to an effective environment composed by subsystem B\nand the external reservoir. In all the cases we found that subsystem A\ndecoheres even though it interacts with the environment only through its sole\ncoupling to B. However, the effectiveness of the diffusion depends on the\nunstable nature of subsystem A and B. Therefore, the role of this degree of\nfreedom in the effective environment is analyzed in detail \n\n"}

We show that this\nproblem is equivalent to solving an infinite system of iteratively decoupled\nhyperbolic partial differential equations in (1+1)-dimensions. For the case\nthat v(x) is purely imaginary, the latter have the form of a nonhomogeneous\nwave equation which admits an exact solution. We apply our general method to\nobtain the most general metric operator for the imaginary cubic potential,\nv(x)=i \\epsilon x^3. This reveals an infinite class of previously unknown CPT-\nas well as non-CPT-inner products. We compute the physical observables of the\ncorresponding unitary quantum system and determine the underlying classical\nsystem. Our results for the imaginary cubic potential show that, unlike the\nquantum system, the corresponding classical system is not sensitive to the\nchoice of the metric operator. As another application of our method we give a\ncomplete characterization of the pseudo-Hermitian canonical quantization of a\nfree particle moving in real line that is consistent with the usual choice for\nthe quantum Hamiltonian.
