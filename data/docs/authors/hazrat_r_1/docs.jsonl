{"id": "1202.2717", "contents": "Title: Noncommutative Poisson structures, derived representation schemes and\n  Calabi-Yau algebras Abstract: Recantly, William Crawley-Boevey proposed the definition of a Poisson\nstructure on a noncommutative algebra $A$ based on the Kontsevich principle.\nHis idea was to find the {\\it weakest} possible structure on $A$ that induces\nstandard (commutative) Poisson structures on all representation spaces $\n\\Rep_V(A) $. It turns out that such a weak Poisson structure on $A$ is a Lie\nalgebra bracket on the 0-th cyclic homology $ \\HC_0(A) $ satisfying some extra\nconditions; it was thus called in an {\\it $ H_0$-Poisson structure}.\n  This paper studies a higher homological extension of this construction. In\nour more general setting, we show that noncommutative Poisson structures in the\nabove sense behave nicely with respect to homotopy (in the sense that homotopy\nequivalent NC Poisson structures on $A$ induce (via the derived representation\nfunctor) homotopy equivalent Poisson algebra structures on the derved\nrepresentation schemes $\\DRep_V(A) $). For an ordinary algebra $A$, a\nnoncommutative Poisson structure on a semifree (more generally, cofibrant)\nresolution of $A$ yields a graded (super) Lie algebra structure on the full\ncyclic homology $ \\HC_\\bullet(A) $ extending Crawley-Boevey's $\\H_0$-Poisson\nstructure on $ \\HC_0(A) $. We call such structures {\\it derived Poisson\nstructures} on $A$.\n  We also show that derived Poisson structures do arise in nature: the cobar\nconstruction $\\Omega(C)$ of an $(-n)$-cyclic coassociative DG coalgebra (in\nparticular, of the linear dual of a finite dimensional $n$-cyclic DG algebra)\n$C$ carries a $(2-n)$-double Poisson bracket in the sense of Van den Bergh.\nThis in turn induces a corresponding noncommutative $(2-n)$-Poisson structure\non $\\Omega(C)$.

The idempotent max-plus algebra $A$ of an ordered monoid\n$\\tM$ is replaced by $R: = L\\times \\tM$, where $L$ is a given indexing semiring\n(not necessarily with 0). In this case we say $R$ layered by $L$. When $L$ is\ntrivial, i.e, $L=\\{1\\}$, $R$ is the usual bipotent max-plus algebra.

A bird's eye view of the graded module theory over a graded ring\ngives an impression of the module theory with the added adjective \"graded\" to\nall its statements. Once the grading is considered to be trivial, the graded\ntheory reduces to the usual module theory. So from this perspective, the graded\nmodule theory can be considered as an extension of the module theory. However,\none aspect that could be easily missed from such a panoramic view is that, the\ngraded module theory comes equipped with a shifting, thanks to being able to\npartition the structures and rearranging these partitions. This adds an extra\nlayer of structure (and complexity) to the theory. An sparkling example of this\nis the theory of graded Grothendieck groups, K^{gr}_0, which is the main focus\nof this monograph. Whereas the usual K_0 is an abelian group, thanks to the\nshiftings, K^{gr}_0 has a natural Z[\\Gamma]-module structure, where \\Gamma is\nthe graded group.

Indeed, on page\n78/79 of this book, Macaulay is saying the following: \" A polynomial ideal\n$\\mathfrak{a} \\subset k[{\\chi}\\_1$,..., ${\\chi}\\_n]=k[\\chi]$ is of the {\\it\nprincipal class} and thus {\\it unmixed} if it has rank $r$ and is generated by\n$r$ polynomials. Having in mind this definition, a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nwith associated prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = rad(\\mathfrak{q})$ is such that any\nideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\\mathfrak{a} \\subset\n\\mathfrak{q}$ determines a primary ideal of greater {\\it multiplicity} over\n$k$. In particular, we have $dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/({\\chi}\\_1$,...,${\\chi}\\_n)^2)=n+1$\nbecause, passing to a system of PD equations for one unknown $y$, the\nparametric jets are \\{${y,y\\_1, ...,y\\_n}$\\} but any ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of\nthe principal class with $\\mathfrak{a}\\subset ({\\chi}\\_1,{\\^a},{\\chi}\\_n)^2$ is\ncontained into a {\\it simple} ideal, that is a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nsuch that $rad(\\mathfrak{q})=\\mathfrak{m}\\in max(k[\\chi])$ is a maximal and\nthus prime ideal with $dim\\_k(M)=dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/\\mathfrak{q})=2^n$ at least.\nAccordingly, any primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$ may not be a member of the\nprimary decomposition of an unmixed ideal $\\mathfrak{a} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{q}$\nof the principal class. Otherwise, $\\mathfrak{q}$ is said to be of the {\\it\nprincipal noetherian class} \". Our aim is to explain this result in a modern\nlanguage and to illustrate it by providing a similar example for $n=4$. The\nimportance of such an example is that it allows for the first time to exhibit\nsymbols which are $2,3,4$-acyclic without being involutive. Another interest of\nthis example is that it has properties quite similar to the ones held by the\nsystem of conformal Killing equations which are still not known. For this\nreason, we have put all the examples at the end of the paper and each one is\npresented in a rather independent way though a few among them are quite tricky.\nMeanwhile, the second purpose is to prove that the methods developped by\nMacaulay in order to study {\\it unmixed polynomial ideals} are only particular\nexamples of new formal differential geometric techniques that have been\nintroduced recently in order to study {\\it pure differential modules}. However\nthese procedures are based on the formal theory of systems of ordinary\ndifferential (OD) or partial differential (PD) equations, in particular on a\nsystematic use of the Spencer operator, and are still not acknowledged by the\nalgebraic community. \n\n"}

This process allows, by\nstudying algebraically the structures thus obtained (changes of bases,\ngenerating sets, presentations, morphisms, representations), to collect\ncombinatorial information about the underlying objects. The algebraic\nstructures the most encountered here are magmas, posets, associative algebras,\ndendriform algebras, Hopf bialgebras, operads, and pros. This work explores the\naforementioned research direction and provides many constructions having the\nparticularity to build algebraic structures on combinatorial objects. We\ndevelop for instance a functor from nonsymmetric colored operads to\nnonsymmetric operads, from monoids to operads, from unitary magmas to\nnonsymmetric operads, from finite posets to nonsymmetric operads, from stiff\npros to Hopf bialgebras, and from precompositions to nonsymmetric operads.\nThese constructions bring alternative ways to describe already known structures\nand provide new ones, as for instance, some of the deformations of the\nnoncommutative Fa\\`a di Bruno Hopf bialgebra of Foissy and a generalization of\nthe dendriform operad of Loday.
