On one hand, the\nhalo occupation statistics inferred from the observed clustering properties of\ngalaxies are degenerate with the adopted cosmology. Consequently, different\ncosmologies imply different mass-to-light ratios for dark matter haloes. On the\nother hand, galaxy-galaxy lensing yields direct constraints on the actual\nmass-to-light ratios and it can be used to break this degeneracy, and thus to\nconstrain cosmological parameters. In this paper we establish the link between\ngalaxy luminosity and dark matter halo mass using the conditional luminosity\nfunction (CLF). We constrain the CLF parameters using the galaxy luminosity\nfunction and the luminosity dependence of the correlation lengths of galaxies.\nThe resulting CLF models are used to predict the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal.\nFor a cosmology with $(\\Omega_{\\rm m},\\sigma_8)=(0.238,0.734)$, the model\naccurately fits the galaxy-galaxy lensing data obtained from the SDSS. For a\ncomparison cosmology with $(\\Omega_{\\rm m},\\sigma_8)=(0.3,0.9)$, however, we\ncan accurately fit the luminosity function and clustering properties of the\ngalaxy population, but the model predicts mass-to-light ratios that are too\nhigh, resulting in a strong overprediction of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal.\nWe conclude that the combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing\nis a powerful probe of the galaxy-dark matter connection, with the potential to\nyield tight constraints on cosmological parameters. Since this method mainly\nprobes the mass distribution on non-linear scales, it is complementary to\nconstraints obtained from the galaxy power-spectrum, which mainly probes the\nlarge-scale (linear) matter distribution. \n\n"}

I: Simple models Abstract: N-body simulations are widely used to simulate the dynamical evolution of a\nvariety of systems, among them star clusters. Much of our understanding of\ntheir evolution rests on the results of such direct N-body simulations. They\nprovide insight in the structural evolution of star clusters, as well as into\nthe occurrence of stellar exotica. Although the major pure N-body codes\nSTARLAB/KIRA and NBODY4 are widely used for a range of applications, there is\nno thorough comparison study yet. Here we thoroughly compare basic quantities\nas derived from simulations performed either with STARLAB/KIRA or NBODY4.\n  We construct a large number of star cluster models for various stellar mass\nfunction settings (but without stellar/binary evolution, primordial binaries,\nexternal tidal fields etc), evolve them in parallel with STARLAB/KIRA and\nNBODY4, analyse them in a consistent way and compare the averaged results\nquantitatively. For this quantitative comparison we develop a bootstrap\nalgorithm for functional dependencies.\n  We find an overall excellent agreement between the codes, both for the\nclusters' structural and energy parameters as well as for the properties of the\ndynamically created binaries. However, we identify small differences, like in\nthe energy conservation before core collapse and the energies of escaping\nstars, which deserve further studies.

In this paper, which is one of a series of papers on the\nnumerical calculation of the bispectrum from the second-order fluctuations, we\nconsider the terms that are products of the first-order perturbations, and\nleave intrinsically second-order terms and perturbations in the recombination\nhistory to the subsequent papers. We show that the bispectrum has the maximum\nsignal in the squeezed triangles, similar to the local-type primordial\nbispectrum, as both types generate non-linearities via products of the\nfirst-order terms in position space. However, detailed calculations show that\ntheir shapes are sufficiently different: the cross-correlation coefficient\nreaches 0.5 at the maximum multipole of l_{max}~ 200, and then weakens to 0.3\nat l_{max}~ 2000. The differences in shape arise from (i) the way the acoustic\noscillations affect the bispectrum, and (ii) the second-order effects not being\nscale-invariant. This implies that the contamination of the primordial\nbispectrum due to the second-order effects (from the products of the\nfirst-order terms) is small. The expected signal-to-noise ratio of the products\nof the first-order terms is ~ 0.4 at l_{max}~ 2000 for a full-sky, cosmic\nvariance limited experiment.

While HI-deficiency by itself is not a\nsufficient condition for molecular gas depletion, we find that H2 reduction is\nassociated with the removal of HI inside the galaxy optical disk. Those\nHI-deficient galaxies with normal H2 content have lost HI mainly from outside\ntheir optical disks, where the H2 content is low in all galaxies. This finding\nis consistent with theoretical models in which the molecular fraction in a\ngalaxy is determined primarily by its gas column density.

We find that all\nseven compact galaxies require a two-component fit to their light profile and\nhave measured velocity dispersions that exceed those expected for typical\nearly-type galaxies at their luminosity.

If this is interpreted as an age\nspread, the multiple populations are separated by a few hundred Myr, which\nwould call into question the long held notion that clusters are simple stellar\npopulations. Here we show that stellar rotation in stars with masses between\n1.2-1.7 Msun can mimic the effect of a double or multiple population, whereas\nin actuality only a single population exists. The two main causes of the spread\nnear the turn-off are the effects of stellar rotation on the structure of the\nstar and the inclination angle of the star relative to the observer. Both\neffects change the observed effective temperature, hence colour, and flux of\nthe star. In order to match observations, the required rotation rates are\n20-50% of the critical rotation, which are consistent with observed rotation\nrates of similar mass stars in the Galaxy. We provide scaling relations which\ncan be applied to non-rotating isochrones in order to mimic the effects of\nrotation.

Despite this pivotal\nimportance, and despite many decades of research, our understanding of the\nprocesses that initiate and regulate star formation is still limited.\n  Stars are born in cold interstellar clouds of molecular hydrogen gas. Star\nformation in these clouds is governed by the complex interplay between the\ngravitational attraction in the gas and agents such as turbulence, magnetic\nfields, radiation and thermal pressure that resist compression. The competition\nbetween these processes determines both the locations at which young stars form\nand how much mass they ultimately accrete. It plays out over many orders of\nmagnitude in space and time, ranging from galactic to stellar scales. In\naddition, star formation is a highly stochastic process in which rare and\nhard-to-predict events, such as the formation of very massive stars and the\nresulting feedback, can play a dominant role in determining the evolution of a\nstar-forming cloud.\n  As a consequence of the wide range of scales and processes that control star\nformation, analytic models are usually restricted to highly idealized cases.\nThese can yield insight, but the complexity of the problem means that they must\nbe used in concert with large-scale numerical simulations.

Fitting the observed disk rotational velocities and radii with a\nMo, Mao, White (1998) (MMW) model requires unusually large disk spin parameters\nlambda_d>0.1 and disk-to-dark halo mass fraction m_d=0.2, close to the cosmic\nbaryon fraction.

For the dispersion-dominated sample, radial\npressure gradients partly compensate the gravitational force, reducing the\nrotational velocities. Including this pressure effect in the MMW model,\ndispersion-dominated galaxies can be fitted well with spin parameters lf\nlambda_d=0.03-0.05 for high disk mass fractions of m_d=0.2 and with\nlambda_d=0.01-0.03 for m_d=0.05.

We then add simulated absorption from the high-redshift\nIGM to these quasar spectra in order to determine the corresponding\nuncertainties in reionization constraints using current and future samples of z\n> 6 quasar spectra.

The\nsample spans a large range in velocity dispersion (sigma from 30-300 km/s) and\nin luminosity (M_R from -18.7 to -23.2). Estimates of age, total metallicity\n(Z/H) and alpha-element abundance ratio (a/Fe) were derived from\nabsorption-line analysis, using single-burst models. Age, Z/H and a/Fe are all\ncorrelated positively with velocity dispersion, but we also find significant\nresidual trends with luminosity: at given sigma, the brighter galaxies are\nyounger, less alpha-enriched, and have higher Z/H. At face value, these results\nmight suggest that the stellar populations depend on stellar mass as well as on\nvelocity dispersion. However, we show that the observed trends can be\nreproduced by models in which the stellar populations depend systematically\nonly on sigma, and are independent of stellar mass Mstel. For age, the observed\nluminosity correlation arises because young galaxies are brighter, at fixed\nMstel. For metallicity, the observed luminosity dependence arises because\nmetal-rich galaxies, at fixed mass, tend also to be younger, and hence\nbrighter. We find a good match to the observed luminosity correlations with Age\n~ sigma^0.40, Z/H ~ sigma^0.35, a/Fe ~ sigma^0.20, where the slopes are close\nto those found when fitting traditional scaling relations. We conclude that the\nstar formation and enrichment histories of galaxies are determined primarily by\nthe depth of their gravitational potential wells.

In this paper I review our current\nunderstanding of these topics. I begin by considering whether AGN and BHBs show\nthe same X-ray spectral-timing `states' (e.g. low-flux, hard-spectrum or `hard'\nand high-flux, soft-spectrum or `soft'). Observational selection effects mean\nthat most of the AGN which we have monitored will probably be `soft state'\nobjects, but AGN are found in the other BHB states, although possibly with\ndifferent critical transition accretion rates. I examine timescale scaling\nrelationships between AGN and BHBs.

The relationship T_B proportional to M_BH/mdot_E is a good fit, implying\nthat no other potential variable, e.g. black hole spin, varies significantly.\nLags between hard and soft X-ray bands as a function of Fourier timescale\nfollow similar patterns in AGN and BHBs.

The internal extinction, derived from the TIR-to-FUV luminosity\nratio, decreases with radius, and is larger in Sb-Sbc galaxies. The TIR-to-FUV\nratio correlates with the UV spectral slope beta, following a sequence shifted\nto redder UV colors with respect to that of starbursts. The star formation\nhistory (SFH) is identified as the main driver of this departure. We have also\nderived radial profiles of the total dust mass surface density, the fraction of\nthe dust mass contributed by PAHs, the fraction of the dust mass heated by very\nintense starlight and the intensity of the radiation field heating the grains.\nThe dust profiles are exponential, their radial scale-length being constant\nfrom Sb to Sd galaxies (only ~10% larger than the stellar scale-length).

If the inner disc radius we measure (<=3.8\ngravitational radii) is identified with the innermost stable circular orbit of\nthe black hole spacetime, we infer that the black hole powering RBS 1124 is\nrotating rapidly with spin a>= 0.6. The soft excess contribution in the 0.5-2\nkeV band is ~15%, about half than that typically observed in unobscured Seyfert\n1 galaxies and quasars, in line with the low disc reflection fraction we\nmeasure (R_disc ~0.4). The low reflection fraction cannot be driven by disc\ntruncation which is at odds not only with the small inner disc radius we infer\nbut, most importantly, with the radiatively efficient nature of the source\n(L_Bol / L_Edd ~1). A plausible explanation is that the X-ray corona is the\nbase of a failed jet (RBS 1124 being radio-quiet) and actually outflowing at\nmildly relativistic speeds.

We employ this\ntechnique to measure an extremely anisotropic scattered image of the pulsar\nB0834+06 at 327 MHz. We find that the scattering occurs in a compact region\nabout 420 pc from the Earth. This image has two components, both essentially\nlinear and nearly parallel. The primary feature, which is about 16 AU long and\nless than 0.5 AU in width, is highly inhomogeneous on spatial scales as small\nas 0.05 AU. The second feature is much fainter and is displaced from the axis\nof the primary feature by about 9 AU.

The X-ray spectrum is characterized by two main peculiar\nfeatures, i) a strong soft excess with a steep rise below about 1.3 keV and ii)\na deep drop in flux above 8.2 keV. We focus here on a reflection-based\ninterpretation which interprets both features, as well as the large soft\nexcess, in terms of partially ionized reflection off the inner accretion disc.\nWe show that the two peculiar spectral features mentioned above can be\nreproduced by two relativistic emission lines due to Fe K and Fe L. The lines\nare produced in the inner accretion disc and independently yield consistent\ndisc parameters. We argue that the high L/K intensity ratio is broadly\nconsistent with expectations from an ionized accretion disc reflection,\nindicating that they belong to a single ionized reflection component.

We detect\nX-ray emission even in the outskirts of clusters, beyond r_200 for richness\nclasses with X-ray temperatures above 1 keV. This enables us to more accurately\ndetermine the total gas mass in these groups and clusters.

We also find that the stellar mass in poor groups with temperatures\nbelow 1 keV is comparable to the gas mass in these systems. Combining these\nresults with individual measurements for clusters, groups, and galaxies from\nthe literature, we find a break in the baryon fraction at ~1 keV. Above this\ntemperature, the baryon fraction scales with temperature as f_b \\propto\nT^0.20\\pm0.03.

In all cases, the\ndisks go through phases of ring formation, gravitational instability and\nbreak-up into massive clumps. Ring formation can be enhanced by a focal point\neffect. The position of the ring is determined by the angular momentum\ndistribution of the material it forms from. We study the ring and clump\nmorphologies, the characteristic properties of the resulting velocity\ndispersion field and the effect of star formation.

We compare these analytic calculations to numerical simulations and\nuse them to develop a sub-grid model of BH growth that can be incorporated into\nsemi-analytic models or cosmological simulations. Both analytic calculations\nand simulations argue that the strongest torque on gas arises when\nnon-axisymmetric perturbations to the stellar gravitational potential produces\norbit crossings and shocks in the gas. This is true both at large radii ~0.01-1\nkpc, where bar-like modes dominate the non-axisymmetric potential, and at\nsmaller radii <10 pc, where a lopsided/eccentric disk dominates. The\ntraditional orbit crossing criterion is not always adequate to predict the\nlocations of, and inflow due to, shocks in gas+stellar disks with finite sound\nspeeds.

We study the formation of such BHs, as well as the accretion of\ngas onto these objects and the high energy radiation emitted in the accretion\nprocess, by carrying out cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations. In\nthe absence of radiative feedback, we find an upper limit to the accretion rate\nonto the central object which forms from the initial collapse of hot (~ 10^4 K)\ngas of the order of 0.1 MSun per year. This is high enough for the formation of\na supermassive star, the immediate precursor of a BH, with a mass of the order\nof 10^5 MSun.

We\nuse a simplified dynamical collapse model, and follow the chemical and thermal\nevolution of the gas, in the presence of a UV background. We find that a LW\nflux of J_crit = 1e-22 erg/cm^2/sr/s/Hz is able to suppress HD cooling and thus\nprevent collapsing primordial gas from reaching temperatures below 100 K. The\nmain reason for the lack of HD cooling for J>J_crit is the partial\nphoto-dissociation of H_2, which prevents the gas from reaching sufficiently\nlow temperatures (T<150K) for HD to become the dominant coolant; direct HD\nphoto-dissociation is unimportant except for a narrow range of fluxes and\ncolumn densities. Since the prevention of HD-cooling requires only partial H_2\nphoto-dissociation, the critical flux J_crit is modest, and is below the UV\nbackground required to reionize the universe at redshift z=10-20. We conclude\nthat HD-cooling can reduce the masses of typical stars only in rare halos\nforming well before the epoch of reionization. \n\n"}

With the aid of an SDSS spectroscopically\nconfirmed quasar sample, we demonstrate that variability selection in typical\nextragalactic fields with low stellar density can deliver complete samples with\nreasonable purity (or efficiency, E). Compared to a selection method based\nsolely on the slope of the structure function, the inclusion of the tau\ninformation boosts E from 60% to 75% while maintaining a highly complete sample\n(98%) even in the absence of color information. For a completeness of C=90%, E\nis boosted from 80% to 85%. Conversely, C improves from 90% to 97% while\nmaintaining E=80% when imposing a lower limit on tau.

The most popular interpretation of the MSP is that\nthe smallest dark matter halos in the universe are extremely inefficient at\nforming stars. The question from that standpoint is to identify the feedback\nsource that makes small halos dark and to identify any obvious mass scale where\nthe truncation in the efficiency of galaxy formation occurs. Among the most\nexciting developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery\nof a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide\nfield, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite count\nin less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint galaxies that are\nless luminous that some star clusters.

We simulate the effects of\nCompton scattering on a collimated beam of high energy photons passing through\na shell of high column density material to determine the expected lightcurves,\nluminosities, and spectra. We compare these predictions to observations, and\ndetermine what limits can realistically be placed on the total gas column\ndensity. The smearing out of pulses in the lightcurve from Compton scattering\nis not likely to be observable, and its absence does not place strong\nconstraints on the Compton depth for GRBs. However, the distribution of\nobserved luminosities of bursts allows us to place statistical, model-dependent\nlimits that are typically <~1e25 cm^{-2} for less luminous bursts, and as low\nas ~1e24 cm$^{-2} for the most luminous. Using the shape of the high-energy\nbroadband spectrum, however, in some favourable cases, limits as low as ~5e24\ncm^{-2} can placed on individual bursts, implying metallicity lower limits from\nX- and gamma-rays alone from 0 up to 0.01 Z/Zsun. At extremely high redshifts,\nthis limit would be at least 0.02 Z/Z_sun, enough to discriminate population\nIII from non-primordial GRBs. \n\n"}

II.\n  Metallicity Abstract: We investigate the large-scale influence of outflows from AGNs in enriching\nthe IGM with metals in a cosmological context. We combine cosmological\nsimulations of large scale structure formation with a detailed model of metal\nenrichment, in which outflows expand anisotropically along the direction of\nleast resistance, distributing metals into the IGM. The metals carried by the\noutflows are generated by two separate stellar populations: stars located near\nthe central AGN, and stars located in the greater galaxy. Using this algorithm,\nwe performed a series of 5 simulations of the propagation of AGN-driven\noutflows in a cosmological volume of size (128/h Mpc)^3 in a Lambda-CDM\nuniverse, and analyze the resulting metal enrichment of the IGM. We found that\nthe metallicity induced in the IGM is greatly dominated by AGNs having\nbolometric luminosity L > 10^9 L_sun, sources with 10^8 < L / L_sun < 10^9\nhaving a negligible contribution. Our simulations produced an average IGM\nmetallicity of [O/H] = -5 at z = 5.5, which then rises gradually, and remains\nrelatively flat at a value [O/H] = -2.8 between z = 2 and z = 0. The ejection\nof metals from AGN host galaxies by AGN-driven outflows is found to enrich the\nIGM to > 10 - 20% of the observed values, the number dependent on redshift. The\nenriched IGM volume fractions are small at z > 3, then rise rapidly to the\nfollowing values at z = 0: 6 - 10% of the volume enriched to [O/H] > -2.5, 14 -\n24% volume to [O/H] > -3, and 34 - 45% volume to [O/H] > -4. At z > 2, there is\na gradient of the induced enrichment, the metallicity decreasing with\nincreasing IGM density, enriching the underdense IGM to higher metallicities, a\ntrend more prominent with increasing anisotropy of the outflows.

It is aimed at estimating bulk flows of cosmological\nvolumes containing large numbers of galaxies. Constraints on the bulk flow are\nobtained by minimizing systematic variations in galaxy luminosities with\nrespect to a reference luminosity function measured from the whole survey. This\nmethod offers two advantages over more popular bulk flow estimators: it is\nindependent of error-prone distance indicators and of the poorly-known galaxy\nbias. We apply the method to the 2MASS redshift survey (2MRS) to measure the\nlocal bulk flows of spherical shells centered on the Milky Way (MW).

The HI morphology is complex,\nwith multiple column density peaks surrounding a large region of very low HI\nsurface density that is offset from the center of the stellar distribution. The\nbulk of the neutral gas is associated with the southern section of the galaxy;\na secondary peak in the north contains ~15% of the total HI mass. These\ncomponents appear to be kinematically distinct, suggesting that either tidal\nprocesses or large-scale blowout have recently shaped the ISM of DDO 165. Using\nspatially-resolved position-velocity maps, we find multiple localized\nhigh-velocity gas features. Cross-correlating with radius-velocity analyses, we\nidentify eight shell/hole structures in the ISM with a range of sizes (~400-900\npc) and expansion velocities (~7-11 km/s).

Carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter between\nstellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using a\nnovel and self-consistent theoretical framework. Our results provide strong\nconstraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass\nrelation (SHMR) from z=0.2 to z=1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass\nscales as Mh M*^0.46 and that this scaling does not evolve significantly with\nredshift to z=1. We show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh/M*, varies from low\nto high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh/M*~27 at M*=4.5x10^10 Msun and\nMh=1.2x10^12 Msun. This minimum is important for models of galaxy formation\nbecause it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the\ncentral galaxy has been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this\nminimum in terms of the \"pivot stellar mass\", M*piv, the \"pivot halo mass\",\nMhpiv, and the \"pivot ratio\", (Mh/M*)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous analysis of a\nsingle data set, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends for\nboth Mhpiv and M*piv. The pivot stellar mass decreases from\nM*piv=5.75+-0.13x10^10 Msun at z=0.88 to M*piv=3.55+-0.17x10^10 Msun at z=0.37.\nIntriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of Mhpiv leaves the pivot\nratio constant with redshift at (Mh/M*)piv~27. We use simple arguments to show\nhow this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching may\nultimately depend on Mh/M* and not simply Mh, as is commonly assumed. We show\nthat simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in the\nsites of star formation.

Measurement of this anisotropy by future 21cm surveys is a\npromising tool for separating cosmology from 21cm astrophysics. However,\nprevious attempts to model the signal have often neglected peculiar velocity or\nonly approximated it crudely. This paper re-examines the effects of peculiar\nvelocity on the 21cm signal in detail, improving upon past treatment and\naddressing several issues for the first time. (1) We show that properly\naccounting for finite optical depth eliminates the unphysical divergence of\n21cm brightness temperature in overdense regions of the IGM found by previous\nwork that employed the usual optically-thin approximation. (2) The\napproximation made previously to circumvent the diverging brightness\ntemperature problem by capping velocity gradient can misestimate the power\nspectrum on all scales. (3) The observed power spectrum in redshift-space\nremains finite even in the optically-thin approximation if one properly\naccounts for the redshift-space distortion. However, results that take full\naccount of finite optical depth show that this approximation is only accurate\nin the limit of high spin temperature.

The linear theory has been well understood for some time, however\ndeveloping and applying the theory beyond linear order is currently at the\nforefront of research in theoretical cosmology. This thesis studies the\napplications of perturbation theory to cosmology and, specifically, to the\nearly universe. Starting with some background material introducing the\nwell-tested 'standard model' of cosmology, we move on to develop the formalism\nfor perturbation theory up to second order giving evolution equations for all\ntypes of scalar, vector and tensor perturbations, both in gauge dependent and\ngauge invariant form. We then move on to the main result of the thesis, showing\nthat, at second order in perturbation theory, vorticity is sourced by a\ncoupling term quadratic in energy density and entropy perturbations. This\nsource term implies a qualitative difference to linear order. Thus, while at\nlinear order vorticity decays with the expansion of the universe, the same is\nnot true at higher orders. This will have important implications on future\nmeasurements of the polarisation of the Cosmic Microwave Background, and could\ngive rise to the generation of a primordial seed magnetic field.

The same holds true for the perturbation to the\nparticle number density. These facts exclude all definitions of gauge-invariant\nquantities used to describe density perturbations in former theories. Using\nthese two new quantities, a manifestly covariant and gauge-invariant\ncosmological perturbation theory, adapted to non-barotropic equations of state\nfor the pressure, has been developed. The new theory is valid for all scales\nsince metric gradients do not occur in the final evolution equations. The new\ntheory has an exact non-relativistic limit with a time-independent Newtonian\npotential. The usual Newtonian perturbation theory is inadequate to study the\nevolution of density perturbations. In the radiation-dominated era,\nperturbations in the particle number density are gravitationally coupled to\nperturbations in the total energy density, irrespective of the nature of the\nparticles. This implies that structure formation can commence only after\ndecoupling of matter and radiation.

This is\nbecause the abundance of molecular hydrogen is sensitive to the abundance of\ndust, which catalyzes the formation of H_2 and helps to shield it from\ndissociating radiation. In this study we point out that in the absence of\nsignificant pre-enrichment by Population III stars forming out of zero\nmetallicity gas, such H_2-based star formation is expected to leave an imprint\nin the form of bi-modality in the metallicity distribution among dwarf galaxies\nand in the metallicity distribution of stars within individual galaxies. The\nbi-modality arises because when gas metallicity (and dust abundance) is low,\nformation of molecular gas is inefficient, the gas consumption time scale is\nlong, and star formation and metal enrichment proceed slowly. When metallicity\nreaches a critical threshold value star formation and enrichment accelerate,\nwhich leads to rapid increase in both stellar mass and metallicity of galaxies.\nWe demonstrate this process both using a simple analytical model and full\ncosmological simulations. In contrast, observed metallicity distributions of\ndwarf galaxies or stars within them are not bi-modal. We argue that this\ndiscrepancy points to substantial early stochastic pre-enrichment by population\nIII stars to levels Z ~ 0.01 Z_sun in dense, star forming regions of early\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

The spectral distortions created\nby Bose-Einstein condensation of photons are within an order of magnitude (for\nthe present range of allowed cosmological parameters), with exactly the same\nspectrum but opposite in sign, of those created by diffusion damping of the\nacoustic waves on small scales corresponding to comoving wavenumbers $45< k<\n10^4\\, Mpc^{-1}$.

Now stars which fulfil the escape criterion\nare not removed immediately, but can stay in the system for a certain time\nwhich depends on the excess of the energy of a star above the escape energy.\nThey are called potential escapers. With the addition of the Fewbody integrator\nthe code can follow all interaction channels which are important for the rate\nof creation of various types of objects observed in star clusters, and ensures\nthat the energy generation by binaries is treated in a manner similar to the\n$N$-body model.\n  There are at most three new parameters which have to be adjusted against\n$N$-body simulations for large $N$: two (or one, depending on the chosen\napproach) connected with the escape process, and one responsible for the\ndetermination of the interaction probabilities.

We now provide a model in which a copy of the electroweak\ngauge group is added to the Standard Model. We spontaneously break this new\ngauge group to the diagonal Z_2 center which is used to stabilize a dark matter\ncandidate. In addition to the dark matter candidate, anomaly free messenger\nfermions are included which transform non-trivially under all the gauge groups.\nIn analogy to electroweak baryogenesis, the model generates an excess of\nmessenger \"baryons\". These \"baryons\" subsequently decay to the Standard Model\nand dark matter to generate an excess of Standard Model baryons. The\nbaryon-to-dark matter number density ratio is ultimately due to the requirement\nof gauge anomaly freedom. Dark sphalerons generate operators which violate B -\nL but preserves B + L. Thus, the asymmetry is not washed out by the Standard\nModel.

We here study\nwind formation due to CR physics using a numerical model that accounts for CR\nacceleration by supernovae, CR thermalization, and advective CR transport. In\naddition, we introduce a novel implementation of CR streaming relative to the\nrest frame of the gas. We find that CR streaming drives powerful and sustained\nwinds in galaxies with virial masses M_200 < 10^{11} Msun. In dwarf galaxies\n(M_200 ~ 10^9 Msun) the winds reach a mass loading factor of ~5, expel ~60 per\ncent of the initial baryonic mass contained inside the halo's virial radius and\nsuppress the star formation rate by a factor of ~5. In dwarfs, the winds are\nspherically symmetric while in larger galaxies the outflows transition to\nbi-conical morphologies that are aligned with the disc's angular momentum axis.\nWe show that damping of Alfven waves excited by streaming CRs provides a means\nof heating the outflows to temperatures that scale with the square of the\nescape speed. In larger haloes (M_200 > 10^{11} Msun), CR streaming is able to\ndrive fountain flows that excite turbulence.

We conclude that CR-driven winds should be crucial in\nsuppressing and regulating the first epoch of galaxy formation, expelling a\nlarge fraction of baryons, and - by extension - aid in shaping the faint end of\nthe galaxy luminosity function.

More importantly, we emphasize\nthat the dark matter component of the leading tidal arm of the Sagittarius\ndwarf is significantly more extended than the stellar component of the arm,\nsince the dark matter and stellar streams are not necessarily coaxial and may\nbe offset by several kpc at the point at which they impact the Galactic disk.\nThis suggests that the dark matter component of the Sagittarius debris is\nlikely to have a non-negligible influence on dark matter detection experiments\neven when the stellar debris is centered several kpc from the solar\nneighborhood. Relative to models without an infalling Sagittarius dwarf, the\nSagittarius dark matter debris in our models induces an energy-dependent\nenhancement of direct search event rates of as much as ~20 - 45%, an\nenergy-dependent reduction in the amplitude of the annual modulation of the\nevent rate by as much as a factor of two, a shift in the phase of the annual\nmodulation by as much as ~20 days, and a shift in the recoil energy at which\nthe modulation reverses phase.

All the models are normalized in order to match CMB data\nfrom WMAP3.

We consider both the complete catalog of clusters and\ngroups and subsamples of objects at different level of relaxation. We find that\nthe definition itself of the concentration can lead to differences up to 20% in\nits value and that these differences are smaller when more relaxed objects are\nconsidered. The c-M relation of our reference \\Lambda CDM model is in good\nagreement with the results in literature, and relaxed objects have a higher\nnormalization and a shallower slope with respect to the complete sample. The\ninclusion of baryon physics is found to influence more high-mass systems than\nlow-mass ones, due to a higher concentration of baryons in the inner regions of\nmassive halos.

In this paper, we investigate variations of\nthe IMF within individual galaxies. For this purpose, we use strong lensing and\ngas kinematics to measure independently the normalisation of the IMF of the\nbulge and disk components of a sample of 5 massive spiral galaxies with\nsubstantial bulge components taken from the SWELLS survey. We find that the\nstellar mass of the bulges are tightly constrained by the lensing and kinematic\ndata. A comparison with masses based on stellar population synthesis models\nfitted to optical and near infrared photometry favors a Salpeter-like\nnormalisation of the IMF. Conversely, the disk masses are less well constrained\ndue to degeneracies with the dark matter halo, but are consistent with Milky\nWay type IMFs in agreement with previous studies. The disks are submaximal at\n2.2 disk scale lengths, but due to the contribution of the bulges, the galaxies\nare baryon dominated at 2.2 disk scale lengths. Globally, our inferred IMF\nnormalisation is consistent with that found for early-type galaxies of\ncomparable stellar mass (> 10^11 M_sun). Our results suggest a non-universal\nIMF within the different components of spiral galaxies, adding to the\nwell-known differences in stellar populations between disks and bulges. \n\n"}

Structural parameters were measured by fitting Sersic profiles\nto high resolution CANDELS HST WFC3 J_{125} and H_{160} imaging in the\nUKIDSS-UDS at 1<z<3 and ACS I_{814} imaging in COSMOS at 0.25<z<1. At a given\nredshift, we selected the HST band that most closely samples a common\nrest-frame wavelength so as to minimize systematics from color gradients in\ngalaxies. At fixed n_c, galaxies grow in stellar mass by a factor of ~3 from\nz~3 to z~0. The size evolution is complex: galaxies appear roughly constant in\nsize from z~3 to z~2 and then grow rapidly to lower redshifts. The evolution in\nthe surface mass density profiles indicates that most of the mass at r<2 kpc\nwas in place by z~2, and that most of the new mass growth occurred at larger\nradii. This inside-out mass growth is therefore responsible for the larger\nsizes and higher Sersic indices of the descendants toward low redshift. At z<2,\nthe effective radius evolves with the stellar mass as r_e M^{2.0}, consistent\nwith scenarios that find dissipationless minor mergers to be a key driver of\nsize evolution. The progenitors at z~3 were likely star-forming disks with\nr_e~2 kpc, based on their low Sersic index of n~1, low median axis ratio of\nb/a~0.52, and typical location in the star-forming region of the U-V versus V-J\ndiagram. By z~1.5, many of these star-forming disks disappeared, giving rise to\ncompact quiescent galaxies.

A recent study by us,\nviz., that of Banerjee, Kroupa & Oh (2012; Paper I), which involves realistic\nN-body computations of star clusters mimicking R136, indicates that such\n\"super-canonical\" (SC) stars can be formed out of a dense stellar population\nwith a canonical initial mass function (IMF) through dynamically induced\nmergers of the most massive binaries. Here we study the formation of SC stars\nin the R136 models of Paper I in detail. To avoid forming extraneous SC stars\nfrom initially highly eccentric primordial binaries as in Paper I, we compute\nadditional models with only initially circular primordial binaries. We also\ntake into account the mass-evolution of the SC stars using detailed stellar\nevolutionary models that incorporate updated treatments of stellar winds. We\nfind that SC stars begin to form via dynamical mergers of massive binaries from\napprox. 1 Myr cluster age. We obtain SC stars with initial masses up to approx.\n250 M_sun from these computations. Multiple SC stars are found to remain bound\nto the cluster simultaneously within a SC-lifetime. These properties of the\ndynamically formed SC stars are consistent with those observed in R136. In\nfact, the stellar evolutionary models of SC stars imply that had they formed\nprimordially along with the rest of the R136 cluster, i.e., violating the\ncanonical upper limit, they would have evolved below the canonical 150 M_sun\nlimit by approx. 3 Myr, the likely age of R136, and would not have been\nobservable as SC stars at the present time in R136.

This method avoids known star formation and chemical enrichment\nproblems encountered in simulations. Here we focus on the Milky Way, by using a\ndetailed thin-disk chemical evolution model and a simulation in the\ncosmological context, with dynamical properties close to those of our Galaxy.\nWe show that, due to radial migration from mergers at high redshift and the\ncentral bar at later times, a sizable fraction of old metal-poor\nhigh-[alpha/Fe] stars reaches the solar vicinity. This naturally accounts for a\nnumber of recent observations related to both the thin and thick disks, despite\nthe fact that we use thin-disk chemistry only. Although significant radial\nmixing is present, the slope in the age-metallicity relation is only weakly\naffected, with a scatter compatible with recent observational work.

A Search for Systematics in the Fermi-LAT Data Abstract: Our recent claims of a Galactic center feature in Fermi-LAT data at\napproximately 130 GeV have prompted an avalanche of papers proposing\nexplanations ranging from dark matter annihilation to exotic pulsar winds.\nBecause of the importance of such interpretations for physics and astrophysics,\na discovery will require not only additional data, but a thorough investigation\nof possible LAT systematics. While we do not have access to the details of each\nevent reconstruction, we do have information about each event from the public\nevent lists and spacecraft parameter files. These data allow us to search for\nsuspicious trends that could indicate a spurious signal. We consider several\nhypotheses that might make an instrumental artifact more apparent at the\nGalactic center, and find them implausible. We also search for an instrumental\nsignature in the Earth limb photons, which provide a smooth reference spectrum\nfor null tests. We find no significant 130 GeV feature in the Earth limb\nsample.

The models include molecular cooling, star formation at high densities\nin GMCs, and gas recycling and feedback from SNe (I&II), stellar winds, and\nradiation pressure. We study mergers of systems from SMC-like dwarfs and Milky\nWay analogues to z~2 starburst disks. Multi-phase super-winds are generated in\nall passages, with outflow rates up to ~1000 M_sun/yr. However, the wind\nmass-loading efficiency (outflow rate divided by SFR) is similar to that in\nisolated galaxy counterparts of each merger: it depends more on global galaxy\nproperties (mass, size, escape velocity) than on the dynamical state of the\nmerger. Winds tend to be bi- or uni-polar, but multiple 'events' build up\ncomplex morphologies with overlapping, differently-oriented bubbles/shells at a\nrange of radii. The winds have complex velocity and phase structure, with\nmaterial at a range of speeds up to ~1000 km/s, and a mix of molecular,\nionized, and hot gas that depends on galaxy properties and different feedback\nmechanisms. These simulations resolve a problem in some 'sub-grid' models,\nwhere simple wind prescriptions can dramatically suppress merger-induced\nstarbursts. But despite large mass-loading factors (>~10) in the winds, the\npeak SFRs are comparable to those in 'no wind' simulations. Wind acceleration\ndoes not act equally, so cold dense gas can still lose angular momentum and\nform stars, while blowing out gas that would not have participated in the\nstarburst in the first place. Considerable wind material is not unbound, and\nfalls back on the disk at later times post-merger, leading to higher\npost-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback.

Our primary result is that X-ray radiation from the\nshocks inhibits wind acceleration and can lead to a lower pre-shock velocity,\nand a correspondingly lower shocked plasma temperature, yet the intrinsic X-ray\nluminosity of the shocks, LX remains largely unaltered, with the exception of a\nmodest increase at small binary separations.

In this model Planck data determine the\ncosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble\nconstant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density\nparameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement\nwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys.

We use\nhydrodynamic simulations to study temporal and spatial behavior of star\nformation occurring in nuclear rings of barred galaxies where radial gas\ninflows are triggered solely by a bar potential. The star formation recipes\ninclude a density threshold, an efficiency, conversion of gas to star\nparticles, and delayed momentum feedback via supernova explosions. We find that\nstar formation rate (SFR) in a nuclear ring is roughly equal to the mass inflow\nrate to the ring, while it has a weak dependence on the total gas mass in the\nring. The SFR typically exhibits a strong primary burst followed by weak\nsecondary bursts before declining to very small values. The primary burst is\nassociated with the rapid gas infall to the ring due to the bar growth, while\nthe secondary bursts are caused by re-infall of the ejected gas from the\nprimary burst. While star formation in observed rings persists episodically\nover a few Gyr, the duration of active star formation in our models lasts for\nonly about a half of the bar growth time, suggesting that the bar potential\nalone is unlikely responsible for gas supply to the rings. When the SFR is low,\nmost star formation occurs at the contact points between the ring and the dust\nlanes, leading to an azimuthal age gradient of young star clusters. When the\nSFR is large, on the other hand, star formation is randomly distributed over\nthe whole circumference of the ring, resulting in no apparent azimuthal age\ngradient. Since the ring shrinks in size with time, star clusters also exhibit\na radial age gradient, with younger clusters found closer to the ring. The\ncluster mass function is well described by a power law, with a slope depending\non the SFR. Giant gas clouds in the rings have supersonic internal velocity\ndispersions and are gravitationally bound. \n\n"}

The data exhibit a\nsmooth continuum at near-infrared wavelengths that is sharply cut off blueward\nof 8410 Angs due to absorption from Ly-alpha at redshift z~5.91, with some flux\ntransmitted through the Ly-alpha forest between 7000-7800 Angs. We use column\ndensities inferred from metal absorption lines to constrain the metallicity of\nthe host galaxy between a lower limit of [Si/H]>-1.7 and an upper limit of\n[S/H]<-0.5 set by the non-detection of S II absorption. We demonstrate\nconsistency between the dramatic evolution in the transmission fraction of\nLy-alpha seen in this spectrum over the redshift range z=4.9 to 5.85 with that\npreviously measured from observations of high-redshift quasars. There is an\nextended redshift interval of Delta-z=0.12 in the Ly-alpha forest at z=5.77\nwith no detected transmission, leading to a 3-sigma upper limit on the mean\nLy-alpha transmission fraction of <0.2% (or tau_eff(Ly-alpha) > 6.4). This is\ncomparable to the lowest-redshift Gunn-Peterson troughs found in quasar\nspectra. We set a 2-sigma upper limit of 0.11 on the neutral fraction of the\nIGM at the redshift of the GRB from the lack of a Ly-alpha red damping wing,\nassuming a model with a constant neutral density.

It is important to investigate the\npossibility that the power deficiency at low multipoles may not be of\nprimordial origin and is only an observation artifact coming from the scan\nprocedure adapted in the WMAP or Planck satellites. Therefore, its always\nimportant to investigate all the observational artifacts that can mimic them.\nThe CMB dipole which is almost 550 times higher than the quadrupole can leak to\nthe higher multipoles due to the non-symmetric beam shape of the WMAP.

In cluster cores, early type galaxies dominate, whereas\nstar-forming galaxies are more and more common in the outskirts. At higher\nredshifts and in somewhat less dense environments (e.g. galaxy groups), the\nsituation is less clear. One open issue is that of whether and how the star\nformation rate (SFR) of galaxies in groups depends on the distance from the\ncentre of mass. To shed light on this topic, we have built a sample of X-ray\nselected galaxy groups at 0<z<1.6 in various blank fields (ECDFS, COSMOS,\nGOODS). We use a sample of spectroscopically confirmed group members with\nstellar mass M >10^10.3 M_sun in order to have a high spectroscopic\ncompleteness. As we use only spectroscopic redshifts, our results are not\naffected by uncertainties due to projection effects. We use several SFR\nindicators to link the star formation (SF) activity to the galaxy environment.\nTaking advantage of the extremely deep mid-infrared Spitzer MIPS and\nfar-infrared Herschel PACS observations, we have an accurate, broad-band\nmeasure of the SFR for the bulk of the star-forming galaxies.

In this paper, we study the perturbations exerted on a thin\nstellar disc (with outer radius ~0.4 pc) by a molecular cloud that falls\ntowards the GC and is disrupted by the supermassive black hole (SMBH). The\ninitial conditions for the stellar disc were drawn from the results of previous\nsimulations of molecular cloud infall and disruption in the SMBH potential. We\nfind that most of the gas from the disrupted molecular cloud settles into a\ndense and irregular disc surrounding the SMBH. If the gas disc and the stellar\ndisc are slightly misaligned (~5-20 deg), the precession of the stellar orbits\ninduced by the gas disc significantly increases the inclinations of the stellar\norbits (by a factor of ~3-5 in 1.5 Myr) with respect to the normal vector to\nthe disc. Furthermore, the distribution of orbit inclinations becomes\nsignificantly broader. These results might be the clue to explain the broad\ndistribution of observed inclinations of the early-type stars with respect to\nthe normal vector of the main disc.

Converting these observations to an estimate of the CO J=1-0 intensity,\nand thus inferring H2 gas masses, requires knowledge of the CO excitation\nladder, or spectral line energy distribution (SLED). The few available multi-J\nCO observations of galaxies show a very broad range of SLEDs, even at fixed\ngalaxy mass and star formation rate, making the conversion to J=1-0 emission\nand hence molecular gas mass highly uncertain. Here, we combine numerical\nsimulations of disk galaxies and galaxy mergers with molecular line radiative\ntransfer calculations to develop a model for the physical parameters that drive\nvariations in CO SLEDs in galaxies. An essential feature of our model is a\nfully self-consistent computation of the molecular gas temperature and\nexcitation structure. We find that, while the shape of the SLED is ultimately\ndetermined by difficult-to-observe quantities such as the gas density,\ntemperature, and optical depth distributions, all of these quantities are\nwell-correlated with the galaxy's mean star formation rate surface density\n(Sigma_SFR), which is observable. We use this result to develop a model for the\nCO SLED in terms of Sigma_SFR, and show that this model quantitatively\nreproduces the SLEDs of galaxies over a dynamic range of ~200 in SFR surface\ndensity, at redshifts from z=0-6. This model should make it possible to\nsignificantly reduce the uncertainty in deducing molecular gas masses from\nobservations of high-J CO emission. \n\n"}

We implement a new galaxy-wide stellar initial\nmass function (Top Heavy Integrated Galaxy Initial Mass Function, TH-IGIMF) in\nthe semi-analytic model SAG and evaluate its impact on the chemical evolution\nof galaxies. The SFR-dependence of the slope of the TH-IGIMF is found to be key\nto reproducing the correct [a/Fe]-stellar mass relation. Massive galaxies reach\nhigher [a/Fe] abundance ratios because they are characterized by more top-heavy\nIMFs as a result of their higher SFR. As a consequence of our analysis, the\nvalue of the minimum embedded star cluster mass and of the slope of the\nembedded cluster mass function, which are free parameters involved in the\nTH-IGIMF theory, are found to be as low as 5 solar masses and 2, respectively.\nA mild downsizing trend is present for galaxies generated assuming either a\nuniversal IMF or a variable TH-IGIMF. We find that, regardless of galaxy mass,\nolder galaxies (with formation redshifts > 2) are formed in shorter time-scales\n(< 2 Gyr), thus achieving larger [a/Fe] values. Hence, the time-scale of galaxy\nformation alone cannot explain the slope of the [a/Fe]-galaxy mass relation,\nbut is responsible for the big dispersion of [a/Fe] abundance ratios at fixed\nstellar mass.We further test the hyphothesis of a TH-IGIMF in elliptical\ngalaxies by looking into mass-to-light ratios, and luminosity functions.

We show that the green valley between the\nblue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxies\nin the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through which\nmost blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. Rather, an analysis that takes\nmorphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blue\nearly-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologies\nare transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly.\nIn contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks,\nand they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation rates\ndecline very slowly. We summarize a range of observations that lead to these\nconclusions, including UV-optical colours and halo masses, which both show a\nstriking dependence on morphological type. We interpret these results in terms\nof the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. We conclude that\nlate-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply of\ngas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustion\nof the remaining gas over several Gyr, driven by secular and/or environmental\nprocesses.

At sufficiently\nlarge scales such as the BAO scale, a standard approach for the bias problem on\nthe basis of the perturbation theory (PT) is to assume the `local bias' model\nin which the density field of biased tracers is deterministically expanded in\nterms of matter density field at the same position. The higher-order bias\nparameters are then determined by combining the power spectrum with\nhigher-order statistics such as the bispectrum. As is pointed out by recent\nstudies, however, nonlinear gravitational evolution naturally induces nonlocal\nbias terms even if initially starting only with purely local bias. As a matter\nof fact, previous works showed that the second-order nonlocal bias term, which\ncorresponds to the gravitational tidal field, is important to explain the\ncharacteristic scale-dependence of the bispectrum. In this paper we extend the\nnonlocal bias term up to third order, and investigate whether the PT-based\nmodel including nonlocal bias terms can simultaneously explain the power\nspectrum and the bispectrum of simulated halos in $N$-body simulations. We show\nthat the power spectrum, including density and momentum, and the bispectrum\nbetween halo and matter in $N$-body simulations can be simultaneously well\nexplained by the model including up to third-order nonlocal bias terms up to\nk~0.1h/Mpc. Also, the results seem in a good agreement with theoretical\npredictions of a simple coevolution picture, although the agreement is not\nperfect. These demonstration clearly shows a failure of the local bias model\neven at such large scales, and we conclude that nonlocal bias terms should be\nconsistently included in order to model statistics of halos.

We consider whether the presence of additional fields and\nnon-adiabaticity during inflation may have provided an additional source of\nprimordial B-modes competitive with those of the quasi-de Sitter vacuum. In\nparticular, we examine whether the additional sources could provide the\ndominant signal, which could lead to a misinterpretation of the scale of\ninflation.

Remarkably, SIDM fails to significantly lower\nthe central dark matter density at halo peak velocities V$_{max}$ $<$ 30 Km/s.\nThis is due to the fact that the central regions of very low--mass field halos\nhave relatively low central velocity dispersion and densities, leading to time\nscales for SIDM collisions greater than a Hubble time. CDM halos with V$_{max}$\n$<$ 30 km/s have inefficient star formation, and hence weak supernova feedback.\nAt a fixed 2 cm2/g SIDM cross section, the DM content of very low mass CDM and\nSIDM halos differs by no more than a factor of two within 100-200pc.

We use a simple two-parameter model to map\nout the evolution in the emissivity at z>~6 from the new Planck optical depth\ntau measurements, from the constraints provided by quasar absorption spectra\nand from the prevalence of Ly-alpha emission in z~7-8 galaxies.

The other uses global 21 cm measurements to directly constrain low\nredshift (post-reheating) contributions to $\\tau$ in a relatively\nmodel-independent way.

Past surveys\nhave achieved photometric precision of 1-2% by calibrating the survey's stellar\nphotometry with repeated measurements of a large number of stars observed in\nmultiple epochs. The calibration techniques employed by these surveys only\nconsider the relative frame-by-frame photometric zeropoint offset and the focal\nplane position-dependent illumination corrections, which are independent of the\nsource color. However, variations in the wavelength dependence of the\natmospheric transmission and the instrumental throughput induce source\ncolor-dependent systematic errors. These systematic errors must also be\nconsidered to achieve the most precise photometric measurements. In this paper,\nwe examine such systematic chromatic errors using photometry from the Dark\nEnergy Survey (DES) as an example. We define a natural magnitude system for DES\nand calculate the systematic errors on stellar magnitudes, when the atmospheric\ntransmission and instrumental throughput deviate from the natural system. We\nconclude that the systematic chromatic errors caused by the change of airmass\nin each exposure, the change of the precipitable water vapor and aerosol in the\natmosphere over time, and the non-uniformity of instrumental throughput over\nthe focal plane, can be up to 2% in some bandpasses.

In this paper, we discuss new\nN-body simulations of massive (6.5x10^4 Msun) star clusters, in which we added\nupgraded recipes for stellar winds and supernova explosion at different\nmetallicity.

In this process, rotational energy of the magnetar is radiated via\nmagnetic dipole radiation and heats the supernova ejecta. However, if magnetars\nare highly distorted in their geometric shape, rotational energy is mainly lost\nas gravitational wave radiation and thus such magnetars cannot power SLSNe.

Cosmic voids\nare usually identified in spectroscopic galaxy surveys, where 3D information\nabout the large-scale structure of the Universe is available. Although an\nincreasing amount of photometric data is being produced, its potential for void\nstudies is limited since photometric redshifts induce line-of-sight position\nerrors of $\\sim50$ Mpc/$h$ or more that can render many voids undetectable. In\nthis paper we present a new void finder designed for photometric surveys,\nvalidate it using simulations, and apply it to the high-quality photo-$z$\nredMaGiC galaxy sample of the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification (DES-SV)\ndata. The algorithm works by projecting galaxies into 2D slices and finding\nvoids in the smoothed 2D galaxy density field of the slice. Fixing the\nline-of-sight size of the slices to be at least twice the photo-$z$ scatter,\nthe number of voids found in these projected slices of simulated spectroscopic\nand photometric galaxy catalogs is within 20% for all transverse void sizes,\nand indistinguishable for the largest voids of radius $\\sim 70$ Mpc/$h$ and\nlarger. The positions, radii, and projected galaxy profiles of photometric\nvoids also accurately match the spectroscopic void sample.

The multi-epoch and ultra\nwide field (but relatively low resolution) part of the survey was provided by\n15 nights of observation with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) over a period\nof approximately a month, contemporaneous with K2 observations of the field.\nThe multi-resolution aspect of the survey was provided by the low resolution\n(4') MWA imaging, complemented by non-contemporaneous but much higher\nresolution (20\") observations using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT).\nThe survey is therefore sensitive to the details of radio structures across a\nwide range of angular scales. Consistent with other recent low radio frequency\nsurveys, no significant radio transients or variables were detected in the\nsurvey. The resulting source catalogs consist of 1,085 and 1,468 detections in\nthe two MWA observation bands (centered at 154 and 185 MHz, respectively) and\n7,445 detections in the GMRT observation band (centered at 148 MHz), over 314\nsquare degrees.

We present\nthe first spatially resolved analysis of Cas A based on Spitzer and Herschel\ninfrared and submillimetre data at a common resolution of ~0.6 arcmin for this\n5 arcmin diameter remnant following a careful removal of contaminating line\nemission and synchrotron radiation. We fit the dust continuum from 17 to 500\nmicron with a four-component interstellar medium (ISM) and supernova (SN) dust\nmodel. We find a concentration of cold dust in the unshocked ejecta of Cas A\nand derive a mass of 0.3-0.5 Msun of silicate grains freshly produced in the\nSNR, with a lower limit of >=0.1-0.2 Msun. For a mixture of 50% of\nsilicate-type grains and 50% of carbonaceous grains, we derive a total SN dust\nmass between 0.4 Msun and 0.6 Msun. These dust mass estimates are higher than\nfrom most previous studies of Cas A and support the scenario of supernova\ndominated dust production at high redshifts. We furthermore derive an\ninterstellar extinction map for the field around Cas A which towards Cas A\ngives average values of A_V=6-8 mag, up to a maximum of A_V=15 mag. \n\n"}

We derive constraints from a combination of current and future\ncosmological datasets on the total neutrino mass $M_\\nu$ and on the mass\nfractions carried by each of the mass eigenstates, after marginalizing over the\n(unknown) neutrino mass ordering, either normal (NH) or inverted (IH). The\nbounds take therefore into account the uncertainty related to our ignorance of\nthe mass hierarchy. This novel approach is carried out in the framework of\nBayesian analysis of a typical hierarchical problem. In this context, the\nchoice of the neutrino mass ordering is modeled via the discrete hyperparameter\n$h_{type}$. The preference for either the NH or the IH scenarios is then\nencoded in the posterior distribution of $h_{type}$ itself. Current CMB\nmeasurements assign equal odds to the two hierarchies, and are thus unable to\ndistinguish between them. However, after the addition of BAO measurements, a\nweak preference for NH appears, with odds of 4:3 from Planck temperature and\nlarge-scale polarization in combination with BAO (3:2 if small-scale\npolarization is also included). Forecasts suggest that the combination of\nupcoming CMB (COrE) and BAO surveys (DESI) may determine the neutrino mass\nhierarchy at a high statistical significance if the mass is very close to the\nminimal value allowed by oscillations, as for NH and $M_\\nu=0.06$ eV there is a\n9:1 preference of NH vs IH.

The method\nwas shown to be accurate in moderate sized simulations with galaxy images that\nhad relatively high signal-to-noise ratios, and without significant selection\neffects. In this work we introduce a formalism to correct for both shear\nresponse and selection biases. We also observe that, for images with relatively\nlow signal-to-noise ratios, the correlated noise that arises during the\nmetacalibration process results in significant bias, for which we develop a\nsimple empirical correction. To test this formalism, we created large image\nsimulations based on both parametric models and real galaxy images, including\ntests with realistic point-spread functions. We varied the point-spread\nfunction ellipticity at the five percent level. In each simulation we applied a\nsmall, few percent shear to the galaxy images.

To do so, we study the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) information\ncontent as a function of the orientation of galaxy clustering modes with\nrespect to their angle to the line-of-sight (LOS). The clustering along the\nLOS, as observed in a redshift-space with significant redshift uncertainty, has\ncontributions from clustering modes with a range of orientations with respect\nto the true LOS. For redshift uncertainty $\\sigma_z \\geq 0.02(1+z)$ we find\nthat while the BAO information is confined to transverse clustering modes in\nthe true space, it is spread nearly evenly in the observed space.

However, there may be significant bias and\nscatter in these measurements due to, among other things, the so-called\nmass-sheet degeneracy. To estimate these uncertainties, we analyze strong\nlenses from the largest EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation. We apply a mass-sheet\ntransformation to the radial density profiles of lenses, and by selecting\nlenses near isothermality, we find that the bias on H0 can be reduced to 5%\nwith an intrinsic scatter of 10%, confirming previous results performed on a\ndifferent simulation data set. We further investigate whether combining lensing\nobservables with kinematic constraints helps to minimize this bias. We do not\ndetect any significant dependence of the bias on lens model parameters or\nobservational properties of the galaxy, but depending on the source--lens\nconfiguration, a bias may still exist. Cross lenses provide an accurate\nestimate of the Hubble constant, while fold (double) lenses tend to be biased\nlow (high).

These groups have mass estimates in the range\n2x10^13-7x10^14Msun, and group-to-cluster mass ratios as low as 0.02. The\ncomoving number density of X-ray groups in the infall regions is ~25x higher\nthan that seen for isolated X-ray groups from the XXL survey.

Correctly identifying\nthe class to which this burst belongs requires comparison with other GRBs\ndetected by the Fermi GBM. The aim of our analysis is to classify Fermi GRBs\nand to test whether or not GRB170817A belongs - as suggested - to the Short GRB\nclass. The Fermi GBM catalog provides a large database with many measured\nvariables that can be used to explore gamma-ray burst classification.

We apply the SAM to halo\nmerger trees constructed from a collisionless N-body simulation sharing\nidentical initial conditions to the hydrodynamic suite, and calibrate the free\nparameters against the stellar mass function predicted by the hydrodynamic\nsimulations at z = 5. By making comparisons of the star formation history and\ngas components calculated by the two modelling techniques, we find that\nsemi-analytic prescriptions that are commonly adopted in the literature of\nlow-redshift galaxy formation do not accurately represent dwarf galaxy\nproperties in the hydrodynamic simulation at earlier times. We propose 3\nmodifications to SAMs that will provide more accurate high-redshift\nsimulations. These include 1) the halo mass and baryon fraction which are\noverestimated by collisionless N-body simulations; 2) the star formation\nefficiency which follows a different cosmic evolutionary path from the\nhydrodynamic simulation; and 3) the cooling rate which is not well defined for\ndwarf galaxies at high redshift. Accurate semi-analytic modelling of dwarf\ngalaxy formation informed by detailed hydrodynamical modelling will facilitate\nreliable semi-analytic predictions over the large volumes needed for the study\nof reionization. \n\n"}

II:\n  Application to Diffuse Interstellar Radio Synchrotron Emission Abstract: Diagnostics of polarized emission provide us with valuable information on the\nGalactic magnetic field and the state of turbulence in the interstellar medium,\nwhich cannot be obtained from synchrotron intensity alone. In Paper I (Herron\net al. 2017b), we derived polarization diagnostics that are rotationally and\ntranslationally invariant in the $Q$-$U$ plane, similar to the polarization\ngradient. In this paper, we apply these diagnostics to simulations of ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence that have a range of sonic and Alfv\\'enic Mach\nnumbers. We generate synthetic images of Stokes $Q$ and $U$ for these\nsimulations, for the cases where the turbulence is illuminated from behind by\nuniform polarized emission, and where the polarized emission originates from\nwithin the turbulent volume. From these simulated images we calculate the\npolarization diagnostics derived in Paper I, for different lines of sight\nrelative to the mean magnetic field, and for a range of frequencies. For all of\nour simulations, we find that the polarization gradient is very similar to the\ngeneralized polarization gradient, and that both trace spatial variations in\nthe magnetoionic medium for the case where emission originates within the\nturbulent volume, provided that the medium is not supersonic. We propose a\nmethod for distinguishing the cases of emission coming from behind or within a\nturbulent, Faraday rotating medium, and a method to partly map the rotation\nmeasure of the observed region. We also speculate on statistics of these\ndiagnostics that may allow us to constrain the physical properties of an\nobserved turbulent region. \n\n"}

In\nthis work, mass is defined using an overdensity criteria of 200 relative to the\nmean background density. Our emulator is constructed from the AEMULUS\nsimulations, a suite of 40 N-body simulations with snapshots from z=3 to z=0.\nThese simulations cover the flat wCDM parameter space allowed by recent Cosmic\nMicrowave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Type Ia Supernovae\nresults, varying the parameters w, Omega_m, Omega_b, sigma_8, N_{eff}, n_s, and\nH_0.

Abstract: The similarity between the distributions of spins for galaxies ($\\lambda_{\\rm\ng}$) and for dark-matter haloes ($\\lambda_{\\rm h}$), indicated both by\nsimulations and observations, is naively interpreted as a one-to-one\ncorrelation between the spins of a galaxy and its host halo. This is used to\npredict galaxy sizes in semi-analytic models via $R_{\\rm e}\\simeq\\lambda_{\\rm\nh} R_{\\rm v}$, with $R_{\\rm e}$ the half-mass radius of the galaxy and $R_{\\rm\nv}$ the halo radius. Utilizing two different suites of zoom-in cosmological\nsimulations, we find that $\\lambda_{\\rm g}$ and $\\lambda_{\\rm h}$ are in fact\nonly barely correlated, especially at $z\\geq 1$. A general smearing of this\ncorrelation is expected based on the different spin histories, where the more\nrecently accreted baryons through streams gain and then lose significant\nangular momentum compared to the gradually accumulated dark matter. Expecting\nthe spins of baryons and dark matter to be correlated at accretion into $R_{\\rm\nv}$, the null correlation at the end reflects an anti-correlation between\n$\\lambda_{\\rm g}/\\lambda_{\\rm h}$ and $\\lambda_{\\rm h}$, which can partly arise\nfrom mergers and a compact star-forming phase that many galaxies undergo. On\nthe other hand, the halo and galaxy spin vectors tend to be aligned, with a\nmedian $\\cos\\theta=0.6$-0.7 between galaxy and halo, consistent with\ninstreaming within a preferred plane. The galaxy spin is better correlated with\nthe spin of the inner halo, but this largely reflects the effect of the baryons\non the halo. Following the null spin correlation, $\\lambda_{\\rm h}$ is not a\nuseful proxy for $R_{\\rm e}$. While our simulations reproduce a general\nrelation of the sort $R_{\\rm e}=AR_{\\rm vir}$, in agreement with observational\nestimates, the relation becomes tighter with $A=0.02(c/10)^{-0.7}$, where $c$\nis the halo concentration, which in turn introduces a dependence on mass and\nredshift. \n\n"}

The CO\nobservation shows that the SNR delineated by the radio emission is projectively\ncovered by a molecular cloud (MC) complex at V$_{\\rm {LSR}}$ = $-60$ to $-54$\nkm s$^{-1}$. Both the symmetric axis of the radio emission and the trailing\nX-ray PWN appear projectively to be along a gap between two molecular gas\npatches at $-58$ to $-57$ km s$^{-1}$. Asymmetric broad profiles of $^{12}$CO\nlines peaked at $-58$ km s$^{-1}$ are found at the eastern and southwestern\nedges of the radio emission. This represents a kinematic signature consistent\nwith an SNR-MC interaction. We also find that a superbubble, $\\sim 37'$ in\nradius, appears to surround the SNR from HI 21cm (V$_{\\rm {LSR}} \\sim -61$ to\n$-68$ km s$^{-1}$), WISE mid-IR, and optical extinction data.

This\napproach mitigates any incomplete understanding of local dark matter-visible\nmatter degeneracies that can affect the determination of the VDF. Comparing\nwith the oft used Standard Halo Model (SHM), which assumes an isothermal VDF,\nwe look at how the tail of the empirically determined VDF alters our\ninterpretation of the present direct detection WIMP DM cross section exclusion\nlimits. While previous studies have suggested a very large difference (of more\nthan an order of magnitude) in the bounds at low DM masses, we show that\naccounting for the detector response at low threshold energies, the difference\nis still significant although less extreme. The change in the number of signal\nevents, when using the empirically determined DM VDF in contrast to the SHM\nVDF, is most prominent for low DM masses for which the shape of the recoil\nenergy spectrum depends sensitively on the detector threshold energy as well as\ndetector response near the threshold. We demonstrate that these trends carry\nover to the respective DM exclusion limits, modulo detailed understanding of\nthe experimental backgrounds.

It was recently proposed that potentials of the string landscape\nmust satisfy at least two conditions, the \"swampland criteria\", that severely\nrestrict the types of cosmological dynamics they can sustain. The first\ncriterion states that the (multi-field) effective field theory description is\nonly valid over a field displacement $\\Delta \\phi \\leq \\Delta \\sim \\mathcal\nO(1)$ (in units where the Planck mass is 1), measured as a distance in the\ntarget space geometry.

A recent analysis\nconcluded that these two conditions taken together practically rule out\nslow-roll models of inflation.

Possible ejection scenarios are binary supernova ejections (BSE)\nor dynamical ejections from star clusters (DE). Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are\nextreme runaway stars that are potentially unbound from the Galaxy. Powerful\nacceleration mechanisms such as the tidal disruption of a binary system by a\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) are required to produce them. Therefore, HVSs\nare believed to originate in the Galactic center (GC), the only place known to\nhost an SMBH. The second Gaia data release (DR2) offers the opportunity of\nstudying HVSs in an unprecedented manner. We revisit some of the most\ninteresting high-velocity stars, that is, 15 stars for which proper motions\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope were obtained in the pre-Gaia era, to unravel\ntheir origin. By carrying out kinematic analyses based on revised\nspectrophotometric distances and proper motions from Gaia DR2, kinematic\nproperties were obtained that help constrain the spatial origins of these\nstars.

We present a\nframework for constraining both the redshift probability distributions of\ngalaxy populations and the redshifts of their individual members.

We explore their\nimpact on void clustering using both the DEMNUni and MassiveNuS simulations.\nFor voids, neutrino effects depend on the observed void tracers. As the\nneutrino mass increases, the number of small voids traced by cold dark matter\nparticles increases and the number of large voids decreases.

The interplay of these\nsignatures in the void abundance and clustering leaves a distinct fingerprint\nthat could be detected with observations and potentially help break\ndegeneracies between different cosmological parameters.

Because of their success, CNN-based methods\nare becoming increasingly popular in Cosmology. Cosmological data often comes\nas spherical maps, which make the use of the traditional CNNs more complicated.\nThe commonly used pixelization scheme for spherical maps is the Hierarchical\nEqual Area isoLatitude Pixelisation (HEALPix). We present a spherical CNN for\nanalysis of full and partial HEALPix maps, which we call DeepSphere. The\nspherical CNN is constructed by representing the sphere as a graph. Graphs are\nversatile data structures that can act as a discrete representation of a\ncontinuous manifold. Using the graph-based representation, we define many of\nthe standard CNN operations, such as convolution and pooling. With filters\nrestricted to being radial, our convolutions are equivariant to rotation on the\nsphere, and DeepSphere can be made invariant or equivariant to rotation. This\nway, DeepSphere is a special case of a graph CNN, tailored to the HEALPix\nsampling of the sphere. This approach is computationally more efficient than\nusing spherical harmonics to perform convolutions. We demonstrate the method on\na classification problem of weak lensing mass maps from two cosmological models\nand compare the performance of the CNN with that of two baseline classifiers.\nThe results show that the performance of DeepSphere is always superior or equal\nto both of these baselines. For high noise levels and for data covering only a\nsmaller fraction of the sphere, DeepSphere achieves typically 10% better\nclassification accuracy than those baselines.

The observed ellipticity pattern of these\ndistant galaxies thus encodes information about the large-scale structure of\nthe universe, but attempts to measure this effect have been inconclusive due to\nsystematic errors. We report the first detection of this ``cosmic shear'' using\n145,000 background galaxies to reveal the dark matter distribution on angular\nscales up to half a degree in three separate lines of sight. The observed\nangular dependence of this effect is consistent with that predicted by two\nleading cosmological models, providing new and independent support for these\nmodels. \n\n"}

If one normalises to galaxy clustering, with $M/L$ fixed\nby small-scale galaxy dynamics, then low density models predict a much stronger\ndistortion. If, however, one normalises to large-scale bulk-flows, the\npredicted distortion for sources at redshifts $Z_s \\sim 1-3$ is rather\ninsensitive to the background cosmology. The signals predicted here can be\ndetected at a very high level of significance with a photometric survey\ncovering say 10 square degrees, but sparse sampling is needed to avoid large\nsampling variance and we discuss the factors influencing the design of an\noptimum survey. Turning to weak lensing by clusters we find that for high lens\nredshifts ($Z_l\\simeq1$) the critical density is substantially reduced in\n$\\Lambda$ models, but that the ratio of the shear or convergence to the\nvelocity dispersions or X-ray temperature of clusters is only very weakly\ndependent on the cosmology. \n\n"}

We consider the ellipticity correlation\nfunction, the mean-square ellipticity, the ellipticity power spectrum, and a\nglobal maximum-likelihood analysis to isolate a weak-lensing signal from the\ndata. Estimates for the sensitivity of a survey of a given area, surface\ndensity, and mean intrinsic source ellipticity are presented. We then apply our\nresults to the FIRST radio-source survey. We predict an rms ellipticity of\nroughly 0.011 in $1^\\circ \\times 1^\\circ$ pixels and 0.018 in $20' \\times 20'$\npixels if the power spectrum is normalized to $\\sigma_8 \\Omega^{0.53} = 0.6$,\nas indicated by the cluster abundance. The signal is significantly larger in\nsome models if the power spectrum is normalized instead to the COBE anisotropy.\nThe uncertainty in the predictions from imprecise knowledge of the FIRST\nredshift distribution is about 25% in the rms ellipticity.

With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded\nset of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place\nconstraints on the Hubble constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the\ncosmological constant (Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and the\ndynamical age of the Universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia\nare, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density\n(Omega_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve\nfitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor\neternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e.,\nOmega_Lambda > 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 < 0).\nWith no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M > 0, the\nspectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q_0 <0 at the 2.8 sigma\nand 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda >0 at the 3.0 sigma and\n4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a\n``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection,\nOmega_Lambda>0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior\n(Omega_M+Omega_Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require\nOmega_Lambda >0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A\nUniverse closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M=1) is ruled out at the 7\nsigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including\nevolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational\nlensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles\nthe data with Omega_Lambda=0 and q_0 > 0. \n\n"}

The magnitude-redshift data for these SNe, at redshifts between 0.18\nand 0.83, are fit jointly with a set of SNe from the Calan/Tololo Supernova\nSurvey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological\nparameters. All SN peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia lightcurve\nwidth-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability\ndistribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the\nrelation 0.8 Omega_M - 0.6 Omega_Lambda ~= -0.2 +/- 0.1 in the region of\ninterest (Omega_M <~ 1.5). For a flat (Omega_M + Omega_Lambda = 1) cosmology we\nfind Omega_M = 0.28{+0.09,-0.08} (1 sigma statistical) {+0.05,-0.04}\n(identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Lambda = 0\nflat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Lambda = 0\ncosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the\ncosmological constant is non-zero and positive, with a confidence of P(Lambda >\n0) = 99%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age\nof the universe relative to the Hubble time is t_0 = 14.9{+1.4,-1.1} (0.63/h)\nGyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety\nof statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We\nfind no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or\nMalmquist bias between the low-redshift Calan/Tololo sample and our\nhigh-redshift sample.
