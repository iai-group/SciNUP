Logic of the emergent\ntheory is rather intuitionistic than classical.

Rotations of material\npoints are described mathematically by attaching to each geometric point an\northonormal basis which gives a field of orthonormal bases called the coframe.\nAs the dynamical variables (unknowns) of our theory we choose a coframe and a\ndensity. We then add an extra (third) spatial dimension, extend our coframe and\ndensity into dimension 1+3, choose a conformally invariant Lagrangian\nproportional to axial torsion squared, roll up the extra dimension into a\ncircle so as to incorporate mass and return to our original (1+2)-dimensional\nspacetime by separating out the extra coordinate.

Abstract: The question of what it means for a theory to describe the same physics on\nall spacetimes (SPASs) is discussed. As there may be many answers to this\nquestion, we isolate a necessary condition, the SPASs property, that should be\nsatisfied by any reasonable notion of SPASs. This requires that if two theories\nconform to a common notion of SPASs, with one a subtheory of the other, and are\nisomorphic in some particular spacetime, then they should be isomorphic in all\nglobally hyperbolic spacetimes (of given dimension). The SPASs property is\nformulated in a functorial setting broad enough to describe general physical\ntheories describing processes in spacetime, subject to very minimal\nassumptions. By explicit constructions, the full class of locally covariant\ntheories is shown not to satisfy the SPASs property, establishing that there is\nno notion of SPASs encompassing all such theories. It is also shown that all\nlocally covariant theories obeying the time-slice property possess two local\nsubstructures, one kinematical (obtained directly from the functorial\nstructure) and the other dynamical (obtained from a natural form of dynamics,\ntermed relative Cauchy evolution).

Overview Abstract: The operator algebraic framework plays an important role in mathematical\nphysics. Many different operator algebras exist for example for a theory of\nquantum mechanics. In Loop Quantum Gravity only two algebras have been\nintroduced until now. In the project about 'Algebras of Quantum Variables (AQV)\nfor LQG' the known holonomy-flux *-algebra and the Weyl C*-algebra will be\nmodified and a set of new algebras will be proposed and studied. The idea of\nthe construction of these algebras is to establish a finite set of operators,\nwhich generates (in the sense of Woronowicz, Schm\\\"udgen and Inoue) the\ndifferent O*- or C*-algebras of quantum gravity and to use inductive limits of\nthese algebras. In the Loop Quantum Gravity approach usually the basic\nclassical variables are connections and fluxes. Studying the three constraints\nappearing in the canonical quantisation of classical general relativity in the\nADM-formalism some other variables like curvature appear. Consequently the main\ndifficulty of a quantisation of gravity is to find a suitable replacement of\nthe set of elementary classical variables and constraints.

Secondly, the algebra of quantum variables is said to be physical if\nit contains complete observables.

In fact both commonplaces are wrong.\nThough it is not widely known, Ogievetsky and Polubarinov (OP) constructed\nspinors in coordinates in 1965, helping to spawn nonlinear group\nrepresentations. Locally, these spinors resemble the orthonormal basis or\n\"tetrad\" formalism in the symmetric gauge, but they are conceptually\nself-sufficient. The tetrad formalism is de-Ockhamized, with 6 extra fields and\n6 compensating gauge symmetries. OP spinors, as developed nonperturbatively by\nBilyalov, admit any coordinates at a point, but \"time\" must be listed first:\nthe product of the metric components and the matrix diag(-1,1,1,1) must have no\nnegative eigenvalues to yield a real symmetric square root function of the\nmetric. Thus the admissible coordinates depend on the types and values of the\nfields. Apart from coordinate order and spinorial two-valuedness, OP spinors\nform, with the metric, a nonlinear geometric object, with Lie and covariant\nderivatives. Such spinors avoid a spurious absolute object in the\nAnderson-Friedman analysis of substantive general covariance. They also permit\nthe gauge-invariant localization of the infinite-component gravitational energy\nin GR. Density-weighted spinors exploit the conformal invariance of the\nmassless Dirac equation to show that the volume element is absent. Thus instead\nof a matrix with 16 components, one can use weighted OP spinors coupled to the\n9-component symmetric unimodular square root of the conformal metric density.\nThe surprising mildness of the restrictions on coordinates for the\nSchwarzschild solution is exhibited.

Such numbers are in general uncomputable using any\nreal-world resources, and, if we have the idea of physical law as some kind of\ncomputational algorithm of the universe, we would be compelled to alter our\ndescriptions of physics to be consistent with computable numbers. Our purpose\nhere is to examine the geometric implications of using finite fields Fp and\nfinite complexified fields Fp^2 (based on primes p congruent to 3 mod{4}) as\nthe basis for computations in a theory of discrete quantum computing, which\nwould therefore become a computable theory. Because the states of a discrete\nn-qubit system are in principle enumerable, we are able to determine the\nproportions of entangled and unentangled states. In particular, we extend the\nHopf fibration that defines the irreducible state space of conventional\ncontinuous n-qubit theories (which is the complex projective space CP{2^{n}-1})\nto an analogous discrete geometry in which the Hopf circle for any n is found\nto be a discrete set of p+1 points.

E.g., a closed subset A of M has a compact intersection\nwith all Cauchy surfaces if and only if A is contained in J(K) for some compact\nset K. (However, it does not suffice to consider only those Cauchy surfaces\nthat partake in a given foliation of M.)

While Finsler geometry is a natural\nextension of Riemannian geometry, Kawaguchi geometry is the extension of\nFinsler geometry to higher order derivatives and to k-dimensional parameter\nspace. The latter extension is also called areal geometry in some references.\nOn Finsler (Kawaguchi) manifold, we can define a reparameterisation invariant 1\n(k)-dimensional area by the Hilbert (Kawaguchi) form, which we take as an\naction. The equation of motion obtained from such action also has the property\nof reparameterisation invariance. In this framework, the solution manifold of\nthe Euler-Lagrange equation is realised as a submanifold of Finsler/Kawaguchi\nmanifold, and no fibered structure over the parameter space is needed. We also\nshow that for the case of first order k-dimensional parameter space and second\norder 1-dimensional parameter space, a global Lagrangian could be constructed.\nFor second order k-dimensional parameter space, Lagrangian is not global but it\nstill has the reparameterisation invariant property. Such theory is expected to\nprovide the ideal stage for formulating fundamental theories of physics,\nespecially for cases such as when one needs to consider the mixing of spacetime\nand field variables.

Namely, the spectrum of the quantum transfer matrix for the\ninhomogeneous ${\\mathfrak g}{\\mathfrak l}_n$-invariant XXX spin chain on $N$\nsites with twisted boundary conditions can be found in terms of velocities of\nparticles in the rational $N$-body Ruijsenaars-Schneider model.

Gauge theory\nconsiderations led to the concept of local mathematics, as expressed through\nthe use of universes, as collections of local mathematical systems at each\npoint, x, of a space time manifold, M. Both local and global coordinate charts\nare described. These map M into either local or global coordinate systems\nwithin a universe or between universes, respectively.

Finally, as an\napplication, we consider the reduction of the obtained stress-energy tensor in\nbilinear form, under the assumption of spherical symmetry. \n\n"}

To\nconstruct global solutions we use a combination of energy estimates and\nmatching dispersive estimates. There is a significant new difficulty in proving\nenergy estimates in our problem, namely the combination of slow pointwise decay\nof solutions (no better than $|t|^{-5/6}$) and the presence of a large,\ncodimension 1, set of quadratic time-resonances. To deal with such a situation\nwe propose here a new mechanism, which exploits a non-degeneracy property of\nthe time-resonant hypersurfaces and some special structure of the quadratic\npart of the nonlinearity, connected to the conserved energy of the system.

This problem connects to the classical\ntheory of special functions and, more specifically, to the Hermite as well as\nthe Kummer hypergeometric functions. Reconstructing the solution of the\noriginal diffusion model from novel self-similar solutions of the associated\nself-similar PDE, we infer that the $t^{-1/2}$ decay law of the diffusion\namplitude is {\\it not necessary}. In particular, it is possible to engineer\nsetups of {\\it both} the Cauchy problem and the initial-boundary value problem\nin which the solution decays at a {\\it different rate}. Nevertheless, we\nobserve that the $t^{-1/2}$ rate corresponds to the dominant decay mode among\nintegrable initial data, i.e., ones corresponding to finite mass.

It is well-known that for pure states, essentially all\nentanglement measures are equal to the v. Neumann entropy of the reduced state,\nbut for mixed states, this uniqueness is lost. In quantum field theory,\nbipartite systems are associated with causally disjoint regions. There are no\nseparable (normal) states to begin with when the regions touch each other, so\none must leave a finite \"safety-corridor\". Due to this corridor, the normal\nstates of bipartite systems are necessarily mixed, and the v. Neumann entropy\nis not a good entanglement measure in the above sense.\n  In this paper, we study various entanglement measures which vanish on\nseparable states, do not increase under separable (local) operations, and have\nother desirable properties. In particular, we study the relative entanglement\nentropy, defined as the minimum relative entropy between the given state and an\narbitrary separable state.

They are also important for the conceptual understanding\nof quantum theory because projection operators also represent observation\nprocess on quantum system. In this paper we explore the algebra of quantum\nidempotents and show that they generate Iterant algebra (defined in the paper),\nLie algebra, Grassmann algebra and Clifford algebra which is very interesting\nbecause these later algebras were introduced for the geometry of spaces and\nhence are called geometric algebras.

Several proposed estimators\nappear to improve this scaling, and our goal is to analyse the problem from the\nperspective of the maximum risk over all states.\n  We propose qubit estimation strategies based on separate and adaptive\nmeasurements, that achieve $1/n$ scalings for the maximum Bures risk.

Here we consider relativistic\nquantum theories with a fixed number of particles that interact neither through\npotentials nor through exchange of bosons. Instead, the interaction can occur\ndirectly along light cones, in a way similar to the Wheeler-Feynman formulation\nof classical electrodynamics. For two particles, the wave function is here of\nthe form $\\psi(x_1,x_2)$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are spacetime points.\nSpecifically, we consider a natural class of covariant equations governing the\ntime evolution of $\\psi$ involving integration over light cones, or even more\ngeneral spacetime regions. It is not obvious, however, whether these equations\npossess a unique solution for every initial datum. We prove for\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes (certain cosmological curved\nspacetimes with a Big Bang singularity, i.e., with a beginning in time) that in\nthe case of purely retarded interactions there does, in fact, exist a unique\nsolution for every datum on the initial hypersurface. The proof is based on\ncarrying over similar results for a Minkowski half-space (i.e., the future of a\nspacelike hyperplane) to curved spacetime. Furthermore, we show that also in\nthe case of time-symmetric interactions and for spacetimes with both a Big Bang\nand a Big Crunch solutions do exist.

These approximants extend\nthe Taylor convergence radii computed for usual cosmographic series. We thus\nconsider both Pad\\'e and the rational Chebyshev polynomials. They can be used\nto accurately describe the universe late-time expansion history, providing\nfurther information on the thermal properties of all effective cosmic fluids\nentering the energy momentum tensor of Palatini's gravity. To perform our\nnumerical analysis, we relate the Palatini's Ricci scalar with the Hubble\nparameter $H$ and thus we write down a single differential equation in terms of\nthe redshift $z$. Therefore, to bound $f(R)$, we make use of the most recent\noutcomes over the cosmographic parameters obtained from combined data surveys.\nIn particular our clue is to select two scenarios, i.e. $(2,2)$ Pad\\'e and\n$(2,1)$ Chebyshev approximations, since they well approximate the luminosity\ndistance at the lowest possible order.

The motivation for such an\nanalysis and a further result is the fact that a unitary transformation of this\nkind arises naturally in scattering theory on non-stationary backgrounds.\nIndeed, employing the perturbation theory of the Yang-Feldman equations with a\nfree CCR field in a quasifree state as an initial condition and making use of\nextended Feynman graphs, we are able to calculate the Wightman functions of the\ninteracting and outgoing fields in a $\\phi^p$-theory on arbitrary curved\nspacetimes.

It is, however,\nnontrivial to identify and project onto H_phys when zero is not in the point\nspectrum but instead is in the continuous spectrum of Q, because in this case\nthe kernel of Q is empty.\n  Here, we observe that the topology of the underlying Hilbert space can be\nharmlessly modified in the direction perpendicular to the constraint surface in\nsuch a way that Q becomes non-self-adjoint. This procedure then allows us to\nconveniently obtain H_phys as the proper Hilbert subspace H_phys = ker(Q*), on\nwhich one can project as usual. In the simplest case, the necessary change of\ntopology amounts to passing from an L^2 Hilbert space to a Sobolev space. \n\n"}

Exact solutions of the transformation kernels and the phase\nspace propagators are given for the three fundamental canonical maps as\nfractional-linear, gauge and contact (point) transformations. Under the\nnonlinear maps a phase space representation is mapped to another phase space\nrepresentation thereby extending the standard concept of covariance. This\nextended covariance allows Dirac-Jordan transformation theory to naturally\nemerge from the Hilbert space representations in the Weyl quantization. \n\n"}

Moreover, the approach presented here, which is based on\nKlein's inequality and one of Lieb's less well-known concave trace functions,\nallows one to obtain conditions for equality. Using the fact that the Holevo\nbound on the accessible information in a quantum ensemble can be obtained as a\nconsequence of the monotonicity of relative entropy, we show that equality can\nbe attained for that bound only when the states in the ensemble commute. The\npaper concludes with an Appendix giving a short description of Epstein's\nelegant proof of the relevant concavity theorem of Lieb. \n\n"}
