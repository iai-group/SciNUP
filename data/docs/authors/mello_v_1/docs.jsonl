Moreover, the\nexperimentally-observed elongation of cubic perovskite-like lattice along the\n[111] direction is correctly reproduced. At high pressure we predicted a\npressure-induced structural transition and the total energy calculations at\nexpanded lattice show two lower energy ferroelectric phases, closer in energy\nto the ground state phase. Band-structure calculations show that BiFeO$_3$ will\nbe an insulator in A- and G-type antiferromagnetic phases and a metal in other\nmagnetic configurations. Chemical bonding in BiFeO$_3$ has been analyzed using\nvarious tools and electron localization function analysis shows that\nstereochemically active lone-pair electrons at the Bi sites are responsible for\ndisplacements of the Bi atoms from the centro-symmetric to the\nnoncentrosymmetric structure and hence the ferroelectricity.

Assuming the\nelectrical neutrality and beta equilibrium for the stellar matter, we have\nstudied how the density dependence of lepton chemical potentials varies for\ndifferent models of nuclear interactions that are constrained by experiments up\nto nuclear matter density, n_0, but extrapolate differently(unconstrained)\nbeyond n_0 and calculated the relative abundances of nucleons(neutron and\nproton) and leptons(electron and muon) and their density dependencies.

It is found that the flow, during its infall from\nthe Keplerian to sub-Keplerian transition region to the black hole event\nhorizon, passes through various phases of advection -- general advective\nparadigm to radiatively inefficient phase and vice versa.

The X-ray spectrum is characterized by two main peculiar\nfeatures, i) a strong soft excess with a steep rise below about 1.3 keV and ii)\na deep drop in flux above 8.2 keV. We focus here on a reflection-based\ninterpretation which interprets both features, as well as the large soft\nexcess, in terms of partially ionized reflection off the inner accretion disc.\nWe show that the two peculiar spectral features mentioned above can be\nreproduced by two relativistic emission lines due to Fe K and Fe L. The lines\nare produced in the inner accretion disc and independently yield consistent\ndisc parameters. We argue that the high L/K intensity ratio is broadly\nconsistent with expectations from an ionized accretion disc reflection,\nindicating that they belong to a single ionized reflection component. The\nspectral shape, X-ray flux, and variability properties are very similar in the\nXMM-Newton and Suzaku observations, performed about 5 years apart. The overall\nX-ray spectrum and variability can be described by a simple two-component model\ncomprising a steep power law continuum plus its ionised reflection off the\ninner accretion disc.

We identify significant\nsystematic effects in this procedure that can artificially induce an additional\ndiffuse component with a morphology strikingly similar to the claimed gamma-ray\nhaze. To quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of the\nratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density,\nand of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models\nand simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM\ntemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by\napproximately 20%. Additionally, the synchrotron template tends to\nunder-estimate the IC emission at low energies (few GeV) and to over-estimate\nit at higher energies (tens of GeV) by potentially large factors that depend\ncrucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the Galaxy. The size of\nthe systematic effects we find are comparable to the size of the claimed \"Fermi\nhaze\" signal.

A way to select\nheavily obscured AGN is to compare the X-ray emission below 10 keV (which is\nstrongly depressed) with the emission from other bands less affected by the\nabsorption, i.e. the IR band.

In anticipation of the first detections, the\nexpected distribution of GW sources in the local universe is of considerable\ninterest.

The fact that these binary systems acquire large barycentric\nvelocities at birth (\"kicks\") results in merger site distributions that are\nmore diffusely distributed with respect to their putative hosts, with mergers\noccurring out to distances of a few Mpc from the host halo.

These sources, powered by outflows from\nan AGN, allow the beam power and total outflow energy to be studied. In a broad\nclass of models, the beam power of the outflow is related to the spin of the\nblack hole. This relationship is used to estimate black hole spins for 55 radio\nsources. The samples studied include 7 FRII quasars and 19 FRII radio galaxies\nwith redshifts between 0.056 and 1.79, and 29 radio sources associated with CD\ngalaxies with redshifts between 0.0035 and 0.291. The FRII sources studied have\nestimated spin values of between about 0.2 and 1; there is a range of values at\na given redshift, and the values tend to increase with increasing redshift.\nResults obtained for FRII quasars are very similar to those obtained for FRII\ngalaxies.

These objects can in principle easily accelerate particles to the highest\nenergies required to satisfy the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray scenario\n(E~10^{20-21} eV), thanks to their important rotational and magnetic energy\nreservoirs. Their acceleration mechanism, based on unipolar induction, predicts\nhowever a hard particle injection that does not fit the observed ultrahigh\nenergy cosmic ray spectrum. Here we show that an adequate distribution of\ninitial voltages among magnetar winds can be found to soften the spectrum. We\ndiscuss the effect of these distributions for the stochastic gravitational wave\nbackground signature produced by magnetars. The magnetar population\ncharacteristics needed to fit the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum could\nlead in most optimistic cases to gravitational wave background signals enhanced\nof up to four orders of magnitudes in the range of frequency 1-100 Hz, compared\nto the standard predictions.

However, the lack of true\nabsorption opacity in the disc means that the emission is better approximated\nby a colour temperature corrected blackbody, and this colour temperature\ncorrection is large enough ($\\sim 2.4$) that the bare disc emission from a zero\nspin black hole can extend into the soft X-ray bandpass. Part of the soft X-ray\nexcess seen in these objects must be intrinsic emission from the disc unless\nthe vertical structure is very different to that predicted.\n  However, the soft excess is much broader than predicted by a bare disc\nspectrum, indicating some Compton upscattering by cool, optically thick\nmaterial. We associate this with the disc itself, so it must ultimately be\npowered by mass accretion. We build an energetically self consistent model\nassuming that the emission thermalises at large radii, but that at smaller\nradii the gravitational energy is split between powering optically thick\nComptonised disc emission (forming the soft X-ray excess) and an optically thin\ncorona above the disc (forming the tail to higher energies).

When\nsufficient gas is driven towards the BH, gravitational instabilities\ngenerically form lopsided, eccentric disks that propagate inwards. The lopsided\nstellar disk exerts a strong torque on the gas disk, driving inflows that fuel\nrapid BH growth. Here, we investigate whether the same gas disk is the 'torus'\ninvoked to explain obscured AGN. The disk is generically thick and has\ncharacteristic ~1-10 pc sizes and masses resembling those required of the\ntorus. The scale heights and obscured fractions of the predicted torii are\nsubstantial even in the absence of strong stellar feedback providing the\nvertical support. Rather, they can be maintained by strong bending modes and\nwarps excited by the inflow-generating instabilities. Other properties commonly\nattributed to feedback processes may be explained by dynamical effects:\nmisalignment between torus and host galaxy, correlations between local SFR and\nturbulent gas velocities, and dependence of obscured fractions on AGN\nluminosity or SFR. We compare the predicted torus properties with observations\nof gas surface density profiles, kinematics, scale heights, and SFR densities\nin AGN nuclei, and find that they are consistent. We argue that it is not\npossible to reproduce these observations and the observed column density (N_H)\ndistribution without a clumpy gas distribution, but allowing for clumping on\nsmall scales the predicted N_H distribution is in good agreement with\nobservations from 10^20-27 cm^-2.

The criterion to enter the pair\ninstability regime in density and temperature is basically controlled by the\nmass of the oxygen core. The main sequence masses that produce a given oxygen\ncore mass are, in turn, dependent on metallicity, mass loss, and convective and\nrotationally-induced mixing. We examine the evolution of massive stars to\ndetermine the minimum main sequence mass that can encounter pair-instability\neffects, either a pulsational pair instability (PPISN) or a full-fledged\npair-instability supernova (PISN). We concentrate on zero-metallicity stars\nwith no mass loss subject to the Schwarzschild criterion for convective\ninstability, but also explore solar metallicity and mass loss and the Ledoux\ncriterion. As expected, for sufficiently strong rotationally-induced mixing,\nthe minimum main sequence mass is encountered for conditions that induce\neffectively homogeneous evolution such that the original mass is converted\nalmost entirely to helium and then to oxygen. For this case, we find that the\nminimum main sequence mass is ~40 Msun to encounter PPISN and ~65 Msun to\nencounter a PISN. When mass-loss is taken into account those mass limits become\n~50 Msun for PPISN and ~80 Msun for PISN progenitors.

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source\ncovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters\nsubstantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3\nobserved with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind\nabsorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a\ncompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of\n-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio. This method in principle can also be applied to any accreting\ncompact objects with detectable accretion disk wind absorption line features. \n\n"}

Among the GRBs whose time-resolved\nspectrum is available for the first pulse, almost half (15/32 GRBs) show clear\nhard-to-soft evolution, and the other half (17/32 GRBs) show clear\nintensity-tracking.

In order to investigate\nthe effect of very strong magnetic field, we focus only on systems in which a\nmaximum of either one, two or three Landau level(s) is/are occupied. This is\nimportant since, if a very large number of Landau levels are filled, it implies\na very low magnetic field strength which yields back Chandrasekhar's celebrated\nnon-magnetic results. The maximum number of occupied Landau levels is fixed by\nthe correct choice of two parameters, namely the magnetic field strength and\nthe maximum Fermi energy of the system. We study the equations of state of\nthese one-level, two-level and three-level systems and compare them by taking\nthree different maximum Fermi energies.

Based on the well-defined TOUGH sample of 69\nX-ray selected Swift GRBs, we have targeted the hosts of a subsample of 20 GRBs\nknown from afterglow spectroscopy to be in the redshift range 1.8-4.5. We\ndetect Lya emission from 7 out of the 20 hosts, with the typical limiting\n3sigma line flux being 8E-18 erg/cm2/s, corresponding to a Lya luminosity of\n6E41 erg/s at z=3. The Lya luminosities for the 7 hosts in which we detect Lya\nemission are in the range (0.6-2.3)E42 erg/s corresponding to star-formation\nrates of 0.6-2.1 Msun/yr (not corrected for extinction). The rest-frame Lya\nequivalent widths (EWs) for the 7 hosts are in the range 9-40A. For 6 of the 13\nhosts for which Lya is not detected we place fairly strong 3sigma upper limits\non the EW (<20A), while for others the EW is either unconstrained or has a less\nconstraining upper limit. We find that the distribution of Lya EWs is\ninconsistent with being drawn from the Lya EW distribution of bright Lyman\nbreak galaxies at the 98.3% level, in the sense that the TOUGH hosts on average\nhave larger EWs than bright LBGs. We can exclude an early indication, based on\na smaller, heterogeneous sample of pre-Swift GRB hosts, that all GRB hosts are\nLya emitters. We find that the TOUGH hosts on average have lower EWs than the\npre-Swift GRB hosts, but the two samples are only inconsistent at the 92%\nlevel. The velocity centroid of the Lya line is redshifted by 200-700 km/s with\nrespect to the systemic velocity, similar to what is seen for LBGs, possibly\nindicating star-formation driven outflows from the host galaxies. There seems\nto be a trend between the Lya EW and the optical to X-ray spectral index of the\nafterglow (beta_OX), hinting that dust plays a role in the observed strength\nand even presence of Lya emission.

Two models have been proposed to explain this\nresult. In the ADIOS model, the inward decrease of accretion rate is because of\nthe loss of gas in the outflow. In the CDAF model, the gas is assumed to be\nlocked in convective eddies, which results in the inward decrease of the\naccretion rate. We investigate the nature of inward decrease of accretion rate\nusing HD and MHD simulations. We calculate various properties of inflow and\noutflow, including the mass flux, radial and rotational velocities,\ntemperature, and the Bernoulli parameter ($Be$). Systematic and significant\ndifferences between inflow and outflow are found. These results suggest that\nthe inflow and outflow are not dominated by convective turbulence, but are\nsystematic inward and outward motion. We have also analyzed the convective\nstability of MHD accretion flow and found that they are convectively stable.\nThese results indicate that the ADIOS scenario is favored. The different\nproperties of inflow and outflow also suggest that the mechanisms of producing\noutflow in HD and MHD flows are buoyancy and centrifugal force associated with\nthe magnetic field, respectively. The latter mechanism is similar to the\nBlandford & Payne mechanism. We also study the effect of initial conditions in\nthe simulations.

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM. The galaxies with more turbulent ISM, yet still\ncharacterised by very weak turbulence, can hold larger amounts of the ICM.\n[Abridged] \n\n"}

We present\nobservational diagnostics in terms of power-law forms that can be fit to\nline-free regions in AGN spectra or in fluxes from sequences of broad filters.\nMost interestingly, the change in slope in the broken power-law is almost\nentirely dependent on the width of gap in the accretion disk, which in turn is\nuniquely determined by mass ratio of the black holes, such that it scales\nroughly as q^(5/12).

It was concluded also from these investigations that it is\nproblematic to produce emitting electrons from a background plasma by\nstochastic (Fermi) acceleration because the energy supplied by external sources\nin the form of Fermi acceleration is quickly absorbed by the background plasma.\nIn other words the Fermi acceleration is ineffective for particle acceleration.\nWe revisited this problem and found that at some parameter of acceleration the\nrate of plasma heating is rather low and the acceleration tails of non-thermal\nparticles can be generated and exist for a long time while the plasma\ntemperature is almost constant. We showed also that for some regime of\nacceleration the plasma cools down instead of being heated up, even though\nexternal sources (in the form of external acceleration) supply energy to the\nsystem. The reason is that the acceleration withdraws effectively high energy\nparticles from the thermal pool (analogue of Maxwell demon). \n\n"}

After the discovery of radio millisecond pulsars (MSPs) it was\ntherefore somewhat a paradox (e.g. Ruderman et al. 1989) how these pulsars\ncould retain their fast spins following the Roche-lobe decoupling phase, RLDP.\nHere I present a solution to this so-called \"turn-off problem\" which was\nrecently found by combining binary stellar evolution models with torque\ncomputations (Tauris 2012). The solution is that during the RLDP the spin\nequilibrium of the pulsar is broken and therefore it remains a fast spinning\nobject.

Major components like unresolved\nstar-forming galaxies (making <50% of the EGRB) and blazars (<23%), have failed\nto explain the entire background observed by \\emph{Fermi}. Another, though\nsubdominant, contribution is expected to come from the process of large-scale\nstructure formation. The growth of structures is accompanied by accretion and\nmerger shocks, which would, with at least some magnetic field present, give\nrise to a population of structure-formation cosmic rays (SFCRs). Though\nexpected, this cosmic-ray population is still hypothetical and only very weak\nlimits have been placed to their contribution to the EGRB. The most promising\ninsight into SFCRs was expected to come from \\emph{Fermi}-LAT observations of\nclusters of galaxies, however, only upper limits and no detection have been\nplaced.

The disc is initially threaded by a weak magnetic field\nwhere the magnetic pressure is significantly less than the kinetic pressure in\nthe disc. The viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are modelled by two \"alpha\"\nparameters, while the coronal region above the disc is treated using ideal MHD.\nThe initial magnetic field is taken to consist of three poloidal field loops\nthreading the disc. The motivation for this study is to understand the\nadvection of disc matter and magnetic field by the turbulent/diffusive disc. At\nearly times the innermost field loop twists and its field lines become open.\nThe twisting of the opened field lines leads to the formation of both an inner\ncollimated, magnetically-dominated jet, and at larger distances from the axis a\nmatter dominated uncollimated wind. For later times, the strength of the\nmagnetic field decreases owing to field reconnection and annihilation in the\ndisc. For the early times, we have derived from the simulations both the matter\naccretion speed in the disc and the accretion speed of the magnetic field. We\nshow that the derived matter accretion speed agrees approximately with the\npredictions of a model where the accretion speed is the sum of two terms, one\ndue to the disc's viscosity (which gives a radial outflow of angular momentum\nin the disc), and a second due to the twisted magnetic field at the disc's\nsurface (which gives a vertical outflow of angular momentum). For early times\nwe find that the magnetic contribution is roughly twice the viscous\ncontribution for the case where the alpha parameters are both equal to 0.1.

The method\navoids any explicit reference to canonical representations of either occupied\nor virtual Kohn-Sham states and thus achieves linear-scaling computational\neffort with system size. In contrast to conventional localised orbital\nformulations, where a single set of localised functions is used to span the\noccupied and unoccupied state manifold, we make use of two sets of in situ\noptimised localised orbitals, one for the occupied and one for the unoccupied\nspace. This double representation approach avoids known problems of spanning\nthe space of unoccupied Kohn-Sham states with a minimal set of localised\norbitals optimised for the occupied space, while the in situ optimisation\nprocedure allows for efficient calculations with a minimal number of functions.\nThe method is applied to a number of medium sized organic molecules and a good\nagreement with traditional TDDFT methods is observed.

The radio emission at high spatial\nresolution appears structured in a precessing jet with a precessional period of\n27-28 d. Aims: How close is the precessional period of the radio jet to the\norbital period? Any periodicity in the radio emission should be revealed by\ntiming analysis. The aim of this work is to establish the accurate value of the\nprecessional period. Methods: We analyzed 6.7 years of the Green Bank\nInterferometer database at 2.2 GHz and 8.3 GHz with the Lomb-Scargle and phase\ndispersion minimization (PDM) methods and performed simulations.

Simultaneously,\nthe X-ray flux decreased by about 3 orders of magnitude: from about\n1.4x10^{-11} to 1.2x10^{-14} erg/s/cm^2 .

Both antennas are equipped with cosmic ray shower\ndetectors: signals in the bar due to showers are continuously detected and used\nto characterize the antenna performances. The bar excitation mechanism is based\non the so called thermo-acoustic effect, studied on dedicated experiments that\nuse particle beams. This mechanism predicts that vibrations of bars are induced\nby the heat deposited in the bar from the particle.

Here we demonstrate that the scattering effects at lower\nradio frequencies are less than previously thought, and that the bursts could\nbe detectable at redshifts out to about $z=0.5$ in surveys below 1 GHz. Using a\nsource model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometric\nluminosities $\\sim 8 \\times 10^{44}$ ergs/s uniformly distributed per unit\ncomoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density as\na function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found by\nThornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate and\nredshift probed by a given survey. The non-detection of any such events in\nArecibo 1.4 GHz survey data by Deneva et al., and the Allen Telescope Array\nsurvey by Simeon et al. is consistent with our model.

This code solves the 2D viscous\nNavier-Stokes equations on a high-resolution moving mesh which shears with the\nfluid flow, greatly reducing advection errors in comparison with a fixed grid.\nWe perform a series of simulations for binary mass ratios in the range 0.026 <\nq < 1.0, each lasting longer than a viscous time so that we reach a\nquasi-steady accretion state. In each case, we find that gas is efficiently\nstripped from the inner edge of the circumbinary disk and enters the cavity\nalong accretion streams, which feed persistent \"mini-disks\" surrounding each\nblack hole. We find that for q > 0.1, the binary excites eccentricity in the\ninner region of the circumbinary disk, creating an overdense lump which gives\nrise to enhanced periodicity in the accretion rate. The dependence of the\nperiodicity on mass ratio may provide a method for observationally inferring\nmass ratios from measurements of the accretion rate. We also find that for all\nmass ratios studied, the magnitude of the accretion onto the secondary is\nsufficient to drive the binary toward larger mass ratio.

For typical parameters, the luminosity of the BEC is\ndetermined to be 4 10^{25} erg/s, whereas the maximum-possible\nbeam-size-limited power of the stream is L_max ~ 2 10^{29} erg/s.

This combination of colours\n(UVJ) provides an efficient means of separating quiescent from star-forming,\nincluding dust reddened, galaxies. Morphological information emphasises\ndifferences between AGN split by their UVJ colours. AGN in quiescent galaxies\nare dominated by spheroids, while star-forming hosts are split between bulges\nand disks. The UVJ diagram of AGN hosts is then used to set limits on the\naccretion density associated with evolved and star-forming systems. Most of the\nblack hole growth since z~1 is associated with star-forming hosts.\nNevertheless, ~15-20% of the X-ray luminosity density since z~1, is taking\nplace in the quiescent region of the UVJ diagram. For the z~0.40 subsample,\nthere is tentative evidence (2sigma significance), that AGN split by their UVJ\ncolours differ in Eddington ratio. AGN in star-forming hosts dominate at high\nEddington ratios, while AGN in quiescent hosts become increasingly important as\na fraction of the total population toward low Eddington ratios. At higher\nredshift, z~0.8, such differences are significant at the 2sigma level only at\nEddington ratios >1e-3. These findings are consistent with scenarios in which\ndiverse accretion modes are responsible for the build-up of SMBHs at the\ncentres of galaxies. We compare our results with the GALFORM semi-analytic\nmodel, which postulates two black hole fuelling modes, the first linked to\nstar-formation and the second occuring in passive galaxies. GALFORM predicts a\nlarger fraction of black hole growth in quiescent galaxies at z<1, compared to\nthe data. Relaxing the strong assumption of the model that passive AGN hosts\nhave zero star-formation rate could reconcile this disagreement. \n\n"}

This is of special interest in\nthe light of the tension between the Planck results of the primary temperature\nanisotropies of the CMB and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich plus X-ray cluster counts\nanalyses. We quantify in detail the systematics and uncertainties of the\ncross-calibration of the effective area between five X-ray instruments,\nEPIC-MOS1/MOS2/PN onboard XMM-Newton and ACIS-I/S onboard Chandra, and the\ninfluence on temperature measurements. Furthermore, we assess the impact of the\ncross calibration uncertainties on cosmology. Using the HIFLUGCS sample,\nconsisting of the 64 X-ray brightest galaxy clusters, we constrain the ICM\ntemperatures through spectral fitting in the same, mostly isothermal, regions\nand compare them. Our work is an extension to a previous one using X-ray\nclusters by the IACHEC. Performing spectral fitting in the full energy band we\nfind that best-fit temperatures determined with XMM-Newton/EPIC are\nsignificantly lower than Chandra/ACIS temperatures. We demonstrate that effects\nlike multitemperature structure and different relative sensitivities of the\ninstruments at certain energy bands cannot explain the observed differences. We\nconclude that using XMM-Newton/EPIC, instead of Chandra/ACIS to derive full\nenergy band temperature profiles for cluster mass determination results in an\n8% shift towards lower OmegaM values and <1% shift towards higher sigma8 values\nin a cosmological analysis of a complete sample of galaxy clusters.

Signatures of motions\ntransverse to the jet axis and in opposite directions have recently been\nmeasured in M87 (Meyer et al. 2013). One possible interpretation of this motion\nis the one of counter rotating knots.

We show\nthat both the magnetic field and a non-negligible enthalpy are necessary at the\norigin of counter-rotating outflows, and that the effect is associated with a\ntransfer of energy flux from the matter to the electromagnetic field. This can\nbe realized in three cases : if a decreasing enthalpy causes an increase of the\nPoynting flux, if the flow decelerates, or, if strong gradients of the magnetic\nfield are present.

As cosmic\nrays are mostly charged nuclei, their trajectories are deflected by the action\nof galactic magnetic field they propagate through before reaching the Earth\natmosphere, so that their detection carries directional information only up to\ndistances as large as their gyro-radius. If cosmic rays below\n$10^{15}{\\rm\\,eV}$ are considered and the local galactic magnetic field\n($\\sim3{\\rm\\,\\mu G}$) is accounted for, gyro-radii are so short that isotropy\nis expected.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation\nmapping and could also be extended to multi-band data. Because the effect\ndescribed above produces a variability pattern in difference light curves\nbetween pairs of lensed images which is correlated with the time-lagged\ncontinuum variability, it can potentially produce systematic errors in\nmeasurement of time delays between pairs of lensed images.

The\nubiquity of low-mass X-ray binaries, thought to be the progenitors of\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs), explain the large number of observed GC radio\npulsars and X-ray counterparts. The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) recently\nunveiled the first gamma-ray GC pulsar (PSR J1823-3021A). The first\nobservations of GCs in the GeV and TeV bands furthermore created much\nexcitement, and in view of the above, it seems natural to explain these\nhigh-energy lanterns by investigating an MSP origin. An MSP population is\nexpected to radiate several pulsed spectral components in the radio through\ngamma-ray wavebands, in addition to being sources of relativistic particles.\nThe latter may interact with background photons in the clusters producing TeV\nexcesses, while they may also radiate synchrotron photons as they traverse the\ncluster magnetic field. We present multiwavelength modelling results for Terzan\n5. We also briefly discuss some alternative interpretations for the observed GC\ngamma-ray signals. \n\n"}

The density of dark matter states\n(the neutral Higgs states of the inert doublet) is determined by the interplay\nof the freeze-out mechanism and the additional production of dark matter states\nfrom the decays of topological defects, in this case cosmic strings.

Assuming the disk is exactly in the\nbinary plane and transfers energy and angular momentum to the binary via direct\ngas accretion, we calculate the time evolution of the binary's semi-major axis\n$a$ and eccentricity $e$. Because the gas is predominantly transferred when the\nbinary is at apocenter, we find the eccentricity grows rapidly while\nmaintaining constant $a(1+e)$. After accreting only a fraction of the\nsecondary's mass, the eccentricity grows to nearly unity; from then on,\ngravitational wave emission dominates the evolution, preserving constant\n$a(1-e)$. The high-eccentricity waveforms redistribute the peak gravitational\nwave power from the nHz to $\\mu$Hz bands, substantially affecting the signal\nthat might be detected with pulsar timing arrays. We also estimate the torque\ncoupling binaries of arbitrary eccentricity with obliquely aligned circumbinary\ndisks. If the outer edge of the disk is not an extremely large multiple of the\nbinary separation, retrograde accretion can drive the binary into the\ngravitational wave-dominated state before these torques align the binary with\nthe angular momentum of the mass supply. \n\n"}

Abstract: Magnetars are proposed to be peculiar neutron stars which could power their\nX-ray radiation by super-strong magnetic fields as high as $\\gtrsim 10^{14}$ G.\nHowever, no direct evidence for such strong fields is obtained till now, and\nthe recent discovery of low magnetic field magnetars even indicates that some\nmore efficient radiation mechanism than magnetic dipole radiation should be\nincluded. In this paper, quantum vacuum friction (QVF) is suggested to be a\ndirect consequence of super-strong {\\em surface} fields, therefore the magnetar\nmodel could then be tested further through the QVF braking. Pulsars' high\nsurface magnetic field interacting with the quantum vacuum result in a\nsignificantly high spindown rate ($\\dot{P}$). It is found that QVF dominates\nthe energy loss of pulsars when pulsar's rotation period and its first\nderivative satisfy the relationship $P^3\\cdot\n\\dot{P}>0.63\\times10^{-16}\\xi^{-4}$s$^2$, where $\\xi$ is the ratio of the\nsurface magnetic field over diploe magnetic field.

The current experiments combine two different techniques, an array\nof surface detectors and fluorescence telescopes. The latter allow an almost\ncalorimetric measurement of the primary energy. Thus, hadron-initiated showers\ndetected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator\nfrom the surface array (usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance\nfrom the shower core S(r0)) with the primary energy. On the other hand, this\ncalibration is not feasible when searching for photon primaries since no high\nenergy photon has been unambiguously detected so far. Therefore, pure Monte\nCarlo parametrizations are used instead.\n  In this work, we present a new method to determine the primary energy of\nhadron-induced showers in a hybrid experiment based on a technique previously\ndeveloped for photon primaries. It consists on a set of calibration curves that\nrelate the surface energy estimator, S(r0), and the depth of maximum\ndevelopment of the shower, Xmax, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes.\nThen, the primary energy can be determined from pure surface information since\nS(r0) and the zenith angle of the incoming shower are only needed. Considering\na mixed sample of ultra-high energy proton and iron primaries and taking into\naccount the reconstruction uncertainties and shower to shower fluctuations, we\ndemonstrate that the primary energy may be determined with a systematic\nuncertainty below 1% and resolution around 16% in the energy range from\n10^{18.5} to 10^{19.6} eV.

Methods: The clear\nperiodicity of the system LSI+61303 allowed observations to be scheduled\ncovering the large radio outburst in March-April 2012.

In this article, we construct quasi-equilibrium\nconfigurations for different spins, eccentricities, mass ratios, compactnesses,\nand equations of state. For this purpose we employ the SGRID code, which allows\nus to construct such data in previously inaccessible regions of the parameter\nspace.

As a proof of principle, we explore the\ndynamical evolution of three new configurations. First, we simulate a $q=2.06$\nmass ratio which is the highest mass ratio for a binary neutron star evolved in\nnumerical relativity to date.

We refine previous models of this process by modelling the star's magnetic\nfield self-consistently as a 'twisted torus' configuration in non-barotropic\nequilibrium (which allows us to explore a greater range of equilibrium\nconfigurations). It is shown that, if the star's magnetic field is purely\ndipolar, the change in the toroidal field strength required to produce an\nanti-glitch of the observed size can be ~ 10 times larger than previously\ncalculated. If the star has a quadrupolar magnetic field component, then an\nanti-glitch of similar magnitude can be produced via a decay of the quadrupole\ncomponent, in addition to a decay of the toroidal component.

The broad component has a velocity\nwidth of ~4500km/s and has a ~300km/s blue-ward shift relative to the narrow\ncomponent. We interpret this broad H$\\alpha$ emission with luminosity of\n$\\sim$2$\\times10^{41}$\\,erg\\,s$^{-1}$ as resulting from the interaction between\nthe supernova ejecta and a discrete H-rich shell, located at a distance of\n$\\sim4\\times10^{16}$\\,cm from the explosion site. This ejecta-CSM interaction\ncauses the rest-frame r-band LC to brighten at late times. The fact that the\nlate-time spectra are not completely absorbed by the shock ionized CSM shell\nimplies that its Thomson scattering optical depth is likely <1, thus setting\nupper limits on the CSM mass <30$M_\\odot$ and the volume number density\n<4x$10^8cm^{-3}$. Of the existing models, a Pulsational Pair Instability\nSupernova model can naturally explain the observed 30$M_\\odot$ H-shell, ejected\nfrom a progenitor star with an initial mass of (95-150)$M_\\odot$ about 40 years\nago.

The available data consists of the time averaged spin-down rate,\nwhich displays a distinctive double-peaked modulation, and measurements of the\nbeam-width.

The first concept is phenomenological and stipulates that the\nmagnetosphere undergoes periodic switching between two meta-stable states as\nfirst suggested by Lyne et al. The second concept, precession, was first\nconsidered as a candidate for the modulation of B1828-11 by Stairs et al.. We\nquantitatively compare models built from these concepts using a Bayesian\nodds-ratio.

A total of 2887 AGN is used to build the LF in\nthe luminosity interval 10^42-10^46 erg/s, and in the redshift interval\n0.001-4. A new method to correct for absorption by considering the probability\ndistribution for the column density conditioned on the hardness ratio is\npresented. The binned luminosity function and its evolution is determined with\na variant of the Page-Carrera method, improved to include corrections for\nabsorption and to account for the full probability distribution of photometric\nredshifts. Parametric models, namely a double power-law with LADE or LDDE\nevolution, are explored using Bayesian inference. We introduce the\nWatanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC) to compare the models and estimate\ntheir predictive power. Our data are best described by the LADE model, as\nhinted by the WAIC indicator. We also explore the 15-parameter extended LDDE\nmodel recently proposed by Ueda et al., and find that this extension is not\nsupported by our data. The strength of our method is that it provides:\nun-absorbed non-parametric estimates; credible intervals for luminosity\nfunction parameters; model choice according to which one has more predictive\npower for future data. \n\n"}

This theory is a multicomponent generalization\nof the $S^{(2)}$ theory of binary alloys developed by G. M. Stocks, J. B.\nStaunton, D. D. Johnson and others. It is highly relevant to the chemical phase\nstability of high-entropy alloys as it predicts the kind and size of\nfinite-temperature chemical fluctuations. In doing so it includes effects of\nrearranging charge and other electronics due to changing site occupancies. When\nchemical fluctuations grow without bound an absolute instability occurs and a\nsecond-order order-disorder phase transition may be inferred. The S$^{(2)}$\ntheory is predicated on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem; thus we derive the\nlinear response of the CPA medium to perturbations in site-dependent chemical\npotentials in great detail.

Here, we extend the recent work of Dessart et al.\non super-luminous SNe IIn and perform axially-symmetric (i.e., 2D) multi-group\nradiation hydrodynamics simulations to explore the impact of an imposed large\nscale density asymmetry. When the CSM is asymmetric, the latitudinal variation\nof the radial optical depth $\\tau$ introduces a strong flux redistribution from\nthe higher-density CSM regions, where the shock luminosity is larger, towards\nthe lower-density CSM regions where photons escape more freely --- this\nredistribution ceases when $\\tau<$1.

When the CSM is symmetric and the ejecta asymmetric, the flux\nredistribution within the CSM now tends to damp the latitudinal variation of\nthe luminosity at the shock.

We calculate the amplitude of the tidally excited gravity\n(buoyancy) waves in the WD as a function of the pericenter distance and\neccentricity for realistic WD models, under the assumption that these outgoing\ngravity waves are efficiently dissipated in outer layers of the WD by\nnon-linear effects or radiative damping.

Recently, several empirical luminosity correlations have been\nstatistically proposed from GRB observations. However, to treat GRB as the\ndistance indicator, there are two key issues: the redshift evolution of\nluminosity correlations and their calibrations. In this paper, we choose the\nAmati relation, the correlation between the peak spectra energy and the\nequivalent isotropic energy of GRBs ($E_{\\rm p}-E_{\\rm iso}$), as an example,\nand find that the current GRB dataset implies that there could be a evolution\nof the luminosity correlation with respect to the redshift. Therefore, we\npropose an extended Amati relation with two extra redshift-dependent terms to\ncorrect the redshift evolution of GRB relation. Secondly, we carefully check\nthe reliability of the calibration method using the low-redshift GRB data.\nImportantly, we find that the low-redshift calibration method does not take\nwhole correlations between $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and coefficients into account.\nNeglecting these correlation information can break the degeneracies and obtain\nthe biased constraint on $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ which is very sensitive to values of\nparameters for the calibration.

Alloying MoTe$_2$ with WTe$_2$ reduces the energy\nbarrier between these two phases, while also allowing access to the T$_d$ Weyl\nsemimetal phase.

The wind-to-ISM transition is\ncalculated to be at $\\sim 8\\times 10^3$ s when the jet has decelerated, at a\ndistance of $\\sim$ 1 pc from the progenitor. Using the standard external shock\nmodel, the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission from reverse shock\nis required to model the GeV $\\gamma$-ray and optical observations in the early\nafterglow, and synchrotron radiation from the adiabatic forward shock to\ndescribe the X-ray and optical observations in the late afterglow. The derived\nvalues of the magnetization parameter, the slope of the fast decay of the\noptical flash and the inferred magnetic fields suggest that Poynting\nflux-dominated jet models with arbitrary magnetization could account for the\nspectral properties exhibited by GRB 160625B. \n\n"}

Their realization at room temperature (RT) in magnetic\nmultilayers has generated considerable interest, fueled by technological\nprospects and the access granted to fundamental questions.

The first glitch recorded in this pulsar\noccurred in 1969 Sep, at an epoch when timing observations were still in their\ninfancy, the regularity of the observations was relatively poor, and errors on\nthe observations were relatively high. Lyne et al. (1993) analyzed most of the\navailable data using modern techniques, and showed that this was a typical\nglitch of the Crab pulsar, with typical glitch parameters. This work analyses\nall available data, and shows that the 1969 event in the Crab pulsar is\namenable to radically different interpretations. The Crab pulsar was timed by\nfive different groups during this epoch, one at radio and the rest at optical\nfrequencies. These data are available in the public domain, and have been\nanalyzed using the TEMPO2 software. The 1969 event in the Crab pulsar can be\nbetter modeled as a typical glitch that was interrupted by a non-glitch\nspeed-up event. This work also confirms the existence of a quasi-sinusoidal\noscillation in the timing noise of the Crab pulsar, that was reported by\nRichards et al.

For some sources, timing noise is\nattributable to a pulsar switching between two different spin-down rates\n$(\\dot{\\nu})$. Such transitions may be common but difficult to resolve using\ncurrent techniques. In this work, we use simulations of $\\dot{\\nu}$-variable\npulsars to investigate the likelihood of resolving individual $\\dot{\\nu}$\ntransitions.

The\nself-similarity of the temperature profiles and tight mass--temperature\nrelation of relaxed cool-core clusters suggest that the maximum effect of\nsedimentation take place in the most massive virialized objects in the\nUniverse.

An important aspect of this new solution\nis that the semi-annihilation effects are much more prominent in dwarf-sized\nhalos than in the more massive halos that host galaxies and clusters, even if\nthe corresponding cross sections are the same. Furthermore, the preferred\nparameter space for solving the small-scale problem suggests a thermal dark\nmatter candidate with a mass below the GeV scale, which can be probed in dark\nmatter direct and indirect detection experiments. \n\n"}

Here, the phonon transports of monolayer GeC with a perfect planar\nhexagonal honeycomb structure are investigated by solving the linearized phonon\nBoltzmann equation within the single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA).\nWithout inclusion of Born effective charges ($Z^*$) and dielectric constants\n($\\varepsilon$), the lattice thermal conductivity ($\\kappa_L$) almost decreases\nlinearly above 350 K, deviating from the usual $\\kappa_L$$\\sim$$1/T$ law. The\nunderlying mechanism is because the contribution to $\\kappa_L$ from\nhigh-frequency optical phonon modes increases with increasing temperature, and\nthe contribution exceeds one from acoustic branches at high temperature. These\ncan be understood by huge phonon band gap caused by large difference in atom\nmass between Ge and C atoms, which produces important effects on scattering\nprocess involving high-frequency optical phonon. When considering $Z^*$ and\n$\\varepsilon$, the phonon group velocities and phonon lifetimes of\nhigh-frequency optical phonon modes are obviously reduced with respect to ones\nwithout $Z^*$ and $\\varepsilon$.

II) Fast migration ($T_{\\rm mig}$ $\\sim$ $10^{1-2} \\times T_{\\rm\norb}$), in which the redistribution of angular momentum is efficient and no low\ndensity cavity is formed in the circumbinary disc.

In both cases, we\nconsider the source emissivity evolution to be a simple power-law in redshift.\nWe test the credibility of H+He composition by varying the source properties\nover a wide range of values and compare the results to that obtained for\nH+He+N+Si composition, using the Monte Carlo simulation tool CRPropa 3. The\nsecondary electrons and photons are propagated using the cosmic ray transport\ncode DINT. We place limits on the source spectral index, source evolution index\nand cutoff rigidity of the source population in each case by fitting the UHECR\nspectrum. Cosmogenic neutrino fluxes can further constrain the abundance\nfraction and maximum source redshift in case of light nuclei injection model. \n\n"}

Tipler showed that this CBR\nproperty would also mean the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) would\npropagate a factor of ten further than standard theory predicts, since most of\nthe cross section for pion production when a UHECR hits a CBR photon is due to\na quark spin flip, and such a flip cannot occur if a CBR particle cannot couple\nto right-handed quarks.

With our machine learning model, we were able to shortlist 21\nGalactic GCs that are most likely to contain a BH subsystem. We show that the\nclusters shortlisted by the machine learning classifier include those in which\nBH candidates have been observed (M22, M10 and NGC 3201) and that our results\nline up well with independent simulations and previous studies that manually\ncompared simulated GC models with observed properties of Galactic GCs. These\nresults can be useful for observers searching for elusive stellar mass BH\ncandidates in GCs and further our understanding of the role BHs play in GC\nevolution. In addition, we have released an online tool that allows one to get\npredictions from our model after they input observable properties. \n\n"}

These ventures, performed by automated\nab-initio frameworks, have rapidly expanded the volume of\nprogrammatically-accessible data, cultivating opportunities for data-driven\napproaches.

A fraction >20% of SGRBs are followed\nby temporally-extended (>~ minute-long), variable X-ray emission, attributed to\nongoing activity of the central engine. One source of late-time engine activity\nis fall-back accretion of bound tidal ejecta; however, observed extended\nemission light curves do not track the naively-anticipated, uninterrupted\n~t^{-5/3} power-law decay, instead showing a lull or gap in emission typically\nlasting tens of seconds after the burst.

Depending on the mass of the remnant black hole, r-process\nheating can imprint a variety of fall-back curve shapes, ranging from temporal\nlulls of up to tens of seconds to complete late-time cut-off in the fall-back\nrate. This behavior is robust to realistic variations in the nuclear heating\nexperienced by different parts of the ejecta.

At low\ntemperatures, T = 1.2 K, our diffuse neutron scattering study with polarization\nanalysis reveals characteristic spin correlations close to a predicted\ntwo-dimensional coplanar ground state with staggered chirality. The absence of\nthree dimensional long-range AF order proves negligible coupling between the\nkagome layers. The scattering intensities are consistent with high spin S=3/2\nstates of Co2+ in the kagome layers and low spin S=0 states for Co3+ ions at\ninterlayer sites.

Recently, dynamical heterogeneities have\nbeen directly observed experimentally. However a clear physical picture for the\norigin of these heterogeneities is still lacking. Here we investigate a\npossible physical mechanism for the origin of dynamical heterogeneities in the\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of structural glasses. We test the predictions\nregarding universal scaling of fluctuations derived from this mechanism against\nsimulation results in a simple binary Lennard-Jones glass model, and find that\nto a first approximation they are satisfied. We also propose to apply the same\nkind of analysis to experimental data from confocal microscopy in colloidal\nglasses. \n\n"}

Such asymmetric electronic states for the different spins have been\npredicted for some ferromagnetic metals - for example, the Heusler compounds-\nand were first observed in a manganese perovskite. In view of the potential for\nuse of this property in realizing spin-based electronics, substantial efforts\nhave been made to search for half-metallic materials. However, organic\nmaterials have hardly been investigated in this context even though\ncarbon-based nanostructures hold significant promise for future electronic\ndevice. Here we predict half-metallicity in nanometre-scale graphene ribbons by\nusing first-principles calculations. We show that this phenomenon is realizable\nif in-plane homogeneous electric fields are applied across the zigzag-shaped\nedges of the graphene nanoribbons, and that their magnetic property can be\ncontrolled by the external electric fields. The results are not only of\nscientific interests in the interplay between electric fields and electronic\nspin degree of freedom in solids but may also open a new path to explore\nspintronics at nanometre scale, based on graphene. \n\n"}

Lett. 90, 136401 (2003)] is used to carry out a\nsystematic study of the dissociation and ionization energies of second-row\ngroup 3A-7A atoms and dimers, Al, Si, P, S, Cl. In addition, the P_2 dimer is\ncompared to the third-row As_2 dimer, which is also triply-bonded. This method\nprojects the many-body ground state by means of importance-sampled random walks\nin the space of Slater determinants. The Monte Carlo phase problem, due to the\nelectron-electron Coulomb interaction, is controlled via the phaseless\napproximation, with a trial wave function |Psi_T>. As in previous calculations,\na mean-field single Slater determinant is used as |Psi_T>. The method is\nformulated in the Hilbert space defined by any chosen one-particle basis. The\npresent calculations use a planewave basis under periodic boundary conditions\nwith norm-conserving pseudopotentials. Computational details of the planewave\nAF QMC method are presented. The isolated systems chosen here allow a\nsystematic study of the various algorithmic issues. We show the accuracy of the\nplanewave method and discuss its convergence with respect to parameters such as\nthe supercell size and planewave cutoff.

Particular attention is given to the role that\nTeV-scale gravity could play in addressing the origin of the highest energy\ncosmic rays.
