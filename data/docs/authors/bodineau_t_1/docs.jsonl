The two quenching schemes\nare called transverse and anisotropic quenching respectively. Our emphasis in\nthis paper is on the anisotropic quenching scheme and we compare the results\nwith those of the other scheme. In the process of anisotropic quenching, the\nsystem crosses all the quantum critical lines of the phase diagram where the\nrelaxation time diverges. The evolution is non-adiabatic in the time interval\nwhen the parameters are close to their critical values, and is adiabatic\notherwise. The density of defects produced due to non-adiabatic transitions is\ncalculated by mapping the many-particle system to an equivalent Landau-Zener\nproblem and is generally found to vary as $1/\\sqrt{\\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is the\ncharacteristic time scale of quenching, a scenario that supports the\nKibble-Zurek mechanism.

Modeling of the chemical reaction\nreveals a coupling between the angular distribution of reactivity on the\nswimmer and the concentration field. This effect, which we term \"reaction\ninduced concentration distortion\", strongly influences the particle speed.\nBuilding on these insights, we employ irreversible, linear thermodynamics to\nformulate an energy balance. This approach highlights the importance of solute\nconvection for a consistent treatment of the energetics. The efficiency of\nswimming is calculated numerically and approximated analytically. Finally, we\ndefine an efficiency of transport for swimmers which are moving in random\ndirections. It is shown that this efficiency scales as the inverse of the\nmacroscopic distance over which transport is to occur. \n\n"}

The\nexternal field, as well as the temperature, was treated as a dynamical variable\nupdated during the simulations. Thus, this simulation can be referred to as\n\"Simulated Tempering and Magnetizing (STM).\" We also performed the \"Simulated\nMagnetizing\" (SM) simulations, in which the external field was considered as a\ndynamical variable and temperature was not. As has been discussed by previous\nstudies, the ST method is not always compatible with first-order phase\ntransitions. This is also true in the magnetizing process. Flipping of the\nentire magnetization did not occur in the SM simulations under $T_\\mathrm{c}$\nin large lattice-size simulations.

A particularly simple and\nelegant model of wave-pinning has been proposed by Edelstein-Keshet and\ncoworkers (Biop. J., 2008).

The aim and purpose of this\nstudy is fourfold: (i) To achieve consensus in general on definitions and\nprinciples when trying to establish an invariant theory for modelling\nconstitutive structures and dynamic processes in mechanics, where special focus\nis put on the principle of Material Frame-Indifference (MFI). (ii) To show that\nin constitutive modelling MFI can only be regarded as an approximation that\nneeds to be reduced to a weaker statement when trying to advance it to an axiom\nof nature. (iii) To convince that in dynamical modelling, as in turbulence, MFI\nmay not be utilized as a modelling guideline, not even in an approximative\nsense. Instead, its reduced form has to be supplemented by a second,\nindependent axiom that includes the microscopic (fluctuating) description of\nthe dynamical processes.

We analyze the\nMpemba effect in Markovian dynamics and discover that a stronger version of the\neffect often exists for a carefully chosen set of initial temperatures. In this\n\\emph{strong Mpemba effect}, the relaxation time jumps to a smaller value\nleading to exponentially faster equilibration dynamics. The number of such\nspecial initial temperatures defines the \\emph{Mpemba index}, whose parity is a\ntopological property of the system. To demonstrate these concepts, we first\nanalyze the different types of Mpemba relaxations in the mean field\nanti-ferromagnet Ising model, which demonstrates a surprisingly rich Mpemba\nphase diagram. Moreover, we show that the strong effect survives the\nthermodynamic limit and that it is tightly connected with thermal overshoot --\nin the relaxation process, the temperature of the relaxing system can decay\nnon-monotonically as a function of time.

This fragility is due to the presence of at least one marginal\nmode in the Hessian of the free energy, that makes the states highly\nsusceptible under external perturbations. The cavity method is a technique that\nrecursively describes the property of a system with N+1 spins in terms of those\nof a system with N spins. To do so, the cavity method assumes a certain degree\nof stability when adding a new spin to the system, i.e. it assumes that for a\ngeneric choice of the parameters there is an one-to-one correspondence between\nthe metastable states of the system with N spins and the metastable states of\nthe system with N+1 spins. In systems where the supersymmetry is broken such a\ncorrespondence does not exist, and an alternative formulation of the cavity\nmethod must be devised. We introduce a generalized cavity approach that takes\ncare of this problem and we apply it to the computation of the probability\ndistribution of the local magnetizations in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model.\nOur findings agree with the correct supersymmetry-breaking result. \n\n"}

In this paper, we show that this\ndistribution also appears in a rather well studied physical system, namely the\nfluctuating interfaces.

Here we generalize the topology from\nall-to-all to a regular one of a two-dimensional triangular lattice. The\ndriving force in this dynamics is the reduction of frustrated triads in order\nto reach a balanced state. The dynamics is parameterized by a so-called\npropensity parameter $p$ that determines the tendency of negative links to\nbecome positive. As a function of $p$ we find a phase transition between\ndifferent kind of absorbing states. The phases differ by the existence of an\ninfinitely connected (percolated) cluster of negative links that forms whenever\n$p\\leq p_c$. Moreover, for $p\\leq p_c$, the time to reach the absorbing state\ngrows powerlike with the system size $L$, while it increases logarithmically\nwith $L$ for $p > p_c$.

Both D and c could\nbe independent of knot type. As a consequence, the knot is weakly localized,\ni.e. <l> ~ N^t, with t=2-c ~ 0.75.

{"id": "q-bio/0610057", "contents": "Title: Second look at the spread of epidemics on networks Abstract: In an important paper, M.E.J. Newman claimed that a general network-based\nstochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) epidemic model is isomorphic to\na bond percolation model, where the bonds are the edges of the contact network\nand the bond occupation probability is equal to the marginal probability of\ntransmission from an infected node to a susceptible neighbor. In this paper, we\nshow that this isomorphism is incorrect and define a semi-directed random\nnetwork we call the epidemic percolation network that is exactly isomorphic to\nthe SIR epidemic model in any finite population. In the limit of a large\npopulation, (i) the distribution of (self-limited) outbreak sizes is identical\nto the size distribution of (small) out-components, (ii) the epidemic threshold\ncorresponds to the phase transition where a giant strongly-connected component\nappears, (iii) the probability of a large epidemic is equal to the probability\nthat an initial infection occurs in the giant in-component, and (iv) the\nrelative final size of an epidemic is equal to the proportion of the network\ncontained in the giant out-component. For the SIR model considered by Newman,\nwe show that the epidemic percolation network predicts the same mean outbreak\nsize below the epidemic threshold, the same epidemic threshold, and the same\nfinal size of an epidemic as the bond percolation model. However, the bond\npercolation model fails to predict the correct outbreak size distribution and\nprobability of an epidemic when there is a nondegenerate infectious period\ndistribution. We confirm our findings by comparing predictions from percolation\nnetworks and bond percolation models to the results of simulations. In an\nappendix, we show that an isomorphism to an epidemic percolation network can be\ndefined for any time-homogeneous stochastic SIR model. \n\n"}

The epidemic\npercolation networks for these models are purely directed because undirected\nedges disappear in the limit of a large population.
