As usual, it is assumed that the system maximizes the entropy\nfunctional $S$, subjected to the standard conditions; i.e., constant energy and\nnormalization of the probability distribution. However, an extra conserved\nconstraint function $F$ is also assumed to exist, which forces the system to\nremain in the metastable configuration. Further, after assuming additivity for\ntwo quasi-independent subsystems, and that the new constraint commutes with\ndensity matrix $\\rho$, it is argued that F should be an homogeneous function of\nthe density matrix, at least for systems in which the spectrum is sufficiently\ndense to be considered as continuous. The explicit form of $F$ turns to be\n$F(p_{i})=p_{i}^{q}$, where $p_i$ are the eigenvalues of the density matrix and\n$q$ is a real number to be determined.

Hence, an analog should exist for systems with broken\ncontinuous non-Abelian symmetries. To exhibit the generality of the phenomenon\nand make predictions from a realistic model, we study tunneling between\nantiferromagnets and also between antiferromagnetic d-wave superconductors.\nPerforming a calculation analogous to that of Ambegaokar and Baratoff for the\nJosephson junction, we find an equilibrium current of the staggered\nmagnetization through the junction that, in antiferromagnets, is proportional\nto s_L X s_R where s_L and s_R are the Neel vectors on either sides of the\njunction.

The effective dielectric function is obtained from\nthe solution of the Poisson equation of three-layer dielectric medium with the\ngraphene sheets located at the interfaces, separating the different materials.\nDue to the momentum dispersion of the effective dielectric function, the intra-\nand inter-layer bare Coulomb interactions in the graphene double layer system\nacquires an additional momentum dependence--an effect that is of the order of\nthe inter-layer interaction itself. We show that the energies of the in-phase\nand out-of-phase plasmon modes are determined largely by different values of\nthe spatially dependent effective dielectric function. The effect of the\ndielectric inhomogeneity increases with temperature and even at high\ntemperatures the energy shift induced by the dielectric inhomogeneity and\ntemperature itself remains larger than the broadening of the plasmon energy\ndispersions due to the Landau damping. The obtained new features of the plasmon\ndispersions can be observed in frictional drag measurements and in inelastic\nlight scattering and electron energy-loss spectroscopies. \n\n"}

Here we review our recent\ntheoretical studies using density functional calculations on two types of\ndefects in carbon nanostructures: Substitutional doping with transition metals,\nand sp$^3$-type defects created by covalent functionalization with organic and\ninorganic molecules. We focus on such defects because they can be used to\ncreate and control magnetism in graphene-based materials. Our main results are\nsummarized as follows: i)Substitutional metal impurities are fully understood\nusing a model based on the hybridization between the $d$ states of the metal\natom and the defect levels associated with an unreconstructed D$_{3h}$ carbon\nvacancy. We identify three different regimes, associated with the occupation of\ndistinct hybridization levels, which determine the magnetic properties obtained\nwith this type of doping; ii) A spin moment of 1.0 $\\mu_B$ is always induced by\nchemical functionalization when a molecule chemisorbs on a graphene layer via a\nsingle C-C (or other weakly polar) covalent bond. The magnetic coupling between\nadsorbates shows a key dependence on the sublattice adsorption site. This\neffect is similar to that of H adsorption, however, with universal character;\niii) The spin moment of substitutional metal impurities can be controlled using\nstrain.

Taking into account resistive scattering by Coulomb disorder\narising from quenched random charged impurities in the environment, we show\nthat the 2D conductivity \\sigma(n) varies as \\sigma ~ n^{\\beta(n)} as a\nfunction of the 2D carrier density n where the exponent \\beta(n) is a smooth,\nbut non-monotonic, function of density with possible nontrivial extrema. In\nparticular, the density scaling exponent \\beta(n) depends qualitatively on\nwhether the Coulomb disorder arises primarily from remote or background charged\nimpurities or short-range disorder, and can, in principle, be used to\ncharacterize the nature of the dominant background disorder. A specific\nimportant prediction of the theory is that for resistive scattering by remote\ncharged impurities, the exponent \\beta can reach a value as large as 2.7 for\nk_F d ~ 1, where k_F ~\\sqrt{n} is the 2D Fermi wave vector and d is the\nseparation of the remote impurities from the 2D layer.

Due to the spin-pumping effect driven by the\nmagnetization precession in the ferrimagnetic insulator YIG film a\nspin-polarized electron current is injected into the Pt layer.

Defects often play a central role in ionic and electronic solids, not\nonly to limit reliability, but more importantly to enable the functionalities\nthat make these materials of critical importance. Examples include solid\nelectrolytes that conduct current through the motion of charged point defects,\nand complex oxide ferroelectrics that display multifunctionality through the\nmotion of domain wall defects. Therefore, it is important to understand the\nstructure of defects and their response to electrical and mechanical fields. A\ncentral hurdle, however, is that interactions in ionic solids include both\nshort-range atomic interactions as well as long-range electrostatic\ninteractions. Existing atomistic-to-continuum multi-scale methods, such as the\nQuasicontinuum method, are applicable only when the atomic interactions are\nshort-range. In addition, empirical reductions of quantum mechanics to density\nfunctional models are unable to capture key phenomena of interest in these\nmaterials. To address this open problem, we develop a multiscale atomistic\nmethod to coarse-grain the long-range electrical interactions in ionic crystals\nwith defects. In these settings, the charge density is rapidly varying, but in\nan almost-periodic manner. The key idea is to use the polarization density\nfield as a multiscale mediator that enables efficient coarse-graining by\nexploiting the almost-periodic nature of the variation.

In this review, we discuss the basic lattice vibrations of\nmonolayer, multilayer, and bulk TMDs, including high-frequency optical phonons,\ninterlayer shear and layer breathing phonons, the Raman selection rule,\nlayer-number evolution of phonons, multiple phonon replica, and phonons at the\nedge of the Brillouin zone. The extensive capabilities of Raman spectroscopy in\ninvestigating the properties of TMDs are discussed, such as interlayer\ncoupling, spin--orbit splitting, and external perturbations. The interlayer\nvibrational modes are used in rapid and substrate-free characterization of the\nlayer number of multilayer TMDs and in probing interface coupling in TMD\nheterostructures. The success of Raman spectroscopy in investigating TMD\nnanosheets paves the way for experiments on other 2D crystals and related van\nder Waals heterostructures. \n\n"}

The recent discovery of WSM materials triggered an\nexperimental search for the exotic quantum phenomenon known as the chiral\nanomaly. Via the chiral anomaly nonorthogonal electric and magnetic fields\ninduce a chiral density imbalance that results in an unconventional negative\nlongitudinal magnetoresistance, the chiral magnetic effect. Recent theoretical\nwork suggests that this effect does not require well-defined Weyl nodes.\nExperimentally however, it remains an open question to what extent it survives\nwhen chirality is not well-defined, for example when the Fermi energy is far\naway from the Weyl points.

Several recent studies have focused on structures\nwhere such conventional $s$-wave superconductors are coupled to systems with an\nunusual configuration of electronic spin and momentum at the Fermi surface.\nUnder these conditions, the nature of the paired state can be modified and the\nsystem may even undergo a topological phase transition [2, 3].

The basic challenge addressed\nin our work is to calculate the decoherence of electrons interacting with a\nquantum-mechanical environment, while taking proper account of the Pauli\nprinciple. First, we review the usual influence functional approach valid for\ndecoherence of electrons due to classical noise, showing along the way how the\nquantitative accuracy can be improved by properly averaging over closed (rather\nthan unrestricted) random walks. We then use a heuristic approach to show how\nthe Pauli principle may be incorporated into a path-integral description of\ndecoherence in weak localization. This is accomplished by introducing an\neffective modification of the quantum noise spectrum, after which the\ncalculation proceeds in analogy to the case of classical noise. Using this\nsimple but efficient method, which is consistent with much more laborious\ndiagrammatic calculations, we demonstrate how the Pauli principle serves to\nsuppress the decohering effects of quantum fluctuations of the environment, and\nessentially confirm the classic result of Altshuler, Aronov and Khmelnitskii\nfor the energy-averaged decoherence rate, which vanishes at zero temperature.\nGoing beyond that, we employ our method to calculate explicitly the leading\nquantum corrections to the classical decoherence rates, and to provide a\ndetailed analysis of the energy-dependence of the decoherence rate.

Here, based upon that model, a two-species-percolation\nscaling theory is introduced and compared to the experimental data. The two\nspecies in this model are, on one hand, the ``metallic'' point contacts, whose\ncritical energy lies below the Fermi energy, and on the other hand, the\ninsulating quantum point contacts. It is shown that many features of the\nexperiments, such as the exponential dependence of the resistance on\ntemperature on the metallic side, the linear dependence of the exponent on\ndensity, the $e^2/h$ scale of the critical resistance, the quenching of the\nmetallic phase by a parallel magnetic field and the non-monotonic dependence of\nthe critical density on a perpendicular magnetic field, can be naturally\nexplained by the model.\n  Moreover, details such as the nonmonotonic dependence of the resistance on\ntemperature or the inflection point of the resistance vs. parallel magnetic are\nalso a natural consequence of the theory. The calculated parallel field\ndependence of the critical density agrees excellently with experiments, and is\nused to deduce an experimental value of the confining energy in the vertical\ndirection.
