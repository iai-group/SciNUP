Abstract: We consider the possibility that the dark matter, which is required to\nexplain the dynamics of the neutral hydrogen clouds at large distances from the\ngalactic center, could be in the form of a Bose-Einstein condensate. To study\nthe condensate we use the non-relativistic Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By\nintroducing the Madelung representation of the wave function, we formulate the\ndynamics of the system in terms of the continuity equation and of the\nhydrodynamic Euler equations. Hence dark matter can be described as a\nnon-relativistic, Newtonian Bose-Einstein gravitational condensate gas, whose\ndensity and pressure are related by a barotropic equation of state. In the case\nof a condensate with quartic non-linearity, the equation of state is polytropic\nwith index $n=1$. To test the validity of the model we fit the Newtonian\ntangential velocity equation of the model with a sample of rotation curves of\nlow surface brightness and dwarf galaxies, respectively.

Abstract: At present, there are two possible, and equally plausible, explanations for\nthe physics of quantum measurement. The first explanation, known as the\nmany-worlds interpretation, does not require any modification of quantum\nmechanics, and asserts that at the time of measurement the Universe splits into\nmany branches, one branch for every possible alternative. The various branches\ndo not interfere with each other because of decoherence, thus providing a\npicture broadly consistent with the observed Universe. The second explanation,\nwhich requires quantum mechanics to be modified from its presently known form,\nis that at the time of measurement the wave-function collapses into one of the\npossible alternatives. The two explanations are mutually exclusive, and up\nuntil now, no theoretical reasoning has been put forward to choose one\nexplanation over the other. In this article, we provide an argument which\nimplies that the collapse interpretation is favored over the many-worlds\ninterpretation.

The motivation comes\nfrom a desire to address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating\nquantum theories of space and time. In doing so we provide a new answer to\nHeidegger's timeless question ``What is a thing?''.\n  Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of physics is equivalent\nto finding a representation in a topos of a certain formal language that is\nattached to the system. Classical physics uses the topos of sets. Other\ntheories involve a different topos. For the types of theory discussed in this\npaper, a key goal is to represent any physical quantity $A$ with an arrow\n$\\breve{A}_\\phi:\\Si_\\phi\\map\\R_\\phi$ where $\\Si_\\phi$ and $\\R_\\phi$ are two\nspecial objects (the `state-object' and `quantity-value object') in the\nappropriate topos, $\\tau_\\phi$.\n  We discuss two different types of language that can be attached to a system,\n$S$. The first, $\\PL{S}$, is a propositional language; the second, $\\L{S}$, is\na higher-order, typed language. Both languages provide deductive systems with\nan intuitionistic logic.

Indefinite causal structure poses particular\nproblems for theory formulation since many of the core ideas used in the usual\napproaches to theory construction depend on having definite causal structure.\nFor example, the notion of a state across space evolving in time requires that\nwe have some definite causal structure so we can define a state on a space-like\nhypersurface. We will see that many of these problems are mitigated if we are\nable to formulate the theory in a \"formalism local\" (or F-local) fashion. A\nformulation of a physical theory is said to be F-local if, in making\npredictions for any given arbitrary space-time region, we need only refer to\nmathematical objects pertaining to that region. This is a desirable property\nboth on the grounds of efficiency and since, if we have indefinite causal\nstructure, it is not clear how to select some other space-time region on which\nour calculations may depend. The usual ways of formulating physical theories\n(the time evolving state picture, the histories approach, and the local\nequations approach) are not F-local.\n  We set up a framework for probabilistic theories with indefinite causal\nstructure. This, the causaloid framework, is F-local. We describe how Quantum\nTheory can be formulated in the causaloid framework (in an F-local fashion).\nThis provides yet another formulation of Quantum Theory.

The main reason behind such a plausibility is that the\nwell-known Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area proportionality -- the so-called\n`area law' of black hole physics -- holds for entanglement entropy as well,\nprovided the scalar field is in its ground state, or in other minimum\nuncertainty states, such as a generic coherent state or squeezed state.\nHowever, when the field is either in an excited state or in a state which is a\nsuperposition of ground and excited states, a power-law correction to the area\nlaw is shown to exist. Such a correction term falls off with increasing area,\nso that eventually the area law is recovered for large enough horizon area. On\nascertaining the location of the microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to\nthe entanglement entropy of black holes, it is found that although the degrees\nof freedom close to the horizon contribute most to the total entropy, the\ncontributions from those that are far from the horizon are more significant for\nexcited/superposed states than for the ground state. Thus, the deviations from\nthe area law for excited/superposed states may, in a way, be attributed to the\nfar-away degrees of freedom. Finally, taking the scalar field (which is traced\nover) to be massive, we explore the changes on the area law due to the mass.\nAlthough most of our computations are done in flat space-time with a\nhypothetical spherical region, considered to be the analogue of the horizon, we\nshow that our results hold as well in curved space-times representing static\nasymptotically flat spherical black holes with single horizon. \n\n"}

Its quantisation is therefore straightforward in LQG like\nrepresentations which by design lead to non anomalous, unitary, albeit\ndiscontinuous representations of the spatial diffeomorphism group. In\nparticular, the complete set of (distributional) solutions to the quantum\nconstraints, a preferred and complete algebra of Dirac observables and the\nassociated physical inner product has been constructed. On the other hand, the\ntwo copies of Witt algebras are classically isomorphic to the Dirac or\nhypersurface deformation algebra of General Relativity (although without\nstructure functions). The question we address in this paper, also raised by\nLaddha and Varadarajan in their paper, is whether we can quantise the Dirac\nalgebra in such a way that its space of distributional solutions coincides with\nthe one just described. This potentially teaches us something about LQG where a\nclassically equivalent formulation of the Dirac algebra in terms of spatial\ndiffeomorphism Lie algebras is not at our disposal.

{"id": "1301.1692", "contents": "Title: Contracted Lorentz invariance for gravity with a preferred foliation Abstract: In canonical gravity, the choice of a local time direction is not obviously\ncompatible with local Lorentz invariance. One way to address this issue is to\nview gravity as a gauge theory on observer space, rather than spacetime. In a\nLorentz covariant theory observer space is the space of unit future-directed\ntimelike vectors; picking such a vector locally breaks the symmetry to a\nsubgroup SO(D) of SO(D,1), so that on observer space the local symmetry group\nis SO(D). Observer space geometries naturally describe any gravitational theory\nthat only assumes local invariance under SO(D). Here we construct\nnonrelativistic observer spaces for gravity with a fixed foliation, applicable\nto preferred foliation theories such as Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Different\nHorava-Lifshitz observers at a point are related by a change in the shift\nvector, leaving the preferred foliation invariant. Gravity is formulated on a\nnon-relativistic frame bundle with structure group ISO(D); the shift vector\nacts as a symmetry breaking field breaking ISO(D) symmetry spontaneously to\nSO(D). A natural torsion-free connection is constructed, including the usual\nSO(D,1) connection of relativistic gravity plus terms depending on derivatives\nof the shift vector.

It is shown how, as a result of these\nhighly energetic and localized processes, the components of the metric receive\nstrong gradients within a small volume. These pockets of gravity can gravitate\nboth attractively or repulsively, since the Ricci tensor contains squared\npartial derivative terms with either positive or negative sign, so they can be\na component of either dark matter or dark energy.

Attention to the gauge generator G\nof Rosenfeld, Anderson, Bergmann, Castellani et al., a specially tuned sum of\nfirst-class constraints, facilitates seeing that a solitary first-class\nconstraint in fact generates not a gauge transformation, but a bad physical\nchange in electromagnetism (changing E) or GR. The change spoils the Lagrangian\nconstraints in terms of the physically relevant velocities rather than\nauxiliary canonical momenta. While Maudlin has defended change in GR much as G.\nE. Moore resisted skepticism, there remains a need to exhibit the technical\nflaws in the argument.\n  Insistence on Hamiltonian-Lagrangian equivalence, a theme emphasized by\nMukunda, Castellani, Sugano, Pons, Salisbury, Shepley and Sundermeyer among\nothers, holds the key. Taking objective change to be ineliminable time\ndependence, there is change in vacuum GR just in case there is no time-like\nvector field satisfying Killing's equation. Throwing away the spatial\ndependence of GR for convenience, one finds that the time evolution from\nHamilton's equations is real change just when there is no time-like Killing\nvector. Hence change is real and local even in the Hamiltonian formalism.\n  The considerations here resolve the Earman-Maudlin standoff: the Hamiltonian\nformalism is helpful, and, suitably reformed, it does not have absurd\nconsequences for change. Hence the classical problem of time is resolved, apart\nfrom the issue of observables, for which the solution is outlined. The quantum\nproblem of time, however, is not automatically resolved due to issues of\nquantum constraint imposition. \n\n"}

The mathematical tools of the\nframework are simple and we attempt to highlight all underlying assumptions.\nFour rules are imposed, asserting (1) a limit on the amount of information\navailable to O; (2) the mere existence of complementary information; (3) O's\ntotal amount of information to be preserved in-between interrogations; and, (4)\nO's `catalogue of knowledge' to change continuously in time in-between\ninterrogations and every consistent such evolution to be possible. This\napproach permits a constructive derivation of quantum theory, elucidating how\nthe ensuing independence, complementarity and compatibility structure of O's\nquestions matches that of projective measurements in quantum theory, how\nentanglement and monogamy of entanglement, non-locality and, more generally,\nhow the correlation structure of arbitrarily many qubits and rebits arises. The\nrules yield a reversible time evolution and a quadratic measure, quantifying\nO's information about S. Finally, it is shown that the four rules admit two\nsolutions for the simplest case of a single elementary system: the Bloch ball\nand disc as state spaces for a qubit and rebit, respectively, together with\ntheir symmetries as time evolution groups. The reconstruction for arbitrarily\nmany qubits is completed in a companion paper (arXiv:1511.01130) where an\nadditional rule eliminates the rebit case.

First, there could be\ndegradation of fidelity by a common field environment even when both quantum\nobjects are in inertial motion. Second, relativistic effects entering the\ndescription of the dynamics such as frame dependence, time dilation, and\nDoppler shift, already existent in inertial motion, can compete with or even\noverwhelm the effect due to uniform acceleration in a quantum field.

In this case, equations of motion and\nconservation laws are undefined or inapplicable.

In Bohmian mechanics the quantum system is not only described by the\nwave function, but also with additional variables such as particle positions or\nfields.

This is due\nto the fact that their action evaluated on a classical solution is not finite\nand its first variation does not vanish for all consistent boundary conditions.\nThese problems can be dealt with by adding a counterterm to the classical\naction, which is a solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation.\n  In this work we study the effects of polymer quantization on a mechanical\nmodel presenting the aforementioned difficulties and contrast it with the above\ncounterterm method. This type of quantization for mechanical models is\nmotivated by the loop quantization of gravity which is known to play a role in\nthe thermodynamics of black hole systems.\n  The model we consider is a nonrelativistic particle in an inverse square\npotential, and analyze two polarizations of the polymer quantization in which\neither the position or the momentum is discrete.

This led to a new notion of\nthermal equilibrium which is specific for a given observable, rather than for\nthe whole state of the system. The equilibrium picture that emerges is a\ngeneralization of statistical mechanics in which we are not interested in the\nstate of the system but only in the outcome of the measurement process. I\ninvestigated how this picture relates to one of the most promising approaches\nfor the emergence of thermal behaviour in isolated quantum systems: the\nEigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. Then, I applied the results to study some\nequilibrium properties of many-body localised systems. Despite the localization\nphenomenon, which prevents thermalization of subsystems, I was able to show\nthat we can still use the predictions of statistical mechanics to describe the\nequilibrium of some observables. Moreover, the intuition developed in the\nprocess led me to propose an experimentally accessible way to unravel the\ninteracting nature of many-body localised systems. Second, I exploited the\n\"Concentration of Measure\" phenomenon to study the macroscopic properties of\nthe basis states of Loop Quantum Gravity. These techniques were previously used\nto explain why the thermal behaviour in quantum systems is such an ubiquitous\nphenomenon, at the macroscopic scale. I focused on the local properties, their\nthermodynamic behaviour and interplay with the semiclassical limit. This was\nmotivated by the necessity to understand, from a quantum gravity perspective,\nhow and why a classical horizon exhibits thermal properties. \n\n"}

At\nfirst, we perform the decomposition of the tangent bundle into the two\nsubbundles which will be associated later with external and visible (with\nrespect to some low-dimensional observer) parts of the high-$D$ manifold.

This explains why so many different\n``analog models'' of general relativity have recently been developed based on\ncondensed matter physics; there is something more fundamental going on.

The constructions\nof [1] make heavy use of the notion of semiclassical states for QGR. In the\npresent paper, we employ the complexifier coherent states for QGR recently\nproposed by Thiemann and Winkler as semiclassical states, and thus fill the\ngeneral formulas obtained in [1] with life. We demonstrate how one can, under\nsome simplifying assumptions, explicitely compute expectation values of the\noperators relevant for the gravity-matter Hamiltonians of [1] in the\ncomplexifier coherent states. These expectation values give rise to effective\nmatter Hamiltonians on the background on which the gravitational coherent state\nis peaked and thus induce approximate notions of n-particle states and matter\npropagation on fluctuating spacetimes. We display the details for the scalar\nand the electromagnetic field. The effective theories exhibit two types of\ncorrections as compared to the the ordinary QFT on CST. The first is due to the\nquantum fluctuations of the gravitational field, the second arises from the\nfact that background independence forces both geometry and matter to propagate\non a spacetime that is the product of the real line and a (random) graph.\nFinally we obtain explicit numerical predictions for non-standard dispersion\nrelations for the scalar and the electromagnetic field.

Thus, a\nlocal covariant quantum field theory over spectral geometries assigns quantum\nfields not just to a single noncommutative geometry (or noncommutative\nspacetime), but simultaneously to ``all'' spectral geometries, while respecting\nthe covariance principle demanding that quantum field theories over isomorphic\nspectral geometries should also be isomorphic.

The quantum dynamics of AQG is governed by a\nsingle Master Constraint operator. While AQG is inspired by Loop Quantum\nGravity (LQG), it differs drastically from it because in AQG there is\nfundamentally no topology or differential structure. A natural Hilbert space\nrepresentation acquires the structure of an infinite tensor product (ITP) whose\nseparable strong equivalence class Hilbert subspaces (sectors) are left\ninvariant by the quantum dynamics. The missing information about the topology\nand differential structure of the spacetime manifold as well as about the\nbackground metric to be approximated is supplied by coherent states. Given such\ndata, the corresponding coherent state defines a sector in the ITP which can be\nidentified with a usual QFT on the given manifold and background.

In this\npaper we build a framework for probabilistic theories with non-fixed causal\nstructure. This combines the radical elements of general relativity and quantum\ntheory. The key idea in the construction is physical compression. A physical\ntheory relates quantities. Thus, if we specify a sufficiently large set of\nquantities (this is the compressed set), we can calculate all the others. We\napply three levels of physical compression. First, we apply it locally to\nquantities (actually probabilities) that might be measured in a particular\nregion of spacetime. Then we consider composite regions. We find that there is\na second level of physical compression for the composite region over and above\nthe first level physical compression for the component regions. Each\napplication of first and second level physical compression is quantified by a\nmatrix. We find that these matrices themselves are related by the physical\ntheory and can therefore be subject to compression. This is the third level of\nphysical compression. This third level of physical compression gives rise to a\nnew mathematical object which we call the causaloid.

Abstract: It has been argued that a black hole horizon can support the long range\nfields of a Nielsen-Olesen string, and that one can think of such a vortex as\nblack hole ``hair''. In this paper, we examine the properties of an Abelian\nHiggs vortex in the presence of a charged black hole as we allow the hole to\napproach extremality. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we show\nthat the magnetic field lines (as well as the scalar field) of the vortex are\ncompletely expelled from the black hole in the extreme limit. This was to be\nexpected, since extreme black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory are known to\nexhibit such a ``Meissner effect'' in general. This would seem to imply that a\nvortex does not want to be attached to an extreme black hole. We calculate the\ntotal energy of the vortex fields in the presence of an extreme black hole.\nWhen the hole is small relative to the size of the vortex, it is energetically\nfavoured for the hole to remain inside the vortex region, contrary to the\nintuition that the hole should be expelled. However, as we allow the extreme\nhorizon radius to become very large compared to the radius of the vortex, we do\nfind evidence of an instability. This proves that it is energetically\nunfavourable for a thin vortex to interact with a large extreme black hole.\nThis would seem to dispel the notion that a black hole can support `long'\nabelian Higgs hair in the extreme limit.

For example, the validity of ordering inferences which we\nnormally take for granted --- such as that a particle in one region is\nnecessarily in a larger region containing it --- depends on whether or not our\nhistory respects the criterion of ordered consistency, or merely consistency.\n  However, the known selection criteria, including consistency and medium\ndecoherence, are very weak.

Imposing (mass-dependent) periodic boundary\nconditions in time on the associated quantum mechanical plane waves which\nrepresent the Schwarzschild system in the period just before or during the\nformation of a black hole, yields an energy spectrum of the hole which realizes\nthe old Bekenstein postulate that the quanta of the horizon A_{D-2} are\nmultiples of a basic area quantum. In the present paper it is shown that the\nphase space of such a Schwarzschild black hole in D space-time dimensions is\nsymplectomorphic to a symplectic manifold\n  S={(phi in R mod 2 pi, p = A_{D-2} >0)} with the symplectic form d phi wedge\nd p.

The\ninteraction contains the horizon area operator, which is a number operator, and\nits canonical conjugate, the phase operator.

Using this interaction we have reproduced the semi-classical\nresult for the Hawking radiation power.

Subsequently, it\nhas been argued that the intergalactic plasma may interfere adversely with this\nmechanism by rendering the oscillations energy dependent. Here we show that\nthis energy dependence is extremely sensitive to the precise value of the free\nelectron density in the Universe. Decreasing the electron density by only a\nfactor of 4 is already sufficient to bring the energy dependence within the\nexperimental bounds. Models of the intergalactic medium show that for redshifts\nz<1 about 97% of the total volume of space is filled with regions of density\nsignificantly lower than the average density. From these models we estimate\nthat the average electron density in most of space is lower by at least a\nfactor of 15 compared to the estimate based on one half of all baryons being\nuniformly distributed and ionized. Therefore the energy dependence of the\nphoton-axion oscillations is consistent with experiment, and the oscillation\nmodel remains a viable alternative to the accelerating Universe for explaining\nthe supernova observations. Furthermore, the electron density does give rise to\na sufficiently large plasma frequency which cuts off the photon-axion mixing\nabove microwave frequencies, shielding the cosmic microwave photons from axion\nconversions and significantly relaxing the lower bounds on the axion mass\nimplied by the oscillation model. \n\n"}

It is argued that since all the above-mentioned approaches to\nnonrelativistic quantum mechanics give identical cookbook prescriptions for how\nto calculate things in practice, practical-minded experimentalists, who have\ntraditionally adopted the ``shut-up-and-calculate interpretation'', typically\nshow little interest in whether cozy classical concepts are in fact real in\nsome untestable metaphysical sense or merely the way we subjectively perceive a\nmathematically simpler world where the Schrodinger equation describes\neverything - and that they are therefore becoming less bothered by a profusion\nof worlds than by a profusion of words.\n  Common objections to the MWI are discussed.
