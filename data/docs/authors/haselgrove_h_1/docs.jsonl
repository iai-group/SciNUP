The model in\nits infinite-size limit exhibits shape-phase transitions between spherical,\ndeformed prolate, and deformed oblate forms of the ground state. Finite-size\nprecursors of such behavior are verified by robust variations of nuclear\nproperties (nuclear masses, excitation energies, transition probabilities for\nlow lying levels) across the chart of nuclides. Simultaneously, the model\nserves as a theoretical laboratory for studying diverse general features of\nQPTs in interacting many-body systems, which differ in many respects from\nlattice models of solid-state physics. We outline the most important fields of\nthe present interest: (a) The coexistence of first- and second-order phase\ntransitions supports studies related to the microscopic origin of the QPT\nphenomena. (b) The competing quantum phases are characterized by specific\ndynamical symmetries and novel symmetry related approaches are developed to\ndescribe also the transitional dynamical domains. (c) In some parameter\nregions, the QPT-like behavior can be ascribed also to individual excited\nstates, which is linked to the thermodynamic and classical descriptions of the\nsystem.

For example, such computation can be\nrealized by a concatenation of parameterized quantum circuits, with an\nadiabatic though inevitably discrete change of the parameter. A design\nprinciple of adiabatic passage along quasienergy is recently proposed: Cheon's\nquasienergy and eigenspace anholonomies on unitary operators is available to\nrealize anholonomic adiabatic algorithms [Tanaka and Miyamoto, Phys.

We analyze\nthis claim in the frame of general relativity and of different alternative\ntheories. We show that the difference of \"Compton phases\" between the two paths\nof the interferometer is actually zero in a large class of theories, including\ngeneral relativity, all metric theories of gravity, most non-metric theories\nand most theoretical frameworks used to interpret the violations of the\nequivalence principle. Therefore, in most plausible theoretical frameworks,\nthere is no redshift effect and atom interferometers only test the universality\nof free fall.

These are the\ntransverse-field Ising model and the XX model universality classes with both\nthe models being special cases of the transverse-field XY model.

We have studied theoretically the\ndynamics of a BEC after release from a toroidal trap potential by solving the\n3D Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. The trap and condensate characteristics\nmatched those of a recent experiment. The circulation, experimentally imparted\nto the condensate by stirring, was simulated theoretically by imprinting a\nlinear azimuthal phase on the initial condensate wave function. The theoretical\nTOF images were in good agreement with the experimental data. We find that upon\nrelease the dynamics of the ring--shaped condensate proceeds in two distinct\nphases. First, the condensate expands rapidly inward, filling in the initial\nhole until it reaches a minimum radius that depends on the initial circulation.\nIn the second phase, the density at the inner radius increases to a maximum\nafter which the hole radius begins slowly to expand. During this second phase a\nseries of concentric rings appears due to the interference of ingoing and\noutgoing matter waves from the inner radius. The results of the GP equation\npredict that the hole area is a quadratic function of the initial circulation\nwhen the condensate is released directly from the trap in which it was stirred\nand is a linear function of the circulation if the trap is relaxed before\nrelease.

The ratio of\nscalar-to-tensor fluctuations $r$ which is the canonical measurement of the\ngravitational waves, was estimated as $r=0.2_{-0.05}^{+0.07}$.

For large $n$, the synthesized channels become either\nessentially noiseless or almost perfectly noisy, but in total carry as much\ninformation as the original $n$ channels. Capacity can therefore be achieved by\ntransmitting messages over the essentially noiseless synthesized channels.\nUnfortunately, the set of inputs corresponding to reliable synthesized channels\nis poorly understood, in particular how the set depends on the underlying\nphysical channel.

Although the unitary time evolution ensuing from a pure initial\nstate maintains the system globally at zero entropy, at long time after the\nquench local properties are captured by an appropriate statistical ensemble\nwith non zero thermodynamic entropy, which can be interpreted as the\nentanglement accumulated during the dynamics. Therefore, understanding the\npost-quench entanglement evolution unveils how thermodynamics emerges in\nisolated quantum systems.

The celebrated quantum Rabi model describes the simplest\ninteraction of a two-level system with a single-mode boson field. When the\ncoupling is large enough, the bare multilevel structure of a realistic circuit\natom cannot be ignored even if the circuit is strongly anharmonic. We explored\nthis situation theoretically for flux (fluxonium) and charge (Cooper pair box)\ntype multi-level circuits tuned to their respective flux/charge degeneracy\npoints. We identified which spectral features of the quantum Rabi model survive\nand which are renormalized for large coupling. Despite significant\nrenormalization of the low-energy spectrum in the fluxonium case, the key\nquantum Rabi feature -- nearly-degenerate vacuum consisting of an atomic state\nentangled with a multi-photon field -- appears in both types of circuits when\nthe coupling is sufficiently large. Like in the quantum Rabi model, for very\nlarge couplings the entanglement spectrum is dominated by only two, nearly\nequal eigenvalues, in spite of the fact that a large number of bare atomic\nstates are actually involved in the atom-resonator ground state.

Such an apparently irreversible process is known as spin\ndiffusion and it can lead the system back to \"equilibrium\". Even so, a unitary\nquantum dynamics would ensure a precise memory of the non-equilibrium initial\ncondition. Then, if at certain time, say $t/2$, an experimental protocol\nreverses the many-body dynamics, it would drive the system back to the initial\nnon-equilibrium state at time $t$. As a matter of fact, the reversal is always\nperturbed by small experimental imperfections and/or uncontrolled internal or\nenvironmental degrees of freedom. This limits the amount of signal $M(t)$\nrecovered locally at time $t$. The degradation of $M(t)$ accounts for these\nperturbations, which can also be seen as the sources of decoherence. This idea\ndefines the Loschmidt echo (LE), which embodies the various time-reversal\nprocedures implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance. Here, we present an\ninvitation to the study of the LE following the pathway induced by the\nexperiments.

While the largest boson\nsampling experiments reported so far are with 5 photons, our classical\nalgorithm, based on Metropolised independence sampling (MIS), allowed the boson\nsampling problem to be solved for 30 photons with standard computing hardware.\nWe argue that the impact of experimental photon losses means that demonstrating\nquantum supremacy by boson sampling would require a step change in technology. \n\n"}

We also consider a situation where optimal local\nmeasurements transform multipartite states to bipartite ones which can then be\nused as single-path channels for quantum state transmission in each segment. We\nshow that in some parameter ranges, the former protocol provides strictly\nbetter fidelities than that of the latter, thereby establishing the importance\nof distributing and concentrating arbitrary quantum states via multipartite\nentangled states in long distance quantum communication, over the local\nmeasurement based protocol.

We compare the performance of walk based classical\nand quantum algorithms and show that the latter run much quicker in general.\nLet $P$ be a symmetric Markov chain with transition probabilities $P[i,j]$, $(i\n,j\\in [n])$. Some elements of the state space are marked. We are promised that\nthe set of marked elements has size either zero or at least $\\epsilon n$. The\ngoal is to find out with great certainty which of the above two cases holds.\nOur model is a black box that can answer certain yes/no questions and can\ngenerate random elements picked from certain distributions. More specifically,\nby request the black box can give us a uniformly distributed random element for\nthe cost of $\\wp_{0}$. Also, when ``inserting'' an element $i$ into the black\nbox we can obtain a random element $j$, where $j$ is distributed according to\n$P[i,j]$. The cost of the latter operation is $\\wp_{1}$. Finally, we can use\nthe black box to test if an element $i$ is marked, and this costs us $\\wp_{2}$.\nIf $\\delta$ is the eigenvalue gap of $P$, there is a simple classical algorithm\nwith cost $O(\\wp_{0} + (\\wp_{1}+\\wp_{2})/\\delta\\epsilon)$ that solves the above\npromise problem.

We begin with a geometric\nintroduction to the NMR of an ensemble of indistinguishable spins, and then\nshow how this geometric interpretation is contained within an algebra of\nmultispin product operators. This algebra is used throughout the rest of the\npaper to demonstrate that it provides a facile framework within which to study\nquantum information processing more generally. The implementation of quantum\nalgorithms by NMR depends upon the availability of special kinds of mixed\nstates, called pseudo-pure states, and we consider a number of different\nmethods for preparing these states, along with analyses of how they scale with\nthe number of spins. The quantum-mechanical nature of processes involving such\nmacroscopic pseudo-pure states also is a matter of debate, and in order to\ndiscuss this issue in concrete terms we present the results of NMR experiments\nwhich constitute a macroscopic analogue Hardy's paradox. Finally, a detailed\nproduct operator description is given of recent NMR experiments which\ndemonstrate a three-bit quantum error correcting code, using field gradients to\nimplement a precisely-known decoherence model. \n\n"}

Abstract: We present a new algorithm for reducing an arbitrary unitary matrix U into a\nsequence of elementary operations (operations such as controlled-nots and qubit\nrotations). Such a sequence of operations can be used to manipulate an array of\nquantum bits (i.e., a quantum computer). Our algorithm applies recursively a\nmathematical technique called the CS Decomposition to build a binary tree of\nmatrices whose product, in some order, equals the original matrix U. We show\nthat the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm is a special case of our\nalgorithm. We report on a C++ program called \"Qubiter\" that implements the\nideas of this paper. Qubiter(PATENT PENDING) source code is publicly available. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/9906129", "contents": "Title: Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation With Constant Error Rate Abstract: This paper proves the threshold result, which asserts that quantum\ncomputation can be made robust against errors and inaccuracies, when the error\nrate, $\\eta$, is smaller than a constant threshold, $\\eta_c$. The result holds\nfor a very general, not necessarily probabilistic noise model, for quantum\nparticles with any number of states, and is also generalized to one dimensional\nquantum computers with only nearest neighbor interactions. No measurements, or\nclassical operations, are required during the quantum computation. The\nproceeding version was very succinct, and here we fill all the missing details,\nand elaborate on many parts of the proof. In particular, we devote a section\nfor a discussion of universality issues and proofs that the sets of gates that\nwe use are universal. Another section is devoted to a rigorous proof that fault\ntolerance can be achieved in the presence of general non probabilistic noise.\nThe systematic structure of the fault tolerant procedures for polynomial codes\nis explained in length. The proof that the concatenation scheme works is\nwritten in a clearer way. The paper also contains new and significantly simpler\nproofs for most of the known results which we use. For example, we give a\nsimple proof that it suffices to correct bit and phase flips, we significantly\nsimplify Calderbank and Shor's original proof of the correctness of CSS codes.\nWe also give a simple proof of the fact that two-qubit gates are universal. The\npaper thus provides a self contained and complete proof for universal fault\ntolerant quantum computation. \n\n"}

The uncertainty relation between\nquadrature components prevents an eavesdropper from determining both with\nenough precision to determine the character being sent.
