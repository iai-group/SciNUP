We show that the DLH and Taub-NUT metrics are related by a coordinate\ntransformation, in which the DLH time coordinate plays the role of conformal\ntime for Taub-NUT. Since both models continue through the big-bang, the\ncoordinate transformation can become multivalued. In particular, in mapping\nfrom DLH to Taub-NUT, the Taub-NUT time can take only positive values. We\npresent explicit maps between the DLH and Taub-NUT models, with and without a\nscalar field.

This underscores that HI traces the gas\nreservoir for outer disk star formation and it implies that massive (at least\nlow level) star formation proceeds almost everywhere HI is observed. Whereas\nthe average FUV intensity decreases steadily with increasing radius before\nleveling off at ~1.7 r25, the decline in HI surface density is more subtle. Low\nHI columns (<2 M_solar/pc^2) contribute most of the mass in the outer disk,\nwhich is not the case within r25.

If we take\nconsideration of the inhomogeneities in small scale, there should be\nmodifications of the cosmological distances compared to a homogenous model.\nDyer and Roeder developed a second-order ordinary differential equation (D-R\nequation) that describes the angular diameter distance-redshift relation for\ninhomogeneous cosmological models.

The most popular interpretation of the MSP is that\nthe smallest dark matter halos in the universe are extremely inefficient at\nforming stars. The question from that standpoint is to identify the feedback\nsource that makes small halos dark and to identify any obvious mass scale where\nthe truncation in the efficiency of galaxy formation occurs. Among the most\nexciting developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery\nof a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide\nfield, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite count\nin less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint galaxies that are\nless luminous that some star clusters. For the first time, there are empirical\nreasons to believe that there really are missing satellite galaxies in the\nLocal Group, lurking just beyond our ability to detect them, or simply\ninhabiting a region of the sky that has yet to have been surveyed. Both\nkinematic studies and completeness-correction studies seem to point to a\ncharacteristic potential well depth for satellite subhalos that is quite close\nto the mass scale where photoionization and atomic cooling should limit galaxy\nformation. Among the more pressing problems associated with this interpretation\nis to understand the selection biases that limit our ability to detect the\nlowest mass galaxies.

These resonances occur when the ratio of polar and radial orbital\nfrequencies, which is slowly evolving under the influence of gravitational\nradiation reaction, passes through a low order rational number. At such points,\nthe adiabatic approximation to the orbital evolution breaks down, and there is\na brief but order unity correction to the inspiral rate. Corrections to the\ngravitational wave signal's phase due to resonance effects scale as the square\nroot of the inverse of mass of the small body, and thus become large in the\nextreme-mass-ratio limit, dominating over all other post-adiabatic effects. The\nresonances make orbits more sensitive to changes in initial data (though not\nquite chaotic), and are genuine non-perturbative effects that are not seen at\nany order in a standard post-Newtonian expansion. Our results apply to an\nimportant potential source of gravitational waves, the gradual inspiral of\nwhite dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes into much more massive black holes.\nIt is hoped to exploit observations of these sources to map the spacetime\ngeometry of black holes. However, such mapping will require accurate models of\nbinary dynamics, which is a computational challenge whose difficulty is\nsignificantly increased by resonance effects.

In addition, we deduce a\nvery simple fitting formula for the backreaction with error less than 1% for\nvoids up to sizes r_0 = t_0.

The fraction of TD-producing mergers where both parents are\nearly-type galaxies is <2%, suggesting that TDs are unlikely to form in such\nmergers. The bulk of TD-producing systems inhabit a field environment and have\nmass ratios greater than 1:7 (the median value is 1:2.5).

TDs have stellar masses that are less than 10% of the stellar masses of\ntheir parents and typically lie within 15 optical half-light radii of their\nparent galaxies. The TD population is typically bluer than the parents, with a\nmedian offset of ~0.3 mag in the (g-r) colour and the TD colours are not\naffected by the presence of AGN activity in their parents.

We use Nbody\nsimulations to investigate the individual contributions and convergence of this\nexpansion for dark matter. If the series is expanded as a function of powers of\nmu, cosine of the angle between the Fourier mode and line of sight, there are a\nfinite number of terms contributing at each order.

Hierarchical models favor\nminor mergers as a plausible driver of this size growth. Some of these models,\npredict a significant environmental dependence in the sense that galaxies\nresiding in more massive halos tend to be larger than galaxies in lower mass\nhalos, at fixed stellar mass and redshift. At present, observational results of\nthis environmental dependence have been contradictory. In this paper we revisit\nthis issue in the local Universe, by investigating how the sizes of massive\nETGs depend on large-scale environment using an updated and accurate sample of\nETGs in different environments - field, group, clusters - from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey DR7.

Cosmological parameters Abstract: We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB\ntemperature and lensing-potential power spectra.

In this model Planck data determine the\ncosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble\nconstant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density\nparameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement\nwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including\ncurvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to\npercent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an\nanalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets\nin addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are\nfavoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral\nindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes\nin the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95% upper limit of r<0.11 on\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like\nrelativistic particles.

When the neutron star is tidally disrupted, the gravitational\nwave emission is radically different from the black hole-black hole case and it\ncan be broadly classified in two groups, depending on the spatial extent of the\ndisrupted material.

Our\nreasoning is twofold: First, the incapability of the conventional matching\nconditions to accept the Nambu-Goto probe limit (even the geodesic limit of the\nIsrael matching conditions is not acceptable since being the geodesic equation\na kinematical fact it should be preserved for all gravitational theories or\ndefects, which is not the case for these conditions). Second, in our\nD-dimensional spacetime (maybe D=4), classical defects of any possible\ncodimension should be compatible. These matching conditions fail to accept\ncodimension-2 and 3 defects for D=4 (which represents effectively the spacetime\nat certain length and energy scales) and most probably fail to accept high\nenough codimensional defects for any D since there is no high enough Lovelock\ndensity to support them. Here, we propose alternative matching conditions which\nseem to satisfy the previous criteria. Instead of varying the brane-bulk action\nwith respect to the bulk metric at the brane position, we vary with respect to\nthe brane embedding fields so that the gravitational back-reaction is included.\nFor a codimension-2 brane in 6-dim EGB gravity we prove its consistency for an\naxially symmetric cosmological configuration.

We restrict our\nanalysis to the case of thin-walled cosmic strings which occur when large\nmagnetic flux trapped inside the string. Thus the string looks like a tube of\nfixed radius, at which it is classically stable. The core of the string\ncontains magnetic flux in the true vacuum, while outside the string, separated\nby a thin wall, is the false vacuum. The string decays by tunnelling to a\nconfiguration which is represented by a bulge, where the region of true vacuum\nwithin, is ostensibly enlarged. The bulge can be described as the meeting, of a\nkink soliton anti-soliton pair, along the length of the string. It can be\ndescribed as a bulge appearing in the initial string, starting from the string\nof small, classically stable radius, expanding to a fat string of large,\nclassically unstable (to expansion) radius and then returning back to the\nstring of small radius along its length. This configuration is the bounce point\nof a corresponding O(2) symmetric instanton, which we can determine\nnumerically. Once the bulge appears it explodes in real time. The kink soliton\nanti-soliton pair recede from each other along the length of the string with a\nvelocity that quickly approaches the speed of light, leaving behind a fat tube.\nAt the same time the radius of the fat tube that is being formed, expands\n(transversely) as it is no longer classically stable, converting false vacuum\nto the true vacuum with ever diluting magnetic field within. The rate of this\nexpansion is determined by the energy difference between the true vacuum and\nthe false vacuum.

This work addresses the AGN IR-selection dependency on intrinsic source\nluminosity and obscuration, in order to identify and charaterise biases which\ncould affect conclusions in studies. METHODS. We study IR-selected AGN in the\nChandra Deep Field South (CDFS) survey and in the Cosmological Survey (COSMOS).\nThe AGN sample is divided into low and high X-ray luminosity classes, and into\nunobscured (type-1) and obscured (type-2) classes by means of X-ray and optical\nspectroscopy data. Specifically in the X-rays regime, we adopt the intrinsic\nluminosity taking into account the estimated column density (N_H). We also take\nthe chance to highlight important differences resulting from adopting different\nmethods to assess AGN obscuration. RESULTS. In agreement with previous studies,\nwe also find that AGN IR-selection efficiency shows a decrease with decreasing\nsource AGN X-ray luminosity. For the intermediate-luminosity AGN population\n(43.3<~log(L_X[erg/s])<~44$), the efficiency also worsens with increasing\nobscuration. The same sample also shows an evolution with cosmic time of the\nobscured fraction at the highest X-ray luminosities, independently of adopted\ntype-1/type-2 classification method. CONCLUSIONS. We confirm that AGN\nIR-selection is genuinely biased toward unobscured AGN, but only at\nintermediate luminosities. At the highest luminosities, where AGN IR-selection\nis more efficient, there is no obscuration bias. We show that type-1 AGN are\nintrinsically more luminous than type-2 AGN only at z<~1.6, thus resulting in\nmore type-1 AGN being selected the shallower the IR survey is.

Using a long-simulation box we have followed the\nmagnetic-field amplification until it is fully developed and saturated. The\nturbulent velocity is sub-relativistic even for a strong shock. Magnetic-field\namplification is controled by the turbulent motion and saturation occurs when\nthe magnetic energy is comparable to the turbulent kinetic energy.\nMagnetic-field amplification and saturation depend on the initial strength and\ndirection of the magnetic field in the preshock medium, and on the shock\nstrength. If the initial magnetic field is perpendicular to the shock normal,\nthe magnetic field is first compressed at the shock and then can be amplified\nby turbulent motion in the postshock region.

This\nproblem has drawn renewed interest due to recent determinations of gas mass\nfractions beyond R200, which appear to be considerably larger than the cosmic\nmean, and because the clusters' total Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux receives a\nsignificant contribution from these regions. Here, we use a large suite of\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the clumpiness of density and\npressure and employ different variants of simulated physics, including\nradiative gas physics and thermal feedback by active galactic nuclei. We find\nthat density and pressure clumping closely trace each other as a function of\nradius, but the bias on density remains on average < 20% within the virial\nradius R200. At larger radius, clumping increases steeply due to the continuous\ninfall of coherent structures that have not yet passed the accretion shock.\nDensity and pressure clumping increase with cluster mass and redshift, which\nprobes on average dynamically younger objects that are still in the process of\nassembling. The angular power spectra of gas density and pressure show that the\nclumping signal is dominated by comparably large substructures with scales\n>R200/5, signaling the presence of gravitationally-driven \"super-clumping\". In\ncontrast, the angular power spectrum of the dark matter (DM) shows an almost\nuniform size distribution due to unimpeded subhalos.

In this paper, using the method of the\ncharacteristics, we analyze the causal structure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We\nhave the result that, on a Killing horizon, gravitons can propagate in the null\ndirection tangent to the Killing horizon. Therefore, a Killing horizon can be a\ncausal edge as in the case of general relativity, i.e. a Killing horizon is the\n\"event horizon\" in the sense of causality. We also analyze causal structures on\nnonstationary solutions with $(D-2)$-dimensional maximal symmetry, including\nspherically symmetric and flat spaces.

Second-order perturbation theory implies that the effect is\nsmall, but suggests that formally the perturbation series may not converge. The\namplitude of the effect is actually determined by the ratio of the Hubble\nscales at matter-radiation equality and today - which are entirely unrelated.\nThis implies that a universe with significantly lower temperature today could\nhave significant backreaction from more power on small scales, and so provides\nthe ideal testing ground for understanding backreaction. We investigate this\nusing two different N-body numerical simulations - a 3D Newtonian and a 1D\nsimulation which includes all relevant relativistic effects.

However, this single principle takes very different mathematical\nforms, with very different behaviors, depending on how one treats perturbed\nmotion.

A natural question is whether the same relations hold for\ndifferent compact objects and how they possibly approach the black-hole limit.\nHere we consider \"gravastars\", which are hypothetical compact objects sustained\nby their internal vacuum energy. Such solutions have been proposed as exotic\nalternatives to the black-hole paradigm because they can be as compact as black\nholes and exist in any mass range. By constructing slowly-rotating, thin-shell\ngravastars to quadratic order in the spin, we compute the moment of inertia\n$I$, the mass quadrupole moment $Q$, and the tidal Love number $\\lambda$ in\nexact form. The $I$-$\\lambda$-$Q$ relations of a gravastar are dramatically\ndifferent from those of an ordinary compact star, but the black-hole limit is\ncontinuous, i.e. these quantities approach their Kerr counterparts when the\ncompactness is maximum. Therefore, such relations can be used to discern a\ngravastar from an ordinary compact star, but not to break the degeneracy with\nthe black-hole case. Based on these results, we conjecture that the full\nmultipolar structure and the tidal deformability of a spinning, ultracompact\ngravastar are identical to those of a Kerr black hole. The approach to the\nblack-hole limit is nonpolynomial, thus differing from the critical behavior\nrecently found for strongly anisotropic neutron stars. \n\n"}

At the perturbative level, for cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) anisotropies, an increasing effective Planck mass\n($i$) suppresses the unlensed CMB power at $\\ell \\lesssim 30$ via the\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and ($ii$) enhances CMB lensing power.

The origin of\nthe thermal component and the relation between ULSs and standard (broad-band\nspectrum) ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are still controversial. We\nre-examined the X-ray spectral and timing properties of the M101 ULS using\narchival Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. We show that the X-ray\ntime-variability and spectral properties are inconsistent with standard disk\nemission. The characteristic radius R_{bb} of the thermal emitter varies from\nepoch to epoch between ~10,000 km and ~100,000 km; the colour temperature\nkT_{bb} varies between ~50 eV and ~140 eV; and the two quantities scale\napproximately as R_{bb} ~ T_{bb}^{-2}. In addition to the smooth continuum, we\nalso find (at some epochs) spectral residuals well fitted with thermal plasma\nmodels and absorption edges: we interpret this as evidence that we are looking\nat a clumpy, multi-temperature outflow. We suggest that at sufficiently high\naccretion rates and inclination angles, the super-critical, radiatively driven\noutflow becomes effectively optically thick and completely thermalizes the\nharder X-ray photons from the inner part of the inflow, removing the hard\nspectral tail. We develop a simple, spherically symmetric outflow model and\nshow that it is consistent with the observed temperatures, radii and\nluminosities.

Accretion of matter onto\nremnants of Population III stars leading to SMBHs is a very slow process, and\ntherefore, such models encounter difficulties in explaining quasars detected at\n$ z \\gtrsim 6$.

If\nthe condensate, made up of identical dark bosons of mass $m$, collapses to form\na black hole of mass $M_{eff}$ as soon as the former's effective size shrinks\nbelow the corresponding Schwarzschild radius, a simple inequality $ m \\ M_{eff}\n\\gtrsim 0.64 \\ m^2_{Pl} $ can be derived, that ensues from a competition\nbetween attractive self-gravity and quantum repulsion arising due to\nuncertainty principle.

Abstract: We point out that the horizon problem encountered in standard text-books or\nreview papers on cosmology is, in general, derived for world models based on\nRobertson-Walker line element where homogeneity and isotropy of the universe --\n\\`a la cosmological principle -- is assumed to begin with and is guaranteed for\nall epochs. Actually what all happens in that scenario is that in such a\nuniverse, whose evolutionary behaviour is described by a single scale factor,\nwhich may be time dependent but is otherwise independent of spatial\ncoordinates, the light signals in a finite time might not be covering all the\navailable space. Further, the flatness problem, as it is posed, is not even\nfalsifiable. The usual argument offered in the literature is that the present\ndensity of the universe is very close to the critical density value and that\nthe universe must be flat since otherwise in past at $\\sim10^{-35}$ second\n(near the epoch of inflation) there will be extremely low departures of density\nfrom the critical density value (of the order $\\sim10^{-53}$), requiring a sort\nof fine tuning.

We find that the distribution\nof dust is consistent with an exponential at all radii with a gradient of ~-1.7\ndex R$_{25}^{-1}$. Our dust temperature declines linearly from ~25 K in the\ncentre to 15 K at R$_{25}$ from where it remains constant out to ~2.0 R$_{25}$.\nThe surface-density of dust declines with radius at a similar rate to the\nsurface-density of stars but more slowly than the surface-density of the\nstar-formation rate.

In a\ncompanion paper, we found steady-state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations\nthat are coupled to the CR energy equation for a large cluster sample.

The mean occupation number $N$ of background gravitons\nturns out to be equal to the de Sitter horizon area in Planck units, while\ntheir frequency is given by the de Sitter Hubble parameter. In the\nsemi-classical limit, we show that the model reproduces all the known\nproperties of de Sitter, such as the redshift of probe particles and thermal\nGibbons-Hawking radiation, all in the language of quantum $S$-matrix\nscatterings and decays of coherent state gravitons. Most importantly, this\nframework allows to capture the $1/N$-effects to which the usual semi-classical\ntreatment is blind. They violate the de Sitter symmetry and lead to a finite\nquantum break-time of the de Sitter state equal to the de Sitter radius times\n$N$. We also point out that the quantum-break time is inversely proportional to\nthe number of particle species in the theory. Thus, the quantum break-time\nimposes the following consistency condition: Older and species-richer universes\nmust have smaller cosmological constants. For the maximal, phenomenologically\nacceptable number of species, the observed cosmological constant would saturate\nthis bound if our Universe were $10^{100}$ years old in its entire classical\nhistory. \n\n"}

We show that gas evolves from a non-star-forming to a\nstar-forming state on a relatively short time scale and thus the rate of this\nevolution does not limit the star formation rate. Instead, the star formation\nrate is limited because only a small fraction of star-forming gas is converted\ninto stars before star-forming regions are dispersed by feedback and dynamical\nprocesses. Thus, gas cycles into and out of star-forming state multiple times,\nwhich results in a long time scale on which galaxies convert gas into stars.\nOur model does not rely on the assumption of equilibrium and can be used to\ninterpret trends of depletion times with the properties of observed galaxies\nand the parameters of star formation and feedback recipes in simulations. In\nparticular, the model explains how feedback self-regulates the star formation\nrate in simulations and makes it insensitive to the local star formation\nefficiency.

We locate the\nsecular instability point along several constant baryon mass sequences of\nuniformly rotating strange stars described by the MIT bag model. Contrary to\nneutron stars, strange stars with T/|W| (the ratio of the rotational kinetic\nenergy to the absolute value of the gravitational potential energy) much lower\nthan the corresponding value for the mass-shed limit can be secularly unstable\nto bar mode formation if shear viscosity is high enough to damp out any\ndeviation from uniform rotation. The instability develops for a broad range of\ngravitational masses and rotational frequencies of strange quark stars. It\nimposes strong constraints on the lower limit of the frequency at the innermost\nstable circular orbit around rapidly rotating strange stars.

Abstract: When simulating the inspiral and coalescence of a binary black-hole system,\nspecial care needs to be taken in handling the singularities. Two main\ntechniques are used in numerical-relativity simulations: A first and more\ntraditional one ``excises'' a spatial neighbourhood of the singularity from the\nnumerical grid on each spacelike hypersurface. A second and more recent one,\ninstead, begins with a ``puncture'' solution and then evolves the full\n3-metric, including the singular point. In the continuum limit, excision is\njustified by the light-cone structure of the Einstein equations and, in\npractice, can give accurate numerical solutions when suitable discretizations\nare used. However, because the field variables are non-differentiable at the\npuncture, there is no proof that the moving-punctures technique is correct,\nparticularly in the discrete case. To investigate this question we use both\ntechniques to evolve a binary system of equal-mass non-spinning black holes. We\ncompare the evolution of two curvature 4-scalars with proper time along the\ninvariantly-defined worldline midway between the two black holes, using\nRichardson extrapolation to reduce the influence of finite-difference\ntruncation errors.

We find instantons, and calculate the rates,\nfor such processes. We show that after puncture, the hole grows exponentially\nat the same rate that the wall expands. It follows that the wall is never\ncompletely thermalized by a single expanding hole; at arbitrarily late times\nthere is still a large, thin shell of matter which may drive an exponential\nexpansion of the universe. We also study the situation where the wall is\nsubjected to multiple punctures. We find that in order to completely annihilate\nthe wall by this process, at least four string loops must be nucleated. We\nargue that this process may be relevant in certain brane-world scenarios, where\nthe universe itself is a domain wall. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/0204106", "contents": "Title: Nonlinearity without Superluminality Abstract: Quantum theory is compatible with special relativity. In particular, though\nmeasurements on entangled systems are correlated in a way that cannot be\nreproduced by local hidden variables, they cannot be used for superluminal\nsignalling. As Czachor, Gisin and Polchinski pointed out, this is not true for\ngeneral nonlinear modifications of the Schroedinger equation. Excluding\nsuperluminal signalling has thus been taken to rule out most nonlinear versions\nof quantum theory. The no superluminal signalling constraint has also been used\nfor alternative derivations of the optimal fidelities attainable for imperfect\nquantum cloning and other operations.\n  These results apply to theories satisfying the rule that their predictions\nfor widely separated and slowly moving entangled systems can be approximated by\nnon-relativistic equations of motion with respect to a preferred time\ncoordinate. This paper describes a natural way in which this rule might fail to\nhold. In particular, it is shown that quantum readout devices which display the\nvalues of localised pure states need not allow superluminal signalling,\nprovided that the devices display the values of the states of entangled\nsubsystems as defined in a non-standard, but natural, way. It follows that any\nlocally defined nonlinear evolution of pure states can be made consistent with\nMinkowski causality. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0406126", "contents": "Title: Quantum Positioning System Abstract: A quantum positioning system (QPS) is proposed that can provide a user with\nall four of his space-time coordinates. The user must carry a corner cube\nreflector, a good clock, and have a two-way classical channel of communication\nwith the origin of the reference frame. Four pairs of entangled photons\n(biphotons) are sent through four interferometers: three interferometers are\nused to determine the user's spatial position, and an additional interferometer\nis used to synchronize the user's clock to coordinate time in the reference\nframe. The spatial positioning part of the QPS is similar to a classical\ntime-of-arrival (TOA) system, however, a classical TOA system (such as GPS)\nmust have synchronized clocks that keep coordinate time and therefore the\nclocks must have long-term stability, whereas in the QPS only a photon\ncoincidence counter is needed and the clocks need only have short-term\nstability. Several scenarios are considered for a QPS: one is a terrestrial\nsystem and another is a space-based-system composed of low-Earth orbit (LEO)\nsatellites. Calculations indicate that for a space-based system, neglecting\natmospheric effects, a position accuracy below the 1 cm-level is possible for\nmuch of the region near the Earth. The QPS may be used as a primary system to\ndefine a global 4-dimensional reference frame. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/9810074", "contents": "Title: Insufficient reason and entropy in quantum theory Abstract: The objective of the consistent-amplitude approach to quantum theory has been\nto justify the mathematical formalism on the basis of three main assumptions:\nthe first defines the subject matter, the second introduces amplitudes as the\ntools for quantitative reasoning, and the third is an interpretative rule that\nprovides the link to the prediction of experimental outcomes. In this work we\nintroduce a natural and compelling fourth assumption: if there is no reason to\nprefer one region of the configuration space over another then they should be\n`weighted' equally. This is the last ingredient necessary to introduce a unique\ninner product in the linear space of wave functions. Thus, a form of the\nprinciple of insufficient reason is implicit in the Hilbert inner product.\nArmed with the inner product we obtain two results. First, we elaborate on an\nearlier proof of the Born probability rule. The implicit appeal to insufficient\nreason shows that quantum probabilities are not more objective than classical\nprobabilities. Previously we had argued that the consistent manipulation of\namplitudes leads to a linear time evolution; our second result is that time\nevolution must also be unitary. The argument is straightforward and hinges on\nthe conservation of entropy. The only subtlety consists of defining the correct\nentropy; it is the array entropy, not von Neumann's. After unitary evolution\nhas been established we proceed to introduce the useful notion of observables\nand we explore how von Neumann's entropy can be linked to Shannon's information\ntheory. Finally, we discuss how various connections among the postulates of\nquantum theory are made explicit within this approach. \n\n"}
