Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie.

Thus, reliable bar axial ratios\ncan only be determined by taking into account the contributions of bulge and\ndisc to the light distribution in the galaxy image.

In the metric formalism the parameter m=Rf_{,RR}/f_{,R}\ncharacterising the deviation from the Lambda CDM model is constrained to be\nvery small during the matter era in order to ensure compatibility with LGC, but\nthe models in which m grows to the order of 10^{-1} around the present epoch\ncan be allowed.

This is in\ncontrast to matter density perturbations which, on galactic scales, place far\nmore stringent constraints on the present deviation parameter m of the order of\n|m| < 10^{-5} - 10^{-4}.

We analyze the spin evolution in three specific scenarios: (1) spin\nevolves only through mergers, (2) spin evolves through mergers and prolonged\naccretion episodes, (3) spin evolves through mergers and short-lived (chaotic)\naccretion episodes. We study how different diagnostics can distinguish between\nthese evolutionary scenarios, assessing the discriminating power of\ngravitational-wave measurements and X-ray spectroscopy. Gravitational radiation\ncan produce three different types of spin measurements, yielding respectively\nthe spins of the two black holes in a binary inspiral prior to merger, the spin\nof the merger remnant (as encoded in the ringdown waves), and the spin of\n``single'' black holes during the extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) of compact\nobjects.

GRB 061126 was a long burst (T_90=191 s) with four\noverlapping peaks in its gamma-ray light curve.

This late-time accretion can in principle provide\nsufficient energy to power the late-time activity observed from some\nshort-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, because outflows during the\nadvective phase unbind the majority of the remaining mass, it is difficult for\nthe remnant disk alone to produce significant accretion power well beyond the\nonset of the advective phase.

In spirals, the SFE of H2 alone is nearly\nconstant at 5.25 +/- 2.5 x 10^(-10) yr^(-1) (equivalent to an H2 depletion time\nof 1.9x10^9 yr) as a function of all of these variables at our 800 pc\nresolution.

This allows us to investigate how the final properties of the\nsimulated galaxies correlate with the formation histories of their haloes. We\nfind that, at z = 0, none of our galaxies contain a disc with more than 20 per\ncent of its total stellar mass. Four of the eight galaxies nevertheless have\nwell-formed disc components, three have dominant spheroids and very small\ndiscs, and one is a spheroidal galaxy with no disc at all. The z = 0 spheroids\nare made of old stars, while discs are younger and formed from the inside-out.\nNeither the existence of a disc at z = 0 nor the final disc-to-total mass ratio\nseems to depend on the spin parameter of the halo. Discs are formed in haloes\nwith spin parameters as low as 0.01 and as high as 0.05; galaxies with little\nor no disc component span the same range in spin parameter. Except for one of\nthe simulated galaxies, all have significant discs at z > ~2, regardless of\ntheir z = 0 morphologies. Major mergers and instabilities which arise when\naccreting cold gas is misaligned with the stellar disc trigger a transfer of\nmass from the discs to the spheroids. In some cases, discs are destroyed, while\nin others, they survive or reform. This suggests that the survival probability\nof discs depends on the particular formation history of each galaxy. A\nrealistic Lambda-CDM model will clearly require weaker star formation at high\nredshift and later disc assembly than occurs in our models. \n\n"}

Through\npost-processing we investigate what kinds of feedback would be required to\nreproduce observed galaxy masses and star formation rates. To mimic an extreme\nform of \"preventive\" feedback (e.g., AGN radio mode) we remove all baryonic\nmass that was originally accreted via \"hot mode\" from shock-heated gas. This\ndoes not bring the high mass end of the galaxy mass function into agreement\nwith observations because much of the stellar mass in these systems formed at\nhigh redshift from baryons that originally accreted via \"cold mode\" onto lower\nmass progenitors. An efficient \"ejective\" feedback mechanism, such as supernova\ndriven winds, must reduce the masses of these progenitors. Feedback must also\nreduce the masses of lower mass z=0 galaxies, which assemble at lower redshifts\nand have much lower star formation rates.

Stochastic variations in metallicity arise because of the finite\nnumbers of supernova. We construct an analytic formulation of the combined\neffects of pre-enrichment and self-enrichment and use Monte Carlo models to\nverify that the model accurately encapsulates the mean metallicity and\nmetallicity spread among real GCs. The predicted metallicity spread due to\nself-enrichment alone, a robust prediction of the model, is much smaller than\nthe observed spread among real GCs. This result rules out self-enrichment as a\nsignificant contributor to the metal content in most GCs, leaving\npre-enrichment as the viable alternative.

Galactic\n  Structure, Fundamental Parameters and Non-Circular Motions Abstract: We are using the VLBA and the Japanese VERA project to measure trigonometric\nparallaxes and proper motions of masers found in high-mass star-forming regions\nacross the Milky Way. Early results from 18 sources locate several spiral arms.\nThe Perseus spiral arm has a pitch angle of 16 +/- 3 degrees, which favors four\nrather than two spiral arms for the Galaxy. Combining positions, distances,\nproper motions, and radial velocities yields complete 3-dimensional kinematic\ninformation. We find that star forming regions on average are orbiting the\nGalaxy ~15 km/s slower than expected for circular orbits. By fitting the\nmeasurements to a model of the Galaxy, we estimate the distance to the Galactic\ncenter R_o = 8.4 +/- 0.6 kpc and a circular rotation speed Theta_o = 254 +/- 16\nkm/s. The ratio Theta_o/R_o can be determined to higher accuracy than either\nparameter individually, and we find it to be 30.3 +/- 0.9 km/s/kpc, in good\nagreement with the angular rotation rate determined from the proper motion of\nSgr A*. The data favor a rotation curve for the Galaxy that is nearly flat or\nslightly rising with Galactocentric distance. Kinematic distances are generally\ntoo large, sometimes by factors greater than two; they can be brought into\nbetter agreement with the trigonometric parallaxes by increasing Theta_o/R_o\nfrom the IAU recommended value of 25.9 km/s/kpc to a value near 30 km/s/kpc. We\noffer a \"revised\" prescription for calculating kinematic distances and their\nuncertainties, as well as a new approach for defining Galactic coordinates.\nFinally, our estimates of Theta_o and To/R_o, when coupled with direct\nestimates of R_o, provide evidence that the rotation curve of the Milky Way is\nsimilar to that of the Andromeda galaxy, suggesting that the dark matter halos\nof these two dominant Local Group galaxy are comparably massive. \n\n"}

Since the stellar mass profile is exponential, only\ndifferences in the stellar populations can be the cause of the luminosity\nbreak. Although we find a cutoff for the star formation rate imposed by a\ndensity threshold in our star formation model, it does not coincide with the\nluminosity break and is located at 4.3 +- 0.4 disk scale lengths, with star\nformation going on between both radii.

The bulge and thick disks of modern\ngalaxies may form this way. Simulations of minor mergers make thick disks too,\nbut there is an important difference. Thick disks made by internal processes\nhave a constant scale height with galactocentric radius, but thick disks made\nby mergers flare. The difference arises because in the first case,\nperpendicular forcing and disk-gravity resistance are both proportional to the\ndisk column density, so the resulting scale height is independent of this\ndensity.

The evolution of each mass in the HR diagram occurs\nalong vertical tracks that, when the core helium is consumed, evolve to higher\nTeff and then to the white dwarf stage. The larger is the mass, the smaller is\nthe Teff of the models, so that the zero age horizontal branch (ZAHB) is\n\"horizontal\". In this paper we show that, if the helium mass fraction (Y) of\nthe envelope is larger than Y~0.5, the shape of the tracks changes completely:\nthe hydrogen burning becomes efficient again also for very small envelope\nmasses, thanks to the higher molecular weight and to the higher temperatures of\nthe hydrogen shell. The larger is Y, the smaller is the envelope mass that\nprovides strong H-shell burning. These tracks have a curled shape, are located\nat a Teff following the approximate relation Teff=8090+ 32900xY, and become\nmore luminous for larger envelope masses. Consequently, the ZAHB of the very\nhigh helium models is \"vertical\" in the HR diagram. Synthetic models based on\nthese tracks nicely reproduce the location and shape of the \"blue hook\" in the\nglobular cluster wCen, best fit by a very high Teff (bluer) sequence with\nY=0.80 and a cooler (redder) one with Y=0.65. Although these precise values of\nY may depend on the color-Teff conversions, we know that the helium content of\nthe progenitors of the blue hook stars can not be larger than Y~0.38-0.40, if\nthey are descendants of the cluster blue main sequence. Consequently, this\ninterpretation implies that all these objects must in fact be progeny of the\nblue main sequence, but they have all suffered further deep mixing, that has\nlargely and uniformly increased their surface helium abundance, during the red\ngiant branch evolution. A late helium flash can not be the cause of this deep\nmixing, as the models we propose have hydrogen rich envelopes much more massive\nthan those required for a late flash.

Therefore the two components that are seen\nin edge-on Sb galaxies such as NGC 4565 are a disk and a bar. But face-on SBb\ngalaxies always show a disk, a bar, and a (pseudo)bulge. Where is the\n(pseudo)bulge in NGC 4565? We use archival Hubble Space Telescope H-band images\nand Spitzer Space Telescope 3.6 micron wavelength images, both calibrated to\n2MASS K_s band, to penetrate the prominent dust lane in NGC 4565. We find a\nhigh surface brightness, central stellar component that is clearly distinct\nfrom the boxy bar and from the disk. Its brightness profile is a Sersic\nfunction with index n = 1.55 +- 0.07 along the major axis and 1.33 +- 0.12\nalong the minor axis. Therefore it is a pseudobulge. It is much less luminous\nthan the boxy bar, so the true pseudobulge-to-total luminosity ratio of the\ngalaxy is PB/T = 0.06 +- 0.01, much less than the previously believed value of\nB/T = 0.4 for the boxy bulge. We infer that published B/T luminosity ratios of\nedge-on galaxies with boxy bulges have been overestimated. Therefore, more\ngalaxies than we thought contain little or no evidence of a merger-built\nclassical bulge. From a formation point of view, NGC 4565 is a giant, pure-disk\ngalaxy. This presents a challenge to our picture of galaxy formation by\nhierarchical clustering: it is difficult to grow galaxies as big as NGC 4565\nwithout also making big classical bulges. \n\n"}

Therefore, some cooling mechanism, for example\ndissipational effects of the interstellar medium, was assumed to be necessary\nto keep the spiral arms. Here we show that stellar disks can maintain spiral\nfeatures for several tens of rotations without the help of cooling, using a\nseries of high-resolution three-dimensional $N$-body simulations of pure\nstellar disks. We found that if the number of particles is sufficiently large,\ne.g., $3\\times 10^6$, multi-arm spirals developed in an isolated disk can\nsurvive for more than 10 Gyrs. We confirmed that there is a self-regulating\nmechanism that maintains the amplitude of the spiral arms. Spiral arms increase\nToomre's $Q$ of the disk, and the heating rate correlates with the squared\namplitude of the spirals. Since the amplitude itself is limited by the value of\n$Q$, this makes the dynamical heating less effective in the later phase of\nevolution. A simple analytical argument suggests that the heating is caused by\ngravitational scattering of stars by spiral arms, and that the self-regulating\nmechanism in pure-stellar disks can effectively maintain spiral arms on a\ncosmological timescale. In the case of a smaller number of particles, e.g.,\n$3\\times 10^5$, spiral arms grow faster in the beginning of the simulation\n(while $Q$ is small) and they cause a rapid increase of $Q$. As a result, the\nspiral arms become faint in several Gyrs. \n\n"}

In this model optical\nhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circular\nvelocity, at higher redshifts. This model also predicts that the scaling\nrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than the\ncorresponding stellar relations.

In this regime, HI is likely to represent most of the ISM\nand FUV emission to trace recent star formation with little bias due to\nextinction, so that the two quantities closely trace the underlying\nrelationship between gas and star formation rate (SFR).

Among\nother ideas, it has been suggested that a non-linear resonance between two\noscillation modes in an accretion disc orbiting either a black hole or a\nneutron star plays a role in exciting the observed modulation. Several possible\nresonances have been discussed. A particular model assumes resonances in which\nthe disc-oscillation modes have the eigenfrequencies equal to the radial and\nvertical epicyclic frequencies of geodesic orbital motion. This model has been\ndiscussed for black hole microquasar sources as well as for a group of neutron\nstar sources. Assuming several neutron (strange) star equations of state and\nHartle-Thorne geometry of rotating stars, we briefly compare the frequencies\nexpected from the model to those observed. Our comparison implies that the\ninferred neutron star radius \"RNS\" is larger than the related radius of the\nmarginally stable circular orbit \"rms\" for nuclear matter equations of state\nand spin frequencies up to 800Hz. For the same range of spin and a strange star\n(MIT) equation of state, the inferrred radius RNS is roughly equal to rms. The\nPaczynski modulation mechanism considered within the model requires that RNS <\nrms. However, we find this condition to be fulfilled only for the strange\nmatter equation of state, masses below one solar mass, and spin frequencies\nabove 800Hz. This result most likely falsifies the postulation of the neutron\nstar 3:2 resonant eigenfrequencies being equal to the frequencies of geodesic\nradial and vertical epicyclic modes. We suggest that the 3:2 epicyclic modes\ncould stay among the possible choices only if a fairly non-geodesic accretion\nflow is assumed, or if a different modulation mechanism operates. \n\n"}

{"id": "1010.1381", "contents": "Title: The Two Phases of Galaxy Formation Abstract: Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation appear to show a two-phase\ncharacter with a rapid early phase at z>2 during which in-situ stars are formed\nwithin the galaxy from infalling cold gas followed by an extended phase since\nz<3 during which ex-situ stars are primarily accreted. In the latter phase\nmassive systems grow considerably in mass and radius by accretion of smaller\nsatellite stellar systems formed at quite early times (z>3) outside of the\nvirial radius of the forming central galaxy. These tentative conclusions are\nobtained from high resolution re-simulations of 39 individual galaxies in a\nfull cosmological context with present-day virial halo masses ranging from 7e11\nM_sun h^-1 < M_vir < 2.7e13 M_sun h^-1 and central galaxy masses between 4.5e10\nM_sun h^-1 < M_* < 3.6e11 M_sun h^-1. The simulations include the effects of a\nuniform UV background, radiative cooling, star formation and energetic feedback\nfrom SNII. The importance of stellar accretion increases with galaxy mass and\ntowards lower redshift. In our simulations lower mass galaxies ($M_* < 9e10\nM_sun h^-1) accrete about 60 per cent of their present-day stellar mass. High\nmass galaxy ($M_* > 1.7e11 M_sun h^-1) assembly is dominated by accretion and\nmerging with about 80 per cent of the stars added by the present-day. In\ngeneral the simulated galaxies approximately double their mass since z=1. For\nmassive systems this mass growth is not accompanied by significant star\nformation. The majority of the in-situ created stars is formed at z>2,\nprimarily out of cold gas flows. We recover the observational result of\narchaeological downsizing, where the most massive galaxies harbor the oldest\nstars. We find that this is not in contradiction with hierarchical structure\nformation. Most stars in the massive galaxies are formed early on in smaller\nstructures, the galaxies themselves are assembled late. \n\n"}

When plotting our Fgamma/Fx\nvalues as a function of the pulsars' rotational energy losses, one immediately\nsees that pulsars with similar energetics have Fgamma/Fx spanning 3 decades.\nSuch spread, most probably stemming from vastly different geometrical\nconfigurations of the X and gamma-ray emitting regions, defies any\nstraightforward interpretation of the plot.

The spectrum can retain the shape of a Planck\nfunction or it can be broadened and have the shape of a Band function. This\nfact is best illustrated by studying GRB090902B: The main gamma-ray spectral\ncomponent is initially close to a Planck function, which can only be explained\nby emission from the jet photosphere. Later, the same component evolves into a\nbroader Band function. This burst thus provides observational evidence that the\nphotosphere can give rise to a non-thermal spectrum. We show that such a\nbroadening is most naturally explained by subphotospheric dissipation in the\njet. The broadening mainly depends on the strength and location of the\ndissipation, on the magnetic field strength, and on the relation between the\nenergy densities of thermal photons and of the electrons. We suggest that the\nevolution in spectral shape observed in GRB090902B is due to a decrease of the\nbulk Lorentz factor of the flow, leading to the main dissipation becoming\nsubphotospheric. Such a change in the flow parameters can also explain the\ncorrelation observed between the peak energy of the spectrum and low-energy\npower law slope, alpha, a correlation commonly observed in GRBs. We conclude\nthat photospheric emission could indeed be a ubiquitous feature during the\nprompt phase in GRBs and play a decisive role in creating the diverse spectral\nshapes and spectral evolutions that are observed. \n\n"}

Abstract: To gain new insights into the radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy reported for\nactive galactic nuclei, we examine radio loudness as a function of Eddington\nratio for a previously published sample of 199 AGN from five different\npopulations. After initially considering radio loudnesses derived using total\nradio luminosities, we repeat the investigation using core radio luminosities\nonly, applying a previously established mass correction for these core\nluminosities. In both cases, for Eddington ratios < 1 per cent, Fanaroff-Riley\ntype I and broad-line radio galaxies are on average more radio-loud than\nSeyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. However, the\ndistribution of radio loudnesses for the mass-corrected, core-only sample is\nmuch narrower than that of the clearly bimodal total radio loudness\ndistribution. The advantages and disadvantages of using core- or lobe-dominated\nradio luminosity as a measure of instantaneous jet power are discussed. We\nfurthermore compare the core and total radio luminosities for the entire\nsample, as well as illustrating the importance of the mass term by comparing\nthe AGN with a sample of black hole X-ray binaries. We conclude that if the\nmass-corrected core radio luminosity is a good measure of jet power, then black\nhole spin may have considerably less impact on jet power than previously\nreported, or that our sample does not include the extremes of spin. If the\nspread in jet power is small then we suggest that characteristics of the\nambient environment and/or the radio source age could be equally as important\nin producing a radio-loud/radio-quiet dichotomy seen in total radio luminosity. \n\n"}

Our analysis of 61\nSNe with high-quality light curves indicates that the longer the time between\nexplosion and maximum light (i.e., the rise time), the slower the decline of\nthe light curve after maximum. However, SNe with slower post-maximum decline\nrates have a faster rise than would be expected from a single-parameter family\nof light curves, indicating that SN Ia light curves are not a single-parameter\nfamily of varying widths. Comparison of the B-band rise-time distribution for\nspectroscopically normal SNe Ia to those exhibiting high-velocity spectral\nfeatures indicates that high-velocity (HV) SNe Ia have shorter B-band rise\ntimes compared to their spectroscopically normal counterparts. After\nnormalising the B-band light curves to Dm15(B)= 1.1 mag (i.e., correcting the\npost-maximum decline to have the same shape as our template), we find that\nspectroscopically normal SNe Ia have a rise time of 18.03 +/- 0.24 d, while HV\nSNe have a faster B-band rise time of 16.63 +/- 0.29 d.

Specifically, we\nfind that the density at the centre of typical high redshift galaxies was at a\nlevel where the Bondi accretion rate implies a diffusion speed of photons that\nwas slower than the gravitational infall velocity, resulting in photons being\ntrapped within the accretion flow and advected into the black-hole. We show\nthat there is a range of black-hole masses (M_bh ~ 10^3-10^5 solar masses)\nwhere the accretion flow traps radiation, corresponding to black-holes that\nwere massive enough to generate a photon trapping accretion flow, but small\nenough that their Bondi radii did not exceed the isothermal scale height of\nself-gravitating gas. Under these conditions we find that the accretion reaches\nlevels far in excess of the Eddington rate. A prediction of this scenario is\nthat X-ray number counts of active galactic nuclei at z>6 would exhibit a\ncutoff at the low luminosities corresponding to black-hole masses below ~10^5\nsolar masses. At low redshifts we find photon trapping to be unimportant\nbecause it could only occur in rare low spin halos, and would require\nblack-hole masses in excess of expectations from the observed black-hole - halo\nmass relation.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the cooling of\nrotationally deformed, two-dimensional (2D) neutron stars in the framework of\ngeneral relativity theory, with the ultimate goal of better understand the\nimpact of 2D effects on the thermal evolution of such objects.

We argue that the main cause of the catastrophic cooling is a\nmismatch between the mass of the gas in which the energy is injected and the\nmass of the parent stellar population. Because too much mass is heated, the\ntemperatures are too low and the cooling times too short. We use analytic\narguments to estimate, as a function of the gas density and the numerical\nresolution, the minimum heating temperature that is required for the injected\nthermal energy to be efficiently converted into kinetic energy. We then propose\nand test a stochastic implementation of thermal feedback that uses this minimum\ntemperature increase as an input parameter and that can be employed in both\nparticle- and grid-based codes.

SNe Iax are spectroscopically\nsimilar to SNe Ia, but have lower maximum-light velocities (2000 < |v| < 8000\nkm/s), typically lower peak magnitudes (-14.2 > M_V,peak > -18.9 mag), and most\nhave hot photospheres. Relative to SNe Ia, SNe Iax have low luminosities for\ntheir light-curve shape. There is a correlation between luminosity and\nlight-curve shape, similar to that of SNe Ia, but offset from that of SNe Ia\nand with larger scatter. Despite a host-galaxy morphology distribution that is\nhighly skewed to late-type galaxies without any SNe Iax discovered in\nelliptical galaxies, there are several indications that the progenitor stars\nare white dwarfs (WDs): evidence of C/O burning in their maximum-light spectra,\nlow ejecta masses, strong Fe lines in their late-time spectra, a lack of X-ray\ndetections, and deep limits on massive stars and star formation at the SN\nsites.

We argue that the removal of the baryonic\ncomponent from gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxies, the progenitors of dSphs, can\nsubstantially reduce their central density. Thus, it may play an important role\nin alleviating one of the problems of the CDM model related to the structure of\nrelatively massive satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW). Traditionally,\ncollisionless cosmological N-body simulations are used when confronting\ntheoretical predictions with observations. However, these simulations assume\nthat the baryon fraction everywhere in the Universe is equal to the cosmic\nmean, which can be incorrect for dSphs. We find that the combination of (i) the\nlower baryon fraction in dSphs compared to the cosmic mean and (ii) the\nconcentration of baryons in the inner part of the MW halo can go a long way\ntowards explaining the observed circular velocity profiles of dSphs. We find\nthat the blowing away of baryons by ram pressure, when the dwarfs fall into\nlarger galaxies, decreases the circular velocity profile of the satellite and\nreduces the density in the central ~200-500 pc by a factor of (1 - f_b)^4 ~\n0.5, where f_b is the cosmological fraction of baryons. Additionally, the\nenhanced baryonic mass in the central regions of the parent galaxy generates\ntidal forces, which are larger than those experienced by subhaloes in\ntraditional N-body simulations.

A 545GHz flux density limit was chosen so that\nthe sample is 80% complete at this frequency, giving a sample of 234 local\ngalaxies. We investigate the dust emission and star formation properties of the\nsample via various models & calculate the local dust mass function. Although\n1-component modified black bodies fit the dust emission longward of 80um very\nwell (median beta=1.83) the degeneracy between dust temp & beta also means that\nthe SEDs are very well described by a dust emissivity index fixed at beta=2 and\n10<T<25 K. Although a second, warmer dust component is required to fit shorter\nwavelength data, & contributes ~1/3 of the total infrared emission, its mass is\nnegligible. No evidence is found for a very cold (6-10 K) dust component. The\ntemp of the cold dust component is strongly influenced by the ratio of the star\nformation rate to the total dust mass. This implies, contrary to what is often\nassumed, that a significant fraction of even the emission from ~20 K dust is\npowered by ongoing star formation, whether or not the dust itself is associated\nwith star forming clouds or `cirrus'. There is statistical evidence of a\nfree-free contribution to the 217GHz flux densities of <20%.

The HEROES project was set up to observe a sample of seven large\nedge-on galaxies across various wavelengths for this investigation.\n  Aims. Within this first paper, we present the Herschel observations and\nperform a qualitative and quantitative analysis on them, and we derive some\nglobal properties of the far infrared and submillimetre emission.\n  Methods. We determine horizontal and vertical profiles from the Herschel\nobservations of the galaxies in the sample and describe the morphology.\nModified black-body fits to the global fluxes, measured using aperture\nphotometry, result in dust temperatures and dust masses. The latter values are\ncompared to those that are derived from radiative transfer models taken from\nthe literature.\n  Results. On the whole, our Herschel flux measurements agree well with\narchival values.

The\naccretion and associated luminosity bursts in our model are caused by disk\ngravitational fragmentation followed by quick migration of the fragments onto\nthe forming protostar. We found that bursts with luminosity on the order of\n100-200 L_sun can evaporate CO ices in part of the envelope. The typical\nfreeze-out time of the gas-phase CO onto dust grains in the envelope (a few\nkyr) is much longer than the burst duration (100-200 yr).

Once the material that makes up galaxy disks is converted into stars,\ntheir overall angular momentum distribution cannot change by much, but that of\nthe gas is generally far more liable to rearrangement, allowing rings and\npseudo-bulges to form. While simulations are powerful tools from which we have\nlearned a great deal, those of disks may suffer from collisional relaxation\nthat requires some results to be interpreted with caution. \n\n"}

The strength of the halo field is\ncomparable to that of the disk. The total and turbulent magnetic field strength\nis (weakly) increasing with the star formation. There are, however, indications\nthat stronger star formation reduces the magnetic field regularity globally.\nThe magnetic field in spiral galaxies is generally thought to be amplified and\nmaintained by dynamo action. During the galaxy's formation and evolution the\nturbulent dynamo amplifies the field strength to energy equipartition with the\nturbulent gas, while the large-scale (mean-field) dynamo mainly orders the\nmagnetic field. Hence, the large-scale magnetic field pattern evolves with\ntime. Supernova explosions causes a further continuous injection of turbulent\nmagnetic fields. Assuming that this small-scale field injection is situated\nonly within the spiral arm region where star formation mostly occurs lead to a\nlarge-scale field structure in which the magnetic field regularity is stronger\nin the interarm region as observed in several nearby spiral galaxies. The\ndetection of similar scale heights in several spiral galaxies of different\nHubble type star formation implies a relation between the galactic wind, the\ntotal magnetic field strength and the star formation in the galaxy.

We\nuse the M(H2) vs. M* scaling relation to define the H2-deficiency parameter.\nThis parameter shows a weak and scattered relation with the HI-def, here taken\nas a proxy for galaxy interactions with the cluster environment. We also show\nthat, as for the HI, the extent of the H2 disc decreases with increasing\nHI-deficiency. These results show that cluster galaxies have, on average, a\nlower H2 content than similar objects in the field. The slope of the H2-def vs.\nHI-def relation is less than 1, while the D(HI)/D(i) vs. HI-def relation is\nsteeper than the D(CO)/D(i) vs. HI-def relation, thereby indicating that the H2\ngas is removed less efficiently than the HI.

The ratio of the integrated SFRs from the RC\nemission to that of the FUV/MIR-based SF tracers is R_int = 0.78 +/- 0.38,\nconsistent with Condon's relation. We find a tight correlation between the\nradial profiles of the radio and FUV/MIR-based Sigma_SFR for the entire extent\nof the disk. The ratio R of the azimuthally averaged radio to FUV/MIR-based\nSigma_SFR agrees with the integrated ratio with only small quasi-random\nfluctuations as function of radius.

The parent sample, selected to be faint or\nundetected in the WISE 3.4um (W1) and 4.6um (W2) bands but bright at 12um (W3)\nand 22um (W4), are extremely rare, with only ~1000 so-called W1W2-dropouts\nacross the extragalactic sky. Optical spectroscopy reveals typical redshifts of\nz~2 for this population, implying rest-frame mid-IR luminosities of L(6um)~6e46\nerg/s and bolometric luminosities that can exceed L(bol)~1e14 L(sun). The\ncorresponding intrinsic, unobscured hard X-ray luminosities are L(2-10)~4e45\nerg/s for typical quasar templates. These are amongst the most luminous AGN\nknown, though the optical spectra rarely show evidence of a broad-line region\nand the selection criteria imply heavy obscuration even at rest-frame 1.5um. We\ndesigned our X-ray observations to obtain robust detections for gas column\ndensities N(H)<1e24 /cm2. In fact, the sources prove to be fainter than these\npredictions. Two of the sources were observed by both NuSTAR and XMM-Newton,\nwith neither being detected by NuSTAR and one being faintly detected by\nXMM-Newton.

However, when the topology of iso-density\ncontour surfaces is measured from an observational data, many systematic\neffects are introduced due to the finite size of pixels used to define the\ndensity field, non-linear gravitational evolution, redshift-space distortion,\nshot noise (discrete sampling), and bias in the distribution of the density\nfield tracers. We study the various systematic effects on the genus curve to a\ngreat accuracy by using the Horizon Run 2 simulation of a {\\Lambda}CDM\ncosmology.

It is found that all the\nnon-Gaussian deviations due to the systematic effects can be modeled by using a\nfew low-order Hermite polynomials from H0 to H4.

We find that the object exhibits two distinct modes of\nemission; a strong mode with a broad profile and a weak mode with a narrow\nprofile. During the strong mode of emission, the pulsar typically radiates very\nenergetic emission over sequences of ~200-6000 pulses (~60 s-24 min), with\napparent nulls over time-scales of up to a few pulses at a time. Emission\nduring the weak mode is observed outside of these strong-mode sequences and\nmanifests as occasional bursts of up to a few clearly detectable pulses at a\ntime, as well as low-level underlying emission which is only detected through\nprofile integration. This implies that the previously described null mode may\nin fact be representative of the bottom-end of the pulse intensity distribution\nfor the source. This is supported by the dramatic pulse-to-pulse intensity\nmodulation and rarity of exceptionally bright pulses observed during both modes\nof emission. Coupled with the fact that the source could be interpreted as a\nrotating radio transient (RRAT)-like object for the vast majority of the time,\nif placed at a further distance, we advance that this object likely represents\na bridge between RRATs and extreme moding pulsars. Further to these emission\nproperties, we also show that the source is consistent with being a\nnear-aligned rotator and that it does not exhibit any measurable spin-down rate\nvariation. These results suggest that nulls observed in other intermittent\nobjects may in fact be representative of very weak emission without the need\nfor complete cessation.

Using a recently published (Nemmen + Tchekhovskoy 2014) high-quality\nsample of 27 radio galaxies, I construct a P_B-P_jet diagram that includes\ninformation on optical AGN types as far as available. This diagram indicates\nthat the jet production efficiency is a function of AGN type: Seyfert 2\ngalaxies seem to be systematically (with a false alarm probability of 0.043%)\nless efficient, by about one order of magnitude, in powering jets than Seyfert\n1 galaxies, LINERs, or the remaining radio galaxies. This suggests an\nevolutionary sequence from Sy2s to Sy1s and LINERs, controlled by an interplay\nof jets on the one hand and dust and gas in galactic nuclei on the other hand.\nWhen taking this effect into account, the P_B-P_jet relation is probably much\ntighter intrinsically than currently assumed. \n\n"}

Although our\nresults show that the star formation rate (SFR) and the stellar mass of central\ngalaxies in smaller halos are slightly affected by the assembly bias of halos,\nthose galaxies are faint, and the difference in the SFR is minute, and\ntherefore it is challenging to detect it in real galaxies given the current\nobservational accuracy.

Its nonlinear properties are most easily seen when we compare the ADM\nmass of the solution and the integral of the local mass density: the difference\nbetween them, i.e. the relativistic mass deficit, can be significant provided\nthat the inhomogeneities extend to sufficiently small scales. The\nnon-additivity of masses implies a large backreaction effect, i.e. significant\ndiscrepancy between the averaged, large-scale effective stress-energy tensor\nand the naive average of the local energy density. I show that this is a\ngeneral relativistic effect arising due to the inhomogeneous, multiscale\nstructure.

This paper uses the properties of 10-20Myr A star debris disks\nto consider the protoplanetary to debris disk transition. The physical\ndistinction between these two classes is argued to rest on the presence of\nprimordial gas in sufficient quantities to dominate the motion of small dust\ngrains (not the secondary nature of the dust or its level of stirring). This\nmotivates an observational classification based on the dust spectrum,\nempirically defined so that A star debris disks require fractional excesses <3\nat 12um and <2000 at 70um. We also propose a hypothesis to test, that the main\nsequence planet/planetesimal structures are already in place (but obscured)\nduring the protoplanetary disk phase. This may be only weakly true if planetary\narchitectures change until frozen during disk dispersal, or completely false if\nplanets and planetesimals form during disk dispersal.

The first\nplanets detected by microlensing were well described by the two-point-mass\nmodel of a star with one planet. By the end of 2014, four events involving\nthree-point-mass lenses had been announced. Two of the lenses were stars with\ntwo planetary companions each; two were binary stars with a planet orbiting one\ncomponent. While the two-point-mass model is well understood, the same cannot\nbe said for lenses with three or more components. Even the range of possible\ncritical-curve topologies and caustic geometries of the three-point-mass lens\nremains unknown.

We test this claim by performing a\ncounts-in-cells analysis of mock SMG catalogues derived from the Bolshoi\ncosmological simulation to investigate how well SMG associations trace the\nunderlying dark matter structure. We find that SMGs exhibit a relatively\ncomplex bias: some regions of high SMG overdensity are underdense in terms of\ndark matter mass, and some regions of high dark matter overdensity contain no\nSMGs. Because of their rarity, Poisson noise causes scatter in the SMG\noverdensity at fixed dark matter overdensity. Consequently, rich associations\nof less-luminous, more-abundant galaxies (i.e. Lyman-break galaxy analogues)\ntrace the highest dark matter overdensities much better than SMGs. Even on\naverage, SMG associations are relatively poor tracers of the most significant\ndark matter overdensities because of 'downsizing': at z < ~2.5, the\nmost-massive galaxies that reside in the highest dark matter overdensities have\nalready had their star formation quenched and are thus no longer SMGs.

In this paper we discuss how a classification based on\ncanonical, non-parametric structural indices measured on resolved stellar mass\nmaps, rather than on single-band images, reduces the misclassification of\nclumpy but not merging galaxies. We calibrate the mass-based selection of\nmergers using the MIRAGE hydrodynamical numerical simulations of isolated and\nmerging galaxies which span a stellar mass range of\n$10^{9.8}$-$10^{10.6}M_{sun}$ and merger ratios between 1:1-1:6.3.

We present\nresults on the evolution of a misaligned gas disc in a cosmological simulation\nof a massive early-type galaxy from the Feedback In Realistic Environments\nproject. This galaxy experiences a merger which, together with a strong\ngalactic wind, removes most of the original gas disc. The galaxy subsequently\nreforms a gas disc through accretion of cold gas, but it is initially 120\ndegrees misaligned with the stellar rotation axis. This misalignment persists\nfor about 2 Gyr before the gas-star misalignment angle drops below 20 degrees.\nThe time it takes for the gaseous and stellar components to align is much\nlonger than previously thought, because the gas disc is accreting a significant\namount of mass for about 1.5 Gyr after the merger, during which the angular\nmomentum change induced by accreted gas dominates over that induced by stellar\ntorques.

First, the\nhypercritical accretion onto the NS companion alters both the mass and momentum\nof the binary. Second, because the explosion timescale is on par with the\norbital period, the mass ejection can not be assumed to be instantaneous. This\ndramatically affects the post-SN fate of the binary.

This uncertainty about the underlying physics has resulted\nin various different star formation laws, all having substantial intrinsic\nscatter. Extending upon previous works that define the column density of star\nformation (Sigma_SFR) by the gas column density (Sigma_gas), we develop a new\nuniversal star formation (SF) law based on the multi-freefall prescription of\ngas. This new SF law relies predominantly on the probability density function\n(PDF) and on the sonic Mach number of the turbulence in the star-forming\nclouds. By doing so we derive a relation where the star formation rate (SFR)\ncorrelates with the molecular gas mass per multi-freefall time, whereas\nprevious models had used the average, single-freefall time.

Most studies so far have focused on large\ngalaxies, but dwarfs might also experience such events, since the halo mass\nfunction is scale-free in the concordance cosmological model. Notably, because\nof their low mass, most of their interactions will be with dark satellites. In\nthis paper we follow the evolution of gas-rich disky dwarf galaxies as they\nexperience a minor merger with a dark satellite. We aim to characterize the\neffects of such an interaction on the dwarf's star formation, morphology, and\nkinematical properties. We performed a suite of carefully set-up hydrodynamical\nsimulations of dwarf galaxies that include dark matter, gas, and stars merging\nwith a satellite consisting solely of dark matter. For the host system we vary\nthe gas fraction, disk size and thickness, halo mass, and concentration, while\nwe explore different masses, concentrations, and orbits for the satellite. We\nfind that the interactions cause strong starbursts of both short and long\nduration in the dwarfs. Their star formation rates increase by factors of a few\nto 10 or more. They are strongest for systems with extended gas disks and high\ngas fractions merging with a high-concentration satellite on a planar, radial\norbit. In contrast to analogous simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, many of\nthe systems experience strong morphological changes and become spheroidal even\nin the presence of significant amounts of gas. The simulated systems compare\nremarkably well with the observational properties of a large selection of\nirregular dwarf galaxies and blue compact dwarfs.

The galaxies inhabit a\nvery broad range of environments, from cluster cores to the field. Using HST\nimages, we quantify their structure following Hoyos et al. (2012), and divide\nthem into disturbed and undisturbed. We also visually identify mergers.\nAdditionally, we provide a quantitative measure of the degree of disturbance\nfor each galaxy (\"roughness\"). The majority of elliptical and lenticular\ngalaxies have relaxed structure, showing no signs of ongoing star formation.\nStructurally-disturbed galaxies, which tend to avoid the lowest-density\nregions, have higher star-formation activity and younger stellar populations\nthan undisturbed systems. Cluster spirals with reduced/quenched star formation\nhave somewhat less disturbed morphologies than spirals with \"normal\"\nstar-formation activity, suggesting that these \"passive\" spirals have started\ntheir morphological transformation into S0s. Visually identified mergers and\ngalaxies not identified as mergers but with similar roughness have similar\nspecific star formation rates and stellar ages. The degree of enhanced star\nformation is thus linked to the degree of structural disturbance, regardless of\nwhether it is caused by major mergers or not. This suggests that merging\ngalaxies are not special in terms of their higher-than-normal star-formation\nactivity. Any physical process that produces \"roughness\", or regions of\nenhanced luminosity density, will increase the star-formation activity in a\ngalaxy with similar efficiency. An alternative explanation is that star\nformation episodes increase the galaxies' roughness similarly, regardless of\nwhether they are merger-induced or not. \n\n"}

In at least\none case where the individual DSBRs are well resolved through strong\ngravitational lensing, R_eff is consistent with the direct size measurement. We\nshow that the observed L_IR-T relation is simply due to the limited R_eff (<~ 2\nkpc). The small R_eff values also agree with the compact sizes of the DSBRs\nseen in the local universe. However, previous interferometric observations to\nresolve high-z dusty starbursting galaxies often quote much larger sizes. This\ninconsistency can be reconciled by the blending effect when considering that\nthe current interferometry might still not be of sufficient resolution. From\nR_eff we infer the lower limits to the volume densities of the star formation\nrate (\"minSFR3D\") in the DSBRs, and find that the $L_{IR}$-$T$ relation\noutlines a boundary on the (L_IR^(cd), T) plane, below which is the \"zone of\navoidance\" in terms of minSFR3D. \n\n"}

In this paper, we use the\nEAGLE simulation to study the dependence of the BTFR on the size of the\nsimulated galaxy sample. The huge number of datapoint available in the\nsimulation is indeed not available with current observations. Observational\nstudies that computed the BTFR used various (small) size samples with the only\nobligation to have galaxies spanning over a large range of masses and rotation\nrates. Accordingly, to compare observational and theoretical results, we build\na large number of various size datasets using the same criterion and derive the\nBTFR for all of them.

These types of core collapse events are postulated to explain several\nastronomical phenomena. In this work, the deflagration phase is simulated for\nthe first time using multidimensional hydrodynamics, with the aim of gaining\nnew insight into the explosive deaths of $8-10~M_\\odot$ stars and ONeWDs that\naccrete material from a binary companion star. The main aim is to determine\nwhether these events are thermonuclear or core-collapse supernova explosions,\nand hence whether NSs are formed by such phenomena. The deflagration is\nsimulated in ONe cores with three different central ignition densities. The\nintermediate density case is perhaps the most realistic, being based on recent\nnuclear physics calculations and 1D stellar models. The 3D hydrodynamic\nsimulations presented in this work begin from a centrally confined flame\nstructure using a level-set-based flame approach and are performed in $256^3$\nand $512^3$ numerical resolutions. In the simulations with intermediate and low\nignition density, the cores do not appear to collapse into NSs. Instead, almost\na solar mass of material becomes unbound from the cores, leaving bound\nremnants. These simulations represent the case in which semiconvective mixing\nduring the electron-capture phase preceding the deflagration is inefficient.\nThe masses of the bound remnants double when Coulomb corrections are included\nin the EoS, however they still do not exceed the effective Chandrasekhar mass\nand, hence, would not collapse into NSs. The simulations with the highest\nignition density ($\\log_{10}\\rho_{\\rm c}=10.3$), representing the case where\nsemiconvective mixing is very efficient, show clear signs that the core will\ncollapse into a NS. \n\n"}

The result is disk\nfragmentation. We motivate and quantify an interpretation of disk fragmentation\nas the inability to maintain gravito-turbulence due to formal secondary\ninstabilities driven by: 1) cooling, which reduces pressure support; and/or 2)\nviscosity, which reduces rotational support. We analyze the axisymmetric\ngravitational stability of viscous, non-adiabatic accretion disks with internal\nheating, external irradiation, and cooling in the shearing box approximation.\nWe consider parameterized cooling functions in 2D and 3D disks, as well as\nradiative diffusion in 3D. We show that generally there is no critical cooling\nrate/viscosity below which the disk is formally stable, although interesting\nlimits appear for unstable modes with lengthscales on the order of the disk\nthickness.

The relation can be described as gamma_tot = A f_DM + B\nfor all systems at all redshifts. The trend is set by the decreasing importance\nof gas dissipation towards lower redshifts and for more massive systems.\nEarly-type galaxies are smaller, more concentrated, have lower f_DM and steeper\ngamma_tot at high redshifts and at lower masses for a given redshift; f_DM and\ngamma_tot are good indicators for growth by \"dry\" merging.

A similar correlation exists between gamma_tot\nand the stellar mass surface density Sigma_*.

It is the earliest known galaxy\nwhere the interstellar medium (ISM) has been detected; dust emission was\ndetected with the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA). A1689-zD1 is also\nunusual among high-redshift dust emitters as it is a sub-L* galaxy and is\ntherefore a good prospect for the detection of gaseous ISM in a more typical\ngalaxy at this redshift.

We oppose this opinion\nand show that two main factors are responsible for the extremely low intensity\nof the observed stellar EBL: (1) a low mean surface brightness of galaxies,\nwhich causes a low luminosity density in the local Universe, and (2) light\nextinction due to absorption by galactic and intergalactic dust. Dust produces\na partial opacity of galaxies and of the Universe. The galactic opacity reduces\nthe intensity of light from more distant background galaxies obscured by\nforeground galaxies. The effective extinction AV for light passing through a\ngalaxy is 0.2 mag. This causes that distant background galaxies do not\ncontribute to the EBL significantly. In addition, light of distant galaxies is\ndimmed due to absorption by intergalactic dust. Even a minute intergalactic\nopacity of 1x10^(-2) mag per Gpc is high enough to produce significant effects\non the EBL. The absorbed starlight heats up the galactic and intergalactic dust\nand is further re-radiated at the IR, FIR and micro-wave spectrum. Assuming\nstatic infinite universe with no galactic and intergalactic dust, the stellar\nEBL should be as high as the surface brightness of stars. However, if dust is\nconsidered, the predicted stellar EBL is about 290 nWm^(-2)sr^(-1), which is\nonly 5 times higher than the observed value. Hence, the presence of dust has\nhigher impact on the EBL than currently assumed. In the expanding universe, the\ncalculated value of the EBL is further decreased, because the obscuration\neffect and intergalactic absorption become more pronounced at high redshifts\nwhen the matter was concentrated at smaller volume than at present. \n\n"}

This suggests a higher effective yield\nin the bulge, perhaps due to more efficient retention of supernova ejecta. The\nbulge vertical [Fe/H] gradient, at ~0.5 dex/kpc, appears to be due to a\nchanging mixture of sub-populations (near +0.3 dex and -0.3 dex and one\npossibly near -0.7 dex) with latitude.

Unfortunately, comparison with the\nthick disk near solar [Fe/H] suffers considerable confusion, due to poor\nidentification of the local thick disk.

We study how galaxy morphology changes the relation between the\ninner slope of the galaxy halo density profile, $\\alpha$, and the stellar mass,\n$M_{*}$, or rotation velocity $V_{\\rm rot}$. For this, we use the model of Del\nPopolo (2009) in combination with observed data from the Romanowsky \\& Fall\n(2012) sample of elliptical and spiral galaxies, the Local Group sample\ncompiled by McConnachie (2012), and the simulation results by Cloet-Osselaer et\nal. (2014). We find that the slope $\\alpha$ flattens monotonically, from\n$\\alpha \\simeq -1 $ at $V_{\\rm rot} \\simeq 250$ km/s, to $\\alpha \\simeq 0 $.\nAfter $V_{\\rm rot}\\simeq 25$ km/s the slope starts to steepen. The steepening\nhappens in the mass range dominated by non-rotationally supported galaxies\n(e.g., dSphs) and depends on the level of offset in the angular momentum of\nrotationally and non-rotationally dominated galaxies. The steepening is a\nconsequence of the decrease in baryons content, and angular momentum in\nspheroidal dwarf galaxies. We finally compare our result to the SPH simulations\nof Di Cintio. Our result is in qualitatively agreement with their simulations,\nwith the main difference that the inner slope $\\alpha$ at small stellar masses\n($M_* \\lesssim10^{8} M_{\\odot}$) is flatter than that in their simulations.

Here\nwe consider another possibility, where the perturbation is instead due to the\npotential of a galaxy cluster. Using $N$-body simulations we investigate the\nformation and evolution of spiral arms in a Milky Way-like galaxy orbiting a\nVirgo-like cluster. The galaxy is placed on a few orbits of different size but\nsimilar eccentricity and its evolution is followed for 10 Gyr. The tidally\ninduced, two-armed, approximately logarithmic spiral structure forms on each of\nthem during the pericenter passages. The spiral arms dissipate and wind up with\ntime, to be triggered again at the next pericenter passage. We confirm this\ntransient and recurrent nature of the arms by analyzing the time evolution of\nthe pitch angle and the arm strength. We find that the strongest arms are\nformed on the tightest orbit, however they wind up rather quickly and are\ndisturbed by another pericenter passage. The arms on the most extended orbit,\nwhich we analyze in more detail, wind up slowly and survive for the longest\ntime. Measurements of the pattern speed of the arms indicate that they are\nkinematic density waves.

Massive satellites can change the orbital barycentre of the\nhost-satellite system by tens of kiloparsecs and are cosmologically expected to\nharbor dwarf satellite galaxies of their own. Assessing the impact of these\neffects depends crucially on the orbital histories of the LMC and M33. Here, we\nrevisit the dynamics of the MW-LMC system and present the first detailed\nanalysis of the M31-M33 system utilizing high precision proper motions and\nstatistics from the dark matter-only Illustris cosmological simulation. With\nthe latest Hubble Space Telescope proper motion measurements of M31, we\nreliably constrain M33's interaction history with its host. In particular, like\nthe LMC, M33 is either on its first passage (t_{inf} < 2 Gyr ago) or if M31 is\nmassive (>=2x10^12 Msun), it is on a long period orbit of about 6 Gyr.\nCosmological analogs of the LMC and M33 identified in Illustris support this\npicture and provide further insight about their host masses. We conclude that,\ncosmologically, massive satellites like the LMC and M33 are likely completing\ntheir first orbits about their hosts. We also find that the orbital energies of\nsuch analogs prefer a MW halo mass ~1.5x10^12 Msun and an M31 halo mass\n>=1.5x10^12 Msun.

Such orbits are rare (< 1 per cent) within the 4$\\sigma$\nerror space allowed by observations. This conclusion cannot be explained by\nperturbative effects through four body encounters between the MW, M31, M33, and\nthe LMC.

In the standard picture, an EM outburst\nwill be produced when the binary \"decouples\" from the circum-binary disc and\nstarts \"squeezing\" the disc inside the secondary orbit, resulting in its quick\naccretion on to the primary black hole.

The reason is a \"second\ndecoupling\": the inner disc thickens due to tidal heating and inefficient\ncooling, effectively decoupling from the interaction of the binary.

Accurate separation of the Galactic foregrounds\ntherefore binds this quest to our understanding of the magnetized interstellar\nmedium (ISM). The two most relevant empirical results from analysis of Planck\ndata are line of sight depolarization arising from fluctuations of the Galactic\nmagnetic field orientation and alignment of filamentary dust structures with\nthe magnetic field at high Galactic latitude. Furthermore, Planck and HI\nemission data in combination indicate that most of the filamentary dust\nstructures are in the cold neutral medium.

We show that gas evolves from a non-star-forming to a\nstar-forming state on a relatively short time scale and thus the rate of this\nevolution does not limit the star formation rate. Instead, the star formation\nrate is limited because only a small fraction of star-forming gas is converted\ninto stars before star-forming regions are dispersed by feedback and dynamical\nprocesses. Thus, gas cycles into and out of star-forming state multiple times,\nwhich results in a long time scale on which galaxies convert gas into stars.\nOur model does not rely on the assumption of equilibrium and can be used to\ninterpret trends of depletion times with the properties of observed galaxies\nand the parameters of star formation and feedback recipes in simulations. In\nparticular, the model explains how feedback self-regulates the star formation\nrate in simulations and makes it insensitive to the local star formation\nefficiency. We illustrate our model using the results of an isolated\n$L_*$-sized galaxy simulation that reproduces the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt\nrelation for both molecular and atomic gas. Interestingly, the relation for\nmolecular gas is almost linear on kiloparsec scales, although a nonlinear\nrelation is adopted in simulation cells.

A major driver of steady-state plate tectonics on Earth is the\nsinking of the cold subducting plate into the underlying mantle. This sinking\nis the result of the combined effects of the thermal contraction of the\nlithosphere and of metamorphic transitions within the basaltic oceanic crust\nand lithospheric mantle. The latter of these effects is dependent on the bulk\ncomposition of the planet, e.g., the major, terrestrial planet-building\nelements Mg, Si, Fe, Ca, Al, and Na, which vary in abundance across the Galaxy.\nWe present thermodynamic phase-equilibria calculations of planetary\ndifferentiation to calculate both melt composition and mantle mineralogy, and\nshow that a planet's refractory and moderately-volatile elemental abundances\ncontrol a terrestrial planet's likelihood to produce mantle-derived,\nmelt-extracted crusts that sink.

Abstract: In this work, we compare the $\\gamma$-ray spectra available in literature\nfrom 11 middle aged supernova remnants (SNRs) interacting with molecular clouds\n(MCs). It is found that 5 remnants prefer a smoothly broken power law proton\nspectrum with similar power law index but different break energy. The rest of\nthe SNRs need updated data to test whether a spectral break is preferred in the\nproton spectrum. Then we compare the $\\gamma$-ray spectra from all 11 SNRs with\nthe prediction from widely accepted escaping scenario and direct interaction\nscenario. We show that current $\\gamma$-ray data is inconsistent with the\nescaping model statistically, as it predicts a diversity of $\\gamma$-ray\nspectra which is not detected in the observation. We also find that ambient CRs\ncan be very important for the $\\gamma$-ray emission in the MCs external to W28\nand W44, which requires further investigation. In the direct interaction\nscenario, we focus on re-acceleration of pre-existing ambient CRs. The model\ncan produce the overall profile of $\\gamma$-ray data with different\nacceleration time, but it suggests a transition of seed particles in the\nevolution of SNR. Whether such transition indeed exists has to be tested by\nfuture observation. In the end, we propose that radiative SNR without MC\ninteraction can also produce a significant amount of $\\gamma$-ray emission. One\ngood candidate is S147.

The\ncombined effect of stellar winds from hot stars and supernova explosions\ncreates a high-temperature cavity in the nuclear region of these objects. The\nvery hot gas expands adiabatically and escapes from the galaxy creating a\nsuperwind which sweeps matter from the galactic disk. The superwind region in\nthe halo is filled with a multi-phase gas with hot, warm, cool, and\nrelativistic components. The shocks associated with the superwind of starbursts\nand the turbulent gas region of the bubble inflated by them might accelerate\ncosmic rays up to high energies. In this work we calculate the cosmic ray\nproduction associated with the superwind using parameters that correspond to\nthe nearby southern starburst galaxy NGC 253, which has been suggested as a\npotential accelerator of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We evaluate the\nefficiency of both diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) and stochastic diffusive\nacceleration (SDA) in the superwind of NGC 253. We estimate the distribution of\nboth hadrons and leptons and calculate the corresponding spectral energy\ndistributions of photons.

However, after almost two\ndecades, observations of this phenomenon are still rare, and most of previous\nreports are plagued by projection effects so that loop contraction could be\neither true implosion or just a change in loop inclination. In this paper, to\ndemonstrate the reality of loop contractions in the global coronal dynamics, we\npresent four events with the continuously contracting loops in an almost\nedge-on geometry from the perspective of SDO/AIA, which are free from the\nambiguity caused by the projection effects, also supplemented by contemporary\nobservations from STEREO for examination. In the wider context of observations,\nsimulations and theories, we argue that the implosion conjecture is valid in\ninterpreting these events. Furthermore, distinct properties of the events allow\nus to identify two physical categories of implosion.

Using an analytical\nmodel and numerical simulations of the evolving spherical wall we show that the\nspherical wall experiences a repelling gravitational potential due to the mass\nof the central black hole. This potential is further amplified by the presence\nof a cosmological constant. For initial domain wall radius larger than a\ncritical value, the repulsive potential dominates over the wall tension and the\nwall expands towards the cosmological horizon of the S-dS metric where it\ndevelops ghost instabilities.

Cryogenic cooling also requires short and thick\nsuspension fibers to extract heat, which could result in the worsening of\nthermal noise.

We use novel\nanalysis methods to measure the cooling rate, the heating rate associated to\nmultiple mechanisms, and the power associated with adiabatic\ncompression/expansion. A significant reduction of the cooling rate and cooling\nflow within 20 kpc from the centre can be achieved with kinetic jets.

To explore this effect, we performed a large\nset of direct N-body simulations, with up to 512k particles and ~500 dynamical\ntimes. Contrasting our simulations with Spitzer-style Monte Carlo simulations,\nthat by design only exhibit 2-body relaxation, we show that the temporal\nbehavior of the angular momentum vectors in $N$-body simulations cannot be\nexplained by 2-body relaxation alone.

The presence of a 110 kpc long HI tail in the S\ndirection indicates that this galaxy is undergoing a ram pressure stripping\nevent. The deep narrow-band image revealed the presence of a low surface\nbrightness ionised gas tail ~10 kpc long extending from the centre of the\ngalaxy to the NW direction, in the direction opposite to the HI tail. Chandra\nand XMM X-rays data do not show any compact source in the nucleus nor the\npresence of an extended tail of hot gas, while MUSE spectroscopy indicates that\nthe gas is photo-ionised in the inner regions and shock-ionised in the outer\nparts. IFU spectroscopy confirms that the ionised gas is kinematically\ndecoupled from the stellar component and indicates the presence of two\nkinematically distinct structures in the stellar disc. The analysis of the SED\nof the galaxy indicates that the activity of star formation has been totally\nquenched in the outer disc ~ 250-280 Myr ago, while only reduced by ~80% in the\ncentral regions. All this observational evidence suggests that NGC 4424 is the\nremnant of an unequal-mass merger occurred <= 500 Myr ago, when the galaxy was\nalready a member of the Virgo cluster, now undergoing a ram pressure stripping\nevent which has removed the gas and quenched the activity of star formation in\nthe outer disc. The tail of ionised gas probably results from the outflow\nproduced by a central starburst fed by the collapse of gas induced by the\nmerging episode. This outflow is sufficiently powerful to overcome the ram\npressure induced by the intracluster medium on the disc of the galaxy crossing\nthe cluster. This analysis thus suggests that feedback can participate in the\nquenching process of galaxies in high-density regions. \n\n"}

A second order effect in the fluid\nequations was recently found to make a significant contribution: an offset\nvelocity between gas and dark matter, the so-called streaming velocity.\nPrevious simulations of a limited number of low-mass dark matter haloes suggest\nthat this streaming velocity can delay the formation of the first stars and\ndecrease halo gas fractions and the halo mass function in the low mass regime.\nHowever, a systematic exploration of its effects in a large sample of haloes\nhas been lacking until now. In this paper, we present results from a set of\ncosmological simulations of regions of the Universe with different streaming\nvelocities performed with the moving mesh code AREPO. Our simulations have very\nhigh mass resolution, enabling us to accurately resolve minihaloes as small as\n$10^5 \\: {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$. We show that in the absence of streaming, the least\nmassive halo that contains cold gas has a mass $M_{\\rm halo, min} = 5 \\times\n10^{5} \\: {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$, but that cooling only becomes efficient in a\nmajority of haloes for halo masses greater than $M_{\\rm halo,50\\%} = 1.6 \\times\n10^6 \\: {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$.

It is argued that the near conservation of energy implies that l\nvaries regularly for wave equations in Robertson-Walker spacetime, whereas for\ndensity perturbations l cannot vary regularly.

These data reveal an unusual foreground component of galaxies separated\nfrom the main cluster by 3000 km/s. We use numerical simulations to show that a\nhigh speed collision along the line of sight between Cl0024+1654 and a second\ncluster of slightly smaller mass can reproduce the observed peculiar redshift\ndistribution. The collision dramatically alters the internal mass distribution\nof the bound remnants, creating constant density cores from initially cuspy\ndark matter profiles and scattering galaxies to large projected radii. Our\nresults can reconcile the inferred mass profile from gravitational lensing with\npredictions from hierarchical structure formation models, while at the same\ntime resolving the mass discrepancy that results from a comparison between\nlensing, velocity dispersion and X-ray studies. \n\n"}

Despite these\ndifficulties, we have recently made the first detections of radio and sub-mm\nemission from the host galaxies of GRB980703 and GRB010222, respectively, using\nthe VLA and the SCUBA instrument on JCMT. In both cases we find that the\ninferred star formation rates (~500 solar masses per year) and bolometric\nluminosities (~few 10^12 solar luminosities) indicate that these galaxies are\npossibly analogous to the local population of Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies\n(ULIRGs) undergoing a starburst. However, there is a modest probability that\nthe observed emission is due to AGN activity rather than star formation, thus\nrequiring observations with Chandra or XMM. The sample of GRB hosts offers a\nnumber of unique advantages to the broader question of the evolution of\ngalaxies and star formation from high redshift to the present time since: (i)\nGRBs trace massive stars, (ii) are detectable to high redshifts, and (iii) have\nimmense dust penetrating power. Therefore, radio/sub-mm/X-ray observations of\nGRB hosts can potentially provide crucial information both on the nature of the\nGRB host galaxies, and on the history of star formation. \n\n"}

Calibrating the models on galactic globular\nclusters, we show that any population synthesis model being based on stellar\nlibraries of the Milky Way is intrinsically biased towards super-solar alpha/Fe\nratios at metallicities below solar. We correct for this bias, so that the\nmodels presented here reflect constant alpha/Fe ratios at all metallicities.\nThe use of such unbiased models is essential for studies of stellar systems\nwith sub-solar metallicities like (extragalactic) globular clusters or dwarf\ngalaxies.\n  For the galaxy sample investigated here, we find a clear correlation between\nalpha/Fe and velocity dispersion. Zero-point, slope, and scatter of this\ncorrelation turn out to be independent of the environment. Additionally, the\nalpha/Fe ratios and mean ages of elliptical galaxies are well correlated, i.e.\ngalaxies with high alpha/Fe ratios have also high average ages. This strongly\nreinforces the view that the alpha/Fe element enhancement in ellipticals is\nproduced by short star formation timescales rather than by a flattening of the\ninitial mass function. The more massive the galaxy, the shorter is its star\nformation timescale, and the higher is the redshift of the bulk of star\nformation, independent of the environmental density.

The disk\ngalaxies are deficient in angular momentum by only about a factor of two\ncompared to observations for runs where fairly strong star-bursts in early,\nproto-galactic clouds lead to \"blow-away\" of the remaining gas.

Our\nsample contains 59 oscillations from six sources observed with the Rossi X-ray\nTiming Explorer. The oscillations that we examined occurred primarily during\nthe decaying portions of bursts, and lasted for several seconds each. We find\nthat the oscillations are as large as 15% during the declines of the bursts,\nand they appear and disappear due to intrinsic variations in their fractional\namplitudes. However, the maxima in the amplitudes are not related to the\nunderlying flux in the burst. We derive folded profiles for each oscillation\ntrain to study the pulse morphologies. The mean rms amplitudes of the\noscillations are 5%, although the eclipsing source MXB 1659-298 routinely\nproduces 10% oscillations in weak bursts. We also produce combined profiles\nfrom all of the oscillations from each source.

Abstract: Low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) are a very important class of sources since they\noccupy a significant fraction of local galaxies. Their spectra differ\nsignificantly from the canonical luminous AGNs, most notably by the absence of\nthe ``big blue bump''. In the present paper, taking a typical\nLLAGN--NGC4258--as an example, we investigate the origin of their spectral\nemission. The observational data of NGC4258 is extremely abundant, including\nwater maser emission, putting very strict constraints to its theoretical\nmodels. The infrared (IR) spectrum is well described by a steep power-law form\n$f_{\\nu}\\propto \\nu^{-1.4}$, and may extend to the optical/UV band. Up until\nnow there is no model which can explain such a steep spectrum, and we here\npropose a coupled jet plus accretion disk model for NGC4258. The accretion disk\nis composed of an inner ADAF (or radiatively inefficient accretion flow) and an\nouter standard thin disk. A shock occurs when the accretion flow is ejected out\nof the ADAF to form the jet near the black hole, accelerating the electrons\ninto a power-law energy distribution. The synchrotron and self-Comptonized\nemission from these electrons greatly dominates over the underlying accretion\ndisk and can well explain the spectrum ranging from IR to X-ray bands. The\nfurther propagation of the shocked gas in the jet can explain the flat radio\nspectrum of NGC4258. Several predictions of our model are presented for testing\nagainst future observations, and we briefly discuss the application of the\nmodel to other LLAGNs. \n\n"}

In the flat case, the topology scale is arbitrary,\nand there is no a priori reason for this scale to be of the same order as the\nsize of the observable universe. In the hyperbolic case any nontrivial topology\nwould almost surely be on a length scale too large to detect. In the spherical\ncase, by contrast, the topology could easily occur on a detectable scale. The\npresent paper shows how, in the spherical case, the assumption of a nearly flat\nuniverse simplifies the algorithms for detecting a multiply connected topology,\nbut also reduces the amount of topology that can be seen. This is of primary\nimportance for the upcoming cosmic microwave background data analysis.\n  This article shows that for spherical spaces one may restrict the search to\ndiametrically opposite pairs of circles in the circles-in-the-sky method and\nstill detect the cyclic factor in the standard factorization of the holonomy\ngroup. This vastly decreases the algorithm's run time. If the search is widened\nto include pairs of candidate circles whose centers are almost opposite and\nwhose relative twist varies slightly, then the cyclic factor along with a\ncyclic subgroup of the general factor may also be detected. Unfortunately the\nfull holonomy group is, in general, unobservable in a nearly flat spherical\nuniverse, and so a full 6-parameter search is unnecessary.

The Penrose scattered escaping relativistic particles exhibit\ntightly wound coil-like cone distributions (highly collimated vortical jet\ndistributions) about the polar axis, with helical polar angles of escape\nvarying from 0.5-30 deg for the highest energy particles. The gravitomagnetic\nfield exerts a force acting on the momentum vectors of the incident and\nscattered particles, causing asymmetrical particle jet emission above and below\nthe equatorial plane. When the accretion disk is assumed to be an ADAF,\nenergies as high as 54 GeV can be attained by these Penrose processes alone;\nand when relativistic beaming is included, energies in the TeV range can be\nachieved, agreeing with observations of some BL Lac objects.

In this paper, we study the splitting into adiabatic\nand isocurvature perturbations for a model with two scalar fields, one of which\nhas a non-standard kinetic term in the Einstein-frame action.

For\nexample, merging binary neutron stars can form \"hypermassive\" remnants\nsupported against collapse by differential rotation.

We focus on the accretion rate distribution p(mdot|M,z), the\nprobability that a black hole of mass M at redshift z accretes at a rate mdot\nin Eddington units. Given the radiative efficiency as a function of mdot, the\nquasar luminosity function (QLF) is determined by a convolution of p(mdot|M,z)\nwith the black hole mass function n(M,z). In the absence of mergers p(mdot|M,z)\nalso determines the full evolution of n(M,z), given a \"boundary value\" of n(M)\nat some redshift. Matching the observed decline of the QLF break luminosity at\nz<2 requires either a shift towards lower characteristic accretion rates or an\nevolving mass dependence of p(mdot) that preferentially shuts off accretion\nonto high mass black holes. These two scenarios make different predictions for\nthe masses and accretion rates of active black holes.

In spite of these uncertainties, the CIV, MgII, and\nHbeta emission lines consistently indicate super-massive black hole masses of\nseveral times 10^9 M_sun at redshifts up to z = 5.1.

We show that these\ndata are incompatible with the assumed masses of X2127+119's component stars.\nThe continuum eclipse is too shallow, indicating that much of the accretion\ndisc remains visible during eclipse, and therefore that the size of the donor\nstar relative to the disc is much smaller in this high-inclination system than\nthe assumed mass-ratio allows.

The\ngalaxy and halo mass dependence leads to redshift and environment dependence of\ncold and hot accretion rates, with cold mode dominating at high redshift and in\nlow density regions today, and hot mode dominating in group and cluster\nenvironments at low redshift.

Instead the Crab-nebula synchrotron-radiation analyses, whose\npreliminary sensitivity estimates raised high hopes, actually do not lead to\nany bound on the parameters of the two ``minimal'' test theories. The\nCrab-nebula synchrotron-radiation analyses do however constrain some possible\ngeneralizations of one of the minimal test theories. As an example of\nforthcoming data which could provide extremely stringent (beyond-Planckian)\nlimits on the two minimal test theories I consider the possibility of studies\nof the GZK cutoff for cosmic-rays. \n\n"}

At z=1 most luminous galaxies have\nmorphologies of early-to-mid Hubble-types, and many show transformations\nbetween their rest-frame UV-optical morphologies.

The mean galaxy size grows from z=2.3 to 1 by 40%, and the density\nof galaxies larger than 3 kpc increases by 7 times. At z=1, the size-luminosity\ndistribution is broadly consistent with that of local galaxies, with passive\nevolution. However, galaxies at z=2.3 are smaller than the large present-day\ngalaxies, and must continue to grow in size and stellar mass. We have measured\nthe galaxies' UV-optical ICD, which quantifies differences in morphology and\nthe relative amount of on-going star-formation. The mean and scatter in\ngalaxies' total colors and ICD increase from z=2.3 to 1. At z=1 many galaxies\nwith large ICD are spirals, with a few irregular systems.

In each galaxy we find evidence for an extraplanar\nstellar component extending up to 15 scale heights (3.5 kpc) above the plane.\nWe analyze the vertical distribution as a function of stellar age by tracking\nchanges in the color-magnitude diagram. The young stellar component (<10^8 yrs)\nis found to have a scale height larger than the young component in the Milky\nWay, suggesting that stars in these low mass galaxies form in a thicker disk.\nWe also find that the scale height of a stellar population increases with age,\nwith young main sequence stars, intermediate age asymptotic giant branch stars,\nand old red giant branch stars having succesively larger scale heights in each\ngalaxy. This systematic trend indicates that disk heating must play some role\nin producing the extraplanar stars. We constrain the rate of disk heating using\nthe observed trend between scale height and stellar age, and find that the\nobserved heating rates are dramatically smaller than in the Milky Way. The\ncolor distributions of the red giant branch stars well above the midplane\nindicate that the extended stellar components we see are moderately metal-poor,\nwith peak metallicities around [Fe/H]=-1 and with little or no metallicity\ngradient with height. The lack of metallicity gradient can be explained if a\nmajority of extraplanar RGB stars were formed at early times and are not\ndominated by a younger heated population.

The X-ray spectrum consistently shows two distinct\ncomponents, a hard power law and a soft blackbody with kT_BB ~ 0.18 keV.

The properties of the burst\noscillations reflect the nature of the thermal asymmetry on the stellar\nsurface. We present an analysis of the variability of the burst oscillations of\nthis source, focusing on three characteristics: fractional amplitude, harmonic\ncontent and frequency. Fractional amplitude and harmonic content constrain the\nsize, shape and position of the emitting region, whilst variations in frequency\nindicate motion of the emitting region on the neutron star surface. We examine\nboth long-term variability over the course of the outburst, and short-term\nvariability during the bursts. For most of the bursts, fractional amplitude is\nconsistent with that of the accretion pulsations, implying a low degree of fuel\nspread. There is however a population of bursts whose fractional amplitudes are\nsubstantially lower, implying a higher degree of fuel spread, possibly forced\nby the explosive burning front of a precursor burst. For the first harmonic,\nsubstantial differences between the burst and accretion pulsations suggest that\nhotspot geometry is not the only mechanism giving rise to harmonic content in\nthe latter.

The thick disks have larger scale heights and longer scale lengths than\nthe embedded thin disks, by factors of ~2 and ~1.25, respectively. The observed\nstructural parameters agree well with the properties of thick and thin disks\nderived from star counts in the Milky Way and from resolved stellar populations\nin nearby galaxies. We find that massive galaxies' luminosities are dominated\nby the thin disk. However, in low mass galaxies (Vc < 120 km/s), thick disk\nstars contribute nearly half of the luminosity and dominate the stellar mass.\nThus, although low mass dwarf galaxies appear blue, the majority of their stars\nare probably quite old.\n  Our data are most easily explained by a formation scenario where the thick\ndisk is assembled through direct accretion of stellar material from merging\nsatellites while the thin disk is formed from accreted gas. The baryonic\nfraction in the thin disk therefore constrains the gas-richness of the merging\npre-galactic fragments. If we include the mass in HI as part of the thin disk,\nthe thick disk contains <10% of the baryons in high mass galaxies, and ~25-30%\nof the baryons in low-mass galaxies.

It contrasts with the behaviour of the less massive young\nclusters and of globular clusters, which do not exhibit any mass-radius\nrelation. However, the behaviour of the most massive clusters is similar to\nthat of most other objects in that mass regime (10^6-10^8 Mo).\n  We show that the properties of young massive clusters are compatible with\nother objects in the same mass regime such as DGTOs/UCDs.

We here perform three-dimensional numerical simulations\nof the expansion of an H II region into self-gravitating, radiatively cooled\ngas, both with and without supersonic turbulent flows.

I\nreview implementations of the excursion set approach with arbitrary barrier\nshapes. An application of this is the now well-known improvement to standard\nEST that follows from the ellipsoidal-collapse barrier. Additionally, I\nemphasize that the statement that halo accretion histories are independent of\nhalo environments is a simplifying assumption, rather than a prediction of the\ntheory. I review the method for constructing correlated random walks of the\ndensity field in more general cases. I construct a simple toy model with\ncorrelated walks and I show that excursion set theory makes a qualitatively\nsimple and general prediction for the relation between halo accretion histories\nand halo environments: regions of high density preferentially contain\nlate-forming halos and conversely for regions of low density. I conclude with a\nbrief discussion of this prediction in the context of recent numerical studies\nof the environmental dependence of halo properties. (Abridged) \n\n"}

The core\nregions of these clusters ontain only a small proportion of star-forming\ngalaxies, and they therefore do not exhibit a `Butcher-Oemler' effect. Focusing\non the redder cluster galaxies we find that their integrated luminosity is well\ncorrelated with the cluster X-ray temperatures, and hence with cluster mass.\nFurthermore, the typical UV-optical colours of the elliptical sequences in the\nclusters exhibit a small cluster-to-cluster scatter, <=2%, indicating that\nthese galaxies are highly homogeneous between clusters.

Rotation\ncurve shape is a strong function of galaxy surface brightness: low-surface\nbrightness galaxies (LSBs) have slowly rising rotation curves while in\nhigh-surface brightness systems the rotation speed rises sharply and stays flat\nor even declines beyond the optical radius. These observations are consistent\nwith NFW halo profiles, with the possible exception of a few LSBs where the\nrotation curves are better described by shallower central density profiles.\nConsistency with observational trends requires that halos have lower\ncharacteristic densities than expected in the standard biased cold dark matter\n(CDM) scenario, but roughly compatible with COBE-normalized, low-density, flat\nCDM universes. The data also imply that disk mass-to-light ratios increase\ngently with luminosity, and that the halo circular velocity, V_200, is not\ndirectly proportional to the disk rotation speed, V_rot. Slowly rotating disks\nare surrounded by halos of higher circular velocities, whereas faster rotators\n(V_rot > 150 km/s) are all surrounded by halos of similar mass, corresponding\nto V_200 ~ 200 km/s. We speculate that this is because the efficiency of\nassembly of baryons into galaxies is high in massive halos, leading to disks\ntoo massive to be stable in systems that exceed the ``critical'' V_200 ~ 200\nkm/s.

Images of\nfaint galaxies are subject to gravitational shearing followed by smearing with\nthe instrumental and/or atmospheric PSF. We construct a `finite resolution\nshear operator' which when applied to an observed image has the same effect as\na gravitational shear applied prior to smearing. This operator allows one to\ncalibrate essentially any shear estimator. We then specialize to the case of\nweighted second moment shear estimators. We compute the shear polarizability\nwhich gives the response of an individual galaxy's polarization to a\ngravitational shear. We then compute the response of the population of\ngalaxies, and thereby construct an optimal weighting scheme for combining shear\nestimates from galaxies of various shapes, luminosities and sizes.

We are specifically interested in\ninvestigating whether a high pressure IGM, such as that in clusters of\ngalaxies, can prevent the gas from escaping from the galaxy. The interface\nbetween the outflow and ambient IGM is demarcated by a dense expanding shell\nformed by the gas swept-up by the outflow. A sufficiently high IGM pressure can\nbring the shell to a halt well before it escapes the galaxy. Galaxies in such\nhigh pressure environments are, however, to be ploughing through the IGM at\nrelatively high velocities. Hence, they will also be subject to ram pressure,\nwhich acts to strip the gas from the galaxy. We have carried out simulations\nthat take into account the combined impact of ram pressure and thermal\npressure. We find that ram pressure deforms the shell into a tail-like\nstructure, fragments it into dense clouds and eventually drags the clouds away\nfrom the galaxy. The clouds are potential sites of star formation and if viewed\nduring this transient phase, the galaxy will appear to have a low-surface\nbrightness tail much like the galaxies with diffuse comet-like tail seen in\nz=1.15 cluster 3C324.

We name the range of the ultralow energy modes (of very short\ndistances) that have frequencies equal or less than the current Hubble rate\n$H_0$ as the $\\it{tail}$ modes. These modes are still frozen today due to the\nexpansion of the universe. We calculate their energy today and show that the\n$tail$ provides a strong candidate for the {\\it dark energy} of the universe.\nDuring inflation, their energy is about 122-123 orders of magnitude smaller\nthan the total energy. We present the exact solutions and show that: the CMBR\nspectrum is that of a (nearly) black body, and that the adiabatic vacuum is the\nonly choice for the initial conditions. Finally, some of these results can also\nbe applied to black hole physics. \n\n"}

The presence of\na fundamental scale suggests that local Lorentz invariance may be violated at\nsufficiently high energies. Motivated by this possibility, recently, different\nmodels that violate Lorentz invariance locally have been used to evaluate the\ntrans-Planckian corrections to the inflationary density perturbation spectrum.\nHowever, certain astrophysical observations seem to indicate that local Lorentz\ninvariance may be preserved to extremely high energies. In such a situation, to\nstudy the trans-Planckian effects, it becomes imperative to consider models\nthat preserve local Lorentz invariance even as they contain a fundamental\nscale.

However, in this case the effective potential is too\nflat (mass gravexcitons is very small) to provide necessary constancy of the\neffective fundamental \"constants\". \n\n"}

We\ndiscuss the consistency of two recently proposed models that violate the NEC.\nThe ghost condensate model requires higher-order derivative terms in the\naction. It leads to a heavy ghost field and unbounded energy. We estimate the\nrates of particles decay and discuss possible mass limitations to protect\nstability of matter in the ghost condensate model. The nonlocal stringy model\nthat arises from a cubic string field theory and exhibits a phantom behavior\nalso leads to unbounded energy. In this case the spectrum of energy is\ncontinuous and there are no particle like excitations. This model admits a\nnatural UV completion since it comes from superstring theory. \n\n"}

The massive four-dimensional\ndouble-bound states (Bogomolny states) are shown to form a light-like\nrepresentation of ten-dimensional supersymmetry. The single-bound states form a\nmassive representation (centrino multiplet) of a four-dimensional\nsupersymmetry. The first component of the centrino multiplet is identified with\nextreme black holes with regular horizon which have one quarter of unbroken\nsupersymmetry. The centrino multiplet includes a massive spin 3/2 state, the\ncentrino, as a highest spin state.\n  Existence of massive black hole supermultiplets may affect the massless\nsector of the theory. Assuming that gluino condensate is formed one can study\nits properties. The bilinear combination of covariantly constant Killing\nspinors supplies the possible form for a gluino condensate. The condensate has\nnull properties, does not introduce a cosmological constant, and may lead to a\nspontaneous breaking of local supersymmetry. This suggests that centrino may\nprovide a consistent super-Higgs mechanism. \n\n"}
