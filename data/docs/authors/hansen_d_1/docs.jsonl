Here r is the tensor-to-scalar ratio,\nconstrained by cosmic-microwave-background (CMB) experiments; and Omega_gw(f)\nis the energy spectrum of primordial gravitational-waves, constrained e.g. by\npulsar-timing measurements, laser-interferometer experiments, and Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis (BBN). Differentiating the master equation yields a new\nexpression for the tilt d(ln Omega_gw(f))/d(ln f). The relationship between r\nand Omega_gw(f) depends sensitively on the uncertain physics of the early\nuniverse, and we show that this uncertainty may be encapsulated (in a\nmodel-independent way) by two quantities: w_hat(f) and nt_hat(f), where\nnt_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over nt(k) (the primordial tensor\nspectral index); and w_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over w_tilde(a)\n(the effective equation-of-state in the early universe, after horizon\nre-entry). Here the effective equation-of-state parameter w_tilde(a) is a\ncombination of the ordinary equation-of-state parameter w(a) and the bulk\nviscosity zeta(a). Thus, by comparing constraints on r and Omega_gw(f), one can\nobtain (remarkably tight) constraints in the [w_hat(f), nt_hat(f)] plane.

A few representative scenarios are considered, that\ninclude CP conservation and explicit CP violation in the Higgs sector. The\nexperimental results encompass the searches for neutral Higgs bosons at LEP1\nand LEP2 in final states as expected in the MSSM, as well as LEP2 searches for\ncharged Higgs bosons and for neutral Higgs bosons decaying into hadrons\nindependent of the quark flavour. The data reveal no significant excess with\nrespect to background expectations. The results are translated into excluded\nregions of the parameter space in the various scenarios.

We examine this\nissue in detail here in two different ways: (1) first we explore the effect of\nchoice of different parameter priors on the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar\nratio r and other parameters describing inflation, and (2) we examine the\nBayesian complexity in order to determine how effectively existing data can\nconstrain inflationary parameters.

This metric is used to compute quantities along an approximate\neffective lightcone of the averaged model of the Universe. As opposed to the\nstandard Friedmann model, we parameterize this template metric by exact scaling\nproperties of an averaged inhomogeneous cosmology, and we also motivate this\nform of the metric by results on a geometrical smoothing of inhomogeneous\ncosmological hypersurfaces.

Moreover,\nthe model uses a reduced nucleon-to-Delta resonance axial coupling, which leads\nto coherent pion production cross sections around a factor two smaller than\nmost of the previous theoretical estimates. In the coherent production, the\nmain nuclear effects, namely medium corrections on the Delta propagator and the\nfinal pion distortion, are included. We have improved on previous similar\nmodels by taking into account the nucleon motion and employing a more\nsophisticated optical potential.

{"id": "0904.4501", "contents": "Title: Extreme- and Intermediate-Mass Ratio Inspirals in Dynamical Chern-Simons\n  Modified Gravity Abstract: [abridged] Chern-Simons (CS) modified gravity is a 4D effective theory that\ndescends both from string theory and loop quantum gravity, and that corrects\nthe Einstein-Hilbert action by adding the product of a scalar field and the\nparity-violating, Pontryagin density. In this theory, the gravitational field\nof spinning black holes is described by a modified Kerr geometry whose\nmultipole moments deviate from the Kerr ones only at the fourth multipole, l =\n4. We investigate possible signatures of this theory in the gravitational wave\nemission produced in the inspiral of stellar compact objects into massive black\nholes, both for intermediate- and extreme-mass ratios. We use the\nsemi-relativistic approximation, where the trajectories are geodesics of the\nmassive black hole geometry and the gravitational waveforms are obtained from a\nmultipolar decomposition of the radiative field. The main CS corrections to the\nwaveforms arise from modifications to the geodesic trajectories, due to changes\nto the massive black hole geometry, and manifest themselves as an accumulating\ndephasing relative to the general relativistic case. We also explore the\npropagation and the stress-energy tensor of gravitational waves in this theory.\nWe find that, although this tensor has the same form as in General Relativity,\nthe energy and angular momentum balance laws are indeed modified through the\nstress-energy tensor of the CS scalar field. These balance laws could be used\nto describe the inspiral through adiabatic changes in the orbital parameters,\nwhich in turn would enhance the dephasing effect. Gravitational-wave\nobservations of intermediate- or extreme-mass ratio inspirals with advanced\nground detectors or with LISA could use such dephasing to test the dynamical\ntheory to unprecedented levels. \n\n"}

Why is the spacetime on large scales modeled to a good approximation by\nthe Friedmann equations? Are we sure that small-scale non-linearities do not\ninduce a large backreaction? Related to this, what is the effective theory that\ndescribes the universe on large scales? In this paper we make progress in\naddressing these questions. We show that the effective theory for the\nlong-wavelength universe behaves as a viscous fluid coupled to gravity:\nintegrating out short-wavelength perturbations renormalizes the homogeneous\nbackground and introduces dissipative dynamics into the evolution of\nlong-wavelength perturbations. The effective fluid has small perturbations and\nis characterized by a few parameters like an equation of state, a sound speed\nand a viscosity parameter. These parameters can be matched to numerical\nsimulations or fitted from observations. We find that the backreaction of\nsmall-scale non-linearities is very small, being suppressed by the large\nhierarchy between the scale of non-linearities and the horizon scale. The\neffective pressure of the fluid is always positive and much too small to\nsignificantly affect the background evolution. Moreover, we prove that\nvirialized scales decouple completely from the large-scale dynamics, at all\norders in the post-Newtonian expansion. We propose that our effective theory be\nused to formulate a well-defined and controlled alternative to conventional\nperturbation theory, and we discuss possible observational applications.\nFinally, our way of reformulating results in second-order perturbation theory\nin terms of a long-wavelength effective fluid provides the opportunity to\nunderstand non-linear effects in a simple and physically intuitive way. \n\n"}

Moreover, we also consider the\ncollision of a particle orbiting the ISCO with another particle on the ISCO and\nfind that the maximum CM energy is then given by $E_{\\rm cm}/(2m_{0})\\simeq\n1.77/\\sqrt[6]{1-a_{*}^{2}}$. In view of the astrophysical significance of the\nISCO, this result implies that particles can collide around a rotating black\nhole with an arbitrarily high CM energy without any artificial fine-tuning in\nan astrophysical context if we can take the maximal limit of the black hole\nspin or $a_{*}\\to 1$. On the other hand, even if we take Thorne's bound on the\nspin parameter into account, highly or moderately relativistic collisions are\nexpected to occur quite naturally, for $E_{\\rm cm}/(2m_{0})$ takes 6.95\n(maximum) and 3.86 (generic) near the horizon and 4.11 (maximum) and 2.43\n(generic) on the ISCO for $a_{*}=0.998$. This implies that high-velocity\ncollisions of compact objects are naturally expected around a rapidly rotating\nsupermassive black hole. Implications to accretion flows onto a rapidly\nrotating black hole are also discussed. \n\n"}

{"id": "1011.4127", "contents": "Title: Can accretion disk properties observationally distinguish black holes\n  from naked singularities? Abstract: Naked singularities are hypothetical astrophysical objects, characterized by\na gravitational singularity without an event horizon. Penrose has proposed a\nconjecture, according to which there exists a cosmic censor who forbids the\noccurrence of naked singularities. Distinguishing between astrophysical black\nholes and naked singularities is a major challenge for present day\nobservational astronomy. A possibility of differentiating naked singularities\nfrom black holes is through the comparative study of thin accretion disks\nproperties around rotating naked singularities and Kerr-type black holes,\nrespectively. In the present paper, we consider accretion disks around rotating\nnaked singularities, obtained as solutions of the field equations in the\nEinstein-massless scalar field theory. A first major difference between\nrotating naked singularities and Kerr black holes is in the frame dragging\neffect, the angular velocity of a rotating naked singularity being inversely\nproportional to its spin parameter. Due to the differences in the exterior\ngeometry, the thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of the disks are\ndifferent for these two classes of compact objects, consequently giving clear\nobservational signatures that could discriminate between black holes and naked\nsingularities. For specific values of the spin parameter and of the scalar\ncharge, the energy flux from the disk around a rotating naked singularity can\nexceed by several orders of magnitude the flux from the disk of a Kerr black\nhole. The conversion efficiency of the accreting mass into radiation by\nrotating naked singularities is always higher than the conversion efficiency\nfor black holes. Thus, these observational signatures may provide the necessary\ntools from clearly distinguishing rotating naked singularities from Kerr-type\nblack holes. \n\n"}

By treating the inter-cluster potential, in addition\nto the interactions, as a perturbation, it is shown that the CPT can be\nreformulated as an all-order re-summation of diagrams within standard\nweak-coupling perturbation theory where vertex corrections are neglected. This\nreformulation is shown to allow for a straightforward generalization of the CPT\nto the general non-equilibrium case using contour-ordered Green's functions.\nSolving the resulting generalized CPT equation on the discretized\nKeldysh-Matsubara time contour, the transient dynamics of an essentially\narbitrary initial pure or mixed state can be traced. In this way, the\ntime-dependent expectation values of one-particle observables can be obtained\nwithin an approximation that neglects spatial correlations beyond the extension\nof the reference cluster. The necessary computational effort is very moderate.\nA detailed discussion and simple test calculations are presented to demonstrate\nthe strengths and the shortcomings of the proposed approach. The\nnon-equilibrium CPT is systematic and is controlled in principle by the inverse\ncluster size. It interpolates between the non-interacting and the atomic or\ndecoupled-cluster limit which are recovered exactly and is found to predict the\ncorrect dynamics at very short times in a general non-trivial case. The effects\nof initial-state correlations on the subsequent dynamics and the necessity to\nextend the Keldysh contour by the imaginary Matsubara branch are analyzed\ncarefully and demonstrated numerically.

This includes epsilon_K, Delta M_K, Delta M_q, A_{SL}^q, Delta\nGamma_q with q=d,s and the CP asymmetries S_{psi K_S} and S_{psi phi}.

In this paper we\ninvestigate the conditions under which $\\gamma$ will have physical effects in\nEuclidean Quantum Gravity. This is done by constructing a well-defined\nEuclidean path integral for the Holst action with non-zero cosmological\nconstant on a manifold with boundary. We find that two general conditions must\nbe satisfied by the spacetime manifold in order for the Holst action and its\nsurface integral to be non-zero: (i) the metric has to be non-diagonalizable;\n(ii) the Pontryagin number of the manifold has to be non-zero.

These are the constrained MSSM (CMSSM), non-universal\nHiggs masses models (NUHM1, NUHM2), non-universal gaugino masses model (NUGM)\nand GUT related gaugino masses models (NUGMd). Two definitions of the fine\ntuning are used, the first (Delta_{max}) measures maximal fine-tuning wrt\nindividual parameters while the second (Delta_q) adds their contribution in\n\"quadrature\". As a direct result of two theoretical constraints (the EW minimum\nconditions), fine tuning (Delta_q) emerges as a suppressing factor (effective\nprior) of the averaged likelihood (under the priors), under the integral of the\nglobal probability of measuring the data (Bayesian evidence p(D)). For each\nmodel, there is little difference between Delta_q, Delta_{max} in the region\nallowed by the data, with similar behaviour as functions of the Higgs, gluino,\nstop mass or SUSY scale (m_{susy}=(m_{\\tilde t_1} m_{\\tilde t_2})^{1/2}) or\ndark matter and g-2 constraints. The analysis has the advantage that by\nreplacing any of these mass scales or constraints by their latest bounds one\neasily infers for each model the value of Delta_q, Delta_{max} or vice versa.\nFor all models, minimal fine tuning is achieved for M_{higgs} near 115 GeV with\na Delta_q\\approx Delta_{max}\\approx 10 to 100 depending on the model, and in\nthe CMSSM this is actually a global minimum. Due to a strong ($\\approx$\nexponential) dependence of Delta on M_{higgs}, for a Higgs mass near 125 GeV,\nthe above values of Delta_q\\approx Delta_{max} increase to between 500 and\n1000. Possible corrections to these values are briefly discussed. \n\n"}

This volume can be defined in\nvarious equivalent ways. For example, it can be given as $\\mathrm d \\mathcal\nV(\\mu) / \\mathrm d \\mu$, where $v^\\alpha \\partial_\\alpha = \\mathrm d / \\mathrm\nd \\mu$, and $\\mu$ is a parameter distance along the integral curve of $v$.\nEquivalently, it can be defined as $\\int v^\\alpha \\mathrm d \\Sigma_\\alpha$,\nwhere $\\mathrm d \\Sigma_\\alpha$ is the directed surface element. We find that\nthis volume is especially useful for the description of black holes, but it can\nbe used in other contexts as well. Moreover, this volume has several properties\nof interest. Among these is the fact that the vector volume is linear with\nrespect to the the choice of vector $v^\\alpha$. As a result, for example, in\nstationary axially symmetric spacetimes with timelike Killing vectors\n$t^\\alpha$ and axial symmetric Killing vectors $\\phi^\\alpha$, the vector volume\nof an axially symmetric region with respect to the vector $t^\\alpha + \\Omega\n\\phi^\\alpha$ is equal for any value of $\\Omega$, a consequence of the\nadditional result that $\\phi^\\alpha$ does not contribute to $\\mathcal{V}_v$.\nPerhaps of most interest is the fact that in Kerr-Schild spacetimes the volume\nelement for the full spacetime is equal to that of the background spacetime.

Rather the emission domain lies just outside a\ntimelike Marginal Outer Trapped Surface that is locally defined. The emission\ndomain is mainly located inside the event horizon. A spacelike singularity\nforms behind the event horizon, and most of the Hawking radiation ends up at\nthis singularity rather than at infinity. Whether any Hawking radiation reaches\ninfinity depends on the relation between the emission domain and the event\nhorizon.

It is TeV-scale dark\nmatter, however, that remains viable for many models of supersymmetry. In this\npaper, we study the reach of a 100 TeV proton-proton collider for neutralino\ndark matter and compare to 14 TeV LHC projections. We employ a supersymmetric\nsimplified model approach and present reach estimates from monojet searches,\nsoft lepton searches, and disappearing track searches. The searches are applied\nto pure neutralino spectra, compressed neutralino spectra, and coannihilating\nspectra. We find a factor of 4-5 improvement in mass reach in going from 14 TeV\nto 100 TeV. More specifically, we find that given a 1% systematic uncertainty,\na 100 TeV collider could exclude winos up to 1.4 TeV and higgsinos up to 850\nGeV in the monojet channel. Coannihilation scenarios with gluinos can be\nexcluded with neutralino masses of 6.2 TeV, with stops at 2.8 TeV, and with\nsquarks at 4.0 TeV.

In the superfluid\nstate, the fermionic two-particle vertex develops rich and singular dependences\non momentum and frequency, for which an efficient parametrization in terms of\nboson-exchange interactions in the particle-hole and particle-particle channels\nis formulated. Based on this decomposition of the vertex, flow equations for\nthe effective interactions are derived, extending existing\nchannel-decomposition schemes to i) the description of symmetry breaking in the\nCooper channel and ii) the inclusion of those two-loop renormalization\ncontributions to the vertex that are neglected in the Katanin scheme. In the\nsecond part of this thesis, the superfluid ground state of various model\nsystems is studied. For the attractive Hubbard model at weak coupling, the\nmomentum and frequency dependence of the two-particle vertex and the frequency\ndependence of the self-energy are determined on one- and two-loop level.\nResults for the suppression of the superfluid gap by fluctuations are in good\nagreement with the literature.

An intrinsic view Abstract: The \"metric\" structure of nonrelativistic spacetimes consists of a one-form\n(the absolute clock) whose kernel is endowed with a positive-definite metric.\nContrarily to the relativistic case, the metric structure and the torsion do\nnot determine a unique Galilean (i.e. compatible) connection. This subtlety is\nintimately related to the fact that the timelike part of the torsion is\nproportional to the exterior derivative of the absolute clock. When the latter\nis not closed, torsionfreeness and metric-compatibility are thus mutually\nexclusive. We will explore generalisations of Galilean connections along the\ntwo corresponding alternative roads in a series of papers. In the present one,\nwe focus on compatible connections and investigate the equivalence problem\n(i.e. the search for the necessary data allowing to uniquely determine\nconnections) in the torsionfree and torsional cases. More precisely, we\ncharacterise the affine structure of the spaces of such connections and display\nthe associated model vector spaces. In contrast with the relativistic case, the\nmetric structure does not single out a privileged origin for the space of\nmetric-compatible connections. In our construction, the role of the Levi-Civita\nconnection is played by a whole class of privileged origins, the so-called\ntorsional Newton-Cartan (TNC) geometries recently investigated in the\nliterature.

All the earlier\nmodel predictions are too large compared with experiment. In this work, we\npoint out that for a given tree operator $O_i$, the contribution from its\nFiertz transformed operator, an effect often missed in the literature, tends to\ncancel the internal $W$-emission amplitude induced from $O_i$. The wave\nfunction of low-lying baryons are symmetric in momenta and the quark flavor\nwith the same chirality, but antisymmetric in color indices. Using these\nsymmetry properties and the chiral structure of weak interactions, we find that\nhalf of the Feynman diagrams responsible for internal $W$-emission cancel.\nSince this feature holds in the charmless modes but not in the charmful ones,\nwe advocate that the partial cancellation accounts for the smallness of the\ntree-dominated charmless two-body baryonic $B$ decays. This also explains why\nmost previous model calculations predicted too large rates as the above\nconsideration was not taken into account. Finally, we emphasize that, contrary\nto the claim in the literature, the internal $W$-emission tree amplitude should\nbe proportional to the Wilson coefficient $c_1+c_2$ rather than $c_1-c_2$. \n\n"}

If the neutral gauge boson corresponding to this abelian\nsymmetry is ultra-light, then it will give rise to flavor-dependent long-range\nleptonic force, which can have significant impact on neutrino oscillations.

First, we assume a\nconstant magnetic susceptibility $\\chi_{m}$ and consider an ultrarelativistic\nideal gas equation of state. For a paramagnetic fluid (i.e., with\n$\\chi_{m}>0$), the decay of the energy density slows down since the fluid gains\nenergy from the magnetic field. For a diamagnetic fluid (i.e., with\n$\\chi_{m}<0$), the energy density decays faster because it feeds energy into\nthe magnetic field. Furthermore, when the magnetic field is taken to be\nexternal and to decay in proper time $\\tau$ with a power law $\\sim\\tau^{-a}$,\ntwo distinct solutions can be found depending on the values of $a$ and\n$\\chi_m$.

Although the unitary time evolution ensuing from a pure initial\nstate maintains the system globally at zero entropy, at long time after the\nquench local properties are captured by an appropriate statistical ensemble\nwith non zero thermodynamic entropy, which can be interpreted as the\nentanglement accumulated during the dynamics. Therefore, understanding the\npost-quench entanglement evolution unveils how thermodynamics emerges in\nisolated quantum systems.

A\nmajor challenge to develop this new skyrmion-based technology is to achieve the\ncontrolled and deterministic creation of magnetic skyrmions without the need of\ncomplex setups. We demonstrate a solution to this challenge by showing how to\ncreate skyrmions and other magnetic textures in ferromagnetic thin films by\nmeans of a homogeneous DC current and without requiring Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteractions. This is possible by exploiting a static loss of stability arising\nfrom the interplay of current-induced spin-transfer torque and a spatially\ninhomogeneous magnetization, which can be achieved, e.g., by locally\nengineering the anisotropy, the magnetic field, or other magnetic interactions.\nThe magnetic textures are created controllably, efficiently, and periodically\nwith a period that can be tuned by the applied current strength. We propose\nspecific experimental setups realizable with simple materials, such as cobalt\nbased materials, to observe the periodic formation of skyrmions. We show that\nadding chiral interactions will not influence the basics of the generations but\nthen influence the consequent dynamics with respect to the stabilization of\ntopological textures.

The\nnon-Abelian nature is reflected in the coherence sum of the color fields which\nas a consequence gives rise to an enhancement of the transverse momentum and a\nsuppression of the multiplicities relative to the non overlapping strings.\n  The initial temperature and shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\\eta/s$\nare obtained.

Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton\n(EMd) theory is an exception: through couplings both to electromagnetism and\n(non-minimally) to gravity, a massless scalar field can be generated by an\nelectrically charged BH. In this work, we analytically model the dynamics of\nbinaries comprised of such scalar-charged (\"hairy\") BHs. While BHs are not\nexpected to have substantial electric charge within the Standard Model of\nparticle physics, nearly-extremally charged BHs could occur in models of\nminicharged dark matter and dark photons. We begin by studying the test-body\nlimit for a binary BH in EMd theory, and we argue that only very compact\nbinaries of nearly-extremally charged BHs can manifest non-perturbative\nphenomena similar to those found in certain scalar-tensor theories. Then, we\nuse the post-Newtonian approximation to study the dynamics of binary BHs with\narbitrary mass ratios.

Within the Hartree\nfactorization scheme, we show that the O(N) model has at least two observable\nremains left behind the off-equilibrium processes: the running spectral index\nof primordial density perturbations and the correlations between perturbation\nmodes in phase space. We find that the running of the spectral index is fully\ndetermined by the rate of the energy transfer from the inflationary background\nfield to its fluctuations via particle creation processes as well as the\ndynamics of the background field itself.

Our estimates suggest that the instability may have\nplayed a role in the evolution of the fastest spinning pulsars, and that it may\nbe presently active in the recently discovered 2.49 ms X-ray pulsar SAX\nJ1808.4-3658 as well as the rapidly spinning neutron stars observed in low mass\nX-ray binaries. This provides a new explanation for the remarkably similar\nrotation periods inferred from kHz quasi-periodic oscillations in the LMXBs.\nThe possibility that the rotation of recycled pulsars may be\ngravitational-radiation limited is interesting because the gravitational waves\nfrom a neutron star rotating at the instability limit may well be detectable\nwith the new generation of interferometric detectors. 2) We also consider white\ndwarfs, and find that the r-mode instability may possibly be active in short\nperiod white dwarfs.

In the two cases, the\nsystem is strongly insulating and the ground state energy is essentially\ninvariant under a twist of the boundary conditions. Reducing the interaction\nstrength from large to intermediate values, the quantum melting of the solid\narray gives rise to a more homogeneous distribution of charges, and the ground\nstate energy changes when the boundary conditions are twisted. In individual\nchains, this melting occurs by abrupt steps located at sample-dependent values\nof the interaction where an (avoided) level crossing between the ground state\nand the first excitation can be observed. Important charge reorganizations take\nplace at the avoided crossings and the persistent currents are strongly\nenhanced around the corresponding interaction value. These large delocalization\neffects become smeared and reduced after ensemble averaging. They mainly\ncharacterize half filling and strong disorder, but they persist away of this\noptimal condition. \n\n"}

This equation expresses\nthe gradient of the active gravitational energy E according to the Einstein\nequation, divided into energy-supply and work terms. Projecting the equation\nalong the flow of thermodynamic matter and along the trapping horizon of a\nblackhole yield, respectively, first laws of relativistic thermodynamics and\nblack-hole dynamics. In the black-hole case, this first law has the same form\nas the first law of black-hole statics, with static perturbations replaced by\nthe derivative along the horizon. There is the expected term involving the area\nand surface gravity, where the dynamic surface gravity is defined as in the\nstatic case but using the Kodama vector and trapping horizon. This surface\ngravity vanishes for degenerate trapping horizons and satisfies certain\nexpected inequalities involving the area and energy. In the thermodynamic case,\nthe quasi-local first law has the same form, apart from a relativistic factor,\nas the classical first law of thermodynamics, involving heat supply and\nhydrodynamic work, but with E replacing the internal energy. Expanding E in the\nNewtonian limit shows that it incorporates the Newtonian mass, kinetic energy,\ngravitational potential energy and thermal energy. There is also a weak type of\nunified zeroth law: a Gibbs-like definition of thermal equilibrium requires\nconstancy of an effective temperature, generalising the Tolman condition and\nthe particular case of Hawking radiation, while gravithermal equilibrium\nfurther requires constancy of surface gravity.

Once black holes are produced, they will\ngive us much information about TeV-scale new physics directly. But such black\nholes can also be used for the precision measurements of the Standard Model\n(SM). The SM is nothing but a theory which can describe weak-scale, and\nTeV-scale physics will affect it. So if some experimental results which cannot\nbe explained in the SM are found, they will be attributed to TeV-scale physics\nand we can obtain ``bottom-up'' type information about new physics. In this\npaper, we consider the precision measurements of the top sector at the LHC by\nusing black holes. The stringent trigger conditions to confirm the black hole\nproduction vanish almost all of the QCD background, and we can examine the top\nquark emitted from black holes very precisely. The error of the top quark mass\nand the top Yukawa coupling are drastically reduced, leading to a very accurate\ntest of the Higgs mechanism. We can directly measure the CKM matrix element\n|V_{ts}|, and we will understand the property of the CKM matrix and the origin\nof CP-violation deeply. The very precise measurements of such properties in the\nSM, enabled by black holes, can become treasures in the quest for TeV-scale\nphysics because there exists a possibility that TeV-scale physics affects them\nand destroys the predictions of the SM. By combining the direct information of\nnew physics obtained from black holes themselves and the indirect information\nobtained from the limitations of the SM, we will be able to identify TeV-scale\nphysics correctly. \n\n"}

Such special solution is allowed by the existence of a Chern-Simons\ncoupling in the Supergravity theory and by the possibility of imposing a self\nduality condition on the `rotation 2-form'. We explore three peculiar features\nof such black holes: 1) Oxidising to D=10 the five dimensional configuration\nmay be interpreted as a system of $D1-D5$ branes with a Brinkmann wave\npropagating along their worldvolume. Unlike its five dimensional Kaluza-Klein\ncompactification, the universal covering space of this manifold has no\ncausality violations. In other words, causal anomalies can be solved in higher\ndimensions. From the dual SCFT viewpoint, the causality bound for the\ncompactified spacetime arises as the unitarity bound; 2) The vanishing of the\nscattering cross section for uncharged scalars and sufficiently high angular\nmomentum of the background is shown still to hold at the level of charged\ninteractions. The same is verified when a non-minimal coupling to the geometry\nis used.

For\ninstance, it is not widely recognized that there exist two well defined\nnon-relativistic limits, so that researchers and teachers are likely to utilize\nan incoherent mixture of both. Recent works have shed a new light on the choice\nof gauge conditions in classical electromagnetism.
