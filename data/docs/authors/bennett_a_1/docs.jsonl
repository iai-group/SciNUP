One such restriction is that we cannot copy an arbitrary quantum\nstate. This is known as No-cloning theorem. Although quantum mechanics forbid\nus to construct a perfect cloner, there is no restriction to construct an\nimperfect cloner. Therefore, we have constructed and studied a special kind of\nquantum cloning machine named as Hybrid quantum cloning machine which is\nnothing but a different combination of pre-existing quantum cloning machines.\nWe showed that this hybrid quantum cloning machine sometime gives better\nquality copy than the pre-existing quantum cloners. Quantum entanglement is a\nvery astonishing property in a multi-partite system and it is a very useful\ningredient of quantum information theory. Therefore broadcasting (cloning) of\nentanglement is a very important subject to study. In this regard we have\nstudied the broadcasting of entanglement using state dependent quantum cloning\nmachine. Further, we have investigated the problem of secretly broadcasting of\nthree-qubit entangled state between two distant partners. Linearity of quantum\nmechanics put another restriction on deletion of an arbitrary quantum state\ni.e. an arbitrary quantum state against a copy cannot be perfectly deleted.\nLike cloning machine one can construct an approximate deletion machine also.\nTherefore, we have constructed an universal deletion machine in the sense that\nthe fidelity of deletion does not depend on the input state and showed that the\nfidelity of deletion is 3/4 .

Our considerations are motivated by the\nfact that, in some recent experiments on bilayer graphene there is a single\ngate while in others there are two gates, which can function as the conducting\nplanes and which, we argue, can lead to distinct broken symmetry phases. We map\nout the phases that the system enters as a function of the range of the\ninteraction. We discover that the system enters an antiferromagnetic phase for\nshort ranges of the interaction and a nematic phase at long ranges, in\nagreement with previous work. While the antiferromagnetic phase results in a\ngap in the spectrum, the nematic phase is gapless, splitting the quadratic\ndegeneracy points into two Dirac cones each. We also consider the effects of an\napplied magnetic field on the system in the antiferromagnetic phase via\nvariational mean field theory. At low fields, we find that the\nantiferromagnetic order parameter, Delta(B)-Delta(0) \\sim B^2. At higher\nfields, when omega_c > 2*Delta_0, we find that\nDelta(B)=omega_c/[ln(omega_c/Delta(0))+C], where C=0.67 and omega_c=eB/m^*c. We\nalso determine the energy gap for creating electron-hole excitations in the\nsystem, and, at high fields, we find it to be a*omega_c+2*Delta(B), where a is\na non-universal, interaction-dependent, constant. \n\n"}

Two interesting phenomena are\nreported and analyzed: (1) We observe dynamical many-body freezing or DMF\n(Phys. Rev.

The\nfactorization consists of a geometric operator (path-ordered magnetic\ntranslation), a dynamical operator generated by the usual time-independent\nLandau Hamiltonian, and a nonadiabatic operator that determines the transition\nprobabilities among the Landau levels.

In\ngeneral terms, the cause of the misunderstanding on the security claim is the\nLemma in the paper of Renner. It suggests that the generation of the perfect\nrandom key is assured by the probability $ (1-d)$, and its failure probability\nis $d$. Thus, it concludes that the generated key provides the perfect random\nkey sequence when the protocol suceeds. So the QKD provides perfect secrecy to\nthe one time pad. This is the reason for the composition claim. However, the\nquantity of the trace distance (or variational distance) is not the probability\nfor such an event.

Surprisingly, this\nreactivation can be induced by the injection of separable correlations from the\ncomposite environment. In any dimension (finite or infinite), we can construct\nclassically-correlated \"twirling\" environments which are entanglement-breaking\nin the transmission of single systems but entanglement-preserving when two\nsystems are transmitted. Here entanglement is simply preserved by the existence\nof decoherence-free subspaces. Remarkably, even when such subspaces do not\nexist, a fraction of the input entanglement can still be distributed. This is\nfound in separable Gaussian environments, where distillable entanglement is\nable to survive the two-mode transmission, despite being broken in any\nsingle-mode transmission by the strong thermal noise. In the Gaussian setting,\nentanglement restoration is a threshold process, occurring only after a\ncritical amount of correlations has been injected. Such findings suggest new\nperspectives for distributing entanglement in realistic environments with\nextreme decoherence, identifying separable correlations and classical memory\neffects as physical resources for \"breaking entanglement-breaking\". \n\n"}

A crucial result of\nthis design is that low-fidelity magic states can be consumed to purify other\nhigh-fidelity magic states to even higher fidelity, which we call \"multilevel\ndistillation.\" When distilling in the asymptotic regime of infidelity $\\epsilon\n\\rightarrow 0$ for each input magic state, the number of input magic states\nconsumed on average to yield an output state with infidelity\n$O(\\epsilon^{2^r})$ approaches $2^r+1$, which comes close to saturating the\nconjectured bound in [Phys.

More\nspecifically, we address systems where the Gaussian approximation fails, i.e.\nthe sole knowledge of the spectrum is not enough to determine the dynamics of\nquantum correlations. We thus investigate the dynamics for two different\nconfigurations of the environment: in the first case the noise spectrum is due\nto the interaction of each qubit with a single bistable fluctuator with an\nundetermined switching rate, whereas in the second case we consider a\ncollection of classical fluctuators with fixed switching rates. In both cases\nwe found analytical expressions for the time dependence of entanglement and\nquantum discord, which may be also extended to a collection of flcutuators with\nrandom switching rates. The environmental noise is introduced by means of\nstochastic time-dependent terms in the Hamiltonian and this allows us to\ndescribe the effects of both separate and common environments.

Defects often play a central role in ionic and electronic solids, not\nonly to limit reliability, but more importantly to enable the functionalities\nthat make these materials of critical importance. Examples include solid\nelectrolytes that conduct current through the motion of charged point defects,\nand complex oxide ferroelectrics that display multifunctionality through the\nmotion of domain wall defects. Therefore, it is important to understand the\nstructure of defects and their response to electrical and mechanical fields. A\ncentral hurdle, however, is that interactions in ionic solids include both\nshort-range atomic interactions as well as long-range electrostatic\ninteractions. Existing atomistic-to-continuum multi-scale methods, such as the\nQuasicontinuum method, are applicable only when the atomic interactions are\nshort-range. In addition, empirical reductions of quantum mechanics to density\nfunctional models are unable to capture key phenomena of interest in these\nmaterials. To address this open problem, we develop a multiscale atomistic\nmethod to coarse-grain the long-range electrical interactions in ionic crystals\nwith defects. In these settings, the charge density is rapidly varying, but in\nan almost-periodic manner. The key idea is to use the polarization density\nfield as a multiscale mediator that enables efficient coarse-graining by\nexploiting the almost-periodic nature of the variation. In regions far from the\ndefect, where the crystal is close-to-perfect, the polarization field serves as\na proxy that enables us to avoid accounting for the details of the charge\nvariation. We combine this approach for long-range electrostatics with the\nstandard Quasicontinuum method for short-range interactions to achieve an\nefficient multiscale atomistic-to-continuum method. \n\n"}

So far, work\nhas focused on Weyl semimetals with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However,\nWeyl semimetals with weak SOC may allow tunable spin-splitting for device\napplications and may exhibit a crossover to a spinless topological phase, such\nas a Dirac line semimetal in the case of spinless TaAs. NbP, isostructural to\nTaAs, may realize the first Weyl semimetal in the limit of weak SOC. Here we\nstudy the surface states of NbP by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) and we find that we $\\textit{cannot}$ show Fermi arcs based on our\nexperimental data alone. We present an $\\textit{ab initio}$ calculation of the\nsurface states of NbP and we find that the Weyl points are too close and the\nFermi level is too low to show Fermi arcs either by (1) directly measuring an\narc or (2) counting chiralities of edge modes on a closed path. Nonetheless,\nthe excellent agreement between our experimental data and numerical\ncalculations suggests that NbP is a Weyl semimetal, consistent with TaAs, and\nthat we observe trivial surface states which evolve continuously from the\ntopological Fermi arcs above the Fermi level. Based on these results, we\npropose a slightly different criterion for a Fermi arc which, unlike (1) and\n(2) above, does not require us to resolve Weyl points or the spin splitting of\nsurface states. We propose that raising the Fermi level by $> 20$ meV would\nmake it possible to observe a Fermi arc using this criterion in NbP. Our work\noffers insight into Weyl semimetals with weak spin-orbit coupling, as well as\nthe crossover from the spinful topological Weyl semimetal to the spinless\ntopological Dirac line semimetal. \n\n"}

Understanding gradual weak measurements\nrequires replacing this scenario with a dynamical evolution equation for the\ncollapse of the quantum state in individual experimental runs. We revisit the\nquantum trajectory framework that models quantum measurement as a continuous\nnonlinear stochastic process.

Using first principles quantum transport simulations, we show that\nthe voltage drop across \\emph{symmetric} junctions changes dramatically and\ncontrollably in gated systems compared to non-gated junctions.

Central to this phenomenon are Hamiltonians whose insulating gap is\ncontrolled by a multi-dimensional (usually two-dimensional) parameter space in\nwhich paths can be defined for adiabatic changes in the Hamiltonian, i.e.,\nwithout closing the gap. Here, we extend the concept of Thouless pumps of band\ninsulators by considering a larger, three-dimensional parameter space.

The celebrated quantum Rabi model describes the simplest\ninteraction of a two-level system with a single-mode boson field. When the\ncoupling is large enough, the bare multilevel structure of a realistic circuit\natom cannot be ignored even if the circuit is strongly anharmonic. We explored\nthis situation theoretically for flux (fluxonium) and charge (Cooper pair box)\ntype multi-level circuits tuned to their respective flux/charge degeneracy\npoints. We identified which spectral features of the quantum Rabi model survive\nand which are renormalized for large coupling. Despite significant\nrenormalization of the low-energy spectrum in the fluxonium case, the key\nquantum Rabi feature -- nearly-degenerate vacuum consisting of an atomic state\nentangled with a multi-photon field -- appears in both types of circuits when\nthe coupling is sufficiently large. Like in the quantum Rabi model, for very\nlarge couplings the entanglement spectrum is dominated by only two, nearly\nequal eigenvalues, in spite of the fact that a large number of bare atomic\nstates are actually involved in the atom-resonator ground state.

For flux tunneling, the\ndressing is nothing else than the shunting of a Josephson atom with a large\ncapacitance of the resonator.

As an example, we apply our\nanalytical approach to the scenario of a two-dimensional quantum particle\ncrossing a tilted ridge potential barrier.

While extremely robust to many\nenvironmental perturbations, these systems are vulnerable to noise with\nhigh-frequency components. Ironically, slower processes needed for adiabaticity\nallow more noise-induced excitations to accumulate, resulting in an\nantiadiabatic behavior that limits the precision of Majorana gates if some\nnoise is present. In a recent publication [Phys. Rev. B 96, 075158 (2017)],\nfast optimal protocols were proposed as a shortcut for implementing the same\nunitary operation as the adiabatic braiding. These shortcuts sacrifice\ntopological protection in the absence of noise but provide performance gains\nand remarkable robustness to noise due to the shorter evolution time.\nNevertheless, gates optimized for vanishing noise are suboptimal in the\npresence of noise. If we know the noise strength beforehand, can we design\nprotocols optimized for the existing unavoidable noise, which will effectively\ncorrect the noise-induced errors? We address this question in the present\npaper. We find such optimal protocols using simulated-annealing Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The numerically found pulse shapes, which we fully characterize,\nare in agreement with Pontryagin's minimum principle, which allows us to\narbitrarily improve the approximate numerical results (due to discretization\nand imperfect convergence) and obtain numerically exact optimal protocols. The\nprotocols are \\textit{bang-bang} (sequence of sudden quenches) for vanishing\nnoise, but contain continuous segments in the presence of multiplicative noise\ndue to the nonlinearity of the master equation governing the evolution.

Recently, this\nimportant problem was shown to be undecidable for quantum spin systems in two\n(or more) spatial dimensions: there exists no algorithm that determines in\ngeneral whether a system is gapped or gapless, a result which has many\nunexpected consequences for the physics of such systems. However, there are\nmany indications that one dimensional spin systems are simpler than their\nhigher-dimensional counterparts: for example, they cannot have thermal phase\ntransitions or topological order, and there exist highly-effective numerical\nalgorithms such as DMRG - and even provably polynomial-time ones - for gapped\n1D systems, exploiting the fact that such systems obey an entropy area-law.\nFurthermore, the spectral gap undecidability construction crucially relied on\naperiodic tilings, which are not possible in 1D.\n  So does the spectral gap problem become decidable in 1D? In this paper we\nprove this is not the case, by constructing a family of 1D spin chains with\ntranslationally-invariant nearest neighbour interactions for which no algorithm\ncan determine the presence of a spectral gap. This not only proves that the\nspectral gap of 1D systems is just as intractable as in higher dimensions, but\nalso predicts the existence of qualitatively new types of complex physics in 1D\nspin chains. In particular, it implies there are 1D systems with constant\nspectral gap and non-degenerate classical ground state for all systems sizes up\nto an uncomputably large size, whereupon they switch to a gapless behaviour\nwith dense spectrum. \n\n"}

Claims to the contrary based on quantum violations of Bell\ninequalities are shown to be incorrect. A specific example traces a violation\nof the CHSH Bell inequality in the case of a spin-3/2 particle to the\nnoncommutation of certain quantum operators in a situation where (non)locality\nis not an issue. A consistent histories analysis of what quantum measurements\nmeasure, in terms of quantum properties, is used to identify the basic problem\nwith derivations of Bell inequalities: the use of classical concepts (hidden\nvariables) rather than a probabilistic structure appropriate to the quantum\ndomain. A difficulty with the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument\nfor the incompleteness of quantum mechanics is the use of a counterfactual\nargument which is not valid if one assumes that Hilbert-space quantum mechanics\nis complete; locality is not an issue.

In a realistic setup the localization for\nmixed states is robust and experimentally accessible, and we discuss\napplications to superselection rules. For an ideal setup and initial Fock\nstates we show how a relational Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat state emerges, and\ninvestigate circumstances under which such a state is destroyed. In our second\nexample we consider the localization of relative atomic phase between two Bose\nEinstein condensates, looking particularly at the build up of spatial\ninterference patterns, an area which has attracted much attention since the\nwork of Javanainen and Yoo. We show that the relative phase localizes much\nfaster than was intimated in previous studies focusing on the emerging\ninterference pattern itself.

The scheme is based on four-wave mixing processes leading to\nemission into two cavity modes, which are resonant with the Rabi sidebands of\nthe atomic dipole transition, driven by a saturating classical field. At steady\nstate the cavity modes are in an Einstein-Podolski-Rosen (EPR) state, whose\ndegree of entanglement is controlled by the intensity and the frequency of the\ntransverse field. This scheme is robust against stochastic fluctuations in the\natomic beam, does not require atomic detection nor velocity selection, and can\nbe realized by presently available experimental setups with microwave\nresonators. \n\n"}

The analysis of the\nscattering of particles in a step potential with an arbitrary mixing of vector\nand scalar couplings reveals that the scalar coupling contributes for\nincreasing the threshold energy for the particle-antiparticle pair production.\nFurthermore, it is shown that the pair production is only feasible whether the\nvector coupling exceeds the scalar one. An apparent paradox concerning the\nlocalization of a particle in an arbitrarily small region of space, due to the\npresence of the scalar coupling, is solved by introducing the concept of\neffective Compton wavelength. \n\n"}

The generalized flow also applied in\nthe extended model with measurements in the X-Y, X-Z and Y-Z planes. We apply\nboth measurement calculus and the stabiliser formalism to derive our main\ntheorem which for the first time gives a full characterization of the\ndeterministic computation in the one-way model. We present several examples to\nshow how our result improves over the traditional notion of flow, such as\ngeometries (entanglement graph with input and output) with no flow but having\ngeneralized flow and we discuss how they lead to an optimal implementation of\nthe unitaries. More importantly one can also obtain a better quantum\ncomputation depth with the generalized flow rather than with flow. We believe\nour characterization result is particularly essential for the study of the\nalgorithms and complexity in the one-way model. \n\n"}

There is a\nneed for such a measure since the prevalent measures (such as\n\\textit{concurrence} and \\textit{negativity}) are rough benchmarks, and not\nmonotones of each other. Considering the specific case of two qubit mixed\nstates, we provide an explicit construction of $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{E})$ and\nshow that it is characterised by a set of parameters, of which concurrence is\nbut one particular combination. $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{E})$ is manifestly\ninvariant under $SU(2) \\times SU(2)$ transformations. It can, in fact,\nreconstruct the state up to local operations\n  - with the specification of at most four additional parameters. Finally the\nnew measure resolves the controversy regarding the role of entanglement in\nquantum computation in NMR systems. \n\n"}
