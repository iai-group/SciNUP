This has led\nnaturally to proposals that a correct approach is to instead use a type of\n\"generalized\" transverse momentum dependent factorization in which the basic\nfactorized structure is assumed to remain valid, but with transverse momentum\ndependent parton distribution functions that contain non-standard, process\ndependent Wilson line structures. In other words, to recover a factorization\nformula, it has become common to assume that it is sufficient to simply modify\nthe Wilson lines in the parton correlation functions for each separate hadron.\nIn this paper, we will illustrate by direct counter-example that this is not\npossible in a non-Abelian gauge theory. Since a proof of generalized transverse\nmomentum dependent factorization should apply generally to any hard\nhadro-production process, a single counter-example suffices to show that a\ngeneral proof does not exist. Therefore, to make the counter-argument clear and\nexplicit, we illustrate with a specific calculation for a double spin asymmetry\nin a spectator model with a non-Abelian gauge field. The observed breakdown of\ngeneralized transverse momentum dependent factorization challenges the notion\nthat the role of parton transverse momentum in such processes can be described\nusing separate correlation functions for each external hadron. \n\n"}

In particular, we\nexplore the theoretical uncertainties associated with modeling contributions of\nhadronic intermediate states. Taking into account constraints from low- and\nhigh-energy, parity-conserving electroproduction measurements, choosing\ndifferent models for contributions from the non-resonant processes, and\nperforming the corresponding flavor rotations to obtain the electroweak\namplitude, we arrive at an estimate of the uncertainty in the total\ncontribution to the parity-violating asymmetry. At the kinematics of the Q-Weak\nexperiment, we obtain a correction to the asymmetry equivalent to a shift in\nthe proton weak charge of $(0.0054\\pm0.0020)$. This should be compared to the\nvalue of the proton's weak charge of $\\qwp=0.0713\\pm0.0008$ that includes SM\ncontributions at tree level and one-loop radiative corrections. Therefore, we\nobtain a new Standard Model prediction for the parity-violating asymmetry in\nthe kinematics of the Q-Weak experiment of $(0.0767\\pm0.0008\\pm0.0020_{\\gamma\nZ})$. The latter error leads to a relative uncertainty of 2.8% in the\ndetermination of the proton's weak charge, and is dominated by the uncertainty\nin the isospin structure of the inclusive cross section.

We find that this effect is enough to spoil quark number scaling\nin elliptic flow. A lack of scaling in data therefore does not signal the\nabsence of partonic degrees of freedom and hadronization by coalescence. In a\ncoalescing partonic fluid, however, elliptic flow of anti-baryons should be the\ngreater than that of baryons, since antibaryons contain a greater admixture of\npartons from the highly flowing midrapidity region. Intriguingly, purely\nhadronic dynamics has a similar dependence of baryon-anti-baryons $v_2$ as\npurely partonic dynamics, again because antibaryons tend to come from regions\nwhere the deviation of the system from hydrodynamic behavior is at its\nsmallest.

The first property is the approximate scaling\nrelation between proton and neutron high-momentum distributions weighted by\ntheir relative fractions in the nucleus. The second property is the inverse\nproportionality of the strength of the high-momentum distribution of protons\nand neutrons to the same relative fractions. Based on these two properties the\nhigh-momentum distribution function for asymmetric nuclei has been modeled and\ndemonstrated that it describes reasonably well the high-momentum\ncharacteristics of light nuclei. However, the most surprising result is\nobtained for neutron rich nuclei with large A, for which a substantial relative\nabundance of high-momentum protons as compared to neutrons is predicted. For\nexample, the model predicts that in Au the relative fraction of protons with\nmomenta above $k_{F} \\sim 260$~MeV/c is 50% more than that of neutrons.

These model\nelements, whose dependence on relative azimuth angle has the form\n$\\cos[m(\\phi_1-\\phi_2)]$ where $m > 2$, were introduced to support a\nhydrodynamic flow interpretation of the same-side ($|\\phi_1-\\phi_2| < \\pi/2$)\n2D peak in the correlations. Previous studies have shown that the $m > 2$\nharmonics are not required by the data, that they destabilize the fitting\nmodels, and that their net effect is to decompose the same-side peak into two\ncomponents, one being dependent on and the other being independent of relative\npseudorapidity. Thus we are lead to question whether descriptions of angular\ncorrelation data including higher-order harmonics inform our understanding of\nthe same-side peak or heavy-ion collisions in general. Results from analysis of\ntwo-dimensional angular correlation data from the Relativistic Heavy-Ion\nCollider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) show that the RHIC data do\nnot exclude a single-Gaussian hypothesis for the same-side peak.

Those non-Gaussian effects are\nsystematically insignificant and can be accommodated by minor perturbations to\nthe same-side 2D Gaussian peak model, which act locally at small relative\nazimuth. We also demonstrate that the 0-1% 2D angular correlation data for 2.76\nTeV Pb+Pb collisions from ATLAS, which display an away-side double peak on\nazimuth, do not require a sextupole and exclude a positive same-side sextupole. \n\n"}

At small impact parameters the product of the moments of net-proton\ndistribution, kurtosis x variance and skewness x standard deviation are\nobserved to be significantly below the corresponding measurements at large\nimpact parameter collisions for 19.6 and 27 GeV. The kurtosis x variance and\nskewness x standard deviation at these beam energies deviate from the\nexpectations from Poisson statistics and that from a Hadron Resonance Gas\nmodel. Both these measurements have implications towards the understanding of\nthe QCD phase structures, the first order phase transition and the critical\npoint in the high baryonic chemical potential region of the phase diagram. \n\n"}

It aims at a\nsensitivity to spin-independent cross sections of $2 \\cdot 10^{-47} ~\n\\mathrm{cm}^{\\mathrm{2}}$ for WIMP masses around 50 GeV/c$^{2}$, which requires\na background reduction by two orders of magnitude compared to XENON100, the\ncurrent generation detector. An active system that is able to tag muons and\nmuon-induced backgrounds is critical for this goal. A water Cherenkov detector\nof $\\sim$10 m height and diameter has been therefore developed, equipped with 8\ninch photomultipliers and cladded by a reflective foil. We present the design\nand optimization study for this detector, which has been carried out with a\nseries of Monte Carlo simulations. The muon veto will reach very high detection\nefficiencies for muons ($>99.5%$) and showers of secondary particles from muon\ninteractions in the rock ($>70%$). Similar efficiencies will be obtained for\nXENONnT, the upgrade of XENON1T, which will later improve the WIMP sensitivity\nby another order of magnitude.

They help address the\nquestion of whether there is evidence for global, flow-like, azimuthal\ncorrelations in the p-Pb system. Comparisons are made to measurements from the\nlarger Pb-Pb system, where such evidence is established. In particular, the\nsecond harmonic two-particle cumulants are found to decrease with multiplicity,\ncharacteristic of a dominance of few-particle correlations in p-Pb collisions.\nHowever, when a $|\\Delta \\eta|$ gap is placed to suppress such correlations,\nthe two-particle cumulants begin to rise at high-multiplicity, indicating the\npresence of global azimuthal correlations. The Pb-Pb values are higher than the\np-Pb values at similar multiplicities. In both systems, the second harmonic\nfour-particle cumulants exhibit a transition from positive to negative values\nwhen the multiplicity increases. The negative values allow for a measurement of\n$v_{2}\\{4\\}$ to be made, which is found to be higher in Pb-Pb collisions at\nsimilar multiplicities. The second harmonic six-particle cumulants are also\nfound to be higher in Pb-Pb collisions.

Most of the works that have looked at this\nproblem have focused on using the value of the signal observed at a subset of\nnodes to recover the signal in the entire graph. Differently, the sampling\nscheme proposed here uses as input observations taken at a single node. The\nobservations correspond to sequential applications of the graph-shift operator,\nwhich are linear combinations of the information gathered by the neighbors of\nthe node. When the graph corresponds to a directed cycle (which is the support\nof time-varying signals), our method is equivalent to the classical sampling in\nthe time domain. When the graph is more general, we show that the Vandermonde\nstructure of the sampling matrix, which is critical to guarantee recovery when\nsampling time-varying signals, is preserved. Sampling and interpolation are\nanalyzed first in the absence of noise and then noise is considered.

A general consensus has been expressed on the need for a directional\nsensitive detector to confirm, with a complementary approach, the candidates\nfound in conventional searches and to finally extend their sensitivity beyond\nthe limit of neutrino-induced background. We propose here the use of a detector\nbased on nuclear emulsions to measure the direction of WIMP-induced nuclear\nrecoils. The production of nuclear emulsion films with nanometric grains is\nestablished. Several measurement campaigns have demonstrated the capability of\ndetecting sub-micrometric tracks left by low energy ions in such emulsion\nfilms. Innovative analysis technologies with fully automated optical\nmicroscopes have made it possible to achieve the track reconstruction for path\nlengths down to one hundred nanometers and there are good prospects to further\nexceed this limit.

The high density of hits on a given particle track facilitates the task\nof pattern recognition in a high-occupancy environment and in addition provides\nparticle identification by measuring the specific energy loss for each track.\nFor these reasons, TPCs with Multiwire Proportional Chamber (MWPC)\namplification have been and are widely used in experiments recording heavy-ion\ncollisions. A significant drawback, however, is the large dead time of the\norder of 1 ms per event generated by the use of a gating grid, which is\nmandatory to prevent ions created in the amplification region from drifting\nback into the drift volume, where they would severely distort the drift path of\nsubsequent tracks. For experiments with higher event rates this concept of a\nconventional TPC operating with a triggered gating grid can therefore not be\napplied without a significant loss of data. A continuous readout of the signals\nis the more appropriate way of operation. This, however, constitutes a change\nof paradigm with considerable challenges to be met concerning the amplification\nregion, the design and bandwidth of the readout electronics, and the data\nhandling.

Our hypothesis was based on\nexperimental data, which raised the idea of a finite formation time for the\nproduced medium. At RHIC energy and in low density corona region this time\nreaches about 2 fm/c. All observed high p_t particles are produced in the\ncorona region and have a chance to escape during this 2 fm/c. After that, the\nformed high density matter absorbs all jets. Following this hypothesis, the\nnuclear modification factor R_{AA} should be independent on particle momentum\nand be flat versus p_t. At the same time, we describe the finite azimuthal\nanisotropy of high p_t particles, v_2. A separate prediction held that, at LHC\nenergy, the formation time in the corona region should be two times smaller,\nabout 1 fm/c. New data at LHC show that R_{AA} is not flat and is rising with\np_t. We add to our original hypothesis an assumption that a fast parton\ntraversing the produced medium loses the fixed portion of its energy. A shift\nof about 7 GeV (I would call it as a parton binding energy) from the original\npower law p^{-6} production cross section in pp explains well all the observed\nR_{AA} dependencies. The shift of about 7 GeV is also valid at RHIC energy,\nwhere the cross section follows a power law with about p^{-8} and this shift\nexplains a very slow rise of R_{AA} seen for neutral pions with p_t above 15\nGeV/c. We also show that the observed at LHC dependence of v_2 at high p_t and\nour previous predictions agree. \n\n"}

Today the presence of an annual modulation, which matches in period and\nphase the expectation for dark matter, is supported at > 9$\\sigma$ confidence.\nThe underlying nature of dark matter, however, is still considered an open and\nfundamental question of particle physics. No other direct dark matter search\ncould confirm the DAMA claim up to now; moreover, numerous null-results are in\nclear contradiction under so-called standard assumptions for the dark matter\nhalo and the interaction mechanism of dark with ordinary matter. As both bear a\ndependence on the target material, resolving this controversial situation will\nconvincingly only be possible with an experiment using sodium iodide (NaI) as\ntarget. COSINUS aims to even go a step further by combining NaI with a novel\ndetection approach. COSINUS aims to operate NaI as a cryogenic calorimeter\nreading scintillation light and phonon/heat signal. Two distinct advantages\narise from this approach, a substantially lower energy threshold for nuclear\nrecoils and particle identification on an event-by-event basis.

The\nrapidity-odd directed flow at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions originates\nfrom a tilt in the reaction plane of the thermalized medium caused by the\nasymmetry between the number of participants from projectile and target nuclei\nas a function of rapidity.

Of particular interest are the\ncentrality dependence and the azimuthal anisotropy in the yield of baryons and\nmesons at intermediate $p_T$. The first measurements of $v_2$ and the\nnumber-of-binary-collisions scaled centrality ratio $R_{CP}$ for $K_S^0$ and\n$\\Lambda+\\bar{\\Lambda}$ production in Au+Au collisions at RHIC are presented.\nThese measurements from the STAR detector establish the particle-type\ndependence of $v_2$ and $R_{CP}$ within $0.4 < p_T < 6.0$. At intermediate\n$p_T$ (1.5--4.5 GeV/c) $v_2$ of $K_S^0$ and $\\Lambda+\\bar{\\Lambda}$ is shown to\nfollow a number-of-constituent-quark scaling with v_2^{kaon}(p_T/2)/2 =\nv_2^{lambda}(p_T/3)/3. $R_{CP}$ shows that lambda production at intermediate\n$p_T$ increases more rapidly with system size than kaon production: consistent\nwith multi-parton dynamics in particle production. At $p_T = 5.5$ GeV/c lambda,\nkaon, and charged hadron production are suppressed by a similar factor ($R_{CP}\n\\approx 0.33$): establishing the extent of the centrality dependent baryon\nenhancement. The particle- and $p_T$-dependence of $v_2$, and $R_{CP}$ are\nconsistent with expectations based on hadronization of bulk partonic matter by\ncoalescence.

Abstract: Elliptic flow measurements are presented and discussed with emphasis on the\nhydrodynamic character of the hot and dense QCD matter created in heavy ion\ncollisions at RHIC. Predictions from perfect fluid hydrodynamics for the\nscaling of the elliptic flow coefficient $v_2$ with eccentricity, system size\nand transverse energy are validated.

Special emphasis is put on its relation to the\nfluctuation of the chiral order parameter $<\\bar{q}q>$. In the vacuum, the\n$\\sigma$-meson is an elusive resonance corresponding to a pole deep in the\nsecond Riemann sheet of the $\\pi$-$\\pi$ scattering matrix in the $I$=$J$=0\nchannel. This is because the the amplitude fluctuation of $<\\bar{q}q>$\n(corresponding to {\\rm ur}-$\\sigma$) and the phase fluctuation of $<\\bar{q}q>$\n(2 pion states) mix strongly in the vacuum. As the temperature and/or density\nof the system increase, however, there arises a softening of this complex pole\ndue to the partial restoration of chiral symmetry.

A subsequent\ntheoretical analysis has shown that this picture is qualitatively correct but\nthere are important interference effects between the two mechanisms.\nFuthermore, at this energy the ratio of strengths for the Roper and $\\Delta$\npeak is about $1/4$. In the present paper we show that by going to the $10 -\n15$ $GeV$ region the interference effects become negligible, the signal for the\nRoper excitation is increased by more than an order of magnitude and the ratio\nof cross sections at the peaks for Roper and $\\Delta$ excitation becomes of the\norder of unity, thus making this range of energies ideal for studies of\nisoscalar Roper excitation. \n\n"}

Employing a recently developed method of constructing\nthe Hilbert space and observables for Klein-Gordon fields, we then obtain the\nprobability current density ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ for the localization of a\nKlein-Gordon field in space. We show that in the nonrelativistic limit both\n$J_a^\\mu$ and ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ tend to the probability current density for the\nlocalization of a nonrelativistic free particle in space, but that unlike\n$J_a^\\mu$ the current density ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ is neither covariant nor\nconserved. Because the total probability may be obtained by integrating either\nof these two current densities over the whole space, the conservation of the\ntotal probability may be viewed as a consequence of the local conservation of\n$J_a^\\mu$. The latter is a manifestation of a previously unnoticed global gauge\nsymmetry of the Klein-Gordon fields. The corresponding gauge group is U(1) if\nthe parameter $a$ is rational. It is the multiplicative group of positive real\nnumbers if $a$ is irrational. We also discuss an extension of our results to\nKlein-Gordon fields minimally coupled to an electromagnetic field. \n\n"}
