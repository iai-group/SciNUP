The Efimov effect, once considered a mysterious and esoteric\neffect, is today a reality that many experiments in ultracold quantum gases\nhave successfully observed and continued to explore [2-14]. Whereas theory was\nthe driving force behind our understanding of Efimov physics for decades,\nrecent experiments have contributed an unexpected discovery.

Here we study the effect on\ncharmonium and bottomonium production in hadronic collisions, such as at LHCb\nand at the proposed fixed target experiment AFTER at LHC. We focus mainly on\nthe scalar and pseudoscalar quarkonia, eta_c, chi_{c0}, eta_b, chi_{b0}, which\nallow for an angular independent investigation. Within the framework of\ntransverse momentum dependent factorization in combination with the\nnonrelativistic QCD based color-singlet quarkonium model, we show for small\ntransverse momentum (q_T^2 \\ll 4 M_Q^2) that the scalar and pseudoscalar\nquarkonium production cross sections are modified in different ways by linearly\npolarized gluons, while their effects on the production of higher angular\nmomentum quarkonium states are strongly suppressed.

In this paper we\ninvestigate the extent to which these are universal quantities for a given\ntheory, and to which they distinguish different theories, by comparing the\nentanglement spectra of the massless Dirac fermion and the compact free boson\nin two dimensions. We show that the calculation of Renyi entropies via the\nreplica trick for any orbifold theory includes a sum over orbifold twists on\nall cycles. In a modular-invariant theory of fermions, this amounts to a sum\nover spin structures. The result is that the Renyi entropies respect the\nstandard Bose-Fermi duality. Next, we investigate the entanglement spectrum for\nthe Dirac fermion without a sum over spin structures, and for the compact boson\nat the self-dual radius. These are not equivalent theories; nonetheless, we\nfind that (1) their second Renyi entropies agree for any number of intervals,\n(2) their full entanglement spectra agree for two intervals, and (3) the\nspectrum generically disagrees otherwise.

Using representative BSM\nscenarios of current interest, we illustrate how the interplay of physics at\nvarious scales generates EDMs at a potentially observable level. \n\n"}

Abstract: The extension of the standard model to $SU(3)_L\\times SU(3)_R \\times SU(3)_C$\nis considered. Spontaneous symmetry breaking requires two $(3^*, 3, 1)$ Higgs\nfield multiplets with a strong hierarchical structure of their vacuum\nexpectation values. An invariant potential is constructed to provide for these\nvacuum expectation values. This potential gives masses to all scalar fields\napart from the 15 Goldstone bosons. In case there exists a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the vacuum expectation values of the two field\nmultiplets, the scalar boson spectrum contains degenerate eigenstates. The\nlowest eigenstate has a mass near 123 GeV close to the Higgs-like particle\ndiscovered at the LHC. In one class of solutions this lowest state is a nearly\ndegenerate twin state. Each member is a superposition of fields from both\nmultiplets with about equal strength. The twins are non identical twins, namely\ndifferent combinations of a conventional Higgs and a Higgs field which is not\ncoupled to fermions, only to gauge bosons.

At low baryon density, n_B < ~\n2n_s (n_s: nuclear saturation density), we utilize purely hadronic equations of\nstate that are constrained by empirical observations at density n_B ~ n_s and\nneutron star radii. At high density, n_B > ~ 5n_s, we use the percolated quark\nmatter equations of state which must be very stiff to pass the two-solar mass\nconstraints. The intermediate domain at 2 < n_B/n_s < 5 is described as neither\npurely hadronic nor percolated quark matter, and the equations of state are\ninferred by interpolating hadronic and percolated quark matter equations of\nstate. Possible forms of the interpolation are severely restricted by the\ncondition on the (square of) speed of sound, 0 < c_s^2 < 1. The characteristics\nof the 3-window equation of state are compared with those of conventional\nhybrid and self-bound quark matters. Using a schematic quark model for the\npercolated domain, it is argued that the two-solar mass constraint requires the\nmodel parameters to be as large as their vacuum values, indicating that the\ngluon dynamics remains strongly non-perturbative to n_B ~ 10n_s.

These artifacts can be practically cured by introducing\nabsorbing boundary conditions (ABC) through an absorbing potential in a certain\nboundary region sufficiently far from the described system.

We show that,\nbecause of the quenching of the energy of partons within a jet, even when\n$K\\neq 0$ the jets that survive with some specified energy in the final state\nare narrower than jets with that energy in proton-proton collisions. For this\nreason, many standard observables are rather insensitive to $K$. We propose a\nnew differential jet shape ratio observable in which the effects of transverse\nmomentum broadening are apparent. We also analyze the response of the medium to\nthe passage of the jet through it, noting that the momentum lost by the jet\nappears as the momentum of a wake in the medium. After freezeout this wake\nbecomes soft particles with a broad angular distribution but with net momentum\nin the jet direction. We show that the particles coming from the response of\nthe medium to the momentum and energy deposited in it leads to a correlation\nbetween the momentum of soft particles well separated from the jet in angle\nwith the direction of the jet momentum, and find qualitative but not\nquantitative agreement with experimental data on observables designed to\nextract such a correlation. By confronting the results that we obtain upon\nintroducing transverse momentum broadening and the response of the medium to\nthe jet with available jet data, we highlight the importance of these processes\nfor understanding the internal, soft, angular structure of high energy jets. \n\n"}

It is assumed that there is a small violation of Lorentz invariance and\nthe true symmetry group of nature is a subgroup called SIM(2). This symmetry\ngroup postulates the existence of a fundamental or preferred direction in\nspace-time. We study its implications by using an effective action which\nviolates Lorentz invariance but respects VSR. We find that the problem of\nfinding the masses of fundamental fermions is in general intractable in the\npresence of VSR term. The problem can be solved only in special cases which we\npursue in this paper. We next determine the signal of VSR in torsion pendulum\nexperiment as well as clock comparison experiment. We find that VSR predicts a\nsignal which is different from other Lorentz violating theories and hence a\ndedicated data analysis is needed in order to impose reliable limits. Assuming\nthat signal is absent in data we determine the limits that can be imposed on\nthe VSR parameters. We also study the implications of VSR in particle decay\nexperiments taking the charged pion and kaon decay as an example. The effective\ninteraction between the charged pion and the final state leptons is related to\nthe fundamental VSR mass terms through a loop calculation. We also predict a\nshift in the angular dependence of the decay products due to VSR. In particular\nwe find that these no longer display azimuthal symmetry with respect to the\nmomentum of the pion. Furthermore the azimuthal and polar angle distributions\nshow time dependence with a period of a sidereal day. This time dependence\nprovides us with a novel method to test VSR in future experiments. \n\n"}

In this model one assumes that a\nnon-equilibrium decoupling phase follows a fluid dynamical description of the\nhigh density phase.

We consider two essential ingredients of such a simulation: a\ngeneric extension of hydrodynamics by a_parametrically_ slow mode or modes\n(\"Hydro+\") and a description of fluctuations out of equilibrium. By combining\nthe two ingredients we are able to describe the bulk evolution and the\nfluctutations within the same framework. Critical slowing down means that\nequilibration of fluctuations could be as slow as hydrodynamic evolution and\nthus fluctuations could significantly deviate from equilibrium near the\ncritical point. We generalize hydrodynamics to partial-equilibrium conditions\nwhere the state of the system is characterized by the off-equilibrium magnitude\nof fluctuations in addition to the usual hydrodynamic variables -- conserved\ndensities.

So far\nthe chaotic behavior has been obtained through explicit calculations in\nspecific models.

We study the time\nevolution of the quantum correlations under those protocols in two different\nlimits of the mass quench; fast limit and slow limit depending on the speed\nwith which the mass is changed.

In\nthis article, we introduce the idea of a quantum small-world network by\nstarting from a well understood integrable system, a spin-1 Heisenberg chain.\nWe then inject a small number of long-range interactions into the spin chain\nand study its ability to scramble quantum information using two primary\ndevices: the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) and the spectral form factor\n(SFF).

Such models combined with fairly well understood physics like\nthe quark substructure of the nucleon and the nuclear structure (form factor\nand/or spin response function), permit the evaluation of the event rate for\nLSP-nucleus elastic scattering. The thus obtained event rates are, however,\nvery low or even undetectable.

The Lagrangian or the action describing the\ncorresponding interactions is invariant under certain gauge transformations.\nThis symmetry is reflected in terms of the Ward-Green-Takahashi (or the\nSlavnov-Taylor) identities which relate various Green functions among each\nother, and the Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformations which relate a Green\nfunction in a particular gauge to it in an arbitrary covariant one. As an\noutcome, all physical observables should be independent of the choice of the\ncovariant gauge parameter. The most systematic scheme to solve quantum field\ntheories (QFT) is perturbation theory where the above-mentioned identities are\nsatisfied at every order of approximation. This feature is exploited highly\nusefully as a verification of the results obtained after time- and\neffort-consuming exercises. As it stands, not all natural phenomena are\nrealized in the perturbative regime of QFTs. Therefore, one is inevitably led\nto make efforts to solve these theories in a non perturbative fashion. A\nnatural starting point for such studies in the continuum are the\nSchwinger-Dyson Equations (SDE). One of the most undesirable features\nassociated with their non perturbative truncation is the loss of highly and\nrightly esteemed gauge invariance rendering the predictions less reliable.\nArguably, the only hope we have to recuperate the credibility of the results is\nto employ only such truncation schemes which yield predictions that match onto\nthe blindly reliable perturbative ones at every order of approximation.

Formalism and main results Abstract: We develop a formalism for particle production in a field theory coupled to a\nstrong time-dependent external source. An example of such a theory is the Color\nGlass Condensate. We derive a formula, in terms of cut vacuum-vacuum Feynman\ngraphs, for the probability of producing a given number of particles. This\nformula is valid to all orders in the coupling constant. The distribution of\nmultiplicities is non--Poissonian, even in the classical approximation. We\ninvestigate an alternative method of calculating the mean multiplicity. At\nleading order, the average multiplicity can be expressed in terms of retarded\nsolutions of classical equations of motion. We demonstrate that the average\nmultiplicity at {\\it next-to-leading order} can be formulated as an initial\nvalue problem by solving equations of motion for small fluctuation fields with\nretarded boundary conditions. The variance of the distribution can be\ncalculated in a similar fashion. Our formalism therefore provides a framework\nto compute from first principles particle production in proton-nucleus and\nnucleus-nucleus collisions beyond leading order in the coupling constant and to\nall orders in the source density. We also provide a transparent interpretation\n(in conventional field theory language) of the well known\nAbramovsky-Gribov-Kancheli (AGK) cancellations.

These applications emphasise the qualitative importance of the\nmomentum-dependent dressing of elementary Schwinger functions in QCD, which\nprovides a unifying connection between disparate phenomena. They provide a\nsolid foundation for an extension of the approach to nonzero temperature and\nchemical potential. The essential, formal elements of this application are\ndescribed and four contemporary studies employed to exemplify the method and\nits efficacy. They study the demarcation of the phase boundary for\ndeconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration, the calculation of bulk\nthermodynamic properties of the quark-gluon plasma and the response of pi- and\nrho-meson observables to T and mu. Along the way a continuum order parameter\nfor deconfinement is introduced, an anticorrelation between the response of\nmasses and decay constants to T and their response to mu elucidated, and a\n(T,mu)-mirroring of the slow approach of bulk thermodynamic quantities to their\nultrarelativistic limit highlighted. These effects too are tied to the\nmomentum-dependent dressing of the elementary Schwinger functions. \n\n"}

Models with two mass scales illustrate\nhow effects of long-distance pion physics must be removed from the coefficients\nthat encode short-distance physics. The modified effective range expansion\nshows that treating pions perturbatively, as in the PDS power counting, limits\nthe radius of convergence of the EFT.

The breakdown of the\neffective field theory occurs for momenta of order 300 MeV, even using the\nmodified effective range expansion.

The interaction results into the emergence\nof elementary excitations of space - inertons - surrounding the particle. It is\nassumed that such a motion leads not only to the spatial oscillation of the\nparticle along a path but to the oscillation of the particle centre-of-mass as\nwell. This phenomenon culminating in the anisotropic pulsation of the particle\nis associated with the notion of spin. The particle-space interaction is\ntreated as the origin of the matter waves, which are identified with the\nparticle inertia and inertons surrounding the moving particle are considered as\ncarriers of its inert properties. Inertons are also identified with real\ncarriers of the gravitational interaction and the range of the particle\ngravitational potential is evaluated by the inerton cloud amplitude\n$\\Lambda=\\lambda c/v$, where $\\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength, $c$ and\n$v$ are the velocity of light and the particle respectively.
