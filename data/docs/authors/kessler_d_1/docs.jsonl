We\nfind that the critical behavior caused by this elastic interaction belongs to\nthe mean-field universality class, in which the critical exponents for the\nspontaneous magnetization and the susceptibility are $\\beta = 1/2$ and $\\gamma\n= 1$, respectively. Furthermore, the spin-spin correlation function is a\nconstant at long distances, and it does not show an exponential decay in\ncontrast to short-range models. The value of the correlation function at long\ndistances shows different size-dependences: $O(1/N)$, $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$, and\nconstant for temperatures above, at, and below the critical temperature,\nrespectively.

A similar effect emerges in statistical physics, where the force\nacting, e.g., on colloidal particles immersed in a binary liquid mixture is\naffected by the classical thermal fluctuations occurring in the surrounding\nmedium. The resulting Casimir-like force acquires universal features upon\napproaching a critical point of the medium and becomes long-ranged at\ncriticality. In turn, this universality allows one to investigate theoretically\nthe temperature dependence of the force via representative models and to\nstringently test the corresponding predictions in experiments.

Many low energy probes such as transport,\nSTM and ARPES measured strong anisotropy of the electronic states akin to the\nnematic order in a liquid crystal, but there is no consensus on its physical\norigin, and a three dimensional picture of electronic states and its relations\nto the optical conductivity in the magnetic state is lacking. Using a first\nprinciples approach, we obtained the experimentally observed magnetic moment,\noptical conductivity, and the anisotropy of the electronic states. The theory\nconnects ARPES, which measures one particle electronic states, optical\nspectroscopy, probing the particle hole excitations of the solid and neutron\nscattering which measures the magnetic moment. We predict a manifestation of\nthe anisotropy in the optical conductivity, and we show that the magnetic phase\narises from the paramagnetic phase by a large gain of the Hund's rule coupling\nenergy and a smaller loss of kinetic energy, indicating that iron pnictides\nrepresent a new class of compounds where the nature of magnetism is\nintermediate between the spin density wave of almost independent particles, and\nthe antiferromagnetic state of local moments. \n\n"}

Usual models introduce nonlinearities in the\nmacroscopic dynamics of the ecosystem that lead to different stable attractors\namong which the shift takes place.

One of the major achievements\nof this thesis is to prove that these two operational approaches are\nequivalent.\n  However operational approaches are somewhat unsatisfying by themselves. To\nprovide a definition of time observables which is not linked to a particular\nmeasurement scheme we employ the decoherent, or consistent, histories approach\nto quantum theory.

Entanglement is the most prominent of these correlations, but in many\ncases unentangled states exhibit nonclassical behavior too. Thus distinguishing\nquantum correlations other than entanglement provides a better division between\nthe quantum and classical worlds, especially when considering mixed states.\nHere we review different notions of classical and quantum correlations\nquantified by quantum discord and other related measures. In the first half, we\nreview the mathematical properties of the measures of quantum correlations,\nrelate them to each other, and discuss the classical-quantum division that is\ncommon among them.

To reliably detect temporal\ncommunities we need not only to find a good community partition in a given\nsnapshot but also ensure that it bears some similarity to the partition(s)\nfound in immediately preceding snapshots.

It is also known\nthat genealogical trees for populations under selection are quantifiably\ndifferent from those expected under neutral evolution and described\nstatistically by Kingman's coalescent. While differences in the statistical\nstructure of genealogies have long been used as a test for the presence of\nselection, the full extent of the information that they contain has not been\nexploited. Here we shall demonstrate that the shape of the reconstructed\ngenealogical tree for a moderately large number of random genomic samples taken\nfrom a fitness diverse, but otherwise unstructured asexual population can be\nused to predict the relative fitness of individuals within the sample. To\nachieve this we define a heuristic algorithm, which we test in silico using\nsimulations of a Wright-Fisher model for a realistic range of mutation rates\nand selection strength. Our inferred fitness ranking is based on a linear\ndiscriminator which identifies rapidly coalescing lineages in the reconstructed\ntree. Inferred fitness ranking correlates strongly with actual fitness, with a\ngenome in the top 10% ranked being in the top 20% fittest with false discovery\nrate of 0.1-0.3 depending on the mutation/selection parameters.

On\nthe square lattice it has been established numerically that the collapse\ntransition of each model lies in a different universality class.

A particularly simple and\nelegant model of wave-pinning has been proposed by Edelstein-Keshet and\ncoworkers (Biop. J., 2008).

By\nnumerically evolving gene regulatory networks, the proportionality between the\nphenotypic variances of epigenetic and genetic origins is confirmed. The former\nis given by the variance of the phenotypic fluctuation due to noise in the\ndevelopmental process; and the latter, by the variance of the phenotypic\nfluctuation due to genetic mutation. The relationship suggests a link between\nrobustness to noise and to mutation, since robustness can be defined by the\nsharpness of the distribution of the phenotype. Next, the proportionality\nbetween the variances is demonstrated to also hold over expressions of\ndifferent genes (phenotypic traits) when the system acquires robustness through\nthe evolution.

To this end, we define a simplified\nlubrication force and systematically vary the range $h_c$ of this interaction.\nFor fixed $h_c$ a cross-over is seen from a Newtonian flow regime at small\nstrain rates to inertia-dominated flow at larger strain rates. The same\ncross-over is observed as a function of the lubrication range $h_c$. At the\nsame time, but only at high densities close to jamming, particle velocity as\nwell as local density distributions are unaffected by changes in the\nlubrication range -- they are candidates for \"universal\" behavior.

The density functional portion of the calculation uses a plane wave\nbasis set within the projector augmented wave method enabling study of systems\nwith large, complex unit cells.

However, the cause\nand the mechanism by which such collective changes of direction occur are not\nfully understood yet.

Our\napproach enables us to analyze changes in the individual behavior of every\ngroup member and reveal the emergent dynamics of turning.

Stochastic theories that treat semi-Markov age-dependent\nprocesses using e.g., the Bellman-Harris equation, do not resolve a\npopulation's age-structure and are unable to quantify population-size\ndependencies.

We study this general mechanism of\n\"collective guidance\" computationally with models that integrate stochastic\ndynamics for individual cells with biochemical reactions within the cells, and\ndiffusion of chemical signals between the cells. We show that if clusters of\ncells use the well-known local excitation, global inhibition (LEGI) mechanism\nto sense chemoattractant gradients, the speed of the cell cluster becomes\nnon-monotonic in the cluster's size - clusters either larger or smaller than an\noptimal size will have lower speed. We argue that the cell cluster speed is a\ncrucial readout of how the cluster processes chemotactic signal; both\namplification and adaptation will alter the behavior of cluster speed as a\nfunction of size. We also show that, contrary to the assumptions of earlier\ntheories, collective guidance does not require persistent cell-cell contacts\nand strong short range adhesion to function. If cell-cell adhesion is absent,\nand the cluster cohesion is instead provided by a co-attraction mechanism, e.g.\nchemotaxis toward a secreted molecule, collective guidance may still function.\nHowever, new behaviors, such as cluster rotation, may also appear in this case.\nTogether, the combination of co-attraction and adaptation allows for collective\nguidance that is robust to varying chemoattractant concentrations while not\nrequiring strong cell-cell adhesion. \n\n"}

There it had been found that cooperativity can lead to\nfirst-order spreading/extinction transitions. However, due to the rapid mixing\nimplied by the mean field assumption, first order transitions required non-zero\ninitial densities of sick individuals.

When\nchemical fluctuations grow without bound an absolute instability occurs and a\nsecond-order order-disorder phase transition may be inferred.

Here, as a model to\ndescribe such phenomena, we investigate a Langevin equation with diffusivity\nfluctuating between a fast and a slow state. We assume that the sojourn time\ndistributions of these two states are given by power laws. It is shown that,\nfor a non-equilibrium ensemble, the ensemble-averaged mean square displacement\n(MSD) shows transient subdiffusion. In contrast, the time-averaged MSD shows\nnormal diffusion, but an effective diffusion coefficient transiently shows\naging behavior. The propagator is non-Gaussian for short time, and converges to\na Gaussian distribution in a long time limit; this convergence to Gaussian is\nextremely slow for some parameter values. For equilibrium ensembles, both\nensemble-averaged and time-averaged MSDs show only normal diffusion, and thus\nwe cannot detect any traces of the fluctuating diffusivity with these MSDs.\nTherefore, as an alternative approach to characterize the fluctuating\ndiffusivity, the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the time-averaged MSD is\nutilized, and it is shown that the RSD exhibits slow relaxation as a signature\nof the long-time correlation in the fluctuating diffusivity. Furthermore, it is\nshown that the RSD is related to a non-Gaussian parameter of the propagator.

On the other hand, natural selection tends to decrease the rate of\nevolution by decreasing the chance of recombination between immigrants and\nresident individuals.

Most of these are\neffectively \"fabric evolution models\" (FEMs) based on a stress rule connecting\nthe bulk stress to a rank-2 microstructural fabric tensor Q and a closed\ntime-evolution equation for Q. In dense suspensions most of the stress comes\nfrom short-ranged pairwise steric or lubrication interactions at near-contacts,\nso a natural choice for Q is the deviatoric 2nd moment of the distribution P(p)\nof the near-contact orientations p. Here we test directly whether a closed\ntime-evolution equation for such a Q can exist for inertialess non-Brownian\nhard spheres in a Newtonian solvent. We perform extensive numerical simulations\nfor the evolution of P(p) under shear reversal, providing a stringent test for\nFEMs. We consider a generic class of these as defined by Hand (1962)\nconstrained only by frame indifference. Motivated by the small microstructural\nanisotropy in the dense regime, we start with linear models and successively\nconsider increasingly nonlinear ones. Based on these results we suggest that no\nclosed FEM properly describes the dynamics of Q under reversal. We attribute\nthis to the fact that Q gives a poor description of the microstructure during\nlarge parts of the microstructural evolution following shear reversal.\nSpecifically, the truncation of P(p) at 2nd spherical harmonic level describes\ntwo-lobed distributions of near-contact orientations, whereas on reversal we\nobserve distributions that are markedly four-lobed; moreover dP/dt (p) has\noblique axes, not collinear with those of Q in the shear plane.

Although simple, the resulting local master equation (LME) is known to\nbe thermodynamically inconsistent. Otherwise, one may always obtain a\nconsistent \\textit{global} master equation (GME) by working on the energy basis\nof the full interacting Hamiltonian. Here, we consider a two-node `quantum\nwire' connected to two heat baths. The stationary solution of the LME and GME\nare obtained and benchmarked against the exact result.

The expected thermal emission and\nwavelength dependent dimming is derived for different orbital parameters and\ngeometries, including dust that is optically thick to stellar radiation, and\nfor a size distribution of dust with realistic optical properties. We first\nconsider dust distributed evenly around the orbit, then show how to derive its\nuneven distribution from the optical light curve and to predict light curves at\ndifferent wavelengths. The fractional luminosity of an even distribution is\napproximately the level of dimming times stellar radius divided by distance\nfrom the star at transit. Non-detection of dust thermal emission for KIC8462852\nthus provides a lower limit on the transit distance to complement the 0.6au\nupper limit imposed by 0.4day dips. Unless the dust distribution is optically\nthick, the putative 16% century-long secular dimming must have disappeared\nbefore the WISE 12micron measurement in 2010, and subsequent 4.5micron\nobservations require transits at >0.05au.

This web of vague analogies hints\nat a deeper common mathematical structure. I suggest that the Price equation\nexpresses that underlying universal structure. The abstract Price equation\ndescribes dynamics as the change between two sets. One component of dynamics\nexpresses the change in the frequency of things, holding constant the values\nassociated with things. The other component of dynamics expresses the change in\nthe values of things, holding constant the frequency of things. The separation\nof frequency from value generalizes Shannon's separation of the frequency of\nsymbols from the meaning of symbols in information theory. The Price equation's\ngeneralized separation of frequency and value reveals a few simple invariances\nthat define universal geometric aspects of change.

Furthermore, we\ncalculate numerically the spectra of collective modes for all states\nparticipating in the phase diagram, and analyze critical properties of\nGoldstone modes at all second order and first order transitions between\ndisordered, uniform and periodic states. In particular it is shown that the\nGoldstone mode softens as the underlying soliton lattice becomes more and more\ndilute. \n\n"}

It was recently shown that conventional\nmean field nucleation theory overestimates the rate of second layer nucleation\nby a factor that is proportional to the number of times a given site is visited\nby an adatom during its residence time on the island. In the presence of strong\nstep edge barriers this factor can be large, leading to a substantial error in\nprevious attempts to experimentally determine barrier energies from the onset\nof second layer nucleation.

As examples, we apply our analysis to a harmonic chain and different\ntypes of Ising spin chains. For the harmonic chain, which successfully\ndescribes thermal properties of insulating solids, our approach gives a first\nquantitative estimate of the minimal length scale on which temperature can\nexist: This length scale is found to be constant for temperatures above the\nDebye temperature and proportional to $T^{-3}$ below. We finally apply the\nharmonic chain model to various materials of relevance for technical\napplications and discuss the results.

These models exhibit a continuous phase\ntransition from an active phase into an absorbing phase which belongs to the\nuniversality class of the models with the parity conservation. However, when we\nbreak the symmetry between the absorbing states by introducing a\nsymmetry-breaking field, Monte Carlo simulations show that the system goes back\nto the conventional directed percolation universality class. In terms of domain\nwall language, the parity conservation is not affected by the presence of the\nsymmetry-breaking field. So the symmetry between the absorbing states rather\nthan the conservation laws plays an essential role in determining the\nuniversality class. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations for the various\ninterface dynamics between different absorbing states, which yield new\nuniversal dynamic exponents.

We also study the motion of the soliton a in long\nsystem, concluding that, in the cases of both the positive and negative mass,\nit moves freely, provided that its amplitude is below a certain critical value;\nabove it, the soliton's velocity decreases due to the interaction with the OL.\nAt a late stage, the damped motion becomes chaotic.

In these notes, we discuss at an elementary level\nthree themes concerning interface dynamics that play a role in pattern forming\nsystems: (i) We briefly review three examples of systems in which the normal\ngrowth velocity is proportional to the gradient of a bulk field which itself\nobeys a Laplace or diffusion type of equation (solidification, viscous fingers\nand streamers), and then discuss why the Mullins-Sekerka instability is common\nto all such gradient systems. (ii) Secondly, we discuss how underlying an\neffective interface description of systems with smooth fronts or transition\nzones, is the assumption that the relaxation time of the appropriate order\nparameter field(s) in the front region is much smaller than the time scale of\nthe evolution of interfacial patterns. Using standard arguments we illustrate\nthat this is generally so for fronts that separate two (meta)stable phases: in\nsuch cases, the relaxation is typically exponential, and the relaxation time in\nthe usual models goes to zero in the limit in which the front width vanishes.\n(iii) We finally summarize recent results that show that so-called ``pulled''\nor ``linear marginal stability'' fronts which propagate into unstable states\nhave a very slow universal power law relaxation. This slow relaxation makes the\nusual ``moving boundary'' or ``effective interface'' approximation for problems\nwith thin fronts, like streamers, impossible. \n\n"}

We find that the fit genotypes that appear\nalong a trajectory are a subset of suitably defined fitness \\textit{records},\nand exploit several results from the record theory for non-identically\ndistributed random variables. The genotypes that contribute to the trajectory\nare those records that are not \\textit{bypassed} by superior records arising\nfurther away from the initial population. Several conjectures concerning the\nstatistics of bypassing are extracted from numerical simulations. In\nparticular, for the one-dimensional model, we propose a simple relation between\nthe bypassing probability and the dynamic exponent which describes the scaling\nof the typical evolution time with genome size. The latter can be determined\nexactly in terms of the extremal properties of the fitness distribution. \n\n"}

Abstract: Motivated by the results of recent laboratory experiments (Yoshida et al.\nNature, 424, 303-306 (2003)) as well as many earlier field observations that\nevolutionary changes can take place in ecosystems over relatively short\necological time scales, several ``unified'' mathematical models of evolutionary\necology have been developed over the last few years with the aim of describing\nthe statistical properties of data related to the evolution of ecosystems.\nMoreover, because of the availability of sufficiently fast computers, it has\nbecome possible to carry out detailed computer simulations of these models. For\nthe sake of completeness and to put these recent developments in the proper\nperspective, we begin with a brief summary of some older models of ecological\nphenomena and evolutionary processes.

Selection occurs via\nmultispecies, stochastic population dynamics with reproduction probabilities\nthat depend nonlinearly on the population densities of all species resident in\nthe community. New species are introduced through mutation. Both models are\namenable to exact linear stability analysis, and we compare the analytic\nresults with large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, obtaining the\npopulation size as a function of an average interspecies interaction strength.\nOver time, the models self-optimize through mutation and selection to\napproximately maximize a community fitness function, subject only to\nconstraints internal to the particular model. If the interspecies interactions\nare randomly distributed on an interval including positive values, the system\nevolves toward self-sustaining, mutualistic communities. In contrast, for the\npredator-prey case the matrix of interactions is antisymmetric, and a nonzero\npopulation size must be sustained by an external resource. Time series of the\ndiversity and population size for both models show approximate 1/f noise and\npower-law distributions for the lifetimes of communities and species. For the\nmutualistic model, these two lifetime distributions have the same exponent,\nwhile their exponents are different for the predator-prey model. The difference\nis probably due to greater resilience toward mass extinctions in the food-web\nlike communities produced by the predator-prey model. \n\n"}

Introducing spatial degrees of freedom\nand allowing for stochastic fluctuations generically invalidates the classical,\ndeterministic mean-field picture. Already within mean-field theory, however,\nspatial constraints, modeling locally limited resources, lead to the emergence\nof a continuous active-to-absorbing state phase transition. Field-theoretic\narguments, supported by Monte Carlo simulation results, indicate that this\ntransition, which represents an extinction threshold for the predator\npopulation, is governed by the directed percolation universality class. In the\nactive state, where predators and prey coexist, the classical center\nsingularities with associated population cycles are replaced by either nodes or\nfoci. In the vicinity of the stable nodes, the system is characterized by\nessentially stationary localized clusters of predators in a sea of prey. Near\nthe stable foci, however, the stochastic lattice Lotka-Volterra system displays\ncomplex, correlated spatio-temporal patterns of competing activity fronts.\nCorrespondingly, the population densities in our numerical simulations turn out\nto oscillate irregularly in time, with amplitudes that tend to zero in the\nthermodynamic limit. Yet in finite systems these oscillatory fluctuations are\nquite persistent, and their features are determined by the intrinsic\ninteraction rates rather than the initial conditions. We emphasize the\nrobustness of this scenario with respect to various model perturbations. \n\n"}
