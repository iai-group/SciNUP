Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

Such stars are thought to be ejected through dynamical\ninteractions near the massive black hole (MBH) in the Galactic center. Three\nscenarios have been suggested for their ejection; binary disruption by a MBH,\nscattering by inspiraling IMBH and scattering by stellar BHs close to MBH.\nThese scenarios involve different stellar populations in the Galactic center.\nHere we use observations of the Galactic center stellar population together\nwith dynamical and evolutionary arguments to obtain strong constraints on the\nnature and origin of HVSs. We show that the IMBH inspiral scenario requires too\nmany (O(10^3)) main sequence B stars to exist close to the MBH (<0.01 pc) at\nthe time of inspiral, where current observations show O(10) such stars.\nScattering by SBHs also require too many B stars to be observed in the GC, but\nit may contribute a small fraction of the currently observed HVSs. The binary\ndisruption scenario is still consistent with current observations. In addition\nit is shown that recently suggested signatures for HVSs origin such as\nhypervelocity binaries and slow rotating HVSs are much weaker than suggested\nand require too large statistics. In addition, we show that due to the\nconditions close to the MBH most binary star systems are not expected to\nsurvive for long in this region. Consequently, unique stellar populations that\nrequire long evolution in binaries are not expected to be ejected as HVSs in\nthe BHs scattering mechanisms (this may also be related to to the recently\nobserved asymmetry in the velocity distribution of HVSs). \n\n"}

We begin\nin this paper with a derivation of the self-force on a compact object moving in\nthe background spacetime of a supermassive black hole. The EFT approach\nutilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are the\nsize of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the background\nspacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as an\neffective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. Ultraviolet\ndivergences are regularized using Hadamard's {\\it partie finie} to isolate the\nnon-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part. The latter is\nconstructed from a momentum space representation for the graviton retarded\npropagator and is evaluated using dimensional regularization in which only\nlogarithmic divergences are relevant for renormalizing the parameters of the\ntheory. As a first important application of this framework we explicitly derive\nthe first order self-force given by Mino, Sasaki, Tanaka, Quinn and Wald. Going\nbeyond the point particle approximation, to account for the finite size of the\nobject, we demonstrate that for extreme mass ratio inspirals the motion of a\ncompact object is affected by tidally induced moments at $O(\\epsilon^4)$, in\nthe form of an Effacement Principle. The relatively large radius-to-mass ratio\nof a white dwarf star allows for these effects to be enhanced until the white\ndwarf becomes tidally disrupted, a potentially $O(\\epsilon^2)$ process, or\nplunges into the supermassive black hole. This work provides a new foundation\nfor further exploration of higher order self force corrections, gravitational\nradiation and spinning compact objects. \n\n"}

Abstract: Most multi-planetary systems are characterized by hot-Jupiters close to their\ncentral star, moving on eccentric orbits. From a dynamical point of view,\ncompact multi-planetary systems form a specific class of the general N-body\nproblem (where N>=3). Moreover, extrasolar planets are found in prograde orbits\nabout their host star, and often in mean motion resonances (MMR). In a first\nstep, we study theoretically a new stabilizing mechanism suitable for compact\ntwo-planet systems. This mechanism involves counter-revolving orbits forming a\nretrograde MMR. In a second step, we investigate the feasibility of planetary\nsystems hosting counter-revolving planets. Dynamical stability, observations,\nand formation processes of these systems are analyzed and discussed. To\ncharacterize the dynamical behavior of multi-dimensional planetary systems, we\napply our technique of global dynamics analysis based on the MEGNO indicator\n(Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits) that provides the fine\nstructure of the phase space. In a few cases of possible counter-revolving\nconfigurations, we carry out new fits to the observations using the Pikaia\ngenetic algorithm. A statistical study of the stability in the neighborhood of\ndifferent observed, planetary-systems is completed using a Monte-Carlo method.\nWe analyse the observational data for the HD73526 planetary system and find\nthat counter-revolving configurations may be consistent with the observational\ndata. We highlight the fine and characteristic structure of retrograde MMRs. We\ndemonstrate that retrograde resonances open a family of stabilizing mechanisms\ninvolving new apsidal precession behaviors. Considering two possible formation\nmechanisms (free-floating planet and Slingshot model), we conclude that\ncounter-revolving configurations are feasible. \n\n"}

In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that\nthe gravitational field produced by the disc itself (the disc's self-gravity)\nis an important ingredient in the models, especially in the context of\nprotostellar discs and of AGN discs. Indeed, it appears that in many cases (and\nespecially in the colder outer parts of the disc) the development of\ngravitational instabilities can be one of the main agents in the redistribution\nof angular momentum. In some cases, the instability can be strong enough to\nlead to the formation of gravitationally bound clumps within the disc, and thus\nto determine the disc fragmentation. As a result, progress in our understanding\nof the dynamics of self-gravitating discs is essential to understand the\nprocesses that lead to the feeding of both young stars and of supermassive\nblack holes in AGN.

We characterize bars and their host\ngalaxies and look for relations between the presence of a bar and the\nproperties of the underlying disk. We investigate whether the fraction and\nproperties of bars in clusters are different from their counterparts in the\nfield. The total optical bar fraction in the redshift range z=0.4-0.8 (median\nz=0.60), averaged over the entire sample, is 25% (20% for strong bars). For the\ncluster and field subsamples, we measure bar fractions of 24% and 29%,\nrespectively. We find that bars in clusters are on average longer than in the\nfield and preferentially found close to the cluster center, where the bar\nfraction is somewhat higher (~31%) than at larger distances (~18%).

The regions have overdensities that\ndeviate by (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)sigma from the cosmic mean, where sigma is the\nrms mass fluctuation on a scale of ~20Mpc/h at z=1.5. The simulations have mass\nresolution of up to 10^6 Msun/h, cover the entire range of large-scale\nenvironments and allow extrapolation of statistics to the entire 500 (Mpc/h)^3\nMillennium volume. They include gas cooling, photoheating from an ionising\nbackground, SNe feedback and winds, but no AGN. We find that the specific SFR\ndensity at z <~ 10 varies systematically from region to region by up to an\norder of magnitude, but the global value, averaged over all volumes, reproduces\nobservational data. Massive, compact galaxies, similar to those observed in the\nGOODS fields, form in the overdense regions as early as z=6, but do not appear\nin the underdense regions until z~3. These environmental variations are not\ncaused by a dependence of the star formation properties on environment, but\nrather by a strong variation of the halo mass function from one environment to\nanother, with more massive haloes forming preferentially in the denser regions.\nAt all epochs, stars form most efficiently in haloes of circular velocity ~ 250\nkm/s. However, the star formation history exhibits a form of \"downsizing\" (even\nin the absence of AGN): the stars comprising massive galaxies at z=0 have\nmostly formed by z=1-2, whilst those comprising smaller galaxies typically form\nat later times. However, additional feedback is required to limit star\nformation in massive galaxies at late times. \n\n"}

Mid-infrared observations have revealed the nature of some of the\nmolecules in the MOLsphere, some being the precursor of dust.

Methods: We obtained AO images with the VLT/NACO instrument,\ntaking advantage of the \"cube\" mode of the CONICA camera to record separately a\nlarge number of short-exposure frames. This allowed us to adopt a \"lucky\nimaging\" approach for the data reduction, and obtain diffraction-limited images\nover the spectral range 1.04-2.17 $\\mu$m in 10 narrow-band filters.

We find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in any\ntidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the cluster\nlives long enough for the overdensities to build up.\n  The distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the cluster\ncentre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and the\nstrength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time,\nwhile for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causing\na periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distance\noscillate with time. We provide an approximation for estimating the distance of\nthe overdensities in this case.\n  We describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidal\ntails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal field\non the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous. Moreover, we conclude that a\npericentre passage or a disk shock is not the direct origin of an overdensity\nwithin a tidal tail.

The\ncollapsed, shock-heated stellar envelope settles into a thick, low-mass\nequatorial disk embedded within a massive, pressure-supported atmosphere.

If these\nsimulated winds accurately represent winds in the real Universe, then material\npreviously ejected in winds provides the dominant source of gas infall for new\nstar formation at redshifts z<1. This recycled wind accretion, or wind mode,\nprovides a third physically distinct accretion channel in addition to the \"hot\"\nand \"cold\" modes emphasised in recent theoretical studies. Because of the\ninteraction between outflows and gas in and around halos, the recycling\ntimescale of wind material (t_rec) is shorter in higher-mass systems, which\nreside in denser gaseous environments. In these simulations, this differential\nrecycling plays a central role in shaping the present-day galaxy stellar mass\nfunction (GSMF). If we remove all particles that were ever ejected in a wind,\nthen the predicted GSMFs are much steeper than observed; galaxy masses are\nsuppressed both by the direct removal of gas and by the hydrodynamic heating of\ntheir surroundings, which reduces subsequent infall. With wind recycling\nincluded, the simulation that incorporates our favoured momentum-driven wind\nscalings reproduces the observed GSMF for stellar masses 10^9 < M < 5x10^10\nMsolar. At higher masses, wind recycling leads to excessive galaxy masses and\nexcessive star formation rates relative to observations. In these massive\nsystems, some quenching mechanism must suppress the re-accretion of gas ejected\nfrom star-forming galaxies. In short, as has long been anticipated, the form of\nthe GSMF is governed by outflows; the unexpected twist here for our simulated\nwinds is that it is not primarily the ejection of material but how the ejected\nmaterial is re-accreted that governs the GSMF. \n\n"}

It is shown that even without a detailed calculation of the\npressure anisotropy or the heat fluxes, one finds the macroscale dynamics to be\ngenerically unstable to microscale Alfvenically polarized fluctuations. Two\ninstabilities are considered in detail: the parallel firehose instability\n(including the finite-Larmor-radius effects that determine the fastest growing\nmode) and the gyrothermal instability (GTI).

{"id": "1001.2446", "contents": "Title: The mode of gas accretion onto star-forming galaxies Abstract: It is argued that galaxies like ours sustain their star formation by\ntransferring gas from an extensive corona to the star-forming disc. The\ntransfer is effected by the galactic fountain -- cool clouds that are shot up\nfrom the plane to kiloparsec heights above the plane. The Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability strips gas from these clouds. If the pressure and the the\nmetallicity of the corona are high enough, the stripped gas causes a similar\nmass of coronal gas to condense in the cloud's wake. Hydrodynamical simulations\nof cloud-corona interaction are presented. These confirm the existence of a\ncritical ablation rate above which the corona is condensed, and imply that for\nthe likely parameters of the Galactic corona this rate lies near the actual\nablation rate of clouds. In external galaxies trails of HI behind individual\nclouds will not be detectable, although the integrated emission from all such\ntrails should be significant.

This widely used approximation assumes that the mass\nfunction can be expressed as a function of the matter density omega_m and the\nrms linear density fluctuation sigma only, with no explicit dependence on the\nproperties of dark energy or redshift. In order to test this hypothesis we run\na series of 15 high-resolution N-body simulations for different cosmological\nmodels. These consists of three LCDM cosmologies best fitting WMAP-1, 3 and 5\nyears data, and three toy-models characterized by a Ratra-Peebles quintessence\npotential with different slopes and amounts of dark energy density. These toy\nmodels have very different evolutionary histories at the background and linear\nlevel, but share the same sigma8 value. For each of these models we measure the\nmass function from catalogues of halos identified in the simulations using the\nFriend-of-Friend (FoF) algorithm. We find redshift dependent deviations from a\nuniversal behaviour, well above numerical uncertainties and of non-stochastic\norigin, which are correlated with the linear growth factor of the investigated\ncosmologies. Using the spherical collapse as guidance, we show that such\ndeviations are caused by the cosmology dependence of the non-linear collapse\nand virialization process. For practical applications, we provide a fitting\nformula of the mass function accurate to 5 percents over the all range of\ninvestigated cosmologies. We also derive an empirical relation between the FoF\nlinking parameter and the virial overdensity which can account for most of the\ndeviations from an exact universal behavior.

Seemingly\nunrelated observations have discovered that there is a lopsided stellar disk of\nunknown origin orbiting the BH in M31, and possibly many other systems. We show\nthat these nominally independent puzzles are in fact closely related.\nMulti-scale simulations of gas inflow from galactic to BH scales show that when\nsufficient gas is driven towards a BH, gravitational instabilities form a\nlopsided, eccentric disk that propagates inwards from larger radii. The\nlopsided stellar disk exerts a strong torque on the remaining gas, driving\ninflows that fuel the growth of the BH and produce quasar-level luminosities.\nThe same disk can produce significant obscuration along many sightlines and\nthus may be the putative 'torus' invoked to explain obscured active galactic\nnuclei and the cosmic X-ray background.

If so, it hosts the closest known neutron\nstar, and its existence implies a great abundance of similar systems and a rate\nof white-dwarf neutron-star mergers similar to that of the type Ia supernova\nrate. Here, we present high signal-to-noise spectra of SDSS 1257+5428, which\nconfirm an independent finding that the system is in fact composed of two white\ndwarfs, one relatively cool and with low mass, and the other hotter and more\nmassive. With this, the demographics and merger rate are no longer puzzling\n(various factors combine to lower the latter by more than two orders of\nmagnitude). We show that the spectra are fit well with a combination of two\nhydrogen model atmospheres, as long as the lines of the higher-gravity\ncomponent are broadened significantly relative to what is expected from just\npressure broadening. Interpreting this additional broadening as due to\nrotation, the inferred spin period is short, about 1 minute. Similarly rapid\nrotation is only seen in accreting white dwarfs that are magnetic; empirically,\nit appears that in non-magnetized white dwarfs, accreted angular momentum is\nlost by nova explosions before it can be transferred to the white dwarf. This\nsuggests that the massive white dwarf in SDSS 1257+5428 is magnetic as well,\nwith B~10^5 G. Alternatively, the broadening seen in the spectral lines could\nbe due to a stronger magnetic field, of ~10^6 G. The two models could be\ndistinguished by further observations. \n\n"}

The radiative transfer\nformulation took full account of emission, absorption, re-emission, Faraday\nrotation and Faraday conversion explicitly. High time-resolution intensity maps\nwere generated, frame-by-frame, to track the spatial hydrodynamical and\nradiative properties of the evolving jets.

In our first\npaper (Crimier et al. 2010), we determined the physical structure\n(density-temperature radial profiles) of the protostellar envelopes. Here, we\nstudy the CO depletion and N2H+ deuteration. We observed the millimeter lines\nof C18O, C17O, N2H+ and N2D+ toward the protostars using the IRAM 30m\ntelescope. Based on these observations, we derived the C18O, N2H+ and N2D+\nradial abundance profiles across their envelopes using a radiative transfer\ncode. In addition, we modeled the chemistry of the protostellar envelopes. All\nthe C18O 1-0 maps are well fit assuming that the C18O abundance decreases\ninwards within the protostellar envelope until the gas and dust reach the CO\nevaporation temperature, 20-25K, where the CO is released back to the gas\nphase. The N2H+ deuterium fractionation in Class 0 IMs is\n[N2D+]/[N2H+]=0.005-0.014, two orders of magnitude higher than the elemental\n[D/H] value in the interstellar medium, but a factor of 10 lower than in\npre-stellar clumps. Chemical models account for the C18O and N2H+ observations\nif we assume the CO abundance is 2 times lower than the canonical value in the\ninner envelope. This could be the consequence of the CO being converted into\nCH3OH on the grain surfaces prior to the evaporation and/or the\nphotodissociation of CO by the stellar UV radiation. The deuterium\nfractionation is not fitted by chemical models. This discrepancy is very likely\ncaused by the simplicity of our model that assumes spherical geometry and\nneglects important phenomena like the effect of bipolar outflows and UV\nradiation from the star.

Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid.

We compare these analytic calculations to numerical simulations and\nuse them to develop a sub-grid model of BH growth that can be incorporated into\nsemi-analytic models or cosmological simulations. Both analytic calculations\nand simulations argue that the strongest torque on gas arises when\nnon-axisymmetric perturbations to the stellar gravitational potential produces\norbit crossings and shocks in the gas. This is true both at large radii ~0.01-1\nkpc, where bar-like modes dominate the non-axisymmetric potential, and at\nsmaller radii <10 pc, where a lopsided/eccentric disk dominates. The\ntraditional orbit crossing criterion is not always adequate to predict the\nlocations of, and inflow due to, shocks in gas+stellar disks with finite sound\nspeeds.

The photosphere remains in the outer 0.5Msun of the ejecta for up to\n~50d after explosion. As the photosphere reaches the edge of the helium core,\nthe SN luminosity drops by an amount mitigated by the progenitor radius and the\n56Ni mass. Synthetic light-curves exhibit a bell-shape morphology, evolving\nfaster for more compact progenitors, and with an earlier peak and narrower\nwidth in bluer filters.

The dominant radial boundary conditions require that the incident\ningoing and outgoing number densities be uniform with latitude, but the charge\nper particle must vary with latitude such that the incident charge densities\nvary in proportion to the radial electric field. The sub-dominant angular\nboundary conditions require specific forms of the incident number- and\ncharge-weighted angular motions. If the streams fall freely from outside the\nhorizon, then the prescribed angular conditions can be achieved by the charged\nstream, but not by the neutral stream. Thus, as in the case of an uncharged\nblack hole, the neutral stream must be considered to be delivered ad hoc to\njust above the inner horizon. \n\n"}

This lower limit of metallicity rules out the hypothesis that LAEs,\nso far observed at z~2, are extremely metal poor (Z<2x10^{-2} Z_{sun}) young\ngalaxies at the 4sigma level. This limit is higher than a simple extrapolation\nof the observed mass-metallicity relation of z~2 UV-selected galaxies toward\nlower masses (5x10^{8} M_{sun}), but roughly consistent with a recently\nproposed fundamental mass-metallicity relation when the LAEs' relatively low\nSFR is taken into account.

This is the first detection of a BAL,\nwhich is sometimes seen in powerful quasars with high accretion rates, in a BL\nLac object.

The main advantage of such approach is to avoid the\nnecessity of assuming an \\textit{ad hoc} parameterization of the SFH.

The main\ngoal of our analysis is to test whether or not the observed companion mass\nratio distribution (CMRD) as a function of primary star mass and star formation\nenvironment is consistent with having been drawn from the field star IMF. We\nconsider samples of companions for M dwarfs, solar type and intermediate mass\nstars, both in the field as well as clusters or associations, and compare them\nwith populations of binaries generated by random pairing from the assumed IMF\nfor a fixed primary mass. With regard to the field we can reject the hypothesis\nthat the CMRD was drawn from the IMF for different primary mass ranges: the\nobserved CMRDs show a larger number of equal-mass systems than predicted by the\nIMF. This is in agreement with fragmentation theories of binary formation. For\nthe open clusters {\\alpha} Persei and the Pleiades we also reject the IMF\nrandom- pairing hypothesis.

We integrate exactly all the field equations once,\nreducing them to first order nonlinear equations. For the simplest galileon,\nstatic solutions come on {\\it six} distinct branches. On one, a Dyson sphere\nsurrounds itself with a galileon hair, which far away looks like a hair of any\nBrans-Dicke field. The hair changes below the Vainshtein scale, where the extra\ngalileon terms dominate the minimal gradients of the field. Their hair looks\nmore like a fuzz, because the galileon terms are suppressed by the derivative\nof the volume determinant. It shuts off the `hair bunching' over the `angular'\n2-sphere. Hence the fuzz remains dilute even close to the source. This is\nreally why the Vainshtein's suppression of the modifications of gravity works\nclose to the source.

The broad CO emission is detected\nmore frequently from YSOs with bolometric luminosities of <15 Lsun than those\nwith >15 Lsun, and as with CO emission from CTTSs is attributed to the warm\n(~1000 K) inner AU of the disk. The CO emission from objects with high\nbolometric luminosity is produced in cooler (~320 K), narrow lines in 12CO and\nin rarer isotopologues.

The system consists of a (5+1)-dimensional model with a flux-stabilized\nsupersymmetric bulk coupled to non-supersymmetric matter localized on a\n(3+1)-dimensional positive-tension brane. We use recent techniques for\ncalculating how extra dimensions respond to changes in brane properties to show\n(at the classical level) that the low-energy 4D geometry is exactly flat,\nindependent of the value of the brane tensions. Its mechanism for doing so is\nthe transfer of stabilizing flux between the bulk and the branes. The UV\ncompletion of the model can arise at scales much larger than M, allowing the\ncalculation of quantum effects like the zero-point energy of very massive\nparticles in the vacuum. We find that brane-localized loops do not affect the\n4D curvature at all, but bulk loops can. These can be estimated on general\ngrounds and we show that supersymmetry dictates that they generate curvatures\nthat are generically of order m_KK^4/M_p^2.

Its interactions with Standard Model\nparticles can be described using a low-energy effective nonlinear chiral\nLagrangian supplemented by terms that restore approximate scale symmetry,\nyielding couplings of the pseudo-dilaton that differ from those of a Standard\nModel Higgs boson by fixed factors.

Implications for\n  the radii of Wolf-Rayet stars and luminous blue variables Abstract: (shortened) It has been proposed that the envelopes of luminous stars may be\nsubject to substantial radius inflation. The inflation effect has been\ndiscussed in relation to the radius problem of WR stars, but has yet failed to\nexplain the large observed radii of Galactic WR stars. We wish to obtain a\nphysical perspective of the inflation effect, and study the consequences for\nthe radii of WR stars, and LBVs. For WR stars the observed radii are up to an\norder of magnitude larger than predicted by theory, whilst S Doradus-type LBVs\nare subject to humongous radius variations, which remain as yet ill-explained.\nWe use a dual approach to investigate the envelope inflation, based on\nnumerical models for stars near the Eddington limit, and a new analytic\nformalism to describe the effect. An additional new aspect is that we take the\neffect of density inhomogeneities (clumping) within the outer stellar envelopes\ninto account. Due to the effect of clumping we are able to bring the observed\nWR radii in agreement with theory. Based on our new formalism, we find that the\nradial inflation is a function of a dimensionless parameter W, which largely\ndepends on the topology of the Fe-opacity peak, i.e., on material properties.\nFor W>1, we discover an instability limit, for which the stellar envelope\nbecomes gravitationally unbound, i.e. there no longer exists a static solution.\nWithin this framework we are also able to explain the S Doradus-type\ninstabilities for LBVs like AG Car, with a possible triggering due to changes\nin stellar rotation. The stellar effective temperatures in the upper HR diagram\nare potentially strongly affected by the inflation effect. This may have\nparticularly strong effects on the evolved massive LBV and WR stars just prior\nto their final collapse, as the progenitors of SNe Ibc, SNe II, and long GRBs. \n\n"}

Such a trend requires neutron fluences larger than\nthose so far assumed, as these last would have too few neutrons per iron seed.\nWe suggest that the observed enhancements can be produced by nucleosynthesis in\nAGB stars of low mass (M < 1.5M\\odot), if they release neutrons from the\n^{13}C({\\alpha},n)^{16}O reaction in reservoirs larger by a factor of 4 than\nassumed in more massive AGBs (M > 1.5M\\odot).

Our aim is to determine precisely the abundance distribution of HDO\ntowards the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422 and learn more about the water\nformation mechanisms by determining the HDO/H2O abundance ratio. A spectral\nsurvey of the source IRAS16293-2422 was carried out in the framework of the\nCHESS Herschel Key program with the HIFI instrument, allowing the detection of\nnumerous HDO lines. Other transitions have been observed previously with\nground-based telescopes. The spherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code\nRATRAN was used to reproduce the observed line profiles of HDO by assuming an\nabundance jump. To determine the H2O abundance throughout the envelope, a\nsimilar study was made of the H2-18O observed lines, as the H2O main isotope\nlines are contaminated by the outflows. We derive an inner HDO abundance of\n1.7e-7 and an outer HDO abundance of 8e-11. To reproduce the HDO absorption\nlines, it is necessary to add an absorbing layer in front of the envelope. It\nmay correspond to a water-rich layer created by the photodesorption of the ices\nat the edges of the molecular cloud. The HDO/H2O ratio is ~1.4-5.8% in the hot\ncorino whereas it is ~0.2-2.2% in the outer envelope. It is estimated at ~4.8%\nin the added absorbing layer.

The\nrecent idea of Stothers proposes that periodic variations in the properties of\nthe convective envelope may be behind the amplitude and phase modulation. In\nthis work we approximated the mechanism by introducing variations in the\nconvective parameters of the Florida-Budapest hydrodynamic code and also by\nmeans of amplitude equations. We found that the process is only effective for\nlong modulation periods, typically for more than hundred days, in agreement\nwith the thermal time scales of the pulsation in RR Lyrae stars.

We show that cooling of high-velocity,\nshocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances,\nincluding conditions relevant to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs),\nresulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast\nenergy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler\ngas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity\nv_in>~10,000 km s^-1, as observed in ultra-violet and X-ray absorption, the\nshocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal\npressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate\ndirectly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton\ncooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with v_in~1,000 km\ns^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience\nenergy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions.

The X-ray Chandra data allow to unambiguously\nresolve the X-ray emission, and unveil the nature, of the two optical sources\nin CID-42. We find that only one of the optical nuclei is responsible for the\nwhole X-ray unobscured emission observed and a 3sigma upper limit on the flux\nof the second optical nucleus is measured. The upper limit on the X-ray\nluminosity plus the analysis of the multiwavelength spectral energy\ndistribution indicate the presence of a starforming region in the second source\nrather than an obscured SMBH, thus favoring the GW recoil scenario. However the\npresence of a very obscured SMBH cannot be fully ruled-out. A new X-ray\nfeature, in a SW direction with respect to the main source, is discovered and\ndiscussed. \n\n"}

Our results show that the\nmotion of the knots is essentially ballistic, with the exception of the\nfarthest knots, which trace the large scale C-shape bending of the jet. The\nobserved bending of the jet can be produced by a relative motion of the HH 30\nstar with respect to its surrounding environment, caused either by a possible\nproper motion of the HH 30 star, or by the entrainment of environment gas by\nthe red lobe of the nearby L1551-IRS 5 outflow. Alternatively, the bending can\nbe produced by the stellar wind from a nearby CTTS, identified in the 2MASS\ncatalog. The proper motion velocities of the knots of the counterjet show more\nvariations than those of the jet. In particular, we identify two knots of the\ncounterjet that have the same kinematic age but whose velocities differ by\nalmost a factor of two. Thus, it appears that counterjet knots launched\nsimultaneously can be ejected with very different velocities. We confirm that\nthe observed wiggling of the jet and counterjet arises from the orbital motion\nof the jet source in a binary system. Precession is of secondary importance in\nshaping the jet.

Hence, the Bondi accretion cannot be used in\nthese cases, such as in the galaxy NGC 3115. The winds of these high-velocity\nstars are shocked to temperatures above the virial temperature of the galaxy,\nleading to the formation of a hot bubble of size ~0.1-10 pc near the center.\nThis hot bubble can substantially reduce the mass accretion rate by the SMBH.\nIf the density of the hot bubble is lower than that of the interstellar medium\n(ISM), a density-inversion layer is formed. As the gas loses energy by X-ray\nradiation, eventually more mass of the cooling shocked stellar winds will be\naccreted to the SMBH. This accretion will be of cold clumps. After a period of\nmillions of years of low AGN activity, therefore, a stronger AGN activity will\noccur that will heat and expel gas, much as in cooling flow clusters. Adding to\nother problems of the Bondi process, our results render the Bondi accretion\nirrelevant for AGN feedback in cooling flow in galaxies and small groups of\ngalaxies and during galaxy formation. \n\n"}

This leads to dissipative effects that\nmodify the inflationary dynamics and may generate a nearly-thermal radiation\nbath, such that inflation occurs in a warm rather than supercooled environment.\nIn this work, we perform a numerical computation and obtain expressions for the\nassociated dissipation coefficient in supersymmetric models, focusing on the\nregime where the radiation temperature is below the heavy mass threshold. The\ndissipation coefficient receives contributions from the decay of both on-shell\nand off-shell degrees of freedom, which are dominant for small and large\ncouplings, respectively, taking into account the light field multiplicities. In\nparticular, we find that the contribution from on-shell decays, although\nBoltzmann-suppressed, can be much larger than that of virtual modes, which is\nbounded by the validity of a perturbative analysis.

This\nstudy is motivated by i) the potential to find bright warm disks around planet\nhost stars, ii) a need to characterise the distribution of rare warm disks, and\niii) the possible identification of candidates for discovering transiting dust\nconcentrations. We find about 8,000 stars that have excess emission, mostly at\n12um. The positions of these stars correlate with the 100um background level so\nmost of the flux measurements associated with these excesses are spurious. We\nidentify 271 stars with plausible excesses by making a 5MJy/sr cut in the IRAS\n100um emission. The number counts of these excesses, at both 12 and 22um, have\nthe same distribution as extra-Galactic number counts. Thus, although some\nexcesses may be circumstellar, most can be explained as chance alignments with\nbackground galaxies. The one exception is a 22um excess associated with a\nrelatively nearby A-type star that we were able to confirm because the disk\noccurrence rate is independent of stellar distance. Despite our low detection\nrate, these results place valuable upper limits on the distribution of large\nmid-infrared excesses; e.g. fewer than 1:1000 stars have 12um excesses (F_\nobs/F_star) larger than a factor of five. In contrast to previous studies, we\nfind no evidence for disks around 1790 stars with candidate planets (we\nattribute one significant 12um excess to a background galaxy), and no evidence\nthat the disk distribution around planet hosts is different to the bulk\npopulation. Higher resolution imaging of stars with excesses is the best way to\nrule out galaxy confusion and identify more reliable disk candidates among\nKepler stars. A similar survey to ours that focusses on nearby stars would be\nwell suited to finding the distribution of rare warm disks. \n\n"}

In order to compare the model to observations, we use the GLIMPSE,\nMIPSGAL, and IRAS surveys to construct total emission spectra, as well as\nlongitude and latitude profiles for the emission. The distribution of stars and\ndust is taken from the SKY model, and the dust emissivities includes an\napproximation of the emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in addition\nto thermal emission. The model emission is in broad agreement with the\nobservations, but a few modifications are needed to obtain a good fit. Firstly,\nby adjusting the model to include two major and two minor spiral arms rather\nthan four equal spiral arms, the fit to the longitude profiles for |l|>30\ndegrees can be improved.

Abstract: Recent Herschel/SPIRE maps of the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC,\nLMC) exhibit in each thousands of clouds. Observed at 250 microns, they must be\ncold, T ~ 15 K, hence the name \"Herschel cold clouds\" (HCCs). From the observed\nrotational velocity profile and the assumption of spherical symmetry, the\nGalactic mass density is modeled in a form close to that of an isothermal\nsphere. If the HCCs constitute a certain fraction of it, their angular size\ndistribution has a specified shape. A fit to the data deduced from the SMC/LMC\nmaps supports this and yields for their radius 2.5 pc, with a small change when\nallowing for a spread in HCC radii. There are so many HCCs that they will make\nup all the missing Halo mass density if there is spherical symmetry and their\naverage mass is of order 15,000 Mo. This compares well with the Jeans mass of\ncirca 40,000 Mo and puts forward that the HCCs are in fact Jeans clusters,\nconstituting all the Galactic dark matter and much of its missing baryons, a\nconclusion deduced before from a different field of the sky (Nieuwenhuizen,\nSchild and Gibson 2011). A preliminary analysis of the intensities yields that\nthe Jeans clusters themselves may consist of some billion MACHOs of a few dozen\nEarth masses.

Diffuse\nInterstellar Bands offer a unique probe of the diffuse, cool-warm gas in these\nregions. The aim is to use DIBs as diagnostics of the local interstellar\nconditions, whilst at the same time deriving properties of the yet-unknown\ncarriers.

Yet, it\nremains one of the hardest processes to understand when trying to connect\nobservations of stellar and galaxy populations to models of large scale\nstructure formation. The star formation rate at redshifts z > 2 drops off\nrather more quickly than was thought even five years ago. Theoretical models\nhave tended to overpredict the star formation rate at these high redshifts\nsubstantially, primarily due to overcooling. Overcooling in galaxies typically\noccurs because of unphysical radiative cooling. As a result, insufficient\nturbulence is driven by stellar feedback. I show that such turbulence has the\nnet effect of strongly inhibiting star formation, despite its ability to\nlocally promote star formation by compression. Radiation pressure appears less\nlikely to be a dominant driver of the turbulence than has been argued, but\nsupernova and magnetorotational instabilities remain viable. Gravity alone\ncannot be the main driver, as otherwise well-resolved models without feedback\nwould accurately predict star formation rates. Star formation rate surface\ndensity correlates well with observed molecular gas surface density, as well as\nwith other tracers of high density material. Correlation does not, however,\nimply causation. It appears that both molecule formation and star formation\noccur as a consequence of gravitational collapse, with molecules not essential\nin cooling. The basic concept that gravitational instability drives star\nformation remains a true guide through the thickets of complexity surrounding\nthis topic. I finally briefly note that understanding ionization heating and\nradiation pressure from the most massive stars will likely require much higher\nresolution models (sub-parsec scale) than resolving supernova feedback.\n(lightly abridged) \n\n"}

We recover the range of SN Ia luminosities, colours, and\nspectral characteristics from the near-UV to 1 micron, for standard as well as\nlow-luminosity 91bg-like SNe Ia. Our models predict an increase in rise time to\npeak with increasing 56Ni mass, from ~15 to ~21d, yield peak bolometric\nluminosities that match Arnett's rule to within 10%, and reproduce the much\nsmaller scatter in near-IR magnitudes compared to the optical.

In order for these surveys to achieve their designed goals, they will\nrequire predictions for the nonlinear matter power spectrum to sub-percent\naccuracy. Through the use of a large ensemble of cosmological N-body\nsimulations, we demonstrate that if we do not understand the uncertainties\nassociated with simulating structure formation, i.e. knowledge of the `true'\nsimulation parameters, and simply seek to marginalize over them, then the\nconstraining power of such future surveys can be significantly reduced.\nHowever, for the parameters {n_s, h, Om_b, Om_m}, this effect can be largely\nmitigated by adding the information from a CMB experiment, like Planck. In\ncontrast, for the amplitude of fluctuations sigma8 and the time-evolving\nequation of state of dark energy {w_0, w_a}, the mitigation is mild. On\nmarginalizing over the simulation parameters, we find that the dark-energy\nfigure of merit can be degraded by ~2.

Gaussian 3D velocities Abstract: Mass modelling of spherical systems through internal motions is hampered by\nthe mass/velocity anisotropy (VA) degeneracy inherent in the Jeans equation, as\nwell as the lack of techniques that are both fast and adaptable to realistic\nsystems. A new fast method, called MAMPOSSt, which performs a maximum\nlikelihood fit of the distribution of observed tracers in projected phase\nspace, is developed and thoroughly tested. MAMPOSSt assumes a shape for the\ngravitational potential, but instead of postulating a shape for the\ndistribution function in terms of energy and angular momentum, or supposing\nGaussian line-of-sight velocity distributions, MAMPOSSt assumes a VA profile\nand a shape for the 3D velocity distribution, here Gaussian. MAMPOSSt requires\nno binning, differentiation, nor extrapolation of the observables. Tests on\ncluster-mass haloes from LambdaCDM cosmological simulations show that, with 500\ntracers, MAMPOSSt is able to jointly recover the virial radius, tracer scale\nradius, dark matter scale radius and outer or constant VA with small bias (<10%\non scale radii and <2% on the two other quantities) and inefficiencies of 10%,\n27%, 48% and 20%, respectively. MAMPOSSt does not perform better when some\nparameters are frozen, and even worse when the virial radius is set to its true\nvalue, which appears to be the consequence of halo triaxiality. The accuracy of\nMAMPOSSt depends weakly on the adopted interloper removal scheme, including an\nefficient iterative Bayesian scheme that we introduce here, which can directly\nobtain the virial radius with as good precision as MAMPOSSt. Our tests show\nthat MAMPOSSt with Gaussian 3D velocities is very competitive with, and up to\n1000x faster than other methods.

Taking a distance to the cloud of 415 pc rather than 259 pc, the\ndistribution of ages is shifted to lower values, in the 1-3 Myr range, with a\ntail up to 10 Myr. The mass distribution spans 0.2-1.2 Msun, with median mass\nof 0.7 Msun. The distribution of fractional disk luminosities in Serpens\nresembles that of the young Taurus Molecular Cloud, with most disks consistent\nwith optically thick, passively irradiated disks in a variety of disk\ngeometries (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.1). In contrast, the distributions for the older\nUpper Scorpius and Eta Chamaeleontis clusters are dominated by optically thin\nlower luminosity disks (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.02). This evolution in fractional disk\nluminosities is concurrent with that of disk fractions. The actively accreting\nand non-accreting stars (based on Ha data) in Serpens show very similar\ndistributions in fractional disk luminosities, differing only in the brighter\ntail dominated by strongly accreting stars. In contrast with a sample of Herbig\nAe/Be stars, the T Tauri stars in Serpens do not have a clear separation in\nfractional disk luminosities for different disk geometries: both flared and\nflat disks present wider, overlapping distributions. This result is consistent\nwith previous suggestions of a faster evolution for disks around Herbig Ae/Be\nstars. Furthermore, the results for the mineralogy of the dust in the disk\nsurface do not show any correlation to either stellar and disk characteristics\nor mean cluster age in the 1-10 Myr range probed here. A possible explanation\nfor the lack of correlation is that the processes affecting the dust within\ndisks have short timescales, happening repeatedly, making it difficult to\ndistinguish long lasting evolutionary effects.

We resolve this long-standing problem and find that\nHe in the GRB's host HII region is responsible for most of the absorption. We\nshow that the X-ray absorbing column density (N_Hx) is correlated with both the\nneutral gas column density and with the optical afterglow extinction (Av). This\ncorrelation explains the connection between dark bursts and bursts with high\nN_Hx values. From these correlations we exclude an origin of the X-ray\nabsorption which is not related to the host galaxy, i.e. the intergalactic\nmedium or intervening absorbers are not responsible. We find that the\ncorrelation with the dust column has a strong redshift evolution, whereas the\ncorrelation with the neutral gas does not. From this we conclude that the\ncolumn density of the X-ray absorption is correlated with the total gas column\ndensity in the host galaxy rather than the metal column density, in spite of\nthe fact that X-ray absorption is typically dominated by metals. The strong\nredshift evolution of N_Hx/Av is thus a reflection of the cosmic metallicity\nevolution of star-forming galaxies. We conclude that the absorption of X-rays\nin GRB afterglows is caused by He in the HII region hosting the GRB. While dust\nis destroyed and metals are stripped of all of their electrons by the GRB to\ngreat distances, the abundance of He saturates the He-ionising UV continuum\nmuch closer to the GRB, allowing it to remain in the neutral or singly-ionised\nstate. Helium X-ray absorption explains the correlation with total gas, the\nlack of strong evolution with redshift as well as the absence of dust, metal or\nhydrogen absorption features in the optical-UV spectra. \n\n"}

PSR\nJ0737-3039A is a faint gamma-ray emitter, so that its spectral properties are\nonly weakly constrained; however, its measured efficiency is typical of other\nMSPs. The two peaks of the gamma-ray light curve are separated by roughly half\na rotation and are well offset from the radio and X-ray emission, suggesting\nthat the GeV radiation originates in a distinct part of the magnetosphere from\nthe other types of emission. From the modeling of the radio and the gamma-ray\nemission profiles and the analysis of radio polarization data, we constrain the\nmagnetic inclination $\\alpha$ and the viewing angle $\\zeta$ to be close to\n90$^\\circ$, which is consistent with independent studies of the radio emission\nfrom PSR J0737-3039A.

In most starbursts, the supernova\nremnants blast open a hot phase that fills the regions and launches a\nsuperwind. Denser starbursts are too overpressured for hot wind formation, but\nsupernovae still stir up the ISM. I argue that supernovae power ubiquitous\nturbulence through each of the starburst ISM phases, including the hot wind,\nand that a fluctuation dynamo amplifies magnetic fields until they are in\nequipartition with the turbulence. Supernovae can drive turbulence with speeds\nof ~1000 km/s in the hot wind and ~20 km/s in the cold molecular gas, depending\non the outer scale. I predict magnetic field strengths of 70 muG in the\nGalactic Center starburst, 300 muG in M82 and NGC 253, and 2 mG in Arp 220's\nnuclei. The mean magnetic field strengths are a few times stronger in molecular\ngas than in hot winds, but do not vary strongly with density within a\nstarburst.

We prove that for a star in\ndynamic equilibrium, the necessary and sufficient condition for thermodynamic\nequilibrium (extremum of total entropy S) is constancy of angular velocity\n(\\Omega), redshifted temperature, and redshifted chemical potential. Friedman\npreviously identified positivity of canonical energy, E, as a criterion for\ndynamic stability and argued that all rotating stars are dynamically unstable\nto sufficiently nonaxisymmetric perturbations (the CFS instability), so our\nmain focus is on axisymmetric stability. We show that for a star in dynamic\nequilibrium, mode stability holds with respect to all axisymmetric\nperturbations if E is positive on a certain subspace, V, of axisymmetric\nLagrangian perturbations that, in particular, have no Lagrangian change in\nangular momentum density. Conversely, if E fails to be positive on V, then\nthere exist perturbations that can't become asymptotically stationary at late\ntimes. We further show that for a star in thermodynamic equilibrium, the\ncanonical energy in the rotating frame, E_r, is related to second order changes\nin ADM mass, M, and angular momentum, J, by E_r = \\delta^2 M - \\Omega \\delta^2\nJ. Thus, positivity of E_r for perturbations with \\delta J = 0 is a necessary\ncondition for thermodynamic stability (local maximum of S). For axisymmetric\nperturbations we have E = E_r, so a necessary condition for thermodynamic\nstability with respect to axisymmetric perturbations is positivity of E on all\nperturbations with \\delta J = 0, not merely on the perturbations in V.

Instead,\nthe evidence points to low [alpha/Fe] ratios resulting from an initial mass\nfunction (IMF) deficient in the highest mass stars. The critical evidence is\nthe 0.4 dex deficiency of [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and other hydrostatic elements,\ncontrasting with the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H]. Supporting\nevidence comes from the hydrostatic element (O, Mg, Na, Al, Cu) [X/Fe] ratios,\nwhich are inconsistent with iron added to the Milky Way (MW) disk trends. Also,\nthe ratio of hydrostatic to explosive (Si, Ca, Ti) element abundances suggests\na relatively top-light IMF. Abundance similarities with the LMC, Fornax and IC\n1613, suggest that their alpha-element deficiencies also resulted from IMFs\nlacking the most massive SNII.\n  For such a top-light IMF, the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H],\nas seen in Sgr, indicates that massive Type II supernovae (>30Msun) cannot be\nmajor sources of r-process elements.\n  High [La/Y] ratios, consistent with leaky-box chemical evolution, are\nconfirmed but ~0.3 dex larger than theoretical AGB predictions. This may be due\nto the 13C pocket mass, or a difference between MW and Sgr AGB stars. Sgr has\nthe lowest [Rb/Zr] ratios known, consistent with low-mass (~2Msun) AGB stars\nnear [Fe/H]=-0.6, likely resulting from leaky-box chemical evolution.\n  The [Cu/O] trend in Sgr and the MW suggest that Cu yields increase with both\nmetallicity and stellar mass, as expected from Cu production by the weak\ns-process in massive stars.\n  Finally, we present an updated hfs line list, an abundance analysis of\nArcturus, and further develop our error analysis formalism. \n\n"}

This is\nexactly the same as for a pair of observers receding from each other in flat\nspace-time where the effect is purely kinematic. The interpretation of this has\nbeen the subject of considerable debate, and it has been suggested that all\nredshifts are a relative velocity effect, raising the question of whether the\nwavelength always stretches in proportion to the emitter-receiver separation.\nHere we show that, for low redshift at least, $\\Delta\\log(\\lambda / D)$\nvanishes for a photon exchanged between any two freely-falling observers in a\nspatially constant tidal field, because such a field stretches wavelengths and\nthe space between the observers identically.

The standard\napproach to this \"missing mass problem\" has been the postulate of \"dark\nmatter\", meaning an additional, electromagnetically dark, matter component that\nprovides the missing mass. However, direct observational evidence for dark\nmatter has not been found to date. More importantly, astronomical observations\nobtained during the last decade indicate that dark matter cannot explain the\nkinematics of galaxies. Multiple observations show that the discrepancy between\nobserved and dynamical mass is a function of gravitational acceleration (or\nfield strength) but not of other parameters (size, rotation speed, etc.) of a\ngalaxy; the mass discrepancy appears below a characteristic and universal\nacceleration (\"Milgrom's constant\").

One\npossible source of ambiguity in this kind of analyses comes from cosmic\nopacity, which can mimick a dark enery behaviour. However, most tests of cosmic\nopacity have been restricted to the redshift range $z<2$.

II: The formation of Unstable\n  Coronal Flux Ropes and the Initiation of CMEs Abstract: We present results from 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the\nemergence of a twisted convection zone flux tube into a pre-existing coronal\ndipole field. As in previous simulations, following the partial emergence of\nthe sub-surface flux into the corona, a combination of vortical motions and\ninternal magnetic reconnection forms a coronal flux rope. Then, in the\nsimulations presented here, external reconnection between the emerging field\nand the pre-existing dipole coronal field allows further expansion of the\ncoronal flux rope into the corona. After sufficient expansion, internal\nreconnection occurs beneath the coronal flux rope axis, and the flux rope\nerupts up to the top boundary of the simulation domain ($\\sim$ 36 Mm above the\nsurface). We find that the presence of a pre-existing field, orientated in a\ndirection to facilitate reconnection with the emerging field, is vital to the\nfast rise of the coronal flux rope. The simulations shown in this paper are\nable to self-consistently create many of the surface and coronal signatures\nused by coronal mass ejection (CME) models. These signatures include: surface\nshearing and rotational motions; quadrupolar geometry above the surface;\ncentral sheared arcades reconnecting with oppositely orientated overlying\ndipole fields; the formation of coronal flux ropes underlying potential coronal\nfield; and internal reconnection which resembles the classical flare\nreconnection scenario.

The presence of this shock indicates that the innermost\nstreamlines of the high-velocity component are launched at a very small radius,\n0.01-0.15 AU, from the central star. The jet accelerates and expands downstream\nof the recollimation shock; the 'acceleration' is likely a sign of velocity\nvariations in the jet. No evidence of rotation is found, and we compare this\nnon-detection to previous counter-claims. Moving jet knots, likely the result\nof the jet velocity variations, are observed.

However, crustal\nentrainment-which until very recently has been ignored-suggests that in order\nto account for the Vela glitches, the fraction of the moment of inertia\nresiding in the crust must increase to about 7%. This indicates that the\nrequired angular momentum reservoir may exceed that which is available in the\ncrust. We explore the possibility that uncertainties in the equation of state\nprovide enough flexibility for the construction of models that predict a large\ncrustal thickness and consequently a large crustal moment of inertia. Given\nthat analytic results suggest that the crustal moment of inertia is sensitive\nto the transition pressure at the crust-core interface, we tune the parameters\nof the model to maximize the transition pressure, while still providing an\nexcellent description of nuclear observables.

Secular interactions transfer\nangular momentum between inner and outer orbits unless their apsidal lines are\nparallel or anti-parallel. These choices correspond, respectively, to\northogonal eigenmodes p and a. Each is characterized by an eccentricity ratio\nset by the masses and semi-major axes, i.e., $e_{p, 1}/e_{p, 2}\\sim a_1/a_2$\nwhile $e_{a, 1}/e_{a, 2}\\sim (a_1/a_2)^{-3/2}(m_2/m_1)$. Mode p dominates the\nsystem's current state so $e_1/e_2$ always remains close to $e_{p, 1}/e_{p,\n2}$. A small contribution by Mode a causes $e_1$ and $e_2$ to oscillate with\nperiod $\\sim 10^3\\,\\yr$. Orbital changes should be apparent in a few years.\nThese will reveal the forcing of the apsidal precession of the inner orbit by\ngeneral relativity (GR), and possibly also the smaller contribution due to the\ntidal and rotational distortion of the inner white dwarf (WD). Phinney (1992)\nproposes that the epicyclic energy of a WD-pulsar binary reaches equipartition\nwith the kinetic energy of a single convective eddy when the WD's progenitor\nfills its Roche lobe. We extend Phinney's theory to apply to modes rather than\nindividual orbits.

The most effective eddies are those with\nlifetimes closest to the orbit period. These were more energetic in the\nprogenitor of the outer WD.

Our analysis of the well-studied GC NGC 1851 finds that\nthe C filter is both very efficient and effective at detecting its previously\ndiscovered MPs in the RGB and SGB. Remarkably, we have also detected an\nintrinsically broad MS best characterized by two distinct but heavily\noverlapping populations that cannot be explained by binaries, field stars, or\nphotometric errors. The MS distribution is in very good agreement with that\nseen on the RGB, with ~30% of the stars belonging to the second population.\nThere is also evidence for two sequences in the red horizontal branch, but this\nappears to be unrelated to the MPs in this cluster.

We determine the\nwhite dwarf luminosity functions (WDLFs) for eight different halo models and\ncompare these with the observed halo WDLF of white dwarfs in the SuperCOSMOS\nSky Survey. Furthermore, we predict the properties of binary white dwarfs in\nthe halo and determine the number of halo white dwarfs that is expected to be\nobserved with the Gaia satellite. Results: By comparing the WDLFs, we find that\na standard IMF matches the observations more accurately than a top-heavy one,\nbut the difference with a bottom-heavy IMF is small. A burst of star formation\n13 Gyr ago fits slightly better than a star formation burst 10 Gyr ago and also\nslightly better than continuous star formation $10-13$ Gyrs ago. Gaia will be\nthe first instrument to constrain the bright end of the field halo WDLF, where\ncontributions from binary WDs are considerable. Many of these will have He\ncores, of which a handful have atypical surface gravities ($\\log g < 6$) and\nreach luminosities $\\log(L/L_\\odot) > 0$ in our standard model for WD cooling.\nThese so called pre-WDs, if observed, can help us to constrain white dwarf\ncooling models and might teach us something about the fraction of halo stars\nthat reside in binaries. \n\n"}

These may give rise to the observed diffuse and 'knotty'\nstructure of the jets in the X-ray, and can also mass load the jets. We\nperformed modelling of internal entrainment from stars intercepted by Centaurus\nA's jet, using stellar evolution- and wind codes. From photometry and a\ncode-synthesised population of 12 Gyr (Z = 0.004), 3 Gyr (Z = 0.008) and 0 - 60\nMyr (Z = 0.02) stars, appropriate for the parent elliptical NGC 5128, the total\nnumber of stars in the jet is ~ 8 x 10^8.

We consider a hidden sector\ncontaining two stable particles charged under an unbroken $U(1)^{'}$ gauge\nsymmetry, hence featuring dissipative interactions. The massless gauge field\nassociated with this symmetry, the dark photon, can interact via kinetic mixing\nwith the ordinary photon. In fact, such an interaction of strength $\\epsilon\n\\sim 10 ^{-9}$ appears to be necessary in order to explain galactic structure.\nWe calculate the effect of this new physics on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and its\ncontribution to the relativistic energy density at Hydrogen recombination. We\nthen examine the process of dark recombination, during which neutral dark\nstates are formed, which is important for large-scale structure formation.\nGalactic structure is considered next, focussing on spiral and irregular\ngalaxies. For these galaxies we modelled the dark matter halo (at the current\nepoch) as a dissipative plasma of dark matter particles, where the energy lost\ndue to dissipation is compensated by the energy produced from ordinary\nsupernovae (the core-collapse energy is transferred to the hidden sector via\nkinetic mixing induced processes in the supernova core).

This\nindicates that M-dwarfs, the major component, are fewer in the halo and the\nthick disk. We used archived data of several surveys in both the north and\nsouth field of GOODS (Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey), MODS in\nGOODS-N, and ERS and CANDELS in GOODS-S.

The wind contribution is uncertain because\nthe boundary between the wind and interstellar medium is difficult to observe.\nMid-infrared observations (e.g., of the H II region RCW 120) show arcs of dust\nemission around O stars, contained well within the H II region bubble. These\narcs could indicate the edge of an asymmetric stellar wind bubble, distorted by\ndensity gradients and/or stellar motion. We present two-dimensional,\nradiation-hydrodynamics simulations investigating the evolution of wind bubbles\nand H II regions around massive stars moving through a dense (n=3000 cm^{-3}),\nuniform medium with velocities ranging from 4 to 16 km/s. The H II region\nmorphology is strongly affected by stellar motion, as expected, but the wind\nbubble is also very aspherical from birth, even for the lowest space velocity\nconsidered. Wind bubbles do not fill their H II regions (we find filling\nfactors of 10-20%), at least for a main sequence star with mass M~30 Msun.\nFurthermore, even for supersonic velocities the wind bow shock does not\nsignificantly trap the ionization front. X-ray emission from the wind bubble is\nsoft, faint, and comes mainly from the turbulent mixing layer between the wind\nbubble and the H II region. The wind bubble radiates <1 per cent of its energy\nin X-rays; it loses most of its energy by turbulent mixing with cooler\nphotoionized gas. Comparison of the simulations with the H II region RCW 120\nshows that its dynamical age is <=0.4 Myr and that stellar motion <=4 km/s is\nallowed, implying that the ionizing source is unlikely to be a runaway star but\nmore likely formed in situ.

Abstract: Measurements of the cosmic ray antiproton spectrum can be used to search for\ncontributions from annihilating dark matter and to constrain the dark matter\nannihilation cross section. Depending on the assumptions made regarding cosmic\nray propagation in the Galaxy, such constraints can be quite stringent. We\nrevisit this topic, utilizing a set of propagation models fit to the cosmic ray\nboron, carbon, oxygen and beryllium data. We derive upper limits on the dark\nmatter annihilation cross section and find that when the cosmic ray propagation\nparameters are treated as nuisance parameters (as we argue is appropriate), the\nresulting limits are significantly less stringent than have been previously\nreported. We also note (as have several previous groups) that simple\nGALPROP-like diffusion-reacceleration models predict a spectrum of cosmic ray\nantiprotons that is in good agreement with PAMELA's observations above ~5 GeV,\nbut that significantly underpredict the flux at lower energies. Although the\ncomplexity of modeling cosmic ray propagation at GeV-scale energies makes it\ndifficult to determine the origin of this discrepancy, we consider the\npossibility that the excess antiprotons are the result of annihilating dark\nmatter. Suggestively, we find that this excess is best fit for a dark matter\nmass of approximately 35 GeV and annihilation cross section of approximately\n1e-26 cm^3/s (to b-bbar), in good agreement with the mass and cross section\npreviously shown to be required to generate the gamma-ray excess observed from\nthe Galactic Center. \n\n"}

This neutrino-viscosity can slow down the growth of MRI modes to such an\nextent that a minimum initial magnetic field strength of $\\gtrsim 10^{12}\\,\n{\\rm G}$ is needed for the MRI to grow on a sufficiently short time-scale to\npotentially affect the explosion.

Low orbital eccentricity streams are smoother and have\nless differential motion than high eccentricity streams. The tail of a high\neccentricity stream can develop a fan of particles which wraps around at\napocenter in a shell feature. We show that scaling the essentially stationary\naction-angle variables with the cube root of the satellite mass allows a low\nmass satellite stream to accurately predict the features in the stream from a\nsatellite a thousand times more massive.

One approach to address this issue is to\nlook at the Galactic bulge since it is the closest. According to some\ntheoretical models, our bulge may have built up from the merger of\nsubstructures formed from the fragmentation of a gaseous disk in the early\nphases of Galactic evolution. We may have discovered the remnant of one of\nthese substructures in the stellar system Terzan 5. In fact, Terzan 5 hosts two\nstellar populations with quite different iron abundances, thus suggesting it\nonce was far more massive than today. Moreover, its peculiar chemistry\nstrikingly resembles that observed in the Galactic bulge. In this Thesis we\nperformed a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of this cluster to\ndetermine its formation and evolution. Form the photometric point of view we\nbuilt a high-resolution differential reddening map in the direction of the\nsystem and we measured relative proper motions to separate its member\npopulation from the contaminating bulge and disk stars. From the spectroscopic\npoint of view we measured abundances for more than 600 stars belonging to\nTerzan 5 and its surroundings in order to build the largest\nfield-decontaminated metallicity distribution for this system. We find that the\nmetallicity distribution is extremely broad (>1 dex) and we discovered a third,\nmetal-poor and alpha-enhanced population with average [Fe/H]=-0.8 dex. The\nstriking similarity between Terzan 5 and the bulge in terms of their chemical\nformation and evolution that is clearly revealed by this Thesis suggests that\nTerzan 5 formed in situ with the Galactic bulge. In particular its metal-poor\npopulations trace the early stages of the bulge formation, while its most\nmetal-rich component may contain crucial information on the bulge more recent\nevolution. \n\n"}

To investigate such matters a sample of 12 galaxies,\nmost with accurate distances, has been composed of which the luminosities are\ndistributed regularly over a range spanning 2.5 orders of magnitude. Of the\nobserved high quality and extended rotation curves of these galaxies\ndecompositions have been made, for four different schemes, each with two free\nparameters. For a \"maximum disc fit\" the rotation curves can be well matched,\nyet a large range of mass-to-light ratios for the individual galaxies is\nrequired. For the alternative gravitational theory of MOND the rotation curves\ncan be explained if the fundamental parameter associated with MOND is allowed\nas a free parameter. Fixing that parameter leads to a disagreement between the\npredicted and observed rotation curves for a few galaxies. When cosmologically\nmotivated NFW dark matter halos are assumed, the rotation curves for the least\nmassive galaxies can, by no means, be reproduced; cores are definitively\npreferred over cusps. Finally, decompositions have been made for a pseudo\nisothermal halo combined with a universal M/L ratio.

The standard theory involves the expulsion of undesirable flux\nand, because of flux freezing, the mass anchored on this flux also must be\nexpelled. The strong galactic gravitational field makes this impossible on\nenergetic grounds. It is shown that if only short pieces of the undesirable\nfield lines are expelled, then mass can flow down along these field lines\nwithout requiring much energy. This expulsion of only short lines of force can\nbe accomplished by a spike instability associated with gigantic astrophysical\nsuperbubbles.

Here we propose to\nexperimentally test the properties of vacuum energy under circumstances\ndifferent from our current vacuum. One promising avenue is to consider the\neffect of high density phases of QCD in neutron stars. Such phases have\ndifferent vacuum expectation values and a different vacuum energy from the\nnormal phase, which can contribute an order one fraction to the mass of neutron\nstars. Precise observations of the mass of neutron stars can potentially yield\ninformation about the gravitational properties of vacuum energy, which can\nsignificantly affect their mass-radius relation. A more direct test of cosmic\nevolution of vacuum energy could be inferred from a precise observation of the\nprimordial gravitational wave spectrum at frequencies corresponding to phase\ntransitions.

Fitting the free parameters\nin our model allows us to predict how wind mass loss rate depends on stellar\nmass, radius, and rotation. We couple the results to the wind model developed\nin Paper I of this series to predict how wind properties evolve on the\nmain-sequence.\n  Results: We estimate that wind mass loss rate scales with stellar parameters\nas $\\dot{M}_\\star \\propto R_\\star^2 \\Omega_\\star^{1.33} M_\\star^{-3.36}$. We\nestimate that at young ages, the solar wind likely had a mass loss rate that is\nan order of magnitude higher than that of the current solar wind.

The 2-dimensional\noscillation code ACOR, which treats rotation in a non-perturbative manner, is\nused to study pulsation spectra of highly distorted evolved models of stars. 2D\nmodels of stars are obtained by a self-consistent method which distorts\nspherically averaged stellar models a posteriori, at any stage of evolution,\nand for any type of rotation law. Four types of modes are calculated in a very\ndense frequency spectrum, among which are island modes. The regularity of the\nisland modes spectrum is confirmed and yields a new set of quantum numbers,\nwith which an \\'echelle diagram can be built. Mixed gravito-acoustic modes are\ncalculated in rapidly rotating models for the first time. \n\n"}

We aim to find\nbinary-evolution mechanisms that can explain these eccentric long-period\norbits, and reproduce the currently observed period-eccentricity diagram. Three\ndifferent processes are considered; tidally-enhanced wind mass-loss,\nphase-dependent RLOF on eccentric orbits and the interaction between a\ncircumbinary disk and the binary. The binary module of the stellar-evolution\ncode MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) is extended to\ninclude the eccentricity-pumping processes. The effects of different input\nparameters on the final period and eccentricity of a binary-evolution model are\ntested with MESA. The end products of models with only tidally-enhanced wind\nmass-loss can indeed be eccentric, but these models need to lose too much mass,\nand invariably end up with a helium white dwarf that is too light to ignite\nhelium. Within the tested parameter space, no sdBs in eccentric systems are\nformed. Phase-dependent RLOF can reintroduce eccentricity during RLOF, and\ncould help to populate the short-period part of the period-eccentricity\ndiagram. When phase-dependent RLOF is combined with eccentricity pumping via a\ncircumbinary disk, the higher eccentricities can be reached as well. A\nremaining problem is that these models favour a distribution of higher\neccentricities at lower periods, while the observed systems show the opposite.\nThe models presented here are potentially capable of explaining the\nperiod-eccentricity distribution of long-period sdB binaries, but further\ntheoretical work on the physical mechanisms is necessary. \n\n"}

The derived parameters were compared to recent spectroscopic\nand photometric determinations and to gravity estimates based on seismic data.\nMost of the adopted diameter measurements have formal uncertainties around 1%,\nwhich translate into uncertainties in effective temperature of 0.5%. The\nmeasurements of bolometric flux seem to be accurate to 5% or better, which\ncontributes about 1% or less to the uncertainties in effective temperature.

We apply this method to modeling collision\nprocesses in kappa-distribution plasmas, with a particular focus on atomic\nprocesses important for solar physics. The relevant collision process rate\ncoefficients are generated by summing appropriately weighted Maxwellian rate\ncoefficients. This method reproduces the rate coefficients for a kappa\ndistribution to an estimated accuracy of better than 5%. This is equal to or\nbetter than the accuracy of rate coefficients generated using \"reverse\nengineering\" methods, which attempt to extract the needed cross sections from\nthe published Maxwellian rate coefficient data and then reconvolve the\nextracted cross sections with the desired kappa distribution. Our approach of\nsumming Maxwellian rate coefficients is easy to implement using existing\nspectral analysis software.

Within this\nscheme, the angular parameter which defines quasi-elliptical isophotes is\ntransformed from the commonly used, but inappropriate, polar co-ordinate to the\n`eccentric anomaly'. This provides a superior description of deviations from\nellipticity, better capturing the true isophotal shape. Furthermore, this makes\nit possible to accurately recover both the surface brightness profile, using\nthe correct azimuthally-averaged isophote, and the two-dimensional model of any\ngalaxy: the hitherto ubiquitous, but artificial, cross-like features in\nresidual images are completely removed. The formalism has been implemented into\nthe IRAF tasks $Ellipse$ and $Bmodel$ to create the new tasks `$Isofit$', and\n`$Cmodel$'.

In some cases the tight binary system can survive, in other it is\ndestroyed. The tight binary system might breakup with one star leaving the\nsystem. In an alternative evolution, one of the stars of the brook-up tight\nbinary system falls toward the AGB envelope with low specific angular momentum,\nand drowns in the envelope. In a different type of destruction process the drag\ninside the AGB envelope causes the tight binary system to merge. This releases\ngravitational energy within the AGB envelope, leading to a very asymmetrical\nenvelope ejection, with an irregular and `messy' planetary nebula as a\ndescendant. The evolution of the triple-stellar system can be in a full common\nenvelope evolution (CEE) or in a grazing envelope evolution (GEE).

We show that these particles appear at\ndensities close to twice saturation density and must be therefore included in\nthe calculations of the hadronic equation of state. Such an early appearance is\nstrictly related to the value of the L parameter of the symmetry energy that\nhas been found, in recent phenomenological studies, to lie in the range\n$40<L<62$ MeV. We discuss also the threshold for the formation of deltas and\nhyperons for hot and lepton rich hadronic matter.

Quark stars, on the\nother hand, can reach masses up to $2.75 M_{\\odot}$ as predicted by\nperturbative QCD calculations.

By means of high resolution numerical\nsimulations we detail the purely dynamical effects that a forming bar exerts on\nthe gas of an isolated disc galaxy. The galaxy is initially unstable to the\nformation of non-axisymmetric structures, and within 1 Gyr it develops spiral\narms that eventually evolve into a central stellar bar on kpc scale. A first\nmajor episode of gas inflow occurs during the formation of the spiral arms\nwhile at later times, when the stellar bar is establishing, a low density\nregion is carved between the bar co-rotational and inner Lindblad resonance\nradii. The development of such \"dead zone\" inhibits further massive gas\ninflows. Indeed, the gas inflow reaches its maximum during the relatively fast\nbar formation phase and not, as often assumed, when the bar is fully formed. We\nconclude that the low efficiency of long-lived, evolved bars in driving gas\ntoward galactic nuclei is the reason why observational studies have failed to\nestablish an indisputable link between bars and AGNs. On the other hand, the\nhigh efficiency in driving strong gas inflows of the intrinsically transient\nprocess of bar formation suggests that the importance of bars as drivers of AGN\nactivity in disc galaxies has been overlooked so far.

Both observational\nand computational studies of star-forming massive molecular gas clouds infer\nthat massive cluster formation is primarily triggered along the small-scale\n($\\lesssim0.3$ pc) filamentary substructures within the clouds. The present\nstudy is intended to investigate the possible ways in which a\nfilament-like-compact, massive star cluster (effective radius 0.1-0.3 pc) can\nexpand $\\gtrsim10$ times, still remaining massive enough ($\\gtrsim10^4\nM_\\odot$), to become a young massive star cluster, as we observe today. To that\nend, model massive clusters (of initially $10^4 M_\\odot-10^5 M_\\odot$) are\nevolved using Sverre Aarseth's state-of-the-art N-body code NBODY7. All the\ncomputed clusters expand with time, whose sizes (effective radii) are compared\nwith those observed for young massive clusters, of age $\\lesssim100$ Myr, in\nthe Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. It is found that beginning from the\nabove compact sizes, a star cluster cannot expand by its own, i.e., due to\ntwo-body relaxation, stellar-evolutionary mass loss, dynamical heating by\nprimordial binaries and stellar-mass black holes, up to the observed sizes of\nyoung massive clusters; they always remain much more compact compared to the\nobserved ones. This calls for additional mechanisms that can boost the\nexpansion of a massive cluster after its assembly. Using further N-body\ncalculations, it is shown that a substantial residual gas expulsion, with\n$\\approx30$% star formation efficiency, can indeed swell the newborn embedded\ncluster adequately. The limitations of the present calculations and their\nconsequences are discussed. \n\n"}

When the mass of $\\chi$ is much larger\nthan the Hubble scale $H$, the loop corrections of $\\chi$ only yield a local\ncontribution to the effective action and hence the effective action simply\ngives an action for $\\zeta$ in a single field model, where, as is widely known,\n$\\zeta$ is conserved in time after the Hubble crossing time. Meanwhile, when\nthe mass of $\\chi$ is comparable to $H$, the loop corrections of $\\chi$ can\ngive a non-local contribution to the effective action. Because of the non-local\ncontribution from $\\chi$, in general, $\\zeta$ may not be conserved, even if the\nclassical background trajectory is determined only by the evolution of the\ninflaton.

We make use of the\nsample of the 100 brightest galaxy clusters discovered in the XXL Survey to\ninvestigate the fraction of baryons in the form of hot gas and stars in the\ncluster population. We measure the gas masses of the detected halos and use a\nmass--temperature relation directly calibrated using weak-lensing measurements\nfor a subset of XXL clusters to estimate the halo mass. We find that the\nweak-lensing calibrated gas fraction of XXL-100-GC clusters is substantially\nlower than was found in previous studies using hydrostatic masses. Our best-fit\nrelation between gas fraction and mass reads $f_{\\rm\ngas,500}=0.055_{-0.006}^{+0.007}\\left(M_{\\rm\n500}/10^{14}M_\\odot\\right)^{0.21_{-0.10}^{+0.11}}$. The baryon budget of galaxy\nclusters therefore falls short of the Universal baryon fraction by about a\nfactor of two at $r_{\\rm 500}$. Our measurements require a hydrostatic bias\n$1-b=M_X/M_{\\rm WL}=0.72_{-0.07}^{+0.08}$ to match the gas fraction obtained\nusing lensing and hydrostatic equilibrium. Comparing our gas fraction\nmeasurements with the expectations from numerical simulations, our results\nfavour an extreme feedback scheme in which a significant fraction of the\nbaryons are expelled from the cores of halos. This model is, however, in\ncontrast with the thermodynamical properties of observed halos, which might\nsuggest that weak-lensing masses are overestimated. We note that a mass bias\n$1-b=0.58$ as required to reconcile Planck CMB and cluster counts should\ntranslate into an even lower baryon fraction, which poses a major challenge to\nour current understanding of galaxy clusters.

However, too strong a SN\nfeedback also leads to the universe reionizing too late, and the metallicities\nof Milky Way satellites being too low.

Here we revisit and assess the\nreliability of CaT as a metallicity indicator using our new stellar population\nsynthesis simulations based on empirical, high-resolution fluxes.

I then describe a new perspective\nbased on the following features: (1) As in the case of any other matter field,\nthe gravitational field equations should also remain unchanged if a constant is\nadded to the Lagrangian; in other words, the field equations of gravity should\nremain invariant under the transformation $T^a_b \\to T^a_b + \\delta^a_b\n$(constant). (2) Each event of spacetime has a certain number ($f$) of\nmicroscopic degrees of freedom (`atoms of spacetime'). This quantity $f$ is\nproportional to the area measure of an equi-geodesic surface, centered at that\nevent, when the geodesic distance tends to zero. The spacetime should have a\nzero-point length in order for $f$ to remain finite. (3) The dynamics is\ndetermined by extremizing the heat density at all events of the spacetime. The\nheat density is the sum of a part contributed by matter and a part contributed\nby the atoms of spacetime, with the latter being $L_P^{-4} f$.

Once such a halo\nreaches $\\approx 10^9~M_\\odot$, corresponding to the Jeans mass of the\nphotoheated intergalactic medium (IGM) at $z\\approx 7$, pristine gas is able to\ncollapse into the halo, potentially producing a massive Pop III starburst.

Wide-field near-IR surveys with HST are generally inefficient,\nas guide star acquisitions make it impractical to observe more than one\npointing per orbit. This limitation can be circumvented by guiding with gyros\nalone, which is possible as long as the telescope has three functional gyros.\nThe method presented here allows us to observe mosaics of eight independent\nWFC3-IR pointings in a single orbit by utilizing the fact that HST drifts by\nonly a very small amount in the 25 seconds between non-destructive reads of\nunguided exposures. By shifting the reads and treating them as independent\nexposures the full resolution of WFC3 can be restored. We use this \"drift and\nshift\" (DASH) method in the Cycle 23 COSMOS-DASH program, which will obtain 456\nWFC3 $H_{160}$ pointings in 57 orbits, covering an area of 0.6 degree$^2$ in\nthe COSMOS field down to $H_{160} = 25$.

Based on\nthe assumption of this energy equipartition, we determine the galactic\nsynchrotron flux as a function of redshift z. The conditions in the early\nUniverse are different from the present day, in particular the galaxies have\nmore intense star formation. To cover a large range of conditions we consider\nmodels based on two different systems: one model galaxy comparable to the Milky\nWay and one typical high-z starburst galaxy. We include a model of the steady\nstate cosmic ray spectrum and find that synchrotron emission can be detected up\nto cosmological redshifts with current and future radio telescopes. Turbulent\ndynamo theory is in agreement with the origin of the observed correlation\nbetween the far-infrared (FIR) luminosity L_FIR and the radio luminosity\nL_radio. Our model reproduces this correlation well at z=0. We extrapolate the\nFIR-radio correlation to higher redshift and predict a time evolution with a\nsignificant deviation from its present-day appearance already at z~2 for a gas\ndensity that increases strongly with z. In particular, we predict a decrease of\nthe radio luminosity with redshift which is caused by the increase of cosmic\nray energy losses at high z. The result is an increase of the ratio between\nL_FIR and L_radio. Simultaneously, we predict that the slope of the FIR-radio\ncorrelation becomes shallower with redshift. This behavior of the correlation\ncould be observed in the near future with ultra-deep radio surveys. \n\n"}

Typically overlooked in the\nliterature, in this paper we aim to quantify the impact of the opacity\nbroadening effects on the current interpretation of the CO suprathermal line\nprofiles. Without any additional contributions to the gas velocity field, a\nlarge fraction of the apparently supersonic (${\\cal M}\\sim$2-3) linewidths\nmeasured in both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO (J=1-0) lines can be explained by the\nsaturation of their corresponding sonic-like, optically-thin C$^{18}$O\ncounterparts assuming standard isotopic fractionation. Combined with the\npresence of multiple components detected in our C$^{18}$O spectra, these\nopacity effects seem to be also responsible of the highly supersonic linewidths\n(${\\cal M}>$8-10) detected in the broadest $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO spectra in\nTaurus.

This\nprovided a very complete inventory of neutral and ionic C-, N- and S- bearing\nspecies with, up to our knowledge, the first secure detections of the\ndeuterated ions DCS+ and DOCO+. We used a state-of-the-art\npseudo-time-dependent gas-phase chemical model to determine the value of the\ncosmic ray ionization rate and the depletion factors. The observational data\nwere well fitted with $\\zeta_{H_2}$ between 3E-17 s$^{-1}$ and 1E-16 s$^{-1}$.\nElemental depletions were estimated to be ~10 for C and O, ~1 for N and ~25 for\nS. Barnard B1b presents similar depletions of C and O than those measured in\npre-stellar cores. The depletion of sulfur is higher than that of C and O but\nnot as extreme as in cold cores. In fact, it is similar to the values found in\nsome bipolar outflows, hot cores and photon-dominated regions. Several\nscenarios are discussed to account for these peculiar abundances. We propose\nthat it is the consequence of the initial conditions (important outflows and\nenhanced UV fields in the surroundings) and a rapid collapse (~0.1 Myr) that\npermits to maintain most S- and N-bearing species in gas phase to great optical\ndepths. The interaction of the compact outflow associated with B1b-S with the\nsurrounding material could enhance the abundances of S-bearing molecules, as\nwell. \n\n"}

Here we present a power spectrum\nanalysis of the dust column density of a diffuse cirrus at high Galactic\nlatitude (l ~ 198 deg, b ~ 32 deg) as derived from the combination of a MegaCam\ng-band image, obtained as part of the MATLAS large programme at the CFHT, with\nPlanck radiance and Wise 12 micron data. The combination of these three\ndatasets have allowed us to compute the density power spectrum of the HI over\nscales of more than three orders of magnitude. We found that the density field\nis well described by a single power law over scales ranging from 0.01 to 50 pc.\nThe exponent of the power spectrum, gamma=-2.9 +- 0.1, is compatible with what\nis expected for thermally bi-stable and turbulent HI.

Motivated by\nthis departure from anisotropy, we examined the spatial distribution of\nsatellites around pairs of galaxies in the SDSS.

This is an idealized model for the dead zones that may be present\nat some radii in protoplanetary and dwarf novae disks. We vary the relative\nthickness of the dead and active zones to quantify how forced fluid motions in\nthe dead zone change. We find that the residual Reynolds stress near the\nmid-plane decreases with increasing dead zone thickness, becoming negligible in\ncases where the active to dead mass ratio is less than a few percent. This\nimplies that purely Ohmic dead zones would be vulnerable to episodic accretion\noutbursts via the mechanism of Martin & Lubow (2011).

The convective luminosity in the\nburning shells of carbon, neon, oxygen, and then silicon, are very high. Based\non the behavior of active main sequence stars we speculate that the convective\nshells can trigger magnetic activity with a power of about 0.001 times the\nconvective luminosity. Magnetic flux tubes might buoy outward, and deposit\ntheir energy in the outer parts of the envelope. This in turn might lead to the\nexpansion of the envelope and to an enhanced mass loss rate.

The magnetic activity requires minimum core rotation and that the\nstochastic magnetic activity be on its high phase.

We have found an HI intensity depression in the velocity range\nbetween $-46$ and $-28$ km s$^{-1}$ toward the SNR, suggesting a cavity in the\ninterstellar medium. The HI cavity coincides with the thermal and non-thermal\nemitting X-ray shell. The thermal X-rays are coincident with the edge of the HI\ndistribution, which indicates a strong density gradient, while the non-thermal\nX-rays are found toward the less dense, inner part of the HI cavity. The most\nsignificant non-thermal X-rays are seen toward the southwestern part of the\nshell where the HI gas traces the dense and cold component. We also identified\nCO clouds which are likely interacting with the SNR shock waves in the same\nvelocity range as the HI, although the CO clouds are distributed only in a\nlimited part of the SNR shell. The most massive cloud is located in the\nsoutheastern part of the shell, showing detailed correspondence with the\nthermal X-rays. These CO clouds show an enhanced CO $J$ = 2-1/1-0 intensity\nratio, suggesting heating/compression by the shock front. We interpret that the\nshock-cloud interaction enhances non-thermal X-rays in the southwest and the\nthermal X-rays are emitted by the shock-heated gas of density 10-100 cm$^{-3}$.\nMoreover, we can clearly see an HI envelope around the CO cloud, suggesting\nthat the progenitor had a weaker wind than the massive progenitor of the\ncore-collapse SNR RX J1713.7$-$3949.

In this paper (PaperII), we explore the\nreliability of the measured total gas mass, dust surface density and dust\ntemperature maps derived from modified blackbody fitting of synthetic Herschel\nobservations. We found from our pixel-by-pixel analysis of the measured dust\nsurface density and dust temperature a worrisome error spread especially close\nto star-formation sites and low-density regions, where for those \"contaminated\"\npixels the surface densities can be under/overestimated by up to three orders\nof magnitude. In light of this, we recommend to treat the pixel-based results\nfrom this technique with caution in regions with active star formation. In\nregions of high background typical in the inner Galactic plane, we are not able\nto recover reliable surface density maps of individual synthetic regions, since\nlow-mass regions are lost in the FIR background.

To do so, we\nquantify the azimuthal dependence of the stacked lensing signal around seven\ndifferent proxies for the orientation of the dark matter distribution, as it is\na priori unknown which one traces the orientation best.

Modeling the signal with an elliptical\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile on scales < 250 kpc, which roughly\ncorresponds to half the virial radius, and assuming that the BCG is perfectly\naligned with the dark matter, we find an average halo ellipticity of e_h=0.38\n+/- 0.12.

(ii) FDM halos are comprised of a core\nthat is a stationary, minimum-energy configuration called a \"soliton\",\nsurrounded by an envelope that resembles a CDM halo.

Our 3-D hydrodynamic AGN jet-ICM\n(intracluster medium) simulations, looking at the detailed angular momentum\ndistribution of cold gas and its time variability for the first time, show that\nthe angular momentum of the cold gas crossing $\\lesssim 1$ kpc is essentially\nisotropic.

In addition to the\ntransits of a planet in front of its star and the eclipses of the planet by its\nstar, researchers have reported flux variations at the orbital frequency and\nits harmonics: planetary reflection and/or emission and Doppler beaming of\nstarlight produce one peak per orbit, while ellipsoidal variations of a tidally\ndistorted star and/or planet produce two maxima per orbit. Researchers have\nalso reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital\nfrequency, sometimes much greater than the predictions of tidal theory. The\nreflected phase variations of a homogeneous planet contains power at even\norbital harmonics-important for studies of ellipsoidal variations-but cannot\ncontain odd orbital harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be\nproduced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet\nwith a North-South (N-S) asymmetric map. Either of these scenarios entail\nweather: short-period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and hence N-S\nsymmetric stellar forcing. North-South asymmetry in a giant planet would\ntherefore suggest stochastic localized features, such as weather.

Although time-variable\nalbedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the\ninfrared variability of hot Jupiters make this hypothesis unlikely.

The radially\ncooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and\npeanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a\nvertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,\nvelocity dispersion that dominates this evolution.

Abstract: High contrast imaging instruments such as GPI and SPHERE are discovering gap\nstructures in protoplanetary disks at an ever faster pace. Some of these gaps\nmay be opened by planets forming in the disks. In order to constrain planet\nformation models using disk observations, it is crucial to find a robust way to\nquantitatively back out the properties of the gap-opening planets, in\nparticular their masses, from the observed gap properties, such as their depths\nand widths. Combing 2D and 3D hydrodynamics simulations with 3D radiative\ntransfer simulations, we investigate the morphology of planet-opened gaps in\nnear-infrared scattered light images. Quantitatively, we obtain correlations\nthat directly link intrinsic gap depths and widths in the gas surface density\nto observed depths and widths in images of disks at modest inclinations under\nfinite angular resolution. Subsequently, the properties of the surface density\ngaps enable us to derive the disk scale height at the location of the gap $h$,\nand to constrain the quantity $M_{\\rm p}^2/\\alpha$, where $M_{\\rm p}$ is the\nmass of the gap-opening planet and $\\alpha$ characterizes the viscosity in the\ngap.

As the most comprehensive statistics, this PDF encodes all\ncosmological information of large-scale modes, therefore, could serve as the\nbasis in the LSS modelling. Following the so-called PDF-based method from\nturbulence, we write down this PDF's evolution equation, which describes the\nprobability conservation. We show that this conservation equation's\ncharacteristic curves follow the same PDF history and could be considered as an\neffective dynamics of the coarse-grained field. Unlike the EFT of LSS, which\nconceptually would work at both realization and statistics level, this\neffective dynamics is valid only statistically. However, this `statistical\nequivalence' also provides valuable insight into scale interactions at the\nstatistical level. It also enables predicting a wide variety of statistics\nbeyond the typical N-point polyspectra, including, e.g. topologies, density PDF\nand non-linear covariance matrices etc. Our formula expresses the small-scale\neffect as the ensemble average of their interactions conditional on the\nlarge-scale modes. This suggests an interesting way to measure effective terms\ndirectly from simulation. By applying the Gram-Charlier expansion, we\ndemonstrate a different structure of these effective terms. This formalism is a\nnatural framework for discussing the evolution of statistical properties of\nlarge-scale modes, and provides an alternative view for understanding the\nrelationship between general effective dynamics and standard perturbation\ntheory. \n\n"}

In particular, the fraction of ionizing radiation\nthat escapes the local environment to the intergalactic medium is poorly known.\nWe investigate the relation between the escape fraction and galaxy luminosity.\nWe combine the deep ultraviolet observations of Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UVUDF)\nwith the deep Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of the same\nfield, collecting a sample of 165 faint star forming galaxies in the $3 < z <\n4$ redshift range with deep rest-frame observations of the Lyman continuum.

Our study combines the dataset from our previous\nwork with new observations of 55 additional objects. We have investigated 92\nYSO candidates in total, 11 of which have been definitely identified with giant\nstars unrelated to Lupus. The stellar and accretion properties of the 81 bona\nfide YSOs, which represent more than 90% of the whole class~II and transition\ndisc YSO population in the aforementioned Lupus clouds, have been homogeneously\nand self-consistently derived, allowing for an unbiased study of accretion and\nits relationship with stellar parameters. The accretion luminosity, Lacc,\nincreases with the stellar luminosity, Lstar, with an overall slope of ~1.6,\nsimilar but with a smaller scatter than in previous studies. There is a\nsignificant lack of strong accretors below Lstar~0.1Lsun, where Lacc is always\nlower than 0.01Lstar. We argue that the Lacc-Lstar slope is not due to\nobservational biases, but is a true property of the Lupus YSOs.

The\nkinematics of the molecular gas in this feature can be interpreted (albeit not\nuniquely) as accelerating at a rate of 1 km s^-1 pc^-1. In this scenario, the\ngas is approaching escape velocity at the last measured point. Strikingly,\nbright tracers of dense molecular gas (HCN, CN, HCO+, CS) are also detected in\nthe molecular outflow: We measure an HCN(1-0)/CO(1-0) line ratio of ~1/10 in\nthe outflow, similar to that in the central starburst region of NGC 253 and\nother starburst galaxies. By contrast, the HCN/CO line ratio in the NGC 253\ndisk is significantly lower (~1/30), similar to other nearby galaxy disks.

Our model injects supersonic, low density,\ncollimated and magnetised outflows in cluster centres, which are then stopped\nby the surrounding gas, thermalise and inflate low-density cavities filled with\ncosmic-rays. We perform high-resolution, non-radiative simulations of the lobe\ncreation, expansion and disruption, and find that its dynamical evolution is in\nqualitative agreement with simulations of idealised low-density cavities that\nare dominated by a large-scale Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The buoyant rising\nof the lobe does not create energetically significant small-scale chaotic\nmotion in a volume-filling fashion, but rather a systematic upward motion in\nthe wake of the lobe and a corresponding back-flow perpendicular to it. We find\nthat, overall, 50 per cent of the injected energy ends up in material which is\nnot part of the lobe, and about 25 per cent remains in the inner 100 kpc. We\nconclude that jet-inflated, buoyantly rising cavities drive systematic gas\nmotions which play an important role in heating the central regions, while\nmixing of lobe material is sub-dominant.

Abstract: Radio relics in galaxy clusters are believed to trace merger shock fronts. If\ncosmological structure formation determines the luminosity, size and shape\ndistributions of radio relics then merger shocks need to be lighted up in a\nhomogeneous way. We investigate if a mock relic sample, obtained from zoomed\ngalaxy cluster simulations, is able to match the properties of relics measured\nin the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). We compile a list of all radio relics known\nto date and homogeneously measure their parameters in all NVSS images and apply\nthe same procedure to relics in our simulations. Number counts in the mock\nrelic sample increase more steeply towards lower relic flux densities,\nsuggesting an incompleteness of NVSS in this regime. Overall, we find that NVSS\nand mock samples show similar properties. However, large simulated relics tend\nto be somewhat smaller and closer to the cluster centre than observed ones.\nBesides this, the mock sample reproduces very well-known correlations for radio\nrelics, in particular those relating the radio luminosity with the largest\nlinear size and the X-ray luminosity. We show that these correlations are\nlargely governed by the sensitivity of the NVSS observations. Mock relics show\na similar orientation with respect to the direction to the cluster centre as\nthe NVSS sample. Moreover, we find that their maximum radio luminosity roughly\ncorrelates with cluster mass, although displaying a large scatter. The overall\ngood agreement between NVSS and the mock sample suggests that properties of\nradio relics are indeed governed by merger shock fronts, emitting in a\nhomogeneous fashion. Our study demonstrates that the combination of mock\nobservations and data from upcoming radio surveys will allow to shed light on\nboth the origin of radio relics and the nature of the intracluster medium. \n\n"}

Dust scattering was\nrecently recognized as a potential contributor to polarization, although its\nbasic properties have yet to be thoroughly explored. Here, we quantify the\neffects of optical depth on the scattering-induced polarization in inclined\ndisks through a combination of analytical illustration, approximate\nsemi-analytical modeling using formal solution to the radiative transfer\nequation, and Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the near-side of the disk\nis significantly brighter in polarized intensity than the far-side, provided\nthat the disk is optically thick and that the scattering grains have yet to\nsettle to the midplane. This asymmetry is the consequence of a simple geometric\neffect: the near-side of the disk surface is viewed more edge-on than the\nfar-side. It is a robust signature that may be used to distinguish the\nscattering-induced polarization from that by other mechanisms, such as aligned\ngrains. The asymmetry is weaker for a geometrically thinner dust disk. As such,\nit opens an exciting new window on dust settling. We find anecdotal evidence\nfrom dust continuum imaging of edge-on disks that large grains are not yet\nsettled in the youngest (Class 0) disks, but become more so in older disks.\nThis trend is corroborated by the polarization data in inclined disks showing\nthat younger disks have more pronounced near-far side asymmetry and thus less\ngrain settling.

In addition to the nominal simulation run with\nrealistic Milky Way parameters, we vary the rotation and shear rates, but keep\nthe absolute value of their ratio fixed. Reversing the sign of shear vs.\nrotation allows us to separate the rotation- and shear-generated contributions.\nAs in earlier studies, we find the generation of significant amounts of\nvorticity, with on average 65% of the kinetic energy being in the rotational\nmodes.

We compare the abundances of some key element\nindicators of mixing (He, CNO) with the predictions of evolutionary models for\nsingle objects and for stars in interacting binary systems. Results: The\nproperties of half of the sample stars can be reproduced by single evolutionary\nmodels, even in the case of probable or confirmed binaries that can therefore\nbe true single stars in a pre-interaction configuration. The main problem for\nthe rest of the sample is a mismatch for the [N/O] abundance ratio (we confirm\nthe existence of fast rotators with a lack of nitrogen enrichment) and/or a\nhigh helium abundance that cannot be accounted for by models. Modifying the\ndiffusion coefficient implemented in single- star models does not solve the\nproblem as it cannot simultaneously reproduce the helium abundances and [N/O]\nabundance ratios of our targets. Since part of them actually are binaries, we\nalso compared their chemical properties with predictions for post-mass transfer\nsystems. We found that these models can explain the abundances measured for a\nmajority of our targets, including some of the most helium-enriched, but fail\nto reproduce them in other cases. Our study thus reveals that some physical\ningredients are still missing in current models. \n\n"}

However, there may be significant bias and\nscatter in these measurements due to, among other things, the so-called\nmass-sheet degeneracy. To estimate these uncertainties, we analyze strong\nlenses from the largest EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation. We apply a mass-sheet\ntransformation to the radial density profiles of lenses, and by selecting\nlenses near isothermality, we find that the bias on H0 can be reduced to 5%\nwith an intrinsic scatter of 10%, confirming previous results performed on a\ndifferent simulation data set. We further investigate whether combining lensing\nobservables with kinematic constraints helps to minimize this bias. We do not\ndetect any significant dependence of the bias on lens model parameters or\nobservational properties of the galaxy, but depending on the source--lens\nconfiguration, a bias may still exist. Cross lenses provide an accurate\nestimate of the Hubble constant, while fold (double) lenses tend to be biased\nlow (high). With kinematic constraints, double lenses show bias and intrinsic\nscatter of 6% and 10%, respectively, while quad lenses show bias and intrinsic\nscatter of 0.5% and 10%, respectively.

We present a mechanism\nthat causes such a spin-orbit misalignment for a protoplanetary disc due to its\nmovement through an ambient medium. Our physical explanation of the mechanism\nis based on the theoretical solutions to the Stark problem. We test this idea\nby performing self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations and simplified\ngravitational $N$-body simulations. The $N$-body model reduces the mechanism to\nthe relevant physical processes. The hydrodynamical simulations show the\nmechanism in its full extent, including gas-dynamical and viscous processes in\nthe disc which are not included in the theoretical framework. We find that a\nprotoplanetary disc embedded in a flow changes its orientation as its angular\nmomentum vector tends to align parallel to the relative velocity vector. Due to\nthe force exerted by the flow, orbits in the disc become eccentric, which\nproduces a net torque and consequentially changes the orbital inclination. The\ntilting of the disc causes it to contract. Apart from becoming lopsided, the\ngaseous disc also forms a spiral arm even if the inclination does not change\nsubstantially. The process is most effective at high velocities and\nobservational signatures are therefore mostly expected in massive star-forming\nregions and around winds or supernova ejecta.

The total survey area of ~1.6 sq.deg.\nincludes ~105 peaks with peaks brighter than 0.5 Jy/beam (43 associated with\nembedded protostars or disks) and 237 peaks of 0.125-0.5 Jy/beam (50 with\nembedded protostars or disks). Each field has enough bright peaks for flux\ncalibration relative to other peaks in the same field, which improves upon the\nnominal flux calibration uncertainties of sub-mm observations to reach a\nprecision of ~2-3% rms, and also provides quantified confidence in any measured\nvariability. The timescales and amplitudes of any sub-mm variation will then be\nconverted into variations in accretion rate and subsequently used to infer the\nphysical causes of the variability. This survey is the first dedicated survey\nfor sub-mm variability and complements other transient surveys at optical and\nnear-IR wavelengths, which are not sensitive to accretion variability of deeply\nembedded protostars. \n\n"}

The end of millions of\nyears of massive star evolution and the beginning of hundreds or thousands of\nyears of supernova evolution are separated by a matter of a few seconds, in\nwhich some of the most extreme physics found in the Universe causes the\nexplosive and terminal disruption of the star.

Interestingly, some pristine Solar System\nmaterials show enrichments in $^{15}$N with respect to the pre-Solar nebula\nvalue.

The fact that disc galaxies are ubiquitous in the local Universe\nsuggests that a quiescent history is not necessary for their formation. Modern\ncosmological simulations can now obtain relatively realistic populations of\ndisc galaxies, but it still remains to be clarified how discs manage to survive\nmassive mergers. Here we use a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical\nsimulations set in a LambdaCDM cosmology to elucidate the fate of discs\nencountering massive mergers. We extract a sample of approximately 100 disc\ngalaxies and follow the changes in their post-merger morphologies, as tracked\nby their disc-to-total ratios (D/T). We also examine the relations between\ntheir present-day morphology, assembly history and gas fractions. We find that\napproximately half of present-day disc galaxies underwent at least one merger\nwith a satellite of total mass exceeding the host system's stellar mass, a\nthird had mergers with satellites of mass exceeding 3 times the host's stellar\nmass, and approximately one-sixth had mergers with satellites of mass exceeding\n10 times of the host's stellar mass. These mergers lead to a sharp, but often\ntemporary, decrease in the D/T of the hosts, implying that discs are usually\ndisrupted but then quickly re-grow. To do so, high cold gas fractions are\nrequired post-merger, as well as a relatively quiescent recent history (over a\nfew Gyrs before z=0). Our results show that discs can form via diverse merger\npathways and that quiescent histories are not the dominant mode of disc\nformation. \n\n"}

In this work we reduce this degeneracy by\ncombining weak lensing together with strong lensing and stellar kinematics. Our\nanalysis is based on two galaxy samples: 45 strong lenses from the SLACS survey\nand 1,700 massive quiescent galaxies from the SDSS main spectroscopic sample\nwith weak lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. We use a\nBayesian hierarchical approach to jointly model all three observables. We fit\nthe data with models of varying complexity and show that a model with a radial\ngradient in the stellar mass-to-light ratio is required to simultaneously\ndescribe both galaxy samples. This result is driven by a subset of strong\nlenses with very steep total density profile, that cannot be fitted by models\nwith no gradient. Our measurements are unable to determine whether $M_*/L$\ngradients are due to variations in stellar population parameters at fixed IMF,\nor to gradients in the IMF itself.

The\nmain effect of strong lensing selection is to shift the stellar mass\ndistribution towards the high mass end, while the halo mass and stellar IMF\ndistribution at fixed stellar mass are not significantly affected. \n\n"}

The effects of an X-ray flare, which suddenly increases\nthe X-ray flux by $10^5 \\times$ are then studied. A cloud exposed to a bright\nflare has 99% of its CO destroyed in 10-20 years, whereas it takes $>10^3$\nyears for 99% of the H$_2$ to be destroyed.

We examine the evolution of these clouds in light of recent\nclaims that they may trigger condensation of gas from the Galactic corona as\nthey move through it. We measure condensation along a cloud's wake, with and\nwithout the presence of an ambient magnetic field, using two- (2D) and\nthree-dimensional (3D), high-resolution simulations. We find that 3D\nsimulations are essential to correctly capture the condensation in all cases.\nMagnetic fields significantly inhibit condensation in the wake of clouds at $t\n\\gtrsim 25$ Myr, preventing the sharp upturn in cold gas mass seen in previous\nnon-magnetic studies. The magnetic field suppresses the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability responsible for the ablation and consequent mixing of a cloud with\nhalo gas which drives the condensation. This effect is universal across\ndifferent cloud properties (density, metallicity, velocity) and magnetic field\nproperties (strength and orientation). Simple convergence tests demonstrate\nthat resolving the gas on progressively smaller scales leads to even less\ncondensation.

With the aim of obtaining a more\ncomplete view of the incidence of magnetic fields in degenerate stars, we have\nstarted a long-term campaign of high-precision spectropolarimetric observations\nof white dwarfs. Here we report the results obtained so far with the\nlow-resolution FORS2 instrument of the ESO VLT and the medium-resolution ISIS\ninstrument of the WHT. We have considered a sample of 48 stars, of which five\nare known magnetic or suspected magnetic stars, and obtained new longitudinal\nmagnetic field measurements with a mean uncertainty of about 0.6 kG. Overall,\nin the course of our survey (the results of which have been partially published\nin papers devoted to individual stars) we have discovered one new weak-field\nmagnetic white dwarf, confirmed the magnetic nature of another, found that a\nsuspected magnetic star is not magnetic, and suggested two new candidate\nmagnetic white dwarfs.

This raises the prospect that both \"direct\"\nradiation pressure produced by absorption of photons leaving stellar surfaces\nand \"indirect\" radiation pressure from photons absorbed and then re-emitted by\ndust grains may be important sources of feedback in such systems. Here we\nevaluate this possibility by deriving the conditions under which a spheroidal,\nself-gravitating, mixed gas-star cloud can avoid catastrophic disruption by the\ncombined effects of direct and indirect radiation pressure.

Each model demonstrated the formation of\nclear X-structures with different flatness. We have obtained that opening\nangles lie in the range from 25 deg to 42 deg throughout the entire evolution.\nThese values are roughly consistent with observational data. The greatest\nvariation in the opening angles is obtained by varying the mass of the dark\nhalo. The initial thickness of the disc and the Toomre parameter are\nresponsible for smaller variations of the angle and shorter X-structures. An\nincrease of both parameters changes the morphology of in-plane bars and\nX-structures. In some cases we observed even double X-structures. The main\neffect of the bulge is to prevent buckling at intermediate and late stages of\nthe disc evolution. Comparison of models with different halo masses indicates\nthat the smallest observable values of opening angles can be associated with\nthe presence of a heavy dark halo (more than 3 masses of the disc within the\noptical radius). \n\n"}

It can therefore be used to characterize the systems\nthat host such variable stars. We want to take advantage of the F/1O\ndouble-mode Cepheids listed in the Gaia DR2 catalogue to derive the metallicity\ngradient in the Milky Way disk. The metallicity is derived from the ratio of\nthe first overtone and fundamental periods provided by Gaia DR2 while the Gaia\nDR2 parallaxes are used to determine the Galactocentric distances of the stars.\nFrom a visual inspection of the light curves, it turns out that a large\nfraction (77%) of the Galactic F/1O double-mode Cepheids in Gaia DR2 are\nspurious detections. Gaia DR2 provides 3 new bona fide F/1O Cepheids.

Abstract: Only star clusters that are sufficiently compact and massive survive largely\nunharmed beyond 10 Myr. However, their compactness means a high stellar density\nwhich can lead to strong gravitational interactions between the stars. As young\nstars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on\npotentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these\nstrong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties\nof planetary systems. Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact\nhigh-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the\ngas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions. We concentrate\non the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations\nshow that in high-mass open clusters $80-90\\%$ of all disks/planetary systems\nshould be smaller than 50 AU just due to the strong stellar interactions in\nthese environments. Already in the initial phases, 3-4 close fly-bys lead to\ntypical disk sizes within the range of 18-27 AU. Afterwards, the disk sizes are\naltered only to a small extent. Our findings agree with the recent observation\nthat the disk sizes in the once dense environment of the Upper Scorpio OB\nassociation, NGC~2362, and h/$\\chi$Persei are at least three times smaller in\nsize than, for example, in Taurus. We conclude that the observed planetary\nsystems in high-mass open clusters should also be on average smaller than those\nfound around field stars; in particular, planets on wide orbits are expected to\nbe extremely rare in such environments. \n\n"}

Tracing these\nformer nuclei of stripped galaxies provides a unique way to track the assembly\nhistory of a galaxy or galaxy cluster. In this paper we present a new method to\nestimate how many UCDs host an SMBH in their center and thus are stripped\ngalaxy nuclei. We revisit the dynamical mass measurements that suggest many\nUCDs have more mass than expected from stellar population estimates, which\nrecent observations have shown is due to the presence of an SMBH. We revise the\nstellar population mass estimates using a new empirical relation between the\nmass-to-light ratio (M/L) and metallicity, and use this to predict which UCDs\nare most likely to host an SMBH. This enables us to calculate the fraction of\nUCDs that host SMBHs across their entire luminosity range for the first time.\nWe then apply the SMBH occupation fraction to the observed luminosity function\nof UCDs and estimate that in the Fornax and Virgo cluster alone there should be\n$69^{+32}_{-25}$ stripped nuclei with SMBHs. This analysis shows that stripped\nnuclei with SMBHs are almost as common in clusters as present-day galaxy\nnuclei. We estimate the local SMBH number density in stripped nuclei to\n$3-8\\times10^{-3}Mpc^{-3}$, which represents a significant fraction (10-40\\%)\nof the SMBH density in the local Universe. These SMBHs hidden in stripped\nnuclei will increase expected event rates for tidal disruption events and\nSMBH-SMBH and SMBH-BH mergers. The existence of numerous stripped nuclei with\nSMBHs are a direct consequence of hierarchical galaxy formation, but until now\ntheir impact on the SMBH density had not been quantified. \n\n"}

A recent study of LBVs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)\nfound instead that LBVs are considerably more isolated than either O-type stars\nor WRs, with a distribution intermediate between that of the WRs and red\nsupergiants (RSGs). A similar study, using a more restricted sample of LBVs,\nreached the opposite conclusion. Both studies relied upon the distance to the\nnearest spectroscopically identified O-type star to define the degree of\nisolation. However, our knowledge of the spectroscopic content of the LMC is\nquite spotty. Here we re-examine the issue using carefully defined photometric\ncriteria to select the highest mass unevolved stars (\"bright blue stars,\" or\nBBSs), using spatially complete photometric catalogs of the LMC, M31, and M33.\nOur study finds that the LBVs are no more isolated than BBSs or WRs.

We identify three major evolutionary channels driving the\nbinaries to coalescence: two standard paths along which the binary evolution is\ndriven by interactions with the stellar and/or gaseous environment, and a novel\nchannel where MBHB coalescence occurs during the interaction with a third black\nhole. For each channel, we follow the orbital evolution of MBHBs with\nphysically motivated models that include a self-consistent treatment of the\norbital eccentricity. We find that LISA will detect between $\\approx 25$ and\n$\\approx 75$ events per year depending on the seed model. We show that\ntriple-induced coalescences can range from a few detected events up to $\\sim\n30\\%$ of the total detected mergers. Moreover, even if the standard\ngas/stars-driven evolutionary channels should fail and MBHBs were to stall,\ntriple interactions would still occur as a result of the hierarchical nature of\ngalaxy formation, resulting in about $\\approx 10$ to $\\approx 20$ LISA\ndetections per year. Remarkably, triple interactions among the black holes can\nproduce coalescing binaries with large eccentricities ($\\gtrsim 0.9$) upon\nentrance into the LISA band. This eccentricity will remain significant ($\\sim\n0.1$) also at merger, requiring suitable templates for parameter estimation. \n\n"}

A near-\nto mid-infrared colour such as K-[22] is a good probe for the dust mass-loss\nrate of the stars.

Because of mass loss, $Z \\leq 0.5$ $Z_\\odot$ is necessary for stars\nto form He cores massive enough (i.e., mass $>40 ~M_\\odot$) to undergo PPI. The\nhydrodynamical phase of evolution from PPI through the beginning of Fe core\ncollapse is calculated for the He cores with masses of $40 - 62 ~M_\\odot$ and\n$Z = 0$. During PPI, electron-positron pair production causes a rapid\ncontraction of the O-rich core which triggers explosive O-burning and a\npulsation of the core. We study the mass dependence of the pulsation dynamics,\nthermodynamics, and nucleosynthesis. The pulsations are stronger for more\nmassive He cores and result in such a large amount of mass ejection such as $3\n- 13$ $M_\\odot$ for $40 - 62 ~M_\\odot$ He cores.

One such property is that the\n``standard candle'' nature of the SN at peak brightness allows a direct\ndetermination of the lensing magnification factor for each well observed image.\nAnother is that the duration of an SN event is of the same order as the\ndifferential time delays between the various lens images. The comparable time\nscales of the photometric event and the time delay invite a variety of\napplications, including high precision measurements of the delay and the\ntargeting of especially interesting phases of the explosion for intensive\nobservation when they appear in trailing images. As an initial exploration of\nthese possibilities we present calculations of SN lensing statistics in a\n``concordance cosmology''. We emphasize magnification and time delay effects.\nPlausible SN surveys, such as the proposed SNAP space mission, would discover\nseveral to some tens of strongly lensed SNe Ia per year, and at least a few of\nthese will be at redshifts well beyond those that would be accessible via\nunlensed events.

We also find that, once the proto-stellar\ncollapse has started, HD effects are quite negligible. Instead, HD effects can\nbe important during the intermediate stage of gas fragmentation: objects below\na certain mass scale (~3x10^5 Msun at z_vir=20 in our ``fiducial'' case) can be\ncooled by HD down to T~50-100 K, whereas H2 cooling never takes the gas below\nT~200 K.

The so-called\n`special' quasinormal modes with purely imaginary frequency emerge naturally.\nThe significance of the degrees of freedom in the choice of the two frame\nvectors is discussed, and we demonstrate that, for a certain frame choice, the\nunderlying dynamics is governed purely by the Regge-Wheeler tensor. The two\ntransverse-traceless Weyl tensors which carry the curvature of gravitational\nwaves are discussed. \n\n"}

This covariant description is used to study analytically the\nresponse of the Lukash spacetime to linear perturbations. We find that the\nstability of the vacuum solution depends crucially on the background shear\nanisotropy.

We here challenge this paradigm by performing\nthree-dimensional simulations of the collapse of uniformly rotating stars to\nblack holes without excision. We show that this choice, combined with suitable\ngauge conditions and the use of minute numerical dissipation, improves\ndramatically the long-term stability of the evolutions. In turn, this allows\nfor the calculation of the waveforms well beyond what previously possible,\nproviding information on the black-hole ringing and setting a new mark on the\npresent knowledge of the gravitational-wave emission from the stellar collapse\nto a rotating black hole. \n\n"}

Our proposal is motivated\nwithin a Liouville string formulation of quantum gravity that also suggests a\nfrequency-dependent refractive index of the particle vacuum. We construct an\nexplicit realization by treating photon propagation through quantum excitations\nof $D$-brane fluctuations in the space-time foam. These are described by\nhigher-genus string effects, that lead to stochastic fluctuations in couplings,\nand hence in the velocity of light. We discuss the possibilities of\nconstraining or measuring photon diffusion ``in vacuo'' via $\\gamma$-ray\nobservations of distant astrophysical sources. \n\n"}

Although $D$-term inflation model has the\nexcellent property that it is free from the so-called $\\eta$- problem, two\nserious problems appear when we embed $D$-term inflation in string theory, the\nmagnitude of FI term and the rolling motion of the dilation. In the present\npaper, we analyze the potential of $D$-term inflation in type I inspired models\nand study the behavior of dilaton and twisted moduli fields. Adopting the\nnon-perturbative superpotential induced by gaugino condensation, the twisted\nmoduli can be stabilized. If the dilaton is in a certain range, it evolves very\nslowly and does not run away to infinity. Thus $D$-term dominated vacuum energy\nbecomes available for driving inflation. By studying the density perturbation\ngenerated by the inflation model, we derive the constraints on model parameters\nand give some implications on $D$-term inflation in type I inspired models. \n\n"}

We point out that in certain physical situations the\ncontribution from non-zero mass is non-negligible. In particular, in the\nmechanism for the production of Gamma Ray Bursts via emission of heavy axions\nthe axion mass m_a ~ 1MeV is comparable with the temperature of the nuclear\nmedium and thus can not be disregarded.

As a result of\nthis model-independent analysis, we point out that meeting these requirements\nin a completely natural way is inherently difficult. In particular, we\nre-examine the role of gravitinos and Kaluza-Klein gravitons in this context\nand find them disfavoured as a solution to the small-scale problems in case\nthey are DM candidates generated in the decay of thermally produced WIMPs. We\npropose right-handed sneutrinos and right-handed Kaluza-Klein neutrinos as\nalternatives. We find that they are viable dark matter candidates, but that\nthey can contribute to a solution of the small scale problems only in case the\nassociated Dirac neutrino mass term appears as a subdominant contribution in\nthe neutrino mass matrix. \n\n"}
