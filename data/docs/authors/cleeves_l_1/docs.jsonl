Cloud formation is an old-fashioned but still\noutstanding problem for the Earth atmosphere, and it has turned into a\nchallenge for the modelling of brown dwarf and exo-planetary atmospheres. Cloud\nformation imposes strong feedbacks on the atmospheric structure, not only due\nto the clouds own opacity, but also due to the depletion of the gas phase,\npossibly leaving behind a dynamic and still supersaturated atmosphere.

We analysed the new spectra, together with those existing in\nthe literature and studied the distribution of the objects in U-B and B-V\ncolours, optical and X-ray luminosity, and variability amplitude.

In one of the plausible models for explaining the\nphenomenon, the modulation is caused by the effects of a magnetic field. So\nfar, the available observational data have not allowed us to either support nor\nrule out the presence of a magnetic field in RR Lyrae stars.

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems.

Our\nsimulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in\nmean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's\nperturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed\nrate of MMRs.

The regions have overdensities that\ndeviate by (-2, -1, 0, +1, +2)sigma from the cosmic mean, where sigma is the\nrms mass fluctuation on a scale of ~20Mpc/h at z=1.5.

We find that the specific SFR\ndensity at z <~ 10 varies systematically from region to region by up to an\norder of magnitude, but the global value, averaged over all volumes, reproduces\nobservational data. Massive, compact galaxies, similar to those observed in the\nGOODS fields, form in the overdense regions as early as z=6, but do not appear\nin the underdense regions until z~3.

Mid-infrared observations have revealed the nature of some of the\nmolecules in the MOLsphere, some being the precursor of dust.

The relevant phases are prompt and steady-state convection, the\nstanding accretion shock instability (SASI), and asymmetric explosions. For the\nstages before explosion, we propose a model for the source of GW emission.\nDowndrafts of the postshock-convection/SASI region strike the protoneutron star\n\"surface\" with large speeds and are decelerated by buoyancy forces. We find\nthat the GW amplitude is set by the magnitude of deceleration and, by\nextension, the downdraft's speed and the vigor of postshock-convective/SASI\nmotions. However, the characteristic frequencies, which evolve from ~100 Hz\nafter bounce to ~300-400 Hz, are primarily independent of these speeds, but are\nset by the deceleration timescale, which is in turn set by the buoyancy\nfrequency at the lower boundary of postshock convection. Consequently, the GW\ncharacteristic frequencies are dependent upon a combination of core structure\nattributes, specifically the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) and details\nthat determine the gradients at the boundary, including the accretion-rate\nhistory, the EOS at subnuclear densities, and neutrino transport.

We find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in any\ntidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the cluster\nlives long enough for the overdensities to build up.\n  The distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the cluster\ncentre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and the\nstrength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time,\nwhile for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causing\na periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distance\noscillate with time. We provide an approximation for estimating the distance of\nthe overdensities in this case.\n  We describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidal\ntails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal field\non the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous. Moreover, we conclude that a\npericentre passage or a disk shock is not the direct origin of an overdensity\nwithin a tidal tail.

In this paper we use the different metallicity\ndependance of X-ray photoevaporation and planet formation to discriminate\nbetween these two processes. We study the effects of metallicity, Z, on the\ndispersal timescale, t_phot, in the context of a photoevaporation model, by\nmeans of detailed thermal calculations of a disc in hydrostatic equilibrium\nirradiated by EUV and X-ray radiation from the central source. Our models show\nt_phot \\propto Z^0.52 for a pure photoevaporation model. By means of analytical\nestimates we derive instead a much stronger negative power dependance on\nmetallicity of the disc lifetime for a dispersal model based on planet\nformation. A census of disc fractions in lower metallicity regions should\ntherefore be able to distinguish between the two models. A recent study by\nYasui et al. in low metallicity clusters of the extreme outer Galaxy ([O/H] ~-\n0.7dex and dust to gas ratio of ~0.001) provides preliminary observational\nevidence for shorter disc lifetimes at lower metallicities, in agreement with\nthe predictions of a pure photoevaporation model.

The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and\ninclude grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the\nresistivity of the gas. The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri\nstars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar\nX-ray luminosity, but can be produced by varying these together with the disk\nmagnetic flux. The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling\nof grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence,\nthrough three effects: (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically\ninactive dead zone extending above two scale heights, while turbulence in the\nmagnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only\nabout one scale height. (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically\nin waves driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the\nlaminar rates, so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk\natmosphere becomes dust-depleted. (3) With sufficient depletion, the dead zone\nis thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The MHD results also\nshow that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of dust into the\natmosphere. The photosphere height changes by up to one-third over a few\norbits, while the extinction along lines of sight grazing the disk surface\nvaries by factors of two over times down to 0.1 orbit.

Seemingly\nunrelated observations have discovered that there is a lopsided stellar disk of\nunknown origin orbiting the BH in M31, and possibly many other systems. We show\nthat these nominally independent puzzles are in fact closely related.\nMulti-scale simulations of gas inflow from galactic to BH scales show that when\nsufficient gas is driven towards a BH, gravitational instabilities form a\nlopsided, eccentric disk that propagates inwards from larger radii. The\nlopsided stellar disk exerts a strong torque on the remaining gas, driving\ninflows that fuel the growth of the BH and produce quasar-level luminosities.\nThe same disk can produce significant obscuration along many sightlines and\nthus may be the putative 'torus' invoked to explain obscured active galactic\nnuclei and the cosmic X-ray background. The stellar relic of this disk is long\nlived and retains the eccentric pattern. Simulations that yield quasar-level\naccretion rates produce relic stellar disks with kinematics, eccentric\npatterns, precession rates, and surface density profiles in reasonable\nagreement with observations of M31.

The radiative transfer\nformulation took full account of emission, absorption, re-emission, Faraday\nrotation and Faraday conversion explicitly. High time-resolution intensity maps\nwere generated, frame-by-frame, to track the spatial hydrodynamical and\nradiative properties of the evolving jets.

In this\npaper we investigate how the properties of such shells influence the SN\nlightcurve by conducting numerical simulations of the interaction between an\nexpanding SN and a circumstellar shell ejected a few years prior to core\ncollapse. Our parameter study explores how the emergent luminosity depends on a\nrange of circumstellar shell masses, velocities, geometries, and wind mass-loss\nrates, as well as variations in the SN mass and energy. We find that the shell\nmass is the most important parameter, in the sense that higher shell masses (or\nhigher ratios of M_shell/M_SN) lead to higher peak luminosities and higher\nefficiencies in converting shock energy into visual light. Lower mass shells\ncan also cause high peak luminosities if the shell is slow or if the SN ejecta\nare very fast, but only for a short time. Sustaining a high luminosity for\ndurations of more than 100 days requires massive circumstellar shells of order\n10 M_sun or more. This reaffirms previous comparisons between pre-SN shells and\nshells produced by giant eruptions of luminous blue variables (LBVs), although\nthe physical mechanism responsible for these outbursts remains uncertain. The\nlightcurve shape and observed shell velocity can help diagnose the approximate\nsize and density of the circumstellar shell, and it may be possible to\ndistinguish between spherical and bipolar shells with multi-wavelength\nlightcurves. These models are merely illustrative.

Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid.

We carried out\nsimulations of synthetic solar cycles with a flux transport model, which\nfollows the cyclic evolution of the surface field determined by flux emergence\nand advective transport by near-surface flows. In each hemisphere, an\naxisymmetric band of latitudinal flows converging towards the central latitude\nof the activity belt was superposed onto the background poleward meridional\nflow. The overall effect of the flow perturbation is to reduce the latitude\nseparation of the magnetic polarities of a bipolar magnetic region and thus\ndiminish its contribution to the polar field.

We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation. We\nestimate that a pure deflagration supernova explosion at a distance of 1 kpc\nwould trigger about 14 events in the future 50 kt liquid scintillator detector\nand some 19 events in a 0.5 Mt water Cherenkov-type detector. Conclusions:\nWhile in contrast to core-collapse supernovae neutrinos carry only a very small\nfraction of the energy produced in the thermonuclear supernova explosion, the\nSN Ia neutrino signal provides information that allows us to unambiguously\ndistinguish between different possible explosion scenarios. These studies will\nbecome feasible with the next generation of proposed neutrino observatories. \n\n"}

An increase in M_cl and/or \\beta\nleads to the formation of protostellar disks that are more susceptible to\ngravitational instability. Disk fragmentation occurs in most models but its\neffect is often limited to the very early stage, with the fragments being\neither dispersed or driven onto the forming star during tens of orbital\nperiods. Only cloud cores with high enough M_cl or \\beta may eventually form\nwide-separation binary/multiple systems with low mass ratios and brown dwarf or\nsub-solar mass companions. It is feasible that such systems may eventually\nbreak up, giving birth to rogue brown dwarfs. Protostellar disks of {\\it equal}\nage formed from cloud cores of greater mass (but equal \\beta) are generally\ndenser, hotter, larger, and more massive. On the other hand, protostellar disks\nformed from cloud cores of higher \\beta (but equal M_cl) are generally thinner\nand colder but larger and more massive.

Its domain of applicability, that is baryonic densities ranging from about\n$\\rho>10^8$ g $\\cdot$ cm$^{-3}$ to normal nuclear density, temperatures between\n1 and 20 MeV and proton fractions between 0.5 and 0, make it suitable for the\ndescription of baryonic matter produced in supernovae explosions and\nproto-neutron stars. The first finding is that, contrary to the common belief,\nthe crust-core transition is not first order, and for all subsaturation\ndensities matter can be viewed as a continuous fluid mixture between free\nnucleons and massive nuclei. As a consequence, the equations of state and the\nassociated observables do not present any discontinuity over the whole\nthermodynamic range.

II.\n  Measuring the Size of the \"Frozen\" Zone Abstract: Coagulation of submicron-sized dust grains into porous aggregates is the\ninitial step of dust evolution in protoplanetary disks. Recently, it has been\npointed out that negative charging of dust in the weakly ionized disks could\nsignificantly slow down the coagulation process. In this paper, we apply the\ngrowth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (\"frozen\" zone)\nwhere the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage. For\nlow-turbulence disks, we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of\nthe disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star. The maximum mass of the\naggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer\nmasses at 100 AU. Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the\nfrozen zone, but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic\naggregates at later stages. We examine a possibility that complete freezeout of\ndust evolution in low-turbulence disks could be prevented by global transport\nof dust in the disks. Our simple estimation shows that global dust transport\ncan lead to the supply of macroscopic aggregates and the removal of frozen\naggregates on a timescale of 10^6 yr. This overturns the usual understanding\nthat tiny dust particles get depleted on much shorter timescales unless\ncollisional fragmentation is effective.

Here, we classify all the\ntransiting systems known to date according to their potential for producing\nshocks that could cause observable light curve asymmetries.

We\nresolve the emission from the protostar radio Source I and BN at several\nepochs. Source I is highly elongated NW-SE, and remarkably stable in flux\ndensity, position angle, and overall morphology over nearly a decade. This\nfavors the extended emission component arising from an ionized disk rather than\na jet. We have measured the proper motions of Source I and BN for the first\ntime at 43 GHz. We confirm that both sources are moving at high speed (12 and\n26 km/s, respectively) approximately in opposite directions, as previously\ninferred from measurements at lower frequencies. We discuss dynamical scenarios\nthat can explain the large motions of both BN and Source I and the presence of\ndisks around both. Our new measurements support the hypothesis that a close\n(~50 AU) dynamical interaction occurred around 500 years ago between Source I\nand BN as proposed by Gomez et al. From the dynamics of encounter we argue that\nSource I today is likely to be a binary with a total mass on the order of 20\nMsun, and that it probably existed as a softer binary before the close\nencounter. This enables preservation of the original accretion disk, though\ntruncated to its present radius of ~50 AU. N-body numerical simulations show\nthat the dynamical interaction between a binary of 20 Msun total mass (I) and a\nsingle star of 10 Msun mass (BN) may lead to the ejection of both and binary\nhardening. The gravitational energy released in the process would be large\nenough to power the wide-angle flow traced by H2 and CO emission in the BN/KL\nnebula. Assuming the proposed dynamical history is correct, the smaller mass\nfor Source I recently estimated from SiO maser dynamics (>7 Msun) by Matthews\net al., suggests that non-gravitational forces (e.g. magnetic) must play an\nimportant role in the circumstellar gas dynamics. \n\n"}

The aim of the present work is to quantify the mass-loss\nrates (dm/dt), heating efficiencies (eta), and lifetimes for the whole sample\nof transiting exoplanets, now including hot jupiters, hot neptunes, and hot\nsuper-earths. The mass-loss rates and lifetimes are estimated from an \"energy\ndiagram\" for exoplanets, which compares the planet gravitational potential\nenergy to the stellar X/EUV energy deposited in the atmosphere. We estimate the\nmass-loss rates of all detected transiting planets to be within 10^6 to 10^13\ng/s for various conservative assumptions. High heating efficiencies would imply\nthat hot exoplanets such the gas giants WASP-12b and WASP-17b could be\ncompletely evaporated within 1 Gyr. We further show that the heating efficiency\ncan be constrained when dm/dt is inferred from observations and the stellar\nX/EUV luminosity is known.

Our goal was to detect the\nRossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, the anomalous radial velocity observed during\neclipses of rotating stars, which can be used to study the obliquities of\nplanet-hosting stars. For WASP-1 a weak signal of a prograde orbit was detected\nwith ~2sigma confidence, and for WASP-2 no signal was detected. The resulting\nupper bounds on the RM amplitude have different implications for these two\nsystems, because of the contrasting transit geometries and the stellar types.\nBecause WASP-1 is an F7V star, and such stars are typically rapid rotators, the\nmost probable reason for the suppression of the RM effect is that the star is\nviewed nearly pole-on.

In this model,\nstar formation occurs in gravitationally bound protocluster clumps embedded in\nlarger giant molecular clouds with the protocluster clump mass function\nfollowing a power law function with a slope of -2.

Irradiation is\nknown to weaken the strength of disc self-gravity, and can suppress it entirely\nif the disc is maintained above the threshold for linear instability. However,\nits impact on the susceptibility of the disc to fragmentation is less clear. We\nuse two-dimensional numerical simulations to investigate the evolution of\nself-gravitating discs as a function of the local cooling time and strength of\nirradiation. In the regime where the disc does not fragment, we show that local\nthermal equilibrium continues to determine the stress - which can be\nrepresented as an effective viscous alpha - out to very long cooling times (at\nleast 240 dynamical times). In this regime, the power spectrum of the\nperturbations is uniquely set by the effective viscous alpha and not by the\ncooling rate. Fragmentation occurs for cooling times tau < beta_crit / Omega,\nwhere beta_crit is a weak function of the level of irradiation. We find that\nbeta_crit declines by approximately a factor of two, as irradiation is\nincreased from zero up to the level where instability is almost quenched. The\nnumerical results imply that irradiation cannot generally avert fragmentation\nof self-gravitating discs at large radii; if other angular momentum transport\nsources are weak mass will build up until self-gravity sets in, and\nfragmentation will ensue. \n\n"}

Abstract: Following a simulation approach of recent publications we explore the\nviability of the neutrino-heating explosion mechanism in dependence on the\nspatial dimension. Our results disagree with previous findings. While we also\nobserve that two-dimensional (2D) models explode for lower driving neutrino\nluminosity than spherically symmetric (1D) models, we do not find that\nexplosions in 3D occur easier and earlier than in 2D. Moreover, we find that\nthe average entropy of matter in the gain layer hardly depends on the dimension\nand thus is no good diagnostic quantity for the readiness to explode. Instead,\nmass, integrated entropy, total neutrino-heating rate, and nonradial kinetic\nenergy in the gain layer are higher when models are closer to explosion.\nCoherent, large-scale mass motions as typically associated with the standing\naccretion-shock instability (SASI) are observed to be supportive for explosions\nbecause they drive strong shock expansion and thus enlarge the gain layer.\nWhile 2D models with better angular resolution explode clearly more easily, the\nopposite trend is seen in 3D. We interpret this as a consequence of the\nturbulent energy cascade, which transports energy from small to large spatial\nscales in 2D, thus fostering SASI activity. In contrast, the energy flow in 3D\nis in the opposite direction, feeding fragmentation and vortex motions on\nsmaller scales and thus making the 3D evolution with finer grid resolution more\nsimilar to 1D. More favorable conditions for explosions in 3D may therefore be\ntightly linked to efficient growth of low-order SASI modes including\nnonaxisymmetric ones. \n\n"}

Standard practice is to quantify the initial turbulent\nvelocity field in a core in terms of the amount of turbulent energy (or some\nequivalent) and the exponent in the power spectrum (n \\equiv -d log Pk /d log\nk). In this paper, we present a numerical study of the influence of the details\nof the turbulent velocity field on the collapse of an isolated, weakly\nturbulent, low-mass prestellar core. We show that, as long as n > 3 (as is\nusually assumed), a more critical parameter than n is the maximum wavelength in\nthe turbulent velocity field, {\\lambda}_MAX. This is because {\\lambda}_MAX\ncarries most of the turbulent energy, and thereby influences both the amount\nand the spatial coherence of the angular momentum in the core.

Joint observations provide sufficient data to look into the behavior\nof IGR J17473--2721 at the rising part of the outburst.

This fits into a scenario in which the corona is cooled by the soft\nX-rays along the outburst evolution, as observed in several other atoll\nsources. By using the flux measured in the 1.5--30 keV band of the type-I\nbursts during the outburst, we find that the linear relationship between the\nburst duration and the flux still holds for those bursts that occur at the\ndecaying part of the low hard state, but with a different slope than the\noverall one that was estimated with the bursts happening in the whole extent\nof, and for the rest of the low hard state.

Evolving A enables one\nto use any interpolation scheme on refinement level boundaries and still\nguarantee that the magnetic field remains divergenceless. As in classical EM, a\ngauge choice must be made when evolving A, and we chose a straightforward\n\"algebraic\" gauge condition to simplify the A evolution equation. However,\nmagnetized black hole-neutron star (BHNS) simulations in this gauge exhibit\nunphysical behavior, including the spurious appearance of strong magnetic\nfields on refinement level boundaries. This spurious behavior is exacerbated\nwhen matter crosses refinement boundaries during tidal disruption of the NS.\nApplying Kreiss-Oliger dissipation to the evolution of the magnetic vector\npotential A slightly weakens this spurious magnetic effect, but with undesired\nconsequences. We demonstrate via an eigenvalue analysis and a numerical study\nthat zero-speed modes in the algebraic gauge, coupled with the frequency\nfiltering that occurs on refinement level boundaries, are responsible for the\ncreation of spurious magnetic fields. We show that the EM Lorenz gauge exhibits\nno zero-speed modes, and as a consequence, spurious magnetic effects are\nquickly propagated away, allowing for long-term, stable magnetized BHNS\nevolutions. Our study demonstrates how the EM gauge degree of freedom can be\nchosen to one's advantage, and that for magnetized BHNS simulations the Lorenz\ngauge constitutes a major improvement over the algebraic gauge. \n\n"}

Such a trend requires neutron fluences larger than\nthose so far assumed, as these last would have too few neutrons per iron seed.\nWe suggest that the observed enhancements can be produced by nucleosynthesis in\nAGB stars of low mass (M < 1.5M\\odot), if they release neutrons from the\n^{13}C({\\alpha},n)^{16}O reaction in reservoirs larger by a factor of 4 than\nassumed in more massive AGBs (M > 1.5M\\odot).

Our aim is to determine precisely the abundance distribution of HDO\ntowards the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422 and learn more about the water\nformation mechanisms by determining the HDO/H2O abundance ratio. A spectral\nsurvey of the source IRAS16293-2422 was carried out in the framework of the\nCHESS Herschel Key program with the HIFI instrument, allowing the detection of\nnumerous HDO lines. Other transitions have been observed previously with\nground-based telescopes. The spherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code\nRATRAN was used to reproduce the observed line profiles of HDO by assuming an\nabundance jump. To determine the H2O abundance throughout the envelope, a\nsimilar study was made of the H2-18O observed lines, as the H2O main isotope\nlines are contaminated by the outflows. We derive an inner HDO abundance of\n1.7e-7 and an outer HDO abundance of 8e-11. To reproduce the HDO absorption\nlines, it is necessary to add an absorbing layer in front of the envelope. It\nmay correspond to a water-rich layer created by the photodesorption of the ices\nat the edges of the molecular cloud. The HDO/H2O ratio is ~1.4-5.8% in the hot\ncorino whereas it is ~0.2-2.2% in the outer envelope. It is estimated at ~4.8%\nin the added absorbing layer. Although it is clearly higher than the cosmic D/H\nabundance, the HDO/H2O ratio remains lower than the D/H ratio derived for other\ndeuterated molecules observed in the same source. The similarity of the ratios\nderived in the hot corino and in the added absorbing layer suggests that water\nformed before the gravitational collapse of the protostar, contrary to\nformaldehyde and methanol, which formed later once the CO molecules had\ndepleted on the grains. \n\n"}

Here we propose a novel scenario for the\nproduction of planetary systems at such orbits, through the dynamical recapture\nof free floating planets (FFPs) in dispersing stellar clusters. This process is\na natural extension of the recently suggested scenario for the formation of\nwide stellar binaries. We use N-body simulations of dispersing clusters with\n10-1000 stars and comparable numbers of FFPs to study this process. We find\nthat planets are captured into wide orbits in the typical range ~100-10^6 AU,\nand have a wide range of eccentricities (thermal distribution). Typically, 3-6\nx (f_FFP/1) % of all stars capture a planetary companion with such properties\n(where f_FFP is the number of FFP per star). The planetary capture efficiency\nis comparable to that of capture-formed stellar-binaries, and shows a similar\ndependence on the cluster size and structure. It is almost independent of the\nspecific planetary mass; planets as well as sub-stellar companions of any mass\ncan be captured. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster size,\nand for a given cluster size the it increases with the host/primary mass. More\nthan one planet can be captured around the same host and planets can be\ncaptured into binary systems. Planets can also be captured into pre-existing\nplanetary and into orbits around black holes and massive white dwarfs, if these\nformed early enough before the cluster dispersal. In particular, stellar black\nholes have a high capture efficiency (>50 % and 5-10 x (f_FFP/1) % for capture\nof stars and planetary companions, respectively) due to their large mass.\nFinally, although rare, two FFPs or brown dwarfs can become bound and form a\nFFP-binary system with no stellar host. \n\n"}

Methods: One-dimensional (1D) local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (LTE) and 1D NLTE barium abundances were derived using classical 1D\nATLAS stellar model atmospheres. The three-dimensional (3D) LTE abundances were\nobtained for 8 red giants on the lower RGB, by adjusting their 1D LTE\nabundances using 3D-1D abundance corrections, i.e., the differences between the\nabundances obtained from the same spectral line using the 3D hydrodynamical\n(CO5BOLD) and classical 1D (LHD) stellar model atmospheres.

It is commonly assumed that the high ambient densities and\nintense radiation fields in galactic nuclei imply short cooling times, thus\nmaking the outflows momentum-conserving. We show that cooling of high-velocity,\nshocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances,\nincluding conditions relevant to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs),\nresulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast\nenergy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler\ngas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity\nv_in>~10,000 km s^-1, as observed in ultra-violet and X-ray absorption, the\nshocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal\npressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate\ndirectly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton\ncooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with v_in~1,000 km\ns^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience\nenergy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions. During the\nenergy-conserving phase, the momentum flux of an outflow is boosted by a factor\n~v_in/2v_s by work done by the hot post-shock gas, where v_s is the velocity of\nthe swept-up material. Energy-conserving outflows driven by fast AGN winds\n(v_in~0.1c) may therefore explain the momentum fluxes Pdot>>L_AGN/c of\ngalaxy-scale outflows recently measured in luminous quasars and ULIRGs. Shocked\nwind bubbles expanding normal to galactic disks may also explain the\nlarge-scale bipolar structures observed in some systems, including around the\nGalactic Center, and can produce significant radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray\nemission.

We find that convective viscosity is likely strong enough to stabilize\nradial pulsations whenever nuclear-burning (the epsilon-mechanism) is the\ndominant source of driving. This suggests that massive main sequence stars with\nZ <~ 2 x 10^-3 are pulsationally stable and are unlikely to experience\npulsation-driven mass loss on the main sequence. These conclusions are,\nhowever, sensitive to the form of the convective viscosity and highlight the\nneed for further high-resolution simulations of the convection-oscillation\ninteraction. For more metal-rich stars (Z >~ 2 x 10^-3), the dominant\npulsational driving arises due to the kappa-mechanism arising from the\niron-bump in opacity and is strong enough to overcome convective damping.

The\nobserved bending of the jet can be produced by a relative motion of the HH 30\nstar with respect to its surrounding environment, caused either by a possible\nproper motion of the HH 30 star, or by the entrainment of environment gas by\nthe red lobe of the nearby L1551-IRS 5 outflow. Alternatively, the bending can\nbe produced by the stellar wind from a nearby CTTS, identified in the 2MASS\ncatalog. The proper motion velocities of the knots of the counterjet show more\nvariations than those of the jet. In particular, we identify two knots of the\ncounterjet that have the same kinematic age but whose velocities differ by\nalmost a factor of two. Thus, it appears that counterjet knots launched\nsimultaneously can be ejected with very different velocities. We confirm that\nthe observed wiggling of the jet and counterjet arises from the orbital motion\nof the jet source in a binary system. Precession is of secondary importance in\nshaping the jet.

We show that there exists an upper limit to the\nmagnetic interaction torque and energy dissipation rate in such model.

One mechanism to reconcile the simulations with\nthe observed data is the feedback from star formation, this might be successful\nin isolated dwarf galaxies but its success in LSB galaxies remains unclear.\nAdditionally, including too much feedback in the simulations is a double-edged\nsword, in order to obtain a cored DM distribution from an initially cuspy one,\nthe feedback recipes usually require to remove a large quantity of baryons from\nthe center of galaxies, however, some feedback recipes produce twice more\nsatellite galaxies of a given luminosity and with much smaller mass to light\nratios from those that are observed.

We show that\nphotosynthetic processes can be sustained on such planets. The DNA-weighted UV\nradiation dose for an Earth-like planet in the CHZ is less than the maxima\nencountered on Earth, hence non-magnetic white dwarfs are compatible with the\npersistence of complex life. Polarisation due to a terrestrial planet in the\nCHZ of a cool white dwarf is 10^2 (10^4) times larger than it would be in the\nhabitable zone of a typical M-dwarf (Sun-like star).

Given the age of the system, this\nplanet should have been tidally circularized a long time ago. Many attempts to\nexplain this were proposed in recent years, either involving abnormally weak\ntides, or the perturbing action of a distant companion. We address here the\nlatter issue based on Kozai migration. We propose that GJ 436b was formerly\nlocated further away from the star and that it underwent a migration induced by\na massive, inclined perturber via Kozai mechanism. In this context, the\nperturbations by the companion trigger high amplitude variations to GJ 436b\nthat cause tides to act at periastron. Then the orbit tidally shrinks to reach\nits present day location. We numerically integrate the 3-body system including\ntides and General Relativity correction. We first show that starting from the\npresent-day location of GJ 436b inevitably leads to damping the Kozai\noscillations and to rapidly circularizing the planet. Conversely, starting from\n5-10 times further away allows the onset of Kozai cycles. The tides act in peak\neccentricity phases and reduce the semi-major axis of the planet. The net\nresult is an evolution characterized by two phases: a first one with Kozai\ncycles and a slowly shrinking semi-major axis, and a second one once the planet\ngets out of the Kozai resonance characterized by a more rapid decrease. The\ntimescale of this process appears in most cases much longer than the standard\ncircularization time of the planet by a factor larger than 50. This model can\nprovide a solution to the eccentricity paradox of GJ 436b. Depending on the\nvarious orbital configurations, it can take several Gyrs to GJ 436b to achieve\na full orbital decrease and circularization. According to this scenario, we\ncould be witnessing today the second phase of the scenario where the semi-major\naxis is already reduced while the eccentricity is still significant. We then\nexplore the parameter space and derive in which conditions this model can be\nrealistic given the age of the system. This yields constraints on the\ncharacteristics of the putative companion. \n\n"}

This spin-up mechanism is one possible explanation for\nthe rapid rotators detected among the population of generally slow-rotating red\ngiant stars. These rapid rotators thus comprise a unique stellar sample\nsuitable for searching for signatures of planet accretion in the form of\nunusual stellar abundances due to the dissemination of the accreted planet in\nthe stellar envelope. In this study, we look for signatures of replenishment in\nthe Li abundances and (to a lesser extent) 12C/13C, which are both normally\nlowered during RGB evolution. Accurate abundances were measured from high\nsignal-to-noise echelle spectra for samples of both slow and rapid rotator red\ngiant stars. We find that the rapid rotators are on average enriched in lithium\ncompared to the slow rotators, but both groups of stars have identical\ndistributions of 12C/13C within our measurement precision.

This feature can be very useful to probe the superdense core\nmatter of neutron stars, and the strong gravity regime.

It is known that the\nfractional rms amplitude increases with energy at lower energies. At higher\nenergies, the amplitude is usually believed to saturate, although this is not\nestablished.

Yet, it\nremains one of the hardest processes to understand when trying to connect\nobservations of stellar and galaxy populations to models of large scale\nstructure formation. The star formation rate at redshifts z > 2 drops off\nrather more quickly than was thought even five years ago. Theoretical models\nhave tended to overpredict the star formation rate at these high redshifts\nsubstantially, primarily due to overcooling. Overcooling in galaxies typically\noccurs because of unphysical radiative cooling. As a result, insufficient\nturbulence is driven by stellar feedback. I show that such turbulence has the\nnet effect of strongly inhibiting star formation, despite its ability to\nlocally promote star formation by compression. Radiation pressure appears less\nlikely to be a dominant driver of the turbulence than has been argued, but\nsupernova and magnetorotational instabilities remain viable. Gravity alone\ncannot be the main driver, as otherwise well-resolved models without feedback\nwould accurately predict star formation rates. Star formation rate surface\ndensity correlates well with observed molecular gas surface density, as well as\nwith other tracers of high density material. Correlation does not, however,\nimply causation. It appears that both molecule formation and star formation\noccur as a consequence of gravitational collapse, with molecules not essential\nin cooling. The basic concept that gravitational instability drives star\nformation remains a true guide through the thickets of complexity surrounding\nthis topic. I finally briefly note that understanding ionization heating and\nradiation pressure from the most massive stars will likely require much higher\nresolution models (sub-parsec scale) than resolving supernova feedback.\n(lightly abridged) \n\n"}

Updated Doppler\nmeasurements combined with published transit observations significantly refine\nthe constraints on the orbital solution. The analysis of the infrared spectrum\nand photometry confirm that the star is enriched in metals compared to the Sun.\nUsing all this information, combined with empirical mass-luminosity relations\nfor low mass stars, we derive updated values for the bulk properties of the\nstar-planet system.

The first and simplest model, M1, has a\nsingle free parameter, and assumes that the relative axes of a core are drawn\nrandomly from a log-normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation\n\\sigma o.

II Abstract: In a previous paper we have shown that the function \\Gamma(M,\nEOS)=\\alpha\\beta_{GR}/\\Lambda^{0.9}(R) is constant (~ 0.4) for pre\nmain-sequence stars (PMS), white dwarfs (WD) and for some neutron star (NS)\nmodels, where \\alpha_{GR} and \\beta_{GR} are the form-factors of the\ngravitational potential energy and of the moment of inertia. To investigate the\nstructural evolution of another type of celestial bodies, we use the MESA code\nto extend these calculations to gaseous planets. We show that this function is\nconserved for all models during the whole planetary evolution and is\nindependent of the planet mass. We also analyse the cases for which this\nfunction is not conserved during some stellar evolutionary phases. For the PMS\nto the WD cooling sequences, we have found a connection between the strong\nvariations of \\Gamma(M, EOS) during the intermediary evolutionary phases and\nthe specific nuclear power. A threshold for the specific nuclear power was\ndetermined. Below this limit this function is invariant (~ 0.4) for these\nmodels, i.e., at the initial and final stages (PMS and WD). Concerning NS, we\nstudy the influence of the equation of state (EOS) on this function and refine\nthe exponent of the auxiliary function \\Lambda(R) to be ~ 0.8. It is shown that\nthe function \\Gamma(M, EOS) is also invariant (~ 0.4) and is independent of the\nEOS and of the stellar mass. Therefore, we confirm that regardless of the final\nproducts of the stellar evolution, NS or WD, they recover the initial value of\n\\Gamma(M, EOS) ~ 0.4 acquired at the PMS.

The viability of the disk fragmentation scenario for the formation of\nwide-orbit companions in protostellar disks around (sub-)solar mass stars was\ninvestigated. Methods: We used numerical hydrodynamics simulations of disk\nformation and evolution with an accurate treatment of disk thermodynamics. The\nuse of the thin-disk limit allowed us to probe the long-term evolution of\nprotostellar disks. We focused on models that produced wide-orbit GP/BD\nembryos, which opened a gap in the disk and showed radial migration timescales\nsimilar to or longer than the typical disk lifetime. Results: While disk\nfragmentation was seen in the majority of our models, only 6 models out of 60\nrevealed the formation of quasi-stable, wide-orbit GP/BD embryos. Disk\nfragmentation produced GP/BD embryos with masses in the 3.5-43 M_J range,\ncovering the whole mass spectrum of directly-imaged, wide-orbit companions to\n(sub-)solar mass stars.

In such cases, we show that the two limb\ndarkening coefficients are constrained by three physical boundary conditions,\ndescribing a triangular region in the two-dimensional parameter space. We show\nthat uniformly distributed samples may be drawn from this region with optimal\nefficiency by a technique developed by computer graphical programming:\ntriangular sampling. Alternatively, one can make draws using a uniform,\nbivariate Dirichlet distribution. We provide simple expressions for these\nparametrizations for both techniques applied to the case of quadratic,\nsquare-root and logarithmic limb darkening laws.

The critical evidence is\nthe 0.4 dex deficiency of [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and other hydrostatic elements,\ncontrasting with the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H]. Supporting\nevidence comes from the hydrostatic element (O, Mg, Na, Al, Cu) [X/Fe] ratios,\nwhich are inconsistent with iron added to the Milky Way (MW) disk trends. Also,\nthe ratio of hydrostatic to explosive (Si, Ca, Ti) element abundances suggests\na relatively top-light IMF.

Finally, models that describe\nfundamental interactions (e.g. quantum gravity and the extension of the\nStandard Model) can be tested.

Abstract: Magnetic fields have been hypothesized to inflate the radii of low-mass\nstars---defined as less than 0.8 solar masses---in detached eclipsing binaries\n(DEBs).

A scaling relation between X-ray luminosity and surface magnetic flux\nindicates that model surface magnetic field strength predictions are consistent\nwith observations.

WR 138 is an X-ray bright WR star that has been described as a triple\nsystem, including a compact companion in a short-period orbit. Aims. Our goal\nis to search for spectroscopic evidence of a compact companion around WR 138.\nMethods. We used optical and X-ray spectra to search for signatures of a\ncompact companion, which can be revealed by systematic variations in WR optical\nspectral lines induced by orbital motion of the compact companion or by hard,\nluminous X-rays from accretion onto this companion. Results. The optical\nspectra display emission-line profile variations that are most probably caused\nby clumps inside the stellar winds. The radial velocities do not vary on a\nshort time-scale compatible with the suggested orbital period of a putative\ncompact companion. The X-ray spectra are found to be normal for a WN5-6+OB\nsystem with no indication of accretion by a compact companion.

We employ a kinematic mean-field model for\npoloidal field transport and focus on steady states where inward advection of a\nfield balances with outward diffusion due to effective resistivities. We\nanalytically derive the steady-state radial distribution of poloidal fields in\nhighly conducting accretion disks. The analytic solution reveals an upper limit\non the strength of large-scale vertical fields attainable in steady states. Any\nexcess poloidal field will be diffused away within a finite time, and we\ndemonstrate this with time-dependent numerical calculations of the mean-field\nequations. We apply this upper limit to large-scale vertical fields threading\nprotoplanetary disks. We find that the maximum attainable strength is about 0.1\nG at 1 AU, and about 1 mG at 10 AU from the central star.

Our best\nfit model reproduces the overall shape and surface brightness of the observed\nbow shock and suggests that the space velocity and mass-loss rate of IRC-10414\nare $\\approx$50 ${\\rm km} \\, {\\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\\approx$$10^{-6}$ $M_\\odot \\,\n{\\rm yr}^{-1}$, respectively, and that the number density of the local ISM is\n$\\approx$3 ${\\rm cm}^{-3}$. It also shows that the bow shock emission comes\nmainly from the shocked stellar wind.

In this paper,\nwe investigate the structure and gravitational stability of the protostellar\ndisks in the full metallicity range between zero and the solar value. Using the\nmass-accretion rates evaluated from the thermal evolution in the preceding\ncollapse phase of the pre-stellar cores, we calculate disk structures and their\nevolution in the framework of the standard steady disks. Overall, with higher\nmetallicity, more efficient cooling results in the lower accretion rate and\nlower temperature inside the disk: at zero metallicity, the accretion rate is ~\n1e-3Msun/yr and the disk temperature is ~ 1000 K, while at solar metallicity, ~\n1e-6Msun/yr and 10 K. Despite the large difference in these values, the zero-\nand solar-metallicity disks have similar stability properties: the Toomre\nparameter for the gravitational stability, which can be written using the ratio\nof temperatures in the disk and in the envelope as Q ~ (T_disk/T_env)^3/2, is >\n1, i.e., marginally stable. At intermediate metallicities of 1e-5--1e-3Zsun,\nhowever, the disks are found to be strongly unstable with Q ~ 0.1--1 since dust\ncooling, which is effective only in the disks due to their high density (> 1e10\ncm^-3), makes the temperature in the disks lower than that in the envelopes.\nThis indicates that masses of the individual stars formed as a result of the\nprotostellar disk fragmentation can be significantly smaller than their parent\ncore in this metallicity range.

It is now viewed as a\ncommon, though still poorly understood, phenomenon in low-mass star formation.\nThe FU Orionis objects (FUors) are long-studied examples of this phenomenon.\nFUors are believed to undergo accretion outbursts during which the accretion\nrate rapidly increases from typically $10^{-7}$ to a few $10^{-4}$ $M_\\odot$\nyr$^{-1}$, and remains elevated over several decades or more. EXors, a loosely\ndefined class of pre-main sequence stars, exhibit shorter and repetitive\noutbursts, associated with lower accretion rates. The relationship between the\ntwo classes, and their connection to the standard pre-main sequence\nevolutionary sequence, is an open question: do they represent two distinct\nclasses, are they triggered by the same physical mechanism, and do they occur\nin the same evolutionary phases? Over the past couple of decades, many\ntheoretical and numerical models have been developed to explain the origin of\nFUor and EXor outbursts. In parallel, such accretion bursts have been detected\nat an increasing rate, and as observing techniques improve each individual\noutburst is studied in increasing detail. We summarize key observations of\npre-main sequence star outbursts, and review the latest thinking on outburst\ntriggering mechanisms, the propagation of outbursts from star/disk to disk/jet\nsystems, the relation between classical EXors and FUors, and newly discovered\noutbursting sources -- all of which shed new light on episodic accretion.

ETGs brighter than $M_r=-21$\nmag are older than 13 Gyr and spend up to 10 Gyr of their overall evolutionary\ntime in the BC before they reach the RS migrating through the GV.

The relative abundances of the two flavours in the\ninterstellar medium are still very uncertain, and this abundance ratio has a\nsignificant impact on the thermal properties of the gas. In the context of star\nformation, theoretical studies have recently adopted two different strategies\nwhen considering the ortho:para ratio (OPR) of H2 molecules; the first\nconsiders the OPR to be frozen at 3:1 while the second assumes that the species\nare in thermal equilibrium. As the OPR potentially affects the protostellar\ncores which form as a result of the gravitational collapse of a dense molecular\ncloud, the aim of this paper is to quantify precisely what role the choice of\nOPR plays in the properties and evolution of the cores. We used two different\nideal gas equations of state for a hydrogen and helium mix in a radiation\nhydrodynamics code to simulate the collapse of a dense cloud and the formation\nof the first and second Larson cores; the first equation of state uses a fixed\nOPR of 3:1 while the second assumes thermal equilibrium. Simulations using an\nequilibrium ratio collapse faster at early times and show noticeable\noscillations around hydrostatic equilibrium, to the point where the core\nexpands for a short time right after its formation before resuming its\ncontraction. In the case of a fixed 3:1 OPR, the core's evolution is a lot\nsmoother. The OPR was however found to have little impact on the size, mass and\nradius of the two Larson cores. We conclude that if one is solely interested in\nthe final properties of the cores when they are formed, it does not matter\nwhich OPR is used. On the other hand, if one's focus lies primarily in the\nevolution of the first core, the choice of OPR becomes important. \n\n"}

The minimal conditions to activate\ndust-induced fragmentation require the gas to be pre-enriched above a critical\ndust-to-gas mass ratio Dcr=[2.6--6.3]x10^-9 with the spread reflecting the\ndependence on the grain properties. The recently discovered Galactic halo star\nSDSS J102915+172927 has a stellar mass of 0.8 Msun and a metallicity of\nZ=4.5x10^-5 Zsun and represents an optimal candidate for the dust-induced\nlow-mass star formation. Indeed, for the two most plausible Population III\nsupernova progenitors, with 20 Msun and 35 Msun, the critical dust-to-gas mass\nratio can be overcome provided that at least 0.4 Msun of dust condenses in the\nejecta, allowing for moderate destruction by the reverse shock. Here we show\nthat even if dust formation in the first supernovae is less efficient or strong\ndust destruction does occur, grain growth during the collapse of the parent gas\ncloud is sufficiently rapid to activate dust cooling and likely fragmentation\ninto low-mass and long-lived stars. Silicates and magnetite grains can\nexperience significant grain growth in the density range 10^9 /cc < nH<10^12\n/cc by accreting gas-phase species (SiO, SiO2, and Fe) until their gas-phase\nabundance drops to zero, reaching condensation efficiencies =1. The\ncorresponding increase in the dust-to-gas mass ratio allows dust-induced\ncooling and fragmentation to be activated at 10^12 /cc < nH < 10^14 /cc, before\nthe collapsing cloud becomes optically thick to continuum radiation.

Among these the role of the Hall effect is\nthe least explored and most poorly understood. We have included all three\nnon-ideal MHD effects in a self-consistent manner to investigate the role of\nthe Hall effect on PPD gas dynamics using local shearing-box simulations. In\nthis first paper, we focus on the inner region of PPDs, where previous studies\nexcluding the Hall effect have revealed that the inner disk up to ~10 AU is\nlargely laminar, with accretion driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind. We confirm\nthis basic picture and show that the Hall effect introduces modest\nmodifications to the wind solutions, depending on the polarity of the\nlarge-scale poloidal magnetic field B_0 threading the disk. When B_0.Omega>0,\nthe horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified toward the disk interior,\nleading to a stronger disk wind (by ~50% or less in terms of the wind-driven\naccretion rate). The enhanced horizontal field also leads to much stronger\nlarge-scale Maxwell stress (magnetic braking) that contributes to a\nconsiderable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate. When B_0.Omega<0, the\nhorizontal magnetic field is reduced, leading to a weaker disk wind (by ~20%)\nand negligible magnetic braking.

The r-mode interpretation has connections with proposed spin-evolution\nscenarios for systems such as XTE J1751-305. Here we examine in detail this\ninteresting possible interpretation. Using the ratio of the observed\noscillation frequency to the star's spin frequency, we derive an approximate\nneutron star mass-radius relation which yields reasonable values for the mass\nover the range of expected stellar radius (as constrained by observations of\nradius-expansion burst sources). However, we argue that the large mode\namplitude suggested by the Strohmayer and Mahmoodifar analysis would inevitably\nlead to a large spin-down of the star, inconsistent with its observed spin\nevolution, regardless of whether the r-mode itself is in a stable or unstable\nregime. We therefore conclude that the r-mode interpretation of the observed\noscillation is not consistent with our current understanding of neutron star\ndynamics and must be considered unlikely. Finally we note that, subject to the\navailability of a sufficiently accurate timing model, a direct\ngravitational-wave search may be able to confirm or reject an r-mode\ninterpretation unambiguously, should such an event, with a similar inferred\nmode amplitude, recur during the Advanced detector era. \n\n"}

Using an N-body code we explore how the\nnumber and sequence of transits vary as functions of observing time and orbital\nparameters. The concept is then generalised thanks to a suite of simulated\ncircumbinary systems. Binaries are constructed from RV surveys of the solar\nneighbourhood.

The binary population is shown to be compatible with\nthe Kepler eclipsing binary catalogue, indicating that the properties of\nbinaries may be as universal as the initial mass function. These synthetic\nsystems produce transiting circumbinary planets occurring on both eclipsing and\nnon-eclipsing binaries. Simulated planets transiting eclipsing binaries are\ncompared with published Kepler detections. We obtain 1) that planets transiting\nnon-eclipsing binaries probably exist in the Kepler data, 2) that observational\nbiases alone cannot account for the observed over-density of circumbinary\nplanets near the stability limit, implying a physical pile-up, and 3) that the\ndistributions of gas giants orbiting single and binary stars are likely\ndifferent.

The\nsource rapidly climbed and peaked near M~-15 mag after two additional weeks.\nDuring this bright '2014b' phase the spectrum became dominated by Balmer\nemission and a stronger blue continuum, similar to the SN impostor SN 1997bs.\nArchival images from the Hubble Space Telescope between 1997 and 2005 reveal a\nluminous (4e5 Lsun) variable precursor star. Its location on the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram is consistent with a massive (M_init~30 Msun) cool\nhypergiant having an extremely dense wind and an Eddington ratio just below\nunity. At the onset of the recent 2014a brightening, however, the object became\nsuper-Eddington. The subsequent boost in luminosity during the 2014b phase\nprobably resulted from circumstellar interaction.

Though\ncounterintuitive, this assertion follows directly from stellar tidal\ninteraction theory and the evolution of lower mass stars. There is strong\nevidence that chromospheric activity of rapidly rotating young stars may be\nhigh enough to cause mass loss from atmospheres of potentially habitable\nplanets. The removal of atmospheric water is most critical. Tidal breaking in\nbinaries could help reduce magnetic dynamo action and thereby chromospheric\nactivity in favor of life. We call this the Binary Habitability Mechanism\n(BHM), that we suggest allows for water retention at levels comparable to or\nbetter than Earth. We discuss novel advantages that life may exploit, in these\ncases, and suggest that life may even thrive on some circumbinary planets. We\nfind that while many binaries do not benefit from BHM, high quality niches do\nexist for various combinations of stars between 0.55 and 1.0 solar masses. For\na given pair of stellar masses, BHM operates only for certain combinations of\nperiod and eccentricity. Binaries having a solar-type primary seem to be quite\nwell suited niches having wide and distant habitable zones with plentiful water\nand sufficient light for photosynthetic life.

The orbit of a\nplanet around a binary stellar system poses several dynamic constraints. The\neffects that radiation from the host stars may have on the planet atmospheres\nmust be considered. Because of the configuration of a close binary system,\nthese stars have a high rotation rate, which causes a permanent state of high\nstellar activity and copious XUV radiation. The accumulated effects are\nstronger than for exoplanets around single stars, and cause a faster\nevaporation of their atmospheres. We evaluate the effects that stellar\nradiation has on the evaporation of exoplanets around binary systems and on the\nsurvival of these planets. We considered the XUV spectral range to account for\nthe photons that are easily absorbed by a planet atmosphere that is mainly\ncomposed of hydrogen. A more complex atmospheric composition is expected to\nabsorb this radiation more efficiently. We used direct X-ray observations to\nevaluate the energy in the X-rays range and coronal models to calculate the\n(nondetectable) EUV part of the spectrum. The simulations show that exoplanets\nin a close orbit will suffer strong photoevaporation that may cause a total\nloss of atmosphere in a short time. A binary system of two solar-like stars\nwill be highly efficient in evaporating the atmosphere of the planet. These\nsystems will be difficult to find, even if they are dynamically stable. Still,\nplanets may orbit around binary systems of low mass stars for wider orbits.\nCurrently known circumbinary planets are not substantially affected by thermal\nphotoevaporation processes, unless Kepler-47 b has an inflated atmosphere. The\ndistribution of the orbital periods of circumbinary planets is shifted to much\nlonger periods than the average of Kepler planets, which supports a scenario of\nstrong photoevaporation in close-in circumbinary planets. \n\n"}

We consider a hidden sector\ncontaining two stable particles charged under an unbroken $U(1)^{'}$ gauge\nsymmetry, hence featuring dissipative interactions. The massless gauge field\nassociated with this symmetry, the dark photon, can interact via kinetic mixing\nwith the ordinary photon. In fact, such an interaction of strength $\\epsilon\n\\sim 10 ^{-9}$ appears to be necessary in order to explain galactic structure.\nWe calculate the effect of this new physics on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and its\ncontribution to the relativistic energy density at Hydrogen recombination. We\nthen examine the process of dark recombination, during which neutral dark\nstates are formed, which is important for large-scale structure formation.\nGalactic structure is considered next, focussing on spiral and irregular\ngalaxies. For these galaxies we modelled the dark matter halo (at the current\nepoch) as a dissipative plasma of dark matter particles, where the energy lost\ndue to dissipation is compensated by the energy produced from ordinary\nsupernovae (the core-collapse energy is transferred to the hidden sector via\nkinetic mixing induced processes in the supernova core). We find that such a\ndynamical halo model can reproduce several observed features of disk galaxies,\nincluding the cored density profile and the Tully-Fisher relation. We also\ndiscuss how elliptical and dwarf spheroidal galaxies could fit into this\npicture.

Abstract: Measurements of the cosmic ray antiproton spectrum can be used to search for\ncontributions from annihilating dark matter and to constrain the dark matter\nannihilation cross section. Depending on the assumptions made regarding cosmic\nray propagation in the Galaxy, such constraints can be quite stringent. We\nrevisit this topic, utilizing a set of propagation models fit to the cosmic ray\nboron, carbon, oxygen and beryllium data. We derive upper limits on the dark\nmatter annihilation cross section and find that when the cosmic ray propagation\nparameters are treated as nuisance parameters (as we argue is appropriate), the\nresulting limits are significantly less stringent than have been previously\nreported. We also note (as have several previous groups) that simple\nGALPROP-like diffusion-reacceleration models predict a spectrum of cosmic ray\nantiprotons that is in good agreement with PAMELA's observations above ~5 GeV,\nbut that significantly underpredict the flux at lower energies. Although the\ncomplexity of modeling cosmic ray propagation at GeV-scale energies makes it\ndifficult to determine the origin of this discrepancy, we consider the\npossibility that the excess antiprotons are the result of annihilating dark\nmatter. Suggestively, we find that this excess is best fit for a dark matter\nmass of approximately 35 GeV and annihilation cross section of approximately\n1e-26 cm^3/s (to b-bbar), in good agreement with the mass and cross section\npreviously shown to be required to generate the gamma-ray excess observed from\nthe Galactic Center. \n\n"}

Theoretical models, based primarily on semi-analytical techniques,\nhave had a long-standing problem with reproducing these trends, instead\npredicting too few blue satellites in general but also estimating a radial\ndistribution that is too shallow, regardless of primary mass.

Because of their relatively large gas reservoirs, satellites can\ncontinue to form stars long after infall, with a typical timescale for\nstar-formation to be quenched ~2 Gyr in groups but more than ~5 Gyr for\nsatellites around Milky Way like primaries.

By incorporating the geometry\nand the three-body dynamics of circumbinary systems, we analytically derive the\nprobability of transitability, a configuration where the binary and planet\norbits overlap on the sky. We later show that this is equivalent to the transit\nprobability, but at an unspecified point in time. This probability, at its\nminimum, is always higher than for single star cases. In addition, it is an\nincreasing function with mutual inclination. By applying our analytical\ndevelopment to eclipsing binaries, we deduce that transits are highly probable,\nand in some case guaranteed. For example, a circumbinary planet revolving at 1\nAU around a 0.3 AU eclipsing binary is certain to eventually transit - a 100%\nprobability - if its mutual inclination is greater than 0.6 deg. We show that\nthe transit probability is generally only a weak function of the planet's\norbital period; circumbinary planets may be used as practical tools for probing\nthe outer regions of exoplanetary systems to search for and detect warm to cold\ntransiting planets. \n\n"}

Yet the connection between\nhost star metallicity and the properties of small planets is only just\nbeginning to be investigated. It has recently been argued that the metallicity\ndistribution of stars with exoplanet candidates identified by Kepler provides\nevidence for three distinct clusters of exoplanets, distinguished by planet\nradius boundaries at 1.7 R_Earth and 3.9 R_Earth. This would suggest that there\nare three distinct planet formation pathways for super-Earths, mini-Neptunes,\nand giant planets. However, as I show through three independent analyses, there\nis actually no evidence for the proposed radius boundary at 1.7 R_Earth. On the\nother hand, a more rigorous calculation demonstrates that a single, continuous\nrelationship between planet radius and metallicity is a better fit to the data.\nThe planet radius and metallicity data therefore provides no evidence for\ndistinct categories of small planets. This suggests that the planet formation\nprocess in a typical protoplanetary disk produces a continuum of planet sizes\nbetween 1 R_Earth and 4 R_Earth. As a result, the currently available planet\nradius and metallicity data for solar-metallicity F and G stars give no reason\nto expect that the amount of solid material in a protoplanetary disk determines\nwhether super-Earths or mini-Neptunes are formed. \n\n"}

Of the\nobserved high quality and extended rotation curves of these galaxies\ndecompositions have been made, for four different schemes, each with two free\nparameters. For a \"maximum disc fit\" the rotation curves can be well matched,\nyet a large range of mass-to-light ratios for the individual galaxies is\nrequired. For the alternative gravitational theory of MOND the rotation curves\ncan be explained if the fundamental parameter associated with MOND is allowed\nas a free parameter. Fixing that parameter leads to a disagreement between the\npredicted and observed rotation curves for a few galaxies. When cosmologically\nmotivated NFW dark matter halos are assumed, the rotation curves for the least\nmassive galaxies can, by no means, be reproduced; cores are definitively\npreferred over cusps. Finally, decompositions have been made for a pseudo\nisothermal halo combined with a universal M/L ratio.

We collect these easily evaluated\nconstraints into a workflow that can help guide the design and interpretation\nof new observational campaigns and numerical simulations of gap opening in such\nsystems. We argue that the locations of resonances should be significantly\nshifted in massive disks like HL Tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in the\nexact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty in\nthe dynamical state and stability in such disks. This presents an important\nbarrier to using systems like HL Tau as a proxy for the initial conditions\nfollowing planet formation. An important observational avenue to breaking this\ndegeneracy is to search for eccentric gaps, which could implicate resonantly\ninteracting planets. Unfortunately, massive disks like HL Tau should induce\nswift pericenter precession that would smear out any such eccentric features of\nplanetary origin. This motivates pushing toward more typical, less massive\ndisks.

One of\nthe fundamental parameters of the spiral structure is its angular velocity, or\npattern speed $\\Omega_p$, which determines the location of resonances in the\ndisc and the spirals' radial extent. The most direct method for estimating the\npattern speed relies on backward integration techniques, trying to locate the\nstellar birthplace of open clusters.

Using a sample\nof around 500 open clusters from the {\\it New Catalogue of Optically Visible\nOpen Clusters and Candidates}, and a sample of 500 giant stars observed by\nAPOGEE, we find $\\Omega_p = 23.0\\pm0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, for a local\nstandard of rest rotation $V_0=220$~km s$^{-1}$ and solar radius $R_0=8.0$~kpc.\nExploring a range in $V_0$ and $R_0$ within the acceptable values, 200-240 km\ns$^{-1}$ and 7.5-8.5 kpc, respectively, results only in a small change in our\nestimate of $\\Omega_p$, that is within the error.

An advantage of our method is that we do not need\nknowledge of the stellar age, unlike in the case of the birthplace method,\nwhich allows us to use data from large Galactic surveys. The precision of our\nmethod will be improved once larger samples of disk stars with spectroscopic\ninformation will become available thanks to future surveys such as 4MOST. \n\n"}

The early brightening can be observed when the observer is in the\ndirection of the hole created by the collision. Based on a population synthesis\nmodel, we estimate the fractions of core-collapse supernovae in which the\nlight-curve brightening by the collision can be observed. We find that 0.19% of\ncore-collapse supernova light curves can be observed with the collisional\nbrightening. Type Ibc supernova light curves are more likely to be brightened\nby the collision (0.53%) because of the high fraction of the progenitors being\nin binary systems and their proximity to the companion stars. Type II and IIb\nsupernova light curves are less affected (~1e-3% and ~1e-2%, respectively).\nAlthough the early, slow light-curve declines of some Type IIb and Ibc\nsupernovae are argued to be caused by the collision with the companion star\n(e.g. SN 2008D), the small expected fraction, as well as the unrealistically\nsmall separation required, disfavour the argument.

Within this\nscheme, the angular parameter which defines quasi-elliptical isophotes is\ntransformed from the commonly used, but inappropriate, polar co-ordinate to the\n`eccentric anomaly'. This provides a superior description of deviations from\nellipticity, better capturing the true isophotal shape. Furthermore, this makes\nit possible to accurately recover both the surface brightness profile, using\nthe correct azimuthally-averaged isophote, and the two-dimensional model of any\ngalaxy: the hitherto ubiquitous, but artificial, cross-like features in\nresidual images are completely removed. The formalism has been implemented into\nthe IRAF tasks $Ellipse$ and $Bmodel$ to create the new tasks `$Isofit$', and\n`$Cmodel$'. The new tools are demonstrated here with application to five\ngalaxies, chosen to be representative case-studies for several areas where this\ntechnique makes it possible to gain new scientific insight. Specifically:\nproperly quantifying boxy/disky isophotes via the fourth harmonic order in\nedge-on galaxies, quantifying X-shaped/peanut bulges, higher-order Fourier\nmoments for modelling bars in disks, and complex isophote shapes. Higher order\n(n > 4) harmonics now become meaningful and may correlate with structural\nproperties, as boxyness/diskyness is known to do. This work also illustrates\nhow the accurate construction, and subtraction, of a model from a galaxy image\nfacilitates the identification and recovery of over-lapping sources such as\nglobular clusters and the optical counterparts of X-ray sources. \n\n"}

A\nvarying pseudoscalar density may also lead to instability of some fermion and\nboson modes and modify some properties of the Fermi sea.

The\nfraction of planetary systems that remains intact as a cluster member, fbps, is\ngenerally well-described by the functional form fbps=f0(1+[a/a0]^c)^-1, where\n(1-f0) is the fraction of stars that escapes from the cluster, a0 the critical\nsemi-major axis for survival, and c a measure for the width of the transition\nregion.

By modelling the formation of the peculiar features\nobserved in the NGC 4013 halo, we investigate their origin. By using GADGET -2\nwith implemented gas cooling, star formation, and feedback, we have modelled\nthe overall NGC 4013 galaxy and its associated halo features. A gas-rich major\nmerger occurring 2.7-4.6 Gyr ago succeeds in reproducing the NGC 4013 galaxy\nproperties, including all the faint stellar features, strong gas warp,\nboxy-shaped halo and vertical 3.6 mum luminosity distribution. High gas\nfractions in the progenitors are sufficient to reproduce the observed thin and\nthick discs, with a small bulge fraction, as observed. A major merger is able\nto reproduce the overall NGC 4013 system, including the warp strength, the red\ncolour and the high stellar mass density of the loop, while a minor merger\nmodel cannot. Because the gas-rich model suffices to create a pseudo-bulge with\na small fraction of the light, NGC 4013 is perhaps the archetype of a late-type\ngalaxy formed by a relatively recent merger.

The DoAr 44 disk consists of an optically thick\ninner ring and outer disk, separated by a dust-cleared 36 AU gap, and has\ntherefore been termed \"pre-transitional\". To date, this is the only disk with a\nlarge inner gap known to harbor detectable quantities of warm (T=450 K) water\nvapor. In this work, we detect and spectrally resolve three mid-infrared pure\nrotational emission lines of water vapor from this source, and use the shapes\nof the emission lines to constrain the location of the water vapor. We find\nthat the emission originates near 0.3 AU --- the inner disk region.

However nonhelical magnetic energy in a decaying MHD system also\nmigrates toward the large scale, which holds vital clues to the origin of large\nscale magnetic field in a quiescent astrophysical system. Zeldovich's rope\ndynamo model is considered as a basic and symbolistic model of magnetic field\namplification.

So we suggest a new dynamo model based on magnetic\ninduction equation excluding a forcing source. This model shows the expansion\nand growth of magnetic field (flux) is basically the redistribution of energy\nin the system.

We present here a new code, DAMOCLES, that models the effects of dust\non the line profiles of core-collapse supernovae in order to determine the\nmasses of newly formed dust. As noted by Lucy et al.

The overall higher planet occurrence\nrates around M stars are not consistent with the redistribution of the same\nmass into more, smaller planets.

In\nthis late stage, a significant amount of ice could have been delivered to 1 AU\nfrom outer regions in the form of mm to dm-sized pebbles. This raises the\nquestion why the present Earth is so depleted of water (with the ocean mass\nbeing as small as 0.023% of the Earth mass). Here we quantify the amount of icy\npebbles accreted by terrestrial embryos after the migration of the snow line\nassuming that no mechanism halts the pebble flow in outer disk regions. We use\na simplified version of the coagulation equation to calculate the formation and\nradial inward drift of icy pebbles in a protoplanetary disk. The pebble\naccretion cross section of an embryo is calculated using analytic expressions\npresented by recent studies. We find that the final mass and water content of\nterrestrial embryos strongly depends on the radial extent of the gas disk, the\nstrength of disk turbulence, and the time at which the snow lines arrives at 1\nAU. The disk's radial extent sets the lifetime of the pebble flow, while\nturbulence determines the density of pebbles at the midplane where the embryos\nreside. We find that the final water content of the embryos falls below 0.023\nwt% only if the disk is compact (< 100 AU), turbulence is strong at 1 AU, and\nthe snow line arrives at 1 AU later than 2-4 Myr after disk formation. If the\nsolar nebula extended to 300 AU, initially rocky embryos would have evolved\ninto icy planets of 1-10 Earth masses unless the snow-line migration was slow.\nIf the proto-Earth contained water of ~ 1 wt% as might be suggested by the\ndensity deficit of the Earth's outer core, the formation of the proto-Earth was\npossible with weaker turbulence and with earlier (> 0.5-2 Myr) snow-line\nmigration. \n\n"}

In\nthese systems, some of the open field lines do not allow the flow to pass\nsmoothly through the sonic point, so that steady-state solutions do not exist\nin general. This paper focuses on this type of magnetic field configuration,\nwhere the resulting flow becomes manifestly time-dependent. We consider the\ncase of both steady heating and time-variable heating, and find the time scales\nfor the corresponding time variations of the outflow. Because the flow cannot\npass through the sonic transition, it remains subsonic and leads to so-called\nbreeze solutions. One manifestation of the time variability is that the flow\nsamples a collection of different breeze solutions over time, and the mass\noutflow rate varies in quasi-periodic fashion. Because the flow is subsonic,\ninformation can propagate inward from the outer boundary, which determines, in\npart, the time scale of the flow variability. This work finds the relationship\nbetween the outer boundary scale and the time scale of flow variations. In\npractice, the location of the outer boundary is set by the extent of the sphere\nof influence of the planet.

We make use of the\nsample of the 100 brightest galaxy clusters discovered in the XXL Survey to\ninvestigate the fraction of baryons in the form of hot gas and stars in the\ncluster population. We measure the gas masses of the detected halos and use a\nmass--temperature relation directly calibrated using weak-lensing measurements\nfor a subset of XXL clusters to estimate the halo mass. We find that the\nweak-lensing calibrated gas fraction of XXL-100-GC clusters is substantially\nlower than was found in previous studies using hydrostatic masses.

This model is, however, in\ncontrast with the thermodynamical properties of observed halos, which might\nsuggest that weak-lensing masses are overestimated. We note that a mass bias\n$1-b=0.58$ as required to reconcile Planck CMB and cluster counts should\ntranslate into an even lower baryon fraction, which poses a major challenge to\nour current understanding of galaxy clusters.

For slowly rotating stars the\ncentre-to-limb convective variation dominated the residuals (with amplitudes of\n10s of cm/s to ~1 m/s); however, for faster rotating stars the dominant\nresidual signature was due a non-Gaussian intrinsic profile (with amplitudes\nfrom 0.5-9 m/s). When the impact factor was 0, neglecting to account for the\nconvective centre-to-limb variation led to an uncertainty in the obliquity of\n~10-20 degrees, even though the true v sin i was known. Additionally,\nneglecting to properly model an asymmetric intrinsic profile had a greater\nimpact for more rapidly rotating stars (e.g. v sin i = 6 km/s), and caused\nsystematic errors on the order of ~20 degrees in the measured obliquities.\nHence, neglecting the impact of stellar surface convection may bias star-planet\nalignment measurements and consequently also theories on planetary migration\nand evolution. \n\n"}

A growing body of research\nsuggests that small particles (\"pebbles\") continually drift inward through the\ndisk. If a fraction of drifting pebbles is trapped at the inner edge of the\ndisk a several Earth-mass core can quickly grow. Subsequently, the core may\nmigrate outward beyond the snow line via planet-disk interactions. Of course,\nto reach the outer Solar System Jupiter's core must traverse the terrestrial\nplanet-forming region.\n  We use N-body simulations including synthetic forces from an underlying\ngaseous disk to study how the outward migration of Jupiter's core sculpts the\nterrestrial zone. If the outward migration is fast (Tmig~10^4 years), the core\nsimply migrates past resident planetesimals and planetary embryos. However, if\nits migration is slower (Tmig~10^5 years) the core removes solids from the\ninner disk by shepherding objects in mean motion resonances. In many cases the\ndisk interior to 0.5-1 AU is cleared of embryos and most planetesimals.

We confirm prior results that\nyoung low-mass stars can be used to test star-disk coupling and angular\nmomentum loss independent of the treatment of internal angular momentum\ntransport. For slow rotators, we confirm the need for star-disk interactions to\nevolve the ONC to older systems, using h Per (age 13~Myr) as our natural\npost-disk case. Further interactions are not required to evolve slow rotators\nfrom h Per to older systems, implying no justification for extremely long-lived\ndisks as an alternative to core-envelope decoupling.

This\nprovided a very complete inventory of neutral and ionic C-, N- and S- bearing\nspecies with, up to our knowledge, the first secure detections of the\ndeuterated ions DCS+ and DOCO+. We used a state-of-the-art\npseudo-time-dependent gas-phase chemical model to determine the value of the\ncosmic ray ionization rate and the depletion factors. The observational data\nwere well fitted with $\\zeta_{H_2}$ between 3E-17 s$^{-1}$ and 1E-16 s$^{-1}$.\nElemental depletions were estimated to be ~10 for C and O, ~1 for N and ~25 for\nS. Barnard B1b presents similar depletions of C and O than those measured in\npre-stellar cores. The depletion of sulfur is higher than that of C and O but\nnot as extreme as in cold cores. In fact, it is similar to the values found in\nsome bipolar outflows, hot cores and photon-dominated regions. Several\nscenarios are discussed to account for these peculiar abundances. We propose\nthat it is the consequence of the initial conditions (important outflows and\nenhanced UV fields in the surroundings) and a rapid collapse (~0.1 Myr) that\npermits to maintain most S- and N-bearing species in gas phase to great optical\ndepths. The interaction of the compact outflow associated with B1b-S with the\nsurrounding material could enhance the abundances of S-bearing molecules, as\nwell. \n\n"}

Despite the\ncomplexity of the processes involved, a traditional model, where the removal of\nangular momentum loss by magnetic fields is prescribed, has provided a useful\nframework to understand observational relations between stellar rotation and\nage and magnetic field strength. Here, a spindown model is proposed where loss\nof angular momentum by magnetic fields is evolved dynamically, instead of being\nkinematically prescribed. To this end, we evolve the stellar rotation and\nmagnetic field simultaneously over stellar evolution time by extending our\nprevious work on a dynamo model which incorporates the nonlinear feedback\nmechanisms on rotation and magnetic fields. Our extended model reproduces key\nobservations and explains the presence of the two branches of (fast and slow\nrotating) stars which have different relations between rotation rate $\\Omega$\nvs. time (age), magnetic field strength $|B|$ vs. rotation rate, and frequency\nof magnetic field $\\omega_{cyc}$ vs. rotation rate. For fast rotating stars we\nfind: (i) an exponential spindown $\\Omega \\propto e^{-1.35t}$, with $t$\nmeasured in Gyrs, (ii) $|B|$ saturates for higher rotation rate, (iii)\n$\\omega_{cyc} \\propto \\Omega^{0.85}$.

The\nresults obtained are in good agreement with observations. The Vaughan-Preston\ngap is consistently explained in our model by the shortest spindown timescale\nin this transition from fast to slow rotators.

The stacked methanol emission, as observed\nwith ALMA, is spectrally resolved and detected across six velocity channels\n($>3 \\sigma$), reaching a peak signal-to-noise of $5.5\\sigma$, with the\nkinematic pattern expected for TW~Hya. Using an appropriate disk model, a\nfractional abundance of $3\\times 10^{-12} - 4 \\times 10^{-11}$ (with respect to\nH$_2$) reproduces the stacked line profile and channel maps, with the favoured\nabundance dependent upon the assumed vertical location (midplane versus\nmolecular layer). The peak emission is offset from the source position\nsuggesting that the methanol emission has a ring-like morphology: the analysis\nhere suggests it peaks at $\\approx 30$~AU reaching a column density $\\approx\n3-6\\times10^{12}$~cm$^{-2}$.

Because MUSIC has been designed to use realistic stellar models\nproduced from one-dimensional stellar evolution calculations, MUSIC simulations\nare capable of seamlessly modeling a whole star. Simulations in two-dimensional\nspherical shells that have different radial extents are performed over hundreds\nof convective turnover times, permitting the collection of well-converged\nstatistics.\n  Results: We evaluate basic statistics of the convective turnover time, the\nconvective velocity, and the overshooting layer.

The inclusion in the spherical\nshell of the boundary between the radiative and convection zones decreases the\namplitude of convective velocities in the convection zone. The inclusion of\nnear-surface layers in the spherical shell can increase the amplitude of\nconvective velocities, although the radial structure of the velocity profile\nestablished by deep convection is unchanged. The impact from including the\nnear-surface layers depends on the speed and structure of small-scale\nconvection in the near-surface layers. Larger convective velocities in the\nconvection zone result in a commensurate increase in the overshooting layer\nwidth and decrease in the convective turnover time.

As the\nSun transitions from a main sequence star into a white dwarf, Jupiter, Saturn,\nUranus and Neptune are currently assumed to survive in expanded but otherwise\nunchanged orbits. However, a sufficiently-distant and sufficiently-massive\nextra planet would alter this quiescent end scenario through the combined\neffects of Solar giant branch mass loss and Galactic tides.

I\nfind that this boundary is diffuse and strongly dependent on each of the\ndistant planet's orbital parameters. Nevertheless, I claim that instability\noccurs more often than not when the planet is as massive as Jupiter and\nharbours a semimajor axis exceeding about 300 au, or has a mass of a\nsuper-Earth and a semimajor axis exceeding about 3000 au.

We\ninvestigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified\nprescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on\nthe disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create\nsignatures similar to those observed in transition disks. For the dust\nevolution, we included the transport, growth, and fragmentation of dust\nparticles. To compare with observations, we produced synthetic images in\nscattered optical light and in thermal emission at mm wavelengths. In all\nmodels with a dead zone, a bump in the gas surface density is produced that is\nable to efficiently trap large particles ($\\gtrsim 1$ mm) at the outer edge of\nthe dead zone. The gas bump reaches an amplitude of a factor of $\\sim5$, which\ncan be enhanced by the presence of an MHD wind that removes mass from the inner\ndisk.

In the synthetic images,\ngap-like low-emission regions are seen at scattered light and in thermal\nemission at mm wavelengths, as previously predicted in the case of planet-disk\ninteraction. As a conclusion, main signatures of transition disks can be\nreproduced by assuming a dead zone in the disk, such as gap-like structure in\nscattered light and millimetre continuum emission, and a lower gas surface\ndensity within the dead zone.

We incorporate a simple\nmolecular chemistry network and classical nucleation theory with a model for\nthe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas, in order to demonstrate the\nformation of both carbon and forsterite ($\\rm Mg_2SiO_4$) grains. The high\ndensities due to radiative shock compression ($n \\sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$)\nresult in CO saturation and rapid dust nucleation. Grains grow efficiently to\nlarge sizes $\\gtrsim 0.1\\mu$m, in agreement with IR observations of\ndust-producing novae, and with total dust masses sufficient to explain massive\nextinction events such as V705 Cas. As in dense stellar winds, dust formation\nis CO-regulated, with carbon-rich flows producing carbon-rich grains and\noxygen-rich flows primarily forming silicates. CO is destroyed by non-thermal\nparticles accelerated at the shock, allowing additional grain formation at late\ntimes, but the efficiency of this process appears to be low. Given observations\nshowing that individual novae produce both carbonaceous and silicate grains, we\nconcur with previous works attributing this bimodality to chemical\nheterogeneity of the ejecta.

When evolved in isolation,\ngalaxies develop a type~II (down-bending) profile. In the cluster, the\nevolution of the profile depends on the minimum cluster-centric radius the\ngalaxy reaches, which controls the degree of ram pressure stripping. If the\ngalaxy falls to $\\sim 50\\%$ of the virial radius, then the profile remains\ntype~II, but if the galaxy reaches down to $\\sim 20\\%$ of the virial radius the\nbreak weakens and the profile becomes more type~I like. The velocity\ndispersions are only slightly increased in the cluster simulations compared\nwith the isolated galaxy; random motion therefore cannot be responsible for\nredistributing material sufficiently to cause the change in the profile type.\nInstead we find that the joint action of radial migration driven by\ntidally-induced spirals and the outside-in quenching of star formation due to\nram pressure stripping alters the density profile. As a result, this model\npredicts a flattening of the age profiles amongst cluster lenticulars with\ntype~I profiles, which can be observationally tested. % \n\n"}

The fundamental quantity\nto be computed is the cross-covariance of the seismic wavefield.

We illustrate\nthe method by considering the 3D acoustic wave equation in an axisymmetric\nreference solar model, ignoring the effects of gravity on the waves. The\nsymmetry of the background model around the rotation axis implies that the\nGreen's function can be written as a sum of longitudinal Fourier modes, leading\nto a set of independent 2D problems. We use a high-order finite-element method\nto solve the 2D wave equation in frequency space.

High-precision HST observations of several\nsuper-Earths with equilibrium temperatures below 1000K have to date all\nresulted in featureless transmission spectra, which have been suggested to be\ndue to high-altitude clouds.

We present\nobservations of nine transits of the planet obtained simultaneously in the griz\nand JHK passbands. We find an average radius of 1.43 +/- 0.16 Rearth for the\nplanet, averaged over all the passbands, and a radius of 0.255 +/- 0.023 Rsun\nfor the star, both of which are significantly greater than previously found.\nThe planet radius can be decomposed into a \"surface radius\" at ~1.375 Rearth\noverlaid by atmospheric features which increase the observed radius in the z\nand K bands. The z-band radius is 4sigma higher than the continuum, suggesting\na strong detection of an atmosphere. We deploy a suite of tests to verify the\nreliability of the transmission spectrum, which are greatly helped by the\nexistence of repeat observations.

Referring to this, we discuss the neutral hydrogen gas around the\nPerseus cloud in the present paper.

This calibrated tau353-NH relationship shows that the amount\nof the HI gas can be underestimated to be ~60% if the optically-thin HI method\nis used. Based on this relationship, we calculated optical depth of the 21 cm\nline (tauHI), and found that <tauHI> ~ 0.92 around the molecular cloud.

Which mechanisms are responsible for the disc\ndissipation is still debated. Here we investigate the movement through an\nambient medium as a possible cause of disc dispersal. The ram pressure exerted\nby the flow can truncate the disc and the accretion of material with no\nazimuthal angular momentum leads to further disc contraction. We derive a\ntheoretical model from accretion disc theory that describes the evolution of\nthe disc radius, mass, and surface density profile as a function of the density\nand velocity of the ambient medium. We test our model by performing\nhydrodynamical simulations of a protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow with\ndifferent velocities and densities. We find that our model gives an adequate\ndescription of the evolution of the disc radius and accretion rate onto the\ndisc. The total disc mass in the simulations follows the theoretically expected\ntrend, except at the lowest density where our simulated discs lose mass owing\nto continuous stripping. This stripping may be a numerical rather than a\nphysical effect. Some quantitative differences exist between the model\npredictions and the simulations. These are at least partly caused by numerical\nviscous effects in the disc and depend on the resolution of the simulation. Our\nmodel can be used as a conservative estimate for the process of face-on\naccretion onto protoplanetary discs, as long as viscous processes in the disc\ncan be neglected. The model predicts that in dense gaseous environments, discs\ncan shrink substantially in size and can, in theory, sweep up an amount of gas\nof the order of their initial mass. This process could be relevant for planet\nformation in dense environments. \n\n"}

Abstract: Elemental abundances of stars are the result of the complex enrichment\nhistory of their galaxy. Interpretation of observed abundances requires\nflexible modeling tools to explore and quantify the information about Galactic\nchemical evolution (GCE) stored in such data. Here we present Chempy, a newly\ndeveloped code for GCE modeling, representing a parametrized open one-zone\nmodel within a Bayesian framework. A Chempy model is specified by a set of 5-10\nparameters that describe the effective galaxy evolution along with the stellar\nand star-formation physics: e.g. the star-formation history, the feedback\nefficiency, the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the incidence of\nsupernova type Ia (SN Ia). Unlike established approaches, Chempy can sample the\nposterior probability distribution in the full model parameter space and test\ndata-model matches for different nucleosynthetic yield sets. We extend Chempy\nto a multi-zone scheme. As an illustrative application, we show that\ninteresting parameter constraints result from only the ages and elemental\nabundances of Sun, Arcturus and the present-day interstellar medium (ISM). For\nthe first time, we use such information to infer IMF parameter via GCE\nmodeling, where we properly marginalize over nuisance parameters and account\nfor different yield sets. We find that of the IMF $11.6_{-1.6}^{+2.1}$ %\nexplodes as core-collapse SN, compatible with Salpeter 1955. We also constrain\nthe incidence of SN Ia per 10^3 Msun to 0.5-1.4.

In this work, the feedback\nof realistic dust particle distributions onto the gas chemistry and molecular\nemissivity is investigated, with a particular focus on CO isotopologues. The\nradial dust grain size distribution is determined using dust evolution models\nthat include growth, fragmentation and radial drift. A new version of the code\nDALI is used to take into account how dust surface area and density influence\nthe disk thermal structure, molecular abundances and excitation. The difference\nof dust and gas radial sizes is largely due to differences in the optical depth\nof CO lines and millimeter continuum, without the need to invoke radial drift.\nThe effect of radial drift is primarily visible in the sharp outer edge of the\ncontinuum intensity profile. The gas outer radius probed by $^{12}$CO emission\ncan easily differ by a factor of $\\sim 2$ between the models for a turbulent\n$\\alpha$ ranging between typical values.

As a result, the gas can be much colder than the dust at\nintermediate heights, reducing the CO excitation and emission, especially for\nlow turbulence values.

Hydrogen deuteride (HD) is a promising\nalternative to the commonly-used gas mass tracer, CO. We aim to examine the\nrobustness of HD as tracer of the disk gas mass, specifically the effect of gas\nmass on the HD FIR emission and its sensitivity to the vertical structure.\nDeuterium chemistry reactions relevant for HD were implemented in the\nthermochemical code DALI and models were run for a range of disk masses and\nvertical structures. The HD J=1-0 line intensity depends directly on the gas\nmass through a sublinear power law relation with a slope of ~0.8. Assuming no\nprior knowledge about the vertical structure of a disk and using only the HD\n1-0 flux, gas masses can be estimated to within a factor of 2 for low mass\ndisks (M$_{\\rm disk} < 10^{-3}$ M$_\\odot$). For more massive disks, this\nuncertainty increases to more than an order of magnitude. Adding the HD 2-1\nline or independent information about the vertical structure can reduce this\nuncertainty to a factor of ~3 for all disk masses. For TW Hya, using the radial\nand vertical structure from Kama et al. 2016b the observations constrain the\ngas mass to $6\\cdot10^{-3}$ M$_\\odot$ < M$_{\\rm disk} < 9\\cdot10^{-3}$\nM$_\\odot$.

We investigate here\nwhether the impact of the stellar metallicity on the evolution of the tidal\ndissipation inside the convective envelope of rotating stars and its resulting\neffect on the planetary migration might be a possible explanation for this\nobserved statistical trend.\n  We use a frequency-averaged tidal dissipation formalism coupled to an orbital\nevolution code and to rotating stellar evolution models to estimate the effect\nof a change of stellar metallicity on the evolution of close-in planets. We\nconsider here two different stellar masses: 0.4 and 1.0 $M_{\\odot}$ evolving\nfrom the early pre-main sequence phase up to the red giant branch.\n  We show that the metallicity of a star has a strong effect on the stellar\nparameters which in turn strongly influence the tidal dissipation in the\nconvective region.

In this\nscenario, stars with no/little abundance variations first form from a massive\nmolecular cloud (MC). After all of the remaining gas of the MC is expelled by\nnumerous supernovae, gas ejected from asymptotic giant branch stars can be\naccumulated in the central region of the GC to form a high-density\nintra-cluster medium (ICM). Merging of neutron stars then occurs to eject\nr-process elements, which can be efficiently trapped in and subsequently mixed\nwith the ICM. New stars formed from the ICM can have r-process abundances quite\ndifferent from those of earlier generations of stars within the GC. This\nscenario can explain both (i) why r-process elements can be trapped within GCs\nand (ii) why GCs with internal abundance spreads in r-process elements do not\nshow [Fe/H] spreads. Our model shows that (i) a large fraction of Eu-rich stars\ncan be seen in Na-enhanced stellar populations of GCs, as observed in M15, and\n(ii) why most of the Galactic GCs do not exhibit such internal abundance\nspreads.

The\nbest-fit model provides an inclination angle i between the rotation axis and\nthe line-of-sight direction of 30 deg, and is able to simultaneously reproduce\nthe full three-dimensional kinematics and structure of the cluster, while\npreserving a good agreement with the projected morphology. Literature models\nbased solely on line-of-sight measurements imply a significantly different\ninclination angle (i=45 deg), demonstrating that proper motions play a key role\nin constraining the intrinsic structure of 47 Tuc. Our best-fit global\ndynamical model implies an internal rotation higher than previous studies have\nshown, and suggests a peak of the intrinsic V/sigma ratio of ~0.9 at around two\nhalf-light radii, with a non-monotonic intrinsic ellipticity profile reaching\nvalues up to 0.45. Our study unveils a new degree of dynamical complexity in 47\nTuc, which may be leveraged to provide new insights into the formation and\nevolution of globular clusters. \n\n"}

One component of this gas, HI high velocity\nclouds (HVCs), have attracted attention since their discovery in the 1960s and\nremain controversial in terms of their origins, largely due to the lack of\nreliable distance estimates. The recent discovery of enhanced magnetic fields\ntowards HVCs has encouraged us to explore their connection to cloud evolution,\nkinematics, and survival as they fall through the magnetized Galactic halo. For\na reasonable model for the halo magnetic field, most infalling clouds see\ntransverse rather than radial field lines. We find that significant compression\n(and thereby amplification) of the ambient magnetic field occurs in front of\nthe cloud and in the tail of material stripped from the cloud. The compressed\ntransverse field attenuates hydrodynamical instabilities. This delays cloud\ndestruction, though not indefinitely. The observed B-field compression is\nrelated to the cloud's distance from the Galactic plane.

These can\ndrive large dust-to-gas ratio fluctuations even at arbitrarily small\ndust-to-gas mass ratios. Here, we identify and study both resonant and new\nnon-resonant instabilities, in the simple case where the gas satisfies neutral\nhydrodynamics and supports acoustic waves ($\\omega^{2}=c_{s}^{2}\\,k^{2}$). The\ngas and dust are coupled via an arbitrary drag law and subject to external\naccelerations (e.g. gravity, radiation pressure). If there is any dust drift\nvelocity, the system is unstable. The instabilities exist for {\\em all}\ndust-to-gas ratios $\\mu$ and their growth rates depend only weakly on $\\mu$\naround resonance, as $\\sim\\mu^{1/3}$ or $\\sim \\mu^{1/2}$ (depending on\nwavenumber). The behavior changes depending on whether the drift velocity is\nlarger or smaller than the sound speed $c_{s}$. In the supersonic regime a\n'resonant' instability appears with growth rate increasing without limit with\nwavenumber, even for vanishingly small $\\mu$ and values of the coupling\nstrength ('stopping time'). In the subsonic regime non-resonant instabilities\nalways exist, but their growth rates no longer increase indefinitely towards\nsmall wavelengths. The dimensional scalings and qualitative behavior of the\ninstability do not depend sensitively on the drag law or equation-of-state of\nthe gas. The instabilities directly drive exponentially growing\ndust-to-gas-ratio fluctuations, which can be large even when the modes are\notherwise weak. We discuss physical implications for cool-star winds,\nAGN-driven winds and torii, and starburst winds: the instabilities alter the\ncharacter of these outflows and could drive clumping and/or turbulence in the\ndust and gas. \n\n"}

Abstract: An impact model of gravity designed to emulate Newton's law of gravitation is\napplied to the radial acceleration of disk galaxies. Based on this model\n(Wilhelm et al. 2013), the rotation velocity curves can be understood without\nthe need to postulate any dark matter contribution. The increased acceleration\nin the plane of the disk is a consequence of multiple interactions of gravitons\n(called \"quadrupoles\" in the original paper) and the subsequent propagation in\nthis plane and not in three-dimensional space. The concept provides a physical\nprocess that relates the fit parameter of the acceleration scale defined by\nMcGaugh et al.

For two double-line spectroscopic binaries with no\nprevious orbits, the individual component masses, using combined astrometric\nand radial velocity data, have a formal uncertainty of ~0.1 MSun.

These objects are part of a survey to characterize the binary\npopulation of stars in the Southern Hemisphere, using the SOAR 4m\ntelescope+HRCAM at CTIO. Orbital elements are computed using a newly developed\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that delivers maximum likelihood estimates\nof the parameters, as well as posterior probability density functions that\nallow us to evaluate the uncertainty of our derived parameters in a robust way.\nFor spectroscopic binaries, using our approach, it is possible to derive a\nself-consistent parallax for the system from the combined astrometric plus\nradial velocity data (\"orbital parallax\"), which compares well with the\ntrigonometric parallaxes.

Modern\ncosmological simulations can now obtain relatively realistic populations of\ndisc galaxies, but it still remains to be clarified how discs manage to survive\nmassive mergers. Here we use a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical\nsimulations set in a LambdaCDM cosmology to elucidate the fate of discs\nencountering massive mergers.

We also examine the relations between\ntheir present-day morphology, assembly history and gas fractions. We find that\napproximately half of present-day disc galaxies underwent at least one merger\nwith a satellite of total mass exceeding the host system's stellar mass, a\nthird had mergers with satellites of mass exceeding 3 times the host's stellar\nmass, and approximately one-sixth had mergers with satellites of mass exceeding\n10 times of the host's stellar mass. These mergers lead to a sharp, but often\ntemporary, decrease in the D/T of the hosts, implying that discs are usually\ndisrupted but then quickly re-grow. To do so, high cold gas fractions are\nrequired post-merger, as well as a relatively quiescent recent history (over a\nfew Gyrs before z=0).

Abstract: Transitional millisecond pulsars are systems that alternate between an\naccreting low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) state, and a non-accreting radio pulsar\nstate. When at the LMXB state, their X-ray and optical light curves show rapid\nflares and dips, origin of which is not well understood. We present results\nfrom our optical and NIR observing campaign of PSR J1023+0038, a transitional\nmillisecond pulsar observed in an accretion state. Our wide band optical\nphotopolarimetry indicates that the system shows intrinsic linear polarisation,\nthe degree of which is anticorrelated with optical emission, i.e. the\npolarisation could be diluted during the flares. However, the change in\nposition angle during the flares suggests an additional emerging polarised\ncomponent during the flares. We also find, based on our H$_\\alpha$ spectroscopy\nand Doppler tomography, that there is indication for change in the accretion\ndisc structure/emission during the flares, possibly due to a change in\naccretion flow. This, together with changing polarisation during the flares,\ncould mark the existence of magnetic propeller mass ejection process in the\nsystem. Furthermore, our analysis of flare profiles in both optical and NIR\nshows that NIR flares are at least as powerful as the optical ones and both can\nexhibit transition time scales less than 3 sec.

The\nnewly-revealed effects of the prevailing small-scale magnetic field within the\nconvection zone may offer possible solutions to this problem. The small-scale\nmagnetic fields can reduce the convective amplitude of small-scale motions\nthrough the Lorentz-force feedback, which concurrently inhibits the turbulent\nmixing of entropy between upflows and downflows. As a result, the effective\nPrandtl number may exceed unity inside the solar convection zone. In this\npaper, we propose and numerically confirm a possible suppression mechanism of\nconvective velocity in the effectively high-Prandtl number regime. If the\neffective horizontal thermal diffusivity decreases (the Prandtl number\naccordingly increases), the subadiabatic layer which is formed near the base of\nthe convection zone by continuous depositions of low entropy transported by\nadiabatically downflowing plumes is enhanced and extended. The global\nconvective amplitude in the high-Prandtl thermal convection is thus reduced\nespecially in the lower part of the convection zone via the change in the mean\nentropy profile which becomes more subadiabatic near the base and less\nsuperadiabatic in the bulk. \n\n"}

Since\n2009, the O-C trend of f1 changes, and the time derivative of the pulsation\nperiod (p_dot) passes from positive to negative; the reason of this change of\nregime is not clear and could be related to nonlinear interactions between\ndifferent pulsation modes. With the new data, the O-C diagram of the secondary\npulsation frequency (f2) continues to show two components (parabola and sine\nwave), like in the previous analysis. Various solutions are proposed to fit the\nO-C diagrams of f1 and f2, but in all of them, the sinusoidal components of f1\nand f2 differ or at least agree less well than before.

This is accounted for in\ncosmological studies using a global property of the SN host galaxy, typically\nthe host galaxy stellar mass. However, recent low-redshift studies suggest that\nthis effect manifests itself most strongly when using the local star-formation\nrate (SFR) at the SN location, rather than the global SFR or stellar mass of\nthe host galaxy. At high-redshift, such local SFRs are difficult to determine;\nhere, we show that an equivalent 'local' correction can be made by restricting\nthe SN Ia sample in globally star-forming host galaxies to a low-mass host\ngalaxy subset ($\\le10^{10} M_{\\odot}$).

In this work we reduce this degeneracy by\ncombining weak lensing together with strong lensing and stellar kinematics. Our\nanalysis is based on two galaxy samples: 45 strong lenses from the SLACS survey\nand 1,700 massive quiescent galaxies from the SDSS main spectroscopic sample\nwith weak lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. We use a\nBayesian hierarchical approach to jointly model all three observables. We fit\nthe data with models of varying complexity and show that a model with a radial\ngradient in the stellar mass-to-light ratio is required to simultaneously\ndescribe both galaxy samples. This result is driven by a subset of strong\nlenses with very steep total density profile, that cannot be fitted by models\nwith no gradient. Our measurements are unable to determine whether $M_*/L$\ngradients are due to variations in stellar population parameters at fixed IMF,\nor to gradients in the IMF itself. The inclusion of $M_*/L$ gradients decreases\ndramatically the inferred IMF normalisation, compared to previous lensing-based\nstudies, with the exact value depending on the assumed dark matter profile. The\nmain effect of strong lensing selection is to shift the stellar mass\ndistribution towards the high mass end, while the halo mass and stellar IMF\ndistribution at fixed stellar mass are not significantly affected. \n\n"}

These\nare known as pressure or p modes because the restoring force arises from the\npressure gradient. The broad frequency spectrum of this excitation mechanism\ngives rise to many oscillation modes, both radial and non-radial, excited\nsimultaneously.

Both are\napplied on a spatial domain that covers the entire solar surface. The\nnon-potential model uses a time series of observed synoptic magnetograms to\ndrive the non-potential quasi-static evolution of the coronal magnetic field.\nThis allows us to follow the formation and loss of equilibrium of magnetic flux\nropes. Following this a MHD simulation captures the dynamic evolution of the\nerupting flux rope. The present paper focuses on the MHD simulations that\nfollow the ejection of magnetic flux ropes to 4$R_\\odot$. We first propose a\ntechnique for specifying the pre-eruptive plasma properties in the corona.\nNext, time dependent MHD simulations describe the ejection of two magnetic flux\nropes, that produce time dependent boundary conditions for the magnetic field\nand plasma at 4$R_{\\odot}$. In the present paper, we show that the dual use of\nquasi-static non-potential magnetic field simulations and full time dependent\nMHD simulations can produce realistic inhomogeneous boundary conditions for\nspace weather forecasting tools. Before a fully operational model can be\nproduced there are a number of technical and scientific challenges that still\nneed to be addressed. \n\n"}

Because wind acceleration makes the\nwind velocities near the progenitors low, the density of the immediate vicinity\nof the red supergiant supernova progenitors can be higher than that\nextrapolated by using a constant terminal wind velocity. Therefore, even if the\nmass-loss rate of the progenitor is relatively low, it can have a dense\ncircumstellar medium at the immediate stellar vicinity and the early light\ncurves of Type IIP supernovae are significantly affected by it. We adopt a\nsimple beta velocity law to formulate the wind acceleration. We provide\nbolometric and multicolor light curves of Type IIP supernovae exploding within\nsuch accelerated winds from the combinations of three progenitors, 12 - 16\nMsun; five beta, 1-5; seven mass-loss rates, 1e-5 - 1e-2 Msun/yr; and four\nexplosion energies, 0.5e51 - 2e51 erg.

In this paper, we present a high-resolution chemo-hydrodynamical\nsimulation of the entire Milky-Way Galaxy, including stochastic star formation,\nHII regions, SNe, and element injection, that allows us to measure for the\ndistribution of 60Fe/56Fe and 26Al/27Al ratios over all stars in the Galaxy. We\nshow that the Solar System's abundance ratios are well within the normal range,\nbut that SLRs originate neither from triggering nor from confinement in\nlong-lived clouds as previously conjectured. Instead, we find that SLRs are\nabundant in newborn stars because star formation is correlated on galactic\nscales, so that ejecta preferentially enrich atomic gas that will subsequently\nbe accreted onto existing GMCs or will form new ones. Thus new generations of\nstars preferentially form in patches of the Galaxy contaminated by previous\ngenerations of stellar winds and supernovae. \n\n"}

Therefore the evolution of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) hosted by such\nstars are subject to the influence of other members of the cluster. Physically,\nPPDs might be truncated either by photoevaporation due to ultraviolet flux from\nmassive stars, or tidal truncation due to close stellar encounters. Here we aim\nto compare the two effects in real cluster environments. In this vein we first\nreview the properties of well studied stellar clusters with a focus on stellar\nnumber density, which largely dictates the degree of tidal truncation, and far\nultraviolet (FUV) flux, which is indicative of the rate of external\nphotoevaporation. We then review the theoretical PPD truncation radius due to\nan arbitrary encounter, additionally taking into account the role of eccentric\nencounters that play a role in hot clusters with a 1D velocity dispersion\n$\\sigma_v > 2$ km/s. Our treatment is then applied statistically to varying\nlocal environments to establish a canonical threshold for the local stellar\ndensity ($n_{c} > 10^4$ pc$^{-3}$) for which encounters can play a significant\nrole in shaping the distribution of PPD radii over a timescale $\\sim 3$ Myr. By\ncombining theoretical mass loss rates due to FUV flux with viscous spreading in\na PPD we establish a similar threshold for which a massive disc is completely\ndestroyed by external photoevaporation. Comparing these thresholds in local\nclusters we find that if either mechanism has a significant impact on the PPD\npopulation then photoevaporation is always the dominating influence. \n\n"}

Outward migration occurs when the\nprotoplanet resides within a gap with gravitationally unstable edges, as a high\nfraction of the accreted gas is high angular momentum gas from outside the\nprotoplanet's orbit. The effect of radiative heating from the protoplanet is\ncritical in determining the direction of the migration and the eccentricity of\nthe protoplanet. Gap opening is facilitated by efficient cooling that may not\nbe captured by the commonly used beta-cooling approximation. The protoplanet\ninitially accretes at a high rate (1e-3Mj/yr), and its accretion luminosity\ncould be a few tenths of the host star's luminosity, making the protoplanet\neasily observable (albeit only for a short time).

All of these characteristics are consistent\nwith models of self-scattering of submillimeter-wave emission from an optically\nthin inclined disk.

The magnitude of this feature is\npredicted to be independent of age at fixed chemical composition. For this\nreason, its difference in magnitude with respect to the MS turn-off (MS-TO)\npoint has been suggested as a possible diagnostic to estimate absolute globular\ncluster (GC) ages. We first demonstrate that the operational definition of the\nMS-knee currently adopted in the literature refers to the inflection point of\nthe MS (that we here more appropriately named MS-saddle), a feature that is\nwell distinct from the knee and that cannot be used as its proxy. The MS-knee\nis only visible in near-infrared CMDs, while the MS-saddle can be also detected\nin optical-NIR CMDs. By using different sets of isochrones we then demonstrate\nthat the absolute magni- tude of the MS-knee varies by a few tenths of a dex\nfrom one model to another, thus showing that at the moment stellar models may\nnot capture the full systematic error in the method. We also demonstrate that\nwhile the absolute magnitude of the MS-saddle is almost coincident in different\nmodels, it has a systematic dependence on the adopted color combinations which\nis not predicted by stellar models. Hence, it cannot be used as a reliable\nreference for absolute age determination. Moreover, when statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties are properly taken into ac- count, the difference in\nmagnitude between the MS-TO and the MS-saddle does not provide absolute ages\nwith better accuracy than other methods like the MS-fitting. \n\n"}

We aim to start identifying the factors that determine\nthe chemical structure of protostellar regions, by studying and comparing\nlow-mass embedded systems in key molecular tracers. The cold and warm chemical\nstructures of two embedded Class 0 systems, IRAS16293 and VLA1623 are\ncharacterized through interferometric observations. DCO+, N2H+ and N2D+ are\nused to trace the spatial distribution and physics of the cold regions of the\nenvelope, while c-C3H2 and C2H from models of the chemistry are expected to\ntrace the warm (UV-irradiated) regions. Both sources show a number of striking\nsimilarities and differences. DCO+ consistently traces the cold material at the\ndisk-envelope interface, where gas and dust temperatures are lowered due to\ndisk shadowing. N2H+ and N2D+, also tracing cold gas, show low abundances\ntowards VLA1623, but for IRAS16293, the distribution of N2D+ is consistent with\nthe same chemical models that reproduce DCO+. c-C3H2 and C2H show different\nspatial distributions for the two systems. For IRAS16293, c-C3H2 traces the\noutflow cavity wall, while C2H is found in the envelope material but not the\noutflow cavity wall. In contrast, toward VLA1623 both molecules trace the\noutflow cavity wall. Finally, hot core molecules are abundantly observed toward\nIRAS16293 but not toward VLA1623. We identify temperature as one of the key\nfactors in determining the chemical structure of protostars as seen in gaseous\nmolecules. More luminous protostars, such as IRAS16293, will have chemical\ncomplexity out to larger distances than colder protostars, such as VLA1623.\nAdditionally, disks in the embedded phase have a crucial role in controlling\nboth the gas and dust temperature of the envelope, and consequently the\nchemical structure. \n\n"}

We use the Gaia DR2 catalog to measure the relative\nproper motion of VFTS 16 and nearby bright stars to test if this star might\nhave been ejected from the central cluster, R136, via dynamical ejection. We\nfind that the position angle and magnitude of the relative proper motion (0.338\n+/- 0.046 mas/yr, or approximately 80 +\\- 11 km/s) of VFTS 16 are consistent\nwith ejection from R136 approximately 1.5 +/- 0.2 Myr ago, very soon after the\ncluster was formed. There is some tension with the presumed age of VFTS 16\nthat, from published stellar parameters, cannot be greater than 0.9 +0.3/-0.2\nMyr. Older ages for this star would appear to be prohibited due to the absence\nof He I lines in its optical spectrum, since this sets a firm lower limit on\nits effective temperature. The dynamical constraints may imply an unusual\nevolutionary history for this object, perhaps indicating it is a merger\nproduct. Gaia DR2 also confirms that another very massive star in the Tarantula\nNebula, VFTS 72 (alias BI253; O2 III-V(n)((f*)), is also a runaway on the basis\nof its proper motion as measured by Gaia. While its tangential proper motion\n(0.392 +/-0.062 mas/yr or 93 +/-15 km/s) would be consistent with dynamical\nejection from R136 approximately 1 Myr ago, its position angle is discrepant\nwith this direction at the 2$\\sigma$ level. From their Gaia DR2 proper motions\nwe conclude that the two ~100 solar mass O2 stars, VFTS 16 and VFTS72, are fast\nrunaway stars, with space velocities of around 100 km/s relative to R136 and\nthe local massive star population. The dynamics of VFTS16 are consistent with\nit having been ejected from R136, and this star therefore sets a robust lower\nlimit on the age of the central cluster of ~1.3 Myr. \n\n"}

Such obliquities may reveal clues about hot Jupiter\ndynamical histories. Common explanations for generating obliquities include\nhigh-eccentricity migration and primordial disk misalignment. This paper\ninvestigates another mechanism for producing stellar spin-orbit misalignments\nin systems hosting a close-in planet with an external, modestly inclined\ncompanion. Spin-orbit misalignment may be excited due to a secular resonance,\noccurring when the precession rate of the stellar spin axis (driven by the\ninner planet) becomes comparable to the nodal precession rate of the inner\nplanet (driven by the companion). Due to the spin-down of the host star via\nmagnetic braking, this resonance may be achieved during the star's\nmain-sequence lifetime for a wide range of planet masses and orbital\narchitectures. Obliquity excitation is accompanied by a decrease in mutual\ninclination between the inner planet and perturber, and can thus erase high\ninclinations. For hot Jupiters, the stellar spin axis is strongly coupled to\nthe orbital axis, and obliquity excitation by a giant planet companion requires\na strong perturber, usually located within 1-2 AU. For warm Jupiters, the spin\nand orbital axes are more weakly coupled, and the resonance may be achieved for\ndistant giant planet perturbers (at several to tens of AU). Since warm Jupiters\nhave a high occurrence rate of distant planetary companions with appropriate\nproperties for resonant obliquity excitation, stellar obliquities in warm\nJupiter systems may be common, particularly for warm Jupiters orbiting cool\nstars that have undergone significant spin-down. \n\n"}

The generated\nspectra contain several tens of thousands of molecular emission lines of H2O,\nOH, CO, CO2, HCN, C2H2, H2 and a few other molecules, as well as the forbidden\natomic emission lines of SI, SII, SIII, SiII, FeII, NeII, NeIII, ArII and\nArIII. In contrast to previously published works, we do not treat the\nabundances of the molecules nor the temperature in the disc as free parameters,\nbut use the complex results of detailed 2D ProDiMo disc models concerning gas\nand dust temperature structure, and molecular concentrations. FLiTs computes\nthe line emission spectra by ray tracing in an efficient, fast and reliable\nway. The results are broadly consistent with R=600 Spitzer/IRS observational\ndata of T Tauri stars concerning line strengths, colour, and line ratios. In\norder to achieve that agreement, however, we need to assume either a high\ngas/dust mass ratio of order 1000, or the presence of illuminated disc walls at\ndistances of a few au.

By\nincorporating knowledge of the properties of the planetary radius gap\nidentified by the CKS survey, we are able to investigate the properties of\nplanetary cores and their gaseous envelopes separately. Our primary findings\nare that the solid core masses of planets are higher around higher metallicity\nstars and that these more massive cores were able to accrete larger gas\nenvelopes. Furthermore, investigating the recently reported result that planets\nwith radii in the range (2-6Rearth) are more common at short periods around\nhigher metallicity stars in detail, we find that the average host star\nmetallicity of H/He atmosphere-hosting planets increases smoothly inside an\norbital period of ~20 days. We interpret the location of the metallicity\nincrease within the context of atmospheric photoevaporation: higher metallicity\nstars are likely to host planets with higher atmospheric metallicity, which\nincreases the cooling in the photoevaporative outflow, lowering the mass-loss\nrates. Therefore, planets with higher metallicity atmospheres are able to\nresist photoevaporation at shorter orbital periods. Finally, we find evidence\nat 2.8 sigma that planets that do not host H/He atmospheres at long periods are\nmore commonly found around lower metallicity stars.

We study the mass\ndistribution and kinematics of the CRGs by tuning the bulge-to-disk mass ratio\n($B/D$) for the progenitor; i.e., the target galaxy. We find that the lifetime\nof the ring correlates with the initial impact velocity vertical to the disk\nplane (i.e., $v_{z0}$). Three orbits for the collisional galaxy pair, on which\nclear and asymmetric rings form after collisions, are selected to perform the\n\\textit{N}-body simulations at different values of $B/D$ for the progenitor. It\nis found that the ring structures are the strongest for the CRGs with small\nvalues of $B/D$. The S\\'{e}rsic index, $n$, of the central remnant in the\ntarget galaxy becomes larger after collision. Moreover, the S\\'{e}rsic index of\na central remnant strongly correlates with the initial value of $B/D$ for the\nprogenitor. A bulge-less progenitor results in a late-type object in the center\nof the ring galaxy, whereas a bulge-dominated progenitor leads to an early-type\ncentral remnant.

A statistical analysis of all nebulae with measured recombination\nline abundances reveals no link between central star surface chemistry and\nnebular abundance discrepancy, but a clear link between binarity and the\nabundance discrepancy, as well as an anticorrelation between abundance\ndiscrepancies and nebular electron densities: all nebulae with a binary central\nstar with a period of less than 1.15 days have an abundance discrepancy factor\nexceeding 10, and an electron density less than $\\sim$1000 cm$^{-3}$; those\nwith longer period binaries have abundance discrepancy factors less than 10 and\nmuch higher electron densities.

The main signatures when observing the core of the\nloop (for this specific loop model) during the oscillation are: a widening\ninhomogeneous layer, decreasing intensity, an unchanged radius, and visible\nfine transverse structuring when the resolution is sufficient. The appearance\nof these signatures are delayed for loops with wider inhomogeneous layers, and\nquicker for loops oscillating at higher amplitudes.

We use self-consistent numerical simulations to uncover what\nparameters of host galaxies govern the opening angle spread. We constructed a\nseries of equilibrium models of galaxies with high spatial resolution, varying\nthe dark halo and bulge contribution in the overall gravitational potential,\nthe initial disc thickness of models and the Toomre parameter Q and followed\ntheir evolution for almost 8 Gyrs. Each model demonstrated the formation of\nclear X-structures with different flatness. We have obtained that opening\nangles lie in the range from 25 deg to 42 deg throughout the entire evolution.\nThese values are roughly consistent with observational data. The greatest\nvariation in the opening angles is obtained by varying the mass of the dark\nhalo. The initial thickness of the disc and the Toomre parameter are\nresponsible for smaller variations of the angle and shorter X-structures. An\nincrease of both parameters changes the morphology of in-plane bars and\nX-structures. In some cases we observed even double X-structures. The main\neffect of the bulge is to prevent buckling at intermediate and late stages of\nthe disc evolution. Comparison of models with different halo masses indicates\nthat the smallest observable values of opening angles can be associated with\nthe presence of a heavy dark halo (more than 3 masses of the disc within the\noptical radius). \n\n"}

Abstract: Only star clusters that are sufficiently compact and massive survive largely\nunharmed beyond 10 Myr. However, their compactness means a high stellar density\nwhich can lead to strong gravitational interactions between the stars. As young\nstars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on\npotentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these\nstrong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties\nof planetary systems. Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact\nhigh-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the\ngas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions. We concentrate\non the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations\nshow that in high-mass open clusters $80-90\\%$ of all disks/planetary systems\nshould be smaller than 50 AU just due to the strong stellar interactions in\nthese environments. Already in the initial phases, 3-4 close fly-bys lead to\ntypical disk sizes within the range of 18-27 AU. Afterwards, the disk sizes are\naltered only to a small extent. Our findings agree with the recent observation\nthat the disk sizes in the once dense environment of the Upper Scorpio OB\nassociation, NGC~2362, and h/$\\chi$Persei are at least three times smaller in\nsize than, for example, in Taurus.

Tracing these\nformer nuclei of stripped galaxies provides a unique way to track the assembly\nhistory of a galaxy or galaxy cluster. In this paper we present a new method to\nestimate how many UCDs host an SMBH in their center and thus are stripped\ngalaxy nuclei. We revisit the dynamical mass measurements that suggest many\nUCDs have more mass than expected from stellar population estimates, which\nrecent observations have shown is due to the presence of an SMBH. We revise the\nstellar population mass estimates using a new empirical relation between the\nmass-to-light ratio (M/L) and metallicity, and use this to predict which UCDs\nare most likely to host an SMBH. This enables us to calculate the fraction of\nUCDs that host SMBHs across their entire luminosity range for the first time.\nWe then apply the SMBH occupation fraction to the observed luminosity function\nof UCDs and estimate that in the Fornax and Virgo cluster alone there should be\n$69^{+32}_{-25}$ stripped nuclei with SMBHs. This analysis shows that stripped\nnuclei with SMBHs are almost as common in clusters as present-day galaxy\nnuclei.

The anomalous abundance in $^{26}$Al may have originated from the\naccreted material in the wind of a massive $\\apgt 20$\\,$M_\\odot$ Wolf-Rayet\nstar, but the star could also have been a member of the parental star-cluster\ninstead of an interloper or an older generation that enriched the proto-solar\nnebula. The protoplanetary disk at that time was already truncated around the\nKuiper-cliff (at $45$ au) by encounters with another cluster members before it\nwas enriched by the wind of the nearby Wolf-Rayet star. The supernova explosion\nof a nearby star, possibly but not necessarily the exploding Wolf-Rayet star,\nheated the disk to $\\apgt 1500$K, melting small dust grains and causing the\nencapsulation and preservation of $^{26}$Al into vitreous droplets. This\nsupernova, and possibly several others, caused a further abrasion of the disk\nand led to its observed tilt of $5.6\\pm1.2^\\circ$ with respect to the Sun's\nequatorial plane.

The radii of these stars, in particular, are sensitive to the\ndetails of inefficient, super-adiabatic convection occurring in their outermost\nlayers. The standard treatment of convection in stellar evolution models, based\non the Mixing-Length Theory (MLT), provides only a very approximate description\nof convection in the super-adiabatic regime. Moreover, it contains a free\nparameter, alpha_MLT, whose standard calibration is based on the Sun, and is\nroutinely applied to other stars ignoring the differences in their global\nparameters (e.g., effective temperature, gravity, chemical composition) and\nprevious evolutionary history. In this paper, we present a calibration of\nalpha_MLT based on three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics (3D RHD)\nsimulations of convection. The value of alpha_MLT is adjusted to match the\nspecific entropy in the deep, adiabatic layers of the convective envelope to\nthe corresponding value obtained from the 3D RHD simulations, as a function of\nthe position of the star in the (log g, log T_eff) plane and its chemical\ncomposition.

Abstract: Disk polarization in (sub)millimeter dust continuum is a rapidly growing\nfield in the ALMA era. It opens up the exciting possibility of detecting and\ncharacterizing magnetic fields and grain growth in disks around young stellar\nobjects. However, to use polarization for probing the disk properties, its\nproduction mechanism must be ascertained first. To date, the conventional\nmechanism involving magnetically aligned grains fails to explain the\npolarization patterns detected in most disks. This is especially true for the\ninclined disk of HL Tau in ALMA Band 3 (wavelength $\\sim 3$ mm), which has an\nelliptical polarization pattern. The elliptical pattern was taken as evidence\nfor polarized emission by dust grains aligned with their long axes\nperpendicular the direction of the radiative flux. We show that the radiatively\naligned grains produce a circular, rather than elliptical, polarization pattern\neven in inclined disks such as HL Tau. An elliptical polarization pattern can\nbe produced if the grains are aligned aerodynamically by the difference in\nrotation speed between the dust and gas through the Gold mechanism. However, a\nstrong azimuthal variation in polarized intensity is expected for both the\nradiative and aerodynamic alignment, but not observed in the HL Tau disk in\nALMA Band 3. We conclude that neither of these two mechanisms alone can explain\nthe data and the origin of the 3 mm polarization remains a mystery. We\nspeculate that this mystery may be resolved by a combination of both direct\nemission and scattering by aerodynamically aligned grains. \n\n"}

We propose to\nestimate the variations in shape of the CCF by fitting a Skew Normal (SN)\ndensity which, unlike the commonly employed Normal density, includes a skewness\nparameter to capture the asymmetry of the CCF induced by stellar activity and\nthe convective blueshift. The performances of the proposed method are compared\nto the commonly employed Normal density using both simulations and real\nobservations, with different levels of activity and signal-to-noise ratio. When\nconsidering real observations, the correlation between the RV and the asymmetry\nof the CCF and between the RV and the width of the CCF are stronger when using\nthe parameters estimated with the SN density rather than the ones obtained with\nthe commonly employed Normal density. Using the proposed SN approach, the\nuncertainties estimated on the RV defined as the median of the SN are on\naverage 10% smaller than the uncertainties calculated on the mean of the\nNormal. The uncertainties estimated on the asymmetry parameter of the SN are on\naverage 15% smaller than the uncertainties measured on the Bisector Inverse\nSlope Span (BIS SPAN), which is the commonly used parameter to evaluate the\nasymmetry of the CCF. We also propose a new model to account for stellar\nactivity when fitting a planetary signal to RV data. Based on simple\nsimulations, we were able to demonstrate that this new model improves the\nplanetary detection limits by 12% compared to the model commonly used to\naccount for stellar activity. The SN density is a better model than the Normal\ndensity for characterizing the CCF since the correlations used to probe stellar\nactivity are stronger and the uncertainties of the RV estimate and the\nasymmetry of the CCF are both smaller. \n\n"}

An assessment of\nLISA detection prospects requires an estimate of the abundance and properties\nof MBHBs that form and evolve during the assembly of cosmic structures. To this\naim, we employ a semi-analytic model to follow the co-evolution of MBHBs within\ntheir host galaxies. We identify three major evolutionary channels driving the\nbinaries to coalescence: two standard paths along which the binary evolution is\ndriven by interactions with the stellar and/or gaseous environment, and a novel\nchannel where MBHB coalescence occurs during the interaction with a third black\nhole. For each channel, we follow the orbital evolution of MBHBs with\nphysically motivated models that include a self-consistent treatment of the\norbital eccentricity. We find that LISA will detect between $\\approx 25$ and\n$\\approx 75$ events per year depending on the seed model.

The statistics of exo-Jupiters\nindicate that the Solar System is unusual at the ~1% level among Sun-like stars\n(or ~0.1% among all stars). But why are we different?\n  Successful formation models for both the Solar System and exoplanet systems\nrely on two key processes: orbital migration and dynamical instability. Systems\nof close-in super-Earths or sub-Neptunes require substantial radial inward\nmotion of solids either as drifting mm- to cm-sized pebbles or migrating\nEarth-mass or larger planetary embryos. We argue that, regardless of their\nformation mode, the late evolution of super-Earth systems involves migration\ninto chains of mean motion resonances, generally followed by instability when\nthe disk dissipates. This pattern is likely also ubiquitous in giant planet\nsystems. We present three models for inner Solar System formation -- the\nlow-mass asteroid belt, Grand Tack, and Early Instability models -- each\ninvoking a combination of migration and instability.\n  We identify bifurcation points in planetary system formation.

This\ninfrared-radio correlation provides the basis for the use of radio luminosity\nas a star-formation tracer. Recent stacking and survival analysis studies find\nq to be decreasing with increasing redshift. It was pointed out that a possible\ncause of the redshift trend could be the computation of rest-frame radio\nluminosity via a single power-law assumption of the star-forming galaxies'\n(SFGs) SED.To test this, we constrained the shape of the radio SED of a sample\nof HSFGs. To achieve a broad rest-frame frequency range, we combined previously\npublished VLA observations of the COSMOS field at 1.4 GHz and 3 GHz with\nunpublished GMRT observations at 325 MHz and 610 MHz by employing survival\nanalysis to account for non-detections in the GMRT maps.

Changes in\nspectral line profiles are inverted to a stellar surface temperature map using\nour $i$Map code. The long-term photometric record is employed to compare our\nmap with previously published maps. Four cool spots were reconstructed, but no\npolar spot was seen. The temperature difference to the photosphere of the spots\nis between 990 and 280K. Two spots are reconstructed with a typical solar\nmorphology with an umbra and a penumbra. For the one isolated and relatively\nround spot (A), we determine an umbral temperature of 990K and a penumbral\ntemperature of 180K below photospheric temperature. The umbra to photosphere\nintensity ratio of EK Dra is approximately only half of that of a comparison\nsunspot. A test inversion from degraded line profiles showed that the higher\nspectral resolution of PEPSI reconstructs the surface with a temperature\ndifference that is on average 10% higher than before and with smaller surface\nareas by 10-20%. PEPSI is therefore better suited to detecting and\ncharacterising temperature inhomogeneities.

We obtained long-slit optical spectroscopy of\ntwo transits of HAT-P-11b with the Optical System for Imaging and\nlow-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) at Gran Telescopio\nCanarias (GTC) on August 30 2016 and September 25 2017. We integrated the\nspectrum of HAT-P-11 and one reference star in several spectroscopic channels\nacross the $\\lambda\\sim$ 400-785 nm region, creating numerous light curves of\nthe transits. We fit analytic transit curves to the data taking into account\nthe systematic effects and red noise present in the time series in an effort to\nmeasure the change of the planet-to-star radius ratio\n($R_\\mathrm{p}/R_\\mathrm{s}$) across wavelength. By fitting both transits\ntogether, we find a slope in the transmission spectrum showing an increase of\nthe planetary radius towards blue wavelengths. A closer inspection to the\ntransmission spectrum of the individual data sets reveals that the first\ntransit presents this slope while the transmission spectrum of the second data\nset is flat. Additionally we detect hints of Na absorption in the first night,\nbut not in the second. We conclude that the transmission spectrum slope and Na\nabsorption excess found in the first transit observation are caused by\nunocculted stellar spots. Modeling the contribution of unocculted spots to\nreproduce the results of the first night we find a spot filling factor of\n$\\delta=0.62^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$ and a spot-to-photosphere temperature difference\nof $\\Delta T = 429^{+184}_{-299}$ K. \n\n"}

We have searched the\nrecently-released North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves\n(NANOGrav) 11-year data set for GWs from individual SMBHBs in circular orbits.\nAs we did not find strong evidence for GWs in our data, we placed 95\\% upper\nlimits on the strength of GWs from such sources as a function of GW frequency\nand sky location. We placed a sky-averaged upper limit on the GW strain of $h_0\n< 7.3(3) \\times 10^{-15}$ at $f_\\mathrm{gw}= 8$ nHz. We also developed a\ntechnique to determine the significance of a particular signal in each pulsar\nusing ``dropout' parameters as a way of identifying spurious signals in\nmeasurements from individual pulsars. We used our upper limits on the GW strain\nto place lower limits on the distances to individual SMBHBs.

A target can be monitored from there for over 40 days without diurnal\ninterruption during a polar winter. This makes Kunlun station a perfect site to\nsearch for short-period transiting exoplanets. Since 2008, an observatory has\nbeen built at Kunlun station and three telescopes are working there. Using\nthese telescopes, the AST3 project has been carried out over the last six years\nwith a search for transiting exoplanets as one of its key programs (CHESPA). In\nthe austral winters of 2016 and 2017, a set of target fields in the Southern\nCVZ of TESS (Ricker et al. 2009) were monitored by the AST3-II telescope. In\nthis paper, we introduce the CHESPA and present the first data release\ncontaining photometry of 26,578 bright stars (m_i < 15). The best photometric\nprecision at the optimum magnitude for the survey is around 2 mmag. To\ndemonstrate the data quality, we also present a catalog of 221 variables with a\nbrightness variation greater than 5 mmag from the 2016 data.

These variables will require careful attention to avoid false-positive\nsignals when searching for transiting exoplanets.

Here\nwe derive analytical solutions to the overshoot of the mid-transit depth caused\nby stellar limb darkening compared to the (R_p/R_s)^2 estimate for arbitrary\ntransit impact parameters. In turn, this allows us to compute the true\nplanet-to-star radius ratio from the transit depth for a given parameterization\nof a limb darkening law and for a known transit impact parameter. We calculate\nthe maximum emerging specific stellar intensity covered by the planet in\ntransit and derive analytic solutions for the transit depth overshoot.\nSolutions are presented for the linear, quadratic, square-root, logarithmic,\nand non-linear stellar limb darkening with arbitrary transit impact parameters.\nWe also derive formulae to calculate the average intensity along the transit\nchord, which allows us to estimate the actual transit depth (and therefore\nR_p/R_s) from the mean in-transit flux. The transit depth overshoot of\nexoplanets compared to the (R_p/R_s)^2 estimate increases from about 15% for A\nmain-sequence stars to roughly 20% for sun-like stars and some 30% for K and M\nstars. The error in our analytical solutions for R_p/R_s from the small planet\napproximation is orders of magnitude smaller than the uncertainties arising\nfrom typical noise in real light curves and from the uncertain limb darkening.\nOur equations can be used to predict with high accuracy the expected transit\ndepth of extrasolar planets.

We derived accurate stellar ages for the cluster NGC6530,\nassociated with the Lagoon Nebula to infer its SF history. We use the Gaia-ESO\nsurvey observations and Gaia DR2 data, to derive cluster membership and\nfundamental stellar parameters. We identified 652 confirmed and 9 probable\nmembers. The reddening inferred for members and non-members allows us to\ndistinguish MS stars and giants, in agreement with the distances inferred from\nGaia DR2 data. The foreground and background stars show a spatial pattern that\ntraces the 3D structure of the nebular dust component. We derive stellar ages\nfor 382 confirmed cluster members and we find that the gravity-sensitive gamma\nindex distribution for M stars is correlated with stellar age. For all members\nwith Teff<5500 K, the mean logarithmic age is 5.84 (units of years) with a\ndispersion of 0.36 dex. The age distribution of stars with accretion and/or\ndisk (CTTSe) is similar to that of stars without accretion and without disk\n(WTTSp). We interpret this dispersion as evidence of a real age spread since\nthe total uncertainties on age determinations, derived from Monte Carlo\nsimulations, are significantly smaller than the observed spread. This\nconclusion is supported by the evidence of a decreasing of the\ngravity-sensitive gamma index as a function of stellar ages.

The eclipses are not\nrecurring periodically, are variable in depth, lack a flat bottom, and their\nduration is comparable to the typical timescale between eclipses. The dimming\nis associated with reddening consistent with dust extinction. Taken together\nthis implies the presence of rings around these four stars, with radii ranging\nfrom 0.01 to 40 AU, comprised of optically thin dust clouds. The stars also\nshow IR excess indicating the presence of evolved circumstellar disks, with\norders of magnitude more material than needed for the eclipses. However, the\nrings need to cover an opening angle of about 20 degrees to explain how common\nthese variable stars are in the coeval population in the same region, which is\nmore extended than a typical disk. Thus, we propose that the rings may not be\npart of the disks, but instead separate structures with larger scale heights.\nTo be sustained over years, the rings need to be replenished by dust from the\ndisk or gravitationally bound to an object (e.g., planets or planetesimals).\nThese four stars belong to a growing and diverse class of post-T Tauri stars\nwith dips or eclipses in their lightcurves.
