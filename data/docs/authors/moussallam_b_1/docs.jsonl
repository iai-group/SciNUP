According to the\nhadrogenesis conjecture the nature of the two types of states is distinct. The\naxial-vector mesons are generated dynamically by coupled-channel interactions\nbased on the chiral Lagrangian written down in terms of the Goldstone bosons\nand the light vector mesons. We propose a novel counting scheme that arises if\nthe chiral Lagrangian is supplemented by constraints from large-N_c QCD in the\ncontext of the hadrogenesis conjecture. The counting scheme is successfully\ntested by a systematic study of the properties of vector mesons. The spectrum\nof light axial-vector mesons is derived relying on the leading order\ninteraction of the Goldstone bosons with the vector mesons supplemented by a\nphenomenology for correction terms. The f_1(1282), b_1(1230), h_1(1386),\na_1(1230) and K_1(1272) mesons are recovered as molecular states.

Two different mechanisms are\nanalyzed: on the one hand, the scattering gamma gamma-> h of two real photons\nin a gamma-gamma collider; on the other, the more traditional mechanism of\nvirtual photon fusion, e+e- -->e+e- + h. Owing to the peculiar properties of\nthe Higgs boson self-interactions within the general 2HDM, we find that the\noverall production rates can be boosted up significantly, provided the charged\nHiggs mass is not too heavy. For example, if the latter is slightly above 100\nGeV and, in addition, the lightest CP-even Higgs boson falls in the ballpark of\nthe LEP bound on the SM Higgs mass up to a few hundred GeV, the cross-sections\nmay typically render \\sigma(gamma gamma-> h)= 0.1-1 pb and \\sigma(e+e- --> e+e-\n+ h)\\sim 0.01 pb -- in both cases well above the SM prediction.

For directional detection, we find that the observed departures from\nMaxwell-Boltzmann increase the contrast of the signal and change the typical\ndirection of incoming DM particles. For iDM, the expected signals at direct\ndetection experiments are changed dramatically: the annual modulation can be\nenhanced by more than a factor two, and the relative rates of DAMA compared to\nCDMS can change by an order of magnitude, while those compared to CRESST can\nchange by a factor of two. The spectrum of the signal can also change\ndramatically, with many features arising due to substructure. For LDM the\nspectral effects are smaller, but changes do arise that improve the\ncompatibility with existing experiments. We find that the phase of the\nmodulation can depend upon energy, which would help discriminate against\nbackground should it be found. \n\n"}

Quintessence fields in the dark energy regime and inflaton fields\nduring inflation often have a very large background field value. Thus any other\nfield with its mass dependent on the quintessence/inflaton background field\nvalue through a moderate coupling will become very massive during the dark\nenergy/inflation phase and its quantum corrections to the scalar effective\npotential will be suppressed. This concept is developed in this paper using the\ndecoupling theorem. The problem then reduces to a quantitative question of the\nsize of suppression effects within the parameter space of coupling constants,\nscalar field background value and renormalization scale. Some numerical\nexamples are presented both for inflation and quintessence, but the approach is\ngeneral and can be applied to any scalar field effective potential. The\nconsequences to dark energy of the decoupling effect developed here is that the\nquintessence field need not just be an incredibly weakly interacting field,\noften added as simply an add-on to generate dark energy and have no other\npurpose. Instead, this quintessence field could play a central role in the\nparticle physics dynamics at early times and then simply decouple at late times\nbefore the onset of the dark energy phase.

The answer to this question crucially depends on the\nmechanism of mass generation in QCD and interconnection of confinement and\nchiral symmetry breaking. This question can be clarified from spectroscopy of\nhadrons and their axial properties. Almost systematical parity doubling of\nhighly excited hadrons suggests that their mass is not related to chiral\nsymmetry breaking in the vacuum and is approximately chirally symmetric. Then\nthere is a possibility for existence of confining but chirally symmetric\nmatter. We clarify a possible mechanism underlying such a phase at low\ntemperatures and large density. Namely, at large density the Pauli blocking\nprevents the gap equation to generate a solution with broken chiral symmetry.\nHowever, the chirally symmetric part of the quark Green function as well as all\ncolor non-singlet quantities are still infrared divergent, meaning that the\nsystem is with confinement. A possible phase transition to such a matter is\nmost probably of the first order. This is because there are no chiral partners\nto the lowest lying hadrons. \n\n"}

The measurements were performed at the Cooler Synchrotron\nCOSY-Juelich with the WASA-at-COSY detection system.The internal deuteron beam\nof COSY was scattered on a pellet-type deuteron target.

The corresponding excess energy in the 4He-eta system varied from\n-51.4 MeV to 22 MeV.

Here, we explore the prospect for corroboration of this\nsuggestion from 5 additional CMS&ATLAS search strategies targeting the\nproduction of light stops & gluinos at lower jet counts, which variously depend\non heavy flavor tagging and the inclusion or exclusion of associated leptons.\nThe current operating phase of the 7TeV LHC is highly conducive to the\nproduction of gluinos & light stops, given the supersymmetric particle mass\nhierarchy M_t_1<M_g<M_q that naturally evolves from the dynamics of the model\nnamed No-Scale FSU5 that we presently study.

One major limitation of the CJT effective action\nis that its loopwise expansion introduces residual violations of possible\nglobal symmetries, thus giving rise to massive Goldstone bosons in the\nspontaneously broken phase of the theory. In this paper we develop a novel\nsymmetry-improved CJT formalism for consistently encoding global symmetries in\na loopwise expansion. In our formalism, the extremal solutions of the fields\nand propagators to a loopwise truncated CJT effective action are subject to\nadditional constraints given by the Ward identities due to global symmetries.\nBy considering a simple O(2) scalar model, we show that, unlike other methods,\nour approach satisfies a number of important field-theoretic properties. In\nparticular, we find that the Goldstone boson resulting from spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking of O(2) is massless and the phase transition is a second\norder one, already in the Hartree-Fock approximation. After taking the sunset\ndiagrams into account, we show how our approach properly describes the\nthreshold properties of the massless Goldstone boson and the Higgs particle in\nthe loops. Finally, assuming minimal modifications to the Hartree-Fock\napproximated CJT effective action, we calculate the corresponding\nsymmetry-improved CJT effective potential and discuss the conditions for its\nuniqueness for scalar-field values away from its minimum. \n\n"}

In this paper, we seek similar\nconnections in inflation, relating cosmological observations to the physics\nresponsible for the accelerated expansion.

Quark matter is\ndescribed as a mixture of free Fermi gases composed by quarks $u$, $d$, $s$ and\nelectrons, in chemical equilibrium under weak interactions. Due to the presence\nof strong magnetic fields the particles' transverse motion is quantized into\nLandau levels, and the surface tension has a different value in the parallel\nand transverse directions with respect to the magnetic field.\n  We calculate the transverse and longitudinal surface tension for different\nvalues of the magnetic field and for quark matter drops with different sizes,\nfrom a few fm to the bulk limit. For baryon number densities between $2-10$\ntimes the nuclear saturation density, the surface tension falls in the range $2\n- 20$ MeV /fm$^{2}$. The largest contribution comes from strange quarks which\nhave a surface tension an order of magnitude larger than the one for $u$ or $d$\nquarks and more than two orders of magnitude larger than for electrons. Our\nresults show that the total surface tension is quite insensitive to the size of\nthe drop.

A minimal formula with the correct asymptotic\nform on small and large scales reproduces to about ten percent the evolution on\nall scales probed by the CMB.

First, using a variety of simple sleuthing\ntechniques, we find evidence that the properties of the high and low redshift\nSNe Ia observed so far differ from one another. Next, we examine the effects of\nincluding simple phenomenological models for evolution in the analysis. The\nresult is that cosmological models and evolution are highly degenerate with one\nanother, so that the incorporation of even very simple models for evolution\nmakes it virtually impossible to pin down the values of $\\Omega_M$ and\n$\\Omega_\\Lambda$, the density parameters for nonrelativistic matter and for the\ncosmological constant, respectively. Moreover, we show that if SNe Ia evolve\nwith time, but evolution is neglected in analyzing data, then, given enough SNe\nIa, the analysis hones in on values of $\\Omega_M$ and $\\Omega_\\Lambda$ which\nare incorrect. Using Bayesian methods, we show that the probability that the\ncosmological constant is nonzero (rather than zero) is unchanged by the SNe Ia\ndata when one accounts for the possibility of evolution, provided that we do\nnot discriminate among open, closed and flat cosmologies a priori. The case for\nnonzero cosmological constant is stronger if the Universe is presumed to be\nflat, but still depends sensitively on the degree to which the peak\nluminosities of SNe Ia evolve as a function of redshift. The estimated value of\n$H_0$, however, is only negligibly affected by accounting for possible\nevolution. \n\n"}

For d=3 these arguments have been\nconfirmed numerically only in the SU(2) case with center Z(2), simply because\nall SU(N) Yang-Mills theories with N>=3 seem to have non-universal first order\nphase transitions.

In the present paper we\nset for 3D Potts models (Ising and 3-state) the scale of the dynamical effects\nby comparing to equilibrium results at first and second order phase transition\ntemperatures, obtained by re-weighting from a multicanonical ensemble. Our\nfinding is that the dynamics entirely overwhelms the critical and non-critical\nequilibrium effects.\n  In the second half of the paper we extend our results by investigating the\nGlauber dynamics of pure SU(3) lattice gauge on $N_{\\tau} N_{\\sigma}^3$\nlattices directly under heating quenches from the confined into the deconfined\nregime. The exponential growth factors of the initial response are calculated,\nwhich give Debye screening mass estimates.

The resulting two-loop integrals\nare treated by first performing the angular integration analytically, using the\nmethod of Gegenbauer polynomials, followed by a numerical evaluation of the\nremaining two-dimensional integration over the moduli of the Euclidean loop\nmomenta.

Abstract: In models with universal extra dimensions (i.e. in which all Standard Model\nfields, including fermions, propagate into compact extra dimensions) momentum\nconservation in the extra dimensions leads to the conservation of Kaluza--Klein\n(KK) number at each vertex. KK number is violated by loop effects because of\nthe orbifold imposed to reproduce the chiral Standard Model with zero modes,\nhowever, a KK parity remains at any order in perturbation theory which leads to\nthe existence of a stable lightest KK particle (LKP). In addition, the\ndegeneracy in the KK spectrum is lifted by radiative corrections so that all\nother KK particles eventually decay into the LKP. We investigate cases where\nthe Standard Model lives in five or six dimensions with compactification radius\nof TeV$^{-1}$ size and the LKP is the first massive state in the KK tower of\neither the photon or the neutrino.

We use charge densities derived from elastic electron scattering data\nto calculate model independent, analytic form factors for various target nuclei\nimportant in dark matter searches, such as Si, Ge, S, Ca and others.

We\ncompare the results for those primary collision with the photons produced in\nreactions of the thermalized secondary particles, which are calculated within\nscaling hydrodynamics. The QCD processes are taken in leading order. Nuclear\nshadowing corrections, which alter the involved nuclear structure functions are\nexplicitly taken into account and compared to unshadowed results.

Results of the two-source model fit to RHIC experimental data at\nmidrapidity coincide with the results of the one-source thermal model fit,\nindicating the formation of an extended fireball, which is three times larger\nthan the corresponding core at SPS. \n\n"}

At leading order a parameter-free prediction is obtained for\nthe scattering of Goldstone bosons off vector mesons with J^P=1^- once we\ninsist on approximate crossing symmetry of the unitarized scattering amplitude.\nA resonance spectrum arises that is remarkably close to the empirical pattern.\nIn particular, we find that the strangeness-zero resonances h_1(1380), f_(1285)\nand b_1(1235) are formed due to strong K \\bar K_\\mu and \\bar K K_\\mu channels.\nThis leads to large coupling constants of those resonances to the latter\nstates. \n\n"}

In the S=1\nsector, we find an attractive interaction in the $\\Delta K$ channel with I=1\nwhile it is repulsive for I=2. The attractive interaction leads to a pole in\nthe second Riemann sheet of the complex plane and is manifested as a large\nstrength in the scattering amplitude close to the $\\Delta K$ threshold, which\nis not the case for I=2.\n  We use the unitarized coupled channel approach to also investigate all the\nother possible values of strangeness and isospin. We find two bound states in\nthe SU(3) limit corresponding to the octet and decuplet representations. These\nare found to split into eight different trajectories in the complex plane when\nthe SU(3) symmetry is broken gradually. Finally, we are able to provide a\nreasonable description for a good number of 4-star ${{3/2}}^-$ resonances\nlisted by the Particle Data Group. In particular, the $\\Xi(1820)$, the\n$\\Lambda(1520)$ and the $\\Sigma(1670)$ states are well reproduced. We predict a\nfew other resonances and also evaluate the couplings of the observed resonances\nto the various channels from the residues at the poles of the scattering matrix\nfrom where partial decay widths into different channels can be evaluated. \n\n"}

Since the concept of wave function depends on the formalism,\nthe conclusions of light-cone theory requiring nonzero angular momentum\ncomponents are not inconsistent with our results.
