We find\nthat fitting accuracy depends sensitively on galaxy profile shape. Exponential\ndisks are well fit with Sersic models and have small measurement errors,\nwhereas fits to de Vaucouleurs profiles show larger uncertainties owing to the\nlarge amount of light at large radii. We find that both codes provide reliable\nfits and little systematic error, when the effective surface brightness is\nabove that of the sky. Moreover, both codes return errors that significantly\nunderestimate the true fitting uncertainties, which are best estimated with\nsimulations.

Despite providing a good fit to the data,\ncurrent spectral models of the X-ray spectrum of AGN observed through an\naccretion disk wind are ad-hoc in their treatment of the properties of the wind\nmaterial. In order to address these limitations we adopt a numerical\ncomputation method that links a series of radiative transfer calculations,\nincorporating the effect of a global velocity field in a self-consistent manner\n(XSCORT). We present a series of example spectra from the XSCORT code that\nallow us to examine the shape of AGN X-ray spectra seen through a wind, for a\nrange of velocity and density distributions, total column densities and initial\nionization parameters. These detailed spectral models clearly show considerable\ncomplexity and structure that is strongly affected by all these factors. The\npresence of sharp features in the XSCORT spectra contrasts strongly with both\nthe previous models and with the smooth nature of the observed X-ray spectra of\nAGN with soft X-ray excesses, demonstrating that accretion disk winds are\nunlikely to be the origin of this mysterious spectral feature. The most\nsignificant parameter affecting the presence of the sharp features in the\nmodels is the terminal velocity of the wind. Increasing the terminal velocity\nof the absorbing material to ~c, and hence dramatically increasing the velocity\ndispersion across the wind, could potentially remove these features resulting\nin a spectrum similar to the previous models.

The\ndramatic impact of these boost factors for indirect detection of antiparticles,\nfor instance with the PAMELA satellite or the coming AMS-02 experiment, asks\nfor their detailed calculation. We take into account the results of high\nresolution N-body dark matter simulations to calculate the most likely energy\ndependent boost factors linked to the cosmic ray propagation properties, for\nanti-protons and positrons. Starting from the mass and space distributions of\nsub-halos, the anti-proton and positron propagators are used to calculate the\nmean value and the variance of the boost factor for the primary fluxes. We take\nadvantage of the statistical method introduced in Lavalle et al. (2007) and\ncross-check the results with Monte Carlo computations. By spanning some extreme\nconfigurations of sub-halo and propagation properties, we find that the average\ncontribution of the clumps is negligible compared to that of the smooth dark\nmatter component.

This result is\nindependent of the nature of the self-annihilating dark matter candidate\nconsidered, and provides precise estimates of the theoretical and the\nstatistical uncertainties of the antimatter flux from dark matter\nsubstructures.

We find that ~80% of\nthe EGRB photon flux at > 100 MeV can be explained by the sum of the two\npopulations, while ~45% can be accounted for only by blazars. The predicted\nEGRB spectrum is in agreement with a wide range of the observed data from X-ray\nto GeV, within the systematic uncertainties in the EGRB determination by EGRET.\nThese results indicate that AGNs including blazars are the primary source of\nEGRB.

Almost all of the EGRB flux from blazars\nwill be resolved into discrete sources by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope,\nwhile that from non-blazar AGNs will largely remain unresolved.

Therefore, for example, given two bursts of identical peak luminosity\nnear the detection threshold, a dim soft burst will be preferentially detected\nover a dim hard burst. This detector bias can create or skew an apparent\ncorrelation where increasingly hard GRBs appear increasingly bright.

The present sample now includes 32 clusters of\ngalaxies, including 15 clusters above z=0.4, which corresponds to a three-fold\nincrease compared to our previous work at high redshift. At z<0.4 we have\nobtained new observations of AGN candidates in six additional clusters and\nfound no new luminous AGN in cluster members. Our total sample of 17\nlow-redshift clusters contains only two luminous AGN, while at high redshifts\nthere are 18 such AGN, or an average of more than one per cluster. We have\ncharacterized the evolution of luminous X-ray AGN as the fraction of galaxies\nwith M_R < M_R^*(z)+1 that host AGN with rest-frame, hard X-ray [2--10 keV]\nluminosities L_X,H >= 10^43 \\ergs.

The emission could\noriginate from either truly diffuse processes or from unresolved point sources.\nAlthough the majority of the 271 point sources detected by EGRET (Energetic\nGamma Ray Experiment Telescope) are unidentified, of the identified sources,\nblazars are the dominant candidates. Therefore, unresolved blazars may be\nconsidered the main contributor to the EGRB, and many studies have been carried\nout to understand their distribution, evolution and contribution to the EGRB.\nConsidering that gamma-ray emission comes mostly from jets of blazars and that\nthe jet emission decreases rapidly with increasing jet to line-of-sight angle,\nit is not surprising that EGRET was not able to detect many large inclination\nangle active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Though Fermi could only detect a few large\ninclination angle AGNs in the first three months' survey, it is expected to\ndetect many such sources in the near future.

Abstract: The origin and progenitors of short-hard gamma-ray bursts remain a puzzle and\na highly debated topic. Recent Swift observations suggest that these GRBs may\nbe related to catastrophic explosions in degenerate compact stars, denoted as\n\"Type I\" GRBs. The most popular models include the merger of two compact\nstellar objects (NS-NS or NS-BH). We utilize a Monte Carlo approach to\ndetermine whether a merger progenitor model can self-consistently account for\nall the observations of short-hard GRBs, including a sample with redshift\nmeasurements in the Swift era (z-known sample) and the CGRO/BATSE sample. We\napply various merger time delay distributions invoked in compact star merger\nmodels to derive the redshift distributions of these Type I GRBs, and then\nconstrain the unknown luminosity function of Type I GRBs using the observed\nluminosity-redshift (L - z) distributions of the z-known sample. The best\nluminosity function model, together with the adopted merger delay model, are\nthen applied to confront the peak flux distribution (log N - log P\ndistribution) of the BATSE and Swift samples. We find that for all the merger\nmodels invoking a range of merger delay time scales (including those invoking a\nlarge fraction of \"prompt mergers\"), it is difficult to reconcile the models\nwith all the data. The data are instead statistically consistent with the\nfollowing two possible scenarios. First, that short/hard GRBs are a\nsuperposition of compact-star-merger origin (Type I) GRBs and a population of\nGRBs that track the star formation history, which are probably related to the\ndeaths of massive stars (Type II GRBs). Sec- ond, the entire short/hard GRB\npopulation is consistent with a typical delay of 2 Gyr with respect to the star\nformation history with modest scatter. This may point towards a different Type\nI progenitor than the traditional compact star merger models. \n\n"}

The imposed \"stirring\" crudely approximates the effects of\ngalactic wakes, waves generated by galaxies moving through the intracluster\nmedium (ICM), and/or turbulence produced by a central active galactic nucleus.\nThe simulated clusters exhibit a strong bimodality. Modest levels of\nturbulence, ~100 km/s (~10% of the sound speed), suppress the heat-flux-driven\nbuoyancy instability (HBI), resulting in an isotropically tangled magnetic\nfield and a quasi-stable, high entropy, thermal equilibrium with no cooling\ncatastrophe. Thermal conduction dominates the heating of the cluster core, but\nturbulent mixing is critical because it suppresses the HBI and (to a lesser\nextent) the thermal instability.

The time evolution follows from\nthe fact that each modelled galaxy approaches a steady state where the SFR\nfollows the (net) cold gas accretion rate. The key feature of the model is a\nhalo mass floor M_{min}~10^{11} below which accretion is quenched in order to\nsimultaneously account for the observed slopes of the SFR-Mass and\nTully-Fischer relations. The same successes cannot be achieved via a\nstar-formation threshold (or delay) nor by varying the SF efficiency or the\nfeedback efficiency. Combined with the mass ceiling for cold accretion due to\nvirial shock heating, the mass floor M_{min} explains galaxy \"downsizing\",\nwhere more massive galaxies formed earlier and over a shorter period of time.\nIt turns out that the model also accounts for the observed galactic baryon and\ngas fractions as a function of mass and time, and the cosmic SFR density from\nz~6 to z=0, which are all resulting from the mass floor M_{min}. The model\nhelps to understand that it is the cosmological decline of accretion rate that\ndrives the decrease of cosmic SFR density between z~2 and z=0 and the rise of\nthe cosmic SFR density allows us to put a constraint on our main parameter\nM_{min}~10^{11} solar masses.

We identify significant\nsystematic effects in this procedure that can artificially induce an additional\ndiffuse component with a morphology strikingly similar to the claimed gamma-ray\nhaze. To quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of the\nratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density,\nand of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models\nand simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM\ntemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by\napproximately 20%. Additionally, the synchrotron template tends to\nunder-estimate the IC emission at low energies (few GeV) and to over-estimate\nit at higher energies (tens of GeV) by potentially large factors that depend\ncrucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the Galaxy. The size of\nthe systematic effects we find are comparable to the size of the claimed \"Fermi\nhaze\" signal. We thus conclude that a detailed model for the galactic diffuse\nemission is necessary in order to conclusively assess the presence of a\ngamma-ray excess possibly associated to the WMAP haze morphology. \n\n"}

Relativistic electrons propagating\nthrough these sub-Larmor-scale magnetic fields radiate in the jitter regime, in\nwhich the anisotropy of the magnetic fields and the particle distribution have\na strong effect on the produced radiation.

Using cosmological simulations\nof the Santa Barbara cluster we detect radial bias in the velocity and magnetic\nfields. Such radial bias is consistent with either the inhomogeneous radial gas\nflows due to substructures or residual MTI-driven field rearangements that are\nexpected even in the presence of turbulence. Although disentangling the two\nscenarios is challenging, we do not detect excess bias in the runs that include\nanisotropic thermal conduction.

In our\nHOD modeling approach, we use the known HOD of LRGs and constrain the HOD of\nthe AGNs by a model fit to the CCF. For the first time, we are able to go\nbeyond quoting merely a `typical' AGN host halo mass, M_h, and model the full\ndistribution function of AGN host dark matter halos. In addition, we are able\nto determine the large-scale bias and the mean M_h more accurately. We explore\nthe behavior of three simple HOD models. Our first model (Model A) is a\ntruncated power-law HOD model in which all AGNs are satellites. With this\nmodel, we find an upper limit to the slope (\\alpha) of the AGN HOD that is far\nbelow unity. The other two models have a central component, which has a step\nfunction form, where the HOD is constant above a minimum mass, without (Model\nB) or with (Model C) an upper mass cutoff, in addition to the truncated\npower-law satellite component, similar to the HOD that is found for galaxies.\nIn these two models we find the upper limits of \\alpha < 0.95 and \\alpha < 0.84\nfor Model B and C respectively. Our analysis suggests that the satellite AGN\noccupation increases slower than, or may even decrease with, M_h, in contrast\nto the satellite's HODs of luminosity-threshold samples of galaxies, which, in\ncontrast, grow approximately as \\propto M_h^\\alpha with \\alpha\\approx 1.

The hard X-ray spectra of\nSeyferts as well as of Galactic stellar-mass black holes (GBHs) are well\nrepresented by thermal Comptonization, but the origin of the seed photons is\nless certain. The MeV tails observed in GBHs provide evidence in favour of\nnon-thermal electron tails and it is possible that such electrons are also\npresent in the X-ray emitting regions of AGNs. Using simulations with the\nkinetic code that self-consistently models electron and photon distributions,\nwe find that the power-law-like X-ray spectra in AGNs can be explained in terms\nof the synchrotron self-Compton radiation of hybrid thermal/non-thermal\nelectrons, similarly to the hard/low state of GBHs. Under a very broad range of\nparameters the model predicts a rather narrow distribution of photon spectral\nslopes consistent with that observed from LINERs and Seyferts at luminosities\nless than 3 per cent of the Eddington luminosity. The entire infrared to X-ray\nspectrum of these objects can be described in terms of our model, suggesting a\ntight correlation between the two energy bands. We show that the recently found\ncorrelation between slope and the Eddington ratio at higher luminosities can be\ndescribed by the increasing fraction of disc photons in the emitting region,\nwhich may be associated with the decreasing inner radius of the optically thick\naccretion disc. The increasing flux of soft photons is also responsible for the\ntransformation of the electron distribution from nearly thermal to almost\ncompletely non-thermal. The softer X-ray spectra observed in narrow-line\nSeyfert galaxies may correspond to non-thermal Comptonization of the disc\nphotons, predicting that no cutoff should be observed up to MeV energies in\nthese sources, similarly to the soft-state GBHs. \n\n"}

One possible reason is that GRBs and blazars have,\nmore or less, similar intrinsic synchrotron luminosities and both of them are\nstrongly enhanced by the beaming effect.

Classical bulges are thought to form by\ngalactic merger with bursty star formation, whereas pseudobulges are suggested\nto form by secular evolution due to spiral arms and a barred structure\nfunneling gas into the galactic centre. Noguchi (1998,1999) suggested another\nbulge formation scenario, `clump-origin bulge'. He demonstrated using a\nnumerical simulation that a galactic disc suffers dynamical instability to form\nclumpy structures in the early stage of disc formation since the premature disc\nis expected to be highly gas-rich, then the clumps are sucked into the galactic\ncentre by dynamical friction and merge into a single bulge at the centre. This\nbulge formation scenario, which is expected to happen only at the\nhigh-redshift, is different from the galactic merger and the secular evolution.\nTherefore, clump-origin bulges may have their own unique properties.

In this model, gravitino dark matter could\nbe detectable through the emission of a monochromatic gamma ray in a two-body\ndecay.\n  We study the prospects of the Fermi-LAT telescope to detect such\nmonochromatic lines in 5 years of observations of the most massive nearby\nextragalactic objects.\n  The dark matter halo around the Virgo galaxy cluster is selected as a\nreference case, since it is associated to a particularly high signal-to-noise\nratio and is located in a region scarcely affected by the astrophysical diffuse\nemission from the galactic plane.\n  The simulation of both signal and background gamma-ray events is carried out\nwith the Fermi Science Tools, and the dark matter distribution around Virgo is\ntaken from a N-body simulation of the nearby extragalactic Universe, with\nconstrained initial conditions provided by the CLUES project.\n  We find that a gravitino with a mass range of 0.6 to 2 GeV, and with a\nlifetime range of about 3x10^27 to 2x10^28 s would be detectable by the\nFermi-LAT with a signal-to-noise ratio larger than 3.

These calculations are done numerically using high-resolution\nrelativistic hydrodynamical afterglow blast wave simulations which include the\ntwo-dimensional dynamical features of expanding and decelerating afterglow\nblast waves. Any light curve can then be generated by applying scaling\nrelations to the baseline calculations.\n  As a result, it is now possible to fully fit for the shape of the jet break,\ne.g. at early time X-ray and optical frequencies.

In this work we employ high\nresolution cosmological hydro-dynamical simulations to study the effects of\ndissipative processes on the inner distribution of dark matter in Milky-Way\nlike objects (M~1e12 Msun).

Within the present status of this model, however, the model cannot\ndescribe the launch of a self-confined bipolar jet from the vicinity of disk's\ninner edge, although it allows the existence of a thermal wind widely\ndistributed over the disk surfaces. This is because the electric field (and\nhence the Poynting flux) vanishes everywhere in the disk, whereas such a jet in\na globally ordered magnetic field is most likely to be accelerated\nelectrodynamically. We show in the present paper that this defect can be\novercome naturally if we reformulate the problem so as to admit a\nquasi-stationary change of the magnetic field (and hence the appearance of a\nnon-irrotational electric field), and also restore all the terms of order\nepsilon ~ (v_r/v_{varphi})^2 < 1 (where v_r and v_{varphi} denote radial and\nazimuthal components, respectively, of the fluid velocity) which have been\nneglected altogether in the previous treatments.

The new solution predicts the\nappearance of a localized Poynting flux in a region near the disk inner edge,\nsuggesting strongly that a jet is launched from this region. Another\ninteresting prediction is the appearance of a rapid change of the magnetic\nfield also localized to this region. \n\n"}

For typical wind and jet velocities, filling\nfactors of about > 0.1 are already enough for the wind to be considered as\nclumpy. An inhomogeneous wind makes the jet more unstable when crossing the\nsystem. Kinetic luminosities of the order 1.e37 erg/s allow the jet to reach\nthe borders of a compact binary with an O star, as in the smooth wind case,\nalthough with a substantially higher degree of disruption.

We have separated the\nlong-term trend (an initial decline followed by a plateau) from the short-term\ndips in the Swift light-curve. Power spectra and Lomb-Scargle periodograms hint\nat possible periodic modulation. By using structure function analysis, we have\nshown that the dips were not random but occurred preferentially at time\nintervals ~ [2.3, 4.5, 9] x 10^5 s and their higher-order multiples. After the\nplateau epoch, dipping resumed at ~ [0.7, 1.4] x 10^6 s and their multiples. We\nhave also found that the X-ray spectrum became much softer during each of the\nearly dip, while the spectrum outside the dips became mildly harder in its\nlong-term evolution. We propose that the jet in the system undergoes precession\nand nutation, which causes the collimated core of the jet briefly to go out of\nour line of sight. The combined effects of precession and nutation provide a\nnatural explanation for the peculiar patterns of the dips.

An exception occurs for radial shells in the range 40/h-60/h Mpc.\nAngular averages reveal a dipole structure in the Hubble flow, whose amplitude\nchanges markedly over the range 32/h-62/h Mpc. Whereas the LG frame dipole is\ninitially constant and then decreases significantly, the CMB frame dipole\ninitially decreases but then increases. The map of angular Hubble flow\nvariation in the LG rest frame is found to coincide with that of the residual\nCMB temperature dipole, with correlation coefficient -0.92. These results are\ndifficult to reconcile with the standard kinematic interpretation of the motion\nof the Local Group in response to the clustering dipole, but are consistent\nwith a foreground non-kinematic anisotropy in the distance-redshift relation of\n0.5% on scales up to 65/h Mpc. Effectively, the differential expansion of space\nproduced by nearby nonlinear structures of local voids and denser walls and\nfilaments cannot be reduced to a local boost.

We derive a new limit for\nthe extra-galactic dark matter annihilation background of at least 20% of that\noriginating from the Galaxy for an integration angle of 0.1 deg. The number of\nclusters scales as a power law with their brightness, suggesting that stacking\nmay provide a significant improvement over a single target analysis. The mean\nangle containing 80% of the dark-matter signal for the sample is ~0.15 deg,\nindicating that instruments with this angular resolution or better would be\noptimal for a cluster annihilation search based on stacking. A detailed study\nbased on the Fermi-LAT performance and position-dependent background, suggests\nthat stacking may result in a factor ~2 improvement in sensitivity, depending\non the source selection criteria. Based on the expected performance of CTA, we\nfind no improvement with stacking, due to the requirement for pointed\nobservations.

Hints from Near Infrared Integral\n  Field Spectroscopy Abstract: In contrast to the predictions of the unified model, some X-ray unobscured\nSeyfert 2 galaxies have been discovered in the last decade. One of them, the\nstarburst/Seyfert composite galaxy IRAS 01072+4954 (z=0.0236), has a typical\nType~1 X-ray emission, while its optical spectrum resembles an HII galaxy and\nlacks the expected broad lines. We performed near-infrared integral-field\nobservations of this object with the aim to determine the nature of its nuclear\nemission and to find indications for the existence or absence of a broad-line\nregion. Several reasons have been proposed to explain such peculiar emission.\nWe studied the validity of such hypotheses, including the possibility for it to\nbe True-Seyfert~2. We found little obscuration towards the nucleus A_V = 2.5\nmag, and a nuclear star-formation rate Sigma_SFR < 11.6 Msun yr^{-1} kpc^{-2},\nwhich is below the average in Seyferts. Unresolved hot-dust emission with T ~\n1150 K seems to indicate the presence of a torus with its axis close to the\nline of sight. We found that IRAS 01072+4954 hosts a low mass black hole with\nan estimated mass of M_BH ~ 10^5 Msun and an upper limit of 2.5x10^6 Msun. Its\nbolometric luminosity is L_bol ~ 2.5x10^{42} erg/s, which yields a high\naccretion rate with an Eddington ratio ~ 0.2. If the relations found in more\nmassive systems also apply to this case, then IRAS 01072+4954 should show broad\nemission lines with FWHM_{broad} ~(400-600) km/s. Indeed, some indications for\nsuch narrow broad-line components are seen in our data, but the evidence is not\nyet conclusive. This source thus seems not to be a True-Seyfert 2, but an\nextreme case of a narrow line Seyfert 1, which, due to the faintness of the\nactive nucleus, does not have strong FeII emission in the optical. \n\n"}

In agreement\nwith significant previous work, we reiterate that the standard halo model is\ninsufficient to describe the non-Maxwellian velocity distribution of the Milky\nWay halo in our equilibrium halo-only and halo/galaxy models, and offer\nsuggestions for correcting for this discrepancy. More importantly, we emphasize\nthat the dark matter component of the leading tidal arm of the Sagittarius\ndwarf is significantly more extended than the stellar component of the arm,\nsince the dark matter and stellar streams are not necessarily coaxial and may\nbe offset by several kpc at the point at which they impact the Galactic disk.\nThis suggests that the dark matter component of the Sagittarius debris is\nlikely to have a non-negligible influence on dark matter detection experiments\neven when the stellar debris is centered several kpc from the solar\nneighborhood. Relative to models without an infalling Sagittarius dwarf, the\nSagittarius dark matter debris in our models induces an energy-dependent\nenhancement of direct search event rates of as much as ~20 - 45%, an\nenergy-dependent reduction in the amplitude of the annual modulation of the\nevent rate by as much as a factor of two, a shift in the phase of the annual\nmodulation by as much as ~20 days, and a shift in the recoil energy at which\nthe modulation reverses phase.

We present MHD simulations of cold front formation in the core\nof a galaxy cluster with anisotropic thermal conduction, exploring a parameter\nspace of conduction strengths parallel and perpendicular to the field lines.\nIncluding conduction has a strong effect on the temperature of the core and the\ncold fronts. Though magnetic field lines are draping parallel to the front\nsurfaces, the temperature jumps across the fronts are nevertheless reduced. The\nfield geometry is such that the cold gas below the front surfaces can be\nconnected to hotter regions outside via field lines along directions\nperpendicular to the plane of the sloshing motions and along sections of the\nfront which are not perfectly draped. This results in the heating of this gas\nbelow the front on a timescale of a Gyr, but the sharpness of the density and\ntemperature jumps may still be preserved. By modifying the density distribution\nbelow the front, conduction may indirectly aid in suppressing Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities. If conduction along the field lines is unsuppressed, we find\nthat the characteristic sharp jumps in X-ray emission seen in observations of\nclusters do not form.

Under the canonical assumption that\nthe spectrum of CRs is a power-law in momentum and that the spectrum of\nsecondaries is stationary, we find that the combination of the steep spectrum\nof CRs necessary to explain the spectrum of the halo and their very broad\nspatial distribution (and large energy density) result in a gamma-ray emission\nin excess of present limits, unless the cluster magnetic field is sufficiently\nlarge.

As an illustration of\nthe method we investigate massive vector (Proca) perturbations in the Kerr\nmetric, which do not appear to be separable in the standard Teukolsky\nformalism. Working in a perturbative scheme, we discuss two important effects\ninduced by rotation: a Zeeman-like shift of nonaxisymmetric quasinormal modes\nand bound states with different azimuthal number m, and the coupling between\naxial and polar modes with different multipolar index l. We explicitly compute\nthe perturbation equations up to second order in rotation, but in principle the\nmethod can be extended to any order. Working at first order in rotation we show\nthat polar and axial Proca modes can be computed by solving two decoupled sets\nof equations, and we derive a single master equation describing axial\nperturbations of spin s=0 and s=+-1. By extending the calculation to second\norder we can study the superradiant regime of Proca perturbations in a\nself-consistent way. For the first time we show that Proca fields around Kerr\nblack holes exhibit a superradiant instability, which is significantly stronger\nthan for massive scalar fields. Because of this instability, astrophysical\nobservations of spinning black holes provide the tightest upper limit on the\nmass of the photon: mv<4x10^-20 eV under our most conservative assumptions.\nSpin measurements for the largest black holes could reduce this bound to\nmv<10^-22 eV or lower. \n\n"}

For high but\nsub-critical eccentricities, all the stellar mass is accreted onto the black\nhole in a finite time, causing a significant deviation from the canonical\n$t^{-5/3}$ mass fallback rate. When a star is on a moderately eccentric orbit\nand its pericenter distance is deeply inside the tidal disruption radius, there\ncan be several orbit crossings of the debris streams due to relativistic\nprecession. This dissipates orbital energy in shocks, allowing for rapid\ncircularization of the debris streams and formation of an accretion disk. The\nresultant accretion rate greatly exceeds the Eddington rate and differs\nstrongly from the canonical rate of $t^{-5/3}$.

It is shown that the observed glitch\nsize distributions cannot be reproduced if superfluid vortices unpin\nindependently via a Poisson process; the central limit theorem yields a narrow\nGaussian for the size distribution, instead of the broad, power-law tail\nobserved. This conclusion is not altered fundamentally when a range of pinning\npotentials is included, which leads to excavation of the potential distribution\nof occupied sites, vortex accumulation at strong pinning sites, and hence the\noccasional, abnormally large glitch. Knock-on processes are therefore needed to\nmake the unpinning rate of a vortex conditional on the pinning state of its\nnear and/or remote neighbours, so that the Gaussian size distributions\nresulting generically from the central limit theorem are avoided. At least two\nknock-on processes, nearest- neighbour proximity knock-on and remote acoustic\nknock-on, are clearly evident in the Gross-Pitaevskii simulation output. It is\nshown that scale-invariant (i.e. power-law) vortex avalanches occur when\nknock-on is included, provided that two specific relations hold between the\ntemperature and spin-down torque. This fine tuning is unlikely in an\nastronomical setting, leaving the overall problem partly unsolved.

In this\nLetter, we compute the cross-correlation angular power spectrum of cosmic shear\nand gamma-rays produced by the annihilation/decay of Weakly Interacting Massive\nParticle (WIMP) DM, as well as from astrophysical sources. We show that this\nobservable provides novel information on the composition of the Extra-galactic\nGamma-ray Background (EGB), since the amplitude and shape of the\ncross-correlation signal strongly depends on which class of source is\nresponsible for the gamma-ray emission. If the DM contribution to the EGB is\nsignificant (at least in a definite energy range), although compatible with\ncurrent observational bounds, its strong correlation with the cosmic shear\nmakes such signal potentially detectable by combining Fermi-LAT data with\nforthcoming galaxy surveys, like Dark Energy Survey and Euclid. At the same\ntime, the same signal would demonstrate that the weak lensing observables are\nindeed due to particle DM matter and not to possible modifications of General\nRelativity. \n\n"}

The mixed pulsar-stellar wind expands with a\nspecific velocity determined by the pulsar power and the mass loss rate of the\ncompanion star. Relativistic particles, either from the inner pulsar\nmagnetosphere and/or accelerated at the shocks between stellar and pulsar\nwinds, are expected to be captured and isotropized in the reference frame of\nthe mixed wind. Therefore, they can efficiently comptonize stellar radiation\nproducing GeV-TeV $\\gamma$-rays in the inverse Compton process.

This allowed us\nto perform a 250 ks long X-ray observation with Suzaku in 2012 February,\ncovering most of its orbit, including the eclipse egress.

The\nscattered X-ray emission during the X-ray eclipse is used to directly probe the\ndensity of the companion wind at the orbital separation, resulting in 7E-14\ng/cm3, which translates into a ratio Mdot_w/v_terminal = 7E-17 solar masses/km\nof the wind mass loss rate to the wind terminal velocity.

VERITAS consists of an ar- ray of four\n12m-diameter atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes that has been fully operational\nsince September 2007. VERITAS has detected many as- trophysical sources of VHE\ngamma rays, including at least 17 VHE sources that are likely Galactic in\norigin. This paper describes some of the Galactic source highlights from\nVERITAS with an emphasis on those aspects that relate to the origin of cosmic\nrays. Specifically, topics include the VERITAS discovery of VHE emission from\nthe Tycho and CTA 1 supernova remnants, the identification of HESS J0632+057 as\na new VHE binary, a substantially improved view of the gamma-ray emission in\nthe Cygnus OB1 region, and the recent remarkable discovery of VHE emission from\nthe Crab pulsar.

If the\ntime lag is fairly short, the interaction of the supernova ejecta with the\ntails could lead to detectable shock emission at radio, optical, and/or x-ray\nwavelengths. At somewhat later times, the tails produce relatively broad NaID\nabsorption lines with velocity widths of order the white dwarf escape speed\n($\\sim 1000$ \\kms).

As I show\nin this work, there are several key sources of uncertainty in our ability to\nestimate the dark matter annihilation from collapsed structures, including: the\ndensity profile of dark matter halos; the small-scale cut-off in the dark\nmatter halo mass function; the redshift-dependent mass-concentration relation\nfor small halos; and the particle-velocity dependence of the dark matter\nannihilation process. Varying assumptions about these quantities can result in\nannihilation power predictions that differ by several orders of magnitude.\nThese uncertainties must be resolved, through a combination of observation and\nmodeling, before robust estimations of the cosmological annihilation signal can\nbe made. \n\n"}

Our model is based on the stable clustering\nhypothesis in phase space, the spherical collapse model, and tidal disruption\nof substructures, which is calibrated against the Aquarius simulations. Using\nthis model, we can predict the behaviour of $P^2SAD$ in the numerically\nunresolved regime, down to the decoupling mass limit of generic WIMP models.\nThis prediction can be used to estimate signals sensitive to the small scale\nstructure of dark matter. For example, the dark matter annihilation rate can be\nestimated for arbitrary velocity-dependent cross sections in a convenient way\nusing a limit of $P^2SAD$ to zero separation in physical space.

The AGN SED shows a two-humped structure\ntypical of blazars and gamma-ray-loud NLSy1 galaxies, with the high-energy\n(inverse-Compton) emission dominating by more than an order of magnitude over\nthe low-energy (synchrotron) emission during gamma-ray flares. The difference\nbetween the two SED humps is smaller during the low-activity state. Fermi\nobservations reveal a strong correlation between the gamma-ray flux and\nspectral index, with the hardest spectrum observed during the brightest\ngamma-ray state. If the gamma-ray flux is a mixture of synchrotron self-Compton\n(SSC) and external Compton (EC) emission, the observed GeV spectral variability\nmay result from varying relative contributions of these two emission\ncomponents. \n\n"}

We\nestimate the possible growth rates and duty cycles of these episodes, both\nassuming slim accretion disk solutions, and adopting the results of recent\nnumerical simulations. The angular momentum of gas joining the accretion disk\ndetermines the length of the accretion episodes, and the final mass a MBH can\nreach. The latter can be related to the gas velocity dispersion, and in\ngalaxies with low-angular momentum gas the MBH can get to a higher mass. When\nthe host galaxy is able to sustain inflow rates at 1-100 msunyr, replenishing\nand circulation lead to a sequence of short (~1e4-1e7 years), heavily obscured\naccretion episodes that increase the growth rates, with respect to an\nEddington-limited case, by several orders of magnitude. Our model predicts that\nthe ratio of MBH accretion rate to star formation rate is 1e2 or higher,\nleading, at early epochs, to a ratio of MBH to stellar mass higher than the\n\"canonical\" value of ~1e-3, in agreement with current observations.

Abstract: It is commonly thought that AGN feedback can break the self-similar scaling\nrelations of galaxies, groups, and clusters. Using high-resolution 3D\nhydrodynamic simulations, we isolate the impact of AGN feedback on the $L_{\\rm\nx}-T_{\\rm x} $ relation, testing the two archetypal and common regimes,\nself-regulated mechanical feedback and a quasar thermal blast. We find that AGN\nfeedback has severe difficulty in breaking the relation in a consistent way.\nThe similarity breaking is directly linked to the gas evacuation within\n$R_{500}$, while the central cooling times are inversely proportional to the\ncore density. Breaking self-similarity implies thus breaking the cool core,\nmorphing all systems to non-cool-core objects, which is in clear contradiction\nwith the observed data populated by several cool-core systems. Self-regulated\nfeedback, which quenches cooling flows and preserves cool cores, prevents the\ndramatic evacuation and similarity breaking at any scale; the relation scatter\nis also limited. The impulsive thermal blast can break the core-included\n$L_{\\rm x}-T_{\\rm x}$ at $T_{500} < 1$ keV, but substantially empties and\noverheats the halo, generating a perennial non-cool-core group, as experienced\nby cosmological simulations.

A search for (active) SMBH\nbinaries (SMBHBs) at the centers of the merger remnants is currently ongoing.\nPerhaps the greatest challenge is to identify the inactive SMBHBs, which might\nbe the most abundant, but are also the most difficult to identify. Liu et al.\npredicted characteristic drops in the light curves of tidal disruption events\n(TDEs), caused by the presence of a secondary SMBH. Here, we apply that model\nto the light curve of the optically inactive galaxy SDSS J120136.02+300305.5,\nwhich was identified as a candidate TDE with XMM-Newton. We show that the deep\ndips in its evolving X-ray light curve can be well explained by the presence of\na SMBHB at its core. A SMBHB model with a mass of the primary of M_BH = 10^7\nM_sun, a mass ratio q=0.08, and a semimajor axis a_b = 0.6 mpc is in good\nagreement with the observations. Given that primary mass, introducing an\norbital eccentricity is needed, with e_b = 0.3. Alternatively, a lower mass\nprimary of M_BH = 10^6 M_sun in a circular orbit fits the light curve well.\nTight binaries like this one, which have already overcome the \"final parsec\nproblem,\" are prime sources of gravitational wave radiation once the two SMBHs\ncoalesce. Future transient surveys, which will detect TDEs in large numbers,\nwill place tight constraints on the SMBHB fraction in otherwise non-active\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

These results in the radio bands strongly suggest that\nthe VHE gamma-ray activity in 2012 originates in the jet base within 0.03pc or\n56 Schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole.

The cluster is a highly massive, strong cool core\ncluster. We find that the ICM entropy around the quasar is significantly lower\nthan that of other similarly massive strong cool core clusters within the\ncentral 80 kpc, and that the entropy lies significantly below the extrapolated\nbaseline entropy profile from hierarchical structure formation. By comparing\nthe scaled temperature profile with those of other strong cool core clusters of\nsimilar total mass, we see that the entropy deficiency is due to the central\ntemperature being significantly lower. This suggests that the presence of the\nquasar in the core of H1821+643 has had a dramatic cooling effect on the\nintracluster medium around it.

Our main result\nis that rotation introduces a dependence of the line morphology with viewing\nangle and rotational velocity. Observations with a line of sight parallel to\nthe rotation axis yield line morphologies similar to the static case. For lines\nof sight perpendicular to the rotation axis both the intensity at the line\ncenter and the line width increase with rotational velocity. Along the same\nline of sight, the line becomes single peaked at rotational velocities close to\nhalf the line width in the static case. Notably, we find that rotation does not\ninduce any spatial anisotropy in the integrated line flux, the escape fraction\nor the average number of scatterings. This is because Lyman {\\alpha} scattering\nthrough a rotating solid-body proceeds identical as in the static case. The\nonly difference is the doppler shift from the different regions in the sphere\nthat move with respect to the observer. This allows us to derive an analytic\napproximation for the viewing-angle dependence of the emerging spectrum, as a\nfunction of rotational velocity. \n\n"}

{"id": "1408.4940", "contents": "Title: Radiation Pressure Confinement -- III. The origin of the broad\n  ionization distribution in AGN outflows Abstract: The winds of ionized gas driven by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can be\nstudied through absorption lines in their X-ray spectra. A recurring feature of\nthese outflows is their broad ionization distribution, including essentially\nall ionization levels (e.g., Fe^0+ to Fe^25+). This characteristic feature can\nbe quantified with the absorption measure distribution (AMD), defined as the\ndistribution of column density with ionization parameter |dN / dlog xi|.\nObserved AMDs extend over 0.1 < xi < 10^4 (cgs), and are remarkably similar in\ndifferent objects. Power-law fits (|dN /dlog xi| ~ N_1 xi^a) yield N_1 =\n3x10^{21} cm^-2 +- 0.4 dex and a = 0 -- 0.4. What is the source of this broad\nionization distribution, and what sets the small range of observed $N_1$ and\n$a$? A common interpretation is a multiphase outflow, with a wide range of gas\ndensities in a uniform gas pressure medium. However, the incident radiation\npressure leads to a gas pressure gradient in the photoionized gas, and\ntherefore to a broad range of ionization states within a single slab. We show\nthat this compression of the gas by the radiation pressure leads to an AMD with\n|dN / dlog xi| = 8x10^21 xi^0.03 cm^-2, remarkably similar to that observed.\nThe calculated values of $N_1$ and $a$ depend weakly on the gas metallicity,\nthe ionizing spectral slope, the distance from the nucleus, the ambient\ndensity, and the total absorber column. Thus, radiation pressure compression\n(RPC) of the photoionized gas provides a natural explanation for the observed\nAMD. RPC predicts that the gas pressure increases with decreasing ionization,\nwhich can be used to test the validity of RPC in ionized AGN outflows. \n\n"}

To date,\nfew high-quality spectra of this kind exist. Here we report on the late-time\noptical and infrared spectra of the SNe~Ia-CSM 2012ca and 2013dn. These SNe\nIa-CSM spectra exhibit low [Fe III]/[Fe II] ratios and strong [Ca II] at late\nepochs. Such characteristics are reminiscent of the super-Chandrasekhar-mass\n(SC) candidate SN 2009dc, for which these features suggested a low-ionisation\nstate due to high densities, although the broad Fe features admittedly show\nsimilarities to the blue \"quasi-continuum\" observed in some core-collapse SNe\nIbn and IIn.

The observed cores of clusters (and groups) show instead a strong\ndeficit of soft X-ray emission: $dL_{\\rm x}/dT \\propto (T/T_{\\rm\nhot})^{\\alpha=2\\pm1}$. Using 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we show that such\ndeficit arises from the tight self-regulation between thermal instability\ncondensation and AGN outflow injection: condensing clouds boost the AGN\noutflows, which quench cooling as they thermalize through the core. The\nresultant average distribution slope is $\\alpha \\simeq 2$, oscillating within\nthe observed $1<\\alpha<3$. In the absence of thermal instability, the X-ray\nspectrum remains isothermal ($\\alpha > 8$), while unopposed cooling drives a\ntoo shallow slope, $\\alpha<1$.

We here estimate\nthe contribution from clusters to the diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino\nbackgrounds.

This is a\ncrucial parameter since the observed radio counts due to synchrotron emission\nby secondary electrons need to be respected. For a choice of parameters\nrespecting all current constraints, and assuming a spectral index of -2, we\nfind that hadronic interactions in clusters contribute by less than 10% to the\nextragalactic gamma-ray background observed by Fermi and to the IceCube flux.\nThey account for less than 1% for spectral indices <=-2.

Red timing noise - the stochastic wandering of\npulse arrival times with a red spectrum - is prevalent in slow-spinning pulsars\nand has been identified in many millisecond pulsars. Phenomenological models of\ntiming noise, such as from superfluid turbulence, suggest that the timing noise\nspectrum plateaus below some critical frequency, $f_c$, potentially aiding the\nhunt for gravitational waves. We examine this effect for individual pulsars by\ncalculating minimum observation times, $T_{\\rm min}(f_c)$, over which the\ngravitational wave signal becomes larger than the timing noise plateau. We do\nthis in two ways: 1) in a model-independent manner, and 2) by using the\nsuperfluid turbulence model for timing noise as an example to illustrate how\nneutron star parameters can be constrained.

We find a clear connection between the\ngamma-ray and radio emission, such that every period of gamma-ray activity is\naccompanied by the flaring of the mm-VLBI core and subsequent ejection of a new\nsuperluminal component. However, not all ejections of components are associated\nwith gamma-ray events detectable by Fermi. Clear gamma-ray detections are\nobtained only when components are moving in a direction closer to our line of\nsight.This suggests that the observed gamma-ray emission depends not only on\nthe interaction of moving components with the mm-VLBI core, but also on their\norientation with respect to the observer.

Using analytical models of\nstructure formation and dark matter halo properties, we compute the gamma-ray\nflux distribution due to annihilations in extragalactic dark matter halos, as\nit would be observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope. Combining the central\nlimit theorem and Monte Carlo sampling, we show that the flux distribution\ntakes the form of a narrow Gaussian of `diffuse' light, with an `unresolved\npoint source' power-law tail as a result of bright halos. We argue that this\nbackground due to dark matter constitutes an irreducible and significant\nbackground component for point-source annihilation searches with galaxy\nclusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies, modifying the predicted signal-to-noise\nratio. A study of astrophysical backgrounds to this signal reveals that the\nshape of the total gamma-ray flux distribution is very sensitive to the\ncontribution of a dark matter component, allowing us to forecast promising\none-point upper limits on the annihilation cross section.

This is especially invoked for Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies,\nwhere an extremely broad iron line seen in episodes of low X-ray flux can both\nbe explained by extremely strong relativistic effects as the source approaches\nthe black hole horizon.

However, the source must also be large enough to intercept sufficient\nseed photons from the disk to make the hard X-ray Compton continuum which\nproduces the observed iron line/reflected spectrum. We use a fully relativistic\nray tracing code to show that this implies that the source must be\nsubstantially larger than 1Rg in 1H0707-495 if the disk is the source of seed\nphotons.

How neutron star magnetospheric activities affect these two\nphenomena are investigated by using the wind braking model of pulsars.

Fluctuations\nare unavoidable for a physical neutron star magnetosphere. Young pulsars have\nmeaningful braking indices, while old pulsars' and magnetars' fluctuation item\ndominates their frequency second derivatives. It can explain both the braking\nindex and frequency second derivative of pulsars uniformly. The braking indices\nof eight pulsars are the combined effect of magnetic dipole radiation and\nparticle wind. During the life time of a pulsar, its braking index will evolve\nfrom three to one.

Here, we use continuous\ngamma-ray searches from Fermi-LAT observations of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies and from H.E.S.S. observations of the Galactic Halo to extend the\nlimits on the annihilation cross sections into monochromatic photons to dark\nmatter masses well beyond $500$ GeV (Fermi-LAT) and $20$ TeV (H.E.S.S.). In\nthis large mass regime, our results provide the first constraints on\n$\\gamma$-ray lines from dark matter annihilation. \n\n"}

The flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C279 is\none of the most prominent examples showing this behaviour. Our goal is to study\nthe observed EVPA rotations and to distinguish between a stochastic and a\ndeterministic origin of the polarization variability. We have combined multiple\ndata sets of R-band photometry and optical polarimetry measurements of 3C279,\nyielding exceptionally well-sampled flux density and polarization curves that\ncover a period of 2008-2012. Several large EVPA rotations are identified in the\ndata.

The\npolarization variation during the flaring state, especially the smooth approx.\n360 degrees rotation of the EVPA in mid-2011, is not consistent with the tested\nstochastic processes. We conclude that during the two different optical flux\nstates, two different processes govern the polarization variation, possibly a\nstochastic process during the low-brightness state and a deterministic process\nduring the flaring activity. \n\n"}

Previously, these models have utilized\nthe simplicity of the Schwarzschild metric which has the restriction that the\nmagnetic flux is magnetic \"hair\" that must be shed before final collapse. But,\nneutron stars have angular momentum and charge and a fully relativistic Kerr\nNewman solution exists in which $B$ has its source inside of the event horizon.\nIn this letter, we consider the magnetic flux to be shed as a consequence of\nthe electric discharge of a metastable collapsed state of a Kerr Newman black\nhole.

This heating can be\nquasi-steady, powered by gradual (or frequent) crustal yielding to magnetic\nstresses. We show that it obeys a strong upper limit. As long as the crustal\nstresses are fostered by the field evolution in the core or Hall drift in the\ncrust, mechanical heating is insufficient to sustain persistent $L_s\\approx\n10^{35}$ erg/s. The surface luminosity is increased in an alternative scenario\nof mechanical deformations triggered by external magnetospheric flares.

Only extreme\nmagnetic configurations with crustal fields $B>10^{16}$ G varying on a 100\nmeter scale could provide $L_s\\approx 10^{35}$ erg/s.

The goal of this study is to aid the interpretation of spectroscopic\nsearches for binaries and help test one of the leading models of binary\naccretion flows in the literature: SBHB in a circumbinary disk. In this work we\npresent the methodology and a comparison of the preliminary model with the\ndata. We model SBHB accretion flows as a set of three accretion disks: two\nmini-disks that are gravitationally bound to the individual black holes and a\ncircumbinary disk. Given a physically motivated parameter space occupied by\nsub-parsec SBHBs, we calculate a synthetic database of nearly 15 million broad\noptical emission line profiles and explore the dependence of the profile shapes\non characteristic properties of SBHBs. We find that the modeled profiles show\ndistinct statistical properties as a function of the semi-major axis, mass\nratio, eccentricity of the binary, and the degree of alignment of the triple\ndisk system. This suggests that the broad emission line profiles from SBHB\nsystems can in principle be used to infer the distribution of these parameters\nand as such merit further investigation. Calculated profiles are more\nmorphologically heterogeneous than the broad emission lines in observed SBHB\ncandidates and we discuss improved treatment of radiative transfer effects\nwhich will allow direct statistical comparison of the two groups. \n\n"}

Although cosmologically the model\nbehaves as CDM, they differ at small scales: SFDM naturally predicts fewer\nsatellite haloes, cores in dwarf galaxies and the formation of massive galaxies\nat high redshifts. The ground state (or BEC) solution at zero temperature\nsuffices to describe low-mass galaxies but fails for larger systems. A possible\nsolution is adding finite-temperature corrections to the SF potential which\nallows combinations of excited states. In this work, we test the\nfinite-temperature multistate SFDM solution at galaxy cluster scales and\ncompare our results with the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and BEC profiles. We\nachieve this by fitting the mass distribution of 13 \\textit{Chandra} X-ray\nclusters of galaxies, excluding the region of the brightest cluster galaxy.

We demonstrate that this bound results\nin limits to the density-dependent symmetry energy, which is the difference\nbetween the energies of symmetric nuclear matter and PNM. In particular, this\nbound leads to a lower limit to the volume symmetry energy parameter $S_0$. In\naddition, for assumed values of $S_0$ above this minimum, this bound implies\nboth upper and lower limits to the symmetry energy slope parameter $L$, which\ndescribes the lowest-order density dependence of the symmetry energy. A lower\nbound on the neutron-matter incompressibility is also obtained.

Such events would be\nobservationally indistinguishable from neutral current deep-inelastic\nscattering events due to neutrinos. Consequently, one reason for deviations,\nbreaks or excesses in the expected astrophysical power-law neutrino spectrum\ncould be the flux of such a particle. Motivated by features in the recent\n1347-day IceCube high energy starting event data (HESE), we focus on particular\nboosted dark matter ($\\chi$) related realizations of this premise. Here, $\\chi$\nis assumed to be much lighter than, and the result of, the slow decay of a\nmassive scalar ($\\phi$) which constitutes a major fraction of the Universe's\ndark matter.

For\nsetting up the Local and Loop I superbubble, we took into account the time\nsequence and locations of the generating core-collapse supernova explosions,\nwhich were derived from the mass spectrum of the perished members of certain\nstellar moving groups.

The inconsistency suggests that the free escape boundary adopted\nin the escaping model is not a good approximation, which challenges our\nunderstanding of cosmic ray (CR) escaping in SNRs. In addition, we show that\nambient CRs is potentially important for the $\\gamma$-ray emission of\nilluminated MCs external to W28 and W44. In direct interaction scenario, the\nmodel involving re-acceleration of pre-existing CRs and adiabatic compression\nis able to explain the emission from most SNRs. The dispersion shown in the TeV\ndata is naturally explained by different acceleration time of CR particles in\nSNRs. Re-acceleration of pre-existing CRs suggests a transition of seed\nparticles, which is from thermal injected seed particle in young SNRs to\nambient CRs in old SNRs.

The pairs are produced in the\nabsorption of gamma rays in the intergalactic medium and subsequently\nup-scatter photons of background radiation fields to gamma-ray energies.\nMeasurement of pair halos could provide constraints on the strength and\ncoherence length scale of the IGMF. In a dedicated search, we find 21 extended\nsources and 16 sources not previously characterized as extended. Limits on the\nflux of the extended source components are used to derive constraints on the\nstrength of the IGMF using spectral and spatial templates derived from Monte\nCarlo simulations of electromagnetic cascades. This allows us to constrain the\nIGMF to be stronger than $3\\times10^{-16}\\,$G for a coherence length $\\lambda\n\\gtrsim 10\\,$kpc. \n\n"}

An important difference between these two cases\nis the nucleosynthetic yield, which is altered by the increased neutron excess\nin Chandrasekhar progenitors due to their pre-explosion simmering and high\ncentral density.\n  From comparison with theoretical nucleosynthesis yields, we show that the\nchemical composition of the most metal-rich star in the Ursa Minor dwarf\ngalaxy, COS 171, is dominated by nucleosynthesis from a low-metallicity,\nlow-mass, sub-Chandrasekhar mass SN Ia.

Since the mass fallback rate shows a different variability depending on\nthese orbital types, we can classify tidal disruption events (TDEs) into three\nmain categories: eccentric, parabolic, and hyperbolic TDEs. Respective TDEs are\ncharacterized by two critical values of the orbital eccentricity: the lower\ncritical eccentricity is the one below which the stars on eccentric orbits\ncause the finite, intense accretion, and the higher critical eccentricity above\nwhich the stars on hyperbolic orbits cause no accretion. Moreover, we find that\nthe parabolic TDEs are divided into three subclasses: precisely parabolic,\nmarginally eccentric, and marginally hyperbolic TDEs.

In this\npaper, we propose a new method to constrain the GW damping rate and thus the\nfluid shear viscosity. By defining the effective distance which incorporates\ndamping effects, we can transform the GW strain expression in a viscous\nUniverse into the same form as that in a perfect fluid. Therefore, the\nconstraints of the luminosity distances from the observed GW events by LIGO and\nVirgo can be directly applied to the effective distances in our formalism. We\nexploit the lognormal likelihoods for the available GW effective distances and\na Gaussian likelihood for the luminosity distance inferred from the\nelectromagnetic radiation observation of the binary neutron star merger event\nGW170817.

The observation that the power of radio sources increases with\nredshift, whereas the cosmological assembly of mass proceeds vice versa means\nthat radio sources have their strongest impact in the early Universe.

The current paradigm is that the corona is heated by\nnanoflares, which were originally proposed as miniature versions of the\nobserved solar flares. It was recently suggested that the nanoflares could be\nidentified as annihilation events of the nuggets from the Axion Quark Nugget\n(AQN) dark matter model. This model was invented as an explanation of the\nobserved ratio $\\Omega_{\\rm dark} \\sim \\Omega_{\\rm visible}$, based only on\ncosmological and particle physics considerations. In this new paradigm, the AQN\nparticles moving through the coronal plasma and annihilating with normal matter\ncan lead to the drastic change of temperatures seen in the Sun's Transition\nRegion (TR), and significantly contribute to the extreme ultraviolet (EUV)\nexcess of $10^{27}~{\\rm erg~s^{-1}}$.

This process can repeat several times and lead to\nsignificant mass growth. In this paper, we calculate the mass of the largest BH\nthat can be formed through repeated mergers of stellar seed BHs and determine\nhow its value depends on the physical properties of the host cluster. We adopt\nan analytical model in which the energy generated by the black hole binaries in\nthe cluster core is assumed to be regulated by the process of two-body\nrelaxation in the bulk of the system. This principle is used to compute the\nhardening rate of the binaries and to relate this to the time-dependent global\nproperties of the parent cluster. We demonstrate that in clusters with initial\nescape velocity $\\gtrsim 300\\rm km\\ s^{-1}$ in the core and density $\\gtrsim\n10^5\\ M_\\odot\\rm pc^{-3}$, repeated mergers lead to the formation of BHs in the\nmass range $100-10^5 \\,M_\\odot$, populating any upper mass gap created by\npair-instability supernovae.

The Fokker-Planck models include the effects of two-body\ngravitational encounters both between galaxies and between galaxies and common\nhalo particles. The effects of tidal mass stripping from the galaxies due to\nclose galaxy-galaxy encounters and accompanying dissipation of the orbital\nkinetic energies of the galaxies were also taken into account in the\nFokker-Planck models.

We find that\nsilicates are preferentially destroyed with respect to graphite, and the\nextinction curve becomes significantly flatter (hence implying less reddening),\nwith the characteristic bump at lambda 2175 A highly suppressed, due to the\ndestruction of the small graphite grains.

A likelihood analysis of the existing\nCosmic Microwave Background data shows that the presence of dark energy is not\nrequested, in the absence of further prior. This comes from the fact that there\nexist degeneracies among the various cosmological parameters constrained by the\nCosmic Microwave Background. We found that there is a degeneracy in a\ncombination of the Hubble parameter H_0 and of the dark energy equation of\nstate parameter w_Q, but that w_Q is not correlated with the primordial index n\nof scalar fluctuations and the baryon content Omega_b h^2.

This result\nderives from a comparison of several cluster samples to predictions in the\nframework of the currently favored $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and one possible\nexplanation for the discrepancy is that this cosmological model is not correct.\nIn this paper we discuss the incidence of giant arcs in the Red-Sequence\nCluster Survey (RCS), which again shows significant disagreement with\ntheoretical predictions. We briefly describe a total of eight strong lens\nsystems, seven of which are discussed here for the first time. Based on the\ndetails of these systems, in particular on the ratio of single to multiple arc\nsystems, we argue that it may be possible to explain this discrepancy in the\ncurrently favored cosmology, by modifying the details of the lenses themselves.\nSpecifically, the high incidence of multiple arc systems and their overall high\nredshift suggests that a sub-population of the global cluster population is\nresponsible for much of the observed lensing. The lack of lensing clusters at\n$z<0.64$ in the RCS indicates that a property associated with clusters at early\ntimes results in the boosted lensing cross sections; likely a combination of\nellipticity and elongation along the line of sight, substructure, and changes\nin the cluster mass profiles is responsible.

The logarithmic slope of the\nspherically-averaged density profile, as measured by beta=-dln(rho)/dln(r),\ndecreases monotonically towards the center and becomes shallower than\nisothermal (beta<2) inside a characteristic radius, r_{-2}. Although the\nfitting formula proposed by NFW provides a reasonably good approximation to the\ndensity and circular velocity profiles of individual halos, systematic\ndeviations from the best NFW fits are also noticeable. Inside r_{-2}, the\nprofile of simulated halos gets shallower with radius more gradually than\npredicted and, as a result, NFW fits tend to underestimate the dark matter\ndensity in these regions. This discrepancy has been interpreted as indicating a\nsteeply divergent cusp, but our results suggest a different interpretation.

This\nanalytic approach allows a clear handling and a transparent understanding of\nthe physics and the scaling of the problem. A comparison with the isothermal\ncase shows that in the core regions of a King sphere, dynamical friction\nproceeds at a different rate, and is sensitive to the total core radius.

Evolution to High\n  Redshift Abstract: In hierarchical cosmologies the evolution of galaxy clustering depends both\non cosmological quantities such as Omega and Lambda, which determine how dark\nmatter halos form and evolve, and on the physical processes - cooling, star\nformation and feedback - which drive the formation of galaxies within these\nmerging halos. In this paper, we combine dissipationless cosmological N-body\nsimulations and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation in order to study how\nthese two aspects interact. We focus on the differences in clustering predicted\nfor galaxies of differing luminosity, colour, morphology and star formation\nrate and on what these differences can teach us about the galaxy formation\nprocess. We show that a \"dip\" in the amplitude of galaxy correlations between\nz=0 and z=1 can be an important diagnostic. Such a dip occurs in low-density\nCDM models because structure forms early and dark matter halos of 10**12 solar\nmasses, containing galaxies with luminosities around L*, are unbiased tracers\nof the dark matter over this redshift range; their clustering amplitude then\nevolves similarly to that of the dark matter. At higher redshifts bright\ngalaxies become strongly biased and the clustering amplitude increases again.\nIn high density models, structure forms late and bias evolves more rapidly. As\na result, the clustering amplitude of L* galaxies remains constant from z=0 to\n1. The strength of these effects is sensitive to sample selection. The dip is\nweaker for galaxies with lower star formation rates, redder colours, higher\nluminosities and earlier morphological types. We explain why this is the case\nand how it is related to the variation with redshift of the abundance and and\nenvironment of the observed galaxies.

{"id": "hep-ph/9701423", "contents": "Title: Relic gravitational waves produced after preheating Abstract: We show that gravitational radiation is produced quite efficiently in\ninteractions of classical waves created by resonant decay of a coherently\noscillating field. For simple models of chaotic inflation in which the inflaton\ninteracts with another scalar field, we find that today's ratio of energy\ndensity in gravitational waves per octave to the critical density of the\nuniverse can be as large as 10^{-12} at the maximal wavelength of order 10^{5}\ncm. In the pure $\\lambda\\phi^4$ model, the maximal today's wavelength of\ngravitational waves produced by this mechanism is of order 10^6 cm, close to\nthe upper bound of operational LIGO and TIGA frequencies. The energy density of\nwaves in this model, though, is likely to be well below the sensitivity of LIGO\nor TIGA at such frequencies. We discuss possibility that in other inflationary\nmodels interaction of classical waves can lead to an even stronger\ngravitational radiation background. \n\n"}

We use a novel gauge, in which the full\nfive-dimensional problem is in principle solvable. In this gauge we derive the\nequations for scalar, vector and tensor perturbations. These equations are\nnecessary in order to calculate microwave background anisotropies in this\nparticular scenario. Throughout the paper, we draw attention to the influence\nof the bulk gravitons, which act as a source for the perturbations on the\nbrane.

Abstract: We study the gravitational collapse of compact objects in the Brane-World. We\nbegin by arguing that the regularity of the five-dimensional geodesics does not\nallow the energy-momentum tensor of matter on the brane to have (step-like)\ndiscontinuities, which are instead admitted in the four-dimensional General\nRelativistic case, and compact sources must therefore have an atmosphere. Under\nthe simplifying assumption that matter is a spherically symmetric cloud of dust\nwithout dissipation, we can find the conditions for which the collapsing star\ngenerically ``evaporates'' and approaches the Hawking behavior as the\n(apparent) horizon is being formed. Subsequently, the apparent horizon evolves\ninto the atmosphere and the back-reaction on the brane metric reduces the\nevaporation, which continues until the effective energy of the star vanishes.\nThis occurs at a finite radius, and the star afterwards re-expands and\n``anti-evaporates''. We clarify that the Israel junction conditions across the\nbrane (holographically related to the matter trace anomaly) and the projection\nof the Weyl tensor on the brane (holographically interpreted as the quantum\nback-reaction on the brane metric) contribute to the total energy as,\nrespectively, an ``anti-evaporation'' and an ``evaporation'' term. Concluding,\nwe comment on the possible effects of dissipation and obtain a new stringent\nbound for the brane tension. \n\n"}

We focus on the curvature-squared correction\nto the Einstein-Hilbert action, present in both heterotic and bosonic string\ntheory. The string theory low-energy effective action necessarily describes\nboth a graviton and a dilaton, and we concentrate on the Callan-Myers-Perry\nsolution in d-dimensions, describing stringy corrections to the Schwarzschild\ngeometry. We develop the perturbation theory for the higher-derivative\ncorrected action, along the guidelines of the Ishibashi-Kodama framework,\nfocusing on tensor type gravitational perturbations. The potential obtained\nallows us to address the perturbative stability of the black hole solution,\nwhere we prove stability in any dimension. The equation describing\ngravitational perturbations to the Callan-Myers-Perry geometry also allows for\na study of greybody factors and quasinormal frequencies. We address\ngravitational scattering at low frequencies, computing corrections arising from\nthe curvature-squared term in the stringy action. We find that the absorption\ncross-section receives \\alpha' corrections, even though it is still\nproportional to the area of the black hole event-horizon. We also suggest an\nexpression for the absorption cross-section which could be valid to all orders\nin \\alpha'. \n\n"}

Starting from high-precision nucleon-nucleon (NN)\ninteractions, wave functions of 7Be and 8B bound states are obtained in basis\nspaces up to 10 hbar Omega and used to calculate channel cluster form factors\n(overlap integrals) of the 8B ground state with 7Be+p. Due to the use of the\nharmonic oscillator (HO) basis, the overlap integrals have incorrect asymptotic\nproperties. We fix this problem in two alternative ways. First, by a\nWoods-Saxon (WS) potential solution fit to the interior of the NCSM overlap\nintegrals. Second, by a direct matching with the Whittaker function. The\ncorrected overlap integrals are then used for the 7Be(p,gamma)8B S-factor\ncalculation. We study the convergence of the S-factor with respect to the NCSM\nHO frequency and the model space size. Our S-factor results are in agreement\nwith recent direct measurement data. We also test the spectroscopic factors and\nthe corrected overlap integrals from the NCSM in describing the momentum\ndistributions in knockout reactions with 8B projectiles. A good agreement with\nthe available experimental data is also found, attesting the overall\nconsistency of the calculations. \n\n"}
