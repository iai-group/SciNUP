Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

This paper reports our first results in an ongoing\nstudy of B[e] supergiants, and provides a glimpse on the ionization of the most\nimportant elements in self-consistent numerical simulations.\n  Our newly developed 2D stellar atmosphere code, ASTAROTH, was used for the\nnumerical simulations. The code self-consistently solves for the continuum\nradiation, non-LTE level populations, and electron temperature in axi-symmetric\nstellar envelopes. Observed profiles were calculated by an auxiliary program\ndeveloped separately from ASTAROTH.\n  In all but one of our models, H remained fully ionized. Due to ionizations\nfrom excited states it is much more difficult to get a H neutral disk than\nindicated by previous analytical calculations. Near the poles, the ionization\nis high in all models, while helium recombined in the equatorial regions for\nall but our lowest mass-loss rate. Although the model parameters were not\nadjusted to provide fits to any particular star, the theoretical profiles show\nsome features seen in the profiles of R126. These include the partially\nresolved double peaked profile of Halpha, and the weak emission associated with\nthe UV C IV resonance line. \n\n"}

In Lamastra, Perola & Matt (2006) the\ngravitational effect of the SMBH on the molecular interstellar gas, in the\ncentral region of the host galaxy, was shown to predict an anti-correlation\nbetween f_{abs} and M_{BH}. The most recent findings on the distribution of the\nEddington ratio \\lambda=L_b/L_E as a function of M_{BH} and z are used to\nconvert that relationship into one between f_{abs} and both bolometric (L_b)\nand X-ray (L_X) luminosities at various values of z. The findings on\n\\lambda(M_{BH},z) are properly treated in order to ensure completeness in the\nprediction of f_{abs} above a certain luminosity, at values of z=0.1, 0.35, 0.7\nand >1. To verify the consequence of these findings alone, we adopted in a\nfirst istance a distribution of gas surface density \\Sigma, observed in a\nsample of local spiral galaxies, irrespective of the galaxy morphological type\nand z.

The effects of magnetic helicity fluxes are studied by comparing\nresults for the magnetic field with open and closed boundaries. Results:\nWithout shear no large-scale dynamos are found even if the ingredients\nnecessary for the alpha-effect (rotation and stratification) are present in the\nsystem. When uniform horizontal shear is added, a large-scale magnetic field\ndevelops, provided the boundaries are open. In this case the mean magnetic\nfield contains a significant fraction of the total field. For those runs where\nthe magnetic Reynolds number is between 60 and 250, small-scale dynamo is\nexpected to be excited, but the field distribution is found to be similar to\ncases with smaller magnetic Reynolds number where the small-scale dynamo is not\nexcited.

The small-scale\nclustering enhancement is smaller for lower mass subhalos, which also show a\ndeficit on scales just beyond the excess.

With\nthe diffusion approximation and linear dissipation rates, we study the cascade\nand damping of Alfv\\'en-cyclotron fluctuations in solar plasmas numerically.\nFor an isotropic case the steady-state turbulence spectra are nearly isotropic\nin the inertial range and can be fitted by a single power-law function with a\nspectral index of -3/2, similar to the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan phenomenology.\nBeyond the MHD regime the kinetic effects make the spectrum softer at higher\nwavenumbers. In the dissipation range the turbulence spectrum cuts off at the\nwavenumber, where the damping rate becomes comparable to the cascade rate, and\nthe cutoff wavenumber changes with the wave propagation direction.

Second, tidal heating can\nsignificantly inflate the radius when the orbit is being circularized, but this\neffect on the radius is short-lived thereafter.

We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before).

The CMB alone favors a 3% (positively\ncorrelated) isocurvature contribution in both the flat and curved cases. The\nnon-adiabatic contribution to the observed CMB temperature variance is 0 <\nalpha_T < 7% at 98% CL in the curved case. In the flat case, combining the CMB\nwith SN data artificially biases the result towards the pure adiabatic LCDM\nconcordance model, whereas in the curved case the favored level of\nnon-adiabaticity stays at 3% level with all combinations of data. However, the\nratio of Bayes factors, or Delta ln(evidence), is more than 5 points in favor\nof the flat adiabatic LCDM model, which suggests that the inclusion of the 5\nextra parameters of the curved isocurvature model is not supported by the\ncurrent data.

At present, groups contain most of the galaxies and a significant\nfraction of the overall baryon content of the universe. To explore the effects\nof BH feedback on groups, we analyse two high resolution cosmological hydro\nsimulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project.

With finite sized weakly clustered\ndistribution of tracers obtained from galaxy redshift surveys it is difficult\nto achieve this equality. Recently we have defined the scale of homogeneity to\nbe the scale above which the deviation of fractal dimension from the ambient\ndimension becomes smaller than the statistical dispersion.

The ability to\ndo this relies on the system being in a quasi-equilibrium state in the sense\nthat the eccentricities are constant on the usual secular timescale, and decay\non a timescale which is much longer than the age of the system. Since the\nequilibrium eccentricity is effectively a function only of observable system\nparameters and the unknown Love number of the short-period planet, the latter\ncan be determined with accurate measurements of the planet's eccentricity and\nradius. However, this analysis relies on the unlikely assumption that the\nsystem is coplanar. Here we generalize our recent analysis of this fixed-point\nphenomenon to mutually inclined systems and show that the fixed point of\ncoplanar systems is replaced by a limit cycle, with the average value of the\neccentricity decreasing and its amplitude of variation increasing with\nincreasing mutual inclination. This behaviour significantly reduces the ability\nto unambiguously determine the Love number of the short-period planet if the\nmutual inclination is higher than around 10^o. We show that for Q-values less\nthan 10^6, the HAT-P-13 system cannot have a mutual inclination between 54 and\n126^o because Kozai oscillations coupled with tidal dissipation would act to\nquickly move the inclination outside this range, and that the behaviour of\nretrograde systems is the mirror image of that for prograde systems.

Major\ndifferences of UCAC3 data as compared to UCAC2 include a completely new raw\ndata reduction with improved control over systematic errors in positions,\nsignificantly improved photometry, slightly deeper limiting magnitude, coverage\nof the north pole region, greater completeness by inclusion of double stars and\nweak detections. This of course leads to a catalog which is not as \"clean\" as\nUCAC2 and problem areas are outlined for the user in this paper. The positional\naccuracy of stars in UCAC3 is about 15 to 100 mas per coordinate, depending on\nmagnitude, while the errors in proper motions range from 1 to 10 mas/yr\ndepending on magnitude and observing history, with a significant improvement\nover UCAC2 achieved due to the re-reduced SPM data and inclusion of more\nastrograph plate data unavailable at the time of UCAC2. \n\n"}

Mass is the most important parameter\nof a planet and can only be measured by observing the motion of the star around\nthe planet-star center of mass. A single image of a planet, however, does not\nprovide evidence that the planet is Earth mass or that it is in a habitable\nzone orbit. The planet's orbit, however, can be measured either by imaging the\nplanet at multiple epochs or by measuring the position of the star at multiple\nepochs by space-based astrometry. The measurement of an exo-planet's orbit by\ndirect imaging is complicated by a number of factors: (1) the inner working\nangle (IWA); (2) the apparent brightness of the planet depending on the orbital\nphase; (3) confusion arising from the presence of multiple planets; and (4) the\nplanet-star contrast. In this paper we address the question: \"Can a prior\nastrometric mission that can identify which stars have Earthlike planets\nsignificantly improve the science yield of a mission to image exo-Earths?\" We\nfind that the Occulting Ozone Observatory (a small external occulter mission\nthat cannot measure spectra) could confirm the orbits of ~4 to ~5 times as many\nexo-Earths if an astrometric mission preceded it to identify which stars had\nsuch planets. We find that in the case of an internal coronagraph, a survey of\nthe nearest ~60 stars could be done with a telescope of half the size if an\nastrometric mission had first identified the presence of Earth-like planets in\nthe habitable zone and measured their orbital parameters. \n\n"}

This effect\nleads to a measurement bias, but more interestingly it provides a valuable\nsignal. The lensing signal can be extracted by correlating quasar magnitudes\nwith the flux power spectrum and with the flux decrement. These correlations\nwill be challenging to measure but their detection provides a direct measure of\nhow features in the Lyman-alpha forest trace the underlying mass density field.\nObserving them will test the fundamental hypothesis that fluctuations in the\nforest are predominantly driven by fluctuations in mass, rather than in the\nionizing background, helium reionization or winds.

One of\nthe key goals of BOSS is to measure the signature of baryon acoustic\noscillations in the distribution of Ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of a\nsample of ~150,000 z>2.2 quasars. Along with measuring the angular diameter\ndistance at z\\approx2.5, BOSS will provide the first direct measurement of the\nexpansion rate of the Universe at z > 2. One of the biggest challenges in\nachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over\n2.2 < z < 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. During the first year\nof the BOSS survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and tested\nto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in this\nredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. To achieve these surface densities,\nthe magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g <= 22.0 or r<=21.85.\nWhile detection of the BAO signature in the Ly-alpha absorption in quasar\nspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysical\nstudies do. We therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targets\ndeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%.

The clusters were divided into subsamples based on their X-ray\nmorphology or whether they host strong cool cores. We find that when the core\nregions are excluded, the most relaxed clusters (or those with the strongest\ncool cores) follow an LT relation with a slope that agrees well with simple\nself-similar expectations. This is supported by an analysis of the gas density\nprofiles of the systems, which shows self-similar behaviour of the gas profiles\nof the relaxed clusters outside the core regions. By comparing our data with\nclusters in the REXCESS sample, which extends to lower masses, we find evidence\nthat the self-similar behaviour of even the most relaxed clusters breaks at\naround 3.5keV. By contrast, the LT slopes of the subsamples of unrelaxed\nsystems (or those without strong cool cores) are significantly steeper than the\nself-similar model, with lower mass systems appearing less luminous and higher\nmass systems appearing more luminous than the self-similar relation.

Moreover, the model functions\noften have different dimensionality, e.g. the chromospheric distribution may\ndepend solely on solar altitude, while the coronal number density may be a\nfunction of both altitude and latitude. For applications which need to consider\nboth chromospheric and coronal models, the chromosphere-corona boundary, where\nthese functions have different values as well as gradients, can lead to\nnumerical problems. We encountered this problem in context of ray tracing\nthrough the corona at low radio frequencies, as a part of effort to prepare for\nthe analysis of solar images from new generation radio arrays like the\nMurchison Widefield Array (MWA), Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and Long\nWavelength Array (LWA). We have developed a solution to this problem by using a\n{\\em patch} function, a thin layer between the chromosphere and the corona\nwhich matches the values and gradients of the two regions at their respective\ninterfaces. We describe the method we have developed for defining this patch\nfunction to seamlessly \"stitch\" chromospheric and coronal electron density\ndistributions, and generalize the approach to work for any arbitrary\ndistributions of different dimensionality. We show that the complexity of the\npatch function is independent of the stitched functions dimensionalities. It\nalways has eight parameters (even four for univariate functions) and they may\nbe found without linear system solution for every point. The developed method\ncan potentially be useful for other applications. \n\n"}

Gamma-ray emission at theses energies is not expected in present\npulsar models. We find that the photon spectrum of pulsed emission between 100\nMeV and 400 GeV can be described by a broken power law, and that it is\nstatistically preferred over a power law with an exponential cut-off. In the\nVERITAS energy range the spectrum can be described with a simple power law with\na spectral index of -3.8 and a flux normalization at 150 GeV that is equivalent\nto 1% of the Crab Nebula gamma-ray flux. The detection of pulsed emission above\n100 GeV and the absence of an exponential cutoff rules out curvature radiation\nas the primary gamma-ray-producing mechanism. The pulse profile exhibits the\ncharacteristic two pulses of the Crab Pulsar at phases 0.0 and 0.4, albeit 2-3\ntimes narrower than below 10 GeV.

Abstract: GJ1214b is thought to be either a mini-Neptune with a thick, hydrogen-rich\natmosphere, or a planet with a composition dominated by water. In the case of a\nhydrogen-rich atmosphere, molecular absorption and scattering processes may\nresult in detectable radius variations as a function of wavelength. The aim of\nthis paper is to measure these variations. We have obtained observations of the\ntransit of GJ1214b in the r- and I-band with the INT, in the g, r, i and z\nbands with the 2.2 meter MPI/ESO telescope, in the Ks-band with the NOT, and in\nthe Kc-band with the WHT. By comparing the transit depth between the the\ndifferent bands, which is a measure for the planet-to-star size ratio, the\natmosphere is investigated. We do not detect clearly significant variations in\nthe planet-to-star size ratio as function of wavelength. Although the ratio at\nthe shortest measured wavelength, in g-band, is 2sigma larger than in the other\nbands. The uncertainties in the Ks and Kc bands are large, due to systematic\nfeatures in the light curves. The tentative increase in the planet-to-star size\nratio at the shortest wavelength could be a sign of an increase in the\neffective planet-size due to Rayleigh scattering, which would require GJ1214b\nto have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. If true, then the atmosphere has to have\nboth clouds, to suppress planet-size variations at red optical wavelengths, as\nwell as a sub-solar metallicity, to suppress strong molecular features in the\nnear- and mid-infrared. However, star spots, which are known to be present on\nthe hoststar's surface, can (partly) cancel out the expected variations in\nplanet-to-star size ratio, due to the lower surface temperature of the spots .\nA hypothetical spot-fraction of 10% would be able to raise the infrared points\nsufficiently with respect to the optical measurements to be inconsistent with a\nwater-dominated atmosphere.

Interaction with nuclei\nplays crucial role in the cosmological evolution of OHe and in the effects of\nthese dark atoms as nuclear interacting dark matter. Slowed down in terrestrial\nmatter OHe atoms cause negligible effects of nuclear recoil in underground\ndetectors, but can experience radiative capture by nuclei. Local concentration\nof OHe in the matter of detectors is rapidly adjusted to the incoming flux of\ncosmic OHe and possess annual modulation due to Earth's orbital motion around\nthe Sun. The potential of OHe-nucleus interaction is determined by polarization\nof OHe by the Coulomb and nuclear force of the approaching nucleus. Stark-like\neffect by the Coulomb force of nucleus makes this potential attractive at\nlarger distances, while change of polarization by the effect of nuclear force\ngives rise to a potential barrier, preventing merging of nucleus with helium\nshell of OHe atom. The existence of the corresponding shallow well beyond the\nnucleus can provide the conditions, at which nuclei in the matter of DAMA/NaI\nand DAMA/LIBRA detectors have a few keV binding energy with OHe, corresponding\nto a level in this well. Annual modulation of the radiative capture rate to\nthis level can reproduce DAMA results.

We find that the DLA and LLS cross sections are\nsignificantly reduced by the UVB, whereas the local stellar radiation does not\naffect them very much except in the low-mass halos. This is because clumpy\nhigh-density clouds near young star clusters effectively absorb most of the\nionizing photons from young stars.

Our goal is to detect the warm gas in the disk atmosphere well\nbeyond 10 AU from a central star in a nearby disk system of the Herbig Be star\nHD 100546. We measured the excitation temperature of the vibrational transition\nof CO at incremental radii of the disk from the central star up to 50 AU, using\nan adaptive optics system combined with the high-resolution infrared\nspectrograph CRIRES at the VLT. The observation successfully resolved the line\nemission with 0\".1 angular resolution, which is 10 AU at the distance of HD\n100546. Population diagrams were constructed at each location of the disk, and\ncompared with the models calculated taking into account the optical depth\neffect in LTE condition. The excitation temperature of CO is 400-500 K or\nhigher at 50 AU away from the star, where the blackbody temperature in\nequilibrium with the stellar radiation drops as low as 90 K.

If SLRs are homogenized in the gas of\ngalaxies, the high SSFRs of normal galaxies can partly explain the elevated\nabundance of SLRs like $^{60}$Fe and $^{26}$Al in the early Solar system.\nStarburst galaxies have much higher SSFRs still, and have enormous mean\nabundances of $^{26}$Al ($^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al ~ $10^{-3}$ for Solar metallicity\ngas).

The final starburst is\ndominated by in situ star formation, fueled by gas which flows inwards due to\nglobal torques. The resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation.\nThe gas is self gravitating, and forms massive (~10^10 M_sun) GMCs and\nsubsequent super-starclusters (masses up to 10^8 M_sun). However, in contrast\nto some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form the\ncentral bulge are not born in superclusters which then sink to the center of\nthe galaxy, because feedback efficiently disperses GMCs after they turn several\npercent of their mass into stars. Most of the mass that reaches the nucleus\ndoes so in the form of gas. The Kennicutt-Schmidt law emerges naturally as a\nconsequence of feedback balancing gravitational collapse, independent of the\nsmall-scale star formation microphysics. The same mechanisms that drive this\nrelation in isolated galaxies, in particular radiation pressure from IR\nphotons, extend over seven decades in SFR to regulate star formation in the\nmost extreme starbursts (densities >10^4 M_sun/pc^2). Feedback also drives\nsuper-winds with large mass loss rates; but a significant fraction of the wind\nmaterial falls back onto the disks at later times, leading to higher\npost-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback.

Spectra are obtained from ground-based telescopes and are tied\ndirectly to calibrated ground- and space-based photometry. The spectra remain\nonly \"mostly\" empirical because of telluric absorption, but interpolation of\nstellar models over the gaps in wavelength coverage provides continuous stellar\nspectra. Among other uses, the spectra are suitable for precisely converting\nobserved secondary eclipses (occultations) into absolute flux units with\nminimal recourse to models. In this letter I introduce ACME's methods and\npresent a calibrated spectrum of the nearby, super-Earth hosting star 55 Cancri\nthat spans the range from 0.81-5.05 micron.

We use numerical\nmethods to explore the sensitivity of f_NL, n_s and r to the reheating process,\nand present simple qualitative arguments to explain our results. In general, if\na large non-Gaussian signal exists at the start of reheating, it will remain\nnon zero at the end of reheating. Unless all isocurvature modes have completely\ndecayed before the start of reheating, we find that the non-linearity\nparameter, f_NL, can be sensitive to the reheating timescale, and that this\ndependence is most appreciable for `runaway' inflationary potentials that only\nhave a minimum in one direction. For potentials with a minimum in both\ndirections, f_NL can also be sensitive to reheating if a mild hierarchy exists\nbetween the decay rates of each field. Within the class of models studied, we\nfind that the spectral index n_s, is fairly insensitive to large changes in the\nfield decay rates, indicating that n_s is a more robust inflationary\nobservable, unlike the non-linearity parameter f_NL.

One hundred complete or partial Stokes IQUV sequences,\ncorresponding to 297 individual polarised spectra, have been obtained for 7\nbright Ap stars using the ESPaDOnS and NARVAL spectropolarimeters.

We show that turbulent\nsystems are always gravitationally unstable (in a probabilistic sense). The\nfragmentation mass spectra, size/mass relations, correlation functions, range\nof scales over which fragmentation occurs, & time-dependent rates of\nfragmentation are predictable.

We also generalize to include\nrotation, complicated equations of state, collapsing/expanding backgrounds,\nmagnetic fields, intermittency, & non-normal statistics. We derive how\nfragmentation is suppressed with 'stiffer' equations of state or different\ndriving mechanisms. Suppression appears at an 'effective sonic scale' where\nMach(R,rho)~1. Gas becomes stable below this scale for polytropic gamma>4/3,\nbut fragmentation still occurs on larger scales.

Currently, the\nimpacts of the primordial non-Gaussianities in the scalar perturbations, where\nthe rotational and parity invariances are kept, on the CMB bispectrum have been\nwell-studied. However, for a complex treatment, the CMB bispectra generated\nfrom the non-Gaussianities, which originate from the vector- and tensor-mode\nperturbations and include the violation of the rotational or parity invariance,\nhave never been considered in spite of the importance of this information.

The emission from both molecules arises from the inner\nregion of the disk extending from approximately 13 AU from the central star.\nThe velocity profiles of the OH lines are narrower than the velocity profile of\nthe [O I] 6300 Angstrom line indicating that the OH in the disk is not\ncospatial with the O I. This suggests that the inner optically thin region of\nthe disk is largely devoid of molecular gas. Unlike the ro-vibrational CO\nemission lines, the OH lines are highly asymmetric. We show that the average CO\nand average OH line profiles can be fit with a model of a disk comprised of an\neccentric inner wall and a circular outer disk. In this model, the vast\nmajority of the OH flux (75%) originates from the inner wall, while the vast\nmajority of the CO flux (65%) originates on the surface of the disk at radii\ngreater than 13 AU. Eccentric inner disks are predicted by hydrodynamic\nsimulations of circumstellar disks containing an embedded giant planet. We\ndiscuss the implications of such a disk geometry in light of models of planet\ndisk tidal interactions and propose alternate explanations for the origin of\nthe asymmetry. \n\n"}

We analyse the\ndisc counterpart to type II spicules, RBEs, in three high quality datasets from\nCRISP at the SST. In a quiet Sun region at disc centre we find lower Doppler\nvelocities, 15-40km/s, and Doppler widths, 2-15km/s, of RBEs than in earlier\ncoronal hole studies, 30-50km/s and 7-23km/s, respectively. We examine the\nspatial dependence of Doppler velocities and widths along RBE axes and conclude\nthat there is no clear trend over the FOV or in individual RBEs in quiet Sun at\ndisc centre. These differences with previous coronal hole studies are\nattributed to the more varying magnetic field configuration in quiet Sun\nconditions. Using an extremely high cadence dataset allowed us to improve\ngreatly on the determination of lifetimes of RBEs, found to range from 5 to 60s\nwith an average of 30s, as well as the transverse motions in RBEs, with\ntransverse velocities up to 55km/s and averaging 12km/s. Furthermore, our\nmeasurements of the recurrence rates of RBEs provide important new constraints\non coronal heating by spicules. We also see many examples of a sinusoidal wave\npattern in the transverse motion with periods averaging 54s and amplitudes from\n21.5 to 129km, agreeing well with previous studies of wave motion in limb\nspicules.

The derived gamma_b (the\nbreak Lorenz factor of the electron distribution) are 10^4-10^6 for Mrk 501 and\n200~600 for 3C 279 and the magnetic field strength (B) of Mrk 501 is usually\none order of magnitude lower than that of 3C 279, but their Doppler factors\n(delta) are comparable. A spectral variation feature that the peak luminosity\nis correlated with the peak frequency, which is opposite to the blazar\nsequence, is observed in the two sources. We find that (1) the peak\nluminosities of the two bumps in SEDs for Mrk 501 depend on gamma_b in both the\nobserver and co-moving frames, but they are not correlated with B and delta;\n(2)the luminosity variation of 3C 279 is dominated by the external Compton (EC)\npeak and its peak luminosity is correlated with gamma_b and delta, but\nanti-correlated with B.

The narrow distribution of gamma_b and the\ncorrelation of gamma_b and B in 3C 279 would be due to the cooling by the EC\nprocess and the strong magnetic field.

The AIA data show four stages of oxygen\nionization (O III - O VI) along with C IV, while XRT likely captured emission\nfrom O VII, a line typical of the corona.

Systems with 3-6 low-mass planets (or planet\ncandidates) produce a diversity of minimum-mass disks with surface density\nprofiles ranging from Sigma r^-3.2 to Sigma r^0.5 (5th-95th percentile). By\nsimulating the transit detection of populations of synthetic planetary systems\ndesigned to match the properties of observed super-Earth systems, we show that\na universal disk profile is statistically excluded at high confidence.

Of particular interest is the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) with\nresolution ~ 20 microarcsec in the millimeter-wavelength range 0.87 mm - 1.3\nmm. Aims. We investigate the ability of the fully general relativistic\nKomissarov (2006) analytical magnetized torus model to account for observable\nconstraints at Sgr A* in the centimeter and millimeter domains.

We\ncalculate ray-traced centimeter- and millimeter-wavelength synchrotron spectra\nand images of a magnetized accretion torus surrounding the central black hole\nin Sgr A*. We assume stationarity, axial symmetry, constant specific angular\nmomentum and polytropic equation of state. A hybrid population of thermal and\nnon-thermal electrons is considered. Results. We show that the torus model is\ncapable of reproducing spectral constraints in the millimeter domain, and in\nparticular in the observable domain of the EHT.

Turbulence can bring ice-coated\ndust grains from the midplane to the warm irradiated disk surface, and the ice\nmantles are reprocessed by photoreactions, thermal desorption, and surface\nreactions. The upward transport decreases the abundance of methanol and ammonia\nices at r < 30 AU, because warm dust temperature prohibits their reformation on\ngrain surfaces. This reprocessing could explain the smaller abundances of\ncarbon and nitrogen bearing molecules in cometary coma than those in low-mass\nprotostellar envelopes.

For example, for a 20 GeV\nWIMP, Generation 2 is only likely to identify the right operator if the\ninteraction is Coulomb-like, and is unlikely to do so in any other case. For a\nWIMP with a mass of 200 GeV or higher, success is almost guaranteed.

The friction time of particles included in\nthe simulation ranges from 0.1 tau_eta to 54T_L, with tau_eta and T_L the\nKolmogorov time and the Lagrangian correlation time of the flow, respectively.\nThe relative velocity PDF is generically non-Gaussian, exhibiting fat tails.\nFor a fixed value of tau_p1, the PDF is the fattest for equal-size particles\n(tau_p2~tau_p1), and becomes thinner at both tau_p2<tau_ p1 and tau_p2>tau_p1.\nDefining f as the friction time ratio of the smaller particle to the larger\none, we find that, at a given f in 1/2<f<1, the PDF fatness first increases\nwith the friction time, tau_ph, of the larger particle, peaks at\ntau_ph~tau_eta, and then decreases as tau_ph increases further.

Super-AGB stars are expected to\nhave slow winds with high mass-loss rates, so their wind density is high. The\nexplosions of super-AGB stars are therefore presumed to occur in this dense\nwind. We provide the first synthetic light curves (LCs) for such events by\nexploding realistic electron-capture supernova (ecSN) progenitors within their\nsuper-AGB winds. We find that the early LC, i.e. before the recombination wave\nreaches the bottom of the H-rich envelope of SN ejecta (the plateau phase), is\nnot affected by the dense wind. However, after the plateau phase, the\nluminosity remains higher when the super-AGB wind is taken into account. We\ncompare our results to the historical LC of SN 1054, the progenitor of the Crab\nNebula, and show that the explosion of an ecSN within an ordinary super-AGB\nwind can explain the LC features. We conclude that SN 1054 could have been a\nType IIn SN without any extra extreme mass loss which was previously suggested\nto be necessary to account for its early high luminosity. We also show that our\nLCs match Type IIn SNe with an early plateau phase (`Type IIn-P') and suggest\nthat they are ecSNe within super-AGB winds. Although some ecSNe can be bright\nin the optical spectral range due to the large progenitor radius, their X-ray\nluminosity from the interaction does not necessarily get as bright as other\nType IIn SNe whose optical luminosities are also powered by the interaction.\nThus, we suggest that optically-bright X-ray-faint Type IIn SNe can emerge from\necSNe. Optically-faint Type IIn SNe, such as SN 2008S, can also originate from\necSNe if their H-rich envelope masses are small.

We find a large range in the overall SLED shape, even amongst\ngalaxies of similar type, demonstrating the uncertainties in relying solely on\nhigh-J CO diagnostics to characterize the excitation source of a galaxy.\n  Combining our data with low-J line intensities taken from the literature, we\npresent a CO ratio-ratio diagram and discuss its potential diagnostic value in\ndistinguishing excitation sources and physical properties of the molecular gas.\nThe position of a galaxy on such a diagram is less a signature of its\nexcitation mechanism, than an indicator of the presence (or absence) of warm,\ndense molecular gas. We then quantitatively analyze the CO emission from a\nsubset of the detected sources with Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) radiative\ntransfer models to fit the CO SLEDs. Using both single-component and\ntwo-component LVG models to fit the kinetic temperature, velocity gradient,\nnumber density and column density of the gas, we derive the molecular gas mass\nand the corresponding CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor, $\\alpha_{CO}$, for each\nrespective source.

Therefore, the distribution of observed rotational\namplitudes of a large sample of stars depends on the distribution of their\nprojected axes of rotation. Thus, comparison of the stellar rotational\namplitudes of the Kepler KOIs with those of Kepler single stars can provide a\nmeasure to indirectly infer the properties of the spin-orbit obliquity of\nKepler planets. We apply this technique to the large samples of 993 KOIs and\n33,614 single Kepler stars in temperature range of 3500-6500 K. We find with\nhigh significance that the amplitudes of cool KOIs are larger, on the order of\n10%, than those of the single stars. In contrast, the amplitudes of hot KOIs\nare systematically lower.

Combining a relativistic hydrodynamic\nsimulation of the stellar disruption with a relativistic hydrodynamics\nsimulation of the tidal debris motion, we track such a system until ~80% of the\nstellar mass bound to the black hole has settled into an accretion flow. Shocks\nnear the stellar pericenter and also near the apocenter of the most\ntightly-bound debris dissipate orbital energy, but only enough to make the\ncharacteristic radius comparable to the semi-major axis of the most-bound\nmaterial, not the tidal radius as previously thought. The outer shocks are\ncaused by post-Newtonian effects, both on the stellar orbit during its\ndisruption and on the tidal forces. Accumulation of mass into the accretion\nflow is non-monotonic and slow, requiring ~3--10x the orbital period of the\nmost tightly-bound tidal streams, while the inflow time for most of the mass\nmay be comparable to or longer than the mass accumulation time. Deflection by\nshocks does, however, remove enough angular momentum and energy from some mass\nfor it to move inward even before most of the mass is accumulated into the\naccretion flow. Although the accretion rate rises sharply and then decays\nroughly as a power-law, its maximum is ~0.1x the previous expectation, and the\nduration of the peak is ~5x longer than previously predicted. The geometric\nmean of the black hole mass and stellar mass inferred from a measured event\ntimescale is therefore ~0.2x the value given by classical theory. \n\n"}

Estimating the rate of false positives of the overall\nKepler sample is necessary to derive the planet occurrence rate. We present the\nresults from two large observational campaigns that were conducted with the\nSpitzer telescope during the the Kepler mission.

We select a sub-sample of 51 candidates, spanning wide ranges in\nstellar, orbital and planetary parameter space, and we observe their transits\nwith Spitzer at 4.5 microns. We use these observations to measures the\ncandidate's transit depths and infrared magnitudes. A bandpass-dependent depth\nalerts us to the potential presence of a blending star that could be the source\nof the observed eclipse: a false-positive scenario. For most of the candidates\n(85%), the transit depths measured with Kepler are consistent with the depths\nmeasured with Spitzer as expected for planetary objects, while we find that the\nmost discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars that\ndilute the photometry.

This is mainly for two reasons. One relies on the gravitational\npotential of a moving lens being time-dependent (the $\\text{Moving}$\n$\\text{Cluster}$ $\\text{Effect}$, $\\text{MCE}$). The other is due to uneven\nmagnification across the extended, rotating source (the $\\text{Differential}$\n$\\text{Magnification}$ $\\text{Effect}$, $\\text{DME}$). The time delay between\nthe images can also cause their redshifts to differ because of cosmological\nexpansion. This Differential Expansion Effect is likely to be small. Using a\nsimple model, we derive these effects from first principles.\n  One application would be to the Bullet Cluster, whose large tangential\nvelocity may be inconsistent with the $\\Lambda CDM$ paradigm. This velocity can\nbe estimated with complicated hydrodynamic models. Uncertainties with such\nmodels can be avoided using the MCE. We argue that the MCE should be observable\nwith ALMA.\n  However, such measurements can be corrupted by the DME if typical spiral\ngalaxies are used as sources. Fortunately, we find that if detailed spectral\nline profiles were available, then the DME and MCE could be distinguished. It\nmight also be feasible to calculate how much the DME should affect the mean\nredshift of each image. Resolved observations of the source would be required\nto do this accurately.\n  The DME is of order the source angular size divided by the Einstein radius\ntimes the redshift variation across the source. Thus, it mostly affects nearly\nedge-on spiral galaxies in certain orientations. This suggests that observers\nshould reduce the DME by careful choice of target, a possibility we discuss in\nsome detail. \n\n"}

These data cover almost the entire main molecular cloud and also sample\ntwo diffuse infrared patches in the neighborhood of Lupus I. The large scale\npattern of the plane-of-sky projection of the magnetic field is perpendicular\nto the main axis of Lupus I, but parallel to the two diffuse infrared patches.\nA detailed analysis of our polarization data combined with the Herschel/SPIRE\n350 um dust emission map shows that the principal filament of Lupus I is\nconstituted by three main clumps acted by magnetic fields having different\nlarge-scale structure properties. These differences may be the reason for the\nobserved distribution of pre- and protostellar objects along the molecular\ncloud and its apparent evolutive stage.

Abstract: Thus far, there does not appear to be an agreed (or adequate) definition of\nhomogeneous dark energy (DE). This paper seeks to define a valid, adequate\nhomogeneity condition for DE. Firstly, it is shown that as long as $w_x \\neq\n-1$, DE must have perturbations. It is then argued, independent of $w_x$, that\na correct definition of homogeneous DE is one whose density perturbation\nvanishes in comoving gauge: and hence, in the DE rest frame. Using\nphenomenological DE, the consequence of this approach is then investigated in\nthe observed galaxy power spectrum - with the power spectrum being normalized\non small scales, at the present epoch z = 0. It is found that for high\nmagnification bias, relativistic corrections in the galaxy power spectrum are\nable to distinguish the concordance model from both a homogeneous DE and a\nclustering DE - on super-horizon scales. \n\n"}

The construction is based on a particular\nmodel of computation, developed by Alan Turing, with cosmic observers (CO),\ncosmic measures (CM) and cosmic symmetries (CS) described by Turing machines.\nCO machines always start with a blank tape and CM machines take CO's Turing\nnumber (also known as description number or G{\\\" o}del number) as input and\noutput the corresponding probability. Similarly, CS machines take CO's Turing\nnumber as input, but output either one if the CO machines are in the same\nequivalence class or zero otherwise.

We obtain maximum shift angles of about 25 degrees. Gas self-gravity\naccentuates the concentration differences between small and large grains. At\nlow to moderate disc masses, the larger the grains, the farther they are\ntrapped ahead of the vortex. Shift angles up to 90 degrees are reached for 10\ncm-sized grains, and we show that such large offsets can produce a\ndouble-peaked continuum emission observable at mm/cm wavelengths. This\nbehaviour comes about because the large grains undergo horseshoe U-turns\nrelative to the vortex due to the vortex's gravity. At large disc masses, since\nthe vortex's pattern frequency becomes increasingly slower than Keplerian,\nsmall grains concentrate slightly beyond the vortex and large grains form\ngenerally non-axisymmetric ring-like structures around the vortex's radial\nlocation.

However, few studies of more general\nplanets with arbitrary albedo markings have been made and, in particular, a\nsimple theoretical understanding of why it is possible to extract obliquity\nfrom light curves is missing. Reflected light seen by a distant observer is the\nproduct of a planet's albedo map, its host star's illumination, and the\nvisibility of different regions. It is useful to treat the product of\nillumination and visibility as the kernel of a convolution. Time-resolved\nphotometry constrains both the albedo map and the kernel, the latter of which\nsweeps over the planet due to rotational and orbital motion. The kernel's\nmovement distinguishes prograde from retrograde rotation for planets with\nnon-zero obliquity on inclined orbits.

The\nexistence of pseudo-caustics and the complex interplay between them and the\nformal caustics (which correspond to points of infinite magnification) can lead\nto interesting consequences, such as truncated or open caustics and a\nnon-conservation of total image parity. The origin of the pseudo-caustics is\nfound to be the non-differentiability of the solutions to the lens equation\nacross the ring/belt boundaries, with the pseudo-caustics corresponding to\nring/belt boundaries mapped into the source plane. We provide a few\nillustrative examples to understand the pseudo-caustic features, and in a\nseparate paper consider a specific astronomical application of our results to\nstudy microlensing by extrasolar asteroid belts. \n\n"}

A larger abundance of micrometre-sized grains leads to an overall\nheating of the disc, so that the water ice line moves further away from the\nstar. An increase in the water fraction inside the disc, maintaining a fixed\ndust abundance, increases the temperature in the icy regions of the disc and\nlowers the temperature in the inner regions. Discs with a larger silicate\nfraction have the opposite effect. Here we explore the consequence of the dust\ncomposition and abundance for the formation and migration of planets. We find\nthat discs with low water content can only sustain outwards migration for\nplanets up to 4 Earth masses, while outwards migration in discs with a larger\nwater content persists up to 8 Earth masses in the late stages of the disc\nevolution. Icy planetary cores that do not reach run-away gas accretion can\nthus migrate to orbits close to the host star if the water abundance is low.\nOur results imply that hot and warm super-Earths found in exoplanet surveys\ncould have formed beyond the ice line and thus contain a significant fraction\nin water.

Here we present\ntheoretical models for the temperature structure and atmospheric circulation of\ndry, tidally locked rocky exoplanets with grey radiative transfer and test them\nusing a general circulation model (GCM). First, we develop a\nradiative-convective model that captures surface temperatures of slowly\nrotating and cool atmospheres.

Third, we develop a radiative-convective-subsiding model which\nextends our radiative-convective model to hot and thin atmospheres. We find\nthat rocky planets develop large day-night temperature gradients at a ratio of\nwave-to-radiative timescales up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the\nvalue suggested by work on hot Jupiters.

Saturn's rings are\nmassive and made of 90-95% of water ice. In contrast, the much less massive\nrings of Uranus and Neptune are dark and likely to have higher rock fraction.\nHere we investigate, for the first time, the tidal disruption of a passing\nobject, including the subsequent formation of planetary rings. First, we\nperform SPH simulations of the tidal destruction of big differentiated objects\n($M_{\\rm body}=10^{21-23}$) that experience close encounters with Saturn or\nUranus. We find that about $0.1-10$% of the mass of the passing body is\ngravitationally captured around the planet. However, these fragments are\ninitially big chunks and have highly eccentric orbits around the planet. Then,\nwe perform N-body simulations including the planet's oblateness, starting with\ndata obtained from the SPH simulations. Our N-body simulations show that the\nchunks are tidally destroyed during their next several orbits. Their individual\norbits then start to precess incoherently around the planet's equator, which\nenhances their encounter velocities on longer-term evolution, resulting in more\ndestructive impacts. These collisions would damp their eccentricities resulting\nin a progressive collapse of the debris cloud into a thin equatorial and\nlow-eccentricity ring. These high energy impacts are expected to be\ncatastrophic enough to produce small particles. Our numerical results also show\nthat the mass of formed rings is large enough to explain current rings\nincluding inner regular satellites around Saturn and Uranus. In the case of\nUranus, a body can go deeper inside the planet's Roche limit resulting in a\nmore efficient capture of rocky material compared to Saturn's case in which\nmostly ice is captured. Thus, our results can naturally explain the\ncompositional difference between the rings of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. \n\n"}

We study the following\nneutrino properties: (i) the total neutrino mass $ M_\\nu =\\sum_i m_i$; (ii) the\nnumber of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{eff}$; and (iii) the neutrino\nhierarchy: whereas previous literature assumed 3 degenerate neutrino masses or\ntwo massless neutrino species (that do not match neutrino oscillation data), we\nstudy the cases of normal and inverted hierarchy. Our basic result is that\nthese three neutrino properties induce $< 1 \\sigma$ shift of the probability\ncontours in the $n_s/r$ plane with both current or upcoming data. We find that\nthe choice of neutrino hierarchy has a negligible impact. However, the minimal\ncutoff on the total neutrino mass $M_{\\nu,{min}}=0 $ that accompanies previous\nworks using the degenerate hierarchy does introduce biases in the $n_s/r$ plane\nand should be replaced by $M_{\\nu,min}= 0.059$ eV as required by oscillation\ndata.

In this paper we study the process of hierarchical\ngrowth, where aggregates are built from significantly smaller aggregates (but\nnot monomers). We show that this process can be understood as a modified,\nPCA-like process that produces porous, but non-fractal particles whose filling\nfactor is chiefly determined by the porosity of the building blocks.\n  We also show that in a coagulation environment where relative velocities are\ndriven by turbulence, a logarithmically flat mass distribution (equal mass per\nmass decade) as it is typically found in environments where fragmentation\nreplenishes small grains, leads to a situation where small particles and\naggregates dominate the growth of large ones. Therefore, in such environments,\nhierarchical growth should be seen as the norm. Consequently, we predict that\nthe aggregates in such environments are not fractals with extremely low\ndensities as they would result from extrapolation fractal laws to large sizes.\nThe compactification of aggregates does not only result from collisions with\nenough energy to restructure aggregates - it starts already earlier by filling\nvoids in particles with smaller grains that contribute to the growth. \n\n"}

The discovered compact systems sometimes\ncontain multiple transiting planets, so that their orbital angular momentum\nvectors are tightly aligned. Since planetary orbits are susceptible to forced\noscillations of their inclination angles, the highly aligned nature of these\nsystems places constraints on possible additional (non-transiting) planets.

This problem thus far has largely been addressed only by\nconsidering two objects: the star and the planet itself. However, many systems\nhave been found to harbor multiple planets, with some in or very near to\nmean-motion resonances. The presence of a planetary companion near a\nmean-motion resonance can induce oscillatory variations in the mean-motion of\nthe planet, which we demonstrate can have significant effects on the spin-state\nof an otherwise synchronously rotating planet.

A ring\nparent moon with a mass comparable to Mimas could be trapped in mean motion\nresonance with Enceladus and Dione in an orbit near the current outer edge of\nthe rings just beyond the Roche zone. I present collisional N-body simulations\nof cometary impacts that lead to the partial disruption of a differentiated\nmoon with a rocky core and icy mantle. The core can survive largely intact\nwhile the debris from the mantle settles into a ring of predominantly ice\nparticles straddling the orbital radius of the parent moon. The nascent ring\nspreads radially due to collisional viscosity while mass re-accretes onto the\nremnant rocky core to form a new moon that can be identified as Mimas. The icy\ndebris that migrates into the Roche zone evolves into Saturn's ring system.\nTorques from tidal interaction with Saturn and resonant interactions with the\nrings push the recently formed Mimas outward to its current position on the\nsame timescale of a few hundred million years. This scenario accounts for the\nhigh ice fraction observed in Saturn's rings and explains why the ring mass is\ncomparable to the mass of Mimas. The prior existence of a ring parent moon in\nmean motion resonance results in a tidal heating rate for Enceladus in the\nrecent past that is significantly larger than the current rate. \n\n"}

The different quantities that can\nand should be derived when measuring the night sky brightness are discussed, as\nwell as the procedures that have been and still need to be defined in this\ncontext. We conclude that in many situations, calibrated consumer digital\ncameras with fisheye lenses provide the best relation between ease-of-use and\nwealth of obtainable information on the night sky. While they do not obtain\nfull spectral information, they are able to sample the complete sky in a period\nof minutes, with colour information in three bands. This is important, as given\nthe current global changes in lamp spectra, changes in sky radiance observed\nonly with single band devices may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding long\nterm changes in sky brightness.

We study this claim in detail by focusing on a subset\nof wide-area future surveys: Stage-4 cosmic microwave background experiments\nand photometric redshift surveys.

The expected thermal emission and\nwavelength dependent dimming is derived for different orbital parameters and\ngeometries, including dust that is optically thick to stellar radiation, and\nfor a size distribution of dust with realistic optical properties. We first\nconsider dust distributed evenly around the orbit, then show how to derive its\nuneven distribution from the optical light curve and to predict light curves at\ndifferent wavelengths. The fractional luminosity of an even distribution is\napproximately the level of dimming times stellar radius divided by distance\nfrom the star at transit. Non-detection of dust thermal emission for KIC8462852\nthus provides a lower limit on the transit distance to complement the 0.6au\nupper limit imposed by 0.4day dips. Unless the dust distribution is optically\nthick, the putative 16% century-long secular dimming must have disappeared\nbefore the WISE 12micron measurement in 2010, and subsequent 4.5micron\nobservations require transits at >0.05au. However, self-absorption of thermal\nemission removes these constraints for opaque dust distributions. The passage\nof dust clumps through pericentre is predicted to cause infrared brightening\nlasting 10s of days and dimming during transit, such that total flux received\ndecreases at wavelengths <5micron, but increases to potentially detectable\nlevels at longer wavelengths.

Collapsing cores in out-of-virial disguise Abstract: We study the dynamical state of cores by using a simple analytical model, a\nsample of observational massive cores, and numerical simulations of collapsing\nmassive cores. From the model, we find that, if cores are formed from turbulent\ncompressions, they evolve from small to large column densities, increasing\ntheir velocity dispersion as they collapse, while they tend to equipartition\nbetween gravity and kinetic energy.\n  From the observational sample, we find that: (a) cores with substantially\ndifferent column densities in the sample do not follow a Larson-like\nlinewidth-size relation. Instead, cores with higher column densities tend to be\nlocated in the upper-left corner of the Larson velocity dispersion-size\ndiagram, a result predicted previously (Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2011a). (b)\nThe data exhibit cores with overvirial values.\n  Finally, in the simulations we reproduce the behavior depicted by the model\nand observational sample: cores evolve towards larger velocity dispersions and\nsmaller sizes as they collapse and increase their column density. However,\ncollapsing cores appear to approach overvirial states within a free-fall time.\nThe cause of this apparent excess of kinetic energy is an underestimation of\nthe gravitational energy, due to the assumption that the gravitational energy\nis given by the energy of an isolated sphere of constant column density. This\nexcess disappears when the gravitational energy is correctly calculated from\nthe actual spatial mass distribution, where inhomogeneities, as well as the\npotential due to the mass outside of the core, also contribute to the\ngravitational energy. We conclude that the observed energy budget of cores in\nsurveys is consistent with their non-thermal motions being driven by their\nself-gravity and in a hierarchical and chaotic collapse. \n\n"}

We have\nstudied the properties of the nearby fossil group RXJ075243.6+455653 in order\nto understand the mass assembly of this system. Deep spectroscopic observations\nallow us to construct the galaxy luminosity function (LF) of RXJ075243.6+455653\ndown to M*+ 6. The analysis of the faint-end of the LF in groups and clusters\nprovides valuable information about the mass assembly of the system.

The LF of the group shows a\nflat faint-end slope ( -1.08 +/- 0.33). This low density of dwarf galaxies is\nconfirmed by the low value of the dwarf-to-giant ratio (DGR = 0.99 +/- 0.49)\nfor this system. Both the lack of dwarf galaxies and the low luminosity of the\nBGG suggests that RXJ075243.6+455653 still has to accrete mass from its nearby\nenvironment.

The observed variability of asymmetric,\ndouble-peaked emission line profiles in about half of such systems could be\ninterpreted as the signature of precession of an eccentric gaseous debris disk.\nThe variability timescales --- from decades down to $1.4$ yr (recently inferred\nfor the debris disk around HE 1349--2305) --- are in rough agreement with the\nrate of general relativistic (GR) precession in the test particle limit.\nHowever, it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can drive such a\nfast, coherent precession of a radially extended (out to $1 R_\\odot$) gaseous\ndisk mediated by internal stresses (pressure). Here we use the linear theory of\neccentricity evolution in hydrodynamic disks to determine several key\nproperties of eccentric modes in gaseous debris disks around WDs.

The\ninstability is evolved due to wave perturbations that are parallel to the\nmagnetic field at the density interface. We conjecture that the prominence\nplasma is supported by tension component of the magnetic field against gravity.\nUsing linear stability theory, magnetic field is estimated as 21-40 mG to\nsuppress growth of MRT in the observed finger structures.

Physically,\nPPDs might be truncated either by photoevaporation due to ultraviolet flux from\nmassive stars, or tidal truncation due to close stellar encounters. Here we aim\nto compare the two effects in real cluster environments. In this vein we first\nreview the properties of well studied stellar clusters with a focus on stellar\nnumber density, which largely dictates the degree of tidal truncation, and far\nultraviolet (FUV) flux, which is indicative of the rate of external\nphotoevaporation. We then review the theoretical PPD truncation radius due to\nan arbitrary encounter, additionally taking into account the role of eccentric\nencounters that play a role in hot clusters with a 1D velocity dispersion\n$\\sigma_v > 2$ km/s.

This transfer\nincreases the binary orbital period, expanding the region of dynamical\ninstability around the binary, and destabilizing CBPs that tend to\npreferentially orbit just beyond the initial dynamical stability limit. After\nthe stars tidally lock, we find that angular momentum loss due to magnetic\nbraking can significantly shrink the binary orbit, and hence the region of\ndynamical stability, over time impacting where surviving CBPs are observed\nrelative to the boundary. We perform simulations over a wide range of parameter\nspace and find that the expansion of the instability region occurs for most\nplausible initial conditions and that in some cases, the stability semi-major\naxis doubles from its initial value.

All of these characteristics are consistent\nwith models of self-scattering of submillimeter-wave emission from an optically\nthin inclined disk. The distribution of the polarization position angles across\nthe disk reveals that while the average orientation is along the minor axis,\nthe polarization orientations show a significant spread in angles; this can\nalso be explained by models of pure scattering.

This fundamental principle however has\nrecently been questioned, as migrating planets were shown to decouple from the\ngas' radial drift. Aims. In this framework, we question whether the\ntraditionally used linear scaling of migration rate of a giant planet with the\ndisk's viscosity still holds. Additionally, we assess the role of\norbit-crossing material as part of the decoupling mechanism. Methods. We have\nperformed 2D (r, {\\theta}) numerical simulations of point-mass planets embedded\nin locally isothermal {\\alpha}-disks in steady-state accretion, with various\nvalues of {\\alpha}.

BSSs are commonly found in\nglobular clusters, but they are also known to populate open clusters of the\nMilky Way. Two main theoretical scenarios (collisions and mass transfer) have\nbeen suggested to explain their formation, although finding observational\nevidence in support of either scenario represents a challenging task. Among the\nAPOGEE observations of the old open cluster M67, we found 8 BSS candidates\nknown from the literature and two known evolved BSSs. We carried out a chemical\nanalysis of 3 BSS candidates and of the 2 evolved BSSs out of the sample and\nfound that the BSS candidates have surface abundances similar to those of stars\non the main-sequence turn-off of M67. Especially the absence of any anomaly in\ntheir carbon abundances seems to support a collisional formation scenario for\nthese stars. Furthermore, we note that the abundances of the evolved BSSs S1040\nand S1237 are consistent with the abundances of the red clump stars of M67. In\nparticular, they show a depletion in carbon by $\\sim0.25$ dex, which could be\neither interpreted as the signature of mass transfer or as the product of\nstellar evolutionary processes.

However, a number of hurdles associated with\nsearching QPOs in blazars e.g., red-noise dominance, modest significance of the\ndetection and periodic modulation lasting for only a couple of cycles, make it\ndifficult to estimate the true significance of the detection.

During the GRB\nprompt phase, some dissipation processes may happen and disturb the magnetic\nfield, making the field become random to some extent. Therefore, a mixed\nmagnetic field consisting of an ordered component and a random component is\nplausible for the early afterglow phase. Here we investigate the polarization\nevolution and light curve of an afterglow under such a 3-dimensional mixed\nmagnetic field. Three kinds of ordered component (i.e., aligned, toroidal and\nradial) are discussed. We find that the three cases are distinguishable through\njet polarization evolution. The polarization angle for a 3D mixed magnetic\nfield with an aligned ordered component can evolve gradually but only changes\nabruptly by $90^\\circ$ in the toroidal and radial cases. Furthermore, during\nthe reverse shock crossing time, the polarization degree (PD) can be non-zero\nfor the toroidal case but roughly zero for the radial case. Since an aligned\ncomponent in a jet corresponds to a magnetar central engine and a toroidal\ncomponent corresponds to a black hole, GRB central engines are distinguishable\nthrough polarization observations even if the magnetic field is mixed in a jet.\nIn addition, our polarization calculation can be applied to GRB 170817A\nassociated with GW170817. Using the recently-observed PD upper limit $12\\%$ of\nGRB 170817A at $t=244$ days, the magnetic field strength ratio of the ordered\nto random components in this afterglow is constrained to be $\\lesssim0.9$. \n\n"}

In\ncontrast to previous works on the basis of extensive numerical simulations, our\nmodel provides for the first time an analytic expression for the joint\nprobability function. Specifically we derive the joint probability function of\nhalo and mass density contrasts from the extended Press-Schechter theory. Since\nthis function is derived in the framework of the standard gravitational\ninstability theory assuming the random-Gaussianity of the primordial density\nfield alone, we expect that the basic features of the nonlinear and stochastic\nbiasing predicted from our model are fairly generic. As representative\nexamples, we compute the various biasing parameters in cold dark matter models\nas a function of a redshift and a smoothing length. Our major findings are (1)\nthe biasing of the variance evolves strongly as redshift while its\nscale-dependence is generally weak and a simple linear biasing model provides a\nreasonable approximation roughly at $R\\simgt 2(1+z)\\himpc$, and (2) the\nstochasticity exhibits moderate scale-dependence especially on $R\\simlt\n20\\himpc$, but is almost independent of $z$.

Constraining Cosmology from Redshift\n  Space Distortions via xi(sigma,pi) Abstract: We describe a method from which cosmology may be constrained from the 2QZ\nSurvey. By comparing clustering properties parallel and perpendicular to the\nline of sight and by modeling the effects of redshift space distortions, we are\nable to study geometric distortions in the clustering pattern which occur if a\nwrong cosmology is assumed when translating redshifts into comoving distances.\n  Using mock 2QZ catalogues, drawn from the Hubble Volume simulation, we find,\nthat there is a degeneracy between the geometric and the redshift-space\ndistortions that makes it difficult to obtain an unambiguous estimate of\nOmega_{m}(0) from the geometric tests alone. However, we demonstrate a new\nmethod to determine the cosmology which works by combining the above geometric\ntest with a test based on the evolution of the QSO clustering amplitude. We\nfind that we are able to break the degeneracy and that independent constraints\nto +-20% (1 sigma) accuracy on Omega_{m}(0) and +-10% (1 sigma) accuracy on\nbeta_{QSO}(z) should be possible in the full 2QZ survey.\n  Finally we apply the method to the 10k catalogue of 2QZ QSOs. The smaller\nnumber of QSOs and the current status of the Survey mean that a strong result\non cosmology is not possible but we do constrain beta_{QSO}(z) to 0.35+-0.2. By\ncombining this constraint with the further constraint available from the\namplitude of QSO clustering, we find tentative evidence favouring a model with\nnon-zero Omega_{Lambda}(0), although an Omega_{m}(0)=1 model provides only a\nmarginally less good fit. A model with Omega_{Lambda}(0)=1 is ruled out. The\nresults are in agreement with those found by Outram et al. using a similar\nanalysis in Fourier space. (Abridged) \n\n"}

Unlike hydro turbulence, MHD\nturbulence is anisotropic on small scales. Moreover, compressible modes are\nimportant for MHD and magnetic perturbations can directly interact with grains.\nWe provide calculations of grain relative motion for realistic interstellar\nturbulence driving that is consistent with the velocity dispersions observed in\ndiffuse gas and for realistic grain charging. We account for the turbulence\ncutoff arising from abmipolar drag. Our results on grain shattering are\nconsistent with the customary accepted cutoff size.

The lifetime of rapid spin of the black hole is\neffectively defined by the timescale of dissipation of black hole-spin energy\nin the horizon, and satisfies T= 40s (MH/7MSun)(R/6MH)^4(0.03MH/MT) for a black\nhole of mass MH surrounded by a torus of mass MT and radius R. The torus\nconverts a major fraction Egw/Erot=0.1 into gravitational radiation through a\nfinite number of multipole mass-moments, and a smaller fraction into MeV\nneutrinos and baryon-rich winds. At a source distance of 100Mpc, these\nemissions over N=2e4 periods give rise to a characteristic strain amplitude\n\\sqrt{N}hchar=6e-21. We argue that torus winds create an open magnetic\nflux-tube on the black hole, which carries a minor and standard fraction\nEj/Erot=1e-3 in baryon-poor outflows to infinity. We identify this baryon poor\noutput of tens of seconds with GRBs with contemporaneous and strongly\ncorrelated emissions in gravitational radiation, conceivably at multiple\nfrequencies.

We assume the neutron star to be low--magnetized (B~10^8 G).\nIn the systems investigated in this paper, our computations show that during\nthe binary evolution the companion transfers as much as 1 solar mass to the\nneutron star, with an accretion rate of 10^-9 solar masses/yr. This is\nsufficient to keep the inner rim of the accretion disc in contact with the\nneutron star surface, thus preventing the onset of a propeller phase capable of\nejecting a significant fraction of the matter transferred by the companion. We\nfind that, for neutron stars governed by equations of state from soft up to\nmoderately stiff, an accretion induced collapse to a black hole is almost\nunavoidable. The collapse to a black hole can occur either during the accretion\nphase or after the end of the mass transfer when the neutron star is left in a\nsupramassive sequence. In this last case the collapse is driven by energy\nlosses of the fast spinning radio pulsar. For extremely supramassive neutron\nstars these energy losses cause a spin up. As a consequence the pulsar will\nhave a much shorter lifetime than that of a canonical radio pulsar. This\nbehavior depends on the equation of state for ultra-dense matter and therefore\ncould be used to constrain the internal structure of the neutron star. If the\nr-modes of the neutron star are excited during the accretion process, the\ngravitational waves emisson limits the maximum spin attainable by a NS to\nroughly 2 ms. In this case the collapse during the accretion phase is even more\ncommon since the maximum mass achievable before the collapse to a black hole\nduring accretion is smaller due to the limited spin frequency. \n\n"}

We focus on the accretion rate distribution p(mdot|M,z), the\nprobability that a black hole of mass M at redshift z accretes at a rate mdot\nin Eddington units. Given the radiative efficiency as a function of mdot, the\nquasar luminosity function (QLF) is determined by a convolution of p(mdot|M,z)\nwith the black hole mass function n(M,z). In the absence of mergers p(mdot|M,z)\nalso determines the full evolution of n(M,z), given a \"boundary value\" of n(M)\nat some redshift. Matching the observed decline of the QLF break luminosity at\nz<2 requires either a shift towards lower characteristic accretion rates or an\nevolving mass dependence of p(mdot) that preferentially shuts off accretion\nonto high mass black holes. These two scenarios make different predictions for\nthe masses and accretion rates of active black holes. If the first mechanism\ndominates, then the QLF changes character between z=2 and z=0, shifting from a\nsequence of black hole mass towards a sequence of L/Ledd. We construct and\ncompare five models that illustrate different assumptions about the quasar\npopulation: short and long lifetime models dominated by unobscured thin-disk\naccretion, a model with a high fraction of obscured quasars, and models in\nwhich mergers or ADAF accretion produce substantial black hole growth at low\nredshift.

Since the Ly-a escape fraction is\n<10% from an emitting region of size roughly 1 kpc, these objects will be\ndifficult to find and hard to detect. For CSR sources, existing large-format IR\narrays are close to ideal in terms of their noise characteristics for\nconducting \"wide-field\" narrowband surveys where pixel sizes are 0.1\" or\nlarger. However, we stress that Ly-a can also arise from external large-scale\nshocks (ELS) due to starburst winds, powered by CSRs, ploughing into gas\nactively accreting onto the dark halo. The winds effectively carry energy from\nthe dense, dusty environment of a starburst into lower density regions, where\nthe escape probability for Ly-a photons is greater.

Here we focus on the final stages of\nthe HM scenario. Namely, we integrate numerically the orbits of stars which are\ninitially bound to the IMBH, but are stripped from it by the tidal field of\nSgrA*. Our numerical algorithm is a symplectic integrator designed specifically\nfor the problem at hand; however, we have checked our results with SYMBA, a\nversion of the widely available SWIFT code. We find that the distribution of\nthe post-inspiral orbital parameters is sensitive to the eccentricity of the\ninspiraling IMBH. If the IMBH is on a circular orbit, then the inclinations of\nnumerically computed orbits relative to the inspiral plane are almost always\nsmaller than 10 degrees, and therefore (a) the simulations are in good\nagreement with the observed motions of stars in a clockwise-moving stellar\ndisc, (b) the simulations never reproduce the orbits of stars outside this\ndisc, which include those in the second thick ring of stars and the randomly\noriented unrelaxed orbits of some of the S-stars.

We compute it explicitly for the Peebles-Young distribution function\nof the cusp, and make a detailed model for the time-dependent ejection of stars\nduring the IMBH inspiral. We find that (1) the stars are ejected in a burst\nlasting a few dynamical friction timescales; if the ejected stars are detected\nby Gaia they are likely to be produced by a single inspiral event, (2) if the\ninspiral is circular than in the beginning of the burst the velocity vectors of\nthe ejected stars cluster around the inspiral plane, but rapidly isotropise as\nthe burst proceeds, (3) if the inspiral is eccentric, then the stars are\nejected in a broad jet roughly perpendicular to the Runge-Lenz vector of the\nIMBH orbit.

In this paper, we systematically analyze the\npossible physical processes that shape the properties of the early X-ray\nafterglow lightcurves, and use the data to constrain various models. We suggest\nthat the steep decay component is consistent with the tail emission of the\nprompt gamma-ray bursts and/or of the X-ray flares. This provides clear\nevidence that the prompt emission and afterglow emission are two distinct\ncomponents, supporting the internal origin of the GRB prompt emission. The\nshallow decay segment observed in a group of GRBs suggests that the forward\nshock keeps being refreshed for some time. This might be caused either by a\nlong-lived central engine, or by a power law distribution of the shell Lorentz\nfactors, or else by the deceleration of a Poynting flux dominated flow. X-ray\nflares suggest that the GRB central engine is still active after the prompt\ngamma-ray emission is over, but with a reduced activity at later times.

In order to address such questions, we build\na model to describe the distribution of galaxy underdensities. Our model is\nbased on the \"excursion set formalism,\" the same technique used to predict the\ndark matter halo mass function.

However, the computation of the optical properties of such\nparticles is still a very difficult problem. We analyze how the increase of\ngrain porosity influences basic features of cosmic dust -- interstellar\nextinction, dust temperature, infrared bands and millimeter opacity. Porous\ngrains can reproduce the flat extinction across the $3 - 8 \\mkm$ wavelength\nrange measured for several lines of sight by {\\it ISO} and {\\it Spitzer}.\n  Porous grains are generally cooler than compact grains. At the same time, the\ntemperature of very porous grains becomes slightly larger in the case of the\nEMT-Mie calculations in comparison with the results found from the\nlayered-sphere model. The layered-sphere model predicts a broadening of\ninfrared bands and a shift of the peak position to larger wavelengths as\nporosity grows. In the case of the EMT-Mie model variations of the feature\nprofile are less significant. It is also shown that the millimeter mass\nabsorption coefficients grow as porosity increases with a faster growth\noccurring for particles with Rayleigh/non-Rayleigh inclusions. As a result, for\nvery porous particles the coefficients given by two models can differ by a\nfactor of about 3.\n  It is found that an increase of porosity leads to an increase of extinction\ncross sections at some wavelengths and a decrease at others depending on the\ngrain model.

We compare the original\nsimulation to `shuffled' versions where the galaxy populations are randomly\nswapped among halos of similar mass, thus isolating the effects of correlations\nbetween assembly history and environment at fixed mass. Such correlations are\nignored in the halo occupation distribution models often used populate dark\nmatter simulations with galaxies, but they are significant in our more\nrealistic simulation. Assembly bias enhances 2-point correlations by 10% for\ngalaxies with M_bJ-5logh brighter than -17, but suppresses them by a similar\namount for galaxies brighter than -20. When such samples are split by colour,\nassembly bias is 5% stronger for red galaxies and 5% weaker for blue ones. Halo\ncentral galaxies are differently affected by assembly bias than are galaxies of\nall types. It almost doubles the correlation amplitude for faint red central\ngalaxies. Shuffling galaxies among halos of fixed formation redshift or\nconcentration in addition to fixed mass produces biases which are not much\nsmaller than when mass alone is fixed.

The 0.4--10 keV X-ray\nluminosity of X-1 and X-2 was measured as $2.5 \\times 10^{40}~{\\rm erg~s^{-1}}$\nand $5.8 \\times 10^{39}~{\\rm erg~s^{-1}}$, respectively, with the former the\nhighest ever reported for this ULX. The spectrum of X-1 can be explained by a\nsum of a strong and variable power-law component with a high energy cutoff, and\na stable multicolor blackbody with an innermost disk temperature of $\\sim 0.2$\nkeV. These results suggest that X-1 was in a ``very high'' state, where the\ndisk emission is strongly Comptonized. The absorber within NGC 1313 toward X-1\nis suggested to have a subsolar oxygen abundance. The spectrum of X-2 is best\nrepresented, in its fainter phase, by a multicolor blackbody model with the\ninnermost disk temperature of 1.2--1.3 keV, and becomes flatter as the source\nbecomes brighter. Hence X-2 is interpreted to be in a slim-disk state. These\nresults suggest that the two ULXs have black hole masses of a few tens to a few\nhundreds solar masses. \n\n"}

We build two sets of ~30000 CSP models\nusing stellar populations synthesis models, combining an old population and a\nyoung population with a range of ages and chemical compositions representative\nof early-type galaxies. We investigate how the SSP-equivalent stellar\nparameters of the CSP's depend on the stellar parameters of the two input\npopulations; how they depend on V-band luminosity-weighted stellar parameters;\nand how SSP-equivalent parameters derived from different Balmer-line indices\ncan be used to reveal the presence of a young population on top of an old one.\nWe find that the SSP-equivalent age depends primarily on the age of the young\npopulation and on the mass fraction of the two populations, and that the\nSSP-equivalent chemical composition depends mainly on the chemical composition\nof the old population. Furthermore, while the SSP-equivalent chemical\ncomposition tracks quite closely the V-band luminosity weighted one, the\nSSP-equivalent age does not and is strongly biased towards the age of the young\npopulation. In this bias the age of the young population and the mass fraction\nbetween old and young population are degenerate.

In this work, we find that, as a function of spectral index n,\nthe one-loop bispectrum follows a pattern analogous to that of the one-loop\npower spectrum, which shows a change in behavior at a critical index n_c =\n-1.4, where non-linear corrections vanish. For the bispectrum, for n less than\nn_c, one-loop corrections increase the configuration dependence of the leading\norder contribution; for n greater than n_c, one-loop corrections tend to cancel\nthe configuration dependence of the tree-level bispectrum, in agreement with\nknown results from n=-1 numerical simulations.

We demonstrate using hydrodynamic simulations of\ngalaxy formation in a cosmological context that irregular protogalactic clumps\ncan reproduce the observed velocity width distribution and asymmetries of the\nabsorption profiles equally well. The velocity broadening in the simulated\nclumps is due to a mixture of rotation, random motions, infall and merging.

Previous studies of this problem have incorporated gravitational\ndynamics and adiabatic gas dynamics, but radiative cooling, an essential\nelement of the physics of galaxy formation, normally violates the conditions\nnecessary for self-similar evolution. We show that for any specified value of\nthe initial power spectrum index n [where P(k)~k^n], there is a family of\npower-law cooling functions that preserves self-similarity by ensuring that the\ncooling time in an object of the characteristic mass M_* is a fixed fraction\nt_C of the Hubble time.

Because $\\tilde{b}^{(n)}_j$ with\ndifferent $n$ are independent from each other, a systematic analysis of the\n$j$-spectra of $\\tilde{b}^{(n)}_j$ and $b_j^{(n)}$ is necessary.

The\nderivation requires only that the post-1-Newtonian vacuum field equations are\nsatisfied in weak-field regions between the bodies; the bodies' internal\ngravity can be arbitrarily strong. The derivation extends previous results of\nDamour, Soffel and Xu (DSX) for weakly self-gravitating bodies for which the\npost-1-Newtonian field equations are satisfied everywhere.
