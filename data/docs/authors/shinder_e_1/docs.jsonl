{"id": "1102.1428", "contents": "Title: Hyperconifold Transitions, Mirror Symmetry, and String Theory Abstract: Multiply-connected Calabi-Yau threefolds are of particular interest for both\nstring theorists and mathematicians. Recently it was pointed out that one of\nthe generic degenerations of these spaces (occurring at codimension one in\nmoduli space) is an isolated singularity which is a finite cyclic quotient of\nthe conifold; these were called hyperconifolds. It was also shown that if the\norder of the quotient group is even, such singular varieties have projective\ncrepant resolutions, which are therefore smooth Calabi-Yau manifolds. The\nresulting topological transitions were called hyperconifold transitions, and\nchange the fundamental group as well as the Hodge numbers. Here Batyrev's\nconstruction of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric fourfolds is used to\ndemonstrate that certain compact examples containing the remaining\nhyperconifolds - the Z_3 and Z_5 cases - also have Calabi-Yau resolutions. The\nmirrors of the resulting transitions are studied and it is found, surprisingly,\nthat they are ordinary conifold transitions. These are the first examples of\nconifold transitions with mirrors which are more exotic extremal transitions.\nThe new hyperconifold transitions are also used to construct a small number of\nnew Calabi-Yau manifolds, with small Hodge numbers and fundamental group Z_3 or\nZ_5. Finally, it is demonstrated that a hyperconifold is a physically sensible\nbackground in Type IIB string theory. In analogy to the conifold case,\nnon-perturbative dynamics smooth the physical moduli space, such that\nhyperconifold transitions correspond to non-singular processes in the full\ntheory. \n\n"}

This topological Chern map provides a natural candidate for the\nexistence of a rational structure on the periodic cylic homology of a smooth\nproper dg-algebra, within the theory of noncommutative Hodge structures. The\ndefinition of topological K-theory consists in two steps : taking the\ntopological realization of algebraic K-theory, and inverting the Bott element.\nThe topological realization is the left Kan extension of the functor \"space of\ncomplex points\" to all simplicial presheaves over complex algebraic varieties.\nOur first main result states that the topological K-theory of the unit\ndg-category is the spectrum BU. For this we are led to prove a homotopical\ngeneralization of Deligne's cohomological proper descent, using Lurie's proper\ndescent.

This theorem builds\non an earlier method of hers which was implemented by Albano and Collino to\nprove the same result for a general cubic sevenfold. In fact, Voisin's method\ncan be utilized precisely because the variation of Hodge structure on a cubic\n7-fold behaves just like the variation of Hodge structure of a Calabi-Yau\n3-fold. We explain this relationship concretely using Kontsevitch's\nnoncommutative geometry. Namely, we show that for a cubic 7-fold, there is a\nnoncommutative CY 3-fold which has an isomorphic Griffiths group.\n  Similarly, one can consider other examples of Fano manifolds with with the\nsame type of variation of Hodge structure as a Calabi-Yau threefold (FCYs).\nAmong the complete intersections in weighted projective spaces, there are only\nthree classes of smooth FCY manifolds; the cubic 7-fold, the fivefold quartic\ndouble solid, and the fivefold intersection of a quadric and a cubic.

We show\nthat the all-loop integrand in N=4 SYM is naturally represented in this way.\nOn-shell diagrams in this theory are intimately tied to a variety of\nmathematical objects, ranging from a new graphical representation of\npermutations to a beautiful stratification of the Grassmannian G(k,n) which\ngeneralizes the notion of a simplex in projective space. All physically\nimportant operations involving on-shell diagrams map to canonical operations on\npermutations; in particular, BCFW deformations correspond to adjacent\ntranspositions. Each cell of the positive Grassmannian is naturally endowed\nwith positive coordinates and an invariant measure which determines the\non-shell function associated with the diagram. This understanding allows us to\nclassify and compute all on-shell diagrams, and give a geometric understanding\nfor all the non-trivial relations among them.

Localizing an\narbitrary triangulated $C$ by a set $S$ of morphisms in the heart of a weight\nstructure $w$ for it one obtains a triangulated category endowed with a weight\nstructure $w'$. The heart of $w'$ is a certain idempotent completion of the\nnon-commutative localization of the heart of $w$ by $S$. The latter is the\nnatural categorical version of Cohn's localizations of rings i.e. the functor\nconnecting hearts is universal among all the additive functors that make the\nelements of $S$ invertible. In particular, taking $C=K^b(A)$ for an additive\n$A$ we obtain a very efficient tool for computing the additive localization of\n$A$ by $S$; using it, we generalize the calculations of Gerasimov and\nMalcolmson.\n  We apply our results to certain categories of birational motives over a base\nscheme $U$ (generalizing those defined by Kahn and Sujatha).

Normal singularities that are\nterminal, canonical, log terminal, and log canonical, and their non-normal\ncounterparts, are typically studied using a resolution of singularities (or a\nsemiresolution) and finding numerical conditions that relate the canonical\nclass of the variety to that of its resolution. In order to do this, it has\nbeen assumed that a variety $X$ has a $\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier canonical class:\nsome multiple $mK_X$ of the canonical class is Cartier. In particular, this\ndivisor can be pulled back under a resolution $f: Y \\rightarrow X$ by pulling\nback its local sections.

By the general theory of derived noncommutative\ndeformations due to Efimov, Lunts and Orlov, the structure sheaf of a rational\ncurve in a smooth CY 3-fold $Y$ is pro-represented by a nonpositively graded dg\nalgebra $\\Gamma$. The curve is called nc rigid if $H^0\\Gamma$ is finite\ndimensional. When $C$ is contractible, $H^0\\Gamma$ is isomorphic to the\ncontraction algebra defined by Donovan and Wemyss. More generally, one can show\nthat there exists a $\\Gamma$ pro-representing the (derived) multi-pointed\ndeformation (defined by Kawamata) of a collection of rational curves\n$C_1,\\ldots,C_t$ so that\n${\\mathrm{dim}}({\\rm{Hom}}_Y({\\mathcal{O}}_{C_i},{\\mathcal{O}}_{C_j}))=\\delta_{ij}$.\nThe collection is called nc rigid if $H^0\\Gamma$ is finite dimensional. We\nprove that $\\Gamma$ is a homologically smooth bimodule 3CY algebra. As a\nconsequence, we define a (2CY) cluster category ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\Gamma$ for such\na collection of rational curves in $Y$. It has finite-dimensional morphism\nspaces iff the collection is nc rigid. When $\\bigcup_{i=1}^tC_i$ is (formally)\ncontractible by a morphism $\\hat{Y}\\to \\hat{X}$, ${\\mathcal{C}}_\\Gamma$ is\nequivalent to the singularity category of $\\hat{X}$ and thus categorifies the\ncontraction algebra of Donovan and Wemyss. The Calabi-Yau structure on $Y$\ndetermines a canonical class $[w]$ (defined up to right equivalence) in the\nzeroth Hochschild homology of $H^0\\Gamma$. Using our previous work on the\nnoncommutative Mather--Yau theorem and singular Hochschild cohomology, we prove\nthat the singularities underlying a 3-dimensional smooth flopping contraction\nare classified by the derived equivalence class of the pair $(H^0\\Gamma, [w])$.\nWe also give a new necessary condition for contractibility of rational curves\nin terms of $\\Gamma$. \n\n"}

This generalises the previous known\nresult, due to Viada and R\\'emond-Viada (who was able to prove the conjecture\nfor power of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication). The proof is based\non the strategy of R\\'emond (following Bombieri, Masser and Zannier) with two\nnew ingredients, one of them, being at the heart of this article : it is a\nlower bound for the N\\'eron-Tate height of points on Abelian varieties $A/K$ of\nC.M. type in the spirit of Lehmer's problem. This lower bound is an analog of\nthe similar result of Amoroso and David \\cite{ad2003} on $\\G_m^n$ and is a\ngeneralisation of the theorem of David and Hindry \\cite{davidhindry} on the\nabelian Lehmer's problem.
