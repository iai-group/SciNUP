The fluid surface\nmodel is investigated within the framework of the conventional curvature model\nby using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations with dynamical triangulations.\nThe mechanical strength of the surface is given only by skeletons, and no\ntwo-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are\ncomposed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a\ncompartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of\ntriangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an\ninhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside\nthe compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.\nHowever, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;\nthere is no specific direction on the surface.

A similar effect emerges in statistical physics, where the force\nacting, e.g., on colloidal particles immersed in a binary liquid mixture is\naffected by the classical thermal fluctuations occurring in the surrounding\nmedium. The resulting Casimir-like force acquires universal features upon\napproaching a critical point of the medium and becomes long-ranged at\ncriticality. In turn, this universality allows one to investigate theoretically\nthe temperature dependence of the force via representative models and to\nstringently test the corresponding predictions in experiments. In contrast to\nQED, the Casimir force resulting from critical fluctuations can be easily tuned\nwith respect to strength and sign by surface treatments and temperature\ncontrol.

Specifically, we study tracer diffusivities, static structure, and\nthermodynamic properties of a variety of one- and two-component model fluid\nsystems with either additive or non-additive interactions of the hard-sphere or\nGaussian-core form.

The effective dielectric constant of the\nsolvated protein, representing the average dipole moment induced at the protein\nby a uniform external field, shows a remarkable variation among the proteins\nstudied by numerical simulations. It changes from 0.5 for ubiquitin to 640 for\ncytochrome c. The former value implies a negative dipolar susceptibility of\nubiquitin, that is a dia-electric dipolar response and negative\ndielectrophoresis. It means that a protein carrying an average dipole of ~240 D\nis expected to repel from the region of a stronger electric field. This outcome\nis the result of a negative cross-correlation between the protein and water\ndipoles, compensating for the positive variance of the protein dipole in the\noverall dipolar susceptibility. This phenomenon can be characterized as\noverscreening of protein's dipole by the hydration shell.

In addition, recursive properties of\nthe transfer matrix allow us to compute the normalisation of the eigenvector,\nand show that it is the product of four Weyl characters of the symplectic\ngroup. The boundary condition of this model lends itself to calculations\nrelating to horizontal percolation. One of these calculations is a type of\ncorrelation function that can be interpreted as the density of percolation\ncluster crossings between the two boundaries of the lattice.

The nonlinear response is\ncalculated for a model of dipole reorientations in an asymmetric double well\npotential, a standard model in the field of dielectric spectroscopy. The static\nnonlinear response is finite with the exception of a certain temperature $T_0$\ndetermined by the value of the asymmetry. In a narrow temperature range around\n$T_0$, the modulus of the frequency-dependent cubic response shows a peak at a\nfrequency on the order of the relaxation rate and it vanishes for both, low\nfrequencies and high frequencies. At temperatures at which the static response\nis finite (lower and higher than $T_0$), the modulus is found to decay\nmonotonously from the static limit to zero at high frequencies. In addition,\nresults of calculations for a trap model with a Gaussian density of states are\npresented. In this case, the cubic response depends on the specific dynamical\nvariable considered and also on the way the external field is coupled to the\nkinetics of the model. In particular, a set of different dynamical variables is\nconsidered that gives rise to identical shapes of the linear susceptibility and\nonly to different temperature dependencies of the relaxation times.

We consider two extreme cases of clock models,\nnamely Ising-like and U(1)-symmetric ones, and find the critical exponents\nusing Monte Carlo methods. The dynamical critical exponent and the anomalous\nscaling dimension $\\eta$ are independent of the order parameter symmetry for\nall values of $s$. The dynamical critical exponent varies continuously from $z\n\\approx 2$ for $s=1$ to $z=1$ for $s=2$, and the anomalous scaling dimension\nevolves correspondingly from $\\eta \\gtrsim 0$ to $\\eta = 1/4$. The latter\nexponent values are readily understood from the effective dimensionality of the\nsystem being $d_\\text{eff} \\approx 3$ for $s=1$, while for $s=2$ the anomalous\ndimension takes the well-known exact value for the 2D Ising and XY models,\nsince then $d_{\\rm{eff}}=2$.

Many\nconcentrated suspensions of particles exhibit an especially dramatic version,\nknown as Discontinuous Shear Thickening (DST), in which the stress suddenly\njumps with increasing shear rate and produces solid-like behavior. The best\nknown example of such counter-intuitive response to applied stresses occurs in\nmixtures of cornstarch in water. Over the last several years, this\nshear-induced solid-like behavior together with a variety of other unusual\nfluid phenomena has generated considerable interest in the physics of densely\npacked suspensions. In this review, we discuss the common physical properties\nof systems exhibiting shear thickening, and different mechanisms and models\nproposed to describe it. We then suggest how these mechanisms may be related\nand generalized, and propose a general phase diagram for shear thickening\nsystems. We also discuss how recent work has related the physics of shear\nthickening to that of granular materials and jammed systems. Since DST is\ndescribed by models that require only simple generic interactions between\nparticles, we outline the broader context of other concentrated many-particle\nsystems such as foams and emulsions, and explain why DST is restricted to the\nparameter regime of hard-particle suspensions. Finally, we discuss some of the\noutstanding problems and emerging opportunities. \n\n"}

In particular, their memory time\ngrows exponentially in the system size due to polynomially growing energy\nbarrier, as in the 2D Ising model and 4D Toric code. Here, we argue that this\nis not always the case. We demonstrate that memory time of classical clock\nmodel (a generalization of ferromagnet to q-state spins) may be polynomially\nlong even when the system possesses finite magnetization. This weak violation\nof the Arrhenius law occurs above the percolation temperature, but below the\ntransition temperature, a regime where excitation droplets percolate the entire\nlattice, yet the system retains a finite magnetization.

We use a representation of the problem via the $CP^{N-1}$ sigma\nmodel in the limit $N \\rightarrow 1$ to determine the stability of this\ncritical point. First we prove that the DS critical exponents are robust, so\nlong as the polymer does not cross itself: they can arise in a generic lattice\nmodel, and do not require fine tuning. This resolves a longstanding theoretical\nquestion. However there is an apparent paradox: two different lattice models,\napparently both in the DS universality class, show different numbers of\nrelevant perturbations, apparently leading to contradictory conclusions about\nthe stability of the DS exponents. We explain this in terms of subtle\ndifferences between the two models, one of which is fine-tuned (and not\nstrictly in the DS universality class). Next, we allow the polymer to cross\nitself, as appropriate e.g. to the quasi-2D case. This introduces an additional\nindependent relevant perturbation, so we do not expect the DS exponents to\napply.

In dense suspensions most of the stress comes\nfrom short-ranged pairwise steric or lubrication interactions at near-contacts,\nso a natural choice for Q is the deviatoric 2nd moment of the distribution P(p)\nof the near-contact orientations p.

We perform extensive numerical simulations\nfor the evolution of P(p) under shear reversal, providing a stringent test for\nFEMs. We consider a generic class of these as defined by Hand (1962)\nconstrained only by frame indifference. Motivated by the small microstructural\nanisotropy in the dense regime, we start with linear models and successively\nconsider increasingly nonlinear ones. Based on these results we suggest that no\nclosed FEM properly describes the dynamics of Q under reversal. We attribute\nthis to the fact that Q gives a poor description of the microstructure during\nlarge parts of the microstructural evolution following shear reversal.\nSpecifically, the truncation of P(p) at 2nd spherical harmonic level describes\ntwo-lobed distributions of near-contact orientations, whereas on reversal we\nobserve distributions that are markedly four-lobed; moreover dP/dt (p) has\noblique axes, not collinear with those of Q in the shear plane.

In umbrella sampling, order parameter distributions\nobtained from adjacent biased simulations must overlap in order to estimate\nfree energy differences between biased ensembles. Many biased simulations are\ntypically required to ensure such overlap, which exacts a steep computational\ncost. We recently introduced a sparse sampling method, which circumvents the\noverlap requirement by using thermodynamic integration to estimate free energy\ndifferences between biased ensembles. Here we build upon and generalize sparse\nsampling for characterizing the free energetics of water density fluctuations\nin systems near liquid-vapor coexistence.

Once all channels are\nblocked no additional particle can enter the system.

To check the\nreliability of the Sonine polynomial solution, analytical results are compared\nwith those obtained from numerical solutions of the Boltzmann equation by means\nof the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method.

If the process is slow, it is in principle possible to focus on the\ndynamics of the number of monomers s on one side of the membrane, assuming that\nthe two segments are in equilibrium. The dynamics of s(t) in such a limit would\nbe diffusive, with a mean translocation time scaling as N^2 in the absence of a\nforce, and proportional to N when a force is applied. We demonstrate that the\nassumption of equilibrium must break down for sufficiently long polymers (more\neasily when forced), and provide lower bounds for the translocation time by\ncomparison to unimpeded motion of the polymer. These lower bounds exceed the\ntime scales calculated on the basis of equilibrium, and point to anomalous\n(sub-diffusive) character of translocation dynamics. This is explicitly\nverified by numerical simulations of the unforced translocation of a\nself-avoiding polymer. Forced translocation times are shown to strongly depend\non the method by which the force is applied. In particular, pulling the polymer\nby the end leads to much longer times than when a chemical potential difference\nis applied across the membrane.

In addition, the cooling rate is also evaluated to first order in\nthe gradients. The results hold for arbitrary degree of inelasticity and are\nnot limited to specific values of the parameters of the mixture. Finally, a\ndetailed comparison between the derivation of the current theory and previous\ntheories for mixtures is made, with attention paid to the implication of the\nvarious treatments employed to date. \n\n"}

The saddle point solution of the resulting\nmatrix field theory reproduces a disordered Hartree-Fock approximation and an\nexpansion to Gaussian order about the saddle point corresponds to a disordered\nRPA-like theory. In the clean limit they reduce to the ordinary Hartree-Fock\nand random-phase approximations.

Using the theory of\ncritical phenomena resulting from positive feedbacks in markets, we confirm\nthis view point for the US but find that mayhem may be in store for the UK: we\nunearth the unmistakable signatures (log-periodicity and power law\nsuper-exponential acceleration) of a strong unsustainable bubble there, which\ncould burst before the end of the year 2003. \n\n"}

In particular, we analyse the topology of Orwell's\n\\textit{1984} focusing on the local properties of the network, such as the\nproperties of the nearest neighbors and the clustering coefficient. We find a\ncomposite power law behavior for both the average nearest neighbor's degree and\naverage clustering coefficient as a function of the vertex degree. This implies\nthe existence of different functional classes of vertices. Furthermore we find\nthat the second order vertex correlations are an essential component of the\nnetwork architecture. To model our empirical results we extend a previously\nintroduced model for language due to Dorogovtsev and Mendes. We propose an\naccelerated growing network model that contains three growth mechanisms: linear\npreferential attachment, local preferential attachment and the random growth of\na pre-determined small finite subset of initial vertices. We find that with\nthese elementary stochastic rules we are able to produce a network showing\nsyntactic-like structures. \n\n"}

We review the extensive experimental and theoretical literature on\nthis problem, with special emphasis on the logical relationship between\ndifferent approaches. The survey begins with the developments of matched\nasymptotic expansions, and concludes with a discussion of perturbative\nrenormalization group techniques, adapted from quantum field theory to\ndifferential equations. The renormalization group calculations lead to a new\nprediction for the drag coefficient, one which can both reproduce and surpass\nthe results of matched asymptotics. \n\n"}

The final pattern consists of a central TCR/MHCp\ndomain surrounded by a ring-shaped LFA-1/ICAM-1 domain, while the\ncharacteristic pattern formed at intermediate times is inverted with TCR/MHCp\ncomplexes at the periphery of the contact zone and LFA-1/ICAM-1 complexes in\nthe center. In this article, we present a statistical-mechanical model of cell\nadhesion and propose a novel mechanism for the T cell pattern formation. Our\nmechanism for the formation of the intermediate inverted pattern is based (i)\non the initial nucleation of numerous TCR/MHCp microdomains, and (ii) on the\ndiffusion of free receptors and ligands into the contact zone. Due to this\ninward diffusion, TCR/MHCp microdomains at the rim of the contact zone grow\nfaster and form an intermediate peripheral ring for sufficiently large TCR/MHCp\nconcentrations. In agreement with experiments, we find that the formation of\nthe final pattern with a central TCR/MHCp domain requires active cytoskeletal\ntransport processes. Without active transport, the intermediate inverted\npattern seems to be metastable in our model, which might explain patterns\nobserved during natural killer (NK) cell adhesion. At smaller TCR/MHCp complex\nconcentrations, we observe a different regime of pattern formation with\nintermediate multifocal TCR/MHCp patterns which resemble experimental patterns\nfound during thymozyte adhesion. \n\n"}

The mean-field level of description allows to highlight the\ndelicate interplay between the different time-scale processes in the resulting\ncomplex dynamics of the system. We clarify the influence of the amplitude and\nperiod of the environmental changes on the critical value of the selection\npressure corresponding to a phase-transition \"extinct-alive\" of the population.\nHowever, the intrinsic stochasticity and the dynamically-built in correlations\namong the individuals, as well as the role of the mutation-induced variety in\npopulation's evolution are not appropriately accounted for. A more refined\nlevel of description, which is an individual-based one, has to be considered.\nThe inherent fluctuations do not destroy the phase transition \"extinct-alive\",\nand the mutation amplitude is strongly influencing the value of the critical\nselection pressure. The phase diagram in the plane of the population's\nparameters -- selection and mutation is discussed as a function of the\nenvironmental variation characteristics.

The conventional\napproach using only the transverse-field term is known to be plagued by slow\nconvergence when the true ground state has strong ferromagnetic characteristics\nfor the random-field Ising model. The transverse ferromagnetic interactions are\nshown to improve the performance significantly in such cases.
