We find\noptimal baselines of about 2500 km to 5000 km for the CP violation measurement,\nwhere now values of E_mu as low as about 12 GeV may be possible. However, for\nlarge theta_{13}, we demonstrate that the lower threshold and the backgrounds\nreconstructed at lower energies allow in fact for muon energies as low as 5 GeV\nat considerably shorter baselines, such as FNAL-Homestake.

The nominal depletion\nvoltage being 3000V, the detector under investigation shows a peculiar behavior\nfor biases around 2000V: in a narrow range of about 100V the charge collection\nis strongly reduced. The detector seems to be composed by two parts: a small\nvolume around the HV contact where charges are efficiently collected as at\nhigher voltage, and a large volume where charges are poorly collected.

With a 10 to 20 kt `pilot' detector and just a few\nyears of neutrino beam running, the mass hierarchy could be determined,\nirrespective of the true values of \\delta_{CP} and the mass hierarchy, at 3\nsigma (5 sigma) C.L. if sin^2 2\\theta_{13}(true) = 0.05 (0.1). With the same\nexposure, we start to have 3 sigma sensitivity to CP violation if sin^2\n2\\theta_{13}(true) > 0.05, in particular testing maximally CP-violating\nscenarios at a high C.L. After optimizing the neutrino and anti-neutrino\nrunning fractions, we study the performance of the setup as a function of the\nexposure, identifying three milestones to have roughly 30%, 50% and 70%\ncoverage in \\delta_{CP}(true) for 3 sigma CP violation discovery. For\ncomparison, we also study the CERN to Slanic baseline of 1540 km. This work\ndemonstrates that an incremental program, staged in terms of the exposure, can\nachieve the desired physics goals within a realistically feasible timescale,\nand produce significant new results at each stage. \n\n"}

Using data taken in 2010, LHCb has applied two\nmethods to determine the absolute scale of its luminosity measurements for\nproton-proton collisions at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV.

Both models find $\\tau_{\\text{T}} = 1.52$ $\\mu$s for the decay time\nconstant of the Ar$_2^*$ triplet state. These models also show that the\nidentification of the \"early\" light fraction in the phenomenological model,\n$F_{\\text{E}}\\approx 25\\%$ of the signal, with the total light from singlet\ndecays is an underestimate. The total fraction of singlet light is\n$F_{\\text{S}} \\approx 36\\%$, where the increase over $F_{\\text{E}}$ is from\nsinglet light emitted by the wavelength shifter through processes with long\ndecay constants. The models were further used to compute the experimental\nparticle identification parameter $F_{\\text{prompt}}$, the fraction of light\ncoming in a short time window after the trigger compared with the light in the\ntotal recorded waveform. The models reproduce quite well the typical\nexperimental value $\\sim0.3$ found by dark matter and double $\\beta$-decay\nexperiments, which suggests this parameter provides a robust metric for\ndiscriminating electrons and muons from more heavily ionizing particles. \n\n"}
{"id": "1408.5536", "contents": "Title: Three-Dimensional Triplet Tracking for LHC and Future High Rate\n  Experiments Abstract: The hit combinatorial problem is a main challenge for track reconstruction\nand triggering at high rate experiments. At hadron colliders the dominant\nfraction of hits is due to low momentum tracks for which multiple scattering\n(MS) effects dominate the hit resolution. MS is also the dominating source for\nhit confusion and track uncertainties in low energy precision experiments. In\nall such environments, where MS dominates, track reconstruction and fitting can\nbe largely simplified by using three-dimensional (3D) hit-triplets as provided\nby pixel detectors. This simplification is possible since track uncertainties\nare solely determined by MS if high precision spatial information is provided.\nFitting of hit-triplets is especially simple for tracking detectors in\nsolenoidal magnetic fields. The over-constrained 3D-triplet method provides a\ncomplete set of track parameters and is robust against fake hit combinations.\nThe triplet method is ideally suited for pixel detectors where hits can be\ntreated as 3D-space points. With the advent of relatively cheap and\nindustrially available CMOS-sensors the construction of highly granular full\nscale pixel tracking detectors seems to be possible also for experiments at LHC\nor future high energy (hadron) colliders. In this paper tracking performance\nstudies for full-scale pixel detectors, including their optimisation for\n3D-triplet tracking, are presented. The results obtained for different types of\ntracker geometries and different reconstruction methods are compared. The\npotential of reducing the number of tracking layers and -- along with that --\nthe material budget using this new tracking concept is discussed. The\npossibility of using 3D-triplet tracking for triggering and fast online\nreconstruction is highlighted. \n\n"}

TetraPhenyl Butadiene has been\ndemonstrated to have an extremely high conversion efficiency, possibly higher\nthan 100 % for 127 nm photons, while there is no precise information about the\ntime dependence of its emission.

This would make WATCHMAN the only detector capable\nof providing both direction and flavor identification of supernova neutrinos.\nIt would also be the third largest supernova detector, and the largest\nunderground in the western hemisphere. In a follow-on phase incorporating the\nIsoDAR neutrino beam, the detector would have world-class sensitivity to\nsterile neutrino signatures and to non-standard electroweak interactions (NSI).\nWATCHMAN will also be a major, U.S. based integration platform for a host of\ntechnologies relevant for the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) and other\nfuture large detectors.\n  This white paper describes the WATCHMAN conceptual design,and presents the\nresults of detailed simulations of sensitivity for the project's\nnonproliferation and physics goals. It also describes the advanced technologies\nto be used in WATCHMAN, including high quantum efficiency photomultipliers,\nWater-Based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS), picosecond light sensors such as the\nLarge Area Picosecond Photo Detector (LAPPD), and advanced pattern recognition\nand particle identification methods. \n\n"}

HPXe chambers are capable\nof imaging electron tracks, a feature that enhances the separation between\nsignal events (the two electrons emitted in the 0nbb decay of 136Xe) and\nbackground events, arising chiefly from single electrons of kinetic energy\ncompatible with the end-point of the 0nbb decay (Qbb ). Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction. Due to electron multiple scattering, this\nstrategy is not perfectly efficient on an event-by-event basis, but a\nstatistical estimator can be constructed which can be used to reject background\nevents by one order of magnitude at a moderate cost (approx. 30%) in signal\nefficiency.

In spite of its large cross section, the\nCEvNS process has never been observed, due to tiny energies of the resulting\nnuclear recoils which are out of reach for standard neutrino detectors. The\nmeasurement of CEvNS has now become feasible, thanks to the development of\nultra-sensitive technology for rare decay and weakly-interacting massive\nparticle (dark matter) searches. The CEvNS cross section is cleanly predicted\nin the standard model; hence its measurement provides a standard model test. It\nis relevant for supernova physics and supernova-neutrino detection, and enables\nvalidation of dark-matter detector background and detector-response models. In\nthe long term, precision measurement of CEvNS will address questions of nuclear\nstructure. COHERENT will deploy multiple detector technologies in a phased\napproach: a 14-kg CsI[Na] scintillating crystal, 15 kg of p-type point-contact\ngermanium detectors, and 100 kg of liquid xenon in a two-phase time projection\nchamber.

The performance\nof gaseous Xe can be further improved by molecular additives such as\ntrimethylamine(TMA), which is expected to (1) cool down the ionization\nelectrons, (2) convert Xe excitation energy to TMA ionizations through Penning\ntransfer, and (3) produce scintillation and electroluminescence light in a more\neasily detectable wavelength (300 nm). In order to test the feasibility of the\nperformance improvements with TMA, we made the first direct measurement of\nPenning and fluorescence transfer efficiency with gaseous mixtures of Xe and\nTMA. While we observed a Penning transfer efficiency up to ~35%, we found\nstrong suppression of primary scintillation light with TMA.

Dark matter Abstract: As part of the T-REX project, a number of R&D and prototyping activities have\nbeen carried out during the last years to explore the applicability of\nMicromegas-read gaseous TPCs in rare event searches like double beta decay\n(DBD), axion research and low-mass WIMP searches. While in the companion paper\nwe focus on DBD, in this paper we focus on the results regarding the search for\ndark matter candidates, both axions and WIMPs. Small ultra-low background\nMicromegas detectors are used to image the x-ray signal expected in axion\nhelioscopes like CAST at CERN. Background levels as low as $0.8\\times 10^{-6}$\nc keV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ have already been achieved in CAST while values\ndown to $\\sim10^{-7}$ c keV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ have been obtained in a\ntest bench placed underground in the Laboratorio Subterr\\'aneo de Canfranc.\nProspects to consolidate and further reduce these values down to $\\sim10^{-8}$\nc keV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$will be described. Such detectors, placed at the\nfocal point of x-ray telescopes in the future IAXO experiment, would allow for\n10$^5$ better signal-to-noise ratio than CAST, and search for solar axions with\n$g_{a\\gamma}$ down to few 10$^{12}$ GeV$^{-1}$, well into unexplored axion\nparameter space. In addition, a scaled-up version of these TPCs, properly\nshielded and placed underground, can be competitive in the search for low-mass\nWIMPs.

To maximize the science return from such a rare\nevent, it is essential to have established classes of possible situations and\npreparations for appropriate observations. To this end, we use a long-term\nnumerical simulation of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) of a 17 solar-mass\nred supergiant progenitor to self-consistently model the multi-messenger\nsignals expected in GW, neutrino, and electromagnetic messengers. This\nsupernova model takes into account the formation and evolution of a\nprotoneutron star, neutrino-matter interaction, and neutrino transport, all\nwithin a two-dimensional shock hydrodynamics simulation. With this, we\nseparately discuss three situations: (i) a CCSN at the Galactic Center, (ii) an\nextremely nearby CCSN within hundreds of parsecs, and (iii) a CCSN in nearby\ngalaxies within several Mpc. These distance regimes necessitate different\nstrategies for synergistic observations. In a Galactic CCSN, neutrinos provide\nstrategic timing and pointing information. We explore how these in turn deliver\nan improvement in the sensitivity of GW analyses and help to guarantee\nobservations of early electromagnetic signals. To facilitate the detection of\nmulti-messenger signals of CCSNe in extremely nearby and extragalactic\ndistances, we compile a list of nearby red supergiant candidates and a list of\nnearby galaxies with their expected CCSN rates.

On the one hand, the CP-violating term in\nthe oscillation probability has a characteristic energy dependence that can be\nbetter reproduced. On the other hand, the second oscillation maximum,\nespecially sensitive to $\\delta_{CP}$, is better reconstructed. These effects\nlead to a significant improvement in the fraction of values of $\\delta_{CP}$\nfor which a $5 \\sigma$ discovery of leptonic CP-violation would be possible.\nThe precision of the $\\delta_{CP}$ measurement could also be greatly enhanced,\nwith a reduction of the maximum uncertainties from $26^\\circ$ to $18^\\circ$ for\na 300~MW$\\cdot$kt$\\cdot$yr exposure. We therefore believe that this potential\ngain in physics reach merits further investigations of the detector performance\nachievable in DUNE. \n\n"}

The low density of the gas leads to very low track energy\nthresholds, allowing the reconstruction of very low momentum tracks, e.g.\nprotons with kinetic energies down to $\\mathcal{O}$(1 MeV). Since different\nnuclear interaction models vary considerably in their predictions of those low\nmomentum track multiplicities, this makes neutrino interactions on gases a\npowerful probe to test those models. The TPCs operate with an argon-based gas\nmixture (95% by volume) and have been exposed to the T2K neutrino beam since\nthe beginning of the experiment in 2010. Due to the low total mass of the gas,\nneutrino argon interactions happen only rarely, compared to the surrounding\nscintillator-based detectors. We expect about 600 such events in the recorded\ndata so far (about 200 in the fiducial volume). We are able to separate those\nevents from the background and thus demonstrate the viability of using gaseous\nargon as a target for a neutrino beam. This enables us to do a cross- section\nmeasurement on gaseous argon, the first measurement of this kind. All previous\nneutrino cross-section measurements on argon were performed in liquid argon\nTPCs. \n\n"}

For sub-keV recoil energies, nuclear\nscattering events in liquid helium primarily deposit energy into long-lived\nphonon and roton quasiparticle excitations. If the energy thresholds of the\ndetector can be reduced to the meV scale, then dark matter as light as ~MeV can\nbe reached with ordinary nuclear recoils. If, on the other hand, two or more\nquasiparticle excitations are directly produced in the dark matter interaction,\nthe kinematics of the scattering allows sensitivity to dark matter as light as\n~keV at the same energy resolution. We present in detail the theoretical\nframework for describing excitations in superfluid helium, using it to\ncalculate the rate for the leading dark matter scattering interaction, where an\noff-shell phonon splits into two or more higher-momentum excitations. We\nvalidate our analytic results against the measured and simulated dynamic\nresponse of superfluid helium. Finally, we apply this formalism to the case of\na kinetically mixed hidden photon in the superfluid, both with and without an\nexternal electric field to catalyze the processes. \n\n"}

This, however, constitutes a change\nof paradigm with considerable challenges to be met concerning the amplification\nregion, the design and bandwidth of the readout electronics, and the data\nhandling. A mandatory prerequisite for such an operation is a sufficiently good\nsuppression of the ion backflow from the avalanche region, which otherwise\nlimits the tracking and particle identification capabilities of such a\ndetector. Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM) are a promising candidate to combine\nexcellent spatial resolution with an intrinsic suppression of ions. In this\npaper we describe the design, construction and the commissioning of a large TPC\nwith GEM amplification and without gating grid (GEM-TPC). \n\n"}

The main obstacle for their operation is the\ndecrease of gain with irradiation, attributed to effective acceptor removal in\nthe gain layer. Sets of thin sensors were produced by two different producers\non different substrates, with different gain layer doping profiles and\nthicknesses (45, 50 and 80 um). Their performance in terms of gain/collected\ncharge and leakage current was compared before and after irradiation with\nneutrons and pions up to the equivalent fluences of 5e15 cm-2.

Consequently\nnon-negligible degradation of azimuthal spatial resolution is caused due to\nthis IBF. Meanwhile, it is necessary to collect primary ionized electrons to\nmaintain intrinsic performance of the MPGDs. The MPGD based TPC is currently\nplanned to be used as a central tracking detector of the International Large\nDetector (ILD), which is one of the detector concepts for the future\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC) project, and which requires fine azimuthal\nspatial resolution of less than 100 ${\\rm \\mu m}$ over the drift length of the\nTPC to attain high momentum resolution. Because of a unique beam structure of\nthe ILC, the IBF is a critical issue for the realization of the ILD-TPC. Not\nonly to suppress the ion back-flow to the drift volume, but also to allow the\nprimary electrons pass through, a large aperture GEM-like gating device has\nbeen developed. Several bench tests for confirming the performance of the\ngating device have been conducted, besides that, beam test with the full\ndetector module equipped with the gating device was carried out to verify the\nresolution that the full module can provide. As a result, it turned out that\nthe developed gating device fulfills requirements for maintaining the\nperformance of the MPGD based TPC, and it has sufficient performance for the\ncentral tracker of the ILD at the ILC. \n\n"}

Unexpected discoveries, such as the\ndiphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the\nconstruction of a photon collider. In order to enable the gamma-gamma collision\noption, the ILC design should be compatible with it from the very beginning. In\nthis paper, we discuss the problem of the beam crossing angle. In the ILC\ntechnical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough\nspace for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions,\nthe crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result\nfrom multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with\nthe opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector\nfield. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.\nIn this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as\nwell as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable\nreduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity. It is shown that the best solution is\nto increase the laser wavelength from the current 1 \\mum (which is optimal for\n2E=500 GeV) to 2 \\mum as this makes possible achieving high gamma-gamma\nluminosities at a crossing angle of 20 mrad, which is also quite comfortable\nfor e+e- collisions, does not cause any degradation of the e+e- luminosity and\nopens the possibility for a more energetic future collider in the same tunnel\n(e.g., CLIC).

These sawtooth-like features\nwill appear in detailed reactor antineutrino spectra, with characteristic\nenergy scales similar to the oscillation period critical to neutrino mass\nhierarchy determination near a 53 km baseline. However, these sawtooth-like\ndistortions are found to contribute at a magnitude of only a few percent\nrelative to the mass hierarchy-dependent oscillation pattern in Fourier space.\nIn the Fourier cosine and sine transforms, the features that encode a neutrino\nmass hierarchy dominate by over sixteen (thirty-three) times in prominence to\nthe maximal contribution of the sawtooth-like distortions from the detailed\nenergy spectrum, given $3.2\\%/\\sqrt{E_\\mathrm{vis.}/\\mathrm{MeV}}$ (perfect)\ndetector energy resolution.

Despite the great\nsensitivity attained after 60 years of developments, the result of the\nexperiments is still compatible with zero. Still, new experiments have a high\ndiscovery potential since they probe new physics at the multi-TeV scale, beyond\nthe reach of direct searches at colliders.

This\nstraightforward mounting results in three important improvements: (1) it\ndecreases the amount of non-active materials needed to assemble the detector,\n(2) it substantially increases the light collection efficiency by minimizing\nthe light losses induced by the mounting structure, and (3) it enhances the\nthermal signal induced in the light detector thanks to the extremely weak\nthermal link to the thermal bath. We tested this new technique with a 16 cm$^2$\nGe light detector with thermistor readout sitting on the surface of a large\nTeO$_2$ bolometer. The light collection efficiency was increased by greater\nthan 50\\% compared to previously tested alternative mountings.

Attaining the target sensitivity requires maintaining an electric field\nof several tens of kilovolts per centimeter across the experimental cell, which\nis nominally 7.5 cm wide and will contain about 4 liters of superfluid. The\nelectrical properties of liquid helium are expected to be sufficient to meet\nthe design goals, but little is known about these properties for volumes and\nelectrode spacings appropriate to the EDM experiment. Furthermore, direct\napplication of the necessary voltages from an external source to the\nexperimental test cell is impractical. An apparatus to amplify voltages in the\nliquid helium environment and to test the electrical properties of the liquid\nfor large volumes and electrode spacings has been constructed. The device\nconsists of a large-area parallel plate capacitor immersed in a 200 liter\nliquid helium dewar. Preliminary results show the breakdown strength of normal\nstate liquid helium is at least 90 kV/cm at these volumes, at the helium vapor\npressure corresponding to 4.38 K. These fields hold for more than 11 hours with\nleakage currents less than 170 pA (about 20% of the maximum tolerable in the\nEDM experiment). The system is also found to be robust against anticipated\nradiation backgrounds. Preliminary results for superfluid show that fields of\nat least 30 kV/cm can be sustained at the volumes required for the EDM\nexperiment, about 60% of the design goal. These results are likely limited by\nthe low pressure that must be maintained above the superfluid bath. \n\n"}

As the data samples are getting larger, systematic\nuncertainties due to the measurement of the jet energy scale assessed using the\ncalorimeter simulation have become increasingly important. In many years of\noperation, the collaboration has gained experience with GFLASH, a fast\nparametrization of electromagnetic and hadronic showers used for the\ncalorimeter simulation. We present the performance of the calorimeter\nsimulation and report on recent improvements based on a refined in situ tuning\ntechnique.
