Unit invariance is achieved by introducing a gauge\nfield called the scale, designed to measure how unit systems vary from point to\npoint. In fact, by a uniform and simple Weyl invariant coupling of scale and\nmatter fields, we unify massless, massive, and partially massless excitations.\nAs a consequence, masses now dictate the response of physical quantities to\nchanges of scale.

The technique maps ever present stochastic spin polarization of\nfree and localized carriers at thermal equilibrium via the Faraday effect onto\nthe light polarization of an off-resonant probe laser and was transferred from\natom optics to semiconductor physics in 2005. The inimitable advantage of spin\nnoise spectroscopy to all other probes of semiconductor spin dynamics lies in\nthe fact that in principle no energy has to be dissipated in the sample, i.e.,\nSNS exclusively yields the intrinsic, undisturbed spin dynamics and promises\noptical non-demolition spin measurements for prospective solid state based\noptical spin quantum information devices.

Repulsion is possible if the medium\nbetween the bodies has a permittivity in value intermediate to those of the two\nbodies, but this may not be a useful configuration. Here, inspired by recent\nnumerical work, we initiate analytic calculations of the Casimir-Polder\ninteraction between an atom with anisotropic polarizability and a plate with an\naperture.

In particular, the\ngoal is to encompass, in a self-consistent scheme, problems like Inflation,\nDark Energy, Dark Matter, Large Scale Structure and, first of all, to give at\nleast an effective description of Quantum Gravity. We review the basic\nprinciples that any gravitational theory has to follow.

In this thesis, we go beyond these\napproximations and analyze the exact 2-field dynamics of hybrid models.

It\nis by now well-known that this puts stringent constraints on the sequestered\nLarge Volume Scenario (LVS), i.e. on LVS realisations with the Standard Model\nat a singularity. We go beyond this setting by considering LVS models where SM\nfields are realised on 7-branes in the geometric regime. As we argue, this\nnaturally goes together with high-scale supersymmetry. The abundance of Dark\nRadiation is determined by the competition between the decay of the lightest\nmodulus to axions, to the SM Higgs and to gauge fields. The latter decay\nchannel avoids the most stringent constraints of the sequestered setting.\nNevertheless, a rather robust prediction for a substantial amount of Dark\nRadiation can be made. This applies both to cases where the SM 4-cycles are\nstabilised by D-terms and are small \"by accident\" as well as to fibred models\nwith the small cycles stabilised by loops. Furthermore, we analyse a closely\nrelated setting where the SM lives at a singularity but couples to the volume\nmodulus through flavour branes. We conclude that some of the most natural LVS\nsettings with natural values of model parameters lead to Dark Radiation\npredictions just below the present observational limits.

A future fault-tolerant quantum computer\nwill use quantum error correction (QEC) to actively protect against both. In\nthe smallest QEC codes, the information in one logical qubit is encoded in a\ntwo-dimensional subspace of a larger Hilbert space of multiple physical qubits.\nFor each code, a set of non-demolition multi-qubit measurements, termed\nstabilizers, can discretize and signal physical qubit errors without collapsing\nthe encoded information. Experimental demonstrations of QEC to date, using\nnuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions, photons, superconducting qubits, and\nNV centers in diamond, have circumvented stabilizers at the cost of decoding at\nthe end of a QEC cycle. This decoding leaves the quantum information vulnerable\nto physical qubit errors until re-encoding, violating a basic requirement for\nfault tolerance. Using a five-qubit superconducting processor, we realize the\ntwo parity measurements comprising the stabilizers of the three-qubit\nrepetition code protecting one logical qubit from physical bit-flip errors. We\nconstruct these stabilizers as parallelized indirect measurements using\nancillary qubits, and evidence their non-demolition character by generating\nthree-qubit entanglement from superposition states. We demonstrate\nstabilizer-based quantum error detection (QED) by subjecting a logical qubit to\ncoherent and incoherent bit-flip errors on its constituent physical qubits.\nWhile increased physical qubit coherence times and shorter QED blocks are\nrequired to actively safeguard quantum information, this demonstration is a\ncritical step toward larger codes based on multiple parity measurements. \n\n"}

In\nthis work, we study the computational power of braiding parafermions more\nsystematically. We make no assumptions on the underlying physical model but\nderive all our results from the algebraical relations that define parafermions.\nWe find a familiy of $2d$ representations of the braid group that are\ncompatible with these relations. The braiding operators derived this way\nreproduce those derived previously from physical grounds as special cases. We\nshow that if a $d$-level qudit is encoded in the fusion space of four\nparafermions, braiding of these four parafermions allows to generate the entire\nsingle-qudit Clifford group (up to phases), for any $d$. If $d$ is odd, then we\nshow that in fact the entire many-qudit Clifford group can be generated. \n\n"}

These systems are generally known as minisuperspace models. One of\ntheir important key features is the invariance of the corresponding reduced\nactions under reparametrizations of the independent variable, a fact that can\nbe seen as the remnant of the general covariance of the full theory. In the\ncase of a system of $n$ degrees of freedom, described by a Lagrangian quadratic\nin velocities, one can use the lapse by either gauge fixing it or letting it be\ndefined by the constraint and subsequently substitute into the rest of the\nequations. In the first case, the system is solvable for $n$ accelerations and\nthe constraint becomes a restriction among constants. In the second case, the\nsystem can only be solved for $n-1$ accelerations and the \"gauge\" freedom is\ntransferred to the choice of one of the scalar degrees of freedom. In this\npaper, we take the second path and express all $n-1$ scalar degrees of freedom\nin terms of the remaining one, say $q$. By considering these $n-1$ degrees of\nfreedom as arbitrary but given functions of $q$, we manage to extract a two\ndimensional pure gauge system consisting of the lapse $N$ and the arbitrary\n$q$: in a way, we decouple the reparametrization invariance from the rest of\nthe equations of motion.

We propose a new resolution\nto the paradox: this violation cannot be explicitly checked by an infalling\nobserver in the finite proper time they have to live after crossing the\nhorizon. Our resolution depends on a weak relaxation of the no-drama condition\n(we call it \"little drama\") which is the \"complementarity dual\" of scrambling\nof information on the stretched horizon.

Given the instability of such a state within the\ncontext of general relativity, this amounts to a very severe fine tuning. Also\nin order to be able to study the dynamics of the universe within the context of\ngeneral relativity, they set the initial conditions for the universe in the\nclassical phase. Here we study the existence and stability of such models in\nthe context of Loop Quantum Cosmology and show that both these limitations can\nbe partially remedied, once semi-classical effects are taken into account. An\nimportant consequence of these effects is to give rise to a static solution\n(not present in GR), which dynamically is a centre equilibrium point and\nlocated in the more natural semi-classical regime. This allows the construction\nof emergent models in which the universe oscillates indefinitely about such an\ninitial static state.

In this\npaper we build a framework for probabilistic theories with non-fixed causal\nstructure. This combines the radical elements of general relativity and quantum\ntheory. The key idea in the construction is physical compression. A physical\ntheory relates quantities. Thus, if we specify a sufficiently large set of\nquantities (this is the compressed set), we can calculate all the others. We\napply three levels of physical compression. First, we apply it locally to\nquantities (actually probabilities) that might be measured in a particular\nregion of spacetime. Then we consider composite regions. We find that there is\na second level of physical compression for the composite region over and above\nthe first level physical compression for the component regions. Each\napplication of first and second level physical compression is quantified by a\nmatrix. We find that these matrices themselves are related by the physical\ntheory and can therefore be subject to compression. This is the third level of\nphysical compression. This third level of physical compression gives rise to a\nnew mathematical object which we call the causaloid.

Yet there seems to\nbe no sensible physical distinction between contradictory and contrary\ninferences.\n  It seems particularly hard to defend the asymmetry, since (i) there is a\nwell-defined quantum histories formalisms which admits both contradictory and\ncontrary inferences, and (ii) there is also a well-defined formalism, based on\nordered consistent sets of histories, which excludes both.\n  In a recent comment, Griffiths and Hartle, while accepting the validity of\nthe examples given in the above paper, restate their own preference for the\nconsistent histories formalism. As this brief reply explains, in so doing, they\nfail to address the arguments made against their approach to quantum theory. \n\n"}
