The gravitational constant turns out to be a shadow of a\ndilaton field in d+2 dimensions that appears as a constant to observers stuck\nin d dimensions. If elementary scalar fields play a role in the fundamental\ntheory (such as Higgs fields in the Standard Model coupled to gravity), then\ntheir shadows in d dimensions must necessarily be conformal scalars.

The CO(J=1-0) emission is clearly resolved in our maps. The\nCO(J=1-0) line luminosity derived from these maps is in good agreement with a\nprevious single-dish measurement. In contrast to previous interferometer-based\nstudies, we find that the full molecular gas reservoir is situated in two\ncompact peaks separated by <~0.4\". Our observations reveal, for the first time,\nthat the emission from cold molecular gas is virtually cospatial with the\noptical/near-infrared continuum emission of the central AGN in this source.\nThis striking similarity in morphology indicates that the molecular gas is\nsituated in a compact region close to the AGN. Based on the high resolution CO\nmaps, we present a revised model for the gravitational lensing in this system,\nwhich indicates that the molecular gas emission is magnified by only a factor\nof 4 (in contrast to previously suggested factors of 100). This model suggests\nthat the CO is situated in a circumnuclear disk of ~550 pc radius that is\npossibly seen at an inclination of <~25 deg, i.e., relatively close to face-on.\n  From the CO luminosity, we derive a molecular gas mass of M_gas=1.3x10^11\nM_sun for this galaxy. From the CO structure and linewidth, we derive a\ndynamical mass of M_dyn(sin i)^2=4.0x10^10 M_sun. Based on a revised mass\nestimate for the central black hole of M_BH=2.3x10^10 M_sun and the results of\nour molecular line study, we find that the mass of the stellar bulge of APM\n08279+5255 falls short of the local M_BH-sigma_bulge relationship of nearby\ngalaxies by more than an order of magnitude, lending support to recent\nsuggestions that this relation may evolve with cosmic time and/or change toward\nthe high mass end. \n\n"}

The source was discovered on 2011 January 11\n(MJD=55572) by MAXI Gas Slit Camera all-sky survey at (l,b)=(238.9deg,\n-25.2deg), relatively away from the Galactic plane. Swift/XRT follow-up\nobservations identified it with a previously uncatalogued bright X-ray source\nand led to optical identification. For more than one year since its appearance,\nMAXI J0556-332 has been X-ray active, with a 2-10 keV intensity above 30 mCrab.\nThe MAXI/GSC data revealed rapid X-ray brightening in the first five days, and\na hard-to-soft transition in the meantime. For the following ~ 70 days, the\n0.5-30 keV spectra, obtained by the Swift/XRT and the RXTE/PCA on an almost\ndaily basis, show a gradual hardening, with large flux variability. These\nspectra are approximated by a cutoff power-law with a photon index of 0.4-1 and\na high-energy exponential cutoff at 1.5-5 keV, throughout the initial 10 months\nwhere the spectral evolution is mainly represented by a change of the cutoff\nenergy. To be more physical, the spectra are consistently explained by thermal\nemission from an accretion disk plus a Comptonized emission from a boundary\nlayer around a neutron star. This supports the source identification as a\nneutron-star X-ray binary. The obtained spectral parameters agree with those of\nneutron-star X-ray binaries in the soft state, whose luminosity is higher than\n1.8x10^37 erg s^-1. This suggests a source distance of >17 kpc. \n\n"}

Surface registration between simple surfaces,\nsuch as simply-connected open surfaces, has been well studied. However, very\nfew works have been carried out for the registration of high-genus surfaces.\nThe high-genus topology of the surface poses great challenge for surface\nregistration. A possible approach is to partition surfaces into\nsimply-connected patches and registration is done patch by patch. Consistent\ncuts are required, which are usually difficult to obtain and prone to error. In\nthis work, we propose an effective way to obtain geometric registration between\nhigh-genus surfaces without introducing consistent cuts. The key idea is to\nconformally parameterize the surface into its universal covering space, which\nis either the Euclidean plane or the hyperbolic disk embedded in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$. Registration can then be done on the universal covering space\nby minimizing a shape mismatching energy measuring the geometric dissimilarity\nbetween the two surfaces. Our proposed algorithm effectively computes a smooth\nregistration between high-genus surfaces that matches geometric information as\nmuch as possible. The algorithm can also be applied to find a smooth and\nbijective registration minimizing any general energy functionals. Numerical\nexperiments on high-genus surface data show that our proposed method is\neffective for registering high-genus surfaces with geometric matching. We also\napplied the method to register anatomical structures for medical imaging, which\ndemonstrates the usefulness of the proposed algorithm. \n\n"}

Recently, Majorana's\nspirit returns in modern condensed matter physics -- in the context of\ntopological Majorana zero modes in certain classes of topological\nsuperconductors(TSCs).

Furthermore,\nsome sophisticated banks are including an FVA (Funding Valuation Adjustment),\nbut since DVA can be interpreted as a funding benefit the oft-debated issue\nregarding a possible double-counting of funding benefits arises, with little\nconsensus as to its resolution. One possibility is to price the derivative by\nreplication, guaranteeing a consistent inclusion of costs and benefits.\nHowever, as has recently been noted, DVA is (at least partially) unhedgeable,\nhaving no exact market hedge. Furthermore, current frameworks shed little light\non the controversial question, raised by Hull (2012), of whether the effect a\nderivative has on the riskiness of an institution's debt should be taken into\naccount when calculating FVA.\n  In this paper we propose a solution to these two problems by identifying an\ninstrument, a fictitious CDS written on the hedging counterparty which is\nimplicitly contained in any given derivatives transaction. This allows us to\nshow that the hedger's unhedged jump-to-default risk has, despite not being\nactively managed, a well defined value associated to a funding benefit.\nCarrying out the replication including such a CDS, we obtain a price for the\nderivative consisting of its collateralized equivalent, a contingent CVA, a\ncontingent DVA, and an FVA, coupled to the price via the hedger's short-term\nbond-CDS basis.\n  The resulting funding cost is non-zero, but substantially smaller than what\nis obtained in alternative approaches due to the effect the derivative has on\nthe recovery of the hedger's liabilities.

The banks and investors share a\ncommon belief about the future value of certain long-term assets, but they have\ndifferent objective functions; changes to this common belief result in\nportfolio adjustments and trade.

At the heart of the mathematics is the challenge of\ndescribing a smooth but potentially highly oscillatory and vector valued path\n$x_{t}$ parsimoniously so as to effectively predict the response of a nonlinear\nsystem such as $dy_{t}=f(y_{t})dx_{t}$, $y_{0}=a$. The Signature is a\nhomomorphism from the monoid of paths into the grouplike elements of a closed\ntensor algebra. It provides a graduated summary of the path $x$.

This leads us to adopt\nthe fractional stochastic volatility (FSV) model of Comte and Renault. We call\nour model Rough FSV (RFSV) to underline that, in contrast to FSV, H<1/2. We\ndemonstrate that our RFSV model is remarkably consistent with financial time\nseries data; one application is that it enables us to obtain improved forecasts\nof realized volatility. Furthermore, we find that although volatility is not\nlong memory in the RFSV model, classical statistical procedures aiming at\ndetecting volatility persistence tend to conclude the presence of long memory\nin data generated from it. This sheds light on why long memory of volatility\nhas been widely accepted as a stylized fact.

Abstract: We present Gemini spectroscopy for 21 candidate optical counterparts to X-ray\nsources discovered in the Galactic Bulge Survey (GBS).

One of the criteria we used for the identification was the\npresence of an Ha emission line. The spectra of several sources revealed an Ha\nemission line only after careful subtraction of the F or G stellar spectral\nabsorption lines. In a sub-class of three of these sources the residual Halpha\nemission line is broad (> 400 km/s) which suggests that it is formed in an\naccretion disk, whereas in other cases the line width is such that we currently\ncannot determine whether the line emission is formed in an active star/binary\nor in an accretion disk.

Their gauge modes, being symmetry\ntransformations, and constrained modes require no additional material\nstructure. We prove that evolution of any origin for which the quantum\nsuperposition principle is absolute cannot be governed by specific laws. In\ncontrast, locally supersymmetric quantum fields that emerge as described from\nthe basic discrete distribution evolve by unchanging and closed physical laws.\nThe emergent quantum evolution is many-world; yet its Everett's branches whose\nnorm diminishes below a positive threshold cease to exist. Then some\nexperiments that for the standard Everett view would seem safe are instead\nfatal for the participants. The Born rule arises dynamically in emergent\nsystems with extended regular past. It and, consequently, quasi-deterministic\nmacroscopic evolution emerge in systems that allow cosmological inflation but\nnot in typical random ones. This resolves the Boltzmann brain problem.

The central agent is stabilized by a bistable potential, the only\nstabilizing force in the system. The local agents derive their stability only\nfrom the central agent. In the mean field limit of a large number of local\nagents we show that the systemic risk decreases when the strength of the\ninteraction of the local agents with the central agent increases. This means\nthat the probability of transition from one of the two stable quasi-equilibria\nto the other one decreases. We also show that the systemic risk increases when\nthe strength of the interaction of the central agent with the mean field of the\nlocal agents increases.

This approach has been extensively studied\nin a univariate setup since the nineties. In the multivariate settings the\ntheory is not so advanced.

In particular: a) the central region achieves the nominal (desired)\nsimultaneous coverage probability; b) there is a correspondence between\nED-based (simultaneous) central regions and appropriate point-wise central\nregions; and c) the method is resistant to certain classes of functional\noutliers. The paper examines the performance of ED and compares it with other\ndepth notions.

The white noise amplitude f(t), called\narbitrage bubble, generates a time dependent potential U(t) which changes the\nusual equilibrium dynamics of the traditional Black-Scholes model. The purpose\nof this article is to tackle the inverse problem, that is, is it possible to\nextract the time dependent potential U(t) and its associated bubble shape f(t)\nfrom the real empirical financial data? In order to give an answer to this\nquestion, the interacting Black-Scholes equation must be interpreted as a\nquantum Schrodinger equation with hamiltonian operator H=H0+U(t), where H0 is\nthe equilibrium Black-Scholes hamiltonian and U(t) is the interaction term.

In this work, we take a step\ntowards understanding what is a robust practice to extract and utilize\ncontextual information to facilitate object detection in practice.\nSpecifically, we consider the following two questions: \"how to identify useful\nglobal contextual information for detecting a certain object?\" and \"how to\nexploit local context surrounding a proposal for better inferring its\ncontents?\". We provide preliminary answers to these questions through\ndeveloping a novel Attention to Context Convolution Neural Network (AC-CNN)\nbased object detection model. AC-CNN effectively incorporates global and local\ncontextual information into the region-based CNN (e.g. Fast RCNN) detection\nmodel and provides better object detection performance. It consists of one\nattention-based global contextualized (AGC) sub-network and one multi-scale\nlocal contextualized (MLC) sub-network. To capture global context, the AGC\nsub-network recurrently generates an attention map for an input image to\nhighlight useful global contextual locations, through multiple stacked Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) layers.

In the first part of the paper we\nconsider an abstract setting, which includes the classical case with a fixed\nreference probability measure as well as the robust framework with a\nnon-dominated family of probability measures. Our first insight is that by\nconsidering a (universal) enlargement of the space, we can see American options\nas European options and recover the pricing-hedging duality, which may fail in\nthe original formulation. This may be seen as a weak formulation of the\noriginal problem. Our second insight is that lack of duality is caused by the\nlack of dynamic consistency and hence a different enlargement with dynamic\nconsistency is sufficient to recover duality: it is enough to consider\n(fictitious) extensions of the market in which all the assets are traded\ndynamically.

Key uncertainties in modeling kilonovae\ninclude the emission profiles of the radioactive decay products---non-thermal\nbeta- and alpha-particles, fission fragments, and gamma-rays---and the\nefficiency with which they deposit their energy in the ejecta. The total\nradioactive energy and the efficiency of its thermalization sets the luminosity\nbudget and is therefore necessary for predicting kilonova light curves.

By\nsetting the wave function $\\Psi(x,t) = e^{iS(x,t)}$ in the quantum\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, a non-linear partial equation is obtained for the $S$\nfunction. For the right-hand side quantization, this is the\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, when $S(x,t)$ is identified with the optimal\nvalue function. Thus, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in Bellman's maximum\nprinciple, can be interpreted as the quantum approach of the optimization\nproblem. \n\n"}

Despite its theoretical appeal, the\nimplementation of a convex risk function remains difficult, as there is little\nguidance regarding how a convex risk function should be chosen so that it also\nwell represents one's own risk preferences. In this paper, we address this\nissue through the lens of inverse optimization. Specifically, given solution\ndata from some (forward) risk-averse optimization problems we develop an\ninverse optimization framework that generates a risk function that renders the\nsolutions optimal for the forward problems. The framework incorporates the\nwell-known properties of convex risk functions, namely, monotonicity,\nconvexity, translation invariance, and law invariance, as the general\ninformation about candidate risk functions, and also the feedbacks from\nindividuals, which include an initial estimate of the risk function and\npairwise comparisons among random losses, as the more specific information. Our\nframework is particularly novel in that unlike classical inverse optimization,\nno parametric assumption is made about the risk function, i.e. it is\nnon-parametric. We show how the resulting inverse optimization problems can be\nreformulated as convex programs and are polynomially solvable if the\ncorresponding forward problems are polynomially solvable.

Various works have investigated the influence of stellar\nfly-bys on disks, although many of them consider only the effects due to\nparabolic, coplanar encounters often for equal-mass stars, which is only a very\nspecial case. We perform numerical simulations to study the fate of\nprotoplanetary disks after the impact of parabolic star-disk encounter for the\nless investigated case of inclined up to coplanar, retrograde encounters, which\nis a much more common case. Here, we concentrate on the disk size after such\nencounters because this limits the size of the potentially forming planetary\nsystems. In addition, with the possibilities that ALMA offers, now a direct\ncomparison to observations is possible. Covering a wide range of periastron\ndistances and mass ratios between the mass of the perturber and central star,\nwe find that despite the prograde, coplanar encounters having the strongest\neffect on the disk size, inclined and even the least destructive retrograde\nencounters mostly also have a considerable effect, especially for close\nperiastron passages.

Since the model is deeply embedded in\nmarket practice, alternative pricing methods for SABR have been addressed in\nnumerous approaches in recent years.

Accordingly, we consider a class of SLV models with stochastic\ncorrelation where all drivers - the spot, instantaneous variance and their\ncorrelation are modeled by Levy processes.

In this context, this paper\nbrings two contributions: first, it shows that despite the recent success of\nend-to-end holistic models, explicit part learning can boosts classification\nperformance. Second, this work proceeds one step further than recent part-based\nmodels (PBM), focusing on how to learn parts without using any labeled data.\nInstead of learning a set of parts per class, as generally done in the PBM\nliterature, the proposed approach both constructs a partition of a given set of\nimages into visually similar groups, and subsequently learn a set of\ndiscriminative parts per group in a fully unsupervised fashion. This strategy\nopens the door to the use of PBM in new applications for which the notion of\nimage categories is irrelevant, such as instance-based image retrieval, for\nexample.

As a result, in such a game, the reward function of each agent,\nat the time of stopping, depends directly on the controls of other players. The\nequilibrium problem leads naturally to a system of coupled control-stopping\nproblems (or, equivalently, Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential\nEquations (RBSDEs)), in which the individual reward functions (or, reflecting\nbarriers) depend on the value functions (or, solution components) of other\nagents.

Here we discuss weak localization and\nantilocalization of massless Dirac fermions in topological insulators and\nmassive Dirac fermions in Weyl semimetal thin films taking into account both\nintrinsic and extrinsic spin-orbit interactions. The physics is governed by the\ncomplex interplay of the chiral spin texture, quasiparticle mass, and scalar\nand spin-orbit scattering. We demonstrate that terms linear in the extrinsic\nspin-orbit scattering are generally present in the Bloch and momentum\nrelaxation times in all topological materials, and the correction to the\ndiffusion constant is linear in the strength of the extrinsic spin-orbit. In\nTIs, which have zero quasiparticle mass, the terms linear in the impurity\nspin-orbit coupling lead to an observable density dependence in the weak\nantilocalization correction.

Among different types of\nrandom number generators (RNG), quantum random number generator (QRNG) is a\nkind of promising RNG as it can provide provable true random numbers based on\nthe inherent randomness of fundamental quantum processes. Nevertheless, the\nrandomness from a QRNG can be diminished (or even destroyed) if the devices\n(especially the entropy source devices) are not perfect or ill-characterized.\nTo eliminate the practical security loopholes from the source,\nsource-independent QRNGs, which allow the source to have arbitrary and unknown\ndimensions, have been introduced and become one of the most important\nsemi-device-independent QRNGs. Herein a method that enables ultra-fast\nunpredictable quantum random number generation from quadrature fluctuations of\nquantum optical field without any assumptions on the input states is proposed.\nParticularly, to estimate a lower bound on the extractable randomness that is\nindependent from side information held by an eavesdropper, a new security\nanalysis framework is established based on the extremality of Gaussian states,\nwhich can be easily extended to design and analyze new semi-device-independent\ncontinuous variable QRNG protocols.

Our purpose is to design a\nHeath-Jarrow-Morton framework for an additive, mean-reverting, multicommodity\nmarket consisting of forward contracts of any delivery period. The main\nassumption is that forward prices can be represented as affine functions of a\nuniversal source of randomness. This allows us to completely characterize the\nmodels which prevent arbitrage opportunities: this boils down to finding a\ndensity between a risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$, such that the prices of\ntraded assets like forward contracts are true $\\mathbb{Q}$-martingales, and the\nreal world probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$, under which forward prices are\nmean-reverting. The Girsanov kernel for such a transformation turns out to be\nstochastic and unbounded in the diffusion part, while in the jump part the\nGirsanov kernel must be deterministic and bounded: thus, in this respect, we\nprove two results on the martingale property of stochastic exponentials.

The available data may be\ninsufficient to determine this distribution precisely, however, and the\nquestion arises: What are the bounds for the option price at a specified\nstrike, given the market-implied constraints?\n  Positivity of the price map imposed by the principle of no-arbitrage is here\nutilised, via the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, to transform the problem\ninto the domain of operator algebras. Optimisation in this larger context is\nessentially geometric, and the outcome is simultaneously super-optimal for all\ncommutative subalgebras.\n  This generates an upper bound for the price of a basket option.

The central bank can purchase\nand sell the foreign currency, and each intervention on the exchange market\nleads to a proportional cost whose instantaneous marginal value depends on the\ncurrent level of the exchange rate. The central bank aims at minimizing the\ntotal expected costs of interventions on the exchange market, plus a total\nexpected holding cost. We formulate this problem as an infinite time-horizon\nstochastic control problem with controls that have paths which are locally of\nbounded variation. The exchange rate evolves as a general linearly controlled\none-dimensional diffusion, and the two nondecreasing processes giving the\nminimal decomposition of a bounded-variation control model the cumulative\namount of foreign currency that has been purchased and sold by the central\nbank.

At each instant of time, the optimally controlled exchange rate is\nkept within a band whose size is endogenously determined as part of the\nsolution to the problem.

In practice however,\nthere is a strong limit on the model parameters that can be chosen, and thus on\nthe resulting WWR impact. This is because only non-negative shifts are allowed\nfor consistency reasons, whereas the upwards jumps of the JCIR++ need to be\ncompensated by a downward shift. To limit this problem, we consider the\ntwo-side jump model recently introduced by Mendoza-Arriaga \\& Linetsky, built\nby time-changing CIR intensities. In a multivariate setup like CVA,\ntime-changing the intensity partly kills the potential correlation with the\nexposure process and destroys WWR impact.

For exponential market makers\npreferences, we establish two effects due to price impact: constrained trading,\nand non-linear hedging costs. To the former, wealth processes in the impact\nmodel are identified with those in a model without impact, but with constrained\ntrading, where the (random) constraint set is generically neither closed nor\nconvex.

Inequality\nconstraints are very flexible because they do not assume exact prior knowledge.\nHowever, constrained Lagrangian dual optimization has been largely avoided in\ndeep networks, mainly for computational tractability reasons. To the best of\nour knowledge, the method of [Pathak et al., 2015] is the only prior work that\naddresses deep CNNs with linear constraints in weakly supervised segmentation.\nIt uses the constraints to synthesize fully-labeled training masks (proposals)\nfrom weak labels, mimicking full supervision and facilitating dual\noptimization. We propose to introduce a differentiable penalty, which enforces\ninequality constraints directly in the loss function, avoiding expensive\nLagrangian dual iterates and proposal generation. From constrained-optimization\nperspective, our simple penalty-based approach is not optimal as there is no\nguarantee that the constraints are satisfied. However, surprisingly, it yields\nsubstantially better results than the Lagrangian-based constrained CNNs in\n[Pathak et al., 2015], while reducing the computational demand for training. By\nannotating only a small fraction of the pixels, the proposed approach can reach\na level of segmentation performance that is comparable to full supervision on\nthree separate tasks.

As compared\nwith the latest version of the model developed in CI2018 and called the ELVG\n(the Expanded Local Variance Gamma model), here we provide two innovations.\nFirst, in all previous papers the model was constructed based on a Gamma\ntime-changed {\\it arithmetic} Brownian motion: with no drift in CI2017, and\nwith drift in CI2018, and the local variance to be a function of the spot level\nonly. In contrast, here we develop a {\\it geometric} version of this model with\ndrift. Second, in CN2017 the model was calibrated to option smiles assuming the\nlocal variance is a piecewise constant function of strike, while in CI2018 the\nlocal variance is a piecewise linear} function of strike. In this paper we\nconsider 3 piecewise linear models: the local variance as a function of strike,\nthe local variance as function of log-strike, and the local volatility as a\nfunction of strike (so, the local variance is a piecewise quadratic function of\nstrike). We show that for all these new constructions it is still possible to\nderive an ordinary differential equation for the option price, which plays a\nrole of Dupire's equation for the standard local volatility model, and,\nmoreover, it can be solved in closed form. Finally, similar to CI2018, we show\nthat given multiple smiles the whole local variance/volatility surface can be\nrecovered which does not require solving any optimization problem. Instead, it\ncan be done term-by-term by solving a system of non-linear algebraic equations\nfor each maturity which is fast. \n\n"}

Heavy-quark\ntransport coefficients extracted from these models with their default\nparameters vary, however, by up to a factor of 5 at high momenta. To\ninvestigate the origin of this large theoretical uncertainty, a systematic\ncomparison of heavy-quark transport coefficients is carried out between various\ntransport models. Within a common scheme devised for the nuclear modification\nfactor of charm quarks in a brick medium of a quark-gluon plasma, the\nsystematic uncertainty of the extracted drag coefficient among these models is\nshown to be reduced to a factor of 2, which can be viewed as the smallest\nintrinsic systematical error band achievable at present time.

In absence of any actions of the\ncompany, the commodity's spot price evolves either as a drifted Brownian motion\nor as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. While extracting, the company affects the\nmarket price of the commodity, and its actions have an impact on the dynamics\nof the commodity's spot price. The company aims at maximizing the total\nexpected profits from selling the commodity, net of the total expected\nproportional costs of extraction. We model this problem as a two-dimensional\ndegenerate singular stochastic control problem with finite fuel. To determine\nits solution, we construct an explicit solution to the associated\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and then verify its actual optimality through\na verification theorem. On the one hand, when the (uncontrolled) price is a\ndrifted Brownian motion, it is optimal to extract whenever the current price\nlevel is larger or equal than an endogenously determined constant threshold. On\nthe other hand, when the (uncontrolled) price evolves as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess, we show that the optimal extraction rule is triggered by a curve\ndepending on the current level of the reservoir. Such a curve is a strictly\ndecreasing $C^{\\infty}$-function for which we are able to provide an explicit\nexpression.

Carbon enhancement at low stellar metallicities is usually\nconsidered a consequence of faint or other exotic supernovae. An analytical\nestimate of cooling times in low-metallicity gas demonstrates a natural bias,\nwhich favours the formation of CEMP stars as a consequence of inhomogeneous\nmetal mixing: carbon-rich gas has a shorter cooling time and can form stars\nprior to a potential nearby pocket of carbon-normal gas, in which star\nformation is then suppressed due to energetic photons from the carbon-enhanced\nprotostars. We demonstrate that this scenario provides a natural formation\nmechanism for CEMP stars from carbon-normal supernovae, if inhomogeneous metal\nmixing provides carbonicity differences of at least one order of magnitude\nseparated by >10pc.

Applying these exact cutoffs to the\nOSUBSGS data yields a comparable optical B-band bar fraction at z~0 of ~\n34%+/-6%.

There is no bimodality in\nthe distribution of e_bar. The H-band bar fraction and e_bar show no\nsubstantial variation across RC3 Hubble types Sa to Scd.

The first represents a dynamical spherical brane carrying a\nnegative excess energy (having a lower bound) with its radius oscillating\nperiodically between two given non-zero values. The second is the one with zero\nexcess energy and whose time dependence can be expressed in terms of a simple\nfunction.

The exact one-point function giving\nthe coupling of the closed string states with the D-branes and the spectrum of\nopen strings is computed.

This last\naspect dominates in noncommutative geometry, where groupoids provide the basic\ntool to desingularize pathological quotient spaces. In physics, however, the\nmain role of groupoids is to provide a unified description of internal and\nexternal symmetries. What is shared by noncommutative geometry and physics is\nthe importance of Connes's idea of associating a C*-algebra C*(G) to a Lie\ngroupoid G: in noncommutative geometry C*(G) replaces a given singular quotient\nspace by an appropriate noncommutative space, whereas in physics it gives the\nalgebra of observables of a quantum system whose symmetries are encoded by G.\nMoreover, Connes's map G -> C*(G) has a classical analogue G -> A*(G) in\nsymplectic geometry due to Weinstein, which defines the Poisson manifold of the\ncorresponding classical system as the dual of the so-called Lie algebroid A(G)\nof the Lie groupoid G, an object generalizing both Lie algebras and tangent\nbundles.

We present here a number of approaches for\nreducing this inhomogeneous broadening, based on trap geometry, additional\nlaser fields, and novel microwave pulse sequences.

{"id": "physics/0602132", "contents": "Title: Are We Observing Violations of Lorentz Symmetry? Abstract: Recent observations of ultra high energy cosmic rays and gamma rays suggest\nthat there are small violations of Lorentz symmetry. If there were no such\nviolations, then the GZK cut off would hold and cosmic rays with energy $\\sim\n10^{20}eV$ or higher would not be reaching the earth. However some such events\nseem to have been observed. This has lead to phenomenological models in which\nthere is a small violation of the Lorentz symmetry or the velocity of light.\nHowever recent Quantum Gravity and String Theory approaches which no longer\nconsider a differentiable spacetime manifold already predict such violations.\nSimilarly there are other theoretical reasons which also point to this. We\nbriefly discuss the various possibilities. \n\n"}
