Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies).

Here\nwe investigate the different mechanisms that could form \"hot Earths\" and their\nobservable predictions.

Models 1-4 have been\nvalidated in previous work. We show that tidal circularization can form hot\nEarths, but only for relatively massive planets (> 5 Earth masses) with very\nclose-in perihelion distances (< 0.025 AU), and even then the net inward\nmovement in orbital distance is at most only 0.1-0.15 AU.

Until\nvery recently, the Galactic population consisted of a relatively well studied\ndisk population, a somewhat studied smaller bulge population and a mostly\nunknown, but potentially large halo population. It has been argued that the\nhalo population may produce a signal that is much stronger (factor of ~5 in\nspectral amplitude) than the disk population. However, this surprising result\nwas not based on an actual calculation of a halo white dwarf population but was\nderived on (i) the assumption that one can extrapolate the halo population\nproperties from those of the disk population and (ii) the postulated\n(unrealistically) high number of white dwarfs in the halo. We perform the first\ncalculation of a halo white dwarf population using population synthesis models.\nOur comparison with the signal arising from double white dwarfs in the Galactic\ndisk+bulge clearly shows that it is impossible for the double white dwarf halo\nsignal to exceed that of the rest of the Galaxy. Using microlensing results to\ngive an upper limit on the content of white dwarfs in the halo (~30 % baryonic\nmass in white dwarfs), our predicted halo signal is a factor of 10 lower than\nthe disk+bulge signal. Even in the implausible case where all of the baryonic\nhalo mass is found in white dwarfs, the halo signal does not become comparable\nto that of the disk+bulge, and thus would still have a negligible effect on the\ndetection of other LISA sources. \n\n"}

By comparing the iron abundances [Fe/H]\nwith calcium triplet (CaT) metallicities we show that the empirical CaT\ntechnique yields good agreement with the high-resolution data for [Fe/H]>-2\ndex, but tends to deviate at lower metallicities. We identify two metal poor\nstars with iron abundances of -2.72 and -2.50 dex. These stars are found to\nhave enhanced [alpha/Fe] ratios similar to those of stars in the Milky Way\nhalo. However, the bulk of the Carina red giants are depleted in the [alpha/Fe]\nabundance ratios with respect to the Galactic halo at a given metallicity. One\nof our targets, with a [Fe/H] of -1.5 dex, is considerably depleted in almost\nall of the alpha-elements by ~0.5 dex compared to the solar values. Such a low\n[alpha/Fe] can be produced by stochastical fluctuations in terms of an\nincomplete mixing of single Type Ia and II SNe events into the ISM.

We demonstrate that rapid (\\Delta\nz< 0.1-0.2), strong (\\Delta T > 10^4 K) photo-heating is difficult to achieve\nacross the entire IGM unless quasar spectra are significantly harder than\nimplied by current observational constraints. Although filtering of intrinsic\nquasar radiation through dense regions in the IGM does increase the mean excess\nenergy per HeII photo-ionisation, it also weakens the radiation intensity and\nlowers the photo-ionisation rate, preventing rapid heating over time intervals\nshorter than the local photo-ionisation timescale. Moreover, the hard photons\nresponsible for the strongest heating are more likely to deposit their energy\ninside dense clumps. The abundance of such clumps is, however, uncertain and\nmodel-dependent, leading to a fairly large uncertainty in the photo-heating\nrates. Nevertheless, although some of the IGM may be exposed to a hardened and\nweakened ionising background for long periods, most of the IGM must instead be\nreionised by the more abundant, softer photons and with accordingly modest\nheating rates (\\Delta T < 10^4 K).

This is\nparticularly motivated by recent indications from HYMORS. Exploiting high\nresolution, numerical simulations, we demonstrate that for both high and low\nenergy jets, always at high Lorentz factor, a transition to a higher density\nenvironment can cause a significant fraction of the directed jet energy to be\nlost on reflection. This can explain how one-sided jet deceleration and a\ntransition to FR I type can occur in HYMORS, which start as FR II (and remain\nso on the other side). For that purpose, we implemented in the relativistic\nhydrodynamic grid-adaptive AMRVAC code, the Synge-type equation of state\nintroduced in the general polytropic case by Meliani et al. (2004). We present\nresults for 10 model computations, varying the inlet Lorentz factor from 10 to\n20, including uniform or decreasing density profiles, and allowing for\ncylindrical versus conical jet models.

Eventually, the inspiraling binary\ndecouples from disk and merges, leaving behind a central hollow (\"donut hole\")\nin the disk orbiting the remnant black hole. We present a simple,\ntime-dependent, Newtonian calculation that follows the secular (viscous)\nevolution of the disk as it fills up the hollow down to the black hole\ninnermost stable circular orbit and then relaxes to stationary equilibrium. We\nuse our model to calculate the electromagnetic radiation (\"afterglow\") spectrum\nemitted during this transient accretion epoch. Observing the temporal increase\nin the total electromagnetic flux and the hardening of the spectrum as the\ndonut hole fills may help confirm a BHBH merger detected by a gravitational\nwave interferometer.

Our model, though highly\nidealized, may be useful in establishing some of the key parameters, thermal\nemission features and scalings that characterize this transient.

A large (~1200 km/s) velocity offset\nbetween the narrow and broad components of Hbeta has been measured in three\ndifferent optical spectra from the VLT/VIMOS and Magellan/IMACS instruments.\nCID-42 is also the only X-ray source having in its X-ray spectra a strong\nredshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing an\ninverted P-Cygni profile. The Chandra and XMM data show that the absorption\nline is variable in energy by 500 eV over 4 years and that the absorber has to\nbe highly ionized, in order not to leave a signature in the soft X-ray\nspectrum. That these features occur in the same source is unlikely to be a\ncoincidence.

And we show that, contrary to\ncommon (but unsupported) beliefs, the interplay between Planck-scale and\ncurvature effects can be significant. Within our illustrative example, in the\nMinkowski limit the quantum-geometry deformation parameter is indeed given by\nthe Planck scale, while in the de Sitter picture the parameter of quantization\nof geometry depends both on the Planck scale and the curvature scalar.

Many of these studies were based on GALEX imaging of SDSS galaxies\n(z~0.1), and were thus limited by its 5\" FWHM.

The new images show that\nthree-quarters of these moderately massive (~5x10^10 M_sun) early-type galaxies\nshows clear evidence of extended SF, usually in form of wide or concentric UV\nrings, and in some cases, striking spiral arms.

We present theoretical\nmodels of this remarkable observation, using SPH cosmological simulations of a\n(50Mpc/h)^3 volume.

An\nimportant property of this `balanced' evolution is that the cluster half-mass\nradius is independent of its initial value and is a function of the number of\nbound stars and the age only. It is therefore not possible to infer the initial\nmass-radius relation of globular clusters and we can only conclude that the\npresent day properties are consistent with the hypothesis that all hot stellar\nsystems formed with the same mass-radius relation and that globular clusters\nhave moved away from this relation because of a Hubble time of stellar and\ndynamical evolution. \n\n"}

In\nthis paper, we report the first simulations in full general relativity of BHNS\nmergers with misaligned black hole spin. We vary the spin magnitude from a/m=0\nto a/m=0.9 for aligned cases, and we vary the misalignment angle from 0 to 80\ndegrees for a/m=0.5. We restrict our study to 3:1 mass ratio systems and use a\nsimple Gamma-law equation of state. We find that the misalignment angle has a\nstrong effect on the mass of the postmerger accretion disk, but only for angles\ngreater than ~ 40 degrees.

As the initial state, an\nisolated cloud core embedded in a low-density interstellar medium with a\nuniform magnetic field is adopted. The cloud evolution is calculated until\nalmost all gas inside the initial cloud falls onto either the circumstellar\ndisk or a protostar, and a part of the gas is ejected into the interstellar\nmedium by the protostellar outflow driven by the circumstellar disk. In the\nearly main accretion phase, the disk size is limited to \\sim 10 AU because the\nangular momentum of the circumstellar disk is effectively transferred by both\nmagnetic braking and the protostellar outflow. In the later main accretion\nphase, however, the circumstellar disk grows rapidly and exceeds 100 AU by the\nend of the main accretion phase. This rapid growth of the circumstellar disk is\ncaused by the depletion of the infalling envelope, while magnetic braking is\neffective when the infalling envelope is more massive than the circumstellar\ndisk. The infalling envelope cannot brake the circumstellar disk when the\nlatter is more massive than the former. In addition, the protostellar outflow\nweakens and disappears in the later main accretion phase, because the outflow\nis powered by gas accretion onto the circumstellar disk.

This\nbehaviour of the entropy perturbations is preserved even when the fields are\ncoupled via kinetic interaction. Since, for assisted dark energy, the\nsubdominant field in the early epoch becomes dominant at late time, the entropy\nperturbations can significantly influence the dynamics of density perturbations\nin the universe.

Trailing the \"normal\" profile\npeak there is an \"intermittent\" peak and these components are flanked by two\nadditional components showing very erratic \"RRAT-like\" emission. Both the\nintermittent and RRAT-like events are extremely rare and are preceded by a\nlarge amplitude glitch in the spin-down parameters. The post-glitch spin-down\nrate is smaller than the pre-glitch rate. This type of relaxation is very\nunusual for the pulsar population as a whole, but is observed in the glitch\nrecovery of a RRAT. The abnormal emission behaviour in PSR J1119-6127 was\nobserved up to three months after the epoch of the large glitch, suggestive of\nchanges in the magnetospheric conditions during the fast part of the recovery\nprocess. We argue that both the anomalous recoveries and the emission changes\ncould be related to reconfigurations of the magnetic field.

The\nkey ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on\nrelatively short timescales, to a point where the radius is comparable to or\nlarger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a\nconfiguration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to\nsubstantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral\ngrazings in an eccentric system could quickly escalate to a catastrophic\nencounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the\nphotosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, as a result of the primary\nstar increasing its own radius.

The moving hotspots are sandwiched between two shocks. An\ninner-facing shock receives momentum and cosmic rays from the jet and creates\nadditional cosmic rays that form a radio lobe elongated along the jet axis. An\nouter-facing bow shock moves directly into the undisturbed group or cluster\ngas, creating a cocoon of shocked gas enclosing the radio lobe.

We carry out the first exploration of what happens\nto the decoupled magnetic flux in 3D, using an MHD version of the ENZO adaptive\nmesh refinement code. The field-matter decoupling is achieved through a sink\nparticle treatment, which is needed to follow the protostellar accretion phase\nof star formation. We find that the accumulation of the decoupled flux near the\naccreting protostar leads to a magnetic pressure buildup. The high pressure is\nreleased anisotropically, along the path of least resistance. It drives a\nlow-density expanding region in which the decoupled magnetic flux is expelled.\nThis decoupling-enabled magnetic structure has never been seen before in 3D MHD\nsimulations of star formation.

DTFE and NNFE are based on the local geometry defined by the Voronoi\nand Delaunay tessellations of the galaxy distribution. The three reconstruction\nmethods are analysed and compared using mock magnitude-limited and\nvolume-limited SDSS redshift surveys, obtained on the basis of the Millennium\nsimulation. We investigate error trends, biases and the topological structure\nof the resulting fields, concentrating on the void population identified by the\nWatershed Void Finder. Environmental effects are addressed by evaluating the\ndensity fields on a range of Gaussian filter scales.

In most tests DTFE, NNFE and Kriging have largely\nsimilar density and topology error behaviour. Cosmetically, higher order NNFE\nand Kriging methods produce more visually appealing reconstructions.\nQuantitatively, however, DTFE performs better, even while computationally far\nless demanding. A successful recovery of the void population on small scales\nappears to be difficult, while the void recovery rate improves significantly on\nscales > 3 h-1Mpc.

It is potentially a reliable tracer of the dense gas distribution\nat high redshifts and could provide an additional probe to the era of\nreionization. By taking into account of the spontaneous, stimulated and\ncollisional emission of the CII line, we calculate the spin temperature and the\nmean intensity as a function of the redshift. When averaged over a\ncosmologically large volume, we find that the CII emission from ionized carbon\nin individual galaxies is larger than the signal generated by carbon in the\nintergalactic medium (IGM). Assuming that the CII luminosity is proportional to\nthe carbon mass in dark matter halos, we also compute the power spectrum of the\nCII line intensity at various redshifts. In order to avoid the contamination\nfrom CO rotational lines at low redshift when targeting a CII survey at high\nredshifts, we propose the cross-correlation of CII and 21-cm line emission from\nhigh redshifts. To explore the detectability of the CII signal from\nreionization, we also evaluate the expected errors on the CII power spectrum\nand CII-21 cm cross power spectrum based on the design of the future milimeter\nsurveys. We note that the CII-21 cm cross power spectrum contains interesting\nfeatures that captures physics during reionization, including the ionized\nbubble sizes and the mean ionization fraction, which are challenging to measure\nfrom 21-cm data alone.

Abstract: Most, if not all, disk galaxies have a thin (classical) disk and a thick\ndisk. In most models thick disks are thought to be a necessary consequence of\nthe disk formation and/or evolution of the galaxy. We present the results of a\nstudy of the thick disk properties in a sample of carefully selected edge-on\ngalaxies with types ranging from T=3 to T=8. We fitted one-dimensional\nluminosity profiles with physically motivated functions - the solutions of two\nstellar and one gaseous isothermal coupled disks in equilibrium - which are\nlikely to yield more accurate results than other functions used in previous\nstudies. The images used for the fits come from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar\nStructure in Galaxies (S4G). We found that thick disks are on average more\nmassive than previously reported, mostly due to the selected fitting function.\nTypically, the thin and the thick disk have similar masses. We also found that\nthick disks do not flare significantly within the observed range in\ngalactocentric radii and that the ratio of thick to thin disk scaleheights is\nhigher for galaxies of earlier types.\n  Our results tend to favor an in situ origin for most of the stars in the\nthick disk. In addition the thick disk may contain a significant amount of\nstars coming from satellites accreted after the initial build-up of the galaxy\nand an extra fraction of stars coming from the secular heating of the thin disk\nby its own overdensities.\n  Assigning thick disk light to the thin disk component may lead to an\nunderestimate of the overall stellar mass in galaxies, because of different\nmass to light ratios in the two disk components. On the basis of our new\nresults, we estimate that disk stellar masses are between 10% and 50% higher\nthan previously thought and we suggest that thick disks are a reservoir of\n\"local missing baryons\". \n\n"}

Young clusters are preferentially located in regions of young star\nformation, while old clusters are distributed over the whole NGC 4449 field of\nview, like the old stars (although we notice that some old clusters follow\nlinear structures, possibly a reflection of past satellite accretion).

This modification of transport processes is of vital importance for\na wide variety of astrophysical processes including cosmic ray transport,\ntransfer of heavy elements in the interstellar medium, star formation etc.\nDealing with these processes one should keep in mind that in realistic\nastrophysical conditions magnetized fluids are turbulent. In this review we\nsingle out a single transport process, namely, heat transfer and consider how\nit occurs in the presence of the magnetized turbulence. We show that the\nability of magnetic field lines to constantly change topology and connectivity\nis at the heart of the correct description of the 3D magnetic field\nstochasticity in turbulent fluids. This ability is ensured by fast magnetic\nreconnection in turbulent fluids and puts forward the concept of reconnection\ndiffusion at the core of the physical picture of heat transfer in astrophysical\nplasmas. Appealing to reconnection diffusion we describe the ability of plasma\nto diffuse between different magnetized eddies explaining the advection of the\nheat by turbulence. Adopting the structure of magnetic field that follows from\nthe modern understanding of MHD turbulence, we also discuss thermal\nconductivity that arises as electrons stream along stochastic magnetic field\nlines. We compare the effective heat transport that arise from the two\nprocesses and conclude that in many astrophysically-motivated cased eddy\nadvection of heat dominates. Finally, we discuss the concepts of sub and\nsuperdiffusion and show that the subdiffusion requires rather restrictive\nsettings. At the same time, accelerated diffusion or superdiffusion of heat is\npossible on the scales less than the injection scale of the turbulence. \n\n"}

We confront\nthese models with both precision cosmological data (probing the CMB decoupling\nepoch) and light-element abundances (probing the BBN epoch). In the minimal\nLambdaCDM model, such sterile neutrinos are strongly disfavoured by current\ndata because they contribute too much hot dark matter. However, if the\ncosmological framework is extended to include also additional relativistic\ndegrees of freedom -- beyond the three standard neutrinos and the putative\nsterile neutrinos, then the hot dark matter constraint on the sterile states is\nconsiderably relaxed. A further improvement is achieved by allowing a dark\nenergy equation of state parameter w<-1. While BBN strongly disfavours extra\nradiation beyond the assumed eV-mass sterile neutrino, this constraint can be\ncircumvented by a small nu_e degeneracy. Any model containing eV-mass sterile\nneutrinos implies also strong modifications of other cosmological parameters.\nNotably, the inferred cold dark matter density can shift up by 20 to 75%\nrelative to the standard LambdaCDM value. \n\n"}

We find that viscosity has\nonly a modest effect on the saturation of the MTI. As in previous calculations,\nwe find that the MTI can generate nearly sonic turbulent velocities in the\nouter parts of galaxy clusters, although viscosity somewhat suppresses the\nmagnetic field amplification. At smaller radii in cool-core clusters, viscosity\ncan decrease the linear growth rates of the HBI. However, it has less of an\neffect on the HBI's nonlinear saturation, in part because three-dimensional\ninterchange motions (magnetic flux tubes slipping past each other) are not\ndamped by anisotropic viscosity. In global simulations of cool core clusters,\nwe show that the HBI robustly inhibits radial thermal conduction and thus\nprecipitates a cooling catastrophe.

We argue that viscosity can contribute\nto the global transition of cluster cores from cool-core to non cool-core\nstates: additional sources of intracluster turbulence, such as can be produced\nby AGN feedback or galactic wakes, suppress the HBI, heating the cluster core\nby thermal conduction; this makes the ICM more viscous, which slows the growth\nof the HBI, allowing further conductive heating of the cluster core and a\ntransition to a non cool-core state. \n\n"}

Twelve new\nspectra obtained from the FEROS, ESPaDOnS, and HARPS instruments, provide\nsufficient material from which to re-evaluate the magnetic field and obtain a\nfirst approximation to the atmospheric abundance distributions of various\nelements.

The magnetic field structure was characterised by\na colinear multipole expansion from the observed variations of the longitudinal\nand surface fields with rotational phase.

To date, our understanding of why Xco should be so\nconstant remains poor. Using a combination of extremely high resolution (~ 1\npc) galaxy evolution simulations and molecular line radiative transfer\ncalculations, we suggest that Xco displays a narrow range of values in the\nGalaxy due to the fact that molecular clouds share very similar physical\nproperties. In our models, this is itself a consequence of stellar feedback\ncompeting against gravitational collapse. GMCs whose lifetimes are regulated by\nradiative feedback show a narrow range of surface densities, temperatures and\nvelocity dispersions with values comparable to those seen in the Milky Way. As\na result, the X-factors from these clouds show reasonable correspondence with\nobserved data from the Local Group, and a relatively narrow range.

The\ncontradiction requires the MacDonald treatment of both non-resonant and\nresonant rotation to be rewritten.\n  The non-resonant case was reconsidered by Efroimsky & Williams (2009; CMDA\n104, 257), in application to spin modes distant from the major\ncommensurabilities. We continue this work by introducing the necessary\nalterations into the MacDonald-torque-based model of falling into a 1:1\nresonance. (For the original version of the model, see Goldreich 1966; AJ 71,\n1.)\n  We also study the effect of the triaxiality on both circulating and librating\nrotation near the synchronous state. Circulating rotation may evolve toward the\nlibration region or toward a spin rate larger than synchronous\n(pseudosynchronous spin).

For\nsmall-amplitude librations, expressions are derived for the libration\nfrequency, damping rate, and average orientation.\n  However, the stability of pseudosynchronous spin hinges upon the dissipation\nmodel.

To model the SEDs we use two different\ntemplate-fitting techniques: i) the Hyperz code that only considers single\nstellar templates and ii) our own developed technique 2SPD that also includes\nthe contribution from a young stellar population and dust emission. The\nresulting photometric redshifts range from z ~0.7 to 3 and are in substantial\nagreement with measurements from earlier work, but significantly more accurate.\nThe SED of most objects is consistent with a dominant contribution from an old\nstellar population with an age ~1 - 3 10^{9} years. The inferred total stellar\nmass range is ~10^{10} - 10^{12} M(sun). Dust emission is needed to account for\nthe 24micron emission in 15 objects.

The proposed function provides an\nextraordinarily accurate description of the density PDFs in simulations with\nMach numbers ~0.1-15 and dispersion in log(rho) from ~0.01-4 dex. Compared to a\nlognormal or lognormal-skew-kurtosis model, the fits are improved by orders of\nmagnitude in the wings of the distribution (with fewer free parameters). This\nis true in simulations using distinct numerical methods, including or excluding\nmagnetic fields. Deviations from lognormality are represented by a parameter T\nthat increases with the compressive Mach number. The proposed distribution can\nbe derived from intermittent cascade models of the longitudinal (compressive)\nvelocity differences, which should be directly related to density fluctuations,\nand we provide a simple interpretation of the density PDF as the product of a\ncontinuous-time relaxation process. As such the parameter T is consistent with\nthe same parameter needed to explain the (intermittent) velocity structure\nfunctions; its behavior is consistent with turbulence becoming more\nintermittent as it becomes more dominated by strong shocks. It provides a new\nand unique probe of the role of intermittency in the density (not just\nvelocity) structure of turbulence. We show that this naturally explains some\napparent contradictory results in the literature based on use of different\nmoments of the density PDF, as well as differences based on whether\nvolume-weighted or mass-weighted quantities are measured.

I:\n  Hydrodynamics Abstract: We use 3D hydrodynamical models to investigate the effects of massive star\nfeedback from winds and supernovae on inhomogeneous molecular material left\nover from the formation of a massive stellar cluster. We simulate the\ninteraction of the mechanical energy input from a cluster with 3 O-stars into a\ngiant molecular cloud (GMC) clump containing 3240 solar masses of molecular\nmaterial within a 4 pc radius. The cluster wind blows out of the molecular\nclump along low-density channels, into which denser clump material is\nentrained. We find that the densest molecular regions are surprisingly\nresistant to ablation by the cluster wind, in part due to shielding by other\ndense regions closer to the cluster. Nonetheless, molecular material is\ngradually removed by the cluster wind during which mass-loading factors in\nexcess of several 100 are obtained. Because the clump is very porous, 60-75 per\ncent of the injected wind energy escapes the simulation domain, with the\ndifference being radiated. After 4.4 Myr, the massive stars in our simulation\nbegin to explode as supernovae. The highly structured environment into which\nthe SN energy is released allows even weaker coupling to the remaining dense\nmaterial and practically all of the SN energy reaches the wider environment.\nThe molecular material is almost completely dispersed and destroyed after 6\nMyr. The escape fraction of ionizing radiation is estimated to be about 50 per\ncent during the first 4 Myr of the cluster's life. A similar model with a\nlarger and more massive GMC clump reveals the same general picture, though more\ntime is needed for it to be destroyed. \n\n"}

Our goal is to trace evidence of an age metallicity\nrelation (AMR) and correlate it with the mutual interactions of the two MCs.\nOur aim is also to correlate the AMR with the spatial distribution of the\nclusters.

The\nselected LMC clusters were observed with the 1.54m Danish Telescope in Chile,\nusing the Danish Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (DFOSC) with a single\n2kx2k CCD, whereas the SMC clusters were observed with the ESO 3.6m Telescope\nalso in Chile with the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (EFOSC).

The requirement that both, the inflow\ninto the black hole and the outflow to infinity pass smoothly through their\nsonic points fixes the stagnation radius and stagnation pressure.

In this model Planck data determine the\ncosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble\nconstant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density\nparameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement\nwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including\ncurvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to\npercent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an\nanalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets\nin addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are\nfavoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral\nindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes\nin the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95% upper limit of r<0.11 on\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like\nrelativistic particles.

{"id": "1303.7162", "contents": "Title: Fritz Hasenohrl and E = mc^2 Abstract: In 1904, the year before Einstein's seminal papers on special relativity,\nAustrian physicist Fritz Hasenohrl examined the properties of blackbody\nradiation in a moving cavity. He calculated the work necessary to keep the\ncavity moving at a constant velocity as it fills with radiation and concluded\nthat the radiation energy has associated with it an apparent mass such that E =\n3/8 mc^2. Also in 1904, Hasenohrl achieved the same result by computing the\nforce necessary to accelerate a cavity already filled with radiation. In early\n1905, he corrected the latter result to E = 3/4 mc^2. In this paper,\nHasenohrl's papers are examined from a modern, relativistic point of view in an\nattempt to understand where he went wrong. The primary mistake in his first\npaper was, ironically, that he didn't account for the loss of mass of the\nblackbody end caps as they radiate energy into the cavity. However, even taking\nthis into account one concludes that blackbody radiation has a mass equivalent\nof m = 4/3 E/c^2 or m = 5/3 E/c^2 depending on whether one equates the momentum\nor kinetic energy of radiation to the momentum or kinetic energy of an\nequivalent mass. In his second and third papers that deal with an accelerated\ncavity, Hasenohrl concluded that the mass associated with blackbody radiation\nis m = 4/3 E/c^2, a result which, within the restricted context of Hasenohrl's\ngedanken experiment, is actually consistent with special relativity. Both of\nthese problems are non-trivial and the surprising results, indeed, turn out to\nbe relevant to the \"4/3 problem\" in classical models of the electron. An\nimportant lesson of these analyses is that E = mc^2, while extremely useful, is\nnot a \"law of physics\" in the sense that it ought not be applied\nindiscriminately to any extended system and, in particular, to the subsystems\nfrom which they are comprised. \n\n"}

The X-ray image shows no compact source that could be associated\nwith an AGN. Instead, the emission is extended -- likely due to nuclear star\nformation and the total measured X-ray luminosity is comparable to the X-ray\nluminosity determined from the 2002 Chandra observations. Diffuse X-ray\nemission was detected close to the circum-nuclear star forming ring. The\nSpitzer 2006 mid-infrared spectrum also shows strong evidence of nuclear star\nformation but no clear AGN signatures.

The GMRT 1.28 GHz observations reveal a nuclear source. In the much higher\nresolution VLA 3 GHz map, the emission has a double lobed structure of size\n2.7'' due to the circumnuclear star forming ring.

Axisymmetric\nsimulations of super-critical magnetized accretion on a non-rotating black hole\n(a=0.0) and a spinning black hole (a=0.9) are presented. The accretion rates in\nthe two models are \\dot M = 100-200 \\dot M_Edd. These first general\nrelativistic simulations of super-critical black hole accretion are potentially\nrelevant to tidal disruption events and hyper-accreting supermassive black\nholes in the early universe. Both simulated models are optically and\ngeometrically thick, and have funnels through which energy escapes in the form\nof relativistic gas, Poynting flux and radiative flux. The jet is significantly\nmore powerful in the a=0.9 run. The net energy outflow rate in the two runs\ncorrespond to efficiencies of 5% (a=0) and 33% (a=0.9), as measured with\nrespect to the mass accretion rate at the black hole. These efficiencies agree\nwell with those measured in previous simulations of non-radiative geometrically\nthick disks. Furthermore, in the a=0.9 run, the outflow power appears to\noriginate in the spinning black hole, suggesting that the associated physics is\nagain similar in non-radiative and super-critical accretion flows. While the\ntwo simulations are efficient in terms of total energy outflow, both runs are\nradiatively inefficient. Their luminosities are only \\sim 1-10 L_Edd, which\ncorresponds to a radiative efficiency \\sim 0.1%. Interestingly, most of the\nradiative luminosity emerges through the funnels, which subtend a very small\nsolid angle. Therefore, measured in terms of a local radiative flux, the\nemitted radiation is highly super-Eddington. \n\n"}

The difference between the\nforward shock emission in a wind-type and a constant-density medium is also\nstudied, and the emission due to Maxwellian electron injection is compared to\nthe case with pure power-law electrons. The code calculates the time-evolving\nphoton and electron distributions in the emission region by solving the\nrelativistic kinetic equations for each particle species. For the first time,\nthe full relativistic equations for synchrotron emission/absorption, Compton\nscattering, and pair production/annihilation were applied to model the forward\nshock emission. The synchrotron self-absorption thermalization mechanism, which\nshapes the low-energy end of the electron distribution, was also included in\nthe electron equation. The simulation results indicate that inverse Compton\nscattering of the prompt GRB photons can produce a luminous TeV emission\ncomponent, even when pair production in the emission region is taken into\naccount. This very high-energy radiation may be observable in low-redshift\nGRBs. The test simulations also show that the low-energy end of a pure\npower-law distribution of electrons can thermalize owing to synchrotron\nself-absorption in a wind-type environment, but without an observable impact on\nthe radiation spectrum.

This collapse of the RS era requires equating\nthe mass scale $m_{\\alpha}$ of the GB modification and the mass scale\n$m_{\\sigma}$ of the brane tension.

This has motivated inflationary models with such sharp\nfeatures. Recently, even the possibility of having nulls in the power spectrum\n(at certain scales) has been considered. The existence of these nulls has been\nshown in linear perturbation theory. What shall be the effect of higher order\ncorrections on such nulls? Inspired by this question, we attempt to calculate\nquantum radiative corrections to the Fourier transform of the two-point\nfunction in a toy field theory and address the issue of how these corrections\nto the power spectrum behave in models in which the tree-level power spectrum\nhas a sharp dip (but not a null). In particular, we consider the possibility of\nthe relative enhancement of radiative corrections in a model in which the\ntree-level spectrum goes through a dip in power at a certain scale. The mode\nfunctions of the field (whose power spectrum is to be evaluated) are chosen\nsuch that they undergo the kind of dynamics that leads to a sharp dip in the\ntree level power spectrum. Next we consider the situation in which this field\nhas quartic self interactions and find one loop correction in a suitably chosen\nrenormalization scheme. We thus attempt to answer the following key question in\nthe context of this toy model (which is as important in the realistic case): in\nthe chosen renormalization scheme, can quantum radiative corrections get\nenhanced relative to tree-level power spectrum at scales at which sharp dips\nappear in the tree-level spectrum? \n\n"}

A possible channel for producing such\nmisaligned hot Jupiters involves Lidov-Kozai oscillations of the planet's\norbital eccentricity and inclination driven by a distant binary companion. In a\nrecent work (Storch, Anderson & Lai 2014), we have shown that a proto-hot\nJupiter undergoing Lidov-Kozai oscillations can induce complex, and often\nchaotic, evolution of the spin axis of its host star. Here we explore the\norigin of the chaotic spin behavior and its various features in an idealized\nnon-dissipative system where the secular oscillations of the planet's orbit are\nstrictly periodic. Using Hamiltonian perturbation theory, we identify a set of\nsecular spin-orbit resonances in the system, and show that overlaps of these\nresonances are responsible for the onset of wide-spread chaos in the evolution\nof stellar spin axis. The degree of chaos in the system depends on the\nadiabaticity parameter $\\epsilon$, proportional to the ratio of the Lidov-Kozai\nnodal precession rate and the stellar spin precession rate, and thus depends on\nthe planet mass, semi-major axis and the stellar rotation rate.

To\nensure robust photometric redshift solutions, and to minimize incompleteness,\nwe confine our search to objects with H_{160} < 28.6 (AB mag), consider only\nimage regions with an rms noise sigma_{160} > 30 mag (within a 0.5-arcsec\ndiameter aperture), and insist on detections in both H_{160} and J_{140}. The\nresult is a survey covering an effective area (after accounting for\nmagnification) of 10.9 sq. arcmin, which yields 12 galaxies at 8.4 < z < 9.5.\nWithin the Abell-2744 cluster and parallel fields we confirm the three\nbrightest objects reported by Ishigaki et al.

Abstract: In $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, structure formation is halted shortly after dark\nenergy dominates the mass/energy budget of the Universe. A manifestation of\nthis effect is that in such a cosmology the turnaround radius has an upper\nbound. Recently, a new, local, test for the existence of dark energy in the\nform of a cosmological constant was proposed based on this turnaround bound.\nBefore designing an experiment that, through high-precision determination of\nmasses and turnaround radii, will challenge $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we have to\nanswer two important questions: first, when turnaround-scale structures are\npredicted to be close enough to their maximum size, so that a possible\nviolation of the bound may be observable. Second, which is the best mass scale\nto target for possible violations of the bound. Using the Press-Schechter\nformalism, we find that turnaround structures have in practice already stopped\nforming, and consequently, the turnaround radius of structures must be very\nclose to the maximum value today. We also find that the mass scale of $\\sim\n10^{13} M_\\odot$ characterizes turnaround structures that start to form in a\nstatistically important number density today. This mass scale also separates\nturnaround structures with different cosmological evolution: smaller structures\nare no longer readjusting their mass distribution inside the turnaround scale,\nthey asymptotically approach their ultimate abundance from higher values, and\nthey are common enough to have, at some epoch, experienced major mergers with\nstructures of comparable mass; larger structures exhibit the opposite behavior.\nWe call this mass scale the transitional mass scale and we argue that it is the\noptimal for the purpose outlined above. As a corollary result, we explain the\ndifferent accretion behavior of small and larger structures observed in already\nconducted numerical simulations. \n\n"}

For example, Lasota & King argued that the\nbrightest known ULX (HLX-1) is a regular binary system with a rather low-mass\ncompact object (a stellar-origin black hole or a neutron star). The predicted\nformation efficiencies and lifetimes of binaries with the very high mass\ntransfer rates are large enough to explain all observed systems with extreme\nX-ray luminosities. These systems are not only limited to binaries with\nstellar-origin black hole accretors. Noteworthy, we have also identified such\nobjects with neutron stars.

Thus the fate of\nrapidly-accreting Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs in the single-degenerate\nchannel remains more mysterious then ever. In this paper, we clarify the nature\nof ignition in Chandrasekhar-mass single-degenerate SNe Ia by analytically\nderiving the existence of a characteristic length scale which establishes a\ntransition from central ignitions to buoyancy-driven ignitions. Using this\ncriterion, combined with data from three-dimensional simulations of convection\nand ignition, we demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of ignition events\nwithin Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs in the single-degenerate channel are\nbuoyancy-driven, and consequently lack a vigorous deflagration phase. We thus\ninfer that single-degenerate SNe Ia are generally expected to lead to\noverluminous 1991T-like SNe Ia events. We establish that the rates predicted\nfrom both the population of supersoft X-ray sources and binary population\nsynthesis models of the single-degenerate channel are broadly consistent with\nthe observed rates of overluminous SNe Ia, and suggest that the population of\nsupersoft X-ray sources are the dominant stellar progenitors of SNe 1991T-like\nevents.

We aim to\ncharacterize the impact of possible accretion variations in a sample of\nembedded protostars by measuring the size of the inner regions of their\nenvelopes where CO is sublimated and relate those to their temperature profiles\ndictated by their current luminosities. Using observations from the\nSubmillimeter Array we measure the extents of the emission from the C18O\nisotopologue toward 16 deeply embedded protostars. We compare these\nmeasurements to the predicted extent of the emission given the current\nluminosities of the sources through dust and line radiative transfer\ncalculations. Eight out of sixteen sources show more extended C18O emission\nthan predicted by the models. The modeling shows that the likely culprit for\nthese signatures is sublimation due to increases in luminosities of the sources\nby about a factor five or more during the recent 10,000 years - the time it\ntakes for CO to freeze-out again on dust grains. For four of those sources the\nincrease would have had to have been a factor 10 or more.

The small-number statistics from this survey suggest\nthat protostars undergo significant bursts about once every 20,000 years.

This is\ninvoked in order to have enough material processed through first generation\nstars in order to form the observed numbers of enriched stars (inferred to be\nsecond generation stars in these models). If such mass loss was due to tidal\nstripping, gas expulsion, or tidal interaction with the birth environment,\nthere should be clear correlations between the fraction of enriched stars and\nother cluster properties, whereas the observations show a remarkably uniform\nenriched fraction of $0.68\\pm0.07$ (from 33 observed GCs).

We propose a\nmethod to compare transiting planets for their potential to support life based\non transit data, stellar properties and previously reported limits on planetary\nemitted flux.

Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we\ninvestigate particle and radiation beaming, finding a very different picture.\nInstead of having a relativistic average bulk motion with isotropic electron\nvelocity distribution in its rest frame, we find that the bulk motion of\nparticles in X-points is similar to their Lorentz factor gamma, and the\nparticles are beamed within about 5/gamma. On the way from the X-point to the\nmagnetic islands, particles turn in the magnetic field, forming a fan confined\nto the current sheet. Once they reach the islands they isotropise after\ncompleting a full Larmor gyration and their radiation is not strongly beamed\nanymore. The radiation pattern at a given frequency depends on where the\ncorresponding emitting electrons radiate their energy.

In our model angular momentum and mass are transported by a\ncombination of gravitational and bar-driven acoustic instabilities. In\ngravitationally-unstable regions the gas can form stars, and the resulting\nfeedback drives both turbulence and a wind that ejects mass from the CMZ. We\nshow that the CMZ is in a quasi-steady state where mass deposited at large\nradii by the bar is transported inward to a star-forming, ring-shaped region at\n$\\sim 100$ pc from the Galactic Centre, where the shear reaches a minimum. This\nring undergoes episodic starbursts, with bursts lasting $\\sim 5-10$ Myr\noccurring at $\\sim 20-40$ Myr intervals.

The idea is that the low-mass,\npre-main sequence stars sweep up gas expelled by the massive stars of the same\ngeneration into their protoplanetary disc as they move through the GC core. We\nperform simulations with 2 different smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes to\ninvestigate if a low-mass star surrounded by a protoplanetary disc can accrete\nthe amount of enriched material required in this scenario. We focus on the gas\nloading rate onto the disc and star as well as on the lifetime of the disc. We\nfind that the gas loading rate is a factor of 2 smaller than the geometric\nrate, because the effective cross section of the disc is smaller than its\nsurface area. The loading rate is consistent for both codes, irrespective of\nresolution. The disc gains mass in the high resolution runs, but loses angular\nmomentum on a time scale of 10^4 yrs. Two effects determine the loss of\n(specific) angular momentum in our simulations: 1) continuous ram pressure\nstripping and 2) accretion of material with no azimuthal angular momentum. Our\nstudy and previous work suggest that the former, dominant process is mainly\ncaused by numerical rather than physical effects, while the latter is not.

We\nquantify the conditions for preferential recondensation to rapidly create\npebble-sized grains in protoplanetary discs and show that FU Orionis type\noutbursts have the appropriate cooling rates to drive pebble creation in a band\nabout 5 astronomical units wide outside of the quiescent frost line from\napproximately Jupiter's orbit to Saturn's (about 4 to 10 au). Those pebbles\ncould be of the appropriate size to proceed to planetesimal formation via the\nStreaming Instability, or to contribute to the growth of planetesimals through\npebble accretion. We suggest that this phenomenon contributed to the formation\nof the gas giants in our own Solar System. \n\n"}

As a first step we assume instantaneous star cluster formation\nand gas expulsion. We draw our initial conditions from observed properties of\nstarless clumps. We follow the early evolution of the clusters up to 20 Myr,\ninvestigating effects of different star formation efficiencies, primordial\nbinary fractions and eccentricities and primordial mass segregation levels.

For a typical Milky Way (MW) satellite ($M_{V} =\n-8$), jointly constraining $m_c$ and $\\sigma$ to a precision of $\\lesssim 20\\%$\nrequires that observations be complete to $\\lesssim 0.2 M_{\\odot}$, if the IMF\nis similar to the MW IMF.

We illustrate\nthat a stable equilibrium of the averaged system (a periodic orbit of the\nN-body model) is surrounded by the region of permanent resonance capture, whose\nsize depends on the migration parameters and the planets mass ratio. A system\nlocated inside this region tends towards the equilibrium (the capture is\npermanent), while a system located outside the region evolves away from the\nequilibrium and leaves the resonance. We verify recent results of Delisle et\nal. and Xu & Lai where they show that for $m_1 \\lesssim m_2$ ($m_1, m_2$ are\nthe inner and outer planets' masses) the equilibrium is unstable when the\nmigration is added, so the capture cannot be permanent.

Studies on optimising interstellar and intergalactic\ntrajectories are usually performed in flat spacetime using an analytical\napproach, with very little focus on optimising interstellar trajectories in a\ngeneral relativistic framework. This paper examines the use of low-acceleration\nrockets to reach galactic destinations in the least possible time, with a\ngenetic algorithm being employed for the optimisation process. The fuel\nrequired for each journey was calculated for various types of propulsion\nsystems to determine the viability of low-acceleration rockets to colonise the\nMilky Way. The results showed that to limit the amount of fuel carried on\nboard, an antimatter propulsion system would likely be the minimum\ntechnological requirement to reach star systems tens of thousands of light\nyears away. However, using a low-acceleration rocket would require several\nhundreds of thousands of years to reach these star systems, with minimal time\ndilation effects since maximum velocities only reached about 0.2c. Such transit\ntimes are clearly impractical, and thus, any kind of colonisation using low\nacceleration rockets would be difficult. High accelerations, on the order of\n1g, are likely required to complete interstellar journeys within a reasonable\ntime frame, though they may require prohibitively large amounts of fuel. So for\nnow, it appears that humanity's ultimate goal of a galactic empire may only be\npossible at significantly higher accelerations, though the propulsion\ntechnology requirement for a journey that uses realistic amounts of fuel\nremains to be determined. \n\n"}

This formalism leads to\npredictions similar to Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in spherical\nsymmetry, but not quite identical. In particular, it leads to a well defined\ntransition between the Newtonian and the modified gravitational regimes, a\ntransition depending on both the Newtonian acceleration and its first\nderivative with respect to radius. Under the hypothesis of the applicability of\nthis transition to aspherical systems, we investigate whether it can reproduce\nobserved galaxy rotation curves. We conclude that the formula leads to\nmarginally acceptable fits with strikingly low best-fit distances, low stellar\nmass-to-light ratios, and a low Hubble constant. In particular, some unobserved\nwiggles are produced in rotation curves because of the dependence of the\ntransition on the derivative of the Newtonian acceleration, leading, even in\nthe most favorable case, to systematically less good fits than MOND. Then,\napplying the predicted transition from emergent gravity in a regime where it\nshould a priori be applicable, i.e. in spherical symmetry and outside of the\nbulk of matter, we show that the predictions for the secular advances of Solar\nSystem planets' perihelia are discrepant with the data by seven orders of\nmagnitude, ruling out the present emergent gravity weak-field formula with high\nconfidence. \n\n"}

Core helium\nburning red clump (RC) stars have similar luminosities, are abundant throughout\nthe Galaxy, and thus constitute good standard candles. We build a hierarchical\nprobabilistic model to quantify the quality of RC stars as standard candles\nusing parallax measurements from the first Gaia data release. A unique aspect\nof our methodology is to fully account for (and marginalize over) parallax,\nphotometry, and dust corrections uncertainties, which leads to more robust\nresults than standard approaches. We determine the absolute magnitude and\nintrinsic dispersion of the RC in 2MASS bands J, H, Ks, Gaia G band, and WISE\nbands W1, W2, W3, and W4. We find that the absolute magnitude of the RC is\n$-1.61 \\pm$ 0.01 (in Ks), $+0.44 \\pm$ 0.01 (in G) , $-0.93 \\pm$ 0.01 (in J),\n$-1.46 \\pm$ 0.01 (in H), $-1.68 \\pm$ 0.02 (in W1), $-1.69\\pm$ 0.02 (in W2),\n$-1.67 \\pm$ 0.02 (in W3), $1.76 \\pm$ 0.01 mag (in W4).

These are dark matter halo\nabundance at high redshifts, satellite galaxy abundance in the Milky Way, and\nfluctuation in the 21-cm radiation background before the epoch of reionization.\nThe thermal inflation scenario leaves a characteristic signature on the matter\npower spectrum by boosting the amplitude at a specific wavenumber determined by\nthe number of e-foldings during thermal inflation ($N_{\\rm bc}$), and strongly\nsuppressing the amplitude for modes at smaller scales. For a reasonable range\nof parameter space, one of the consequences is the suppression of minihalo\nformation at high redshifts and that of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way.\nWhile this effect is substantial, it is degenerate with other cosmological or\nastrophysical effects.

Because the Alfv\\'en speed\nvaries with distance from the disk, the AWs undergo partial non-WKB reflection,\nand counter-propagating AWs subsequently interact, causing AW energy to cascade\nto small scales and dissipate. To investigate this process, we introduce an\nElsasser-like formulation of general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) and develop the\ntheory of general relativistic reduced MHD in an inhomogeneous medium. We then\nderive a set of equations for the mean-square AW amplitude $M_+$ and turbulent\nheating rate $Q$ under the assumption that, in the plasma rest frame, AWs\npropagating away from the disk are much more energetic than AWs propagating\ntoward the disk. For the case in which the background flow is axisymmetric and\ntime-independent, we solve these equations analytically to determine $M_+$ and\n$Q$ as functions of position. We find that, for an idealized thin disk threaded\nby a large-scale poloidal magnetic field, the AW energy flux is $\\sim\n(\\rho_{\\rm b}/\\rho_{\\rm d})^{1/2} \\beta_{\\rm net,d}^{-1/2}$ times the disk's\nradiative flux, where $\\rho_{\\rm b}$ and $\\rho_{\\rm d}$ are the mass densities\nat the coronal base and disk midplane, respectively, and $\\beta_{\\rm net,d}$ is\nthe ratio (evaluated at the disk midplane) of plasma-plus-radiation pressure to\nthe pressure of the average vertical magnetic field.

We invert the\nspectropolarimetric FeI 6302~\\AA\\ and CaII ~8542~\\AA\\ data from the SST using\nthe the non-LTE inversion code NICOLE to estimate the magnetic field\nconfiguration, temperature and velocity structure in the chromosphere. A\nloop-like magnetic structure is observed to emerge in the penumbra of the\nsunspot. The jets are launched from the loop-like structure. Magnetic\nreconnection between this emerging field and the pre-existing vertical field is\nsuggested by hot plasma patches on the interface between the two fields. The\nheight at which the reconnection takes place is located between $\\log\n\\tau_{500} = -2$ and $\\log \\tau_{500} = -3$. The magnetic field vector and the\natmospheric temperature maps show a stationary configuration during the whole\nobservation. \n\n"}

HH 111, with a\nspectacular collimated optical jet, is one of the most well-known Herbig-Haro\nobjects.

Abstract: The first direct detection of the asteroidal YORP effect, a phenomenon that\nchanges the spin states of small bodies due to thermal reemission of sunlight\nfrom their surfaces, was obtained for (54509) YORP 2000 PH5. Such an alteration\ncan slowly increase the rotation rate of asteroids, driving them to reach their\nfission limit and causing their disruption. This process can produce binaries\nand unbound asteroid pairs. Secondary fission opens the door to the eventual\nformation of transient but genetically-related groupings. Here, we show that\nthe small near-Earth asteroid (NEA) 2017 FZ2 was a co-orbital of our planet of\nthe quasi-satellite type prior to their close encounter on 2017 March 23.\nBecause of this flyby with the Earth, 2017 FZ2 has become a non-resonant NEA.\nOur N-body simulations indicate that this object may have experienced\nquasi-satellite engagements with our planet in the past and it may return as a\nco-orbital in the future. We identify a number of NEAs that follow similar\npaths, the largest named being YORP, which is also an Earth's co-orbital. An\napparent excess of NEAs moving in these peculiar orbits is studied within the\nframework of two orbit population models. A possibility that emerges from this\nanalysis is that such an excess, if real, could be the result of mass shedding\nfrom YORP itself or a putative larger object that produced YORP. Future\nspectroscopic observations of 2017 FZ2 during its next visit in 2018 (and of\nrelated objects when feasible) may be able to confirm or reject this\ninterpretation. \n\n"}

We find in this scenario that the hemispherical power amplitude\nasymmetry is strongly scale dependent: $A(k)\\propto {\\rm exp}(-kl)/k$.\nAdmittedly, typical inflation models predict a relic number density of\ntopological defects of order one per observable Universe and so in our model\nthe cosmic string must be tuned to have an impact factor of order $1/H_0$.\nInterestingly, the constraints based on purely cosmological considerations also\ngive rise to a Peccei-Quinn scale $F_a$ of order $10^3$ larger then the Hubble\nscale of inflation $H_I$.

The Planck Multi-frequency Catalogue\n  of Non-thermal Sources Abstract: This paper presents the Planck Multi-frequency Catalogue of Non-thermal (i.e.\nsynchrotron-dominated) Sources (PCNT) observed between 30 and 857 GHz by the\nESA Planck mission. This catalogue was constructed by selecting objects\ndetected in the full mission all-sky temperature maps at 30 and 143 GHz, with a\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N)>3 in at least one of the two channels after\nfiltering with a particular Mexican hat wavelet. As a result, 29400 source\ncandidates were selected. Then, a multi-frequency analysis was performed using\nthe Matrix Filters methodology at the position of these objects, and flux\ndensities and errors were calculated for all of them in the nine Planck\nchannels. The present catalogue is the first unbiased, full-sky catalogue of\nsynchrotron-dominated sources published at millimetre and submillimetre\nwavelengths and constitutes a powerful database for statistical studies of\nnon-thermal extragalactic sources, whose emission is dominated by the central\nactive galactic nucleus. Together with the full multi-frequency catalogue, we\nalso define the Bright Planck Multi-frequency Catalogue of Non-thermal Sources\nPCNTb, where only those objects with a S/N>4 at both 30 and 143 GHz were\nselected. In this catalogue 1146 compact sources are detected outside the\nadopted Planck GAL070 mask; thus, these sources constitute a highly reliable\nsample of extragalactic radio sources.

Since the amount of ionized material is controlled by the\ndynamics of the reverse shock, we find the DM changes more slowly than in\nprevious simpler work, which simply assumed a constant ionization fraction.\nFurthermore, the DM can be constant or even increasing as the supernova remnant\nsweeps up material, arguing that a young neutron star hypothesis for FRBs is\nnot ruled out if the DM is not decreasing over repeated bursts.

Only about ten per cent of the hydrogen recombination energy might\nbe used to remove the envelope. We show that the key property of energy\ntransport is that when convection becomes inefficient in the outer parts of the\nenvelope, where the ionization degree of hydrogen falls below about 30 per\ncent, photon diffusion becomes very efficient and removes the recombination\nenergy. The expanding envelope absorbs most of the gravitational energy that is\nreleased by the spiraling-in process of the secondary star inside the common\nenvelope, and so it is the hydrogen recombination energy that is behind most of\nthe luminosity increase of the system. The recombination energy of hydrogen\nadds only a small fraction of the energy required to remove the common\nenvelope, and hence does not play a significant role in the ejection of the\nenvelope. \n\n"}

Depending on the interstellar polarisation estimate, the intrinsic\npolarisation degree of the source is between $\\sim$0.3% and 0.7%, and the\npolarisation position angle is between $\\sim10\\deg-30\\deg$. We show that the\npolarisation increases after MJD 58222 (2018 April 14). The change is of the\norder of 0.1% and is most pronounced in the R band. The change of the source\nStokes parameters occurs simultaneously with the drop of the observed V-band\nflux and a slow softening of the X-ray spectrum. The Stokes vectors of\nintrinsic polarisation before and after the drop are parallel, at least in the\nV and R filters. Conclusions. We suggest that the increased polarisation is due\nto the decreasing contribution of the non-polarized component, which we\nassociate with the the hot flow or jet emission. The low polarisation can\nresult from the tangled geometry of the magnetic field or from the Faraday\nrotation in the dense, ionised, and magnetised medium close to the black hole.\nThe polarized optical emission is likely produced by the irradiated disc or by\nscattering of its radiation in the optically thin outflow. \n\n"}

The most puzzling aspects are 1) how the Tethys-Dione pair and\nthe Mimas-Enceladus pair passed through their strong 3:2 mean-motion resonances\nduring the tidal orbital evolution, and 2) the current strong heat flow from\nEnceladus, which is a few orders of magnitude higher than the tidal energy\ndissipation caused by the present orbital eccentricity of Enceladus. Here we\nperform N-body simulations of the moons' orbital evolution from various initial\nconditions -- assuming that the moons were formed from Saturn's hypothetical\nmassive ring -- and investigate possible paths to solve the above difficulties.\nIf the influence of the rings is neglected, we find that the Tethys-Dione pair\ncannot avoid becoming trapped in the mean-motion resonances as they recede from\nSaturn, and that the Tethys-Enceladus pair cannot avoid collisions after the\nresonance trapping, in case Saturn's quality factor is smaller than 15,000.\nThese findings are inconsistent with the current orbital configuration.\nHowever, taking into account both the eccentricity excitation and the orbital\nexpansion caused by the ring torque, we find that these resonance captures are\navoided. With the high eccentricity pumped up by the torque, Enceladus passes\nthrough the resonances with Tethys, and the Dione-Tethys pair passes through\ntheir 2:1 and possibly the 3:2 resonance as well. After Enceladus resides\nbeyond the 2:1 resonance with the outer ring edge, the eccentricity can be\ntidally damped. While this is a promising path of evolution, in most runs,\nEnceladus collides with Tethys by the excited eccentricity. There is a hint\nthat a ring mass decrease could avoid the collision. The tidal heat due to the\neccentricity excitation by the ring torque is stored in the moons and slowly\nradiated away. It may account for the current high heat flow. \n\n"}

We find that the expulsion of dust\nand its subsequent (partial) destruction in the IGM can plausibly account for\nthe observed level of C and Si enrichment of the z=3 IGM. At low-z, dust\nejection and destruction could explain a substantial fraction of the metals in\nclusters, but it cannot account for all of the chemical species observed. Dust\nexpelled by radiation pressure could give clusters a visual opacity of up to\n0.2-0.5 mag in their central regions even after destruction by the hot\nintracluster medium; this value is interestingly close to limits and claimed\nobservations of cluster extinction.

We have analyzed ~545ks of data\nof this source obtained with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer over a 3 year span\nfrom 1996-1999. The data contain 38 bursts, 16 of which show NCOs.

If dust temperature T_d and emissivity\nindex beta in cB58 are similar to those seen in local IRAS-seleceted galaxies,\nthen cB58's dust mass is M_d <~ 10^7.7 Msun and its star formation rate is SFR\n<~ 10 Msun/yr (for q_0=0.1, H_0=75 km/s/Mpc).

{"id": "astro-ph/0110081", "contents": "Title: Magnetized Turbulent Dynamo in Protogalaxies Abstract: The prevailing theory for the origin of cosmic magnetic fields is that they\nhave been amplified to their present values by the turbulent dynamo inductive\naction in the protogalactic and galactic medium. Up to now, in calculation of\nthe turbulent dynamo, it has been customary to assume that there is no the back\nreaction of the magnetic field on the turbulence, as long as the magnetic\nenergy is less than the turbulent kinetic energy. This assumption leads to the\nkinematic dynamo theory. However, the applicability of the kinematic dynamo\ntheory to protogalaxies is rather limited. The reason is that in protogalaxies\nthe temperature is very high, and the viscosity is dominated by ions. As the\nmagnetic field strength grows in time, the ion cyclotron time becomes shorter\nthan the ion collision time, and the plasma becomes strongly magnetized. As a\nresult, the ion viscosity becomes the Braginskii viscosity. Thus, in\nprotogalaxies the back reaction sets in much earlier, at field strengths much\nlower than the energy equipartition field strengths, and the turbulent dynamo\nbecomes what we call the magnetized turbulent dynamo. The purpose of this\nthesis is to lay the theoretical groundwork for the magnetized turbulent\ndynamo. In particular, we predict that the magnetic energy growth rate in the\nmagnetized dynamo theory is up to ten time larger than that in the kinematic\ndynamo theory. We also briefly discuss how the Braginskii viscosity can aid the\ndevelopment of the inverse cascade of magnetic energy after the energy\nequipartition time. \n\n"}

One factor that could have a significant effect on the\naction of the r-mode instability is fallback of supernova remnant material. The\nassociated accretion torque could potentially counteract any gravitational-wave\ninduced spin-down, and accretion heating could affect the viscous damping rates\nand hence the instability. We discuss the effects of various external agents on\nthe r-mode instability scenario within a simple model of supernova fallback on\nto a hot young magnetized neutron star. We find that the outcome depends\nstrongly on the strength of the star's magnetic field. Our model is capable of\ngenerating spin rates for young neutron stars that accord well with initial\nspin rates inferred from pulsar observations. The combined action of r-mode\ninstability and fallback appears to cause the spin rates of neutron stars born\nwith very different spin rates to converge, on a timescale of about a year. The\nresults suggest that stars with magnetic fields $\\le10^{13}$ G could emit a\ndetectable gravitational wave signal for perhaps several years after the\nsupernova event. Stars with higher fields (magnetars) are unlikely to emit a\ndetectable gravitational wave signal via the r-mode instability.

A flatter halo core with $\\alpha <1$ exerts on\nthe satellites tidal compression in all directions, which prevents deposit of\nstripped satellite material in the core region. This makes the satellite orbits\ndecay from the radius where $\\alpha \\sim 1$ to the halo centre with no local\ntidal mass transfer and thus causes a rapid steepening of the inner profile to\n$\\alpha >1$. These tidal effects, the resultant steepening of the profile to a\ncusp, and the stability of this cusp to tandem mergers with compact satellites,\nare demonstrated using N-body simulations. The transition at $\\alpha \\sim 1$ is\nthen addressed using toy models in the limiting cases of impulse and adiabatic\napproximations and using tidal radii for satellites on radial and circular\norbits. In an associated paper we address the subsequent slow convergence from\neither side to an asymptotic stable cusp with $\\alpha \\gsim 1$. Our analysis\nthus implies that an inner cusp is enforced when small haloes are typically\nmore compact than larger haloes, as in the CDM scenario, such that enough\nsatellite material makes it intact into the inner halo and is deposited there.\nWe conclude that a necessary condition for maintaining a flat core, as\nindicated by observations, is that the inner regions of the CDM satellite\nhaloes be puffed up by about 50% such that when they merge into a bigger halo\nthey would be disrupted outside the halo core.

Abstract: Spectroscopic redshifts have been measured for 9 K-band luminous galaxies at\n1.7 < z < 2.3, selected with Ks < 20 in the \"K20 survey\" region of the Great\nObservatories Origins Deep Survey area. Star formation rates (SFRs) of ~100-500\nMsun/yr are derived when dust extinction is taken into account. The fitting of\ntheir multi-color spectral energy distributions indicates stellar masses M ~\n10^11 Msun for most of the galaxies.

One objective is to characterize the intrinsic X-ray emission\nfrom the central black hole, SgrA*, in its quiescent and flaring states. We\ncorrect the fluxes observed by the Chandra and XMM telescopes for absorption\nand scattering, using realistic models for the dust grain size distribution,\ngas and dust abundances and spatial distributions. However, there are still\nlarge uncertainties. Since much of the intervening dust is close to SgrA*, the\nscattered halo of X-ray photons is very concentrated: its intensity can\ndominate the Chandra PSF inside 1\", and so affects estimates of the point\nsource flux. It also broadens the radial intensity profiles of Galactic center\nsources - observations of this effect can help constrain models of the spatial\ndistribution of the dust. We estimate that the combined scattering halos from\nobserved Galactic center sources within 10\" of SgrA* contribute up to ~10% of\nthe observed diffuse emission in this region. Dust-scattered photons suffer a\ntime delay relative to the photons that arrive directly.

However,the shape\nand peak metallicity for this region are entirely similar to those found in\nother studies for the inner regions of the M31 halo, particularly our previous\nstudy of a 20-kpc region (Durrell, Harris, & Pritchet 2001) employing similar\ndata. In summary, we find no evidence for a metallicity gradient or systematic\nchange in the MDF out to quite large distances in the M31 halo: it appears to\nbe a homogeneous and moderately metal-rich subsystem of the galaxy at all\nlocations. The star counts in the 30-kpc field are also consistent with the\nr^1/4 law that fits the interior regions of the M31 spheroid surface brightness\nprofile. The metal-rich MDF and the r^1/4 spheroid suggests M31 more strongly\nresembles a giant elliptical galaxy than other, Milky-Way-like, spirals. \n\n"}

We replace blackbody\nradiation under diffusion approximation with a bridged formula, which accounts\nfor both blackbody radiation and thermal bremsstrahlung in optically-thick and\n-thin cases, respectively. Thus this allows us to investigate the structures of\nand the emergent spectra from slim disks in a wider parameter space, covering\ntransition regions from optically thick to optically thin.

The\n  case of uniform precession Abstract: It was believed until very recently that a near-equatorial satellite would\nalways keep up with the planet's equator (with oscillations in inclination, but\nwithout a secular drift). As explained in Efroimsky and Goldreich (2004), this\nopinion originated from a wrong interpretation of a (mathematically correct)\nresult obtained in terms of non-osculating orbital elements. A similar analysis\ncarried out in the language of osculating elements will endow the planetary\nequations with some extra terms caused by the planet's obliquity change. Some\nof these terms will be nontrivial, in that they will not be amendments to the\ndisturbing function. Due to the extra terms, the variations of a planet's\nobliquity may cause a secular drift of its satellite orbit inclination. In this\narticle we set out the analytical formalism for our study of this drift. We\ndemonstrate that, in the case of uniform precession, the drift will be\nextremely slow, because the first-order terms responsible for the drift will be\nshort-period and, thus, will have vanishing orbital averages (as anticipated 40\nyears ago by Peter Goldreich), while the secular terms will be of the second\norder only. However, it turns out that variations of the planetary precession\nmake the first-order terms secular. For example, the planetary nutations will\nresonate with the satellite's orbital frequency and, thereby, may instigate a\nsecular drift. A detailed study of this process will be offered in the\nsubsequent publication, while here we work out the required mathematical\nformalism and point out the key aspects of the dynamics. \n\n"}

For this purpose, a phenomenological approach based on the\nhalo model has been developed, allowing for fast exploration of the parameter\nspace of models.

For model (a), if power-law\nbehavior holds with finite 8-th moment, excess kurtosis is an asymptotically\noptimal detector, but if the 8-th moment is not finite, a test based on extreme\nvalues is asymptotically optimal. For model (b), if the transform coefficients\nare very sparse, a recent test, Higher Criticism, is an optimal detector, but\nif they are dense, kurtosis is an optimal detector.

For T Tauri disks, the lifetimes of dust disks\nthat are mainly composed of millimeter sized grains are always shorter than the\ngas disks' lifetimes, and become similar only when the grains are fluffy\n(density < 0.1 g cm^{-3}). If grain growth during the classical T Tauri phase\nproduces plenty of millimeter sized grains, such grains completely accrete onto\nthe star in 10^7 yr, before photoevaporation begins to drain the inner gas disk\nand the star evolves to the weak line T Tauri phase. In the weak line phase,\nonly dust-poor gas disks remain at large radii (> 10 AU), without strong signs\nof gas accretion nor of millimeter thermal emission from the dust. For Herbig\nAeBe stars, the strong photoevaporation clears the inner disks in 10^6 yr,\nbefore the dust grains in the outer disk migrate to the inner region. In this\ncase, the grains left behind in the outer gas disk accumulate at the disk inner\nedge (at 10-100 AU from the star). The dust grains remain there even after the\nentire gas disk has been photoevaporated, and form a gas-poor dust ring similar\nto that observed around HR 4796A. Hence, depending on the strength of the\nstellar ionizing flux, our model predicts opposite types of products around\nyoung stars. For low mass stars with a low photoevaporation rate, dust-poor gas\ndisks with an inner hole would form, whereas for high mass stars with a high\nphotoevaporation rate, gas-poor dust rings would form. This prediction should\nbe examined by observations of gas and dust around weak line T Tauri stars and\nevolved Herbig AeBe stars. \n\n"}

This is the largest sample\nof galaxies to z ~ 1 with kinematics to date, and allows us to measure\nkinematic properties without morphological pre-selection.

Integrated linewidth correlates well with a combination of\nthe rotation gradient and dispersion, and is a robust measure of galaxy\nkinematics. The spatial extents of emission and continuum are similar and there\nis no evidence that linewidths are affected by nuclear or clumpy emission. The\nmeasured rotation gradient depends strongly on slit PA alignment with galaxy\nmajor axis, but integrated linewidth does not.

For $\\nu < 1$, the Lorentz\nfactor follows the same scaling for $z/\\Rfp < M^{-1/(1-\\nu)}$, but at larger\ndistances it grows more slowly: $\\gamma \\approx (z/\\Rfp)^{\\nu/2}$. For either\nregime of $\\nu$, the dependence of $\\gamma$ on $M$ shows that the rotation of\nthe disk plays a strong role in jet acceleration. On the other hand, the\npoloidal shape of a field line is given by $z/\\Rfp \\approx\n(R/\\Rfp)^{2/(2-\\nu)}$ and is independent of $M$. Thus rotation has neither a\ncollimating nor a decollimating effect on field lines, suggesting that\nrelativistic astrophysical jets are not collimated by the rotational winding up\nof the magnetic field. \n\n"}

In this work, we find that, as a function of spectral index n,\nthe one-loop bispectrum follows a pattern analogous to that of the one-loop\npower spectrum, which shows a change in behavior at a critical index n_c =\n-1.4, where non-linear corrections vanish. For the bispectrum, for n less than\nn_c, one-loop corrections increase the configuration dependence of the leading\norder contribution; for n greater than n_c, one-loop corrections tend to cancel\nthe configuration dependence of the tree-level bispectrum, in agreement with\nknown results from n=-1 numerical simulations. A similar situation is shown to\nhold for the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA), where n_c = -1.75. Using\ndimensional regularization, we obtain explicit analytic expressions for the\none-loop bispectrum for n=-2 initial power spectra, for both the exact dynamics\nof gravitational instability and the ZA.

We demonstrate using hydrodynamic simulations of\ngalaxy formation in a cosmological context that irregular protogalactic clumps\ncan reproduce the observed velocity width distribution and asymmetries of the\nabsorption profiles equally well. The velocity broadening in the simulated\nclumps is due to a mixture of rotation, random motions, infall and merging. The\nobserved velocity width correlates with the virial velocity of the dark matter\nhalo of the forming protogalactic clump (v_{wid} ~ 0.6 times v_{vir} for the\nmedian values with a large scatter of order a factor two between different\nlines-of-sight). The typical virial velocity of the halos required to give rise\nto the DLAS population is about 100 km/s and most standard hierarchical\nstructure formation scenarios can easily account even for the largest observed\nvelocity widths.

Previous studies of this problem have incorporated gravitational\ndynamics and adiabatic gas dynamics, but radiative cooling, an essential\nelement of the physics of galaxy formation, normally violates the conditions\nnecessary for self-similar evolution. We show that for any specified value of\nthe initial power spectrum index n [where P(k)~k^n], there is a family of\npower-law cooling functions that preserves self-similarity by ensuring that the\ncooling time in an object of the characteristic mass M_* is a fixed fraction\nt_C of the Hubble time. We perform hydrodynamic numerical simulations with an\nEinstein-de Sitter cosmology, a baryon fraction of 5%, Gaussian initial\nconditions, two different power spectrum indices, and four values of t_C for\neach index, ranging from no cooling to strong cooling. We restrict the\nnumerical simulations to two dimensions in order to allow exploration of a wide\nparameter space with adequate dynamic range. In all cases, the simulations are\nremarkably successful at reproducing the analytically predicted scalings of the\nmass function of dissipated objects and the gas temperature distributions and\ncooled gas fractions in collapsed systems.

Because $\\tilde{b}^{(n)}_j$ with\ndifferent $n$ are independent from each other, a systematic analysis of the\n$j$-spectra of $\\tilde{b}^{(n)}_j$ and $b_j^{(n)}$ is necessary.

The neutrino\nflux is generated inside the neutron star core and is transported through the\natmosphere at a constant luminosity, forcing the temperature gradient in the\natmosphere to adjust to the inflow of energy from below.

The high reflectivity of this\nputative disc, together with its strong intrinsic O VIII Ly-alpha and O VIII\nrecombination emission, can also explain much of the observed soft excess flux.\nFurthermore, the same spectral model also provides a reasonable match to the\nvery steep 0.1-2 keV spectrum deduced from ROSAT data.

Here, we show that it is\npossible to maximize it analytically over four of the eight parameters.\nMaximization over a fifth parameter, the time of arrival, is handled most\nefficiently by using the Fast-Fourier-Transform algorithm. This allows us to\nscan the parameter space continuously over these five parameters and also cuts\ndown substantially on the computational costs. Maximization of the LR over the\nremaining three parameters is handled numerically. This includes the\nconstruction of a bank of templates on this reduced parameter space. After\nobtaining the network statistic, we first discuss `idealized' networks with all\nthe detectors having a common noise curve for simplicity. Such an exercise\nnevertheless yields useful estimates about computational costs, and also tests\nthe formalism developed here. We then consider realistic cases of networks\ncomprising of the LIGO and VIRGO detectors: These include two-detector\nnetworks, which pair up the two LIGOs or VIRGO with one of the LIGOs, and the\nthree-detector network that includes VIRGO and both the LIGOs. For these\nnetworks we present the computational speed requirements, network\nsensitivities, and source-direction resolutions. \n\n"}

In this paper we use self-gravitating monopole solutions\nas tools for investigating the transition between these two types of\nspacetimes. We show how causally distinct regions emerge as the black hole\nlimit is achieved, even though the measurements made by an external observer\nvary continuously. We find that near-critical solutions have a naturally\ndefined entropy, despite the absence of a true horizon, and that this has a\nclear connection with the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy. We find that certain\nclasses of near-critical solutions display naked black hole behavior, although\nthey are not truly black holes at all. Finally, we present a numerical\nsimulation illustrating how an incident pulse of matter can induce the\ndynamical collapse of a monopole into an extremal black hole. We discuss the\nimplications of this process for the third law of black hole thermodynamics. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-th/0301138", "contents": "Title: Brane inflation and reheating Abstract: We study inflation and reheating in a brane world model derived from Type IIA\nstring theory. This particular setup is based on a model of string mediated\nsupersymmetry breaking. The inflaton is one of the transverse scalars of a\nD4-brane which has one of its spatial dimensions stretched between two\nNS5-branes, so that it is effectively three-dimensional. This D4-brane is\nattracted to a D6-brane that is separated from the 5-branes by a fixed amount.\nThe potential of the transverse scalar due to the D4/D6 interaction makes a\ngood inflaton potential. As the D4-brane slides along the two 5-branes towards\nthe 6-brane it begins to oscillate near the minimum of the potential. The\ninflaton field couples to the massless Standard Model fields through Yukawa\ncouplings. In the brane picture these couplings are introduced by having\nanother D6'-brane intersect the D4-brane such that the 4-6' strings, whose\nlowest lying modes are the Standard Model matter, couple to the scalar mode of\nthe 4-4 strings, the inflaton. The inflaton can decay into scalar and spinor\nparticles on the 4-6' strings, reheating the universe. Observational data is\nused to place constraints on the parameters of the model. \n\n"}

One can try to improve in this aspect in a\nnumber of ways. For instance, it has been suggested to employ a field whose\nkinetic term is not sign definite, in the hope that the background may be\noverall stable. We show that this is not the case; the physical perturbations\n(gravity included) of the system do not extend across the zeros of the kinetic\nterm; hence, all the modes are entirely localized either where the kinetic term\nis positive, or where it is negative; this second type of modes are ghosts.
