{"id": "0704.1447", "contents": "Title: Can Gravity Probe B usefully constrain torsion gravity theories? Abstract: In most theories of gravity involving torsion, the source for torsion is the\nintrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly\noriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.\nHowever, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of\ntheories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates\na significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action\nequals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple\nto a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB\ngyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the\nEarth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not\napply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the\nHayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called\nEinstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of\nthis theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for\nthe torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with\nthe spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either\nghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems\ncan be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition\nchoosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This\nyields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction\nprinciple is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does\nnot couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji\ntheory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There\nmay be other torsion theories which do. \n\n"}

This quantitatively differs from the popular\nnon-minimally coupled models, although it is qualitatively similar. In all such\nmodels, new heavy fields must enter in order for the theory to be well behaved\nin the UV. We show that in all cases the Higgs self coupling lambda must be\nquite small in order to integrate out the heavy fields and use the resulting\nlow energy effective field theory of the Higgs to describe inflation. For\nmoderately sized lambda, the UV completion is required and will, in general,\ndetermine the inflationary regime. We discuss the important issue of the\narbitrariness of the Lagrangians used in all these setups by presenting a new\nclass of such models, including a supergravity version. This suggests that the\ninflationary potential is disconnected from low energy physics. \n\n"}

That granted, Einstein gravity will also need\nto be modified at short-distance nuclear scales, using instead a nonminimally\ncoupled scalar-tensor theory of gravitation that provides for the existence of\nQCD's two-phase vacuum having two different zero-point energy states as a\nfunction of temperature.

These models have a well-known\nKutasov duality, under which a weakly coupled electric UV description can flow\nto a different weakly coupled magnetic IR description. We provide evidence to\nshow that Dirac gaugino mass terms map as lim_{mu->infty} mD/(g kappa^{1/(k+1}}\n= lim_{mu->0} tilde{mD}/(tilde{g} tilde{kappa}^{1/(k+1}} under such a flow,\nwhere the coupling kappa appears in the superpotential of the canonically\nnormalised theory as W \\supset kappa X^{k+1}. This combination is an\nRG-invariant to all orders in perturbation theory, but establishing the mapping\nin its entirety is not straightforward because Dirac masses are not the\nspurions of holomorphic couplings in the N=1 theory. To circumvent this, we\nfirst demonstrate that deforming the Kutasov theory can make it flow to an N=2\ntheory with parametrically small N=1 deformations. Using harmonic superspace\ntechniques we then show that the N=1 deformations can be recovered from\nelectric and magnetic FI-terms that break N=2 -> N=1, and also show that pure\nDirac mass terms can be induced by the same mechanism. We then find that the\nproposed RG-invariant is indeed preserved under N=2 duality, and thence along\nthe flow to the dual N=1 Kutasov theories.

The main claim is that a single mode of the lathe radiation is\nmaximally entangled with the mode inside the horizon and simultaneously with\nthe modes of early Hawking radiation. We argue that this situation never\nhappens during the evolution of a black hole. Quantum mechanics tells us that\nwhile the black hole exists, unitary evolution maximally entangles a late mode\nlocated just outside the horizon with a combination of early radiation and\nblack hole states, instead of either of them separately. One of the reasons for\nthis is that the black hole radiation is not random and strongly depends on the\ngeometry and charge of the black hole, as detailed numerical calculations of\nHawking evaporation clearly show. As a consequence, one can't factor out the\nstate of the black hole. However, this extended entanglement between the black\nhole and modes of early and late radiation indicates that, as the black hole\nages, the local Rindler horizon is modified out to macroscopic distances from\nthe black hole. Fundamentally non-local physics nor firewalls are not necessary\nto explain this result. We propose an infrared mechanism called {\\it icezone}\nthat is mediated by low energy interacting modes and acts near any event\nhorizon to entangle states separated by long distances. These interactions at\nfirst provide small corrections to the thermal Hawking radiation.

Our\nreasoning is twofold: First, the incapability of the conventional matching\nconditions to accept the Nambu-Goto probe limit (even the geodesic limit of the\nIsrael matching conditions is not acceptable since being the geodesic equation\na kinematical fact it should be preserved for all gravitational theories or\ndefects, which is not the case for these conditions). Second, in our\nD-dimensional spacetime (maybe D=4), classical defects of any possible\ncodimension should be compatible. These matching conditions fail to accept\ncodimension-2 and 3 defects for D=4 (which represents effectively the spacetime\nat certain length and energy scales) and most probably fail to accept high\nenough codimensional defects for any D since there is no high enough Lovelock\ndensity to support them.

This conjecture is motivated by a\ngeneralization to strings of the rule for computing anomalous dimensions of\nmassive particles and supergravity fields in the anti-de Sitter space. We show\nthat this proportionality holds for a rotating closed string in global AdS\nspace, representing a high spin operator made of fields in the adjoint\nrepresentation. It is also valid for closed strings rotating in $S^5$\n(representing operators with large R-charge), for closed strings with multiple\nAdS spin, and for giant magnons.

This component is critical in reproducing\nthe success of cold dark matter for the expansion history and the growth of\nlinear perturbations, but does not cluster significantly on non-linear scales.\nInstead, the missing mass problem on non-linear scales is addressed by a\nmodification of the gravitational force law. The force law approximates MOND at\nlarge and intermediate accelerations, and therefore reproduces the empirical\nsuccess of MOND at fitting galactic rotation curves. At ultra-low\naccelerations, the force law reverts to an inverse-square-law, albeit with a\nlarger Newton's constant. This latter regime is important in galaxy clusters\nand is consistent with their observed isothermal profiles, provided the\ncharacteristic acceleration scale of MOND is mildly varying with scale or mass,\nsuch that it is ~12 times higher in clusters than in galaxies.

Abstract: Of course not, but if one believes that information cannot be destroyed in a\ntheory of quantum gravity, then we run into apparent contradictions with\nquantum theory when we consider evaporating black holes. Namely that the\nno-cloning theorem or the principle of entanglement monogamy is violated. Here,\nwe show that neither violation need hold, since, in arguing that black holes\nlead to cloning or non-monogamy, one needs to assume a tensor product structure\nbetween two points in space-time that could instead be viewed as causally\nconnected. In the latter case, one is violating the semi-classical causal\nstructure of space, which is a strictly weaker implication than cloning or\nnon-monogamy. We show that the lack of monogamy that can emerge in evaporating\nspace times is one that is allowed in quantum mechanics, and is very naturally\nrelated to a lack of monogamy of correlations of outputs of measurements\nperformed at subsequent instances of time of a single system. A particular\nexample of this is the Horowitz-Maldacena proposal, and we argue that it\nneedn't lead to cloning or violations of entanglement monogamy. For\nmeasurements on systems which appear to be leaving a black hole, we introduce\nthe notion of the temporal product, and argue that it is just as natural a\nchoice for measurements as the tensor product. For black holes, the tensor and\ntemporal products have the same measurement statistics, but result in different\ntype of non-monogamy of correlations, with the former being forbidden in\nquantum theory while the latter is allowed.

In this thesis, we propose and develop an alternative\nmethod which does not require the additional superfield and thus reduces the\nnecessary degrees of freedom by half. That is, we study inflation in\nsupergravity with only a single chiral superfield which contains inflaton. We\naccomplish it by introducing a higher dimensional term in the inflaton Kahler\npotential, which plays an important dual role: fixing the value of the scalar\nsuperpartner of the inflaton resulting in effective single field models, and\nensuring the positivity of the inflaton potential at the large field region.\nOur proposal is not just particular models but rather a new framework to\nrealize various inflationary models in supergravity.

However, the situation is less understood in\ninteracting theories, especially on time scales longer than the dynamical\nrelaxation time. Recently there have been claims that the quantum theory\ndeviates spectacularly from the classical theory on this time scale, even if\nthe occupancy numbers are extremely large. Furthermore, it is claimed that the\nquantum theory quickly thermalizes while the classical theory does not. The\nevidence for these claims comes from noticing a spectacular difference in the\ntime evolution of expectation values of quantum operators compared to the\nclassical micro-state evolution. If true, this would have dramatic consequences\nfor many important phenomena, including laboratory studies of interacting BECs,\ndark matter axions, preheating after inflation, etc. In this work we critically\nexamine these claims. We show that in fact the classical theory can describe\nthe quantum behavior in the high occupancy regime, even when interactions are\nlarge. The connection is that the expectation values of quantum operators in a\nsingle quantum micro-state are approximated by a corresponding classical\nensemble average over many classical micro-states.

Feng et\nal. have suggested that, at high ambient de Sitter temperature, the rate may be\nstrongly enhanced, due to large degeneracy factors associated with the number\nof light species living on the worldsheet. This might facilitate the quick\nrelaxation from a large effective cosmological constant down to the observed\nvalue. Here, we analyse this possibility in some detail. In four dimensions,\nand after the moduli are stabilized, branes interact via repulsive long range\nforces. Because of that, the Coleman-de Luccia (CdL) instanton for coincident\nbrane nucleation may not exist, unless there is some short range interaction\nwhich keeps the branes together. If the CdL instanton exists, we find that the\ndegeneracy factor depends only mildly on the ambient de Sitter temperature, and\ndoes not switch off even in the case of tunneling from flat space. This would\nresult in catastrophic decay of the present vacuum. If, on the contrary, the\nCdL instanton does not exist, coindident brane nucleation may still proceed\nthrough a \"static\" instanton, representing pair creation of critical bubbles --\na process somewhat analogous to thermal activation in flat space. In that case,\nthe branes may stick together due to thermal symmetry restoration, and the pair\ncreation rate depends exponentially on the ambient de Sitter temperature,\nswitching off sharply as the temperature approaches zero. Such static instanton\nmay be well suited for the \"saltatory\" relaxation scenario proposed by Feng et\nal. \n\n"}

In the latter case, boundary conditions on metric perturbations\nh can be chosen to be completely invariant under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms,\nto preserve the invariance group of the theory and BRST symmetry. In the de\nDonder gauge, however, the resulting boundary-value problem for the Laplace\ntype operator acting on h is known to be self-adjoint but not strongly\nelliptic. The latter is a technical condition ensuring that a unique smooth\nsolution of the boundary-value problem exists, which implies, in turn, that the\nglobal heat-kernel asymptotics yielding one-loop divergences and one-loop\neffective action actually exists.
