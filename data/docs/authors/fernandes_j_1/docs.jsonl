Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

The I-\nand K-band velocity-luminosity (VL) relations have log-slopes of 0.29 and 0.27,\nrespectively with sigma_ln(VL)~0.13, and show a small dependence on color and\nmorphological type in the sense that redder, early-type disk galaxies rotate\nfaster than bluer, later-type disk galaxies for most luminosities. The VL\nrelation at I- and K-bands is independent of surface brightness, size and light\nconcentration. The log-slope of the I- and K-band RL relations is a strong\nfunction of morphology and varies from 0.25 to 0.5. The average dispersion\nsigma_ln(RL) decreases from 0.33 at I-band to 0.29 at K, likely due to the\n2MASS selection bias against lower surface brightness galaxies. Measurement\nuncertainties are sigma_ln(V)~0.09, sigma_ln(L)~0.14 and somewhat larger and\nharder to estimate for ln(R). The color dependence of the VL relation is\nconsistent with expectations from stellar population synthesis models. The VL\nand RL residuals are largely uncorrelated with each other; the RV-RL residuals\nshow only a weak positive correlation. These correlations suggest that scatter\nin luminosity is not a significant source of the scatter in the VL and RL\nrelations.

Abstract: The evolution of the galaxy stellar mass--star formation rate relationship\n(M*-SFR) provides key constraints on the stellar mass assembly histories of\ngalaxies. For star-forming galaxies, M*-SFR is observed to be fairly tight with\na slope close to unity from z~0-2. Simulations of galaxy formation reproduce\nthese trends owing to the generic dominance of smooth and steady cold accretion\nin these systems. In contrast, the amplitude of the M*-SFR relation evolves\nmarkedly differently than in models. Stated in terms of a star formation\nactivity parameter alpha=(M*/SFR)/(t_H-1 Gyr), models predict a constant\nalpha~1 out to redshifts z=4+, while the observed M*-SFR relation indicates\nthat alpha increases by X3 from z~2 until today. The low alpha at high-z not\nonly conflicts with models, but is also difficult to reconcile with other\nobservations of high-z galaxies. Systematic biases could significantly affect\nmeasurements of M* and SFR, but detailed considerations suggest that none are\nobvious candidates to reconcile the discrepancy. A speculative solution is\nconsidered in which the stellar initial mass function (IMF) evolves towards\nmore high-mass star formation at earlier epochs. Following Larson, a model is\ninvestigated in which the characteristic mass Mhat where the IMF turns over\nincreases with redshift. The observed and predicted M*-SFR evolution may be\nbrought into agreement if Mhat=0.5(1+z)^2 Mo out to z~2.

Therefore,\nin this paper, we argue that not only D9-brane but also Dp-brane for p less\nthan 9 has a 9-volume. This idea is new, as the present view states that such a\nDp-brane has p-volume but no 9 volume. To demonstrate this, first, we equate\nD8-brane action with D9-brane action and show that 9th direction which is\nperpendicular to D8-brane has non-zero width. We repeat this step for different\nps; we equate Dp-brane action with Dp-1 brane action.

To represent this\nability, a mathematical operation called postcorrection is introduced, which\ncorrects the present state to guarantee certain characteristics of the future\nstate. Evolution of living matter is thus determined by goals (first of all by\nthe goal of survival) as well as by causes. The resulting theory, in a way\nsymmetrical in time direction, follows from a sort of antropic principle.\nPossible criteria for postcorrection and corresponding phenomena in the sphere\nof life are classified. Both individual and collective criteria of survival are\nconsidered as well as the criteria providing certain quality of life and those\nwhich are irrelevant to the life quality. The phenomena of free will and direct\nsighting of truth (e.g. scientific insight) are explained in these terms. The\nproblem of artificial intellect and the role of brain look differently in the\nframework of this theory.

According to the form of the\nself-interaction of the basic constituents and the spacetime symmetry, we can\ndistinguish mini-, axidilaton, soliton, charged, oscillating and rotating BSs.\nTheir compactness prevents a Newtonian approximation, however, modifications of\ngeneral relativity, as in the case of Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory as a low energy\nlimit of strings, would provide them with gravitational memory.

The data provide new information on their circumstellar material as\nwell as their evolution. In IRC +10420, the polarization of the Halpha line is\ndifferent to that of the continuum, which indicates that the\nelectron-scattering region is not spherically symmetric. The observed long term\nchanges in the polarimetry can be associated with an axi-symmetric structure,\nalong the short axis of the extended reflection nebulosity. Long term\nphotometry reveals that the star increased in temperature until the\nmid-nineties, after which the photospheric flux in the optical levelled off. As\nthe photometric changes are mostly probed in the red, they do not trace high\nstellar temperatures sensitively. And so, it is not obvious whether the star\nhas halted its increase in temperature or not. For HD 179821 we find no\npolarization effects across any absorption or emission lines, but observe very\nlarge polarization changes of order 5% over 15 years.

Moreover, extrasolar planets are found in prograde orbits\nabout their host star, and often in mean motion resonances (MMR). In a first\nstep, we study theoretically a new stabilizing mechanism suitable for compact\ntwo-planet systems. This mechanism involves counter-revolving orbits forming a\nretrograde MMR. In a second step, we investigate the feasibility of planetary\nsystems hosting counter-revolving planets. Dynamical stability, observations,\nand formation processes of these systems are analyzed and discussed. To\ncharacterize the dynamical behavior of multi-dimensional planetary systems, we\napply our technique of global dynamics analysis based on the MEGNO indicator\n(Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits) that provides the fine\nstructure of the phase space. In a few cases of possible counter-revolving\nconfigurations, we carry out new fits to the observations using the Pikaia\ngenetic algorithm.

In this situation,\nthe standard method used to determine the behavior of cosmological\nperturbations breaks down. We present a generic method, based on the uniform\napproximation, to analytically derive the power spectra of scalar and tensor\nperturbations. For this purpose, a simple hierarchy of parameters, related to\nthe sound speed of the cosmological fluctuations and its successive\nderivatives, is introduced in a k-inflation analogue of the Hubble flow\nfunctions. The scalar spectral index and its running are obtained up to next to\nnext to leading order for all k-inflationary models. This result relies on the\nexistence of a well-motivated initial state, which is not trivial in the\npresent context: having the wavelength of the Fourier mode smaller than the\nsonic horizon is indeed not enough and some conditions on the dynamics of the\nsound speed are also required.

In agreement with previous studies, calculations based on our\nmodel show that the transition from atomic to fully molecular phase depends\nprimarily on the metallicity, which we assume is directly related to the dust\nabundance, and clumpiness of the interstellar medium. The clumpiness simply\nboosts the formation rate of molecular hydrogen, while dust serves both as a\ncatalyst of molecular hydrogen formation and as an additional shielding from\ndissociating UV radiation. The upshot is that it is difficult to form\nfully-shielded giant molecular clouds while gas metallicity is low. However,\nonce the gas is enriched to Z ~ 0.01-0.1 solar, the subsequent star formation\nand enrichment can proceed at a much faster rate. This may keep star formation\nefficiency in the low-mass, low-metallicity progenitors of galaxies very low\nfor a certain period of time with the effect similar to a strong \"feedback\"\nmechanism.

Results: No significant gamma-ray signal is found at the respective\nposition of the two clusters with several different source size assumptions for\neach target. In particular, emission regions corresponding to the high density\ncore, to the extension of the entire X-ray emission in these clusters, and to\nthe very extended region where the accretion shock is expected, are\ninvestigated.

However,\nthe lack of the detection of a neutron star or pulsar formed in the SN 1987A\nstill remains an unsolved mystery. In this paper we suggest that the newly\nformed neutron star at the center of SN1987A may undergo a phase transition\nafter the neutrino trapping time scale (~10 s). Consequently the compact\nremnant of SN 1987A may be a strange quark star, which has a softer equation of\nstate than that of neutron star matter.

We calculate the accretion luminosity of a system based on the\naccretion-rate which is assumed to be equal to the mass-supply rate at the\nradius of ~10^-2 pc. For the models with high temperature gas at large radii\n(~10 pc) and high luminosities, we find a strong correlation between the\nmass-outflow rate (Mdot_out) and the luminosity (L). The power law index (q)\ndescribing the Mdot_out-L relation is q=2.0(+/-0.1), which is very similar to\nthat for radiation-driven stellar and disc wind models. More surprisingly, for\nhigh density at large radii, we find steady state solutions with the accretion\nluminosity exceeding the Eddington limit. The super-Eddington accretion\nproceeds in the equatorial region and is possible because the radiation flux\nfrom the disc is significantly reduced in the equatorial direction due to the\ngeometrical foreshortening effect. In all models, an outflow is driven from an\ninflow with sub-Keplerian rotation. For high temperature at large radii, the\ninflow occurs over a wide range of the polar angles, and the outflow occurs in\na relatively narrow polar cone. However, for the super-Eddington cases with low\ntemperature at large radii, the inflow persists only very close to the\nequatorial plane, resembling a thin accretion disc, while the outflow arises in\na wide range of radii and polar angles. The geometry of this extreme\ninflow-outflow solution is very similar to a radiation-driven wind from a\nluminous Keplerian accretion disc. \n\n"}

Taking the unperturbed state of the matter to be the de\nSitter invariant Bunch-Davies state, the linear variation of the stress tensor\nabout its self-consistent mean value serves as a source for fluctuations in the\ngeometry through the semi-classical Einstein equations. This linear response\nframework is used to investigate both the importance of quantum backreaction\nand the validity of the semi-classical approximation in cosmology. The full\nvariation of the stress tensor, delta T^a_b contains two kinds of terms: (1)\nthose that depend explicitly upon the linearized metric variation delta g_{cd}\nthrough the [T^a_b, T^{cd}] causal response function; and (2) state dependent\nvariations, independent of delta g_{cd}. For perturbations of the first kind,\nthe criterion for the validity of the semi-classical approximation in de Sitter\nspace is satisfied for fluctuations on all scales well below the Planck scale.\nThe perturbations of the second kind contain additional massless scalar degrees\nof freedom associated with changes of state of the fields on the cosmological\nhorizon scale.

However, a one sigma increase in mass (5.6 M_E) and\ndecrease in size (1.59 R_E) are compatible with an Earth-like composition (33%\niron, 67% silicates). Alternatively, it is possible that CoRoT-7b contains a\nsignificant amount of volatiles.

We highlight that this\nresult would have profound consequences for both eternal inflation and the\npredictivity of standard inflation. We find a different result. We consider two\nsets of theories: one where the inflaton has a large cubic self-interaction and\none where the inflaton interacts gravitationally with N massless spectator\nscalar fields. We find that there is a logarithmic running but of the form\nlog(H/mu), where H is the Hubble constant during inflation.

We analysed the HST/STIS and\nFUSE spectra of this quasar and compared the results to Cloudy photoionization\nand collisional ionization models in order to derive densities, temperatures,\nand metallicities of the absorbing gas. The absorption can be explained by two\nC III clouds, offset by 35 km/s in velocity, with metallicities of ~one-tenth\nthe solar value. One cloud has a density of order n_H = 1.2 +0.9 -0.5 * 10^-3\ncm^-3 (thickness 0.4 +0.3 -0.2 kpc) and produces the observed C II and Si III\nabsorption, while the other has a density of order n_H = 1.2 +0.9 -0.5 * 10^-5\ncm^-3 (thickness 80 +70 -40 kpc) and gives rise to the observed weak C IV\nabsorption.

Although collisionally ionized clouds with T ~\n70,000 K are possible, they are less likely because of the short cooling\ntime-scales involved.

Simultaneous\noptical/UV and X-ray observations were made with the XMM-Newton satellite on\nJune 12/13 and June 14/15, 2005. NRT radio observations were also\ncontemporaneously performed in 2005.

A time-averaged energy spectrum is measured from 200 GeV\nto 2 TeV and is characterized by a power law (photon index of Gamma = 3.06 +-\n0.15 {stat} +- 0.10 {syst}). Significant small-amplitude variations in the VHE\nflux from H 2356-309 are seen on time scales of months and years, but not on\nshorter time scales.

The brightest emission\ncomes from HI Ly-alpha and the strongest metal line, CIII, is about an order of\nmagnitude fainter, although HI Ly-alpha may be fainter if the gas is\nself-shielded to the UV background or if dust is important. The highest surface\nbrightness regions for CIV, SiIII, SiIV and OVI are fainter than CIII by\nfactors of a few.

Lower ionisation lines arise in denser\nand colder gas that produces clumpier emission.

The brain uses the QL\nrepresentation (QLR) for working with abstract concepts; concrete images are\ndescribed by classical information theory. Two processes, classical and QL, are\nperformed parallely. Moreover, information is actively transmitted from one\nrepresentation to another. A QL concept given in our model by a density\noperator can generate a variety of concrete images given by temporal\nrealizations of the corresponding (Gaussian) random signal.

In\nextreme cases, rapid variability of the emission suggests that structures of\nlength-scale smaller than the gravitational radius of the central black hole\nare imprinted on the jet as it is launched, and modulate the radiation released\nafter it has been accelerated to high Lorentz factor.

Since the number ~Npix^2 of terms in this sum exceeds\nthe number Npix of measurements, these ~Npix^2 terms cannot be statistically\nindependent. Therefore, the central-limit theorem does not necessarily apply,\nand the probability distribution function (PDF) for the fnl estimator does not\nnecessarily approach a Gaussian distribution for N_pix >> 1. Although the\nvariance of the estimators is known, the significance of a measurement of fnl\ndepends on knowledge of the full shape of its PDF. Here we use Monte Carlo\nrealizations of CMB maps to determine the PDF for two minimum-variance\nestimators: the standard estimator, constructed under the null hypothesis\n(fnl=0), and an improved estimator with a smaller variance for |fnl| > 0. While\nthe PDF for the null-hypothesis estimator is very nearly Gaussian when the true\nvalue of fnl is zero, the PDF becomes significantly non-Gaussian when |fnl| >\n0. In this case we find that the PDF for the null-hypothesis estimator fnl_hat\nis skewed, with a long non-Gaussian tail at fnl_hat > |fnl| and less\nprobability at fnl_hat < |fnl| than in the Gaussian case. We provide an\nanalytic fit to these PDFs. On the other hand, we find that the PDF for the\nimproved estimator is nearly Gaussian for observationally allowed values of\nfnl.

Here we collate resolved\nobservations of Milky Way molecular clouds, kpc-scale observations of Local\nGroup galaxies, and unresolved observations of both disk and starburst galaxies\nin the local universe and at high redshift. We show that all of these data are\nin fact consistent with a simple, local, volumetric star formation law. The\napparent variations stem from the fact that the observed objects have a wide\nvariety of 3D size scales and degrees of internal clumping, so even at fixed\ngas column density the regions being observed can have wildly varying volume\ndensities. We provide a simple theoretical framework to remove this projection\neffect, and we show that all the data, from small Solar neighborhood clouds\nwith masses ~10^3 Msun to sub-mm galaxies with masses ~10^11 Msun, fall on a\nsingle star formation law in which the SFR is simply ~1% of the molecular gas\nmass per local free-fall time. In contrast, proposed star formation laws in\nwhich the star formation timescale is set by the galactic rotation period or\nthe SFR is linearly proportional to the gas mass above some density threshold\nfail to match at least some of the data. \n\n"}

We study the impact of this relative motion on the distribution of\nthe star-forming halos and on the formation redshift of the very first star. We\ninclude a new aspect of the relative velocity effect found in recent\nsimulations by fitting their results to obtain the spatially-varying minimum\nhalo mass needed for molecular cooling. Thus, the relative velocities have\nthree separate effects: suppression of the halo abundance, suppression of the\ngas content within each halo, and boosting of the minimum cooling mass. We show\nthat the two suppressions (of gas content and of halo abundance) are the\nprimary effects on the small minihalos that cannot form stars, while the\ncooling mass boost combines with the abundance suppression to produce order\nunity fluctuations in stellar density. We quantify the large-scale\ninhomogeneity of galaxies, finding that 68% of the star formation (averaged on\na 3 Mpc scale) is confined to 35% of the volume at z=20 (and just 18% at z=40).\nIn addition, we estimate the redshift of the first star to be z ~ 65, which\nincludes a delay of Dz ~ 5 due to the relative velocity. \n\n"}

The Halpha, Hbeta,\n[NII] and [OIII] emission lines are also fit in summed spectra for circular\nannuli of increasing radius. A simple mass model is used to estimate dynamical\nmass within 10 kpc, which compared to estimates of stellar mass shows that\nbetween 10 and 100% of total mass is in stars. We present plots showing the\nradial behaviour of EW[Halpha], u-i colour and emission line ratios. Although\nEW[Halpha] and u-i colour trace current or recent star formation, the radial\nprofiles are often quite different. Whilst line ratios do vary with annular\nradius, radial gradients in galaxies with central line ratios typical of AGN or\nLINERS are mild, with a hard component of ionization required out to large\nradii.

Our two main\nresults are: (1) Galaxies in the virialized regions of clusters, in groups, and\nin the field follow a similar mass distribution.

We\nfind that the excitation properties of nebulae in the outer (R>R25) disks are\nsimilar to those of the inner disks, but on average younger HII regions tend to\nbe selected in the bright inner disks. Reddening by dust is not negligible in\nthe outer disks, and subject to significant large-scale spatial variations. For\nboth galaxies the radial abundance gradient flattens to a constant value\noutside of the isophotal radius. The outer disk O/H abundance ratio is highly\nhomogeneous, with a scatter of only ~0.06 dex. Based on the excitation and\nchemical (N/O ratio) analysis we find no compelling evidence for variations in\nthe upper initial mass function of the ionizing clusters of extended disks. The\nO/H abundance in the outer disks of the target galaxies corresponds to 35% of\nthe solar value (or higher, depending on the metallicity diagnostic).

In particular, we investigate the\nmagnetospheric ejections (MEs) due to the expansion and reconnection of the\nfield lines connecting the star with the disk. Our aim is to study the\ndynamical properties of the outflows and evaluate their impact on the angular\nmomentum evolution of young protostars. Our models are based on axisymmetric\ntime-dependent magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of the\ndipolar magnetosphere of a rotating protostar with a viscous and resistive\ndisk, using alpha prescriptions for the transport coefficients. Our simulations\nare designed in order to model: the accretion process and the formation of\naccretion funnels; the periodic inflation/reconnection of the magnetosphere and\nthe associated MEs; the stellar wind. Similarly to a magnetic slingshot, MEs\ncan be powered by the rotation of both the disk and the star so that they can\nefficiently remove angular momentum from both. Depending on the accretion rate,\nMEs can extract a relevant fraction of the accretion torque and, together with\na weak but non-negligible stellar wind torque, can balance the spin-up due to\naccretion. When the disk truncation approaches the corotation radius, the\nsystem enters a \"propeller\" regime, where the torques exerted by the disk and\nthe MEs can even balance the spin-up due to the stellar contraction. The MEs\nspin-down efficiency can be compared to other scenarios, such as the Ghosh &\nLamb, X-wind or stellar wind models. Nevertheless, for all scenarios, an\nefficient spin-down torque requires a rather strong dipolar component, which\nhas been seldom observed in classical T Tauri stars.

II.\n  Lorentz invariance and bi-spinors Abstract: Owing to the non-differentiable nature of the theory of Scale Relativity, the\nemergence of complex wave functions, then of spinors and bi-spinors occurs\nnaturally in its framework. The wave function is here a manifestation of the\nvelocity field of geodesics of a continuous and non-differentiable (therefore\nfractal) space-time. In a first paper (Paper I), we have presented the general\nargument which leads to this result using an elaborate and more detailed\nderivation than previously displayed. We have therefore been able to show how\nthe complex wave function emerges naturally from the doubling of the velocity\nfield and to revisit the derivation of the non relativistic Schr\\\"odinger\nequation of motion. In the present paper (Paper II) we deal with relativistic\nmotion and detail the natural emergence of the bi-spinors from such first\nprinciples of the theory. Moreover, while Lorentz invariance has been up to now\ninferred from mathematical results obtained in stochastic mechanics, we display\nhere a new and detailed derivation of the way one can obtain a Lorentz\ninvariant expression for the expectation value of the product of two\nindependent fractal fluctuation fields in the sole framework of the theory of\nScale Relativity.

We find that combining cluster data with CMB measurements from Planck\nimproves by more than an order of magnitude the constraint on neutrino masses\ncompared to each probe used independently. For the LCDM+m_nu model the 2 sigma\nupper limit on total neutrino mass shifts from M_nu < 0.35 eV using cluster\ndata alone to M_nu < 0.031 eV when combined with CMB data. When a non-standard\nmodel with N_eff number of neutrino species is considered, we estimate\nN_eff<3.14 (95% CL), while the bounds on neutrino mass are relaxed to M_nu <\n0.040 eV. This accuracy would be sufficient for a 2 sigma detection of neutrino\nmass even in the minimal normal hierarchy scenario.

We revisit this\nclaim by examining the predictions from dynamical realisations based on new MGE\nmodels of NGC1277. We present realisations which fit the observed photometry.\nM/L is fixed following scaling relations which predict a Salpeter-like IMF. A\nmodel without a BH provides a surprisingly good fit of the observed kinematics\noutside the unresolved central region, but not, as expected, of the central\ndispersion and h4 values. A model with a MBH of 5 10^9 Msun allows to fit the\ndispersion profile, consistently with models of the same mass and M/L in\nvdB+12. It departs from the central h4 values by only about twice the given\nuncertainty. A slightly varying M/L or the addition of high velocity stars\nwould further lower the need for a very massive BH. These results do not rule\nout the presence of an over-massive BH at the centre of NGC1277. However, they\nlead us to advocate the use of 3-sigma confidence intervals for derived MBH as\nbetter, more conservative, guidelines for such studies. We caution for the use\nof ill-defined spheroidal components as an input for scaling relations, and\nemphasise the fact that a MBH in the range 2-5 10^9 Msun would represent less\nthan 5% of the spheroid mass of our models. This would make the BH in NGC1277\nconsistent or just twice as large as what a recent version of the MBH-sigma\nrelation predicts. We examine the impact of the presence of a bar by running\nsimulations from the same MGE model but with extreme anisotropies. An inner\nsmall bar forms, and an end-on view gets closer to fitting the central\ndispersion profile without the need for a central BH, while adding a black hole\nof 2.5 10^9 Msun, in line with the prediction from scaling relations, allows to\nfit the dispersion peak and h3 profiles.

Given that the\ndegree of the anisotropy in the largest-scale clustering depends sensitively on\nthe nature of dark energy, the supercluster straightness may play a\ncomplimentary role in testing dynamic dark energy models. Here we focus on the\ncoupled dark energy (cDE) models which assume the existence of dark sector\ncoupling between scalar field dark energy and nonbaryonic dark matter.\nDetermining the spines of the superclusters identified in the publicly\navailable group catalogs from the CODECS (COupled Dark Energy Cosmological\nSimulations) for four different cDE models as well as for the LCDM model, we\nquantify the straightness of each supercluster as the spatial extent of its\nspine per member cluster where a supercluster spine represents the main stem of\nthe minimal spanning tree constructed out of the member clusters.

Such a scenario has been\ndiscussed as a viable model for light (~ 10 GeV) neutralino dark matter as\nexplanation of possible DAMA and CoGeNT direct detection signals.

Following up on an earlier idea, this paper studies\nthe anisotropies produced by protons of energy >E/Z, assuming that anisotropies\nat energy >E have been produced by nuclei of charge Z, which share the same\nmagnetic rigidity. We calculate the number of secondary protons produced\nthrough photodisintegration of the primary heavy nuclei. Making the extreme\nassumption that the source does not inject any proton, we find that the\nsource(s) responsible for anisotropies such as reported by the Pierre Auger\nObservatory should lie closer than ~20-30, 80-100 and 180-200 Mpc if the\nanisotropy signal is mainly composed of oxygen, silicon and iron nuclei\nrespectively.

To increase\nsurvey area with a fixed observing time and pixel count, images from surveys\nsuch as the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) or Euclid will\nnecessarily be undersampled and therefore distorted by aliasing. Oversampled,\nunaliased images can be obtained by combining multiple, dithered exposures of\nthe same source with a suitable reconstruction algorithm. Any such\nreconstruction must minimally distort the reconstructed images for weak lensing\nanalyses to be unbiased. In this paper, we use the IMage COMbination (IMCOM)\nalgorithm of Rowe, Hirata, and Rhodes to investigate the effect of image\ncombination on shape measurements (size and ellipticity). We simulate dithered\nimages of sources with varying amounts of ellipticity and undersampling,\nreconstruct oversampled output images from them using IMCOM, and measure shape\ndistortions in the output. Our simulations show that IMCOM creates no\nsignificant distortions when the relative offsets between dithered images are\nprecisely known.

Indeed the\ngravitational field should depend on the relative contribution of the particle\ndark matter distribution to the baryonic one, itself depending on the\nindividual assembly history and environment of the galaxy, including a lot of\ncomplex feedback mechanisms. However, for the last thirty years, Milgrom's\nformula, at the heart of the MOND paradigm, has been consistently succesful at\npredicting rotation curves from baryons alone, and has been resilient to all\nsorts of observational tests on galaxy scales.

High-contrast direct imaging of circumstellar disks is\nlimited by quasi-static speckle noise and ADI is commonly used to suppress\nthose speckles. However, the application of ADI can result in self-subtraction\nof the disk signal due to the disk's finite spatial extent. This signal\nattenuation varies with radial separation and biases measurements of the disk's\nsurface brightness, thereby compromising inferences regarding the physical\nprocesses responsible for the dust distribution. To compensate for this\nattenuation, we forward-model the disk structure and compute the form of the\nself-subtraction function at each separation. As a proof of concept, we apply\nour method to 1.6 and 2.2 micron Keck AO NIRC2 scattered-light observations of\nthe HD 32297 debris disk reduced using a variant of the \"locally optimized\ncombination of images\" (LOCI) algorithm.

Assuming\nthat these emissions are caused by magnetic cycles similar to the sunspot\ncycle, we construct flux transport dynamo models of $1M_{\\odot}$ stars rotating\nwith different rotation periods. We first compute the differential rotation and\nthe meridional circulation inside these stars from a mean-field hydrodynamics\nmodel.

We find a\nstrong dependence of the burst properties on the flux and spectral hardness of\nthe persistent emission before burst. Bursts occurring during the low-accretion\nrate (hard) state exhibit evolution of the black body normalisation consistent\nwith the theoretical predictions of NS atmosphere models. However, bursts\noccurring during the high-accretion rate (soft) state show roughly constant\nnormalisation, which is inconsistent with the NS atmosphere models and\ntherefore these bursts cannot be easily used to determine NS parameters. We\nanalyse the hard-state burst to put the lower limit on the neutron star radius\nin 4U 1608-52 of 13 km (for masses 1.2-2.4 M$_\\odot$). The best agreement with\nthe theoretical NS mass-radius relations is achieved for source distances in\nthe range 3.1-3.7 kpc. We expect that the radius limit will be 10 per cent\nlower if spectral models including rapid rotation are used instead. \n\n"}

Recent work has shown\nthat, with a polynomial parameterisation of the WIMP speed distribution, it is\npossible to make an unbiased measurement of the WIMP mass, without making any\nastrophysical assumptions. However, direct detection experiments are not\nsensitive to low-speed WIMPs and, therefore, any model-independent approach\nwill lead to a bias in the cross section. This problem can be solved with the\naddition of measurements of the flux of neutrinos from the Sun. This is because\nthe flux of neutrinos produced from the annihilation of WIMPs which have been\ngravitationally captured in the Sun is sensitive to low-speed WIMPs. Using mock\ndata from next-generation direct detection experiments and from the IceCube\nneutrino telescope, we show that the complementary information from IceCube on\nlow-speed WIMPs breaks the degeneracy between the cross section and the speed\ndistribution. This allows unbiased determinations of the WIMP mass and\nspin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections to be made, and the speed\ndistribution to be reconstructed. We use two parameterisations of the speed\ndistribution: binned and polynomial. While the polynomial parameterisation can\nencompass a wider range of speed distributions, this leads to larger\nuncertainties in the particle physics parameters. \n\n"}

However, how they fit\ninto the unified model (UM) of AGN is still an open question. The aims of this\nwork are to study at mid-infrared (mid-IR) (1) the Compton-thick nature of\nLINERs; and (2) the disappearance of the dusty torus in LINERs predicted from\ntheoretical arguments. We have compiled all the available low spectral\nresolution mid-IR spectra of LINERs from the IRS/Spitzer (40 LINERs). We have\ncomplemented this sample with Spitzer/IRS spectra of PGQSOs, S1s, S2s, and SBs\nnuclei. We have studied the AGN versus the starburst content in our sample\nusing different indicators: the EW(PAH 6.2um), the strength of the silicate\nfeature at 9.7um, and the steepness of the mid-IR spectra. In 25 out of the 40\nLINERs (i.e., 62.5%) the mid-IR spectra are not SB-dominated, similar to the\ncomparison S2 sample (67.7%). The average spectra of both SB-dominated LINERs\nand S2s are very similar to the average spectrum of the SB class. Moreover, the\naverage spectrum of AGN-dominated LINERs with Lx(2-10keV)>10E+41 erg/s is\nsimilar to the average mid-IR spectrum of AGN-dominated S2s.

This turbulence must be taken into\naccount for any theory of magnetic reconnection, since the initially laminar\nconfigurations can transit to the turbulence state, what is demonstrated by 3D\nhigh resolution numerical simulations. We discuss ideas of how turbulence can\nmodify reconnection with the focus on the Lazarian & Vishniac (1999)\nreconnection model and present numerical evidence supporting the model and\ndemonstrate that it is closely connected to the concept of Richardson diffusion\nand compatible with the Lagrangian dynamics of magnetized fluids. We point out\nthat the Generalized Ohm's Law, that accounts for turbulent motion, predicts\nthe subdominance of the microphysical plasma effects for a realistically\nturbulent media. We show that on of the most dramatic consequences of\nturbulence is the violation of the generally accepted notion of magnetic flux\nfreezing.

In total, 7 billion pixels were imaged using 192 phase\ncentres that resulted in the detection of six sources: the Seyfert nucleus, the\nsupernova SN 2011dh, and four background AGNs. Using the wealth of archival\ndata available in the radio (MERLIN and the VLA), optical (Hubble Space\nTelescope) and X-rays (Chandra) the properties of the individual sources were\ninvestigated in detail.

For dimension 3+1 and under thermal\nequilibrium, NDA simplifies to a path integral model. However, the general case\nof NDA cannot be written as a partition function. As a test of NDA, one\nrecovers general relativity at low curvature and quantum field theory in the\nflat space-time approximation. Related paper: arxiv:1505.03719. \n\n"}

Abstract: Successful phenomenological models of pulsar wind nebulae assume efficient\ndissipation of the Poynting flux of the magnetized electron-positron wind as\nwell as efficient acceleration of the pairs in the vicinity of the termination\nshock, but how this is realized is not yet well understood. The present paper\nsuggests that the corrugation of the termination shock, at the onset of\nnon-linearity, may lead towards the desired phenomenology. Non-linear\ncorrugation of the termination shock would convert a fraction of order unity of\nthe incoming ordered magnetic field into downstream turbulence, slowing down\nthe flow to sub-relativistic velocities.

Here, we follow-up on these observations to map\nHCG91c's disk out to ~2Re at a resolution of 600pc, and characterize the\nnon-radial variations of the gas-phase oxygen abundance in the system. Methods.\nWe obtained deep MUSE observations of the target under ~0.6 arcsec seeing\nconditions. We perform both a spaxel-based and aperture-based analysis of the\ndata to map the spatial variations of 12+log(O/H) across the disk of the\ngalaxy. Results. We confirm the presence of rapid variations of the oxygen\nabundance across the entire extent of the galaxy previously detected with\nWiFeS, for all azimuths and radii. The variations can be separated in two\ncategories: a) localized and associated with individual HII regions, and b)\nextended over kpc scales, and occurring at the boundaries of the spiral\nstructures in the galaxy. Conclusions. Our MUSE observations suggest that the\nenrichment of the interstellar medium in HGC91c has proceeded preferentially\nalong spiral structures, and less efficiently across them. Our dataset\nhighlights the importance of distinguishing individual star-forming regions\ndown to scales of a few 100pc when using integral field spectrographs to\nspatially resolve the distribution of oxygen abundances in a given system, and\naccurately characterize azimuthal variations and intrinsic scatter. \n\n"}

This will likely result in non-equilibrium particle\ndistributions and turbulent plasma conditions. We investigate this by analysing\nthe profiles of high-temperature extreme ultraviolet emission lines from a\nmajor flare (SOL2014-03-29T17:44) observed by the EUV Imaging Spectrometer\n(EIS) on Hinode. We find that in many locations the line profiles are\nnon-Gaussian, consistent with a kappa-distribution of emitting ions with\nproperties that vary in space and time. At the flare footpoints, close to sites\nof hard X-ray emission from non-thermal electrons, the kappa-index for the Fe\nXVI 262.976 angstrom line at 3 MK takes values of 3-5. In the corona, close to\na low-energy HXR source, the Fe XXIII 263.760 angstrom line at 15 MK shows\nkappa values of typically 4-7. The observed trends in the kappa parameter show\nthat we are most likely detecting the properties of the ion population rather\nthan any instrumental effects. We calculate that a non-thermal ion population\ncould exist if locally accelerated on timescales < 0.1 s.

The moderate\nextinction region is the young massive cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd1; A$_{Ks} \\sim$\n0.6 mag), where 453 proper motion-selected main-sequence stars are used to\nmeasure the shape of the extinction law. To quantify the shape we define the\nparameter $\\mathcal{S}_{1/\\lambda}$, which behaves similarly to a color excess\nratio but is continuous as a function of wavelength. The high extinction region\nis the GC (A$_{Ks} \\sim$ 2.5 mag), where 819 red clump stars are used to\ndetermine the normalization of the law. The best-fit extinction law is able to\nreproduce the Wd1 main sequence colors, which previous laws misestimate by\n10%-30%. The law is inconsistent with a single power law, even when only the\nnear-infrared filters are considered, and has A$_{F125W}$/A$_{Ks}$ and\nA$_{F814W}$/A$_{Ks}$ values that are 18% and 24% larger than the commonly used\n\\citet{Nishiyama:2009fc} law, respectively.

A static fractal molecular cloud is\nirradiated with X-rays of different intensity, and the chemical and thermal\nevolution of the cloud are studied. For a simulated $10^5$ M$_\\odot$ fractal\ncloud an X-ray flux $<0.01$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ allows the cloud to remain\nmolecular, whereas most of the CO and H$_2$ are destroyed for a flux of $>1$\nerg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The effects of an X-ray flare, which suddenly increases\nthe X-ray flux by $10^5 \\times$ are then studied. A cloud exposed to a bright\nflare has 99% of its CO destroyed in 10-20 years, whereas it takes $>10^3$\nyears for 99% of the H$_2$ to be destroyed.

Further away,\nfilaments are subdivided at bifurcation points. At the resolution of the maps,\nthe local number of filaments is 3 on average in 2D and 4 in 3D, depending on\nthe height of the peak.

While this kinetic structure is ubiquitous in supergravity\neffective field theories, realising a consistent UV complete model in e.g.\nstring theory is a non-trivial task. For one, one expects quantum corrections\narising in the vicinity of the pole which may spoil the typical attractor\ndynamics. As a conservative estimate of the range of validity of supergravity\nmodels of pole inflation we employ the weak gravity conjecture (WGC). We find\nthat this constrains the accessible part of the inflationary plateau by\nlimiting the decay constant of the axion partner. For the original single\ncomplex field models, the WGC does not even allow the inflaton to reach the\ninflationary plateau region. We analyze if evoking the assistance of $N$ scalar\nfields from the open string moduli helps addressing these problems.

Comparing these results with all\neight other JFCs with measured rotational changes, we deduce that none of the\nobserved large JFCs experiences significant spin changes. This suggests that\nlarge comet nuclei are less likely to undergo rotationally-driven splitting,\nand therefore more likely to survive more perihelion passages than smaller\nnuclei.

Actually such a quantum-classical\nmapping can not reveal the rich structures of low-energy excitations at these\nthree QCPs.

However, recent works have suggested the existence of an intermediate\npopulation in the bursts observed by the Swift satellite. Moreover, some\nresearchers have questioned the universality of the 2.0-second dividing line\nbetween short and long bursts: some bursts may be short but actually result\nfrom collapsars, the physical mechanism behind normally long bursts, and some\nlong ones may originate from mergers, the usual progenitors of short GRBs. In\nthis work, we focus on GRBs detected by the Fermi satellite and study the\ndistribution of their durations measured in the observer's reference frame and,\nfor those with known redshifts, in the bursts' reference frames. However, there\nare relatively few bursts with measured redshifts, and this makes an accurate\nstudy difficult. To overcome this problem, we follow [Zhang:2018] and determine\na \"pseudo-redshift\" from the correlation relation between the luminosity $L_p$\nand the energy $E_p$, both of which are calculated at the peak of the flux.\nInterestingly, we find that the uncertainties in the quantities observed and\nused in the determination of pseudo-redshifts, do affect the precision of the\nindividual results significantly, but they keep the distribution of\npseudo-redshifts very similar to that of the actual ones and thus allow us to\nuse pseudo-redshifts for our statistical study.

This can be attributed to environmental effects such as\nram pressure stripping and tidal interactions, which remove HI from the discs\nof galaxies. However, some spirals in low-density environments have also been\nobserved to have relatively low HI mass fractions. The low densities of the\nIntergalactic Medium and lack of nearby galaxies in such environments make ram\npressure stripping and tidal interactions unlikely candidates of gas removal.\nWhat then could be making these spirals HI deficient? Obreschkow et al.\nintroduced a parameter-free model for the neutral atomic gas fraction\n($f_{atm}$), in a symmetric equilibrium disc as a function of the global atomic\nstability parameter ($q$), which depends on specific angular momentum. In order\nto examine if this model accounts for HI-deficient galaxies in low-density\nenvironments, we have used the $M_{HI} ~-$ M$_{R}$ scaling relation to select\nsix HI-deficient spiral galaxies and observed them with the ATCA. By measuring\ntheir $f_{atm}$ and $q$ values we find that the galaxies owe their observed HI\ndeficiencies to low specific angular momenta. Additionally, we also find that\nthe central HI hole sizes of our sample galaxies are related to their $q$\nvalues, following the prediction of Obreschkow et al. This result brings to\nlight the importance of angular momentum in understanding the physics of the\ninterstellar medium in the discs of galaxies and consequently their evolution. \n\n"}

It is sufficient to\npower the cosmic rays above the knee of the cosmic-ray spectrum. Indeed, all\nhadronic cosmic rays could originate from the high-mass (>~ 100 M_o) stars that\ncollapse to black holes, in the process forming GRBs and FTs.

Our simulations follow the formation of galaxies in cubic volumes of\nside 100Mpc, in two versions of the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogony: the\nstandard, Omega=1 SCDM model and the flat, Omega=0.3 LCDM model. Over 2000\ngalaxies form in each of these simulations. We examine the rate at which gas\ncools and condenses into dark matter halos. This roughly tracks the cosmic star\nformation rate inferred from observations at various redshifts. Galaxies in the\nsimulations form gradually over time in the hierarchical fashion characteristic\nof the CDM cosmogony. In the LCDM model, substantial galaxies first appear at\nz=5 and the population builds up rapidly until z=1 after which the rate of\ngalaxy formation declines as cold gas is consumed and the cooling time of hot\ngas increases. In both cosmologies, the present-day K-band luminosity function\nof the simulated galaxies resembles observations. The galaxy autocorrelation\nfunctions differ significantly from those of the dark matter. At the present\nepoch there is little bias in either model between galaxies and dark matter on\nlarge scales, but a significant anti-bias on scales of 1Mpc/h and a positive\nbias on scales of 100kpc/h. The galaxy correlation function evolves little with\nredshift in the range z=0-3, and depends on the luminosity of the galaxy\nsample. The projected pairwise velocity dispersion of the galaxies is much\nlower than that of the dark matter on scales less than 2Mpc/h.

Abstract: There appears to exist a conflict between the standard structure formation\ntheory and the existence of the faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local\nGroup. Theoretical considerations suggest that a cold dark matter universe has\nbeen a very hostile place for the formation of small galaxies. In particular,\ngas would not have been able to cool and condense to form stars inside dark\nmatter halos with a velocity dispersion <10km/s since before the cosmological\nreionization epoch. In other words, one should not expect to see any major star\nformation activities in dwarf galaxies with a velocity dispersion <10km/s\nduring the past 12Gyr, according to the current structure formation theory. The\nreal universe, on the other hand, shows that all dwarf spheroidal galaxies in\nthe Local Group have velocity dispersions <10km/s and extended and recent star\nformation activities are quite common in them. This apparent conflict between\ncold dark matter models and local observations can be resolved, if one allows\nthe cold dark matter particles to decay relatively recently. The resolution\ncomes about in that the dwarf spheroidal galaxies with a velocity dispersion of\n\\~10km/s seen today were born, in this picture, in a small fraction of halos\nwith a velocity dispersion of ~20km/s, where gas can be retained and is able to\ncool and contract to form stars. The presently observed lower velocity\ndispersion ~10km/s of these dwarf spheroidal galaxies is a consequence of the\ndecay of one half of the dark matter in and subsequent expansion of the halos\nsince redshift z~2. \n\n"}

This result supports the\nsuggestion that the metallicity dependence of the Cepheid P-L relation may be\nstronger than expected. The high observed dispersions in the HST Cepheid P-L\nrelations have the further consequence that the bias due to incompleteness in\nthe P-L relation at faint magnitudes is more significant than previously\nthought. In the HST sample, galaxies at higher distance tend to have higher\nmetallicity. This means that when a full metallicity/incompleteness correction\nis made, a scale error in the published Cepheid distances is seen in the sense\nthat the published distance moduli are increasingly underestimates at larger\ndistances. This results in the average distance modulus to the four galaxies in\nthe Virgo cluster core increasing from (m-M)_0=31.2+-0.19 to (m-M)_0=31.8+-0.17\nwith similar increases for the Fornax and Ursa Major clusters.

The average kHz\nQPO frequency varies by about 0.6 Hz (0.07%) during a mHz QPO cycle over which\nthe average 2--5 keV count rate varies by about 60 c/s (4%). This is opposite\nto the frequency-count rate correlation observed in the same data on longer\ntime scales and hence constitutes the first example of a sign reversal in the\nfrequency-flux correlation related to the origin of the flux. Such a sign\nreversal is predicted by the radiative disk truncation model for the case where\nthe flux variations originate on the neutron star but are not due to disk\naccretion rate fluctuations.

Multicolour CCD observations yield photometric\nredshifts indicating that a significant fraction of the optical galaxies in\nthis region is at a redshift of z=0.3.

The diffuse radio-emission has a spectral index $\\alpha \\lesssim\n-0.5$, and is most likely synchrotron emission from relativistic charged\nparticles in an inter-galactic magnetic field. Furthermore, this optical/radio\nstructure is detected in X-rays by the ROSAT all-sky survey.

First we\ninvestigate the formation and the efficiency of the main neutron source. We\nparametrically vary the number of protons mixed from the envelope into the C12\nrich core. For p/C12 > 0.3, mainly N14 is produced, which represent a major\nneutron poison. The amount of C12 in the He intershell and the maximum value of\nthe time-integrated neutron flux are proportional. Then we generate detailed\ns-process calculations on the basis of stellar evolutionary models constructed\nwith three different codes. One code considers convective hydrodynamic\novershoot that depends on a free parameter f, and results in partial mixing\nbeyond convective boundaries, the most efficient third dredge up and the\nformation of the C13 pocket. For the other two codes an identical C13 pocket is\nintroduced in the post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations. The models\ngenerally reproduce the spectroscopically observed s-process enhancements. The\nresults of the cases without overshoot are remarkably similar. The code\nincluding hydrodynamic overshoot produces a He intershell composition near to\nthat observed in H-deficient central stars of planetary nebulae. As a result of\nthis intershell dredge up the neutron fluxes have a higher efficiency, both\nduring the interpulse periods and within thermal pulses.

We employ the\nstandard definition of the SG as a pair-free space between the last open field\nlines and the boundary of the pair plasma column which is expected to develop\nabove the bulk of the PC. The rationale for our revision is that the proper\ntreatment of primary acceleration within the pulsar SGs should take into\naccount the effect of the narrow geometry of the gap on the electrodynamics\nwithin the gap and also to include the effect of inertial frame dragging on the\nparticle acceleration. The combination of the effects of frame dragging and\ngeometrical screening in the gap region naturally gives rise to a regime of\nextended acceleration, that is not limited to \"favorably curved\" field lines as\nin earlier models, and the possibility of multiple-pair production by curvature\nphotons at very high altitudes, up to several stellar radii.

Bipolar knotty jets with periodic features and\nconstant velocity are well reproduced by the models. Several wind models with\nterminal velocities from a few tens of $\\kms$ up to $10^3$ $\\kms$ are\ncalculated, yielding outflows with linear momenta in the range $10^{36}-10^{40}\n\\gcms$, and kinetic energies in the range $10^{42}-10^{47} $ erg.

A unified picture of the Cluster\n  Luminosity Function Abstract: We constructed the composite luminosity function (LF) of clusters of galaxies\nin the five SDSS photometric bands u,g,r,i and z from the RASS-SDSS galaxy\ncluster catalog. Background and foreground galaxies are subtracted using both a\nlocal and a global background correction to take in account the presence of\nlarge scale structures and variations from field to field, respectively. The\ncomposite LF clearly shows two components: a bright-end LF with a classical\nslope of -1.25 in each photometric band, and a faint-end LF much steeper (-2.1\n<= \\alpha <= -1.6) in the dwarf galaxy region. The observed upturn of the faint\ngalaxies has a location ranging from -16 +5log(h) in the g band to -18.5\n+5log(h) in the z band. To study the universality of the cluster LF we compare\nthe individual cluster LFs with the composite luminosity function. We notice\nthat, in agreement with the composite LF, a single Schechter component is not a\ngood fit for the majority of the clusters. We fit a Schechter function to the\nbright-end of the individual clusters LFs in the magnitude region brighter than\nthe observed upturn of the dwarf galaxies.

However, this relation was\nverified only for a small sample of bursts with measured redshifts. We propose\nhere a test whether a burst with an unknown redshift can potentially satisfy\nthe EpEi relation. Applying this test to a large sample of BATSE bursts we find\nthat a significant fraction of those bursts cannot satisfy this relation. Our\ntest is sensitive only to dim and hard bursts and therefore this relation might\nstill hold as an inequality (i.e. there are no intrinsically bright and soft\nbursts). We conclude that the observed relation seen in the sample of bursts\nwith a known redshift might be influenced by observational biases and from the\ninability to locate and well localize hard and weak bursts that have only a\nsmall number of photons.

A fundamental cosmological constant,\nLambda, is the most natural candidate, but many dynamical mechanisms to\ngenerate an effective Lambda have been devised which postulate the existence of\na peculiar scalar field (so-called quintessence, and generalizations thereof).\nThese models are essentially ad hoc, but they lead to the attractive\npossibility of a time-evolving dark energy with a non-trivial equation of state\n(EOS).

As the number of supernovae is typically much\nsmaller than the number of sheared galaxies, the two-point correlation function\nof lensed Type Ia supernovae suffers from significantly increased shot noise.\nNeverthless, we find that the magnification map of a large sample of\nsupernovae, such as that expected from next generation dedicated searches, will\nbe easily measurable and provide an important cosmological tool. For example, a\nsearch over 20 sq. deg. over five years leading to a sample of ~ 10,000\nsupernovae would measure the angular power spectrum of cosmic magnification\nwith a cumulative signal-to-noise ratio of ~20. This detection can be further\nimproved once the supernova distance measurements are cross-correlated with\nmeasurements of the foreground galaxy distribution. The magnification maps made\nusing supernovae can be used for important cross-checks with traditional\nlensing shear statistics obtained in the same fields, as well as help to\ncontrol systematics. We discuss two applications of supernova magnification\nmaps: the breaking of the mass-sheet degeneracy when estimating masses of\nshear-detected clusters, and constraining the second-order corrections to weak\nlensing observables. \n\n"}

Nuclear luminosities reach values down to 10**38\nerg/s. The shape of the distribution of X-ray parameters is affected by the\npresence of Compton-thick objects (> 30% among type 2s). The latter have been\nidentified either directly from their intense FeK line and flat X-ray spectra,\nor indirectly with flux diagnostic diagrams which use isotropic indicators.\nAfter taking into account these highly absorbed sources, we find that (i) the\nintrinsic X-ray spectral properties (i.e., spectral shapes and luminosities\nabove 2 keV) are consistent between type 1 and type 2 Sey, as expected from\n``unified models'', (ii) Sey galaxies as a whole are distributed fairly\ncontinuously over the entire range of Nh, between 10**20 and 10**25 cm**-2, and\n(iii) while Sey 1s tend to have lower Nh and Sey 2s tend to have the highest,\nwe find 30% and 10% exceptions, respectively.

The corresponding jet power 1.4E45\nerg/sec is enough to offset most of the radiative losses from the cooling gas.\nThe jet power exceeds the radio synchrotron power by ~4000 times, making this\none of the most radiatively inefficient radio sources known. The large jet\npower implies that the cD's supermassive black hole accreted at a mean rate of\n  ~0.3 solar masses per year over the last 40 Myr or so, which is a small\nfraction of the Eddington accretion rate for a 10E9 solar mass black hole.

The variations of the emission line profiles suggest the presence of an\nionised gas outflow in the direction perpendicular to the galaxy disk.\n(abridged) \n\n"}

We present a possible explanation for the formation and\nconfinement of such rings in optically thin circumstellar disks, without\ninvoking shepherding planets. If an enhancement of dust grains (e.g., due to a\ncatastrophic collision) occurs somewhere in the disk, photoelectric emission\nfrom the grains can heat the gas to temperatures well above that of the dust.\nThe gas orbits with super(sub)-Keplerian speeds inward (outward) of the\nassociated pressure maximum. This tends to concentrate the grains into a narrow\nregion. The rise in dust density leads to further heating and a stronger\nconcentration of grains. A narrow dust ring forms as a result of this\ninstability. We show that this mechanism not only operates around early-type\nstars that have high UV fluxes, but also around stars with spectral types as\nlate as K. This implies that this process is generic and may have occurred\nduring the lifetime of each circumstellar disk.

Future microwave anisotropy\nsatellites will be able to detect this signature. The production and mixing of\nmetals by an early population of stars provides a natural explanation to the\nmetallicity, ~1% solar, found in the intergalactic medium at redshifts z<5. The\nNext Generation Space Telescope (NGST) will be able to image directly the\n``first light'' from these stars. With its nJy sensitivity, NGST is expected to\ndetect >10^3 star clusters per square arcminute at z>10. The brightest sources,\nhowever, might be early quasars. The infrared flux from an Eddington\nluminosity, 10^6 solar mass, black hole at z=10 is 10 nJy at 1 micron, easily\ndetectable with NGST.

In this paper, we present extensive synthetic HB simulations to\ndetermine whether peculiar distributions in the underlying physical parameters\nare needed to explain the observed HB morphology. We find that a unimodal mass\ndistribution along the HB can satisfactorily account for the observed HB\nbimodality, *provided* the mass dispersion is substantially larger than usually\ninferred for the Galactic globular clusters. In this case, NGC 6229 should have\na well-populated, extended blue tail. A truly bimodal distribution in HB masses\ncan also satisfactorily account for the observed HB morphology, although in\nthis case the existence of an extended blue tail is not necessarily implied.\nThe other two well-known bimodal-HB clusters, NGC 1851 and NGC 2808, are\nbriefly analyzed. While the HB morphology of NGC 1851 can also be reproduced\nwith a unimodal mass distribution assuming a large mass dispersion, the same is\nnot true of NGC 2808, for which a bimodal, and possibly multimodal, mass\ndistribution seems definitely required.\n  The problem of gaps on the blue HB is also discussed. Applying the standard\nHawarden (1971) and Newell (1973) chi-squared test, we find that the NGC 6229\ngap is significant at the 99.7% level. However, in a set of 1,000 simulations,\nblue-HB gaps comparable to the observed one are present in ~ 6 - 9% of all\ncases.

The analysis suggests the difference between disks and lanes is\nintrinsic and not due to different viewing angles. Central emission-line gas is\ndetected in all galaxies. Extended low-surface-brightness emission is always\nassociated with the dust features. In a subsequent paper we will present a\ndetailed analysis of the relation between these central properties and the\nnuclear activity. \n\n"}

Recent progress in numerical\ntechniques made it possible to simulate halos in large volumes with a such\naccuracy that halos survive in dense environments of groups and clusters of\ngalaxies. Dark matter halos in simulations look like real galaxies, and, thus,\ncan be used to study the biases - differences between galaxies and the dark\nmatter. For the standard LCDM model we find that the correlation function and\nthe power spectrum of galaxy-size halos at z=0 are antibiased on scales\nr<5Mpc/h and k=(0.15-30)h/Mpc. The biases depend on scale, redshift, and\ncircular velocities of selected halos. Two processes seem to define the\nevolution of the spatial bias: (1) statistical bias (or peak bias) and merger\nbias (merging of galaxies, which happens preferentially in groups, reduces the\nnumber of galaxies, but does not affect the clustering of the dark matter).\nThere are two kinds of velocity bias. The pair-wise velocity bias is\nb_12=0.6-0.8 at r<5Mpc/h, z=0. This bias mostly reflects the spatial bias and\nprovides almost no information on the relative velocities of the galaxies and\nthe dark matter.

Here we\ncalculate the predicted flux of high energy gamma rays, neutrinos and cosmic\nray antiprotons and protons as a function of the scale of symmetry breaking at\nwhich the strings are produced and as a function of the initial energy m_J of\nthe particle jets which result from the string decay.

{"id": "physics/9906059", "contents": "Title: Propulsion Through Electromagnetic Self-Sustained Acceleration Abstract: As is known the repulsion of the volume elements of an uniformly accelerating\ncharge or a charge supported in an uniform gravitational field accounts for the\nelectromagnetic contribution to the charge's inertial and gravitational mass,\nrespectively. This means that the mutual repulsion of the volume elements of\nthe charge produces the resistance to its accelerated motion. Conversely, the\neffect of electromagnetic attraction of opposite charges enhances the\naccelerated motion of the charges provided that they have been initially\nuniformly accelerated or supported in an uniform gravitational field. The\nsignificance of this effect is that it constitutes a possibility of altering\ninertia and gravitation. \n\n"}
