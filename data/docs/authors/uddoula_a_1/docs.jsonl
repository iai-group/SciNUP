Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The mid-infrared spectra exhibit strong PAH features, and a warm\ndust continuum.

By performing an ensemble of radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show that such discs fragment within a few thousand years, and\nproduce mainlybrown dwarf (BDs) stars, but also planetary mass (PM) stars and\nvery low-mass hydrogen-burning (HB) stars. Most of the the PM stars and BDs are\nejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these\nstars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years\nthe Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and\ntwo much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.\nThere is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs\ntend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be\nscattered even further out, or even into the field. BDs form with discs of a\nfew Mj and radii of a few tens of AU, and they are more likely to retain these\ndiscs if they remain bound to the primary star. Binaries form by pairing of the\nnewly-formed stars in the disc, giving a low-mass binary fraction of ~0.16.\nThese binaries include close and wide BD/BD binaries and BD/PM binaries.

In general, psi cannot be measured, but for transiting planets\none can measure the angle lambda between the sky projections of the two axes\nvia the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.

In one of the plausible models for explaining the\nphenomenon, the modulation is caused by the effects of a magnetic field.

This scenario was developed to replace and extend the\nso-called standard cooling scenario to include neutrino emission from the\nCooper pair breaking and formation processes that occur near the critical\ntemperature for superfluid/superconductor pairing.\n  Recently, it has been found that Cooper-pair neutrino emission from the\nvector channel is suppressed by a large factor compared to the original\nestimates that violated vector current conservation. We show that Cooper-pair\nneutrino emission remains, nevertheless, an efficient cooling mechanism through\nthe axial channel. As a result, the elimination of neutrino emission from\nCooper-paired nucleons through the vector channel has only minor effects on the\nlong-term cooling of neutron stars within the minimal cooling paradigm. We\nfurther quantify precisely the effect of the size of the neutron 3P2 gap and\ndemonstrate that consistency between observations and the minimal cooling\nparadigm requires that the critical temperature T_c for this gap covers a range\nof values between T_c^min < 0.2 x 10^9 K up to T_c^max > 0.5 \\times 10^9 K in\nthe core of the star. In addition, it is required that young neutron stars have\nheterogenous envelope compositions: some must have light-element compositions\nand others must have heavy-element compositions.

With increasing age, the velocity ellipsoid\nincreases in size and becomes appreciably more spherical, turns toward the\ndirection of the Galactic center, and loses angular momentum. The shape of the\nvelocity ellipsoid remains far from equilibrium. With increasing metallicity,\nthe velocity ellipsoid for stars of mixed age increases in size, displays a\nweak tendency to become more spherical, and turns toward the direction of the\nGalactic center (with these changes occurring substantially more rapidly in the\ntransition through the metallicity [Fe/H]= -0.25). Thus, the ellipsoid changes\nsimilarly to the way it does with age; however, with decreasing metallicity,\nthe rotational velocity about the Galactic center monotonically increases,\nrather than decreases(!). Moreover, the power-law indices for the age\ndependences of the axes depend on the metallicity, and display a maximum near\n[Fe/H]=-0.1. The age dependences of all the velocity-ellipsoid parameters for\nstars with equal metallicity are roughly the same.

Based on these calculations, we also\nsimulate the time evolution of thermal emission from the shock-heated dust in\nthe SNR and compare the results with the observations of Cas A SNR. We find\nthat the total mass of dust formed in the SN IIb is as large as 0.167 M_sun but\nthe average radius of dust is smaller than 0.01 mum and is significantly\ndifferent from those in SNe II-P with the massive H-envelope. In the explosion\nwith the small-mass H-envelope, the expanding He core undergoes little\ndeceleration, so that the gas density in the He core is too low for large-sized\ngrains to form. In addition, the low-mass H-envelope of the SN IIb leads to the\nearly arrival of the reverse shock at the dust-forming region. If the CSM is\nmore or less spherical, therefore, the newly formed grains would be completely\ndestroyed in the relatively dense shocked gas for the CSM density of n_H > 0.1\ncm^{-3}. However, the actual CSM is likely to be non-spherical, so that a part\nof grains could be ejected into the ISM without being shocked. We demonstrate\nthat the time evolution of the SED by thermal dust emission is sensitive to the\nambient gas density and structure that affects the passage of the reverse shock\ninto the ejecta. Thus, the SED evolution well reflects the evolution of dust\nthrough erosion by sputtering and stochastic heating. For Cas A, we consider\nthe CSM produced by the steady mass loss of ~8x10^{-5} M_sun/yr during the\nsupergiant phase.

Gamma ~-1.5 for the PDM\nand -1 for the BDM, inside Rvmax, and is steeper outside. We detect little\nspatial bias between the subhalo populations and the DM of the main halos.

This makes this system a very\ninteresting target for asteroseismic studies. This work is devoted to the\ndetermination of the internal metallicity of this star, linked with its\n$\\lambda$ Bootis nature (i.e., solar surface abundances of light elements, and\nsubsolar surface abundances of heavy elements), taking advantage of its\n$\\gamma$ Doradus pulsations. This is the most accurate way to obtain this\ninformation, and this is the first time such a study is performed for a\nplanetary-system-host star.

We have applied the Frequency Ratio\nMethod (FRM) and the Time Dependent Convection theory (TDC) to estimate the\nmode identification, the Brunt-Va\\\"is\\\"al\\\"a frequency integral and the mode\ninstability, making the selection of the possible models. When the\nnon-seismological constraints (i.e its position in the HR diagram) are used,\nthe solar abundance models are discarded. This result contradicts one of the\nmain hypothesis for explaining the $\\lambda$ Bootis nature, namely the\naccretion/diffusion of gas by a star with solar abundance. Therefore, according\nto these results, a revision of this hypothesis is needed. The inclusion of\naccurate internal chemical mixing processes seems to be necessary to explain\nthe peculiar abundances observed in the surface of stars with internal subsolar\nmetallicities.

The\npresence, strength and shape of these silicate features are used to infer disk\nproperties for these systems. About 8% of the disks have 30/13 micron flux\nratios consistent with cold disks with inner holes or gaps, and 3% of the disks\nshow PAH emission.

A\nwhite dwarf merger has also been suggested to explain the formation of rare\ntypes of stars like R CrB, extreme helium or He sdO stars.

The orbital parameters of the close binary have been determined from\ntime resolved spectroscopy. Since GD 687 is a single-lined binary, the spectra\ncontain only information about the subdwarf primary and its orbit. From high\nresolution spectra the projected rotational velocity was derived.

In this\npaper we investigate how the properties of such shells influence the SN\nlightcurve by conducting numerical simulations of the interaction between an\nexpanding SN and a circumstellar shell ejected a few years prior to core\ncollapse. Our parameter study explores how the emergent luminosity depends on a\nrange of circumstellar shell masses, velocities, geometries, and wind mass-loss\nrates, as well as variations in the SN mass and energy. We find that the shell\nmass is the most important parameter, in the sense that higher shell masses (or\nhigher ratios of M_shell/M_SN) lead to higher peak luminosities and higher\nefficiencies in converting shock energy into visual light. Lower mass shells\ncan also cause high peak luminosities if the shell is slow or if the SN ejecta\nare very fast, but only for a short time. Sustaining a high luminosity for\ndurations of more than 100 days requires massive circumstellar shells of order\n10 M_sun or more.

The newly obtained data confirmed the\nbasic findings reported in Kato et al.

There was a systematic\ndifference in period derivatives for systems with superhump periods longer than\n0.075 d between this study and Kato et al. (2009). We suggest that this\ndifference is possibly caused by the relative lack of frequently outbursting SU\nUMa-type dwarf novae in this period regime in the present study. We recorded a\nstrong beat phenomenon during the 2009 superoutburst of IY UMa. The close\ncorrelation between the beat period and superhump period suggests that the\nchanging angular velocity of the apsidal motion of the elliptical disk is\nresponsible for the variation of superhump periods.

Although the gamma-process has been successful in\nproducing a large range of p-nuclei, two mass regions remain problematic, A<110\nand 150<A<165, where a number of p-nuclei are severely underproduced. The\norigin of the problems is yet to be identified. A large number of unstable\nnuclei with only theoretically predicted reaction rates are included in the\nreaction network and thus the nuclear input may involve uncertainties.\nDeficiencies in charged-particle optical potentials at gamma-process\ntemperatures have been found for nuclei at stability. On the other hand, the\ngamma-process conditions (temperature profiles, entropy of the O shell, seed\ncomposition) also sensitively depend on details of the stellar structure and\nevolution, as well as on the initial metallicity. Nevertheless, especially the\ndeficient low-mass p-nuclei may call for an additional production process or\nsite, such as production in (subChandrasekhar) type Ia supernovae.

The disentangled spectra of a binary star system are\nvery well suited to spectroscopic analysis but for one problem: the absolute\nspectral line depths are unknown because this information is not contained in\nthe original spectra (unless there is one taken in eclipse) without making\nassumptions about the spectral characteristics of the component stars.

Given the mass loss rates estimated\nfrom current observations --- and from theoretical arguments --- magnetic\nfields will dominate the flow provided that field strength near the planet is\ngreater than $\\sim1$ gauss, comparable to the surface fields of the Sun and\nJupiter. The problem can be separated into an inner regime, near the planet,\nwhere the outflow is launched, and an outer regime where the flow follows\n(primarily) stellar field lines and interacts with the stellar wind. This paper\nconcentrates on the flow in the inner regime. For a dipole planetary field with\na spatially constant background contribution, we construct a set of orthogonal\ncoordinates that follow the field lines and determine the corresponding\ndifferential operators.

RY Scuti is an extremely rare example of a\nmassive binary star caught in this brief but important phase. Its toroidal\nnebula indicates equatorial mass loss during RLOF, while the mass-gaining star\nis apparently embedded in an opaque accretion disk. RY Scuti's toroidal nebula\nhas two components: an inner ionised double-ring system, and an outer dust\ntorus that is twice the size of the ionised rings. We present two epochs of\nLband Keck NGS-AO images of the dust torus, plus three epochs of HST images of\nthe ionised gas rings. Proper motions show that the inner ionised rings and the\nouter dust torus came from two separate ejection events roughly 130 and 250 yr\nago. This suggests that RLOF in massive contact binaries can be accompanied by\neruptive and episodic burst of mass loss, reminiscent of LBVs. We speculate\nthat the repeating outbursts may arise in the mass gainer from instabilities\nassociated with a high accretion rate. If discrete mass-loss episodes in other\nRLOF binaries are accompanied by luminous outbursts, they might contribute to\nthe population of extragalactic optical transients.

However, using\nrealistic, fully line-blanketed atmospheres at solar abundances, the key role\nof DR controlling these emission features is superseded -- for O-star\nconditions -- by the strength of the stellar wind and metallicity. In the case\nof wind-free models, the resulting lower ionizing EUV-fluxes severely suppress\nthe emission. As the mass-loss rate is increased, pumping through the NIII\nresonance line(s) in the presence of a near-photospheric velocity field results\nin a net optical triplet line emission. A comparison with results from CMFGEN\nis mostly satisfactory, except for the range 30 kK < Teff < 35 kK, where CMFGEN\ntriggers the triplet emission at lower Teff than FASTWIND.

If planets\nare responsible for defining the inner edge of the gap, they could interact\nwith the material on time scales commensurate with what is observed for the\nvariations in the dust, while other disk instabilities (thermal,\nmagnetorotational) would operate there on longer time scales than we observe\nfor the inner dust belt. For SAO 206462, the orbital period would likely be 1-3\nyears. If the changes are being induced in the disk material closer to the star\nthan the gap, a variety of mechanisms (disk instabilities, interactions via\nplanets) might be responsible for the changes seen. The He I feature is most\nlikely due to a wind whose orientation changes with respect to the observer on\ntime scales of a day or less. To further constrain the origin of the gas and\ndust emission will require multiple spectroscopic and interferometric\nobservations on both shorter and longer time scales that have been sampled so\nfar. \n\n"}

Magnetic chemically peculiar stars Abstract: About 10% of upper main sequence stars are characterised by the presence of\nchemical peculiarities, often found together with a structured magnetic field.\nThe atmospheres of most of those chemically peculiar stars present surface\nspots, leading to photometric variability caused by rotational modulation. The\nstudy of the light curves of those stars therefore, permits a precise\nmeasurement of their rotational period, which is important to study stellar\nevolution and to plan further detailed observations. We analysed the light\ncurves of 1028 chemically peculiar stars obtained with the STEREO spacecraft.\nWe present here the results obtained for the 337 magnetic chemically peculiar\nstars in our sample. Thanks to the cadence and stability of the photometry,\nSTEREO data are perfectly suitable to study variability signals with a\nperiodicity typical of magnetic chemically peculiar stars. Using a matched\nfilter algorithm and then two different period searching algorithms, we\ncompiled a list of 82 magnetic chemically peculiar stars for which we measured\na reliable rotational period; for 48 of them this is the first measurement of\ntheir rotational period. The remaining 255 stars are likely to be constant,\nalthough we cannot exclude the presence of long period variability. In some\ncases, the presence of blending or systematic effects prevented us from\ndetecting any reliable variability and in those cases we classified the star as\nconstant. For each star we classified as variable, we determined temperature,\nluminosity, mass and fractional age, but the limited statistics, biased towards\nthe shorter periods, prevented us from finding any evolutionary trend of the\nrotational period. For a few stars, the comparison between their projected\nrotational velocity and equatorial velocity let us believe that their real\nrotational period might be longer than that found here and previously obtained. \n\n"}

In addition,\nsigns of orbital phase dependent photometric variations, sometimes seen quite\nearly in the development of nova outbursts, are hard to interpret in the\nframework of optically thick envelopes and especially winds. A general\ndiscussion for belief in the presence of optically thick winds with increasing\nejection velocities during the early stages of novae after their explosion,\nmust be given. This has to be done in order to clarify ideas about novae as\nwell as to contribute in particular to the understanding of the behaviour of\nnovae V1500 Cyg and V1493 Aql showing phase dependent variations during very\nearly decline after the outburst. Possible ways of overcoming the apparent\ncontradiction of phase dependent variations through the production of\ndeviations from spherical symmetry of the winds, are looked at and order of\nmagnitude estimates are made for different theoretical scenarios, which might\nproduce such deviations. It is found that large deviations from spherical\nsymmetry of the optically thick winds in early phases after the explosion can\neasily explain the problem of variations.

We combine ROSAT, GALEX and 2MASS observations to form the\nSED from 2.2 mic to 2 keV. We find the following: 1. The distribution of the\nH-alpha FWHM values is independent of luminosity. 2. The observed mean\noptical-UV SED is well matched by a fixed shape SED of luminous quasars, which\nscales linearly with L_bHa, and a host galaxy contribution. 3. The host galaxy\nr-band (fibre) luminosity function follows well the luminosity function of\ninactive non-emission line galaxies (NEG), consistent with a fixed fraction of\n~3% of NEG hosting an AGN, regardless of the host luminosity. 4. The hosts of\nlower luminosity AGN have a mean z band luminosity and u-z colour which are\nidentical to NEG with the same redshift distribution. With increasing L_bHa the\nAGN hosts become bluer and less luminous than NEG. The implied increasing star\nformation rate with L_bHa is consistent with the relation for SDSS type 2 AGN\nof similar bolometric luminosity. 5. The optical-UV SED of the more luminous\nAGN shows a small dispersion, consistent with dust reddening of a blue SED, as\nexpected for thermal thin accretion disc emission. 6. There is a rather tight\nrelation of nuL_nu(2 keV) and L_bHa, which provides a useful probe for\nunobscured (true) type 2 AGN. 7.

The profile showed variations attributed to the\nrotation of gas in a non-axisymmetric Keplerian accretion disk, ionized by a\nvarying radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) located in the inner\nparts of the disk.

We also discovered shorter timescale\nvariations than in the previous observations: (1) the first, of ~7 days, is\ninterpreted as due to \"reverberation\" of the variation of the ionizing source\nluminosity, and the timescale of 7 days as the light crossing time between the\nsource and the accretion disk; this new timescale and its interpretation\nprovides a distance between the emitting gas and the supermassive black hole\nand as such introduces a new constraint on its mass; (2) the second, of\napproximately 5 months, was attributed to the rotation of a spiral arm in the\ndisk, which was found to occur on the dynamical timescale.

The optical\nspectrum exhibits broad emission features of [O I], [O II], [O III], H-alpha,\nH-beta, and [Fe II]. The last decade of evolution has exhibited a strengthening\nof the oxygen transitions, evidence that the late-time emission is powered by\nincreasingly metal-rich SN ejecta crossing the reverse shock. The H-alpha\nluminosity requires that SN 1998S is still interacting with dense circumstellar\nmaterial (CSM), probably produced by the strong wind of a red supergiant\nprogenitor at least ~1000 years before explosion. The emission lines exhibit\nasymmetric blueshifted profiles, which implies that the receding hemisphere of\nthe SN is obscured by dust. The [O III] line, in particular, exhibits a\ncomplete suppression of its red wing. This could be the result of the expected\nwavelength dependence for dust extinction or a smaller radial distribution for\n[O III]. In the latter case, the red wing of [O III] could be absorbed by core\ndust, while both the blue and red wings are absorbed by dust within the cool\ndense shell between the forward and reverse shocks; this interpretation could\nexplain why late-time [O III] emission from SNe is often weaker than models\npredict. The [O I] line exhibits double-peaked structure on top of the broader\nunderlying profile, possibly due to emission from individual clumps of ejecta\nor ring-like structures of metal-rich debris.

From simplified one-dimensional models with radial jet structure, we\nfind that a decrease in the relativistic pressure due to the interacting\nrarefaction waves in the central zone of the jet transiently yields a more\npowerful boost of the bulk jet than that expected from single rarefaction\nacceleration.

Abstract: The radio pulsar models based on the existence of an inner accelerating gap\nlocated above the polar cap rely on the existence of a small scale, strong\nsurface magnetic field $B_s$. This field exceeds the dipolar field $B_d$,\nresponsible for the braking of the pulsar rotation, by at least one order of\nmagnitude. Neither magnetospheric currents nor small scale field components\ngenerated during neutron star's birth can provide such field structures in old\npulsars. While the former are too weak to create $B_s \\gtrsim 5\\times\n10^{13}$G$\\;\\gg B_d$, the ohmic decay time of the latter is much shorter than\n$10^6$ years. We suggest that a large amount of magnetic energy is stored in a\ntoroidal field component that is confined in deeper layers of the crust, where\nthe ohmic decay time exceeds $10^7$ years. This toroidal field may be created\nby various processes acting early in a neutron star's life. The Hall drift is a\nnon-linear mechanism that, due to the coupling between different components and\nscales, may be able to create the demanded strong, small scale, magnetic spots.\nTaking into account both realistic crustal microphysics and a minimal cooling\nscenario, we show that, in axial symmetry, these field structures are created\non a Hall time scale of $10^3$-$10^4$ years. These magnetic spots can be\nlong-lived, thereby fulfilling the pre-conditions for the appearance of the\nradio pulsar activity. Such magnetic structures created by the Hall drift are\nnot static, and dynamical variations on the Hall time scale are expected in the\npolar cap region. \n\n"}

However, no consensus\ncurrently exists as to which progenitor scenario is the correct one, or whether\nthe observed SN Ia rate is produced by a combination of both channels. Unlike a\nDD progenitor a SD progenitor is expected to emit supersoft X-rays for a\nprolonged period of time (~1 Myr) as a result of the burning of accreted matter\non the surface of the WD. An argument against the SD channel as a significant\nproducer of SNe type Ia has been the lack of observed supersoft X-ray sources\n(SSS) and the lower-than-expected integrated soft X-ray flux from elliptical\ngalaxies.\n  We wish to determine if it is possible to obscure the supersoft X-ray\nemission from a nuclear burning white dwarf in an accreting single degenerate\nbinary system.

A recent study by us,\nviz., that of Banerjee, Kroupa & Oh (2012; Paper I), which involves realistic\nN-body computations of star clusters mimicking R136, indicates that such\n\"super-canonical\" (SC) stars can be formed out of a dense stellar population\nwith a canonical initial mass function (IMF) through dynamically induced\nmergers of the most massive binaries. Here we study the formation of SC stars\nin the R136 models of Paper I in detail. To avoid forming extraneous SC stars\nfrom initially highly eccentric primordial binaries as in Paper I, we compute\nadditional models with only initially circular primordial binaries. We also\ntake into account the mass-evolution of the SC stars using detailed stellar\nevolutionary models that incorporate updated treatments of stellar winds. We\nfind that SC stars begin to form via dynamical mergers of massive binaries from\napprox. 1 Myr cluster age. We obtain SC stars with initial masses up to approx.\n250 M_sun from these computations. Multiple SC stars are found to remain bound\nto the cluster simultaneously within a SC-lifetime. These properties of the\ndynamically formed SC stars are consistent with those observed in R136.

The UBVRI light curves\ndemonstrated an interesting two-stage evolution during the nebular phase, which\nalmost flatten out after about 90 days from the optical maximum. SN 2010jl has\none of the highest intrinsic H_alpha luminosity ever recorded for a SN IIn,\nespecially at late phase, suggesting a strong interaction of SN ejecta with the\ndense circumstellar material (CSM) ejected by the progenitor. This is also\nindicated by the remarkably strong Balmer lines persisting in the optical\nspectra. One interesting spectral evolution about SN 2010jl is the appearance\nof asymmetry of the Balmer lines. These lines can be well decomposed into a\nnarrow component and an intermediate-width component. The intermediate-width\ncomponent showed a steady increase in both strength and blueshift with time\nuntil t ~ 400 days after maximum, but it became less blueshifted at t ~ 500\ndays when the line profile appeared relatively symmetric again. Owing to that a\npure reddening effect will lead to a sudden decline of the light curves and a\nprogressive blueshift of the spectral lines, we therefore propose that the\nasymmetric profiles of H lines seen in SN 2010jl is unlikely due to the\nextinction by newly formed dust inside the ejecta, contrary to the explanation\nby some early studies. Based on a simple CSM-interaction model, we speculate\nthat the progenitor of SN 2010jl may suffer a gigantic mass loss (~ 30-50\nM_sun) in a few decades before explosion. Considering a slow moving stellar\nwind (e.g., ~ 28 km/s) inferred for the preexisting, dense CSM shell and the\nextremely high mass-loss rate (1-2 M_sun per yr), we suggest that the\nprogenitor of SN 2010jl might have experienced a red supergiant stage and\nexplode finally as a post-red supergiant star with an initial mass above 30-40\nM_sun. \n\n"}

Abstract: The Local Group is often seen to be a quiescent environment without\nsignificant merger events. However an ancient major merger may have occurred in\nthe most massive galaxy. Numerical simulations have shown that tidal tails\nformed during gas-rich major mergers are long-lived and could be responsible\nfor old stellar streams and likely induce the formation of tidal dwarf galaxies\n(TDGs). Using several hydrodynamical simulations we have investigated the most\nprominent tidal tail formed during the first passage, which is gas-rich and\ncontains old and metal poor stars. We discovered several striking coincidences\nafter comparing its location and motion to those of the Milky Way (MW) and of\nthe Magellanic Clouds (MCs). First, the tidal tail is sweeping a relatively\nsmall volume in which the MW precisely lies. Because the geometry of the merger\nis somehow fixed by the anisotropic properties of the Giant Stream (GS), we\nevaluate the chance of the MW to be at such a rendez-vous with this gigantic\ntidal tail to be 5 %. Second, the velocity of the tidal tail matches the LMC\nproper motion, and reproduce quite well the geometrical and angular momentum\nproperties of the MW dwarfs, i.e. the so-called disk of satellites, better\ncalled Vast Polar Structure (VPOS). Third, the simulation of the tidal tail\nreveals one of the formed TDG with mass and location almost comparable to those\nof the LMC. Our present modeling is however too limited to study the detailed\ninteraction of gas-rich TDGs with the potential of the MW, and a complementary\nstudy is required to test whether the dwarf intrinsic properties can be\naccounted for by our scenario. Nevertheless this study suggests a causal link\nbetween an ancient, gas-rich major merger at the M31 location, and several\nenigma in the Local Group, the GS, the VPOS, and the presence of the MCs. \n\n"}

The ensuing collision between the fast ejecta and the CSM causes an\nincrease in brightness observed at the end of 1844, followed by a sustained\nhigh-luminosity phase lasting for 10-15 years that matches the historical light\ncurve. The emergent luminosity is powered by CSM interaction, analogous to the\nprocess in luminous Type IIn supernovae, except with 10 times lower explosion\nenergy and at slower speeds (causing a longer duration and lower emergent\nluminosity). Such an explosive event provides a natural explanation for the\nlight curve evolution, but also accounts for a number of puzzling attributes of\nthe Homunculus nebula: (1) rough equipartition of total radiated and kinetic\nenergy, (2) the double-shell structure of the Homunculus, (3) the apparent\nsingle age and Hubble-like flow resulting from the thin swept-up shell, (4) the\ncomplex mottled appearance of the polar lobes in HST images, arising from\nRaleigh-Taylor or Vishniac instabilities, (5) efficient and rapid dust\nformation, as seen in Type IIn supernovae, and (6) the fast (5000 km/s)\nmaterial outside the Homunculus, arising from the acceleration of the forward\nshock upon exiting the dense CSM. In principle, the bipolar shape has already\nbeen explained in earlier studies of interacting winds, except that here the\nCSM interaction occurs over only 10 years, producing a thin shell with the\nresulting structures then frozen-in to the expanding bipolar nebula.

We calculate the typical Jeans mass using\nhigh-resolution hydrodynamic simulations coupled with a fully radiative model\nfor the ISM, which yields a parameterisation of the IMF characteristic mass as\na function of galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We then calculate the star\nformation histories of galaxies utilising an equilibrium galaxy growth model\ncoupled with constraints on the star formation histories set by abundance\nmatching models. We find that at early times, energetic coupling between dust\nand gas drive warm conditions in the ISM, yielding bottom-light/top- heavy IMFs\nassociated with large ISM Jeans masses for massive star-forming galaxies. Owing\nto the remnants of massive stars that formed during the top-heavy phases at\nearly times, the resultant M/L_K(sigma) in massive galaxies at the present\nepoch is increased relative to the non- varying IMF case. At late times, lower\ncosmic ray fluxes allow for cooler ISM temperatures in massive galaxies, and\nhence newly formed clusters will exhibit bottom-heavy IMFs, further increasing\nM/L_K(sigma).

The Two Populations With [Fe/H] < -3.0 Abstract: We discuss the carbon-normal and carbon-rich populations of Galactic halo\nstars having [Fe/H] < -3.0, utilizing chemical abundances from high-resolution,\nhigh-S/N model-atmosphere analyses. The C-rich population represents ~28% of\nstars below [Fe/H] = -3.1, with the present C-rich sample comprising 16 CEMP-no\nstars, and two others with [Fe/H] ~ -5.5 and uncertain classification. The\npopulation is O-rich ([O/Fe] > +1.5); the light elements Na, Mg, and Al are\nenhanced relative to Fe in half the sample; and for Z > 20 (Ca) there is little\nevidence for enhancements relative to solar values. These results are best\nexplained in terms of the admixing and processing of material from H-burning\nand He-burning regions as achieved by nucleosynthesis in zero-heavy-element\nmodels in the literature of \"mixing and fallback\" supernovae (SNe); of\nrotating, massive and intermediate mass stars; and of Type II SNe with\nrelativistic jets. The available (limited) radial velocities offer little\nsupport for the C-rich stars with [Fe/H] < -3.1 being binary. More data are\nrequired before one could conclude that binarity is key to an understanding of\nthis population. We suggest that the C-rich and C-normal populations result\nfrom two different gas cooling channels in the very early Universe, of material\nthat formed the progenitors of the two populations. The first was cooling by\nfine-structure line transitions of CII and OI (to form the C-rich population);\nthe second, while not well-defined (perhaps dust-induced cooling?), led to the\nC-normal group. In this scenario, the C-rich population contains the oldest\nstars currently observed. \n\n"}

We search for galaxy pairs with a transverse separation\nr_p < 25 h^{-1} kpc and a velocity difference Delta v < 500 km s^{-1} using the\nVIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) and early data from the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey\n(VUDS) that comprise a sample of 1111 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts\nmeasurements at redshifts 1.8 < z < 4 in the COSMOS, ECDFS, and VVDS-02h\nfields. We analyse their spectra and associated visible and near-infrared\nphotometry to assess the main properties of merging galaxies that have an\naverage stellar mass M_{star}=2.3 x 10^{10} M_{sun} at these redshifts. Using\nthe 12 physical pairs found in our sample we obtain a first estimate of the\nmerger fraction at these rdshifts, fmerg ~(15-20)%. The pair separations\nindicate that these pairs will merge within 1 Gyr, on average, with each\nproducing a more massive galaxy by the time the cosmic star formation peaks at\nz~1-2. From the average mass ratio between galaxies in the pairs, the stellar\nmass of the resulting galaxy after merging will be ~60% larger than the most\nmassive galaxy in the pair before merging. We conclude that major merging of\ngalaxy pairs is on-going at 2<z<4 and significantly contributing to the major\nassembly phase of galaxies at this early epoch. \n\n"}

In 2009, a warm Spitzer survey observed 30 SNe IIn\ndiscovered in 2003 - 2008 and detected 10 SNe at distances out to 175 Mpc with\nunreported late-time infrared emission, in some cases more than 5 years\npost-discovery. For this single epoch of data, the warm-dust parameters suggest\nthe presence of a radiative heating source consisting of optical/X-ray emission\ncontinuously generated by ongoing CSM interaction. Here we present\nmulti-wavelength follow-up observations of this sample of 10 SNe IIn and the\nwell-studied Type IIn SN 2010jl. A recent epoch of Spitzer observations reveals\nongoing mid-infrared emission from nine of the SNe in this sample. We also\ndetect three of the SNe in archival WISE data, in addition to SNe 1987A,\n2004dj, and 2008iy. For at least five of the SNe in the sample, optical and/or\nX-ray emission confirms the presence of radiative emission from ongoing CSM\ninteraction. The two Spitzer nondetections are consistent with the forward\nshock overrunning and destroying the dust shell, a result that places upper\nlimits on the dust-shell size.

We use high-quality observations from CRISP at the SST to investigate\nsigns of these different kinetic modes in spicules on the disk. Earlier, rapid\nblue-shifted excursions (RBEs), short-lived absorption features in the blue\nwing of chromospheric spectral lines, were identified as the disk counterpart\nof type II spicules. Here we report the existence of similar absorption\nfeatures in the red wing of the Ca II 8542 and Halpha lines: rapid red-shifted\nexcursions (RREs). RREs are found over the whole solar disk and are located in\nthe same regions as RBEs: in the vicinity of magnetic field concentrations.\nRREs have similar characteristics as RBEs: they have similar lengths, widths,\nlifetimes, and average Doppler velocity. The striking similarity of RREs to\nRBEs implies that RREs are a manifestation of the same physical phenomenon and\nthat spicules harbour motions that can result in a net red-shift when observed\non-disk. We find that RREs are less abundant than RBEs and we interpret the\nhigher number of RBEs and the decreased imbalance towards the limb as an\nindication that field-aligned up-flows have a significant contribution to the\nnet Dopplershift. Most RREs and RBEs are observed in isolation but we find many\nexamples of parallel and touching RRE/RBE pairs which appear to be part of the\nsame spicule. We interpret the existence of these RRE/RBE pairs as signs that\ntorsional motion is an important characteristic of spicules. The fact that most\nRBEs and RREs are observed in isolation agrees with the idea that transversal\nswaying motion is another important kinetic mode. We find examples of\ntransitions from RRE to RBE and vice versa. \n\n"}

Alternatively, phase-dependent absorption has\nbeen used to reproduce the X-ray data. This paper presents new optical\npolarimetric data of CP Tuc and a model that consistently explains its optical\nand X-ray data. The model was based on an extension of the CYCLOPS code that\nadded X-ray bremsstrahlung emission and pre-shock region absorption to the\noriginal version, which only accounted for cyclotron emission. The new code\ncreates the possibility of simultaneous optical and X-ray fitting. We show that\nself-eclipse and absorption data have distinct signatures on the X-ray spectra.\nAlthough we were able to reasonably fit the CP Tuc optical data to cases of\nabsorption and self-eclipse, we were only able to reproduce the X-ray orbital\nmodulation after considering the absorption in the pre-shock region.\nSpecifically, we were unable to reproduce the X-ray observations in the\nself-eclipse case.

Most of superflare stars show quasi-periodic brightness modulations with\nthe typical period of one to a few tens of days.

These WD mass distributions are then\ncompared with the observed Galactic WD mass distribution and Monte Carlo\nsimulations of WD-WD binary populations. For collisions, we find that the\naverage mass of the individual components of the WD-WD binary must be peaked at\n~0.75Msun, significantly higher than the average WD mass in binaries or in the\nfield of ~0.55-0.60Msun. Thus, if collisions produce a large fraction of SNe\nIa, then a mechanism must exist that favors large mass WDs. On the other hand,\nin an old stellar population, collisions would naturally result in a class of\nlow luminosity SNe Ia, and we suggest these may be related to 1991bg-like\nevents.

In an alternative formation channel, NSs are\nproduced via the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a massive white dwarf (WD)\nin a close binary. Here we investigate binary evolution leading to AIC and\nexamine if NSs formed in this way can subsequently be recycled to form MSPs\nand, if so, how they can observationally be distinguished from pulsars formed\nvia the standard core-collapse SN channel in terms of their masses, spins,\norbital periods and space velocities. Numerical calculations with a detailed\nstellar evolution code were used for the first time to study the combined pre-\nand post-AIC evolution of close binaries. We investigated the mass transfer\nonto a massive WD in 240 systems with three different types of non-degenerate\ndonor stars: main-sequence stars, red giants, and helium stars. When the WD is\nable to accrete sufficient mass (depending on the mass-transfer rate and the\nduration of the accretion phase) we assumed it collapses to form a NS and we\nstudied the dynamical effects of this implosion on the binary orbit.\nSubsequently, we followed the mass-transfer epoch which resumes once the donor\nstar refills its Roche lobe and calculated the continued LMXB evolution until\nthe end. We demonstrate that the final properties of these MSPs are, in\ngeneral, remarkably similar to those of MSPs formed via the standard\ncore-collapse SN channel. However, the resultant MSPs created via the AIC\nchannel preferentially form in certain orbital period intervals. Finally, we\ndiscuss the link between AIC and young NSs in globular clusters.

For 4 sources infall takes place on core to envelope scales (i.e.\n~10000-3000 AU). In 2 sources the inverse P-Cygni profiles seen in the\nground-state lines are more likely due to larger-scale motions or foreground\nclouds.

We\nexplore the origin of such extreme solar activity fluctuations and the role of\ndual poloidal field sources, namely the Babcock-Leighton mechanism and the\nmean-field alpha effect in the dynamics of the solar cycle. We mainly\nconcentrate on entry and recovery from grand minima episodes such as the\nMaunder minimum and the dynamics of the solar cycle. We use a kinematic solar\ndynamo model with a novel set-up in which stochastic perturbations force two\ndistinct poloidal field alpha effects. We explore different regimes of\noperation of these poloidal sources with distinct operating thresholds, to\nidentify the importance of each. The perturbations are implemented\nindependently in both hemispheres which allows one to study the level of\nhemispheric coupling and hemispheric asymmetry in the emergence of sunspots.\nFrom the simulations performed we identify a few different ways in which the\ndynamo can enter a grand minima episode.

The peak\nluminosity and the duration of X-ray binary outbursts are related to the disc\nradius and, hence, the orbital period. At short periods, where the peak\noutburst luminosity drops close to the threshold for radiatively inefficient\naccretion, black hole LMXBs have lower outburst luminosities, shorter outburst\ndurations and lower X-ray duty cycles than comparable neutron star systems.\nThese factors can combine to severely reduce the detection probability of short\nperiod black hole LMXBs relative to those containing neutron stars.

Our XMM-Newton data of RS Cae are clearly dominated by soft X-ray\nemission.

In disk objects, in addition, we find signs of the on-\ngoing mass transfer to the companion, and an intriguing line splitting, which\nwe attribute to the scattered light of the primary. \n\n"}

In the jittering-jets model the explosion of CCSNe is powered by\njittering jets launched by an intermittent accretion disk formed by accreted\ngas having a stochastic angular momentum. The first two bipolar jets episodes\neject mass mainly from the plane defined by the two bipolar axes. Accretion\nthen proceeds from the two opposite directions normal to that plane. Such a\nflow has an angular momentum in the direction of the same plane. If the gas\nforms an accretion disk, the jets will be launched in more or less the same\nplane as the one defined by the jets of the first two launching episodes. The\noutflow from the core of the star might have a higher mass flux in the plane\ndefine by the jets.

In this paper, we use Adaptive Mesh\nRefinement (AMR) simulation methods, including sink particles, to simulate the\nfull collapse and subsequent evolution of a stable Bonnor-Ebert sphere\nsubjected to a shock and post-shock wind. We track the flow of the cloud\nmaterial after a star (a sink particle) has formed.

The most\ninteresting one is the so-called rho-state, whose light curve shows recurrent\nbursts. This paper presents a model based on Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations\ncontaining two variables: x, linked to the source photon luminosity L detected\nby the MECS, and y related to the mean photon energy. We aim at providing a\nsimple mathematical framework composed by non-linear differential equations\nuseful to predict the observed light curve and the energy lags for the\nrho-state and possibly other classes of the source. We studied the equilibrium\nstate and the stability conditions of this system that includes one external\nparameter, J, that can be considered a function of the disk accretion rate. Our\nwork is based on observations performed with the MECS on board BeppoSAX when\nthe source was in rho and nu mode, respectively. The evolution of the mean\ncount rate and photon energy were derived from a study of the trajectories in\nthe count rate - photon energy plane. Assuming J constant, we found a solution\nthat reproduces the x profile of the rho class bursts and, unexpectedly, we\nfound that y exhibited a time modulation similar to that of the mean energy.\nMoreover, assuming a slowly modulated J the solutions for x quite similar to\nthose observed in the nu class light curves is reproduced. According these\nresults, the outer mass accretion rate is probably responsible for the state\ntransitions, but within the rho-class it is constant. This finding makes\nstronger the heuristic meaning of the non-linear model and suggests a simple\nrelation between the variable x and y. However, how a system of dynamical\nequations can be derived from the complex mathematical apparatus of accretion\ndisks remains to be furtherly explored. \n\n"}

Secular interactions transfer\nangular momentum between inner and outer orbits unless their apsidal lines are\nparallel or anti-parallel. These choices correspond, respectively, to\northogonal eigenmodes p and a. Each is characterized by an eccentricity ratio\nset by the masses and semi-major axes, i.e., $e_{p, 1}/e_{p, 2}\\sim a_1/a_2$\nwhile $e_{a, 1}/e_{a, 2}\\sim (a_1/a_2)^{-3/2}(m_2/m_1)$. Mode p dominates the\nsystem's current state so $e_1/e_2$ always remains close to $e_{p, 1}/e_{p,\n2}$. A small contribution by Mode a causes $e_1$ and $e_2$ to oscillate with\nperiod $\\sim 10^3\\,\\yr$. Orbital changes should be apparent in a few years.\nThese will reveal the forcing of the apsidal precession of the inner orbit by\ngeneral relativity (GR), and possibly also the smaller contribution due to the\ntidal and rotational distortion of the inner white dwarf (WD). Phinney (1992)\nproposes that the epicyclic energy of a WD-pulsar binary reaches equipartition\nwith the kinetic energy of a single convective eddy when the WD's progenitor\nfills its Roche lobe. We extend Phinney's theory to apply to modes rather than\nindividual orbits. Thus we predict that Mode p and Mode a achieved\nequipartition with eddies in the giant envelopes of the progenitors of the\nouter and inner WD, respectively. The most effective eddies are those with\nlifetimes closest to the orbit period. These were more energetic in the\nprogenitor of the outer WD.

It has been\ncommon practice to assume that a given zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass star\n(and perhaps a given metallicity) simply produces either an NS or a BH, but\nthis fails to account for a myriad of other variables that may effect this\noutcome, such as spin, binarity, or even stochastic differences in the stellar\nstructure near core collapse. We argue that instead a probabilistic description\nof NS versus BH formation may be better suited to account for the current\nuncertainties in understanding how massive stars die. We present an initial\nexploration of the probability that a star will make a BH as a function of its\nZAMS mass, $P_{\\rm BH}(M_{\\rm ZAMS})$. Although we find that it is difficult to\nderive a unique $P_{\\rm BH}(M_{\\rm ZAMS})$ using current measurements of both\nthe BH mass distribution and the degree of chemical enrichment by massive\nstars, we demonstrate how $P_{\\rm BH}(M_{\\rm ZAMS})$ changes with these various\nobservational and theoretical uncertainties. We anticipate that future studies\nof Galactic BHs and theoretical studies of core collapse will refine $P_{\\rm\nBH}(M_{\\rm ZAMS})$ and argue that this framework is an important new step\ntoward better understanding BH formation. A probabilistic description of BH\nformation will be useful as input for future population synthesis studies that\nare interested in the formation of X-ray binaries, the nature and event rate of\ngravitational wave sources, and answering questions about chemical enrichment. \n\n"}

The effective temperature and surface\ngravity of 18 Sco are Teff = 5823+/-6 K and log g = 4.45+/-0.02 dex, i.e., 18\nSco is 46+/-6 K hotter than the Sun and log g is 0.01+/-0.02 dex higher. Its\nmetallicity is [Fe/H] = 0.054+/-0.005 dex and its microturbulence velocity is\n+0.02+/-0.01 km/s higher than solar.

Our best fit 44Ti mass is M(44Ti) = (0.55 +- 0.17) x 10^{-4}\nMsun, which is in disagreement with the much higher (3.1 +- 0.8) x 10^{-4} Msun\nrecently derived from INTEGRAL observations. The associated uncertainties far\nexceed the best fit values for 55Co and 60Co and, as a result, we only give\nupper limits on the production masses of M(55Co) < 7.2 x 10^{-3} Msun and\nM(60Co) < 1.7 x 10^{-4} Msun. Furthermore, we find that the leptonic channels\nin the decay of 57Co (internal conversion and Auger electrons) are a\nsignificant contribution and constitute up to 15.5% of the total luminosity.\nConsideration of the kinetic energy of these electrons is essential in lowering\nour best fit nickel isotope production ratio to [57Ni/56Ni]=2.5+-1.1, which is\nstill somewhat high but is in agreement with gamma-ray observations and model\npredictions. \n\n"}

All three\nnon-ideal MHD effects, Ohmic resistivity, the Hall effect and ambipolar\ndiffusion are included in a self-consistent manner based on equilibrium\nchemistry. We focus on regions toward outer disk radii, from 5-60AU, where\nOhmic resistivity tends to become negligible, ambipolar diffusion dominates\nover an extended region across disk height, and the Hall effect largely\ncontrols the dynamics near the disk midplane. We find that around R=5AU, the\nsystem launches a laminar/weakly turbulent magnetocentrifugal wind when the net\nvertical field Bz is not too weak, as expected. Moreover, the wind is able to\nachieve and maintain a configuration with reflection symmetry at disk midplane.\nThe case with anti-aligned field polarity (Omega. Bz<0) is more susceptible to\nthe MRI when Bz drops, leading to an outflow oscillating in radial directions\nand very inefficient angular momentum transport. At the outer disk around and\nbeyond R=30AU, the system shows vigorous MRI turbulence in the surface layer\ndue to far-UV ionization, which efficiently drives disk accretion. The Hall\neffect affects the stability of the midplane region to the MRI, leading to\nstrong/weak Maxwell stress for aligned/anti-aligned field polarities.\nNevertheless, the midplane region is only very weakly turbulent. Overall, the\nbasic picture is analogous to the conventional layered accretion scenario\napplied to the outer disk.

We propose that\nthis correlation is due to the absorption by circumstellar matter that comes\nfrom the evaporation of the planets. Planets with a lower gravity have a\ngreater mass-loss rate which leads to a higher column density of circumstellar\nabsorption and this in turn explains the lower level of chromospheric emission\nobserved in their host stars.

We show that at these stages\nirradiated models are in a Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) state or in a quasi-RLOF\nstate. Quasi-RLOF stars have a radius slightly smaller than its Roche lobe.\nRemarkably, these conditions are attained for orbital period and donor mass\nvalues in the range corresponding to a family of binary radio pulsars known as\n\"redbacks\".

Intermediate mass stars, although not destined to explode in\nsupernovae, display similar phenomena, are much more numerous, and have some of\nthe richest pulsation spectra. A key to understanding these stars is\nunderstanding the effects of rapid rotation on their structure and evolution.\nThese effects include centrifugal deformation and gravity darkening which can\nbe observed immediately, and long terms effects such as rotational mixing due\nto shear turbulence, which prolong stellar lifetime, modify chemical yields,\nand impact the stellar remnant at the end of their lifetime. In order to\nunderstand these effects, a number of models have been and are being developed\nover the past few years. These models lead to increasingly sophisticated\npredictions which need to be tested through observations. A particularly\npromising source of constraints is seismic observations as these may\npotentially lead to detailed information on their internal structure.

We compute Dopplergrams from the observed intensity profiles\nusing line bisectors and filter the resulting velocity maps for subsonic\noscillations. Lateral downflows appear everywhere in the center-side penumbra\nas small, weak patches of redshifts next to or along the edges of blueshifted\nflow channels. These patches have an intermittent life and undergo mergings and\nfragmentations quite frequently. The lateral downflows move together with the\nhosting filaments and react to their shape variations, very much resembling the\nevolution of granular convection in the quiet Sun. There is a good relation\nbetween brightness and velocity of the flow structures in the center-side\npenumbra, with downflows being darker than upflows on average, which is again\nreminiscent of quiet Sun convection.

We derive the equations that govern this problem in full\ndetail, paying particular attention to the input that needs to be provided\nthrough the equation of state and distinguishing between normal and superfluid\nregions. The analysis highlights a number of key issues that should be kept in\nmind whenever equation of state data is compiled from nuclear physics for use\nin neutron star calculations. We provide explicit results for a particular\nstellar model and a specific nucleonic equation of state, making use of cooling\nsimulations to show how the local wave spectrum evolves as the star ages. Our\nresults show that the composition gradient is effectively dominated by the\nmuons whenever they are present. When the star cools below the superfluid\ntransition, the support for g-modes at lower densities (where there are no\nmuons) is entirely thermal.

In Tauris et al. (2013), it was demonstrated that\nhelium star companions to neutron stars (NSs) may experience mass transfer and\nevolve into naked ~1.5 M_sun metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass\nlimit. Here we present a systematic investigation of the progenitor evolution\nleading to ultra-stripped supernovae (SNe). In particular, we examine the\nbinary parameter space leading to electron-capture (EC SNe) and iron\ncore-collapse SNe (Fe CCSNe), respectively, and determine the amount of helium\nejected with applications to their observational classification as Type Ib or\nType Ic. We mainly evolve systems where the SN progenitors are helium star\ndonors of initial mass M_He = 2.5 - 3.5 M_sun in tight binaries with orbital\nperiods of P_orb = 0.06 - 2.0 days, and hosting an accreting NS, but we also\ndiscuss the evolution of wider systems and of both more massive and lighter -\nas well as single - helium stars. In some cases we are able to follow the\nevolution until the onset of silicon burning, just a few days prior to the SN\nexplosion. We find that ultra-stripped SNe are possible for both EC SNe and Fe\nCCSNe, and that the amount of helium ejected is correlated with P_orb - the\ntightest systems even having donors being stripped down to envelopes of less\nthan 0.01 M_sun. We estimate the rise time of ultra-stripped SNe to be in the\nrange 12 hr - 8 days, and light curve decay times between 1 and 50 days.\nUltra-stripped SNe may produce NSs in the mass range 1.10 - 1.80 M_sun and are\nhighly relevant for LIGO/VIRGO since most (possibly all) merging double NS\nsystems have evolved through this phase. Finally, we discuss the low-velocity\nkicks which might be imparted on these resulting NSs at birth. [Abridged] \n\n"}

We demonstrate that\nthe underproduction of elements above and below the $r$-process peaks\ncharacteristic in the main or weak $r$-process events (like magnetohydrodynamic\njets or neutrino-driven winds in core-collapse supernovae) can be supplemented\nvia fission fragment distributions from the recycling of material in a\nneutron-rich environment such as that encountered in neutron star mergers.

In this manuscript, we assume that the shock revival is\ninitiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition\nfor spherically symmetric shock expansion, $v_s > 0$.

We show\nthat the mass of highly magnetized or modified Einstein's gravity induced white\ndwarfs could be significantly super-Chandrasekhar and such white dwarfs could\naltogether have a different mass-limit. On the other hand, type Ia supernovae\n(SNeIa), a key to unravel the evolutionary history of the universe, are\nbelieved to be triggered in white dwarfs having mass close to the\nChandrasekhar-limit. However, observations of several peculiar, over- and\nunder-luminous SNeIa argue for exploding masses widely different from this\nlimit. We argue that explosions of super-Chandrasekhar limiting mass white\ndwarfs result in over-luminous SNeIa.

These C-and-above flares are all\nassociated with a magnetic flux rope (MFR) located along the major polarity\ninversion line, where shearing and converging photospheric flows are present.\nAided by the nonlinear force-free field modeling, we identify the MFR through\nmapping magnetic connectivities and computing the twist number $\\mathcal{T}_w$\nfor each individual field line. The MFR is moderately twisted ($|\\mathcal{T}_w|\n< 2$) and has a well-defined boundary of high squashing factor $Q$. We found\nthat the field line with the extremum $|\\mathcal{T}_w|$ is a reliable proxy of\nthe rope axis, and that the MFR's peak $|\\mathcal{T}_w|$ temporarily increases\nwithin half an hour before each flare while it decreases after the flare peak\nfor both confined and eruptive flares. This pre-flare increase in\n$|\\mathcal{T}_w|$ has little effect on the active region's free magnetic energy\nor any other parameters derived for the whole region, due to its moderate\namount and the MFR's relatively small volume, while its decrease after flares\nis clearly associated with the stepwise decrease in free magnetic energy due to\nthe flare.

As part\nof our project to study the integral-shaped filament, we analyze the\nfragmentation properties of the northern OMC 1 filament. This filament is a\ndense structure previously identified by JCMT/SCUBA submillimeter continuum and\nVLA ammonia observations and shown to have fragmented into clumps. We observed\nOMC1 n with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 1.3mm and report on our analysis\nof the continuum data.

The masses of these sources are similar to those of the SMA\nprotostars in OMC3, but their typical sizes and densities are lower by a factor\nof ten. Only 8% of the new sources have infrared counterparts, yet there are\nfive associated CO molecular outflows. These sources are thus likely in the\nClass 0 evolutionary phase yet it cannot be excluded that some of the sources\nmight still be pre-stellar cores. The spatial analysis of the protostars shows\nthat these are divided into small groups that coincide with previously\nidentified JCMT/SCUBA 850 micron and VLA ammonia clumps, and that these are\nseparated by a quasi-equidistant length of ~30arcmin (0.06pc).

Aims: We address this question by\nimproving the interpolator of the MILES (Medium-resolution INT Library of\nEmpirical Spectra) library in the low effective temperature regime (Tefff <\n4800 K), and we refine the determination of the parameters of the cool MILES\nstars. Methods: We use the ULySS package to determine the atmospheric\nparameters (Teff, logg and [Fe/H]), and measure the biases of the results with\nrespect to our updated compilation of parameters calibrated against theoretical\nspectra.

Three main techniques can be\nused to achieve this goal. The first involves waveform modelling.

The enhanced ambipolar diffusion (AD) in the envelope reduces the\namount of magnetic flux dragged by the collapse into the circumstellar\ndisk-forming region. Therefore, magnetic braking is weakened and more angular\nmomentum can be retained. With continuous high angular momentum inflow, RSDs of\ntens of AU are able to form, survive, and even grow in size, depending on other\nparameters including cosmic-ray ionization rate, magnetic field strength, and\nrotation speed.

We used\ndata from Suzaku observations of the pulsar at two epochs i.e. on 2013 October\n22 (close to the peak of the outburst) and 2013 November 22. X-ray pulsations\nat $\\sim$18.81 s were clearly detected in the light curves obtained from both\nobservations. Pulse periods estimated during the outburst showed that the\npulsar was spinning up. The pulse profile was found to be single-peaked up to\n$\\sim$10 keV beyond which a sharp peak followed by a dip-like feature appeared\nat hard X-rays. The dip-like feature has been observed up to $\\sim$70 keV. The\n1-110 keV broad-band spectroscopy of both observations revealed that the\nbest-fit model comprised of a partially absorbed Negative and Positive power\nlaw with EXponential cutoff (NPEX) continuum model along with a blackbody\ncomponent for the soft X-ray excess and two Gaussian functions at 6.4 and 6.7\nkeV for emission lines. Both the lines were identified as emission from neutral\nand He-like iron atom. To fit the spectra, we included the previously reported\ncyclotron absorption line at 12.2 keV. From the spin-up rate, the magnetic\nfield of the pulsar was estimated to be $\\sim$1.2$\\times$10$^{12}$ G and found\nto be comparable to that obtained from the detection of the cyclotron\nabsorption feature. Pulse-phase resolved spectroscopy revealed the pulsating\nnature of the soft X-ray excess component in phase with the continuum flux.\nThis confirms that the accretion column and/or accretion stream are the most\nprobable regions of pulsar's soft X-ray excess emission. The presence of the\npulsating soft X-ray excess in phase with continuum emission may be the\npossible reason for not observing the dip at soft X-rays. \n\n"}

Accurate modelling of the blast wave evolution is therefore\nessential for ISM and galaxy formation simulations. We present an efficient\nmethod to compute the input of momentum, thermal energy, and the velocity\ndistribution of the shock-accelerated gas for ambient media with uniform (and\nwith stellar wind blown bubbles), power-law, and turbulent density\ndistributions. Assuming solar metallicity cooling, the blast wave evolution is\nfollowed to the beginning of the momentum conserving snowplough phase. The\nmodel recovers previous results for uniform ambient media. The momentum\ninjection in wind-blown bubbles depend on the swept-up mass and the efficiency\nof cooling, when the blast wave hits the wind shell. For power-law density\ndistributions with $n(r) \\sim$ $r^{-2}$ (for $n(r) > n_{_{\\rm floor}}$) the\namount of momentum injection is solely regulated by the background density\n$n_{_{\\rm floor}}$ and compares to $n_{_{\\rm uni}}$ = $n_{_{\\rm floor}}$.\nHowever, in turbulent ambient media with log-normal density distributions the\nmomentum input can increase by a factor of 2 (compared to the homogeneous case)\nfor high Mach numbers.

Previously, we showed that for binary mass ratios 0.06 < q < 0.8,\nsynchronous L2 mass loss results in a radiatively inefficient, dust-forming\nunbound equatorial outflow. A similar outflow exists irrespective of q if the\nratio of the sound speed to the orbital speed at the injection point is\nsufficiently large, \\epsilon = c_T/v_orb > 0.15. By contrast, for cold L2\nmass-loss (\\epsilon < 0.15) from binaries with q < 0.06 or q > 0.8, the\nequatorial outflow instead remains marginally-bound and falls back to the\nbinary over tens to hundreds of binary orbits, where it experiences additional\ntidal torqueing and shocking. As the bound gas becomes virialized with the\nbinary, the luminosity of the system increases slowly at approximately constant\nphotosphere radius, causing the temperature to rise. Subsequent evolution\ndepends on the efficiency of radiative cooling. If the bound atmosphere is able\nto cool efficiently, as quantified by radiative diffusion time being shorter\nthan the advection time (t_diff/t_adv < 1), then the virialized gas collapses\nto an excretion disk, while for t_diff/t_adv > 1 an isotropic wind is formed.\nBetween these two extremes, an inflated envelope transports the heat generated\nnear the binary to the surface by meridional flows.

This\nfriction acts both on the equilibrium/non-wave like tide and on tidal inertial\nwaves in these layers. It is thus necessary to obtain a robust prescription for\nthis friction. In the current state-of-the-art, it is modeled by a turbulent\neddy-viscosity coefficient, based on mixing-length theory, applied on\nvelocities of tides. However, none of the current prescriptions take into\naccount the action of rotation that can strongly affects turbulent convection.\nTherefore, we use theoretical scaling laws for convective velocities and\ncharacteristic lengthscales in rotating stars and planets that have been\nrecently confirmed by 3-D high-resolution nonlinear Cartesian numerical\nsimulations to derive a new prescription. A corresponding local model of tidal\nwaves is used to understand the consequences for the linear tidal dissipation.\nFinally, new grids of rotating stellar models and published values of planetary\nconvective Rossby numbers are used to discuss astrophysical consequences. The\naction of rotation on convection deeply modifies the turbulent friction applied\non tides. In the regime of rapid rotation (with a convective Rossby number\nbelow 0.25), the eddy-viscosity may be decreased by several ordres of\nmagnitude. It may lead to a loss of efficiency of the viscous dissipation of\nthe equilibrium tide and to a more efficient complex and resonant dissipation\nof tidal inertial waves in the bulk of convective regions. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to have a completely coupled treatment of the tidal/rotational\nevolution of star-planet systems and multiple stars with a coherent treatment\nof the variations of tidal flows and of their dissipation as a function of\nrotation. \n\n"}

Historical UV observations have ruled out orbital variability as an\nexplanation for flickering and instead suggest flickering is caused by variable\nmass transfer. We have analysed optical and X-ray observations to investigate\nthe nature of the flickering as well as the active phases in T CrB. The\nspectroscopic and photometric observations confirm that the active phases\nfollow two periods of ~1000d and ~5000d.

Including the\nmagnetic braking caused by the coupling between the magnetic field and an\nirradiation-driven wind induced by the X-ray flux from the accreting component,\nwe show that intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) can evolve into UCXBs.\nUsing the \\emph{MESA} code, we have calculated evolutionary sequences for a\nlarge number of IMXBs.

We describe each outcome as a series of discrete\ntransformations in energy space, using the diagrams first presented in Leigh \\&\nGeller (2012; see the Appendix). Furthermore, we develop a formalism for\ncalculating probabilities for these outcomes to occur, expressed using the\ndensity of escape configurations per unit energy, and based on the Monaghan\ndescription originally developed for the three-body problem. We compare this\nanalytic formalism to results from a series of binary-binary encounters with\nidentical point particles, simulated using the \\texttt{FEWBODY} code. Each of\nour three encounter outcomes produces a unique velocity distribution for the\nescaping star(s). Thus, these distributions can potentially be used to\nconstrain the origins of dynamically-formed populations, via a direct\ncomparison between the predicted and observed velocity distributions. Finally,\nwe show that, for encounters that form stable triples, the simulated single\nstar escape velocity distributions are the same as for the three-body problem.\nThis is also the case for the other two encounter outcomes, but only at low\nvirial ratios. This suggests that single and binary stars processed via\nsingle-binary and binary-binary encounters in dense star clusters should have a\nunique velocity distribution relative to the underlying Maxwellian distribution\n(provided the relaxation time is sufficiently long), which can be calculated\nanalytically. \n\n"}

Motivated by the evidence for powerful\nradiative shocks within nova outflows, we propose that dust formation occurs\nwithin the cool, dense shell behind these shocks.

In disks, the ratios of volatile elements, such as C/O and\nN/O, are regulated by the abundance of the main C, N, O carriers, their ice\nbinding environment, and the presence of snowlines of major volatiles at\ndifferent distances from the central star. We explore the effects of disk\ndynamical processes, molecular compositions and abundances, and ice\ncompositions on the snowline locations of the main C, O and N carriers, and the\nC/N/O ratios in gas and dust throughout the disk. The gas-phase N/O ratio\nenhancement in the outer disk (exterior to the H2O snowline) exceeds the C/O\nratio enhancement for all reasonable volatile compositions. Ice compositions\nand disk dynamics individually change the snowline location of N2, the main\nnitrogen carrier, by a factor of 2-3, and when considered together the range of\npossible N2 snowline locations is ~11- ~79 AU in a standard disk model.\nObservations that anchor snowline locations at different stages of planet\nformation are therefore key to develop C/N/O ratios as a probe of planet\nformation zones. \n\n"}

The details of the C/O core structure in white dwarf stars has\nmostly remained inaccessible to the technique of asteroseismology, despite\nseveral attempts carried out in the past.\n  Aims. We re-assess the potential of asteroseismology for probing the chemical\nstratification in white dwarf cores, in light of new highly efficient tools\nrecently developed for that purpose.\n  Methods. Using the forward modeling approach and a new parameterization for\nthe core chemical stratification in ZZ Ceti stars, we test several situations\ntypical of the usually limited constraints available, such as small numbers of\nobserved independent modes, to carry out asteroseismology of these stars.\n  Results. We find that, even with a limited number of modes, the core chemical\nstratification (in particular, the location of the steep chemical transitions\nexpected in the oxygen profile) can be determined quite precisely due to the\nsignificant sensitivity of some confined modes to partial reflexion (trapping)\neffects. These effects are similar to the well known trapping induced by the\nshallower chemical transitions at the edge of the core and at the bottom of the\nH-rich envelope. We also find that success to unravel the core structure\ndepends on the information content of the available seismic data.

Three scenarios for mass accretion from the disk onto\nthe star were considered: hybrid accretion in which a fraction of accreted\nenergy absorbed by the protostar depends on the accretion rate, hot accretion\nwherein a fraction of accreted energy is constant, and cold accretion wherein\nall accretion energy is radiated away. Our conclusions on the nature of VeLLOs\ndepend crucially on the character of protostellar accretion. In the hybrid\naccretion scenario, most VeLLOs (90.6%) are expected to be the first\nhydrostatic cores (FHSCs) and only a small fraction (9.4%) are true protostars.\nIn the hot accretion scenario, all VeLLOs are FHSCs due to overly high\nphotospheric luminosity of protostars. In the cold accretion scenario, on the\ncontrary, the majority of VeLLOs belong to the Class I phase of stellar\nevolution.

Tycho's SNR\nis a particularly good target because it is a young, type Ia SNR that is\nwell-studied over a wide range of energies and located in a relatively clean\nenvironment. Since the detection of gamma-ray emission from Tycho's SNR by\nVERITAS and Fermi-LAT, there have been several theoretical models proposed to\nexplain its broadband emission and high-energy morphology. We report on an\nupdate to the gamma-ray measurements of Tycho's SNR with 147 hours of VERITAS\nand 84 months of Fermi-LAT observations, which represents about a factor of two\nincrease in exposure over previously published data. About half of the VERITAS\ndata benefited from a camera upgrade, which has made it possible to extend the\nTeV measurements toward lower energies. The TeV spectral index measured by\nVERITAS is consistent with previous results, but the expanded energy range\nsoftens a straight power-law fit. At energies higher than 400 GeV, the\npower-law index is $2.92 \\pm 0.42_{\\mathrm{stat}} \\pm 0.20_{\\mathrm{sys}}$. It\nis also softer than the spectral index in the GeV energy range, $2.14 \\pm\n0.09_{\\mathrm{stat}} \\pm 0.02_{\\mathrm{sys}}$, measured by this study using\nFermi--LAT data. The centroid position of the gamma-ray emission is coincident\nwith the center of the remnant, as well as with the centroid measurement of\nFermi--LAT above 1 GeV. The results are consistent with an SNR shell origin of\nthe emission, as many models assume. The updated spectrum points to a lower\nmaximum particle energy than has been suggested previously. \n\n"}

On the other hand, in the LMC the highest incidence rate is 5 per cent\nfor pulsation periods between 8 and 14d, and the overall amplitude of the\neffect is smaller. It indicates that the phenomenon is metallicity dependent.\nTypical modulation periods are between 70 and 300d.

Sub-subgiants, and\nthe possibly related red stragglers (which fall to the red of the giant\nbranch), occupy a region of the color-magnitude diagram that is predicted to be\ndevoid of stars by standard stellar evolution theory. In previous papers we\npresented the observed demographics of these sources and defined possible\ntheoretical formation channels through isolated binary evolution, the rapid\nstripping of a subgiant's envelope, and stellar collisions. Sub-subgiants offer\nkey tests for single- and binary-star evolution and stellar collision models.\nIn this paper, we synthesize these findings to discuss the formation\nfrequencies through each of these channels. The empirical data, our analytic\nformation rate calculations, and analyses of sub-subgiants in a large grid of\nMonte Carlo globular cluster models suggest that the binary evolution channels\nmay be the most prevalent, though all channels appear to be viable routes to\nsub-subgiant creation (especially in higher-mass globular clusters).

We consider the cases of an extended static atmosphere or a\nsteady-state wind, adopting a range of mass loss rates. The shock-breakout\nsignal, the SN radiation up to 10d, and the ejecta dynamics are strongly\ninfluenced by the properties of this nearby environment. This compromises the\nuse of early-time observations to constrain Rstar. The presence of narrow lines\nfor 2-3d in 2013fs and 2013cu require a cocoon of material of ~0.01Msun out to\n5-10Rstar.

Recent studies propose a\nsuper-wind phase with a mass loss rate from 0.001 up to 1Msun/yr in the last\nmonths/years of the RSG life, although there is no observational constraint\nthat this external material is a steady-state outflow. Alternatively,\nobservations may be explained by the explosion of a RSG star inside its complex\natmosphere. Indeed, spatially resolved observations reveal that RSG stars have\nextended atmospheres, with the presence of downflows and upflows out to several\nRstar, even in a standard RSG like Betelgeuse.

A pure\ndeflagration of a centrally-ignited, low central density ($\\simeq$\n2$\\times$10$^{9}$ g cm$^{-3}$) progenitor white dwarf, frequently considered in\nthe literature, is also found to produce good agreement with 3C 397\nnucleosynthetic yields, but leads to a subluminous SN Ia event, in conflict\nwith X-ray linewidth data. Additionally, in contrast to prior work which\nsuggested a large super-solar metallicity for the white dwarf progenitor for\nSNR 3C 397, we find satisfactory agreement for solar and sub-solar metallicity\nprogenitors. We discuss a range of implications our results have for the\nsingle-degenerate channel. \n\n"}

As this object sweeps through material with a\nsteep radial gradient of density, net angular momentum is introduced into the\nflow, potentially leading to the formation of an accretion disk. The presence\nof a disk would have dramatic consequences for the outcome of the interaction\nbecause accretion might be accompanied by strong, polar outflows with enough\nenergy to unbind the entire envelope. Without a detailed understanding of the\nnecessary conditions for disk formation during common envelope, therefore, it\nis difficult to accurately predict the population of merging compact binaries.\nThis paper examines the conditions for disk formation around objects embedded\nwithin common envelopes using the `wind tunnel' formalism developed by MacLeod\net al. (2017). We find that the formation of disks is highly dependent on the\ncompressibility of the envelope material. Disks form only in the most\ncompressible of stellar envelope gas, found in envelopes' outer layers in zones\nof partial ionization. These zones are largest in low-mass stellar envelopes,\nbut comprise small portions of the envelope mass and radius in all cases. We\nconclude that disk formation and associated accretion feedback in common\nenvelope is rare, and if it occurs, transitory. The implication for LIGO black\nhole binary assembly is that by avoiding strong accretion feedback, common\nenvelope interactions should still result in the substantial orbital tightening\nneeded to produce merging binaries. \n\n"}

Classical Be stars are main-sequence\nobjects of mainly B-type, whose spectra show, or had shown at some epoch,\nBalmer lines in emission and an infrared excess.

Thus, we derive conservative (i.e., B/C-driven) and\nspeculative (antiproton/proton-driven) upper limits to the SNR flux\ncontributions for the d and He spectra spectra in CRs, along with their\nstandard secondary component expected from CR collisions in the interstellar\ngas. We find that the source component of antinuclei can be appreciable at\nkinetic energies above a few ~10 GeV/n, but it is always sub-dominant below a\nfew GeV/n, that is the energy window where dark matter (DM) annihilation\nsignatures are expected to exceed the level of secondary production. We also\nfind that the total (standard + SNR) flux of secondary antinuclei is tightly\nbounded by the data. Thus the presence of interaction processes inside SNRs\ndoes not critically affect the total background for DM searches. \n\n"}

It has been suggested recently that a\nHe-rich WD (a He WD or a hybrid HeCO WD) merges with a CO WD may produce an SN\nIa. This theory was based on the double-detonation model, in which the shock\ncompression in the CO core caused by the surface explosion of the He-rich shell\nmight lead to the explosion of the whole CO WD. However, so far, very few\nbinary population synthesis (BPS) studies have been made on the merger scenario\nof a CO WD and a He-rich WD in the context of SNe Ia. Aims: We aim to\nsystematically study the Galactic birthrates and delay-time distributions of\nSNe Ia based on the merger scenario of a CO WD and a He-rich WD. Methods: We\nperformed a series of Monte Carlo BPS simulations to investigate the properties\nof SNe Ia from the merging of a CO WD and a He-rich WD based on the Hurley\nrapid binary evolution code. We also considered the influence of different\nmetallicities on the final results. Results: From our simulations, we found\nthat no more than 15% of all SNe Ia stem from the merger scenario of a CO WD\nand a He-rich WD, and their delay times range from ~110 Myr to the Hubble time.\nThis scenario mainly contributes to SN Ia explosions with intermediate and long\ndelay times. The present work indicates that the merger scenario of a CO WD and\na He-rich WD can roughly reproduce the birthrates of SN 1991bg-like events, and\ncover the range of their delay times. We also found that SN Ia birthrates from\nthis scenario would be higher for the cases with low metallicities. \n\n"}

We use a set of\nhydrodynamic simulations to determine the structure of discs forming in\ncollapsing molecular clouds. We examine how radiative feedback from the host\nprotostar affects the disc properties by examining three regimes: without\nradiative feedback, with continuous radiative feedback and with episodic\nfeedback, similar to FU Ori-type outbursts. We find that the radial surface\ndensity and temperature profiles vary significantly as the disc accretes gas\nfrom the infalling envelope. These profiles are sensitive to the presence of\nspiral structure, induced by gravitational instabilities, and the radiative\nfeedback provided by the protostar, especially in the case when the feedback is\nepisodic. We also investigate whether mass estimates from position-velocity\n(PV) diagrams are accurate for early-phase discs. We find that the protostellar\nsystem mass (i.e. the mass of the protostar and its disc) is underestimated by\nup to 20%, due to the impact of an enhanced radial pressure gradient on the\ngas. The mass of early-phase discs is a significant fraction of the mass of the\nprotostar, so position-velocity diagrams cannot accurately provide the mass of\nthe protostar alone.

We report the small temporal variation of the axial dipole moment near\nthe solar minimum and its application to the solar cycle prediction by the\nsurface flux transport (SFT) model. Methods. We measure the axial dipole moment\nusing the photospheric synoptic magnetogram observed by the Wilcox Solar\nObservatory (WSO), the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Michelson\nDoppler Imager (MDI), and the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager (HMI). We also use the surface flux transport model for the\ninterpretation and prediction of the observed axial dipole moment. Results. We\nfind that the observed axial dipole moment becomes approximately constant\nduring the period of several years before each cycle minimum, which we call the\naxial dipole moment plateau. The cross-equatorial magnetic flux transport is\nfound to be small during the period, although the significant number of\nsunspots are still emerging. The results indicates that the newly emerged\nmagnetic flux does not contributes to the build up of the axial dipole moment\nnear the end of each cycle. This is confirmed by showing that the time\nvariation of the observed axial dipole moment agrees well with that predicted\nby the SFT model without introducing new emergence of magnetic flux. These\nresults allows us to predict the axial dipole moment in Cycle 24/25 minimum\nusing the SFT model without introducing new flux emergence. The predicted axial\ndipole moment of Cycle 24/25 minimum is 60--80 percent of Cycle 23/24 minimum,\nwhich suggests the amplitude of Cycle 25 even weaker than the current Cycle 24.\nConclusions. The plateau of the solar axial dipole moment is an important\nfeature for the longer prediction of the solar cycle based on the SFT model. \n\n"}

The small-scale\nmagnetic fields can reduce the convective amplitude of small-scale motions\nthrough the Lorentz-force feedback, which concurrently inhibits the turbulent\nmixing of entropy between upflows and downflows.

Results. We investigate\nwhich spectral features of Ca II K contribute to the frequency-integrated Ca II\nK brightness, which we use as a tracer of chromospheric radiative losses. The\nmajority of the radiative losses are not associated with localized high-Ca II\nK-brightness events, but instead with a more gentle, spatially extended, and\npersistent heating. The frequency-integrated Ca II K brightness correlates\nstrongly with the total linear polarization in the Ca II 854.2 nm line, while\nthe Ca II K profile shapes indicate that the bulk of the radiative losses occur\nin the lower chromosphere.\n  Non-LTE inversions indicate a transition from heating concentrated around\nphotospheric magnetic elements below $\\log{\\tau_{500}} =-3$ to a more\nspace-filling and time-persistent heating above $\\log{\\tau_{500}} =-4$.

Here we report on the analysis conducted to\nspecifically search for gravitational-wave bursts from cosmic string loops in\nthe data of Advanced LIGO 2015-2016 observing run (O1).

Just before the explosion\nthe magnitude M_V ranges between 9 and 11 mag, while the colour (F225W-F555W)\nis about -1.64 mag. The photometric properties remain constant for a few\ndecades before the explosion. During the last few months the luminosity\ndecreases very rapidly. The corresponding decline in the optical bands varies\nfrom few hundredths up to one magnitude, the exact value depending on both the\nWD total mass and the braking efficiency at the end of the mass transfer.

This has been attributed to dust formation in\nthe dense circumstellar medium. We modeled the intrinsic light curves in six\noptical bands, adopting a theoretical model for the luminosity evolution of\nsupernovae interacting with their circumstellar material. From the difference\nbetween the observed and intrinsic light curves, we calculated extinction\ncurves as a function of time. The total-to-selective extinction ratio, $R_V$,\nwas determined from the extinction in the B and V bands. The resulting\nextinction, $A_V$, increases monotonically up to about 1 mag, 150 days after\ndiscovery. The inferred $R_V$ value also increases slightly with time, but\nappears constant in the range 4.5--8, beyond 100 days after discovery.

To this end,\nwe modify the de-wiggled BAO model with an additional parameter to describe\nboth the BAO peak and the underlying exclusion pattern of void 2PCFs. We show\nthat after applying BAO reconstruction to galaxies, the BAO peak scale of both\ngalaxies and voids are unbiased using the modified model. Furthermore, we use a\nnew 2PCF estimator for a multi-tracer analysis with galaxies and voids. In\nsimulations, the joint sample improves by about 10% the constraint for the\npost-reconstruction BAO peak position compared to the result from galaxies\nalone, which is equivalent to an enlargement of the survey volume by 20%.\nApplying this method to the BOSS DR12 data, we have an 18% improvement for the\nlow-z sample (0.2<z<0.5), but a worse constraint for the high-z sample\n(0.5<z<0.75), which is consistent with statistical fluctuations for the current\nsurvey volume.

Although stable mass transfer predicts the formation of\nELM WDs with thick hydrogen (H) envelopes, and hence characterized by dominant\nresidual nuclear burning along the cooling branch, the formation of ELM WDs\nwith thinner H envelopes from unstable mass loss cannot be discarded. We\ncompute new evolutionary sequences for helium (He) core WD stars with thin H\nenvelope with the main aim of assessing the lowest $T_{\\rm eff}$ that could be\nreached by this type of stars. We generate a new grid of evolutionary sequences\nof He core WD stars with thin H envelope in the mass range from $0.1554$ to\n$0.2025 M_{\\odot}$, and assess the changes in both the cooling times and\nsurface gravity induced by a reduction of the H envelope. We also determine,\ntaking into account the predictions of progenitor evolution, the lowest $T_{\\rm\neff}$ reached by the resulting ELM WDs. We find that a slight reduction in the\nH envelope yields a significant increase in the cooling rate of ELM WDs.\nBecause of this, ELM WDs with thin H envelope could cool down to $\\sim 2500\\\n$K, in contrast with their canonical counterparts that cool down to $\\sim 7000\\\n$K. In addition, we find that a reduction of the thickness of the H envelope\nincreases markedly the surface gravity ($g$) of these stars. If ELM WDs are\nformed with thin H envelopes, they could be detected at very low $T_{\\rm eff}$.\nThe detection of such cool ELM WDs would be indicative that they were formed\nwith thin H envelopes, thus opening the possibility of placing constraints to\nthe possible mechanisms of formation of this type of stars. Last but not least,\nthe increase in $g$ due to the reduction of the H envelope leads to\nconsequences in the spectroscopic determinations of these stars. \n\n"}

This polarization feature is\ngenerally believed to be due to an inner aspherical core revealed in the late\nphase, while this polarization feature can also be contributed by the effect of\npolarized-scattered echoes by circumstellar (CS) dust around the SN. In this\npaper, we propose a unique method to distinguish polarization from the SN\nejecta and from the light echo. We quantitatively examine wavelength dependence\nof the polarization created by the scattered echoes for various geometries and\namounts of CS dust. It is found that the polarization in the $U$-band has\ncharacteristic features, i.e., the polarization emerges at an earlier phase\nwith higher polarization degree than that in longer wavelengths. These are due\nto the rapid evolution of the $U$-band light curve as well as higher optical\ndepth of dust in shorter wavelengths. Except for the $U$ band, the polarization\nincreases after the plateau phase, and the polarization degree is generally\nhigher for shorter wavelengths. These polarimetric features can be easily\ndistinguished from the polarization expected from an aspherical core, which\npredicts almost no wavelength dependence. Moreover, we show that multi-band\npolarimetric observations for SNe IIP can constrain a parameter space in the CS\ndust mass and distance from the SNe. We thus encourage multi-band polarimetric\nobservations for SNe IIP. \n\n"}

They contain crucial information on the early evolution of CMEs low\nin the corona. For 62 dimming events, characteristic parameters are derived,\nstatistically analyzed and compared with basic flare quantities. On average,\ncoronal dimmings have a size of $2.15\\times10^{10}$ km$^{2}$, contain a total\nunsigned magnetic flux of $1.75\\times10^{21}$ Mx, and show a total brightness\ndecrease of $-1.91\\times10^{6}$ DN, which results in a relative decrease of\n$\\sim$60% compared to the pre-eruption intensity level. Their main evacuation\nphase lasts for $\\sim$50 minutes. The dimming area, the total dimming\nbrightness, and the total unsigned magnetic flux show the highest correlation\nwith the flare SXR fluence ($c\\gtrsim0.7$). Their corresponding time\nderivatives, describing the dimming dynamics, strongly correlate with the GOES\nflare class ($c\\gtrsim 0.6$).

Secondary dimmings\nmap overlying fields that are stretched during the eruption and closed down by\nmagnetic reconnection, thus adding flux to the erupting flux rope via magnetic\nreconnection. This interpretation is supported by the strong correlation\nbetween the magnetic fluxes of secondary dimmings and flare reconnection fluxes\n($c=0.63\\pm0.08$), the balance between positive and negative magnetic fluxes\n($c=0.83\\pm0.04$) within the total dimmings and the fact that for strong flares\n($>$M1.0) the reconnection and secondary dimming fluxes are roughly equal. \n\n"}

We find that clumping boosts the recombination rate in the\nphotospheric layers, leading to a faster recession of the photosphere, an\nincrease in bolometric luminosity, and a reddening of the SN colors through\nenhanced blanketing. The SN bolometric light curve peaks earlier and\ntransitions faster to the nebular phase. On the rise to maximum, the strongest\nluminosity contrast between our clumped and smooth models is obtained at the\nepoch when the photosphere has receded to ejecta layers where the clumping\nfactor is only 0.5 -- this clumping factor may be larger in Nature. Clumping is\nseen to have a similar influence in a Type II-Plateau SN model. As we neglect\nboth porosity and chemical segregation our models underestimate the true impact\nof clumping. These results warrant further study of the influence of clumping\non the observables of other SN types during the photospheric phase. \n\n"}

Post-red supergiants that evolve back to the blue,\nhot side of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram can intersect a temperature domain\nin which their atmospheres become unstable against pulsations (the Yellow Void\nor Yellow Wall), and the stars can experience outbursts with short, but violent\nmass eruptions. The yellow hypergiant Rho Cas is famous for its historical and\nrecent outbursts, during which the star develops a cool, optically thick wind\nwith a very brief but high mass-loss rate, causing a sudden drop in the light\ncurve. Here we report on a new outburst of Rho Cas which occurred in 2013,\naccompanied by a temperature decrease of ~3000 K and a brightness drop of 0.6\nmag. During the outburst TiO bands appear, together with many low excitation\nmetallic atmospheric lines characteristic for a later spectral type. With this\nnew outburst, it appears that the time interval between individual events\ndecreases, which might indicate that Rho Cas is preparing for a major eruption\nthat could help the star to pass through the Yellow Void. We also analysed the\nemission features that appear during phases of maximum brightness and find that\nthey vary synchronous with the emission in the prominent [CaII] lines. We\nconclude that the occasionally detected emission in the spectra of Rho Cas, as\nwell as certain asymmetries seen in the absorption lines of low to\nmedium-excitation potential, are circumstellar in nature, and we discuss the\npossible origin of this material. \n\n"}

This study presents non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent radiative transfer simulations of\nvarious single carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet star explosions influenced by magnetars\nof diverse properties and covering from a few days to one or two years after\nexplosion. Nonthermal processes are treated; the magnetar-power deposition\nprofile is prescribed; dynamical effects are ignored. In this context, the main\ninfluence of the magnetar power is to boost the internal energy of the ejecta\non week-long time scales, enhancing the ejecta temperature and ionization,\nshifting the spectral energy distribution to the near-UV (even for the adopted\nsolar metallicity), creating blue optical colors. Varying the ejecta and\nmagnetar properties introduces various stretches and shifts to the light curve\n(rise time, peak or nebular luminosity, light curve width). At maximum, all\nmodels show the presence of OII and CII lines in the optical, and more rarely\nOIII and CIII lines. Non-thermal effects are found to be negligible during the\nhigh-brightness phase. After maximum, higher energy explosions are hotter and\nmore ionized, and produce spectra that are optically bluer. Clumping is a\nsource of spectral diversity after maximum. Clumping is essential to trigger\nejecta recombination and yield the presence of OI, CaII, and FeII lines from a\nfew weeks after maximum until nebular times. The UV and optical spectrum of\nGaia16apd at maximum or the nebular spectrum of LSQ14an at +410d are compatible\nwith some models that assume no clumping.

Combining this information with transit data furthermore yields the\ncorresponding parameters for their exoplanets. While [Fe/H] and Teff are\ncommonly stated to a precision of ~0.1 dex and ~100 K, the impact of errors in\ntheir measurement has not been studied in practice within the context of the\nparameters derived from them. Here we use the Stellar Parameters in an Instant\n(SPI) pipeline to estimate the parameters of nearly 100 stars observed by\nKepler and Gaia, many of which are confirmed planet hosts.

Here\nwe derive analytical solutions to the overshoot of the mid-transit depth caused\nby stellar limb darkening compared to the (R_p/R_s)^2 estimate for arbitrary\ntransit impact parameters. In turn, this allows us to compute the true\nplanet-to-star radius ratio from the transit depth for a given parameterization\nof a limb darkening law and for a known transit impact parameter.

Abstract: The cold dark matter paradigm has been extremely successful for explaining a\nwide range of cosmological phenomena. Nevertheless, since evidence for\nnon-baryonic dark matter remains indirect, all reasonable alternatives should\nbe explored. One proposed idea, involving a fundamental acceleration scale a_0\n= 1-2e-10 m/s^2, is called MOdified Newtonian Dynamics or MOND. MOND was\nsuggested to explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies without the need for\ndark matter. Whether or not it can adequately fit the available data has been\ndebated for almost 20 years (and we summarise many of these studies), but only\nrecently have there been attempts to extend MOND to larger scale regimes. We\ndiscuss how the basic properties of MOND make it at best ambiguous to apply\nthese ideas to cosmological scales. We emphasize the difficulties inherent in\ndeveloping a full theory in which to embed MOND. Without such a theory there is\nno obviously consistent way to discuss the early Universe and the growth of\nperturbations. Recent claims that MONDian cosmology works very well are\ntherefore not supportable. We also provide an argument for why a_0~cH_0\nnaturally, a coincidence which is often suggested as a motivation for taking\nMOND seriously. We discuss other alternative theories of gravity concluding, as\nothers have, that no metric theory extensions appear workable for explaining\nrotation curves as well as other observed phenomena. The whole premise of many\nof these attempts is fatally flawed - galaxies are not pre-selected, discrete,\nisolated regions which formed monolithically and around which one can construct\nan axially-symmetric dynamical model in order to remove the need for dark\nmatter. In the modern view, galaxies are part of a dynamic continuum of objects\nwhich collectively make up the evolving large-scale structure of the universe. \n\n"}

Compared to\nglobular clusters (GCs), these star clusters have moderately low luminosities\n(M_V > -8) and a broad distribution of sizes (3 < r_h < 30 pc), but they are\nprincipally characterized by their low mean surface brightnesses which can be\nmore than three magnitudes fainter than a typical GC (mu_g > 20 mag arcsec^-2).\nThe median colors of diffuse star cluster systems are red, 1.1 < g-z < 1.6,\nwhich is redder than metal-rich GCs and often as red as the galaxy itself. Most\nDSC systems thus have mean ages older than 5 Gyr or else have super-solar\nmetallicities.

We find that the fraction of galaxies on the red sequence depends\nstrongly on local environment out to z > 1, being larger in regions of greater\ngalaxy density. At all epochs probed, we also find a small population of red,\nmorphologically early-type galaxies residing in regions of low measured\noverdensity. The observed correlations between the red fraction and local\noverdensity are highly significant, with the trend at z > 1 detected at a\ngreater than 5-\\sigma level. Over the entire redshift regime studied, we find\nthat the color-density relation evolves continuously, with red galaxies more\nstrongly favoring overdense regions at low z relative to their red-sequence\ncounterparts at high redshift. At z ~ 1.3, the red fraction only weakly\ncorrelates with overdensity, implying that any color dependence to the\nclustering of ~ L* galaxies at that epoch must be small. Our findings add\nweight to existing evidence that the build-up of galaxies on the red sequence\nhas occurred preferentially in overdense environments (i.e., galaxy groups) at\nz < 1.5.

The kHz QPO peak separation varies over a wide range,\n\\~175-340 Hz, and increases with QPO frequency. This is contrary to what is\nseen in other sources but agrees with predictions of the relativistic\nprecession model and Alfven wave models; beat-frequency models require\nmodification to accommodate this.

We demonstrate that the simulations\npredict the existence of a BH 'fundamental plane' (BHFP), of the form M_BH\nsigma^(3.0+-0.3)*R_e^(0.43+-0.19) or M_BH\nM_bulge^(0.54+-0.17)*sigma^(2.2+-0.5), similar to relations found\nobservationally. The simulations indicate that the BHFP can be understood\nroughly as a tilted intrinsic correlation between BH mass and spheroid binding\nenergy, or the condition for feedback coupling to power a pressure-driven\noutflow. While changes in halo circular velocity, merger orbital parameters,\nprogenitor disk redshifts and gas fractions, ISM gas pressurization, and other\nparameters can drive changes in e.g. sigma at fixed M_bulge, and therefore\nchanges in the M_BH-sigma or M_BH-M_bulge relations, the BHFP is robust.

This evolution in the structural properties of merger\nremnants, to smaller R_e and larger sigma (and therefore larger M_BH,\nconserving the BHFP) at a given M_bulge, is driven by the fact that bulge\nprogenitors have characteristically larger gas fractions at high redshifts.\nAdopting the observed evolution of disk gas fractions with redshift, our\nsimulations predict the observed trends in both R_e(M_bulge) and M_BH(M_bulge). \n\n"}

A statistical method is described and applied to the colour-magnitude\ndiagram of the six selected components, giving rise to $\\chi^2$-contours in the\nmetallicity--age plane. The effects of the Hipparcos parallaxes on these\nconfidence regions are studied in detail for these binaries through a\ncomparison with very accurate but older orbital parallaxes. There are no\nsignificant differences in 51 Tau and $\\theta^2$ Tau, and hence the test\nvalidates the sets of theoretical tracks used. However the orbital parallax of\nV818 Tau leads to metallicities too large in comparison with the observed\nrange, while the Hipparcos parallax give consistent results, at the 1$\\sigma$\nlevel. Comparisons between the predicted and measured masses are also made and\nshow a good agreement. However, even if the Padova tracks predict correct\nmasses for each component of V818 Tau, there is no Padova track that fits both\ncomponents simultaneously in the mass-radius diagram. Finally, since the\nindividual masses of these binaries are accurately known, some issues about the\ninfluence of the Hipparcos parallaxes on their location in the mass-luminosity\ndiagram are also discussed. \n\n"}

Abstract: The existence of BAL outflows in only radio-quiet QSOs was thought to be an\nimportant clue to mass ejection and the radio-loud - radio-quiet dichotomy.\nRecently a few radio-loud BAL QSOs have been discovered at high redshift. We\npresent evidence that PKS 1004+13 is a radio-loud BAL QSO. It would be the\nfirst known at low-redshift (z = 0.24), and one of the most radio luminous. For\nPKS 1004+13, there appear to be broad absorption troughs of O VI, N V, Si IV,\nand C IV, indicating high-ionization outflows up to about 10,000 km/s. There\nare also two strong, broad (~500 km/s), high-ionization, associated absorption\nsystems that show partial covering of the continuum source. The strong UV\nabsorption we have detected suggests that the extreme soft-X-ray weakness of\nPKS 1004+13 is primarily the result of absorption.

Quantum effects in these phases are considerable (a\nconsequence of the light proton mass) and they have a demonstrable and often\npuzzling influence on many physical properties, including spatial order. To\ndate, the structure of dense hydrogen remains experimentally elusive. Recent\nstudies of the melting curve of hydrogen indicate that at high (but\nexperimentally accessible) pressures, compressed hydrogen will adopt a liquid\nstate, even at low temperatures. In reaching this phase, hydrogen is also\nprojected to pass through an insulator-to-metal transition. This raises the\npossibility of new state of matter: a near ground-state liquid metal, and its\nordered states in the quantum domain. Ordered quantum fluids are traditionally\ncategorized as superconductors or superfluids; these respective systems feature\ndissipationless electrical currents or mass flow. Here we report an analysis\nbased on topological arguments of the projected phase of liquid metallic\nhydrogen, finding that it may represent a new type of ordered quantum fluid.\nSpecifically, we show that liquid metallic hydrogen cannot be categorized\nexclusively as a superconductor or superfluid.

TMT is an alternative gravity and matter field\ntheory where the gravitational interaction of fermionic matter is reduced to\nthat of General Relativity when the energy density of the fermion matter is\nmuch larger than the dark energy density. In this case also the 5-th force\nproblem is solved automatically. In the opposite limit, where the magnitudes of\nfermionic energy density and scalar field dark energy density become\ncomparable, nonrelativistic fermions can participate in the cosmological\nexpansion in a very unusual manner. Some of the features of such states in a\ntoy model of the late time universe filled with homogeneous scalar field and\nuniformly distributed nonrelativistic neutrinos: neutrino mass increases as m ~\na^{3/2}; the neutrino gas equation-of-state approaches w=-1, i.e. neutrinos\nbehave as a sort of dark energy; the total (scalar field + neutrino)\nequation-of-state also approaches w=-1; the total energy density of such\nuniverse is less than it would be in the universe filled with the scalar field\nalone. An analytic solution is presented. A domain structure of the dark energy\nseems to be possible.
