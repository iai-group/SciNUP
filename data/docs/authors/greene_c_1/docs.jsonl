We study these\nmodels under an assumption, akin to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, in\nwhich the volatility has already relaxed to its equilibrium distribution and\nacts as a background to the evolution of the price process.

(1) The\nlong-wavelength, low-frequency (\"hydrodynamic\") part of the theory of Andreev\nand Lifshitz has nine variables, and thus must have nine modes. We find a new\nmode associated with lattice point diffusion (and thus vacancy diffusion); it\nmay explain the absence of supersolid behavior in low-frequency pressure-driven\nflow. (2) The observed upper limit for the NCRI fraction (NCRIf) of about 20%,\nin disordered samples, is more-or-less the same as the already predicted upper\nlimit for the superfluid fraction of a well-ordered crystal; we argue that this\nmay not be a coincidence. (3) The negative experimental evidence for a second\npropagating hydrodynamic mode (expected to be fourth sound-like) may be due to\nthe long relaxation times $\\tau$ at low temperature $T$; only for frequencies\nsatisfying $\\omega\\tau\\ll1$ does the hydrodynamic theory apply. (4) The\nfundamental principles of quantum mechanics imply that Bose-Einstein\ncondensation is not necessary to define a quantum-mechanical phase; therefore\nthe absence of a finite condensate fraction $f_{0}$ does not necessarily imply\nthe absence of superfluidity. (5) Just as vortices should avoid occupied\nlattice sites to provide a vortex-lattice interaction, the lattice should\ninteract with the vortices to provide a lattice-vortex interaction; thus\ndislocations should interact with vortices, whose motion is affected by\nrotation. We discuss some experimental implications for the vortex liquid\nmodel, shear response, hysteresis, and relaxation. \n\n"}

Abstract: Luminous compact blue galaxies (LCBGs) are a diverse class of galaxies\ncharacterized by high luminosities, blue colors, and high surface brightnesses.\nResiding at the high luminosity, high mass end of the blue sequence, LCBGs sit\nat the critical juncture of galaxies that are evolving from the blue to the red\nsequence. Yet we do not understand what drives the evolution of LCBGs, nor how\nthey will evolve. Based on single-dish HI observations, we know that they have\na diverse range of properties. LCBGs are HI-rich with M(HI)=10^{9-10.5} M(sun),\nhave moderate M(dyn)=10^{10-12} M(sun), and 80% have gas depletion timescales\nless than 3 Gyr. These properties are consistent with LCBGs evolving into\nlow-mass spirals or high mass dwarf ellipticals or dwarf irregulars. However,\nLCBGs do not follow the Tully-Fisher relation, nor can most evolve onto it,\nimplying that many LCBGs are not smoothly rotating, virialized systems. GMRT\nand VLA HI maps confirm this conclusion revealing signatures of recent\ninteractions and dynamically hot components in some local LCBGs, consistent\nwith the formation of a thick disk or spheroid. Such signatures and the high\nincidence of close companions around LCBGs suggest that star formation in local\nLCBGs is likely triggered by interactions. The dynamical masses and apparent\nspheroid formation in LCBGs combined with previous results from optical\nspectroscopy are consistent with virial heating being the primary mechanism for\nquenching star formation in these galaxies. \n\n"}

The observed high-z LGRB\nrate shows significant excess over that estimated from the star formation\nhistory.

In the case\nthat LGRB rate is purely proportional to the star formation rate (SFR), our\nsimulations poorly reproduce the LGRB rate at z>4, although the simulated log\nN-log P distribution is in good agreement with the observed one. Assuming that\nthe excess of high-z GRB rate is due to the cosmic metallicity evolution or\nunknown LGRB rate increase parameterized as (1+z)^delta, we find that although\nthe two scenarios alone can improve the consistency between our simulations and\nobservations, incorporation of them gives much better consistency.

The\ncollectively enhanced coupling of all atoms to the cavity field with coherent\ncoupling strengths which are much larger than the decay rates in the system\nleads to the strong coupling regime of the resulting effective Jaynes-Cummings\nmodel. We use numerical simulations to show that the cavity transmission can be\nused to reveal detailed properties of the Jaynes-Cummings ladder of excited\nstates, and that the atomic nonlinearity gives rise to highly non-trivial\nphoton emission from the cavity. Finally, we suggest that the absence of\ninteractions between remote Rydberg atoms may, due to a combinatorial effect,\ninduce a cavity-assisted excitation blockade whose range is larger than the\ntypical Rydberg dipole-dipole interaction length. \n\n"}

In one set of experiments atoms\nwere excited by linearly polarized light from an extended cavity diode laser\nwith polarization vector perpendicular to the light's propagation direction and\nmagnetic field, and laser induced fluorescence (LIF) was observed along the\ndirection of the magnetic field, which was scanned.

Unified general treatment of the entire photon spectrum\nmakes basic physics intelligible to all. In the optical region the mean\ndistance between the scattering atoms is much longer than the photon wave\nlength, Dicke superradiant scattering is isotropic and multiple scattering,\nFano couplings are important and the lifetimes of intermediate stats are\nsufficiently short to be negligible.

Application to\n  171Yb atoms trapped in a 2D optical lattice Abstract: We have constructed the geometric phases emerging from the non-trivial\ntopology of a space-dependent magnetic field, interacting with the spin\nmagnetic moment of a neutral particle. Our basic tool is the local unitary\ntransformation which recasts the magnetic spin interaction under a diagonal\nform. Rewriting the kinetic term in the \"rotated\" frame requires the\nintroduction of non-Abelian covariant derivatives, involving the gradients of\nthe Euler angles which define the orientation of the local field. Within the\nrotated frame, we have built a perturbation scheme,assuming that the\nlongitudinal non-Abelian field component dominates the transverse ones, to be\nevaluated to second-order. The geometry embedded in the longitudinal gauge\nvector field and its curl, the geometric magnetic field, is described by the\nassociated Aharonov-Bohm phase. As an illustration, we study the physics of\ncold 171Yb atoms dressed by two sets of circularly polarized beams, forming\nsquare or triangular 2D optical lattices.

We use a volume-limited sample of galaxies\nwith redshifts less than 0.03 drawn from the SDSS DR7 to investigate the scale\ndependence of the effect and how it changes as a function of the mass of the\ncentral galaxy. Conformity extends over a central galaxy stellar mass range\nspanning two orders of magnitude. In central galaxies with masses less than\n10^10 M_sun, conformity extends out to scales in excess of 4 Mpc, well beyond\nthe virial radii of their dark matter halos. For low mass central galaxies,\nlarge-scale conformity with neighbours is only seen when the centrals have low\nstar formation rate or gas content. In contrast, at high stellar masses,\nconformity with neighbours applies in the gas-rich regime and is clearly\nconfined to scales comparable to the virial radius of the dark matter halo of\nthe central galaxy. Our analysis of a mock catalogue from the Guo et al (2011)\nmodels shows that conformity-like effects are much weaker than observed, and\napply only to the low SFR/M* tail of neighbouring galaxies.

In many theoretical treatments, the key to understanding\nthe dynamics has been to assume the external (motional) degrees of freedom are\ndecoupled from the pseudospin degrees of freedom. Determining the validity of\nthis approximation -- known as the spin model approximation -- is complicated,\nand has not been addressed in detail. Here we shed light in this direction by\ncalculating Ramsey dynamics exactly for two interacting spin-1/2 particles in a\nharmonic trap.

It is typically\nfound that there will be many well-constrained degrees of freedom. However, not\nall and, probably most, of these degrees of freedom were physical if the\nparametrization had allowed for an arbitrary $k$-dependence. In this paper, we\nrestrict the $k$-dependence to that allowed in local theories of gravity under\nthe quasi-static approximation, i.e. ratios of polynomials in $k$, and identify\nthe best constrained features in the ($z$,$k$)-dependence of the commonly\nconsidered functions $\\mu$ and $\\gamma$ as measured by an LSST-like weak\nlensing survey.

We present a hierachy of\ndensity-functional-type theories that describe the interaction of charged\nparticles with photons and introduce the appropriate Kohn-Sham schemes. We show\nhow the evolution of a system described by quantum electrodynamics in Coulomb\ngauge is uniquely determined by its initial state and two reduced quantities.\nThese two fundamental observables, the polarization of the Dirac field and the\nvector potential of the photon field, can be calculated by solving two coupled,\nnon-linear evolution equations without the need to explicitly determine the\n(numerically infeasible) many-body wave function of the coupled quantum system.\nTo find reliable approximations to the implicit functionals we present the\naccording Kohn-Sham construction. In the non-relativistic limit this\ndensity-functional-type theory of quantum electrodynamics reduces to the\ndensity-functional reformulation of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian, which is based\non the current density of the electrons and the vector potential of the photon\nfield.

First, there could be\ndegradation of fidelity by a common field environment even when both quantum\nobjects are in inertial motion. Second, relativistic effects entering the\ndescription of the dynamics such as frame dependence, time dilation, and\nDoppler shift, already existent in inertial motion, can compete with or even\noverwhelm the effect due to uniform acceleration in a quantum field. We show it\nis not true that larger acceleration of an object would necessarily lead to a\nfaster degradation of fidelity.

In this paper, the method is tested against\nhigh-order harmonic generation (HHG) and Fano profiles in absorption spectra\nwith the help of a numerically exactly solvable one-dimensional model He atom,\nstarting from the spin-singlet ground state. Such benchmarks are challenging\nbecause Fano profiles originate from transitions involving autoionizing states,\nand HHG is a strong-field phenomenon well beyond linear response. TDRNOT with\njust one natural orbital per spin in the helium spin-singlet case is equivalent\nto time-dependent Hartree-Fock or time-dependent density functional theory\n(TDDFT) in exact exchange-only approximation. It is not unexpected that TDDFT\nfails in reproducing Fano profiles due to the lack of doubly excited,\nautoionizing states. HHG spectra, on the other hand, are widely believed to be\nwell-captured by TDDFT. However, HHG spectra of helium may display a second\nplateau that originates from simultaneous HHG in He$^+$ and neutral He. It is\nfound that already TDRNOT with two natural orbitals per spin is sufficient to\ncapture this effect as well as the Fano profiles on a qualitative level. With\nmore natural orbitals (6--8 per spin) quantitative agreement can be reached.\nErrors due to the truncation to a finite number of orbitals are identified. \n\n"}

However, so far, most of the attention has been on\nmoving nodes; little is known about the possibility of chaos in the case of\nstationary nodes. We address this question by considering stationary states,\nwhich provide the simplest examples of wave functions with stationary nodes. We\nprovide examples of stationary wave functions for which there is chaos, as\ndemonstrated by numerical computations, for one particle moving in 3 spatial\ndimensions and for two and three entangled particles in two dimensions. Our\nconclusion is that the motion of the nodes is not necessary for the generation\nof chaos. What is important is the overall complexity of the wave function.\nThat is, if the wave function, or rather its phase, has complex spatial\nvariations, it will lead to complex Bohmian trajectories and hence to chaos.\nAnother aspect of our work concerns the average Lyapunov exponent, which\nquantifies the overall amount of chaos. Since it is very hard to evaluate the\naverage Lyapunov exponent analytically, which is often computed numerically, it\nis useful to have simple quantities that agree well with the average Lyapunov\nexponent.

Here, for the first time, in the framework of a\ncluster MF treatment, we extract the signature of EE in the bosonic\nsuperfluid-insulator transitions. We consider a trimerized Kagome lattice of\ninteracting bosons, in which each trimer is treated as a cluster, and implement\nthe cluster MF treatment by decoupling all inter-trimer hopping. In addition to\nsuperfluid and integer insulator phases, we find that fractional insulator\nphases appear when the tunneling is dominated by the intra-trimer part.

A fundamental limit in nearly all applications based\non such systems arises from spontaneous emission, in which photons are absorbed\nby atoms and then re-scattered into undesired channels. In typical treatments\nof atomic ensembles, it is assumed that this re-scattering occurs\nindependently, and at a rate given by a single isolated atom, which in turn\ngives rise to standard limits of fidelity in applications such as quantum\nmemories or quantum gates. However, this assumption can be violated. In\nparticular, spontaneous emission of a collective atomic excitation can be\nsignificantly suppressed through strong interference in emission. Thus far the\nphysics underlying the phenomenon of subradiance and techniques to exploit it\nhave not been well-understood. In this work, we provide a comprehensive\ntreatment of this problem. First, we show that in ordered atomic arrays in free\nspace, subradiant states acquire an interpretation in terms of optical modes\nthat are guided by the array, which only emit due to scattering from the ends\nof the finite chain. We also elucidate the properties of subradiant states in\nthe many-excitation limit. Finally, we introduce the new concept of selective\nradiance. Whereas subradiant states experience a reduced coupling to all\noptical modes, selectively radiant states are tailored to simultaneously\nradiate efficiently into a desired channel while scattering into undesired\nchannels is suppressed, thus enabling an enhanced atom-light interface. We show\nthat these states naturally appear in chains of atoms coupled to nanophotonic\nstructures, and we analyze the performance of photon storage exploiting such\nstates. We find that selectively radiant states allow for a photon storage\nerror that scales exponentially better with number of atoms than previously\nknown bounds. \n\n"}

We study the\nlight-matter interaction under the situation where one control field carries an\noptical vortex, and another control field has no vortex. We show that the\norbital angular momentum (OAM) of the vortex control beam can be transferred to\na generated probe field through a four-wave mixing (FWM) process and without\nswitching on and off of the control fields. Such a mechanism of OAM transfer is\nmuch simpler than in a double-tripod scheme in which the exchange of vortices\nis possible only when two control fields carry optical vortices of opposite\nhelicity.

We focus on two different models where the scalar field couples\nlinearly or quadratically to the standard model of matter fields. For both\nthese cases, we derive the solutions of the scalar field. We also derive from\nfirst principles the expressions for two types of observables: (i) the local\ncomparison of two atomic sensors that are differently sensitive to the\nconstants of Nature and (ii) the local differential acceleration between two\ntest-masses with different compositions. For the linear coupling, we recover\nthat the signatures induced by DM on both observables are the sum of harmonic\nand Yukawa terms. For the quadratic coupling on the other hand, the signatures\nderived for both types of observables turn out to be a sum of a time\nindependent term and of an harmonic oscillation, whose amplitudes both depend\non the position. Such a behavior is new and can make experiments in space more\nsensitive than terrestrial ones. Besides, the observables present some\ninteresting non-linear behaviors that are due to the amplification or to the\nscreening of the scalar-field, depending on the parameters of the theory, and\non the compactness of the source of the gravitational field.

We show that Yb atoms can be trapped using\na short wavelength (~470 nm) tweezer at a distance of 350 nm from the silicon\nphotonic crystal cavity. At this distance, due to the slowly decaying\nevanescent cavity field at a longer wavelength, we obtain a single-photon Rabi\nfrequency of g/(2pi)~100 MHz and a cooperativity of C~47 while maintaining a\nhigh photon collection efficiency into a single mode fiber. The combination of\nhigh system efficiency, telecom-band operation, and long coherence times makes\nthis platform well suited for quantum optics on a silicon chip and\nlong-distance quantum communication. \n\n"}

Since condensates, unlike photons, are\ninteracting, they may permit the realization of specific quantum states needed\nas input of an interferometer to approach the Heisenberg limit, the supposed\nlower bound to precision phase measurements. To this end, we study the\nsensitivity to external weak perturbations of a representative matter-wave\nMach-Zehnder interferometer whose input are two Bose-Einstein condensates\ncreated by splitting a single condensate in two parts. The interferometric\nphase sensitivity depends on the specific quantum state created with the two\ncondensates, and, therefore, on the time scale of the splitting process. We\nidentify three different regimes, characterized by a phase sensitivity $\\Delta\n\\theta$ scaling with the total number of condensate particles $N$ as i) the\nstandard quantum limit $\\Delta \\theta \\sim 1/N^{1/2}$, ii) the sub shot-noise\n$\\Delta \\theta \\sim 1/N^{3/4}$ and the iii) the Heisenberg limit $\\Delta \\theta\n\\sim 1/N$.

Another\npoint at issue is whether one might do better with stable, cold atoms than with\nthermal atoms. To compensate for the large drawback of the small number of\natoms available in a trap, one must take advantage of their low velocity. To\nlengthen the time of interaction with the excitation laser, we suggest choosing\na geometry where the laser beam exciting the transition is colinear to a slow,\ncold atomic beam, either extracted from a trap or prepared by Zeeman slowing.\nWe also suggest a new observable physical quantity manifesting APV, which\npresents several advantages:specificity, efficiency of detection, possibility\nof direct calibration by a parity conserving quantity of a similar nature.

We assume that in the process of a nearly instantaneous\nquantum measurement, the function of the environment involves two distinct\nparts: the pointer and the bath.
