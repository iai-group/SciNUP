{"id": "0709.0199", "contents": "Title: No de Sitter invariant vacuum in massive gravity theory with ghost Abstract: In this letter we point out that the massive gravity theory with a graviton\nghost mode in de Sitter background cannot possess a de Sitter invariant vacuum\nstate. In order to avoid a negative norm state, we must associate the creation\noperator of the ghost mode with a negative-energy mode function instead of a\npositive-energy one as the mode function. Namely, we have to adopt a different\nprocedure of quantization for a ghost. When a theory has a symmetry mixing a\nghost mode with ordinary non-ghost modes, the choice of a ghost mode is not\nunique. However, quantization of a ghost is impossible without specifying a\nchoice of ghost mode, which breaks the symmetry. For this reason, the vacuum\nstate cannot respect the symmetry. In the massive gravity theory with a\ngraviton ghost mode in de Sitter background, the ghost is the helicity-0 mode\nof the graviton. This ghost mode is mixed with the other helicity graviton\nmodes under the action of de Sitter symmetry. Therefore, there is no de Sitter\ninvariant vacuum in such models. This leads to an interesting possibility that\nnon-covariant cutoff of the low energy effective theory may naturally arise. As\na result, the instability due to the pair production of a ghost and normal\nnon-ghost particles gets much milder and that the model may escape from being\nrejected. \n\n"}

Though these equations have been studied in the classical\nmathematical literature, it appears that the physics community is largely\nunaware of the relevant formalism. Of particular importance is the fate of the\ninitial value problem. Under what circumstances do infinite order differential\nequations possess a well-defined initial value problem and how many initial\ndata are required? In this paper we study the initial value problem for\ninfinite order differential equations in the mathematical framework of the\nformal operator calculus, with analytic initial data. This formalism allows us\nto handle simultaneously a wide array of different nonlocal equations within a\nsingle framework and also admits a transparent physical interpretation.

For the specific case in which the\ndiffusion time has the size of the minimal length, the spacetime turns out to\nhave a spectral dimension equal to 2, suggesting a possible renormalizable\ncharacter of gravity in this regime. For smaller diffusion times, the spectral\ndimension approaches zero, making any physical interpretation less reliable in\nthis extreme regime. We extend our result to the presence of a background field\nand curvature. We show that in this case the spectral dimension has a more\ncomplicated relation with the diffusion time, and conclusions about the\nrenormalizable character of gravity become less straightforward with respect to\nwhat we found with the flat space analysis. \n\n"}

As many other supersymmetries, Q-symmetry must be perturbatively\nstable due to what is generically known as non-renormalization theorems. As a\nresult, all (equilibrium) dynamical models are divided into three major\ncategories: Markovian models with unbroken Q-symmetry, chaotic models with\nQ-symmetry spontaneously broken on the mean-field level by, e.g., fractal\ninvariant sets (e.g., strange attractors), and intermittent or self-organized\ncritical (SOC) models with Q-symmetry dynamically broken by the condensation of\ninstanton-antiinstanton configurations (earthquakes, avalanches etc.) SOC is a\nfull-dimensional phase separating chaos and Markovian dynamics.

That picture is valid at any value of the 't Hooft coupling. So far\nit has been efficiently used at weak coupling (WC) in cases where only a single\nparticle is flowing. At any finite value of the coupling however, an infinite\nnumber of particles are flowing on top of the color FT. A major open problem in\nthis approach was how to deal with generic multi-particle states at WC. In this\npaper we study the propagation of any number of FT excitations at WC. We do\nthis by first mapping the WL into a sum of two point functions of local\noperators. This map allows us to translate the integrability techniques\ndeveloped for the spectrum problem back to the WL. E.g., the FT Hamiltonian can\nbe represented as a simple kernel acting on the loop. Having an explicit\nrepresentation for the FT Hamiltonian allows us to treat any number of\nparticles on an equal footing. We use it to bootstrap some simple cases where\ntwo particles are flowing, dual to N2MHV amplitudes. The FT is integrable and\ntherefore has other (infinite set of) conserved charges. The generating\nfunction of conserved charges is constructed from the monodromy (M) matrix\nbetween sides of the polygon. We compute it for some simple examples at leading\norder at WC.

The total Hilbert space is the tensor product of the two\nspaces $H_{right}\\otimes H_{left}$, where in this case $H_{left/right}$ denotes\nthe physical quantum states space of the closed string .It is shown that closed\nstring states can be represented by a maximally entangled two-mode squeezed\nstate of the left and right spaces of closed string. Also, the entropy for\nthese string states is calculated.It is found that black hole entropy matches\nthe closed string entropy at transition point.This means that our result is\nconsistent with correspondence principle and thus HM mechanism in string theory\nworks . Consequently the unitarity of the black hole in string theory can be\nreconciled.However Gottesman and Preskill point out that, in this scenario,\ndepartures from unitarity can arise due to interactions between the collapsing\nbody and the infalling Hawking radiation inside the event horizon and\ninformation can be lost.

Instead, gauge invariant quantities generally become\ndiscontinuous, thus not admitting Poisson-algebraic structures and posing\nserious challenges to a quantization. Non-integrability also renders the\nparadigm of relational dynamics cumbersome, thereby straining common\ninterpretations of the dynamics. We illustrate these conceptual and technical\nchallenges with simple toy models. In particular, we exhibit reparametrization\ninvariant models which fail to be integrable and, as a consequence, can either\nnot be quantized with standard methods or lead to sick quantum theories without\na semiclassical limit.

The covariant form of Gauss\nlaw is conceptually important for studying asymptotic properties of the gauge\nfields. For QED in $3+1$ dimensions, we have developed a formalism for treating\nthe equations of motion (EOM) themselves as constraints, that is, constraints\non states using Peierls' quantization. They generate spacetime dependent gauge\ntransformations. We extend these results to the Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS)\nLagrangian. The surprising result is that the covariant Gauss law commutes with\nall observables: the gauge invariance of the Lagrangian gets trivialized upon\nquantization. The calculations do not fix a gauge. We also consider a novel\ngauge condition on test functions (not on quantum fields) which we name the\n\"quasi-self-dual gauge\" condition. It explicitly shows the mass spectrum of the\ntheory.

One key\ningredient is the adoption of a local notion of entropic time in which instants\nare defined on curved three-dimensional surfaces and time evolution consists of\nthe accumulation of changes induced by local deformations of these surfaces.\nThe resulting dynamics is a non-dissipative diffusion that is constrained by\nthe requirements of foliation invariance and incorporates the necessary local\nquantum potentials. As applications of the formalism we derive the Ehrenfest\nrelations for fields in curved-spacetime and briefly discuss the nature of\ndivergences in quantum field theory. \n\n"}

In these models, operators spread through the ballistic\npropagation of quasiparticles, with an operator front whose velocity is locally\nset by the fastest quasiparticle velocity. In interacting integrable systems,\nthis velocity depends on the density of the other quasiparticles, so\nequilibrium density fluctuations cause the front to follow a biased random\nwalk, and therefore to broaden diffusively. Ballistic front propagation and\ndiffusive front broadening are also generically present in non-integrable\nsystems in one dimension; thus, although the mechanisms for operator spreading\nare distinct in the two cases, these coarse grained measures of the operator\nfront do not distinguish between the two cases. We present an expression for\nthe front-broadening rate; we explicitly derive this for a particular\nintegrable model (the \"Floquet-Fredrickson-Andersen\" model), and argue on\nkinetic grounds that it should apply generally. Our results elucidate the\nmicroscopic mechanism for diffusive corrections to ballistic transport in\ninteracting integrable models. \n\n"}

We review various aspects of the mirror\nsymmetry conjecture and discuss a geometric approach in proving it.\n  The existence of rigid Calabi-Yau manifolds poses a serious challenge to the\nconjecture. The proposed mirror partners for them are higher dimensional\ngeneralized Calabi-Yau manifolds. For example, the mirror partner for a certain\nK3 surface is a cubic fourfold and its Fano variety of lines is birational to\nthe Hilbert scheme of two points on the K3. This hyperkahler manifold can be\ninterpreted as the SYZ mirror of the K3 by considering singular special\nLagrangian tori.\n  We also compare the geometries between a CY and its associated generalized\nCY.
