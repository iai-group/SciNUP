This system can be solved exactly in the chiral limit. We have\nestablished the space of the smooth test functions (consisting of the Green's\nfunctions for the quark propagator and the corresponding quark-gluon vertex) in\nwhich our generalized function (the confining gluon propagator) becomes a\ncontinuous linear functional.

The objects are selected in X-ray luminosity only, optimally\nsampling the cluster luminosity function; temperatures range from 2 to 9 keV\nand there is no bias toward any particular morphological type. Pertinent values\nare extracted in an aperture corresponding to R_500, estimated using the tight\ncorrelation between Y_X and total mass.

We\nexamine the causes for the steepening, finding that the primary driver appears\nto be a systematic variation of the gas content with mass. Scatter about the\nrelations is dominated in all cases by the presence of cool cores. The natural\nlogarithmic scatter about the raw X-ray luminosity-temperature relation is\nabout 70%, and about the X-ray luminosity-Y_X relation it is 40%. Cool core and\nmorphologically disturbed systems occupy distinct regions in the residual space\nwith respect to the best fitting mean relation, the former lying systematically\nto the high luminosity side, the latter to the low luminosity side.

The\nstar formation efficiency is large and increases monotonically to low masses,\nin disagreement with data. With outflows, the baryon fraction is increasingly\nsuppressed in halos to lower masses. A Milky Way-sized halo at z=0 has about\n60% of the cosmic fraction of baryons, so \"missing\" halo baryons have largely\nbeen evacuated, rather than existing in some hidden form. Large halos (>10^13\nMo) contain 85% of their cosmic share of baryons, which explains the mild\nmissing baryon problem seen in clusters.

Each halo is resolved with ~ 10^8 particles (at a mass\nresolution ~ 10^3-4 M_sun/h) within its virial radius. Subhaloes with masses\nlarger than 10^5 M_sun/h are well resolved, an improvement of at least two\norders of magnitude over previous lensing studies. We incorporate a baryonic\ncomponent modelled as a Hernquist profile and account for the response of the\ndark matter via adiabatic contraction. We focus on the \"anomalous\" flux ratio\nproblem, in particular on the violation of the cusp-caustic relation due to\nsubstructures. We find that subhaloes with masses less than ~ 10^8 M_sun/h play\nan important role in causing flux anomalies; such low mass subhaloes have been\nunresolved in previous studies. There is large scatter in the predicted flux\nratios between different haloes and between different projections of the same\nhalo. In some cases, the frequency of predicted anomalous flux ratios is\ncomparable to that observed for the radio lenses, although in most cases it is\nnot. The probability for the simulations to reproduce the observed violations\nof the cusp lenses is about 0.001. We therefore conclude that the amount of\nsubstructure in the central regions of the Aquarius haloes is insufficient to\nexplain the observed frequency of violations of the cusp-caustic relation.\nThese conclusions are based purely on our dark matter simulations which ignore\nthe effect of baryons on subhalo survivability. \n\n"}

Two versions of the\nmodel are studied, one with non-thermal DM as the origin of the boost factor\nand one with Sommerfeld enhancement. In the case of non-thermal DM, four hidden\nsector scalars which transform under a U(1)_{X} symmetry are added. The\nheaviest scalars decouple and later decay to DM scalars, so providing the boost\nfactor necessary to explain the present DM annihilation rate. The mass of the\nannihilating scalars is limited to < 600 GeV for the model to remain\nperturbative. U(1)_{X} breaking to Z_2 at the electroweak transition mixes\nlight O(100) MeV hidden sector scalars with the Higgs. The DM scalars\nannihilate to these light scalars, which subsequently decay to two mu^{+}\nmu^{-} pairs via Higgs mixing, so generating a positron excess without\nantiprotons. Decay to \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-} rather than e^{+}e^{-} is necessary to\nensure a fast enough light scalar decay rate to evade light scalar domination\nat nucleosynthesis.

The contribution of nuclear\nactivity to the bolometric luminosity in these systems is quantified using six\nindependent methods that span a range in wavelength and give consistent results\nwithin ~ +/-10-15% on average. The average derived AGN contribution in ULIRGs\nis ~35-40%, ranging from ~15-35% among \"cool\" (f_25/f_60 =< 0.2) optically\nclassified HII-like and LINER ULIRGs to ~50 and ~75% among warm Seyfert 2 and\nSeyfert 1 ULIRGs, respectively.

Both the length and the contrast of the Fourier bars decrease along\nthe morphological sequence Sb-Sbc-Sc, with bars in earlier types being longer\nand showing higher contrast.

We find that longer bars are not necessarily stronger (as quantified by\nthe torque Q_{b} measure), but longer bars show a higher contrast, in very good\nagreement with theoretical predictions. Our data suggests that bar and spiral\ncomponents are rather independent in the sense that the torque strengths of the\ntwo components are not correlated.

To constrain galaxy number densities,\nluminosities, and stellar populations in large structures at higher redshift,\nwe have investigated two sheet-like structures of galaxies at z=0.8 and 1.3\nspanning 150 h^-1 comoving Mpc embedded in large quasar groups extending over\nat least 200 h^-1 Mpc.

However, the use of quasar spectra to measure the IGM\ndamping wing requires a model of the quasar's intrinsic Lyman-alpha emission\nline. Here we quantify the uncertainties in the intrinsic line shapes, and how\nthose uncertainties affect the determination of the IGM neutral fraction. We\nhave assembled a catalog of high-resolution HST spectra of the emission lines\nof unobscured low-redshift quasars, and have characterized the variance in the\nshapes of their lines. We then add simulated absorption from the high-redshift\nIGM to these quasar spectra in order to determine the corresponding\nuncertainties in reionization constraints using current and future samples of z\n> 6 quasar spectra. We find that, if the redshift of the Lyman-alpha emission\nline is presumed to coincide with the systemic redshift determined from metal\nlines, the inferred IGM neutral fraction is systematically biased to low values\ndue to a systematic blueshift of the Lyman-alpha line relative to the metal\nlines.

Distances to stars are determined using a\nphotometric parallax relation, covering a distance range from ~100 pc to 10 kpc\nover a quarter of the sky at high Galactic latitudes (|b|>20 degrees). We find\nthat in the region defined by 1 kpc <Z< 5 kpc and 3 kpc <R< 13 kpc, the\nrotational velocity for disk stars smoothly decreases, and all three components\nof the velocity dispersion increase, with distance from the Galactic plane.

All of these studies\nfocus on broad line quasars with BH mass estimated from virial estimators based\non single-epoch spectra. Since the sample selection is largely based on quasar\nluminosity, the cosmic scatter in the BH-bulge relation introduces a\nstatistical bias leading to on average more massive BHs given galaxy properties\nat high redshift (Lauer et al. 2007). We here emphasize a previously\nunder-appreciated statistical bias resulting from the uncertainty of\nsingle-epoch virial BH mass estimators and the shape of the underlying (true)\nBH mass function, which leads to on average overestimation of the true BH\nmasses at the high-mass end (Shen et al. 2008). We demonstrate that the latter\nvirial mass bias can contribute a substantial amount to the observed excess in\nBH mass at fixed bulge properties, comparable to the Lauer et al. bias.

For small and medium\ndensities, the phase transition is accurately described in the framework of the\nField Correlation Method, whereas at high density predictions are less certain\nand leave room for the phenomenological models. We study formation of\nmultiquark states (MQS) at zero temperature and high density. Relevant MQS\ncomponents of the nuclear matter can be described using a previously developed\nformalism of the quark compound bags (QCB).\n  Partial-wave analysis of nucleon-nucleon scattering indicates the existence\nof 6QS which manifest themselves as poles of $P$-matrix. In the framework of\nthe QCB model, we formulate a self-consistent system of coupled equations for\nthe nucleon and 6QS propagators in nuclear matter and the G-matrix. The\napproach provides a link between high-density nuclear matter with the MQS\ncomponents and the cumulative effect observed in reactions on the nuclei, which\nrequires the admixture of MQS in the wave functions of nuclei kinematically.\n  6QS determine the natural scale of the density for a possible phase\ntransition into the MQS phase of nuclear matter. Such a phase transition can\nlead to dynamic instability of newly born protoneutron stars and dramatically\naffect the dynamics of supernovae. Numerical simulations show that the phase\ntransition may be a good remedy for the triggering supernova explosions in the\nspherically symmetric supernova models. A specific signature of the phase\ntransition is an additional neutrino peak in the neutrino light curve. For a\nGalactic core-collapse supernova, such a peak could be resolved by the present\nneutrino detectors.

The molecular composition of the\ntwo outflows presents systematic changes with velocity that we analyze by\ndividing the outflow in three chemical regimes, two of them associated with the\nwing component and the other the EHV gas. The analysis of the two wing regimes\nshows that species like H2CO and CH3OH favor the low-velocity gas, while SiO\nand HCN are more abundant in the fastest gas. We also find that the EHV regime\nis relatively rich in O-bearing species, as is not only detected in CO and SiO\n(already reported elsewhere), but also in SO, CH3OH, and H2CO (newly reported\nhere), with a tentative detection in HCO+.

The\nsample consists of galaxies selected at 250{\\mu}m which have reliable\ncounterparts from SDSS at z < 0.5, and contains 1867 sources. Dust masses are\ncalculated using both a single temperature grey-body model for the spectral\nenergy distribution and also using a model with multiple temperature\ncomponents.

For such solutions,\nthe hydrodynamic variables remain constant. We construct asymptotically AdS\nsolutions of Einstein's gravity dual to such processes at strong coupling,\nperturbatively in the amplitude expansion, where the expansion parameter is the\nratio of the amplitude of the non-hydrodynamic shear-stress tensor to the\npressure. At each order, we sum over all time derivatives through exact\nrecursion relations.

At the linear order, this equation of motion\nimplies that the metric perturbations are composed of zero wavelength\nquasinormal modes. Our method allows us to calculate the non-linear corrections\nto this equation perturbatively in the amplitude expansion. We thus derive a\nspecial case of our previous conjecture on the regularity condition on the\nboundary stress tensor that endows the bulk metric with a regular future\nhorizon, and also refine it further.

The dispersion in\nthe recovered halo mass does not seem to depend on the resolution of the\nsimulation. Regardless of the halo mass, the individual accretion histories,\nspin parameter evolution and fraction of mass in substructures are well\nrecovered. The mass of rescaled haloes can be underestimated (overestimated)\nfor negative (positive) variations of either sigma_8 or Omega_m, in a way that\ndoes not depend on the halo mass.

Our\nbest fit results for the evolution factor E(z)^alpha are alpha = -1.04+-0.07\nfor the M-T relation, alpha = -0.23+0.12-0.62 for the L-T relation, and alpha =\n-0.93+0.62-0.12 for the M-L_X relation.

DDM\nmodels have been studied, in part, as a way to address apparent discrepancies\nbetween the predictions of standard cold dark matter models and observations of\ngalactic structure. Our study is aimed at developing independent constraints on\nthese models. In such models, DDM decays into a less massive, stable dark\nmatter (SDM) particle and a significantly lighter particle. The small mass\nsplitting between the parent DDM and the daughter SDM provides the SDM with a\nrecoil or \"kick\" velocity vk, inducing a free-streaming suppression of matter\nfluctuations. This suppression may be probed via weak lensing power spectra\nmeasured by a number of forthcoming imaging surveys that aim primarily to\nconstrain dark energy. Using scales on which linear perturbation theory alone\nis valid (multipoles < 300), surveys like Euclid or LSST can be sensitive to vk\n> 90 km/s for lifetimes ~ 1-5 Gyr. To estimate more aggressive constraints, we\nmodel nonlinear corrections to lensing power using a simple halo evolution\nmodel that is in good agreement with numerical simulations. In our most\nambitious forecasts, using multipoles < 3000, we find that imaging surveys can\nbe sensitive to vk ~ 10 km/s for lifetimes < 10 Gyr. Lensing will provide a\nparticularly interesting complement to existing constraints in that they will\nprobe the long lifetime regime far better than contemporary techniques. A\ncaveat to these ambitious forecasts is that the evolution of perturbations on\nnonlinear scales will need to be well calibrated by numerical simulations\nbefore they can be realized. This work motivates the pursuit of such a\nnumerical simulation campaign to constrain dark matter with cosmological weak\nlensing. \n\n"}

We start with an account\nof the connections between isolating integrals, quasiperiodicity and\nangle-action variables - these variables played a unifying role throughout the\nlectures. This leads on to the phenomenon of resonant trapping and how this can\nlead to chaos in cuspy potentials and phase-space mixing in slowly evolving\npotentials. Surfaces of section and frequency analysis are introduced as\ndiagnostics of phase-space structure. Real galactic potentials include a\nfluctuating part that drives the system towards unattainable thermal\nequilibrium. Two-body encounters are only one source of fluctuations, and all\nfluctuations will drive similar evolution. We derive the orbit-averaged\nFokker-Planck equation and relations that hold between the second-order\ndiffusion coefficients and both the power spectrum of the fluctuations and the\nfirst-order diffusion coefficients.

For practical purposes, the chiral\nfermionic sector of Lee-wick theories requires two Lee-Wick partners per\nfermion which opens up the possibility for a negative energy density of the\nearly universe. A toy Lee-Wick model with one fermionic partner relaxes such\noddities and hence easy to deal with. In a similar way, the longitudinal\ndegrees of freedom of the massive gauge boson partners also have the potential\nto yield negative energy densities and thus those will be neglected in a toy\nmodel study. In such a toy model one can analytically calculate the\ntime-temperature relation in the very early radiation dominated universe which\nshows interesting new physics.

We find that the galaxy number\ndensity above ~ 2.5 10^{11} M agrees with previous determinations. We perform a\ncomparison with semi-analytic galaxy formation models tailored to the BOSS\ntarget selection and volume, in order to contain incompleteness. The abundance\nof massive galaxies in the models compare fairly well with the BOSS data, but\nthe models lack galaxies at the massive end. Moreover, no evolution with\nredshift is detected from ~0.6 to 0.4 in the data, whereas the abundance of\nmassive galaxies in the models increases to redshift zero. Additionally, BOSS\ndata display colour-magnitude (mass) relations similar to those found in the\nlocal Universe, where the most massive galaxies are the reddest. On the other\nhand, the model colours do not display a dependence on stellar mass, span a\nnarrower range and are typically bluer than the observations. We argue that the\nlack of a colour-mass relation for massive galaxies in the models is mostly due\nto metallicity, which is too low in the models. \n\n"}

Abstract: It is known that the diffuse H-alpha emission outside of bright H II regions\nnot only are very extended, but also can occur in distinct patches or filaments\nfar from H II regions, and the line ratios of [S II] 6716/H-alpha and [N II]\n6583/H-alpha observed far from bright H II regions are generally higher than\nthose in the H II regions. These observations have been regarded as evidence\nagainst the dust-scattering origin of the diffuse H-alpha emission (including\nother optical lines), and the effect of dust scattering has been neglected in\nstudies on the diffuse H-alpha emission. In this paper, we reexamine the\narguments against dust scattering and find that the dust-scattering origin of\nthe diffuse H-alpha emission cannot be ruled out. As opposed to the previous\ncontention, the expected dust- scattered H-alpha halos surrounding H II regions\nare, in fact, in good agreement with the observed H-alpha morphology.

We have considered\nbeta_0=10^2, 10^3 and 10^4 and in the first two cases the most unstable linear\nMRI modes are well resolved in the simulations. We find that the behavior of\nthe MRI turbulence strongly depends on beta_0: The radial transport of angular\nmomentum increases with net vertical flux, achieving alpha=0.08 for beta_0=10^4\nand alpha>1.0 for beta_0=100, where alpha is the Shakura-Sunyaev parameter. A\ncritical value lies at beta_0=10^3: For beta_0>10^3, the disk consists of a gas\npressure dominated midplane and a magnetically dominated corona. The turbulent\nstrength increases with net flux, and angular momentum transport is dominated\nby turbulent fluctuations. The magnetic dynamo that leads to cyclic flips of\nlarge-scale fields still exists, but becomes more sporadic as net flux\nincreases. For beta_0<10^3, the entire disk becomes magnetic dominated.

We find no convincing evidence for a dependence of clustering on the\ngalactic atomic hydrogen (HI) mass, over the range M_HI ~ 10^{8.5} - 10^{10.5}\nM_sun.

{"id": "1401.0586", "contents": "Title: Hot Accretion Flows Around Black Holes Abstract: Black hole accretion flows can be divided into two broad classes: cold and\nhot. Cold accretion flows, which consist of cool optically thick gas, are found\nat relatively high mass accretion rates. Prominent examples are the standard\nthin disk, which occurs at a fraction of the Eddington mass accretion rate, and\nthe slim disk at super-Eddington rates. These accretion flows are responsible\nfor luminous systems such as active galactic nuclei radiating at or close to\nthe Eddington luminosity and black hole X-ray binaries in the soft state. Hot\naccretion flows, the topic of this review, are virially hot and optically thin.\nThey occur at lower mass accretion rates, and are described by models such as\nthe advection-dominated accretion flow and luminous hot accretion flow. Because\nof energy advection, the radiative efficiency of these flows is in general\nlower than that of a standard thin accretion disk. Moreover, the efficiency\ndecreases with decreasing mass accretion rate. Observations show that hot\naccretion flows are associated with jets. In addition, theoretical arguments\nsuggest that hot flows should produce strong winds. Hot accretion flows are\nbelieved to be present in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and in black\nhole X-ray binaries in the hard and quiescent states. The prototype is Sgr A*,\nthe ultra-low-luminosity supermassive black hole at our Galactic center. The\njet, wind and radiation from a supermassive black hole with a hot accretion\nflow can interact with the external interstellar medium and modify the\nevolution of the host galaxy.

At sufficiently\nlarge scales such as the BAO scale, a standard approach for the bias problem on\nthe basis of the perturbation theory (PT) is to assume the `local bias' model\nin which the density field of biased tracers is deterministically expanded in\nterms of matter density field at the same position. The higher-order bias\nparameters are then determined by combining the power spectrum with\nhigher-order statistics such as the bispectrum. As is pointed out by recent\nstudies, however, nonlinear gravitational evolution naturally induces nonlocal\nbias terms even if initially starting only with purely local bias. As a matter\nof fact, previous works showed that the second-order nonlocal bias term, which\ncorresponds to the gravitational tidal field, is important to explain the\ncharacteristic scale-dependence of the bispectrum. In this paper we extend the\nnonlocal bias term up to third order, and investigate whether the PT-based\nmodel including nonlocal bias terms can simultaneously explain the power\nspectrum and the bispectrum of simulated halos in $N$-body simulations. We show\nthat the power spectrum, including density and momentum, and the bispectrum\nbetween halo and matter in $N$-body simulations can be simultaneously well\nexplained by the model including up to third-order nonlocal bias terms up to\nk~0.1h/Mpc. Also, the results seem in a good agreement with theoretical\npredictions of a simple coevolution picture, although the agreement is not\nperfect.

Based on these colors, we derive the\nfollowing mean metallicity Z=0.018+-0.007 for the ICL. The ICL age is 6+-3 Gyr\nyounger than the average age of the most massive galaxies of the cluster.

These stable particles are typically a\nsubdominant DM component, but because they are produced with a large Lorentz\nboost in this process, they can be detected in large volume terrestrial\nexperiments via neutral-current-like interactions with electrons or nuclei.\nThis novel DM signal thus combines the production mechanism associated with\nindirect detection experiments (i.e. galactic DM annihilation) with the\ndetection mechanism associated with direct detection experiments (i.e. DM\nscattering off terrestrial targets). Such processes are generically present in\nmulti-component DM scenarios or those with non-minimal DM stabilization\nsymmetries. As a proof of concept, we present a model of two-component thermal\nrelic DM, where the dominant heavy DM species has no tree-level interactions\nwith the standard model and thus largely evades direct and indirect DM bounds.\nInstead, its thermal relic abundance is set by annihilation into a subdominant\nlighter DM species, and the latter can be detected in the boosted channel via\nthe same annihilation process occurring today.

This is also the case if dark matter can be treated as a\nself-gravitating collisionless gas experiencing Lynden-Bell's type of violent\nrelaxation. In order to avoid the infinite mass problem and carry out a\nrigorous stability analysis, we consider the fermionic King model. In this\npaper, we study the non-degenerate limit leading to the classical King model.\nThis model was initially introduced to describe globular clusters. We propose\nto apply it also to large dark matter halos where quantum effects are\nnegligible. We determine the caloric curve and study the thermodynamical\nstability of the different configurations. Equilibrium states exist only above\na critical energy $E_c$ in the microcanonical ensemble and only above a\ncritical temperature $T_c$ in the canonical ensemble. For $E<E_c$, the system\nundergoes a gravothermal catastrophe and, for $T<T_c$, it undergoes an\nisothermal collapse. We compute the profiles of density, circular velocity, and\nvelocity dispersion.

The simulations are analyzed with a\nLarge Velocity Gradient (LVG) model to compute the local emission in various\nmolecular lines in each resolution element, radiation transfer and opacity\neffects, and the intensity emerging from galaxies, to generate synthetic\nspectra for various transitions of the CO molecule. This model reproduces the\nknown properties of CO spectra and CO-to-H2 conversion factors in nearby\nspirals and starbursting major mergers. The high excitation of CO lines in\nmergers is dominated by an excess of high-density gas, and the high turbulent\nvelocities and compression that create this dense gas excess result in broad\nlinewidths and low CO intensity-to-H2 mass ratios. When applied to\nhigh-redshift gas-rich disks galaxies, the same model predicts that their\nCO-to-H2 conversion factor is almost as high as in nearby spirals, and much\nhigher than in starbursting mergers.

Recent studies have pointed out that extracting\nmerger trees from numerical simulations of structure formation is non-trivial;\ndifferent tree building algorithms can give differing merger histories. These\ndifferences should be carefully understood before merger trees are used as\ninput for models of galaxy formation. We investigate the impact of different\nhalo merger trees on a semi-analytic model. We find that the z=0 galaxy\nproperties in our model show differences between trees when using a common\nparameter set. The star formation history of the Universe and the properties of\nsatellite galaxies can show marked differences between trees with different\nconstruction methods. Independently calibrating the semi-analytic model for\neach tree can reduce the discrepancies between the z=0 global galaxy\nproperties, at the cost of increasing the differences in the evolutionary\nhistories of galaxies. Furthermore, the underlying physics implied can vary,\nresulting in key quantities such as the supernova feedback efficiency differing\nby factors of 2. Such a change alters the regimes where star formation is\nprimarily suppressed by supernovae. Therefore, halo merger trees extracted from\na common halo catalogue using different, but reliable, algorithms can result in\na difference in the semi-analytic model. Given the uncertainties in galaxy\nformation physics, however, these differences may not necessarily be viewed as\nsignificant. \n\n"}

The stream has two\ncomponents: a bridge-like feature extended between NGC 4631 and NGC 4656\n(stream_SE) and an overdensity with extended features on the opposite side of\nthe NGC 4631 disk (stream_NW). Together, these features extend more than 85 kpc\nand display a clear (g-r) colour gradient. The orientation of stream_SE\nrelative to the orientations of NGC 4631 and NGC 4656 is not consistent with an\norigin from interaction between these two spirals, and is more likely debris\nfrom a satellite encounter. The stellar tidal features can be qualitatively\nreproduced in an N-body model of the tidal disruption of a single, massive\ndwarf satellite on a moderately eccentric orbit (e=0.6) around NGC 4631 over\n$\\sim$ 3.5 Gyr, with a dynamical mass ratio (m1:m2) of ~40.

By complementing the IRAS spectral coverage with\nPlanck satellite data from 100 to 857 GHz, we provide new constraints on the IR\nspectrum of thermal dust emission in clusters of galaxies. We achieve this by\nusing a stacking approach for a sample of several hundred objects from the\nPlanck cluster sample; this procedure averages out fluctuations from the IR\nsky, allowing us to reach a significant detection of the faint cluster\ncontribution. We also use the large frequency range probed by Planck, together\nwith component-separation techniques, to remove the contamination from both\ncosmic microwave background anisotropies and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich\neffect (tSZ) signal, which dominate below 353 GHz. By excluding dominant\nspurious signals or systematic effects, averaged detections are reported at\nfrequencies between 353 and 5000 GHz.

We explain how radial metallicity gradients in stellar populations are\ndetermined by three factors: the radial metallicity profile of the star-forming\nISM, radial changes in the star-formation history (in particular inside-out\nformation), and radial mixing of stars. Under reasonable assumptions,\ninside-out formation steepens the negative ISM metallicity gradient, but\ncontributes positively to the stellar metallicity gradient, up to inverting the\nmetallicity profile to a positive d[Fe/H]/dR. This reconciles steep negative\nd[Fe/H]/dR in some high redshift galaxies to generally flatter gradients in\nlocal observations.\n  We discuss the evidence for inverse radial metallicity gradients (positive\nd[X/H]/dR) at high redshifts and the inverse relationship between azimuthal\nvelocity and the metallicity (positive dV_{\\phi}/d[Fe/H]) of stars for the\nMilky Way's thick disc.

These proxies indeed lie on a very tight Fundamental\nPlane (FP).

Here I show that this is indeed the case\nusing a heterogeneous set of 230 black holes. The sample includes BHs from zero\nto 10 billion solar masses and host galaxies ranging from low surface\nbrightness dwarfs, through bulge-less disks, to brightest cluster galaxies.

The excitation may also originate in dense\ngas (>10^5 cm-3) followed by nonreactive collisions. Previous observations\nsuggest that the CH+ and OH correlate with dense and warm gas, and formation\npumping contributes to CH+ excitation. We examine the spatial distribution of\nthe CH+ and OH emission in the Orion Bar to establish their physical origin and\nmain formation and excitation mechanisms. We present spatially sampled maps of\nthe CH+ J=3-2 transition at 119.8 {\\mu}m and the OH {\\Lambda}-doublet at 84\n{\\mu}m in the Orion Bar over an area of 110\"x110\" with Herschel (PACS).

We assess\nthe spatial variation of CH+ J=2-1 velocity-resolved line profile observed with\nHerschel (HIFI). The OH and CH+ lines correlate well with the high-J CO\nemission and delineate the warm and dense molecular region. While similar, the\ndifferences in the CH+ and OH morphologies indicate that CH+ formation and\nexcitation are related to the observed vibrationally excited H2. This indicates\nthat formation pumping contributes to the excitation of CH+. Interestingly, the\npeak of the rotationally excited OH 84 {\\mu}m emission coincides with a bright\nyoung object, proplyd 244-440, which shows that OH can be an excellent tracer\nof UV-irradiated dense gas.

We investigate\nthe rotational evolution of young VLM stars and BDs using Monte Carlo\nsimulations under the hypothesis of disk locking and stellar angular momentum\nconservation. Methods. We built a set of objects with masses ranging from 0.01\nMo to 0.4 Mo and considered models with single- and double- peaked initial\nperiod distributions with and without disk locking. An object is considered to\nbe diskless when its mass accretion rate is below a given threshold. Results.\nModels with initial single-peaked period distributions reproduce the\nobservations well given that BDs rotate faster than VLM stars. We observe a\ncorrelation between rotational period and mass when we relax the disk locking\nhypothesis, but with a shallower slope compared to some observational results.\nThe angular momentum evolution of diskless stars is flatter than it is for\nstars with a disk which occurs because the moment of inertia of objects less\nmassive than 0.2 Mo remains pratically constant for a time scale that increases\nwith decreasing stellar mass.

Strikingly, the\ndynamics of SMBHs differs in the SIDM and reference CDM case.

DG Tau is a low-mass pre-main sequence star, whose strongly\naccreting protoplanetary disk exhibits a so-far enigmatic behavior: its\nmid-infrared thermal emission is strongly time-variable, even turning the 10\n$\\mu$m silicate feature from emission to absorption temporarily. Aims. We look\nfor the reason for the spectral variability at high spatial resolution and at\nmultiple epochs. Methods. We study the temporal variability of the mid-infrared\ninterferometric signal, observed with the VLTI/MIDI instrument at six epochs\nbetween 2011 and 2014. We fit a geometric disk model to the observed\ninterferometric signal to obtain spatial information about the disk. We also\nmodel the mid-infrared spectra by template fitting to characterize the profile\nand time dependence of the silicate emission. We use physically motivated\nradiative transfer modeling to interpret the mid-infrared interferometric\nspectra. Results. The inner disk (r<1-3 au) spectra exhibit a 10 $\\mu$m\nabsorption feature related to amorphous silicate grains. The outer disk (r>1-3\nau) spectra show a crystalline silicate feature in emission, similar to the\nspectra of comet Hale-Bopp. The striking difference between the inner and outer\ndisk spectral feature is highly unusual among T Tauri stars. The mid-infrared\nvariability is dominated by the outer disk. The strength of the silicate\nfeature changed by more than a factor of two.

The moduli space is birational to a cluster\n$\\mathcal{X}$-variety, whose positive real points recover the enhanced\nTeichm\\\"uller space of $S$. Their basis is enumerated by integral laminations\non $S$, which are collections of closed curves in $S$ with integer weights.\nAround ten years later, a quantized version of this basis, still enumerated by\nintegral laminations, was constructed by Allegretti and Kim. For each choice of\nan ideal triangulation of $S$, each quantum basis element is a Laurent\npolynomial in the exponential of quantum shear coordinates for edges of the\ntriangulation, with coefficients being Laurent polynomials in $q$ with integer\ncoefficients. We show that these coefficients are Laurent polynomials in $q$\nwith positive integer coefficients. Our result was expected in a positivity\nconjecture for framed protected spin characters in physics and provides a\nrigorous proof of it, and may also lead to other positivity results, as well as\ncategorification. A key step in our proof is to solve a purely topological and\ncombinatorial ordering problem about an ideal triangulation and a closed curve\non $S$.

Two\npossible parametrizations (three neutrino masses versus the lightest neutrino\nmass plus the two oscillation mass splittings) and priors (linear versus\nlogarithmic) are examined.

They bear astrophysical significance as sources of\nUV and ionizing radiation in older stellar populations and, if sufficiently\nmassive, as stripped supernova progenitors. Binary evolutionary models predict\nthem to be common, but only a handful of subdwarfs (i.e., SESs) with B-type\ncompanions are known. This could be the result of observational biases\nhindering detection, or an incorrect understanding of binary evolution. We\nreanalyze the well-studied post-interaction binary phi Persei. Recently, new\ndata improved the orbital solution of the system, which contains a ~1.2 Msun\nSES and a rapidly rotating ~9.6 Msun Be star. We compare with an extensive grid\nof evolutionary models using a Bayesian approach and find initial masses of the\nprogenitor of 7.2+/-0.4 Msun for the SES and 3.8+/-0.4 Msun for the Be star.\nThe system must have evolved through near-conservative mass transfer. These\nfindings are consistent with earlier studies. The age we obtain, 57+/-9 Myr, is\nin excellent agreement with the age of the alpha Persei cluster. We note that\nneither star was initially massive enough to produce a core-collapse supernova,\nbut mass exchange pushed the Be star above the mass threshold. We find that the\nsubdwarf is overluminous for its mass by almost an order of magnitude, compared\nto the expectations for a helium core burning star. We can only reconcile this\nif the subdwarf is in a late phase of helium shell burning, which lasts only\n2-3% of the total lifetime as a subdwarf. This could imply that up to ~50 less\nevolved, dimmer subdwarfs exist for each system similar to phi Persei. Our\nfindings can be interpreted as a strong indication that a substantial\npopulation of SESs indeed exists, but has so far evaded detection because of\nobservational biases and lack of large-scale systematic searches. \n\n"}

It is caused by an asymmetry between the number densities of left- and\nright-handed fermions, which can be maintained at high energies when the\nchirality flipping rate can be neglected, for example in the early Universe.\nThe inclusion of the CME in the Maxwell equations leads to a modified set of\nMHD equations. We discuss how the CME is implemented in the PENCIL CODE. The\nCME plays a key role in the evolution of magnetic fields since it results in a\ndynamo effect associated with an additional term in the induction equation.\nThis term is formally similar to the $\\alpha$ effect in classical mean-field\nMHD. However, the chiral dynamo can operate without turbulence and is\nassociated with small spatial scales that can be, in the case of the early\nUniverse, orders of magnitude below the Hubble radius. A chiral $\\alpha_\\mu$\neffect has also been identified in mean-field theory. It occurs in the presence\nof turbulence but is not related to kinetic helicity. Depending on the plasma\nparameters, chiral dynamo instabilities can amplify magnetic fields over many\norders of magnitude. These instabilities can affect the propagation of MHD\nwaves, which is demonstrated by our DNS. We also study the coupling between the\nevolution of the chiral chemical potential and the ordinary chemical potential,\nwhich is proportional to the sum of the number densities of left- and\nright-handed fermions. An important consequence of this coupling is the\nemergence of chiral magnetic waves (CMWs). We confirm numerically that linear\nCMWs and MHD waves are not interacting. Our simulations suggest that the\nchemical potential has only a minor effect on the non-linear evolution of the\nchiral dynamo. \n\n"}

Theory Abstract: Wheeler (1964) had formulated Mach's principle as the boundary condition for\ngeneral relativistic field equations.

Then, it is shown that a new\nterm appears in the equation of motion, which leads to a modified Poisson\nequation. In addition, a modified Hubble parameter is derived due to the\npresence of the new term. Moreover, it is proved that, without a cosmological\nconstant, such a model has a late time-accelerated expansion with an equation\nof state converging to $w < -1$. Also, the luminosity distance in the present\nmodel is shown to differ from that of the $\\Lambda CDM$ model at high\nredshifts.

This object was selected as a hyper-luminous\nDOG candidate at z ~ 2 by combining the optical and IR photometric data based\non the SDSS and WISE, although its redshift had not yet been confirmed. Based\non the LIRIS observation, we confirmed its redshift of 2.521 and total IR\nluminosity of log(L_IR/L_sun) = 14.57, which satisfies the criterion for an\nextremely luminous IR galaxy (ELIRG). Moreover, we indicate that this object\nseems to have an extremely massive black hole with M_BH = 10^10.92 M_sun based\non the broad Halpha line: the host stellar mass is derived as M_star = 10^13.55\nM_sun by a fit of the spectral energy distribution.

We write the bias expansion in terms of\nmodified bias operators in Eulerian space, designed such that the large bulk\nflows are automatically resummed and not treated perturbatively. Using these\noperators, the bias model accurately matches the Eulerian density of halos in\nN-body simulations. The mean-square model error is close to the Poisson shot\nnoise for a wide range of halo masses and it is rather scale-independent, with\nscale-dependent corrections becoming relevant at the nonlinear scale. In\ncontrast, for linear bias the mean-square model error can be higher than the\nPoisson prediction by factors of up to a few on large scales, and it becomes\nscale dependent already in the linear regime.

But since most PNe are\nnot spherical, I argue that about 50 percents of AGB stars are spun-up by\nplanets, even planets having a mass as low as 0.01 times the mass of Jupiter,\nso they form elliptical PNe. The rotation by itself will not deform the AGB\nwind, but may trigger another process that will lead to axisymmetric mass loss,\ne.g., weak magnetic activity, as in the cool magnetic spots model. This model\nalso explains the transition from spherical to axisymmetric mass loss on the\nupper AGB. For such low mass planets to substantially spin-up the stellar\nenvelope, they should enter the envelope when the star reaches the upper AGB.\nThis \"fine-tuning\" can be avoided if there are several planets on average\naround each star, as is the case in the solar system, so that one of them is\nengulfed when the star reaches the upper AGB. \n\n"}

For the next-to-leading order the errors are within a few percent.\nThe errors increase with $|n_S - 1|$. To obtain a precision of 1% it is\nnecessary, but in general not sufficient, to use the next-to-leading order. In\nthe case of power-law inflation this precision is obtained for the spectral\nindices if $|n_S - 1| < 0.02$ and for the quadrupoles if $|n_S - 1| < 0.15$\nonly. The errors in the higher multipoles are even larger than those for the\nquadrupole, e.g. $\\approx 15%$ for l=100, with $n_S = 0.9$ at the\nnext-to-leading order. We find that the accuracy of the slow-roll approximation\nmay be improved by shifting the pivot scale of the primordial spectrum (the\nscale at which the slow-roll parameters are fixed) into the regime of acoustic\noscillations.

A frequently considered alternative is provided by the\ntelegraph equation, whose solutions avoid superluminal propagation speeds but\nsuffer from singular (non-continuous) diffusion fronts on the light cone, which\nare unlikely to exist for massive particles.

We find that the\nstandard knot observables (i.e. traces of holonomies along knots) essentially\nvanish, but yet, the non-semi-simplicity of our gauge group allows us to\nconsider a class of un-orthodox observables which breaks gauge invariance at\none point and which lead to a non-trivial theory on long knots in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$.

There might be other interesting non\nsemi-simple gauge groups to study in this context beyond our example. 2. In our\ncase of an inhomogeneous gauge group, we find that Chern-Simons theory with the\nun-orthodox observable is actually the same as 3D BF theory with the\nCattaneo-Cotta-Ramusino-Martellini knot observable.

The exception that they\nmention is the case in which V is symmetric, which leads to V-Cat being\nsymmetric as well. The symmetry in V-Cat is based upon the symmetry of V. The\nmotivation behind this paper is in part to describe how these facts relating V\nand V-Cat are in turn related to a categorical analogue of topological\ndelooping. To do so I need to pass to a more general setting than braided and\nsymmetric categories -- in fact the k-fold monoidal categories of Balteanu et\nal in [Iterated Monoidal Categories, Adv. Math. 176(2003) 277-349]. It seems\nthat the analogy of loop spaces is a good guide for how to define the concept\nof enrichment over various types of monoidal objects, including k-fold monoidal\ncategories and their higher dimensional counterparts.
