Dynamical equations\nfor the probability distributions governing tablet orientations are introduced\nwhose form can be determined from symmetry considerations and for which\nsubstantial analytic progress can be made. Numerical simulations are performed\nto relate the parameters used in the analytic theory to those in the\nmicroscopic growth model. The analytic theory demonstrates that the dynamical\nmechanism is able to achieve a much higher degree of order than naive estimates\nwould indicate. \n\n"}

The bonding of graphene to Al, Ag, Cu, Au and\nPt(111) surfaces is so weak that its unique \"ultrarelativistic\" electronic\nstructure is preserved. The interaction does, however, lead to a charge\ntransfer that shifts the Fermi level by up to 0.5 eV with respect to the\nconical points. The crossover from p-type to n-type doping occurs for a metal\nwith a work function ~5.4 eV, a value much larger than the work function of\nfree-standing graphene, 4.5 eV. We develop a simple analytical model that\ndescribes the Fermi level shift in graphene in terms of the metal substrate\nwork function.

An elastic, crystalline\nsubstrate contacts a rigid, atomically flat surface or a spherical tip. The\nrigid surface is formed from a commensurate or incommensurate crystal or an\namorphous solid. Spherical tips are made by bending crystalline planes or\nremoving material outside a sphere. In continuum theory the fraction of\natomically flat surfaces that is in contact rises sharply from zero to unity\nwhen a load is applied. This simple behavior is surprisingly difficult to\nreproduce with atomic scale definitions of contact. Due to thermal\nfluctuations, the number of atoms making contact at any instant rises linearly\nwith load over a wide range of loads. Pressures comparable to the ideal\nhardness are needed to achieve full contact at typical temperatures. A simple\nharmonic mean-field theory provides a quantitative description of this behavior\nand explains why the instantaneous forces on atoms have a universal exponential\nform.

This is obtained, in\nDrude formula, by replacing the electron density with the number density of\natoms n(atom), and the electron effective mass with true electron mass\nmultiplied by G. Here the relaxation time is assumed to be (h/2pi)/(kT) for all\nmetals (h is the Planck constant and k is the Boltzmann constant). The single\nfree parameter G is summed electron numbers in each atomic shell, e.g. G=5+1=6\nfor chromium(five 3d electrons and one 4s electron).

It was found that the hole becomes\nde-localized in the case of amorphous materials, which leads to stronger\nconfinement effects. The origin of this result was partly attributed to\ndifferences in the effective mass between the amorphous and crystalline NS as\nwell as between the electron and hole. Corrections to our QC model take into\naccount a position dependent effective mass. This term includes an inverse\nlength scale dependent on the displacement from the origin. Thus, when the\ndeBroglie wavelength or the Bohr radius of the carriers is on the order of the\ndimension of the NS the carriers `feel' the confinement potential altering\ntheir effective mass. Furthermore, it was found that certain interface states\n(Si-O-Si) act to pin the hole state, thus reducing the oscillator strength. \n\n"}

By a systematic analysis of\nmagnetic point groups, we show that the ME sum rule is applicable to a broad\nvariety of non-centrosymmetric magnets including ME multiferroic compounds. Due\nto the dynamical ME effect, the optical excitations in these materials can\nexhibit directional dichroism, i.e. the absorption coefficient can be different\nfor counter-propagating light beams. According to the ME sum rule, the\nmagnitude of the linear ME effect of a material is mainly determined by the\ndirectional dichroism of its low-energy optical excitations.

Such features are generally described in terms of multi-dimensional\nquadratic expansions and corresponding definitions of effective masses.\nMulti-dimensional expansions, however, are permissible only under strict\nconditions that are typically violated by degenerate bands and even some\nnon-degenerate bands. Suggestive terms such as \"band warping\" or \"corrugated\nenergy surfaces\" have been used to refer to such situations and ad hoc methods\nhave been developed to treat them. While numerical calculations may reflect\nsuch features, a complete theory of band warping has not been developed. We\ndevelop a generally applicable theory, based on radial expansions, and a\ncorresponding definition of angular effective mass. Our theory also accounts\nfor effects of band non-parabolicity and anisotropy, which hitherto have not\nbeen precisely distinguished from, if not utterly confused with, band warping.\nBased on our theory, we develop precise procedures to evaluate band warping\nquantitatively.

These can be evaluated using the vibrational density of\nstates (DOS) as input, where the boson peak plays a prominent role for the\nmechanics. To compare with experimental data of binary ZrCu alloys, numerical\nDOS was obtained from simulations of this system, which take also electronic\ndegrees of freedom into account via the embedded atom method (EAM) for the\ninteratomic potential. It is shown that the viscoelastic $\\alpha$-relaxation,\nincluding the $\\alpha$-wing asymmetry in the loss modulus, can be very well\ndescribed by the theory if the memory kernel (the non-Markovian friction) in\nthe GLE is taken to be a stretched-exponential decaying function of time. This\nfinding directly implies strong memory effects in the atomic-scale dynamics,\nand suggests that the $\\alpha$-relaxation time is related to the characteristic\ntime-scale over which atoms retain memory of their previous collision history.\nThis memory time grows dramatically below the glass transition. \n\n"}

Maxwell lattices are mechanical structures\ncontaining equal numbers of degrees of freedom and constraints in the bulk and\nare thus on the verge of mechanical instability. Recent progress in topological\nmechanics led to the discovery of topologically protected floppy modes and\nstates of self stress at edges and domain walls of Maxwell lattices. When\nnormal brittle materials are being stretched, stress focuses on crack tips,\nleading to catastrophic failure. In contrast, we find that when topological\nMaxwell lattices are being stretched, stress focuses on states of self stress\ndomain walls instead, and bond-breaking events start at these domain walls,\neven in presence of cracks.

In lattice systems it is not so clear how\nto do this, because there is no continuous translation symmetry, and hence\nthere are no momenta. Moreover, when time is also discrete, as in quantum walk\nsystems, there is no Hamiltonian, only a unitary step operator.

To further advance this promising field, it is of great\ninterest to predict the optical response of recently discovered and\nyet-to-be-synthesized polaritonic materials alike. Here we develop a unified\nframework based on quantum linear response theory to calculate the spatially\nnon-local dielectric function of a polar lattice in arbitrary dimensions. In\nthe case of a three-dimensional bulk material, the spatially local limit of our\ncalculation reproduces standard results for the dielectric response of a polar\nlattice.

In this system the kinetic energy of the low-energy electrons\nis much reduced and consequently interactions become very relevant, providing a\nnew platform into the physics of two-dimensional correlated materials. Evidence\nof a proposed Mott insulating as well as superconducting state in these highly\ntunable systems has spurred much attention as they could pave the way to\nunderstanding long-standing questions of high-$T_c$ superconductivity or\nprovide candidate systems for topological chiral superconductors; key to highly\nrelevant quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate that twisted bilayer boron\nnitride (TBBN) is an exciting and even richer alternative to twisted bilayer\ngraphene (TBG). Crucially, we show that in TBBN multiple flat bands emerge\nwithout having to fine tuning close to a \"magic angle\" that upon doping lead to\ncorrelated phases of matter (insulating and superconducting). TBBN could thus\nbe much less sensitive to small deviations in the twist angle and therefore\nprovide a particularly suited experimental platform to study correlation\nphysics in two dimensions.

But, the atomic displacements determined from diffuse scattering\nintensities do not fulfill this condition. To resolve this contradiction, we\npropose a simple model in which the total atomic displacement consists of two\ncomponents: $\\delta_{CM}$ is created by the soft mode condensation, satisfying\nthe center of mass condition, and, $\\delta_{shift}$ represents a uniform\ndisplacement of the PNR along their polar direction relative to the surrounding\n(unpolarized) cubic matrix. Within this framework, we can successfully describe\nthe neutron diffuse scattering intensities observed in PMN. \n\n"}

For packings with weak disorder, the mean forces\npropagate primarily along lattice directions. The width of the response along\nthese preferred directions grows with depth, increasingly so as the disorder of\nthe system grows. Also, as the disorder increases, the two propagation\ndirections of the mean force merge into a single direction. The response\nfunction for the mean force in the most strongly disordered system is\nquantitatively consistent with an elastic description for forces applied nearly\nnormally to a surface.

By using a method based on a transfer of population\nby adiabatic passage allowing to prepare cold atomic samples with a well\ndefined ratio of atomic density as well as atom number the collisional shift is\ncontrolled at the 10E-3 of its value. A calibration of Zeeman sub-states\ncontribution to the clock shift as a function of the field has been performed.\nFeshbach resonances have been observed for the first time at very low magnetic\nfield and with a very good resolution. A Monte Carlo simulation has been\nperformed and could fit properly some of experimental data. This constrains\nsome parameters of the theory of collisions. \n\n"}

A local and\nlinear constitutive law between excitations and field strengths is assumed,\nwith a constitutive tensor $\\chi^{ijkl}=-\\chi^{jikl}=-\\chi^{ijlk}$ of 36\ncomponents. The properties of this tensor are discussed. In particular, we\naddress the validity of the Post constraint, a subject that is very much under\ndiscussion.

{"id": "physics/0701039", "contents": "Title: Optimization of quantum Monte Carlo wave functions by energy\n  minimization Abstract: We study three wave function optimization methods based on energy\nminimization in a variational Monte Carlo framework: the Newton, linear and\nperturbative methods. In the Newton method, the parameter variations are\ncalculated from the energy gradient and Hessian, using a reduced variance\nstatistical estimator for the latter. In the linear method, the parameter\nvariations are found by diagonalizing a non-symmetric estimator of the\nHamiltonian matrix in the space spanned by the wave function and its\nderivatives with respect to the parameters, making use of a strong\nzero-variance principle. In the less computationally expensive perturbative\nmethod, the parameter variations are calculated by approximately solving the\ngeneralized eigenvalue equation of the linear method by a nonorthogonal\nperturbation theory. These general methods are illustrated here by the\noptimization of wave functions consisting of a Jastrow factor multiplied by an\nexpansion in configuration state functions (CSFs) for the C$_2$ molecule,\nincluding both valence and core electrons in the calculation. The Newton and\nlinear methods are very efficient for the optimization of the Jastrow, CSF and\norbital parameters. The perturbative method is a good alternative for the\noptimization of just the CSF and orbital parameters. Although the optimization\nis performed at the variational Monte Carlo level, we observe for the C$_2$\nmolecule studied here, and for other systems we have studied, that as more\nparameters in the trial wave functions are optimized, the diffusion Monte Carlo\ntotal energy improves monotonically, implying that the nodal hypersurface also\nimproves monotonically. \n\n"}

We\nidentify resource states that are radically different from the cluster state,\nin that they exhibit non-vanishing correlation functions, can partly be\nprepared using gates with non-maximal entangling power, or have very different\nlocal entanglement properties. In the computational models, the randomness is\ncompensated in a different manner. It is shown that there exist resource states\nwhich are locally arbitrarily close to a pure state. Finally, we comment on the\npossibility of tailoring computational models to specific physical systems as,\ne.g. cold atoms in optical lattices. \n\n"}
