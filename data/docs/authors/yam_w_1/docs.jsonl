The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance.

They\nprovide insight in the structural evolution of star clusters, as well as into\nthe occurrence of stellar exotica. Although the major pure N-body codes\nSTARLAB/KIRA and NBODY4 are widely used for a range of applications, there is\nno thorough comparison study yet. Here we thoroughly compare basic quantities\nas derived from simulations performed either with STARLAB/KIRA or NBODY4.\n  We construct a large number of star cluster models for various stellar mass\nfunction settings (but without stellar/binary evolution, primordial binaries,\nexternal tidal fields etc), evolve them in parallel with STARLAB/KIRA and\nNBODY4, analyse them in a consistent way and compare the averaged results\nquantitatively. For this quantitative comparison we develop a bootstrap\nalgorithm for functional dependencies.\n  We find an overall excellent agreement between the codes, both for the\nclusters' structural and energy parameters as well as for the properties of the\ndynamically created binaries. However, we identify small differences, like in\nthe energy conservation before core collapse and the energies of escaping\nstars, which deserve further studies. Our results reassure the comparability\nand the possibility to combine results from these two major N-body codes, at\nleast for the purely dynamical models (i.e. without stellar/binary evolution)\nwe performed.

The relevant phases are prompt and steady-state convection, the\nstanding accretion shock instability (SASI), and asymmetric explosions. For the\nstages before explosion, we propose a model for the source of GW emission.\nDowndrafts of the postshock-convection/SASI region strike the protoneutron star\n\"surface\" with large speeds and are decelerated by buoyancy forces. We find\nthat the GW amplitude is set by the magnitude of deceleration and, by\nextension, the downdraft's speed and the vigor of postshock-convective/SASI\nmotions. However, the characteristic frequencies, which evolve from ~100 Hz\nafter bounce to ~300-400 Hz, are primarily independent of these speeds, but are\nset by the deceleration timescale, which is in turn set by the buoyancy\nfrequency at the lower boundary of postshock convection.

{"id": "0909.3328", "contents": "Title: Fundamental Theoretical Bias in Gravitational Wave Astrophysics and the\n  Parameterized Post-Einsteinian Framework Abstract: We consider the concept of fundamental bias in gravitational wave\nastrophysics as the assumption that general relativity is the correct theory of\ngravity during the entire wave-generation and propagation regime. Such an\nassumption is valid in the weak field, as verified by precision experiments and\nobservations, but it need not hold in the dynamical strong-field regime where\ntests are lacking. Fundamental bias can cause systematic errors in the\ndetection and parameter estimation of signals, which can lead to a\nmischaracterization of the universe through incorrect inferences about source\nevent rates and populations. We propose a remedy through the introduction of\nthe parameterized post-Einsteinian framework, which consists of the enhancement\nof waveform templates via the inclusion of post-Einsteinian parameters. These\nparameters would ostensibly be designed to interpolate between templates\nconstructed in general relativity and well-motivated alternative theories of\ngravity, and also include extrapolations that follow sound theoretical\nprinciples, such as consistency with conservation laws and symmetries. As an\nexample, we construct parameterized post-Einsteinian templates for the binary\ncoalescence of equal-mass, non-spinning compact objects in a quasi-circular\ninspiral. The parametrized post-Einsteinian framework should allow matched\nfiltered data to select a specific set of post-Einsteinian parameters without a\npriori assuming the validity of the former, thus either verifying general\nrelativity or pointing to possible dynamical strong-field deviations. \n\n"}

The former optical medium is deduced from the stereographic projection of\na virtual sphere and displays a heterogeneous refractive index n(r) which is\nproportional to the inverse of 1+r^2.

Previous\nwork has shown that rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized proto-neutron stars\n(`millisecond proto-magnetars') produce outflows with energies, timescales, and\nmagnetizations sigma_0 (maximum Lorentz factor) that are consistent with those\nrequired to produce long GRBs. Here we extend this work in order to construct a\nself-consistent model that directly connects the properties of the central\nengine to the observed prompt emission. Just after the launch of the supernova\nshock, a wind heated by neutrinos is driven from the proto-magnetar. The\noutflow is collimated into a bipolar jet by its interaction with the star. As\nthe magnetar cools, the wind becomes ultra-relativistic and Poynting-flux\ndominated (sigma_0 >> 1) on a timescale comparable to that required for the jet\nto clear a cavity through the star. Although the site and mechanism of the\nprompt emission are debated, we calculate the emission predicted by two models:\nmagnetic dissipation and internal shocks. Our results favor the magnetic\ndissipation model in part because it predicts a relatively constant `Band'\nspectral peak energy E_peak with time during the GRB. The jet baryon loading\ndecreases abruptly when the neutron star becomes transparent to neutrinos at t\n~ 10-100 seconds. Jets with ultra-high magnetization cannot effectively\naccelerate and dissipate their energy, suggesting this transition ends the\nprompt emission and may explain the steep decay phase that follows.

This unique\nconfiguration allows measurements of spin orientation for both pulsars: pulsar\nA's spin is tilted from the orbital angular momentum by no more than 14 degrees\nat 95% confidence; pulsar B's by 130 +/- 1 degrees at 99.7% confidence. This\nspin-spin misalignment requires that the origin of most of B's present-day spin\nis connected to the supernova that formed pulsar B. Under the simplified\nassumption of a single, instantaneous kick during the supernova, the spin could\nbe thought of as originating from the off-center nature of the kick, causing\npulsar B to tumble to its misaligned state. With this assumption, and using\ncurrent constraints on the kick magnitude, we find that pulsar B's\ninstantaneous kick must have been displaced from the center of mass of the\nexploding star by at least 1 km and probably 5--10 km.

We compare the impact of both the magnetic field\nand the wind anisotropy to the benchmark case of a purely hydrodynamical (HD)\ninteraction of isotropic winds, which has been studied in detail by Bogovalov\net al. (2008). We consider the interaction in axisymmetric approximation, i.e.\nthe pulsar rotation axis is assumed to be oriented along the line between the\npulsar and the optical star and the effects related to the pulsar orbiting are\nneglected. The impact of the magnetic field is studied for the case of weak\nmagnetization (with magnetization parameter $\\sigma<0.1$), which is consistent\nwith conventional models of pulsar winds. The effects related to anisotropy in\npulsar winds are modeled assuming that the kinetic energy flux in a\nnon-magnetized pulsar wind is strongly anisotropic, with the minimum at the\npulsar rotation axis and the maximum in the perpendicular direction. We show\nthat, although both considered effects change the shape of the region occupied\nby the terminated pulsar wind, their impact appears to be small. In particular,\nfor the magnetization of the pulsar wind below 0.1, the magnetic field pressure\nremains well below the plasma pressure in the post-shock region.

They\nare the most luminous objects detected so far within ~ 100 Mpc, the horizon\ndistance of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), so they are considered to\nbe candidate sources of UHECRs. It was recently argued that the energy\nproduction rate in UHECRs is much larger than that in gamma-ray photons of long\nGRBs measured by the Fermi satellite, which, if true, would challenge the view\nthat GRBs can be the sources of UHECRs.

Neutron Stars Abstract: A moderately spinning neutron star acquires an oblate shape and a spacetime\nwith a significant quadrupole moment. These two properties affect its apparent\nsurface area for an observer at infinity, as well as the lightcurve arising\nfrom a hot spot on its surface. In this paper, we develop a ray-tracing\nalgorithm to calculate the apparent surface areas of moderately spinning\nneutron stars making use of the Hartle-Thorne metric. This analytic metric\nallows us to calculate various observables of the neutron star in a way that\ndepends only on its macroscopic properties and not on the details of its\nequation of state. We use this algorithm to calculate the changes in the\napparent surface area, which could play a role in measurements of neutron star\nradii and, therefore, in constraining their equation of state. We show that\nwhether the spinning neutron star appears larger or smaller than its\nnon-rotating counterpart depends primarily on its equatorial radius. For\nneutron stars with radii ~10 km, the corrections to the Schwarzschild spacetime\ncause the apparent surface area to increase with spin frequency. In contrast,\nfor neutron stars with radii ~15 km, the oblateness of the star dominates the\nspacetime corrections and causes the apparent surface area to decrease with\nincreasing spin frequency. In all cases, the change in the apparent geometric\nsurface area for the range of observed spin frequencies is < 5% and hence only\na small source of error in the measurement of neutron star radii. \n\n"}

Abstract: Recently, tentative evidence for an excess of gamma rays at energies around\n130 GeV has been reported from analyses of data from the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (LAT). The excess is potentially of great interest, as it could be\nassociated with the pair-annihilation of Galactic dark matter and the\nsubsequent production of monochromatic or internal bremsstrahlung gamma rays.\nThe 130 GeV excess appears when an optimized selection of the target region of\ninterest is employed, a procedure that depends upon the assumed dark matter\ndensity profile. For the profiles producing an appreciable signal, these target\nregions vastly overlap with the region corresponding to the so-called \"Fermi\nbubbles\". We argue that the tentative evidence for a line feature is likely due\nto hard photons in the Fermi bubbles regions, where the gamma-ray spectrum\ncontains a spectral break in the energy range of interest (100-150 GeV).\nAlthough the origin of this broken power-law is unclear, it is probably related\nto standard astrophysical processes and not to dark matter annihilation. A\nbroken power-law provides as good a fit as a line \"excess\", even within small\nenergy windows, and a significantly better fit for large energy windows. \n\n"}

For the stellar core collapse simulation, we present the\nlatest numerical results. We employed a purely nucleonic EOS (Shen-EOS). As an\ninitial condition, we adopted a 100 $M_{\\odot}$ presupernova model calculated\nby Umeda and Nomoto. Changing the degree of rotation for the initial condition,\nwe clarify the strong dependence of the outcome of the collapse on this. When\nthe rotation is rapid enough, the shock wave formed at the core bounce is\ndeformed to be a torus-like shape. Then, the infalling matter is accumulated in\nthe central region due to the oblique shock at the torus surface, hitting the\nPNS and dissipating the kinetic energy there. As a result, outflows can be\nlaunched. The PNS eventually collapses to a BH and an accretion torus is formed\naround it. We also found that the evolution of the BH and torus depends\nstrongly on the rotation initially given.

The situation however changed dramatically in the\npresence of magnetic field produced by the accretion disk surrounding the hole\nin the equatorial plane. In 1985, Wagh, Dhurandhar and Dadhich had for the\nfirst time considered the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) in which the magnetic\nfield could now provide the energy required for a fragment to ride on negative\nenergy orbit thereby overcoming the stringent velocity constraint of the\noriginal PP. Thus MPP turned very efficient and so much so that efficiency\ncould now even exceed 100 percent. They had in principle established revival of\nPP for astrophysical applications in powering the high energy sources. MPP is\nhowever similar to the earlier discovered and well known Blandford-Znajeck (BZ)\nmechanism in which the rotational energy of the hole is extracted out through a\npurely electromagnetic process. Though both the processes use magnetic field as\na device to extract rotational energy from the hole, yet their kernel is quite\ndifferent in spirit. For the former magnetic field provides the threshold\nenergy for particle to get onto negative energy orbit so that the other\nfragment goes out with enhanced energy while for the latter it generates an\nelectric potential difference between the equatorial plane and the polar\nregion, and it is the discharge of which that drives the energy flux out of the\nhole. In other words, MPP is still rooted in the spacetime geometry while BZ is\nessentially driven by electromagnetic interaction. \n\n"}

Several mysteries cloud the interpretation\nof this event: (1) extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray\nlight curve during the first 10 days after the gamma-ray trigger; (2)\nunexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission months after\ntrigger; (3) no obvious evidence for jet precession, despite misalignment\ntypically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disk and BH;\n(4) recent abrupt shut-off in jet X-ray emission after 1.5 years. Here we show\nthat all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one\nassumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Phi threading the BH.\nInitially, Phi is weak relative to high fall-back mass accretion rate, Mdot,\nand the disk and jets precess about the BH axis = our line of sight. As Mdot\ndrops, Phi becomes dynamically important and leads to a magnetically-arrested\ndisk (MAD). MAD naturally aligns disk and jet axis along the BH spin axis, but\nonly after a violent rearrangement phase (jet wobbling). This explains the\nerratic light curve at early times and the lack of precession at later times.\nWe use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain BH and disrupted star\nproperties, finding that a solar-mass main sequence star disrupted by a\nrelatively low mass, M~10^5-10^6 Msun, BH is consistent with the data, while a\nWD disruption (though still possible) is disfavored.

For instance, in the\npresence of an accretion disk, they may be filled by the accreting gas, forming\na ring structure that might remind the rings of Saturn.

The behavior of both\nthe spacetime (and thus the emitted gravitational waves) and the neutron star\nmatter in a BHNS merger depend strongly and nonlinearly on the black hole's\nspin. While there is a significant possibility that astrophysical black holes\ncould have spins that are nearly extremal (i.e. near the theoretical maximum),\nto date fully relativistic simulations of BHNS binaries have included\nblack-hole spins only up to $S/M^2$=0.9, which corresponds to the black hole\nhaving approximately half as much rotational energy as possible, given the\nblack hole's mass.

In\nprinciple, all of these quantities depend on the neutron star's internal\nstructure, and thus, on unknown nuclear physics at supra-nuclear energy\ndensities. We here find relations between the moment of inertia, the Love\nnumbers and the quadrupole moment (I-Love-Q relations) that do not depend\nsensitively on the neutron star's internal structure. Three important\nconsequences derive from these I-Love-Q relations. On an observational\nastrophysics front, the measurement of a single member of the I-Love-Q trio\nwould automatically provide information about the other two, even when the\nlatter may not be observationally accessible.

To this\nend, we derive an accretion-modified relaxation time by adapting Spitzer's\ntwo-component model to include the damping effects of accretion. We consider\nseveral different mass-dependencies and efficiency factors for the accretion\nrate, as well as different mass ratios for the two components of the model.\n  The net effect of accretion is to accelerate mass segregation by increasing\nthe average mass $\\bar{m}$, since the relaxation time is inversely proportional\nto $\\bar{m}$. Under the assumption that the accretion rate increases with the\naccretor mass, there are two additional effects that accelerate mass\nsegregation. First, accretion acts to increase the range of any initial mass\nspectrum, quickly driving the heaviest members to even higher masses. Second,\naccretion acts to reduce the velocities of the accretors due to conservation of\nmomentum, and it is the heaviest members that are affected the most. Using our\ntwo-component model, we quantify these effects as a function of the accretion\nrate, the total cluster mass, and the component masses. We conclude by\ndiscussing the implications of our results for the dynamical evolution of\nprimordial globular clusters, primarily in the context of black holes formed\nfrom the most massive stellar progenitors. \n\n"}

Among\npossible EM emission from the NS merger, emission powered by radioactive\nr-process nuclei is one of the best targets for follow-up observations.\nHowever, prediction so far does not take into account detailed r-process\nelement abundances in the ejecta.

We show that the opacity in the NS merger ejecta is about kappa =\n10 cm^2 g^{-1}, which is higher than that of Fe-rich Type Ia supernova ejecta\nby a factor of ~ 100. As a result, the emission is fainter and longer than\npreviously expected. The spectra are almost featureless due to the high\nexpansion velocity and bound-bound transitions of many different r-process\nelements.

More notably, we find that the\ndetermining factor for producing either black widows or redbacks is the\nefficiency of the irradiation process, such that the redbacks absorb a larger\nfraction of the emitted spin-down energy of the radio pulsar (resulting in more\nefficient mass loss via evaporation) compared to that of the black widow\nsystems. We argue that geometric effects (beaming) is responsible for the\nstrong bimodality of these two populations. Finally, we conclude that redback\nsystems do not evolve into black widow systems with time. \n\n"}

After making the appropriate\nmodifications, accurate initial guesses for the spectral parameters are no\nlonger needed so Monte-Carlo techniques can now be used to ensure the best fit\nto the observables. ii) The method is extended here to use masses and tidal\ndeformabilities (which will be measured by gravitational wave observations of\nneutron-star mergers) as the macroscopic observables instead of masses and\nradii.

This vulnerability to line\nartifacts arises because the F-statistic compares the signal hypothesis to a\nGaussian-noise hypothesis, and hence is triggered by anything that resembles\nthe signal hypothesis more than Gaussian noise. Various ad-hoc veto methods to\ndeal with such line artifacts have been proposed and used in the past. Here we\ndevelop a Bayesian framework that includes an explicit alternative hypothesis\nto model disturbed data. We introduce a simple line model that defines lines as\nsignal candidates appearing only in one detector. This allows us to explicitly\ncompute the odds between the signal hypothesis and an extended noise\nhypothesis, resulting in a new detection statistic that is more robust to\ninstrumental artifacts. We present and discuss results from Monte-Carlo tests\non both simulated data and on detector data from the fifth LIGO science run. We\nfind that the line-robust statistic retains the detection power of the standard\nF-statistic in Gaussian noise. In the presence of line artifacts it is more\nsensitive, even compared to the popular F-statistic consistency veto, over\nwhich it improves by as much as a factor of two in detectable signal strength. \n\n"}

In this paper, we study these universal relations in the\nEddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity. This theory differs from general\nrelativity (GR) significantly only at high densities due to the nonlinear\ncoupling between matter and gravity.

Pion decay via\nproton-proton collisions is a possible mechanism to supply a secondary positron\npopulation with a low energy limit. We expect that pion production would occur\nin advection dominated accretion flows or ADAFs.

Abstract: Starting from the Oppenheimer-Snyder model, we know how in classical general\nrelativity the gravitational collapse of matter form a black hole with a\ncentral spacetime singularity. It is widely believed that the singularity must\nbe removed by quantum gravity effects. Some static quantum-inspired\nsingularity-free black hole solutions have been proposed in the literature, but\nwhen one considers simple examples of gravitational collapse the classical\nsingularity is replaced by a bounce, after which the collapsing matter expands\nfor ever. We may expect 3 possible explanations: $i)$ the static regular black\nhole solutions are not physical, in the sense that they cannot be realized in\nNature, $ii)$ the final product of the collapse is not unique, but it depends\non the initial conditions, or $iii)$ boundary effects play an important role\nand our simple models miss important physics. In the latter case, after proper\nadjustment, the bouncing solution would approach the static one. We argue that\nthe \"correct answer\" may be related to the appearance of a ghost state in de\nSitter spacetimes with super Planckian mass.

Inflections in the cumulative distribution\nnear 6 d, 14, d, and 45 d, suggest key physical scales of ~0.2, ~0.4, and ~1\nA.U. where yet-to-be-identified phenomena create distinct features. No single\npower law provides a statistically compelling prescription, but if features are\nignored, a power law with exponent beta = -0.22 provides a crude approximation\nover P=1.4 -- 2000 d, as does a piece-wise linear function with a break near 45\nd. The cumulative period distribution flattens at P > 45 d, even after\ncorrection for completeness, indicating either a lower binary fraction or a\nshift toward low-mass companions. A high degree of similarity (91% likelihood)\nbetween the Cyg OB2 period distribution and that of other surveys suggests that\nthe binary properties at P<25 d are determined by local physics of disk/clump\nfragmentation and are relatively insensitive to environmental and evolutionary\nfactors.

{"id": "1406.7431", "contents": "Title: Luminous Blue Variables are Antisocial: Their Isolation Implies that\n  they are Kicked Mass Gainers in Binary Evolution Abstract: Based on their relatively isolated environments, we argue that LBVs must be\nprimarily the product of binary evolution, challenging the traditional\nsingle-star view wherein LBVs mark a brief transition between massive O stars\nand Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. If the latter were true, then LBVs should be\nconcentrated in young clusters and found alongside main-sequence stars with\nsimilarly high inferred initial mass. This is decidedly not the case. Examining\nlocations of LBVs compared to O stars in our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds\nreveals that LBVs systematically avoid clusters of O stars, and many reside\nover 100 pc from any O star. In the LMC, LBVs are statistically much more\nisolated than O-type stars, and (perhaps most surprisingly) even more isolated\nthan most WR stars. This makes it impossible for LBVs to be massive stars in\ntransition to WR stars. Instead, we propose that massive stars and supernova\n(SN) subtypes are dominated by bifurcated evolutionary paths in interacting\nbinaries, wherein most WR stars and SNeIbc correspond to the mass donors, while\nLBVs (and their lower-mass analogs like B[e] supergiants, which we show to be\neven more isolated) are the mass gainers. LBVs are essentially the late\nevolutionary stage of massive blue stragglers. Through binary mass transfer,\nrejuvinated mass gainers get enriched, spun up, and sometimes kicked far from\ntheir clustered birthsites by their companion's SN. This scenario agrees better\nwith LBVs exploding as SNeIIn and the observed isolation of SNe~IIn and SN\nimpostors. We argue that environmental trends of various SN subtypes are\ninfluenced more by binarity and SN kicks, rather than tracing initial mass as\nis generally assumed. Mergers or Thorne-Zykow objects might also give rise to\nLBVs, but these scenarios may have a harder time explaining why LBVs avoid\nclusters. \n\n"}

We find that the hysteresis patterns between\nCompton dominated and thermal dominated states, typically observed in black\nhole LMXBs, are also common in neutron star systems. These patterns, which also\nsample intermediate states, are found when looking at the evolution of both\nX-ray colour and fast variability of ten systems accreting below ~ 30 % of the\nEddington Luminosity. We show that hysteresis does not require large changes in\nluminosity and it is the natural form that state transitions take at these\nluminosities. At higher accretion rates neutron stars do not show hysteresis,\nand they remain in a thermal dominated, low variability state, characterized by\nflaring behaviour and fast colour changes. Only at luminosities close to the\nEddington Luminosity, are high variability levels seen again, in correspondence\nto an increase in the fractional contribution of the Comptonization component.\nWe compare this behaviour with that observed in LMXBs harbouring black holes,\nshowing that the spectral, timing and multi-wavelength properties of a given\nsource can be determined by its location in the fast variability-luminosity\ndiagram, which, therefore, provides a common framework for neutron star and\nblack hole accretion states. \n\n"}

How the mechanism producing EM emission is related to any continuous\ngravitational-wave (CW) emission is unknown; if they either interact or are\nlocked in phase then the CW will also experience timing noise. Any disparity\nbetween the signal and the search template used in matched filtering methods\nwill result in a loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), referred to as\n`mismatch'.

This critical\n(`stationary') mirror radius marks the boundary between stable and unstable\nblack-hole-mirror-field configurations: composed systems whose confining mirror\nis situated in the region $r_{\\text{m}}<r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$ are stable\n(that is, all modes of the confined field decay in time), whereas composed\nsystems whose confining mirror is situated in the region\n$r_{\\text{m}}>r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$ are unstable (that is, there are\nconfined field modes which grow exponentially over time). In the present paper\nwe explore this critical (marginally-stable) boundary between stable and\nexplosive black-hole-mirror-field configurations. It is shown that the\ninnermost ({\\it smallest}) radius of the confining mirror which allows the\nextraction of rotational energy from a spinning Kerr black hole approaches the\nblack-hole horizon radius in the extremal limit of rapidly-rotating black\nholes. We find, in particular, that this critical mirror radius (which marks\nthe onset of superradiant instabilities in the composed system) scales linearly\nwith the black-hole temperature. \n\n"}

Shocks\nnear the stellar pericenter and also near the apocenter of the most\ntightly-bound debris dissipate orbital energy, but only enough to make the\ncharacteristic radius comparable to the semi-major axis of the most-bound\nmaterial, not the tidal radius as previously thought.

The main reason is that many of the NS in these systems appear to be\nspinning well below their Keplerian breakup frequency, and it has been\nsuggested that torques associated with GW emission may be setting the observed\nspin period. This assumption has been used extensively in the literature to\nassess the strength of the likely gravitational wave signal.

In most cases, the combined effects of magnetic torques and IGW\nAM transport likely lead to substantially longer rotation periods. However, the\nstochastic influx of AM delivered by IGW during shell burning phases inevitably\nspin up a slowly rotating stellar core, leading to a maximum possible core\nrotation period.

A signal can\nfurther be classified as Gaussian-stochastic if a Gaussian signal model is\nfavored. In our analysis we use Bayesian model selection to choose between\nseveral signal and noise models for simulated data consisting of uncorrelated\nGaussian detector noise plus a superposition of sinusoidal signals from an\nastrophysical population of gravitational-wave sources.

Events can be analysed either monoscopically (i.e. using\nonly information of CT5) or stereoscopically (requiring at least two triggered\ntelescopes per event). To achieve a good performance, a sophisticated event\nreconstruction and analysis framework is indispensable.

In Newtonian gravity the pressure within a star merely\nplays the role of opposing self-gravity. In general relativity all sources of\nenergy and momentum contribute to the gravity. As a result the pressure not\nonly opposes gravity but also enhances it. The later role of pressure becomes\nmore pronounced with increasing compactness, $M/R$ where $M$ and $R$ are the\nmass and radius of the star, and sets a critical mass beyond which collapse is\ninevitable. This critical mass has no Newtonian analogue; it is conceptually\ndifferent than the Stoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit in Newtonian gravity which\nis attained asymptotically for ultra-relativistic fermions. For white dwarfs\nthe general relativistic critical mass is very close to the\nStoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit. For neutron stars the maximum mass---so\ncalled Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit---is significantly smaller than the\nStoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit. This follows from the fact that the general\nrelativistic correction to hydrostatic equilibrium within a neutron star is\nsignificant throughout the star, including the central part where the mass\ncontained within radial coordinate, $m(r)$, and the Newtonian gravitational\nacceleration, $Gm(r)/r^2$, are small. \n\n"}

The new\npulsars have DMs in the range $23.6 - 133.3$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and periods in the\nrange $1.249 - 5.012$ s, and include two nullers and a mode-switching object.\nWe estimate an upper limit on the all-sky FRB rate of $10^5$ day$^{-1}$ for\nbursts with a width of 10 ms and flux density $\\gtrsim 83$ mJy. The DMs of all\nnew discoveries are consistent with a Galactic origin. In comparing statistics\nof the new RRATs with sources from the RRATalog, we find that both sets are\ndrawn from the same period distribution. In contrast, we find that the period\ndistribution of the new pulsars is different from the period distributions of\ncanonical pulsars in the ATNF catalog or pulsars found in AO327 data by a\nperiodicity search. This indicates that Clusterrank is a powerful complement to\nperiodicity searches and uncovers a subset of the pulsar population that has so\nfar been underrepresented in survey results and therefore in Galactic pulsar\npopulation models. \n\n"}

The X-ray spectra from all the observations are found to\nbe adequately fitted by a double Comptonization model where the soft excess and\nthe hard X-ray power law are represented by thermal Comptonization in a low\ntemperature plasma and hot corona, respectively. Apart from the fluxes of each\ncomponent, the hard X-ray power law index is found to be variable.

Our calculations\nfollow, as a function of time (on a total time scale of several hours), the\ntransition of the system through all different accretion regimes that are\ntriggered by the intrinsic variations in the density and velocity of the\nnon-stationary wind.

However, the\nULX may still be explained by super-Eddington accretion onto a stellar-remnant\nblack hole. We present simultaneous NuSTAR, Chandra and Swift/XRT observations\nduring the peak of a flaring episode with the aim of modeling the emission of\nM82 X-1 and yielding insights into its nature. We find that thin-accretion disk\nmodels all require accretion rates at or above the Eddington limit in order to\nreproduce the spectral shape, given a range of black hole masses and spins.\nSince at these high Eddington ratios the thin-disk model breaks down due to\nradial advection in the disk, we discard the results of the thin-disk models as\nunphysical. We find that the temperature profile as a function of disk radius\n($T(r)\\propto r^{-p}$) is significantly flatter ($p=0.55^{+ 0.07}_{- 0.04}$)\nthan expected for a standard thin disk ($p=0.75$).

Previous studies showed that only a certain\ncombination of the individual deformabilities of each body (chirp tidal\ndeformability) can be measured with second-generation gravitational wave\ninterferometers, such as Adv.

To overcome this, we search for approximately universal (or\nequation-of-state independent) relations between two combinations of the\nindividual tidal deformabilities, such that once one of them has been measured,\nthe other can be automatically obtained and the individual ones decoupled\nthrough these relations.

In order to detect and analyse these signals, accurate\nwaveform templates which include the effects of the compact object's\ngravitational self-force are required.

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are\nused to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of\nthe morphological classes.

That way, a self-regulatory\nbehaviour in the effects of dynamical interactions among the BHs, especially\nwhile heating and expanding the cluster and self-depleting the BHs, is\ndemonstrated. The BBH mergers obtained here show a prominence in\ntriple-mediated mergers while being bound to the clusters, compared to those\noccurring among the BBHs that are dynamically ejected from the clusters. This\nis in contrast with earlier N-body computations and also with recent\nMonte-Carlo method based ones. A broader mass spectrum of BHs and ejection of\nBBHs generally of wider orbits and in lower numbers, for the cluster masses\nexplored here, might cause this which is yet to be fully understood.

Much of this may be caused\nby the requirement that the gravitational sphere of influence of the black hole\nmust be resolved for the black-hole mass to be reliably estimated. We revisit\nthis issue by using a comprehensive galaxy evolution semi-analytic model, which\nself-consistently evolves supermassive black holes from high-redshift seeds via\ngas accretion and mergers, and also includes AGN feedback. Once tuned to\nreproduce the (mean) correlation of black-hole mass with velocity dispersion,\nthe model is unable to also account for the correlation with stellar mass. This\nbehaviour is independent of the model's parameters, thus suggesting an internal\ninconsistency in the data. The predicted distributions, especially at the\nlow-mass end, are also much broader than observed. However, if selection\neffects are included, the model's predictions tend to align with the\nobservations. We also demonstrate that the correlations between the residuals\nof the local scaling relations are more effective than the scaling relations\nthemselves at constraining AGN feedback models. In fact, we find that our\nsemi-analytic model, while in apparent broad agreement with the scaling\nrelations when accounting for selection biases, yields very weak correlations\nbetween their residuals at fixed stellar mass, in stark contrast with\nobservations.

We show that if multiple images of a repeating source are resolved\nwith VLBI, using a method independent of lens modeling, accurate timing could\nreveal non-uniform motion, either physical or apparent, of the emission spot.\nThis can probe the physical nature of FRBs and their surrounding environments,\nconstraining scenarios including orbital motion around a stellar companion if\nFRBs require a compact star in a special system, and jet-medium interactions\nfor which the location of the emission spot may randomly vary. The high timing\nprecision possible for FRBs ($\\sim {\\rm ms}$) compared to the typical time\ndelays between images in galaxy lensing ($\\gtrsim 10\\, {\\rm days}$) enables the\nmeasurement of tiny fractional changes in the delays ($\\sim 10^{-9}$), and\nhence the detection of time-delay variations induced by relative motions\nbetween the source, the lens, and the Earth.

Because the Alfv\\'en speed\nvaries with distance from the disk, the AWs undergo partial non-WKB reflection,\nand counter-propagating AWs subsequently interact, causing AW energy to cascade\nto small scales and dissipate. To investigate this process, we introduce an\nElsasser-like formulation of general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) and develop the\ntheory of general relativistic reduced MHD in an inhomogeneous medium. We then\nderive a set of equations for the mean-square AW amplitude $M_+$ and turbulent\nheating rate $Q$ under the assumption that, in the plasma rest frame, AWs\npropagating away from the disk are much more energetic than AWs propagating\ntoward the disk. For the case in which the background flow is axisymmetric and\ntime-independent, we solve these equations analytically to determine $M_+$ and\n$Q$ as functions of position. We find that, for an idealized thin disk threaded\nby a large-scale poloidal magnetic field, the AW energy flux is $\\sim\n(\\rho_{\\rm b}/\\rho_{\\rm d})^{1/2} \\beta_{\\rm net,d}^{-1/2}$ times the disk's\nradiative flux, where $\\rho_{\\rm b}$ and $\\rho_{\\rm d}$ are the mass densities\nat the coronal base and disk midplane, respectively, and $\\beta_{\\rm net,d}$ is\nthe ratio (evaluated at the disk midplane) of plasma-plus-radiation pressure to\nthe pressure of the average vertical magnetic field.

This resonant tide can induce phase shift in the\ngravitational waveforms, and potentially provide a new window of studying NS\ninterior using gravitational waves. Previous works have considered tidal\nexcitations of pure g-modes (due to stable stratification of the star) and pure\ninertial modes (due to Coriolis force), with the rotational effect treated in\nan approximate manner. However, for realistic NSs, the buoyancy and rotational\neffects can be comparable, giving rise to mixed inertial-gravity modes.

We then calculate the phase\nshift in the gravitational waveform due to each resonance during binary\ninspiral. We adopt polytropic NS models with a parameterized stratification. We\nderive relevant scaling relations and survey how the phase shift depends on\nvarious properties of the NS.

After such a\nmerger, a compact remnant is left over whose nature depends primarily on the\nmasses of the inspiralling objects and on the equation of state of nuclear\nmatter. This could be either a black hole or a neutron star (NS), with the\nlatter being either long-lived or too massive for stability implying delayed\ncollapse to a black hole.

In particular, we produce\ntwo classes of EOSs with and without phase transitions, each containing one\nmillion EOSs.

If the flux is isotropic, the\nluminosities range up to roughly 10^41 erg/s, implying masses of M>10^3 Msun if\nthe luminosity is sub-Eddington. Here we explore a model for these sources. We\nsuggest that in some tens of percent of globular clusters a very massive black\nhole, M>50 Msun, is formed. This black hole sinks in <10^6 yr to the center of\nthe cluster, where in the 10^10 yr lifetime of the cluster it accretes roughly\n10^3 Msun, primarily in the form of lighter black holes. Unlike less massive\nblack holes in binaries, which are flung from clusters by recoil before they\ncan merge gravitationally, a >50 Msun black hole has enough inertia that it\nremains bound to the cluster. We suggest that 10^3 Msun black holes may be\ncommon in the centers of dense globular clusters, and may therefore exist in\nsome tens of percent of current globulars. If the cluster later merges with its\nhost galaxy, accretion from young star clusters in molecular clouds by the\nblack hole can generate luminosity consistent with that observed.

Rapid mass\nsegregation of massive main-sequence stars and the development of the Spitzer\ninstability can drive these systems to core collapse in a small fraction of the\ninitial half-mass relaxation time. If the core collapse time is less than the\nlifetime of the massive stars, all stars in the collapsing core may then\nundergo a runaway collision process leading to the formation of a massive black\nhole. Here we study in detail the first step in this process, up to the\noccurrence of core collapse. We have performed about 100 simulations for\nclusters with a wide variety of initial conditions, varying systematically the\ncluster density profile, stellar IMF, and number of stars. We also considered\nthe effects of initial mass segregation and stellar evolution mass loss. Our\nresults show that, for clusters with a moderate initial central concentration\nand any realistic IMF, the ratio of core collapse time to initial half-mass\nrelaxation time is typically ~0.1, in agreement with the value previously found\nby direct N-body simulations for much smaller systems.

We examine how the calculated black-hole mass distributions are\nmodified by (i) strong wind mass loss at different evolutionary stages of the\nprogenitors, and (ii) the presence of close binary companions to the black-hole\nprogenitors. Thus, we are able to derive the binary black hole mass\ndistribution. The compact remnant distribution is dominated by neutron stars in\nthe mass range 1.2-1.6Msun and falls off exponentially at higher remnant\nmasses.

For a neutron star of mass M, radius R, spin frequency f_spin,\nmodeled as a Gamma =2 polytrope, with a companion also of mass M, the\ngravitational wave phase shift for the m=2 mode is\n(0.1radians)(R/10km)^4(M/1.4M_sun)^{-10/3}(f_spin/100Hz)^{2/3} for optimal spin\norientation.

This means that the output of an interferometer must be\ncross- correlated with many waveform templates to dig out faint signals buried\nin the noise. The templates are characterized by several parameters which vary\ncontinuously over some finite range; but because the amount of computing power\navailable to perform the cross-correlations of the search templates with the\noutput is finite, the actual templates used must be picked with certain\ndiscrete values of these parameters, which will have some finite spacing. If\nthe spacing is too small, the number of templates (and therefore the computing\npower) needed to perform an on-line search becomes prohibitive; if the spacing\nis too large, many chirps will not be detected because the values of their\nparameters lie too far from those of the nearest template.

Moreover, the presence of the extra\ndimensions reduces the interaction rate of the cosmic strings in some\nscenarios, resulting in an order of magnitude enhancement of the number/energy\ndensity of the cosmic string network when compared to the field theory case. \n\n"}

We study this in string perturbation theory for\ncollisions between all possible pairs of strings; different cases involve\nsphere, disk, and annulus amplitudes. The result also depends on the details of\ncompactification; the dependence on ratios of scales is only logarithmic, but\nthis is still numerically important.

{"id": "hep-th/0409156", "contents": "Title: An Effective Field Theory of Gravity for Extended Objects Abstract: We present an Effective Field Theory (EFT) formalism which describes the\ndynamics of non-relativistic extended objects coupled to gravity. The formalism\nis relevant to understanding the gravitational radiation power spectra emitted\nby binary star systems, an important class of candidate signals for\ngravitational wave observatories such as LIGO or VIRGO. The EFT allows for a\nclean separation of the three relevant scales: r_s, the size of the compact\nobjects, r the orbital radius and r/v, the wavelength of the physical radiation\n(where the velocity v is the expansion parameter). In the EFT radiation is\nsystematically included in the v expansion without need to separate integrals\ninto near zones and radiation zones. We show that the renormalization of\nultraviolet divergences which arise at v^6 in post-Newtonian (PN) calculations\nrequires the presence of two non-minimal worldline gravitational couplings\nlinear in the Ricci curvature. However, these operators can be removed by a\nredefinition of the metric tensor, so that the divergences at arising at v^6\nhave no physically observable effect. Because in the EFT finite size features\nare encoded in the coefficients of non-minimal couplings, this implies a simple\nproof of the decoupling of internal structure for spinless objects to at least\norder v^6. Neglecting absorptive effects, we find that the power counting rules\nof the EFT indicate that the next set of short distance operators, which are\nquadratic in the curvature and are associated with tidal deformations, do not\nplay a role until order v^10. These operators, which encapsulate finite size\nproperties of the sources, have coefficients that can be fixed by a matching\ncalculation. By including the most general set of such operators, the EFT\nallows one to work within a point particle theory to arbitrary orders in v. \n\n"}

The reconnection probability $p$ of\nintersecting fundamental or Dirichlet strings might be much smaller than 1, and\nthe properties of the resulting string network may differ significantly from\nthose of ordinary strings (which have $p=1$). In addition, it has been recently\nsuggested that the typical length of newly formed loops may differ by a factor\n$\\epsilon \\ll 1$ from its standard estimate. Here, we analyze the effects of\nthe two parameters $p$ and $\\epsilon$ on the GW signatures of strings. We\nconsider both the GW bursts emitted from cusps of oscillating string loops,\nwhich have been suggested as candidate sources for the LIGO/VIRGO and LISA\ninterferometers, and the stochastic GW background, which may be detectable by\npulsar timing observations. In both cases we find that previously obtained\nresults are \\textit{quite robust}, at least when the loop sizes are not\nsuppressed by many orders of magnitude relative to the standard scenario.

Boost corrections to the two-nucleon\ninteraction, which give the leading relativistic effect of order (v/c)^2, as\nwell as three-nucleon interactions, are also included in the nuclear\nHamiltonian. Their successive addition increases the mass limit to 1.80 and\n2.20 M_{solar}. Hamiltonians including a three-nucleon interaction predict a\ntransition in neutron star matter to a phase with neutral pion condensation at\na baryon number density of 0.2 fm^{-3}. We also investigate the possibility of\ndense nucleon matter having an admixture of quark matter, described using the\nbag model equation of state. Neutron stars of 1.4 M_{solar} do not appear to\nhave quark matter admixtures in their cores. However, the heaviest stars are\npredicted to have cores consisting of a quark and nucleon matter mixture. These\nadmixtures reduce the maximum mass of neutron stars from 2.20 to 2.02 (1.91)\nM_{solar} for bag constant B = 200 (122) MeV/fm^3. Stars with pure quark matter\nin their cores are found to be unstable.
