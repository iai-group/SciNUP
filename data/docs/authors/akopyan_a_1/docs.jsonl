The problem\nreduces to estimate a quadratic form (called \"localization function\") of a\ncertain projection matrix related to the source signal empirical covariance\nmatrix. Recently, a new subspace estimation method (called \"G-MUSIC\") has been\nproposed, in the context where the number of available samples $N$ is of the\nsame order of magnitude than the number of sensors $M$. In this context, the\ntraditional subspace methods tend to fail because the empirical covariance\nmatrix of the observations is a poor estimate of the source signal covariance\nmatrix. The G-MUSIC method is based on a new consistent estimator of the\nlocalization function in the regime where $M$ and $N$ tend to $+\\infty$ at the\nsame rate.

It is known\nthat all possible multiple tilers in 3D are zonotopes. In 2D it was known by\nthe work of M. Kolountzakis that, unless $P$ is a parallelogram, the multiset\nof translation vectors $\\Lambda$ must be a finite union of translated lattices\n(also known as quasi periodic sets). In that work [Kolountzakis, 2002], the\nauthor asked whether the same quasi-periodic structure on the translation\nvectors would be true in 3D. Here we prove that this conclusion is indeed true\nfor 3D.\n  Namely, we show that if $P$ is a convex multiple tiler in 3D, with a discrete\nmultiset $\\Lambda$ of translation vectors, then $\\Lambda$ has to be a finite\nunion of translated lattices, unless $P$ belongs to a special class of\nzonotopes.

We show that, informally speaking, in the limit N\ngoes to infinity, the clusters only freeze in the critical window of site\npercolation on the triangular lattice. Hence the fraction of vertices that\neventually (i. e. at time 1) are in a frozen cluster tends to 0 as N goes to\ninfinity.

We\nprove that in the range $\\tfrac{1}{2} < \\alpha < 1$ a.a.s. for any two vertices\nof the same component, their graph distance is $O(\\log^{C_0+1+o(1)}n)$, where\n$C_0=2/(\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\frac{3}{4}\\alpha+\\tfrac{\\alpha^2}{4})$, thus answering a\nquestion raised in [GPP12] concerning the diameter of such random graphs.

In this spirit, we modulate a two dimensional reflecting skip-free\nrandom walk in such a way that its state transitions in the boundary faces and\ninterior of a nonnegative integer quadrant are controlled by Markov chains.\nThis Markov modulated model is referred to as a 2d-QBD process according to\nOzaw (2013). We are interested in the tail asymptotics of its stationary\ndistribution, which has been well studied when there is no Markov modulation.\n  Ozawa studied this tail asymptotics problem, but his answer is not\nanalytically tractable. We think this is because Markov modulation is so free\nto change a model even if the state space for Markov modulation is finite.\nThus, some structure, say, extra conditions, would be needed to make the Markov\nmodulation analytically tractable while minimizing its limitation in\napplication.\n  The aim of this paper is to investigate such structure for the tail\nasymptotic problem. For this, we study the existence of a right subinvariant\npositive vector, called a superharmonic vector, of a nonnegative matrix with\nQBD block structure, where each block matrix is finite dimensional. We\ncharacterize this existence under a certain extra assumption. We apply this\ncharacterization to the 2d-QBD process, and derive the tail decay rates of its\nmarginal stationary distribution in an arbitrary direction.

In addition to simulating quantum systems, SQA has also been\nproposed as another physics-inspired classical algorithm for combinatorial\noptimization, alongside classical simulated annealing. However, in many cases\nit remains an open challenge to determine the performance of both QA and SQA.\nOne piece of evidence for the strength of QA over classical simulated annealing\ncomes from an example by Farhi, Goldstone and Gutmann . There a bit-symmetric\ncost function with a thin, high energy barrier was designed to show an\nexponential seperation between classical simulated annealing, for which thermal\nfluctuations take exponential time to climb the barrier, and quantum annealing\nwhich passes through the barrier and reaches the global minimum in poly time,\narguably by taking advantage of quantum tunneling. In this work we apply a\ncomparison method to rigorously show that the Markov chain underlying SQA\nefficiently samples the target distribution and finds the global minimum of\nthis spike cost function in polynomial time. Our work provides evidence for the\ngrowing consensus that SQA inherits at least some of the advantages of\ntunneling in QA, and so QA is unlikely to achieve exponential speedups over\nclassical computing solely by the use of quantum tunneling. Since we analyze\nonly a particular model this evidence is not decisive. However, techniques\napplied here---including warm starts from the adiabatic path and the use of the\nquantum ground state probability distribution to understand the stationary\ndistribution of SQA---may be valuable for future studies of the performance of\nSQA on cost functions for which QA is efficient. \n\n"}

In this memoir, we introduce the class of `relative fractal\ndrums' (or RFDs), which contains the classes of bounded fractal strings and of\ncompact fractal subsets of Euclidean spaces as special cases. Furthermore, the\nassociated (relative) distance zeta functions of RFDs, extend (in a suitable\nsense) the aforementioned classes of fractal zeta functions. This notion is\nvery general and flexible, enabling us to view practically all of the\npreviously studied aspects of the theory of fractal zeta functions from a\nunified perspective as well as to go well beyond the previous theory.

We say that $S$ is\n\\emph{inverse free} if it does not contain the identity element. One of our\nmain results states that if $S$ is a semigroup generated by some finite\ncollection $\\mathcal{F}$ of M\\\"obius transformations, then $S$ is semidiscrete\nand inverse free if and only if every sequence of the form $F_n=f_1\\dotsb f_n$,\nwhere $f_n\\in\\mathcal{F}$, converges pointwise on the upper half-plane to a\npoint on the ideal boundary, where convergence is with respect to the chordal\nmetric on the extended complex plane.

We consider a stochastic\nindividual-based pure jump process taking values in the space of point\nmeasures, and whose jump events describe the individual reproduction, transfer\nand death mechanisms. In a large population scale, the stochastic process is\nproved to converge to the solution of a nonlinear integro-differential\nequation.

We begin by defining a new kind of abstract\nlimit object, called \"partitioned subprobability measure\", to describe the\nlimits of endpoint distributions of directed polymers. Inspired by a recent\nwork of Mukherjee and Varadhan on large deviations of the occupation measure of\nBrownian motion, we define a suitable topology on the space of partitioned\nsubprobability measures and prove that this topology is compact. Then using a\nvariant of the cavity method from the theory of spin glasses, we show that any\nlimit law of a sequence of endpoint distributions must satisfy a fixed point\nequation on this abstract space, and that the limiting free energy of the model\ncan be expressed as the solution of a variational problem over the set of fixed\npoints.

This paper presents, within the\ncontext of uncertainty quantification, a practical implementation using basis\nadaptation, and coherence motivated sampling, which under assumptions has\nsatisfying guarantees. This implementation is referred to as Basis Adaptive\nSample Efficient Polynomial Chaos (BASE-PC). A key component of this is the use\nof anisotropic polynomial order which admits evolving global bases for\napproximation in an efficient manner, leading to consistently stable\napproximation for a practical class of smooth functionals. This fully adaptive,\nnon-intrusive method, requires no a priori information of the solution, and has\nsatisfying theoretical guarantees of recovery. A key contribution to stability\nis the use of a presented correction sampling for coherence-optimal sampling in\norder to improve stability and accuracy within the adaptive basis scheme.\nTheoretically, the method may dramatically reduce the impact of dimensionality\nin function approximation, and numerically the method is demonstrated to\nperform well on problems with dimension up to 1000. \n\n"}

We extend the results of Kenig, Preiss, and Toro [KPT09] by showing mutual\nabsolute continuity of interior and exterior elliptic measures for {\\it any}\ndomains implies the tangent measures are a.e. flat and the elliptic measures\nhave dimension $n$.\n  2. We generalize the work of Kenig and Toro [KT06] and show that VMO\nequivalence of doubling interior and exterior elliptic measures for general\ndomains implies the tangent measures are always elliptic polynomials.\n  3. In a uniform domain that satisfies the capacity density condition and\nwhose boundary is locally finite and has a.e. positive lower $n$-Hausdorff\ndensity, we show that if the elliptic measure is absolutely continuous with\nrespect to $n$-Hausdorff measure then the boundary is rectifiable. This\ngeneralizes the work of Akman, Badger, Hofmann, and Martell [ABHM17].\n  Finally, we generalize one of the main results of [Bad11] by showing that if\n$\\omega$ is a Radon measure for which all tangent measures at a point are\nharmonic polynomials vanishing at the origin, then they are all homogeneous\nharmonic polynomials. \n\n"}

Such non-stationary models arise\nnaturally in contexts in which time-of-day effects or seasonality effects need\nto be incorporated. Our approximations are valid asymptotically in regimes in\nwhich the transition probabilities change slowly over time. Specifically, we\ndevelop approximations for the expected infinite horizon discounted reward, the\nexpected reward to the hitting time of a set, the expected reward associated\nwith the state occupied by the chain at time $n$, and the expected cumulative\nreward over an interval $[0,n]$. In each case, the approximation involves a\nlinear system of equations identical in form to that which one would need to\nsolve to compute the corresponding quantity for a Markov model having\nstationary transition probabilities.

Furthermore, we show that the Vietoris-Rips complex of\nan arbitrarily dense subset of $P_n$ need not be homotopy equivalent to the\nVietoris-Rips complex of $P_n$ itself, and indeed, these two complexes can have\ndifferent homology groups in arbitrarily high dimensions. As an application of\nour results, we provide a lower bound on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between\n$P_n$ and the circle. \n\n"}

One of the major open\nproblems in this field is to determine lower and upper bounds on the number of\nrealizations with respect to a given number of vertices.

{"id": "math/9811157", "contents": "Title: Noise Sensitivity of Boolean Functions and Applications to Percolation Abstract: It is shown that a large class of events in a product probability space are\nhighly sensitive to noise, in the sense that with high probability, the\nconfiguration with an arbitrary small percent of random errors gives almost no\nprediction whether the event occurs. On the other hand, weighted majority\nfunctions are shown to be noise-stable. Several necessary and sufficient\nconditions for noise sensitivity and stability are given.\n  Consider, for example, bond percolation on an $n+1$ by $n$ grid. A\nconfiguration is a function that assigns to every edge the value 0 or 1. Let\n$\\omega$ be a random configuration, selected according to the uniform measure.\nA crossing is a path that joins the left and right sides of the rectangle, and\nconsists entirely of edges $e$ with $\\omega(e)=1$. By duality, the probability\nfor having a crossing is 1/2. Fix an $\\epsilon\\in(0,1)$. For each edge $e$, let\n$\\omega'(e)=\\omega(e)$ with probability $1-\\epsilon$, and\n$\\omega'(e)=1-\\omega(e)$ with probability $\\epsilon$, independently of the\nother edges.
