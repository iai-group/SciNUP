Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

It was originally estimated that only one or two\nof the essential evolutionary steps had to have been hard in this sense, but it\nhas become apparent that this figure may need upward revision, because recent\nstudies of climatic instability suggest that the possible future duration of\nour biologically favourable environment may be shorter than had been supposed,\nonly about one Giga year rather than five. On the basis of the statistical\nrequirement of roughly equal spacing between hard steps, it is argued that the\nbest fit with the fossil record is now obtainable by postulating the number of\nhard steps to be five, if our evolution was exclusively terrestrial, or six if,\nas now seems very plausible, the first step occurred on Mars. \n\n"}

Indeed, merely a single case of a star-planet-disk\nsystem has previously been detected at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths.\nConsequently, one of our aims is to understand the reasons for these poor\nstatistics, i.e., whether these results reflected the composition and/or the\nphysics of the planetary disks or were simply due to observational bias and\nselection effects. Finding more examples would be very significant. The\nselected target, q1 Eri, is a solar-type star, which was known to possess a\nplanet, q1 Eri b, and to exhibit excess emission at IRAS wavelengths, but had\nremained undetected in the millimeter regime. Therefore, submm flux densities\nwould be needed to better constrain the physical characteristics of the\nplanetary disk. Consequently, we performed submm imaging observations of q1\nEri. The detected dust toward q1 Eri at 870 micron exhibits the remarkable fact\nthat the entire SED, from the IR to mm-wavelengths, is fit by a single\ntemperature blackbody function (60 K). This would imply that the emitting\nregions are confined to a narrow region (ring) at radial distances much larger\nthan the orbital distance of q1 Eri b, and that the emitting particles are\nconsiderably larger than some hundred micron. However, the 870 micron source is\nextended, with a full-width-half-maximum of roughly 600 AU.

Such binaries form after major galaxy\nmergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering\nbecomes very inefficient at sub-parsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary\ndynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the orbits of binaries embedded within\ngeometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly resolve angular momentum\ntransport within the disc, which at the radii of interest is likely dominated\nby disc self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good\nagreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation\nof eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e > 0.35. Accretion onto\nthe black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital\nfrequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of\nbinary decay that is possible without fragmentation occuring within the\nsurrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar\ndynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 10^5 < M/Msun < 10^8\nwe find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a ~\n0.01--0.1 pc, where the disc is optically thick. The minimum merger time scale\nis shorter than the Hubble time for M < 10^7 Msun.

Dark matter particles that end up within two virial\nradii of a Milky-Way-sized DM halo at $z=0$ have an approximately Gaussian\ndistribution in log(f) at early redshifts, but the distribution becomes\nincreasingly skewed at lower redshifts. The value corresponding to the peak of\nthe Gaussian decreases as the evolution progresses and is well described by a\npower-law in (1+z). The highest values of f are found at the centers of dark\nmatter halos and subhalos, where f can be an order of magnitude higher than in\nthe center of the main halo.

By performing an ensemble of radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show that such discs fragment within a few thousand years, and\nproduce mainlybrown dwarf (BDs) stars, but also planetary mass (PM) stars and\nvery low-mass hydrogen-burning (HB) stars. Most of the the PM stars and BDs are\nejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these\nstars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years\nthe Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and\ntwo much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.\nThere is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs\ntend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be\nscattered even further out, or even into the field. BDs form with discs of a\nfew Mj and radii of a few tens of AU, and they are more likely to retain these\ndiscs if they remain bound to the primary star.

For the respective scenarios, the lifetimes\nfor decaying dark matter are $\\Gamma^{-1} \\gtrsim 100$ Gyr and $ (f \\Gamma)\n^{-1} \\gtrsim 5.3 \\times 10^8$ Gyr (at 95.4% confidence level), where the\nphenomenological parameter $f$ is the fraction of the decay energy deposited in\nbaryonic gas. This allows us to constrain particle physics models with dark\nmatter candidates through investigation of dark matter decays into Standard\nModel particles via effective operators. For decaying dark matter of $\\sim 100$\nGeV mass, we found that the size of the coupling constant in the effective\ndimension-4 operators responsible for dark matter decay has to generically be $\n\\lesssim 10^{-22}$. We have also explored the implications of our analysis for\nrepresentative models in theories of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking,\nminimal supergravity and little Higgs. \n\n"}

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers\nafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably\ndissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be\napproximately proportional to the increase in mass. This model successfully\nreproduces the observed evolution since z~2 in the mean size and in the\ncomoving mass density of massive early-type galaxies.

In fact, the addition of a new contribution accounting for the\ngas can increase the statistical significance of the lensing model.

We further compactify one of the $(D-1)$ spatial\ndimensions on an $S^{1}/Z_{2}$ orbifold, and derive the gravitational and\nmatter field equations both in the bulk and on the branes. Then, we investigate\ntwo key issues in such a setup: (i) the radion stability and radion mass; and\n(ii) the localization of gravity, and the corresponding Kaluza-Klein (KK)\nmodes. We show explicitly that the radion is stable and its mass can be in the\norder of $GeV$. In addition, the gravity is localized on the visible brane, and\nits spectrum of the gravitational KK towers is discrete and can have a mass gap\nof $TeV$, too. The high order Yukawa corrections to the 4-dimensional Newtonian\npotential is exponentially suppressed, and can be negligible.

The origin of the radio emission is\nunclear,it could be due either to a jet, as in microquasars, or to the shock\nboundary between the Be star and a possible pulsar wind. We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before). We show that this result qualitatively\nand quantitatively agrees with the two-peak accretion/ejection model proposed\nin the past for LS I +61303. We conclude that the radio emission in LS I +61303\noriginates from a jet and suggest that the variable TeV emission comes from the\nusual Compton losses expected as an important by-product in the shock-in-jet\ntheory. \n\n"}

The local AGN luminosity\n  function Abstract: We present a determination of the local (z=0) luminosity function of\noptically selected type 1 (broad-line) Active Galactic Nuclei. Our primary\nresource is the Hamburg/ESO Survey (HES), which provides a well-defined sample\nof more than 300 optically bright AGN with redshifts z<0.3 and blue magnitudes\nB<17.5. AGN luminosities were estimated in two ways, always taking care to\nminimise photometric biases due to host galaxy light contamination. Firstly, we\nmeasured broad-band B_J (blue) magnitudes of the objects over small apertures\nof the size of the seeing disk. Secondly, we extracted H alpha and H beta broad\nemission line luminosities from the spectra which should be entirely free of\nany starlight contribution. The resulting AGN luminosity function (AGNLF) is\nconsistent with a single power law, also when considering the effects of number\ndensity evolution within the narrow redshift range. We compared our AGNLF with\nthe H alpha luminosity function of lower luminosity Seyfert 1 galaxies by Hao\net al.

From the combination of HES and SDSS\nsamples we constructed a single local AGNLF spanning more than 4 orders of\nmagnitude in luminosity.

Abstract: The observations show that less massive the galaxies are, the higher on\naverage is their specific star formation rate (SSFR = SFR/Ms, Ms is the stellar\nmass). Such a trend, called the 'SSFR downsizing' (SSFR-DS) phenomenon, is seen\nfor local and high-z (back to z~1-2) galaxy samples. We use observational data\nrelated only to disc galaxies and explore the average SSFR change with z for\ndifferent masses. For Ms in the range ~10^9.5-10^10.5 Msun, the SSFR increases\nwith (1+z) to a power that barely depends on Ms, and at all z's smaller\ngalaxies have ever higher SSFRs. The latter strongly disagree with the LCDM\nhierarchical mass accretion rates. By means of self-consistent models of disc\ngalaxy evolution inside growing LCDM halos, the effects that disc\nfeedback-driven outflows and gas re-accretion have on the galaxy SSFR histories\nare explored. The parameters of the outflow and re-accretion schemes are tuned\nto reproduce the z~0 Mh-Ms relation inferred from observations. In the case of\noutflows only, the SSFR of individual model galaxies is roughly proportional to\n(1+z)^2.2 for all the masses with a normalization factor that depends on mass\nas Ms^0.1, i.e more massive galaxies have slightly larger SSFRs, contrary to\nthe observed strong SSFR-DS trend. For the re-accretion cases, the dependence\non z remains approximately the same as without re-infall, but the correlation\non Ms even increases for most of the reasonable values of the model parameters.\nThe comparison of models and observations in the SSFR-Ms plane at z~0 shows the\ndivergent trend in SSFR as lower are the masses (upsizing vs downsizing). We\nexplain why the models show the reported trends, and conclude that the SSFR-DS\nfor low-mass galaxies poses a challenge for LCDM-based disc galaxy evolution\nmodels. (Abridged) \n\n"}

The BLR mass influx is sufficient to power the AGN. The\nincreasing blueshifting of lines with increasing ionization potential is a\nconsequence of scattering off infalling material.

The\ntechnical reason for this effect to occur is the property of Bogolubov's\ncoefficients which mix the positive and negative frequencies modes. The\ncorresponding mixture can not be avoided because the projections to positive\n-frequency modes with respect to Minkowski time t and positive -frequency modes\nwith respect to the Rindler observer's proper time \\eta are not equivalent. The\nexact cancellation of unphysical degrees of freedom which is maintained in\nMinkowski space can not hold in the Rindler space. In BRST approach this effect\nmanifests itself as the presence of BRST charge density in L and R parts.

The fast-evolving light curve soon after\nthe outbursts, the quasi-modulated light curve, the peak magnitude and the\noverall spectral properties are consistent with multiple episodes of\nvariability of an extremely active LBV. However, the widths of the spectral\nlines indicate unusually high wind velocities (1500-2800 km/s), similar to\nthose observed in Wolf-Rayet stars.

Using a set of collisionless N-body simulations, we investigate the\nefficiency of the tidal stirring mechanism. We explore a wide variety of dwarf\norbital configurations and initial structures and demonstrate that in most\ncases the disky dwarfs experience significant mass loss and their stellar\ncomponents undergo a dramatic morphological and dynamical transformation: from\ndisks to bars and finally to pressure-supported spheroidal systems with\nkinematic and structural properties akin to those of the classic dSphs in the\nLocal Group (LG). Our results suggest that such tidal transformations should be\ncommon occurrences within the currently favored cosmological paradigm and\nhighlight the key factor responsible for an effective metamorphosis to be the\nstrength of the tidal shocks at the pericenters of the orbit. We demonstrate\nthat the combination of short orbital times and small pericenters,\ncharacteristic of dwarfs being accreted at high redshift, induces the strongest\ntransformations. Our models also indicate that the transformation efficiency is\naffected significantly by the structure of the progenitor disky dwarfs. Lastly,\nwe find that the dwarf remnants satisfy the relation Vmax = \\sqrt{3} * sigma,\nwhere sigma is the 1D, central stellar velocity dispersion and Vmax is the\nmaximum halo circular velocity, with intriguing implications for the missing\nsatellites problem. Overall, we conclude that the action of tidal forces from\nthe hosts constitutes a crucial evolutionary mechanism for shaping the nature\nof dwarf galaxies in environments such as that of the LG. Environmental\nprocesses of this type should thus be included as ingredients in models of\ndwarf galaxy formation and evolution. \n\n"}

Finding the origin of this variability would constrain the still\nlargely unknown properties of this extraordinary object.

Optical spectroscopy of this object has suggested a distance of ~7\nkpc and an identification with a low mass X-ray binary. We instead use the\nX-ray data from 0.3-40 keV to identify the source as a bright intermediate\npolar (IP) with an estimate for the white dwarf mass of~0.60 M_solar. This\nidentification is supported by the presence of an iron triplet, the component\nlines of which are some of the strongest seen in IPs; and the signature of the\nspin period of the white dwarf at ~24 mins. We note that the lack of broad-band\nvariability may suggest that this object is a stream-fed IP, similar in many\nrespects to the well studied IP, V2400 Oph. Phase-binning has allowed us to\ncreate spectra corresponding to the peaks and troughs of the lightcurve from\nwhich we determine that the spectra appear harder in the troughs, consistent\nwith the behaviour of other IPs binned on their spin periods.

To illustrate applications of this to cosmology, we explicitly\ngive a dimensionless version of the parameters of the standard cosmological\nmodel, and describe the physics of Big Bang Neucleosynthesis and recombination\nin a dimensionless manner. The issue that appears to have been missed in many\nstudies is that in cosmology the strength of gravity is bound up in the\ncosmological equations, and the epoch at which we live is a crucial part of the\nmodel. We argue that it is useful to consider the hypothetical situation of\ncommunicating with another civilization (with entirely different units),\ncomparing only dimensionless constants, in order to decide if we live in a\nUniverse governed by precisely the same physical laws. In this thought\nexperiment, we would also have to compare epochs, which can be defined by\ngiving the value of any {\\it one} of the evolving cosmological parameters.

We assess\nthe possibility to use lensed SNe to put constraints on the mass models of\ngalaxy clusters and the Hubble parameter at high redshift. Due to the standard\ncandle nature of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), observational information on the\nlensing magnification from an intervening galaxy cluster can be used to\nconstrain the model for the cluster mass distribution. A statistical analysis\nusing parametric cluster models was performed to investigate the possible\nimprovements from lensed SNe Ia for the accurately modeled galaxy cluster A1689\nand the less well constrained cluster A2204. Time delay measurements obtained\nfrom SNe lensed by accurately modeled galaxy clusters can be used to measure\nthe Hubble parameter. For a survey of A1689 we estimate the expected rate of\ndetectable SNe Ia and of multiply imaged SNe. The velocity dispersion and core\nradius of the main cluster potential show strong correlations with the\npredicted magnifications and can therefore be constrained by observations of\nSNe Ia in background galaxies. This technique proves especially powerful for\ngalaxy clusters with only few known multiple image systems. The main\nuncertainty for measurements of the Hubble parameter from the time delay of\nstrongly lensed SNe is due to cluster model uncertainties. For the extremely\nwell modeled cluster A1689, a single time delay measurement could be used to\ndetermine the Hubble parameter with a precision of ~ 10%. We conclude that\nobservations of SNe Ia behind galaxy clusters can be used to improve the mass\nmodeling of the large scale component of galaxy clusters and thus the\ndistribution of dark matter.

To this aim, we integrate\nin time the equations of mass and energy conservation under self-regulated\ninstability of a two-component disc of gas and stars. The disc is assumed to be\ncontinuously fed by cold gas at the average cosmological rate. The gas forms\nstars and is partly driven away by stellar feedback. The gas and stars flow\ninward through the disc to a central bulge due to torques that drive angular\nmomentum outwards. The gravitational energy released by the mass inflow down\nthe gravitational potential gradient drives the disc turbulence that maintains\nthe disc unstable with a Toomre instability parameter Q~1, compensating for the\ndissipative losses of the gas turbulence and raising the stellar velocity\ndispersion. We follow the velocity dispersion of stars and gas as they heat and\ncool respectively and search for disc `stabilization', to be marked by a low\ngas velocity dispersion comparable to the speed of sound ~10 km/s. We vary the\nmodel parameters that characterize the accreted gas fraction, turbulence\ndissipation rate, star-formation rate, and stellar feedback. We find that as\nlong as the gas input roughly follows the average cosmological rate, the disc\ninstability is a robust phenomenon at high redshift till z~1, driven by the\nhigh surface density and high gas fraction due to the intense cosmological\naccretion. For a broad range of model parameter values, the discs tend to\n`stabilize' at z~0-0.5 as they become dominated by hot stars. When the model\nparameters are pushed to extreme values, the discs may stabilize as early as\nz~2, with the gas loss by strong outflows serving as the dominant stabilizing\nfactor. \n\n"}

Aims: We determine if non-ideal MHD, including\nthe effects of ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation determined from a\ndetailed chemical network model, allows for disk formation at the earliest\nstages of star formation (SF). Methods: We employ the axisymmetric thin-disk\napproximation in order to resolve a dynamic range of 9 orders of magnitude in\nlength and 16 in density, while also calculating partial ionization using up to\n19 species in a detailed chemical equilibrium model. MB is applied using a\nsteady-state approximation, and a barotropic relation is used to capture the\nthermal evolution. Results: We resolve the formation of the first and second\ncores, with expansion waves at the periphery of each, a magnetic diffusion\nshock, and prestellar infall profiles at larger radii. Power-law profiles in\neach region can be understood analytically. After the formation of the second\ncore, centrifugal support rises rapidly and a low-mass disk of radius ~10 R_Sun\nis formed, when the second core has mass ~0.001 M_Sun. The mass-to-flux ratio\nis ~10,000 times the critical value in the central region. Conclusions: A small\ncentrifugal disk can form in the earliest stage of SF, due to a shut-off of MB\ncaused by magnetic field dissipation in the first core region.

II.\n  Episodic formation of broad line regions Abstract: (abridged) We study the consequence of star formation (SF) in an self-gravity\ndominated accretion disk in quasars. The warm skins of the SF disk are governed\nby the radiation from the inner part of the accretion disk to form Compton\natmosphere (CAS). The CAS are undergoing four phases to form broad line\nregions. Phase I is the duration of pure accumulation supplied by the SF disk.\nDuring phase II clouds begin to form due to line cooling and sink to the SF\ndisk. Phase III is a period of preventing clouds from sinking to the SF disk\nthrough dynamic interaction between clouds and the CAS. Finally, phase IV is an\ninevitable collapse of the entire CAS through line cooling. This CAS evolution\ndrives the episodic appearance of BLRs. Geometry and dynamics of BLRs can be\nself-consistently derived from the thermal instability of the CAS during phases\nII and III by linear analysis. The metallicity gradient of SF disk gives rise\nto different properties of clouds from outer to inner part of BLRs. We find\nthat clouds have column density N_H < 10^22cm^{-2} in the metal-rich regions\nwhereas they have N_H > 10^22 cm^{-2} in the metal-poor regions. The metal-rich\nclouds compose the high ionization line (HIL) regions whereas the metal-poor\nclouds are in low ionization line (LIL) regions. Metal-rich clouds in HIL\nregions will be blown away by radiation pressure, forming the observed\noutflows.

At early times, the sheet was flat like an\norigami sheet, i.e. velocities were essentially zero, but as time passes, the\nsheet folds up to form cosmic structure. The present paper further illustrates\nthis analogy, and clarifies a Lagrangian definition of caustics and streams:\ncaustics are two-dimensional surfaces in this initial sheet along which it\nfolds, tessellating Lagrangian space into a set of three-dimensional regions,\ni.e. streams. The main scientific result of the paper is that streams may be\ncolored by only two colors, with no two neighbouring streams (i.e. streams on\neither side of a caustic surface) colored the same.

We find that if future measurements find positive curvature at\n\\Omega_k < -10^-4, then the framework of the eternally inflating multiverse is\nexcluded with high significance. If the measurements instead reveal negative\ncurvature at \\Omega_k > 10^-4, then we can conclude (1) diffusive (new or\nchaotic) eternal inflation did not occur in our immediate past; (2) our\nuniverse was born by a bubble nucleation; (3) the probability measure does not\nreward volume increase; and (4) the origin of the observed slow-roll inflation\nis an accidental feature of the potential, not due to a theoretical mechanism.\nDiscovery of \\Omega_k > 10^-4 would also give us nontrivial information about\nthe correlation between tunneling and slow-roll; e.g. a strong correlation\nfavoring large N would be excluded in certain measures. We also ask whether the\ncurrent constraint on \\Omega_k is consistent with multiverse expectations,\nfinding that the answer is yes, except for certain cases.

One\ndifficulty, however, is that with the short exposure time ($\\simeq$15 seconds)\nproposed, the spatial variation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) shapes may\nbe dominated by the atmosphere, in addition to optics errors. While optics\nerrors mainly cause the PSF to vary on angular scales similar or larger than a\nsingle CCD sensor, the atmosphere generates stochastic structures on a wide\nrange of angular scales. It thus becomes a challenge to infer the multi-scale,\ncomplex atmospheric PSF patterns by interpolating the sparsely sampled stars in\nthe field. In this paper we present a new method, PSFent, for interpolating the\nPSF shape parameters, based on reconstructing underlying shape parameter maps\nwith a multi-scale maximum entropy algorithm. We demonstrate, using images from\nthe LSST Photon Simulator, the performance of our approach relative to a\n5th-order polynomial fit (representing the current standard) and a simple\nboxcar smoothing technique.

Mass-dependent evolutionary rates arise when the mean volume\ndensity of cluster-forming regions is mass-dependent. In that case, even if the\ninitial conditions are such that the cluster mass function at the end of\nviolent relaxation has the same shape as the embedded-cluster mass function\n(i.e. infant weight-loss is mass-independent), the shape of the cluster mass\nfunction does change transiently {\\it during} violent relaxation. In contrast,\nfor cluster-forming regions of constant mean volume density, the cluster mass\nfunction shape is preserved all through violent relaxation since all clusters\nthen evolve at the same mass-independent rate.\n  On the scale of individual clusters, we model the evolution of the ratio\nbetween the dynamical mass and luminous mass of a cluster after gas expulsion.\nSpecifically, we map the radial dependence of the time-scale for a star cluster\nto return to equilibrium.

The W1 band\nprobes massive early-type galaxies out to z\\gtrsim1.

This\nmodel postulates a starburst following each major merger, lasting for a time\nt_SF and converting at most f_star of galactic gas into stars. We include a\nsimple physical prescription for supernovae feedback that suppresses star\nformation in low mass galaxies. Constraining t_SF and f_star to describe the\nobserved star formation rate density at high redshifts, we find that individual\nstarbursts were terminated after a time t_SF~10^7 years. This is comparable to\nthe main-sequence lifetimes of supernova progenitors, indicating that high\nredshift starbursts are quenched once supernovae feedback had time to develop.\nHigh redshift galaxies convert ~10% of their mass into stars for galaxies with\nstar formation rates above ~1 solar mass per year, but a smaller fraction for\nlower luminosity galaxies. Our best fit model successfully predicts the\nobserved relation between star formation rate and stellar mass at z>~4, while\nour deduced relation between stellar mass and halo mass is also consistent with\ndata on the dwarf satellites of the Milky Way.

In presence of a magnetic\nfield in the corona, the electron distribution can appear thermal, even when\nacceleration mechanisms would produce non thermal distributions. This is due to\nfast and efficient thermalization through synchrotron self-absorption. We have\nanalyzed data from 6 years of observations of Cygnus X-1 with the INTEGRAL\nobservatory and produced 12 high-quality, stacked broad-band hard X-ray spectra\nrepresentative of the whole range of spectral shapes observed. We then fit\nthese spectra with hybrid thermal/non-thermal Comptonization models and study\nthe evolution of the physical parameters of the accretion flow across the\nspectral transition. In particular, we use the BELM model to constrain the\nmagnetic field in the corona through its effects on the coronal emission.\nIndeed, the hot electrons of the X-ray corona produce soft (optical-UV)\nsynchrotron radiation which is then Comptonized and may affect the temperature\nof the electrons through Compton cooling. We find that in the SS, the emission\nis dominated by Comptonization of the disc photons and the magnetic field is at\nmost of the order of 1E+06 G. In the hard states, the data are consistent with\na pure synchrotron self-Compton model. If the non-thermal excess observed above\na few hundred keV in the HS is produced in the same region as the bulk of the\nthermal Comptonization, we obtain an upper limit on the coronal magnetic field\nof about 1E+05 G. If, on the other hand, the non-thermal excess is produced in\na different location, the constraints on the magnetic field in the HS are\nsomewhat relaxed and the upper limit rises to 1E+07 G.

Contrary to Newtonian gravity, we find the\nfifth force is repulsive in voids. The strength of the fifth force depends on\nthe density inside and outside the void region as well as its radius. It can be\nmany times larger than the Newtonian force and their ratio is in principle\nunbound. This is very different from the case in halos, where the fifth force\nis no more than 1/3 of gravity. The evolution of voids is governed by the\nNewtonian gravity, the effective dark energy force and the fifth force. While\nthe first two forces are common in both LCDM and chameleon universes, the fifth\nforce is unique to the latter. Driven by the outward-pointing fifth force,\nindividual voids in chameleon models expand faster and grow larger than in a\nLCDM universe. The expansion velocity of the void shell can be 20% to 30%\nlarger for voids of a few Mpc/h in radius, while their sizes can be larger by\n~10%. These differences are smaller for larger voids of the same density. We\ncompare void statistics using excursion set theory; for voids of the same size,\ntheir number density is larger in chameleon models. The fractional difference\nincreases with void size. The chance of having voids of radius ~25 Mpc/h can be\n2.5 times larger. This difference is about 10 times larger than that in the\nhalo mass function. We find strong environmental dependence of void properties\nin chameleon models. The differences in size and expansion velocity with GR are\nboth larger for small voids in high density regions. In general, the difference\nbetween chameleon models and LCDM in void properties (size, expansion velocity\nand distribution function) are larger than the corresponding quantities for\nhalos.

This material is systematically outflowing and shows a large range in\nparameters. However, its actual nature and dynamics are still not clear. In\norder to gain insights into these important issues we performed a literature\nsearch for papers reporting the parameters of the soft X-ray warm absorbers\n(WAs) in 35 type 1 Seyferts and compared their properties to those of the\nultra-fast outflows (UFOs) detected in the same sample. The fraction of sources\nwith WAs is >60%, consistent with previous studies. The fraction of sources\nwith UFOs is >34%, >67% of which also show WAs. The large dynamic range\nobtained when considering all the absorbers together allows us, for the first\ntime, to investigate general relations among them. In particular, we find\nsignificant correlations indicating that the closer the absorber is to the\ncentral black hole, the higher the ionization, column, outflow velocity and\nconsequently the mechanical power. The absorbers continuously populate the\nwhole parameter space, with the WAs and the UFOs lying always at the two ends\nof the distribution. This strongly suggest that these absorbers, often\nconsidered of different types, could actually represent parts of a single\nlarge-scale stratified outflow observed at different locations from the black\nhole.

If the CRs are effectively\naccelerated at the formation of clusters, the kinetic energy of infalling gas\nis consumed by the acceleration and the gas entropy should decrease. As a\nresult, the entropy profiles become flat at the outskirts. If the acceleration\nis not efficient, the entropy should continue to increase outwards.

It is argued that the recently\nobserved broadening of the radio spectra and/or light curves in some of the\ntype Ib/c supernovae is a direct indication of inhomogeneities. As compared to\na homogeneous source, this increases the deduced velocity of the forward shock\nand the observed correlation between total energy and shock velocity could in\npart be due to a varying covering factor.

Interpreting Self-Similarity of the Circumgalactic Medium\n  with Virial Mass using MgII Absorption Abstract: In Churchill et al., we used halo abundance matching applied to 182 galaxies\nin the MgII Absorber-Galaxy Catalog (MAGIICAT, Nielsen et al.) and showed that\nthe mean MgII 2796 equivalent width follows a tight inverse-square power law,\nW_r(2796) ~ (D/R_vir)^-2, with projected location relative to the galaxy virial\nradius and that the MgII absorption covering fraction is invariant with galaxy\nvirial mass, M_h, over the range 10.7 < M_h/M_solar < 13.9. In this work, we\nexplore multivariate relationships between W_r(2796), virial mass, impact\nparameter, virial radius, and the theoretical cooling radius that further\nelucidate self-similarity in the cool/warm (T=10^{4-4.5} K) circumgalactic\nmedium (CGM) with virial mass. We show that virial mass determines the extent\nand strength of the MgII absorbing gas such that the mean W_r(2796) increases\nwith virial mass at fixed distance while decreasing with galactocentric\ndistance for fixed virial mass. The majority of the absorbing gas resides\nwithin D ~ 0.3 R_vir, independent of both virial mass and minimum absorption\nthreshold; inside this region, and perhaps also in the region 0.3 < D/R_vir =\n1, the mean W_r(2796) is independent of virial mass. Contrary to\nabsorber-galaxy cross-correlation studies, we show there is no anti-correlation\nbetween W_r(2796) and virial mass. We discuss how simulations and theory\nconstrained by observations fully support self-similarity of the cool/warm CGM\nvia the physics governing star formation, gas-phase metal enrichment, recycling\nefficiency of galactic scale winds, filament and merger accretion, and\noverdensity of local environment as a function of virial mass. \n\n"}

Our\nmain results are: a) The stellar-to-halo mass ratio is ~0.01 and remains\nroughly constant since z~1 (the stellar MAHs follow closely the halo MAHs),\nwith a smaller value at higher z's for those halos that assemble their mass\nlater. b) The evolution of the galaxy gas fraction, fg, is episodic and higher,\nmost of the time, than the stellar fraction. When fg decreases (increases), the\ngas fraction in the halo typically increases (decreases), showing that the SN\ndriven outflows play an important role in regulating the gas fractions -and\nhence the SFR- of the dwarfs. However, in most cases, an important fraction of\nthe gas escapes the virial radius, Rv; at z=4 the total baryon fraction inside\nRv is 1.5-2 times smaller than the universal one, while at z=0 is 2-6 times\nsmaller, with the earlier assembled halos ejecting more gas. c) The SF\nhistories are episodic with changes in the SFRs of factors 2-10 on average. d)\nAlthough the dwarfs formed in late assembled halos show more extended SF\nhistories, their z~0 SFRs are still below the ones measured for local isolated\ndwarfs. e) The effects of baryons on Mv are such that at almost any time Mv is\n10-20% smaller than the corresponding Mv obtained in pure N-body simulations.\nOur results suggest that rather than increasing the strength of the SN-driven\noutflows, processes that reduce the SF efficiency even more will help to solve\nthe potential issues faced by the CDM-based simulations of dwarfs. \n\n"}

We show that the green valley between the\nblue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxies\nin the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through which\nmost blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. Rather, an analysis that takes\nmorphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blue\nearly-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologies\nare transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly.\nIn contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks,\nand they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation rates\ndecline very slowly. We summarize a range of observations that lead to these\nconclusions, including UV-optical colours and halo masses, which both show a\nstriking dependence on morphological type. We interpret these results in terms\nof the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. We conclude that\nlate-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply of\ngas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustion\nof the remaining gas over several Gyr, driven by secular and/or environmental\nprocesses. In contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gas\nsupply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapid\nquenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disk to spheroid.\nThis gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger,\nwhich in most cases transforms galaxies from disk to elliptical morphology, and\nmergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly AGN\nfeedback. \n\n"}

We found that, apart from\na dense spectrum of unstable radial modes and nonradial $g$- and $p$-modes\ndriven by the $\\kappa$-mechanism due to the partial ionization of H in the\nstellar envelope, some unstable $g$-modes with short pulsation periods are\npowered also by H burning via the $\\varepsilon$-mechanism of mode driving.

The rate at\nwhich MRI-driven turbulence transports angular momentum is related to both the\nstrength of the amplitudes of the fluctuations on various scales and the degree\nof anisotropy of the underlying turbulence. This has motivated several studies\nof the distribution of turbulent power in spectral space. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the anisotropic nature of MRI-driven turbulence using a\npseudo-spectral code and introduce novel ways to robustly characterize the\nunderlying turbulence. We show that the general flow properties vary in a\nquasi-periodic way on timescales comparable to 10 inverse angular frequencies\nmotivating the temporal analysis of its anisotropy. We introduce a 3D tensor\ninvariant analysis to quantify and classify the evolution of the anisotropic\nturbulent flow. This analysis shows a continuous high level of anisotropy, with\nbrief sporadic transitions towards two- and three-component isotropic turbulent\nflow. This temporal-dependent anisotropy renders standard shell-average,\nespecially when used simultaneously with long temporal averages, inadequate for\ncharacterizing MRI-driven turbulence. We propose an alternative way to extract\nspectral information from the turbulent magnetized flow, whose anisotropic\ncharacter depends strongly on time. This consists of stacking 1D Fourier\nspectra along three orthogonal directions that exhibit maximum anisotropy in\nFourier space. The resulting averaged spectra show that the power along each of\nthe three independent directions differs by several orders of magnitude over\nmost scales, except the largest ones.

We extend the analysis of Weidner et al. and consider the\nfunctional form of bottom-heavy IMFs used in recent works, where the high-mass\nend slope is kept fixed to the Salpeter value, and a free parameter is\nintroduced to describe the slope at stellar masses below some pivot mass scale\n(M<MP=0.5Msun).

In general, when the Lagrangian is expanded\naround the vacuum, the strong coupling scale is identified as the mass scale\nthat appears in non-renormalizable operators. In inflationary models, however,\nthe identification of the strong coupling scale is subtle, since the structures\nof the kinetic term as well as the interaction itself can be modified by the\nbackground inflationary dynamics. Therefore, the strong coupling scale depends\non the background. In this letter, we evaluate the strong coupling scale of the\nfluctuations around the background in the Higgs G-inflation including the\nNambu-Goldstone modes associated with the symmetry breaking. We find that the\nsystem is sufficiently weakly coupled when the scales which we now observe exit\nthe horizon during inflation and the observational predictions with the\nsemiclassical treatment are valid.

Our simulations are based on the general relativistic hydrodynamics\ncode AGILE combined with the detailed neutrino transport scheme IDSA for\nelectron neutrinos and ALS for the muon and tau neutrinos.

Our previous paper (Liu et al. 2013) found that\nthe main emissions in the late phase are originated from large-scale loop\narcades that are closely connected to but different from the post flare loops\n(PFLs), and we also proposed that a long cooling process without additional\nheating could explain the late phase.

The existence of a relatively tight\n`ageing sequence' in the colour-equivalent width plane favours a scenario where\nthe secular conversion of gas into stars (i.e. `nature') is the main physical\ndriver of the instantaneous SSFR and the gradual transition from a `chemically\nprimitive' (metal-poor and intensely star-forming) state to a `chemically\nevolved' (metal-rich and passively evolving) system. Nevertheless,\nenvironmental factors (i.e. `nurture') are also important. In the field,\ngalaxies may be temporarily affected by discrete `quenching' and `rejuvenation'\nepisodes, but such events show little statistical significance in a\nprobabilistic sense, and we find no evidence that galaxy interactions are, on\naverage, a dominant driver of star formation.

We present two large-scale AMR MHD simulations of several\nthousand $M_\\odot$ of turbulent, isothermal, self-gravitating gas, one with a\nstrong initial magnetic field (Alfven Mach number $M_{A,0}= 1$) and one with a\nweak initial field ($M_{A,0}=10$). We construct samples of the 100 most massive\nclumps in each simulation and show that they exhibit a power-law relation\nbetween field strength and density in excellent agreement with the observed\none. Our results imply that the average field in molecular clumps in the\ninterstellar medium is $<B_{tot}> \\sim 42 n_{H,4}^{0.65} \\mu$G. Furthermore,\nthe median value of the ratio of the line-of-sight field to density$^{0.65}$ in\nthe simulations is within a factor of about (1.3, 1.7) of the observed value\nfor the strong and weak field cases, respectively. The median value of the\nmass-to-flux ratio, normalized to the critical value, is 70% of the\nline-of-sight value. This is larger than the 50% usually cited for spherical\nclouds because the actual mass-to-flux ratio depends on the volume-weighted\nfield, whereas the observed one depends on the mass-weighted field.

This suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving the\nenhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks of\ngalaxies.

We have studied their\ncombined effect through a suite of 2d simulations of protoplanetary discs\nundergoing X-ray photoevaporation with an embedded giant planet. In a previous\nwork we explored how the formation of a giant planet triggers the dispersal of\nthe inner disc by photo-evaporation at earlier times than what would have\nhappened otherwise. This is particularly relevant for the observed transition\ndiscs with large holes and high mass accretion rates that cannot be explained\nby photo-evaporation alone. In this work we significantly expand the parameter\nspace investigated by previous simulations. In addition, the updated model\nincludes thermal sweeping, needed for studying the complete dispersal of the\ndisc. After the removal of the inner disc the disc is a non accreting\ntransition disc, an object that is rarely seen in observations. We assess the\nrelative length of this phase, to understand if it is long lived enough to be\nfound observationally. Depending on the parameters, especially on the X-ray\nluminosity of the star, we find that the fraction of time spent as a\nnon-accretor greatly varies. We build a population synthesis model to compare\nwith observations and find that in general thermal sweeping is not effective\nenough to destroy the outer disc, leaving many transition discs in a relatively\nlong lived phase with a gas free hole, at odds with observations. We discuss\nthe implications for transition disc evolution.

Furthermore, we find that amongst the barred S0s, there is a\ntrend for the longer and massive bars to be associated with comparatively\nbigger and massive classical bulges -- possibly suggesting bar growth being\nfacilitated by these classical bulges.

We\nfocus on the morphology and kinematics of the neutral hydrogen and how this\ndepends on f_g, the ratio of gas-to-stellar mass within the optical radius.

The method is to integrate\nsimultaneously the rotation and the position of the planet as well as its\ndeformation. We provide the equations of motion both in the body frame and in\nthe inertial frame. With this study, we generalize preexisting models to the\nspatial case and to arbitrary multipole orders using a formalism taken from\nquantum theory. We also provide the vectorial expression of the secular tidal\ntorque expanded in Fourier series.

We\nperform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core\ncluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via\ncollimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via\nstreaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming\ninstability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient\nneeded for AGN feedback to self-regulate, at least within the context of the\nphysical model considered here. When CR streaming is neglected, the suppression\nof CR mixing with the ICM by magnetic fields significantly reduces ICM heating,\nwhich leads to cooling catastrophes. In the opposite case, CRs come into\ncontact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, which results in globally\nstable atmospheres. Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the\ncentral AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present. We find that\nCR streaming heating dominates over the heating due to Coulomb and hadronic\nprocesses. Importantly, in simulations that include CR streaming, CR pressure\nsupport in the central 100 kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate\nobservational constraints. On the contrary, when CR streaming is neglected, CR\nenergy is not spent on the ICM heating and CR pressure builds up to the level\nthat is in disagreement with the data. Overall, our models demonstrate that CR\nheating is a viable channel for the thermalization of AGN energy in clusters,\nand likely also in elliptical galaxies, and that CRs play an important role in\ndetermining AGN intermittency and the dynamical state of cool core atmospheres. \n\n"}

We show that scattering rates involving\ngauge fields can become larger than the expansion rate $H$, due to the very\nlarge occupation numbers, and create a thermal bath of particles of temperature\n$T$ during inflation. In the thermal regime, energy is transferred to smaller\nscales, radically modifying the predictions of this scenario. We thus argue\nthat previous constraints on $\\xi$ are alleviated.

Recently,\nwe have discovered the presence of a variable UFO in the narrow-line Seyfert 1\nIRAS 13224-3809. The UFO varies in response to the brightness of the source. In\nthis work we perform flux-resolved X-ray spectroscopy to study the variability\nof the UFO and found that the ionisation parameter is correlated with the\nluminosity. In the brightest states the gas is almost completely ionised by the\npowerful radiation field and the UFO is hardly detected. This agrees with our\nrecent results obtained with principal component analysis. We might have found\nthe tip of the iceberg: the high ionisation of the outflowing gas may explain\nwhy it is commonly difficult to detect UFOs in AGN and possibly suggest that we\nmay underestimate their actual feedback.

Assuming that bunches are already generated in pulsar\nmagnetospheres, we calculate the spectrum of coherent curvature radiation under\na three-dimensional magnetic field geometry. Different from previous works\nassuming parallel trajectories and a mono-energetic energy distribution of\nelectrons, we consider a bunch characterized by its length, curvature radius of\nthe trajectory family, bunch opening angle, and electron energy distribution.\nWe find that the curvature radiation spectra of the bunches are characterized\nby a multi-segment broken power law, with the break frequencies depending on\nbunch properties and trajectory configuration. We also emphasize that in a\npulsar magnetosphere only the fluctuation of net charges with respect to the\nbackground (Goldreich-Julian) outflow can make a contribution to coherent\nradiation. We apply this model to constrain the observed spectra of pulsars and\nFRBs. For a typical pulsar ($B_p=10^{12}~{\\rm G}$, $P=0.1~{\\rm s}$), a small\nfluctuation of the net charge $\\delta n_{\\rm GJ}\\sim 0.1 n_{\\rm GJ}$ can\nprovide the observable flux. For FRBs, the fluctuating net charge may be larger\ndue to its abrupt nature. For $\\delta n_{\\rm GJ}\\sim n_{\\rm GJ}$, a neutron\nstar with a strong magnetic field and fast rotation is required to power an FRB\nin the spindown-powered model. The requirement is less stringent in the cosmic\ncomb model thanks to the larger cross section and compressed charge density of\nthe bunch made by the external astrophysical stream that combs the\nmagnetosphere. \n\n"}

Within our model, for Sun-like stars, we find\nthat: (1)~the duration of habitable surface water is strongly affected by ocean\nchemistry; (2)~possible ocean pH spans a wide range; (3)~surprisingly, many\nwaterworlds retain habitable surface water for >1 Gyr, and (contrary to\nprevious claims) this longevity does not necessarily involve geochemical\ncycling. The key to this cycle-independent planetary habitability is that C\nexchange between the convecting mantle and the water ocean is curtailed by\nseafloor pressure on waterworlds, so the planet is stuck with the ocean mass\nand ocean cations that it acquires during the first 1% of its history. In our\nmodel, the sum of positive charges leached from the planetary crust by early\nwater-rock interactions is - coincidentally - often within an order of\nmagnitude of the early-acquired atmosphere+ocean inorganic C inventory\noverlaps. As a result, pCO2 is frequently in the \"sweet spot\" (0.2-20 bar) for\nwhich the range of semimajor axis that permits surface liquid water is about as\nwide as it can be. Because the width of the HZ in semimajor axis defines (for\nSun-like stars) the maximum possible time span of surface habitability, this\neffect allows for Gyr of habitability as the star brightens.

However, detailed hydrodynamical models of CEE encounter major\ndifficulties. They show that following the inspiral most of the envelope is not\nejected; though it expands to larger separations, it remains bound to the\nbinary. Here we propose that dust-driven winds can be produced following the\nCEE. These can evaporate the envelope following similar processes operating in\nthe ejection of the envelopes of AGB stars. Pulsations in an AGB-star drives\nthe expansion of its envelope, allowing the material to cool down to low\ntemperatures thus enabling dust condensation. Radiation pressure on the dust\naccelerates it, and through its coupling to the gas it drives winds which\neventually completely erode the envelope.

The optical spectrum is dominated by a blue continuum\ntogether with emission lines of hydrogen, neutral and ionized helium, and the N\nIII, C III blend at around 4640-4650 Angstrom. The emission line profiles vary\nin strength and position on timescales as short as 1 day, while optical\nphotometry reveals fluctuations of as much as ~0.2 mag in g on timescales as\nshort as 10-15 min.

In this paper, we investigate the\nhypothesis that only certain mass accretion rates result in detectable bandhead\nemission in the near infrared spectra of MYSOs. Using an analytic disc model\ncombined with an LTE model of the CO emission, we find that high accretion\nrates ($\\gtrsim 10^{-4}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}{\\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$) result in large\ndust sublimation radii, a larger contribution to the $K$-band continuum from\nhot dust at the dust sublimation radius, and therefore correspondingly lower CO\nemission with respect to the continuum.

The\nformula depends on the binary fraction; the mass function of the secondary\nstars; and the true occurrence of planets around primaries, secondaries, and\nsingle stars.

From the SPHERE\ndata we obtain a low resolution spectrum of the companion from Y to H band, as\nwell as two narrow band-width photometric measurements in the K band. A study\nof the primary star allows in addition to constrain the age of the system as\nwell as its distance. Thanks to the new SPHERE epoch and NACO archival data\ncombined with previous imaging data and high precision radial velocity\nmeasurements, we have been able to derive a well constrained orbit. We derive a\ndynamical mass of mB=70.0$\\pm$1.6 MJup which is higher than a previous study,\nbut in better agreement with the models.

Spectral signatures of hybrid disk configurations Abstract: It has been suggested that the cycles of activity of X-ray Binaries (XrB) are\ntriggered by a switch in the dominant disk torque responsible for accretion\n(paper I). As the disk accretion rate increases, the disk innermost regions\nwould change from a jet-emitting disk (JED) to a standard accretion disk (SAD).\nWhile JEDs have been proven to successfully reproduce hard states (paper II),\nthe existence of an outer cold SAD introduces an extra non local cooling term.\nWe investigate the thermal structure and associated spectra of such a hybrid\ndisk configuration. We use the 2T plasma code elaborated in paper II, allowing\nto compute outside-in the disk local thermal equilibrium with self-consistent\nadvection and optically thin-to-thick transitions, in both radiation and gas\nsupported regimes. The non-local inverse Compton cooling introduced by the\nexternal soft photons is computed by the BELM code. This additional term has a\nprofound influence on JED solutions, allowing a smooth temperature transition\nfrom the outer SAD to the inner JED. We explore the full parameter space in\ndisk accretion rate and transition radius, and show that the whole domain in\nX-ray fluxes and hardness ratios covered by standard XrB cycles is well\nreproduced by such hybrid configurations. Precisely, a reasonable combination\nof these parameters allows to reproduce the 3-200 keV spectra of five canonical\nXrB states. Along with X-ray signatures, JED-SAD configurations also naturally\naccount for the radio emission whenever it is observed. By varying only the\ntransition radius and the accretion rate, hybrid disk configurations combining\nan inner JED and an outer SAD are able to reproduce simultaneously the X-ray\nspectral states and radio emission of X-ray binaries during their outburst.\nAdjusting these two parameters, it is then possible to reproduce a full cycle.\nThis will be shown in a forthcoming paper (paper IV). \n\n"}

The field makes electrons\ncoherently oscillate and emit the coherent dipole radiations ( FRBs ). The\nradiations stop when thermal fluctuations produced by the oscillation disturb\nthe coherent oscillations. Thus, the duration of the FRBs is determined by the\ntime scale of the thermalization; it is much shorter than $1$ms. Line spectra\nof the dipole radiations are broadened by the thermal effects. The thermally\nbroaden spectra have a feature that the bandwidths $\\delta\\nu$ are proportional\nto their center frequencies $\\nu_c$. The presence of various center frequencies\n( $1.2$GHz$\\sim $$7$GHz ) in repeating FRB 121102 is attributed to Doppler\nshifts owing to the various relativistic velocities of the accretion disk. On\nthe other hand, non repeating FRBs do not show such variety of the center\nfrequencies. They come from the surfaces of neutron stars.

We have used mid-infrared data from the Wide-field\nInfrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalogue to search for the host galaxies of 65\nstrongly-scintillating MWA sources and compare their properties with those of\nthe overall population of bright low-frequency radio sources. We identified\nWISE mid-infrared counterparts for 91% of the bright sources in a single 900\nsquare degree MWA field, and found that the hosts of the strongly-scintillating\nsources were typically at least 1 mag fainter in the WISE W1 (3.4 micron) band\nthan the hosts of weakly-scintillating MWA sources of similar radio flux\ndensity.

The Bremsstrahlung cooling of the gas in the ADAF, with temperatures\nranging from a few keV to a few tens of keV, can account for the X-ray emission\nproperties of quiescent DN. If the energy advected by the flow is thermalized\nin the WD atmosphere, the resulting emission from the entire stellar surface\n(blackbody of temperature T_eff ~ 5 eV) outshines the X-ray luminosity\nsubstantially.

In the case of PKS 2349-01, however, the inferred\nproperties of the line depend on the model adopted for the continuum: if a\nsimple power-law model is used, the line is resolved at more than 99%\nconfidence with a full width at half maximum corresponding to approximately\n50,000 km/s and a rest-frame equivalent width of 230 +/- 120 eV, but if a\nCompton \"reflection\" model is used the line is found to be a factor of 2\nweaker, for an assumed full width at half maximum of 50,000 km/s. In 4C 74.26,\na strong Compton \"reflection\" component is detected. Its strength suggests that\nthe scattering medium subtends a solid angle of 2pi to the illuminating source.\nOverall, the spectral indices of these radio-loud quasars are remarkably\nsimilar to those of their radio-quiet counterparts. On the other hand, if the\nabsorber is indeed neutral, as our results suggest, this would be consistent\nwith the typical properties of radio-loud AGNs. \n\n"}

The natural state of the low-entropy\ncentral gas in clusters thus appears to be to slosh subsonically in the central\npotential well, with several interesting implications. Hydrostatic equilibrium\nis not reached and the hydrostatic total mass estimates cannot be valid at\nsmall radii (r<100 kpc).

The only viable means of achieving inflow from kiloparsec\nscales is through gravitational stresses created by bars and/or mergers. The\ninflow of gas in bars today appears to stall at a radius of few hundred parsec,\nhowever, forming a nuclear ring. Here we suggest that bars in the early\nUniverse may have avoided this problem, and propose that the progenitors of\ncentral supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are created by gas that is driven deep\ninto the centers of galaxies by bars in the early stages of disk formation. The\ncoincidence of the QSO epoch with galaxy formation, the short lifetimes of\nQSOs, and the existence of SMBHs in the centers of most bright galaxies are all\nnaturally accounted for by disk dynamics in this model. The progenitor SMBHs\nare the seeds for brighter QSO flares during galaxy mergers. We present a new\nstudy of bar weakening by central mass concentrations, which shows that bars\nare less easily destroyed than previously thought. An extremely massive and\ncompact central mass can, however, dissolve the bar, which creates a\npseudo-bulge component in the center of the disk. \n\n"}

ROSAT observations of the\n  intracluster medium Abstract: We have made ROSAT PSPC and HRI X-ray observations to study the intracluster\ngas surrounding the powerful radio source Hercules A. The cluster is luminous\nin X-rays (L_bol = 4.8x10^37 W), and the host of the radio source is the\ncentral dominating galaxy of the cluster. The X-ray surface brightness profile\nis well fitted by a modified King beta model, but the cluster is elongated\nparallel to the radio source, especially on the scale of the radio lobes. Fits\nto individual quadrants give a core radius 50 per cent larger along the radio\naxis. Part of this elongation appears to be associated with enhanced X-ray\nemission superimposed on the outer radio lobes. There are no obvious\ndepressions in the X-ray emission coincident with the radio lobes, as expected\nif the relativistic plasma displaces the ICM. However, we show that these\ndepressions may be quite weak. From the surface brightness profile for the PSPC\ndata the X-ray emission extends out to ~ 2.2 Mpc radius. In the absence of the\npowerful jets, we would expect a cooling flow at the centre of the cluster, but\ncurrently it must be substantially disturbed by the expansion of the radio\nlobes. The PSPC spectrum reveals a cool component of the ICM with 0.5 < kT < 1\nkeV. The central cooling time could be as low as 2 Gyr if the cool component is\ncentrally concentrated, otherwise it is around 6 Gyr.

Starting with a slowly rotating white dwarf,\nwe simulate the accretion of matter and angular momentum from a quasi-Keplerian\naccretion disk. The role of the various rotationally induced hydrodynamic\ninstabilities for the transport of angular momentum inside the white dwarf is\ninvestigated. We find that the dynamical shear instability is the most\nimportant one in the highly degenerate core. Our results imply that accreting\nwhite dwarfs rotate differentially throughout,with a shear rate close to the\nthreshold value for the onset of the dynamical shear instability. As the latter\ndepends on the temperature of the white dwarf, the thermal evolution of the\nwhite dwarf core is found to be relevant for the angular momentum\nredistribution. As found previously, significant rotation is shown to lead to\ncarbon ignition masses well above 1.4 Msun. Our models suggest a wide range of\nwhite dwarf explosion masses, which could be responsible for some aspects of\nthe diversity observed in SNe Ia. We analyze the potential role of the bar-mode\nand the r-mode instability in rapidly rotating white dwarfs, which may impose\nangular momentum loss by gravitational wave radiation.

We\ndemonstrate that the anisotropy could be due to neutrons created at the\nGalactic Center through charge-exchange in proton-proton collisions, where the\nincident, high energy protons obey an $\\sim E^{-2}$ power law associated with\nacceleration at a strong shock.

Studied\nextensively in OVI absorption, these clouds are usually assumed to be infalling\ngas in the Galactic halo at distances less than 50 kpc. An alternative model\nattributes the OVI (and OVII X-ray absorption) to cosmological structures of\nlow-density, shock-heated intergalactic gas, distributed over 1-3 Mpc\nsurrounding the Milky Way. The latter interpretation is unlikely, owing to the\nenormous required mass of gas (4x10^12 M_solar). Our detection, in 9 of 12\nsight lines, of low ionization stages (CII/III/IV; SiII/III/IV) at similar high\nvelocities as OVI requires gas densities far above that (n_H=5x10^-6 cm^-3)\nassociated with the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM).

Using a 3D MHD code with adaptive mesh\nrefinement developed for this purpose, we have investigated the r\\^ole of\nmagnetized matter circulation between the gaseous disk and the surrounding\ngalactic halo. Special emphasis has been put on the effect of the magnetic\nfield with respect to the volume and mass fractions of the different ISM\n``phases'', the relative importance of ram, thermal and magnetic pressures, and\nwhether the field can prevent matter transport from the disk into the halo. The\nsimulations were performed on a grid with an area of 1 kpc$^{2}$, centered on\nthe solar circle, extending $\\pm 10$ kpc perpendicular to the galactic disk\nwith a resolution as high as 1.25 pc.

Abstract: The clustering pattern in high redshift HI maps is expected to be anisotropic\ndue to two distinct reasons, the\n  Alcock-Paczynski effect and the peculiar velocities, both of which are\nsensitive to the cosmological parameters. The signal is also expected to be\nsensitive to the details of the HI distribution at the epoch when the radiation\noriginated. We use simple models for the HI distribution at the epoch of\nreionizaation and the post-reionization era to investigate exactly what we hope\nto learn from future observations of the anisotropy pattern in HI maps. We find\nthat such observations will probably tell us more about the HI distribution\nthan about the background cosmological model. Assuming that reionization can be\ndescribed by spherical, ionized bubbles all of the same size with their centers\npossibly being biased with respect to the dark matter, we find that the\nanisotropy pattern at small angles is expected to have a bump at the\ncharacteristic angular size of the individual bubbles whereas the large scale\nanisotropy pattern will reflect the size and the bias of the bubbles. The\nanisotropy also depends on the background cosmological parameters, but the\ndependence is much weaker. Under the assumption that the HI in the\npost-reionization era traces the dark matter with a possible bias, we find that\nchanging the bias and changing the background cosmology has similar effects on\nthe anisotropy pattern. Combining observations of the anisotropy with\nindependent estimates of the bias, possibly from the bi-spectrum, may allow\nthese observations to constrain cosmological parameters. \n\n"}

We compare the observed genus statistic\nG\\nu_f) to predictions for a Gaussian random field and to the genus measured\nfor mock surveys constructed from new large-volume simulations of the LambdaCDM\ncosmology. In this analysis we carefully examine the dependence of the observed\ngenus statistic on the Gaussian smoothing scale R_G from 3.5 to 11 h^-1Mpc and\non the luminosity of galaxies over the range -22.50<M_r<-18.5. The void\nmultiplicity A_V is less than unity at all smoothing scales. Because A_V cannot\nbecome less than 1 through gravitational evolution, this result provides strong\nevidence for biased galaxy formation in low density environments. We also find\nclear evidence of luminosity bias of topology within the volume-limited\nsub-samples. The shift parameter Delta nu indicates that the genus of brighter\ngalaxies shows a negative shift toward a ``meatball'' (i.e. cluster-dominated)\ntopology, while faint galaxies show a positive shift toward a ``bubble'' (i.e.\nvoid-dominated) topology. The transition from negative to positive shift occurs\napproximately at the characteristic absolute magnitude M_{r*}=-20.4.

We analyse the\ninfluence of the adopted solar mixture on the opacity in the convective\nenvelope of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars and thus on PMS lithium depletion.\nThe surface Li abundance depends on the relative efficiency of several\nprocesses, some of them still not known with the required precision; this paper\nthus analyses one of the aspects of this ``puzzle''. Focusing on PMS evolution,\nwhere the largest amount of Li burning occurs, we computed stellar models for\nthree selected masses (0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 Msun, with Z=0.013, Y=0.27, alpha=1.9)\nby varying the chemical mixture, that is the internal element distribution in\nZ. We analysed the contribution of the single elements to the opacity at the\ntemperatures and densities of interest for Li depletion. Several mixtures were\nobtained by varying the abundance of the most important elements one at a time;\nwe then calculated the corresponding PMS Li abundance evolution. We found that\na mixture variation does change the Li abundance: at fixed total metallicity,\nthe Li depletion increases when increasing the fraction of elements heavier\nthan O. \n\n"}

The radio emission occurs on three different spatial scales, from ~7.5\nkpc bubbles to ~1.5 kpc bubbles lying nearly orthogonal to them and a ~1 kpc\nradio jet lying orthogonal to the kpc-scale bubble. To explain the complex\nmorphology, we first consider a scenario in which the radio structures are the\nresult of superwinds ejected by a nuclear starburst. However, recent Spitzer\nobservations of Mrk 6 provide an upper limit to the star formation rate (SFR)\nof ~5.5 M_sun/yr, an estimate much lower than the SFR of ~33 M_sun/yr derived\nassuming that the bubbles are a result of starburst winds energized by\nsupernovae explosions. Thus, a starburst alone cannot meet the energy\nrequirements for the creation of the bubbles in Mrk 6.

This model is the most attractive as it can naturally explain the\ncomplex radio morphology, and is consistent with the energetics, the spectral\nindex and the polarization structure.

In this paper, dark energy (DE) is shown to\nresult from the violation of WEP by pressureless (dark) matter. This allows us\nto build a new cosmological framework in which general relativity (GR) is\nsatisfied at low scales, as WEP violation depends on the ratio of the ordinary\nmatter over dark matter densities, but at large scales, we obtain a general\nrelativity-like theory with a different value of the gravitational coupling.\nThis explanation is formulated in terms of a tensor-scalar theory of\ngravitation without WEP for which there exists a revisited convergence\nmechanism toward GR.

We find that radiative heating is a key factor in the\nself-regulated coevolution of massive black holes and their host galaxies and\nthat 1) the mass accumulated by the central black hole is limited by feedback\nto the range observed today, and 2) relaxation instabilities occur so that duty\ncycles are small enough (~0.03) to account for the very small fraction of\nmassive ellipticals observed to be in the \"on\" -QSO- phase, when the accretion\nluminosity approaches the Eddington luminosity.

In this paper we use self-gravitating monopole solutions\nas tools for investigating the transition between these two types of\nspacetimes. We show how causally distinct regions emerge as the black hole\nlimit is achieved, even though the measurements made by an external observer\nvary continuously. We find that near-critical solutions have a naturally\ndefined entropy, despite the absence of a true horizon, and that this has a\nclear connection with the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy. We find that certain\nclasses of near-critical solutions display naked black hole behavior, although\nthey are not truly black holes at all. Finally, we present a numerical\nsimulation illustrating how an incident pulse of matter can induce the\ndynamical collapse of a monopole into an extremal black hole. We discuss the\nimplications of this process for the third law of black hole thermodynamics. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-th/0301138", "contents": "Title: Brane inflation and reheating Abstract: We study inflation and reheating in a brane world model derived from Type IIA\nstring theory. This particular setup is based on a model of string mediated\nsupersymmetry breaking. The inflaton is one of the transverse scalars of a\nD4-brane which has one of its spatial dimensions stretched between two\nNS5-branes, so that it is effectively three-dimensional. This D4-brane is\nattracted to a D6-brane that is separated from the 5-branes by a fixed amount.\nThe potential of the transverse scalar due to the D4/D6 interaction makes a\ngood inflaton potential. As the D4-brane slides along the two 5-branes towards\nthe 6-brane it begins to oscillate near the minimum of the potential. The\ninflaton field couples to the massless Standard Model fields through Yukawa\ncouplings. In the brane picture these couplings are introduced by having\nanother D6'-brane intersect the D4-brane such that the 4-6' strings, whose\nlowest lying modes are the Standard Model matter, couple to the scalar mode of\nthe 4-4 strings, the inflaton. The inflaton can decay into scalar and spinor\nparticles on the 4-6' strings, reheating the universe. Observational data is\nused to place constraints on the parameters of the model. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-th/0403020", "contents": "Title: Beyond Inflation: A Cyclic Universe Scenario Abstract: Inflation has been the leading early universe scenario for two decades, and\nhas become an accepted element of the successful `cosmic concordance' model.\nHowever, there are many puzzling features of the resulting theory. It requires\nboth high energy and low energy inflation, with energy densities differing by a\nhundred orders of magnitude. The questions of why the universe started out\nundergoing high energy inflation, and why it will end up in low energy\ninflation, are unanswered. Rather than resort to anthropic arguments, we have\ndeveloped an alternative cosmology, the Cyclic universe, in which the universe\nexists in a very long-lived attractor state determined by the laws of physics.\nThe model shares inflation's phenomenological successes without requiring an\nepoch of high energy inflation. Instead, the universe is made homogeneous and\nflat, and scale-invariant adiabatic perturbations are generated during an epoch\nof low energy acceleration like that seen today, but preceding the last big\nbang. Unlike inflation, the model requires low energy acceleration in order for\na periodic attractor state to exist. The key challenge facing the scenario is\nthat of passing through the cosmic singularity at t=0. Substantial progress has\nbeen made at the level of linearised gravity, which is reviewed here. The\nchallenge of extending this to nonlinear gravity and string theory remains. \n\n"}

Similar change over also occurs in\napproach to singularity in loop quantum gravity. It is analogous to Planck's\nlaw of radiation where similar change occurs for high and low energy behavior.\nThis is how it seems to anticipate in qualitative terms and in the right sense\nthe quantum gravity effect in 5 dimensions where it is physically non-trivial.\nThe really interesting question is, could this desirable feature be brought\ndown to the $4-$dimensional spacetime by dilatonic coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet\nterm or otherwise? \n\n"}
