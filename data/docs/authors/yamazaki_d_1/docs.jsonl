We identify the star-forming areas in the galaxy by\nremoving a smooth disk component from the optical images. We construct\npixel-by-pixel maps of stellar age and stellar mass surface density in these\nregions by comparing their observed colors with simple stellar populations\nsynthesized with STARBURST99. We find that an older burst occurred about 100\nMyr ago within the inner 4 kpc and that a younger burst happened in the last 10\nMyr mostly at galactocentric radii between 4 and 8 kpc. We analyze the stellar\npopulations residing in the known HI holes of IC2574.

To minimize this effect, we consider two models of\nparticle production in a sector that is only gravitationally coupled to the\ninflaton.

Motivated by these\nobservations, people begun considering new inflationary models which may lead\nto statistical anisotropy. The simplest possible way to construct anisotropic\ninflation is to introduce vector fields.

Then, we work out the proper\nviability conditions to guarantee in the scalar sector the absence of ghosts,\ngradient and tachyonic instabilities. The absence of ghosts can be achieved by\ndemanding a positive kinetic matrix, while the lack of a gradient instability\nis ensured by imposing a positive speed of propagation for all the scalar\nmodes. In case of tachyonic instability, the mass eigenvalues have been studied\nand we work out the appropriate expressions. For the latter, an instability\noccurs only when the negative mass eigenvalue is much larger, in absolute\nvalue, than the Hubble parameter.

It is this oversight that this article aims to amend. In\nfact, it demonstrates that the inclusion of such singularities allows one to\nproduce a number of very interesting scenarios of cosmological evolution. For\nexample, it produces the cosmological models with a finite value of the\nequation of state parameter $w=p/\\rho$ even when both the energy density and\nthe pressure diverge, while at the same time keeping the scale factor finite.\nSuch a dynamics is shown to be possible only when the scale factor experiences\na finite jump at some moment of time.

Both a relativistic structured jet viewed off-axis and a mildly\nrelativistic quasi-spherical outflow can explain the observational data of\nGW170817 up to ~260 days. We utilize a physically motivated analytic\ntwo-parameter model called the \"boosted fireball\" for the outflow structure\nafter it has expanded far from the merger site and has entered the self-similar\ncoasting phase. This model consists of a family of outflows with a structure\nvarying smoothly between a highly collimated ultra-relativistic jet and an\nisotropic fireball. We simulate the dynamical evolution, starting with \"boosted\nfireball\" initial conditions, of 240 outflows using the moving-mesh\nrelativistic hydrodynamics code JET to follow their evolution through the\nafterglow phase.

In this paper, we provide a minimal example for such a mechanism\nand show how the Planck mass can be dynamically generated in a strongly coupled\ngauge sector. We consider the case of hidden SU(N_c) gauge interactions that\nlink the Planck mass to the condensation of a scalar bilinear operator that is\nnonminimally coupled to curvature.

He also pointed out that small\nnonaxisymmetric temperature variations in the accreted crust will lead to\n\"wavy\" electron capture layers, whose horizontal density variations naturally\ncreate a mass quadrupole moment.\n  We present a full calculation of the crust's elastic adjustment to these\ndensity perturbations and find that the elastic response of the crust reduces\nBildsten's original estimate of the quadrupole moment in the thin outer crust\nby a factor of 20-50. However, this basic picture, when applied to capture\nlayers in the deep inner crust, can generate quadrupoles in the necessary range\nas long as there are ~5% lateral temperature variations in the inner crust.

This problem is particularly challenging because\nof the vast dynamical range in space which must be covered in the course of\ncol- lapse. We evolve a uniformly rotating SMS from the onset of radial\ninstability at R_{p}/M=411, where R_{p} is the proper polar radius of the star\nand M is the total mass-energy, to the point at which the PN approximation\nbreaks down. We introduce a scale factor and a \"comoving\" coordinate to handle\nthe large varia- tion in radius during the collapse and focus on the central\ncore. Since T/W, the ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the\ngravitational binding energy, is nearly proportional to 1/R_{p} throughout the\ncollapse, the imploding star may ultimately exceed the critical value of T/W\nfor dynamical instability to bar-mode formation. However, for stars rotating\nuniformly at the onset of col- lapse, we do not find any unstable growth of\nbars prior to the termination of our simulation.

This alleviates the classical\nproblem of the curious energy scale of order a millielectronvolt associated\nwith a constant Lambda. Dark energy may have been detected by recent advances\nin the cosmological tests. The tests establish a good scientific case for the\ncontext, in the relativistic Friedmann-Lemaitre model, including the\ngravitational inverse square law applied to the scales of cosmology.

However, the fact that Lambda is a dimension-four parameter implies\nthat it may obey a peculiar renormalization group equation, which at low\nenergies could be dominated by ``soft decoupling'' contributions of the form\nLambda ~ H^2 M_P^2 stemming from physics near the Planck scale. This value lies\nin the ballpark of the measurements from CMB and high-z supernovae.

When\ntaking interactions into account, it is essential to employ a self-consistent\noff-equilibrium formalism to study the evolution of the inflationary background\nfield and its fluctuations with the back-reaction effects. Within the Hartree\nfactorization scheme, we show that the O(N) model has at least two observable\nremains left behind the off-equilibrium processes: the running spectral index\nof primordial density perturbations and the correlations between perturbation\nmodes in phase space. We find that the running of the spectral index is fully\ndetermined by the rate of the energy transfer from the inflationary background\nfield to its fluctuations via particle creation processes as well as the\ndynamics of the background field itself. Furthermore, the amplitude of the\nfield fluctuations turns out to be scale-dependent due to the off-equilibrium\nevolution. As a consequence, the scale-dependence of fluctuations yields a\ncorrelation between the phase space modes of energy density perturbations,\nwhile the one-point function of the fluctuations in each Hartree mode is still\nGaussian.

For example, merging binary neutron stars can form a \"hypermassive\"\nremnant, i.e. a differentially rotating star with a mass greater than the\nmaximum allowed by uniform rotation. The removal of the centrifugal support\nprovided by differential rotation can lead to delayed collapse of the remnant\nto a black hole, accompanied by a burst of gravitational radiation. Both\nmagnetic fields and viscosity alter the structure of differentially rotating\nstars on secular timescales, making numerical tracking of the evolution\ndifficult.

Abstract: Understanding gravitational collapse requires understanding how $\\sim\n10^{58}$ nucleons can be destroyed in $\\sim 10^{-5}$ seconds. The recent\nproposal that the endpoint of gravitational collapse can be a \"dark energy\nstar\" implies that the mass-energy of the nucleons undergoing gravitational\ncollapse can be converted to vacuum energy when one gets near to conditions\nwhere classical general relativity predicts that a trapped surface would form.\nThe negative pressure associated with a large vacuum energy prevents an event\nhorizon from forming, thus resolving the long-standing puzzle as to why\ngravitational collapse always leads to an explosion. An indirect consequence is\nthat the reverse process - creation of matter from vacuum energy - should also\nbe possible. Indeed this process may be responsible for the \"big bang\".

The formation and early evolution of a PNS are\nfollowed with a grid of 2500 x 2500 zones, which provides better resolution\nthan in previous (Newtonian) studies. We confirm that significant differential\nrotation results even when the rotation of the progenitor is initially uniform.\nConsequently, the magnetic field is amplified both by magnetic winding and the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI). Even if the magnetic energy E_EM is much\nsmaller than the rotational kinetic energy T_rot at the time of PNS formation,\nthe ratio E_EM/T_rot increases to 0.1-0.2 by the magnetic winding. Following\nPNS formation, MHD outflows lead to losses of rest mass, energy, and angular\nmomentum from the system. The earliest outflow is produced primarily by the\nincreasing magnetic stress caused by magnetic winding. The MRI amplifies the\npoloidal field and increases the magnetic stress, causing further angular\nmomentum transport and helping to drive the outflow. After the magnetic field\nsaturates, a nearly stationary, collimated magnetic field forms near the\nrotation axis and a Blandford-Payne type outflow develops along the field\nlines.

This algorithm is demonstrated by application to the distribution\nof quasars between redshifts of $z=1$ and $z\\approx4,$ i.e., at a comoving\ndistance from the observer $1700 h^{-1}\\mbox{\\rm Mpc} \\ltapprox d \\ltapprox\n3300 h^{-1}\\mbox{\\rm Mpc}.$ Two pairs of isometric quintuplets separated by\nmore than {$300$\\hMpc} are found. This is consistent with the number expected\nfrom Monte Carlo simulations in a simply connected Universe if the detailed\nanisotropy of sky coverage by the individual quasar surveys is taken into\naccount. The linear transformation in (flat) comoving space from one quintuplet\nto another requires translations of {$353$\\hMpc} and {4922\\hMpc} respectively,\nplus a reflection in the former case, and plus both a rotation and a reflection\nin the latter. Since reflections are required, if these two matches were due to\nmulti-connectedness, then the Universe would be non-orientable. \n\n"}

In particular, we present an alternate\ncosmology, one based on conformal gravity, a theory whose effective\ncosmological $G_{eff}$ not only differs from the Cavendish one by being\naltogether smaller than it, but, by even being explicitly negative, naturally\nleads to cosmological repulsion.

The emphasis is on the perspective of the low-energy effective theory in\norder to see how it addresses the problem of why low-energy particles like the\nelectron do not contribute too large a vacuum energy. This is followed by a\ndiscussion of the main objections, which are grouped into the following five\ntopics:\n  (1) Weinberg's No-Go Theorem.\n  (2) Are hidden tunings of the theory required, and a problem?\n  (3) Why should the mechanism not rule out earlier epochs of inflation?\n  (4) How big are quantum effects, and which are the most dangerous?\n  (5) Can the mechanism be consistent with cosmological constraints?\n  It is argued that there are plausible reasons why the mechanism can thread\nthe potential objections, but that a definitive proof that it does depends on\naddressing well-defined technical points.

The physical eigenmasses of these modes acquire a large\nuniversal tachyonic contribution -12d/(d+2) H^2, independently of the\nstabilization mechanism for the compact space, in addition to the usual KK\nmasses, which instead encode the effects of the stabilization. General\narguments, as well as specific examples, lead us to conjecture that, for\nsufficiently large dS curvature, the compactified geometry becomes\ngravitationally unstable due to the tachyonic growth of the scalar\nperturbations. This mean that for any stabilization mechanism the curvature of\nthe dS geometry cannot exceed some critical value.

Interactions and\nrenormalization of these boundary terms allow us to apply to the boundary terms\nthe field-theoretical requirement of naturalness, i.e. stability under\nradiative corrections. We apply this requirement to slow-roll inflation with\nnon-adiabatic initial conditions, and to cyclic cosmology. This allows us to\ndefine in a precise sense when some of these models are fine-tuned. We also\ndescribe how to parametrize in a model-independent way non-Gaussian initial\nconditions; we show that in some cases they are both potentially observable and\npass our naturalness requirement. \n\n"}

They do not have the lower bound on the mass.\nWe also give a positive energy argument in higher dimensions and realise that\nelementary fermion cannot exist in our examples. \n\n"}

Also, there are some indications that the radical version of the\nholographic theory in the context of cosmology may have problems with unitarity\nand causality. Another formulation of the holographic principle, due to\nFischler and Susskind, implies that the entropy of matter inside the\npost-inflationary particle horizon must be smaller than the area of the\nhorizon. Their conjecture was very successful for a wide class of open and flat\nuniverses, but it did not apply to closed universes. Bak and Rey proposed a\ndifferent holographic bound on entropy which was valid for closed universes of\na certain type. However, as we will show, neither proposal applies to open,\nflat and closed universes with matter and a small negative cosmological\nconstant. We will argue, in agreement with Easther, Lowe, and Veneziano, that\nwhenever the holographic constraint on the entropy inside the horizon is valid,\nit follows from the Bekenstein-Hawking bound on the black hole entropy. These\nconstraints do not allow one to rule out closed universes and other universes\nwhich may experience gravitational collapse, and do not impose any constraints\non inflationary cosmology. \n\n"}

The black hole emission spectrum is an incomplete\ngamma function of (T_H - T_S). For T_H << T_S, it yields the QFT-Hawking\nemission. For T_H \\to T_S, it shows highly massive string states dominate the\nemission and undergo a typical string phase transition to a microscopic\n`minimal' black hole of mass M_{\\min} or radius r_{\\min} (inversely\nproportional to T_S) and string temperature T_S. The semiclassical QFT black\nhole (of mass M and temperature T_H) and the string black hole (of mass M_{min}\nand temperature T_S) are mapped one into another by a `Dual' transform which\nlinks classical/QFT and quantum string regimes.

{"id": "physics/0406139", "contents": "Title: On the Clock Paradox in the case of circular motion of the moving clock Abstract: In this paper we deal analytically with a version of the so called clock\nparadox in which the moving clock performs a circular motion of constant\nradius. The rest clock is denoted as (1), the rotating clock is (2), the\ninertial frame in which (1) is at rest and (2) moves is I and, finally, the\naccelerated frame in which (2) is at rest and (1) rotates is A. By using the\nGeneral Theory of Relativity in order to describe the motion of (1) as seen in\nA we will show the following features. I) A differential aging between (1) and\n(2) occurs at their reunion and it has an absolute character, i.e. the proper\ntime interval measured by a given clock is the same both in I and in A. II)\n  From a quantitative point of view, the magnitude of the differential aging\nbetween (1) and (2) does depend on the kind of rotational motion performed by\nA. Indeed, if it is uniform there is no any tangential force in the direction\nof motion of (2) but only normal to it. In this case, the proper time interval\nreckoned by (2) does depend only on its constant velocity v=romega. On the\ncontrary, if the rotational motion is uniformly accelerated, i.e. a constant\nforce acts tangentially along the direction of motion, the proper time\nintervals $do depend$ on the angular acceleration alpha. III) Finally, in\nregard to the sign of the aging, the moving clock (2) measures always a\n$shorter$ interval of proper time with respect to (1). \n\n"}
