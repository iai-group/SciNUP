Short duration GRBs (SGRBs) are thought to have typically lower\nenergies than long duration bursts, can be found in galaxies with populations\nof all ages and are likely to originate from different progenitors to the long\nduration bursts. However, it has become clear that duration alone is\ninsufficient to make a distinction between the two populations in many cases,\nleading to a desire to find additional discriminators of burst type. GRB\n060912A had a duration of 6 s and occurred only ~10 arcsec from a bright, low\nredshift ($z=0.0936$) elliptical galaxy, suggesting that this may have been the\nhost, which would favour it being a short-burst.

This system of PDEs, similar\nin structure to the Dirac equations, has gap soliton solutions that travel at\nany speed between 0 and the speed of light. A recently considered strategy for\nspatial trapping or capture of gap optical soliton light pulses is based on the\nappropriate design of localized defects in the periodic structure. Localized\ndefects in the periodic structure give rise to defect modes, which persist as\n{\\it nonlinear defect modes} as the amplitude is increased. Soliton trapping is\nthe transfer of incoming soliton energy to {\\it nonlinear} defect modes. To\nserve as targets for such energy transfer, nonlinear defect modes must be\nstable. We therefore investigate the stability of nonlinear defect modes.\nResonance among discrete localized modes and radiation modes plays a role in\nthe mechanism for stability and instability, in a manner analogous to the\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger / Gross-Pitaevskii (NLS/GP) equation.

A Unified Approach to the\n  Dielectric Constant, the Spontaneous Emission and the Zero-Temperature\n  Electromagnetic Pressure Abstract: We study from a critical perspective several quantum-electrodynamic phenomena\ncommonly related to vacuum electromagnetic (EM) fluctuations in complex media.\nWe compute the resonance-shift, the spontaneous emission rate, the local\ndensity of states and the van-der-Waals-Casimir pressure in a dielectric medium\nusing a microscopic diagrammatic approach. We find, in agreement with some\nrecent works, that these effects cannot be attributed to variations on the\nenergy of the EM vacuum but to variations of the dielectric self-energy. This\nenergy is the result of the interaction of the bare polarizability of the\ndielectric constituents with the EM fluctuations of an actually polarized\nvacuum. We have found an exact expression for the spectrum of these\nfluctuations in a statistically homogeneous dielectric. Those fluctuations turn\nout to be different to the ones of normal radiative modes. It is the latter\nthat carry the zero-point-energy (ZPE). Concerning spontaneous emission, we\nclarify the nature of the radiation and the origin of the so-called local field\nfactors. Essential discrepancies are found with respect to previous works.

A nonlinear\ntransformation also modifies the redshift space distortions in the same limit,\ngiving rise to a velocity bias. In models with primordial nongaussianity a\nnonlinear transformation generates a scale dependent bias on large scales. We\nderive analytic expressions for these for a general nonlinear transformation.\nThese biases can be expressed entirely in terms of the one point distribution\nfunction (PDF) of the final field and the parameters of the transformation. Our\nanalysis allows one to devise nonlinear transformations with nearly arbitrary\nbias properties, which can be used to increase the signal in the large scale\nclustering limit. We apply the results to the ionizing equilibrium model of\nLyman-alpha forest, in which Lyman-alpha flux F is related to the density\nperturbation delta via a nonlinear transformation.

We analyzed more than 40 months of data acquired by the\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope in the\nHE domain, and gathered all of the relevant multi-wavelength (from radio to VHE\ngamma-rays) information about the broadband nonthermal emission from RCW 86.\nFor this purpose, we re-analyzed the archival X-ray data from the ASCA/Gas\nImaging Spectrometer (GIS), the XMM-Newton/EPIC-MOS, and the RXTE/Proportional\nCounter Array (PCA). Beyond the expected Galactic diffuse background, no\nsignificant gamma-ray emission in the direction of RCW 86 is detected in any of\nthe 0.1-1, 1-10 and 10-100 GeV Fermi-LAT maps.

At 2.4 Earth radii, Kepler-22b is too large to\nbe considered an Earth-analog, but should the planet host a moon large enough\nto maintain an atmosphere, then the Kepler-22 system may yet possess a telluric\nworld. Aside from being within the habitable-zone, the target is attractive due\nto the availability of previously measured precise radial velocities and low\nintrinsic photometric noise, which has also enabled asteroseismology studies of\nthe star. For these reasons, Kepler-22b was selected as a target-of-opportunity\nby the 'Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler' (HEK) project. In this work, we conduct\na photodynamical search for an exomoon around Kepler-22b leveraging the\ntransits, radial velocities and asteroseismology plus several new tools\ndeveloped by the HEK project to improve exomoon searches. We find no evidence\nfor an exomoon around the planet and exclude moons of mass >0.5 Earth masses to\n95% confidence. By signal injection and blind retrieval, we demonstrate that an\nEarth-like moon is easily detected for this planet even when the\ntime-correlated noise of the data set is taken into account. We provide updated\nparameters for the planet Kepler-22b including a revised mass of <53 Earth\nmasses to 95% confidence and an eccentricity of 0.13(-0.13)(+0.36) by\nexploiting Single-body Asterodensity Profiling (SAP). Finally, we show that\nKepler-22b has a >95% probability of being within the empirical habitable-zone\nbut a <5% probability of being within the conservative habitable-zone. \n\n"}

The Fermi gamma-ray pulsar population now exceeds 140 sources\nand has defined an important part of Fermi's science legacy. Among the\npopulation characteristics well established is the common occurrence of\nexponential turnovers in their spectra in the 1--10 GeV range. These turnovers\nare too gradual to arise from magnetic pair creation in the strong magnetic\nfields of pulsar inner magnetospheres. By demanding insignificant photon\nattenuation precipitated by such single-photon pair creation, the energies of\nthese turnovers for Fermi pulsars can be used to compute lower bounds for the\ntypical altitude of GeV band emission. This paper explores such pair\ntransparency constraints below the turnover energy, and updates earlier\naltitude bound determinations of that have been deployed in various Fermi\npulsar papers. For low altitude emission locales, general relativistic\ninfluences are found to be important. Rotational aberration influences are also\nexplored, and are found to be small at low altitudes, except near the magnetic\npole. The altitude bounds are typically in the range of 2-7 stellar radii for\nthe young Fermi pulsar population, and provide key information on the emission\naltitude in radio quiet pulsars that do not possess double-peaked pulse\nprofiles.

Dynamics in such a system is fundamentally different from cases in\nwhich the interactions are of short range, and is ultimately determined by the\nspectral and eigenvector structure.

Abstract: Measurements of the cosmic ray antiproton spectrum can be used to search for\ncontributions from annihilating dark matter and to constrain the dark matter\nannihilation cross section. Depending on the assumptions made regarding cosmic\nray propagation in the Galaxy, such constraints can be quite stringent. We\nrevisit this topic, utilizing a set of propagation models fit to the cosmic ray\nboron, carbon, oxygen and beryllium data. We derive upper limits on the dark\nmatter annihilation cross section and find that when the cosmic ray propagation\nparameters are treated as nuisance parameters (as we argue is appropriate), the\nresulting limits are significantly less stringent than have been previously\nreported. We also note (as have several previous groups) that simple\nGALPROP-like diffusion-reacceleration models predict a spectrum of cosmic ray\nantiprotons that is in good agreement with PAMELA's observations above ~5 GeV,\nbut that significantly underpredict the flux at lower energies. Although the\ncomplexity of modeling cosmic ray propagation at GeV-scale energies makes it\ndifficult to determine the origin of this discrepancy, we consider the\npossibility that the excess antiprotons are the result of annihilating dark\nmatter.

The galaxy\ntwo-point correlation function as a function of angle, $\\xi(\\mu)$, is measured\nat different redshifts. Assuming an incorrect cosmological model to convert\ngalaxy redshifts to distances, the shape of $\\xi(\\mu)$ appears anisotropic due\nto the AP effect, and the amplitude shifted by the change in comoving volume.\nDue to the redshift dependence of the AP and volume effect, both the shape and\namplitude of $\\xi(\\mu)$ exhibit redshift dependence.

To use observational resources most\nefficiently we need to know where the largest, most easily detected moons can\nform. We explore the possibility of large exomoons by following the movement of\nwater (H2O) ice lines in the accretion disks around young super-Jovian planets.\nWe want to know how different heating sources in those disks affect the H2O ice\nlines. We simulate 2D rotationally symmetric accretion disks in hydrostatic\nequilibrium around super-Jovian exoplanets. The energy terms in our\nsemi-analytical model -- (1) viscous heating, (2) planetary illumination, (3)\naccretional heating, and (4) stellar illumination -- are fed by precomputed\nplanet evolution tracks. We consider planets accreting 1 to 12 Jupiter masses\nat distances between 1 and 20 AU to a Sun-like star. Accretion disks around\nJupiter-mass planets closer than ~4.5 AU to Sun-like stars do not feature H2O\nice lines, but the most massive super-Jovians can form icy satellites as close\nas ~3 AU to Sun-like stars.

It is roughly $1.5$\nkpc wide and has an integrated $V$-band luminosity of at least $M_V = -7.4$.\nThe stellar populations in the feature are indistinguishable from those in the\nouter LMC disk. We attempt to quantify the geometry of the outer disk using\nsimple planar models, and find that only a disk with mild intrinsic ellipticity\ncan simultaneously explain the observed stellar density on the sky and the\nazimuthal line-of-sight distance profile.

Their realization in microresonators\nhas enabled compact sources of coherent optical frequency combs as well as the\nstudy of dissipative solitons. A key parameter of their dynamics is the\neffective-detuning of the pump laser to the thermally- and Kerr-shifted cavity\nresonance. Together with the free spectral range and dispersion, it governs the\nsoliton-pulse duration, as predicted by an approximate analytical solution of\nthe Lugiato-Lefever equation. Yet, a precise experimental verification of this\nrelation was lacking so far. Here, by measuring and controlling the\neffective-detuning, we establish a new way of stabilizing solitons in\nmicroresonators and demonstrate that the measured relation linking soliton\nwidth and detuning deviates by less than 1 % from the approximate expression,\nvalidating its excellent predictive power. Furthermore, a detuning-dependent\nenhancement of specific comb lines is revealed, due to linear couplings between\nmode-families. They cause deviations from the predicted comb power evolution,\nand induce a detuning-dependent soliton recoil that modifies the pulse\nrepetition-rate, explaining its unexpected dependence on laser-detuning.\nFinally, we observe that detuning-dependent mode-crossings can destabilize the\nsoliton, leading to an unpredicted soliton breathing regime (oscillations of\nthe pulse) that occurs in a normally-stable regime. Our results test the\napproximate analytical solutions with an unprecedented degree of accuracy and\nprovide new insights into dissipative-soliton dynamics. \n\n"}

Even though an analysis of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of\nthese collective modes does allow distinguishing superradiant modes, for\ninstance, from other collective modes, this is not sufficient to understand the\ndynamics of a driven system, as not all collective modes are significantly\npopulated. Here, we study how the excitation parameters, i.e. the driving\nfield, determines the population of the collective modes. We investigate in\nparticular the role of the laser detuning from the atomic transition, and\ndemonstrate a simple relation between the detuning and the steady-state\npopulation of the modes. This relation allows understanding several properties\nof cooperative scattering, such as why superradiance and subradiance become\nindependent of the detuning at large enough detuning without vanishing, and why\nsuperradiance, but not subradiance, is suppressed near resonance. \n\n"}

The limitations of the\njackknife covariance have been previously presented in the literature because\nit is effectively a rescaling of the covariance of the subsample area. However\nwe point out that subsampling is also biased, but for a different reason: the\nsubsamples are not independent, and the corresponding lack of power results in\nSSC underprediction. We develop the formalism in the case of cluster counts\nthat allows the bias of each covariance estimator to be exactly predicted. We\nfind significant effects for a small-scale area or when a low number of\nsubsamples is used, with auto-redshift biases ranging from 0.4% to 15% for\nsubsampling and from 5% to 75% for jackknife covariance estimates.

Current\nsuper-resolution techniques can reach this resolution, but are destructive to\nthe states of nearby qubits. Here, we demonstrate the measurement of individual\nqubit states in a sub-diffraction cluster by selectively exciting spectrally\ndistinguishable nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. We demonstrate super-resolution\nlocalization of single centers with nanometer spatial resolution, as well as\nindividual control and readout of spin populations. These measurements indicate\na readout-induced crosstalk on non-addressed qubits below $4\\times10^{-2}$.\nThis approach opens the door to high-speed control and measurement of qubit\nregisters in mesoscopic spin clusters, with applications ranging from\nentanglement-enhanced sensors to error-corrected qubit registers to multiplexed\nquantum repeater nodes. \n\n"}

In this context, we propose the implementation of an innovative\nechelle spectrometer based on the use of VIPA (Virtually Imaged Phased Array,\nShirasaki 1996).

Twisting beyond that point triggers instabilities\nthat results in the rapid expansion of magnetic field lines, followed by\nreconnection, as observed in previous axi-symmetric simulations.

Our baseline model assumes that halo\nmass, spin parameter, and formation redshift are the governing input parameters\nand that star formation is determined by surface density through a Schmidt law.\n  In all cases, the first principal component is primarily a measure of the\nshape of the spectral energy distribution (SED), and it is usually driven by\nvariations in the spin parameter, which influences star formation through the\ndisk surface density. The second and (in some cases) third principal components\nconsist mainly of ``scale'' parameters like luminosity, disk radius, and\ncircular velocity. However, the detailed division of these scale parameters,\nthe disk surface brightness, and the rotation curve slope among the principal\ncomponents changes significantly from model to model. Our calculations yield\npredictions of principal component structure for the baseline model of disk\ngalaxy formation, and a physical interpretation of these predictions. They also\nshow that PCA can test the core assumptions of that model and reveal the\npresence of additional physical parameters that may govern observable galaxy\nproperties. \n\n"}

Given the observed temporal overlapping between the flares and\nafterglows, there must be inverse Compton (IC) emission arising from such flare\nphotons scattered by forward shock afterglow electrons. We find that this IC\nemission produces GeV-TeV flares, which may be detected by GLAST and\nground-based TeV telescopes. We speculate that this kind of emission may\nalready have been detected by EGRET from a very strong burst--GRB940217. The\nenhanced cooling of the forward shock electrons by the X-ray flare photons may\nsuppress the synchrotron emission of the afterglows during the flare period.\nThe detection of GeV-TeV flares combined with low energy observations may help\nto constrain the poorly known magnetic field in afterglow shocks. We also\nconsider the self-IC emission in the context of internal-shock and\nexternal-shock models for X-ray flares. The emission above GeV from internal\nshocks is low, while the external shock model can also produce GeV-TeV flares,\nbut with a different temporal behavior from that caused by IC scattering of\nflare photons by afterglow electrons. This suggests a useful approach for\ndistinguishing whether X-ray flares originate from late central engine activity\nor from external shocks. \n\n"}

It is found that, almost independent of initial\nconditions, a filamentary cloud continues to collapse nearly isothermally due\nto H_2 cooling until the cloud becomes optically thick against the H_2 lines.\nDuring the collapse the cloud structure separates into two parts, i.e., a\ndenser spindle and a diffuse envelope. The spindle contracts quasi-statically,\nand thus the line mass of the spindle keeps a characteristic value determined\nsolely by the temperature ($\\sim 800$ K). Applying a linear theory, we find\nthat the spindle is unstable against fragmentation during the collapse. The\nwavelength of the fastest growing perturbation lessens as the collapse\nproceeds. Consequently, successive fragmentation could occur. When the central\ndensity exceeds $n_c \\sim 10^{10-11} cm^{-3}$, the successive fragmentation may\ncease since the cloud becomes opaque against the H_2 lines and the collapse\ndecelerates appreciably.

Abstract: It is intriguing to consider the possibility that the Big Bang of the\nstandard (3+1) dimensional cosmology originated from the collision of two\nbranes within a higher dimensional spacetime, leading to the production of a\nlarge amount of entropy. In this paper we study, subject to certain\nwell-defined assumptions, under what conditions such a collision leads to an\nexpanding universe. We assume the absence of novel physics, so that ordinary\n(4+1) -dimensional Einstein gravity remains a valid approximation. It is\nnecessary that the fifth dimension not become degenerate at the moment of\ncollision.

This is a result of the very high energy level density\nof many-body states which can be easily mixed by a residual interaction between\nparticles. We consider the time dynamics of wave functions and increase of\nentropy in such chaotic systems.\n  As an example we present the time evolution in a closed quantum computer. A\ntime scale for the entropy S(t) increase is t_c =t_0/(n log_2{n}), where t_0 is\nthe qubit ``lifetime'', n is the number of qubits, S(0)=0 and S(t_c)=1.
