First, in estimating the parameters of some model for\nthe data, the resulting posterior distribution may be multimodal or exhibit\npronounced (curving) degeneracies, which can cause problems for traditional\nMCMC sampling methods. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models,\ncalculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally\nexpensive. The nested sampling method introduced by Skilling (2004), has\ngreatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidences and also\nproduces posterior inferences as a by-product. This method has been applied\nsuccessfully in cosmological applications by Mukherjee et al. (2006), but their\nimplementation was efficient only for unimodal distributions without pronounced\ndegeneracies. Shaw et al. (2007), recently introduced a clustered nested\nsampling method which is significantly more efficient in sampling from\nmultimodal posteriors and also determines the expectation and variance of the\nfinal evidence from a single run of the algorithm, hence providing a further\nincrease in efficiency. In this paper, we build on the work of Shaw et al. and\npresent three new methods for sampling and evidence evaluation from\ndistributions that may contain multiple modes and significant degeneracies; we\nalso present an even more efficient technique for estimating the uncertainty on\nthe evaluated evidence. These methods lead to a further substantial improvement\nin sampling efficiency and robustness, and are applied to toy problems to\ndemonstrate the accuracy and economy of the evidence calculation and parameter\nestimation. Finally, we discuss the use of these methods in performing Bayesian\nobject detection in astronomical datasets. \n\n"}

Specfically, in the cases where the directions\nof the filaments and outflows are well defined, we infer statistically that 72%\nof outflows are within $45^{\\rm o}$ of being orthogonal to the filament, and\nonly 28% are within $45^{\\rm o}$ of being parallel to the filament.\n  Conclusions: This suggests that the prestellar cores which spawned the YSOs\ndriving the observed outflows had angular momenta which were approximately\northogonal to the filaments out of which the cores formed. We briefly discuss\nthe implications of this for two proposed core formation mechanisms. \n\n"}

Abstract: We have observed the hard X-ray selected Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy SWIFT\nJ2127.4+5654 with Suzaku. We report the detection of a broad relativistic iron\nemission line from the inner accretion disc. By assuming that the inner edge of\nthe accretion disc corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit of the\nblack hole spacetime, the line profile enables us to measure a black hole spin\na= 0.6\\pm0.2. However, a non-rotating Schwarzschild spacetime is excluded at\njust above the 3 sigma level, while a maximally spinning Kerr black hole is\nexcluded at the ~5 sigma level. The intermediate spin we measure may indicate\nthat accretion-driven black hole growth in this source proceeds through\nshort-lived episodes with chaotic angular momentum alignment between the disc\nand the hole rather than via prolonged accretion. The measured steep emissivity\nindex (q~5) constrains the irradiating X-ray source to be very centrally\nconcentrated. Light bending may help focus the primary emission towards the\ninnermost accretion disc, thus steepening the irradiation profile. On the other\nhand, steep profiles can also be reached if magnetic extraction of the hole\nrotational energy is at work. If this is the case, the interplay between\naccretion (spinning up the black hole) and rotational energy extraction\n(spinning it down) forces the hole to reach an equilibrium spin value which,\nunder standard assumptions, is remarkably consistent with our measurement.\nRotational energy extraction would then be able to simultaneously account for\nthe intermediate spin and steep emissivity profile we infer from our spectral\nanalysis without the need to invoke chaotic accretion episodes.

The calculations are based on three-dimensional\nhydrodynamical models which incorporate gravity, the driving of the winds,\norbital motion of the stars, and radiative cooling of the shocked plasma. The\nthermal emission arises from the stellar winds and the region where they\ncollide. We investigate the flux and spectrum from a variety of models as a\nfunction of orbital phase and orientation of the observer, and compare to the\nsingle star case. The emission from the wind-wind collision region (WCR) is\nstrongly dependent on its density and temperature, being optically thick in\nradiative systems, and optically thin in adiabatic systems. The flux from\nsystems where the WCR is highly radiative, as investigated for the first time\nin this work, can be over an order of magnitude greater than the combined flux\nfrom identically typed single stars.

For 9 sources\nwith X-ray counterparts, the X-ray spectra are consistent with Compton Thin\nAGN. Only 3 of them show tentative evidence for Compton Thick obscuration. The\nSEDs of the X-ray undetected population are consistent with starburst activity.\nThere is no evidence for a hot dust component at the mid-infrared associated\nwith AGN heated dust. If the X-ray undetected sources host AGN, an upper limit\nof L_X(2-10keV) =1e43erg/s is estimated for their intrinsic luminosity. We\npropose that a large fraction of the $z\\approx2$ IRX population are not Compton\nThick QSOs but low luminosity [L_X(2-10keV)<1e43erg/s], possibly Compton Thin,\nAGN or dusty starbursts. It is shown that the decomposition of the AGN and\nstarburst contribution to the mid-IR is essential for interpreting the nature\nof this population, as star-formation may dominate this wavelength regime. \n\n"}

We consider\nfitting for a range of maximum wavenumber k using twelve different galaxy bias\nmodels. For example, using a new model based on perturbation theory and\nincluding redshift space distortions (Saito et al. 2009), the all-galaxy power\nspectrum combined with WMAP5 for a wavenumber range of k<0.2 Mpc/h yields 95%\nCL sum(m_nu)<0.46 eV.

It has earlier been proposed that UHECRs could be\naccelerated in either the nucleus or the outer lobes of the nearby radio galaxy\nCen A. We show that UHECR production at a spatially intermediate location about\n15 kpc northeast from the nucleus, where the jet emerging from the nucleus is\nobserved to strike a large star-forming shell of gas, is a plausible\nalternative. A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud.

We find that from ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals to giant cluster\nspheroids, dispersion-supported galaxies scatter about a one-dimensional\n\"fundamental curve\" through this MRL space. The weakness of the M1/2-L1/2 slope\non the faint end may imply that potential well depth limits galaxy formation in\nsmall galaxies, while the stronger dependence on L1/2 on the bright end\nsuggests that baryonic physics limits galaxy formation in massive galaxies. The\nmass-radius projection of this curve can be compared to median dark matter halo\nmass profiles of LCDM halos in order to construct a virial mass-luminosity\nrelationship (Mvir-L) for galaxies that spans seven orders of magnitude in\nMvir. Independent of any global abundance or clustering information, we find\nthat (spheroidal) galaxy formation needs to be most efficient in halos of Mvir\n~ 10^12 Msun and to become inefficient above and below this scale.

This phenomenon is\nassociated with complex physics in the ICM and has been a subject of intense\ndebate and investigation in recent years. In order to quantify the evolution in\nthe cool-core cluster population, we robustly measure the cool-core strength in\na local, representative cluster sample, and in the largest sample of\nhigh-redshift clusters available to date. We use high-resolution Chandra data\nof three representative cluster samples spanning different redshift ranges: (i)\nthe local sample from the 400 SD survey with median z = 0.08, (ii) the high\nredshift sample from the 400 SD Survey with median z=0.59, and (iii) 15\nclusters drawn from the RDCS and the WARPS, with median z = 0.83. Our analysis\nis based on the measurement of the surface brightness concentration, c_SB,\nwhich allows us to characterize the cool-core strength in low signal-to-noise\ndata. We also obtain gas density profiles to derive cluster central cooling\ntimes and entropy. In addition to the X-ray analysis, we search for radio\ncounterparts associated with the cluster cores.

However, the amount of evolution is\nsignificantly smaller than previously claimed, leaving room for a large\npopulation of well formed cool-cores at z~1. \n\n"}

In frequentist\nparameter estimation, a central requirement for properly constructed confidence\nintervals is that they cover true parameter values, preferably at exactly the\nstated confidence level when experiments are repeated infinitely many times.\nSince most widely-used scanning techniques are optimised for Bayesian\nstatistics, one needs to assess their abilities in providing correct confidence\nintervals in terms of the statistical coverage. Here we investigate this for\nthe Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) when only\nconstrained by data from direct searches for dark matter. We construct\nconfidence intervals from one-dimensional profile likelihoods and study the\ncoverage by generating several pseudo-experiments for a few benchmark sets of\npseudo-true parameters.

A\ngeneral problem is how to produce binaries with semi-major axes small enough to\nin significantly less than the Hubble time (t_H), and thus accommodate the\nobservation that these events closely follow episodes of star formation. I\nexplore the possibility that such systems are not binaries at all, but actually\ncoeval, or dynamical formed, triple systems. The tertiary induces Kozai\noscillations in the inner binary, driving it to high eccentricity, and reducing\nits gravitational wave (GW) merger timescale. This effect significantly\nincreases the allowed range of binary period P such that the merger time is\nt_merge < t_H. In principle, Chandrasekhar-mass binaries with P ~ 300 days can\nmerge in < t_H if they contain a prograde solar-mass tertiary at high enough\ninclination. For retrograde tertiaries, the maximum P such that t_merge < t_H\nis yet larger. In contrast, P < 0.3 days is required in the absence of a\ntertiary.

Our method combines two recent results: 1)\nspherically symmetric, equilibrium Jeans models imply that the product of\nhalflight radius and (squared) stellar velocity dispersion provides an estimate\nof the mass enclosed within the halflight radius of a dSph stellar component,\nand 2) some dSphs have chemo-dynamically distinct stellar\n\\textit{sub}components that independently trace the same gravitational\npotential. We devise a statistical method that uses measurements of stellar\npositions, velocities and spectral indices to distinguish two dSph stellar\nsubcomponents and to estimate their individual halflight radii and velocity\ndispersions. For a dSph with two detected stellar subcomponents, we obtain\nestimates of masses enclosed at two discrete points in the same mass profile,\nimmediately defining a slope. Applied to published spectroscopic data, our\nmethod distinguishes stellar subcomponents in the Fornax and Sculptor dSphs,\nfor which we measure slopes $\\Gamma\\equiv \\Delta \\log M / \\Delta \\log\nr=2.61_{-0.37}^{+0.43}$ and $\\Gamma=2.95_{-0.39}^{+0.51}$, respectively.

We validate this strategy by comparing with\nknown results for the rotating monopole and aligned rotator solutions and then\napply it to study both rotating and non-rotating stellar collapse scenarios,\nand contrast the behavior with what is obtained when employing the\nelectrovacuum approximation outside the star. The non-rotating electrovacuum\ncollapse is shown to agree qualitatively with a Newtonian model of the\nelectromagnetic field outside a collapsing star.

The current excess in the diphoton\nchannel is twice that expected from a Standard Model Higgs; whilst this may\nwell change with more statistics, it is interesting to consider the\nimplications should the result persist. Here, we assess whether the NMSSM with\na neutralino dark matter candidate could explain this excess when astrophysical\nconstraints (e.g. no overproduction of gamma rays and radio emission in the\ngalaxy, no anomalous excess in the dark matter direct detection experiments and\nno dark matter overabundance) are imposed on the neutralino. This enables us to\ndisregard unphysical regions of the parameter space even though the Higgs\nsignal is compatible with the observed excess.

Meanwhile, current cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) and big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) measurements\nplace an upper bound on the effective number of light neutrinos, $N_{eff}$ and\nthe PLANCK satellite will measure $N_{eff}$ to a much higher accuracy and\nfurther constrain the number of sterile neutrinos allowed. We demonstrate that\nif an MeV dark matter particle couples more strongly to electrons and/or\nphotons than to neutrinos, then p-wave annihilation after neutrino decoupling\ncan reduce the value of $N_{eff}$ inferred from BBN and PLANCK. This mechanism\ncan accommodate two eV sterile neutrinos even if PLANCK observes $N_{eff}$ as\nlow as the standard model theoretical value of 3.046, and a large neutrino\nasymmetry is not needed to obtain the correct primordial element abundances.\nThe dark matter annihilation also weakens the cosmological upper bounds on the\nneutrino masses, and we derive a relationship between the change in these\nbounds and the corresponding change in $N_{eff}$. Dark matter with an electric\ndipole moment or anapole moment is a natural candidate that exhibits the\ndesired properties for this mechanism. Coincidentally, a dark matter particle\nwith these properties and lighter than 3 MeV is precisely one that can explain\nthe 511 keV gamma-ray line observed by INTEGRAL. We show that the addition of\ntwo eV sterile neutrinos allows this kind of dark matter to be lighter than 3\nMeV, which is otherwise ruled out by the CMB bound on $N_{eff}$ if only active\nneutrinos are considered. \n\n"}

The satellite fractions are generally close to zero for blue\nlenses, irrespective of luminosity or stellar mass. This, together with the\nshallower relation between halo mass and baryonic tracer, is a direct\nconfirmation from galaxy-galaxy lensing that blue galaxies reside in less\nclustered environments than red galaxies.

The upper limits on\nthe annihilation cross section set by Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. extend\nuninterrupted from tens of GeV up to tens of TeV and are rather insensitive to\nthe mass degeneracy in the particle physics model. In contrast, direct searches\nare best in the moderate to low mass splitting regime, where XENON100 limits\novershadow Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. up to TeV masses if dark matter couples to\none of the light quarks.

In particular, the\ndisc scale length does not change when WDM is considered. The reduced amount of\nstar formation in the case of 1 keV particles is due to the effects of WDM on\nmerging satellites which are on average less concentrated and less gas rich.\nThe altered satellites cause a reduced starburst during mergers because they\ntrigger weaker disc instabilities in the main galaxy.

Precise experimental measurements of the Higgs couplings at the LHC\nand at the proposed next-generation facilities will allow for a robust test of\nthe phase transition dynamics. To illustrate this point, in this paper we focus\non the scenario in which loops of a new scalar field are responsible for the\nfirst-order phase transition, and study a selection of benchmark models with\nvarious SM gauge quantum numbers of the new scalar. We find that the current\nLHC measurement of the Higgs coupling to gluons already excludes the\npossibility of a first-order phase transition induced by a scalar in a sextet,\nor larger, representation of the SU(3)_c.

The abundant differences between the properties of disky and\nelliptical, or star-forming and quiescent, galaxies seem to be characteristic\nof the local Universe; such clear distinctions begin to disintegrate as\nobservations of massive galaxies probe higher redshifts. In this Paper, we\ninvestigate the existence the mass fundamental plane of all massive galaxies\n($\\sigma\\gtrsim$ 100 km/s).

In two\nparameter scaling relations, star-forming and quiescent galaxies differ\nstructurally and dynamically. However, we show that massive star-forming and\nquiescent galaxies lie on nearly the same mass fundamental plane, or the\nrelationship between stellar mass surface density, stellar velocity dispersion,\nand effective radius. The scatter in this relation (measured about\n$\\log\\sigma$) is low: 0.072 dex (0.055 dex intrinsic) at z~0 and 0.10 dex (0.08\ndex intrinsic) at z~0.7. This three dimensional surface is not unique: virial\nrelations, with or without a dependence on luminosity profile shapes, can\nconnect galaxy structures and stellar dynamics with similar scatter. This\nresult builds on the recent finding that mass fundamental plane has been stable\nfor early-type galaxies since z~2 (Bezanson et al. 2013).

One promising way to affect structure formation on small scales is a\nrelatively strong coupling of dark matter to neutrinos. We construct an\nexperimentally viable, simple, renormalizable, model with new interactions\nbetween neutrinos and dark matter. We show that addressing the small scale\nstructure problems requires dark matter with a mass that is tens of MeV, and a\npresent-day density determined by an initial particle-antiparticle asymmetry in\nthe dark sector. Generating a sufficiently large dark matter-neutrino coupling\nrequires a new heavy neutrino with a mass around 100 MeV. The heavy neutrino is\nmostly sterile but has a substantial $\\tau$ neutrino component, while the three\nnearly massless neutrinos are partly sterile. We provide the first discussion\nof how such dark matter-neutrino interactions affect neutrino (especially\n$\\tau$ neutrino) phenomenology. This model can be tested by future\nastrophysical, particle physics, and neutrino oscillation data. A feature in\nthe neutrino energy spectrum and flavor content from a future nearby supernova\nwould provide strong evidence of neutrino-dark matter interactions. Promising\nsignatures include anomalous matter effects in neutrino oscillations due to\nnonstandard interactions and a component of the $\\tau$ neutrino with mass\naround 100 MeV. \n\n"}

These are the first SIDM simulations that are combined with a\ndescription of stellar feedback that naturally drives potential fluctuations\nable to create dark matter cores. Remarkably, SIDM fails to significantly lower\nthe central dark matter density at halo peak velocities V$_{max}$ $<$ 30 Km/s.\nThis is due to the fact that the central regions of very low--mass field halos\nhave relatively low central velocity dispersion and densities, leading to time\nscales for SIDM collisions greater than a Hubble time. CDM halos with V$_{max}$\n$<$ 30 km/s have inefficient star formation, and hence weak supernova feedback.\nAt a fixed 2 cm2/g SIDM cross section, the DM content of very low mass CDM and\nSIDM halos differs by no more than a factor of two within 100-200pc.

To significantly differentiate\nSIDM from CDM at the scale of faint dwarf galaxies, a velocity dependent cross\nsection that rapidly increases to values larger than 2 $cm^{2}/g$ for halos\nwith V$_{max}$ < 25-30 Km/s needs to be introduced. \n\n"}

It has recently been argued that the metallicity\ndistribution of stars with exoplanet candidates identified by Kepler provides\nevidence for three distinct clusters of exoplanets, distinguished by planet\nradius boundaries at 1.7 R_Earth and 3.9 R_Earth. This would suggest that there\nare three distinct planet formation pathways for super-Earths, mini-Neptunes,\nand giant planets. However, as I show through three independent analyses, there\nis actually no evidence for the proposed radius boundary at 1.7 R_Earth. On the\nother hand, a more rigorous calculation demonstrates that a single, continuous\nrelationship between planet radius and metallicity is a better fit to the data.\nThe planet radius and metallicity data therefore provides no evidence for\ndistinct categories of small planets. This suggests that the planet formation\nprocess in a typical protoplanetary disk produces a continuum of planet sizes\nbetween 1 R_Earth and 4 R_Earth.

This is\nbroadly consistent with previous work using simpler feedback schemes, but we\nfind steeper mass dependence of $\\alpha$, and relatively late growth of cores.\nBecause the star formation efficiency $M_{\\ast}/M_{\\rm h}$ is strongly halo\nmass dependent, a rapid change in $\\alpha$ occurs around $M_{\\rm h}\\sim\n10^{10}\\,M_{\\odot}$ ($M_{\\ast}\\sim10^{6}-10^{7}\\,M_{\\odot}$), as sufficient\nfeedback energy becomes available to perturb the DM. Large cores are not\nestablished during the period of rapid growth of halos because of ongoing DM\nmass accumulation. Instead, cores require several bursts of star formation\nafter the rapid buildup has completed. Stellar feedback dramatically reduces\ncircular velocities in the inner kpc of massive dwarfs; this could be\nsufficient to explain the \"Too Big To Fail\" problem without invoking\nnon-standard DM. Finally, feedback and baryonic contraction in Milky Way-mass\nhalos produce DM profiles slightly shallower than the Navarro-Frenk-White\nprofile, consistent with the normalization of the observed Tully-Fisher\nrelation. \n\n"}

The sample is\nmade of $\\approx 70$ independent high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of\ngalaxy formation and covers a wide mass range: 1e10< Mhalo <1e12, i.e., from\ndwarfs to L* . We confirm previous results on the dependence of the inner dark\nmatter density slope, $\\alpha$, on the ratio between stellar-to-halo mass. We\nshow that this relation holds approximately at all redshifts (with an intrinsic\nscatter of ~0.18 in $\\alpha$). This implies that in practically all haloes the\nshape of their inner density profile changes quite substantially over cosmic\ntime, as they grow in stellar and total mass. Thus, depending on their final\nstellar-to-halo mass ratio, haloes can either form and keep a substantial\ndensity core (size~1 kpc), or form and then destroy the core and re-contract\nthe halo, going back to a cuspy profile, which is even steeper than CDM\npredictions for massive galaxies (~1e12 Msun).

In this paper we compare the SHM to the results of cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation to investigate whether or not\nthe SHM is a good representation of the true WIMP distribution in the analysis\nof direct detection data. We examine two Milky Way-like galaxies from the\nMaGICC cosmological simulations (a) with dark matter only and (b) with baryonic\nphysics included.

Our sample consists of ~50,000 galaxies in the CANDELS fields\n($\\sim880$ $arcmin^2$), which we divide into four main morphological types,\ni.e. pure bulge dominated systems, pure spiral disk dominated, intermediate\n2-component bulge+disk systems and irregular disturbed galaxies. Our main\nresults are:\n  Star-formation: At $z\\sim 2$, 80\\% of the stellar mass density of\nstar-forming galaxies is in irregular systems. However, by $z\\sim 0.5$,\nirregular objects only dominate at stellar masses below $10^9M\\odot$. A\nmajority of the star-forming irregulars present at $z\\sim 2$ undergo a gradual\ntransformation from disturbed to normal spiral disk morphologies by $z\\sim 1$\nwithout significant interruption to their star-formation. Rejuvenation after a\nquenching event does not seem to be common except perhaps for the most massive\nobjects.\n  Quenching: We confirm that galaxies reaching a stellar mass of\n$M_*\\sim10^{10.8}M_\\odot$ ($M^*$) tend to quench. Also, quenching implies the\npresence of a bulge: the abundance of massive red disks is negligible at all\nredshifts over 2~dex in stellar mass. However the dominant quenching mechanism\nevolves. At $z>2$, the SMF of quiescent galaxies above $M^*$ is dominated by\ncompact spheroids. Quenching at this early epoch destroys the disk and produces\na compact remnant unless the star-forming progenitors at even higher redshifts\nare significantly more dense. At $1<z<2$, the majority of newly quenched\ngalaxies are disks with a significant central bulge. This suggests that\nmass-quenching at this epoch starts from the inner parts and preserves the\ndisk. At $z<1$, the high mass end of the passive SMF is globally in place and\nthe evolution mostly happens at stellar masses below $10^{10}M_\\odot$. \n\n"}

Strikingly, we uncover a stream whose density exhibits\nvisible changes on a variety of angular scales.

A new systematic analysis technique is developed using the EFT\napproach and Bayesian inference methods to exploit, when possible, the\nenergy-dependent information of the detected events, experimental efficiencies,\nand backgrounds. Highly dimensional likelihoods are calculated over the mass of\nthe weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) and multiple EFT coupling\ncoefficients, which can then be used to set limits on these parameters and\nchoose models (EFT operators) that best fit the direct detection data.\nExpanding the parameter space beyond the standard spin-independent isoscalar\ncross section and WIMP mass reduces tensions between previously published\nexperiments. Combining these experiments to form a single joint likelihood\nleads to stronger limits than when each experiment is considered on its own.\nSimulations using two nonstandard operators (3 and 8) are used to test the\nproposed analysis technique in up to five dimensions and demonstrate the\nimportance of using multiple likelihood projections when determining\nconstraints on WIMP mass and EFT coupling coefficients. In particular, this\nshows that an explicit momentum dependence in dark matter scattering can be\nidentified. \n\n"}

Probabilistic cataloging allows us to robustly characterize modeling\ncovariances within and across lens models with different numbers of subhalos.\nUnlike traditional cataloging of subhalos, it does not require model subhalos\nto improve the goodness of fit above the detection threshold. Instead, it\nallows the exploitation of all information contained in the photon count maps,\nfor instance, when constraining the subhalo mass function.

The main goal is to establish whether these systems are efficient\nnon-thermal emitters, even if they are not strong enough to be yet detected.\nFor modeling the collision between the stellar wind and the interstellar medium\nwe use 2D hydrodynamic simulations.

All the gauge and\nmixed gauge-gravitational anomalies are cancelled in this model with the\nintroduction of three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). Unlike the conventional\nminimal U(1)$_X$ model, where a universal U(1)$_X$ charge of $-1$ is assigned\nto three RHNs, we consider an alternative charge assignment, namely, two RHNs\n($N_R^{1,2}$) have U(1)$_X$ charge $-4$ while one RHN ($N_R$) has a $+5$\ncharge. With a minimal extension of the Higgs sector, the three RHNs acquire\ntheir Majorana masses associated with U(1)$_X$ symmetry breaking. While\n$N_R^{1,2}$ have Yukawa coupling with the SM lepton doublets and play an\nessential role for the 'minimal seesaw' mechanism, $N_R$ is isolated from the\nSM particles due to its U(1)$_X$ charge and hence it is a natural candidate for\nthe dark matter (DM) without invoking additional symmetries.

Most, if not all, stars\nprobably form in binary or multiple systems, and tidal torques in these systems\ncan transfer much of the angular momentum from the gas around each forming star\nto the orbital motions of the companion stars.

By contrast, the peak in the extinction of the more\ncompact clusters lie more than 4% from 4.6 inverse micron. At short wavelengths\n(0.1 - 0.5 micron), all the methods show that fractal clusters have markedly\ndifferent extinction from those of non-fractal clusters.

If the outflow is\nquenched in SMBHs at high accretion rates similarly to the behavior of galactic\nsources, then the straightforward consequence is a relatively weak feedback of\nrapidly accreting SMBHs. We argue that elliptical galaxies and their central\nengines should then evolve through two stages. Early on, the central SMBH\nrapidly grows by accreting cooling gas at a near-Eddington rate with high\nradiative efficiency but with weak feedback on the infalling gas. This stage\nterminates when the black hole has grown to a sufficiently large mass that its\nfeedback (radiative and/or mechanical), despite the low gas heating efficiency,\nis able to suppress gas cooling. After that the system switches to a stable\nstate corresponding to passively evolving ellipticals, when the accretion rate\nand radiative efficiency are very low, but the gas heating efficiency is high\nand energy input from the relativistic outflow keeps the gas hot. \n\n"}

A promising\npossibility to explain these sources is given by \"in situ\" stochastic\nreacceleration of relativistic electrons by turbulence generated in the cluster\nvolume during merger events. Cassano & Brunetti (2005) have recently shown that\nthe expected fraction of clusters with GRHs and the increase of such a fraction\nwith cluster mass can be reconciled with present observations provided that a\nfraction of 20-30 % of the turbulence in clusters is in the form of\ncompressible modes. In this work we extend these calculations by including a\nscaling of the magnetic field strength with cluster mass. We show that the\nobserved correlations between the synchrotron radio power of a sample of 17\nGRHs and the X-ray properties of the hosting clusters are consistent with, and\nactually predicted by a magnetic field dependence on the virial mass of the\nform B \\propto M^b, with b>0.5 and typical micro Gauss strengths of the average\nB intensity. The occurrence of GRHs as a function of both cluster mass and\nredshift is obtained. The most relevant findings are that the predicted\nluminosity functions of GRHs are peaked around a power P_{1.4 GHz} 10^{24}\nW/Hz, and severely cut-off at low radio powers due to the decrease of the\nelectron reacceleration in smaller galaxy clusters.

PSR B1706-44 is a radio and high-energy gamma-ray pulsar (detected by\nEGRET), but no pulsed emission has been detected in the X-ray band. Since most\nof the other known gamma-ray pulsars emit pulsed X-rays, it is expected that\nPSR B1706-44 would also be an X-ray pulsar. However, while the ROSAT PSPC\ndetected a source at the pulsar position, it did not detect pulsations, giving\na pulsed fraction upper limit of 18%.

Abstract: New, high resolution, large-scale, cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation\nsimulations of a standard cold dark matter model (with a cosmological constant)\nare utilized to predict the distribution of baryons at the present and at\nmoderate redshift.

Thus, not only is the universe\ndominated by dark matter, but more than one half of the normal matter is yet to\nbe detected. Detection of this warm/hot gas poses an observational challenge,\nrequiring sensitive EUV and X-ray satellites.

We\nfind that the VDF in models is very different from the observed one:\nn(>Vc)~1200(Vc/10 km/s)^{-2.75}h^3 Mpc^{-3}. Cosmological models thus predict\nthat a halo of the size of our Galaxy should have about 50 dark matter\nsatellites with circular velocity >20 km/s and mass >3x10^8/h Msun within a 570\nkpc radius.

We discuss several\npossible explanations for this discrepancy including identification of some\nsatellites with the High Velocity Clouds observed in the Local Group, and the\nexistence of dark satellites that failed to accrete gas and form stars due\neither to the expulsion of gas in the supernovae-driven winds or to gas heating\nby the intergalactic ionizing background.

The expected profile and average\nspectral evolution from a single shell is compared to the average of many\nbursts and found to be different. The presence of gaps in many gamma-ray bursts\nis a strong argument against a single shell because an observer should see many\ncausally disconnected regions at any one time.The rapid variability is also\ndifficult to explain from a single shell because of the large number of\ncausally disconnected regions. The pulse width as a function of time in a burst\nshould increase because there is a one-to-one relationship between arrival time\nand the off-axis angle of emission. The observations show that the pulse width\ndoes not increase with time.

This experiment, which will\nbe run at the 8.9 A Neutron Line at the Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline\n(FNPB) at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory, will search for the neutron EDM with a sensitivity two orders of\nmagnitude better than the present limit. In this paper, the motivation for the\nexperiment, the experimental method, and the present status of the experiment\nare discussed. \n\n"}

Results for short and long-range\nmultiplicity correlations (Forward-Backward) are presented for Au+Au collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The growth of long range correlations are\nobserved as a function of the pseudorapidity gap in central Au+Au collisions.\nThe Dual Parton model and Color Glass Condensate phenomenology have been\nexplored to understand the origin of long range correlations. \n\n"}

{"id": "nucl-ex/9810007", "contents": "Title: Hadronic Particle Production in Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions Abstract: Data on hadronic particle production in symmetric nuclear collisions from\nSIS/BEVALAC to SPS energies are reviewed. The main emphasis is put on the\nproduction of pions, kaons, and antibaryons. Global features will be discussed\nin terms of rapidity and transverse momentum distributions and the total energy\nstored in produced particles. Pion and kaon production probabilities are\nstudied as function of beam energy and their distribution in polar and\nazimuthal angle. Special emphasis is put on medium effects expected for kaons\nin dense nuclear matter at low energies. An enhanced strange particle yield is\nfound at all energies, its explanation at SPS energies is still controversial.\nExperimental data on antibaryon and multistrange hyperon production is less\ncomplete and does not allow for similar systematic studies. \n\n"}

The available data on linear\nmomentum transfer are analyzed as well. The results are compared with\nanalytical approximations resulting from a comparative critical analysis of all\navailable experimental data. Systematic discrepancies between calculations and\nexperimental data are revealed. A modification of the CEM is proposed, which\nsignificantly improves the model predictions for projectile energies above 100\nMeV. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/0203002", "contents": "Title: Finding an Upper Limit in the Presence of Unknown Background Abstract: Experimenters report an upper limit if the signal they are trying to detect\nis non-existent or below their experiment's sensitivity. Such experiments may\nbe contaminated with a background too poorly understood to subtract. If the\nbackground is distributed differently in some parameter from the expected\nsignal, it is possible to take advantage of this difference to get a stronger\nlimit than would be possible if the difference in distribution were ignored. We\ndiscuss the ``Maximum Gap'' method, which finds the best gap between events for\nsetting an upper limit, and generalize to ``Optimum Interval'' methods, which\nuse intervals with especially few events. These methods, which apply to the\ncase of relatively small backgrounds, do not use binning, are relatively\ninsensitive to cuts on the range of the parameter, are parameter independent\n(i.e., do not change when a one-one change of variables is made), and provide\ntrue, though possibly conservative, classical one-sided confidence intervals. \n\n"}
