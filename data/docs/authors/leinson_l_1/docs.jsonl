The model is used to calculate the number densities of the\nhadrons produced in the polarized quark's decay chain. The full Collins\nfragmentation function is extracted from the sine modulation of the polarized\nnumber densities with respect to the polar angle between the initial quark's\nspin and hadron's transverse momentum. Two cases are studied here. First, a toy\nmodel for elementary Collins function is used to study the features of the\ntransversely polarized quark-jet model. Second, a full model calculation of\ntransverse momentum dependent pion and kaon Collins functions is presented. The\nremarkable feature of our model is that the 1/2 moments of the favored Collins\nfragmentation functions are positive and peak at large values of z but decrease\nand oscillate at small values of z. The 1/2 moments of the unfavored Collins\nfunctions have comparable magnitude and opposite sign to the favored functions,\nvanish at large z and peak at small values of z.

They are understood as strongly\nmagnetized neutron star, with large periods of rotation $P\\sim(2-12)$ s, and\nlarge spin-down, with typical $\\dot{P}\\sim(10^{-13}-10^{-10})$ s/s in contrast\nto $\\dot{P}\\sim10^{-15}$ s for ordinary pulsars. Their persistent X-ray\nluminosity, as well as the bursts and flares typical of these sources, are\ninstead believed to be powered by the decay of their ultrastrong magnetic\nfield. SGRs/AXPs typically have a larger X-ray luminosity that can not be\nexplained by their spin-down luminosity ($L_X>\\dot{E}_{\\rm rot}$), unlike\nrotation-powered pulsars. However, the recent discovery of radio-pulsed\nemission in four of this class of sources, where the spin-down rotational\nenergy lost $\\dot{E}_{\\rm rot}$ is larger than the X-ray luminosity $L_X$\nduring the quiescent state - as in normal pulsars - opens the question of the\nnature of these radio sources in comparison to the others of this class. In\nthis contribution, we show that the radio SGRs/AXPs obey a linear log-log\nrelation between $L_X$ and $\\dot{E}_{\\rm rot}$, very similar to the one\nsatisfied by X-ray and gamma-ray neutron star pulsars, suggesting their neutron\nstar nature. Furthermore, we show that almost all the high-B pulsars are also\nnear the line found for the radio AXPs. In contrast, for almost all the others\nSGRs/AXPs, $\\log L_X$ does not vary too much as function of $\\log \\dot{E}_{\\rm\nrot}$, a phenomenology not shared by X-ray neutron star pulsars, suggesting a\ndifferent nature for these sources. \n\n"}

Traditionally, they are included in a\nmean-field description of atomic nuclei through the approximate\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer or Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov formalism. Purpose: We\npropose a new hybrid ''relativistic-mean-field-plus-pairing'' approach in which\npairing is treated exactly so the number of particles is conserved. To verify\nthe reliability of the formalism, we apply it to the study of both ground-state\nproperties and isoscalar monopole excitations of the Tin isotopes. Methods:\nAccurately-calibrated relativistic mean-field models supplemented by an exact\ntreatment of pairing correlations are used to compute ground-state observables\nalong the isotopic chain in Tin. In turn, ground-state densities are used as\ninput to the calculation of giant monopole resonances through a\nconstrained-relativistic approach. Results: We compute a variety of\nground-state observables sensitive to pairing correlations as well as the\nevolution of giant monopole energies along the isotopic chain in Tin. Whereas\nground-state properties are consistent with experiment, we find that pairing\ncorrelations have a minor effect on the giant monopole energies. Conclusions: A\nnew mean-field-plus-pairing approach is introduced to compute properties of\nopen-shell nuclei. The formalism provides an efficient and powerful alternative\nto the computation of both ground-state properties and monopole energies of\nopen-shell nuclei.

RPA response functions and collective modes Abstract: The spin and density response functions in the random phase approximation\n(RPA) are derived by linearizing the kinetic equation including a magnetic\nfield, the spin-orbit coupling, and mean fields with respect to an external\nelectric field. Different polarization functions appear describing various\nprecession motions showing Rabi satellites due to an effective Zeeman field.\nThe latter turns out to consist of the mean-field magnetization, the magnetic\nfield, and the spin-orbit vector. The collective modes for charged and neutral\nsystems are derived and a threefold splitting of the spin waves dependent on\nthe polarization and spin-orbit coupling is shown. The dielectric function\nincluding spin-orbit coupling, polarization and magnetic fields is presented\nanalytically for long wave lengths and in the static limit. The dynamical\nscreening length as well as the long-wavelength dielectric function shows an\ninstability in charge modes, which are interpreted as spin segregation and\ndomain formation. The spin response describes a crossover from damped\noscillatory behavior to exponentially damped behavior dependent on the\npolarization and collision frequency. The magnetic field causes ellipsoidal\ntrajectories of the spin response to an external electric field and the\nspin-orbit coupling causes a rotation of the spin axes.

Such jets are extremely efficient\ncosmic ray (CR) accelerators which can accelerate the swept up ambient\nparticles on their way to the highest observed CR energies. The bulk of the jet\nkinetic energy is used to accelerate CRs while only a tiny fraction is used to\nproduce the GRB and its afterglow. Here we use the remarkably successful\ncannonball (CB) model of GRBs to show that the bipolar jets from SN explosions,\nwhich produce GRBs most of which are not beamed towards Earth, can be the main\norigin of cosmic rays at all energies.

This test is\napplied by measuring the redshift distribution of a tracer whose evolution in\nnumber density is known. In the past, ordinary galaxies have been used as such\na tracer; however, in the absence of a complete theory of galaxy formation,\nthat method is fraught with difficulties. In this paper, we propose studying\ninstead the evolution of the apparent abundance of dark matter halos as a\nfunction of their circular velocity, observable via the linewidths or rotation\nspeeds of visible galaxies. Upcoming redshift surveys will allow the linewidth\ndistribution of galaxies to be determined at both z~1 and the present day. In\nthe course of studying this test, we have devised a rapid, improved\nsemi-analytic method for calculating the circular velocity distribution of dark\nhalos based upon the analytic mass function of Sheth et al.

The\nfield-theoretical formulation of general relativity helped us to identify the\nphenomenological seeds of such modifications.

Conversely, the\nvalues obtained for zeta_P from the determined perihelion extra-rates of the\ninner planets turn out to be in disagreement with the value which would be\nrequired to accommodate the Pioneer anomaly. As a consequence, the suggested\nexplanation of gravitational origin for the Pioneer anomaly, based on the\nassumption that zeta_P is constant throughout the Solar System, should be\nrejected, at least in its present form. \n\n"}

All the scalars of the supersymmetric standard model become\nultraheavy, except for a single finely tuned Higgs. Yet, the fermions of the\nsupersymmetric standard model can remain light, protected by chiral symmetry,\nand account for the successful unification of gauge couplings. This framework\nremoves all the difficulties of the SSM: the absence of a light Higgs and\nsparticles, dimension five proton decay, SUSY flavor and CP problems, and the\ncosmological gravitino and moduli problems. High-scale SUSY breaking raises the\nmass of the light Higgs to about 120-150 GeV. The gluino is strikingly long\nlived, and a measurement of its lifetime can determine the ultraheavy scalar\nmass scale. Measuring the four Yukawa couplings of the Higgs to the gauginos\nand higgsinos precisely tests for high-scale SUSY. These ideas, if confirmed,\nwill demonstrate that supersymmetry is present but irrelevant for the hierarchy\nproblem -- just as it has been irrelevant for the cosmological constant problem\n-- strongly suggesting the existence of a fine-tuning mechanism in nature. \n\n"}

Such a measurement is necessary for a\nreliable extrapolation of the proton fraction to the higher densities present\nin the neutron star.

In order\nto explore the sensitivity of the various differential flows to the nuclear\nequation of state (EoS) we use three different parameterizations of the scalar-\nand vector mean-fields, i.e. NL2 (soft), NL23 (medium) and NL3 (hard), with\ntheir momentum dependence fitted to the experimental Schrodinger equivalent\npotential (at normal nuclear matter density rho_0) up to kinetic energies of 1\nGeV.

These depend on an\nisovector axial two-body matrix element whose value is yet to be fixed by\nexperiment. Potential model calculations by Kubodera et al. and Ying et al. are\nreproduced for different values of the two-body matrix element. This implies\nthat the differences between the two potential model calculations lie in their\ntreatment of short distance physics. The charged current to neutral current\nnubar-d cross-section ratio is confirmed to be insensitive to short distance\nphysics, and the same ratio is obtained by potential models and the calculation\npresented here, within 5%, for incident incident neutrino energies up to 20\nMeV. The two-body matrix element could be fixed using the parity violating\nprocess epol+d->e+n+p. \n\n"}

Results obtained with the Folded-Yukawa\npotential are shown for comparison. We focus on differences in the isospin\ndependence of the spin-orbit interaction and the effective mass between the\nmodels and their influence on single-particle spectra. While all relativistic\nmodels give a reasonable description of spin-orbit splittings, all\nnon-relativistic models show a wrong trend with mass number. The spin-orbit\nsplitting of heavy nuclei might be overestimated by 40%-80%. Spherical\ndoubly-magic superheavy nuclei are found at (Z=114,N=184), (Z=120,N=172) or\n(Z=126,N=184) depending on the parameterization. The Z=114 proton shell\nclosure, which is related to a large spin-orbit splitting of proton 2f states,\nis predicted only by forces which by far overestimate the proton spin-orbit\nsplitting in Pb208. The Z=120 and N=172 shell closures predicted by the\nrelativistic models and some Skyrme interactions are found to be related to a\ncentral depression of the nuclear density distribution. This effect cannot\nappear in macroscopic-microscopic models which have a limited freedom for the\ndensity distribution only. In summary, our findings give a strong argument for\n(Z=120,N=172) to be the next spherical doubly-magic superheavy nucleus. \n\n"}

The long range\npart of the transition potential is described by exchanges of the pseudoscalar\nmesons ($\\pi$, $K$, $\\eta$), while the vector mesons ($\\rho$, $\\omega$,\n$K^\\ast$) may be considered as the medium- and short-range part in the meson\nexchange picture. We propose the direct quark transition potential as the short\nrange part, which is derived from the matrix elements of the $\\Delta S=1$\neffective weak Hamiltonian in the two baryon states. The results indicate that\nthe direct quark contribution is significantly large and its behavior is\nqualitatively different from the vector meson exchanges. We also find that the\ndecay rate is sensitive to the choice of form factor and that a soft cutoff\nmust be used for the pion-baryon verteces so that the strong tensor transition\nis suppressed.

Abstract: The centrality dependence of (multi-)strange hadron abundances is studied for\nPb(158 AGeV)Pb reactions and compared to p(158 GeV)Pb collisions. The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity. For Omega's, the predicted enhancement can be as\nlarge as one order of magnitude. Comparisons of Pb-Pb data to proton induced\nasymmetric (p-A) collisions are hampered due to the predicted strong asymmetry\nin the various rapidity distributions of the different (strange) particle\nspecies. In p-Pb collisions, strangeness is locally (in rapidity) not\nconserved. The present comparison to the data of the WA97 and NA49\ncollaborations clearly supports the suggestion that conventional (free)\nhadronic scenarios are unable to describe the observed high (anti-)hyperon\nyields in central collisions. The doubling of the strangeness to nonstrange\nsuppression factor, gamma_s \\approx 0.65, might be interpreted as a signal of a\nphase of nearly massless particles. \n\n"}
