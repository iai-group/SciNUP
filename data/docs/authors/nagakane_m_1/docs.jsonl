Validation is crucial as industries and governments depend\nincreasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions. In\nthis article, we survey the model validation literature and propose to\nformulate validation as an iterative construction process that mimics the\nprocess occurring implicitly in the minds of scientists. We thus offer a formal\nrepresentation of the progressive build-up of trust in the model, and thereby\nreplace incapacitating claims on the impossibility of validating a given model\nby an adaptive process of constructive approximation. This approach is better\nadapted to the fuzzy, coarse-grained nature of validation. Our procedure\nfactors in the degree of redundancy versus novelty of the experiments used for\nvalidation as well as the degree to which the model predicts the observations.\nWe illustrate the new methodology first with the maturation of Quantum\nMechanics as the arguably best established physics theory and then with several\nconcrete examples drawn from some of our primary scientific interests: a\ncellular automaton model for earthquakes, an anomalous diffusion model for\nsolar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere, and a computational fluid\ndynamics code for the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability.

Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, but so\nfar, no comparative test has been performed to test their validity. We\ncalculated model spectra of disk models with different geometries and central\nsources, using a 2D radiative transfer code. These spectra were then fitted in\na blind test using four different spectral decomposition methods. We studied\nthe effect of disk structure (flared vs. flat), inclination angle, size of the\ninner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition. Our\nresults show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate\nsystematically from the real chemical composition. Out of the four tested\nspectral decomposition methods, our new two-layer temperature distribution\nmethod, differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show\nthe weakest systematic effects. The reason for the deviations of the results\ngiven by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e.g. single\naverage grain temperature or one component continuum).

Microlensing is sensitive to planets that are\ngenerally inaccessible to other methods, and in particular is most sensitive to\ncool planets at or beyond the snow line, including very low-mass (i.e.\nterrestrial) planets.

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems.

We also find that there\nmay be an optimum disk mass which leads to the observed a-e distribution.

The\nrelevant dynamical properties of young stellar clusters are explored over a\nwide range of possible star formation environments using N-body simulations.\nMany realizations of equivalent initial conditions are used to produce robust\nstatistical descriptions of cluster evolution including the cluster bound\nfraction, radial probability distributions, as well as the distributions of\nclose encounter distances and velocities.

Several formation scenarios have\nbeen proposed, where most combine the canonical oligarchic picture of core\naccretion with type I migration (e.g. Terquem & Papaloizou 2007) and planetary\natmosphere physics (e.g. Alibert et al. 2006). To date, published studies have\nconsidered only a small number of progenitors at late times. This leaves\nunaddressed important questions about the global viability of the models. We\nseek to determine whether the most natural model -- namely, taking the\ncanonical oligarchic picture of core accretion and introducing type I migration\n-- can succeed in forming objects of 10 Earth masses and more in the innermost\nparts of the disc. This problem is investigated using both traditional\nsemianalytic methods for modelling oligarchic growth as well as a new parallel\nmulti-zone N-body code designed specifically for treating planetary formation\nproblems with large dynamic range (McNeil & Nelson 2009).

The planetary radius is evolved\nself-consistently with orbital parameters, under the influence of tidal torques\nand tidal dissipation in the interior of the planet.

This fact combined with the periodicity with which\nthe eclipses occur can be used to detect the companion. Given a sufficient\nprecision of the times of eclipses, the eclipse timing can be employed to\ndetect substellar or even planetary mass companions.\n  The main goal of the paper is to investigate the potential of the photometry\nbased eclipse timing of binary stars as a method of detecting circumbinary\nplanets. In the models we assume that the companion orbits a binary star in a\ncircular Keplerian orbit. We analyze both the space and ground based photometry\ncases. In particular, we study the usefulness of the on-going COROT and Kepler\nmissions in detecting circumbinary planets.

For\nwater, we use the equation of state H2O-REOS based on FT-DFT-MD simulations.\nSome admixture of H/He appears mandatory for explaining the measured radius.\nFor the warmest considered models, the H/He mass fraction can reduce to 10^-3,\nstill extending over ~0.7 REarth. If water occurs, it will be essentially in\nthe plasma phase or in the superionic phase, but not in an ice phase.\nMetal-free envelope models have 0.02<k2<0.2, and the core mass cannot be\ndetermined from a measurement of k2.

The sky-projected angle between the\nspin-axis of HD80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found to\nbe lambda = 42 +/- 8 degrees thanks to the fit of the Rossiter-McLaughlin\nanomaly.

Here, a false alarm is a mistaken identification of a\nplanet as an exo-Earth. We consider two survey strategies designed to mitigate\nthe false alarm problem. The first is to require that for each potential\nexo-Earth, a sufficient number of detections are made to measure the orbit.\nWhen the orbit is known we can determine if the planet is in the habitable\nzone.

We use a physically realistic\nviscosity model derived from N-body simulations (Daisaka et al., 2001), and\ndependent on the disk's local properties (surface mass density, particle size,\ndistance to the planet). Particularly, we include the effects of gravitational\ninstabilities (wakes) that importantly enhance the disk's viscosity. We show\nthat common estimates of the disk's spreading time-scales with constant\nviscosity significantly underestimate the rings' lifetime. With a realistic\nviscosity model, an initially narrow ring undergoes two successive evolutionary\nstages: (1) a transient rapid spreading when the disk is self-gravitating, with\nthe formation of a density peak inward and an outer region marginally\ngravitationally stable, and with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0^2\n(where M_0 is the disk's initial mass) (2) an asymptotic regime where the\nspreading rate continuously slows down as larger parts of the disk become\nnot-self-gravitating due to the decrease of the surface density, until the disk\nbecomes completely not-self-gravitating. At this point its evolution\ndramatically slows down, with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0,\nwhich significantly increases the disk's lifetime compared to the case with\nconstant viscosity. We show also that the disk's width scales like t^{1/4} with\nthe realistic viscosity model, while it scales like t^{1/2} in the case of\nconstant viscosity, resulting in much larger evolutionary time-scales in our\nmodel. We find however that the present shape of Saturn's rings looks like a\n100 million-years old disk in our simulations. Concerning Jupiter's, Uranus'\nand Neptune's rings that are faint today, it is not likely that they were much\nmore massive in the past and lost most of their mass due to viscous spreading\nalone. \n\n"}

We model planet formation on\nthe basis of the core accretion scenario and include several key physical\ningredients. We consider a protoplanetary gas disk that exponentially decays\nwith time. For planetesimals, we allow for a distribution of sizes from 100~m\nto 100~km with most of the mass in the smaller objects. We include planetesimal\nmigration as well as different profiles for the surface density $\\Sigma$ of the\ndisk. The core growth is computed in the framework of the oligarchic growth\nregime and includes the viscous enhancement of the planetesimal capture\ncross-section. Planet migration is ignored. By comparing calculations assuming\nformation of embryos in isolation to calculations with simultaneous embryo\ngrowth, we find that the growth of one embryo generally significantly affects\nthe other. This occurs in spite of the feeding zones of each planet never\noverlapping.

We adopt\nthe measured properties of BP Tau and model the disc accretion onto the star.\nWe observed in simulations that the disc is disrupted by the dipole component\nand matter flows towards the star in two funnel streams which form two\naccretion spots below the dipole magnetic poles. The octupolar component\nbecomes dynamically important very close to the star and it redirects the\nmatter flow to higher latitudes. The spots are meridionally elongated and are\nlocated at higher latitudes, compared with the pure dipole case, where\ncrescent-shaped, latitudinally elongated spots form at lower latitudes. The\nposition and shape of the spots are in good agreement with observations. The\ndisk-magnetosphere interaction leads to the inflation of the field lines and to\nthe formation of magnetic towers above and below the disk. The magnetic field\nof BP Tau is close to the potential only near the star, inside the\nmagnetospheric surface, where magnetic stress dominates over the matter stress.\nA series of simulation runs were performed for different accretion rates.

Abstract: The standard model of planet formation considers an initial phase in which\nplanetesimals form from a dust disk, followed by a phase of mutual\nplanetesimal-planetesimal collisions, leading eventually to the formation of\nplanetary embryos. However, there is a potential transition phase (which we\ncall the \"snowball phase\"), between the formation of the first planetesimals\nand the onset of mutual collisions amongst them, which has often been either\nignored or underestimated in previous studies. In this snowball phase, isolated\nplanetesimals move on Keplerian orbits and grow solely via the direct accretion\nof sub-cm sized dust entrained with the gas in the protoplanetary disk. Using a\nsimplified model in which planetesimals are progressively produced from the\ndust, we consider the expected sizes to which the planetesimals can grow before\nmutual collisions commence and derive the dependence of this size on a number\nof critical parameters, including the degree of disk turbulence, the\nplanetesimal size at birth and the rate of planetesimal creation. For systems\nin which turbulence is weak and the planetesimals are created at a low rate and\nwith relatively small birth size, we show that the snowball growth phase can be\nvery important, allowing planetesimals to grow by a factor of 10^6 in mass\nbefore mutual collisions take over.

Here we suggest a novel solution to the\nhomochirality problem based on a recently proposed thermodynamic dissipation\ntheory for the origin of life. Homochirality is suggested to have been\nincorporated gradually into the emerging life as a result of asymmetric right-\nover left-handed photon-induced denaturation of RNA/DNA occurring when Archean\nsea surface temperatures became close to the denaturing temperatures of\nRNA/DNA. This differential denaturing success would have been promoted by the\nsomewhat right-handed circularly polarized submarine light of the late\nafternoon when surface water temperatures are highest, and a negative circular\ndichroism band extending from 220 nm up to 260 nm for small segments of\nRNA/DNA.

We aim to determine precise S\nabundance in a sample of extremely metal-poor stars taking into account NLTE\nand 3D effects. NLTE profiles of the lines of the multiplet 1 of SI have been\ncomputed using a new model atom for S.

In this study, we examine the possibility that\nshort-period planets were engulfed by their host star evolving off the main\nsequence.

Subsequent\nfragmentation of the ring (not modeled here) would produce a clan of chemically\nhomogenous planetesimals.

Significant diffusion of\nplanetesimal semimajor axes also arises, leading to large-scale spreading of\nthe planetesimal population throughout the inner regions of the protoplanetary\ndisc, in apparent contradiction of constraints provided by the distribution of\nasteroids within the asteroid belt. In this paper, we examine the dynamics of\nplanetesimals embedded in vertically stratified turbulent discs, with and\nwithout dead zones. Our main aims are to examine the turbulent excitation of\nthe velocity dispersion, and the radial diffusion, of planetesimals in these\ndiscs. We employ three dimensional MHD simulations [...], along with an\nequilibrium chemistry model [...] We find that planetesimals in fully turbulent\ndiscs develop large random velocities that will lead to collisional\ndestruction/erosion for bodies with sizes below 100 km, and undergo radial\ndiffusion on a scale \\sim 2.5 au over a 5 Myr disc life time.

Originally targeted with adaptive optics\nbecause it showed a long-term radial velocity acceleration (trend), we have\nmonitored this star with precise Doppler measurements and have now established\na 24 year time baseline. The radial velocity variations show significant\ncurvature (change in the acceleration) including an inflection point. We have\nalso obtained a recent image of HR7672B with NIRC2 at Keck. The astrometry also\nshows curvature. In this paper, we use jointly-fitted Doppler and astrometric\nmodels to calculate the three-dimensional orbit and dynamical mass of the\ncompanion. The mass of the host star is determined using a direct radius\nmeasurement from CHARA interferometry in combination with high resolution\nspectroscopic modeling. We find that HR7672B has a highly eccentric,\n$e=0.50^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$, near edge-on, $i=97.3^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$ deg, orbit with\nsemimajor axis, $a=18.3^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$ AU. The mass of the companion is\n$m=68.7^{+2.4}_{-3.1}M_J$ at the 68.2% confidence level. HR7672B thus resides\nnear the substellar boundary, just below the hydrogen-fusing limit. These\nmeasurements of the companion mass are independent of its brightness and\nspectrum and establish HR7672B as a rare and precious \"benchmark\" brown dwarf\nwith a well-determined mass, age, and metallicity essential for testing\ntheoretical evolutionary models and synthetic spectral models.

Our technique exploits the fact the light curve derived stellar density\nmust be the same for all planets transiting a common star. Assuming a circular\norbit, the derived stellar density departs from the true value by a predictable\nfactor, Psi, which contains information on the eccentricity of the system. By\ncomparing multiple stellar densities, any differences must be due to\neccentricity and thus meaningful constraints can be placed in the absence of\nany other information. The technique, dubbed \"Multibody Asterodensity\nProfiling\" (MAP), is a new observable which can be used alone or in combination\nwith other observables, such as radial velocities and transit timing\nvariations. An eccentricity prior can also be included as desired. MAP is most\nsensitive to the minimum pair-combined eccentricity e.g. (e1 + e2)[min].\nIndividual eccentricity constraints are less stringent but an empirical\neccentricity posterior is always derivable and is freely available from transit\nphotometry alone. We present a description of our technique using both analytic\nand numerical implementations, followed by two example analyses on synthetic\nphotometry as a proof of principle.

The binary has a maximum separation of 1\narcsec with less than 0.1 mags difference between components with identical\nultra-red colors (g-i=1.49+-0.01 mags). The orbit of the mutual components was\nfound to have a period of 961.2+-4.6 days with a semi-major axis of 21000+-160\nkm and eccentricity of 0.1529+-0.0028. The inclination is 15.68+-0.22 degs and\nthe mirror orbit rejected at high confidence. The total system mass is\n7.90+-0.21 x 10^17 kg. Equal-sized, wide binaries and ultra-red colors are\ncommon in the low inclination \"cold\" classical part of the Kuiper Belt and\nlikely formed through some sort of three body interactions within a much denser\nKuiper Belt. To date 2007 TY430 is the only ultra-red, equal-sized binary known\noutside of the classical Kuiper belt. Numerical simulations suggest 2007 TY430\nis moderately unstable in the outer part of the 3:2 resonance and thus 2007\nTY430 is likely an escaped \"cold\" classical object that later got trapped in\nresonance. Similar to the known binaries in the cold classical population, 2007\nTY430 requires a high albedo and very low density to obtain the total mass\nfound. For a realistic minimum density of 0.5 g/cm^3 the albedo of 2007 TY430\nwould be greater than 0.17.

Under the assumption\nthat mm-wave emission of disks is mostly optically thin, these data have been\ngenerally interpreted as evidence for the presence of mm/cm-sized pebbles in\nthe disk outer regions. In this work we investigate the effect of possible\nlocal optically thick regions on the mm-wave emission of protoplanetary disks\nwithout mm/cm-sized grains. A significant local increase of the optical depth\nin the disk can be caused by the concentration of solid particles, as predicted\nto result from a variety of proposed physical mechanisms.

We find that optically thick regions characterized by\nrelatively small filling factors can reproduce the mm-data of young disks\nwithout requesting emission from mm/cm-sized pebbles.

We use a global\nclimate model to simulate the thermal phase variations of Earth-analogs and\ntest whether these data could distinguish between planets with different heat\nstorage and heat transport characteristics. In particular, we consider a\ntemperate climate with polar ice caps (like modern Earth), and a snowball state\nwhere the oceans are globally covered in ice. We first quantitatively study the\nperiodic radiative forcing from, and climatic response to, rotation, obliquity,\nand eccentricity. Orbital eccentricity and seasonal changes in albedo cause\nvariations in the global-mean absorbed flux. The responses of the two climates\nto these global seasons indicate that the temperate planet has 3 times the bulk\nheat capacity of the snowball planet due to the presence of liquid water\noceans. The temperate obliquity seasons are weaker than one would expect based\non thermal inertia alone; this is due to cross-equatorial oceanic and\natmospheric energy transport. Thermal inertia and cross-equatorial heat\ntransport have qualitatively different effects on obliquity seasons, insofar as\nheat transport tends to reduce seasonal amplitude without inducing a phase lag.\nFor an Earth-like planet, however, this effect is masked by the mixing of\nsignals from low thermal inertia regions (sea ice and land) with that from high\nthermal inertia regions (oceans), which also produces a damped response with\nsmall phase lag. We then simulate thermal lightcurves as they would appear to a\nhigh-contrast imaging mission (TPF-I/Darwin) and consider the inverse problem\nof estimating thermal inertia based solely on time-resolved photometry.\n[Abridged] \n\n"}

For a\ngiven mass, many planets have inflated radii, while others are surprisingly\ncompact and may harbor large central cores. Motivated by the observational\nsample, this paper considers possible effects from collisions of smaller rocky\nplanets with gas giant planets. In this scenario, the Jovian planets migrate\nfirst and enter into (approximately) 4 day orbits, whereas rocky planets (mass\n= 0.1-20 that of Earth) migrate later and then encounter the gaseous giants.\nPrevious work indicates that the collision rates are high for such systems.\nThis paper calculates the trajectories of incoming rocky planets as they orbit\nwithin the gaseous planets and are subjected to gravitational, frictional, and\ntidal forces. These collisions always increase the metallicity of the Jovian\nplanets. If the incoming rocky bodies survive tidal destruction and reach the\ncentral regions, they provide a means of producing large planetary cores. Both\nthe added metallicity and larger cores act to decrease the radii of the gas\ngiants at fixed mass. The energy released during these collisions provides the\nJovian planet with an additional heat source; here we determine the radial\nlayers where kinetic energy of the colliding body is dissipated, including the\nenergy remaining upon impact with the existing core. This process could have\nlong-term effects if the colliding body deposits significant energy deep in the\ninterior, in regions of high opacity. Both Hot Jupiters and newly formed gas\ngiants have inflated radii, large enough to allow incoming rocky planets to\nsurvive tidal disruption, enhance the central core mass, and deposit\nsignificant energy (in contrast, denser giant planets with the mass and radius\nof Jupiter are expected to tidally destroy incoming rocky bodies). \n\n"}

This\nwould dramatically narrow the habitable zone of a waterworld. Results from our\nmodel indicate that weathering behavior does not depend strongly on land\nfraction for partially ocean-covered planets.

Light-curve has a\nprominent pre-transit brightening and a less prominent post-transit\nbrightening. Both are caused by the forward scattering and are a strong\nfunction of the particle size. This feature enabled us to estimate a typical\nparticle size (radius) in the dust tail of about 0.1-1 micron. However, there\nis an indication that the particle size changes along the tail. Larger\nparticles better reproduce the pre-transit brightening and transit core while\nsmaller particles are more compatible with the egress and post-transit\nbrightening. Dust density in the tail is a steep decreasing function of the\ndistance from the planet which indicates a significant tail destruction caused\nby the star. We also argue that the 'planet' does not show uniform behaviour\nbut may have at least two constituents. This light-curve with pre-transit\nbrightening is analogous to the light-curve of $\\epsilon$ Aur with mid-eclipse\nbrightening and forward scattering plays a significant role in such eclipsing\nsystems. \n\n"}

Yet, very little\nhas previously been known about the thermal inertia of small asteroids\nincluding NEAs. Observational and theoretical work is reported. The thermal\nemission of asteroids has been observed in the mid-infrared (5-35 {\\mu}m)\nwavelength range using the Spitzer Space Telescope and the 3.0m IRTF. A\ndetailed thermophysical model (TPM) has been developed and extensively tested;\nthis is the first detailed TPM shown to be applicable to NEA data. Our main\nresult is the determination of the thermal inertia of 5 NEAs, increasing the\ntotal number of NEAs with measured thermal inertia to 6. For two of our\ntargets, previously available estimates are refined. Our results allow the\nfirst determination of the typical thermal inertia of NEAs, which is around 300\nJ s^{-1/2} K^{-1} m^{-2}, larger than the typical thermal inertia of large\nmain-belt asteroids (MBAs) by more than an order of magnitude.

The present work aims to better understand the properties of the\nobserved modes and the nature of their excitation.

The planets invoked in that work were\nsignificantly more massive than Jupiter, and moved on orbits that were mutually\ncrossing - an architecture which suggests that mutual encounters and strong\ngravitational interactions are almost guaranteed. In this work, we perform a\nhighly detailed analysis of the proposed HW Vir planetary system. First, we\nconsider the dynamical stability of the system as proposed in the discovery\nwork. Through a mapping process involving 91,125 individual simulations, we\nfind that the system is so unstable that the planets proposed simply cannot\nexist, due to mean lifetimes of less than a thousand years across the whole\nparameter space. We then present a detailed re-analysis of the observational\ndata on HW Vir, deriving a new orbital solution that provides a very good fit\nto the observational data. Our new analysis yields a system with planets more\nwidely spaced, and of lower mass, than that proposed in the discovery work, and\nyields a significantly greater (and more realistic) estimate of the uncertainty\nin the orbit of the outermost body. Despite this, a detailed dynamical analysis\nof this new solution similarly reveals that it also requires the planets to\nmove on orbits that are simply not dynamically feasible. Our results imply that\nsome mechanism other than the influence of planetary companions must be the\nprincipal cause of the observed eclipse timing variations for HW Vir.

In order to\ntrigger the accretion of gas, the core has to grow up to several Earth masses\nbefore the gas component of the protoplanetary disc dissipates. We compute the\nformation of planets, considering the oligarchic regime for the growth of the\nsolid core. Embryos growing in the disc stir their neighbour planetesimals,\nexciting their relative velocities, which makes accretion more difficult. We\ncompute the excitation state of planetesimals, as a result of stirring by\nforming planets, and gas-solid interactions. We find that the formation of\ngiant planets is favoured by the accretion of small planetesimals, as their\nrandom velocities are more easily damped by the gas drag of the nebula.\nMoreover, the capture radius of a protoplanet with a (tiny) envelope is also\nlarger for small planetesimals. However, planets migrate as a result of\ndisc-planet angular momentum exchange, with important consequences for their\nsurvival: due to the slow growth of a protoplanet in the oligarchic regime,\nrapid inward type I migration has important implications on intermediate mass\nplanets that have not started yet their runaway accretion phase of gas. Most of\nthese planets are lost in the central star. Surviving planets have either\nmasses below 10 ME or above several Jupiter masses. To form giant planets\nbefore the dissipation of the disc, small planetesimals (~ 0.1 km) have to be\nthe major contributors of the solid accretion process. However, the combination\nof oligarchic growth and fast inward migration leads to the absence of\nintermediate mass planets.

We\nre-analyse the available HARPS and HIRES Doppler data in an attempt to\ndetermine the false positive rate of our Bayesian data analysis techniques and\nto count the number of Keplerian signals in the GJ 581 data.

This type of\ncomplicated dynamics can affect our interpretation of observed planetary\nsystems that are in or near mean motion resonance. This work shows that\nplanetary systems in (near) mean motion resonance can exhibit nodding behavior,\nand outlines the portion of parameter space where it occurs. This problem is\naddressed using both full numerical integrations of the planetary systems and\nvia model equations obtained through expansions of the disturbing function. In\nthe latter approach, we identify the relevant terms that allow for nodding. The\ntwo approaches are in agreement, and show that nodding often occurs when a\nsmall body is in an external mean motion resonance with a larger planet. As a\nresult, the nodding phenomenon can be important for interpreting observations\nof transit timing variations, where the existence of smaller bodies is inferred\nthrough their effects on larger, observed transiting planets. For example, in\nactively nodding planetary systems, both the amplitude and frequency of the\ntransit timing variations depend on the observational time window. \n\n"}

We confirmed\nthat the spiral arms are formed due to a swing amplification mechanism that\nreinforces density enhancement as a seeded wake. In the damping phase, the\nCoriolis force exerted on a portion of the arm surpasses the gravitational\nforce that acts to shrink the portion. Consequently, the stars in the portion\nescape from the arm, and subsequently they form a new arm at a different\nlocation. The time-dependent nature of the spiral arms are originated in the\ncontinual repetition of this non-linear phenomenon. Since a spiral arm does not\nrigidly rotate, but follows the galactic differential rotation, the stars in\nthe arm rotate at almost the same rate as the arm. In other words, every single\nposition in the arm can be regarded as the co-rotation point. Due to\ninteraction with their host arms, the energy and angular momentum of the stars\nchange, thereby causing the radial migration of the stars. During this process,\nthe kinetic energy of random motion (random energy) of the stars does not\nsignificantly increase, and the disk remains dynamically cold. Owing to this\nlow degree of disk heating, the short-lived spiral arms can recurrently develop\nover many rotational periods. The resultant structure of the spiral arms in the\n$N$-body simulations is consistent with some observational nature of spiral\ngalaxies. We conclude that the formation and structure of spiral arms in\nisolated disk galaxies can be reasonably understood by non-linear interactions\nbetween a spiral arm and its constituent stars. \n\n"}

The wakes, which are excited by the planets, are damped by\nshocks similar to the wake damping in inviscid hydrodynamic (HD) disks. Angular\nmomentum deposition by shock damping opens gaps in both MHD turbulent disks and\ninviscid HD disks even for low mass planets, in contradiction to the \"thermal\ncriterion\" for gap opening. To test the \"viscous criterion\", we compared gap\nproperties in MRI-turbulent disks to those in viscous HD disks having the same\nstress, and found that the same mass planet opens a significantly deeper and\nwider gap in net vertical flux MHD disks than in viscous HD disks. This\ndifference arises due to the efficient magnetic field transport into the gap\nregion in MRI disks, leading to a larger effective \\alpha within the gap. Thus,\nacross the gap, the Maxwell stress profile is smoother than the gap density\nprofile, and a deeper gap is needed for the Maxwell stress gradient to balance\nthe planetary torque density. We also confirmed the large excess torque close\nto the planet in MHD disks, and found that long-lived density features (termed\nzonal flows) produced by the MRI can affect planet migration. The comparison\nwith previous results from net toroidal flux/zero flux MHD simulations\nindicates that the magnetic field geometry plays an important role in the gap\nopening process. Overall, our results suggest that gaps can be commonly\nproduced by low mass planets in realistic protoplanetary disks, and caution the\nuse of a constant \\alpha-viscosity to model gaps in protoplanetary disks. \n\n"}

The\npresence of disk changes the nodal precession rates and directions of the\nplanet orbits. At the place where the two planets achieve the same nodal\nprocessing rate, vertical secular resonance would occur so that mutual\ninclination of the two planets will be excited, which might trigger the Kozai\nresonance between the two planets further. However, in order to pump an inner\nJupiter-like planet, the conditions required for the disk and the outer planet\nare relatively strict.

First, in\nestimating the parameters of some model for the data, the posterior\ndistribution may well be highly multi-modal: a regime in which the convergence\nto stationarity of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques\nbecomes incredibly slow. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models\nthe necessary estimation of the Bayesian evidence for each is, by definition, a\n(possibly high-dimensional) integration over the entire parameter space; again\nthis can be a daunting computational task, although new Monte Carlo (MC)\nintegration algorithms offer solutions of ever increasing efficiency. Nested\nsampling (NS) is one such contemporary MC strategy targeted at calculation of\nthe Bayesian evidence, but which also enables posterior inference as a\nby-product, thereby allowing simultaneous parameter estimation and model\nselection. The widely-used MultiNest algorithm presents a particularly\nefficient implementation of the NS technique for multi-modal posteriors. In\nthis paper we discuss importance nested sampling (INS), an alternative\nsummation of the MultiNest draws, which can calculate the Bayesian evidence at\nup to an order of magnitude higher accuracy than `vanilla' NS with no change in\nthe way MultiNest explores the parameter space.

(ii)\nGap opening magnetically couples and ignites the dead zone near the planet,\nleading to stochastic accretion, a quasi-turbulent flow in the Hill sphere and\na CPD whose structure displays high levels of variability. (iii) Advection of\nmagnetized gas onto the rotating CPD generates helical fields that launch\nmagnetocentrifugally driven outflows. During one specific epoch a highly\ncollimated, one-sided jet is observed. (iv) The CPD's surface density\n$\\sim30{\\rm\\,g\\,cm^{-2}}$, small enough for significant ionization and\nturbulence to develop. (v) The accretion rate onto the planet in the MHD\nsimulation reaches a steady value $8 \\times 10^{-3} {\\rm M_\\oplus yr^{-1}}$,\nand is similar in the viscous hydrodynamic runs. Our results suggest that gas\naccretion onto a forming giant planet within a magnetized PPD with dead zone\nallows rapid growth from Saturnian to Jovian masses. As well as being relevant\nfor giant planet formation, these results have important implications for the\nformation of regular satellites around gas giant planets. \n\n"}

Theoretically, models predict\nthat rocky planets can grow large enough to become gas giants when they reach\n~10 Earth-masses, but the transitional mass remains unknown. Here I show how\ntransit data, interpreted in the context of tidal theory, can reveal the\ncritical radius that separates rocky and gaseous exoplanets. Standard tidal\nmodels predict that rocky exoplanets' orbits are tidally circularized much more\nrapidly than gaseous bodies', suggesting the former will tend to be found on\ncircular orbits at larger semi-major axes than the latter. Well-sampled\ntransits can provide a minimum eccentricity of the orbit, allowing a\nmeasurement of this differential circularization.

We find that atmospheres with a low\nmean-molecular weight have strong day-night temperature variations at pressures\nabove the infrared photosphere that lead to equatorial superrotation. For these\natmospheres, the enhancement of atmospheric opacities with increasing\nmetallicity lead to shallower atmospheric heating, larger day-night temperature\nvariations and hence stronger superrotation. In comparison, atmospheres with a\nhigh mean-molecular weight have larger day-night and equator-to-pole\ntemperature variations than low mean-molecular weight atmospheres, but\ndifferences in opacity structure and energy budget lead to differences in jet\nstructure. The circulation of a water-dominated atmosphere is dominated by\nequatorial superrotation, while the circulation of a CO2-dominated atmosphere\nis instead dominated by high-latitude jets.

The gravitational torque\non the disc from an inclined binary makes the disc precess around the binary\naxis, while the star-disc interaction torque due to the rotation-induced\nquadrupole makes the stellar spin and the disc angular momentum axes precess\naround each other. A significant star-disc misalignment angle can be generated\nfrom a small initial value as the star-disc system evolves in time such that\nthe two precession frequencies cross each other. This ``secular resonance''\nbehavior can be understood in a geometric way from the precession dynamics of\nspin and disc angular momenta. We derive the conditions for such resonance to\noccur, and find that they can be satisfied for reasonable protostar-disc-binary\nparameters. The evolution of star-disc inclination is also affected by mass\naccretion and by magnetic star-disc interaction torques, which can either\npromote or reduce star-disc misalignment. In general, as long as the initial\nbinary-disc inclination is greater than a few degrees, a variety of star-disc\nmisalignment angles can be generated within the disc lifetimes.

Large deviations between the abundances of\nthe host star and its gas giants seem likely to occur if the planet formation\nfollows the core-accretion scenario.

For non-accreting dwarfs we empirically find that\nthe unsigned average large-scale surface field <|Bv|> is related to age as\n$t^{-0.655 \\pm 0.045}$. This relation has a similar dependence to that\nidentified by Skumanich (1972), used as the basis for gyrochronology.

We restrict our exploration to hypothetical systems consisting of a\nsolar-mass star, an Earth-mass planet at 1 AU, and 1 or 2 larger planets. We\nverify that these systems are stable for $10^8$ years with N-body simulations,\nand calculate the obliquity variations induced by the orbital evolution of the\nEarth-mass planet and a torque from the host star. We run a simplified energy\nbalance model on the terrestrial planet to assess surface temperature and ice\ncoverage on the planet's surface, and we calculate differences in the outer\nedge of the habitable zone for planets with rapid obliquity variations. For\neach hypothetical system, we calculate the outer edge of habitability for two\nconditions: 1) the full evolution of the planetary spin and orbit, and 2) the\neccentricity and obliquity fixed at their average values. We recover previous\nresults that higher values of fixed obliquity and eccentricity expand the\nhabitable zone, but also find that obliquity oscillations further expand\nhabitable orbits in all cases.

Current searches for transiting\ncircumbinary planets concentrate on eclipsing binaries, and are therefore\nrestricted to a small fraction of potential hosts.

Using an N-body code we explore how the\nnumber and sequence of transits vary as functions of observing time and orbital\nparameters. The concept is then generalised thanks to a suite of simulated\ncircumbinary systems. Binaries are constructed from RV surveys of the solar\nneighbourhood. They are then populated with orbiting gas giants, drawn from a\nrange of distributions. The binary population is shown to be compatible with\nthe Kepler eclipsing binary catalogue, indicating that the properties of\nbinaries may be as universal as the initial mass function. These synthetic\nsystems produce transiting circumbinary planets occurring on both eclipsing and\nnon-eclipsing binaries. Simulated planets transiting eclipsing binaries are\ncompared with published Kepler detections. We obtain 1) that planets transiting\nnon-eclipsing binaries probably exist in the Kepler data, 2) that observational\nbiases alone cannot account for the observed over-density of circumbinary\nplanets near the stability limit, implying a physical pile-up, and 3) that the\ndistributions of gas giants orbiting single and binary stars are likely\ndifferent. Estimating the frequency of circumbinary planets is degenerate with\nthe spread in mutual inclination. Only a minimum occurrence rate can be\nproduced, which we find to be compatible with 9%. Searching for inclined\ncircumbinary planets may significantly increase the population of known objects\nand will test our conclusions. Their existence, or absence, will reveal the\ntrue occurrence rate and help develop circumbinary planet formation theories. \n\n"}

The agreement of these two values lends credence to the planetary\ninterpretation of the transit signal. The achromatic transit depth, as compared\nbetween Kepler and the Spitzer Space Telescope, supports the same conclusion.\nWe observed seven transits of Kepler-93b with Spitzer, three of which we\nconducted in a new observing mode. The pointing strategy we employed to gather\nthis subset of observations halved our uncertainty on the transit radius ratio\nR_p/R_star.

In agreement with earlier results we find that k_gr is typically\nmuch lower than in the ISM.

Here we propose that an embryo's migration\nhistory determines whether it becomes a hot super-Earth or the core of a giant\nplanet. Systems of hot super-Earths (or mini-Neptunes) form when embryos\nmigrate inward and pile up at the inner edge of the disk. Giant planet cores\nform when inward-migrating embryos become massive enough to switch direction\nand migrate outward. We present simulations of this process using a modified\nN-body code, starting from a swarm of planetary embryos. Systems of hot\nsuper-Earths form in resonant chains with the innermost planet at or interior\nto the disk inner edge. Resonant chains are disrupted by late dynamical\ninstabilities triggered by the dispersal of the gaseous disk. Giant planet\ncores migrate outward toward zero-torque zones, which move inward and\neventually disappear as the disk disperses. Giant planet cores migrate inward\nwith these zones and are stranded at ~1-5 AU. Our model reproduces several\nproperties of the observed extra-solar planet populations.

The bright and\nwell studied HAT-P-7 system is intriguing as several Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM)\nmeasurements found a large projected obliquity in this system, but it was so\nfar not possible to determine if the orbit is polar and/or retrograde. The goal\nof this study is to measure the stellar inclination and hereby the full 3D\nobliquity of the HAT-P-7 system instead of only the 2D projection as measured\nby the RM effect. In addition we provide an updated set of stellar parameters\nfor the star. We use the full set of available observations from Kepler\nspanning Q0-Q17 to produce the power spectrum of HAT-P-7. We extract\noscillation mode frequencies via an MCMC peak-bagging routine, and use the\nresults from this to estimate the stellar inclination angle. Combining this\nwith the projected obliquity from RM and the inclination of the orbital plane\nallows us to determine the stellar obliquity. We use asteroseismology to model\nthe star from the extracted frequencies using two different approaches to the\nmodelling where either the MESA or the GARSTEC stellar evolution codes are\nadopted. Using our updated asteroseismic modelling we find, i.a., the following\nstellar parameters for HAT-P-7: M=1.51{+0.04}{-0.05}Msun,\n$R=2.00{+0.01}{-0.02}Rsun, and age = 2.07{+0.28}{-0.23} Gyr. Our asteroseismic\nmodelling offers a high precision on the stellar parameters, for instance is\nthe uncertainty on age of the order ~11%.

Two competing hypotheses suggest that the\nplanets migrated either through interaction with the protoplanetary disk during\ntheir formation, or by disk-free mechanisms such as gravitational interactions\nwith a third body.

Because of the configuration of a close binary system,\nthese stars have a high rotation rate, which causes a permanent state of high\nstellar activity and copious XUV radiation. The accumulated effects are\nstronger than for exoplanets around single stars, and cause a faster\nevaporation of their atmospheres. We evaluate the effects that stellar\nradiation has on the evaporation of exoplanets around binary systems and on the\nsurvival of these planets. We considered the XUV spectral range to account for\nthe photons that are easily absorbed by a planet atmosphere that is mainly\ncomposed of hydrogen. A more complex atmospheric composition is expected to\nabsorb this radiation more efficiently. We used direct X-ray observations to\nevaluate the energy in the X-rays range and coronal models to calculate the\n(nondetectable) EUV part of the spectrum. The simulations show that exoplanets\nin a close orbit will suffer strong photoevaporation that may cause a total\nloss of atmosphere in a short time. A binary system of two solar-like stars\nwill be highly efficient in evaporating the atmosphere of the planet. These\nsystems will be difficult to find, even if they are dynamically stable.

The standard LK mechanism\nconsists of large-amplitude oscillations in eccentricity and inclination of a\nbinary subject to the quadrupole potential from an outer perturber. Recent work\nhas shown that when the octupole terms are included in the potential, the inner\nbinary can reach more extreme eccentricities as well as undergo orientation\nflips. It is known that pericenter precessions due to short-range effects, such\nas General Relativity and tidal and rotational distortions, can limit the\ngrowth of eccentricity and even suppress standard (quadrupolar) LK\noscillations, but their effect on the octupole-level LK mechanism has not been\nfully explored. In this paper, we systematically study how these short-range\nforces affect the extreme orbital behaviour found in octupole LK cycles. In\ngeneral, the influence of the octupole potential is confined to a range of\ninitial mutual inclinations Itot centered around 90deg (when the inner binary\nmass ratio is <<1), with this range expanding with increasing octupole\nstrength. We find that, while the short-range forces do not change the width\nand location of this \"window of influence\", they impose a strict upper limit on\nthe maximum achievable eccentricity. This limiting eccentricity can be\ncalculated analytically, and its value holds even for strong octupole potential\nand for the general case of three comparable masses. Short-range forces also\naffect orbital flips, progressively reducing the range of Itot within which\nflips are possible as the intensity of these forces increases. \n\n"}

In previous work using the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope, we found evidence to support at least one sub-Earth-sized\nexoplanet orbiting the nearby mid-M dwarf star GJ 436. As a follow up, here we\nused the Hubble Space Telescope to investigate the existence of one of these\ncandidate planets, UCF-1.01, by searching for two transit signals as it passed\nin front of its host star. Interpretation of the data hinges critically on\ncorrectly modeling and removing the WFC3 instrument systematics from the light\ncurves. Building on previous HST work, we demonstrate that WFC3 analyses need\nto explore the use of a quadratic function to fit a visit-long time-dependent\nsystematic. This is important for establishing absolute transit and eclipse\ndepths in the white light curves of all transiting systems. The work presented\nhere exemplifies this point by putatively detecting the primary transit of\nUCF-1.01 with the use of a linear trend. However, using a quadratic trend, we\nachieve a better fit to the white light curves and a reduced transit depth that\nis inconsistent with previous Spitzer measurements. Furthermore, quadratic\ntrends with or without a transit model component produce comparable fits to the\navailable data. Using extant WFC3 transit light curves for GJ436b, we further\nvalidate the quadratic model component by achieving photon-limited model fit\nresiduals and consistent transit depths over multiple epochs. We conclude that,\nwhen we fit for a quadratic trend, our new data contradict the prediction of a\nsub-Earth-sized planet orbiting GJ 436 with the size, period, and ephemeris\nposited from the Spitzer data by a margin of 3.1{\\sigma}. \n\n"}

It has been suggested that\nmultiple scatterings of SN photons by CS dust may explain the non-standard\nreddening law. In this paper, we examine the effect of re-emission of SN\nphotons by CS dust in the infrared (IR) wavelength regime. This effect allows\nthe observed IR light curves to be used as a constraint on the position/size\nand the amount of CS dust. The method was applied to observed near-infrared\n(NIR) SN Ia samples; meaningful upper limits on the CS dust mass were derived\neven under conservative assumptions. We thereby clarify a difficulty associated\nwith the CS dust scattering model as a general explanation for the peculiar\nreddening law, while it may still apply to a sub-sample of highly reddened SNe\nIa.

Unlike Earth, whose atmosphere contains $<10^{-6}$ its total mass, a\nlarge fraction of close-in planets have significant gaseous envelopes,\ncontaining $1 -10\\%$ or more of their total mass. It has been proposed that\nthese close-in planets formed in situ either by delivery of $50-100M_{\\oplus}$\nof rocky material to the inner disc, or in a disc enhanced relative to the\nMMSN.

Such values are\nconsistent with terrestrial planet atmospheres but more than an order of\nmagnitude below atmospheric masses of $1-10\\%$ inferred for many close-in\nexoplanets. In the most optimistic scenario with no core luminosity, post-GI\nenvelope accretion from a depleted gas disc yields atmospheric masses that are\nseveral per cent the core mass.

WASP-85 b orbits its host star every 2.66 days,\nand has a mass of 1.25 M_Jup and a radius of 1.25 R_Jup. The host star is of G5\nspectral type, with magnitude V = 11.2, and lies 141 pc distant. The system has\na K-dwarf binary companion, WASP-85 B, at a separation of ~1.5\". The close\nproximity of this companion leads to contamination of our photometry,\ndecreasing the apparent transit depth that we account for during our analysis.\nAnalysis of the Ca II H+K lines shows strong emission that implies that both\nbinary components are strongly active. WASP-116 b is a warm, mildly inflated\nsuper-Saturn, with a mass of 0.59 M_Jup and a radius of 1.43 R_Jup. It was\ndiscovered orbiting a metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -0.28 dex), cool (T_eff = 5950 K) G0\ndwarf every 6.61 days. WASP-149 b is a typical hot Jupiter, orbiting a G6 dwarf\nwith a period of 1.33 days. The planet has a mass and radius of 1.05 M_Jup and\n1.29 R_Jup, respectively. The stellar host has an effective temperature of\nT_eff = 5750 K and has a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.16 dex. WASP photometry of\nthe system is contaminated by a nearby star; we therefore corrected the depth\nof the WASP transits using the measured dilution. WASP-149 lies inside the\n'Neptune desert' identified in the planetary mass-period plane by Mazeh,\nHolczer & Faigler (2016).\n  We model the modulation visible in the K2 lightcurve of WASP-85 using a\nsimple three-spot model consisting of two large spots on WASP-85 A, and one\nlarge spot on WASP-85 B, finding rotation periods of 13.1+/-0.1 days for\nWASP-85 A and 7.5+/-0.03 days for WASP-85 B. We estimate stellar inclinations\nof I_A = 66.8+/-0.7 degrees and I_B = 39.7+/-0.2 degrees, and constrain the\nobliquity of WASP-85 A b to be psi<27 degrees.

For low-mass\nplanets in an isothermal disk, it is known that there is a strong negative\ntorque on the planet due to its linear perturbation to the disk, causing fast\ninward migration. The current investigation demonstrates that in these same\nisothermal disks, for intermediate-mass planets, there is a strong positive\nnonlinear corotation torque due to the effects of gas being pulled through a\ngap on horseshoe orbits. For intermediate-mass planets, this positive torque\ncan partially or completely cancel the linear (Type I) torque, leading to\nslower or outward migration, even in an isothermal disk. The effect is most\nsignificant for Super-Earth and Sub-Jovian planets, during the transition from\na low-mass linear perturber to a non-linear gap-opening planet, when the planet\nhas opened a so-called 'partial gap'. In this study, numerical calculations of\nplanet-disk interactions calculate these torques explicitly, and scalings are\nempirically constructed for migration rates in this weakly nonlinear regime.\nThese results find outward migration is possible for planets with masses in the\n20 - 100 Earth Mass range. \n\n"}

We find\nthat even when the criterion is satisfied, there are instances when planets\nstill do not open gaps. We stress that gap-opening is not only dependent on\nwhether a planet has the ability to open a gap, but whether it can do so\nquickly enough. This can be expressed as an additional condition on the\ngap-opening timescale versus the crossing time, i.e. the time it takes the\nplanet to cross the region which it is carving out. While this point has been\nbriefly made in the previous literature, our results quantify it for a range of\nprotoplanetary disk properties and planetary masses, demonstrating how crucial\nit is for gap-opening. This additional condition has important implications for\nthe survival of planets formed by core accretion in low mass disks as well as\ngiant planets or brown dwarfs formed by gravitational instability in massive\ndisks. It is particularly important for planets with intermediate masses\nsusceptible to Type III-like migration. For some observed transition disks or\ndisks with gaps, we expect that estimates on the potential planet masses based\non the torque balance gap-opening criterion alone may not be sufficient.

The time-varying abundance of small grains in an\nevolving disk directly affects gas heating by far-ultraviolet photons, while\ndust evolution affects photoevaporation by changing the disk opacity and\nresulting penetration of FUV photons in the disk. Photoevaporative flows, in\nturn, selectively carry small dust grains leaving the larger particles---which\ndecouple from the gas---behind in the disk. We study these effects by\ninvestigating the evolution of a disk subject to viscosity, photoevaporation by\nEUV, FUV and X-rays, dust evolution, and radial drift using a 1-D multi-fluid\napproach (gas + different dust grain sizes) to solve for the evolving surface\ndensity distributions. The 1-D evolution is augmented by 1+1D models\nconstructed at each epoch to obtain the instantaneous disk structure and\ndetermine photoevaporation rates. The implementation of a dust\ncoagulation/fragmentation model results in a marginal decrease in disk\nlifetimes when compared to models with no dust evolution; the disk lifetime is\nthus found to be relatively insensitive to the evolving dust opacity. We find\nthat photoevaporation can cause significant reductions in the gas/dust mass\nratio in the planet-forming regions of the disk as it evolves, and may result\nin a corresponding increase in heavy element abundances relative to hydrogen.\nWe discuss implications for theories of planetesimal formation and giant planet\nformation, including the formation of gas-poor giants.

While gas giant planets are found preferentially around\nmetal-rich host stars, planets smaller than Neptune orbit hosts with a wide\nrange of metallicities. We propose an alternative interpretation of these\nobservations in the framework of a recently developed planet formation\nhypothesis called Tidal Downsizing (TD). We perform population synthesis\ncalculations based on TD, and find that the connection between the populations\nof the gas giant and the smaller solid-core dominated planets is non linear and\nnot even monotonic. While gas giant planets formed in the simulations in the\ninner few AU region follow a strong positive correlation with the host star\nmetallicity, the smaller planets do not. The simulated population of these\nsmaller planets shows a shallow peak in their formation efficiency at around\nthe Solar metallicity.

The fraction of\nFFPs that experiences a close encounter depends on both the stellar density and\nthe initial velocity distribution of the FFPs. Approximately half of the close\nencounters occur within the first 30 Myr, and only 10% occur after 100 Myr.

The stars have nearly the same tidal\nrelaxation factors as gaseous planets and the evolution of their rotation is\nsimilar to that of close-in hot Jupiters: they tidally evolve towards a\nstationary solution. However, stellar rotation may also be affected by stellar\nwind braking. Thus, while the rotation of a quiet host star evolves towards a\nstationary attractor with a frequency ($1+6e^2$) times the orbital mean-motion\nof the companion, the continuous loss of angular momentum in an active star\ndisplaces the stationary solution towards slower values: Active host stars with\nbig close-in companions tend to have rotational periods larger than the orbital\nperiods of their companions. The study of some hypothetical examples shows that\nbecause of tidal evolution, the rules of gyrochronology cannot be used to\nestimate the age of one system with a large close-in companion, no matter if\nthe star is quiet or active, if the current semi-major axis of the companion is\nsmaller than 0.03--0.04 AU.

Here we analyze\nKepler-12b and Kepler-41b atmosphere based on their Kepler phase curve, while\nthe analysis of Kepler-7b was presented elsewhere. The model we used\nefficiently computes reflection and thermal emission contributions to the phase\ncurve, including inhomogeneous atmospheric reflection due to longitudinally\nvarying cloud coverage. We confirm Kepler-12b and Kepler-41b show a westward\nphase shift between the brightest region on the planetary surface and the\nsubstellar point, similar to Kepler-7b.

Therefore it is likely to be present also in planetary\nphase curves that do not allow a direct view of the planetary atmosphere as\nthey contain additional orbital processes.

To use observational resources most\nefficiently we need to know where the largest, most easily detected moons can\nform. We explore the possibility of large exomoons by following the movement of\nwater (H2O) ice lines in the accretion disks around young super-Jovian planets.\nWe want to know how different heating sources in those disks affect the H2O ice\nlines. We simulate 2D rotationally symmetric accretion disks in hydrostatic\nequilibrium around super-Jovian exoplanets. The energy terms in our\nsemi-analytical model -- (1) viscous heating, (2) planetary illumination, (3)\naccretional heating, and (4) stellar illumination -- are fed by precomputed\nplanet evolution tracks. We consider planets accreting 1 to 12 Jupiter masses\nat distances between 1 and 20 AU to a Sun-like star. Accretion disks around\nJupiter-mass planets closer than ~4.5 AU to Sun-like stars do not feature H2O\nice lines, but the most massive super-Jovians can form icy satellites as close\nas ~3 AU to Sun-like stars. Super-Jovian planets forming beyond ~5 AU can host\nMars-mass moons. We study a broad range of disk parameters for planets at 5.2\nAU and find that the H2O ice lines are universally between ~15 and 30 Jupiter\nradii when the last generation of moons is forming. If the abundant population\nof super-Jovian planets at ~1 AU formed in situ, then they should lack giant\nicy moons because their disks did not host H2O ice in the final stages of\naccretion. In the more likely case that these planets migrated to their current\nlocations from beyond a few AU, they might be orbited by large, H2O-rich moons.\nIn this case, Mars-mass ocean moons might be common in the stellar habitable\nzones.

At the stage of core collapse, there is a well-defined,\nconverged characteristic mass for isothermal fragmentation that is comparable\nto the critical Bonner-Ebert mass at the post-shock pressure. The core mass\nfunctions (CMFs) of $t_\\mathrm{coll}$-cores show a deficit of high-mass cores\n($\\gtrsim 7M_\\odot$) compared to the observed stellar initial mass function\n(IMF).

Using 805\nasteroids in our sample that have reference periods in the literature, we find\nthe reliability of our fitted periods is a complicated function of the period,\namplitude, apparent magnitude and other attributes.

For 5-20km diameters, S types\nrotate faster and have lower amplitudes than C types.

Previous work indicates\nthat large values of $Q$ lead to galaxies so dense that planetary orbits cannot\nsurvive long enough for life to develop. Small values of $Q$ lead to delayed\nstar formation, loosely bound galaxies, and compromised heavy element\nretention.

However, the outer parts of the galaxy always allow for\nhabitable planets, so that the value of $Q$ does not have a well-defined upper\nlimit. Moreover, some Galactic Habitable Zones are large enough to support more\npotentially habitable planets than the galaxies found in our universe.

I: Methodology and Typical Results Abstract: We model particle growth in a turbulent, viscously evolving protoplanetary\nnebula, incorporating sticking, bouncing, fragmentation, and mass transfer at\nhigh speeds. We treat small particles using a moments method and large\nparticles using a traditional histogram binning, including a probability\ndistribution function of collisional velocities. The fragmentation strength of\nthe particles depends on their composition (icy aggregates are stronger than\nsilicate aggregates). The particle opacity, which controls the nebula thermal\nstructure, evolves as particles grow and mass redistributes. While growing,\nparticles drift radially due to nebula headwind drag. Particles of different\ncompositions evaporate at \"evaporation fronts\" (EFs) where the midplane\ntemperature exceeds their respective evaporation temperatures. We track the\nvapor and solid phases of each component, accounting for advection and radial\nand vertical diffusion. We present characteristic results in evolutions lasting\n$2 \\times 10^5$ years.

In triple systems,\nsecular Kozai-Lidov cycles and tidal friction (KLCTF) have been shown to reduce\nthe inner orbital period from $\\sim 10^4$ to a few days. Indeed, the majority\nof short-period binaries are observed to possess a third stellar companion.\nUsing secular evolution analysis and population synthesis, we show that KLCTF\nmakes it unlikely for circumbinary transiting planets to exist around\nshort-period binaries. We find the following outcomes. (1) Sufficiently massive\nplanets in tight and/or coplanar orbits around the inner binary can quench the\nKL evolution because they induce precession in the inner binary. The KLCTF\nprocess does not take place, preventing the formation of a short-period binary.\n(2) Secular evolution is not quenched and it drives the planetary orbit into a\nhigh eccentricity, giving rise to an unstable configuration, in which the\nplanet is most likely ejected from the system. (3) Secular evolution is not\nquenched but the planet survives the KLCTF evolution. Its orbit is likely to be\nmuch wider than the currently observed inner binary orbit, and is likely to be\neccentric and inclined with respect to the inner binary. These outcomes lead to\ntwo main conclusions: (1) it is unlikely to find a massive planet on a tight\nand coplanar orbit around a short-period binary, and (2) the properties of\ncircumbinary planets in short-period binaries are constrained by secular\nevolution. \n\n"}

Building upon our previous work, we study the\npossibility that mass loss through Roche lobe overflow (RLO) may affect the\nevolution of these planets, and could possibly transform a hot Jupiter into a\nlower-mass planet (hot Neptune or super-Earth). We focus here on systems in\nwhich the mass loss occurs slowly (\"stable mass transfer\" in the language of\nbinary star evolution) and we compute their evolution in detail with the binary\nevolution code MESA. We include the effects of tides, RLO, irradiation and\nphoto-evaporation of the planet, as well as the stellar wind and magnetic\nbraking. Our calculations all start with a hot Jupiter close to its Roche\nlimit, in orbit around a sun-like star. The initial orbital decay and onset of\nRLO are driven by tidal dissipation in the star. We confirm that such a system\ncan indeed evolve to produce lower-mass planets in orbits of a few days. The\nRLO phase eventually ends and, depending on the details of the mass transfer\nand on the planetary core mass, the orbital period can remain around a few days\nfor several Gyr. The remnant planets have a rocky core and some amount of\nenvelope material, which is slowly removed via photo-evaporation at nearly\nconstant orbital period; these have properties resembling many of the observed\nsuper-Earths and sub-Neptunes.

Previous studies have suggested that planet-induced spiral arms cannot\nexplain some of these spiral patterns, due to the large pitch angle and high\ncontrast of the spiral arms in observations. We have carried out three\ndimensional (3-D) hydrodynamical simulations to study spiral wakes/shocks\nexcited by young planets. We find that, in contrast with linear theory, the\npitch angle of spiral arms does depend on the planet mass, which can be\nexplained by the non-linear density wave theory. A secondary (or even a\ntertiary) spiral arm, especially for inner arms, is also excited by a massive\nplanet. With a more massive planet in the disk, the excited spiral arms have\nlarger pitch angle and the separation between the primary and secondary arms in\nthe azimuthal direction is also larger. We also find that although the arms in\nthe outer disk do not exhibit much vertical motion, the inner arms have\nsignificant vertical motion, which boosts the density perturbation at the disk\natmosphere. Combining hydrodynamical models with Monte-Carlo radiative transfer\ncalculations, we find that the inner spiral arms are considerably more\nprominent in synthetic near-IR images using full 3-D hydrodynamical models than\nimages based on 2-D models assuming vertical hydrostatic equilibrium,\nindicating the need to model observations with full 3-D hydrodynamics.

The disc itself evolves on time-scales of several Myr during which\nboth temperature and density profiles change as matter accretes onto the\ncentral star. Here we use a detailed model of an evolving disc to determine the\ngrowth of planets by pebble accretion and their migration through the disc.\nCores that reach their pebble isolation mass accrete gas to finally form giant\nplanets with extensive gas envelopes, while planets that do not reach pebble\nisolation mass are stranded as ice giants and ice planets containing only minor\namounts of gas in their envelopes. Unlike earlier population synthesis models,\nour model works without any artificial reductions in migration speed and for\nprotoplanetary discs with gas and dust column densities similar to those\ninferred from observations. We find that in our nominal disc model the\nemergence of planetary embryos preferably occurs after approximately 2 Myr in\norder to not exclusively form gas giants, but also ice giants and smaller\nplanets. The high pebble accretion rates ensure that critical core masses for\ngas accretion can be reached at all orbital distances. Gas giant planets\nnevertheless experience significant reduction in semi-major axes by migration.\nConsidering instead planetesimal accretion for planetary growth, we show that\nformation time-scales are too long to compete with the migration time-scales\nand the dissipation time of the protoplanetary disc.

To test this scenario, we searched for young\nplanets by means of direct imaging in the L'-band using the Large Binocular\nTelescope Interferometer mid-infrared camera.

Among the most prominent sulphur-bearing molecules, SO, sulphur\nmonoxide radical, is one of the more ubiquitous and abundant, observed also in\nits isotopic substituted species such as $^{34}$SO and S$^{18}$O. Due to the\nimportance of this simple diatomic system and to face the challenge of modern\nradioastronomical facilities, an extension to THz range of the rare\nisotopologues of sulphur monoxide has been performed. High-resolution\nrotational molecular spectroscopy has been employed to extend the available\ndataset of four isotopic species, SO, $^{34}$SO, S$^{17}$O, and S$^{18}$O up to\nthe 1.5 THz region.

From a physical disk model, where we characterize the\ndisk structure of CY Tau and DoAr 25 at wavelengths shorter than 5 cm, we find\nthat (1) dust continuum emission is optically thin at the observed wavelengths\nand over the spatial scales studied, (2) a constant value of the dust opacity\nis not warranted by our observations, and (3) a high-significance radial\ngradient of the dust opacity spectral index, {\\beta}, is consistent with the\nobserved dust emission in both disks, with low-{\\beta} in the inner disk and\nhigh-{\\beta} in the outer disk.

These candidates often require significant follow-up observations for\nvalidation, so prioritizing planets for habitability from transit data has\nbecome an important aspect of the search for life in the universe. We propose a\nmethod to compare transiting planets for their potential to support life based\non transit data, stellar properties and previously reported limits on planetary\nemitted flux. For a planet in radiative equilibrium, the emitted flux increases\nwith eccentricity, but decreases with albedo. As these parameters are often\nunconstrained, there is an \"eccentricity-albedo degeneracy\" for the\nhabitability of transiting exoplanets. Our method mitigates this degeneracy,\nincludes a penalty for large-radius planets, uses terrestrial mass-radius\nrelationships, and, when available, constraints on eccentricity to compute a\nnumber we call the \"habitability index for transiting exoplanets\" that\nrepresents the relative probability that an exoplanet could support liquid\nsurface water.

Because the radial profile of the\nimposed magnetic field is well constrained, a deterministic calculation of the\ndisk mass flow becomes possible. The vertical disk profiles obtained in Paper I\nimply a stronger magnetization in the inner disk, faster accretion, and a\nsecular depletion of the disk material. Inward transport of solids allows the\ndisk to maintain a broad optical absorption layer even when the grain abundance\nbecomes too small to suppress its ionization. Thus a PPD may show a strong\nmiddle-to-near infrared spectral excess even while its mass profile departs\nradically from the minimum-mass solar nebula. The disk surface density is\nbuffered at $\\sim 30$ g cm$^{-2}$: below this, X-rays trigger strong enough\nmagnetorotational turbulence at the midplane to loft mm-cm sized particles high\nin the disk, followed by catastrophic fragmentation.

We build upon the cosmic rays model scheme of Grenfell et\nal.

Previous studies suggested\nthat planets in the habitable zone that are subject to strong flaring\nconditions have high atmospheric methane concentrations, while their ozone\nbiosignature is completely destroyed. Our current study shows, however, that\nadding cosmic ray induced HOx production can cause a decrease in atmospheric\nmethane abundance of up to 80\\%. Furthermore, the cosmic ray induced HOx\nmolecules react with NOx to produce HNO$_3$, which produces strong HNO$_3$\nsignals in the theoretical spectra and reduces NOx-induced catalytic\ndestruction of ozone so that more than 25\\% of the ozone column remains. Hence,\nan ozone signal remains visible in the theoretical spectrum (albeit with a\nweaker intensity) when incorporating the new cosmic ray induced NOx and HOx\nschemes, even for a constantly flaring M-star case.

Abstract: The obliquities of planet-hosting stars are clues about the formation of\nplanetary systems.

First, Mazeh and coworkers\nrecently used a new technique -- based on the amplitude of starspot-induced\nphotometric variability -- to conclude that spin-orbit alignment is common even\nfor relatively long-period planets, which would not be expected if tides were\nresponsible. We re-examine the data and find a statistically significant\ncorrelation between photometric variability and planetary orbital period that\nis qualitatively consistent with tidal interactions. However it is still\ndifficult to explain quantitatively, as it would require tides to be effective\nfor periods as long as tens of days. Second, Rogers and Lin argued against a\nparticular theory for tidal re-alignment by showing that initially retrograde\nsystems would fail to be re-aligned, in contradiction with the observed\nprevalence of prograde systems. We investigate a simple model that overcomes\nthis problem by taking into account the dissipation of inertial waves and the\nequilibrium tide, as well as magnetic braking. We identify a region of\nparameter space where re-alignment can be achieved, but it only works for\nclose-in giant planets, and requires some fine tuning. Thus, while we find both\nproblems to be more nuanced than they first appeared, the tidal model still has\nserious shortcomings. \n\n"}

Abstract: CEMP-$r/s$ stars are metal-poor stars with enhanced abundances of carbon and\nheavy elements associated with the slow ($s$-) and rapid ($r$-) neutron-capture\nprocess. It is believed that carbon and $s$-elements were accreted from the\nwind of an AGB primary star, a scenario that is generally accepted to explain\nthe formation of CEMP stars that are only enhanced in $s$-elements (CEMP-$s$\nstars). The origin of $r$-element-enrichment in CEMP-$r/s$ stars is debated and\nmany formation scenarios have been put forward. We aim to determine the\nlikelihood of the scenarios proposed to explain the formation of CEMP-$r/s$\nstars. We calculate the frequency of CEMP-$r/s$ stars among CEMP-$s$ stars for\na variety of scenarios, and we compare it with that determined from an observed\nsample of CEMP-$r/s$ stars collected from the literature. The theoretical\nfrequency of CEMP-$r/s$ stars predicted in most scenarios underestimates the\nobserved ratio by at least a factor of 5. If the enrichments in $s$- and\n$r$-elements are independent, the model ratio of CEMP-$r/s$ to CEMP-$s$ stars\nis about 22%, that is approximately consistent with the lowest estimate of the\nobserved ratio. However, this model predicts that about one third of all\ncarbon-normal stars have [Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] higher than 1, and that 40% of all\nCEMP stars have [Ba/Eu]$\\le0$. Stars with these properties are at least ten\ntimes rarer in our observed sample.

Further\ncalculations of the nucleosynthesis of the $i$-process and of the detailed\nevolution of late AGB stars are needed to investigate if this scenario predicts\na CEMP-$r/s$ star frequency consistent with the observations. \n\n"}

Abstract: Brown dwarfs straddle the mass range transition from planetary to stellar\nobjects. There is a relative paucity of brown dwarfs companions around FGKM\nstars compared to exoplanets for orbital periods less than a few years, but\nmost of the short-period brown dwarf companions fully characterised by transits\nand radial velocities are found around F-type stars. We examine the hypothesis\nthat brown dwarf companions could not survive on close orbit around stars with\nimportant convective envelopes because the tides and angular momentum loss\nthrough magnetic breaking should lead to a rapid orbital decay and quick\nengulfment of the companion. We use a classical Skumanich-type braking law, and\nconstant time-lag tidal theory to assess the characteristic timescale for\norbital decay for the brown dwarf mass range as a function of the host\nproperties. We find that F-type stars may host massive companions for a\nsignificantly longer time than G-type stars for a given orbital period, which\nmay explain the paucity of G-type hosts for brown dwarfs with orbital period\nless than 5 days. On the other hand, we show that the small radius of early\nM-type stars contributes to orbital decay timescales that are only half those\nof F-type stars, despite their more efficient tidal dissipation and magnetic\nbraking. For fully convective later type M-dwarfs, orbital decay timescales\ncould be orders of magnitude greater than for F-type stars. For orbital periods\ngreater than 10 days, brown dwarf occurrence should largely be unaffected by\ntidal decay, whatever the mass of the host. On closer orbital periods, the\nrapid engulfment of massive companions could explain the lack of G and K-type\nhosts in the sample of known systems with transiting brown dwarfs. However, the\npaucity of M-type hosts can not be an effect of tidal decay alone, but may be\nthe result of a selection effect in the sample and/or the formation mechanism. \n\n"}

We find the atmosphere is strongly depleted in molecular\nabsorption at visible wavelengths, suggesting a Rayleigh scattering atmosphere\nwith a high geometric albedo approaching 0.75.

Abstract: Astrometry covers a parameter space that cannot be reached by RV or transit\nmethods to detect terrestrial planets on wide orbits. In addition, high\naccuracy astrometric measurements are necessary to measure the inclination of\nthe planet's orbits. Here we investigate the principles of an artefact of the\nastrometric approach. Namely, the displacement of the photo-centre due to\ninhomogeneities in a dust disc around the parent star. Indeed, theory and\nobservations show that circumstellar discs can present strong asymmetries. We\nmodel the pseudo-astrometric signal caused by these inhomogeneities, asking\nwhether a dust clump in a disc can mimic the astrometric signal of an\nEarth-like planet. We show that these inhomogeneities cannot be neglected when\nusing astrometry to find terrestrial planets. We provide the parameter space\nfor which these inhomogeneities can affect the astrometric signals but still\nnot be detected by mid-IR observations. We find that a small cross section of\ndust corresponding to a cometary mass object is enough to mimic the astrometric\nsignal of an Earth-like planet. Astrometric observations of protoplanetary\ndiscs to search for planets can also be affected by the presence of\ninhomogeneities.

In doing so, we aim to explain why super Earths form so frequently\nand how they acquire such a diverse range of compositions. A key feature of our\nmodel is disk inhomogeneities, or planet traps, that act as barriers to rapid\ntype-I migration. The traps we include are the dead zone, which can be caused\nby either cosmic ray or X-ray ionization, the ice line, and the heat\ntransition. We find that in disks with sufficiently long lifetimes ($\\gtrsim$ 4\nMyr), all traps produce Jovian planets. In these disks, planet formation in the\nheat transition and X-ray dead zone produces hot Jupiters while the ice line\nand cosmic ray dead zones produce Jupiters at roughly 1 AU. Super Earth\nformation takes place within short-lived disks ($\\lesssim$ 2 Myr), whereby the\ndisks are photoevaporated while planets are in a slow phase of gas accretion.\nWe find that super Earth compositions range from dry and rocky ($<$ 6 % ice by\nmass) to those with substantial water contents ($>$ 30 % ice by mass).

Magnetically aligned grains are\ncommonly interpreted as the source of polarization. However, self-scattering by\nlarge dust grains with a high enough albedo is another polarization mechanism,\nbecoming a compelling method independent of the spectral index to constrain the\ndust grain size in protoplanetary disks. We study the dust polarization at mm\nwavelength in the dust trapping scenario proposed for transition disks, when a\ngiant planet opens a gap in the disk. We investigate the characteristic\npolarization patterns and their dependence on disk inclination, dust size\nevolution, planet position, and observing wavelength. We combine\ntwo-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interactions with\nself-consistent dust growth models. These size-dependent dust density\ndistributions are used for follow-up three-dimensional radiative transfer\ncalculations to predict the polarization degree at ALMA bands due to scattered\nthermal emission. We find that the polarization pattern of a disk with a\nplanetary gap after 1 Myr of dust evolution shows a distinctive three ring\nstructure. Two narrow inner rings are located at the planet gap edges. For\nincreasing observing wavelengths all three rings slightly change their\nposition, where the innermost and outermost rings move inward. This distance is\ndetectable comparing the results at ALMA bands 3, 6 and 7. Within the highest\npolarized intensity regions the polarization vectors are oriented in the\nazimuthal direction. For an inclined disk there is an interplay between\npolarization originating from a flux gradient and inclination-induced\nquadrupole polarization. For intermediate inclined transition disks the\npolarization degree is as high as ~ 2% at band 3, which is well above the\ndetection limit of future ALMA observations. \n\n"}

The goal of this paper is to compare the efficiency of the\ndifferent methods used to deal with stellar signals to recover extremely\nlow-mass planets despite.

To circumvent this\nproblem, we generated simulated RV measurements including realistic stellar and\nplanetary signals. Different teams analyzed blindly those simulated RV\nmeasurements, using their own method to recover planetary signals despite\nstellar RV signals. By comparing the results obtained by the different teams\nwith the planetary and stellar parameters used to generate the simulated RVs,\nit is therefore possible to compare the efficiency of these different methods.\nThe most efficient methods to recover planetary signals {take into account the\ndifferent activity indicators,} use red-noise models to account for stellar RV\nsignals and a Bayesian framework to provide model comparison in a robust\nstatistical approach.

We use these outcomes to consider which planetary\nsystem architectures maximise the observability of specific signatures, given\nthat signatures should be detected first around systems with optimal\narchitectures (if such systems exist in nature). Giant impact debris is most\nreadily detectable for 0.1-10Mearth planets at 1-5au, depending on detection\nmethod and spectral type. While A stars have putative giant impact debris at\n4-6au consistent with this sweet spot, that of FGK stars is typically <<1au\ncontrary to expectations; an absence of 1-3au giant impact debris could\nindicate a low frequency of terrestrial planets there. Three principles\nmaximise cometary influx from exo-Kuiper belts: a chain of closely separated\nplanets interior to the belt, none of which is a Jupiter-like ejector; planet\nmasses not increasing strongly with distance (for a net inward torque on\ncomets); ongoing replenishment of comets, possibly by embedded low-mass\nplanets.

We\ninvestigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified\nprescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on\nthe disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create\nsignatures similar to those observed in transition disks.

Subsequent analysis showed that at ~1.5\nEarth radii there is a transition from a population of predominantly rocky\nsuper-Earths to non-rocky sub-Neptunes, which must have substantial volatile\nenvelopes. Determining the origin of these highly irradiated rocky planets will\nbe critical to our understanding of low-mass planet formation and the frequency\nof potentially habitable Earth-like planets. These short-period rocky\nsuper-Earths could simply be the stripped cores of sub-Neptunes, which have\nlost their envelopes due to atmospheric photo-evaporation or other processes,\nor they might instead be a separate population of inherently rocky planets,\nwhich never had significant envelopes. Using models of atmospheric\nphoto-evaporation, we show that if most bare rocky planets are the evaporated\ncores of sub-Neptunes then the transition radius should decrease as surveys\npush to longer orbital periods, since on wider orbits only planets with smaller\nless massive cores can be stripped. On the other hand, if most rocky planets\nformed after their disks dissipate then these planets will have formed without\ninitial gaseous envelopes. In this case, we use N-body simulations of planet\nformation to show that the transition radius should increase with orbital\nperiod, due to the increasing solid mass available in their disks.

In disks, the ratios of volatile elements, such as C/O and\nN/O, are regulated by the abundance of the main C, N, O carriers, their ice\nbinding environment, and the presence of snowlines of major volatiles at\ndifferent distances from the central star. We explore the effects of disk\ndynamical processes, molecular compositions and abundances, and ice\ncompositions on the snowline locations of the main C, O and N carriers, and the\nC/N/O ratios in gas and dust throughout the disk.

The goal of this work is to verify which of\nthese two scenarios is more compatible with pebble accretion, and whether we\ncan distinguish observationally between them via the resulting planetary C/O\nratios and core masses. Our results show that, for solar system composition,\nthe C/O ratios will vary but moderately between the two populations, since a\nsignificant amount of carbon and oxygen are locked up in refractories. In this\ncase, we find a strong correlation between the carbon and oxygen abundances and\ncore mass. The C/O ratio variations are more pronounced in the case where we\nassume that all carbon and oxygen are in volatiles. On average, Hot-Jupiters\nforming \"in-situ\" inside the snowline will have higher C/O ratios because they\naccrete less water ice. However, only Hot-Jupiters forming in-situ around stars\nwith C/O=0.8 can have a C/O ratio higher than unity. We finally find that, even\nwith fast pebble accretion, it is significantly easier to form Hot-Jupiters\noutside of the snowline, even if forming these \"in-situ\" is not impossible in\nthe limit of the simplifying assumptions made. \n\n"}

Abstract: High contrast imaging instruments such as GPI and SPHERE are discovering gap\nstructures in protoplanetary disks at an ever faster pace.

In order to constrain planet\nformation models using disk observations, it is crucial to find a robust way to\nquantitatively back out the properties of the gap-opening planets, in\nparticular their masses, from the observed gap properties, such as their depths\nand widths. Combing 2D and 3D hydrodynamics simulations with 3D radiative\ntransfer simulations, we investigate the morphology of planet-opened gaps in\nnear-infrared scattered light images. Quantitatively, we obtain correlations\nthat directly link intrinsic gap depths and widths in the gas surface density\nto observed depths and widths in images of disks at modest inclinations under\nfinite angular resolution. Subsequently, the properties of the surface density\ngaps enable us to derive the disk scale height at the location of the gap $h$,\nand to constrain the quantity $M_{\\rm p}^2/\\alpha$, where $M_{\\rm p}$ is the\nmass of the gap-opening planet and $\\alpha$ characterizes the viscosity in the\ngap.

Searching for the transits of the low-mass planets\ndetected by Doppler surveys is a straightforward way to achieve this goal.\nIndeed, Doppler surveys target the most nearby main-sequence stars, they\nregularly detect close-in low-mass planets with significant transit\nprobability, and their radial velocity data constrain strongly the ephemeris of\npossible transits.

Our numerical hydrodynamic simulations confirm previous\nanalytical results on the dependence of the warp structure on the viscosity and\nthe initial misalignment between the binary and the disc. To study the\nobservational signatures of warps we calculate images in the continuum at\nnear-infrared and sub-millimetre wavelengths and in the pure rotational\ntransition of CO in the sub-millimetre. Warped circumbinary discs show surface\nbrightness asymmetry in near-infrared scattered light images as well as in\noptically thick gas lines at sub-millimetre wavelengths. The asymmetry is\ncaused by self-shadowing of the disc by the inner warped regions, thus the\nstrength of the asymmetry depends on the strength of the warp.

The stars are surrounded by a\ndebris disk which displays a ring-like morphology and strong asymmetries at\nmultiple scales. We aim at studying the likelihood of a scenario where the\nplanet formed closer to the stars in the disk, underwent inward disk-induced\nmigration, and got scattered away by the binary star before being stabilized by\na close encounter (fly-by). We performed semi-analytical calculations and\nnumerical simulations (Swift_HJS package) to model the interactions between the\nplanet and the two stars. We accounted for the migration as a simple force. We\nstudied the LCC kinematics to set constraints on the local density of stars,\nand therefore on the fly-by likelihood. We performed N-body simulations to\ndetermine the effects of the planet trajectories (ejection and secular effects)\nonto the disk morphology. The combination of the migration and mean-motion\nresonances with the binary star (often 1:6) can eject the planet. Nonetheless,\nwe estimate that the fly-by hypothesis decreases the scenario probability to\nless than $10^{-7}$ for a derived local density of stars of 0.11\nstars/pc$^{3}$. We show that the concomitant effect of the planet and stars\ntrajectories induce spiral-features in the disk which may correspond to the\nobserved asymmetries. Moreover, the present disk shape suggests that the planet\nis on an eccentric orbit. The scenario we explored is a natural hypothesis if\nthe planet formed within a disk. Conversely, its low probability of occurrence\nand the fact that HD 106906 b shares some characteristics with other systems in\nSco-Cen (e.g. HIP 78530, in terms of mass ratio and separation) may indicate an\nalternative formation pathway for those objects. \n\n"}

We present a novel idea for detecting planets bound to such mass\ntransfer binaries: we propose that the X-ray light curves of these binaries be\ninspected for signatures of transiting planets. X-ray transits may be the only\nway to detect planets around some systems, while providing a complementary\napproach to optical and/or radio observations in others. Any planets associated\nwith X-ray binaries must be in stable orbits. We consider the range of\nallowable separations and find that orbital periods can be hours or longer,\nwhile transit durations extend upward from about a minute for Earth-radius\nplanets in very close orbits, to hours for Jupiter-radius planets in wider\norbits. The search for planets around mass transfer binaries could begin at\nonce with existing X-ray observations of these systems. If and when a planet is\ndetected around an X-ray binary, the size and mass of the planet may be readily\nmeasured, and it may also be possible to study the transmission and absorption\nof X-rays through its atmosphere.

It is assumed that all debris\ndiscs with icy planetesimals create second generation CO, C and O gas at some\nlevel, and the aim of this paper is to predict that level and assess its\nobservability. We present a new semi-analytical equivalent of the numerical\nmodel of Kral et al.

The\ndetectability of H$_2$O absorption features in transmission spectra depends on\nthe abundance of water vapor in the upper part of the atmosphere. We study the\nthree-dimensional distribution of atmospheric H$_2$O for synchronously rotating\nEarth-sized aquaplanets using the general circulation model (GCM) ROCKE-3D, and\nexamine the effects of total incident flux and stellar spectral type. We\nobserve a more gentle increase of the water vapor mixing ratio in response to\nincreased incident flux than one-dimensional models suggest, in qualitative\nagreement with the climate-stabilizing effect of clouds around the substellar\npoint previously observed in GCMs applied to synchronously rotating planets.\nHowever, the water vapor mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere starts to\nincrease while the surface temperature is still moderate. This is explained by\nthe circulation in the upper atmosphere being driven by the radiative heating\ndue to absorption by water vapor and cloud particles, causing efficient\nvertical transport of water vapor. Consistently, the water vapor mixing ratio\nis found to be well-correlated with the near-infrared portion of the incident\nflux.

Their temperature distribution is\ndetermined by the optical properties of the dust grains, which, among other\nparameters, depend on their radius. However, in most disk studies, only average\noptical properties and thus an average temperature is assumed to account for an\nensemble of grains with different radii. We investigate the impact of\nsubdividing the grain radius distribution into multiple sub-intervals on the\nresulting dust temperature distribution and spectral energy distribution (SED).\nThese quantities were computed for two different scenarios: (1) Radius\ndistribution represented by 16 logarithmically distributed radius intervals,\nand (2) radius distribution represented by a single grain species with averaged\noptical properties (reference). Within the considered parameter range, i.e., of\ngrain radii between 5 nm and 1 mm and an optically thin and thick disk with a\nparameterized density distribution, we obtain the following results: In\noptically thin disk regions, the temperature spread can be as large as ~63% and\nthe relative grain surface below a certain temperature is lower than in the\nreference disk. With increasing optical depth, the difference in the midplane\ntemperature and the relative grain surface below a certain temperature\ndecreases.

Such an ``evaporation-valley' had been predicted by numerical models\npreviously. Here, we develop a minimal model to demonstrate that this valley\nresults from the following fact: the timescale for envelope erosion is the\nlongest for those planets with hydrogen/helium-rich envelopes that, while only\na few percent in weight, double its radius. The timescale falls for envelopes\nlighter than this because the planet's radius remains largely constant for\ntenuous envelopes. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the\nplanet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation,\ntherefore, herds planets into either bare cores ~1.3 Rearth, or those with\ndouble the core's radius (~2.6 Rearth). This process mostly occurs during the\nfirst 100 Myrs when the stars' high energy flux are high and nearly constant.\nThe observed radius distribution further requires that the Kepler planets are\nclustered around 3 Mearth in mass, are born with H/He envelopes more than a few\npercent in mass, and that their cores are similar to the Earth in composition.\nSuch envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks,\nwhile the core composition indicates formation inside the ice-line.

Applying\nour results to the HL Tau disk, we show that a single 30 Earth-mass planet\nembedded in the ring at 68.8~au (B5) can reasonably well reproduce the\npositions of the two major gaps at 13.2 and 32.3 au (D1 and D2), and roughly\nreproduce two other major gaps at 64.2 and 74.7 au (D5 and D6) seen in the mm\ncontinuum. The positions of secondary/tertiary gaps are found to be sensitive\nto the planetary mass and the disk temperature profile, so with accurate\nobservational measurements of the temperature structure the positions of\nmultiple gaps can be used to constrain the mass of the planet. We also comment\non the gaps seen in the TW Hya and HD~163296 disk. \n\n"}

In this work, we numerically explore the\nlong-term evolution, up to $10^5$ yr, of the small moons in a system formed by\nan oblate Saturn and the five largest moons close to the region: Janus,\nEpimetheus, Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys. By using frequency analysis we\ndetermined the stability of the small moons and characterize, through diffusion\nmaps, the dynamical behavior of a wide region of geometric phase space, $a$ vs\n$e$, surrounding them. Those maps could shed light on the possible initial\nnumber of small bodies close to Mimas, and help to better understand the\ndynamical origin of the small satellites. We found that the four small moons\nare long-term stable and no mark of chaos is found for them. Aegaeon, Methone,\nand Anthe could remain unaltered for at least $\\sim0.5$Myr, given the current\nconfiguration of the system. They remain well-trapped in the corotation\neccentricity resonances with Mimas in which they currently librate. However,\nperturbations from nearby resonances, such as Lindblad eccentricity resonances\nwith Mimas, seem responsible for largest variations observed for Methone and\nAnthe. Pallene remains in a non-resonant orbit and it is the more stable, at\nleast for 64 Myr. Nonetheless, it is affected by a quasi-resonance with Mimas,\nwhich induces long-term orbital oscillations of its eccentricity and\ninclination. \n\n"}

In particular, Schwarzschild space curvature (static) and\nframe-dragging (stationary) due to the planet's spin affect the satellite's\norbit.

It is particularly important for terrestrial planets with diverse\nsurface compositions like Earth. Although previous work on unmixing the spectra\nof Earth from disk-integrated multi-band light curves appeared successful, we\npoint out a mathematical degeneracy between the surface colors and their\nspatial distributions. Nevertheless, useful constraints on the spectral shape\nof individual surface types may be obtained from the premise that albedo is\neverywhere between 0 and 1. We demonstrate the degeneracy and the possible\nconstraints using both mock data based on a toy model of Earth, as well as real\nobservations of Earth.

Such observations can be challenging for long period planets, where\nthe transits may last for over a day. Planetary rings will also impact the\nshape of absorption lines in the stellar spectrum, as the planet and rings\ncover different parts of the rotating star (the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect).\nThese line-profile distortions depend on the size, structure, opacity,\nobliquity and sky projected angle of the ring system. For slow rotating stars,\nthis mainly impacts the amplitude of the induced velocity shift, however, for\nfast rotating stars the large velocity gradient across the star allows the line\ndistortion to be resolved, enabling direct determination of the ring\nparameters. We demonstrate that by modeling these distortions we can recover\nring system parameters (sky-projected angle, obliquity and size) using only a\nsmall part of the transit.

We measure the deposition of angular\nmomentum in the disk by spiral shocks of different strength and verify the\nanalytical prediction of Rafikov (2016) for the behavior of this quantity,\nusing shock amplitude (which is potentially observable) as the input variable.\nGood agreement between the theory and numerics is found as we vary shock\namplitude (including highly nonlinear shocks), disk aspect ratio, equation of\nstate, radial profiles of the background density and temperature, and pattern\nspeed of the wave. We show that high numerical resolution is required to\nproperly capture shock-driven transport, especially at low wave amplitudes.

To investigate the atmospheric composition of early Titan for a\nwide range of global (atmosphere + ocean) composition in volatils, we first\ndeveloped a gas-liquid equilibrium model of the NH3-CO2-H2O system, where the\nnon-ideal behavior of both gas and liquid phases, and the speciation of\nvolatiles dissolved in the aqueous phase are taken into account. We show that\nthe relative abundance of CO2 and NH3 determine the composition of Titan's\natmosphere. For CO2/NH3 < 1, CO2 is massively dissolved in the ocean.

The current suite of models allows for both circular and eccentric\norbits in conjunction with photometric effects, such as the primary transit and\nsecondary eclipse, reflected light, thermal emissions, ellipsoidal variations,\nDoppler beaming and superrotation. We discuss our new efforts to expand the\ncapabilities of the software to include more subtle photometric effects\ninvolving reflected and refracted light. We discuss the EXONEST inference\nengine design and introduce our plans to port the current MATLAB-based EXONEST\nsoftware package over to the next generation Exoplanetary Explorer, which will\nbe a Python-based open source project with the capability to employ third-party\nplug-and-play models of exoplanet-related photometric effects. \n\n"}

We find no evidence for\nalkali absorption features, nor evidence of a scattering slope longward of 0.53\nmicrons. The spectrum is indicative of moderate to high metallicity (~100-1000x\nsolar) while moderate metallicity scenarios (~100x solar) require aerosol\nopacity. The optical spectrum also rules out some highly scattering haze\nmodels. We find an increase in transit depth around 0.8 microns in the\ntransmission spectra of 3 different sub-Jovian exoplanets (GJ 436b, HAT-P-26b,\nand GJ 1214b). While most of the data come from STIS, data from three other\ninstruments may indicate this is not an instrumental effect. Only the transit\nspectrum of GJ 1214b is well fit by a model with stellar plages on the\nphotosphere of the host star.

Its relatively high density in combination with the high radar\nalbedo, led to classify the asteroid as a metallic object, possibly a core of a\ndifferentiated body, remnant of \"hit-and-run\" collisions. The detection of\nhydration is, in principle, inconsistent with a pure metallic origin of this\nbody. Here we consider the scenario that the hydration on its surface is\nexogenous and was delivered by hydrated impactors. We show that impacting\nasteroids that belong to families whose members have the 3 m band can deliver\nthe hydrated material to Psyche. We developed a collisional model with which we\ntest all the dark carbonaceous asteroid families, which contain hydrated\nmembers.

To understand if this\nconcurrence reflects an underlying geographical and/or temporal pattern, we\nmust aim at predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of meteoroid impacts on\nEarth. For this purpose we designed, implemented and tested a novel numerical\ntechnique, the \"Gravitational Ray Tracing\" (GRT) designed to compute the\nrelative impact probability (RIP) on the surface of any planet. GRT is inspired\nby the so-called ray-casting techniques used to render realistic images of\ncomplex 3D scenes. In this paper we describe the method and the results of\ntesting it at the time of large impact events.

The microlensing parameters are strongly constrained by the\nlight curve modeling and in particular by the Spitzer-based measurement of the\nmicrolens parallax, $\\pi_\\mathrm{E}$.

To pinpoint the physical parameters, and at the same time to break\nthe parallax degeneracy, we make use of a series of arguments: the $\\chi^2$\nhierarchy, the Rich argument, and a prior Galactic model.

The circumplanetary disc initial conditions\n(density and temperature) are directly drawn from the results of 3D radiative\nhydrodynamical simulations. The disc evolution is taken into account within the\npopulation synthesis. The satellitesimals were assumed to grow via streaming\ninstability. We find that the moons form fast, often within $10^4$ years, due\nto the short orbital timescales in the circumplanetary disc. They form in\nsequence, and many are lost into the planet due to fast type I migration,\npolluting Jupiter's envelope with typically 15 Earth-masses of metals.

Abstract: In the Hall magnetohydrodynamics, the onset condition of the Kelvin Helmholtz\ninstability is solely determined by the Hall effect and is independent of the\nnature of shear flows. In addition, the physical mechanism behind the super and\nsub Alfvenic flows becoming unstable is quite different: the high frequency\nright circularly polarized whistler becomes unstable in the super Alfvenic\nflows whereas low frequency, left circularly polarized ion-cyclotron wave\nbecomes unstable in the presence of sub Alfvenic shear flows. The growth rate\nof the Kelvin Helmholtz instability in the super Alfvenic case is higher than\nthe corresponding ideal magnetohydrodynamic rate. In the sub Alfvenic case, the\nHall effect opens up a new, hitherto inaccessible (to the magnetohydrodynamics)\nchannel through which the partially or fully ionized fluid can become\nKelvin-Helmholtz unstable. The instability growth rate in this case is smaller\nthan the super Alfvenic case owing to the smaller free shear energy content of\nthe flow. When the Hall term is somewhat smaller than the advection term in the\ninduction equation, the Hall effect is also responsible for the appearance of a\nnew overstable mode whose growth rate is smaller than the purely growing Kelvin\nHelmholtz mode. On the other hand, when the Hall diffusion dominates the\nadvection term, the growth rate of the instability depends only on the Alfven\nMach number and is independent of the Hall diffusion coefficient. Further, the\ngrowth rate in this case linearly increase with the Alfven frequency with\nsmaller slope for sub Alfvenic flows. \n\n"}

The observed variability of asymmetric,\ndouble-peaked emission line profiles in about half of such systems could be\ninterpreted as the signature of precession of an eccentric gaseous debris disk.\nThe variability timescales --- from decades down to $1.4$ yr (recently inferred\nfor the debris disk around HE 1349--2305) --- are in rough agreement with the\nrate of general relativistic (GR) precession in the test particle limit.\nHowever, it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can drive such a\nfast, coherent precession of a radially extended (out to $1 R_\\odot$) gaseous\ndisk mediated by internal stresses (pressure). Here we use the linear theory of\neccentricity evolution in hydrodynamic disks to determine several key\nproperties of eccentric modes in gaseous debris disks around WDs. We find a\ncritical dependence of both the precession period and radial eccentricity\ndistribution of the modes on the inner disk radius, $r_\\mathrm{in}$.

Despite its young\nage ($<$1 Gyr), the star presents an anomalously low stellar activity level:\nthe measured logR'$_{\\rm HK}$ activity parameter lies slightly below the basal\nlevel; there is no significant time-variability in the logR'$_{\\rm HK}$ value;\nthere is no detection of the star in the X-rays. We present results of far-UV\nobservations of WASP-18 obtained with COS on board of Hubble Space Telescope\naimed at explaining this anomaly. From the star's spectral energy distribution,\nwe infer the extinction (E(B-V) $\\approx$ 0.01 mag) and then the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) column density for a number of ions, concluding that ISM\nabsorption is not the origin of the anomaly. We measure the flux of the four\nstellar emission features detected in the COS spectrum (CII, CIII, CIV, SiIV).\nComparing the CII/CIV flux ratio measured for WASP-18 with that derived from\nspectra of nearby stars with known age, we see that the far-UV spectrum of\nWASP-18 resembles that of old ($>$5 Gyr), inactive stars, in stark contrast\nwith its young age. We conclude that WASP-18 has an intrinsically low activity\nlevel, possibly caused by star-planet tidal interaction, as suggested by\nprevious studies. Re-scaling the solar irradiance reference spectrum to match\nthe flux of the SiIV line, yields an XUV integrated flux at the planet orbit of\n10.2 erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. We employ the rescaled XUV solar fluxes to models\nof the planetary upper atmosphere, deriving an extremely low thermal mass-loss\nrate of 10$^{-20}$ $M_{\\rm J}$ Gyr$^{-1}$. For such high-mass planets, thermal\nescape is not energy limited, but driven by Jeans escape. \n\n"}

The initial parameter\nvariations include the number, distances and masses of the giant planets and\nthe star type. Linear correlations between the initial number and the initial\ndistances of gas giants and the survival rate of habitable planets were found.\nPlanetary systems consisting of two giant planets are fairly benign to\nterrestrial planets, whereas six giant planets very often lead to a complete\nclearing of the habitable zone. Systems with initial distances of five Hill\nRadii between the giant planets have a high chance to harbour a habitable\nplanet, although more compact systems are very destructive.

By exploring the early stages of disc formation, we introduce\nthe concept of the Maximum Mass Solar Nebula (MMSN), as opposed to the oft-used\nMinimum Mass Solar Nebula (here mmsn). It is evident that almost all\nprotoplanetary discs start their evolution in a strongly self-gravitating\nstate. In agreement with almost all previous work in this area, we conclude\nthat on the scales relevant to planet formation these discs are not\ngravitationally unstable to gas fragmentation, but instead form strong,\ntransient spiral arms. These spiral arms can act as efficient dust traps\nallowing the accumulation and subsequent fragmentation of the dust (but not the\ngas). This phase is likely to populate the disc with relatively large\nplanetesimals on short timescales while the disc is still veiled by a dusty-gas\nenvelope.

Our objective is an assessment of the detectability of molecular\nsignatures in Earth's transit spectra.\n  To this end, we take a limb sequence of representative cloud-free\ntransmission spectra recorded by the space-borne ACE-FTS Earth observation\nmission (Hughes et al., ACE infrared spectral atlases of the Earth's\natmosphere, JQSRT 2014) and combine these spectra to the effective height of\nthe atmosphere.

Around the chemical transition from atomic nitrogen to N2,\nN15N is selectively photodissociated, which results in the enrichment of 15N in\natomic nitrogen. As 15N-enriched atomic nitrogen is converted to ammonia ice\nvia grain surface reactions, the bulk gas is depleted in 15N. The level of 15N\ndepletion in the bulk gas can be up to a factor of two compared to the\nelemental nitrogen isotope ratio, depending on the photodesorption yield of\nammonia ice. Once the nitrogen isotopes are differentially partitioned between\ngas and solids in a molecular cloud, it should remain in the later stages of\nstar formation (e.g., prestellar core) as long as the sublimation of ammonia\nice is inefficient.

We find that\nthe protoplanet initially migrates inwards rapidly, until it opens up a gap in\nthe disc. Thereafter, it either continues to migrate inwards on a much longer\ntimescale or starts migrating outwards. Outward migration occurs when the\nprotoplanet resides within a gap with gravitationally unstable edges, as a high\nfraction of the accreted gas is high angular momentum gas from outside the\nprotoplanet's orbit. The effect of radiative heating from the protoplanet is\ncritical in determining the direction of the migration and the eccentricity of\nthe protoplanet. Gap opening is facilitated by efficient cooling that may not\nbe captured by the commonly used beta-cooling approximation. The protoplanet\ninitially accretes at a high rate (1e-3Mj/yr), and its accretion luminosity\ncould be a few tenths of the host star's luminosity, making the protoplanet\neasily observable (albeit only for a short time).

In\naddition, the amount available to and processing of nitrogen by organisms is\nintricately linked with and provides feedbacks on oxygen and nutrient cycles.\nTo investigate the Earth system nitrogen cycle over geologic history, we have\nconstructed a new nitrogen cycle model: EarthN. This model is driven by mantle\ncooling, links biologic nitrogen cycling to phosphate and oxygen, and\nincorporates geologic and biologic fluxes. Model output is consistent with\nlarge (2-4x) changes in atmospheric mass over time, typically indicating\natmospheric drawdown and nitrogen sequestration into the mantle and continental\ncrust. Critical controls on nitrogen distribution include mantle cooling\nhistory, weathering, and the total Bulk Silicate Earth+atmosphere nitrogen\nbudget. Linking the nitrogen cycle to phosphorous and oxygen levels, instead of\ncarbon as has been previously done, provides new and more dynamic insight into\nthe history of nitrogen on the planet. \n\n"}

Due to the likely faintness of the\nobject in the optical and infrared regime, it has so far eluded detection. We\nset out to re-analyze data acquired by the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer\n(WISE), an all-sky survey well suited for the detection of SSOs. We present a\nnew approach to SSO detection via parallactic fitting. Using the heliocentric\ndistance as a fit parameter, our code transforms groups of three or more single\nobservation point sources to heliocentric coordinates under the assumption that\nall data stem from an object. The fact that the orbit of a distant SSO is\napproximately linear in heliocentric coordinates over long time-scales can be\nutilized to produce candidates, which can then be confirmed with follow-up\nobservations. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by a posteriori\ndetecting the outer SSO Makemake within WISE data. An all-sky search for Planet\nNine yielded no detection. While the postulated Planet Nine eluded detection by\nour algorithm, we tentatively predict that this new approach to moving-object\nanalysis will enable the discovery of new distant SSOs that cannot be\ndiscovered by other algorithms.

Previously, we measured stellar radii to 11%\nprecision using high-resolution spectroscopy; by adding Gaia astrometry, the\nerrors are now 2%.

With a catalog of ~1000 planets with precise properties, we probed\nin fine detail the gap in the planet size distribution that separates two\nclasses of small planets, rocky super-Earths and gas-dominated sub-Neptunes.\nOur previous study and others suggested that the gap may be observationally\nunder-resolved and inherently flat-bottomed, with a band of forbidden planet\nsizes.

Two other important factors that sculpt the distribution are a\nplanet's orbital distance and its host star mass, both of which are related to\na planet's X-ray/UV irradiation history.

We use the Gaia DR2 catalog to measure the relative\nproper motion of VFTS 16 and nearby bright stars to test if this star might\nhave been ejected from the central cluster, R136, via dynamical ejection. We\nfind that the position angle and magnitude of the relative proper motion (0.338\n+/- 0.046 mas/yr, or approximately 80 +\\- 11 km/s) of VFTS 16 are consistent\nwith ejection from R136 approximately 1.5 +/- 0.2 Myr ago, very soon after the\ncluster was formed. There is some tension with the presumed age of VFTS 16\nthat, from published stellar parameters, cannot be greater than 0.9 +0.3/-0.2\nMyr. Older ages for this star would appear to be prohibited due to the absence\nof He I lines in its optical spectrum, since this sets a firm lower limit on\nits effective temperature. The dynamical constraints may imply an unusual\nevolutionary history for this object, perhaps indicating it is a merger\nproduct. Gaia DR2 also confirms that another very massive star in the Tarantula\nNebula, VFTS 72 (alias BI253; O2 III-V(n)((f*)), is also a runaway on the basis\nof its proper motion as measured by Gaia. While its tangential proper motion\n(0.392 +/-0.062 mas/yr or 93 +/-15 km/s) would be consistent with dynamical\nejection from R136 approximately 1 Myr ago, its position angle is discrepant\nwith this direction at the 2$\\sigma$ level.

This polarization feature is\ngenerally believed to be due to an inner aspherical core revealed in the late\nphase, while this polarization feature can also be contributed by the effect of\npolarized-scattered echoes by circumstellar (CS) dust around the SN. In this\npaper, we propose a unique method to distinguish polarization from the SN\nejecta and from the light echo. We quantitatively examine wavelength dependence\nof the polarization created by the scattered echoes for various geometries and\namounts of CS dust. It is found that the polarization in the $U$-band has\ncharacteristic features, i.e., the polarization emerges at an earlier phase\nwith higher polarization degree than that in longer wavelengths. These are due\nto the rapid evolution of the $U$-band light curve as well as higher optical\ndepth of dust in shorter wavelengths. Except for the $U$ band, the polarization\nincreases after the plateau phase, and the polarization degree is generally\nhigher for shorter wavelengths. These polarimetric features can be easily\ndistinguished from the polarization expected from an aspherical core, which\npredicts almost no wavelength dependence.

Then, we conduct two synthetic studies about\nphotometric measurements in order to analyze the influence of observation\ngeometry:\n  First, we introduce the concept of \"efficiency\" of a set of geometries to\nsample the photometric behavior. A set of angular sampling elements (noted as\ngeometry) is efficient if the retrieved Hapke parameters are close to the\nexpected ones. We compared different geometries and found that the principal\nplane with high incidence is the most efficient geometry among the tested ones.\nIn particular, such geometries are better than poorly sampled full BRDF.\n  Second, we test the analysis scheme of a collection of photometric data\nacquired from various locations in order to answer the question: are these\nlocations photometrically homogeneous or not?

As a result, both Jovian and Neptunian Trojans share a common\norigin with the primordial disk population, whose other surviving members\nconstitute today's trans-Neptunian object (TNO) populations.

In contrast, Jovian and\nNeptunian Trojans are observed to be blue. While the absence of ultra-red\nJovian Trojans can be readily explained by the sublimation of volatile material\nfrom their surfaces due to the high flux of solar radiation at 5AU, the lack of\nultra-red Neptunian Trojans presents both a puzzle and a challenge to formation\nmodels.

Assuming that the disc's accretion onto\nthe star is the main process that clears the disc, the atmosphere of the star\nwill show abundance reductions caused by the material accreted by the forming\nplanet(s). If planets are only forming around one star of a binary system, the\nplanet formation process can result in abundance differences in wide binary\nstars, if their natal protoplanetary discs do not interact during planet\nformation. Abundance differences in the atmospheres of wide binaries hosting\ngiant planets have already been observed and linked to the formation location\nof giant planets.

First, we numerically propagated the Cartesian\nequations of motion of the Jovian system for the period under examination, and\nby comparing the results with a suitable set of ephemerides, we derived the\nmain dynamical effects on the target quantities. Using these effects, we built\nan alternative Hamiltonian formulation and used the normal forms theory to\nlocate the resonance and to compute its main amplitude and frequency. From the\nCartesian model we observe that on the timescale considered and with\nephemerides as initial conditions, both the librating argument and the\ndiagnostics are well approximated by considering the mutual gravitational\ninteractions of Jupiter and the Galilean moons (including Callisto), and the\neffect of Jupiter's J2 harmonic.

Second, unlike the planets themselves, the\nTNOs do not orbit on coplanar, circular orbits around the Sun, but move mostly\non inclined, eccentric orbits and are distributed in a complex way. This\nimplies that some process restructured the outer solar system after its\nformation. However, some of TNOs, referred to as Sednoids, move outside the\nzone of influence of the planets. Thus external forces must have played an\nimportant part in the restructuring of the outer solar system.

In\nthe past it was estimated that such close fly-bys are rare during the relevant\ndevelopment stage.

We detail the resonant trapping comparing semi-analytical\nformulae and numerical simulations in the case of two equal-mass coplanar\nplanets trapped in first order resonances. We describe the family of resonant\nstable equilibrium points (zero-amplitude libration orbits) using expanded and\nnon-expanded Hamiltonians. We show that during convergent migration the planets\nevolve along these families of equilibria. Eccentricity damping from the disk\nleads to a final equilibrium configuration that we predict analytically. The\nfact that observed multi-exoplanetary systems are rarely seen in resonances\nsuggests that the resonant configurations achieved by migration can become\nunstable after the removal of the disk. We probe the stability of the\nresonances as a function of planetary mass. To do this, we fictitiously\nincrease the masses of the planets, adiabatically maintaining the low-amplitude\nlibration regime until instability.

Finally, and this is probably the\nmost astrophysically relevant result of this paper, we demonstrate that some\nspectral lines are strongly affected by stellar activity while others are not.\nBy measuring the RVs on two carefully selected subsample of spectral lines, we\ndemonstrate that we can boost by a factor of 2 or mitigate by a factor of 1.6\nthe red noise induced by stellar activity in the 2010 RVs of Alpha Cen B. By\nmeasuring the RVs of each spectral line, we are able to reach the same RV\nprecision as other approved techniques. In addition, this new approach allows\nto demonstrate that each line is differently affected by stellar activity.\nPreliminary results show that studying in details the behaviour of each\nspectral line is probably the key to overcome stellar activity. \n\n"}

As has been\npointed out before, gas accreting into a gap and onto the planet will encounter\nthe planetary dynamo-generated magnetic field. The planetary magnetic field\nproduces an effective cross section through which gas is accreted. Gas outside\nthis cross section is recycled into the protoplanetary disk, hence only a\nfraction of mass that is accreted into the gap remains bound to the planet.\nThis cross section inversely scales with the planetary mass, which naturally\nleads to stalled planetary growth late in the formation process. We show that\nthis method naturally leads to Jupiter-mass planets and does not invoke any\nartificial truncation of gas accretion, as has been done in some previous\npopulation synthesis models. The mass accretion rate depends on the radius of\nthe growing planet after the gap has opened, and we show that so-called\nhot-start planets tend to become more massive than cold-start planets. When\nthis result is combined with population synthesis models, it might show\nobservable signatures of cold-start versus hot-start planets in the exoplanet\npopulation. \n\n"}

Early discoveries of giant exoplanets orbiting near their host\nstars and exoplanets in or near mean motion resonances were interpreted as\nevidence for migration and its crucial role in the beginnings of planetary\nsystems. long-scale migration has been invoked to explain systems of planets in\nmean motion resonant chains consisting of three or more planets linked by\ninteger period ratios. However, recent studies have reproduced specific\nresonant chains in systems via short-scale migration, and eccentricity damping\nhas been shown to capture planets into resonant chains. We investigate whether\nthe observed resonant chains in Kepler-80, Kepler-223, Kepler-60, and\nTRAPPIST-1 can be established through long-scale migration, short-scale\nmigration, and/or only eccentricity damping by running suites of N-body\nsimulations.

A\nlarge span of migration rates were explored for Titan and Iapetus was started\non its local Laplace plane with a circular orbit. The resonance crossing can\ntrigger a chaotic evolution of the eccentricity and the inclination of Iapetus.\nThe outcome of the resonance is highly dependent on the migration rate.

Here, we follow up two perplexing observations\nof the system: 1) the transits appeared shallower than average in 2013 and 2014\nand 2) the parameters derived from a high resolution spectrum of the star\ndiffered from other results using photometry and low resolution spectroscopy.\nWe observe 5 transits of the system with the 61-inch Kuiper telescope in 2016\nand show that they are consistent with photometry from the Kepler spacecraft in\n2009-2013, suggesting that the dusty tail has returned to normal length and\nmass. We also evaluate high resolution archival spectra from the Subaru HDS\nspectrograph and find them to be consistent with a main-sequence Teff=4440 +/-\n70 K star in agreement with the photometry and low resolution spectroscopy.\nThis disfavors the hypothesis that planet disintegration affected the analysis\nof prior high resolution spectra of this star.

The\nobserved trajectory is best explained by an excess radial acceleration $\\Delta\na \\propto r^{-2}$, where $r$ is the distance of `Oumuamua from the Sun.

In this work, we investigate the effect of a\nplanet's own cooling luminosity on its thermal evolution and atmospheric\nmass-loss (core-powered mass-loss) and determine its observational consequences\nfor the radius distribution of small, close-in exoplanets.

Our results match the valley's location, shape and slope in\nplanet radius-orbital period parameter space, and the relative magnitudes of\nthe planet occurrence rate above and below the valley.

The molecules are detected by cross-correlating\nthe observed spectrum of the system with a model planetary spectrum. The method\nhas led to molecular detections of H2O, CO, and TiO in hot Jupiters using large\nground-based telescopes. Critical to this method, however, is the accurate\nremoval of the stellar and telluric features from the observed spectrum, also\nknown as detrending. Previous molecular detections have relied on specific\nchoices of detrending methods and parameters. However, the robustness of\nmolecular detections across the different choices has not been investigated in\ndetail.

We address this question by studying\nsystems formed by a solar-like star and a close-in planet. We focus on the\nstellar wind spinning down the star along its main sequence phase and tidal\ninteraction causing orbital evolution of the systems. Despite recent\nsignificant advances in these fields, all current models use parametric\ndescriptions to study at least one of these effects. Our objective is to\nintroduce simultaneously ab-initio prescriptions of the tidal and braking\ntorques, so as to improve our understanding of the underlying physics. We\ndevelop a 1D numerical model of coplanar circular star-planet systems taking\ninto account stellar structural changes, wind braking and tidal interaction and\nimplement it in a code called ESPEM. We follow the secular evolution of the\nstellar rotation assuming a bi-layer internal structure, and of the semi-major\naxis of the orbit. After comparing our predictions to recent observations and\nmodels, we perform tests to emphasize the contribution of ab-initio\nprescriptions. Our secular model of stellar wind braking reproduces well the\nrecent observations of stellar rotation in open clusters. Our results show that\na planet can affect the rotation of its host star and that the resulting\nspin-up or spin-down depends on the orbital semi-major axis and on the joint\ninfluence of magnetic and tidal effects. The ab-initio prescription for tidal\ndissipation that we used predicts fast outward migration of massive planet\norbiting fast-rotating young stars. Finally, we provide the reader with a\ncriterion based on the system's characteristics that allows us to assess\nwhether or not the planet will undergo orbital decay due to tidal interaction. \n\n"}

Concerning variants of the\nSPH hydro force formulation we consider both the \"vanilla\" SPH and the PSPH\nvariant included in GIZMO. We find, as expected, that the numerical noise\ninherent in these schemes affects turbulence significantly. A high order\nkernel, free of the pairing instability, is necessary. Both schemes can\nadequately simulate MRI turbulence in unstratified shearing boxes with net\nvertical flux. The turbulence, however, dies out in zero-net-flux unstratified\nboxes, probably due to excessive and numerical dissipation. In zero-net-flux\nvertically stratified simulations, MFM can reproduce the MRI dynamo and its\ncharacteristic butterfly diagram for several tens of orbits before ultimately\ndecaying. In contrast, extremely strong toroidal fields, as opposed to\nsustained turbulence, develop in equivalent simulations using SPH MHD. This\nunphysical state in SPH MHD is likely caused by a combination of excessive\nartificial viscosity, numerical resistivity, and the relatively large residual\nerrors in the divergence of the magnetic field remaining even after cleaning\nprocedures are applied. \n\n"}

A super-Earth around the M\n  dwarf Gl686 Abstract: The HArps-n red Dwarf Exoplanet Survey is providing a major contribution to\nthe widening of the current statistics of low-mass planets, through the\nin-depth analysis of precise radial velocity measurements in a narrow range of\nspectral sub-types. As part of that program, we obtained radial velocity\nmeasurements of Gl 686, an M1 dwarf at d = 8.2 pc. The analysis of data\nobtained within an intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess\ndispersion is due to a coherent signal, with a period of 15.53 d. Almost\nsimultaneous photometric observations were carried out within the APACHE and\nEXORAP programs to characterize the stellar activity and to distinguish\nperiodic variations related to activity from signals due to the presence of\nplanetary companions, complemented also with ASAS photometric data. We took\nadvantage of the available radial velocity measurements for this target from\nother observing campaigns. The analysis of the radial velocity composite time\nseries from the HIRES, HARPS and HARPS-N spectrographs, consisting of 198\nmeasurements taken over 20 years, enabled us to address the nature of periodic\nsignals and also to characterize stellar physical parameters (mass,\ntemperature, and rotation). We report the discovery of a super-Earth orbiting\nat a distance of 0.092 AU from the host star Gl 686. Gl 686 b has a minimum\nmass of 7.1 +/- 0.9 MEarth and an orbital period of 15.532 +/- 0.002 d. The\nanalysis of the activity indexes, correlated noise through a Gaussian process\nframework and photometry, provides an estimate of the stellar rotation period\nat 37 d, and highlights the variability of the spot configuration during the\nlong timespan covering 20 yrs. The observed periodicities around 2000 d likely\npoint to the existence of an activity cycle. \n\n"}

Here we study the signature of co-orbital exoplanets in transit surveys\nwhen two planet candidates in the system orbit the star with similar periods.\nSuch pair of candidates could be discarded as false positives because they are\nnot Hill-stable. However, horseshoe or long libration period tadpole co-orbital\nconfigurations can explain such period similarity. This degeneracy can be\nsolved by considering the Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) of each planet. We\nthen focus on the three planet candidates system TOI-178: the two outer\ncandidates of that system have similar orbital period and had an angular\nseparation near $\\pi/3$ during the TESS observation of sector 2. Based on the\nannounced orbits, the long-term stability of the system requires the two\nclose-period planets to be co-orbitals. Our independent detrending and transit\nsearch recover and slightly favour the three orbits close to a 3:2:2 resonant\nchain found by the TESS pipeline, although we cannot exclude an alias that\nwould put the system close to a 4:3:2 configuration. We then analyse in more\ndetail the co-orbital scenario. We show that despite the influence of an inner\nplanet just outside the 2:3 mean-motion resonance, this potential co-orbital\nsystem can be stable on the Giga-year time-scale for a variety of planetary\nmasses, either on a trojan or a horseshoe orbit. We predict that large TTVs\nshould arise in such configuration with a period of several hundred days. We\nthen show how the mass of each planet can be retrieved from these TTVs. \n\n"}

A search of Sonneberg plate archive data also\nenabled us to extend the photometric baseline of this star back more than 50\nyears, and similarly does not re-detect any deep eclipses.

We study a\n\"low-eccentricity\" migration scenario for the formation of USPs, in which a\nlow-mass planet with initial period of a few days maintains a small but finite\neccentricity due to secular forcings from exterior companion planets, and\nexperiences orbital decay due to tidal dissipation. USP formation in this\nscenario requires that the initial multi-planet system have modest\neccentricities ($\\gtrsim 0.1$) or angular momentum deficit. During the orbital\ndecay of the inner-most planet, the system can encounter several apsidal and\nnodal precession resonances that significantly enhance eccentricity excitation\nand increase the mutual inclination between the inner planets. We develop an\napproximate method based on eccentricity and inclination eigenmodes to\nefficiently evolve a large number of multi-planet systems over Gyr timescales\nin the presence of rapid (as short as $\\sim 100$~years) secular planet-planet\ninteractions and other short-range forces. Through a population synthesis\ncalculation, we demonstrate that the \"low-$e$ migration\" mechanism can\nnaturally produce USPs from the large population of {\\it Kepler} multis under a\nvariety of conditions, with little fine tuning of parameters. This mechanism\nfavors smaller inner planets with more massive and eccentric companion planets,\nand the resulting USPs have properties that are consistent with observations. \n\n"}

They\npose challenges to the usual interior rubble-pile structure unless a relatively\nhigh bulk density is assumed. So far, only six large SFRs have been found.\nTherefore, we present a survey of asteroid rotation period using Pan-STARRS 1\ntelescopes during 2016 October 26 to 31 to search more large SFRs and study\ntheir properties. A total of 876 reliable rotation periods are measured, among\nwhich seven are large SFRs, thereby increasing the inventory of known large\nSFRs. These seven newly discovered large SFRs have diverse colors and locations\nin the main asteroid belt, suggesting that the taxonomic tendency and the\nlocation preference in the inner main belt of the six perviously known large\nSFRs could be a bias due to various observational limits. Interestingly, five\nout of the seven newly discovered large SFRs are mid main-belt asteroids.\nConsidering the rare discovery rates of large SFR in the previously similar\nsurveys (Chang et al., 2015, 2016) and the survey condition in this work, the\nchance of detecting a large SFR in the inner main belt seems to be relatively\nlow. This probably suggests that the inner main belt harbors less large SFRs\nthan the mid main belt. From our survey, we also found the drop in number\nappearing at f > 5 rev/day on the spin-rate distribution for the outer\nmain-belt asteroids of D < 3 km, which was reported for the inner and mid main\nbelt by (Chang et al., 2015, 2016). \n\n"}

{"id": "1901.11426", "contents": "Title: The Effects of Gravity on the Climate and Circulation of a Terrestrial\n  Planet Abstract: The climate and circulation of a terrestrial planet are governed by, among\nother things, the distance to its host star, its size, rotation rate,\nobliquity, atmospheric composition and gravity. Here we explore the effects of\nthe last of these, the Newtonian gravitational acceleration, on its atmosphere\nand climate. We first demonstrate that if the atmosphere obeys the hydrostatic\nprimitive equations, which are a very good approximation for most terrestrial\natmospheres, and if the radiative forcing is unaltered, changes in gravity have\nno effect at all on the circulation except for a vertical rescaling. That is to\nsay, the effects of gravity may be completely scaled away and the circulation\nis unaltered. However, if the atmosphere contains a dilute condensible that is\nradiatively active, such as water or methane, then an increase in gravity will\ngenerally lead to a cooling of the planet because the total path length of the\ncondensible will be reduced as gravity increases, leading to a reduction in the\ngreenhouse effect. Furthermore, the specific humidity will decrease, leading to\nchanges in the moist adiabatic lapse rate, in the equator-to-pole heat\ntransport, and in the surface energy balance because of changes in the sensible\nand latent fluxes. These effects are all demonstrated both by theoretical\narguments and by numerical simulations with moist and dry general circulation\nmodels. \n\n"}

For conventionally-discussed signal-to-noise\nratio (S/N) thresholds, S/N ~ 8, the last three methods are roughly comparable\nin terms of both the total number of planets detected and the mass distribution\nof their host stars. However we argue that S/N ~ 25 is a more conservative and\nrealistic S/N threshold. We show analytically and numerically that the decline\nin the number of detections as a function of S/N is very steep for radial\nvelocities, transits, and astrometry, such that the number of expected\ndetections at S/N ~ 25 is more than an order-of-magnitude smaller than at\nconventional S/N thresholds. Indeed, unless Earth-mass planets are very common\nor are packed much closer to their parent stars than in the solar system,\nfuture searches using these methods (as they are currently planned) may not\nyield any reliable Earth-mass planet detections. On the other hand,\nmicrolensing has a much shallower S/N slope than the other techniques and so\nhas much greater sensitivity at realistic S/N thresholds. We show that even if\nall stars have Earth-mass planets at periods of one year (and adopting other\noptimistic assumptions as well), the combined yield of all four techniques\nwould be the detection of only about five such planets at S/N ~ 25. \n\n"}
