Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

The evidence includes the evolution of X-ray afterglows (when X-rays\nare below the cooling frequency), the evolution of the pre-jet break optical\nand X-ray afterglow, and the sharp turn-on observed for some afterglows. Recent\nobservations of short bursts, which are expected to be interacting with a\nconstant density medium, provide a check on the standard afterglow model.\nAlthough radio observations do not support the constant density model for long\nbursts in some cases, the evidence for constant density interaction is strong.\nThe most plausible way to produce such a medium around a massive star is to\nshock the progenitor wind. This requires a smaller termination shock than would\nbe expected, possibly due to a high pressure surroundings, a high progenitor\nvelocity, or the particular evolution leading to a GRB.

This burst has an optically\nbright afterglow of 16.5 magnitude, detected throughout the 170-650nm spectral\nrange of the UVOT on-board Swift.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

In particular the\nC-rich extremely metal-poor stars, most of which show the s-process signature,\nare thought to be associated with chemical yields from the evolved giant phase\nof intermediate mass stars. Models of such AGB stars at extremely low\nmetallicity now exist, and comparison with observation show important\ndiscrepancies, for example with regard to the synthesis of nitrogen.

We calculate stellar masses and photometric redshifts, based on\n~2,000 templates built with stellar and dust emission models fitting the\nUV-to-MIR SEDs of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. We estimate stellar\nmass functions for different redshift intervals. We find that 50% of the local\nstellar mass density was assembled at 0<z<1 (average SFR:0.048 M_sun/yr/Mpc^3),\nand at least another 40% at 1<z<4 (average SFR: 0.074 M_sun/yr/Mpc^3). Our\nresults confirm and quantify the ``downsizing'' scenario of galaxy formation.\nThe most massive galaxies (M>10^12.0 M_sun) assembled the bulk of their stellar\ncontent rapidly (in 1-2 Gyr) beyond z~3 in very intense star formation events\n(producing high specific SFRs). Galaxies with 10^11.5<M/M_sun<10^12.0 assembled\nhalf of their stellar mass before z~1.5, and more than 90% of their mass was\nalready in place at z~0.6. Galaxies with M<10^11.5 M_sun evolved more slowly\n(presenting smaller specific SFRs), assembling half of their stellar mass below\nz~1. About 40% of the local stellar mass density of 10^9.0<M/M_sun<10^11.0\ngalaxies was assembled below z~0.4, most probably through accretion of small\nsatellites producing little star formation. The cosmic stellar mass density at\nz>2.5 is dominated by optically faint (R>25) red galaxies (Distant Red Galaxies\nor BzK sources) which account for ~30% of the global population of galaxies,\nbut contribute at least 60% to the cosmic stellar mass density.

The stars were selected from a near-infrared survey of Fornax and\ninclude the three reddest stars, with presumably the highest mass-loss rates,\nin that galaxy. Such carbon stars probably belong to the intermediate-age\npopulation (2-8 Gyr old and metallicity of [Fe/H] -1) of Fornax. The primary\naim of this paper is to investigate mass-loss rate, as a function of luminosity\nand metallicity, by comparing AGB stars in several galaxies with different\nmetallicities. The spectra of three stars are fitted with a radiative transfer\nmodel. We find that mass-loss rates of these three stars are 4-7x10^-6 Msun\nyr-1. The other two stars have mass-loss rates below 1.3x10^-6 Msun yr-1. We\nfind no evidence that these rates depend on metallicity, although we do suggest\nthat the gas-to-dust ratio could be higher than at solar metallicity, in the\nrange 240 to 800. The C2H2 bands are stronger at lower metallicity because of\nthe higher C/O ratio. In contrast, the SiC fraction is reduced at low\nmetallicity, due to low silicon abundance. The total mass-loss rate from all\nknown carbon-rich AGB stars into the interstellar medium of this galaxy is of\nthe order of 2x10^-5 Msun yr-1. This is much lower than that of the dwarf\nirregular galaxy WLM, which has a similar visual luminosity and metallicity.\nThe difference is attributed to the younger stellar population of WLM. The\nsuppressed gas-return rate to the ISM accentuates the difference between the\nrelatively gas-rich dwarf irregular and the gas-poor dwarf spheroidal galaxies.\nOur study will be useful to constrain gas and dust recycling processes in low\nmetallicity galaxies. \n\n"}

This model differs\nfrom traditional models of supernova debris interacting with external CSM in\nthat here the shell is optically thick and the escape of radiation is delayed.\nWe show that any model attempting to account for SN2006gy's huge luminosity\nwith radiation emitted by ongoing CSM interaction fails for the following basic\nreason: the CSM density required to achieve the observed luminosity makes the\nsame circumstellar envelope opaque, forcing a thermal diffusion solution. In\nour model, the weaker CSM interaction giving rise to SN2006gy's characteristic\nType IIn spectrum and soft X-rays is not linked to the power source of the\nvisual continuum; instead, it arises after the blast wave breaks free of the\nopaque shell into the surrounding wind.

Abstract: Standard calculations suggest that the entropy of our universe is dominated\nby black holes, whose entropy is of order their area in Planck units, although\nthey comprise only a tiny fraction of its total energy.

Therefore, assuming unitarity in black hole evaporation, the\nstandard results suggest that the largest uncertainty in the future quantum\nstate of the universe is due to the Hawking radiation from evaporating black\nholes. However, the entropy of the matter precursors to astrophysical black\nholes is enormously less than that given by area entropy. If unitarity relates\nthe future radiation states to the black hole precursor states, then the\nstandard results are highly misleading, at least for an observer that can\ndifferentiate the individual states of the Hawking radiation. \n\n"}

Such long-period low-mass EBs\nconstitute critical test cases for resolving the long standing discrepancy\nbetween the theoretical and observational mass-radius relations at the bottom\nof the main sequence. It has been suggested that this discrepancy may be\nrelated to strong stellar magnetic fields, which are not properly accounted for\nin current theoretical models.

High resolution observations of the rotation curves for dark\nmatter dominated low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies imply that galactic dark\nmatter halos have a density profile with a flat central core, whereas N-body\nstructure formation simulations predict a divergent (cuspy) density profile at\nthe center. It has been proposed that this problem can be resolved by stellar\nfeedback driving turbulent gas motion that erases the initial cusp. However,\nstrong gravitational lensing prefers a cuspy density profile for galactic\nhalos.

We show that it is important to\ncalculate the precise scalar and tensor primordial power spectra by integrating\nthe full flow and perturbation equations, since values of observables can\ndeviate appreciably from those obtained using typical second-order Taylor\nexpanded approximations in flow parameters. As part of this, we find that a\ncommonly applied approximation for the tensor to scalar ratio, r \\approx 16\nc_s\\epsilon, becomes poor (deviating by as much as 50%) as c_s deviates from 1\nand hence the Taylor expansion including next-to-leading order contribution\nterms involving c_s is required. By integrating the full flow equations, we use\na Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain approach to impose constraints on the parameter\nspace of general single field inflation, and reconstruct the properties of such\nan underlying theory in light of recent cosmic microwave background and\nlarge-scale structure observations. \n\n"}

Spiral galaxies in our sample have observed integrated\nfractional polarization in the range < 1% to 17.6%. At inclinations less than\n50 degrees, the fractional polarization depends mostly on the ratio of random\nto regular magnetic field strength. At higher inclinations, Faraday\ndepolarization associated with the regular magnetic field becomes more\nimportant. The observed degree of polarization is lower (<4%) for more luminous\ngalaxies, in particular those with L_{4.8} > 2 x 10^{21} W/Hz. The polarization\nangle of the integrated emission is aligned with the apparent minor axis of the\ndisk for galaxies without a bar. In our axially symmetric models, the\npolarization angle of the integrated emission is independent of wavelength.\nSimulated distributions of fractional polarization for randomly oriented spiral\ngalaxies at 4.8 GHz and 1.4 GHz are presented.

We consider a\nsemi-realistic system consisting of two matter components with and without\npressure, and both are expanded into the 3rd order in perturbations in a\nself-consistent manner, for the first time. While the pressured component may\nbe identified with baryons or neutrinos, in this paper we mainly explore the\nphysics of the non-linear pressure effect using a toy model in which the Jeans\nlength does not depend on time, i.e., the sound speed decreases as 1/a^{1/2},\nwhere a is the scale factor. The linear analysis shows that the power spectrum\nbelow the so-called filtering scale is suppressed relative to the power\nspectrum of the cold dark matter. Our non-linear calculation shows that the\nactual filtering scale for a given sound speed is smaller than the linear\nfiltering scale by a factor depending on the redshift and the Jeans length. A\n~40% change is common, and our results suggest that, when applied to baryons,\nthe temperature of the Inter-galactic Medium inferred from the filtering scale\nobserved in the flux power spectrum of Lyman-alpha forests would be\nunderestimated by a factor of two, if one used the linear filtering scale to\ninterpret the data. The filtering mass, which is proportional to the filtering\nscale cubed, can also be significantly smaller than the linear theory\nprediction especially at low redshift, where the actual filtering mass can be\nsmaller than the linear prediction by a factor of three. Finally, when applied\nto neutrinos, we find that neutrino perturbations deviate significantly from\nlinear perturbations even below the free-streaming scales, and thus neutrinos\ncannot be treated as linear perturbations. \n\n"}

Given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gas\ndisks, it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation to\nbound clumps. This can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid, for\ninstance by mergers. We present the concept of morphological quenching (MQ)\nusing standard disk instability analysis, and demonstrate its natural\noccurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom-in technique.\nWe show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficient\nto stabilize the gas disk, quench star formation, and turn an early-type galaxy\nred and dead while gas accretion continues. The turbulence necessary for disk\nstability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in the\nabsence of bound star-forming clumps.

Recent work has found a relation between radio luminosity, X-ray\nluminosity, and black hole mass. With the assumption that radio and X-ray\nluminosity are suitable proxies for jet power and accretion power,\nrespectively, a broad fundamental connection between accretion and jet\nproduction is implied. In an effort to refine these links and enhance their\npower, we have explored the above relations exclusively among black holes with\ndirect, dynamical mass-measurements. This approach not only eliminates\nsystematic errors incurred through the use of secondary mass measurements, but\nalso effectively restricts the range of distances considered to a\nvolume-limited sample. Further, we have exclusively used archival data from the\nChandra X-ray Observatory to best isolate nuclear sources. We find log(L_R) =\n(4.80 +/- 0.24) + (0.78 +/- 0.27) log(M_BH) + (0.67 +/- 0.12) log(L_X), in\nbroad agreement with prior efforts.

When the full sample is\nconsidered, masses are predicted less accurately than with the well-known\nM-sigma relation. If obscured AGN are excluded, the plane is potentially a\nbetter predictor than other scaling measures. \n\n"}

In particular, we show that if one records an\nanisotropy signal produced by heavy nuclei of charge Z above an energy E_{thr},\none should record an even stronger (possibly much stronger) anisotropy at\nenergies >E_{thr}/Z due to the proton component that is expected to be\nassociated with the sources of the heavy nuclei. This conclusion remains robust\nwith respect to the parameters characterizing the sources and it does not\ndepend at all on the modelling of astrophysical magnetic fields. As a concrete\nexample, we apply this test to the most recent data of the Pierre Auger\nObservatory. Assuming that the anisotropy reported above 55EeV is not a\nstatistical accident, and that no significant anisotropy has been observed at\nenergies <10EeV, we show that the apparent clustering toward Cen A cannot be\nattributed to heavy nuclei. Similar conclusions are drawn regarding the\napparent excess correlation with nearby active galactic nuclei. We then discuss\na robust lower bound to the magnetic luminosity that a source must possess in\norder to be able to accelerate particles of charge Z up to 100EeV,\nL_B>10^{45}Z^{-2}erg/s. Using this bound in conjunction with the above\nconclusions, we argue that the current PAO data does not support the model of\ncosmic ray origin in active radio-quiet or even radio-loud galaxies. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that the apparent clustering in the direction of Cen A can be\nexplained by the contribution of the last few gamma-ray bursts or magnetars in\nthe host galaxy thanks to the scattering of the cosmic rays on the magnetized\nlobes. \n\n"}

We analyzed all\navailable observations carried out by RXTE on IGR J17473-2721 during its later\noutburst and as well all the available SWIFT/BAT data. The flux of the latter\noutburst rose in ~ one month and then kept roughly constant for the following ~\ntwo months. During this time period, the source was in a low/hard state. The\nsource moved to a high/soft state within the following three days, accompanied\nby the occurrence of an additional outburst at soft X-rays and the end of the\npreceding outburst in hard X-rays. During the decay of this soft outburst, the\nsource went back to a low/hard state within 6 days, with a luminosity 4 times\nlower than the first transition. This shows a full cycle of the hysteresis in\ntransition between the hard and the soft states. The fact that the flux\nremained roughly constant for ~ two months at times prior to the spectral\ntransition to a high/soft state might be regarded as the result of balancing\nthe evaporation of the inner disk and the inward accretion flow, in a model in\nwhich the state transition is determined by the mass flow rate. Such a balance\nmight be broken via an additional mass flow accreting onto the inner disk,\nwhich lightens the extra soft outburst and causes the state transition.\nHowever, the possibility of an origin of the emission from the jet during this\ntime period cannot be excluded.

The model precisely describes the evolution\nof the particle energy spectrum inside the source and takes into account a\nlight-crossing time effect for the produced radiation. The second model assumes\nan intrinsically constant emission of a homogeneous source that travels inside\nthe jet along a curved trajectory, where the activity is produced simply by\ndifferent values of the source's Doppler factor.

Moreover, we find that ambipolar\ndiffusion, not Ohmic dissipation, is responsible for decoupling all the species\nexcept the electrons from the magnetic field, by a density \\approx 3 x 10^12\ncm^-3. Magnetic decoupling precedes the formation of a central stellar object\nand ultimately gives rise to a concentration of magnetic flux (a `magnetic\nwall') outside the hydrostatic core --- as also found by Tassis & Mouschovias\n(2005a,b) through a different approach. At approximately the same density at\nwhich Ohmic dissipation becomes more important than ambipolar diffusion\n(\\gtrsim 7 x 10^12 cm^-3), the grains carry most of the electric charge as well\nas the electric current. The prestellar core remains disclike down to radii ~\n10 AU, inside which thermal pressure becomes important. The magnetic flux\nproblem of star formation is resolved for at least strongly magnetic newborn\nstars by this stage of the evolution, i.e., by a central density \\approx 10^14\ncm^-3.

We find that\nlarge-scale motions of cluster gas disrupt the AGN jets, causing energy to be\ndistributed throughout the centre of the cluster, rather than confined to a\nnarrow angle around the jet axis. Disruption of the jet also leads to the\nappearance of multiple disconnected X-ray bubbles from a long-duration AGN with\na constant luminosity.

We show how this\nanalysis method results in a complete, self consistent picture of the physical\nconditions at both emission sites of the thermal and non-thermal radiation.

Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we\nhave resolved for the first time the radio lobe structure and mapped the\nspectral index of the radio cocoon. The steep spectral index of the radio lobes\nis consistent with optically-thin synchrotron emission; outside the lobes, the\nspectral index is flatter, suggesting an additional contribution from free-free\nemission, and perhaps ongoing ejections near the core. The radio core is not\ndetected, while the X-ray core has a 0.3-8 keV luminosity ~6 x 10^{36} erg/s.\nThe size of the radio cocoon matches that seen in the optical emission lines\nand diffuse soft X-ray emission. The total 5.5-GHz flux of cocoon and lobes is\n~2.1 mJy, which at the assumed distance of 3.9 Mpc corresponds to about 3 times\nthe luminosity of Cas A. The total 9.0-GHz flux is ~1.6 mJy.

A canonical K\\\"{a}hler potential with\n\\textit{minimal coupling} to gravity can resolve the tachyonic instability but\nruns into the $\\eta$-problem. We suggest a model which is free of the\n$\\eta$-problem due to an additional coupling in the K\\\"{a}hler potential which\nis allowed by the Standard Model gauge group. This induces directions in the\npotential which we call K-flat. For a certain value of the new coupling in the\n(N)MSSM, the K\\\"{a}hler potential is special, because it can be associated with\na certain shift symmetry for the Higgs doublets, a generalization of the shift\nsymmetry for singlets in earlier models.

This makes the relation between\nthe observed shear, the intrinsic shear and lensing distortion more simple and\nthus higher-order calculation more easy. The elliptical weight function allows\nus to measure the mutiplemoment of shape of background galaxies more precisely\nby weighting highly to brighter parts of image and moreover to reduce\nsystematic error due to insufficient expansion of the weight function in the\noriginal approach of KSB.

However, until now there has been no\nastrophysical motivation for considering a source highly enriched in heavy\nelements. Here we demonstrate that the outflows from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)\nmay indeed be composed primarily of nuclei with masses A ~ 40-200, which are\nsynthesized as hot material expands away from the central engine. In\nparticular, if the jet is magnetically-dominated (rather than a\nthermally-driven fireball) its low entropy enables heavy elements to form\nefficiently. Adopting the millisecond proto-magnetar model for the GRB central\nengine, we show that heavy nuclei are both synthesized in proto-magnetar winds\nand can in principle be accelerated to energies >1e20 eV in the shocks or\nregions of magnetic reconnection that are responsible for powering the GRB.\nSimilar results may apply to accretion-powered GRB models if the jet originates\nfrom a magnetized disk wind. Depending on the precise distribution of nuclei\nsynthesized, we predict that the average primary mass may continue to increase\nbeyond Fe group elements at the highest energies, possibly reaching the A ~ 90\n(Zirconium), A ~ 130 (Tellurium), or even A ~ 195 (Platinum) peaks. Future\nmeasurements of the UHECR composition at energies >~ 1e20 eV can thus confirm\nor constrain our model and, potentially, probe the nature of GRB outflows. The\nlonger attenuation length of ultra-heavy nuclei through the extragalactic\nbackground light greatly expands the volume of accesible sources and alleviates\nthe energetic constraints on GRBs as the source of UHECRs. \n\n"}

All observed T's are larger than the virial temperature, by up to\n~0.5 keV. This additional heating can be provided in the X-ray brightest\ngalaxies by SNIa's and infall heating, with a SNIa's energy input even lower\nthan in standard assumptions; in the X-ray fainter ones it can be provided by\nSNIa's, whose energy input would be required close to the full standard value\nat the largest sigma_c.

General overview Abstract: The Kepler spacecraft is providing time series of photometric data with\nmicromagnitude precision for hundreds of A-F type stars. We present a first\ngeneral characterization of the pulsational behaviour of A-F type stars as\nobserved in the Kepler light curves of a sample of 750 candidate A-F type\nstars. We propose three main groups to describe the observed variety in\npulsating A-F type stars: gamma Dor, delta Sct, and hybrid stars. We assign 63%\nof our sample to one of the three groups, and identify the remaining part as\nrotationally modulated/active stars, binaries, stars of different spectral\ntype, or stars that show no clear periodic variability. 23% of the stars (171\nstars) are hybrid stars, which is a much larger fraction than what has been\nobserved before. We characterize for the first time a large number of A-F type\nstars (475 stars) in terms of number of detected frequencies, frequency range,\nand typical pulsation amplitudes. The majority of hybrid stars show frequencies\nwith all kinds of periodicities within the gamma Dor and delta Sct range, also\nbetween 5 and 10 c/d, which is a challenge for the current models. We find\nindications for the existence of delta Sct and gamma Dor stars beyond the edges\nof the current observational instability strips. The hybrid stars occupy the\nentire region within the delta Sct and gamma Dor instability strips, and\nbeyond. Non-variable stars seem to exist within the instability strips. The\nlocation of gamma Dor and delta Sct classes in the (Teff,logg)-diagram has been\nextended. We investigate two newly constructed variables 'efficiency' and\n'energy' as a means to explore the relation between gamma Dor and delta Sct\nstars. Our results suggest a revision of the current observational instability\nstrips, and imply an investigation of other pulsation mechanisms to supplement\nthe kappa mechanism and convective blocking effect to drive hybrid pulsations. \n\n"}

While this is a nonlinear phenomenon, the onset of these\nconversions can be examined through a standard stability analysis of the\nlinearized equations of motion. The problem is reduced to a linear eigenvalue\nequation that involves the neutrino density, energy spectrum, angular\ndistribution, and matter density. In the single-angle case, we reproduce\nprevious results and use them to identify two generic instabilities: The system\nis stable above a cutoff density (\"cutoff mode\"), or can approach an asymptotic\ninstability for increasing density (\"saturation mode\"). We analyze multi-angle\neffects on these generic types of instabilities and find that even the\nsaturation mode is suppressed at large densities. For both types of modes, a\ngiven multi-angle spectrum typically is unstable when the neutrino and electron\ndensities are comparable, but stable when the neutrino density is much smaller\nor much larger than the electron density.

They\nare the most luminous objects detected so far within ~ 100 Mpc, the horizon\ndistance of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), so they are considered to\nbe candidate sources of UHECRs. It was recently argued that the energy\nproduction rate in UHECRs is much larger than that in gamma-ray photons of long\nGRBs measured by the Fermi satellite, which, if true, would challenge the view\nthat GRBs can be the sources of UHECRs. We here suggest that many of the low\nluminosity GRBs, due to their low luminosity, can not trigger the current GRB\ndetectors and hence their contribution to the local gamma-ray energy production\nrate is missing.

We show that this SN can be understood within the physics underlying\nthe Delta-m15 relation, and in the framework of pulsating delayed detonation\nmodels originating from a Chandrasekhar mass, white dwarf, but with a\nprogenitor core composed of 80% carbon. We suggest a possible scenario for\nstellar evolution which leads to such a progenitor. We show that the unusual\nlight curve decline can be understood with the same physics as has been used to\nunderstand the Delta-m15 relation for normal SNe Ia. The decline relation can\nbe explained by a combination of the temperature dependence of the opacity and\nexcess or deficit of the peak luminosity, alpha, measured relative to the\ninstantaneous rate of radiative decay energy generation. What differentiates SN\n2001ay from normal SNe Ia is a higher explosion energy which leads to a shift\nof the Ni56 distribution towards higher velocity and alpha < 1. This result is\nresponsible for the fast rise and slow decline. We define a class of SN\n2001ay-like SNe Ia, which will show an anti-Phillips relation. \n\n"}

The spectra follow the evolution of the nova when the lines had\nstrong P Cygni profiles to a phase dominated by prominent emission lines.

Dust formation in V496 Sct is consistent with the\npresence of lines of elements with low ionization potentials like Na and Mg in\nthe early spectra and the detection of CO bands in emission. The light curve\nshows a slow rise to the maximum and a slow decline indicating a prolonged mass\nloss. This is corroborated by the strengthening of P Cygni profiles during the\nfirst 30 days.

A systematic search\nyields three z~9-10 candidates. While we have already reported the most robust\nof these candidates, MACS1149-JD, two additional z~9 candidates are also found\nand have H_{160}-band magnitudes of ~26.2-26.9.

To\ndetermine the implications of these search results for the LF and SFR density\nat z~9, we introduce a new differential approach to deriving these quantities\nin lensing fields. Our procedure is to derive the evolution by comparing the\nnumber of z~9-10 galaxy candidates found in CLASH with the number of galaxies\nin a slightly lower redshift sample (after correcting for the differences in\nselection volumes), here taken to be z~8. This procedure takes advantage of the\nfact that the relative volumes available for the z~8 and z~9-10 selections\nbehind lensing clusters are not greatly dependent on the details of the lensing\nmodels.

Such\nan approach is needed to dynamically model the data from ongoing spectroscopic\nsurveys of the Galaxy and in the future Gaia. This approach describes the orbit\ndistribution of stars by a family of parametrized distribution function (DF)\nproposed by McMillan and Binney, which are based on actions. We find that these\nparametrized DFs are flexible enough to capture well the observed phase-space\ndistributions of individual abundance-selected Galactic subpopulations of stars\n(`mono-abundance populations') for a disc-like gravitational potential, which\nenables independent dynamical constraints from each of the Galactic\nmono-abundance populations. We lay out a statistically rigorous way to\nconstrain the Galactic potential parameters by constructing the joint\nlikelihood of potential and DF parameters, and subsequently marginalizing over\nthe DF parameters. This approach explicitly incorporates the spatial selection\nfunction inherent to all Galactic surveys, and can account for the\nuncertainties of the individual position--velocity observations. On that basis,\nwe study the precision of the parameters of the Galactic potential that can be\nreached with various sample sizes and realistic spatial selection functions.

The tower consists of a continuous set of massive scalar\nfields with a gaussian mass distribution. We show that, in a certain region of\nthe parameter space, the {\\it heavy} modes of the tower (those with masses much\nlarger than the Hubble expansion rate) dominate at early times and make the\ntower behave like the usual single scalar field whose coherent oscillations\naround the minimum of the potential give a matter-like contribution. On the\nother hand, at late times, the {\\it light} modes (those with masses much\nsmaller than the Hubble expansion rate) overcome the energy density of the\ntower and they behave like a perfect fluid with equation of state ranging from\n0 to -1, depending on the spectral index of the initial spectrum.

Several mysteries cloud the interpretation\nof this event: (1) extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray\nlight curve during the first 10 days after the gamma-ray trigger; (2)\nunexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission months after\ntrigger; (3) no obvious evidence for jet precession, despite misalignment\ntypically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disk and BH;\n(4) recent abrupt shut-off in jet X-ray emission after 1.5 years. Here we show\nthat all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one\nassumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Phi threading the BH.\nInitially, Phi is weak relative to high fall-back mass accretion rate, Mdot,\nand the disk and jets precess about the BH axis = our line of sight. As Mdot\ndrops, Phi becomes dynamically important and leads to a magnetically-arrested\ndisk (MAD). MAD naturally aligns disk and jet axis along the BH spin axis, but\nonly after a violent rearrangement phase (jet wobbling). This explains the\nerratic light curve at early times and the lack of precession at later times.\nWe use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain BH and disrupted star\nproperties, finding that a solar-mass main sequence star disrupted by a\nrelatively low mass, M~10^5-10^6 Msun, BH is consistent with the data, while a\nWD disruption (though still possible) is disfavored.

In this work, we give an account of the perturbations at\nlinear order in this model. Our analysis uncovers two novel phenomena. First,\nthe amplitude of scalar curvature perturbations is not directly tied to the\nshape of the inflationary potential. This allows the theory to violate na\\\"ive\nformulations of the Lyth bound. Second, the tensor sector of the theory is\nsignificantly altered from the usual case: the non-Abelian gauge field\nperturbations have a tensor degree of freedom. One chirality of the this tensor\ncan be exponentially enhanced by a temporary instability near horizon crossing;\nthis chiral instability exists because of the classical gauge field background,\nwhich violates parity. These tensor fluctuations of the gauge field also couple\nto gravitational waves at linear order in perturbation theory and source a\nchiral spectrum of gravitational waves. This spectrum can be exponentially\nenhanced over the usual inflationary spectrum due to the instability in the\ngauge sector. These new features cause the theory in its present form to be in\nsignificant tension with current observational data. This is because the new\nscalar physics leads to a significant reddening of the spectral tilt in the\nsame region of parameter space where the exponential enhancement of the\ngravitational wave amplitude is small enough to satisfy current constraints on\nthe tensor-to-scalar index.

Abstract: The origin of the high X-ray luminosities of most ultraluminous X-ray sources\n(ULXs) still remains poorly understood. Most of the scenarios proposed to\nexplain their nature assume that ULXs are powered by accretion on to a black\nhole (BH). In this case, the detection of compact radio emission and the\nlocation of the ULXs in the Fundamental Plane (X-ray versus radio-luminosity\nplane) can provide an estimate of the ULX BH mass and help address the question\nof their physical nature. We present the results of a high-resolution (very\nlong baseline interferometry) radio observational campaign aimed at detecting\nand studying compact radio emission in four ULXs with known radio counterparts.\nWe find that one of the targets (N4559-X4) was previously misclassified: its\nlow X-ray luminosity indicates that the source is not a ULX. No\nmilliarcsec-scale radio emission is detected for N4559-X4 nor for the ULXs\nN4490-X1 and N5194-X2, for which upper limits on the radio luminosities are\nestimated. These limits argue strongly against the presence of supermassive BHs\nin these three systems. For N4559-X4, the low X-ray luminosity and the ratio of\nthe radio and X-ray luminosities suggest the presence of an X-ray binary.\nCompact radio emission is detected for the ULX N5457-X9 within its\n\\textit{Chandra} positional error, making N5457-X9 a potential\nintermediate-mass BH with steady jet emission. \n\n"}

A cosmic\nstring segment is expected to cause weak lensing as well as an integrated\nSachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, the so-called Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins (GKS) effect, to\nthe CMB temperature fluctuation, which are thus naturally cross-correlated. We\npoint out that, in the presence of such a correlation, yet another kind of the\npost-recombination CMB temperature bispectra, the ISW-lensing bispectra, will\narise in the form of products of the auto- and cross-power spectra. We first\npresent an analytic method to calculate the autocorrelation of the temperature\nfluctuations induced by the strings, and the cross-correlation between the\ntemperature fluctuation and the lensing potential both due to the string\nnetwork. In our formulation, the evolution of the string network is assumed to\nbe characterized by the simple analytic model, the velocity-dependent one scale\nmodel, and the intercommutation probability is properly incorporated in orderto\ncharacterize the possible superstringy nature. Furthermore, the obtained power\nspectra are dominated by the Poisson-distributed string segments, whose\ncorrelations are assumed to satisfy the simple relations.

A straightforward expectation of unified models is that\nhighly obscured Type 2 AGNs should show little or no optical variability on\ntimescales of days to years.

A\nUBVI and H alpha photometric study of the young open cluster IC 1848 was\nconducted as part of the \"Sejong Open cluster Survey\" (SOS).

Using the published photometric data with near-\nand mid-infrared archival data we confirmed the normal reddening law (R_V =\n3.1) toward the cluster (IC 1848). A careful zero-age main sequence fitting\ngives a distance modulus of V_0 - M_V = 11.7 +/- 0.2 mag, equivalent to 2.2 +/-\n0.2 kpc.

Prior studies suggest two\ncompeting scenarios for these nuclei: (1) SE is an active galactic nucleus\n(AGN) lost from NW due to a gravitational-wave recoil. (2) NW and SE each\ncontain an AGN, signaling a gravitational-slingshot recoil or inspiralling\nAGNs. We present new images from the Very Large Array (VLA) at a frequency nu =\n9.0 GHz and a FWHM resolution theta = 320 mas (1.6 kpc), and the Very Long\nBaseline Array (VLBA) at nu = 1.52 GHz and theta = 15 mas (75 pc). The VLA\nimaging is sensitive to emission driven by AGNs and/or star formation, while\nthe VLBA imaging is sensitive only to AGN-driven emission. No radio emission is\ndetected at these frequencies. Folding in prior results, we find: (a) The\nproperties of SE and its adjacent X-ray feature resemble those of the\nunobscured AGN in NGC 4151, albeit with a much higher narrow emission-line\nluminosity.

Abstract: Our current view of galaxies considers them as systems of stars and gas\nembedded in extended halos of dark matter, much of it formed by the infall of\nsmaller systems at earlier times. The true extent of a galaxy remains poorly\ndetermined, with the virial radius (R_vir) providing a characteristic\nseparation between collapsed structures in dynamical equilibrium and external\ninfalling matter. Other physical estimates of the extent of gravitational\ninfluence include the gravitational radius, gas accretion radius, and\n\"galactopause\" arising from outflows that stall at 100-200 kpc over a range of\noutflow parameters and confining gas pressures. Physical criteria are proposed\nto define bound structures, including a more realistic definition of R_vir (M*,\nM_h, z_a) for stellar mass M* and halo mass M_h, half of which formed at\n\"assembly redshifts\" z_a = 0.7-1.3. We estimate the extent of bound gas and\ndark matter around L* galaxies to be ~200 kpc. The new virial radii, with mean\nR_vir ~ 200 kpc, are 40-50% smaller than values estimated in recent HST/COS\ndetections of H I and O VI absorbers around galaxies. In the new formalism, the\nMilky Way stellar mass, log M* = 10.7 +/- 0.1, would correspond to R_vir = 153\n(+25,-16) kpc for half-mass halo assembly at z_a = 1.06 +/- 0.03.

With such\nsmall scatter this star-formation main sequence (SFMS) has been interpreted as\ndeterministic and fundamental. Here we demonstrate that it is a simple\nconsequence of the central limit theorem. Our derivation begins by\napproximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like a\nrandom walk (where the expectation of SFR at any time is equal to the SFR at\nthe previous time). We then derive expectation values for median SSFR of\nstar-forming disks and their scatter over time. We generalize the results for\nstochastic changes in SFR that are not independent of each other but are\ncorrelated over time. For unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive an\nexpectation that <SSFR> should be independent of mass, decline as 1/T, and have\na relative scatter that is independent of mass and time. The derived SFMS and\nits evolution matches published data to z=10 with sufficient accuracy to\nconstrain cosmological parameters. The framework reproduces several important\nobservables, including: the scatter in SSFR at fixed mass; the SFHs of nearby\ndwarf galaxies and the Milky Way; and the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation.\nThe evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss ways\nto generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such as\nmergers. The predicted dispersion in SSFR has consequences for the\nclassification of quiescent galaxies, as such galaxies have heterogeneous\nformation histories, and many may only be temporarily diminished in their\nstar-formation activity. The implied dispersion in SFHs, and the SFMS's\ninsensitivity to timescales of stochasticity, thus substantially limits the\nability to connect massive galaxies to their progenitors over long cosmic\nbaselines.

For KOI-13, HAT-P-7, and Kepler-76 we find\nthat the beaming-based planetary mass estimate is larger than the mass\nestimated from the ellipsoidal amplitude, consistent with previous studies.\nThis apparent discrepancy may be explained by equatorial superrotation of the\nplanet atmosphere, which induces an angle shift of the planet\nreflection/emission phase modulation, as was suggested for Kepler-76 in the\nfirst paper of this series. We propose a modified BEER model that supports\nsuperrotation, assuming either a Lambertian or geometric reflection/emission\nphase function, and provides a photometry-consistent estimate of the planetary\nmass. Our analysis shows that for Kepler-76 and HAT-P-7, the Lambertian\nsuperrotation BEER model is highly preferable over an unshifted null model,\nwhile for KOI-13 it is preferable only at a 1.4 sigma level. For TrES-2 we do\nnot find such preference. For all four systems the Lambertian superrotation\nmodel mass estimates are in excellent agreement with the planetary masses\nderived from, or constrained by, radial velocity measurements. This makes the\nLambertian superrotation BEER model a viable tool for estimating the masses of\nhot Jupiters from photometry alone. We conclude that hot Jupiter superrotation\nmay be a common phenomenon that can be detected in the visual light curves of\nKepler. \n\n"}

It was first observed by the EUV Variability Experiment\n(EVE) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The late phase emission\noriginates from a second set of longer loops (late phase loops) that are higher\nthan the main flaring loops. It is suggested as being caused by either\nadditional heating or long-lasting cooling. In this paper, we study the role of\nlong-lasting cooling and additional heating in producing the EUV late phase\nusing the \"enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops\" (EBTEL) model. We find\nthat a long cooling process in late phase loops can well explain the presence\nof the EUV late phase emission, but we cannot exclude the possibility of\nadditional heating in the decay phase. Moreover, we provide two preliminary\nmethods based on the UV and EUV emissions from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly\n(AIA) on board SDO to determine whether an additional heating plays some role\nor not in the late phase emission.

As a result, the\nstandard interpretations of many galaxy observables (which assume a slowly\nvarying SFH) are often incorrect. Here, we use the SFHs from hydro-dynamical\nsimulations to investigate the effects of bursty SFHs on sample selection and\ninterpretation of observables and make predictions to confirm such SFHs in\nfuture surveys. First, because dwarf galaxies' star formation rates change\nrapidly, the mass-to-light ratio is also changing rapidly in both the ionizing\ncontinuum and, to a lesser extent, the non-ionizing UV continuum. Therefore,\nflux limited surveys are highly biased toward selecting galaxies in the\n\\emph{burst} phase and very deep observations are required to detect all dwarf\ngalaxies at a given stellar mass.

Using\nthe WMAP/Planck data on the optical depth and epoch of reionization, we find\nthat only the SFR inferred from gamma-ray burst data at high redshift suffices\nto allow a single mode (in the initial mass function) of star formation which\nextends from z = 0 to redshifts > 10.

On the other hand, if they were ejected\nfrom astrophysical bodies, they were highly localized in space at the time of\ninjection. In this paper, using turbulence dynamo models for high magnetic\nPrandtl number fluids, we find constraints on the seed magnetic fields. The\nhydrodynamic Reynolds number based on the Spitzer viscosity in the intracluster\nmedium (ICM) is believed to be less than $O(10^2)$, while the magnetic Reynolds\nnumber can be much larger than that. In this case, if the seed magnetic fields\nhave primordial origins, they should be stronger than $O(10^{-11})$G, which is\nvery close to the upper limit of $O(10^{-9})$G set by the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) observations. On the other hand, if the seed magnetic fields\nwere ejected from astrophysical bodies, any seed magnetic fields stronger than\n$O(10^{-9})$G can safely magnetize the intracluster medium.

However, recently, it has been claimed that nonlinear Landau damping\nrenders it physically irrelevant by reducing the effective damping rate to a\nlow level.

We\nestimate that at young ages, the solar wind likely had a mass loss rate that is\nan order of magnitude higher than that of the current solar wind.

In this paper we use high-resolution\nhydrodynamical cosmological simulations to compare the halo and stellar mass\ngrowth of galaxies in a large-scale overdensity to those in a large-scale\nunderdensity (on scales of about 20 Mpc). The simulation reproduces assembly\nbias, that halos have earlier formation times in overdense environments than in\nunderdense regions. We find that the stellar mass to halo mass ratio is larger\nin overdense regions in central galaxies residing in halos with masses between\n10$^{11}$-10$^{12.9}$ M$_{\\odot}$. When we force the local density (within 2\nMpc) at z=0 to be the same for galaxies in the large-scale over- and\nunderdensities, we find the same results. We posit that this difference can be\nexplained by a combination of earlier formation times, more interactions at\nearly times with neighbors, and more filaments feeding galaxies in overdense\nregions.

Here we present the serendipitous\ndiscovery of one field blue straggler, HIP 10725, that closely matches the Sun\nin mass and age, but with a metallicity slightly lower than the Sun's.\n[Methods]. We employ high resolution (R $\\sim 10^5$) high S/N (330) VLT/UVES\nspectra to perform a differential abundance analysis of the solar analogue HIP\n10725. Radial velocities obtained by other instruments were also used to check\nfor binarity. We also study its chromospheric activity, age and rotational\nvelocity. [Results]. We find that HIP 10725 is severely depleted in beryllium\n([Be/H] <= -1.2 dex) for its stellar parameters and age. The abundances\nrelative to solar of the elements with Z <= 30 show a correlation with\ncondensation temperature and the neutron capture elements produced by the\ns-process are greatly enhanced, while the r-process elements seem normal. We\nfound its projected rotational velocity (v sin i = 3.3+/-0.1 km/s) to be\nsignificantly larger than solar, and incompatible with its isochrone-derived\nage. Radial velocity monitoring shows that the star has a binary companion.\n[Conclusions]. Based on the high s-process element enhancements and low\nberyllium abundance, we suggest that HIP 10725 has been polluted by\nmass-transfer from an AGB star, probably with initial mass of about 2 M_Sun.\nThe radial velocity variations suggest the presence of an unseen binary\ncompanion, probably the remnant of a former AGB star.

A stationary thermally unstable spherical\ndiffuse atomic cloud with uniform density in pressure equilibrium with low\ndensity surroundings was seeded with random density variations and allowed to\nevolve. A range of magnetic field strengths threading the cloud have been\nexplored, from beta=0.1 to beta=1.0 to the zero magnetic field case\n(beta=infinity), where beta is the ratio of thermal pressure to magnetic\npressure. Once the density inhomogeneities had developed to the point where\ngravity started to become important, self-gravity was introduced to the\nsimulation. With no magnetic field, clouds and clumps form within the cloud\nwith aspect ratios of around unity, whereas in the presence of a relatively\nstrong field (beta=0.1) these become filaments, then evolve into interconnected\ncorrugated sheets that are predominantly perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nWith magnetic and thermal pressure equality (beta=1.0), filaments, clouds and\nclumps are formed.

While NGC 6397 is often considered a core\ncollapse cluster, our analysis suggests a flattening of the surface brightness\nprofile at the smallest radii.

To investigate the nature of this feature, we calculate spherical Jeans\nmodels and compare these models to our kinematical data.

Based on comparisons to theoretical models, we\nargue that changes in emission-line ratios, including the offset in the BPT\ndiagram, are caused by a higher ionization parameter both at fixed stellar mass\nand at fixed metallicity with additional contributions from a higher gas\ndensity and possibly a hardening of the ionizing radiation field. Ionization\ndue to AGNs is ruled out as assessed with Chandra. As a consequence, we revisit\nthe mass-metallicity relation using [NII]/Ha and a new calibration including\n[NII]/[SII] as recently introduced by Dopita et al.

Previous estimates of the\nkinetic energy of the blast waves, based on the X-ray afterglow luminosity\n$L_X$, suggested that this efficiency is large, with values above 90\\% in some\ncases. This poses a problem to emission mechanisms and in particular to the\ninternal shocks model. These estimates are based, however, on the assumption\nthat the X-ray emitting electrons are fast cooling and that their Inverse\nCompton (IC) losses are negligible. The observed correlations between $L_X$\n(and hence the blast wave energy) and $E_{\\gamma\\rm ,iso}$, the isotropic\nequivalent energy in the prompt emission, has been considered as observational\nevidence supporting this analysis. It is reasonable that the prompt gamma-ray\nenergy and the blast wave kinetic energy are correlated and the observed\ncorrelation corroborates, therefore, the notion $L_X$ is indeed a valid proxy\nfor the latter. Recent findings suggest that the magnetic field in the\nafterglow shocks is significantly weaker than was earlier thought and its\nequipartition fraction, $\\epsilon_B$, could be as low as $10^{-4}$ or even\nlower.

At the same time, the question whether the inflationary\npotential can be be extended to the electroweak scale and whether it should be\nnecessarily chosen ad hoc in order to be physically acceptable are at the\ncenter of an intense debate.

First,\nNS-imploding dark matter forms $\\sim 10^{-10}$ solar mass or smaller black\nholes inside neutron stars, which proceed to convert neutron stars into\n$\\sim$1.5 solar mass BHs.

Third, the spatial distribution of neutron star merger kilonovae and\nquiet kilonovae in galaxies can be used to detect dark matter.

Abstract: We compare the optical properties of the host galaxies of radio-quiet (RQ)\nand radio-loud (RL) Type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to infer whether the\njet production efficiency depends on the host properties or is determined just\nby intrinsic properties of the accretion flows. We carefully select galaxies\nfrom SDSS, FIRST, and NVSS catalogs. We confirm previous findings that the\nfraction of RL AGNs depends on the black-hole (BH) masses, and on the Eddington\nratio. The comparison of the nature of the hosts of RL and RQ AGNs, therefore,\nrequires pair-matching techniques. Matching in BH mass and Eddington ratio\nallows us to study the differences between galaxies hosting RL and RQ AGNs that\nhave the same basic accretion parameters. We show that these two samples differ\npredominantly in the host-galaxy concentration index, morphological type (in\nthe RL sample the frequency of elliptical galaxies becoming larger with\nincreasing radio loudness), and nebular extinction (galaxies with highest radio\nloudness showing only low nebular extinction).

While true, it is shown in this paper that a LIGO interferometric\ndetector also undergoes frequent and {\\it discrete} quantum interactions with\nan incident gravitational wave, in such a way as to allow the exchange of\nenergy and momentum between the wave and the detector. This opens the door to\nanother way of finding gravitons. The most basic form of an interaction is the\nfirst order Fermi acceleration (deceleration) of a laser photon as it is\nreflected by a test mass mirror oscillating in the gravitational wave,\nresulting in a frequency blueshift (redshift) of the photon depending on\nwhether the mirror is advancing towards (receding from) the photon before the\nreflection. If e.g. a blueshift occurred, wave energy is absorbed and the\noscillation will be damped. It is suggested that such energy exchanging\ninteractions are responsible for the observed radiation reaction noise of LIGO\n(although the more common way of calculating the same amplitude for this noise\nis based on momentum considerations). Most importantly, in each interaction the\ndetector absorbs or emits wave energy in amounts far smaller than the standard\ngraviton energy $\\hbar\\omega$ where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the\ngravitational wave. This sets a very tight upper limit on the quantization of\nthe wave energy, viz. it must be at least $\\approx 10^{11}$ times below\n$\\hbar\\omega$, independently of the value of $\\omega$ itself. \n\n"}

In\nthe Standard Model before EWPT, the leptogenesis is well known to be driven by\nthe abelian anomaly in a massless hypercharge field. The generation of the\nneutrino asymmetry in the Higgs phase after EWPT, in its turn, has not been\nconsidered previously because of the absence of any quantum anomaly in an\nexternal electromagnetic field for such electroneutral particles as neutrino,\nunlike the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly for charged left and right polarized\nmassless electrons in the same electromagnetic field. Using the neutrino\nBoltzmann equation, modified by the Berry curvature term in the momentum space,\nwe establish the violation of the macroscopic neutrino current in plasma after\nEWPT and exactly reproduce the nonconservation of the lepton current in the\nsymmetric phase before EWPT arising in quantum field theory due to the nonzero\nlepton hypercharge and corresponding triangle anomaly in an external\nhypercharge field. In the last case, the non-conservation of the lepton current\nis derived through the kinetic approach without a computation of corresponding\nFeynman diagrams. Then the new kinetic equation is applied for the calculation\nof the neutrino asymmetry accounting for the Berry curvature and the\nelectroweak interaction with background fermions in the Higgs phase.

We apply deep learning architectures to\nlarge sets of simulated data. The inner structure of the neural network is\noptimized through the use of genetic algorithms. To obtain a prediction of the\nrecorded muon signal in each individual detector, we train neural networks with\na mixed sample of light, intermediate and heavy nuclei. When true and predicted\nsignals are compared at detector level, the primary values of the Pearson\ncorrelation coefficients are above 95\\%. The relative errors of the predicted\nmuon signals are below 10\\% and do not depend on the event energy, zenith\nangle, total signal size, distance range or the hadronic model used to generate\nthe events. \n\n"}

Crucially, the CMB power\nspectrum is sensitive to DM-baryon scattering if the fraction of interacting DM\nis larger than (or comparable to) the fractional uncertainty in the baryon\nenergy density. Meanwhile, there is a mass-dependent lower limit on the\nfraction for which the required interaction to cool the baryons sufficiently is\nso strong that it drives the interacting-DM temperature to the baryon\ntemperature prior to their decoupling from the CMB. If this occurs as early as\nrecombination, the cooling saturates. We precisely determine the viable\nparameter space for millicharged DM, and find that only a fraction (m_chi/MeV)\n0.0115% <~ f <~ 0.4% of the entire DM content, and only for DM-particle masses\nbetween 0.5 MeV - 35 MeV, can be charged at the level needed to marginally\nexplain the anomaly, without violating limits from SLAC, CMB, Big-Bang\nnucleosynthesis (BBN), or stellar and SN1987A cooling.

At the\nsame time, the material above the collapsing core is rapidly ejected, leading\nto a stripped-envelope supernova (SESN) explosion if the outer hydrogen\nenvelope of the star was removed before its explosion. The envelope is\npresumably stripped either via strong stellar winds or due to mass transfer to\na companion star in a close binary orbit. It is not clear which process is\ndominant, and whether different mechanisms are at work for different classes of\nSESNe; type IIb, Ib, and Ic SNe in order of increasing degree of envelope\nstripping.

Out of this sample 15 are identified as extreme oxygen emitters based on\ntheir O32 ratios (3.7%) and 104 galaxies have O32>1 (26%). Our analysis shows\nno significant correlation between M*, SFR, and the distance from the SFR-M*\nrelation with O32.

For massless\naxion field, in all these three formalism, we reproduce, at the leading order,\nthe exact scale-invariant power spectrum which is well known in the literature.\nWe observe that due to quantum entanglement, the sub-leading terms for these\nthee formalisms are different.

However, when\ncombining the asteroseismic data with ground-based $BVI$ photometry we\nestimated different distances for the stars, which we cross-checked with $Gaia$\nDR2. From $Gaia$ we obtained for one object a distance between and broadly\nconsistent with the distances from $BVI$ photometry. For the other object we\nhave a negative parallax with a not yet reliable $Gaia$ distance solution. The\nderived distances challenge a binary interpretation and may either point to a\ntriple system, which could explain the visible magnitudes, or, to a rare chance\nalignment ($\\sim 0.05\\%$ chance based on stellar magnitudes). This probability\nwould even be smaller, if calculated for close pairs of stars with a mass ratio\nclose to unity in addition to similar magnitudes, which may indeed indicate\nthat a binary scenario is more favourable. \n\n"}

The difference in angular\nvelocities between the accreting matter and the TBH induces a magnetic field\nthat is strongest in the region of the central aperture and innermost\nergoregion.

Applying these new effects to weakly magnetized ($B\\sim 10^7-10^9$G)\nneutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries, we study the global hydrodynamical\nwarping/precession modes of the disk under the combined influences of\nrelativistic frame dragging, classical precession due to the oblateness of the\nneutron star, and the magnetic torques. Under quite general conditions, the\nmagnetic warping torque can overcome the ``Bardeen-Petterson'' viscous damping\nand makes the modes grow. The modes are confined to the inner region of the\ndisk, and have frequencies close to the sum of the Lense-Thirring frequency,\nthe classical precession frequency, and the magnetically driven precession\nfrequency evaluated at the inner disk radius $r_{in}$.

Consequently, I hypothesize that the universe is static and in an\nequilibrium state (non-evolving).\n  New physics is proposed based on the concept that the universe is a pure wave\nsystem. Based on the new physics and assuming a static universe, processes are\nderived for the Hubble redshift and the cosmic background radiation field.\n  Then, following the scientific method, I test deductions of the static\nuniverse hypothesis using precise observational data primarily from the Hubble\nSpace Telescope.

In this\npaper we consider the possibility that the OT may be a GRB afterglow. Three\nsets of images and two sets of spectra were obtained as part of the normal\noperations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In the first two image sets,\nobserved two nights apart, the object appears as a point source at\n$r^{*}\\approx 17$. The third image set, observed about 410 days later, shows an\nextended source which is more than 2.5 magnitudes fainter. The spectra were\nobserved about 400 and 670 days after the first two image sets, and both show\nan apparently normal galaxy at a redshift of 0.385. Associating the OT with the\ngalaxy, the absolute magnitude was $M_{r^*}=-24.8$, which is over 4 magnitudes\nbrighter than the most luminous supernova ever measured. The spectral energy\ndistributions of the galaxy-subtracted OT derived from the first two image sets\nare well-fit by single power-laws with indices of $\\beta_{\\nu}=-0.92$ and -1.29\nrespectively, similar to most GRB afterglows. Based upon the luminosity of the\nOT, non-detections in contemporaneous ROTSE-I images, and the change in\nspectral slope, the OT, if an afterglow, was likely discovered early during a\n``plateau'' or slowly-fading phase. The discovery of a GRB afterglow at this\nstage of the SDSS is consistent with expectations, but only if the optical\nemission is much less strongly beamed than the gamma-rays.

In a collisionless n-body system, we know that particle motion is\ngoverned by the global potential rather than by inter-particle interactions. As\na result, the trajectory of each individual particle in the system is\nindependently shadowable. It is thus meaningful to measure the number of\nparticles that have shadowable trajectories as a function of time. We find that\nthe number of shadowable particles decays exponentially with time as exp(-mu\nt), and that for eps in [~0.2,1] (in units of the local mean inter-particle\nseparation $\\bar n$), there is an explicit relationship between the decay\nconstant mu, the timestep h of the leapfrog integrator, the softening eps, and\nthe number of particles N in the simulation.

There are\nalso two important physical characteristics that make this burst especially\ninteresting, aside from its remarkably low redshift. First, unlike most GRB\nafterglows, the light curve of GRB 030329 shows a very large variability a few\ndays after the burst. These fluctuations show a roughly constact amplitude, and\na constant duration $\\Delta t$, while $\\Delta t/t$ decreases with time $t$.\nSecond, its $\\gamma$-ray energy output and X-ray luminosity at $10 $hr are a\nfactor of $\\sim 20$ and $\\sim 30$, respectively, below the average value around\nwhich most GRBs are narrowly clustered.

In GRB 030329 this happens after the jet break, which implies an\napproximately constant duration $\\Delta t$ of the bumps, in agreement with the\nobservations. This interpretation also explains the anomalously low initial\nenergy of this burst, as the total energy of the afterglow shock is increased\nby a factor of $\\sim 10$ due to the refreshed shocks, thus bringing the total\nenergy output close to the average value for all GRBs. \n\n"}

The E+A spectrum is thus a signpost to galaxies in the process\nof evolution. We quantify the local environments, clustering properties and\nluminosity function of the E+A galaxies.

However, the luminosity distribution of galaxies selected using three\nBalmer absorption lines H-delta-gamma-beta appears more typical of ellipticals.\nIndeed, morphologically these galaxies are preferentially spheroidal (E/S0)\nsystems. In a small but significant number we find evidence for recent major\nmergers, such as tidal tails. We infer that major mergers are one important\nformation mechanism for E+A galaxies, as suggested by previous studies.

Abstract: Sgr A* is currently being fed by winds from a cluster of gravitationally\nbound young mass-loosing stars. Using observational constraints on the orbits,\nmass loss rates and wind velocities of these stars, we numerically model the\ndistribution of gas in the ~ 0.1--10'' region around Sgr A*. We find that\nradiative cooling of recently discovered slow winds leads to the formation of\nmany cool filaments and blobs, and to a thin and rather light accretion disc of\nabout an arcsecond scale. The disc however does not extend all the way to our\ninner boundary. Instead, hot X-ray emitting gas dominates the inner arcsecond.\nIn our simulations, cool streams of gas frequently enter this region on low\nangular momentum orbits, and are then disrupted and heated up to the ambient\nhot gas temperature. The accreting gas around Sgr A* is thus two-phase, with a\nhot component, observable at X-ray wavelengths, and a cool component, which may\nbe responsible for the majority of time variability of Sgr A* emission on\nhundred and thousand years time-scales.

The\nearly X-ray afterglows show a canonical behavior, where the light curve broadly\nconsists of three distinct power law segments: (i) an initial very steep decay\n(t^{-alpha} with 3<alpha_1<5), followed by (ii) a very shallow decay\n(0.2<alpha_2<0.8), and finally (iii) a somewhat steeper decay (1<alpha_3<1.5).\nThese power law segments are separated by two corresponding break times,\n300s<t_{break,1}<500s and 10^3s<t_{break,2}<10^4s. On top of this canonical\nbehavior of the early X-ray light curve, many events have superimposed X-ray\nflares, which are most likely caused by internal shocks due to long lasting\nsporadic activity of the central engine, up to several hours after the GRB. We\nfind that the initial steep decay is consistent with it being the tail of the\nprompt emission, from photons that are radiated at large angles relative to our\nline of sight. The first break in the light curve (t_{break,1}) takes place\nwhen the forward shock emission becomes dominant, with the intermediate shallow\nflux decay (alpha_2) likely caused by the continuous energy injection into the\nexternal shock.

A Large Spectroscopically Selected Sample\n  of Massive Early-Type Lens Galaxies Abstract: The Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey is an efficient Hubble Space Telescope\nSnapshot imaging survey for new galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses. The\ntargeted lens candidates are selected spectroscopically from within the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) database of galaxy spectra for having multiple\nnebular emission lines at a redshift significantly higher than that of the SDSS\ntarget galaxy. In this paper, we present a catalog of 19 newly discovered\ngravitational lenses, along with 9 other observed candidate systems that are\neither possible lenses, non-lenses, or non-detections. The survey efficiency is\nthus >=68%. We also present Gemini and Magellan IFU data for 9 of the SLACS\ntargets, which further support the lensing interpretation. A new method for the\neffective subtraction of foreground galaxy images to reveal faint background\nfeatures is presented.

The clumps accrete material from the remaining disc and merge into\nlarger clumps; the upper mass of a merged clump is a few tens to a few hundreds\nof solar mass. This picture fits well with the observed young stellar discs\nnear the SgrA* black hole in the Galactic Center. In particular, we show how\nthe masses and spatial distribution of the young stars, and the total mass in\nthe Galactic Center discs can be explained. However, explaining the origin of\nthe several young stars closest to the black hole (the S-stars) is more\nproblematic: their orbits are compact, eccentric, and have random orientation.\nWe propose that the S-stars were born in a previous starburst(s), and then\nmigrated through their parent disc via type I or runaway migration. Their\norbits were then randomized by the Rauch-Tremaine resonant relaxation. We then\nexplore the consequences of the star-formation scenario for AGN discs, which\nare continuously resupplied with gas.

KAIT data taken <~1 minute\nafter the start of GRB051111 and coinciding with the fading gamma-ray tail of\nthe prompt emission indicate a smooth re-injection of energy into the shock. No\ncolor change is apparent in observations beginning ~1.5 minutes after the GRB\nand lasting for the first hour after the burst.

Here we provide\narguments based on a quantitative analysis that supermassive objects at\ngalactic centers may be bubbles of dark matter axions rather than black holes.\nAn oscillating axion bubble can explain periodic variability of Sagittarius A*\nand yields the axion mass about 0.6 meV which fits in the open axion mass\nwindow. The bubble scenario with no other free parameters explains lack of\nsupermassive \"black holes\" with mass M<10^6 M_{Sun}. Low-mass bubbles decay\nfast and as a result are very rare. We also found that the mass of an axion\nbubble can not exceed 1.5\\times 10^9 M_{Sun}, in agreement with the upper limit\non the supermassive \"black hole\" mass obtained from observations. Our finding,\nif confirmed, suggests that Einstein general relativity is invalid for strong\ngravity and the gravitational field for the bubble effectively becomes\nrepulsive at large potential. Imaging a shadow of the \"black hole\" at the\nGalactic center with VLBI in the next decade can distinguish between the black\nhole and the oscillating axion bubble scenarios.

Three separate groups have reached the same conclusion that this event\nforces the existence of a new previously-unsuspected class of GRBs. The problem\nwith this conclusion is that the redshift is not secure, as the measured galaxy\nemission lines simply give the redshift of the brightest galaxy near the\nline-of-sight to the GRB afterglow. Fortunately, eight different luminosity\nindicators are known which can give the luminosity (and hence redshift) of the\nGRB itself. In combination, these luminosity indicators have already proven to\ngive redshifts with average one-sigma errors of 26% as based on 69 GRBs with\nspectroscopic redshifts. For GRB060614, the luminosity indicators all uniformly\ngive a high luminosity for the burst which implies a high redshift. This can be\nseen by the spiky many-peaked light curve, the high E_{peak} value, the\nnear-zero spectral lag, and the timing of the jet break. Quantitatively, we\nderive a redshift of 1.97 (1.44<z<2.81 one-sigma) from the eight luminosity\nindicators. Additional information from the detection of the afterglow in all\nSwift UVOT bands further constrains the redshift to be <1.71, so the final\nrange of allowed redshift is 1.44<z<1.71, which readily explains why no\nsupernova was visible. Thus, GRB060614 is at high redshift and is certainly not\nevidence for a new class of GRBs. \n\n"}

The balance\nbetween these effects and the decay of turbulent motions through isothermal\nshocks determines clouds' dynamical and energetic evolution. We find that for\nrealistic values of the rates of turbulent dissipation, photoevaporation, and\nenergy injection by HII regions, the massive clouds where most molecular gas in\nthe Galaxy resides live for a few crossing times, in good agreement with recent\nobservational estimates that large clouds in local group galaxies survive\nroughly 20-30 Myr.

The resulting sky\npower spectra peak at l=2000-8000 with maximum values of\nl^2C_l~1\\times10^{-12}.

This predicted kSZ signal at\narcminute scales is sufficiently strong to be detectable by upcoming\nexperiments, like the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and South Pole Telescope\nwhich are expected to have ~1' resolution and ~muK sensitivity. The extended\nand patchy nature of the reionization process results in a boost of the peak\nsignal in power by approximately one order of magnitude compared to a uniform\nreionization scenario, while roughly tripling the signal compared with that\nbased upon the assumption of gradual but spatially uniform reionization.

The absorber consists\nof two different ionization components. By tracking the response in the opacity\nof the gas in each component to changes in the ionizing continuum, we were able\nto constrain the electron density of the system. The measured densities require\nthat the high and low ionization absorbing components of NGC 4051 must be\ncompact, at distances 0.5-1.0 l-d (2200 - 4400Rs) and < 3.5 l-d (< 15800Rs)\nfrom the continuum source, respectively. This rules out an origin in the dusty\nobscuring torus, as the dust sublimation radius is at least an order of\nmagnitude larger (>12 l-d). An accretion disk origin for the warm absorber wind\nis strongly suggested, and an association with the high ionization, HeII\nemitting, broad emission line region (radius <2 l-d) is possible. The two\ndetected phases are consistent with pressure equilibrium, which suggests that\nthe absorber consists of a two phase medium.

The ratio of hard channel\n(1.3-10.0 keV) to soft channel (0.3-1.3 keV) counts in the Swift X-ray\ntelescope provides a new measure delineating the end time of this emission.

It is very likely that the mysterious light curve plateau phase\nand the later powerlaw temporal evolution, both of which typically occur at\ntimes greater than $T_{H}$ and hence exhibit very little hardness ratio\nevolution, are both produced by external shocking of the surrounding medium and\nnot by the internal shocks thought responsible for the earlier emission.

The optical afterglow\nis already fading as a power law 22 seconds after the trigger, with no\ndetectable prompt contribution in our first exposure, which was coincident with\na large prompt-emission gamma-ray pulse. The optical--infrared photometric\nspectral energy distribution is an excellent fit to a power law, but it\nexhibits a moderate red-to-blue evolution in the spectral index at about 500 s\nafter the burst. This color change is contemporaneous with a switch from a\nrelatively fast decay to slower decay. The rapidly decaying early afterglow is\nbroadly consistent with synchrotron emission from a reverse shock, but a bright\nforward-shock component predicted by the intermediate- to late-time X-ray\nobservations under the assumptions of standard afterglow models is not\nobserved. Indeed, despite its remarkable early-time brightness, this burst\nwould qualify as a dark burst at later times on the basis of its nearly flat\noptical-to-X-ray spectral index.

The intrinsic scatter in the restframe B-V\nCM relation of the elliptical galaxies is very small: ~0.022 magnitudes. The CM\nrelation of the ellipticals does not depend significantly on the distance from\nthe cluster center. In contrast, the CM relation for the S0 galaxies does\ndepend on radius: the S0s in the core follow a CM relation similar to the\nellipticals, but at large radii (R>0.7Mpc) the S0s are systematically bluer and\nthe scatter in the CM relation approximately doubles to ~0.043 magnitudes. The\nblueing of the S0s is significant at the 95% confidence level. These results\nimply that the S0 galaxies in the outer parts of the cluster have formed stars\nmore recently than the S0s in the inner parts. A likely explanation is that\nclusters at z=0.33 continue to accrete galaxies and groups from the field and\nthat infall extinguishes star formation.

This\nmodel may explain the X-ray and TeV gamma-ray (both low and high emission\nstates) of Mrk 421 as a result of synchrotron emission of secondary pairs from\nthe decay of charged pions and gamma-ray emission from the decay of neutral\npions for the plausible cloud parameters. However clouds can not be too hot and\ntoo dense. Otherwise the TeV gamma-rays can be attenuated by the bremsstrahlung\nradiation in the cloud and the secondary pairs are not able to efficiently\nproduce synchrotron flares because of the dominant role of inverse Compton\nscattering.\n  The non-variable $\\gamma$-ray emission observed from Mrk 421 in the EGRET\nenergy range cannot be described by the $\\gamma$-rays from decay of neutral\npions provided that the spectrum of protons in the beam is well described by a\nsimple power law. These $\\gamma$-rays might only be produced by secondary pairs\nscattering the soft non-variable X-rays which might originate in the inner part\nof the accretion disk. \n\n"}

Due to crossing the tangential discontinuity of the velocity the\nparticle can gain an amount of energy comparable to the energy gain at the\nshock crossing.

We conclude\nthat the relativistic proton beam - cloud collision scenario has problems with\nexplanation of the $\\gamma$-ray spectrum in the observed energy range from\nblazars. As a result of collisions of massive stars, supernova shock waves, or\nyoung pulsars with the jet plasma, a highly oblique shocks should be formed.\nThese shocks can accelerate electrons, protons to energies high enough for\nproduction of $\\gamma$-ray photons observed in blazars. However, in order to\nproduce observable $\\gamma$-ray fluxies, the particles should be accelerated\nstrongly anisotropicly, which may be the case of highly oblique relativistic\nshocks in jets of AGNs. \n\n"}

The production\nrate for such black holes has been extensively studied for the case of a\nproton-proton collision at \\sqrt s = 14 TeV and for a lead-lead collision at\n\\sqrt s = 5.5 TeV at LHC. As the parton energy density is much higher at\nlead-lead collisions than in pp collisions at LHC, one natural question is\nwhether the produced black holes will be able to absorb the partons formed in\nthe lead-lead collisions and eventually `eat' the quark-gluon plasma formed at\nLHC.
