Observations require that standard model\nparticles must be neutral (or have an extremely small charge) under additional\nmassless U(1)s, i.e. the latter have to belong to a so called hidden sector.\nThe exchange of heavy messengers, however, can lead to a kinetic mixing between\nthe hypercharge and the hidden-sector U(1)s, that is testable with near future\nexperiments. This provides a powerful probe of the hidden sectors and, as a\nconsequence, of the string theory realisation itself.

III:\n  Results for the 2002--2007 data-taking period Abstract: The Russian-American experiment SAGE began to measure the solar neutrino\ncapture rate with a target of gallium metal in Dec. 1989. Measurements have\ncontinued with only a few brief interruptions since that time. We give here the\nexperimental improvements in SAGE since its last published data summary in Dec.\n2001. Assuming the solar neutrino production rate was constant during the\nperiod of data collection, combined analysis of 168 extractions through Dec.\n2007 gives a capture rate of solar neutrinos with energy more than 233 keV of\n65.4 (+3.1)(-3.0) (stat) (+2.6)(-2.8) (syst) SNU. The weighted average of the\nresults of all three Ga solar neutrino experiments, SAGE, Gallex, and GNO, is\nnow 66.1 +/- 3.1 SNU, where statistical and systematic uncertainties have been\ncombined in quadrature. During the recent period of data collection a new test\nof SAGE was made with a reactor-produced 37Ar neutrino source. The ratio of\nobserved to calculated rates in this experiment, combined with the measured\nrates in the three prior 51Cr neutrino-source experiments with Ga, is 0.87 +/-\n0.05. A probable explanation for this low result is that the cross section for\nneutrino capture by the two lowest-lying excited states in 71Ge has been\noverestimated. If we assume these cross sections are zero, then the standard\nsolar model including neutrino oscillations predicts a total capture rate in Ga\nin the range of 63-66 SNU with an uncertainty of about 4%, in good agreement\nwith experiment. We derive the current value of the neutrino flux produced in\nthe Sun by the proton-proton fusion reaction to be (6.0 +/- 0.8) x\n10^(10)/(cm^2 s), which agrees well with the pp flux predicted by the standard\nsolar model. Finally, we show that the data are consistent with the assumption\nthat the solar neutrino production rate is constant in time. \n\n"}

{"id": "1004.5385", "contents": "Title: Twisted Inflation Abstract: We present a new mechanism for slow-roll inflation based on higher\ndimensional supersymmetric gauge theory compactified to four dimensions with\ntwisted (supersymmetry breaking) boundary conditions. These boundary conditions\nlead to a potential for directions in field space that would have been flat\nwere supersymmetry preserved. For field values in these directions much larger\nthan the supersymmetry-breaking scale, the flatness of the potential is nearly\nrestored. Starting in this nearly flat region, inflation can occur as the\ntheory relaxes towards the origin of field space. Near the origin, the\npotential becomes steep and the theory quickly descends to a confining gauge\ntheory in which the inflaton does not exist as a particle. This confining gauge\ntheory could be part of the Standard Model (QCD) or a natural dark matter\nsector; we comment on various scenarios for reheating. As a specific\nillustration of this mechanism, we discuss 4+1 dimensional maximally\nsupersymmetric gauge theory on a circle with antiperiodic boundary conditions\nfor fermions. When the theory is weakly coupled at the compactification scale,\nwe calculate the inflaton potential directly in field theory by integrating out\nthe heavy W-bosons and their superpartners.

Such a high T_R\nvalue typically leads to an overproduction of gravitinos in the early universe,\nwhich will cause conflicts, mainly with BBN constraints.

We calculate the relic\nabundance of mixed axion/axino dark matter in the AY scenario, and investigate\nunder what conditions a value of T_R sufficient for thermal leptogenesis can be\ngenerated. A high value of PQ breaking scale f_a is needed to suppress\noverproduction of axinos, while a small vacuum misalignment angle \\theta_i is\nneeded to suppress overproduction of axions.

When they thermalize, the axions form a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate.

In this construction the RH neutrino\ncan be produced directly from Higgs decays or in association with a RH\nsneutrino when the latter is the lightest supersymmetric particle. The RH\nneutrino is generally long-lived, since its decay width is proportional to the\nneutrino Yukawa, a parameter which is predicted to be small. The RH neutrino\nlate decay can therefore give rise to displaced vertices at the LHC, which can\nbe identified through the decay products, which involve two leptons (2l+ MET)\nor a lepton with two jets (ljj).

The general behavior\nof the energy of the bound and resonance state near the two-body threshold for\na local potential is derived from the expansion of the Jost function around the\nthreshold. It is shown that the same scaling holds for the nonlocal potential\ninduced by the coupling to a bare state. In p or higher partial waves, the\nscaling law of the stable bound state continues across the threshold describing\nthe real part of the resonance energy. In contrast, the leading contribution of\nthe scaling is forbidden by the nonperturbative dynamics near the s-wave\nthreshold. As a consequence, the bound state energy is not continuously\nconnected to the real part of the resonance energy.

In any concrete implementation of PGM,\nthe SUSY-breaking field is therefore required to carry nonzero charge under\nsome global or local symmetry. As we point out in this note, a prime candidate\nfor such a symmetry might be B-L, the Abelian gauge symmetry associated with\nthe difference between baryon number B and lepton number L. The F-term of the\nSUSY-breaking field then not only breaks SUSY, but also B-L, which relates the\nrespective spontaneous breaking of SUSY and B-L at a fundamental level. As a\nparticularly interesting consequence, we find that the heavy Majorana neutrino\nmass scale ends up being tied to the gravitino mass, Lambda_N ~ m_3/2. Assuming\nnonthermal leptogenesis to be responsible for the generation of the baryon\nasymmetry of the universe, this connection may then explain why SUSY\nnecessarily needs to be broken at a rather high energy scale, so that m_3/2 >~\n1000 TeV in accord with the concept of PGM.

The focus is on the study of the relaxation of gauge and\nfermionic mean fields and on the quantum kinetics of the photon and fermion\ndistribution functions. For semihard photons of momentum eT << k << T we find\nto leading order in the HTL that the gauge mean field relaxes in time with a\npower law as a result of infrared enhancement of the spectral density near the\nLandau damping threshold. The dynamical renormalization group reveals the\nemergence of detailed balance for microscopic time scales larger than 1/k while\nthe rates are still varying with time. The quantum kinetic equation for the\nphoton distribution function allows us to study photon production from a\nthermalized quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by off-shell effects.

While there is not yet a microscopically founded superconducting\nquark matter phase which would fulfill constraints from cooling phenomenology,\nwe explore the hypothetical 2SC+X phase and show that the magnitude and\ndensity-dependence of the X-gap can be chosen to satisfy a set of tests:\ntemperature - age (T - t), the brightness constraint, Log N - Log S, and the\nmass spectrum constraint. The latter test appears as a new conjecture from the\npresent investigation. \n\n"}

In the calculation, we consider matters with and\nwithout neutrino trapping as the target. We have found that the difference\nbetween the two mean free paths depends not only on the neutrino energy, but\nalso on the matter density as well as matter constituents. Compared to the\nnucleon weak magnetism, the neutrino electromagnetic properties are found to\nhave negligible effects on this difference. \n\n"}
