The 'true' (or myopic) self-avoiding walk model (TSAW) was\nintroduced in the physics literature by Amit, Parisi and Peliti. This is a\nnearest neighbor non-Markovian random walk in Z^d which prefers to jump to\nthose neighbors which were less visited in the past. The self-repelling\nBrownian polymer model (SRBP), initiated in the probabilistic literature by\nDurrett and Rogers (independently of the physics community), is the continuous\nspace-time counterpart: a diffusion in R^d pushed by the negative gradient of\nthe (mollified) occupation time measure of the process. In both cases, similar\nlong memory effects are caused by a pathwise self-repellency of the\ntrajectories due to a push by the negative gradient of (softened) local time.\nWe investigate the asymptotic behaviour of TSAW and SRBP in the non-recurrent\ndimensions. First, we identify a natural stationary (in time) and ergodic\ndistribution of the environment (the local time profile) as seen from the\nmoving particle. The main results are diffusive limits. In the case of TSAW,\nfor a wide class of self-interaction functions, we establish diffusive lower\nand upper bounds for the displacement and for a particular, more restricted\nclass of interactions, we prove full CLT for the finite dimensional\ndistributions of the displacement. In the case of SRBP, we prove full CLT\nwithout restrictions on the interaction functions. These results settle part of\nthe conjectures, based on non-rigorous renormalization group arguments (equally\n'valid' for the TSAW and SRBP cases). The proof of the CLT follows the\nnon-reversible version of Kipnis-Varadhan theory. On the way to the proof, we\nslightly weaken the so-called graded sector condition. \n\n"}

Appropriately scaled families of DiPerna-Lions-(Mischler) renormalized\nsolutions with Maxwell reflection boundary conditions are shown to have\nfluctuations that converge as the Knudsen number goes to zero. Every limit\npoint is a weak solution to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with different\ntypes of boundary conditions depending on the ratio between the accommodation\ncoefficient and the Knudsen number. The main new result of the paper is that\nthis convergence is strong in the case of Dirichlet boundary condition. Indeed,\nwe prove that the acoustic waves are damped immediately, namely they are damped\nin a boundary layer in time. This damping is due to the presence of viscous and\nkinetic boundary layers in space. As a consequence, we also justify the first\ncorrection to the infinitesimal Maxwellian that one obtains from the\nChapman-Enskog expansion with Navier-Stokes scaling.\n  This extends the work of Golse and Saint-Raymond \\cite{Go-Sai04, Go-Sai05}\nand Levermore and Masmoudi \\cite{LM} to the case of a bounded domain.

Lax studied $2 \\times 2$ genuinely\nnonlinear strictly hyperbolic PDE systems (in one spatial dimension). Using the\nmethod of Riemann invariants, he showed that a large set of smooth initial data\nlead to bounded solutions whose first spatial derivatives blow up in finite\ntime, a phenomenon known as wave breaking. In the present article, we study the\nCauchy problem for two classes of quasilinear wave equations in two spatial\ndimensions that are closely related to the systems studied by Lax. When the\ndata have one-dimensional symmetry, Lax's methods can be applied to the wave\nequations to show that a large set of smooth initial data lead to wave\nbreaking. Here we study solutions with initial data that are close, as measured\nby an appropriate Sobolev norm, to data belonging to a distinguished subset of\nLax's data: the data corresponding to simple plane waves. Our main result is\nthat under suitable relative smallness assumptions, the Lax-type wave breaking\nfor simple plane waves is stable. The key point is that we allow the data\nperturbations to break the symmetry. Moreover, we give a detailed, constructive\ndescription of the asymptotic behavior of the solution all the way up to the\nfirst singularity, which is a shock driven by the intersection of null\n(characteristic) hyperplanes.

There are many different\ntechnologies that generate the reads: widely-used second-generation methods\ncreate short reads with low error rates, while emerging third-generation\nmethods create long reads with high error rates. Both error rates and error\nprofiles differ among methods, so reconstruction algorithms are often tailored\nto specific shotgun sequencing technologies. As these methods change over time,\na fundamental question is whether there exist reconstruction algorithms which\nare robust, i.e., which perform well under a wide range of error distributions.\n  Here we study this question of sequence assembly from corrupted reads.

The latter is a nonlinear\ncondition signifying the complete absence of nonlinear interactions involving\nmore than one differentiation in a direction transversal to the acoustic\ncharacteristics. Moreover, the same good structures are found in the equations\nverified by the Euclidean divergence and curl of the specific vorticity. This\nis important because one needs to combine estimates for the divergence and curl\nwith elliptic estimates to obtain sufficient regularity for the specific\nvorticity, whose derivatives appears as inhomogeneous terms in the wave\nequations.\n  The above structures collectively open the door for our forthcoming results:\nexhibiting a stable regime in which initially smooth solutions develop a shock\nsingularity (in particular the first Cartesian coordinate partial derivatives\nof the velocity and density blow up) while, relative to a system of geometric\ncoordinates adapted to the acoustic characteristics, the solution (including\nthe vorticity) remains many times differentiable, all the way up to the shock.\nThe good null structures, which are often associated with global solutions, are\nin fact key to proving that the shock singularity forms. Our secondary goal in\nthis article is to overview the central role that the structures play in the\nproof. \n\n"}

In both models,\nsites are assigned uniformly random colors from $\\mathbb{Z}/\\kappa\\mathbb{Z}$.\nNeighboring sites with colors within a specified interaction range $r$ tend to\nsynchronize their colors upon a particular local event of 'excitation'.

First, if $r$ is too small (undercoupled), there are too\nmany non-interacting pairs of colors, and the whole graph $\\mathbb{Z}$ will be\npartitioned into non-interacting intervals of sites with no excitation within\neach interval. If $r$ is within a sweet spot (critical), then we show the\nsystem clusters into ever-growing monochromatic intervals.

The bulk diffusion\ncoefficient of the limiting equation is given by Green-Kubo formula and it can\nbe characterized by a variational formula.

Specifically, JIQ strategies involve minimal information exchange,\nand yet achieve zero blocking and wait in the many-server limit. The latter\nproperty prevails in a multiple-dispatcher scenario when the loads are strictly\nequal among dispatchers. For various reasons it is not uncommon however for\nskewed load patterns to occur. We leverage product-form representations and\nfluid limits to establish that the blocking and wait then no longer vanish,\neven for arbitrarily low overall load. Remarkably, it is the least-loaded\ndispatcher that throttles tokens and leaves idle servers stranded, thus acting\nas bottleneck.\n  Motivated by the above issues, we introduce two enhancements of the ordinary\nJIQ scheme where tokens are either distributed non-uniformly or occasionally\nexchanged among the various dispatchers.

The stationary NLS equation\nmay admit a family of solitary waves parameterized by a translational\nparameter, which we call the shifted states. The two main examples include (i)\nthe star graph with even $N$ under the classical Kirchhoff boundary conditions\nand (ii) the star graph with one incoming edge and $N-1$ outgoing edges under a\nsingle constraint on coefficients of the generalized Kirchhoff boundary\nconditions. We obtain the general counting results on the Morse index of the\nshifted states and apply them to the two examples.

The boundary value\nproblem consists of a second order parabolic equation defined on a time-varying\nLipschitz domain in a Euclidean space and of a mixed boundary condition\ncomposed of a Robin and the homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. It is assumed\nthat the time-varying domain is included in a fixed smooth domain and that a\ncertain part of the boundary of the time-varying domain is also included in the\nboundary of the fixed domain, say the fixed boundary. The Robin condition is\nimposed on a part of the boundary included in the fixed one and the Dirichlet\ncondition on the rest of the boundary. Such a parabolic boundary value problem\nalways has a unique weak solution for given data; however it does not possess a\nclassical or strong solution in general, even in the case of equations with\nconstant coefficients.

Interesting phenomena\nappear when the additional coordinate of the space-time process is on a\ndiscrete torus with non-symmetric jump rates. The projection of these\nspace-time random walk loop measures onto the space dimensions is loop measures\non the spatial graph, and in the scaling limit of the discrete torus, these\nloop measures converge to the so-called [Bosonic loop measures]. This provides\na natural probabilistic definition of [Bosonic loop measures]. These novel loop\nmeasures have similarities with the standard Markovian loop measures only that\nthey give weights to loops of certain lengths, namely any length which is\nmultiple of a given length $ \\beta> 0 $ which serves as an additional\nparameter. We complement our study with generalised versions of Dynkin's\nisomorphism theorem (including a version for the whole complex field) as well\nas Symanzik's moment formulae for complex Gaussian measures.

The goal of this work is to gain insights into the stock price\nand wealth distribution. We especially want to discover the causes for the\nappearance of power-laws in financial data. We follow a kinetic approach\nsimilar to (D. Maldarella, L. Pareschi, Physica A, 391) and derive the mean\nfield limit of our microscopic agent dynamics. The novelty in our approach is\nthat the financial agents apply model predictive control (MPC) to approximate\nand solve the optimization of their utility function. Interestingly, the MPC\napproach gives a mathematical connection between the two opponent economic\nconcepts of modeling financial agents to be rational or boundedly rational.\nFurthermore, this is to our knowledge the first kinetic portfolio model which\nconsiders a wealth and stock price distribution simultaneously. Due to our\nkinetic approach, we can study the wealth and price distribution on a\nmesoscopic level.

This phenomenon\nis referred to as enhanced dissipation, namely the identification of a\ntime-scale faster than the purely diffusive one. We establish a precise\nconnection between quantitative mixing rates in terms of decay of negative\nSobolev norms and enhanced dissipation time-scales. The proofs are based on a\ncontradiction argument that takes advantage of the cascading mechanism due to\nmixing, an estimate of the distance between the inviscid and viscous dynamics,\nand of an optimization step in the frequency cut-off.\n  Thanks to the generality and robustness of our approach, we are able to apply\nour abstract results to a number of problems.

Replacing the forward model with a\nlow-cost, low-fidelity model often significantly reduces computational cost;\nhowever, employing a low-fidelity model alone means that the stationary\ndistribution of the MCMC chain is the posterior distribution corresponding to\nthe low-fidelity model, rather than the original posterior distribution\ncorresponding to the high-fidelity model. We propose a multifidelity approach\nthat combines, rather than replaces, the high-fidelity model with a\nlow-fidelity model. First, the low-fidelity model is used to construct a\ntransport map that deterministically couples a reference Gaussian distribution\nwith an approximation of the low-fidelity posterior.

The\nproblem involves two small parameters beta and rho where: (i) (1/beta) is a\nfactor describing spatial extension of the wavepackets; (ii) (1/rho) is a\nfactor describing the relative magnitude of the linear part of the evolution\nequation compared to its nonlinearity. For a wide range of the small parameters\nand on time intervals long enough for strong nonlinear effects we prove that\nmulti-wavepackets are preserved under the nonlinear evolution. In particular,\nthe corresponding wave vectors and the band numbers of involved wavepackets are\n\"conserved quantities\". We also prove that the evolution of a multi-wavepacket\nis described with high accuracy by a properly constructed system of envelope\nequations with a universal nonlinearity which in simpler cases turn into\nwell-known Nonlinear Schrodinger or coupled modes equations. The universal\nnonlinearity is obtained by a certain time averaging applied to the original\nnonlinearity. This can be viewed as an extension of the well known averaging\nmethod developed for finite-dimensional nonlinear oscillatory systems to the\ncase of a general translation invariant PDE systems with the linear part having\ncontinuous spectrum. \n\n"}

We study a wave propagation governed by a nonlinear system of\nhyperbolic PDE's with constant coefficients with the initial data being a\nmulti-wavepacket. By definition a general wavepacket has a well defined\nprincipal wave vector, and, as we proved in previous works, the nonlinear\ndynamics preserves systems of wavepackets and their principal wave vectors.\nHere we study the nonlinear evolution of a special class of wavepackets, namely\nparticle-like wavepackets. A particle-like wavepacket is of a dual nature: on\none hand, it is a wave with a well defined principal wave vector, on the other\nhand, it a particle in the sense that it can be assigned a well defined\nposition in the space. We prove that under the nonlinear evolution a generic\nmulti-particle wavepacket remains to be a multi-particle wavepacket with a high\naccuracy, and every constituting single particle-like wavepacket not only\npreserves its principal wave number but also it has a well-defined space\nposition evolving with a constant velocity which is its group velocity.\nRemarkably the described properties hold though the involved single\nparticle-like wavepackets undergo nonlinear interactions and multiple\ncollisions in the space. We also prove that if principal wavevectors of\nmulti-particle wavepacket are generic, the result of nonlinear interactions\nbetween different wavepackets is small and the approximate linear superposition\nprinciple holds uniformly with respect to the initial spatial positions of\nwavepackets. \n\n"}

The Karlin-McGregor formula enables one to express the transition\nprobability in terms of a matrix model, consisting of Gaussian Hermitian random\nmatrices in a chain with external source. It is shown that the log of the\nprobability for this model satisfies a fourth order PDE with a quartic\nnon-linearity, obtained by means of the 3-component KP hierarchy and Virasoro\nconstraints.\n  When the number of particles grows very large, the particles will be\nconcentrated on two intervals near t=0 and on one interval near t=1. The\nPearcey process is the infinite-dimensional diffusion, near the critical\ntransition from two to one interval. An appropriate scaling limit of the PDE\nfor the finite model leads to a non-linear PDE for the multi-time transition\nprobabilities of the Pearcey process.\n  We conjecture that each of the Markov clouds (like the Pearcey process)\narising near phase transitions is related to some integrable system.
