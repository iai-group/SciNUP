Thanks to new communication\nsystems and novel technologies, it is today possible to produce and analyze\nsocial and biological networks with detailed information on the time of\noccurrence and duration of each link. However, standard graph metrics\nintroduced so far in complex network theory are mainly suited for static\ngraphs, i.e., graphs in which the links do not change over time, or graphs\nbuilt from time-varying systems by aggregating all the links as if they were\nconcurrent in time. In this paper, we extend the notion of connectedness, and\nthe definitions of node and graph components, to the case of time-varying\ngraphs, which are represented as time-ordered sequences of graphs defined over\na fixed set of nodes. We show that the problem of finding strongly connected\ncomponents in a time-varying graph can be mapped into the problem of\ndiscovering the maximal-cliques in an opportunely constructed static graph,\nwhich we name the affine graph. It is therefore an NP-complete problem. As a\npractical example, we have performed a temporal component analysis of\ntime-varying graphs constructed from three data sets of human interactions.

The generation of a spin current is discussed by\ncalculating the thermal spin transfer torque, which breaks the spin\nconservation law for conduction electrons and operates the coherent magnon\nstate. Inhomogeneous thermal fluctuations between conduction electrons and\nmagnons induce a net spin current, which is pumped into the adjacent\nnon-magnetic metal. The pumped spin current is proportional to the temperature\ndifference. When the effective temperature of magnons is lower than that of\nconduction electrons, localized spins lose spin angular momentum by emitting\nmagnons and conduction electrons flip from down to up by absorbing all the\nemitted momentum, and vice versa. Magnons at the zero mode cannot contribute to\nthermal spin pumping because they are eliminated by the spin-flip condition.\nConsequently thermal spin pumping does not cost any kinds of applied magnetic\nfields.

In order to confirm the Kerr-nature of these\nobjects, we need to probe the geometry of the space-time around them and see if\nthe observations are consistent with the predictions of the Kerr metric. That\ncan be achieved, for instance, by studying the properties of the\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by the gas in the accretion disk. The\nhigh-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in the X-ray flux of some\nstellar-mass black hole candidates might do the job. As the frequencies of\nthese oscillations depend only very weakly on the observed X-ray flux, it is\nthought they are mainly determined by the metric of the space-time. In this\npaper, I consider the resonance models proposed by Abramowicz and Kluzniak and\nI extend previous results to the case of non-Kerr space-times. The emerging\npicture is more complicated than the one around a Kerr black hole and there is\na larger number of possible combinations between different modes. I then\ncompare the bounds inferred from the twin peak high-frequency quasi-periodic\noscillations observed in three micro-quasars (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, and\nGRS 1915+105) with the measurements from the continuum-fitting method of the\nsame objects.

Despite the importance of this quantity in classifying liquids,\nexplaining what aspects of the microscopic structure controls fragility remains\na challenge. Surprisingly, experiments indicate that the linear elasticity of\nthe glass -- a purely local property of the free energy landscape -- is a good\npredictor of fragility. In particular, materials presenting a large excess of\nsoft elastic modes, the so-called boson peak, are strong. This is also the case\nfor network liquids near the rigidity percolation, known to affect elasticity.\nHere we introduce a model of the glass transition based on the assumption that\nparticles can organize locally into distinct configurations, which are coupled\nspatially via elasticity.

Lett. 109, 017202\n(2012)] revealed a slow, logarithmic in time, growth of entanglement entropy\nfor initial product states in a putative many-body localized phase. We show\nthat this surprising phenomenon results from the dephasing due to exponentially\nsmall interaction-induced corrections to the eigenenergies of different states.\nFor weak interactions, we find that the entanglement entropy grows as \\xi ln\n(Vt/\\hbar), where V is the interaction strength, and \\xi is the single-particle\nlocalization length. The saturated value of the entanglement entropy at long\ntimes is determined by the participation ratios of the initial state over the\neigenstates of the subsystem. The proposed mechanism is illustrated with\nnumerical simulations of small systems. Our work shows that the logarithmic\nentanglement growth is a universal phenomenon characteristic of the many-body\nlocalized phase in any number of spatial dimensions, and reveals a broad\nhierarchy of dephasing time scales present in such a phase. \n\n"}

Recently, much attention has been given to\nthe link between strict jamming and hyperuniformity in frictionless\nhard-particle packings. Doing so requires one to study very large packings,\nwhich can be difficult to jam properly. We modify the rigorous linear\nprogramming method of Donev et al. [J. Comp. Phys. 197, 139 (2004)] in order to\ntest for jamming in putatively jammed packings of hard-disks in two dimensions.\nWe find that various standard packing protocols struggle to reliably create\npackings that are jammed for even modest system sizes; importantly, these\npackings appear to be jammed by conventional tests. We present evidence that\nsuggests that deviations from hyperuniformity in putative maximally random\njammed (MRJ) packings can in part be explained by a shortcoming in generating\nexactly-jammed configurations due to a type of \"critical slowing down\" as the\nnecessary rearrangements become difficult to realize by numerical protocols.\nAdditionally, various protocols are able to produce packings exhibiting\nhyperuniformity to different extents, but this is because certain protocols are\nbetter able to approach exactly-jammed configurations. Nonetheless, while one\nshould not generally expect exact hyperuniformity for disordered packings with\nrattlers, we find that when jamming is ensured, our packings are very nearly\nhyperuniform, and deviations from hyperuniformity correlate with an inability\nto ensure jamming, suggesting that strict jamming and hyperuniformity are\nindeed linked. This raises the possibility that the ideal MRJ packings have no\nrattlers.

Nonetheless,\nthe surface chiral velocity is robust and survives in the presence of strong\ndisorder, persisting all the way to the Anderson-localized phase by forming\nlocalized current loops that live within the localization length of the\nsurface.

The procedure involves two steps: (1)\ndetermining time-bin size for transforming the point-process data into\ndiscrete-time binary data and (2) screening relevant couplings from the\nestimated couplings. For the first step, we decide the optimal time-bin size by\nintroducing the null hypothesis that all neurons would fire independently, then\nchoosing a time-bin size so that the null hypothesis is rejected with the most\nstrict criterion. The likelihood associated with the null hypothesis is\nanalytically evaluated and used for the rejection process.

On the\nother hand, in generic systems such expectation values relax to stationary\nvalues described by the thermal ensemble, fixed solely by the energy of the\nstate.

At imaginary time, the kinetic energy propagator is usually the\ndiffusion Greens function. Since diffusion cannot be simulated backward in\ntime, the splitting must maintain the positivity of all intermediate time\nsteps.

These\nmatrices have $N$ pairs of opposite real nonvanishing eigenvalues, as well as\n$M-N$ zero eigenvalues (for $M>N$.) These zero eigenvalues are ``kinematical\"\nin the sense that they are independent of randomness. We study the eigenvalue\ndistribution of these matrices to leading order in the large $N,M$ limit, in\nwhich the ``rectangularity\" $r={M\\over N}$ is held fixed. We apply a variety of\nmethods in our study. We study Gaussian ensembles by a simple diagrammatic\nmethod, by the Dyson gas approach, and by a generalization of the Kazakov\nmethod. These methods make use of the invariance of such ensembles under the\naction of symmetry groups. The more complicated Wigner ensemble, which does not\nenjoy such symmetry properties, is studied by large $N$ renormalization\ntechniques. In addition to the kinematical $\\delta$-function spike in the\neigenvalue density which corresponds to zero eigenvalues, we find for both\ntypes of ensembles that if $|r-1|$ is held fixed as $N\\rightarrow\\infty$, the\n$N$ non-zero eigenvalues give rise to two separated lobes that are located\nsymmetrically with respect to the origin.

This\nfact allows us to relate the two descriptions of the Einstein-Rosen waves\nanalyzed here by means of a simple field redefinition. Employing this\nredefinition, we find the highly non-linear relation that exists between the\nannihilation and creation-like variables of the two approaches. We next\nrepresent the particle-like variables of the perturbative approach as\nregularized operators, introducing a cut-off. These can be expanded in powers\nof the annihilation and creation operators of the Ashtekar and Pierri\nquantization, each additional power being multiplied by an extra square-root of\nthe three-dimensional gravitational constant, $\\sqrt{G}$. In principle, the\nperturbative vacuum may be reached as the limit of a state annihilated by these\nregularized operators when the cut-off is removed. This state can be written as\nthe vacuum of the Ashtekar and Pierri quantization corrected by a perturbative\nseries in $\\sqrt{G}$ with no contributions from particles with energies above\nthe cut-off. We show that the first-order correction is in fact a state of\ninfinite norm. This result is interpreted as indicating that the Fock\nquantizations in the two approaches are unitarily inequivalent and, in any\ncase, proves that the perturbative vacuum is not analytic in the interaction\nconstant.

We compare in particular the convergence mechanism for interacting agents\nembedded in a low-dimensional lattice with respect to the mean-field case. We\nhighlight that in low-dimensions consensus is reached through a coarsening\nprocess which requires less cognitive effort of the agents, with respect to the\nmean-field case, but takes longer to complete. In 1-d the dynamics of the\nboundaries is mapped onto a truncated Markov process from which we analytically\ncomputed the diffusion coefficient. More generally we show that the convergence\nprocess requires a memory per agent scaling as N and lasts a time N^{1+2/d} in\ndimension d<5 (d=4 being the upper critical dimension), while in mean-field\nboth memory and time scale as N^{3/2}, for a population of N agents. We present\nanalytical and numerical evidences supporting this picture. \n\n"}

To address this, we define coarse-graining\nunits (CGU) as connectivity patterns which can serve as the nodes of a\ncoarse-grained network, and present algorithms to detect them. We use this\napproach to systematically reverse-engineer electronic circuits, forming\nunderstandable high-level maps from incomprehensible transistor wiring: first,\na coarse-grained version in which each node is a gate made of several\ntransistors is established. Then, the coarse-grained network is itself\ncoarse-grained, resulting in a high-level blueprint in which each node is a\ncircuit-module made of multiple gates. We apply our approach also to a\nmammalian protein-signaling network, to find a simplified coarse-grained\nnetwork with three main signaling channels that correspond to cross-interacting\nMAP-kinase cascades. We find that both biological and electronic networks are\n'self-dissimilar', with different network motifs found at each level.

Two\nelements are involved: first, the fixed plastic slab on which is stuck the\ninitial strand, second, the magnetic bead which pulls (or twists) the attached\nmolecule free end. We have shown that the bead surface can be replaced by its\ntangent plane at the anchoring point, when it is close to the bead south pole\nrelative to the force. We are led to a model with two parallel repulsive\nplates: the fixed anchoring plate and a fluctuating plate, simulating the bead,\nin thermal equilibrium with the system. The bead effect is a slight upper shift\nof the elongation, about four times smaller than the similar effect induced by\nthe fixed plate. This rather unexpected result, has been qualitatively\nconfirmed within the soluble Gaussian model. A study of the molecule elongation\nversus the countour length exhibits a significant non-extensive behaviour. The\ncurve for short molecules (with less than 2 kbp) is well fitted by a straight\nline, with a slope given by the WLC model, but it does not go through the\norigin. The non-extensive offset gives a 15% upward shift to the elongation of\na 2 kbp molecule stretched by a 0.3 pN force. \n\n"}

However this space part is crucial\nfor considerations of property of locality of quantum system. Actually the\nspace part leads to an extra factor in quantum correlations and as a result the\nordinary proof of Bell's theorem fails in this case.

These correlations are not due to\nthermal fluctuations but to the intricate structure of a strongly entangled\nground state of the system. We present a microscopic computation of the scaling\nproperties of the ground-state entanglement in several 1D spin chain models\nboth near and at the quantum critical regimes. We quantify entanglement by\nusing the entropy of the ground state when the system is traced down to $L$\nspins. This entropy is seen to scale logarithmically with $L$, with a\ncoefficient that corresponds to the central charge associated to the conformal\ntheory that describes the universal properties of the quantum phase transition.\nThus we show that entanglement, a key concept of quantum information science,\nobeys universal scaling laws as dictated by the representations of the\nconformal group and its classification motivated by string theory. This\nconnection unveils a monotonicity law for ground-state entanglement along the\nrenormalization group flow. We also identify a majorization rule possibly\nassociated to conformal invariance and apply the present results to interpret\nthe breakdown of density matrix renormalization group techniques near a\ncritical point. \n\n"}

This area law is rigorously proven to hold true in non-critical\nharmonic lattice system of arbitrary spatial dimension, for general\nfinite-ranged harmonic interactions, regions of arbitrary shape and states of\nnonzero temperature. For nearest-neighbor interactions - corresponding to the\nKlein-Gordon case - upper and lower bounds to the degree of entanglement can be\nstated explicitly for arbitrarily shaped regions, generalizing the findings of\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 060503 (2005)]. These higher dimensional analogues of the\nanalysis of block entropies in the one-dimensional case show that under general\nconditions, one can expect an area law for the entanglement in non-critical\nharmonic many-body systems. The proofs make use of methods from entanglement\ntheory, as well as of results on matrix functions of block banded matrices.\nDisordered systems are also considered. We moreover construct a class of\nexamples for which the two-point correlation length diverges, yet still an area\nlaw can be proven to hold. We finally consider the scaling of classical\ncorrelations in a classical harmonic system and relate it to a quantum lattice\nsystem with a modified interaction.
