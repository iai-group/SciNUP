Abstract: The Copernican principle, stating that we do not occupy any special place in\nour universe, is usually taken for granted in modern cosmology. However recent\nobservational data of supernova indicate that we may live in the under-dense\ncenter of our universe, which makes the Copernican principle challenged. It\nthus becomes urgent and important to test the Copernican principle via\ncosmological observations. Taking into account that unlike the cosmic photons,\nthe cosmic neutrinos of different energies come from the different places to us\nalong the different worldlines, we here propose cosmic neutrino background as a\ntest of the Copernican principle.

Two main schemes have been\nproposed for such a 'first' detection: measurements of ellipticity acquired by\na linearly polarized beam of light passing through a magnetic field and direct\nlight-light scattering. The study of the propagation of light through an\nexternal field can also be used to probe for new physics such as the existence\nof axion-like particles and millicharged particles. Their existence in nature\nwould cause the index of refraction of vacuum to be different from unity in the\npresence of an external field and dependent of the polarization direction of\nthe light propagating. The major achievement of reaching the project\nsensitivities in gravitational wave interferometers such as LIGO an VIRGO has\nopened the possibility of using such instruments for the detection of QED\ncorrections in electrodynamics and for probing new physics at very low\nenergies. In this paper we discuss the difference between direct birefringence\nmeasurements and index of refraction measurements.

In this model, the other scalars\nare considerably heavier and are not excluded by the current LHC data. If this\nassumption is correct, future LHC data should show a strengthening of the\n$\\gamma\\gamma$ signal, while the signals in the $ZZ^{(*)}\\to 4\\ell $ and\n$WW^{(*)}\\to 2\\ell 2\\nu$ channels should diminish and eventually disappear, due\nto the absence of diboson tree-level couplings of the CP-odd state.

The complete setup of the experiment consisted of a\nsilicon-tungsten electromagnetic calorimeter, an analog scintillator-steel\nhadron calorimeter and a scintillator-steel tail catcher.

The periodicity with respect to L/E is broken by 2-3\noscillations which, in the case of the normal (inverted) hierarchy, shift the\nfirst 16 oscillations nearly 1% higher (lower) and move the next 16 lower\n(higher). The energy of each peak determines a particular combination of the\nmass differences, for example cos^2(theta12)Delta M^2_31 + sin^2(theta12)Delta\nM^2_32 for nearly all peaks visible at baselines under 40 km. Comparing these\ncombinations with each other or with NOvA results one can in principle\ndetermine the mass hierarchy. Alternately, as the Fourier transforms of the 1-3\nand 2-3 oscillation probabilities are out of phase by the 1-2 oscillation\nprobability, near the maximum of the 1-2 oscillation the complex phase of the\ntotal survival probability can be used to determine the hierarchy. Two\ninterference effects make this task difficult. First, kilometer distances\nbetween the reactors reduce the amplitudes of peaks below about 4 MeV.

The second method uses the experimentally reconstructed shape of the\n$\\sqrt{s'}$ spectrum to determine the Beamstrahlung component of the bias. The\nlast, recently proposed, collision-frame method relies on the reconstruction of\nthe collision-frame velocity to define the selection function in the collision\nframe both in experiment and in theory.

As an application of this\nEFT method, we describe the near-threshold line shape of the $D^{\\ast 0}\\bar\nD^0$ invariant mass spectrum in $B\\rightarrow D^{\\ast 0}\\bar D^0 K$ and\ndetermine a nonvanishing value of $Z$.

It is therefore of interest to see whether the precision can be\nimproved by means of additional theoretical information on the pion\nelectromagnetic form factor, which controls the leading order contribution.

Although\nNaI(Tl) scintillators are being used in experiments aiming at the direct\ndetection of dark matter since the first nineties of the last century, very few\ndata about cosmogenic isotopes production rates have been published up to date.\nIn this work we present data from two 12.5 kg NaI(Tl) detectors, developed in\nthe frame of the ANAIS project, which were installed inside a convenient\nshielding at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory just after finishing surface\nexposure to cosmic rays. The very fast start of data taking allowed to identify\nand quantify isotopes with half-lives of the order of tens of days. Initial\nactivities underground have been measured and then production rates at sea\nlevel have been estimated following the history of detectors; values of about a\nfew tens of nuclei per kg and day for Te isotopes and 22Na and of a few\nhundreds for I isotopes have been found. These are the first direct estimates\nof production rates of cosmogenic nuclides in NaI crystals. A comparison of the\nso deduced rates with calculations using typical cosmic neutron flux at sea\nlevel and a carefully selected description of excitation functions will be also\npresented together with an estimate of the corresponding contribution to the\nbackground at low and high energies, which can be relevant for experiments\naiming at rare events searches. \n\n"}

Such resonances\ncan occur if the dark sector includes a U(1) gauge boson, or Z', which\nkinetically mixes with the Standard Model U(1). For small mixing, direct 2 to 1\nproduction of the Z' is not visible in standard resonance searches due to the\nlarge Drell-Yan background. However, there may be significant production of the\nZ' boson in processes involving other dark sector particles, resulting in final\nstates with a Z' resonance and missing transverse momentum. Examples of such\nprocesses include cascade decays within the dark sector and radiation of the Z'\noff of final state dark sector particles.

We consider the implications of such new\nresults both for the standard 3-flavor framework and for the non-standard 3+1\nscheme involving one sterile neutrino species. The 3-flavor analysis shows a\nconsolidation of the previous trends, namely a slight preference for $\\sin\n\\delta <0$, disfavoring CP conservation ($\\delta =0, \\pi$) with a statistical\nsignificance close to $90\\%$ C.L., and a mild preference (at more than 68\\%\nC.L.) for the normal hierarchy.

If the neutral gauge boson corresponding to this abelian\nsymmetry is ultra-light, then it will give rise to flavor-dependent long-range\nleptonic force, which can have significant impact on neutrino oscillations. For\nan instance, the electrons inside the Sun can generate a flavor-dependent\nlong-range potential at the Earth surface, which can suppress the $\\nu_{\\mu}\n\\to \\nu_e$ appearance probability in terrestrial experiments. The sign of this\npotential is opposite for anti-neutrinos, and affects the oscillations of\n(anti-)neutrinos in different fashion.

We quantify the\nuncertainty by constructing a nonparametric confidence set for the true\nspectrum, consisting of all those spectra that satisfy the shape constraints\nand that predict the observations within an appropriately calibrated level of\nfit. Projecting that set produces simultaneous confidence intervals for all\nfunctionals of the spectrum, including averages within bins. The confidence\nintervals have guaranteed conservative frequentist finite-sample coverage in\nthe important and challenging class of unfolding problems for steeply falling\nparticle spectra. We demonstrate the method using simulations that mimic\nunfolding the inclusive jet transverse momentum spectrum at the LHC. The\nshape-constrained intervals provide usefully tight conservative inferences,\nwhile the conventional methods suffer from severe undercoverage. \n\n"}

Instead, chipmakers have been\npushed into producing lower-power, multi-core processors such as GPGPU, ARM and\nIntel MIC. Broad-based efforts from manufacturers and developers have been\ndevoted to making these processors user-friendly enough to perform general\ncomputations. However, extracting performance from a larger number of cores, as\nwell as specialized vector or SIMD units, requires special care in algorithm\ndesign and code optimization. One of the most computationally challenging\nproblems in high-energy particle experiments is finding and fitting the\ncharged-particle tracks during event reconstruction. This is expected to become\nby far the dominant problem in the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider\n(HL-LHC), for example. Today the most common track finding methods are those\nbased on the Kalman filter. Experience with Kalman techniques on real tracking\ndetector systems has shown that they are robust and provide high physics\nperformance. This is why they are currently in use at the LHC, both in the\ntrigger and offline.

The MPGD based TPC is currently\nplanned to be used as a central tracking detector of the International Large\nDetector (ILD), which is one of the detector concepts for the future\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC) project, and which requires fine azimuthal\nspatial resolution of less than 100 ${\\rm \\mu m}$ over the drift length of the\nTPC to attain high momentum resolution.

Unexpected discoveries, such as the\ndiphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the\nconstruction of a photon collider. In order to enable the gamma-gamma collision\noption, the ILC design should be compatible with it from the very beginning. In\nthis paper, we discuss the problem of the beam crossing angle. In the ILC\ntechnical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough\nspace for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions,\nthe crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result\nfrom multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with\nthe opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector\nfield. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.\nIn this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as\nwell as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable\nreduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity. It is shown that the best solution is\nto increase the laser wavelength from the current 1 \\mum (which is optimal for\n2E=500 GeV) to 2 \\mum as this makes possible achieving high gamma-gamma\nluminosities at a crossing angle of 20 mrad, which is also quite comfortable\nfor e+e- collisions, does not cause any degradation of the e+e- luminosity and\nopens the possibility for a more energetic future collider in the same tunnel\n(e.g., CLIC).

We concentrate on radiative neutrino scattering on atomic electrons\n(or on free electrons in a conductor). Such processes can be coherent provided\nthat the net electron recoil momentum, i.e. the momentum transfer from the\nneutrino minus the momentum of the emitted photon, is sufficiently small. The\nradiative processes is an attractive possibility as the energy of the emitted\nphotons can be as large as the momentum transfer to the electron system and\ntherefore the problem of detecting extremely low energy recoils can be avoided.\nThe requirement of macroscopic coherence severely constrains the phase space\navailable for the scattered particle and the emitted photon. We show that in\nthe case of the scattering mediated by the usual weak neutral current and\ncharged current interactions this leads to a strong suppression of the\nelementary cross sections and therefore the requirement of macroscopic\ncoherence results in a reduction rather than an increase of the total detection\ncross section. However, for the $\\nu e$ scattering mediated by neutrino\nmagnetic or electric dipole moments coherence effects can actually increase the\ndetection rates. Effects of macroscopic coherence can also allow detection of\nneutrinos in 100 eV -- a few keV energy range, which is currently not\naccessible to the experiment. A similar coherent enhancement mechanism can work\nfor relativistic particles in the dark sector, but not for the conventionally\nconsidered non-relativistic dark matter. \n\n"}

However, these sawtooth-like\ndistortions are found to contribute at a magnitude of only a few percent\nrelative to the mass hierarchy-dependent oscillation pattern in Fourier space.\nIn the Fourier cosine and sine transforms, the features that encode a neutrino\nmass hierarchy dominate by over sixteen (thirty-three) times in prominence to\nthe maximal contribution of the sawtooth-like distortions from the detailed\nenergy spectrum, given $3.2\\%/\\sqrt{E_\\mathrm{vis.}/\\mathrm{MeV}}$ (perfect)\ndetector energy resolution.

Our results indicate that the energy loss of a\nslow supermassive monopole reach $10^{8} eV/cm$ and more if we take into\nconsideration the Cherenkov radiation of magnons or phonons and conductivity of\nthe media. A new method of search for cosmic and relict monopoles by\nmagnetically ordered film is considered too. This approach resembles the\ntraditional method of nuclear emulsion chamber. Apparently the proposed method\nis particularly attractive for detection of relict monopoles, released from\nmelting iron ore. \n\n"}

Perhaps the small values of neutrino masses could be explained\ngenerically in string theory even if it is more difficult to calculate\nindividual values, or perhaps some string constructions could be favored by\ngenerating small neutrino masses. We examine this issue in the context of the\nwell-known three-family standard-like Z_3 heterotic orbifolds, where the theory\nis well enough known to construct the corresponding operators allowed by string\nselection rules, and analyze the D- and F-flatness conditions. Surprisingly, we\nfind that a simple see-saw mechanism does not arise. It is not clear whether\nthis is a property of this construction, or of orbifolds more generally, or of\nstring theory itself. Extended see-saw mechanisms may be allowed; more analysis\nwill be needed to settle that issue. We briefly speculate on their form if\nallowed and on the possibility of alternatives, such as small Dirac masses and\ntriplet see-saws. The smallness of neutrino masses may be a powerful probe of\nstring constructions in general.
