The impossibility of constructing a\nnon-local and realistic theory, unless it entails highly counterintuitive\nfeatures, seems thus to have been experimentally proved.

In this paper, we show this to be\ntrue for Dirac equations in a background of gravitational and electromagnetic\nfields. We first transform any Dirac equation into an equivalent canonical\nform, sometimes used in particular cases to solve Dirac equations in a curved\nspacetime. This canonical form is needed to apply the Whitham Lagrangian\nmethod. The latter method, unlike the WKB method, places no restriction on the\nmagnitude of Planck's constant to obtain wave packets, and furthermore\npreserves the symmetries of the Dirac Lagrangian. We show using canonical Dirac\nfields in a curved spacetime, that the probability current has a Gordon\ndecomposition into a convection current and a spin current, and that the spin\ncurrent vanishes in the Whitham approximation, which explains the negligible\neffect of spin on wave packet solutions, independent of the size of Planck's\nconstant. We further discuss the classical-quantum correspondence in a curved\nspacetime based on both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of the Whitham\nequations. We show that the generalized de Broglie relations in a curved\nspacetime are a direct consequence of Whitham's Lagrangian method, and not just\na physical hypothesis as introduced by Einstein and de Broglie, and by many\nquantum mechanics textbooks. \n\n"}

Such task is\naccomplished by quantum authentication protocols which are distributed\nalgorithms based on the intrinsic properties of Quantum Mechanics. The choice\nof an authentication protocol must consider that quantum states are very\ndelicate and that the channel is subject to eavesdropping. However, even in\nface of the various existing definitions of quantum authentication protocols in\nthe literature, little is known about them in this perspective, and this lack\nof knowledge may unfavor comparisons and wise choices. In the attempt to\novercome this limitation, in the present work we aim at showing an approach to\nevaluate quantum authentication protocols based on the determination of their\nquantum communication complexity. Based on our investigation, no similar\nmethods to analyze quantum authentication protocols were found in the\nliterature.

A CWS code Q can\nbe represented by a self-dual additive code S and a classical code C, i.,e.,\nQ=(S,C), however this representation is in general not unique. We show that for\nany CWS code Q with certain permutation symmetry, one can always find a\nself-dual additive code S with the same permutation symmetry as Q such that\nQ=(S,C). As many good CWS codes have been found by starting from a chosen S,\nthis ensures that when trying to find CWS codes with certain permutation\nsymmetry, the choice of S with the same symmetry will suffice. A key step for\nthis result is a new canonical representation for CWS codes, which is given in\nterms of a unique decomposition as union stabilizer codes.

All current solutions require special structures\nin the initial source of randomness, or a certain independence relation among\ntwo or more sources.

In conjunction with\nthe recent work of Miller and Shi (arXiv:1402:0489), our physical randomness\nextractor uses just a single and general weak source, produces an arbitrarily\nlong and near-uniform output, with a close-to-optimal error, secure against\nall-powerful quantum adversaries, and tolerating a constant level of\nimplementation imprecision.

We argue that the\ntheory of operator spaces offers a natural framework for studying to what\nextent extractors are secure against quantum adversaries: we first phrase the\ndefinition of extractors as a bounded norm condition between normed spaces, and\nthen show that the presence of quantum adversaries corresponds to a completely\nbounded norm condition between operator spaces.

In\nthe smallest QEC codes, the information in one logical qubit is encoded in a\ntwo-dimensional subspace of a larger Hilbert space of multiple physical qubits.\nFor each code, a set of non-demolition multi-qubit measurements, termed\nstabilizers, can discretize and signal physical qubit errors without collapsing\nthe encoded information. Experimental demonstrations of QEC to date, using\nnuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions, photons, superconducting qubits, and\nNV centers in diamond, have circumvented stabilizers at the cost of decoding at\nthe end of a QEC cycle. This decoding leaves the quantum information vulnerable\nto physical qubit errors until re-encoding, violating a basic requirement for\nfault tolerance.

Abstract: Of course not, but if one believes that information cannot be destroyed in a\ntheory of quantum gravity, then we run into apparent contradictions with\nquantum theory when we consider evaporating black holes. Namely that the\nno-cloning theorem or the principle of entanglement monogamy is violated. Here,\nwe show that neither violation need hold, since, in arguing that black holes\nlead to cloning or non-monogamy, one needs to assume a tensor product structure\nbetween two points in space-time that could instead be viewed as causally\nconnected. In the latter case, one is violating the semi-classical causal\nstructure of space, which is a strictly weaker implication than cloning or\nnon-monogamy. We show that the lack of monogamy that can emerge in evaporating\nspace times is one that is allowed in quantum mechanics, and is very naturally\nrelated to a lack of monogamy of correlations of outputs of measurements\nperformed at subsequent instances of time of a single system. A particular\nexample of this is the Horowitz-Maldacena proposal, and we argue that it\nneedn't lead to cloning or violations of entanglement monogamy. For\nmeasurements on systems which appear to be leaving a black hole, we introduce\nthe notion of the temporal product, and argue that it is just as natural a\nchoice for measurements as the tensor product.

The usual attempts to resolve this conflict\nfor instance by appealing to decoherence or eigenstate thermalization are\nriddled with problems.

Sorkin has\nintroduced a hierarchy of mathematically conceivable higher-order interference\nbehaviours, where classical theory lies at the first level of this hierarchy\nand quantum theory theory at the second. Informally, the order in this\nhierarchy corresponds to the number of slits on which the interference pattern\nhas an irreducible dependence. Many authors have wondered why quantum\ninterference is limited to the second level of this hierarchy. Does the\nexistence of higher-order interference violate some natural physical principle\nthat we believe should be fundamental?

The results show that, when\nassisted by such a quantum machine learning technique, fidelities of the\ndeterministic single-photon agent states can achieve over 88% under a proper\nreward/punishment ratio within 50 iterations. This protocol offers a tool for\nreconstructing an unknown quantum state when only limited copies are provided,\nand can also be extended to higher dimensions, multipartite, and mixed quantum\nstate scenarios. \n\n"}

It follows that approximation is unavoidable to\nimplement the Fourier transforms by braiding conformal blocks. \n\n"}

In the limit where\nthe ancilla responds to fluctuations on a much shorter time scale than does the\nsystem, we show that it can be adiabatically eliminated, yielding a master\nequation for the system alone.

In the previous work it was shown how spurious randomness generally\ncontained in the outcomes can be eliminated without decreasing the amount of\nknowledge, to achieve an amount of data equal to the von Neumann entropy of the\nensemble. Here we extend this result by giving a more refined description of\nwhat constitute equivalent measurements (that is measurements which provide the\nsame knowledge about the quantum state) and also by considering incomplete\nmeasurements. In particular we show that one can always associate to a POVM\nwith elements a_j, an equivalent POVM acting on many independent copies of the\nsystem which produces an amount of data asymptotically equal to the entropy\ndefect of an ensemble canonically associated to the ensemble average state and\nthe initial measurement (a_j). In the case where the measurement is not\nmaximally refined this amount of data is strictly less than the von Neumann\nentropy, as obtained in the previous work. We also show that this is the best\nachievable, i.e. it is impossible to devise a measurement equivalent to the\ninitial measurement (a_j) that produces less data. We discuss the\ninterpretation of these results. In particular we show how they can be used to\nprovide a precise and model independent measure of the amount of knowledge that\nis obtained about a quantum state by a quantum measurement.

The entity that we want to\ndescribe does not necessarily have to be a physical entity, but can also be an\nentity of a more abstract nature, for example a concept, or a cultural\nartifact, or the mind of a person, etc..., which means that we aim at very\ngeneral description. The effect that a context has on the state of the entity\nplays a fundamental role, which means that our approach is intrinsically\ncontextual. The approach is inspired by the mathematical formalisms that have\nbeen developed in axiomatic quantum mechanics, where a specific type of quantum\ncontextuality is modelled. However, because in general states also influence\ncontext -- which is not the case in quantum mechanics -- we need a more general\nsetting than the one used there. Our focus on context as a fundamental concept\nmakes it possible to unify `dynamical change' and `change under influence of\nmeasurement', which makes our approach also more general and more powerful than\nthe traditional quantum axiomatic approaches. For this reason an experiment (or\nmeasurement) is introduced as a specific kind of context. Mathematically we\nintroduce a state context property system as the structure to describe an\nentity by means of its states, contexts and properties.

Abstract: Highly excited many-particle states in quantum systems (nuclei, atoms,\nquantum dots, spin systems, quantum computers) can be ``chaotic''\nsuperpositions of mean-field basis states (Slater determinants, products of\nspin or qubit states). This is a result of the very high energy level density\nof many-body states which can be easily mixed by a residual interaction between\nparticles. We consider the time dynamics of wave functions and increase of\nentropy in such chaotic systems.\n  As an example we present the time evolution in a closed quantum computer. A\ntime scale for the entropy S(t) increase is t_c =t_0/(n log_2{n}), where t_0 is\nthe qubit ``lifetime'', n is the number of qubits, S(0)=0 and S(t_c)=1. At t <<\nt_c the entropy is small: S= n t^2 J^2 log_2(1/t^2 J^2), where J is the\ninter-qubit interaction strength. At t > t_c the number of ``wrong'' states\nincreases exponentially as 2^{S(t)} . Therefore, t_c may be interpreted as a\nmaximal time for operation of a quantum computer, since at t > t_c one has to\nstruggle against the second law of thermodynamics. At t >>t_c the system\nentropy approaches that for chaotic eigenstates. \n\n"}
