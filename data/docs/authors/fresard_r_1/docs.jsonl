Depending on the field strength the superconductor is\neither in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS), or in the\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state of the Fulde-Ferrell (FF) type.\nThe strong correlations are accounted for by means of the Gutzwiller method\nwhat leads naturally to the emergence of the spin-dependent masses (SDM) of\nquasiparticles when the system is spin-polarized. The case without strong\ncorrelations (with the spin-independent masses, SIM) is analyzed for\ncomparison.

The junction\nconductance is presented for selected barrier strengths (i.e., in the contact,\nintermediate, and tunneling limits). The conductance spectra in the cases with\nand without strong correlations differ essentially. Our analysis provides thus\nan experimentally accessible test for the presence of strong-correlations in\nthe superconducting state. Namely, correlations alter the distance between the\nconductance peaks (or related conductance features) for carriers with spin-up\nand spin-down.

Here, we make\nthe connection between Abelian as well as non-Abelian FQH states and FCIs more\nprecise. Using a gauge-fixed version of Qi's Wannier basis representation of a\nChern band, we demonstrate that the interpolation between several FCI states,\nobtained by short-range lattice interactions in a spin-orbit-coupled kagome\nlattice model, and the corresponding continuum FQH states is smooth: the gap\nremains approximately constant and extrapolates to a finite value in the\nthermodynamic limit, while the low-lying part of the orbital entanglement\nspectrum remains qualitatively unaltered. The orbital entanglement spectra also\nprovide a first glimpse of the edge physics of FCIs via the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence.

Here we report the theoretical discovery of a\nfilling-enforced QBI - that is, a free electron insulator in which the band\nfilling is smaller than the minimum number dictated by the atomic picture.\nConsequently such insulators have no representation in terms of filling\nlocalized orbitals and must be QBIs. This is shown to occur in models of\ncertain cubic crystals with non-symmorphic space groups. Like topological\ninsulators, filling-enforced QBIs require spin-orbit coupling. However, in\ncontrast, they do not typically exhibit protected surface states. Instead their\nnontrivial nature is revealed by studying the quantum entanglement of their\nground state wavefunction. \n\n"}

Here we report another example of the AHE in a\nrelated antiferromagnet, namely, in the hexagonal chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Ge.\nOur single-crystal study reveals that Mn3Ge exhibits a giant anomalous Hall\nconductivity $|\\sigma_{xz}|$ ~ 60 per ohm per cm at room temperature and\napproximately 380 per ohm per cm at 5 K in zero field, reaching nearly half of\nthe value expected for the quantum Hall effect per atomic layer with Chern\nnumber of unity.

This is an important aspect for the low-energy realizations of the\nMajorana mass terms exploiting superfluid pairings, because in this case the\nMajorana condition is not implemented in the spinor space, but in an internal\n(flavour) space. Moreover, these mass terms generally involve opposite\neffective chiralities, similarly to a Dirac mass term. The net effect of these\nfeatures is that the Majorana condition does not imply a Majorana mass term.\nAccordingly the obtained Majorana spinors, as well as the resulting symmetry\nbreaking pattern and low-energy spectrum, are qualitatively different from the\nones known in particle physics.

The\ntensor ansatz formulated on a small cluster unit cell is inadequate to describe\nthe spiral order, and therefore the phase diagram at high azimuthal tilting\nangles remains undetermined. Here we obtain the full phase diagram of the model\nfrom numerical pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations. We\nshow that an extended quantum paramagnetic phase is realized between the\nN\\'{e}el and stripe/spiral phase. In this region, the spin susceptibility flows\nsmoothly down to the lowest numerical renormalization group scales with no sign\nof divergence or breakdown of the flow, in sharp contrast to the flow towards\nthe long-range ordered phases. Our results provide further evidence that the\ndipolar Heisenberg model is a fertile ground for quantum spin liquids. \n\n"}

We explore the hypothesis that the primary\nfluctuations responsible for the non-Fermi liquid physics are those associated\nwith the destruction of the large Fermi surface of the Fermi liquid. Magnetism\nis suggested to be a low-energy instability of the resulting small Fermi\nsurface state. A concrete realization of this picture is provided by a\nfractionalized Fermi liquid state which has a small Fermi surface of conduction\nelectrons, but also has other exotic excitations with interactions described by\na gauge theory in its deconfined phase. Of particular interest is a\nthree-dimensional fractionalized Fermi liquid with a spinon Fermi surface and a\nU(1) gauge structure. A direct second-order transition from this state to the\nconventional Fermi liquid is possible and involves a jump in the electron Fermi\nsurface volume.

More specifically, spin and\ncharge susceptibilities are expressed, in a conserving approximation, as a\nfunction of two constant irreducible vertices whose values are found\nself-consistently. The Mermin-Wagner theorem in two dimensions is automatically\nsatisfied. The effect of collective modes on single-particle properties is then\nobtained by a paramagnon-like formula that is consistent with the two-particle\nproperties in the sense that the potential energy obtained from $Tr\\Sigma G$ is\nidentical to that obtained using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for\nsusceptibilities. The vertex corrections are included through constant\nirreducible vertices. The theory is in quantitative agreement with Monte Carlo\nsimulations for both single-particle and two-particle properties.

Abstract: Deviations from Fermi liquid behavior are well documented in the normal state\nof the cuprate superconductors, and some of these differences seem to be\nrelated to pre-transitional features appearing at temperatures above T$_c$. The\nobservation of a pseudogap, e.g. in ARPES experiments, is a familiar example of\nthis physics. One potential explanation for this behaviour involves preformed\npairs with finite lifetimes existing in the normal state above T$_c$. In this\nway two characteristic temperatures can be established. A higher one T$^*$ at\nwhich pairs begin to form and the actual T$_c$ at which a phase-coherent\nsuperconducting phase is established.\n  In order to test these ideas we have investigated the negative U Hubbard\nmodel in two dimensions in the fully self-consistent ladder approximation at\nlow electron densities. In the non self-consistent version of this theory the\nsystem always shows an instability towards Bose-condensation of infinite\nlifetime pairs. In contrast to this, pairs obtain a finite lifetime due to\npair-pair interaction and the sharp two-particle bound state is strongly\nlifetime broadened when self-consistency is applied.

The fully\nself-consistent calculation we were able to perform using a ${\\bf {\\vec\nk}}$--averaged approximation in which the self-energy loses its ${\\bf {\\vec\nk}}$-dispersion due to a ${\\bf {\\vec k}}$-average.
