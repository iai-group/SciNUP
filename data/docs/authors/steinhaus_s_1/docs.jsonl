To overcome\nthis problem, we generalize and elaborate on a simple prescription, first\nintroduced by Hotta, Nishimura and Tsuchiya, which determines the most\nappropriate gauge to make the separation between diagonal components (D-brane\npositions) and off-diagonal components. This prescription makes it possible to\nextract the distribution of D-branes directly from matrices.

Distinct solutions\ncorrespond to different sectors, phases, of the theory, which are nothing but\ndistinct foliations of the vacuum manifold, or points in the Moduli Space (for\nall possible values of the parameters of the theory). Under this framework,\nthree different problems will be attacked: \"Mollifying QFT\", \"Topological\nTransitions and Geometric Langlands Duality\" and \"Three-dimensional Gravity and\nits Phase Transitions\". The first makes use of the Moduli Space of the theory\nin order to construct an appropriate mollification of it, rendering it viable\nto simulate a QFT in Lorentzian spaces, tackling the \"sign problem\" heads-on.\nThe connections with Lee-Yang zeros and Stokes Phenomena will be made clear.\nThe second will show that each different phase has its own topology which can\nbe used as Superselection Rule; moreover, the Euler Characteristic of each\nphase gives it quantization condition.

As there may be many answers to this\nquestion, we isolate a necessary condition, the SPASs property, that should be\nsatisfied by any reasonable notion of SPASs. This requires that if two theories\nconform to a common notion of SPASs, with one a subtheory of the other, and are\nisomorphic in some particular spacetime, then they should be isomorphic in all\nglobally hyperbolic spacetimes (of given dimension). The SPASs property is\nformulated in a functorial setting broad enough to describe general physical\ntheories describing processes in spacetime, subject to very minimal\nassumptions. By explicit constructions, the full class of locally covariant\ntheories is shown not to satisfy the SPASs property, establishing that there is\nno notion of SPASs encompassing all such theories.

It is well-known that the harmonic gauge imposes\nconstraints on the components of the metric tensor and also on the functional\nform of admissible coordinate transformations. These two sets of constraints\nare equivalent and represent the dual nature of the harmonic gauge. We explore\nthis duality and show that the harmonic gauge allows presenting an accelerated\nmetric in an elegant form that depends only on two harmonic potentials. It also\nallows reconstruction of the spatial structure of the post-Galilean coordinate\ntransformation functions relating inertial and accelerating frames. The\nremaining temporal dependence of these functions together with corresponding\nequations of motion are determined from dynamical conditions, obtained by\nconstructing the relativistic proper reference frame of an accelerated test\nparticle.

At the transition point the sphere expands abruptly to infinite size\nthen it evaporates as we increase the temperature (the gauge coupling\nconstant). The transition looks first order due to the discontinuity in the\naction whereas it looks second order due to the divergent peak in the specific\nheat.\n  The fuzzy sphere is stable for the supersymmetric models in the sense that\nthe bosonic phase transition is turned into a very slow crossover transition.\nThe transition point is found to scale to zero with N. We conjecture that the\ntransition from the background sphere to the phase of commuting matrices is\nassociated with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking.\n  The eigenvalues distribution of any of the bosonic matrices in the matrix\nphase is found to be given by a non-polynomial law obtained from the fact that\nthe joint probability distribution of the four matrices is uniform inside a\nsolid ball with radius R.

A crucial complement to lattice regularization is the\nprocess of renormalization through which a continuous description of the\nquantum theory arises. I provide a comprehensive conceptual discussion of the\nrenormalization of lattice-regularized quantum gravity models. I begin with a\npresentation of the renormalization group from the Wilsonian perspective.

The\nrelationship between quantum gravity and spacetime has been deemed \"emergence\",\nand the aim of this thesis is to investigate and explicate this relation.

In particular we analyze its asymptotic\nbehaviour in the double-scaling limit in which both the representation labels\nand the Chern-Simons coupling are taken to be large, but with fixed ratio. When\nthe Wilson graph operator has a specific form, motivated by loop quantum\ngravity, the critical point equations obtained in this double-scaling limit\ndescribe a very specific class of flat connection on the graph complement\nmanifold. We find that flat connections in this class are in correspondence\nwith the geometries of constant curvature 4-simplices. The result is fully\nnon-perturbative from the perspective of the reconstructed geometry. We also\nshow that the asymptotic behavior of the amplitude contains at the leading\norder an oscillatory part proportional to the Regge action for the single\n4-simplex in the presence of a cosmological constant. In particular, the\ncosmological term contains the full-fledged curved volume of the 4-simplex.\nInterestingly, the volume term stems from the asymptotics of the Chern-Simons\naction. This can be understood as arising from the relation between\nChern-Simons theory on the boundary of a region, and a theory defined by an\n$F^2$ action in the bulk.

Furthermore, it is shown that in\nthe lattice approach (as for gauge theories) the quantum theory is highly\nconstrained, and eventually by virtue of scaling depends on a rather small set\nof physical parameters.

Metric\nmeasure space involves a geometrical scalar $f$, dubbed as density function,\nwhich here appears as a conformal degree of freedom. In this framework, we\npresent conformally invariant field equations, the relevant identities and\ngeodesic equations. In metric measure space, the volume element and accordingly\nthe operators with integral based definitions are modified. For instance, the\ndivergence operator in this space differs from the Riemannian one. As a result,\na gravitational theory formulated in this space has a generalized second\nBianchi identity and a generalized conservation of energy-momentum tensor. It\nis shown how, by using the generalized identity for conservation of\nenergy-momentum tensor, one can obtain a conformally invariant geodesic\nequation. By comparison of the geodesic equations in metric measure space with\nthe Bohmian trajectories, in both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes, a\nrelation between density function $f$ and the quantum potential is proposed.\nThis suggests metric measure space to be considered as a suitable framework for\ngeometric description of Bohm's quantum mechanics.

The most general solution for the distribution function is given in\nterms of appropriate symplectic coordinates on the cotangent bundle, and the\nassociated observables, including the particle current density and stress\nenergy-momentum tensor, are determined. Next, we explore the case where the\nflow is steady-state and spherically symmetric.

In this second paper of\nthe series, we choose a particular class of boundary spin-network states which\nimpose Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary conditions to the partition function. The\npeculiarity of these states is to encode a two-dimensional quantum geometry\npeaked around a classical quadrangulation of the finite toroidal boundary.\nThanks to the topological properties of three-dimensional gravity, the theory\neasily projects onto the boundary while crucially still keeping track of the\ntopological properties of the bulk.

The UV regulator is to be taken away by\nrenormalisation group techniques which in case of success leads to a measure on\nthe space of generalised Euclidian fields in finite volume. The IR regulator\ncorresponds to the thermodynamic limit of the system in the statistical physics\nsense. If the resulting measure obeys the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms, the\nactual QFT on Minkowski space is then obtained by Osterwalder-Schrader\nreconstruction. In this work we study the question whether it is possible to\nreformulate the renormalisation group non-perturbatively directly at the\noperator (Hamiltonian) level. Hamiltonian renormalisation would be the natural\nroute to follow if one had easier access to an interacting Hamiltonian operator\nrather than to a path integral, at least in the presence of UV and/or IR\ncut-off, which is generically the case in complicated gauge theories such as\nGeneral Relativity.

Instead, the interaction can occur\ndirectly along light cones, in a way similar to the Wheeler-Feynman formulation\nof classical electrodynamics. For two particles, the wave function is here of\nthe form $\\psi(x_1,x_2)$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are spacetime points.\nSpecifically, we consider a natural class of covariant equations governing the\ntime evolution of $\\psi$ involving integration over light cones, or even more\ngeneral spacetime regions.

To do so we perform the canonical formulation\nof the anisotropic conformal theory at the classical level with a general\nconformal potential. Both theories have the generator of the anisotropic Weyl\ntransformations as a constraint but it changes from first to second-class when\nthe Weyl symmetry is broken. The FDiff-covariant vector a_i = \\partial_i \\ln N\nplays the role of gauge connection for the anisotropic Weyl transformations. A\nLagrange multiplier plays also the role of gauge connection, being the time\ncomponent. The anisotropic conformal theory propagates the same number of\ndegrees of freedom of the kinetic-conformal theory, which in turn are the same\nof General Relativity. This is due to exchange of a second-class constraint in\nthe kinetic-conformal case by a gauge symmetry in the anisotropic conformal\ncase.

{"id": "hep-ph/0011160", "contents": "Title: The Development of Equilibrium After Preheating Abstract: We present a fully nonlinear study of the development of equilibrium after\npreheating. Preheating is the exponentially rapid transfer of energy from the\nnearly homogeneous inflaton field to fluctuations of other fields and/or the\ninflaton itself. This rapid transfer leaves these fields in a highly nonthermal\nstate with energy concentrated in infrared modes. We have performed lattice\nsimulations of the evolution of interacting scalar fields during and after\npreheating for a variety of inflationary models. We have formulated a set of\ngeneric rules that govern the thermalization process in all of these models.\nNotably, we see that once one of the fields is amplified through parametric\nresonance or other mechanisms it rapidly excites other coupled fields to\nexponentially large occupation numbers. These fields quickly acquire nearly\nthermal spectra in the infrared, which gradually propagates into higher\nmomenta. Prior to the formation of total equilibrium, the excited fields group\ninto subsets with almost identical characteristics (e.g. group effective\ntemperature). The way fields form into these groups and the properties of the\ngroups depend on the couplings between them.

What we still\nlack is a definitive Theory of Quantum Gravity to give us a detailed and\nquantitative description of the highly curved and quantum-fluctuating geometry\nof spacetime at this so-called Planck scale. - This article outlines a\nparticular approach to constructing such a theory, that of Causal Dynamical\nTriangulations, and its achievements so far in deriving from first principles\nwhy spacetime is what it is, from the tiniest realms of the quantum to the\nlarge-scale structure of the universe. \n\n"}

We show that the\nresulting Fokker-Planck PDE is the natural diffusion flow for probability\nmeasures absolutely continuous with respect to the Ricci-evolved Riemannian\nmeasure, we discuss its exponential trend to equilibrium, and its relation with\nthe viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation. \n\n"}

{"id": "physics/0604164", "contents": "Title: Geometrothermodynamics Abstract: We present the fundamentals of geometrothermodynamics, an approach to study\nthe properties of thermodynamic systems in terms of differential geometric\nconcepts. It is based, on the one hand, upon the well-known contact structure\nof the thermodynamic phase space and, on the other hand, on the metric\nstructure of the space of thermodynamic equilibrium states. In order to make\nthese two structures compatible we introduce a Legendre invariant set of\nmetrics in the phase space, and demand that their pullback generates metrics on\nthe space of equilibrium states. We show that Weinhold's metric, which was\nintroduced {\\it ad hoc}, is not contained within this invariant set. We propose\nalternative metrics which allow us to redefine the concept of thermodynamic\nlength in an invariant manner and to study phase transitions in terms of\ncurvature singularities. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0408124", "contents": "Title: Geometry of the Casimir Effect Abstract: When the vacuum is partitioned by material boundaries with arbitrary shape,\none can define the zero-point energy and the free energy of the electromagnetic\nwaves in it: this can be done, independently of the nature of the boundaries,\nin the limit that they become perfect conductors, provided their curvature is\nfinite. The first examples we consider are Casimir's original configuration of\nparallel plates, and the experimental situation of a sphere in front of a\nplate. For arbitrary geometries, we give an explicit expression for the\nzero-point energy and the free energy in terms of an integral kernel acting on\nthe boundaries; it can be expanded in a convergent series interpreted as a\nsuccession of an even number of scatterings of a wave. The quantum and thermal\nfluctuations of vacuum then appear as a purely geometric property. The Casimir\neffect thus defined exists only owing to the electromagnetic nature of the\nfield. It does not exist for thin foils with sharp folds, but Casimir forces\nbetween solid wedges are finite. We work out various applications: low\ntemperature, high temperature where wrinkling constraints appear, stability of\na plane foil, transfer of energy from one side of a curved boundary to the\nother, forces between distant conductors, special shapes (parallel plates,\nsphere, cylinder, honeycomb). \n\n"}

Daseinisation and the\n  Liberation of Quantum Theory Abstract: This paper is the second in a series whose goal is to develop a fundamentally\nnew way of constructing theories of physics. The motivation comes from a desire\nto address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating quantum theories\nof space and time. Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of\nphysics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain\nformal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics arises when\nthe topos is the category of sets. Other types of theory employ a different\ntopos. In this paper, we study in depth the topos representation of the\npropositional language, PL(S), for the case of quantum theory. In doing so, we\nmake a direct link with, and clarify, the earlier work on applying topos theory\nto quantum physics. The key step is a process we term `daseinisation' by which\na projection operator is mapped to a sub-object of the spectral presheaf--the\ntopos quantum analogue of a classical state space. In the second part of the\npaper we change gear with the introduction of the more sophisticated local\nlanguage L(S). From this point forward, throughout the rest of the series of\npapers, our attention will be devoted almost entirely to this language. In the\npresent paper, we use L(S) to study `truth objects' in the topos. These are\nobjects in the topos that play the role of states: a necessary development as\nthe spectral presheaf has no global elements, and hence there are no\nmicrostates in the sense of classical physics. Truth objects therefore play a\ncrucial role in our formalism. \n\n"}

Here we propose\nanalogs of one of those amplitudes associated with multidimensional euclidean\nspaces, paying most attention to the 3-dimensional case.
