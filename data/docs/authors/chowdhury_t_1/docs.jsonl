We explore the possibility that they could be observably large\nin CMB, LSS, and Lyman-alpha data.

The current bound on the spin-independent scattering\ncross section is sigma^SI < 10 zb for dark matter masses m_chi ~ 100 GeV, with\nimproved sensitivities expected soon. We examine the implications of this\nprogress for neutralino dark matter. We work in a supersymmetric framework\nwell-suited to dark matter studies that is simple and transparent, with models\ndefined in terms of four weak-scale parameters. We first show that robust\nconstraints on electric dipole moments motivate large sfermion masses mtilde >\n1 TeV, effectively decoupling squarks and sleptons from neutralino dark matter\nphenomenology. In this case, we find characteristic cross sections in the\nnarrow range 1 zb < sigma^SI < 40 zb for m_chi > 70 GeV. As sfermion masses are\nlowered to near their experimental limit mtilde ~ 400 GeV, the upper and lower\nlimits of this range are extended, but only by factors of around two, and the\nlower limit is not significantly altered by relaxing many particle physics\nassumptions, varying the strange quark content of the nucleon, including the\neffects of galactic small-scale structure, or assuming other components of dark\nmatter.

Axions are among the best-motivated inflaton\ncandidates, since the flatness of their potential is naturally protected by a\nshift symmetry. We re-consider the cosmological perturbations in axion\ninflation, consistently accounting for the coupling to gauge fields \\phi F\n\\tilde{F}, which is generically present in these models.

Slowed down in terrestrial\nmatter OHe atoms cause negligible effects of nuclear recoil in underground\ndetectors, but can experience radiative capture by nuclei. Local concentration\nof OHe in the matter of detectors is rapidly adjusted to the incoming flux of\ncosmic OHe and possess annual modulation due to Earth's orbital motion around\nthe Sun. The potential of OHe-nucleus interaction is determined by polarization\nof OHe by the Coulomb and nuclear force of the approaching nucleus. Stark-like\neffect by the Coulomb force of nucleus makes this potential attractive at\nlarger distances, while change of polarization by the effect of nuclear force\ngives rise to a potential barrier, preventing merging of nucleus with helium\nshell of OHe atom. The existence of the corresponding shallow well beyond the\nnucleus can provide the conditions, at which nuclei in the matter of DAMA/NaI\nand DAMA/LIBRA detectors have a few keV binding energy with OHe, corresponding\nto a level in this well. Annual modulation of the radiative capture rate to\nthis level can reproduce DAMA results. The OHe hypothesis can qualitatively\nexplain the controversy in the results of direct dark matter searches by\nspecifics of OHe nuclear interaction with the matter of underground detectors. \n\n"}

In the past literature,\nactive neutrino asymmetries have been invoked as a way to inhibit the sterile\nneutrino production via the in-medium suppression of the sterile-active mixing\nangle. However, neutrino asymmetries also permit a resonant sterile neutrino\nproduction.

Our analysis shows that EWDM exhibits not only the usual Sommerfeld\nenhancement with resonance peaks but also dips where the cross section is\nsuppressed. Moreover, we have shown that the non-perturbative effects become\nimportant even when the EWDM mass is below the TeV scale, provided that some of\nthe mass splitting are reduced to the order of a few MeV. This extends the\npossibility of observing sizeable non-perturbative effects in the dark matter\nannihilation to values of the dark matter mass significantly smaller than\npreviously considered, since only electroweak--induced mass splittings larger\nthan 100 MeV have been discussed in the literature so far.

We show that the late-time waveform\nof massive scalar perturbations is dominated by a universal oscillatory\ndecaying tail, which appears due to curvature effects. We also show that the\nenergy spectrum is in perfect agreement with a ZFL calculation once no-hair\nproperties of black holes are taken into account. In the second part, we study\nthe phenomenon of superradiance in higher dimensions and conjecture that the\nmaximum energy extracted from a rotating black hole can be understood in terms\nof the ergoregion proper volume. We then study some consequences of\nsuperradiance in the dynamics of moons orbiting around higher-dimensional\nrotating black holes.

In this paper we argue that, during inflation, the\nelectroweak vacuum can actually be very short-lived, contrary to the conclusion\nthat follows from the flat spacetime analysis. Namely, in the case of a pure\nHiggs potential the electroweak vacuum decays via the Hawking-Moss transition,\nwhich has no flat spacetime analogue. As a result, the Higgs vacuum is\nunstable, unless the rate of inflation is low enough: $H_{\\rm inf}\\lesssim\n10^9-10^{12}$ GeV. Models of inflation with such a low rate typically predict\nnegligible tensor perturbations in the cosmic microwave background radiation\n(CMBR).

The inflationary potential takes into\naccount both radiative and supergravity corrections, as well as an important\nsoft supersymmetry breaking term, with a mass coefficient in the range $(0.1 -\n10)~{\\rm TeV}$. The latter term assists in obtaining a scalar spectral index\n$n_s$ close to $0.96$, as strongly suggested by the PLANCK and WMAP-9yr\nmeasurements.

The inflaton is identified with a\nHiggs-like modulus whose the vacuum expectation value controls the\ngravitational strength.

In this model the inflaton, in addition to providing\nreheating to the Standard Model (SM) particles, decays directly into sterile\nneutrinos.

This criterion is obeyed by all\nknown ultraviolet completions and is needed to evade pathologies from stable\nblack hole remnants. In this paper, we explore the WGC from the perspective of\nlow-energy effective field theory. Below the charged particle threshold, the\neffective action describes a photon and graviton interacting via\nhigher-dimension operators. We derive infrared consistency conditions on the\nparameters of the effective action using i) analyticity of light-by-light\nscattering, ii) unitarity of the dynamics of an arbitrary ultraviolet\ncompletion, and iii) absence of superluminality and causality violation in\ncertain non-trivial backgrounds.

For\nthe purpose we work on a metric in the gravity side, {\\em viz.} OKS-BH\ngeometry, whose dual in the gauge theory side runs with the energy and hence\nproves to be a better background for thermal QCD. The potential obtained has\nconfining term both in vacuum and in medium, in addition to the Coulomb term\nalone, usually reported in the literature. As the velocity of the pair is\nincreased the screening of the potential gets weakened, which may be understood\nby the decrease of effective temperature with the increase of velocity. The\ncrucial observation of our work is that beyond a critical separation of the\nheavy quark pair, the potential develops an imaginary part which is nowadays\nunderstood to be the main source of dissociation. The imaginary part is found\nto vanish at small $r$, thus agrees with the perturbative result.

This is\nparticularly true for the helicity-suppressed annihilation of Majorana\nparticles, like neutralinos, into fermion pairs. Surprisingly, and despite the\npotentially large effect due to the strong coupling, this has so far been\nstudied in much less detail for the internal bremsstrahlung of gluons than for\nphotons or electroweak gauge bosons. Here, we aim at bridging that gap by\npresenting a general analysis of neutralino annihilation into quark anti-quark\npairs and a gluon, allowing e.g. for arbitrary neutralino compositions and\nkeeping the leading quark mass dependence at all stages in the calculation. We\nfind in some cases largely enhanced annihilation rates, especially for\nscenarios with squarks being close to degenerate in mass with the lightest\nneutralino, but also notable distortions in the associated antiproton and\ngamma-ray spectra. Both effects significantly impact limits from indirect\nsearches for dark matter and are thus important to be taken into account in,\ne.g., global scans.

The first class consists of \"diagonal\" processes\ninvolving only a single species of dark-matter particle -- processes analogous\nto those which arise in single-component dark-matter scenarios.

Here we consider a Higgs portal freeze-in dark matter model\nbased on a scalar clockwork sector with a mass scale which is less than the\nHiggs boson mass.

In models whose supersymmetry (SUSY)-breaking\nhidden sectors contain U(1) gauge factors, we show that such terms will\ngenerically arise and communicate SUSY-breaking to the visible sector through\nmixing with hypercharge.

The significant\nheavy threshold effect related with the generic mass splitting of adjoint\nmoduli is shown to alter appropriately the running of gauge couplings towards\nthe realistic string-scale grand unification.

The obstruction involves the signs\nof a set of leading irrelevant operators, which must be strictly positive to\nensure UV analyticity. An IR manifestation of this restriction is that the\n\"wrong\" signs lead to superluminal fluctuations around non-trivial backgrounds,\nmaking it impossible to define local, causal evolution, and implying a\nsurprising IR breakdown of the effective theory. Such effective theories can\nnot arise in quantum field theories or weakly coupled string theories, whose\nS-matrices satisfy the usual analyticity properties.
