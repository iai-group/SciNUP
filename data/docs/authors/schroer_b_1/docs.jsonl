It arises as a linear combination of internal space components of\nhigher rank forms, which are axion-like at low energies, and may mix with\n4-forms after compactification of the Chern-Simons terms to 4D due to internal\nspace fluxes. The mixing induces an effective mass term, with an action which\n{\\it preserves} the axion shift symmetry, breaking it spontaneously after the\nbackground selection. With several axions, several 4-forms, and a low string\nscale, as in one of the setups already invoked for dynamically explaining a\ntiny residual vacuum energy in string theory, the 4D mass matrix generated by\nrandom fluxes may have ultralight eigenmodes over the landscape, which are\nquintessence. We illustrate how this works in simplest cases, and outline how\nto get the lightest mass to be comparable to the Hubble scale now, $H_0 \\sim\n10^{-33} {\\rm eV}$. The shift symmetry protects the smallest mass from\nperturbative corrections in field theory. Further, if the ultralight eigenmode\ndoes not couple directly to any sector strongly coupled at a high scale, the\nnon-perturbative field theory corrections to its potential will also be\nsuppressed. Finally, if the compactification length is larger than the string\nlength by more than an order of magnitude, the gravitational corrections may\nremain small too, even when the field value approaches $M_{Pl}$. \n\n"}

We argue that in a consistent stochastic approach the\ndistance-inflaton's PDF must vanish for geometrically forbidden field values.\nWe propose to implement these extra-dimensional spatial restrictions into the\nPDF by installing absorbing (or reflecting) walls at the respective boundaries\nin field space. As a toy model, we consider a DBI inflaton between two\nabsorbing walls and use the method of images to determine its most general PDF.\nThe resulting PDF is studied in detail for the example of a quartic warp factor\nand a chaotic inflaton potential. The presence of the walls is shown to affect\nthe inflaton trajectory for a given set of parameters. \n\n"}

The issue of causal localization is\nalso the arena where misunderstandings led to a serious derailment of large\npart of particle theory e.g. the misinterpretation of an infinite component\npointlike field resulting from the quantization of the Nambu-Goto Lagrangian as\na spacetime quantum string. The new concept of modular localization, which\nreplaces Jordan's causal locality, is especially important to overcome the\nimperfections of gauge theories for which Jordan was the first to note nonlocal\naspects of physical (not Lagrangian) charged fields. Two interesting subjects\nin which Jordan was far ahead of his contemporaries will be presented in two\nseparate sections. \n\n"}

This comparison of fluctuations in\nsubsystems of heat bath systems (Einstein) with those resulting from the\nrestriction of the QFT vacuum state to an open subvolume (Jordan) leads to a\nperfect analogy; the globally pure vacuum state becomes upon local restriction\na strongly impure KMS state. This phenomenon of localization-caused thermal\nbehavior as well as the vacuum-polarization clouds at the causal boundary of\nthe localization region places localization in QFT into a sharp contrast with\nquantum mechanics and justifies the attribute \"holstic\".

One of\nthe main themes in this work is that, after a careful study of the mathematics\nof the symmetry algebras one finds that in an integrable model, one can\ndirectly reconstruct S-matrices just from the algebra. It has been known for a\nlong time that S-matrices in integrable models are fixed by symmetry. However,\nLie algebra symmetry, the Yang-Baxter equation, crossing and unitarity, which\nare what constrains the S-matrix in integrable models, are often taken to be\nseparate, independent properties of the S-matrix. Here, we construct scattering\nmatrices purely from the Yangian, showing that the Yangian is the right\nalgebraic object to unify all required symmetries of many integrable models. In\nparticular, we reconstruct the S-matrix of the principal chiral field, and, up\nto a CDD factor, of other integrable field theories with su(n) symmetry.\nFurthermore, we study the AdS/CFT correspondence, which is also believed to be\nintegrable in the planar limit.

Thus far, discussions on this topic have mostly assumed that in a\nconsistent theory of gravity and quantum mechanics, quantum theory will be\nunmodified. Here, we examine the black hole information problem in the context\nof generalisations of quantum theory. In particular, we examine black holes in\nthe setting of generalised probabilistic theories, in which quantum theory and\nclassical probability theory are special cases. We compute the time it takes\ninformation to escape a black hole, assuming that information is preserved. We\nfind that under some very general assumptions, the arguments of Page (that\ninformation should escape the black hole after half the Hawking photons have\nbeen emitted), and the black-hole mirror result of Hayden and Preskill (that\ninformation can escape quickly) need to be modified. The modification is\ndetermined entirely by what we call the Wootters-Hardy parameter associated\nwith a theory. We find that although the information leaves the black hole\nafter enough photons have been emitted, it is fairly generic that it fails to\nappear outside the black hole at this point -- something impossible in quantum\ntheory due to the no-hiding theorem. The information is neither inside the\nblack hole, nor outside it, but is delocalised. Our central technical result is\nan information decoupling theorem which holds in the generalised probabilistic\nframework. \n\n"}

The beginning of the story dates\nback to a pioneering work by Hilbert, who first formalized the concept of\nlinearization of the collision operator and pointed out the importance of its\neigenvalues with respect to a certain asymptotic behavior of the Boltzmann\nequation. Under really mild conditions on initial data - close to being\nnecessary - and a weak, physically consistent, angular cutoff hypothesis, our\nmain result (Theorem 1.1) contains the first precise statement that the total\nvariation distance between the solution and the limiting Maxwellian\ndistribution admits an upper bound of the form C e^{Lambda_b t}, Lambda_b being\nthe least negative of the aforesaid eigenvalues and C a constant which depends\nonly on a few simple numerical characteristics (e.g. moments) of the initial\ndatum. The validity of this quantification was conjectured, about fifty years\nago, in a paper by Henry P. McKean but, in spite of several attempts, the best\nanswer known up to now consists in a bound with a rate which can be made\narbitrarily close to Lambda_b, to the cost of the \"explosion\" of the constant\nC. Moreover, its deduction is subject to restrictive hypotheses on the initial\ndatum, besides the Grad angular cutoff condition. As to the proof of our\nresults, we have taken as point of reference an analogy between the problem of\nconvergence to equilibrium and the central limit theorem of probability theory,\nhighlighted by McKean. Our work represents in fact a confirmation of this\nanalogy, since the techniques we develop here crucially rely on certain\nformulations of the central limit theorem. \n\n"}

Abstract: We argue that a unitary description of the formation and evaporation of a\nblack hole implies that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is the \"entropy of a\nvacuum\": the logarithm of the number of possible independent ways in which\nquantum field theory on a fixed classical spacetime background can emerge in a\nfull quantum theory of gravity. In many cases, the covariant entropy counts\nthis entropy--the degeneracy of emergent quantum field theories in full quantum\ngravity--with the entropy of particle excitations in each quantum field theory\ngiving only a tiny perturbation. In the Rindler description of a (black hole)\nhorizon, the relevant vacuum degrees of freedom manifest themselves as an extra\nhidden quantum number carried by the states representing the second exterior\nregion; this quantum number is invisible in the emergent quantum field theory.\nIn a distant picture, these states arise as exponentially degenerate ground and\nexcited states of the intrinsically quantum gravitational degrees of freedom on\nthe stretched horizon. The formation and evaporation of a black hole involve\nprocesses in which the entropy of collapsing matter is transformed into that of\na vacuum and then to that of final-state Hawking radiation. In the intermediate\nstage of this evolution, entanglement between the vacuum and (early) Hawking\nradiation develops, which is transferred to the entanglement among final-state\nHawking quanta through the evaporation process. The horizon is kept smooth\nthroughout the evolution; in particular, no firewall develops. Similar\nconsiderations also apply for cosmological horizons, for example for the\nhorizon of a meta-stable de-Sitter space. \n\n"}

On the other hand, in R x H$^2$ the\nsituation is more complicated, since the isometry group of H$^2$ admits\nelliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic elements. One might thus ask what the\ngravity duals of the flows corresponding to these three different cases are.\nAnswering this question is one of the scopes of this paper. In particular we\nidentify the black hole dual to a fluid that is purely translating on the\nhyperbolic plane. Although this lies within the Carter-Plebanski (CP) class, it\nhas never been studied in the literature before, and represents thus in\nprinciple a new black hole solution in AdS$_4$. For a rigidly rotating fluid in\nR x H$^2$ (holographically dual to the hyperbolic KNAdS$_4$ solution), there is\na certain radius where the velocity reaches the speed of light, and thus the\nfluid can cover only the region within this radius. Quite remarkably, it turns\nout that the boundary of the hyperbolic KNAdS$_4$ black hole is conformal to\nexactly that part of R x H$^2$ in which the fluid velocity does not exceed the\nspeed of light.

Traditionally the clash\nbetween pointlike localization and the the Hilbert space was resolved by\npassing to a Krein space setting which resulted in the well-known BRST gauge\nformulation.

Unlike QM it does not\nrefer to individual operators but rather to ensembles of observables which\nshare the same localization region, as a result it explains the probabilistic\naspects of QFT in terms of the impure KMS nature arising from the local\nrestriction of the pure vacuum. Whereas it played no important role in the\nperturbation theory of low spin particles, it becomes indispensible for\ninteractions which involve higher spin $s\\geq1$ fields, where is leads to the\nreplacement of the operator (BRST) gauge theory setting in Krein space by a new\nformulation in terms of stringlocal fields in Hilbert space.

In particular this first part describes the\nanalytic continuation, the functional equation, trivial zeros, the Euler\nproduct formula, Riemann's main result relating the zeros on the critical strip\nto the distribution of primes, the exact counting formula for the number of\nzeros on the strip $N(T)$, and the GUE statistics of the zeros on the critical\nline. We then turn to presenting some new results obtained in the past year and\ndescribe several strategies towards proving the RH. First we describe an\nelectrostatic analogy and argue that if the electric potential along the line\n$\\Re (z) =1$ is a regular alternating function, the RH would follow. The main\nnew result is that the zeros on the critical line are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the zeros of the cosine function, and this leads to a\ntranscendental equation for the $n$-th zero on the critical line that depends\nonly on $n$. If there is a unique solution to this equation for every $n$,\ndenoting $N_0 (T)$ the number of zeros on the critical line, then $N_0(T) =\nN(T)$, i.e. all zeros are on the critical line. These results are generalized\nto two infinite classes of functions, Dirichlet $L$-functions and $L$-functions\nbased on modular forms. We present extensive numerical analysis of the\nsolutions of these equations. We apply these methods to the Davenport-Heilbronn\n$L$-function, which is known to have zeros off of the line, and explain why the\nRH fails in this case.

The resulting new Lagrangian is second-order in derivatives, and\ncontains two-component spinors of only one chirality. The new second-order\nformulation simplifies the fermion Feynman rules of the theory considerably,\n$e.g.$ the propagator becomes a multiple of an identity matrix in the field\nspace. The aim of this thesis is to work out the details of this formulation\nfor theories such as Quantum Electrodynamics, and the Standard Model of\nelementary particles.

It is well-known that for pure states, essentially all\nentanglement measures are equal to the v. Neumann entropy of the reduced state,\nbut for mixed states, this uniqueness is lost. In quantum field theory,\nbipartite systems are associated with causally disjoint regions. There are no\nseparable (normal) states to begin with when the regions touch each other, so\none must leave a finite \"safety-corridor\". Due to this corridor, the normal\nstates of bipartite systems are necessarily mixed, and the v. Neumann entropy\nis not a good entanglement measure in the above sense.\n  In this paper, we study various entanglement measures which vanish on\nseparable states, do not increase under separable (local) operations, and have\nother desirable properties. In particular, we study the relative entanglement\nentropy, defined as the minimum relative entropy between the given state and an\narbitrary separable state. We establish rigorous upper and lower bounds in\nvarious quantum field theoretic (QFT) models, as well as also model-independent\nones. The former include free fields on static spacetime manifolds in general\ndimensions, or integrable models with factorizing $S$-matrix in 1+1 dimensions.\nThe latter include bounds on ground states in general conformal QFTs, charged\nstates (including charges with braid-group statistics) or thermal states in\ntheories satisfying a \"nuclearity condition\". Typically, the bounds show a\ndivergent behavior when the systems get close to each other--sometimes of the\nform of a generalized \"area law\"--and decay when the systems are far apart. Our\nmain technical tools are of operator algebraic nature. \n\n"}

The key role in this\napproach are the first integrals of the field equations. We start with the Lie\npoint symmetries and the first integrals defined by them, that is the Hojman\nintegrals. Subsequently we discuss the Noether point symmetries and the well\nknown method for deriving the Noether integrals. By means of the Inverse\nNoether Theorem we show that to every Hojman quadratic first integral one is\npossible to associate a Noether symmetry whose Noether integral is the original\nHojman integral. It is emphasized that the point transformation generating this\nNoether symmetry need not coincide with the point transformation defining the\nLie symmetry which produces the Hojman integral.

Indeed, linearization of\na classical field theory (a field theoretic ``normal mode analysis'') results\nin fluctuations whose propagation is governed by a Lorentzian-signature curved\nspacetime ``effective metric''. For a single scalar field, this procedure\nresults in a unique effective metric, which is quite sufficient for simulating\nkinematic aspects of general relativity (up to and including Hawking\nradiation).

The higher-dimensional embedding of\nthese solutions has the novel interpretation of (sphere compactified) brane\nconfigurations in the domain ``inside the horizon region,'' with the\nsingularity corresponding to the sphere shrinking to zero volume. The naked\nsingularity is the source of an infinite attractive gravitational potential for\nthe fluctuating modes.

(ii) The exact\nexpressions for the heterotic superstring are derived from their exact bosonic\nstring counterparts by shifting the central extension $k\\to 2k-h$ (but an\noverall factor $(k-g)$ remains unshifted). (iii) The combination\n$e^\\Phi\\sqrt{-G}$ is independent of $k$ and therefore can be computed in lowest\norder perturbation theory as required by the correct formulation of a\nconformally invariant path integral measure.

Furthermore, we comment on known diagrammatical\napproaches to quantum information phenomena from the perspectives of both\ntensor categories and topological quantum field theories.

For the first-order\ncase it is shown that the intertwining relations imply some hidden symmetry\nwhich in turn results in a $R$-separation of variables. The Fokker-Planck and\ndiffusion equation are briefly considered. Second-order intertwining operators\nare also discussed within a general approach. However, due to its complicated\nstructure only particular solutions are given in some detail. \n\n"}
