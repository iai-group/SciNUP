Double beta experiments are long-running underground\nexperiments with specific challenges concerning the background reduction and\nthe long term stability. These problems are addressed in this work for the\nHeidelberg-Moscow (HdM), GENIUS Test Facility (TF) and GERDA experiments. The\nHdM experiment collected data with enriched 76Ge high purity (HPGe) detectors\nfrom 1990 to 2003. An improved analysis of HdM data is presented, exploiting\nnew calibration and spectral shape measurements with the HdM detectors.\nGENIUS-TF was a test-facility that verified the feasibility of using bare\ngermanium detectors in liquid nitrogen. The first year results of this\nexperiment are discussed. The GERDA experiment has been designed to further\nincrease the sensitivity by operating bare germanium detectors in a high purity\ncryogenic liquid, which simultaneously serves as a shielding against background\nand as a cooling media.

In this review a brief overview of the basics of the nuclear shell\nmodel will be given together with a summary of recent theoretical and\nexperimental activities investigating these changes in the nuclear shell\nstructure. \n\n"}

When these experiments are performed using macro-bolometers,\nradioactive contamination near the surfaces is of particular concern. In order\nto control the effects of surface contamination, we developed a novel technique\nthat uses composite macro-bolometers to identify energy depositions that occur\nclose to the surfaces of materials immediately surrounding the detector. The\ncomposite macro-bolometer proposed and studied here consists of a main energy\nabsorber that is thermally coupled to and entirely surrounded by thin absorbers\nthat act as active shields. Surface energy depositions can be rejected by the\nanalysis of simultaneous signals in the main absorber and the shields.

Partons losing enough energy may not even\nmake it out of the medium as identifiable jets (although the momentum will be\nshared among whatever particles are emitted). \"Full\" jet reconstruction\nattempts to determine the partonic energy loss as well as possible changes in\njet shape.

Moreover, a broad structure\nextending from 4 to 16 MeV was observed. It contains negative parity states\npopulated by Delta L=1 angular momentum transfer without other significant\ncontributions. This structure can be interpreted as a novel phenomenon, i.e.\nthe isovector soft dipole mode associated with the 6Li ground state. The\npopulation of this mode in the charge-exchange reaction is a dominant\nphenomenon for this reaction, being responsible for about 60% of the cross\nsection obtained in the measured energy range. \n\n"}

One such\ndistribution, the threshold lepton asymmetry, vanishes in tree-level QCD but is\nnon-zero if new physics modifies the relative contribution of right-handed and\nleft-handed quarks to top pair production.

This theory is exactly soluble at any value of\nthe coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of\n\"mesons\" with a finite mass and the screening of \"quark\" charge that are\ncrucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons. We find that\nthis approach describes quite well the vacuum jet fragmentation in $e^+e^-$\nannihilation at $z\\geq0.2$ at jet energies in the range of the LHC heavy ion\nmeasurements ($z$ is the ratio of hadron and jet momenta). In QCD medium, we\nfind that the JFS is reproduced if the mean free path $\\lambda$ of the jet is\nshort, $\\lambda \\leq 0.3$ fm, which is in accord with the small shear viscosity\ninferred from the measurements of the collective flow. The JFS holds since at\nshort mean free path the quantum interference (analogous to the\nLandau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect in QED) causes the produced mesons to have low\nmomenta $p \\sim m$, where $m \\simeq 0.6$ GeV is the typical meson mass.\nMeanwhile the induced jet energy loss at short mean free path is much larger\nthan naively expected in string models. \n\n"}

We argue that the low energy relations representing the\nquantum anomalies of QCD are saturated by coherent low dimensional vacuum\nconfigurations as observed in Monte Carlo lattice studies. The thermal spectrum\nand approximate universality of the temperature with no dependence on energy of\ncolliding particles in this framework is due to the fact that the emission\nresults from the distortion of these low dimensional vacuum sheets rather than\nfrom the colliding particles themselves. The emergence of the long- range\ncorrelations of P odd domains (a feature which is apparently required for\nexplanation of the asymmetry observed at RHIC and LHC) is also a result of the\nsame distortion of the QCD vacuum configurations.

We find the resulting RMF and SHF\nparametrizations give broadly consistent predictions of the symmetry energy J\nand its slope parameter L at saturation density within a tight range of <~2 MeV\nand <~6 MeV respectively, but that clear model dependence shows up in the\npredictions of higher-order symmetry energy parameters, leading to important\ndifferences in (a) the slope of the correlation between J and L from the\nconfidence ellipse, (b) the isospin-dependent part of the incompressibility of\nnuclear matter K_tau, (c) the symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities,\nand (d) the predicted neutron star radii. The model dependence can lead to\nabout 1-2 km difference in predictions of the neutron star radius given\nidentical predicted values of J, L and symmetric nuclear matter (SNM)\nsaturation properties.

We calculate the two-gluon production cross section while\nincluding all-order saturation effects in the heavy nucleus with the\nlowest-order rescattering in the lighter nucleus.

The geometric correlations (i) are due to the fact\nthat nucleons are correlated by simply being confined within the same nucleus\nand may lead to long-range rapidity correlations for the produced particles\nwithout strong azimuthal angle dependence.

Comparisons are made to measurements from the\nlarger Pb-Pb system, where such evidence is established. In particular, the\nsecond harmonic two-particle cumulants are found to decrease with multiplicity,\ncharacteristic of a dominance of few-particle correlations in p-Pb collisions.\nHowever, when a $|\\Delta \\eta|$ gap is placed to suppress such correlations,\nthe two-particle cumulants begin to rise at high-multiplicity, indicating the\npresence of global azimuthal correlations.

The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately\n35 inverse nanobarns, were collected at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy\n(sqrt(s[NN])) of 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The results are\ncompared to semi-peripheral PbPb collision data at sqrt(s[NN]) = 2.76 TeV,\ncovering similar charged-particle multiplicities in the events. The observed\nazimuthal correlations at large relative pseudorapidity are used to extract the\nsecond-order (v[2]) and third-order (v[3]) anisotropy harmonics of K0S and\nLambda/anti-Lambda particles. These quantities are studied as a function of the\ncharged-particle multiplicity in the event and the transverse momentum of the\nparticles.

Heavy quarks are considered good probe to study the QCD\nmatter created in relativistic collisions due to their very large mass and\nother unique properties. A precise measurement of various properties of heavy\nflavor hadrons provides an insight into the fundamental properties of the hot\nand dense medium created in these nuclei-nuclei collisions, such as transport\ncoefficient and thermalization and hadronization mechanisms.

Liquid argon time\nprojection chambers (LArTPCs) possess various advantages in measuring\nelectroweak neutrino-nucleus cross sections. Concurrent theoretical research is\nan evident necessity.

We present inclusive differential\nand total cross section results for charged-current neutrino scattering on 40Ar\nand perform a comparison with 12C, 16O and 56Fe targets, to find out about the\nA-dependent behavior of model predictions.

These partons dynamically generate the quark gluon\nplasma (QGP) fluids through the source terms in the hydrodynamic equations.\nAccording to the core-corona picture, this process tends to happen where the\ndensity of generated partons is high and their transverse momentum is low. Some\npartons do not fully participate in this process when they are in dilute\nregions or their transverse momentum is high and subsequently fragment into\nhadrons through string fragmentation. In this framework, the final hadrons come\nfrom either chemically equilibrated fluids as in the conventional hydrodynamic\nmodels or string fragmentation. We calculate the ratio of strange baryons to\ncharged pions as a function of multiplicity and find that it monotonically\nincreases up to $dN_{\\mathrm{ch}}/d\\eta \\sim 100$ and then saturates above.\nThis suggests that the QGP fluids are \\textit{partly} created and that their\nfraction increases with multiplicity in p+p and p+Pb collisions at LHC\nenergies. \n\n"}

Abstract: Recent measurements of the cosmic ray (CR) antiproton flux have been shown to\nchallenge existing CR propagation models. It was shown that the reacceleration\nmodels designed to match secondary to primary nuclei ratios (e.g.,\nboron/carbon) produce too few antiprotons. Matching both the secondary to\nprimary nuclei ratio and the antiproton flux requires artificial breaks in the\ndiffusion coefficient and the primary injection spectrum suggesting the need\nfor other approaches.\n  In the present paper we discuss one possibility to overcome these\ndifficulties. Using the measured antiproton flux AND B/C ratio to fix the\ndiffusion coefficient, we show that the spectra of primary nuclei as measured\nin the heliosphere may contain a fresh local \"unprocessed\" component at low\nenergies perhaps associated with the Local Bubble, thus decreasing the measured\nsecondary to primary nuclei ratio.

The general concordance\nbetween the predicted and observed light element abundances provides a direct\nprobe of the universal baryon density. Recent CMB anisotropy measurements,\nparticularly the observations performed by the WMAP satellite, examine this\nconcordance by independently measuring the cosmic baryon density. Key to this\ntest of concordance is a quantitative understanding of the uncertainties in the\nBBN light element abundance predictions. These uncertainties are dominated by\nsystematic errors in nuclear cross sections. We critically analyze the cross\nsection data, producing representations that describe this data and its\nuncertainties, taking into account the correlations among data, and explicitly\ntreating the systematic errors between data sets. Using these updated nuclear\ninputs, we compute the new BBN abundance predictions, and quantitatively\nexamine their concordance with observations.

Corrections due to magnetic scattering were also made\nbefore the rms-radius was determined by a fit which allows free normalization\nfor each experiment. It is shown that an analysis of electron scattering data\nincluding Coulomb corrections lowers the $\\chi^2$ of the fit and increases the\nproton radius by about (0.008 - 0.013) fm depending on the fit strategy. A\nvalue of r_p = 0.880 (15) fm is obtained which is in good agreement with the\none extracted from Lamb shift measurements. \n\n"}

UV\nlight reflector material, PTFE, is used to optimize the light collection\nefficiency. The detector gives a high light yield of 6 photoelectron per keV\n(pe/keV), which allows efficient detection of the 122 keV gamma-ray line from\nCo-57, with a measured energy resolution of (8.8+/-0.6)% (sigma). The best\nachievable energy resolution, by removing the instrumental fluctuations, from\nliquid xenon scintillation light is estimated to be around 6-8% (sigma) for\ngamma-ray with energy between 662 keV and 122 keV. \n\n"}
